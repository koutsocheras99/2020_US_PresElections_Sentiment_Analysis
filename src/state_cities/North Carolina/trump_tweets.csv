I just wanna say that one day I’m gonna run for local politics and I’m gonna win on just the interpretation of why democratic economic agenda is superior to conservative economics. And my greatest example will be the economic disaster Donald trump is creating for the generation
THIS is why we love Trump
We’ll go back to the way things were (booming economy, lowest black, Hispanic unemployment, reduced regulations) once Trump is re-elected in November
Scott Ford was attached and hated for supporting Trump in 2016, and will now be attacked and hated for turning on him in 2020.  Moral of the story: Scott Ford isn’t likable🤔
I just don’t understand the calculations of these Trump sycophants.... people will continue to get sick, at a significantly increased rate, and Trump has very little chance of getting re-elected. There is no upside that justifies their recklessness.
That Trump shirt has never look so good

If I had been a life long Republican I would be mad as hell this piece of 💩 hijacked my party. This isn't the Republican party going on right now it's Trump's party of con jobs.

Yeah, so no. You have a choice between Trump or Biden period. Pathetic if you would even remotely consider to vote for Trump or 3rd party.
If opposed by someone who knows what they are doing (Trump) and not someone who is courting their vote (Biden), or any other sorry-ass Democrat.

As person who prefers Republicans to democrats but likes Biden (the person) more than trump and sees both parties paying less attention to people with my views, I feel the only way I can make my voice heard is voting for someone else.

The numbers for these other deaths are being written off as COVID-19 deaths for profit and by Democrats to hurt Trump.
Leftists want him to be president. If he debates trump it would be for entertainment purposes. It would be funny with what joe Biden says.

Anyone who thinks Biden shouldn’t debate Trump should google up some earlier Biden debates, he might be best debater in my lifetime.
Biden will eat Trumps lunch in a debate, he is a great debater &amp; he’ll call Trumps lies out, while Trump still has the floor.  Biden is knowledgeable on history, military, trade agreements, he can talk details &amp; defuse untruths

All you trump supporters or anti blm see this as resisting after they pulled already with a gun in his, does not mean he is on drugs
Hopefully most of us will realize that Donald Trump is the only chance we have to stop the “Real Looting “ of America. There are some Republicans involved also, they are called “Never-Trumpers.
The amount of spin that has to be done to keep Trump happy is staggering. We insult his lack of basic understanding of things known to all, but I gotta believe that part of the issue (aside from his own lack of critical thinking) is how hard his staff paints rosy picture for him.
I understand. My family are Trump supporters. It's painful to watch.
And now, some good news:   Trump approval back to 51% and supporters 70% more enthusiastic than Biden’s

Yeah, just think about the Ebola outbreak where he immediately sent team of drs to Africa to contain there, gosh 1 American died &amp; 2 others contracted Ebola. Trump thoughtfully removed the rep in China last year, we had no one there to lead, kind of like here.

Ah, but a doctor can treat a patient as he sees fit. That medicine has been approved since 1955. And it has been used for many illnesses since, most recently for SARS which is similar to COVID-19. Just remember, it’s all about hate for Trump.
I respectfully disagree. They could kill people, and as a matter of fact they injured man of the people defending the buildings. Is it worth it just to defeat Trump at the ballot box to create so much misery? Evidently for you. I have no respect for such people.
Yes, I did. But you go to war with what you have and hope for something better. You and others didn’t want it because it was touted by Trump. The people who died are on you and others because of your hate for Trump.
he’ll be remembered for ignoring virus, we’re on track to be over 250,000 deaths this year. Lost about 2900 on 9/11.  The economy Trump inherited was strong &amp; he blew it, it’s in the crapper now &amp; everyone is impacted &amp; will be for a decade.  That’s the trump legacy.

Looking forward to seeing you voted out.  You helped enable trump and all of his divisions in this country.
Really? What happened to no concerns we got this under full control.... Trump’s stated concern for poll safety defies his otherwise aggressive push to “reopen” the nation from partial shutdowns meant to slow the spread of the virus, even as rising confirmed coronavirus cases,

You wanted me to say one thing about Biden that didn’t mention Trump so I mentioned the one thing Biden is that Trump isn’t: he’s a good person.
Trump is trash for a million other reasons. He’s an idiot, too, but I used his issues with the word Yosemite as an example. Just the most recent one. I want Biden as president for one reason only: he’s going to beat Trump in November
I feel sorry for you because you’re defending Trump who is literally indefensible. There’s not one redeeming quality about him. He’s trash and so are his supporters.
The mental gymnastics it must require for you to watch Trump fumble hard over the word Yosemite and believe he’s doing it on purpose. I actually feel sorry for you.
Trump will go down as the worst president in history. No one is as comparable to him

Trump is a pathological liar. And an absolute moron. I’d be more confident in Joe Biden 100%. Was he my first choice in primaries? No. Is he the obvious choice for the soul of our Democracy in November? 1000% yes. Trump is an embarrassment. An all-time loser on a historical level

Damn. They would let us die just to make Trump look bad
Under Trump we had the best economy ever! And your kids not going to school? Thank your local governor! I am sorry but your remarks are stupid. Trump had NOTHING to do with this pandemic. If you think that go live in Italy or any other country hit hard.
Wow! Really you guys are such a JOKE!  Mail in ballots are the only way Dems can win.  Dems will be the ones to commit a federal offense and sabotage the vote.  Trump knows this that’s why he is fighting it. Dems will do ANYTHING to win.
They know he is incapable of running the country.  He has held an office for what 40 years? and didn’t do anything to amount to much and people actually think he can do better than Trump? Not a chance!
He is trying to make the decision based on who will actually be the next president if he were to win (God help us).  He is a puppet to some powerful politicians. No debates because he has nothing to debate on. Trump would chew him up and spit him out.

President Donald Trump said U.S. military generals have told him that they think the massive explosion that rocked Beirut on Tuesday, killing more than 70 people, was likely a bomb.

Glad to see trump give $35M to human trafficking survivors. Please keep telling me how bad of a person he is. It shows your ignorance to the facts.
The most common reason is that they want to vote for Biden because they believe that’s the most likely way to prevent Trump from having a second term. Secondary to that is they dislike elements of the libertarian platform. Their preferred candidate was typically Elizabeth Warren.
So this really is Trump being pissed that the TikTok kids ruined his rally.  Fair enough I guess.
You could make it easier and say that Donald Trump loves it. He does, by the way.

I can't give a definitive on what Biden is or is proposing to do while in office. I can tell you what he is not.  1. He is not Trump.  2. He is not an intentional racist. 3. He is not under investigation from multiple authorities for crimes committed. 1/?

Do you think Trump is planning to attend Herman Cain's memorial? I mean, since attending Trump's rally is what killed him? Or do you think he'll take no responsibility at all?

How does Trump's demon semen taste?
Trump loves the illiterate
Can you please let  negotiate without you trying to characterize her strategy. Trump see’s your interview and will happily think he is winning.stop it for Christ’s sake! It’s a f’ing Negotiation...:You literally want Dems to accept whatever Reps.  offer.
Ah, a Trump supporter, I see? Makes sense.
It didn't but, it does now after the way all of these Repuglicans have sold their soul in support of Trump.

Why do you think President Trump said, "This may be the last time you see me for a while."? I value your thoughts.
I think you misunderstood what I said. I took a jab at Trump and his conservative cronies, not supported them

Monkeying around with this shows me that it could all come down to my current state of North Carolina, which means Trump will 100% be reelected I'm sorry to say.
You shouldn’t criticize people and their religion. Trump only has one religion, himself
Again Trump, no one believes anything you say.🤥🤥🤥🤥
YOU ARE NOT A REPUBLICAN, CONSERVATIVE OR PATRIOT, TAKE YOUR MASK OFF!, YOU ARE DEEP STATE, JUST LIKE DADDY! PRESIDENT TRUMP WILL WIN AND YOU WILL BE AN UNKNOWN!
Lmaoooo what if everybody ends up registering to vote on campus, then Trump decides to actually take Covid seriously and remove us from campus again and it’s too late for absentee ballots 🥴

This article is so irresponsible. Trump is dangerous and mentally unfit, and there is no one that Biden could pick as his VP that would in any way shape or form justify not voting for him over Trump.
Give the hurting people the money they need instead of using money for FBI buildings across from Trump Tower
True, and something tells me that Trump might have dug himself a hole he can’t dig himself out of this time.
I see many voters sitting this 1 out. Biden’s whole campaign is “ I’m not Trump! “ Biden turns 78 in Nov. I wouldn’t want a 78 yr. old driving me in a car, much less running the country! There will be backlash, but Dems need to blame themselves! They had 4 years to groom a champ!
Trump 2020 BECAUSE OUR SURVIVAL DEPENDS ON IT!🇺🇸
The left uses every trick in the book to keep Biden off that stage with Trump! They come up with every lie and excuse to keep him away from Trump!  Biden is mentally impaired...America isn't fooled! Biden smells of fear!
The virus is proliferating here now worse than anywhere else. If we’re gonna name it after the party responsible for the most deaths, the Trump virus is a much better name.

Probably. But, few of us are fundamentally persuadeable, right? Regardless of which party/which candidate we prefer. Like the few % who may vote Biden but might have  voted Trump over Bernie. Which is why the Dems blocked Bernie, but are pushing Biden 2 run on Bernie's views.

Not voting for Trump isn’t the same as supporting Biden. I think privately you do, but why not say it?! It doesn’t make you less of a conservative to say Joe is the best choice AND the Joe has been an enormous support to you &amp; your family.
I won’t be surprised to see Clinton involvement with Epstein! I can’t wait to see the vast amount of wealthy politicians involved with Epstein.  Trump’s at the top of the list, starting with the trial of rape of a 13 yr old they keep burying for the prez

I'll be voting for Trump in North Carolina
Twitter temporarily blocked Trump campaign from tweeting
You've 100% become a house ni$$a for Donald Trump. He'll have u fetching his slippers in term 2.
That's absolutely 100% none if your business what other black woman do with there bodies. Kanye west doesn't care about black ppl. The lawyer who got him on the Wisconsin ballot also works for the trump campaign.
Usually the challenger is the one asking for more debates.  Trump knows Biden won’t do a 4th but is just using it for a political hammer.  I think Biden should propose either 6 or 3 debates and watch Trump move in to something else.
Trump
Goddammm why are trump Republicans all fat outta shape pasty old white dudes? America ain't 99% old white men so why is the Republican party? How is that representative of the American population?

Just want to say that even if Obama was actually the one to have built the cages that immigrant children are in, it doesn’t make Trump look any better. Why? BECAUSE HE DIDN’T HAVE TO USE THEM.  I’m not worshipping Obama, but dammit, stop using that as a defense 🤦‍♀️
And yet the Trump administration had the option to not use them, but still did, making him still be the villain here.
Trump is full of shit! Of course y'all know that already!!
Trump: Obama's eulogy of John Lewis a 'terrible,' 'angry' speech   there was nothing angry about it, u even speaking on it is bc ur angry. Get over urself u big fat soft twinky. Twinky trump. And stop tryna suppress the vote.u seem desperate
I mean you guys talk so bad about things that Trump says but are completely silent when this goon speaks... I mean he’s a moron but damn, gotta vote for him!
Yup like trump believes in what...making money to lose it. Unbuilding our country so your children can rebuild it. Yup keeping out the people who can build leaves your children to clean toilets, build, pick cotton you know. Yea let's give you our old job good luck
Unbelievable.  The double-standard here is just beyond comprehension.  If this was a Republican, let alone President Trump, there would be demands for resignation on every news outlet in this country.  Appalling.

Don’t get giddy about a few congressional seats that won’t mean a thing if Trump is still president after Nov 3rd.
This is why it is essential for the "corruptors" to make certain that Trump is not reelected!  This is why you see the "resisting", the "sabotaging" with the help of false reporting, all this so none of it comes out. How can "Public Servants" become multi-millionaires?
You use this virus to attack Trump because you can't win on anything.  As a heart disease, diabetic,  stage 3 cancer patient I'm most vulnerable yet nothing.
Love how you idiots left out that it was the opinion of our TOP GENERALS that it was an attack. 14 years of experience told me it was an attack before Trump opened his mouth. But you morons play a clip without including him saying it was the generals opinion orbhim saying they'd

Kind of how Trump’s inauguration was bigger than Obama’s
Maybe Trump will bring his cognitive test and ask Joe to take it on the air 😂😂
Yosemite Trump #TrumpIsALaughingStock #YoSemites #Yosemite
Trump HAS done more for blacks than any other president than Lincoln!  Do your homework and stop your jealousy! It doesn't fit your narrative, does it? Too bad!  We're sick of your lies about our president!!
Interesting how the Trump campaign advisor mentioned ballot harvesting. A Republican operative in North Carolina used this tactic to get a Republican elected to the state Legislature.  The State Board of Elections threw out the result.
You know, I disapprove of Trump's work as President but a return to what was going on while Obama was President worries me more. I would never vote for a Democrat! This year has been awful and I don't think anyone really could have done a good job.

Trump 2020
No offense but that same bill that Trump signed, stalled in the Senate when Pres.Obama was in office, for like 4 years. They didn’t want to give Obama another signature piece of legislation to sign. Republicans played politics with people’s lives.
Definitely. In fact, I think it’s safe to say that no one owes Trump ANYTHING.
Someone tell you Trump is gonna lose this election AND NOT BE PRESIDENT. Gotta day that because he LOST the last election as well but screwed our system into office with the help of Russia!
"Kim Jong Un, he speaks and his whole country listens up and heeds his words. That's what I want here in America" - Donald John Trump
I can’t believe he didn’t walk out on the interview! I’m talking about Trump, of course. Ok, Swan probably wanted to walk out too.....
I think the sad part is this “whataboutism”” he displays. John Lewis was a Civil Rights icon. History will remember him with glowing praise. Trump will be remembered as a incompetent B-rated reality star, who became President because of his innate ability to drum white grievances
Trump’s  interview shows how unqualified he is for this moment.   In a moment where our country needs leadership and competence, he has neither.   Donald Trump is an empty suit.
Trump keeps saying things like “the virus is getting better!” or whatever — but in all our daily lives we see that’s blatantly not true.
Presto! Change-o! Trump's magic wand! Change doesn't happen just b/c you say so.
This is Trump in a nutshell.
What an absolute disaster this interview was! Wow! Big props to  for not spraining his eyes from all the totally worthy rolls that coulda/woulda/shoulda happened.  #AxiosOnHBO #trump #Novemberiscoming #VoteHimOut
Took a social media break for a couple days. Open up Twitter this morning and I think I might need a couple more. Ffs, I swear Trump is the dumbest person on the Planet! 🤦‍♀️
He was no saint! He let his state turn into a slum and did nothing about it!  A very arrogant man who had some good points but also was no saint! Trump was being honest! He was very disrespectful of our president and unwilling to work with him! The funeral was way overdone!!
A must read on this interview between Trump and Swan on the pandemic.
Only 92 days until it’s safe for kids to go to school, Covid is said to be much more undestood and riots die off and no reason to start them back up on 4 years because Trump will be ineligible to run! #Trump2020
White House denies report that national coronavirus testing plan was scrapped to hurt blue states   u killed ur own ppl dictator trump...what u did is no different than what Saddam Hussein did to his ppl.
Thank you for your honest piece on ‘the republican party on the trump administration’ These are things that black political culture amongst themselves talk about all the time... it’s truly good to see you bringing this up. #whitegrievanceparty
You won’t get it but people like y’all deserve 4 more years of Trump torturing your brains. If the survival of the nation wasn’t at stake it would be funny to watch libs cry for another 4 years.
I been watching  my whole life decided to try something new   they are the true haters. They love trump
the majority of Americans cant wait to see trump dragged from the White House kicking and screaming like the little girl he is 😂😂😂😂
Hey bro, Republican and Democrats are Persons their both a party. You may like trump but not the republicans. You may like democrats but not Biden.
President Biden should pardon Donald Trump, this way he is reduced to a memory, a distant reminder of when we hated, when we were scared, when we lacked hope and were sick.  When we were divided and were fearful, no more, now hopeful and now turning a new corner, together.
President Biden’s first course of action:  pardon Donald J Trump.   This way we can move on, relinquishing him and his awful being, his lies, his divisiveness to the footnotes of a bad memory, a miserable experience, hopefully to never be repeated.
I just don’t understand the logic because Trump calls a lot of people lo IQ of all races. Probably more often to white folks.
I dare you
And this is what they aimed at: collapse and bankruptcy of businesses so they can blame Trump, it's all about their attempts to see that he is not reelected, no matter who gets hurt!
President Biden’s first action should be to pardon Donald Trump.  This will allow our country to move on, forgetting him and his reign of incompetence and division.
President Biden’s first action should be to grant immunity to Donald Trump.  This will allow country to heal, move on and forget him and his reign of incompetence, division and terror.
What about everything Trump can fix and doesn't? Executive order that early on would make sure PPE for all front line workers. National mask wearing. Took +3 yrs for him to say global warming not a hoax. Sorry. He even propagandizing mail in ballots and voting date. It's on him.
Donald Trump Challenges Nevada Mail-in Voting Stunt: ‘See You in Court!‘  via   I sent the solution last night:
Republicans and President Trump needs to watch how they handle this because people do you know what they were told to do work wise and If he and the Republicans doesn’t do the right thing this could hurt Republicans in November and I definitely don’t want to see that.
Thus making the claim that Trump supporters are a "silent" majority rather absurd, no?
You know im not a fan of trump myself but holy shit is this just not productive. Why instead of dance say what you dont like about the dude.
I agree with if all the businesses will open up.I know people right now even with the 600 that is not making more than they were making when they were working. They want to go back to work We all know people vote on how their finances are &amp; I do not want this to hurt Trump.
and 14 percent of those ages 45 to 64 who are registered to vote have a favorable opinion of Trump. By contrast, 21 percent of black voters ages 18 to 29 and 29 percent of black voters ages 30 to 44 have a favorable view of the president. In addition, there is also a notable age
This CNA is right behind you in voting Trump out of office! Let’s go!
Trump is slightly more popular among younger black Americans That’s not just because younger voters tend to be indecisive this many months out from the election. Trump is somewhat more popular with younger black Americans than with their elders. Just 9 percent of black seniors
Isn’t it ironic how you cannot tell the difference between a Trump supporter and that Russian woman from Florida.
To be honest, I would not be surprised if we learned many older members of the infamous birtherism movement were once segregation supporters. I'm sure it's not a total coincidence that Trump dominated with voters older than fifty five, the same age of the Civil Rights Act.
I know some people are making more money that they would be making if they were working. But I would say that the majority probably are not. Besides that I believe it will hurt the economy if they stopped then also it would hurt Trump In November.
I would say that all the liberal media outlets have been unfair to the president since he came down the escalator in trump tower. Liberals scoff at the term fake news but they constantly face plant every time. The whole Russian collusion hoax has been factually proven a hoax...
Chris Wallace is the worst. He is a democrat not a Republican. He asked harder questions to Trump that these 2 idiots running for VP with Biden

I think you're a Obama Trump debate would be great. Oh ✋ cuz Trump would have his lunch over Obama Gate.

Dangerous Evangelical. He's as bad as Trump but smarter.
You are crying into the wind of Trump and Republican conduct, that is drowning out your message.   I strongly agree with you, but you need to get the herd of cats in your own administration on board FIRST.
If you think progressive white males don’t love Trump secretly you’re delusional. If he wasn’t so openly racist and a bigot they would support him because of “economic populism” and anti-establishment rhetoric “ they love trumps policies but hate he isn’t politically correct”. 😑
More blockage of the Trump Man!
This is truly a sad sight to see. U don't know that trump didn't want blacks in his apartments in the 60s and 70s he was delivered a class action suit for violation of the fair housing act against blacks? Sad. U promote a man who hates ur skin
What u did to Fauci was a joke,  shame on u. If only 7 had such passion grilling trump on his failures to contain covid. Every other country is doing much better except ours bc of u and ur fascist party.
You do realize that Trump is the reason we are in this situation?? And  I love the fact that y'all are so intimidated by a real woman and leader. 150,000 dead because your leader has no idea how to lead. Take your bullshit somewhere else
In your dreams - TRUMP 2020!!!!!!!!!!!  In a landslide!
Dictator (wanna be) Trump, you are wrong.   You continue to display your ignorance.  The underlying level of disease is higher because you failed to lead a unified response.  You continue to fail at leadership, causing increasing damage to the economy.
Why is Trump involved with the sale at all?
You mean the Surgeon General that Trump put in place?? Your argument is invalid!
“The school attended by [President Trump’s] youngest son has received an order prohibiting on-campus learning for the start of the school year.”
I’ll still mail in my vote. He’s not trolling “libs”. Trump is incompetent and just dumb. He needs to get my stimulus check sent out ASAP. Be useful
if trump was gonna ban tiktok than he shouldve done it already
Trump, Q have in control
I'd vote for a ketchup bottle over Trump.
Trolling? We don’t have time for trolling Stefanie. You and Trump need to grow up. It’s serious out here. Real life. People are dying!
It's now the United States of Trump.
Sorry you feel that way Erin. Trump really has done a lot of great stuff for our country. I hope you’ll research prior to voting and I hope you feel more empowered soon because we live in the greatest country on earth and u deserve it!!  God Bless You!
I was not a Trump fan and didn’t vote for him in 16. I’ve done a lot of research of what this administration has done and learned a lot about the DS. Trump has earned my vote. Please research before voting. 🙏🏻
But Biden has said almost nothing, as he didn't have to. Trump has been shooting himself in the foot.
Trump would rather worry about banning tikok rather than schools opening during Covid. What a joke #tiktokban #tiktok
If Trump isn't reelected then his presidency ends at noon on January 20th and the Speaker of the house becomes President.
Trump doesn't care about anyone but himself.
You do realize that Trump is the greatest threat to the Constitution ever, right?
Trump's not going after him. Of all the times to bite his tongue smh
I'd trade Trump going to jail for Clinton admitting he did this
Like Trump Casinos, Trump Air, Trump Steaks, USA GDP down 32% Q2.  Gotcha.
Trump is the greatest disaster in history.
If Trump rallies and other events spread #COVID, then Black Lives Matter rallies are too
You do know that Trump is building a 13 foot high wall around the White House, right?
Check your state's laws for mail in ballots if that's how you're voting. Request your ballots now. Trump will do anything to win. At everyone else's cost. Workers, recipients of critical meds, etc.
It's amazing that everything that critics feared about Pres. Obama has come to pass in Pres. Trump.
Sorry to burst your little bubble but you won’t find shit on Trump!🤣bc it doesn’t exist!
Two weeks ago today: President Trump told Chris Wallace he would be "signing a health care plan within two weeks, a full and complete health care plan.”  Ok so where is it

Trump's singing Alice in Chains
So TRUMP WINS 2020 by yuge landslide!
No he wasn't but trump was holding girls down for Jeffrey
Nope but trump was holding girls down for Jeffrey
WHAT HONOR? Who of these people did anything for their country Except portray some one they aren't on a movie screen.   at least Trump made it to something other than the status of celebrity
Try as you might, you’ll find no dirt on Trump!
Does it fucking matter? What's Trump gonna do to the fucking CCP not a fucking thing bro
If the Republican party is willing to go along and repeat Trump's lies defying Fauci, and conspiracy theories, of course, people will believe Trump and the GOP would falsify data to quicken the use of a vaccine; Trump's already lying about an effective treatment.
Scalise remarks are political and kissing Trump's ring on his finger...
My Trump supporter friends are mad because I removed them from my facebook. Im sorry but I can sit there in smile in your face knowing you worship a racist demon... am I wrong ?
Have you filed your taxes by mail?  Utah, Colorado, Washington, Oregon and Hawaii have had vote- by-mail for years.  You want me to believe voting by mail won’t work?   Both Bush 2 &amp; Trump set up commissions to “expose” voter fraud only to disband them when they found zippo.
Understandable, but again, I didn’t retweet the original post for Trump supporters 👍🏻
The USPS has to be destroyed to validate Trump's claim that absentee voting won't work. Welcome to the United States of Trump.
I keep wondering that every time Trump opens his mouth.
That’s a lie I got my first two homes under the Obama administration...The housing market is soaring back until Trump..Even though the interest rates are low no homes are being built no neighborhoods are being built....Which drives up housing prices not to mention loaning issues.
I am far from broken asshole!! As a matter of fact, I am fired up to vote Trump's traitor ass out in November. Nice try though....go away

Never be as great as Trump
I don’t deny that..But David Duke and the KKK support the Republican nominee, The alt-right, you know the group who was saying “Jews will not replace us”? &amp; most other white Supremacists support Donald Trump. The party of the confederate flag &amp; states rights when it suits them.
It's Trump that's murdering people.
Yes I'm voting for Trump Concord North Carolina
Excuse me but YOU DONT KNOW WHAT TRUMP CAN DO! You’d be amazed at what’s C o m I n g!!!!
I agree. But this all sure seems like Trump is expecting to lose regardless. He knows ALL those polls can’t be fake...
Well, either plausible deniability or just not trusting him to keep his mouth shut. If it was your job to guard a huge secret like that, would you hand that info over to a loose cannon like Trump?
So y’all not going to report on the GDP numbers or Trump’s tweet?
Exactly. If Trump isn't reelected then his presidency ends at noon on January 20th.
It can't be delayed. It's in the Constitution. If there's no election then Trump's presidency ends at noon on January 20th and the Speaker of the house, Nancy Pelosi,  becomes President.
That would put Mike Pence in the White House. Trump is out at noon on January 20th if there isn't an election. The Speaker of the house then takes over, currently Nancy Pelosi.

I’m tired of being in a depression....Trump is the worst president in my lifetime and maybe the second or third worst president ever
vote trump out 2020Do I think that Donald Trump should go to jail? Yes Do I also believe that Bill Clinton should go to jail? Yes  Stop denying connections to Epstein and Maxwell because that is what fits your party affiliation. They are all disgusting people and deserve to be put away.
Those polls were getting lower and lower...you know...the Trump Boomerang Effect 😝
how long have reporters been going to trump's country clubs for press conferences  why is there a live audience of the president's fans at a press conference  all of this is weird and bad
🗽President Trump has an agenda and he is going after them all!! 🗽 Trump Admin Awards $35 Million in Housing Grants to Assist Human Trafficking Survivors
Because it looks good for the administration to warn the Russians and Pompeo wants Trump to get re-elected so he can keep his job/standing.
China wants Biden, Russia wants Trump. Who is surprised?
Quick. Somebody tell Trump that Obama signed an EO giving everyone $2000/month.
As I have always said Donald Trump couldn't lead a one man parade.
So trump is issuing an executive order mandating that insurance companies cover pre-existing conditions? Well I’m issuing an executive order giving women the right to vote.
Cmon on people!  Don’t u think Trump told McConnell “don’t deal w/Pelosi &amp; Schumer. Ill come in &amp; sign executive order saving benefits for the American people.” Dang, America, wake up. We have the most desperate despot In office capable of manipulating the weakest among us?!!
Ticking covid bomb.  Hope they get really close to Trump and hug him.
Trump rejecting it accomplished nothing. It is the law.
If you play trump’s speeches backwards you’ll hear Satan crying for mercy.
Trump fired Board Members of TVA and the employees they had laid off, just got their jobs back!  #BestPresidentEver45
And the crowds keep getting smaller. Soon Trump can hold his get togethers in an outhouse. Once you have seen the orange haired clown you don't need to see him again.
Trump long has relied on nondisclosure deals to prevent criticism. That strategy may be unraveling.
While we have 150,000 dead from Covid, 30% drop in GDP, school disruptions, state budgets busted, and the sworn duty of an election, what’s Trump putting his attention on? Changing the news to WeChat and TickTock!? #ncpol
Economic collapse on Trump’s watch.
Rick Scott has let individuals die in Florida because he walked in lock step with Trump.
In 1999 Trump called himself a Democrat too.  It was typical Trump anyhow...compare what he said then to what he’s actually done while in power.  The wealth gap, that was already massive, has only grown &amp; shows no sign of changing.
Why does trump still think the 1918 flu pandemic occurred in 1917?
But what is the remedy? Or, is it, as are so many things Trump has done, without any remedy as long as Senate Republicans protect him and Barr enables him?
Except the conspiracy theory that you all expect the Durham report to color doesn’t make sense on its face. The obama admin spies on Trump’s campaign only to release none of the info before the election all the while re-opening the one into HRC? And Obama, Biden and Rice knew?
LOL. What an idiot. Joe would show Trump up in a debate.
More importantly, who do our longtime allies like Europe, Canada, Japan, S. Korea, Israel, etc. want to win.  Hint: It’s NOT Trump. They are all tired of the unreliability, inconsistency, and constant tearing down of longtime institutions that built western democracy for decades.
"[NEPA] a tool of democracy, a tool for the people. We’re not going to stand idly by while the Trump administration eviscerates it.”
Maybe the GOP governors think Trump will take care of their states the way he has done with National Guard costs in Texas and Florida. Each day Trump shows more and more that he is President of the GOP States and not President of the United States.
Regarding the E. Jean Carroll court decision and the NYC investigations against Trump and family, if all Trump's chickens ever come home to roost, it will look like Hitchcock's "The Birds" and Trump will hopefully have run out of cover.
I have no sources. Just the evidence, which is that after almost four full years of searching the Trump DOJ has turned up absolutely nothing.
After years of calling Trump a racist the Democrats choose one to run for President.  Unbelievable.

Trump isn’t blending very well either. #TrumpIsANationalDisgrace
You’re a joke.  Trump is a clown.  Thanks for playing.
It's adorable how you, ostensibly a 'fact-checker,' put the word doctored in quotation marks and use some kind of cartoon rating system instead of just saying up front that the Trump campaign is lying and misleading the public in its ads
I thought Trump didn’t need money from donors or lobbyists???  That was his “argument” for how he could never be corrupted, right?  All the #MAGA sheeple will believe anything he says.  The GOP has raised millions for this professional con man who “didn’t need money”.
It actually *is* fine to have a *former* drug dealer at the WH. Paying your debt to society is GOOD. And Trump’s had Kanye at the WH, who doesn’t exactly have a clean arrest history. And then how many Trump staffers have gone to jail for crimes WHILE working at WH? Idiot.
I would say that Trump is correct.  Look at the number of death compared to NY and NJ.
Trump long has relied on nondisclosure deals to prevent criticism. That strategy may be unraveling.
It's really pretty simple.  Each Governor is responsible for health care for their State.  Trump supplied ventilators.  Governors have what they requested.  Trump did his job.
Finally... a leader who knows what his presidential duties are, and does them! Saving the US and the world- thank you President Trump!
Jerry Falwell, Jr., is a pretty good poster boy for the GOP under Trump.  #ncpol
We have Trump to thank for the current boldness of such despicable people. If they can't do better, let them slither back under their rocks.  ‘I can say anything I want’: Michigan official defends using racist slur while refusing to wear a mask
Seriously, if you're a #NeverTrump Republican who recognizes the danger Trump poses, you can't just vote him out and keep his enablers.  You've gotta vote Dem for House and Senate until your party gets it $#!+ together.
That's fair criticism.  However, Trump is the one who badmouths Fauci.  Fauci sticks with the facts and if it contradicts Trump, so be it.
With all the truly horrible things Trump has done -- and not done -- this is what we want to take him to task over? Really? "Twitter users get a kick out of how Trump mispronounced Thailand"  via
It’s war for data Eri, is nothing about Donald Trump. In my opinion was a BIG move and it will open the doors for other bans and awareness about data collection and encryption. THANKS Donald Trump, TikTok doesn’t add any good to society anyway
Ya, Trump’s tweet was allll about Kanye, hoping he’ll take votes away from Biden and split the ticket. Which isn’t racist at all, LOL. Doesn’t Kaye know he’s being used?
SE, if you don’t vote for Biden because of his VP pick after alllll the BS that Trump has done to this country, then you are voting for Trump. Period.  Suck it up and do the right thing. Unbelievable...
Donald J Trump is your President.
What Biden said was IGNORANT, but I’ve seen way too many bad takes. If you are willing to vote for Trump because of what Biden just said, then wait to I show you Trump has been doing for the past three decades 👀
Oh? I can think of a lot of chiefs. Chief Justice (Roberts), Chief Deputy, Commander in Chief... Isn’t Trump the supposed Cammander in Chief? Ya, not rascist.
Q: President Trump says voting by mail is fraudulent. Can I trust the system?  A: There is no evidence... Trump has made outlandish claims about voter fraud swaying elections for years, but he has never been able to show any proof to back up those claims.
Why does Trump always put the word God in the same sentence as guns? Which is God's weapon of chose? AK-47 AR-15 The other cheek
Yes. She, like Trump, pronounced it incorrectly
Buffoon lost it long ago (or never had it). What gets me is there are still many people who believe this garbage and truly feel Trump is a religious and honest man.
The order will ban any transactions between TikTok's parent company and U.S. citizens for national security reasons.  TikTok has downplayed its ties to Beijing, saying data it captures on U.S. users is stored mostly in Virginia.
It's costing over 1,000 lives a day to pay the price of keeping Donald Trump in office.  That would make any loanshark blush!  And it's more than we can afford, or should pay!!!
I love the show, but your teaser talking about Biden gaffe and not adding Trump with his crazy remarks in OH was inappropriate.
Interesting that Cupp would vote for Biden with Harris but not with Rice. I wonder how many other anti-Trump Republicans agree.  Of course, it's foolish. If you're a Never Trump conservative, it must be because you recognize the existential threat he poses. Vote Biden either way.
story I'm hearing from friends/family in Ohio is that he never tested positive, he just said that so he could avoid having to get together with Trump ;) . . .
I don’t understand why trump even bothers to say sentences anymore. It’s just dog whistles with negativity. Might as well just stand up and say words in a row and let Fox spin it. “Guns, Roe, God, Disappear, Open, Economy, Tremendous, Perfect, Boat Parade.”
Biden 49 Trump 49
Wants to run?  Where you been?  Hiding in the bunker with Trump?
She spends months writing about how unfit trump is for office and now indicates she is willing to be a part of putting him back in office.
If Trump said the exact same thing you would be howling racist from the roof top.   The MSM is lying to you.  Wake up.

They were worried about Trump and the Nuclear Football.   Come on, man' you can't give the Football to Biden.  He might start the apocalypse!

God must not be as all powerful as all of the Bible verses say he is.  Or else Biden is really that damn powerful.  Either way, why would ANYONE listen to Donald f’ing Trump about anything that has to do with Christianity?  He’s the most morally bankrupt man to ever hold office.
Obama was president for nearly a decade....no ones guns or 2A rights were taken away.  So hey Trump, stop lying for the 8 billionth time.
That would be trump spreading fake news of all kind
Trump isn't challenging anyone to a push up contest
This is a really interesting read as we enter the last three months of the current campaign. A little telling that the final excerpt discusses the damage Trump’s ‘fake news’ claims but does not recognize the media outlets’ culpability by opening themselves up to such claims.
Trump + the points = $$$
I would have stuck with just an affirmation of faith rather than an attack, though of course Trump deserves this.
"“Jackson responded with a proclamation in which he called Calhoun’s theory of nullification [of federal laws] a “metaphysical subtlety, in pursuit of an impracticable theory.” Are we sure Trump is "Jacksonian"? Don't see him using "methaphysical", much less "subtlety".
Well there you go.   Trump IS doing it right.
What is their plan to root out rampant racism, transphobia, and homophobia in their party? To bring back the values of individual liberty (like being pro-choice) and fiscal responsibility that were once cornerstones? Neg'ing Trump is fun, but he's just part of the problem.
All Biden had to do was drop out and admit he doesn’t give a shit about anything besides getting trump out of office.
Trump wants kids and people to go back to school and work without appropriate testing but he has everyone that comes near him tested with rapid results. Hypocrite!!!!

Donald Trump is comingling with foreign and domestic actors to negatively affect the 2020 election. Where’s my $10M? I’ll take it in cash or AAPL stock. #GOPCorruptionOverCountry
God laughed and said, "Trump doesn't have a prayer."
Biden will lose for the following reasons:  1) Limited passion for Joe by his base.  Opposite on the Trump side 2) Civil unrest works against Biden and not for him given the Dem views on policing 3) The Debates: Trump should dominate 4) The cognitive issue  5) AA% inc for Trump
To be fair he is definitely against Trump energy.
My favorite Trump campaign attack against Biden is still the one that said "we can't risk electing the oldest president ever elected" even though if Trump won he would also be the oldest president ever elected.   It really encapsulates the overall BS of Trumpism.
"Though it was hardly his intention, no president has caused more Americans to stop denying the existence of racism than Donald Trump." Of course,  can find the potential silver lining.
How is that  claim to be a Christian yet spreads  so many lies on a daily basis. And how is it a travesty for Obama to play golf but not Trump. #GOPCorruptionOverCountry #gop #GOPCorruption #GOPCorruption #gop
Or you vote for Trump? Are you really saying that? I can’t believe it. Please say you won’t.
I hope someone's told Trump. Otherwise, no telling what that stable genius might do.
lol awesome.  you gotta love it.  he’ll be an even funnier president than trump
The only difference between what Trump is saying and those who have courted the evangelical vote is that Trump is not even using code, just saying it out loud.
When is Trump going to be out of spaghetti to throw against the wall???
You really want more trump. I despise this attitude.
On the occasion of Brian Hook's departure from the State Department, this may be my favorite scene that I have personally witnessed during the Trump years.
Lol yet you strangely never see president Trump say things like he’s Michael Scott from The Office like this even though the libertards accuse him of it so heatedly
Maybe Trump should stop testing people who are about to meet with him, because it results in more cases.
The money I’m referring to goes back to the 63 million doses of hydroxychloroquine (plus additional 2 million doses of chloroquine) stockpiled by the govt. before the FDA rightly revoked. This idiot move was inspired by Trump who you insinuate is in the right? Beyond laughable.
Trump said they should move it over to Texas 🇺🇸👊🏼
I'm not denying that this is a great thing. I'm just worried that, because of the timing, it'll help Trump get re-elected. I'm wondering why she did it now instead of after the election.
4/ “...Hybrid/Partial”—falls right in the middle, at 44%” [on average in county who voted for Trump in 2016]

Trump said it was a bomb...then played it off
The Founding Fathers must have assumed that whoever became president would have at least a morsel of integrity. Trump has proven them to be sadly mistaken in that assumption.
I can not stand trump.. and then I see this and I’m like bruhhh. Why??? Just shushhh. DNC really pushed this guy over Bernie?
I disagree. His BASE were always coming out, but there are a lot of Republicans who voted for Trump in 2016 but aren't motivated now. Things like this could motivate them.
One really must read between the lines here to learn anything about trafficking. And still.
Someone convince me this will do anything more than bolster Republicans' 2nd Amendment talking point and drive turnout for Trump voters.

It would take a remarkable case officer to convince a source to jeopardize their life by providing sensitive intel that Trump would hand to the Russians.  #TrumpTreason
Both Facebook and Twitter said the post shared by President Trump violated their rules on #COVID19 misinformation.  Such removals are rare, because Facebook takes a largely hands-off approach to posts from political figures.
Always with the Hillary... 🙄 Also, the video of him sitting with Obama is not flattering to Trump. He looks deranged.
Reason #1,000,001 to remove the lying, divisive, racist, incompetent, sexist, lunatic of a president who is Trump. Cannot wait for  and his VP to re-establish decency and respect in the WH.
Keep drinking the Blue Kool-aid.  You'll spend the rest of your life in chains. Trump has done a lot. MSM will not cover.

On the contrary, the Facebook audience is surprisingly a huge Trump/MAGA audience. The top 10 advertisers on Facebook are all Trump/Fox News/Breibart related. And yes right-wing nationalist media has exploited fake new stories that would never appear in a respectable newspaper.
Lol, now GOP’ers are suddenly becoming budget hawks again as an election is coming. Seems like just yesterday they were slashing corporate taxes (that never paid for themselves btw) and ballooning the deficit for Trump. Couldn’t GOP even balance the budget BEFORE covid existed.

Watch the full "Axios on HBO" interview with President Trump - Axios  The best way to make the president look incompetent and foolish is, apparently, to ask simple follow-up questions.
From the very beginning, Trump politicized this by calling it a Democratic hoax. Trump’s followers seized on that, like trained attack dogs who will rip out the throat of anyone who threatens their master. This is all on Trump. #TrumpVirus

Exactly. I don’t “like” Nixon or agree with him politically. But he’s a fascinating character. Shakespearean is exactly the right word. He’s Richard III. You can’t help but feel for him, even as you long to see him fall. Trump is Malvolio, on a good day.
If elected president, Joe Biden said he would not tear down the parts of the barrier along the U.S.-Mexico border built by Trump's administration. But he would end construction.  "There will not be another foot of wall constructed on my administration."

Yates has more integrity, talent, knowledge and patriotism than Trump will ever have. She bested the Senate Judiciary committee. The Republicans just wanted to air all their conspiracy theories not the truth.
Trump and over 20,000 lies or falsehoods. He’s the boy who cries wolf.
It's not that Trump doesn't know right from wrong. It's much worse than that. Trump bases all his decisions on what he thinks will benefit him. Sadly, whether something is right or wrong doesn't impact his calculations at all.
That was the first question that popped into my head, but then I realized that with Trump, it really doesn't matter. Trump does what he pleases and could care less whether or not it's legal, ethical or moral.
Trump’s mastery hasn’t seemed to filter down to the rank and file here and we are lucky.  You can’t teach it — the dude is a born poster.  But his son  seems to have learned the art of Twitter fairly well too.  It’s a threat to us
Trump rules us precisely because he knows exactly how to use social media.  Though he is certainly not the poster he once was, i’ll grant you that

I'm not sure how much to credit this piece, but they say that the campaign's "case for Rice" is that she'll ensure the enthusiastic support of the Obamas. Like Barack and Michelle are gonna sit on their hands and let Trump win regardless of Biden's running mate. Much less Harris.
OMG. This is the best. Trump interviewing himself is priceless.

so you caught him being honest, its you and your ilk that needs to be ashamed and embarrassed, not Trump
I’m not sure. It certainly will be a debacle, of Trump lying, name calling and ridiculous comments and claims of how great a job he’s done, greatest job EVER. But he’ll probably still claim he won the debate and did a great job no matter how much of a crash and burn it is.
Our trump economy is already crippled
Trump claiming this whole thing about pre-existing conditions, and claiming its never been done, is total BS because it already exists under ACA. But unfortunately the majority of Trumpers dont know that and think this is brand new from Trump.   🤦🏼‍♂️ We are doomed 864511320
He is just being abused by GOP at this point in hopes that some of his fans will vote for him..and he grifted some money during Trump's PPP money laundering scheme and cant get out of it..he is in visible distress..
Trump is going to cheat in many ways but this overplaying his black friend card isn't cutting it..He is abusing a person obviously in extreme distress psychologically who can't stop crying and asking for help..democrats aren't going to vote for him but we should all pray for him.
Also since you have NRA in your profile, your organization is a money laundering firm that exploits girls with donation money from gullible people it brainwashes..all the best trying not to become the next trump business..banned for life..
Dude humans suck so much. My work has been insane (I live in a Trump-loving "The virus isnt real" kinda town) and no one will follow rules. I get screamed at for enforcing or even just stating the rules. Sorry you dealt with this, I know how it feels
I’m just still shocked at this- he was a constant  had a baby got banned &amp; now what?!? I even ordered Trump bands off his website smh 🤷‍♀️
Perfect example of Trump's focus with over 160,000 dead, no jobs, losing healthcare, kids w/no school, Russia attacking us while he vacations with rich WM! Disgusting! Perfect visual for TV ad.
I wish blue states could just prevent their citizens from bailing out racists etc..find out who voted for trump in 2020 from Alabama and Arkansas and other 3rd world red states.Rescue the liberals and leave the rest to their own devices and let personal responsibility play out..
He does..We all do..30% of America is irredeemable..The rest value our journalists and scientists and doctors and others that expose trump for the conman he is..even trump university kids sued the heck out of donnie to get their settlement..when will you folks wake up?
Newsflash! Obama covered the a decade ago . Trump is trying to kill the affordable care act in court now... Contuining compaing for us to be live up is down right is left and don’t believe anyone but Trump. Fortunately the overwhelming percentage is Americans know the facts
In such times, remember you're not crazy..this started with trump's first press secretary announcing to the press that  "his was the largest inauguration crowd in the history of America..PERIOD " You're not crazy..trump is a con artist..They don't do well with straight questions.
Such a transparent desperate scam by trump, they assure voters are really stupid
And it will never happen.  Trump may get fined, or have to surrender assets, but he will never be incarcerated.
Let me understand. Is your goal here to raise money to help with Covid knowing that trump will not do anything that may benefit any other person on earth, especially Obama?
Trump hasn’t ever had an original thought or action. He’s not a human being. Husk of a man. No soul.
*Role model That's how we spell it in USA..Also, tell your russian troll farm people that everyone in America knows who trump is and and who his daddy was..where he got his money from to bankrupt himself to be bailed out by russian black money and now american tax payer money..
For the economy, everybody know that Trump was against locking down and the horizontal approach for quarentine, but was pushed by the "health experts" to do it, and here we are. Now dems "discovered" that closing schools will hurt the economy, and are pushing to reopen it...
I can't believe I have to say this but, now do Donald Trump.  Parler bot
IS enough in the Mueller report (as stated by Mueller himself, if you read it), for Trump to be CHARGED WITH OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE WHEN HE LEAVES OFFICE. He's also very likely going to be charged, when he leaves office, for hundreds of violations of the Amoluments Clause of the
Thanks Obama for actually doing this years ago. Because, you know, I have a pre-existing condition and the GOP &amp; Trump really do not give two f’s about anyone but their donor base (and if they die before the election from a pre-existing condition, they’ll count their vote).
Agreement here it’s worth has withstood all Challenges  leave it in place even if we call dog shit  or even Trump care Doesn’t change its value
Me talking about covid, Trump being a dumb cunt, stupid conservatives, antivaxxers, antimaskers, and anything that is fucked up
The Trump Admin is trying to suggest that China/Iran pose an equal threat to our elections as Russia does: THEY DONT...and they all know it.Every bit of evidence given to Congress supports that.
Notice the difference, Republicans? The US Gov is saying China "prefers" that Trump doesn't win re-election &amp; that Iran seeks to "undermine" President Trump. But even Trump's own Govt. isnt claiming they are ACTIVELY "denigrating" Trump like Russia is currently doin to Biden.
This is amazing. I’d trust one of those goats as president more than I trust trump.
Now tell me. How many had recovered from it? Why dems were calling Trump as xenophic when we wanted to ban travel to US? All these lost lives are in China, dems, and WHO’s backs. Trump filled the hospitals with ventilators in record time. You know it.
Goddess for trump, GTFO.
Hearing from multiple sources that Trump will be signing an executive order tomorrow requiring seat belts installed in all new cars going forward.
If that's not authoritarianism, I dont know why I oppose trump's tactics..everyone thinks their ideas are the best..you think libertarians wouldn't love to shutdown everything for a week and announce 0 taxes for all..or #2A people lock up everyone and have machine guns for all..
Just keep lying all the time #trump #TrumpLiesEverytimeHeSpeaks
The affordable care act which was politicized to be known as Obama care act in deivisive press releases was and is needed and necessary  .Lets agree to call it Trump care or whatever and move on (press challenge?)👀
Watching  on which  states Trump’s been successful in life with use of the “Power of Positive Thinking.” How many bankruptcies? Trump U? Trump Foundation? Has he chosen to ignore  assessment of Trump’s life?
Having a hard time thinking Pompeo did anything useful for anyone other than Pompeo, except maybe Trump.  Of course Trump is about to become a has been and Pompeo needs to build some fast credit towards what comes next.
Everything trump touches dies!!!
I never said a damn thing about Trump. I stated why I thought Obamacare is crap. Doesn’t mean I hated Obama. You don’t have to like everything a President does.
Right. I'm voting for Trump too. I think people misunderstand my anti-Swamp comment to mean that I'm a liberal. When I'm actually one of the most hard-core conservatives that you'd ever meet.
I dont know..i like all the ideas but I would love to see the ones with a payment plan..we could become sweden but take a poll..how many Americans are ready to give 50%+ of their paycheck to the government..especially US government which trump Jr could lead one day?

Trump's thoughts on executive orders:
This is why I love Trump
Trump's thoughts on executive orders:
Trump alone can fix it. By giving a payroll tax break to people who do not have jobs.
Dejoy, the trump donor dismantling the US Postal Service, lives in Greensboro. He sits on the board of Elon University. I think we need to start calling his places of business and asking where our mail is.
Trump supporters still trying to figure out which version of their dear leader to support..the one suing to take away protections for pre-existing or the one selling it as his own healthcare plan..They'll just go beat their wives and write hate messages on a BLM mural instead..
So wait, we're off masks now,   That didn't last long.  Guess you realized your base isn't really the "decent human being" type.
Will they be called trump enablers? Lol
I don't care if 50 percent of white Americans are voting for him.  They're wrong.    #WhiteAmericansAgainstTrump
Trump really dude
At this point it's unfair Trump hasn't gotten the virus.
Guys, GUYS, it's bad to "think like a woman" or something, says the Trump boot licker.
He was responding to a question about a test he didn’t feel he needed to take just because Trump felt he needed to take one and was making that point by asking the interviewer. It’s like the old “when did you stop beating your wife?” question. The question is an accusation.
Let me spell it out for you, Sparky, since you're too thick and too wrapped up in "MUH FIGHT" to understand.  Your argument in favor of Trump comes down to "men sometimes have to fight".  Guess what?  Most women don't think like that, and they vote in higher proportion than men.
I’ll take “The only Shithole President the US has Ever had” Jeff. And that would be Donald John Trump for $1,000 or is it several trillion now???

How Donald Trump Shifted Kids-Cancer Charity Money Into His Business   #SaveTheChildren
As a North Carolinian, I think that's a great idea. Let's have Jonathan Swan be the moderator. He and Trump already know each other.
Guys, GUYS - Trump's going to win without the women's vote.
That's not an argument.  And there was no winning in 2016.  Whichever shit sandwich won, there would still be a shit sandwich as POTUS.  Same in 2020, other than Trump has proven how inept we said he'd be.
I vacation at Myrtle beach solely for the Trump kitsch and paraphernalia. (These also look like Chris Farley)
If NFL owners had only green lighted Trump’s purchase of the Buffalo Bills years ago, we would have never had this shit in our hands.  Very similar to W realizing that he wouldn’t be MLB commissioner.
I remember when I wrote that “silent trump protestor” Medium piece back in Nov 2016, you tweeted it out every day for weeks (maybe months). So you’ve always been one of the cool kids to me! 😎

I’m forever grateful that Trump led the troops across the Delaware River (with Jesus) to write the Constitution and kill bin Laden after 9/11.  Hail Trump!  Oh, I almost forgot that he invented ice cream.
Donald Trump has enough evil on his own. In my opinion he makes his own party look bad. Whether Democrat or Republican, America does not need four more years of this egotistical, divisive, wannabe dictator. Ship him to his friends Putin and Kim. His kind!
Now they're free to testify to the current criminal activity Trump's Billionaire Donor is doing to obstruct the US Mail and criminal acts to obstruct an election! It would be great if we actually had a Republican Senate willing to do their job.
I gave up all hope when Trump cult turned anti maskers overnight..its amazing how the last 4 years have played out..the first day I became certain we were in for a rough ride was when this happened.
I have been to Thailand, and my parents had a Thai exchange student for a year, and I've never once heard someone cal it "Thighland" until Trump. You should probably look for another theory since this one can be disproven in a single tweet.
Yes..ask trump to sign an EO to reverse civil rights and voting rights for women and black people..that will satisfy your hate..
Neither did Trump.
This is true but just don’t be a trump supporter😂😂😂
Trump is worse than Nixon..and if you were true trump cult you would compare him to Lincoln..Reagan left with a booming economy after his term, Clinton after his term, Obama after his term..Vote for a reality show conman and complain to the world about how truth is the enemy..
I think there are more pictures of trump with them than there are of Bill Clinton. Beside no one worshiped Bill Clinton like trump. It’s very strange
There is no Christianity in Trump's campaign. If you see some you either don't understand the religion or are delusional.
Trump claims to be perfect and literally banned women fleeing forced abortions in China.
Trump claiming "This has never been done before", of him signing a bullshit Exec Order to make Insurers cover pre-existing conditions.Really? **Its being done RIGHT NOW. Obamacare was the FIRST law EVER to require Ins. Companies to do that**Sorry Princess, Obama got there first.
Uhhhh..........that isn't "major", you idiot: THAT'S OBAMACARE. Its already the law.......you know, the law that Trump is currently in court, right now, attempting to overturn? What bullshit will the GOP come up with next?
Trump is a symptom..he is not the disease..and after going through these 4 years, I have almost given up hope..The country needs some hope..Biden is only half of that hope..we'll still be suffering for decades with the disease..
Trump and his deplorables are disgusting
Did Trump get a new weave?
"Well, you'll have to ask the President that".......and that will be that. Right in front of us Donald Trump will have hobbled the Postal Service, slowing the reciept of mail in ballots to a snail pace.
it's political because he keeps asking for a federal bailout and Medicaid expansion. It's political because he blames R legislature for not already giving more unemployment. It's political because he blames Trump for not having some straw man national strategy.
At least 6 Republican operatives, some tied to Trump camp, working to get Kanye West on the 2020 ballot.   They’re taking advantage of his mental illness!
I hate trump supporters
Thank GOD for President Trump!
But America no longer is the symbol for ordinary people to succeed - only the elite like trump and friends.
Love them both ...Trump 2020
Hey..this EO is the best healthcare plan trump or GOP have ever come up with..atleast now trump cult can't argue that protecting people with pre-existing conditions is a socialist conspiracy..
I agree with much of what you sat#y, but you’re just wrong on this. Your own opinion of Trump is blinding you.
Trump teased an executive order to require health insurers to cover all preexisting conditions, something already established under the Affordable Care Act, which his administration is suing to dismantle.
I literally can't deal with these fucktard Trumpers praising Trump for an EO covering pre-existing conditions. The greatest President in my lifetime already did that for us with ACA. These people are fucking delusional.
Oh, he is. Trump likes guys like Jerry. Birds of a feather. + Evangelicals will largely still support Jerry.
Pre-existing condition protection is part of the Affordable Care Act.  This isn't the first time Trump has claimed to do something Obama already did.  Trump still takes credit for the Veterans Choice Program which was also an Obama program.
This is already a thing from the ACA! You know the law trump has been railing against his entire presidency lol. Like come on
Before spreading fake news about biden,  let's settle why Hillary isn't dead yet based on the con donnie pulled on you in 2016..You're not allowed to lie about 2020 before donnie explains his 2016 con..
Really? I think Trump said it because that's exactly what you kindergartens are!
Trump is trying to Kill all Americans...
Trump can sue in courts to take away women's voting rights and then sign an EO saying women are allowed to sit around a polling booth and his supporters will be cheering yayy..women's rights..that's what this is..
Aww..you got conned by donnie too..he needs supoorters like you to think an EO to cover a thing that's already law is a heathcare plan..just like veterans choice was Obama's law, just like the economy was Obama's economy before trump ran it down or Obama's pandemic team he fired.
Absolutely! If Trump refuses to leave then "We the People" will March on Washington and remove his ass! 😡

Trump officials recommend executive action as stimulus talks break down  #FoxBusiness TRUMP READY TO GIVE MONEY TO THOSE IN NEED DEMOCRATS HELL NO NOT YET
But it’s actual Trump’s America. 🙄
I have already decided that I am going to be as careful as I can be. Wear my mask, get rubber gloves carry my hand sanitizer and vote in person. Trump* and his minions are trying to destroy America. Voting for Biden and all Democrats on  Nov 3.  I am not taking a chance.
And speaking of “hate”...  Pelosi also chided James Rosen during the Trump impeachment for asking if she hated Trump, and she angrily lectured him on her being Catholic and hating no one. Then video surfaced of her accusing Republicans of hating Clinton during his impeachment.
So Trump issued an Executive Order that does something Obamacare already does?  Cool. Why not an Executive Order renaming the first planet from yje Sun "Mercury?"  We can have one of the "major" announcements daily.
Umm..no..we can expect to see talent appreciated..look at what trump has done to people like Faucci, vindman, all of our FBI, so many IGs etc etc..
Good on AOC for having a policy! And believing in a cleaner future. What does Trump believe in?!? Dirty stinking oil money. That’s it.
Why hasn't Trump signed an executive order to make the coronavirus disappear? What is he waiting for?
Trump 2020 baby💪🏼🇺🇸🙏
I think that is kinda the point with Trump*. He isn't saying he is cutting Social Security .. but this will do it.
Lol..obama kicked them out of G7 after their Ukraine antics..sanctioned the hell out of them for the election meddling..kicked china over the south china sea..kept them out of Hong Kong..Trump reversed all of that..crimea gone..south china sea, Hong Kong gone..smell the coffee..
Trump’s  Crusade Makes US Censorship Look a Lot Like China’s
Do not blame the President for this, our Congress can't get their crap together. We need another George Washington to come in and willingly re-limit the executive powers. Trump or Biden are certainly not that guy. Better luck next time around. We need to breed better leaders.
China owns America under trump..they got Hong Kong and got massive deals with US by hurting our farmers and consumers with the trade war and the tarriffs we paid added deficit at double the speed of any admin..you know who buys all US debt bonds..Go figure..
Did you hear the boooes to the MSM? 😂🤣 Epic! &amp; Then the people cheering &amp; clapping at Trump about his "peaceful protests"
Trump is a piece of shit. That is all.
Does this mean the Trump campaign now has to cover the expenses for this event?
America and all of the world would love a Biden administration..As long as Biden doesn't solicit support or extort foreign governments for help in getting elected by hacking emails, pushing fake stories and propaganda etc etc, I think we can still save our democracy from Trump..
Oh like trump does anything but tweet all day..though I’m sure he’s so lazy enough he get one of grandkids to do it.
Well as long as Biden doesn't solicit their support and ask them to hack trump emails and spread fake news through their intelligence etc etc, Biden is fine..
Trump holds news conference from NJ golf club: WATCH LIVE
Trump is an excellent President.
Wow, sir. Trump promised to repeal and replace Obamacare but now he's signing an executive order to reinforce Obamacare. This is huge!
Best argument for Trump in 2 1/2 minutes, do you your fact checking, you can't dispute it
Reading a translated article by Chinese intellectual named Jiang Shigong, and I realized liberalism, centered around America, has failed. Western world has been led to decadence, nihilism, inequality, political decline, as evidenced by the rise of this celebrity strongman, Trump
We have this. It's called Obamacare and Trump has been trying to get rid of it since he took office
away"? Honestly, Kellyann, the discussions at your breakfast table w/your husband George, who despises Trump &amp; is part of Project Lincoln, must be legendary.
each day that passes, another vote against you.  If you showed the same energy that you used to ban tik tok used on dealing with the trump virus you would get a 2nd term.  thoughts and prayers
Yep. Open the schools &amp; then get a 'spike" in cases, esp. teachers. Then they blame Trump for putting teachers &amp; students at risk, &amp; lock everything down again in late October. Surprise!
Oh, but wait, Don! Dont u remember that Trump (who was always prochoice, btw) suddenly became Pro-Life.....while at the same time bringing back the Federal Death Penalty? Trump is what white evangelicals (en masse,anyway) are made flesh: COMPLETE AND UTTER HYPOCRISY.
Trump's dementia is progressing.
Remember this day as the beginning of the poll's making a big shift. Media today: Blaming Dem's per #GOP talking points for no stimulus, telling public Dem's are the problem but Trump will do EO's to save the country. MSM saying a country not wanting Trump to win = to Russian GRU
Hey  can you explain how Trump is actually right about the virus disappearing?
anyway. Good Lord, people wake up.Millions upon millions of ppl just lost their health insurance that left w/their jobs....and Trump is, RIGHT NOW, in court trying to overturn Obamacare.....with NO PLAN to replace it.Which means, somewhere around 45 million ppl now, will lose
Dear Republicans: Pls do us all a favor &amp; educate  u even know what the payroll tax Trump is wanting to cut IS? IT CUTS SOCIAL SECURITY &amp; MEDICARE! That's exactly what the "payroll tax"  have to have a job to get any payroll tax
This world really says fuck a pedi because they don’t want trump back y’all sad asf
I bought on this a while back when Trump was at 31% and thought it was a steal then.  But, I should have bought way more.  So, heck will now even at 20%.
When we eradicate the tRump Virus, we can begin to build our economy without killing more Americans, killing our nurses and doctors and our children, thiet parents and Grands.  Until then, fvk over.
I think they are the nouveau riche. People who think that Trump* is the people's idea of a rich man. He is a want-to-be popular man. He has been propped up his entire life. Who the hell bankrupts a Casino? GEEZ the bank always wins. And Mark Burnett created the apprentice myth.
Facebook removes troll farm posing as African-American support for Donald Trump  via
Couldn't agree more!!!
Prediction: they open schools &amp; then have a big "spike" in cases, esp. teachers. Then they lock everything down again in late October &amp; blame Trump for putting teachers &amp; students at risk. Surprise!
I think the game plan is: open schools then have a big "spike" in cases, esp. teachers. Then they call for another lockdown in late October &amp; blame Trump for putting teachers &amp; children at risk. Surprise!
Why can't people realize that you can criticize both Western AND non-Western countries and still vote against Trump? It's possible! I promise!
Four decades ago, Biden wasn't in favor of segregation, he opposed bussing as an effective way to integrate schools. Now - the comment about not being black if you vote for Trump - just highly inappropriate.
should be maxed out in the $$ actual betting markets that are giving Trump 1/5 chance of winning pop vote. Are you? If not, does your employer prevent you from doing that?
Which Trump can’t do by Executive Order
Testing. Trump press. Testing 123.
well, I dunno,  I can get Trump at 21% to win pop vote.
I think twitter and Facebook have led to the destruction of our democracy more than any foreign government ever will..they dont understand their own platform..look at this from yesterday..as if it's difficult to open new accounts for the farms..
If only Yoh-Semite was located somewhere in the continental United States and Thigh-land wasn’t a country.  I think Biden and Jo can walk down a ramp and drink water from a glass. Neither one takes a bath in a mix Yellow #5 or Red #3.  Did you use Trump’s bible for your oath?
THE MORE INSANITY THE MORE VOTES FOR TRUMP!  "WE THE PEOPLE" want Jobs Not Mobs! "We" want Legislators not Agitators! "We" want Educators not Indoctrinators! "We" want Journalists not Propagandists!  "We" want Workers not Freeloaders! "We" want Flag Wavers not Flag Desecrators!
No one should vote in 2020 if Biden ever does what trump is doing to cheat at an election..the day biden says somethung like Iran please steal or hack or sabotage trump campaign or spread fake news and hire trolls and bots etc..That'll be time to jump ship to Kanye..
Hope Biden doesn't go the trump way of begging them to steal emails and spread lies etc with lackies chatting with Iran or china intelligence fronts etc..that would be the end of democracy..I hope Joe is better than trump..will not vote in 2020 if Joe does what trump has done..
I'd really have to think on that one! But I'd NEVER vote for Trump. #TrumpFailedAmerica
And more than likely to his face.  He just doesn’t understand their responses and the translator sure as heck isn’t going to tell Trump they just called him a stain on the fabric of humanity.
I don't think anyone would encourage and solicit china or Iran's help to hack into trump's emails and leak them through their intelligence selectively etc..if Biden does anything like that, we will have a problem with him too..we can't all be playing games with our democracy..
Trump’s holding a press conference yet I don’t see any press covering it?
News conference on the Trump virus - through his lack of leadership and intelligence Trump will kill 100s of thousands citizens. On the economy as a bumbling moron Trump will shrink the gdp to a -40% in 2020. But we’re golfing again this weekend.
This guy makes great remixes Trump "It is what it is"...
So much for more freedom to do business.  Trump issues executive orders against TikTok and WeChat  via    #DonaldTrump #TikTok #SocialMedia
I dont see Joe begging them to hack anyone or to do anything to influence anyone..rest of the world can all hope for trump to lose..america is hoping with them..what's wrong would be for anyone encouraging them to meddle in our elections instead of sanctioning them..
I will be discussing the tRump virus with real Americans as we ignore your usual lies.   Try to speak English for once.
Trump consistently bashes Biden and Democrats during official White House events though.
Russia is trying to ‘denigrate’ Biden while China prefers ‘unpredictable’ Trump not be reelected, senior U.S. intelligence official says
Like I said, you want Trump to win.
The Debate Over Trump 'Ban' of TikTok, WeChat
Paul Krugman says he’s done the math — and the risk Trump and McConnell pose to the economy is ‘terrifying’
Let me be clear, this won’t be the downfall of Jerry Falwell Jr more than likely this will be the rising. If by some miracle he doesn’t get his job at Liberty University back he’s posed for politics related positions. Trump’s not gonna leave him hanging.
Thank you for all the information. We all need to pray for the safety of President Trump!! God bless 🙏
I understand medicare for all is a hot topic for a lot of single issue voters..I hope you are ready to move to Canada or Mexico with a lot of other single issue voters on supreme court judges, abortion rights, civil rights, climate change, DACA kids, min wage etc when trump wins.
Trump is a clown 🤡
Let's just call it what we know it will be: a Trump campaign speech.
how about you realize there are only two candidates who can win. Biden or Trump.  Anyone who doesn't vote for Biden, actually WANTS Trump to win.
tRump. The biggest asshole POTUS ever. What a high mountain to climb after Andrew Johnson and Andrew Jackson. Formerly, biggest bigots in WH.
I didn’t expect Donald Trump to care about the lives of his supporters, but I gotta say—I kinda thought his supporters would have.  That’s some strong MAGA cult pandemic kool-aid.
No that's not how secret police work. This really is perfect bec it illustrates perfectly that vision of control &amp; power tRump voters think they're giving themselves when they vote for him. This is the whole point-tRumpers want status in a fascist regime &amp; they show us this daily
Duhhhhh another tweet not from you! Trump 2020
How does Trump know what Pelosi/Schumer want? Trump has not attended any negotiation meetings (to busy golfing and trying to get a rally going). When will Trump take responsibility and do his job (oh, I forgot, he "takes no responsibility")
Trump Derangement Syndrome is thinking that every bad thing that happens is a conspiracy to bring down Trump.
Trump is throwing everything at the sink, all at once.
Great. My wife is still laid off. Take your time on the stimulus and unemployment. This virus is about wrapped up... ...said no one except trump
I love this genre of tweet showing things happening in Trump's America and saying it will happen if Biden is President 😂🤣
So we agree trump was lying in 2016 and spreading fake conspiracy theories..what makes you think you got conned in 2016 but you are not being conned this time?
No, it is not.  And I think it's safe to say that Trump did NOT make America great again.  Although the reality is, America was already pretty great before Trump took office. 😑
I think Trump has gone overboard on the culture war stuff this time around and he doesn't have an opponent so readily willing to lean in on the other side of it.
Aren't you all still waiting for hillary to die from your 2016 conspiracy theories? Stick with her before starting new conspiracy theories about biden..
if you have a child send them to school and let's see if trump cares if he/she gets sick or not, I bet he doesn't
We do care. 150k dead and counting and Trump says “It is what it is.” Caring would help.
What I mean is....he has disrupted the plans of Satan and the deep state.  I often use this term for people struggling to see how a guy like Trump could be used by God.  It’s a way to put it that no one can argue with.
73% done with Too Much and Never Enough, by Mary L. Trump
Thom Tillis- when will you talk about real corruption instead of a HOAX against Cal Cunningham?  You are an alligator in the tRump swamp who needs to resign.
I think this is a consequence of a heavy push from the Trump campaign to play defense with lots of ad spending in states that... don't help him.
There is a seep problem in the American Protestant Church in the era of Trump. There needs to a reckoning
Nothing has helped you except your own Stockholm syndrome..you know you have been conned but you don't want to admit..atleast the trump University students woke up and sued to get their money back..He has found an even more gullible group to con who won't even ask for damages..
When the bank forecloses on your home, they don't ask if you voted democrat or republican.  When the sheriff comes to the door with an eviction notice, they don't ask if you are a Trump supporter or not.  Nobody is immune to this.
Lots of users, blue checked, Trump supporters under same circumstances
People are lining up at food banks and Trump is golfing.

You should give the money to Texas, Fl and Ga the poorly run Republican states....... ok just keep for yourself and your poorly run Trump Properties
Add EU, Australia, Canada and rest of the world to the list..Trump is an existential threat to the whole planet..most of the planet doesn't want a world War 3 except russia which wants to capture Europe..

Trump First President to have church services at the White house.Praise &amp; Worship before meetings. Report the real facts.Not this fake news.Obama was a Muslim a hater of christians this was his advisor?
Are you kidding me right now? The reason people are out of work is because of the lockdowns, which #Trump has been encouraging the states to end. How the hell is any of this Trump's fault?
Trump/Barr have become all three Branches of Gov’t. Think that is tantamount to a dictatorship
Maybe tell him he looks like Trump?
OMG no way! I can’t believe that- he got suspended all the time because he was so opinionated- pro Trump - then got banned. What happens to him?!?
Yes he is!!!! Trump in 2020! 🇺🇸❤️🇺🇸

U.S. Intelligence: China Opposes Trump Reelection; Russia Works Against Biden
Someone on Twitter suggested he go to a small country in Africa that starts with N and ends in r...not sure how tRump might mispronounce it.
Wrong. Up to 50% of people may have some form of immunity to it through T-Cells.   Maybe do some independent research so you can formulate a unique and well educated opinion rather than parroting "Trump bad" at everyone who has done so for themselves.
There was a significant GOP mailer that went out promoting mail-ins here recently.  I expect Rs to close the gap some, but yes, Trump's rhetoric on ABM's has hurt them.
He just didn't wanna meet Trump.  Imagine taking advantage of a killer pandemic to do that.
NOT TRUE. Russia is WAY ahead of China/Iran in their influence of US (and other countries) elections.Everyone knows  Biden isnt WELCOMING help from China/Iran, while Trump has already welcomed Russia's help, even assisting them.
The big difference here is that neither China nor Iran have even a fraction of the influence campaign that Russia have developed: no where near  Biden isnt WELCOMING help from China/Iran.Trump already has and  the Mueller report!
Trump has been very confrontational with Russia for several years now. Why would Russia prefer Biden? China I get. They've already paid the family off. And, Iran would do almost anything to get rid of Trump. This report is pure bullshit.
You do realize that Ivanka Trump got MILLIONS in patents from China when she went on the Presidential visit there last year right, you hypocrite? Hunter Biden didn't work for the Administration........really not the same thing.
Mushroom Cloud was another clue, Trump even said it look like an attack... Think what you like bro it's not a big deal either way
Ugh, sigh, we just can't seem to do anything anymore. Not even when it really, really matters.  ... Coronavirus stimulus talks fall apart in 'disappointing' meeting between Democrats, White House ...
Trump absolutely must immediately agree to Dem compromise (which is best option) or do an immediate #ExecutiveOrder. I vote Dem, but am worried  will pull BS &amp; take  to court to stop #unemploymentextension. It'll waste more time #WeThePeople don't have!
"But Trump" is so tiresome.
President Trump: "You won't see me for awhile."
We already know Donald McGahn destroyed the Supreme Court. We already know he skirted the law working for Trump* . Yes .. I would like to see him testify before the House, but we know he is no Alexander Vindman.  McGahn didn't risk all for his country. He did it for his party.
Biden is done.  Wait for the first debate.  Trump will get under his skin and totally get him off the teleprompter.  It will be for great comedy
You all are so full of hate it is sad. Donald Trump is waking up America. Your bullshit Will not fly here. God Bless Donald Trump ✝️🙏
You are a laughing stock.  I can’t wait to find out what trump has been holding over your head all these years.  It’ll be the cherry on top of the huge embarrassment you’re going to suffer at the hands of
The neighbor down the street from me put up this sign.  It made me so happy. Especially since their house is across the street from some Franklin Graham/Trump lovers.
“He’s following the radical left agenda, take away your guns, destroy your 2nd Amendment, no religion, no anything, hurt the Bible, hurt God. He’s against God." President Donald Trump #TrumpIsANationalDisgrace  #TrumpIsNotWell #TrumpIsALaughingStock #trumpisaconman
I think you are so wrong! I know he will get re-elected because the country IS waking up. God Bless Donald Trump for standing up for me.  ✝️🙏
But tRump has a block the vote strategy.
Will Trump have his health plan ready to discuss?  He's really tardy.
Yeah, to put it in the pointed language you would use (although I don't presume to know your beliefs), a big example is Trump...who is a bigoted jackass &amp; much of his Administration is a pack of clowns. Luckily his approval is around 38%...Which is the Math that truly matters.
I don’t believe this, he is a liar just like tRump &amp; is using his position for personal use just like tRump.
A normal President would publicly tell Putin to stay the f out of our elections, but as we know, Trump appreciates the assistance.
Everyone should vote NOW.  Biden has already agreed to the debate schedule and Trump has not. Biden released his tax returns. Do you think Trump will release his tax returns before this debate?  Lots of people are saying Trump and Deutche Bank are under criminal investigation.
Yes who would have thought trump could trash the Obama economy this badly. Over 10% unemployment.  Thousands dying in a pandemic trump ignores. Yes that exceeded all good expectations
Coronavirus stimulus updates: Relief bill stalls, Trump mulls executive order
He really meant "pitied again", you know. Just another Trump misspeak.
Sugar, It will be ok. You’ll have 4 more years of Trump Derangement Syndrome. If you truly desire communism/Marxism/socialism ..Cuba and Venezuela have some space for you Dembot.
Please don’t vote green in 2020. I love their platform but we need every vote we can get to go to Biden so we can prevent Trump from being re-elected. At this point, as much as I hate to say it, it really is the lesser of two evils. #SettleForBiden
"Republican Senate candidates in swing states are going to need to emphasize their own independent contributions to their state.."   "contributions" to NC are blocking Medicaid expansion &amp; gutting unemployment. Tough! #NCSEN #NCPol
Trump is not a choice!  Your meme isn't even close to being scriptural.
Do you think that Trump even knows the scriptures?  Lol
tRump's brazeness has no limits.
Tillis continues his silence on the flagrant abuse and incompetence by this administration.    -  Trump’s continued failure on the pandemic response -  Russians paying Taliban to kill our soldiers - Hatch act violations in the WH rose garden - Cutting CDC access to pandemic data
Trump Suggests Payroll Tax Cut | Analysis of a Payroll Tax Holiday
Sounds kinda like how many people don't like Biden or Trump but they just settle for one of those two anyway.... also terrifying.
Well would ya look-ey there.... the Russians once again trying to take down Trump's opponent to help him out. My blind bird dog saw that one coming.
Facebook blocked several Russian troll farms of people pretending to be black and supporting trump..They won't play fair..be vigilant of people on social media and especially ones with 10 random numbers in their names..
Just think if trump says anything about pebble ..👀
Trump called 4.7% unemployment under Obama "American carnage" but now calls 10.2% unemployment "Great Jobs Numbers!"
Honestly, I don’t get why Trump pronouncing Thailand the way he did is reason to make fun of him. Just listen to how most Americans pronounce ‘Iran’ or ‘Muslims’..By that yardstick, most of you deserved to be mocked.
...and the day I trust Trump to disseminate information....not happening dude
Folks are really out here ripping Biden for this. All the while, Kanye is OPENLY conspiring with the Trump campaign in an attempt to "split the black vote" because they actually believe "black people will vote for the black guy..."
They are both equally dangerous and trump should be held accountable for conspiring with the russians over crimea and the Chinese over hong kong and uyghyr camps..
Trump is still spied on
Trump only has a BS degree in Economics from Wharton, and he's definitely filled with "BS"...
I dont think trump would lose so many times in courts, have all his associates land in prison over corruption and scandals from paranoia..its a criminal enterprise and no one should escape the law no matter if youre the most powerful  person on the planet.that's the American way.
I guess some people feel it is a parallel scripture to draw between Cyrus and Trump.  I see what they are saying, as the Bible is cyclical. I think all is yet to be seen and as always turning to individual prayer for discernment. :)
Trump for weeks: We need to open schools  Dems: He wants to kill kids!  *Cuomo opens schools*  Dems: We need to open schools!
No need to own it when media will blame Trump for making him say stupid shit. Or Google will just suppress the link to his video so no one will find it.
And millions of Americans believe God gave us Trump. Get out there and organize. We need to do the work. God allows us free will. It is up to us.
You vote TRUMP, then you won’t have to worry about it!!
Trump long has relied on nondisclosure deals to prevent criticism. That strategy may be unraveling. - The Washington Post
Landslide 2020!! Go TRUMP!!
I hope Trump chooses you to be the next VP.
Stop it , there is no comparing the two. Trump can get up in front of a crowd and give a two hour speech with no notes. Biden can't even get a sentence out with notes.
Appeals court rules against Trump, says House can sue to enforce McGahn subpoena - The Hill
Another interesting fact.....guess when Israel celebrated their 70th Birthday?  2018.  So lots of Bible numerology around Trump but he is not to be confused with a Savior.
Biden supports legalizing abortions for women that want them. Trump bans women fleeing forced abortions from entering the United States.  I understand many Catholics are upset with the former, but why are you ok with the later.
When you lie so often, every now and then you get you messages crossed-up.  The GOP rails against *cosmopolitan" leftists Dems as out of touch with real America, which is what Trump is supposed to stand for.  So, in defense of Trump, he's now an elitist, too. Go figure.
Trump is chosen as a great disruptor, that is all.  He's not a messiah or savior.   The story of King Cyrus is he was a pagan man, chosen to build up the Kingdom of Persia, and it was Under Cyrus the Hebrews were allowed to return to Israel after 70 years of captivity.
I see your data is not annualized so close to -10% contraction of economy in this quarter..40% number is an yearly projection..imagine being 40% worse than the great depression which still has books written about it..trump had 2 jobs..save lives and save jobs..he did neither..
ha! in light of the whole Deutsche bank records thing, one really gets the feeling that this administration is trying the same tactics Trump used to pull the wool over the eyes of lenders and regulators and realizing, holy sh*t, we're smarter
Lol Trump knows about bankruptcy
At least you're honest. ;-)  The choice is between Trump and Biden. I'll take Biden and see where we are in 4 years instead of Trump continuing to burn down the nation and wipe his arse with the Constitution.
We hope to see you licking the boots of the corrupt administration when you or your loved ones die of the virus and lose their job, employer provided insurance and savings from the million dollar hospital bill as trump organization pumps all our relief money into its businesses.
Leave it to trump suppress to brag about 15% unemployment as a good thing..they had one job on the economy..protect jobs and payrolls..instead they pushed everyone on unemployment and then want to get points for having so many unemployed..failed to protect lives and jobs..
Bezos took more risk because his parents gave him a gigantic loan.   $250k from your parents who likely didn't charge you interest makes a lot of risk go away. Bill Gates' mother connected him to the CEO of IBM. Trump got a $1mil loan. Etc etc etc.
Literally no one cares. Religion is not government. Why do you think Trump is the pope?
Dear AMERICA  REMEMBER HOW TRUMP LIKES TO BRAG HOW GREAT HE IS...  RIGHT. SO.   DON'T YOU THINK IF HE WAS ACTUALLY A BILLIONAIRE HE WOULD BE SHOWING YOU HIS BILLIONS?  HE ISN'T AND HE ISN'T
Y’all just want voters to die if it means putting Biden in who is the same as trump lol
I intend to vote by mail and avoid all lines. But if I have to be in a 12 hr. line to vote Trump out, I'll find a way to make it work.
Dude really...TRUMP HAS NEVER BEEN A BILLIONAIRE...  GET A LIFE!
Trump being Trump. Taking credit for people slowly going back to work as the country slowly re-opens from a pandemic ... to jobs they wouldn't have lost in the first place if he'd been a halfway competent president. It just doesn't get any more petty or self serving than this.
Most Americans &amp; majority of world do not put the words respect and Trump in the same thought.
I bet you believed Hillary was sick and going to die in 2016..well we have been through all of trump's playbooks..we are not gullible like the Trump University students or helpless like the cancer kids he stole money from..get to biden once you're out of conspiracies on Hillary.
"police swept up 7K on a Monday, including many young people just walking on the streets, 5K more over next 2 days.  Nixon to some members of Congress: “I approved this plan."  ..courts found action unconstitutional, awarded detainees millions in damages"
You dont know dementia..If anyone is charged with any crimes and convicted I will believe obamagate. The "hoax" hearings exposed trump completely and no one can deny trump asked a foreign president to dig up dirt and give it to guiliani..protesting is 1st amendment right..
please name one of these million things thing that Trump said today and why you qualify it as horrible and racist.
I'm voting Libertarian, because apparently only Libertarians get three votes this year: a vote for Jorgensen, a vote for Trump, AND a vote for Biden all as t once.
Will you refuse plasma and steroids and remdesivir since doctors say it works and you don't trust doctors? And only take HCQ cause that's what trump prescribes?

You think you can beat down Dr Fauci over mask when he is not the one suggesting masks alone..if he resigns tomorrow, the scientific consensus won't change..your blind loyalty to the trump organization has clouded your judgement..Don, Don Jr, ivanka are not scientists..
“This was a colossal blunder” Andrew Cuomo speaking of Trump and his admin management of the pandemic. Let’s use those words. Brand it for what it is!
if it's all true then i mean... shouldn't everyone be outraged about pedophilia? isn't that a no-brainer? something just seems very weird about it all, and people closer to the right or people that side with trump seem to be the only people concerned with it. i don't understand
Yep. Trump probably thinks "October Surprise" is something he farts out during presidential sweeps week.
"to explore statistical methods of compiling an accurate estimate of noncitizens. It says the aim is to carry out Trump’s mandate to exclude undocumented residents from population totals used to determine how many House seats each state is entitled to."
Trump’s orders say the Chinese-owned apps “threaten the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States.”
Trump only stays at Trump properties and eats more McDonalds than my 17 year old. I am sure he has never even eaten Thighfood.
Shame on you for:  Thinking this Tweeting this Suggesting it Not believing that God is providing them the strength to keep going Or having doubts,  BECAUSE WE ARE WINNING! Now apologize to God, Jesus, and the Holy Spirit for having doubt and Thank them for Trump's determination!
Wait. So we've gone from "Trump is a man of the people" to "Trump is too elite for the majority of Americans to understand."  Ok..whatever. As long as Trump's voted out, I'm happy to be one of the poor ignorant folks just not smart enough to understand the genius of Trump.
It’s not shocking when the royalties for self publishing are high. Even a standard KDP from Amazon could be $10 per copy. It’s more if it’s through other self publishers (80%ish). Allows easy money transfers to Trump from bulk buyers.
Fauci works for federal government..he is paid federal salary and whatever perks come with his job..if you're raising questions about his ethics, maybe you should question how kushner and ivanka made 200 mil dollars last year in federal government.or ask for trump's tax returns..
Did the mayor of Portland really say that the rioters should calm down because they helping Donald Trump?  That’s it?  That the concern? Not the police?  Not the people?  Wow
That’s why I hate those people. “Not voting for Biden is voting for Trump.” No it’s not, both are extremely corrupt: Biden is owned by the oligarchs that run this country and Trump is a wannabe fascist dictator. I want no part of it.
Closer to it than trump!

Too late. #Portland Mayor says continued rioting will help re-elect #Trump in November. Damage is already done...people of all ages and races have seen the destruction and attach it to #Biden and #Democrats lack of concern for public safety. Hard to run away from now
Trump called 4.7% unemployment under Obama "American carnage" but now calls 10.2% unemployment "Great Jobs Numbers!"
The goal is to get trump out of office !!
What price the cost of making America great again Trump ‘s way  $$$
Voting trump out won’t change what America is really all about, also the FDA is banning meds from China that have been proven to help but our authorities got no issue with this
Turn on MSNBC and listen as they cry, "It's Donald Trump's fault!"
Biden is honestly further right than trump, Trump is just more authoritarian.

“It’s heartbreaking…. It’s making my heart hurt,” Stevens said of the 2020 GOP. “One thing the Republican Party stood for was a realistic foreign policy…. From the beginning, Trump has been an apologist for Putin. It’s a disgrace.”  #PutinsGOP
10.2 percent unemployment for the first time since 1983! (Reagan)  Trump’s finally done something that Reagan did!  Huzzah!  (Trump should remind people that Reagan was a Republican because most people don’t know it) 😉 😆😆😆
I’m doing the same. Unfortunately there’s a lot of people who thinks what trump thinks.
Seriously? Ridiculous. If that’s the case you want Trump to win. Full stop
Wow what a man and speaker!! Trump 2020
The only thing Biden has going for him is that he’s not Trump 💀  Buckle up y’all.
Combating all the Trump flags out here 👑
You keep saying this but nothing ever happens to Donald Trump he gets away with everything
It was Trump and his enablers like you who killed 157,000 Americans and cratered the economy. How about y'all sit this one out? #ncpol

With $1,000,000 put up in advance. Otherwise we know Trump wouldn't pay up. Come to think of it, $1,000,000 would only cover 100 lies. Better make it $2,000,000. For each debate.
Trump super spreaders
teachers are like any other citizens that work! They are employees hired to do their job! If they can any longer do their job ,can’t show up to work ,hire someone to do their work!! Like President Trump said send the parents money 💰 and let them be sent to PRIVATE SCHOOLS!!SHAME
Problem would be low turnout..Joe has wide love in the black community and everyone knows his record as VP under Obama..the racist accusations don't mean anything cause everyone knows Joe..trump campaign and racists are not trying to win black vote.They are trying to suppress it.
160,000 people are dead and more are dying... it’s traitor trash trump fault🤦🏽‍♀️
She's certainly not there to provide the DOJ Inspector General function. To a certain extent DOJ assumes the executive branch employees are truthful. Though now there is Supreme Court precedent to assume the Trump admin is lying.(Dept of Commerce et al v. New York)
WTF? So Satan hates Trump too?
You can complain that Biden isn't the most religious person, but compared to Donald Trump...
2016 you wrote someone in and Trump won. You're "100%" against Trump yet are considering a write-in again depending on Biden's VP pick? Nonsense! Liberals respect the Constitution, the rule of law, fiscal responsibility, national security interests, free speech and a free press
This was a really good read. Public opinion on transgender rights has shifted. Social conservatives are an important part of Trump's base but they're a small minority of the country these days.

That and just calling it a hoax. Biden says he will accept nomination in his home state, so Trump comes back and says  He might use the WH. How appropriate. Looking for any advantage even if by association
This is a fair argument. I remember a story going around weeks before Trump started whining about Tik Tok citing how awful the app was for personal data, but...yeah, those problems can be fixed. Trump is just diverting attention from legitimate problems.
Congrats to reporters who are blaming the Dems after Republicans have been absent for 2 months and Trump is on a 3 day golfing trip.
Trump Signs Executive Order That Will Effectively Ban Use Of TikTok In the U.S.
Yo, America can have Biden problems or Trump problems. Your choice. But if that fraudulent pig gets re-elected Biden problems will fit into a teacup compared to the monstrosities Trump has in store “for” America over the next four years.
The POLICE should take these rioters to jail with no bail then send them to prison for 10 years!! CAMPAIGN STRATEGY for liberals for 3 and a half years of going against the President wit things he’s tried to do but TRUMP did it anyway!! LOL 😆!!!
right here? It's alarming how many people just form ideas without doing any sort of prior research. Many people have been so conditioned that "Trump bad" they cannot fathom that anything he's doing is positive.
“I don’t mind talking about President Trump,” Cooper said. “I oppose him when I disagree with him. I will support his actions when they help North Carolina. I always put North Carolina first.”
Amazing how Larry Kudlow and other Trump supporters, who are still employed and receiving an income are commenting and trying to stop the measly $600/Wk  people desperately need to survive during COVID-19.

Exceptional, considering the circumstances. We need President Trump’s leadership for a quick, full recovery.
I really sat in an office for 5 minutes without a mask by accident and everyone probably thought I loved Trump ughhh
they won't after they saw what you did to Trump.  Biden is in worse shape when it's non scripted questions.
Sounds like Trump is talking about himself, except for the part about guns.
Portland mayor ACTUALLY warns rioters that he ADMITS tried to KILL innocent folks that they should stop because it will help Trump in TV ads. INSANE!!!!
We need Trump to tell people to not pay any taxes levied by democrats
Also half the reason Trump wants to ban it is because they ruined his Tulsa rally, and made him cry for the first time if you remember.
I think she was a perfect spokesperson for Bernie. Did you see her on "The Breakfast Club"? I disagree with her about Joe Biden, but ONLY because Trump is killing us by the thousands. ANYONE would be lucky to have her on their team.
He failed to fill stockpile of PPE in three years that he claimed was bare when he entered office, the Trump admin received a 69 page pandemic readiness guide and training they failed to follow from Obama admin...
Seeee trump trying to get our votes 😂 you can send that money you talking about though unk 🥴😂
So again why would Trump again bring up skin color when John Lewis is mentioned??? When Trump says anybody he’s also saying he did more than MLK, Harriett Tubman, Rosa Parks, etc.

Trump says Biden will "hurt God." If anything hurts God, it's a leader who has allowed 160,000 to die without a shred of compassion. It's children taken from the arms of their parents and put into dog kennels. It's someone trying to take away healthcare in a pandemic.  #JesusWept

Avoid the actual points about being better to point the finger at Trump, the Democrat way! Is it possible that both are utterly awful and detrimental to our country?
You're assuming that anyone voting for Trump still may have a shred of morality.  Hard to say at this point.
Lol... this is so outrageous! The man has been faced with nothing but opposition since he took office. It's amazing that he has been able to accomplish the majority of his agenda all the while fighting tooth and nail with radical left to improve our way of life. Trump 2020!

When is last time Trump attended church?
yea. it's contradictory. Trump's ok here b/c it's red state. So,  'pro-Trump' candidate ok while running against him as a party. That's what I hate about est. D's- compromise for no reason. Have a platform - pro labor, jobs, healthcare, infrastructure inv., and don't waiver.
"Leftists," or more accurately "everyone who hasn't drinken the MAGA Kool Aid" aren't the ones engaging in slight of hand shit like this.  Trump's only been around for a few years. Fascists have established a long record of this same activity.
While this may be correct, I feel quite sure this criticism of Trump is in response to his recent rantings about Biden. You know the old saying - pot calling the kettle black. Biden has made word errors and has stuttered thru speeches, however doesn't dis Trump on his gafs.
. attacking  faith shows Trump has no understanding of or interest in Jesus.   Do better, MAGA Christians.
Trump professed to be such a great deal maker. If there was ever a time for deal making and leadership, it is most definitely now.  But where is he? Hiding out at his golf course. He is a complete joke.
Why did Trump make attack ad of Biden praying ???
So, is Durham part of the Deep State then? I thought he was Trump's boy.
Nothing sycophantic about  tweets at all, I can’t wait until trump mispronounces his name 😂

Titchwolf -  MAGA people / covert right wing militia people were interlopers in several BLM protests (including one here in #Raleigh). They posed as "allies," committed vandalism then left the scene. So, yes, Trump supporters are burning down cities and blaming others.
Trump knows best. He's an expert on losing the black vote.
Trump picked the wrong subject here. I have met VP Biden many times and worked with his son Beau on a charity project.  He is as decent, kind and sincere as they come. And his faith is an integral part of him. Trump is no match for this man. #Biden2020

There are whack-a-doodles on both sides. David Duke supports Trump. Should we paint all Trump supporters with that brush?  Why not try to actually listen to what the reasonable voices in each party are asking for? Or does that not get you airtime on FoxNews?
Remember when Trump ran from debates with Hillary.   He is desperate. We know him and we know Biden. Debates are a waste of time at this point.

Thinking about tariffs on Canadian aluminum for example. So trump “punishes” them with tariffs because their aluminum is less expensive than ours, driving price up (because we the consumer will end up paying for tariff).  Shouldn’t goal be to make things more affordable not less?

Do you really believe Trump would be talking about delaying an election he thought he was winning?
Would the political trends we've seen in the Trump era occur under any GOP President? It's an interesting thought experiment and a question that can't be answered.
Oh really!? Trump himself said it was an “inspection” but I see you’re going with another lie to defend your demigod
2018 granted Democrats a reprieve in southwestern Washington but the trends seem to be accelerating this year. Trump has accelerated changes that were going on slowly before.

Of course Joe the Plumber would be a Trump guy.
Even if TikTok is the serious threat that Trump says it is, which I doubt, it's an issue that can and should be handled at a lower level than the president. There's no need for Trump to micromanage. I also doubt that Trump will get any political benefit.
Your evidence is "no way she didn't know" about a SECRET plot.  And her excuse was it was a bad order. It's the same reason the military &amp; DOJ have argued MULTIPLE times (successfully) that any orders Trump gives on Twitter, they can legally ignore because they're all theater.

You’re not dumbfounded...just dumb. I was referring to Trump’s speech this afternoon and his palm tree gaffe. Try to keep up.
Of course Trump would not have the authority to do that, the Internal Revenue Code including deductions was enacted and is amended by Congress, but it's not like that's ever prevented Trump from announcing he'll do something like that.
A lot of people are very bullish on Garcia but if anything, Trump's political fortunes have sunk further since May. Based on the trends and polling elsewhere, Biden is going to carry CA-25 by double digits and it's gonna be a tough race for Garcia.

True. The Trump/Kanye thing is a new low tho. It’s not the normal ratf#%king. It’s cynical and exploitive and condescending in a way we’ve never seen before. It’s not merely sowing confusion. It’s exploiting an unbalanced man because you think so little of black Americans agency

In such times, remember you're not crazy..this started with trump's first press secretary announcing to the press that  "his was the largest inauguration crowd in the history of America..PERIOD " You're not crazy..trump is a con artist..They don't do well with straight questions.
Such a transparent desperate scam by trump, they assure voters are really stupid
And it will never happen.  Trump may get fined, or have to surrender assets, but he will never be incarcerated.
Let me understand. Is your goal here to raise money to help with Covid knowing that trump will not do anything that may benefit any other person on earth, especially Obama?
Trump hasn’t ever had an original thought or action. He’s not a human being. Husk of a man. No soul.
*Role model That's how we spell it in USA..Also, tell your russian troll farm people that everyone in America knows who trump is and and who his daddy was..where he got his money from to bankrupt himself to be bailed out by russian black money and now american tax payer money..
I can't believe I have to say this but, now do Donald Trump.  Parler bot
IS enough in the Mueller report (as stated by Mueller himself, if you read it), for Trump to be CHARGED WITH OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE WHEN HE LEAVES OFFICE. He's also very likely going to be charged, when he leaves office, for hundreds of violations of the Amoluments Clause of the
Thanks Obama for actually doing this years ago. Because, you know, I have a pre-existing condition and the GOP &amp; Trump really do not give two f’s about anyone but their donor base (and if they die before the election from a pre-existing condition, they’ll count their vote).
Agreement here it’s worth has withstood all Challenges  leave it in place even if we call dog shit  or even Trump care Doesn’t change its value
Me talking about covid, Trump being a dumb cunt, stupid conservatives, antivaxxers, antimaskers, and anything that is fucked up
The Trump Admin is trying to suggest that China/Iran pose an equal threat to our elections as Russia does: THEY DONT...and they all know it.Every bit of evidence given to Congress supports that.
Notice the difference, Republicans? The US Gov is saying China "prefers" that Trump doesn't win re-election &amp; that Iran seeks to "undermine" President Trump. But even Trump's own Govt. isnt claiming they are ACTIVELY "denigrating" Trump like Russia is currently doin to Biden.
This is amazing. I’d trust one of those goats as president more than I trust trump.
Goddess for trump, GTFO.
Hearing from multiple sources that Trump will be signing an executive order tomorrow requiring seat belts installed in all new cars going forward.
If that's not authoritarianism, I dont know why I oppose trump's tactics..everyone thinks their ideas are the best..you think libertarians wouldn't love to shutdown everything for a week and announce 0 taxes for all..or #2A people lock up everyone and have machine guns for all..
Just keep lying all the time #trump #TrumpLiesEverytimeHeSpeaks
The affordable care act which was politicized to be known as Obama care act in deivisive press releases was and is needed and necessary  .Lets agree to call it Trump care or whatever and move on (press challenge?)👀
Watching  on which  states Trump’s been successful in life with use of the “Power of Positive Thinking.” How many bankruptcies? Trump U? Trump Foundation? Has he chosen to ignore  assessment of Trump’s life?
Having a hard time thinking Pompeo did anything useful for anyone other than Pompeo, except maybe Trump.  Of course Trump is about to become a has been and Pompeo needs to build some fast credit towards what comes next.
Everything trump touches dies!!!
I never said a damn thing about Trump. I stated why I thought Obamacare is crap. Doesn’t mean I hated Obama. You don’t have to like everything a President does.
Right. I'm voting for Trump too. I think people misunderstand my anti-Swamp comment to mean that I'm a liberal. When I'm actually one of the most hard-core conservatives that you'd ever meet.
I dont know..i like all the ideas but I would love to see the ones with a payment plan..we could become sweden but take a poll..how many Americans are ready to give 50%+ of their paycheck to the government..especially US government which trump Jr could lead one day?

This is why I love Trump
Trump's thoughts on executive orders:
Trump alone can fix it. By giving a payroll tax break to people who do not have jobs.
Dejoy, the trump donor dismantling the US Postal Service, lives in Greensboro. He sits on the board of Elon University. I think we need to start calling his places of business and asking where our mail is.
Trump supporters still trying to figure out which version of their dear leader to support..the one suing to take away protections for pre-existing or the one selling it as his own healthcare plan..They'll just go beat their wives and write hate messages on a BLM mural instead..
Will they be called trump enablers? Lol
Trump really dude
At this point it's unfair Trump hasn't gotten the virus.
He was responding to a question about a test he didn’t feel he needed to take just because Trump felt he needed to take one and was making that point by asking the interviewer. It’s like the old “when did you stop beating your wife?” question. The question is an accusation.
I’ll take “The only Shithole President the US has Ever had” Jeff. And that would be Donald John Trump for $1,000 or is it several trillion now???

As a North Carolinian, I think that's a great idea. Let's have Jonathan Swan be the moderator. He and Trump already know each other.
I vacation at Myrtle beach solely for the Trump kitsch and paraphernalia. (These also look like Chris Farley)
If NFL owners had only green lighted Trump’s purchase of the Buffalo Bills years ago, we would have never had this shit in our hands.  Very similar to W realizing that he wouldn’t be MLB commissioner.
I remember when I wrote that “silent trump protestor” Medium piece back in Nov 2016, you tweeted it out every day for weeks (maybe months). So you’ve always been one of the cool kids to me! 😎

I’m forever grateful that Trump led the troops across the Delaware River (with Jesus) to write the Constitution and kill bin Laden after 9/11.  Hail Trump!  Oh, I almost forgot that he invented ice cream.
Donald Trump has enough evil on his own. In my opinion he makes his own party look bad. Whether Democrat or Republican, America does not need four more years of this egotistical, divisive, wannabe dictator. Ship him to his friends Putin and Kim. His kind!
Now they're free to testify to the current criminal activity Trump's Billionaire Donor is doing to obstruct the US Mail and criminal acts to obstruct an election! It would be great if we actually had a Republican Senate willing to do their job.
I gave up all hope when Trump cult turned anti maskers overnight..its amazing how the last 4 years have played out..the first day I became certain we were in for a rough ride was when this happened.
I have been to Thailand, and my parents had a Thai exchange student for a year, and I've never once heard someone cal it "Thighland" until Trump. You should probably look for another theory since this one can be disproven in a single tweet.
Yes..ask trump to sign an EO to reverse civil rights and voting rights for women and black people..that will satisfy your hate..
This is true but just don’t be a trump supporter😂😂😂
Trump is worse than Nixon..and if you were true trump cult you would compare him to Lincoln..Reagan left with a booming economy after his term, Clinton after his term, Obama after his term..Vote for a reality show conman and complain to the world about how truth is the enemy..
There is no Christianity in Trump's campaign. If you see some you either don't understand the religion or are delusional.
Trump claims to be perfect and literally banned women fleeing forced abortions in China.
Trump claiming "This has never been done before", of him signing a bullshit Exec Order to make Insurers cover pre-existing conditions.Really? **Its being done RIGHT NOW. Obamacare was the FIRST law EVER to require Ins. Companies to do that**Sorry Princess, Obama got there first.
Uhhhh..........that isn't "major", you idiot: THAT'S OBAMACARE. Its already the law.......you know, the law that Trump is currently in court, right now, attempting to overturn? What bullshit will the GOP come up with next?
Trump is a symptom..he is not the disease..and after going through these 4 years, I have almost given up hope..The country needs some hope..Biden is only half of that hope..we'll still be suffering for decades with the disease..
Trump and his deplorables are disgusting
Did Trump get a new weave?
"Well, you'll have to ask the President that".......and that will be that. Right in front of us Donald Trump will have hobbled the Postal Service, slowing the reciept of mail in ballots to a snail pace.
it's political because he keeps asking for a federal bailout and Medicaid expansion. It's political because he blames R legislature for not already giving more unemployment. It's political because he blames Trump for not having some straw man national strategy.
At least 6 Republican operatives, some tied to Trump camp, working to get Kanye West on the 2020 ballot.   They’re taking advantage of his mental illness!
Thank GOD for President Trump!
But America no longer is the symbol for ordinary people to succeed - only the elite like trump and friends.
Love them both ...Trump 2020
Hey..this EO is the best healthcare plan trump or GOP have ever come up with..atleast now trump cult can't argue that protecting people with pre-existing conditions is a socialist conspiracy..
I agree with much of what you sat#y, but you’re just wrong on this. Your own opinion of Trump is blinding you.
Trump teased an executive order to require health insurers to cover all preexisting conditions, something already established under the Affordable Care Act, which his administration is suing to dismantle.
I literally can't deal with these fucktard Trumpers praising Trump for an EO covering pre-existing conditions. The greatest President in my lifetime already did that for us with ACA. These people are fucking delusional.
Oh, he is. Trump likes guys like Jerry. Birds of a feather. + Evangelicals will largely still support Jerry.
Pre-existing condition protection is part of the Affordable Care Act.  This isn't the first time Trump has claimed to do something Obama already did.  Trump still takes credit for the Veterans Choice Program which was also an Obama program.
This is already a thing from the ACA! You know the law trump has been railing against his entire presidency lol. Like come on
Before spreading fake news about biden,  let's settle why Hillary isn't dead yet based on the con donnie pulled on you in 2016..You're not allowed to lie about 2020 before donnie explains his 2016 con..
Really? I think Trump said it because that's exactly what you kindergartens are!
Trump is trying to Kill all Americans...
Trump can sue in courts to take away women's voting rights and then sign an EO saying women are allowed to sit around a polling booth and his supporters will be cheering yayy..women's rights..that's what this is..
Aww..you got conned by donnie too..he needs supoorters like you to think an EO to cover a thing that's already law is a heathcare plan..just like veterans choice was Obama's law, just like the economy was Obama's economy before trump ran it down or Obama's pandemic team he fired.
Absolutely! If Trump refuses to leave then "We the People" will March on Washington and remove his ass! 😡

But it’s actual Trump’s America. 🙄
I have already decided that I am going to be as careful as I can be. Wear my mask, get rubber gloves carry my hand sanitizer and vote in person. Trump* and his minions are trying to destroy America. Voting for Biden and all Democrats on  Nov 3.  I am not taking a chance.
And speaking of “hate”...  Pelosi also chided James Rosen during the Trump impeachment for asking if she hated Trump, and she angrily lectured him on her being Catholic and hating no one. Then video surfaced of her accusing Republicans of hating Clinton during his impeachment.
Umm..no..we can expect to see talent appreciated..look at what trump has done to people like Faucci, vindman, all of our FBI, so many IGs etc etc..
Good on AOC for having a policy! And believing in a cleaner future. What does Trump believe in?!? Dirty stinking oil money. That’s it.
Why hasn't Trump signed an executive order to make the coronavirus disappear? What is he waiting for?
I think that is kinda the point with Trump*. He isn't saying he is cutting Social Security .. but this will do it.
Lol..obama kicked them out of G7 after their Ukraine antics..sanctioned the hell out of them for the election meddling..kicked china over the south china sea..kept them out of Hong Kong..Trump reversed all of that..crimea gone..south china sea, Hong Kong gone..smell the coffee..
Trump’s  Crusade Makes US Censorship Look a Lot Like China’s
Do not blame the President for this, our Congress can't get their crap together. We need another George Washington to come in and willingly re-limit the executive powers. Trump or Biden are certainly not that guy. Better luck next time around. We need to breed better leaders.
China owns America under trump..they got Hong Kong and got massive deals with US by hurting our farmers and consumers with the trade war and the tarriffs we paid added deficit at double the speed of any admin..you know who buys all US debt bonds..Go figure..
Did you hear the boooes to the MSM? 😂🤣 Epic! &amp; Then the people cheering &amp; clapping at Trump about his "peaceful protests"
Trump is a piece of shit. That is all.
Does this mean the Trump campaign now has to cover the expenses for this event?
America and all of the world would love a Biden administration..As long as Biden doesn't solicit support or extort foreign governments for help in getting elected by hacking emails, pushing fake stories and propaganda etc etc, I think we can still save our democracy from Trump..
Oh like trump does anything but tweet all day..though I’m sure he’s so lazy enough he get one of grandkids to do it.
Well as long as Biden doesn't solicit their support and ask them to hack trump emails and spread fake news through their intelligence etc etc, Biden is fine..
Trump holds news conference from NJ golf club: WATCH LIVE
Wow, sir. Trump promised to repeal and replace Obamacare but now he's signing an executive order to reinforce Obamacare. This is huge!
Reading a translated article by Chinese intellectual named Jiang Shigong, and I realized liberalism, centered around America, has failed. Western world has been led to decadence, nihilism, inequality, political decline, as evidenced by the rise of this celebrity strongman, Trump
We have this. It's called Obamacare and Trump has been trying to get rid of it since he took office
away"? Honestly, Kellyann, the discussions at your breakfast table w/your husband George, who despises Trump &amp; is part of Project Lincoln, must be legendary.
each day that passes, another vote against you.  If you showed the same energy that you used to ban tik tok used on dealing with the trump virus you would get a 2nd term.  thoughts and prayers
Yep. Open the schools &amp; then get a 'spike" in cases, esp. teachers. Then they blame Trump for putting teachers &amp; students at risk, &amp; lock everything down again in late October. Surprise!
Oh, but wait, Don! Dont u remember that Trump (who was always prochoice, btw) suddenly became Pro-Life.....while at the same time bringing back the Federal Death Penalty? Trump is what white evangelicals (en masse,anyway) are made flesh: COMPLETE AND UTTER HYPOCRISY.
Trump's dementia is progressing.
Remember this day as the beginning of the poll's making a big shift. Media today: Blaming Dem's per #GOP talking points for no stimulus, telling public Dem's are the problem but Trump will do EO's to save the country. MSM saying a country not wanting Trump to win = to Russian GRU
Hey  can you explain how Trump is actually right about the virus disappearing?
anyway. Good Lord, people wake up.Millions upon millions of ppl just lost their health insurance that left w/their jobs....and Trump is, RIGHT NOW, in court trying to overturn Obamacare.....with NO PLAN to replace it.Which means, somewhere around 45 million ppl now, will lose
Dear Republicans: Pls do us all a favor &amp; educate  u even know what the payroll tax Trump is wanting to cut IS? IT CUTS SOCIAL SECURITY &amp; MEDICARE! That's exactly what the "payroll tax"  have to have a job to get any payroll tax
This world really says fuck a pedi because they don’t want trump back y’all sad asf
I bought on this a while back when Trump was at 31% and thought it was a steal then.  But, I should have bought way more.  So, heck will now even at 20%.
When we eradicate the tRump Virus, we can begin to build our economy without killing more Americans, killing our nurses and doctors and our children, thiet parents and Grands.  Until then, fvk over.
I think they are the nouveau riche. People who think that Trump* is the people's idea of a rich man. He is a want-to-be popular man. He has been propped up his entire life. Who the hell bankrupts a Casino? GEEZ the bank always wins. And Mark Burnett created the apprentice myth.

Prediction: they open schools &amp; then have a big "spike" in cases, esp. teachers. Then they lock everything down again in late October &amp; blame Trump for putting teachers &amp; students at risk. Surprise!
I think the game plan is: open schools then have a big "spike" in cases, esp. teachers. Then they call for another lockdown in late October &amp; blame Trump for putting teachers &amp; children at risk. Surprise!
Why can't people realize that you can criticize both Western AND non-Western countries and still vote against Trump? It's possible! I promise!
Four decades ago, Biden wasn't in favor of segregation, he opposed bussing as an effective way to integrate schools. Now - the comment about not being black if you vote for Trump - just highly inappropriate.
should be maxed out in the $$ actual betting markets that are giving Trump 1/5 chance of winning pop vote. Are you? If not, does your employer prevent you from doing that?
Which Trump can’t do by Executive Order
Testing. Trump press. Testing 123.
well, I dunno,  I can get Trump at 21% to win pop vote.
I think twitter and Facebook have led to the destruction of our democracy more than any foreign government ever will..they dont understand their own platform..look at this from yesterday..as if it's difficult to open new accounts for the farms..
If only Yoh-Semite was located somewhere in the continental United States and Thigh-land wasn’t a country.  I think Biden and Jo can walk down a ramp and drink water from a glass. Neither one takes a bath in a mix Yellow #5 or Red #3.  Did you use Trump’s bible for your oath?
THE MORE INSANITY THE MORE VOTES FOR TRUMP!  "WE THE PEOPLE" want Jobs Not Mobs! "We" want Legislators not Agitators! "We" want Educators not Indoctrinators! "We" want Journalists not Propagandists!  "We" want Workers not Freeloaders! "We" want Flag Wavers not Flag Desecrators!
No one should vote in 2020 if Biden ever does what trump is doing to cheat at an election..the day biden says somethung like Iran please steal or hack or sabotage trump campaign or spread fake news and hire trolls and bots etc..That'll be time to jump ship to Kanye..
Hope Biden doesn't go the trump way of begging them to steal emails and spread lies etc with lackies chatting with Iran or china intelligence fronts etc..that would be the end of democracy..I hope Joe is better than trump..will not vote in 2020 if Joe does what trump has done..
And more than likely to his face.  He just doesn’t understand their responses and the translator sure as heck isn’t going to tell Trump they just called him a stain on the fabric of humanity.
I don't think anyone would encourage and solicit china or Iran's help to hack into trump's emails and leak them through their intelligence selectively etc..if Biden does anything like that, we will have a problem with him too..we can't all be playing games with our democracy..
Trump’s holding a press conference yet I don’t see any press covering it?
News conference on the Trump virus - through his lack of leadership and intelligence Trump will kill 100s of thousands citizens. On the economy as a bumbling moron Trump will shrink the gdp to a -40% in 2020. But we’re golfing again this weekend.
This guy makes great remixes Trump "It is what it is"...
So much for more freedom to do business.  Trump issues executive orders against TikTok and WeChat  via    #DonaldTrump #TikTok #SocialMedia
I dont see Joe begging them to hack anyone or to do anything to influence anyone..rest of the world can all hope for trump to lose..america is hoping with them..what's wrong would be for anyone encouraging them to meddle in our elections instead of sanctioning them..
I will be discussing the tRump virus with real Americans as we ignore your usual lies.   Try to speak English for once.
Trump consistently bashes Biden and Democrats during official White House events though.
Like I said, you want Trump to win.
Let me be clear, this won’t be the downfall of Jerry Falwell Jr more than likely this will be the rising. If by some miracle he doesn’t get his job at Liberty University back he’s posed for politics related positions. Trump’s not gonna leave him hanging.
Thank you for all the information. We all need to pray for the safety of President Trump!! God bless 🙏
I understand medicare for all is a hot topic for a lot of single issue voters..I hope you are ready to move to Canada or Mexico with a lot of other single issue voters on supreme court judges, abortion rights, civil rights, climate change, DACA kids, min wage etc when trump wins.
Trump is a clown 🤡
Let's just call it what we know it will be: a Trump campaign speech.
how about you realize there are only two candidates who can win. Biden or Trump.  Anyone who doesn't vote for Biden, actually WANTS Trump to win.
tRump. The biggest asshole POTUS ever. What a high mountain to climb after Andrew Johnson and Andrew Jackson. Formerly, biggest bigots in WH.
No that's not how secret police work. This really is perfect bec it illustrates perfectly that vision of control &amp; power tRump voters think they're giving themselves when they vote for him. This is the whole point-tRumpers want status in a fascist regime &amp; they show us this daily
Duhhhhh another tweet not from you! Trump 2020
How does Trump know what Pelosi/Schumer want? Trump has not attended any negotiation meetings (to busy golfing and trying to get a rally going). When will Trump take responsibility and do his job (oh, I forgot, he "takes no responsibility")
Trump Derangement Syndrome is thinking that every bad thing that happens is a conspiracy to bring down Trump.
Trump is throwing everything at the sink, all at once.
Great. My wife is still laid off. Take your time on the stimulus and unemployment. This virus is about wrapped up... ...said no one except trump
I love this genre of tweet showing things happening in Trump's America and saying it will happen if Biden is President 😂🤣
So we agree trump was lying in 2016 and spreading fake conspiracy theories..what makes you think you got conned in 2016 but you are not being conned this time?
I think Trump has gone overboard on the culture war stuff this time around and he doesn't have an opponent so readily willing to lean in on the other side of it.
Aren't you all still waiting for hillary to die from your 2016 conspiracy theories? Stick with her before starting new conspiracy theories about biden..
if you have a child send them to school and let's see if trump cares if he/she gets sick or not, I bet he doesn't
We do care. 150k dead and counting and Trump says “It is what it is.” Caring would help.
What I mean is....he has disrupted the plans of Satan and the deep state.  I often use this term for people struggling to see how a guy like Trump could be used by God.  It’s a way to put it that no one can argue with.

There is a seep problem in the American Protestant Church in the era of Trump. There needs to a reckoning
Nothing has helped you except your own Stockholm syndrome..you know you have been conned but you don't want to admit..atleast the trump University students woke up and sued to get their money back..He has found an even more gullible group to con who won't even ask for damages..
When the bank forecloses on your home, they don't ask if you voted democrat or republican.  When the sheriff comes to the door with an eviction notice, they don't ask if you are a Trump supporter or not.  Nobody is immune to this.

U.S. Intelligence: China Opposes Trump Reelection; Russia Works Against Biden
Someone on Twitter suggested he go to a small country in Africa that starts with N and ends in r...not sure how tRump might mispronounce it.
Wrong. Up to 50% of people may have some form of immunity to it through T-Cells.   Maybe do some independent research so you can formulate a unique and well educated opinion rather than parroting "Trump bad" at everyone who has done so for themselves.
There was a significant GOP mailer that went out promoting mail-ins here recently.  I expect Rs to close the gap some, but yes, Trump's rhetoric on ABM's has hurt them.
NOT TRUE. Russia is WAY ahead of China/Iran in their influence of US (and other countries) elections.Everyone knows  Biden isnt WELCOMING help from China/Iran, while Trump has already welcomed Russia's help, even assisting them.
The big difference here is that neither China nor Iran have even a fraction of the influence campaign that Russia have developed: no where near  Biden isnt WELCOMING help from China/Iran.Trump already has and  the Mueller report!
Trump has been very confrontational with Russia for several years now. Why would Russia prefer Biden? China I get. They've already paid the family off. And, Iran would do almost anything to get rid of Trump. This report is pure bullshit.
You do realize that Ivanka Trump got MILLIONS in patents from China when she went on the Presidential visit there last year right, you hypocrite? Hunter Biden didn't work for the Administration........really not the same thing.
Ugh, sigh, we just can't seem to do anything anymore. Not even when it really, really matters.  ... Coronavirus stimulus talks fall apart in 'disappointing' meeting between Democrats, White House ...
Trump absolutely must immediately agree to Dem compromise (which is best option) or do an immediate #ExecutiveOrder. I vote Dem, but am worried  will pull BS &amp; take  to court to stop #unemploymentextension. It'll waste more time #WeThePeople don't have!
"But Trump" is so tiresome.
President Trump: "You won't see me for awhile."
We already know Donald McGahn destroyed the Supreme Court. We already know he skirted the law working for Trump* . Yes .. I would like to see him testify before the House, but we know he is no Alexander Vindman.  McGahn didn't risk all for his country. He did it for his party.
Biden is done.  Wait for the first debate.  Trump will get under his skin and totally get him off the teleprompter.  It will be for great comedy
You all are so full of hate it is sad. Donald Trump is waking up America. Your bullshit Will not fly here. God Bless Donald Trump ✝️🙏
You are a laughing stock.  I can’t wait to find out what trump has been holding over your head all these years.  It’ll be the cherry on top of the huge embarrassment you’re going to suffer at the hands of

But tRump has a block the vote strategy.
Will Trump have his health plan ready to discuss?  He's really tardy.
Yeah, to put it in the pointed language you would use (although I don't presume to know your beliefs), a big example is Trump...who is a bigoted jackass &amp; much of his Administration is a pack of clowns. Luckily his approval is around 38%...Which is the Math that truly matters.
I don’t believe this, he is a liar just like tRump &amp; is using his position for personal use just like tRump.
A normal President would publicly tell Putin to stay the f out of our elections, but as we know, Trump appreciates the assistance.
Everyone should vote NOW.  Biden has already agreed to the debate schedule and Trump has not. Biden released his tax returns. Do you think Trump will release his tax returns before this debate?  Lots of people are saying Trump and Deutche Bank are under criminal investigation.
Yes who would have thought trump could trash the Obama economy this badly. Over 10% unemployment.  Thousands dying in a pandemic trump ignores. Yes that exceeded all good expectations
Coronavirus stimulus updates: Relief bill stalls, Trump mulls executive order
He really meant "pitied again", you know. Just another Trump misspeak.
Please don’t vote green in 2020. I love their platform but we need every vote we can get to go to Biden so we can prevent Trump from being re-elected. At this point, as much as I hate to say it, it really is the lesser of two evils. #SettleForBiden

Well would ya look-ey there.... the Russians once again trying to take down Trump's opponent to help him out. My blind bird dog saw that one coming.
Facebook blocked several Russian troll farms of people pretending to be black and supporting trump..They won't play fair..be vigilant of people on social media and especially ones with 10 random numbers in their names..
Just think if trump says anything about pebble ..👀
Trump called 4.7% unemployment under Obama "American carnage" but now calls 10.2% unemployment "Great Jobs Numbers!"
Honestly, I don’t get why Trump pronouncing Thailand the way he did is reason to make fun of him. Just listen to how most Americans pronounce ‘Iran’ or ‘Muslims’..By that yardstick, most of you deserved to be mocked.
...and the day I trust Trump to disseminate information....not happening dude
Folks are really out here ripping Biden for this. All the while, Kanye is OPENLY conspiring with the Trump campaign in an attempt to "split the black vote" because they actually believe "black people will vote for the black guy..."
They are both equally dangerous and trump should be held accountable for conspiring with the russians over crimea and the Chinese over hong kong and uyghyr camps..
Trump is still spied on
Trump only has a BS degree in Economics from Wharton, and he's definitely filled with "BS"...
I dont think trump would lose so many times in courts, have all his associates land in prison over corruption and scandals from paranoia..its a criminal enterprise and no one should escape the law no matter if youre the most powerful  person on the planet.that's the American way.
I guess some people feel it is a parallel scripture to draw between Cyrus and Trump.  I see what they are saying, as the Bible is cyclical. I think all is yet to be seen and as always turning to individual prayer for discernment. :)
Trump for weeks: We need to open schools  Dems: He wants to kill kids!  *Cuomo opens schools*  Dems: We need to open schools!
No need to own it when media will blame Trump for making him say stupid shit. Or Google will just suppress the link to his video so no one will find it.
And millions of Americans believe God gave us Trump. Get out there and organize. We need to do the work. God allows us free will. It is up to us.
Trump long has relied on nondisclosure deals to prevent criticism. That strategy may be unraveling. - The Washington Post
I hope Trump chooses you to be the next VP.
Stop it , there is no comparing the two. Trump can get up in front of a crowd and give a two hour speech with no notes. Biden can't even get a sentence out with notes.
Appeals court rules against Trump, says House can sue to enforce McGahn subpoena - The Hill
Another interesting fact.....guess when Israel celebrated their 70th Birthday?  2018.  So lots of Bible numerology around Trump but he is not to be confused with a Savior.
Biden supports legalizing abortions for women that want them. Trump bans women fleeing forced abortions from entering the United States.  I understand many Catholics are upset with the former, but why are you ok with the later.
When you lie so often, every now and then you get you messages crossed-up.  The GOP rails against *cosmopolitan" leftists Dems as out of touch with real America, which is what Trump is supposed to stand for.  So, in defense of Trump, he's now an elitist, too. Go figure.
Trump is chosen as a great disruptor, that is all.  He's not a messiah or savior.   The story of King Cyrus is he was a pagan man, chosen to build up the Kingdom of Persia, and it was Under Cyrus the Hebrews were allowed to return to Israel after 70 years of captivity.
I see your data is not annualized so close to -10% contraction of economy in this quarter..40% number is an yearly projection..imagine being 40% worse than the great depression which still has books written about it..trump had 2 jobs..save lives and save jobs..he did neither..
ha! in light of the whole Deutsche bank records thing, one really gets the feeling that this administration is trying the same tactics Trump used to pull the wool over the eyes of lenders and regulators and realizing, holy sh*t, we're smarter
Lol Trump knows about bankruptcy
At least you're honest. ;-)  The choice is between Trump and Biden. I'll take Biden and see where we are in 4 years instead of Trump continuing to burn down the nation and wipe his arse with the Constitution.
We hope to see you licking the boots of the corrupt administration when you or your loved ones die of the virus and lose their job, employer provided insurance and savings from the million dollar hospital bill as trump organization pumps all our relief money into its businesses.
Leave it to trump suppress to brag about 15% unemployment as a good thing..they had one job on the economy..protect jobs and payrolls..instead they pushed everyone on unemployment and then want to get points for having so many unemployed..failed to protect lives and jobs..
Bezos took more risk because his parents gave him a gigantic loan.   $250k from your parents who likely didn't charge you interest makes a lot of risk go away. Bill Gates' mother connected him to the CEO of IBM. Trump got a $1mil loan. Etc etc etc.
Dear AMERICA  REMEMBER HOW TRUMP LIKES TO BRAG HOW GREAT HE IS...  RIGHT. SO.   DON'T YOU THINK IF HE WAS ACTUALLY A BILLIONAIRE HE WOULD BE SHOWING YOU HIS BILLIONS?  HE ISN'T AND HE ISN'T
Y’all just want voters to die if it means putting Biden in who is the same as trump lol
Dude really...TRUMP HAS NEVER BEEN A BILLIONAIRE...  GET A LIFE!
Trump being Trump. Taking credit for people slowly going back to work as the country slowly re-opens from a pandemic ... to jobs they wouldn't have lost in the first place if he'd been a halfway competent president. It just doesn't get any more petty or self serving than this.
Most Americans &amp; majority of world do not put the words respect and Trump in the same thought.
I bet you believed Hillary was sick and going to die in 2016..well we have been through all of trump's playbooks..we are not gullible like the Trump University students or helpless like the cancer kids he stole money from..get to biden once you're out of conspiracies on Hillary.

You dont know dementia..If anyone is charged with any crimes and convicted I will believe obamagate. The "hoax" hearings exposed trump completely and no one can deny trump asked a foreign president to dig up dirt and give it to guiliani..protesting is 1st amendment right..

“This was a colossal blunder” Andrew Cuomo speaking of Trump and his admin management of the pandemic. Let’s use those words. Brand it for what it is!
if it's all true then i mean... shouldn't everyone be outraged about pedophilia? isn't that a no-brainer? something just seems very weird about it all, and people closer to the right or people that side with trump seem to be the only people concerned with it. i don't understand
Yep. Trump probably thinks "October Surprise" is something he farts out during presidential sweeps week.
"to explore statistical methods of compiling an accurate estimate of noncitizens. It says the aim is to carry out Trump’s mandate to exclude undocumented residents from population totals used to determine how many House seats each state is entitled to."
Trump’s orders say the Chinese-owned apps “threaten the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States.”
Shame on you for:  Thinking this Tweeting this Suggesting it Not believing that God is providing them the strength to keep going Or having doubts,  BECAUSE WE ARE WINNING! Now apologize to God, Jesus, and the Holy Spirit for having doubt and Thank them for Trump's determination!
It’s not shocking when the royalties for self publishing are high. Even a standard KDP from Amazon could be $10 per copy. It’s more if it’s through other self publishers (80%ish). Allows easy money transfers to Trump from bulk buyers.
Fauci works for federal government..he is paid federal salary and whatever perks come with his job..if you're raising questions about his ethics, maybe you should question how kushner and ivanka made 200 mil dollars last year in federal government.or ask for trump's tax returns..
Did the mayor of Portland really say that the rioters should calm down because they helping Donald Trump?  That’s it?  That the concern? Not the police?  Not the people?  Wow
That’s why I hate those people. “Not voting for Biden is voting for Trump.” No it’s not, both are extremely corrupt: Biden is owned by the oligarchs that run this country and Trump is a wannabe fascist dictator. I want no part of it.

10.2 percent unemployment for the first time since 1983! (Reagan)  Trump’s finally done something that Reagan did!  Huzzah!  (Trump should remind people that Reagan was a Republican because most people don’t know it) 😉 😆😆😆

With $1,000,000 put up in advance. Otherwise we know Trump wouldn't pay up. Come to think of it, $1,000,000 would only cover 100 lies. Better make it $2,000,000. For each debate.
Trump super spreaders
Problem would be low turnout..Joe has wide love in the black community and everyone knows his record as VP under Obama..the racist accusations don't mean anything cause everyone knows Joe..trump campaign and racists are not trying to win black vote.They are trying to suppress it.

She's certainly not there to provide the DOJ Inspector General function. To a certain extent DOJ assumes the executive branch employees are truthful. Though now there is Supreme Court precedent to assume the Trump admin is lying.(Dept of Commerce et al v. New York)

Time for Trump to Smoke Joe Out of His Basement
The shame should be especially shone on Joe Biden after his remarks yesterday where he said that blacks in America are monolithic. And to think that most of you likely think Trump is racist but Joe is cool.
Which still leaves millions of actual black Trump supporters. Blexit is real &amp; this thinking that the black "community" all think &amp; vote the same way is the epitome of racism. Shame on anyone castigating those who would think/vote differently than their race supposedly requires.

So tiring to see these “Trump is to blame for virus” but not a single concrete reason why!
I know how liberals don’t understand federalism, but the states are in charge of their own public health. Trump acquired all the supplies needed, hired the experts, put out plan..... up to states after that
It would be an interesting poll. Speaking only for myself, a Warren pick would make me reconsider not voting for Trump. None of the other candidates would do that, and Biden isn't going to pick someone who makes me want to vote D so I guess it's LP or write-in.

Every Trump Cult Clan member I know does not have a problem sacrificing their kids for the cause! They ONLY really care about eternity anyway and could care less about this life if it helps to own the Libs!
The ONLY thing a Trump Cult Clan member cares about is owning the Libs, they are even willing to sacrifice their school age children for the cause. Putin is using this data to gain every advantage he can on the world stage!
Trump is now a deity in the eyes of our Amerikan comrades! (satire)
Too bad every Trump Cult Clan member believes he is doing the Lord's good work in a mysterious way!
The Trump Cult Clan believes that Jared is doing the Lord's work in a mysterious way!
The Trump Cult Clan members will believe they are doing the Lord's good work!
The Trump Cult Clan members will just believe their dear leader is doing the Lord's work!
In Trump country around me they call that doing the Lord's good work to protect the Patriarchy in the 21st century!
Most folks in the Trump Cult Clan are willing to sacrifice everything in order to own the Libs! Putin is using this data to manipulate his agent of chaos in the WH!

I've watched Trump through the decades from failure to failure. This is how he operates. He insists everything is fine, the future is rosy and no one need worry, even as his latest project is coming apart at the seams.   Used to be his dad would bail him out. Now he's SOL.
What is Ana Navarro's base of support/agreement? She's like Rick Wilson...Dems love that she hates Trump but don't actually like her and Republicans dislike her.
To be fair, Trump can definitely speak spontanelously…his aides and speechwriters would prefer him a bit more Biden-like in his inability to form cogent individual thoughts. Tho obv not to the same degree of applesauce brain.
Obviously Trump’s racism!

I'm not sure that Congress won't blink and vote some amount of money.  I'm very interested in how that will work out.  But for Trump it IS all theater.  Has been since early on when he first started with EOs that were pure photo ops.  He thinks he can talk any lie into fact.

Sure, they were laid off because of riots...not because of that deadly virus Trump did nothing about because he was certain it would disappear “like a miracle”. What is wrong with y’all 😂😂😂
I think Trump is betting that the Dems won't go on record trying to block an unemployment extension via EO, so he gets his order-signing photo op, which is all he cares about.  Then Congress has to worry about the optics of not funding it.
I’m sure that was their plan all along. Trump just loves signing those EO’s because he thinks he gets all the credit. Fuck him.

Such an unfamiliar sensation to relate to and wholeheartedly agree with someone whose last name is Trump. I appreciate you beyond words.
Only place Trump failed was putting it in the hands of the governors!!!  Once again, do nothing Dems want federal bail-outs for their policies, or lack of. Let’s talk about Georgia... seem to be doing pretty well these days. 1 in 5 deaths came from NY!!

OMG, Trump was right AGAIN!
When do the libtard's heads actually start exploding from seeing their NY hero gov agree with Trump?  OMG.  This is a Scanners-level event, IMO.

Trump has walked away from many colossal failures. He has a history of backing down, cutting &amp; running and letting other people deal with the mess he made, all the while insisting he's made a great deal. He doesn't have the backbone to stay in office as a lame duck. He'll leave.
The Pope said Trump was NOT a Christian.
"Black vote" Can someone please explain to me why the media is going batshit crazy over a small misspeak on Biden's part as if that's all it's gonna take to have POC turn on him.  Really? Do you see/hear what Trump has said/done EVERY GD day for 4 years? Come on, media.

My guess is once the results are in and it's clean he lost, Trump will do what he always does...walk away and leave a huge mess for someone else to clean up.   Pence will pardon him for any federal crimes and he'll manage to convince himself he came out on top.

tRump with all this God, Bible and Gun talk is just orange with jealousy over all the power and influence Biden possesses.

Ds as well (w/ regards to this poll), but prob far more effect on the right and support of Trump (for general polling).
You are acting like this is novel to Trump though. People LOVE their side using power to own the other side and get their shit passed.
Using a departmental agency to advance a political agenda….like targeting his opponents with tax audits? Or perhaps using the phrase “I will use my pen and phone to take on Congress”. Or maybe he’s been putting journos in jail using the espionage act?
The media is sure fans of decrying literally everything Trump does, but loves when Biden says (or when Obama said) he’ll use executive power to accomplish stuff. The people low key like authoritarianism- when it is on their side. This is true for D and R.
Yeah, Trump the authoritarian is a great PR move but he has been an insanely weak president and has accomplished little. People beg for him to be more authoritarian when it suits their desires. Like the constant (unconstitutional) call for a nationwide mask mandate.
It is only pronounced Tie-land. Quit sucking up to trump.
Agree. I'd be interested to hear what he says in his video. Been worried they'd try to put Trump with Epstein. Mueller looked for anything &amp; everything. Also,FBI has known about Clinton &amp; Epstein &amp; others for years. Has not done anything we know of.Blackmail on top of Epstein's?!
So Trump did the right thing here? Dems were trying to be “tough on crime” since the large cities they governed were in the midst of horrific crime waves. And they decided to just jail the offenders to get good numbers and publicity- which destroyed communities.
Again, can you focus on the actual article instead of Trump only? The media treats the Democrats like Gods up until the point they are literally indefensible. While republicans pounce when dems mess up. Hell mags print glamor shots of terrorists so there’s a bit of leeway
Good for you. I’m sure you believe Trump is a man of faith because he is endorsed by many faith leaders who coincidentally have political aims that align with his. It’s not like Biden authored the bill that led to the higher mass incarceration of minorities in modern history.
…what does this have to do with how the media portrays republicans? This is total circumstantial ad hominem. BuT wHaT aBoUt TrUmP? As the media attacks random highschoolers, grandmas posting on blogs, and meme makers.
Yeah, I’m sure that saying that people are attractive means you fuck them. Biden has far creepier interactions with children than Trump.

No veteran anywhere in the world should support the Orange Infant. But for Fox News calling him out on these donations he NEVER would have handed the $$$ over to the Vets. It would have magically disappeared.
*sigh*  A comment showing ignorance of both the diversity and also the long history within the US of both groups. But still not the entrenched racism of Trump who wants to save the suburbs from minorities.  Our VP will now definitely be an African-American lady. And ASAP I think.
The guy is indefensible. He carried on with the birther movement for 8 years because having a black president ate him up alive.
Do you really have that many people claiming it does, because I literally don’t know ANY Republican neverTrumpers who are ready to sacrifice the entire party over Trump. My Repub friends will vote against him for Prez not straight ticket, &amp; want Trump gone to save the Party.
He’s the biggest piece of sh-t to walk the earth yet y’all worship him.
Biden will “hurt god” ... says trump, who could be re-elected ... please vote him out. And while you’re at it, please just vote the whole GOP out, too.
8 year birther movement because the orange infant was eaten up alive by a black president. Called for complete ban on Muslims entering country. Mexicans entering country r all rapists and murderers. And this coming from a pedophile.
“Mexicans coming into this country r rapists murders etc”. And y’all applauded when the orange infant said that. Y’all r as deranged as he is. U steal from charities too?

And that is true in other states Trump won comfortably in 2016, but currently finds himself in a battle in the 2020 polls conducted thus far. That list includes GA, IA &amp; TX. Early poll leads for Trump were consistent in each but not comfortable. More: 3/3
The case for using the word "comfortably" to describe Trump's position in a state like OH -- where his 2016 win was wider -- is not much better. At best early polls (and there weren't that many of them) showed a "consistent" Trump lead.   ...but it wasn't really comfortable. 2/
I take issue with the use of the word "comfortably" in this opening sentence.   ...especially when it is used to describe Trump's position in states like MI, PA &amp; WI. Early 2020 Trump leads in public polls in those states were few and far between. 1/

Sorry, but it has...and I feel this way. Covid does not trump the Constitution...Cooper is a tyrant...all this was unnecessary ... and the numbers do not support it. People are dying, but not many from covid. More from the effects of Cooper’s illegal orders. He should be jailed.

You, yourself, are exactly why a conman and grifter like Trump can get into office and have a following.  Facts are real. They are truth. They matter.  Opinions are what anyone can spout, about anything.  The FACT that you believe Trump over the CDC (read the article) says a lot.

You gotta be kidding. Nobody's afraid to put "Proud Liberal" on their car. Antifa would have your back all day long. It's the Trump sticker that gets your tires slashed.  Which Congressperson has asked constituents to kick Biden supporters out of restaurants and gas stations?
Trump is attacking indoctrination, not education. When professors get forced out of universities they've worked at for decades, because they disagree with the Liberal mantra, education is done. Like it is now.

Until  pisses all over the place.
Now unfortunately, not voting is not an option for me, because I do feel that Trump is actively destroying this country. But otherwise, if the bombing in the Middle East is that concerning to you, your option is to not vote. Cuz Trump is still bombing. A lot.

At this point in the general election, your choices are Trump, Biden, or don’t vote. That’s just the way voting in America works, unfortunately. You would have a point if we were still at primary stage (hint I didn’t vote for Biden in the primaries), but now it’s a bit late.
Another example (of many) of the blatant hypocrisy of the religious far right - those "christians" (lower case c intended) who support Trump, for example: Jerry Falwell Jr. Taking Leave of Absence From Liberty University
If you are so invested in the “who did it more” argument then I suggest you go read the rest of the replies to this tweet and see where I poster evidence that Trump did it more.  But to the main point, if you care about the bombing in the Middle East, I have bad news for you.
He didn’t do it more than the current administration but again that is beside the point. Obama acting on general American policy that Trump supports is not a reason to not vote for Joe Biden.
is truly stupid if he doesn’t realize that almost all the topics will be COVID and race relations. Trump is gonna get slaughtered.

It's really pretty simple.  Each Governor is responsible for health care for their State.  Trump supplied ventilators.  Governors have what they requested.  Trump did his job.
Finally... a leader who knows what his presidential duties are, and does them! Saving the US and the world- thank you President Trump!
Haha. No one is perfect. Admitting you aren't perfect is therefore a sign of mental strength, not weakness. But, as we know, Trump has an incredibly fragile ego. Admitting he has flaws would destroy him.

Seriously, if you're a #NeverTrump Republican who recognizes the danger Trump poses, you can't just vote him out and keep his enablers.  You've gotta vote Dem for House and Senate until your party gets it $#!+ together.
What do you think is next? Is everyone waiting until Trump's out of office? What about anything criminal he does for the rest of the time he is in office? I feel that should be monitored and stopped, too.
And yet one of the most qualified candidates to ever run for president lost to him, just like Biden is apparently trying to.   If they aren't going to campaign for a compelling progressive vision for this country, Democrats should just be quiet and let Trump lose this himself.
Well look at that, looks like Trump enjoys bombing Iraq and Syria just as much as Obama did. But go on about Biden.
This will backfire. He'll siphon more votes from Trump.

Trump will likely still ask SCOTUS to hear the case. But the Court just answered this question in practice when it held Congressional subpoenas to the President’s bank and accounting firm were lawful under certain tests, meaning courts can consider them (and enforce them).
The Trump campaign has decided to attack Joe Biden as an enemy of religion &amp; the Bible. It’s a mean-spirited attack, for sure. But it also seems unwise. I’ve rarely heard a politician speak as authenticity as Biden does about the role of his Christian faith in his life.

That's fair criticism.  However, Trump is the one who badmouths Fauci.  Fauci sticks with the facts and if it contradicts Trump, so be it.

Ya, Trump’s tweet was allll about Kanye, hoping he’ll take votes away from Biden and split the ticket. Which isn’t racist at all, LOL. Doesn’t Kaye know he’s being used?

Dear Landlords and Tenants, Dont fall for the okie doke and start blaming each other. The govt instituted the eviction moratorium (not tenants!) and the govt needs to provide funding to ensure landlords collect rent since tenants work less due to COVID.
Cant imagine being this much of a sycophant. That must be tiring. I dont care if Trump mispronunces stuff. Its just another way to show how little he cares about the world outside of himself. But to try to gas light folks is another thing altogether. To have others aide him...
I’m these unprecedented times, why am I not relieved that some things never change?                        White House, Democrats fail to reach agreement on virus relief bill, and next steps are uncertain
Just awful. They’re endangering the entire nation’s recovery with this event. Any attendees will be rife with comorbidity, as well. When will the most at-risk  people stop putting themselves in harm’s way? It boggles the mind until you factor in Trump’s toxic influence.

Interesting that Cupp would vote for Biden with Harris but not with Rice. I wonder how many other anti-Trump Republicans agree.  Of course, it's foolish. If you're a Never Trump conservative, it must be because you recognize the existential threat he poses. Vote Biden either way.
Well, doesn't surprise me at all. The silent majority helped elect Trump in 2016, that's a fact. I know how elections work and they are not based on the popular vote. Why don't you Google "how elections work" and that answer may surprise you.
I don’t remember anybody having to follow around and clean up after Barack Obama. “No, what he really meant was..”  Don’t his supporters get tired of having to make excuses for everything Trump says?
when discussing polls, I've heard there's low democratic enthusiasm for voting for Biden. Has anyone asked the enthusiasm level for voting out trump? I'm low-moderate on the former, high on the latter.

I’m stealing the phrasing from my sister, but it’s striking how much for Trump and his followers the Bible isn’t really a book, it’s a vibe. You don’t quote it or read it, you just hold it up and promote the concept of Bible.
Democrats are quoting the Bible on Capitol Hill while Trump falsely claims his Christian opponent is anti-Bible in OH. The battle for the Bible in America today is all about our need for a #RevolutionOfValues. I spent last year writing about this.
Idk where these people get off with their "Trump is the worst president ever but if Biden doesn't satisfy my very arbitrary desires I guess it's a wash" bullshit.
Clinton was out reminding people why they hate her for months by this time. Biden's hidin'. That's not going to help his numbers.    1st week of 11/16 you were saying Hispanic support for Clinton was up. Trump outperformed  McCain and has higher support with minorities NOW.
"Though it was hardly his intention, no president has caused more Americans to stop denying the existence of racism than Donald Trump." Of course,  can find the potential silver lining.

The money I’m referring to goes back to the 63 million doses of hydroxychloroquine (plus additional 2 million doses of chloroquine) stockpiled by the govt. before the FDA rightly revoked. This idiot move was inspired by Trump who you insinuate is in the right? Beyond laughable.
Ms. Colleen, IF trump did violate the law before or during his presidency, shouldn’t he face the punishment? I’m confused by your comment. Are suggesting that he is above the law?
Apparently Trump can identify 🐘, just not when they are in his own party.  #politicalcovid.
Trump said they should move it over to Texas 🇺🇸👊🏼
I'm not denying that this is a great thing. I'm just worried that, because of the timing, it'll help Trump get re-elected. I'm wondering why she did it now instead of after the election.
I listen to President Trump for NEWS! 🤣😂🤣

Any chance every American can schedule a “greeting” with Trump so that we can have access to quick-turnaround tests, too?
Trump said it was a bomb...then played it off
Just realized I've scheduled a unit on "Foreign Interventions in American Domestic Politics from WWII to Trump" for the day after the election this fall. 😳 undergrad US political history class.
For one thing, he stood side by side with our nations first African American president. Meanwhile, this is what trump was doing:
Ohio Gov. DeWine just tested positive before he's supposed to greet Trump on the tarmac in Ohio.Womp Womp-- since Trump has already taken off for Ohio. Hope Dewine is OK, and that he follows all protocols, including masking. Maybe this will help convince him to save his citizens
I’ve heard this claim but I’ve never seen it documented or in context. I can’t say for certain that trump is outwardly racist but he definitely does and says things to stoke the racism in much of his base.
Nationally, a 97% survival rate, and a 96% negativity testing rate in NC. Yeah, it's all Trump's fault.
Trump says a lot of things
Donald Trump has had three wives.
The Founding Fathers must have assumed that whoever became president would have at least a morsel of integrity. Trump has proven them to be sadly mistaken in that assumption.
Agree, we've had quite enough lying and killing innocent Americans in the Trump administration.
I can not stand trump.. and then I see this and I’m like bruhhh. Why??? Just shushhh. DNC really pushed this guy over Bernie?

We all know that Trump and his operatives have been breaking the law for years. Why wasn't he prosecuted years ago? That's now irrelevant. Will he ever be brought to justice? My money says no; someone else will eventually take the fall.

Trump’s position is incredibly weak and his recent interviews show that he utterly incapable of defending his actions or the current state of the country. He might believe that he can beat Biden, or that he’s got some trick up his sleave, but he’s wrong.
I honestly don’t understand this thinking. Biden most definitely should debate Trump. Rile him up, step back and let him self-immolate. The only reason Biden shouldn’t is if he can’t handle it for some reason, but that’s a different problem entirely.
But would it give the press (mostly NYT) license to cover every little detail in Susan Rice's history in lieu of covering all of the ongoing corruption and criminality of Trump?  It's not that the public is necessarily receptive to a rehash of BENGHAZI! but the Times probably is.
i can't believe trump is still tweeting about fbi loverboy or whatever
AG James on why she has brought the lawsuit against the NRA now: “We decided enough was enough, and that we needed to step in. Just as we did with the Trump Foundation.”
Oh snap - dissolution of the Trump Foundation is a precedent.
Great sidenote by a deputy when asked about precedent for dissolving a foundation or non-profit: one case is dissolution of a multicultural non-profit; the other is the dissolution of the Trump Foundation (also obtained by AG James).
Nonsense. The debates will be almost exclusively about COVID and declining race relations. Trump has painted himself into corners that aren’t working. He won’t backpedal. He’ll get crushed.
I disagree. His BASE were always coming out, but there are a lot of Republicans who voted for Trump in 2016 but aren't motivated now. Things like this could motivate them.

Post-Election audits show the NRA spent an *insane* amount on Trump’s election. If AG James is right about her allegations of waste, fraud and abuse, questions about where that money came from are incredibly relevant to this lawsuit.
Trump doesn’t even have a foreign policy.
Recall this NBC News Report from October 2016:  “The NRA is spending more than it ever has on elections this year — more than $36 million at last count, with another four weeks until Election Day, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.”
Exactly. How is not everyone beat down by now? It’s not gonna happen. Trump isn’t  going to d!e in jail, he’s going to vagal on that gold toilet with his 4th wife in the next room.
if we don’t get out and vote. Trump is definitely gonna be re-elected
Trump when he hears that the Letitia James press conference is about the NRA, not indicting his organization.
Oh sure. I just more meant how are there still people who can manage hope that trump, inc will ever face repercussions.
Y’know, I’m tired of excitement. Trump is exhausting. Honestly, calm, civil, smart and capable sound like the best traits a VP could have right about now.  I miss the times when I went entire weeks without once thinking about our President.
One really must read between the lines here to learn anything about trafficking. And still.
Someone convince me this will do anything more than bolster Republicans' 2nd Amendment talking point and drive turnout for Trump voters.
Seriously. Trump probably has a whole building just to house his accountants. It's not like anyone that wealthy just has random errors in their tax return.

How do people still have the energy to get it up about AG James’ presser today? Trump isn’t going to jail.
If NY AG presser is about NRA money scheme, we should be happy—not disappointed. NRA was the biggest funder of Trump’s 2016 campaign. AG James has pressed hard to figure out its finances. On top of yesterday’s Deutsche Bank news, NY is at least following the money.
' Trump didn't do #1 most for black people'. True, he did #1 on all of us, mostly #2 on black and other non white people.

He was a private citizen when he made that comment. You got on national tv with a stocking cap, liquor, and black and mild cigars. That’s how you represent. That’s worse than anything Trump has said
Pelosii and Shummer  are playing with ppls lively hood  by holding out on  stimilus package. FUCK YOU DEMOCRATS.  VOTE TRUMP 2020
President Trump defended his ongoing response to the coronavirus pandemic during the Tuesday afternoon press conference.
if trump did a word cloud the biggest words would be "fake news"
do y'all think i could get donlad trump to block me
Trump may be the smartest man in America.  This man is a 300% moron and managed to get people to vote for him and follow him #brilliant
Trump really just needs to stay off of television!
Ummm black girl here! 🖐 no black people are not fooled. This is some white people “we fooled ya crap”. Republicans WILL do anything to add another clown to the ballot for repubs to vote for...Kanye is for GOPs who won’t do Biden but surely cant do Trump.
Trump doesn't have it in him. And he has showed us he doesn't have it in him to be president.
John Trump tried it with that done alot of black Americans.
Ah yes, the manuals.  You know, the ones that trump reads.
President Trump said U.S. military generals told him they do not think the massive deadly explosion that rocked Beirut Tuesday was a manufacturing-type explosion.
I don’t blame President Trump, John Lewis was a lifelong do nothing politician. It’s amazing the media is hysterical over Covid, didn’t blink over all the other viruses and strains of flu that killed more people. It will be history by mid November.
Congratulations to  for this interview of  where #Trump kicks his own ass
Kodak's depressed stock price surged last week before the company announced its plans to work with the Trump administration in exchange for a $765 million loan.
Sorry I hate Trump but this is innacurate. He was finishing hisnown sentence.

In a tweet, President Trump encouraged everyone in Florida to 'request a Ballot &amp; Vote by Mail!'
trump is a dumbass!
Biden will think he's at an old Demcocrat Fund raiser and agree  with everything Trump says.
Especially when you work in higher education. "Oh I hate Joe Biden." "WELL YOU ARENT GOING TO SUPPORT TRUMP ARE YOU??"
President; including trump, Obama (he also deported many of our people), bush all the way back. Honestly if our great country is so in debt is just simply because money don’t cycling. We need to have a certain amount of legal documentation approval for once. How many houses
The problem is really not the American government. It’s our own. It’s our motherland system.. i hate ice &amp; trump myself, but I believe in over population. Zoom out of what the media is feeding us and realize our world is being destroyed. That’s the main reason I’m against any
Trump Voters Look at the President as Their George Patton
Just...... Read...... This
It certainly appears that way.  Unchecked, Trump will continue to destroy everything in his path before the election. My biggest fear is how much worse it will get when he loses.

Why is no one calling Biden again on plagiarism?  He’s always done it. His Corona virus ads say “we should wear masks, wash your hands, practice social distancing, not touch your face”.  that’s exactly what President Trump has been saying for months!!#Trump2020LandslideVictory
sure dude....it's an endorsement...same thing that Trump does.
Trump is a lost case.
It wouldn't surprise me if Trump had alien DNA.

Have you considered that maybe climate change is a real thing and he was deservedly honored for his good work? No I guess you’d rather assume that Nobel Prizes are meaningless. You know Trump caved on wearing a mask, he’ll probably cave on climate change too
The Case-Fatality Rate Chart That Backs Up Trump’s “Positive Thinking”
Your support for Donald Trump has nothing to do with the fact he is a good American it has everything to do with the fact you’re a racist! See how that sounds
Breaking news!!!! We are either going to have Biden or Trump as next president. Neither one will be perfect or do exactly as we think they should. Shocker alert!!! We will survive just like everyone has throughout the history of governments. Enough already. 🙄
It’s the reason why I’m not on FB like that i don’t have the energy for Trump supporters anymore
Obama didn’t make me feel like I could be president. He was your average life long politician. Trump made me feel like I could be president. He risked it all to save the country.
Really hope  is looking after his mental health. No way I could have ever made it through this interview. #hanginontillNov3
Yeah, have Trump push the Heroes Act already passed by the House 2-months ago that Mitch refuses to pick up in the Senate. The Dems were already ready! #VoteBlueToEndThisNightmare
Definitely not okay what Biden said, but I do scratch my head when I see a person of color supporting Trump. Same for a woman. Or any minority. Or anyone in the LGBTQ community. Or anyone with a college diploma.

why didn’t you press her on Trump defunding the Postal Seevice?!
Was Donald Trump invited to the funeral?? I don't know.  Barack Obama embarrassed himself by going completely political and forgetting this was a memorial service to the great man John Lewis was! I watched about 30 minutes and then fast forwarded until the end of Obama!
That’s all fine and good, but you still are trolling by saying that you’ll be leaving the US. As a wise man once said,’America may suck, but it suck a whole helluva lot less than any place else!” The least you can do before you ‘leave the US’ is vote for Trump and the GOP!!
Same old story.#FDR after Hoover, Clinton after Reagan After Bush #1, Obama after W, and Biden after Trump! Just to name a few.
If all the shit trump and his people fucked up hasn't logically lead you to it's being trumps fault at this point then you must be one of the most gullible, most easily tricked person on this planet.
Drive-Bys Go Nuts Over Trump Axios Interview: “It Is What It Is”

Wow, There Was Actually Someone Too Batsh*t Bigoted For The Trump Administration

Fortunately,  has set the table of failure and disgust ahead of them. They should be content working Trump org. If it still exists after  is done with      maybe gone w/daddyDon?
I would call the Trump / Axios interview prime cringe, but he's our president. It's more sad / infuriating than cringe.  This is a perfect example why we need to keep our leaders talking and to be able to ask them questions.  The sunlight has no bias.

I saw the video and she is not that tan.  Facts.  Just like Trump isnt orange.
How many people have been killed by Trump? Let’s ban him
Let’s be real. The only reason trump wants to delete TikTok is because a bunch of 14 year olds ruined his rally.
I voted for Hillary. (Not proudly, but at the time it was a rock or a hard place) I’d gladly tweet #BillClintonIsAPedo ...a lot more evidence has come to the surface, for both. Donald trump is absolutely disgusting too. Sad the candidates we keep being handed.

Throughout the Cold War, weaker countries tore themselves apart in conflicts orchestrated as proxy wars between the US and Russia.  Now we’re the shithole country being destroyed in a proxy war between China and Russia.  Trump has delivered us into the hands of our enemies.
Trump is absolutely not gonna do this
True leaders don’t always need forces to control unrest. They do it by interacting with people and brokering peace. Instead, trump decided to pour gasoline on fire and agitate the protesters because he wants the unrest. Because that what he wants to campaign on. He’s a snake.
That it's not Trump
What a joke -  supports a blatant racist.  is liar &amp; a traitor to his country. Trump is out playing golf while 160K Americans have died of Covid19. Stupid is as stupid does &amp; y'all take the stupid cake! #LockHimUp

I remember very vividly when the faux christians on the right and the far right calling Obama the Antichrist. Based on Trump’s conduct before and after getting into the White House those false Christians do not know anything about Jesus Christ. They were conned by Trump.
That says it all. Trump &amp; his supporters live in lala land while American tax payers foot the bill for his campaign rallies disguised as official business. Ask the families of the 160k souls who died of Covid19 if they are better off than they were 4 yrs ago! #TrumpFailedAmerica

Can President Trump Really Ban TikTok?
News Flash! The Affordable Care Act preexisting conditions was for all insurance companies. What is wrong with you people! Trump has people in court right now tearing down healthcare and preexisting conditions.
So let me get this straight: Trump will sign an executive order making insurance companies cover pre-existing conditions. Which, as part of the Affordable Care Act, passed in 2010, is already law. The same law Trump is trying to repeal via SCOTUS.   He’s an Obama stan. Who knew?
Wheeler doesn't care about the violence and destruction. He just cares about President Trump using the videos of the violence and destruction to help his campaign.
They really didn't think this through because now when Mitch schedules a vote to kill Obamacare the Republicans will all have to vote against Trump's executive order.
Do you know how unintelligent and ignorant you sound by calling this novel Coronavirus the "China Virus"? I am embarrassed to be an American citizen under the Trump administration. Fortunately it will be over in three months!
Huge news! Trump takes credit for Obamacare.
His buddy Trump is going to close down TikTok so  content creators go over to Instagram which this guy owns so the cycle continues
Kanye West is a distraction.  I am disappointed in him though. I can't believe he's sank so low and allowed Trump to turn him into an Uncle Tom character. It's shameful! #11thHour
Stop drinking, Mr. NHL President, you’re becoming delusional.
1st you complain about pre existing conditions not being covered. Then you complain that president Trump covers them. And please don't thank Obama for fining the American people for not being able to afford his insurance! I had NONE. THANKS OBAMA
#ItsAPeacefulProtest     I love President Trump. He is the master and the Dem activist MSM can't stand it.
Trump stating the he will sign an executive order requiring insurance companies to cover pre-existing conditions is one of the best examples of the Overton window shifting on healthcare.
This video is important largely as a reminder that every time that Trump goons attack Biden's ability to speak, they're hypocritically ignoring far worse from their gibberish-spouting tyrant.

I'm going to agree somewhat with French here in that I think Trump has definitely influenced a lot of his sycophants to more openly take on his "trigger the libs" style. I'd strike "ethics" from his tweet but leave "temperament."
We’ll go back to the way things were (booming economy, lowest black, Hispanic unemployment, reduced regulations) once Trump is re-elected in November
Trump’s campaign TV ads are so fucking racist!
Trump is correct.  Own it Fake news man
Can’t wait for him to make one of his usual bullshit claims like “nobody’s ever done it before” or “they said it couldn’t be done.”🙄  Trump says he plans on making insurers cover pre-existing conditions — a protection which already exists under Obamacare

Finally some Truth! Trump 2020 😊🇺🇸
But Trump is😂😂 his EO on pre existing conditions. It’s law-Obamacare
Just because Trump doesn’t get away with his first urges does not mean he respects the separation.
Democrats must have found a new angle of how they can use it.   Because I don’t see an explanation of the change of heart— like we were wrong or something.  So the opposition to open is political and the agreement to open is political.   So what is their angle to hurt Trump ?
what does obama have to do with anything besides living rent free in y’all mouths .....   Trump is white folks doing so y’all need to fix your own mess  Obama told y’all to vote and this is what you did .. stop whining and get to work in your neighbors family and friends 💯💯
Another Trump crony trick— taking “service” out of the Postal Service! #VoteByMailSupression  &gt; [Trump-appointed] USPS head overhauls leadership as Democrats press for investigation of mail delays
Um, Trump absolutely does not respect his constitutional limits. He has specifically said that Article 2 gives him unlimited authority. “It allows me to do anything I want”
Trump not wearing a mask...  if it turns out it’s because he secretly is taking HCQ+zinc as a prophylactic, wouldn’t that make everyone happy?  Democrats and Republicans each for the opposite reason?
McConnell has had this bizarre messaging lately that the Dems are blocking the aid to the working class that the Republicans are trying to push through.  So yeah, this sounds like a lame political stunt that Trump, himself, thought up.
You’re the one who cited the CDC. Common sense and evidence tells us Trump ignored all the signs, ignored his own briefs, pretended the virus would “go away.”   But I never said I got my info from the CDC. You did. So let’s see your evidence.
I want to know how many of these idiots get #coronavirus from this event at Trump’s NJ Golf Club.   They are breaking the law but they don’t care, mehhh we won’t get it.   We will see how many are reported, people are dying while they laugh about it.
Of course China wants Trump to lose.  Why do you think they launched the virus?  Crush the  US economy  and Trump loses or so they hope.  Not going to happen.  China like the liberals continue to underestimate the resolve of the President’s base.
Our President is so funny. He gets the media everytime! It was classic Trump.🤣😎
Also pardoned by Trump. Also 88 years old!
one of Trump's spiritual advisors,all you need to know about Trump
It still exists despite Republicans efforts to kill it. It didn’t implode, and it certainly wouldn’t implode without their help. Still, Republicans and Trump have no plan to replace it. Remember, beautiful healthcare, where every American will be covered at lower cost on Day 1?
It’s amazing to me that so many evangelical Christians are willing to look the other way, but only with regards to Trump.
Rep. James Clyburn is on #Maddow  I hope he explains how Trump does not have the power to do an executive order regarding anything financial. It has to go through the House.
only interested in getting a Russia-backed Ukrainian MP in cahoots GOP US enators Grassley and Johnson to nuke Joe Biden with manufactured dirt. Meanwhile Trump doesn’t care about Russia paying to kill US soldiers. Traitor in the White House!
I love the enthusiasm of conservatives, when they say Trump will win re-election, but I am urging voters to please get out and vote in person.  Everyone!  This WILL NOT be a landslide without ALL OF US and it will take ALL OF US!  Please don't get complacent.  Do your part!
This is a good thing! Now, do tRump!
Tonight I ask some popular TikTok users what they think of President Donald Trump’s executive order to ban the app. See it tonight starting at 10pm.
Trump pardoned you, AZ no way in hell!
I see that differently. Trump did not believe this was a big deal. He had to be convinced to act and his public comments showed his vacillation. The economy was rolling into an election year and he didn’t want undermine that.
Executive order! Let's watch the democrats sue to deny US citizen the help they need. Trump is the best choice for America!
It’s a lose-lose situation, Mr. NHL President. 🤷🏻‍♀️
I will never forget listening to him on NPR the Summer of 2016 railing against Trump.  Lowry  is a weird dude.

Trump is going to get voted out in a few weeks. Chinese folks can’t even speak ill of their government without risk of imprisonments. Seems different to me
There Trump will remain!

Jerry Falwell Jr: Trump ally leaves university post after uproar at picture with unzipped trousers
The Obama administration literally wrote a playbook about how they handled the ebola crisis so well in order to help with future disease problems. Trump threw it away bc a Dem admin wrote it- he admitted that- and did nothing until it was too late and still isn't doing enough
I try to be empathetic but I don’t get the anger here. He dressed up as the president of the United States. How is that a symbol of pain?? I know Trump says things he shouldn’t but still......
Haven’t several world leaders low key snubbed Trump attempting to visit their countries? I’d expect MANY countries, not only China &amp; Iran would prefer he not be re-elected.  #Maddow
Trump failed to protect soldiers from Putin and refuses to even call him out!  He has failed at everything and he's not even a 'good' liar. The fool has to go! #Maddow
I think Trump bends that way. The institutions of government keep him in check, and he doesn’t like it when they do. I can almost guarantee though that Trump won’t cop to something if it makes him look bad. It’s not his personality
I live in NC and look forward to voting for the 2nd time for Trump! I will walk over hot coals to do so...
If that's all they have Trump and his Republican Party are doomed. All we have to do is turn out and vote like never before. Vote early! #Maddow
Dont fret, only an idiot would pay  $300,000++ to be a member of the golf course that grows hay and keeps goats so the Trump organization pay taxes as farmland which amounts to less than $1,000 a year.
Yes Trump will have foreign help again, but honestly he’s cheating right out in the open all by himself already....
Dr. Anthony Fauci disagrees with President Donald Trump’s coronavirus vaccine timeline, says results from trials likely to come after election
None of these "reporters"  had a single word to say when Gov. Andrew Cuomo took a maskless victory lap in Georgia as coronavirus cases were on the rise in that state and even hugged Savannah's mayor without a mask on.
😂 No Gerard. But life is a little less simplistic than Fox and Breitbart would have have you believe. We need to be a little less cowboy. Trump rattles on about  bad China while trying to make deals on the down low.
Something is wrong with Trump. He can barely pronounce names of countries and struggles to say Yosemite. It's so bizarre that he struggles this way. #inners
Doesn’t matter if what you say makes any sense or if can be backed up. You’re suffering so much from Trump Derangement Syndrome  you say “fuck it, just say it and hope it sticks.  Exactly what the media is trying.   It’s called DESPERATION.
But then again, I'm. It a trump supporter. And then we go inside and keep on going back and forth and when I was leaving I saw what I thought was an admin. There name Is: somebody just got here. And I left
So she changed the Team ans she kept on calling me racist and stuff even though I'm not even racist. So the dude that called me racist said that he needed to use my car to earn money and he was sorry about calling me racist just bc he thought that trump music was me
Ok so I was playing Pembroke pines a few mins ago and someone said someone else was driving ghetto bc they were driving bad. So when the cut in front of me in the line I said the had ghetto driving. So someone pulled up playing some off brand trump music and
We will defeat you. Trump 2020 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸👍👍👍
I know it’s a campaign season, so it’s popular and timely to China bash, but even THIS administration is still trying to make deals with CCP about buying our ag products. That’s why I don’t believe Trump or Republicans really give a rats ass about human rights and freedom.
The magic word to erase followers is Trump
I AM MORE THAN HAPPY TO CALL  MY PRESIDENT.  NO MATTER WHAT GARBAGE THE MEDIA SPEWS TO TRY AND INFLUENCE THE ELECTION, MY VOTE FOR TRUMP AND REPUBLICANS, IS LOCKED IN.  NOTHING WILL INFLUENCE ME OTHERWISE.  GET OUT AND VOTE IN PERSON! GOOD NIGHT, SOCIALISTS.
Trump announces EO:  1- Ensure health insurance companies cover pre-existing conditions 2- Payroll tax cut extended through end of year 3- Enhanced unemployment benefits through end of year 4- Student loan payments deferred through end of year 5- Extension of eviction moratorium

Anybody can have access to Donald Trump as long you’re paying a membership fee to one of his gold clubs
I think the GOP refused to come up with a deal with Dems so Trump can do this. It’ll make him look good &amp; secure votes..  Don’t be sheep guys.

Forrest Trump just said again that the Coronavirus will disappear. He's been saying that since the beginning of the pandemic. The only people who believe him is his Base...the non-maskers.
WATCH #LIVE: President Donald Trump is holding a news conference this evening addressing jobs and the economy--&gt;
He and a number of Republican Senators refuse to give in to the Blackmail. Trump said he has other ways to get it done! Interesting, Chicago refuses to divulge just how much to include the Pension Funds they are in Debt.
Wow,  sympathizes with Trump because of the Coronavirus even though Trump takes no responsibility and has not taken the virus seriously. What about the people who have died? Do you also sympathize with them? This is pathetic!
ikr? Trump voters other than the 1% are delusional. The 1% are just greedy misanthropes.
Payroll tax cut only helps businesses and drains Medicare/SS. Trump is evil
wow, one of Trump's spiritual advisors, that says alot about Trump.
If I heard correctly, Trump just suspended student loan payments  indefinitely.

I'm  black. Trump isn't racist. All I'm saying is Joe Biden keeps saying racist things because he is really racist.
If there’s one thing trump struggles with; it’s nature. Wind, gravity, water, ramps, lettuce.....
Be... because it's better if people don't vote in person during a dangerous and very contagious pandemic? The one that Trump allowed to happen when he did nothing except throw out Obama's very successful playbook for just such a situation?
Instead of money changers we have the trump number changers. Everything is just fine here carry on.
There it is. The “lol’s” and the “lmfao’s”.   The first clue someone has Trump Derangement Syndrome. They “lol lol lol” in every tweet.

Unfortunately, yes for real

Most Trump supporters don't participate in polling.
This is a great thread . I’d love to see GM entertaining the notion that Trump is indeed taking some of this evil down. Why is gold and silver suddenly surging when it’s been artificially  knocked down for YEARS. What’s changed ?
I mean, yeah, this is terrible, and should be investigated to the fullest. Guilty brought to bear, etc. But are we using this to justify what has become a train wreck of a presidency? “Oh, Trump was spied upon, so that *must* mean he’s the best guy for the job”.
Trump to take executive action after coronavirus talks collapse
Trump has held China responsible for their shit more than any other president no shit they want him to lose.
Either way he's not going into hiding. I don't know why people that are into Trump don't go to  for official information.
If this is a good week, what is a bad one?  Thousands more Americans are dead, while Trump blatantly violates the law by campaigning on taxpayer dollars? Biden will hurt God? WTF? #LeningradLindsey #TrumpIsACompleteFailure   Here’s a good day: Nov. 3
It was there. In the blink of an eye and it was gone. Like trump in November.

Of course he will. That was Moscow Mitch &amp; meadows plan all along. If trump can sign it now; why did he wait so long?  Because his poll number suck.
Vote out Trump!

Steve Jobs’s creation has turned into Tim Cook’s Apple, a triumph of method over magic.
Yeah. Biden is sane &amp; intelligent. Trump is off his rocker &amp; dumber than dogshit.   Trump literally bragged about passing the baseline test to prove he didn't have dementia, then he said the doctors were "amazed"--probably bc all signs point to a feeble dementia-ridden mind.
Been on Twitter since 2011 and I swear this is the most savage intro to an article that I have ever read:   “One pretty good forecasting rule for the coronavirus era has been to take whatever Trump administration officials are saying and assume that the opposite will happen.”
Amazing that the most recent pubisized election fraud involved absentee ballots and a Republican candidate for the Senate, oh aren’t they type that Donald J. Trump  says are the safe mail in ballots?

Biden will stop the wall? Fantastic. It wasn’t anything but a marketing stunt to begin with. Only 200 out of 2000 miles have been completed. I’m sorry for all the Trump supporters who thought it was a real thing. Trump couldn’t complete the wall if he had 4 terms.

Trump's equivalent of being in 'very good shape' re the virus is the same has his take on his being in very good shape.
If only the coronavirus had made fun of Trump there would be 100,000 still alive.
Trump supporters somehow think that by supporting him they will magically become rich and powerful. But we all know the truth, the GOP will not do anything to help their own base. Don’t believe me? Just look at Kentucky!
That’s calling the kettle black, 50% of Trump’s base lives below the poverty line, but they’re white so that’s somehow different??? Trump despises the poor. I would say 90% of his redneck racist supporters have never left their joke state and don’t have a penny in savings.

I guess that it makes sense that rejecting reality show products would hurt Trump.
I laughed the entire time because trump really reminds me of my self in class when the professor tell me to read the graph or getting caught in a lie
Isn’t Trump full of lies? Every thing that comes out of his mouth is a lie. I can’t think of the last correct thing Adolf Trump has said in the last 3+ years. Please provide correct statements by the moron.
As usual you people regurgitate #fakenews. Try joining us in the real world. Trump 2020, 2024, 2028 to infinity and beyond. Hahaha.
I don’t really see that many people. Probably that’s all there was and you smooshed them into one spot. The country really doesn’t like Adolf Trump.
Beto O’Rourke: ‘Cannot hold out hope’ that Trump’s timeline on COVID-19 vaccine is accurate  via
If by that you mean both are unfit to be president I will completely agree with you but If alot of people are correct about their assumptions of him, he could harbor in another Trump in 2024. Will that be worth all this is a smarter, even more ruthless Trump claims power after?
I would be happy if trump was charged with the hundred other crimes he has committed .
LMFAO now the narrative is “trump stole from cancer kids” you’ve got to be kidding me 😂😂😂😂
Well tRump wants to be first in everything.
Donald Trump BANS TikTok, US Companies Have 45 Days To Stop Doing Busine...  via      #blackout #COVID__19 #2020V #China #ChinaGate #HumanRights #FridayFeeling #BREAKING
I hope we can get rid of #LouisDeJoy, Trump supporter who magically became Postmaster General.
I don’t subscribe to Trump being as bad as people try to make him to be because I actually study politics deeply, and knowingly choosing an evil will never be better than not choosing. And just because those cops are free changes nothing about it being wrong
‘tRump is scared’ and ‘literally does not appear to understand’ what is going on around him: White House reporter
Why discuss at all then? If someone stated a fact to me then I'd be inclined to change my mind. For example, if Trump was caught on record saying "I fucking hate black people" then I'd agree with you and drop it.
I never asserted that. I just stated a fact. If they did, then they are foolish. Also, you can't argue that he didn't have his skin color going for him.   Compared to Trump, Obama didn't do nearly enough to help black people in America. You call Trump racist, but you ignore facts
“...the truth is that we already know the President’s program for the next four years, because it is the same as the one he has had for the last four years. The platform is Trump. It always has been.”
Oh you mean #LuisDeJoy, the one that contributed all kinds of campaign money to Trump. He’s now the Postmaster general, strategically placed to screw all of us.
This is very similar to Trump asking Ukraine President Zelinsky to just "announce" an investigation even if they don't actually start one. Just only to raise unwarranted doubts in minds of voters. Even otherwise y did Trump wait until 3 months b4 election to start investing?
Hear Trump's response when asked what mistakes he's made
Trump ignores the fact that there was a time in American history were we had much higher African American employment. It was called slavery. He and his cronies want to exploit African American toil and sweat to maintain there bubble of white privilege. NOT RQUAL OPPPRTINITY
Look at exit polls. The overwhelming majority of black voters voted for Obama. Something like 90% I believe.  Also, Kanye is much different than Obama. He isn't meant to be taken seriously due to his reputation. Especially since he openly defended Trump. He's seen as a disgrace.
What I wonder is if this is an intentional or unintentional swipe at being Catholic and troupe that Catholics “don’t believe in the Bible”. Trump had VERY little exposure to religion prior to 2015. Some of the Evangilicals close to him have bigoted ideas on other religions.
But trump is more worried about tic tok 😑
I just said that it's a generalization. Point ended. Trump isn't the most eloquent speaker, and I certainly don't see him as a thought leader.  Also, I never called a petty criminal a rapist. I'm sure that's not what he meant, but he's not very bright or careful.
President Trump told reporters on his least favorite plane that he plans to ban the app in the U.S. Learn more about what a #TikTok ban would mean for marketers:   #tiktokmarketing
"Bush was born on 3rd and thought he hit a triple. Trump strikes out every at bat but still thinks he hit a homerun"
Time for Trump to Smoke Joe Out of His Basement
The shame should be especially shone on Joe Biden after his remarks yesterday where he said that blacks in America are monolithic. And to think that most of you likely think Trump is racist but Joe is cool.
I ain’t a trump lover, but that didn’t look particularly bad... I’ve seen him do worse.
Which still leaves millions of actual black Trump supporters. Blexit is real &amp; this thinking that the black "community" all think &amp; vote the same way is the epitome of racism. Shame on anyone castigating those who would think/vote differently than their race supposedly requires.
Ah, yes, Democrats are going to abandon the guy who is currently favored to win against Trump in the polls.
He called illegal immigrants rapists. Which is still a generalization, but they're known criminals. They came here illegally. I'll have to look up the other two because I'm sure it's been taken wayyy out of context by the anti-Trump media
Can you score a goal?
I looooove how liberals call Donald Trump a racist with no evidence, but Joe Biden has said things that would be irredeemable if spoken by Trump. Keep ignoring things to suit your agenda though...
Make no mistake: Trump is going to prison if he doesn't defect to Russia in time.
WATCH: Biden Says Black People Are Not As Diverse As Hispanics. Trump Responds.
President Trump is the JOBS president! He's been giving America the business like it's open mic comedy night at an asylum.
I want congress to start getting these subpoenas poppin' but I'm also worried they are gonna botch it and give trump a fight he can win. Probably should just focus on 45s gross negligence in dealing with covid.
“War is my priority.” -From someone who thinks Trump and Gabbard are anti-war
Failure is the last thing people think about Donald Trump,  they hate him because he actually works to get things done for America,  not the retching other side.
President Trump, We have a number of major Cities/States that have embraced Socialist Ideologies and like Socialist Countries around World they are Bankrupt. Actions must have Consequences! Don't bail them out with money needed to help America counter the Virus.
Ditto, I have no intention of being here after Trump is gone, zero interest.
My dad hates his birthday even more than he used to now that every year we call and wish him a "happy Trump's birthday". Alas, he is less deserving of the association than Wharton, which graduates pathological monsters as its business model.
Had Trump brought to the task of controlling the virus the same energy and zeal with which he seeks to line his pockets and punish his perceived enemies, we could have crushed the curve long ago,
It’s not fake news and the CCP Chinese are trying to sabotage Trump.
Trump was so dumb his dad couldn't buy him into an Ivy until he did 2 years at Fordham. Even the Kushners got their kid into Harvard as a freshman.
In what reality does David Brooks exist? Push came to shove. Republicans picked Trump.

When push came to shove, Republicans picked Trump. The talent at  truly is drying up.
Seriously?! His team picked Nov 3 for its significance. I think all papers should lede with “Trump Lies Again. No Vaccine by Nov 3.”
What Geraldo is saying ;is that trump can’t actually debate politically,he can only name-call &amp; trash-talk like the pro wrestlers do in between matches
How dangerous was the "peaceful transfer of power" video that President Trump shared the other day? Did anger the opposition?
I wonder, once Trump has been voted out, can the entire population of the United States sue him for all 167k+ coronavirus deaths?

trump is the president. This is happening under his presidency not Biden’s
President Trump and Joe Biden have one thing in common; for the past 20 years they’ve never changed their narrative.
He’s just a racist Georgia trump lover 🤷🏽
Southern University put little Trump walls in their dorms to fight Rona. Jackson State would never. 🤣
This is happening while trump is the president. So why should we vote for him if he can’t stop it now?
This video explains Trump. He is God less.
The most natural thing that comes to mind regarding tRump is a sink hole.
I'm certainly not going to tell anyone how to feel about Biden's comments but I will say that racism is probably a topic Trump should steer far away from.
Perfect encapsulation what Trump is!!
Trump reminds me of a dog with  rabies Always aggressive and can attack you at any given moment.➿
Just in time to steal headlines from the election. Not political in anyway. I don't care for Trump but 20 years ago? You certainly set about resolving the situation...
He needs the tax money. He needs people to get back to work. The sate isn't getting the bail out from Trump. Open the schools so the economy comes back in NY. The rich refuse to come back.
If elected president, Joe Biden says there will not be 'another foot' of wall constructed on the U.S.-Mexico border, ending one of Trump's big campaign promises.

Why does the Trump organization continue to do business with a US adversary?
People keep saying that Trump has Aphasia. Guarantee that he would argue he has Wholeasia.
Lmao that’s still childish. Trump hasn’t dealt w/ anything. In fact, he’s made it worse. The kids are still in cages. If he really wanted to do something for them, he would’ve worked to destroy ICE and get those kids back to their families.
Trump is still President.
Welcome on the TRUMP TRAIN 🇺🇸 happy to have you 🇺🇸
when trump loses the election imma say “it is what it is”
I only said kids in cages was a bigger problem because it is 💀 these kids haven’t seen their families and it’s taken a toll on them and their parents. They’re also being used for sex trafficking and Donald Trump is just letting it happen. That was my point in talking abt them.
Trump is literally functioning at the level of a kindergarten so anything and anyone above that is a huge gain for the country Biden can read and write and capture the sun   he’s a super hero
If u find nothing wrong with Trump then u r one of the willfully blind chugging right wing propaganda &amp; Trump lies or u r in full knowledge of Trump's racism &amp; u support it! Either of those two are equally terrible!

When Trump supported Absentee Voting, he probably didn’t realize this...  “The system most states will be using this fall is absentee voting — precisely the system Trump endorsed. 33 states will permit ppl to vote absentee this fall w/o any justification”
It’s hilarious the stuff Biden has said gets a pass from democratic voters. If Trump saying this is a carnival barker? What would he be if he said the things Biden has said? I don’t get it.
I’m all for people ganging up on Trump but being more religious than a competitor does not mean you are more fit to be president and if you think it does you are a fool
Looks like Trump v Vance is will be the standard legal decision going forward.  Good news the victims he preyed.  It takes a Supreme Court decision to catch a predator today.
Trump is president. He has to take responsibility for the good as well as the bad. Or he could be honest and admit that he is just a big cheerleader and has very little impact either way.
Sounds like Trump talking.
Let's also note that if Trump wins, he'd be the oldest president ever at 74. Reagan was 73 when he started his 2nd term in '84.
Just for that comment Trump 2020
Under Trump. The swamp has never been deeper.
Here, fixed it for you: Trump is a cosmopolitan. He went to Wharton, he’s a billionaire, he’s traveled around the world. His supporters are poorer, less educated, and many have not left their home states. We wonder why he seems like such an god to them. #Thighland
Biden has released his taxes. Trump wont release his Taxes as it is damning &amp; cud reveal - his real net worth, money laundering, campaign finance violations to pay off porn stars, shady deals with Russians through intermediary banks or shell companies, his dealings with Epstein..
Who are you talking about?  Not Biden for sure. Has to be Trump. Do you even listen to Trump. He is plain dumb.

Sad and lost among the ruins in the wake of a Trump presidency
Thats what u want us to believe. I can see right through ur mind games! Biden is an open book. Everyone knows abt his strengths&amp;His Flaws. No surprises here. Trump's years of business is strewn with shady dealings &amp; outright frauds. He has a mansion load of skeletons!
That might be way Trump is not doing anything to help stem the virus.  He wants us all to be just like him.
Better than Trump, the worlds worst puppet of dictators!
Nope. This is a two pronged strategy. My biggest concern back in 2016 itself is the level influence Russia has on Trump. The last 3.5 yrs only reinforced it by his actions &amp; inactions. 1. Get a Traitor out of WH. 2. Put a patriot &amp; a decent man who knows the levers of power in WH
It’s bait for the national guard to go in and spank the shit out of them, the media have their prewritten police state propaganda already written daring Trump to intervene
I've had the chorus of "Radar Love" in Trump's voice stuck in my head all morning. "We've got a thing, and it's called radar love, ok? We've got a light in the sky, some say it's the biggest, I don't know, we're looking into it." Please advise.
It’s two different types of tests! The first one was a quick read (they don’t use this one as much because it’s less accurate but they needed it here for the Trump visit). The second is more accurate and they ran it twice to confirm the result

Trump declared COVID-19 a national emergency on March 13.
WTF is he even saying? Literally every point, with the exception of trump being fat, he tried to make is the opposite of what trump is capable of. Answering spontaneous questions? Trump can barely read what’s in front of him

Lmao lesser of two evils? Trump paid hush money to someone worse than CardiB. I can bet trump is a lot worse. Dude maid a whole fake university. I call ignorance lol
Trump will probably pardon him

There is no Trump turd that  won’t roll in glitter.  I guess that was the agreement when Trump pardoned him of his felony.
Centuries ago, yes. He was referring to NOW!!! No African-American calls themselves Ghana/American or Senegal-American. Just stop it. You know what he meant. Y’all are just looking for a reason to blow up this election. You want Trump re-elected? Keep feeding into this BS!
There is no Trump turd that you won’t roll in glitter, is there?  I guess that was the agreement when he pardoned you of your felony.
TikTok "Shocked" By Trump Ban, Insists Order "Undermines Trust In Rule Of Law".  Translation: China needs to be out of the US, T-45days. NYC #blackout was the marker. Tik-Tok, the clock is ticking. #war
Trump is unfit for office and is a great to national security #TrumpIsNotWell
This is why you don't act like a dick towards your allies  "A plurality of Germans .. supported a reduction in the number of US troops based in the country, with a majority wanting to see all 20 US atomic bombs located in Germany removed as well"
If I understand this right, the government is trying to force a sale of TikTok so Microsoft can buy them. No wonder Trump wants the treasury to have a portion of the sale.
The fake Republican outrage is so fun to watch.   The right wing selective hypocrisy ass polishers will spend the next month exacerbating this clip of Joe, pretending that Trump hasn’t been alienating and marginalizing the black community for DECADES.   gtfoh.  #TrumpIsLosing
I didn’t vote for Obama. He should never have been president. I didn’t support Trump in the primaries because Cruz was more qualified. However Trump is a different kind of President. His extensive business experience prepared him for the position in many ways.
I’ve always felt after every election loss I’ve seen that the country would recover from any harm done. If trump wins #2020Election I don’t believe this democracy would survive.
Not sure if you understand State/Federal politics, but Trump has been wanting to come in and stop all this for months. The spineless Democrats want to allow it and refer to it as “The Summer of Love”.   Wake up!
So is Trump,Inc
So you still want racist trump as president then??
Trump is a populist. It appears that he listens to the people more than he does the elite. I’d like to see him voted back in and then we push him to enact NESARA. Probably a pipe dream.
Actually he didn’t. He was extremely angry but Trump voters mocked Cruz and his wife. I remember the primary extremely well. I was on Hannity radio devating Trump’s people quite often.
100%. The irony is that the trumpesters don’t realize that trump doesn’t give a crap about god, religion, guns, or them. He just cares about the power it yields him.
Make trump the 1st president ever to go to prison after office. 🏅
It's Friday August 7, 2020 and Barack Obama is still the most corrupt president in American history. And Donald Trump is still your PRESIDENT! #ObamaGate
Everyone said Trump was unelectable. I think it’s time to toss that old way of thinking. Pick the best man and fight for it. We’ve become lazy campaigners (well, until Trump).
Lol. Trump rubs people the wrong way too. The establishment hates Cruz as much as Trump because he’s an independent thinker.
That’s bad but at least Trump’s press briefings get high ratings.
I blame CNN. They gave Trump absolutely unlimited air time. He would call in and talk for an hour, sometimes more, multiple times per week. And he would just constantly lie and cast aspersions and CNN would only fact-check about 1 tenth of it, if that.
“Steve Bannon’s leap finally did what none of us could do. Donald Trump &amp; Bannon took a low-rent strand of conservatism-class-based ethnic nationalism-that had always been locked away in the basement of the American right &amp; overturned the Reagan paradigm.”
So how is it you have fixed in your mind that it’s ok that Trump is allowing thousands of people to die? It’s amazing how Trump has taken human compassion away from some people.  So now his supporters are against living a long life??? #RidinWithBiden2020
Forrest Trump, you can lie all you want about Biden and Blacks, but that won't change the Black vote. The only Black vote you better count on is Katrina Pierson, your cheerleader.
Cruz does which is why the establishment hates him. And he’s more principled than Trump.
Like Donald isn’t in china’s pocket...where is all his shit made? China! Where does ivanka have a shitload of “licenses”? China!! Who has trump asked to help him out in his re-election? China! #stopthebullshit #endtheGOP
Is Mary Trump part of the resistance now? 🤯
Don’t decide you like something just because Trump hates it. It makes you very, very easy to manipulate.  Yes: Trump hates Tiktok for dumb-ass reasons. He just wants revenge for Tulsa.  But ALSO yes: Tiktok is absolutely shady AF from a privacy and national security standpoint.
When are Trump supporters/Republicans going to stop looking at this virus through the eyes of party affiliations &amp; look at it through the eyes of actual humans dying. People are dying ALL OVER THE WORLD.  What happened to caring about mankind?
Again, I am not nominating Trump for a humanitarian award here. But just because Trump hates something doesn’t mean that thing is by default ok. Something can be BOTH shady AF AND hated by Trump.

The 2 most miserable biggest lazy complainers in my office are complaining about a customer and saying “he must be a Democrat” this morning.  Yup, and you 2 are still proud to call yourselves republicans in the age of trump, so that says more about you than it does about him.
Except these people aren’t “living without fear” so much as they’re “living in selfishness, dying in ignorance.” In fact, that should be the new Trump campaign slogan.

That's not my experience of Trump supporters. I'm frequently shocked by the "nice" people who support him.
The 'elders' really, really need to learn how to bow out gracefully and leave 'the field of battle', including Biden and Trump.

Trump chose his latest Post Master Czar with orders to sabotage the US mail system in order to prevent vote by mail except for Florida. More high crimes and misdemeanors.
Kinda seems like hanging is a pretty common fate for people with inside knowledge of Trump’s secrets, huh?  FYI: a neatly arranged stack of bank papers with a note to a fellow DB executive was next to Broeksmit’s body when it was found. The location of those papers is unknown.
But we need to hear from people who are well-versed in Trump's failings.
Sad. Insane. Unreal. Scary. This is scary because the polls are obviously showing a huge loss, they don’t seem to care, Trump is golfing every weekend now. They’re either robbing the place until they leave or they have a solid plan to cheat and stay.
Tom Bowers, DB exec who approved Trump’s shady AF $2B loans: suicide by hanging.  William Broeksmit, DB exec associated with earlier shady AF Trump loans: suicide by hanging.  Jeffrey Epstein, Trump pedophile buddy with knowledge of his rapey activities: suicide by hanging.  🤷‍♂️

It's all BS! Watch it end after the election, especially if Trump wins. They will try something else.
We really need to pray for Biden. He is in BAD shape and not to mention the embarrassment. Trump will win by a landslide but we need to pray for a Biden mental health, it’s the loving thing to do.
And did you see Trump's interview with Jonathan Swan?? 🤣🤣🤣 No one over 50 should be President.
Biden's comments were all over the cable news networks yesterday afternoon.  I think it shifted once Trump made his comments.

Rudy Giuliani on BLM:  “Stop the nonsense. These are killers, and these are people who hate white people, they are people who hate white men in particular, and they want to do away with a mother-father family. They don't think fathers are necessary”  😳 😳
"they are displaying .. the weakness of a people who lack both the stoicism to endure the pandemic and the fortitude to defeat it. Leading their charge is Donald Trump, a bone spur warrior, a liar and a fraud, a grotesque caricature of a strong man, with the backbone of a bully."
"[Trump] a national disgrace, a demagogue as morally and ethically compromised as a person can be. As a British writer quipped, “there have always been stupid people in the world, and plenty of nasty people too. But rarely has stupidity been so nasty, or nastiness so stupid”.
BLM is about police violence, and ados is doing a well planned kanye trying to keep trump in office. Bash everyone in the CBC while McConnell self named the grim reaper is your senator, beware of Republicans in blackface using reparations to keep trump in office
A devout Catholic, Joe Biden's very open about his faith. The President is less open about his. Luckily, in America, we don't have a litmus test requiring candidates be of a certain faith. But it's odd Trump would pick this fight. #WakeUpCLT
I'm not a Democrat. I'm not voting for Biden or Trump. I voted Jill last election. But I'm not dumb enough to think that any third party has a chance to win an American election in these modern times.   All I'm saying is that this guy keep slipping up for no reason 😂 (muting)
Get'er done Trump make America GREAT again AGAIN
Still waiting for the tRump worshippers to explain yo-sim-iets?? What the hell was that??  Dumbest POTUS EVER!!
The executive order will take effect in 45 days.
Moreover this is not a used car to learn to drive. People r loosing their live &amp; livelihood &amp; Trump has been consistently incapable of learning anything in last 3.5 yrs. In fact he has doubled down on his racism, lies &amp; corruption! He is not learning, he is burning!
There is a big difference between a Gaffe and outright racism. What Biden is famous for apart from other good stuff is his gaffe. What Trump is famous for other than his lies and corruption is his racism &amp; his 100 word vocabulary! Huge difference!
I can't wait for the debates. Trump will embarrass himself completely.
Trump will officially change the name via Exexcutive Order.
I'm a 68 yo male. Not exactly TikToks target demographic, but can Trump actually ban a social media platform with the stroke of a pen? What exactly is China getting that they don't have already? Is this just a trial balloon as he seeks to ban other platforms or media outlets?
Biden himself doesn’t know where he is! Trump 2020!

President Obama was best President. All Trump does is not tell the truth.
We know you didn’t Joe!! That’s Trump trying to turn your statement into something it’s not. Take it as his fear of losing this presidential race!!

My vote for Biden was set on November 4th 2016! We had enuf evidence of what to come from a Trump WH even before the casting of the first mail-in ballot in 2016!  Really a VP pick is make or break for voting for BIDEN?
Trump gets no sympathy from me. He had been mean and vicious. He has engaged in immature name calling, been Putin’s puppet, lied over 20,000 times and was rebuked by my grand daughter who is 11 for mimicking a man with limitations. So that makes a child more aware than you.
Trump has done nothing in 2020 except to enrich him and his family. He is the worse President in history and I have been living a long time and have seen other POTUS. By the way I have som Jim Jones punch if you are that gullible.

Lol yes, and they aren’t saying anything I resonate with. Also, I would look into what trump has done for miniorites. I read quite a bit and I cannot pin down anything effective he’s done.
Not gonna lie. Trump needs 4 more years... if Biden wins it still won’t bring us any tangible policies to use for our community.. I’d rather ride with the devil we got than to be disrespected in another way by a different devil. At least with trump we know where it’s coming from
If I had been a life long Republican I would be mad as hell this piece of 💩 hijacked my party. This isn't the Republican party going on right now it's Trump's party of con jobs.
A few things to remember gamers.  Trump is trying to ban WeChat (tiktok) IF a US company doesn't buy them in 45 days.  This won't effect the developers that Tencent owns.  You'll still be able to play COD, Fortnite, League of Legends, exc.  Isn't great news but, don't go nutz.
It just sounds like you're jealous of Trump
Obama was not and is not a liar. Trump has told 20k lies since taking office. Obama once said you can keep your doctor or your insurance plan with the ACA which turned out not to be true. That’s it. There is no comparison. Also Obama could speak, write and read English.
He makes a GREAT point! Please DO NOT give our country to China!   President Trump loves his freedom too! Do people believe he’s immune to  Devastation &amp; Ruin?

Except one of the images they are using in their latest ad to attack Biden, a Catholic who says his faith helped him with the loss of his son, is of him with his head bowed praying in Church. Even as an Atheist, I don't see how Trump's people are going to get past that.
At what point does Occam's Razor suggest that Trump and Biden must have some kind of bet about who can say the dumbest things and get away with them?
That explains why Joe's middle name is Kratos. Trump figured it out.

That will work. Can I bring my Trump flag?
Your feelings on Trump are evident. How do you feel about Biden?  P.S. miss you bro!
This isn't a new discovery. You have to vote strategically based on where you are. My thing is this, as I never originally planned on voting for Joe Biden - who do you want to have to fight more (as a president) Biden or Trump?
Indeed, you know you have failed when it's impossible who's a worse person, Trump's dog Jason Miller, or the MMA fighter, Jason "Mayhem" Miller.

He surely didn't go as far as Trump at trying to silence the press, but that's likely because they silenced themselves and purged anyone who wouldn't, see Jesse Ventura, Chris Hedges and uhhh, that other guy - biggest primetime news anchor? Oh, Ed Schultz I think?
Because the left wants us to pay more taxes. They will fight tooth and nail if Trump tried to cancel taxes.

You do realize that trump and his businesses don’t make any profit from any government officials? Every thing is at cost. That’s why all of these investigations over the last few years about this never prove anything. Trump makes no money at all on this.
Trump never called white supremacist very fine people and anyone who says that is lying. Look at the speech for yourself, he specifically said that he was not talking about the white supremacist the very next sentence. If you lie about something like this then your not truthful.

But Trump openly praises those whose corruption and evil dictatorship ways are well known. Big difference

Right? I mean, they did see that he had multiple debates during the Democratic primary and beat objectively better debaters than Trump right?   I mean, like him or not but Trump is not a former prosecutor, you know?
I hate when people call my son,  a grifter. Who was he before he came out as a Trump supporter? He was KingVodka, B.Surius and he was a member of 336 Boyz. His music numbers are below: He gave it all up to support his heart. You don't have to agree, but respect it!
Joe Biden is an idiot.if he thinks he will be president then hes lost his fucking mind and to coward to debate with Trump. Shows you all the democrats are running scared and stupid
Trump already said he was accepting the nom with no one there. Keep up sparky.
Trump is not stupid as you think! Problem with Trump just doesn’t give a shit!
No matter Trump is a con
Don't listen to anyone but your doctor. If Trump or Gohmert have any sense they wouldn't be politicians
I’m waiting for four packages, some from Amazon, and including meds that are lost or delayed. And I blame it squarely on Trump and Louis De Joy.
Why is Ted Nugent hugging Trump.
Here's a WIN WIN PROPOSAL: Have the GOP set a date &amp; time for a Presidential debate, formally invite Biden. Joe shows, Trump wins Joe doesn't show, Trump wins By declining to debate Trump Biden's campaign will be showing their true colors It's a Win Win
I don't know of any patriots are anyone acting like patriot.throwing Trump under the bus
Pelosii and Shummer  are playing with ppls lively hood  by holding out on  stimilus package. FUCK YOU DEMOCRATS.  VOTE TRUMP 2020
Trump doesn't have it in him. And he has showed us he doesn't have it in him to be president.
Sorry I hate Trump but this is innacurate. He was finishing hisnown sentence.
sure dude....it's an endorsement...same thing that Trump does.
It wouldn't surprise me if Trump had alien DNA.
Breaking news!!!! We are either going to have Biden or Trump as next president. Neither one will be perfect or do exactly as we think they should. Shocker alert!!! We will survive just like everyone has throughout the history of governments. Enough already. 🙄
I wouldn't trust Trump, Betsy DeVos, or you with a house plant.
Im confused. Your boy Donald Trump claimed that emotional issues related to COVID were almost worse than COVID itself, so Marijuana would indeed help what Trump wants to ease.
Yesterday for the first time I saw a trump sign where the t was taken out so it just said RUMP. How is that not a bigger thing? #RUMP2020
By the way, I don't support Trump.
Any doubt this woman is a Trump loyalist? And of course it’s Florida. But I love the guys. They are awesome!
So you're cool with Trump son staying home and Trump sending our children to school? Wow!
That is Trump
It is really Trump’s fault. No doubt about it. He doesn’t care about who dies or who is suffering.
Jim I guess you are part of Trump’s cronies. I hope you like being up Trump’s ass.
Trump you are a true fake!
Yippee it is about time they are prosecuting Trump!
Simply to say the American workers are being screwed by Trump! You know I can not even bring myself to say Trump is President? He is just dirty rotten scoundrel that needs to get out the White House and really out of our country! Trump, his family and his cronies. He’s unAmerican
We need to fight Trump
Most definitely. It is really outrageous that Trump’s Republican backers think that the American people are unaware of their schemes. The only reason why they all aren’t in jail is because of millions of dollars that are exchanging hands. They are dirty low life criminals.
And when they succeed they will find a way to blame it on President Trump and conservatives.  Victim hood class has found its way into sports media.
Truly By Trump saying less testing will slow down the virus Is an oxymoron he should think before he puts his foot in his mouth.
I concur, we need  to subpoena Postmaster General Louis DeJoy and find out why he is intentionally slowing down mail delivery! Because it seems suspicious to slow mail delivery just before the November election with having mail in ballots. You are enabling Trump’s corruption.
Problem with Trump is he paid off, with promises, money and lying to get his cronies to aid and abet him. He went too far as to his underhanded dealing with Russia. Trump is a con artist and traitor to our countries democracy. Trump is sleeping with the enemy, and they own him.
It is about time! Trump should have been investigated long ago. Especially since he wouldn’t turn over his tax info.
He and his thugs are not a presidential administration! It is a Hostile Treasonous Criminal Regime that was installed by a hostile foreign government called The Russian Mafia OR KNOWN AS the K.G.B. that helped him lye and lye with a Murderer named Putin as his Trump's big boss!
I support the president.trump 2020
Just another reminder that Vaping will be effectively banned 09/09/2020 because of Trump.  Remember this when you go to vote.
Awesome. Now just get rid of that thing at 12pm, and the Trump Cheerleaders in the morning and all will be well.
It's been weaponized by Democrats from the start. They hate Trump so much they are willing to put thousands of business into bankruptcy and allow millions to die in an effort to hurt Trump and gain power. Don't let them get away with it. Send them all home in Nov.

Not happening! Trump is gone in 2020.
This Christian voter is voting blue this year.  Trump does not represent Christian values.
Nah, Donald Trump is.
So Trump wants to ban TikTok AND #Vaping is becoming essentially illegal on September 9th after he raised the smoking age to 21 based on some shit "evidence"???  I guess the #NachoNazi REALLY wants to piss off some large voting groups!
I NEVER saw this coming!  Trump should prove how absolutely correct he is about #COVID19 and send Barron to one of the underfunded, falling down schools that are being forced to open or lose the little funding they have!
A sin of commission versus a sin of omission. If Trump allowed the deaths to occur in blue states. There is evidence of this. It would be a premeditated act. He told Pence not to deal with Washington or Michigan governors. He actively blocked aid.
Pence is no better than Trump. He is in charge of the federal government response. This has not been a success, had it.
He and his family cannot form charitable foundations. He dropped about twenty five million dollars to settle Trump University. He tried to get the federal government to renovate one of his resorts on the taxpayer dime for a G7 conference.
You mean the ones that are happening under Trump? The ones he is only exasperating by ignoring the manuals they have on this exact subject that teach them exactly how to deal with this? The ones that specifically point out that Iron Fist has literally never worked (his method)?
There is no military operation at this time.But something is going to happen after our election if Trump wins.most know what it is.
Never said the law wasn't important 🤦🏿‍♂️smh  I see why y'all support trump now
Hey, not to alarm anyone, but  has banned vaping come September 9th, 2020.  I'm sure all the #MAGA #KAG #Trump2020Landslide #Trump2020 and #2A people will be THRILLED!  I thought Trump cared about "liberty" and "freedom"    #TrumpVapingBan

Things Trump Hasn't Banned.
You gonna mention that Trump is physically in pictures with him?
Jesus said to worship him would be hard, you’d have to give up everything and you’d be persecuted. Your teaching is exceptionally wrong. It’s like, you’re a Trump Christian.
On Thursday night, the Trump administration filed its opening brief asking the Supreme Court to overturn Obamacare. In the brief, the administration argues that "the remainder of the ACA cannot survive" because the law's individual mandate is no longer operative.
He’s legit, calling Shumer a republican. The fact that republicans are too stupid to see this is not lost on me. Cutting unemployment has long been a Republican argument but that’s not what Shumer is doing and Trump knows it.   #COVID19 #Stimuluscheck
I am a cat owner. Sometimes when you wake up in the morning the first thing you see is a cats ass. Think about having to stare at a cats ass for nearly four years. This is how I describe the Trump administration
But Trump doe
Trump thinks he's above the  law. He  respect for his office. He is a bigot and he sets people against each other. In a real crisis he is absolutely useless. I  wish you well. We love USA.  We just disagree.
Fuck that noise! #BarronGoesFirst Private school attended by Barron Trump prohibited from in-person learning until October as President pushes openings
What does hating Donald Trump have to do with hating the country. I hate Donald Trump because he is hell bent on tearing this country apart. He would piss on his wife and kids if he got a Twitter like. He would piss on you because he's pissed on this country .
Election- Dark but still brought some laughs. Best Broderick performance I’ve seen outta him. Young Witherspoon was great too. Can’t tell if Chris Klein is actually acting or that’s just who he is. Also Broderick has a much better photo op at this DC church than Trump did. 90/100
Trump banning TickTok in the US might be one of the best things he has done while in office.

So presdiant trump is going to ban tiktok he is going to ruin a lot of peoples life bye doing that
Once an account with hardly no followers, no real pic, and a Trump background mentions you then that means the Bots or the Russians are at work.
They will still deny that it works, more people die, more they can blame President Trump!
tRump is like a shit eating dog. He can’t help it.
It's a shame. Trump is jealous of the admiration and the love shown to JohnMcCain,  Elijah Cummings, and John Lewis during their funerals. He wants to be the honoree at a funeral but he does not want to die.
How. Do you think it's head would look mounted on a wall. November is Trump season.
You are right.  Considering he agrees with Trump and thinks Trump has saved lives, he has my full support.
Saw the quotes. What did she say about Trump that’s different from what I saw?
Trump isn't  hearing the democrats and there thugs are going to remove him.and take over

Aren't Eric Trumps wife and you paid employees for the Trump campaign. Shouldn't you identify yourself as such when you tweet. I know credibility is not a word one would associate with your boss, but give us a heads up on where your head is at.
Hard to say.  I've never met anyone willing to admit they voted for him. The Senate RS are working hard to make the institution pointless.  I always hated Jesse Helm's politics but he tried to take care of his constituency.  Can you imagine him eating Trump's shit?
Trump is "Large &amp; In Charge" for 2020. But we ALL MUST vote.
Dems are saying Trump is responsible for the latest outbreaks in Japan. He should have known this was going to happen!
Oh I agree with that part. I also believe I can only speak what the Bible says. If they follow they follow, if they don’t they don’t. That’s on them. Not many politicians actually follow, most noticeable, Trump.
If what you’re saying is true, you can’t be a trump voter. It would invalidate your religion due to politics.

Trump, you are not a civil rights activist. You are a devout racist and of course an inept president that has mental health issues i.e. narcissism, anti social personality disorder. You are a horrible person and president

I agree. And Biden believes in the importance of Climate change, healthcare, and foreign policies. Right now, we change Trump's policies and begin truly working on progressive changes for 2022 and 1024. Let's find the candidates were KNOW want true changed and will fight 4 them.
I will criticize Biden. He's not progressive enough. But he can at least stop the damage going on from Trump. We should've been helping progressivev candidates long before now and must start for 2022,2024. 3 months is just enough time but an end to the current madness.

Imagine willingly forking over a quarter of a million dollars TO Donald Trump. God I hope their money goes to extreme waste. How many people could that fed? Jesus Christmas. 😳
Really hope  is looking after his mental health. No way I could have ever made it through this interview. #hanginontillNov3
Not really - she’s only going to help Trump’s re-election chances if chosen VP...
Both hands up from here in North Carolina! Trump, at his core, is just a terrible human being. America deserves better, and he simply isn't capable of delivering. His only accomplishments since 2016 have been dividing the country &amp; spreading hate. #WomenAgainstTrump

"Trump Sows Confusion With Tweet Urging 'Vote by Mail' in Florida" by Reuters via NYT
Pull up all of Joe's lies and I'll pull up Trump's.
But you want me to not vote for Biden because Trump is intelligent?
That’s all fine and good, but you still are trolling by saying that you’ll be leaving the US. As a wise man once said,’America may suck, but it suck a whole helluva lot less than any place else!” The least you can do before you ‘leave the US’ is vote for Trump and the GOP!!
Yup,  gets a lot of flak from some on the right for going after all Republicans rather than just Trump.  How about they only go against Republicans who enable Trump?  Oh wait, that's just about all of them now.  Never mind.
The problem began when on side didn't accept the election results and resulted to grade school narcissistic plots to destroy it and trump every step of the way.  Wake up sheeple.
This was released yesterday from Trump's DOJ. I know your people don't talk about it because it showed no spying.   I've had enough. Take care.
Another episode in The Adventures of Networkman and Subnet: Crisis in the Control Plane - I wonder if the fact that this appears on a site called Digital Anarchist will cause me to be red-flagged by Trump and Barr?
Hunh? You said I interpret what Trump says.   The fact is I didn't. Trump LIED when he said his father was born in Germany. It's just a lie. You won't even call an obvious lie what it is.   Take care. It's been a pleasure sharing with you.
I want Trump to lose by a massive landslide in November, but it also would be such bittersweet irony if he lost by the number of Americans who died from COVID-19 (154,471 today).
I don't care if Biden has been in office for 150 years. How many criminal investigations will you accept? The problem isn't Trump.
Michael please go have a seat!!!  Trump has been the worst president hands down and he’s an idiot with no morals!!!
My interpretation of his words. Trump supporters always try to explain what Trump meant.   It's a shame that whatever you heard Biden say is exactly what it is but when Trump says something, he didn't mean it that way.  How do YOU interpret "My father was born in Germany?"
Now, the question you should ask yourself is are you a Republican or a Trump supporter? Because Trump's values are not Republican values. Which one are you?

"How Trump’s Upbringing Molded His Personality" by Unknown Author via NYT
I propose that the 1st ignored part of the amendment about a well regulated force of citizens as a militia may come into focus. Cities with inadequate police. Dems conspiring to use army to oust a Trump. We can’t envision it but ...
The Mary Trump story where he goes on about her being a drug addict right in front of her. Being the bully. If you deny the lie, you are the liar. When you tear the lie apart, he can't keep it together. Literally.
I forget, did trump grow up in a poor family? He’s been selling off drilling rights in our national parks, so he should be familiar with the name.... My guess is that the little reading he does contains the word Semites, so he read it that way.
One little creepy tell: trump was darkening his eyebrows to look like Epstein. SWF crazy. That’s how much he admired his buddy.

He’s a trump supporter. You know they can’t accept truth if it doesn’t fit their racism. Give him time to think of something relevant to say
#1 He’s not TRUMP! Any other reason necessary.
Man,  called Trump on all of his bullshit. He simply challenged him on every stupid unsubstantiated claim he has spit out over the past 4 years. This should have happened along time.

Trump for President
Since you mentioned  when are you calling the  Postmaster General DeJoy to testify about why he wants to slow the mail this election year?  When will you call  Johnson to testify about Trump using his office to push the British Open to his property?
They can defend against it. They choose not to. If they can label it, they can remove it. The mission of Facebook is not to stand in the way of Trump winning. They're claiming "innocent bystander" status.
Trump is the best and you know it
I believe that and no longer feel crazy for thinking that way - if #trump takes a second term - and right now he has my vote - this thing we are experiencing now will seem like 3rs grade recess
2. Did Trump supporters verbally or physically attack anyone for expressing their support for KAP?  The point is that you can't play the victim as if you don't verbally or physically attack people who disagree with you.
Please give me an honest answer to these questions. You claim that when Trump supporters get verbally or physically attacked for disagreeing with the reason for the protests.  1. Did Trump supporters verbally or physically attack Kap for peacefully protesting?
A country will be rebuilt after DJT and his cronies like you! You know you hate Trump but you’re scared, so scared. You have just enough faith that somehow he’ll win or just “take over,” you don’t want to risk yourself but YOU’LL RISK OTHERS! 🦋
Trump supporters don't care that he fawns over dictators, but opponents care very much. This is one reason among many why some of us who don't agree with Biden on much, are inclined to vote for him anyway. A running mate who also fawns over dictators would neutralize that issue.
If only Trey Gowdy was still in office and demanded  be held accountable for his pandemic response which has caused 158+ deaths the same way he demanded Hillary be held accountable for the 4 deaths in Benghazi.   Instead, he quit and went to work for Trump.
No, trump is a narcissist. He only sees things as he perceives they affect him.
Please do! We need a new meme for the agony of defeat when Trump wins the election again.
Their plan is being implemented in front of you pretty face. Trump can't win any state that does this.
Nothing he does surprises me anymore and this is just ONE CLIP from a horrendous interview.   What DOES surprise me honestly are the feckless, spineless GOP who absolutely refuse to abandon him and everything he represents. In many ways they are FAR worse than Trump himself.
Please don’t get aggravated! Let the handlers handle it! They know what they’re dining! TRUST! I can trust them to do the right thing after 4 yrs of crazy Trump!💙
"A Wider-Than-Thought Trump Investigation" by Giovanni Russonello via NYT
Democrat states were the ones who killed the elderly in nursing homes. Five of them to be exact. As is well known, the elderly voted for President Trump. Why would he want to kill off his own voters? He wouldn't. Y'all are projecting again. Just like y'all do about the lying.
#Trump murdered 158,000 people as of right now.
1/2 In retrospect, I wish I had written a similar obit for my dad, placing the blame squarely where it belongs:  &amp;  But, I would add  &amp;
Under normal circumstances I’d say this interview was a huge mistake for Trump. But we all know nothing will come of it at this point. Maybe it will turn some voters against him but it’s astonishing how we’ve normalized idiocy w/ him.

New Yorkers hated trump before it was living in the White House, are you serious?
I donated to the Trump campaign today. All of you should do the same
I agree. They will do everything they can to push the debates or stop them. Biden is doing good to string 3 sentences together. Much less a coherent thought. He will stroke out if he actually has to face Trump on stage in front of the American People.
I hate Donald trump for a multitude of reasons but something about his mouth makes me irrationally angry
why does trump, out of ALL things, have his panties in a wad about tiktok...WHY.  it makes ✨no sense✨
THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA HAS WENT FROM A WORLD POWER. TO A  SHITSHOW UNDER TRUMP AND THE ENTIRE REPUBLICAN PARTY . BUT DON'T GET ME WRONG THE DEMOCRAT PARTY IS NO BETTER. WILL THE REPUBLICAN PARTY AND THE DEMOCRAT PARTY DO WHAT'S RIGHT FOR THE PEOPLE THE REAL AMERICA
Trump you are the ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE
2 things, I just looked at your tl and - you know trump rounds up homeless people and is about to let millions more get evicted, yet you’re threatening not to vote against him.   2 I think Scientology’s a horrific, coercive nightmare. A cult. I’m sorry they got to you. Good luck.Republicans screamed for years about 4 dead Americans in Benghazi, but want to sweep 165,000 (and counting) dead Americans under the rug for Trump. Real patriots.
How can ANY human with morals support Trump..I'm stupified!
I hope in my lifetime this changes. Politics may always be just that, politics, but the party can’t keep taking advantage of its people. 2 say Hillary &amp; Trump were 2 sides of the same coin was real bs. But our parties/Perez/Mitch etc...? They treat voters like pawns, not people.
Newsflash! Obama covered the a decade ago . Trump is trying to kill the affordable care act in court now... Contuining compaing for us to be live up is down right is left and don’t believe anyone but Trump. Fortunately the overwhelming percentage is Americans know the facts
Such a transparent desperate scam by trump, they assure voters are really stupid
This is why I love Trump
Trump alone can fix it. By giving a payroll tax break to people who do not have jobs.
Trump really dude
As a North Carolinian, I think that's a great idea. Let's have Jonathan Swan be the moderator. He and Trump already know each other.
This is true but just don’t be a trump supporter😂😂😂
There is no Christianity in Trump's campaign. If you see some you either don't understand the religion or are delusional.
Trump claims to be perfect and literally banned women fleeing forced abortions in China.

We have this. It's called Obamacare and Trump has been trying to get rid of it since he took office
I bought on this a while back when Trump was at 31% and thought it was a steal then.  But, I should have bought way more.  So, heck will now even at 20%.
Four decades ago, Biden wasn't in favor of segregation, he opposed bussing as an effective way to integrate schools. Now - the comment about not being black if you vote for Trump - just highly inappropriate.
Trump’s holding a press conference yet I don’t see any press covering it?
Trump is throwing everything at the sink, all at once.
Great. My wife is still laid off. Take your time on the stimulus and unemployment. This virus is about wrapped up... ...said no one except trump
I think Trump has gone overboard on the culture war stuff this time around and he doesn't have an opponent so readily willing to lean in on the other side of it.

And millions of Americans believe God gave us Trump. Get out there and organize. We need to do the work. God allows us free will. It is up to us.
Biden supports legalizing abortions for women that want them. Trump bans women fleeing forced abortions from entering the United States.  I understand many Catholics are upset with the former, but why are you ok with the later.

That’s why I hate those people. “Not voting for Biden is voting for Trump.” No it’s not, both are extremely corrupt: Biden is owned by the oligarchs that run this country and Trump is a wannabe fascist dictator. I want no part of it.
The goal is to get trump out of office !!
Remember... it wasn't Trump who create the jobs it was Obama... and so the sharp downturn belongs to Obama... and so does Covid... and riots.... and masks. #QAnon

Thom spinning the truth again to suit his narrative.  Did you learn that at trump university?
Fair enough, you’re right. Just because people see issues from different perspectives we shouldn’t name call or attack. It is sad that Trump created this hostile environment. It drags us all down. Thanks for the feedback, I hope you enjoy your day.
Exceptional, considering the circumstances. We need President Trump’s leadership for a quick, full recovery.

Beth Moore is a Marxist &amp; Donald Trump is an Evangelical. ⁉️  We live in the upside down.
While this may be correct, I feel quite sure this criticism of Trump is in response to his recent rantings about Biden. You know the old saying - pot calling the kettle black. Biden has made word errors and has stuttered thru speeches, however doesn't dis Trump on his gafs.

There are whack-a-doodles on both sides. David Duke supports Trump. Should we paint all Trump supporters with that brush?  Why not try to actually listen to what the reasonable voices in each party are asking for? Or does that not get you airtime on FoxNews?

trump doesn’t even know where Main Street is! Every time he coos about the stock market reassures me he is still in bed with Wall Street while Main Street has been sent out to get him lunch.
The system is in place, legal and safe.  You may not like it, but that doesn’t mean it is broken.  trump certainly will try and break it, because that is what he does.
You obviously haven’t noticed, if trump would have handled 2020’s issues as they occurred, we wouldn’t be where we are today.  FYI he still isn’t handling them.
Thinking about tariffs on Canadian aluminum for example. So trump “punishes” them with tariffs because their aluminum is less expensive than ours, driving price up (because we the consumer will end up paying for tariff).  Shouldn’t goal be to make things more affordable not less?
Would the political trends we've seen in the Trump era occur under any GOP President? It's an interesting thought experiment and a question that can't be answered.
2018 granted Democrats a reprieve in southwestern Washington but the trends seem to be accelerating this year. Trump has accelerated changes that were going on slowly before.
FYI, bcs you REALLY seem to be lacking any, Dems serve in our military to protect this country too. We definitely don't need right wing nut jobs like you defending us from anything. Just in case you're not bright enough to know this, Trump can't wave a magic want for your

Of course Trump would not have the authority to do that, the Internal Revenue Code including deductions was enacted and is amended by Congress, but it's not like that's ever prevented Trump from announcing he'll do something like that.

Don't get the Republican desire to get Biden on the debate stage. It's not like Trump is a great debater or doesn't have a habit of saying controversial things.

If you’re voting for Joe Biden you might actually be a racist 👀 Unlike the Trump supporters you tried to peg that on in 2016
I know who &amp; what Trump and Biden are. If you don't at this point you won't be capable of evaluating a debate. I think Biden will mop the floor w/ Trump, but even if Biden comes out &amp; curls up in a fetal ball on stage I'll vote for him. Trump is a plague upon us, literally.

Trump=158,445
Trump=158,445 deaths
Did they dissolve it or did Trump after realizing that he wouldn't be able to run it the way he wanted (as a scam to fill his pockets)?
Like I said, Jon Stewart more than anyone popularized the notion that politics should be entertaining and that there was no sense in even listening to what the other side had to say. He was the precursor for Trump.
That much everyone seems to agree on. Trump is definitely down from 2016 but nothing shows Biden leading. I know Democrats are polling the general election for the House race. I simply don't buy that Republicans aren't. It doesn't make sense.
Real News.
My source further elaborates that he has not seen anything from Republicans showing a Biden lead. Possible this is an unweighted poll though (before they weight it to match the electorate). Outside groups have done polling here and they match campaign. Trump down from 16.

Nobody should be out and about amongst people right now. We’re in the middle of a deadly pandemic and Joe is in the age bracket of high concern.   Are you trying to make an excuse for why the Trump campaign photoshopped this ?

My concern would be for younger voters, regardless of race. Might vote for Kanye as a joke when they would have voted for Biden out of hatred for Trump. I’m just speculating though. I hope young voters would be serious about 2020 elections though. 🤞🏻
It’s truly disgusting. Why not retire &amp; spend the rest of their days being cozy?? &amp; I can’t believe we don’t have a nonpartisan something in place 2 make sure candidates are mentally healthy. Trump, Kanye and Biden may all be mentally compromised. We know they’re not totally well
If he gets away with everything he did (and Bernie) against Hillary, I don’t see it being beneficial. Trump makes his own rules. Answers whatever he wants for as long as he wants. I don’t think he actually answered a real question in 2016. Just says what he wants. And stalked her

Perhaps in the bunker... or else behind the new high riot walks that are being built all around the White House. Which would be more appropriate in the bunker or behind the trump wall being erected all around the White House. Thoughts? Perhaps they can phone bank from there too!With Donald Trump being the example of a president people my age have been handed, and the ever looming threat of neoliberalism hanging over my head, I come into this new twitter account hoping to shed light on some of the issues that matter most to me.

as a republican now for over 3 decades what u see in this racist traitor Trump movement isn't Republican.. It's Russian backed racism! For a decade Trump laundered money with Russia hoping to get a Trump tower in Moscow,Trump running for president was Putin's idea
these racist r putting these racist congressmen forward,they run straight to Russian owned Fox news, they start promoting misinformation and Trump lies he's gotten from Q or Breitbart.If we need a civil war to get these racist out let's do it now.Only gets worse
wake up racist. Stop covering for a Russian asset.When traitor Trump's taxes hit&amp;we finally learn how in debt to Russia he is everyone of u traitor Trump racist need to be put right beside him.U have enabled this traitor for racist needs!Ur not a republican either

Same goes with trump, you are clearly not proving a point. And I can tell you for sure that trump has been in Epstein’s island. And I definitely agree with you ab Joe biden. Both of them are pedos.!

It's a Rasmussen poll, yes? Just commissioned by the Hinckley Institute.
This confusion would be avoided if people actually show up to vote in public.
Message to voters Joe Biden is a modern day Don Quixote thinking that windmills are Trump monsters in The Windmills of his mind. When it comes to some of his policies like economics covid-19 and Law and Order in other words is a crooked politician.

The ,Clinton Foundation is the greatest charity around the world. They never used it to steal money from children's cancer research like the trump foundation was convicted in a court of law. Stealing money from children is DESPICABLE!

Hate to hurt your feelings but these studies were done from Black Folks &amp; anyone can do a study! I was a hardcore Democrat but it's this kind of bull that made me switch, I am not a Trump supporter but I'm tired of seeing blacks killing black kids
Clinton paid for and gave the fake dossie to FBI knowing it was all fake...Muller was supposed to prove Russia/Trump collusion not be an expensive democrat fishing experience...you believe what you want, I know the truth and as a unaffiliated voter I'm not blinded by party lines
Actually Joe wants to abolish police &amp; 85% of Americans want to keep them. He called police enemies of the people. Trump stands for law enforcement. Joe is demented. It was very rude to ask the reporter if he took a drug test for cocaine &amp; call him a junkie. It sounds racist.
Cooper's destroying the state. Phase 3 begins Nov 4 with Trump reelection and Gov(Elect) Dan Forest.
This Navy veteran will also not vote for Trump this November.#Biden2020
if Democrats were REALLY concerned that Trump might not accept the election results, they would do whatever they could to ensure integrity so that they have the public on their side if it does happen. Instead, they're actually worried that Trump won't quietly allow them to cheat.
Canada dude, but yes Trump Supporters are mentally unstable.
But will he beat Trump *and* Putin? 🤷🏽‍♀️🤷🏽‍♀️🤷🏽‍♀️

Michelle Obama says she is "dealing with some form of low-grade depression" due to the Trump Administration. #ObamaBidenGate
I think if the DNC had a better candidate than Biden and Trump would be toast. If Obama could run again, Trump would never had won in 2016.
Michelle Obama says she is "dealing with some form of low-grade depression" due to the Trump Administration. that should rule her out.
You can thank Pelosi ...just like she sabatoged the first bill for weeks with her drama queen over reaction...Trump knew she would do it again making herself look ridiculous and unnessacary...now he can simply do it himself and take all the credit
#Facebook deletes a #Trump post for the first time, citing #coronavirus misinformation
I find it funny how people look for any little thing they didn’t like hearing out of a trump interview just to slander him bc that’s “the thing” to do these days seems like. Yet these same people think joe Biden is fit to be president talking about kids touching his leg hairs 🤔
I know who I am, my picture is me. You are a new account late 2019 spreading propaganda. Any true service member remembers his oath and would recognize Trump for the traitor he is

I hate Trump supporters with a passion.
86 president trump November 3 #8645113
At this point who would even vote for trump in this upcoming election? Even the most crazed trump supporter must face the facts that this man had no idea what he was doing the past 4 years and another 4 years would undoubtedly result in the destruction of democracy itself
Only when it applies to a Trump property!
Trump was right though. Case survival rate is more important than overall infected count, govt can't control people.
anyone who chooses not to see biden is suffering from dementia is a dummy and trump is just stupid. How can unvote for anyone of these candidates?
That was  , Trump aced it ! Pay attention libs !
Americans better wake up! If this isn’t showing us how it would be if Biden gets elected then their crazier than I thought! You don’t have to be a Trump Lover but my gosh who wants to live in a country where your afraid to go to sleep at night !

Is that why Zuckerbot had Trump ban tiktok?
I knew zuckerbot was going to benefit from trump banning tiktok.  I just figured it was going to be negotiations with Microsoft would fail, then FB buys it.
Its Biden not Bidden...and apparently you haven't watched any interviews where Trump maintains that "we are doing good"? Do you think our country is doing ok? Do you think other countries are laughing at us? Do you think he handled this virus the best he could? Are you ok?
To the woman that came in PF wearing a Trump/Blue Lives Matter mask, you wear in the judgement free zone. That's the ONLY reason I ain't say shit!

Sorry, Mnuchin is full BS. He knows it, you know it, we know it. He is punishing 90% to cut the benits of the 10% who might be overpaid. Destroy 100% to eliminate the 10%. This is typical trump logical.  this whole group needs to be excised!
trump doesn't appear to understand how bad his Con game is.
"This can only be accomplished by president trump, by a business man in the white house".  Where does trump find these lackies?

Civil rights attorney blasts Democratic Party: 'They believe every Black man has to vote for them'
The same is going to happen in the US! Because they will blame it on Trump &amp; will not share ownership in raising their children!
Ask J. Hill she hates Trump, ask her why people of color don’t want their children not to wear mask because she makes it a Racial barrier!
What’s so sad is whatever Trump says they will put his response as a racist remark. It doesn’t matter just look around I’m not the only one &amp; I know everyone is looking at the people wearing Mask, hell they are bringing their kids out into stores “No Mask” getting their 40’s
Damn shame I’m not a Trump supporter &amp; the virus has nothing to do with him! I have witnessed so many kids with 2-3 children that have no business trying to raise kids &amp; your going to try to send them to school, tell the parents it doesn’t work like that! Educate kids  home!
Blame it on Trump! When I don’t even support him ! But the ones I noticed not wearing mask &amp; their 3-4 kids are not Trump supporters! I have gone to stores just taking head counts of the demographics of the people not wearing a mask, of course if I say the truth I’d be a Racist
You should get one of  classic Trump memes printed on it, just saying in my opinion
Despite #COVID19 outbreaks, family separations are still happening. Kids are still in cages. Kids are still "missing" somewhere in the DHS system. Asylum-seeking families are not criminals. #CrueltyIsThePoint #FamiliesBelongTogether #TrumpIsTheVirus

Very true. Trump would chew him up. Not his fault. Dementia is a sad disease. For his family to allow this to be done to him is down right sad. Biden is being used in the worst way...by his family.

If that were true their deaths would be as high as ours or higher. Testing gives us a chance to save lives. People who refuse to wear masks and social distance is what’s driving numbers up. Two things Trump dissed 1/

LOL, every time Trump interrupts with "wrong" or straight up insults someone without making a point, drink. Every time Biden forgets what his point was mid sentence, or puts his foot in his mouth, drink.

More than enough to run on now. #Trump &amp; #Republicans flailing. Why give anyone material to distract from utter disaster we have now?
Those behaviors don’t make him a racist? COM! If W had made the same series of statements, the left would be screaming racist. For Trump, if he clears his throat they yell racist. So why does Biden, with his lousy record, get a pass?
At this point, it practically does, seeing how trump corrupted the party to an unrecognizable shadow of its former self.

No offense but that same bill that Trump signed, stalled in the Senate when Pres.Obama was in office, for like 4 years. They didn’t want to give Obama another signature piece of legislation to sign. Republicans played politics with people’s lives.

I can’t believe he didn’t walk out on the interview! I’m talking about Trump, of course. Ok, Swan probably wanted to walk out too.....
I think the sad part is this “whataboutism”” he displays. John Lewis was a Civil Rights icon. History will remember him with glowing praise. Trump will be remembered as a incompetent B-rated reality star, who became President because of his innate ability to drum white grievances
Trump’s  interview shows how unqualified he is for this moment.   In a moment where our country needs leadership and competence, he has neither.   Donald Trump is an empty suit.
Trump keeps saying things like “the virus is getting better!” or whatever — but in all our daily lives we see that’s blatantly not true.
This is Trump in a nutshell.

I been watching  my whole life decided to try something new   they are the true haters. They love trump
the majority of Americans cant wait to see trump dragged from the White House kicking and screaming like the little girl he is 😂😂😂😂
President Biden should pardon Donald Trump, this way he is reduced to a memory, a distant reminder of when we hated, when we were scared, when we lacked hope and were sick.  When we were divided and were fearful, no more, now hopeful and now turning a new corner, together.
President Biden’s first course of action:  pardon Donald J Trump.   This way we can move on, relinquishing him and his awful being, his lies, his divisiveness to the footnotes of a bad memory, a miserable experience, hopefully to never be repeated.
I just don’t understand the logic because Trump calls a lot of people lo IQ of all races. Probably more often to white folks.
I dare you
And this is what they aimed at: collapse and bankruptcy of businesses so they can blame Trump, it's all about their attempts to see that he is not reelected, no matter who gets hurt!
President Biden’s first action should be to pardon Donald Trump.  This will allow our country to move on, forgetting him and his reign of incompetence and division.
President Biden’s first action should be to grant immunity to Donald Trump.  This will allow country to heal, move on and forget him and his reign of incompetence, division and terror.
Donald Trump Challenges Nevada Mail-in Voting Stunt: ‘See You in Court!‘  via   I sent the solution last night:
Republicans and President Trump needs to watch how they handle this because people do you know what they were told to do work wise and If he and the Republicans doesn’t do the right thing this could hurt Republicans in November and I definitely don’t want to see that.
Thus making the claim that Trump supporters are a "silent" majority rather absurd, no?
You know im not a fan of trump myself but holy shit is this just not productive. Why instead of dance say what you dont like about the dude.
I agree with if all the businesses will open up.I know people right now even with the 600 that is not making more than they were making when they were working. They want to go back to work We all know people vote on how their finances are &amp; I do not want this to hurt Trump.
and 14 percent of those ages 45 to 64 who are registered to vote have a favorable opinion of Trump. By contrast, 21 percent of black voters ages 18 to 29 and 29 percent of black voters ages 30 to 44 have a favorable view of the president. In addition, there is also a notable age
This CNA is right behind you in voting Trump out of office! Let’s go!
Trump is slightly more popular among younger black Americans That’s not just because younger voters tend to be indecisive this many months out from the election. Trump is somewhat more popular with younger black Americans than with their elders. Just 9 percent of black seniors
Isn’t it ironic how you cannot tell the difference between a Trump supporter and that Russian woman from Florida.
I know some people are making more money that they would be making if they were working. But I would say that the majority probably are not. Besides that I believe it will hurt the economy if they stopped then also it would hurt Trump In November.
I would say that all the liberal media outlets have been unfair to the president since he came down the escalator in trump tower. Liberals scoff at the term fake news but they constantly face plant every time. The whole Russian collusion hoax has been factually proven a hoax...
Chris Wallace is the worst. He is a democrat not a Republican. He asked harder questions to Trump that these 2 idiots running for VP with Biden
Some dimwit made a gigantic leap and called my mom a pedophile. All she did was ask how the doctor that Trump supports and claims that demon semen is a thing got her doctorate in America.   Trump supporters are on some serious cultist drugs or something, I swear
There is a cure. It's called Trump 2020.
Dangerous Evangelical. He's as bad as Trump but smarter.
You are crying into the wind of Trump and Republican conduct, that is drowning out your message.   I strongly agree with you, but you need to get the herd of cats in your own administration on board FIRST.
If you think progressive white males don’t love Trump secretly you’re delusional. If he wasn’t so openly racist and a bigot they would support him because of “economic populism” and anti-establishment rhetoric “ they love trumps policies but hate he isn’t politically correct”. 😑
More blockage of the Trump Man!
This is truly a sad sight to see. U don't know that trump didn't want blacks in his apartments in the 60s and 70s he was delivered a class action suit for violation of the fair housing act against blacks? Sad. U promote a man who hates ur skin
What u did to Fauci was a joke,  shame on u. If only 7 had such passion grilling trump on his failures to contain covid. Every other country is doing much better except ours bc of u and ur fascist party.
You do realize that Trump is the reason we are in this situation?? And  I love the fact that y'all are so intimidated by a real woman and leader. 150,000 dead because your leader has no idea how to lead. Take your bullshit somewhere else
In your dreams - TRUMP 2020!!!!!!!!!!!  In a landslide!
Dictator (wanna be) Trump, you are wrong.   You continue to display your ignorance.  The underlying level of disease is higher because you failed to lead a unified response.  You continue to fail at leadership, causing increasing damage to the economy.
Why is Trump involved with the sale at all?
You mean the Surgeon General that Trump put in place?? Your argument is invalid!

if trump was gonna ban tiktok than he shouldve done it already
I'd vote for a ketchup bottle over Trump.
Trolling? We don’t have time for trolling Stefanie. You and Trump need to grow up. It’s serious out here. Real life. People are dying!
Sorry you feel that way Erin. Trump really has done a lot of great stuff for our country. I hope you’ll research prior to voting and I hope you feel more empowered soon because we live in the greatest country on earth and u deserve it!!  God Bless You!
I was not a Trump fan and didn’t vote for him in 16. I’ve done a lot of research of what this administration has done and learned a lot about the DS. Trump has earned my vote. Please research before voting. 🙏🏻
Trump would rather worry about banning tikok rather than schools opening during Covid. What a joke #tiktokban #tiktok
But what do I know I'm just some guy on the internet sitting back peeping shit. To each his own; everybody has to play their role &amp; yours just happens to be the 🤡. You wear it a lot better than me. Hold your breath while taking that Donald Trump face&amp;#*!&amp;!* that what it is now😉
Just for him to come out, take a shit on, &amp; wipe his ass with that too! But because you CHOOSE to make Dem your enemy to avoid blaming yourself for your failures at life or because you're scared of ppl that think differently than you.
You Trump supporters are so funny because  took a shet than wiped his fat lumpy ass with it EVERYTHING you guys once considered sacred! Then y'all have to defend it! That the part that's so funny that it's sad! The way you have to twist yourselves. Continue↪
Trump's not going after him. Of all the times to bite his tongue smh
I'd trade Trump going to jail for Clinton admitting he did this
Like Trump Casinos, Trump Air, Trump Steaks, USA GDP down 32% Q2.  Gotcha.
Trump is the greatest disaster in history.
If Trump rallies and other events spread #COVID, then Black Lives Matter rallies are too
I remember when you Trump supporters used to act like the most important thing in your life was the Constitution🤔. 🤷🏽That is of course until  decided to wipe his hairy ass with it! He wipes his hairy ass with everything you once held sacred &amp; you defend it🤦🏽!

If the Republican party is willing to go along and repeat Trump's lies defying Fauci, and conspiracy theories, of course, people will believe Trump and the GOP would falsify data to quicken the use of a vaccine; Trump's already lying about an effective treatment.
Scalise remarks are political and kissing Trump's ring on his finger...
My Trump supporter friends are mad because I removed them from my facebook. Im sorry but I can sit there in smile in your face knowing you worship a racist demon... am I wrong ?
Have you filed your taxes by mail?  Utah, Colorado, Washington, Oregon and Hawaii have had vote- by-mail for years.  You want me to believe voting by mail won’t work?   Both Bush 2 &amp; Trump set up commissions to “expose” voter fraud only to disband them when they found zippo.
Understandable, but again, I didn’t retweet the original post for Trump supporters 👍🏻
That’s a lie I got my first two homes under the Obama administration...The housing market is soaring back until Trump..Even though the interest rates are low no homes are being built no neighborhoods are being built....Which drives up housing prices not to mention loaning issues.

I don’t deny that..But David Duke and the KKK support the Republican nominee, The alt-right, you know the group who was saying “Jews will not replace us”? &amp; most other white Supremacists support Donald Trump. The party of the confederate flag &amp; states rights when it suits them.
Yes I'm voting for Trump Concord North Carolina
I agree. But this all sure seems like Trump is expecting to lose regardless. He knows ALL those polls can’t be fake...
Well, either plausible deniability or just not trusting him to keep his mouth shut. If it was your job to guard a huge secret like that, would you hand that info over to a loose cannon like Trump?

I am so disturbed over these actions by Trump.
So these people are using rapid tests just to come in and cheer Trump. We have to wait weeks to get back a test , And my son has to go into a public school and work, no tests available.
I bet the schools magically open after President Trump signs an EO stopping payroll Tax deductions.
OFFS. Biden could pick a paper bag for VP and his administration would still be INFINITELY better than Trump nation. Don’t look for excuses. It’s inexcusable.
So much for Trump The PopulistTM, I guess?
President Trump has ordered a sweeping but vague ban on dealings with the Chinese owners of social media apps TikTok and WeChat. But what is WeChat, and why is it so controversial?
😂🤣 I asked Alexa this question an hour ago and shes still naming things...its definitely less time consuming to answer, what has Trump done to gain my respect? (If I get a second stimulus that will be 2 things😂)
The orders take effect in 45 days and could bar the popular apps from the Apple and Google app stores, effectively removing them from U.S. distribution.

Oh just ridiculous. Can’t wait to see Biden own Trump reciting Bible verses.
I'm sorry, his veep could be Mickey F-ing Mouse and he has my vote. In fact, I’d vote Mickey for POTUS over Trump. You have to be out of your mind at this point thinking the veep pick is critical to not putting Trump back in office for another disastrous 4 years.
I'm considering giving up on tweeting my music etc and just devoting this Twitter account to only replying "oh god this dumb fuck" to every video clip of Trump I see.  That could be my "thing." #thursdayvibes #ThursdayThoughts #VoteBidenToSaveAmerica  #VoteBlue

From a President standpoint, can someone actually tell me what Trump has done to be so hated? Or is it just because his name?
The difference is, people who voted for trump don’t hate people who didn’t 🤷🏼‍♂️

Nothing says “I’m an idiot” like President Trump.
Not only is trump acking like a moron...(I say act because he cant be that dumb) he supports christianity. Thats the worst part but they won't let a candidate who is openly atheist become president.
Just asking for someone to back up their assumptions that I suspect are likely inaccurate and based solely on a hunch. Also, I'm not a big Trump fan. I left that spot blank in 2016. But you've revealed that maybe your medical opinions are swayed by politics, not science?

Female Trump supporters? Listening?Trump insisted in a new interview that he really does wish accused sex abuser Ghislaine Maxwell "well": “Her friend, or boyfriend, was either killed or committed suicide in jail. She’s now in jail. Yeah, I wish her well."
Months and months ago the Department of Homeland security put out warnings about it.  They banned all of their employees from using it over security concerns. Later they made a second announcement to the public. Now Trump is taking action against it due to security concerns.
As an American who gives 2 fucks less about the political scene. Trump seemed to be the better answer as opposed to the murderous, war starting, pedophile Hillary. Can you see why now?
I'm sure just another trump donor.
See how politicians and advocacy groups reacted in posts and videos as President Donald Trump signed legislation to spend nearly $3 billion a year on conservation, outdoor recreation, national parks and other public lands.
Time for the White House to withdraw and President Trump should sign Orders for to stop all payroll tax deductions through January 15th
oh shit i almost forgot FUCK TRUMP
#Trump is definitely one of America's worst presidents!
Andrew Jackson was a horrible and cruel president...no wonder trump admires this slave owning, sadist. Can we please get his face off the $20 bill? 😂
I see that Trump is doubling down on his support for Ghislaine Maxwell. What does she have on him? Will we see another Presidential Pardon?
During an interview with Axios, President Trump questioned whether Jeffrey Epstein actually killed himself, while also reiterating that he didn’t want to see Ghislaine Maxwell die in jail.
A $5,000 dollar reward is being offered to identify the culprit who put a ‘Trump 2020’ sticker on a bear’s collar in North Carolina.

That sounds very Trump

I think you're right.   All due respect to  the GOP was dead the moment they decided Trump was their man. The party should be allowed to die in its current incarnation. They became the very thing they've claimed to be against.
You know good and well if it was trump shit would be all over the place

I think I'm still contemplating these things as though Trump did NOT fundamentally change the landscape of politics in America.  That my be coloring my outlook slightly.  Goddamn, that's fucking depressing...😑
With 92 days until Election Day, here's what we're watching heading into a new week in the 2020 campaign:
I don't think Trump will be forced to leave the White House in January.  If Biden wins, I suspect he will leave the White House the next day.  Being a Lame-Duck president would be torture for him.  Thoughts?

When Trump post QAnon bullshit that glorifies anti masking, how can governors be expected to make the idiots in their states wear masks.
did you even read that tweet? The reason given for not debating Trump is that he has already given a documented 20K lies...he's not going to debate...he'll just lie like the SOS he is.
Cause Trump* is such a man of god
And I’m sorry but I no article will convince me different. I went to Royal Palm Beach High School from 2003-2006 were I knew of at least 20 plus girls who were 15-17 years old and were paid on multiple occasions to attend Trump and Epstein’s private events at Mar-a-Lago.
Did you even read that article? Lol first off it starts by saying Trump ALLEGEDLY banned Epstein from Mar-a-Lago. Also he cooperated after years of knowing and hosting events with Epstein with dozens of underage girls in attendance. They’re all pervs.
If your message is targeted at Trump or his supporters, you shouldn't use math. They don't understand that.
Don't cry. But I have over this idiotic country. Every democrat needs to follow these instructions: Grab Lip, pull it over ur head, then swallow. Lol. My humorous way to deal 😄🇺🇸Trump/Pence 2020

Trump has always been a leader. The Dems don’t like him because he is a leader which they are not.
He didn’t kick Epstein out of anything?  They were hanging out in Palm Beach leading up to the announcement of Trump running for president. I know this because my uncle worked at Trumps golf course.
The servers for the U.S. marker reside here, and are managed by an independent entity of American employees. Trump just doesn't like that his Tulsa rally was sullied, and that Sarah Cooper lip syncs what he says.

January 20th is a constitutional hard stop for the Trump/Pence administration.  They can cancel the election, but all that will do is guarantee that Nancy Pelosi becomes our 1st Female President on January 20th.
It’s not funny. It’s true. It’s exactly how people in my area would talk about trump.
I’d move Moscow Mitch up. He gave us Trump with his SCOTUS antics.
That would indicate that Trump has any leadership qualities. He doesn’t.
I will vote Trump

I am comforted by their presence. I’m sure Jimmy Carter would be there if he could. Trump would have tainted this precious occasion.

Well, to be fair his staff did the plagiarizing. Biden is just a puppet at this point who just reads off of the prompter. They wont let Biden answer questions because he has put his foot in his mouth so much he has athlete tongue.
Biden wants us to wear masks for 3 months minimum. So, right up to the election. Coincidence?
In case there’s the slightest chance Kamala becomes the Vice President, let me be the first to say: Biden didn’t kill himself
Most republicans don’t even like trump and most democrats don’t like Biden or Kamala how did we choose them as our main characters
The Biden/Harris campaign need to address the attack on our law enforcement. Explain that “defunding” police departments is not gonna happen. There may be some restructuring measures recommended but not defunding.
Imagine that. Guess she is using the same speech writers as Joe Biden
"Just go" is right. Because in what universe does Joe Biden and Kamala Harris embrace the far left? They're about as moderate as democrats get.
Sorry bitch Kamala, obama Biden era was NOT the greatest recovery. When I apply for ANY job employers bite at the bit, during that time I COULDNT GET A JOB SHOVELING SHIT ..  your a L I A R !
Awesome roll out with Biden-Harris just now! They sound like the President-VP America deserves after all this mess from the last 4 years.  I'm going to volunteer in my area of NC. Gotta carry this state! So excited!
This isnt Joe Biden he is on TV live and he is not on his phone
I knew Joe Biden didn't do his own tweets. This one was sent while he was on TV introducing his VP pick.  Look at the time from my twitter page and TV.
LOL if you guys wanted her so bad why didn’t you guys vote for her? Just remember she believes Joe Biden‘s accuser’s and indirectly called him a racist personally I thought the last three in the debates would’ve been Biden Sanders and Harris

Wrong, your boy has been trying for 40 years.
Though Biden has previously supported nationwide mask-wearing, he specified his call in remarks earlier Thursday, saying that every American should wear a mask when they're in public for the next three months "at a minimum" and every governor should make it a mandate immediately.
Nothing will stop me from voting for Joe Biden and Kamala Harris.
But the choice is one or the other.  A reasonable centrist vs an inept lying science rejecting person who is ruining our country.  BTW- the Biden suggestion for a mask mandate was for in public outdoor settings.

TIL (on Facebook) that the Biden Harris official platform is to destroy America, and the post was also #factchecked so it’s definitely true.
So is everybody just gonna forget how Harris spent the past year continuously harshing Biden? She has called him racist and has made it known that didn’t think he was mentally capable of handling the job. But I guess kissing up to the winner is what you do when you lose.
Thank god #Biden is out of the basement and spinning some shit against trump. #BidenHarris2020
Your og tweet certainly didn't sound like a "this is good strategy" tweet. It sounded like a "this is why Biden is good" tweet.

Trump is not a racist, he has implemented laws to help blacks.  Unlike Joe Biden &amp; Democrats who grandstand for black votes, Trump walks the walk, not talk.
Amazing. Biden picks someone who challenged him. Look forward to a Cabinet meeting that doesn't look North Korean with all the slobbery praise. Trump is fucked and you know it.
I bet you would, then you’ll have someone, or in this case the same person to blame if Biden follows Hillary’s establishment campaign playbook and loses as well
Still voting Biden, I was unhappy to before, but I'm fucking depressed about it now. So many exceptional women, several of colour, and Biden goes with the cop who has an awful record in sentencing reforms, unjust penalties, and prison labor. Also iffy on LGBT.

I will be voting for Biden/Harris ONLY to get him out of office. However, I still think it’s critical to discuss the problems with them, and the DNC/democratic establishment. Them &amp; republicans are two sides of the same coin. They are all to the right. They are not progressive.
That's not his laptop either. That is a left handed persons laptop. Biden is right handed.
That not is laptop either. That is a left handed persons laptop. Biden is right handed.
They tryna figure a way to guarantee that man a win. They know people following Biden cause of Obama now they gonna get the women to vote for em too
Team Trump  August 11, 2020  With Kamala Harris as Joe Biden's ‘political living will,’ he is surrendering control of our nation to the radical mob with promises to raise taxes, cut police funding, kill energy jobs and open our borders.
Kamala Harris is  Biden's pick for Vise President
Guess Joe Biden would have waved a magic wand and made all the correct decesions in the moment.   All the bureaucratic obstacles would have gone away. The bad advice would have suddenly been good. The political considerations would have disappeared.

I agree the response was bad.  That was implicit in what I said. My point was that I think Biden would have also fumbled the response and I don't know any convincing reason he wouldn't have had
Man Biden picked Kamala to be his running mate🤦🏾‍♂️ tryna make sure he sucka folks into voting for him...
AMERICA do not vote for Biden! Biden needs to be in the nearest rest home.
CNN is out of their mind! You better talk about Biden being off his rocker and help folks NOT VOTE FOR HIM!
I'd love to hear what part of the federal response would have been clearly better under Biden.
I'm pretty skeptical of the idea that the COVID response would have been much better-- or even any better-- under Biden
Bernie, love you, but Biden has said multiple times he’d veto M4A if it crossed his desk. Having Kamala as his VP will not change that.
Joe Biden &amp; Kamala Harris on ONE TICKET ‼️‼️‼️ Let’s vote #DreamTeam

Biden choosing Harris for vp
She's nasty and a bully....she showed her cowardness against Kavanaugh and cut Joe Biden's legs off at the knees.  But this is how female Democrats act....an embarrassment to Americans.
So basically they want Biden to follow the  playbook of thinking Twitter is real life?
Great big sale coming.  I like that. Go Biden.
Accurate. Biden in a ghost candidate. Kampala will be potus?! INSANITY
Choosing Kamala Harris is Joe Biden’s Sister Souljah moment. He hopes, anyway.
i·ro·ny  /ˈīrənē/  noun  Definition: Trump supporters complaining that Harris wasn't a good pick because she's "not the most qualified".  #Trump #Biden #KamalaHarris #VPPick
She’s basically like Biden bro lol we don’t like her but she will have to do I guess. She’s a cop. She does nothing when her people constantly ask her to act on the police killings. She doesn’t prosecute killer cops sadly
A Biden and Harris ticket definitely gets a vote from me.
So Kamala Harris is Biden’s #VPPick   To suggest that Indian diaspora in America who were shepherd by Modi towards:   “Aik Bar Phir,  #Trump Sarkar”   will be conflicted, as #Kamala, is of Indian descent, would be an understatement.

I think Biden is going to choose either Rice, Warren. or Harris, I think any three will make a great VP pick for America.

Wow, Biden can predict the future. That or the perpetuating a fraud. How does he know what will be going on with the virus in Jan 2021. Just a bunch of BS propaganda to distract you from things like #BidenIsARacist
Perhaps there is a misunderstanding. It seems you are saying I don’t think black people are equals after I just said I want Rice for VP. To clarify, there are many qualified black women so it’s a difficult choice for Biden. We need her foreign relations, et al experience.

You point out the truth to moron Biden voters and they block you. I love it.
yah right
Biden is a liar.
I wouldn't question Mr. Biden's faith....but he is in camp with the anti-Christian religion and anti-family Democrats.
Get your dad to release his taxes, so we can know if he has been bribed.  Also, Biden won't hire his kids for WH jobs....
I do.  This will be a financial disaster for a lot of people if they don’t play football and I’m not buying that’s it’s our fault for not wearing masks like we should have.  That’s the next Joe Biden TV ad.
Liberals want to shut down the season so they can blame conservatives for the poor handling of the virus.  Look now we can’t have football because Trump didn’t handle this right.  These idiots wouldn’t wear masks and look now. It’s an ad for Biden.
Biden's wish list.

Truth Is, Biden Never Had a Firm Grip on Reality
Only Hidenbiden is keeping low ......Quid pro Quo Biden is keeping quite.

Shouldn't part of your #BREAKING be that this is already in effect? Y'know the ACA? Passed under Obama &amp; Biden?
Of course neither Iran nor China want President Trump to win! He spent the last term kicking butt in the trade war and in the nuclear issue with Iran. They would much rather have one of the more incompetent candidates win *cough * Biden *cough*
Yes he did. #VoteOutRacism

Are you perfectly fine with Biden not knowing how to do anything?
I am sorry but Biden doesn’t even know what a tweet is.
Are you pushing 100% to support Biden?So let me get this straight, if someone full on supports Biden, they’re “mislead” but if they full on support Trump, they’re “right”?  So where does that leave someone who think both are lunatics? And why is this the case?
Monica, I totally get it. I’m giving Biden/Harris two years to show me something substantive. If nothing happens in the administration to decrease the wealth gap between blacks and whites, I’ll be voting Green Party for the rest of my life.
I agree - NOPE TO BIDEN!!!
Just throwing this out there. Why is Biden not taking questions?!? Is he under a gag order and being the state of his health, it’s better to silence him then risk the outburst of him violating this order?!? 🤔🤫🤐🇺🇸
Of course! Get Biden out before he screws something else up! When he opens his mouth...his dementia is obvious! They are so transparent!
I felt the same today and I donated to The Biden/Harris campaign and felt a little better. I also went to the liquor store 🤷🏼‍♀️
PaPaw Biden lmao 🤣 that’s what we should call him!
I think  summed it up the best. Who gives us the best chance to expand civil rights? Act on climate change? Protect consumers? Close the wealth gap? In my book, that’s Biden and Harris. And I’ll push like hell to make sure they deliver. If not, they’ll be primaried

Mass has supermajorities in both houses and they could have made Baker pick a Dem.  I wish Warren would have won and would have been picked but I don't think the moment gave Biden the room to pick her. I would bet he wanted to.

The DNC and Jill Biden are horrible people putting Joe Biden in this position.  He is clearly mentally deteriorating ever week.
I'm more concerned by her limited qualifications and "on the record" opposition with Biden.   In addition, Biden excluded 93% of the population by using race &amp; gender as a prerequisite for the job.  How is this acceptable??
3 new national polls of registered voters were released today, with Biden leading by 10, 11 &amp; 13 points, all taken before the Harris VP announcement. Now you know why Trump is illegally destroying the USPS &amp; attacking voting by mail.
This is a really good piece by  about the Obama-Biden relationship, which was always a lot more complicated and tense than the fantasy version of it.
Ideally this won't be resolved this year, and with no leadership and voiding all the horrible things done, we can have a humane approach in the Biden/Harris administration.

Good point. I think conclusions about not having a policy mandate are difficult to make in polls that demand only one response. This one simply shows that getting Trump out of office is the highest priority for Biden voters.
Not sure you can reach this conclusion from a poll that requires you to select only one response. Getting Trump out of office is the highest priority for those voting for Biden. Full stop.
Trump, Biden tied in NC heading into this month’s nominating conventions #ncpol
Kamala supports forced gun confiscation. Choosing her has moved the Biden campaign further to the left on gun control – more radical than any other major party campaign in recent history. Kamala’s baggage has damaged the perception that Biden is a more moderate Democrat. #2A
As a survivor of CSA and rape, I am FAR more offended by this adult woman’s interactions WITH A CHILD than I am by anything Joe Biden has ever been proven to have done with anyone. She *deliberately* and continually crossed lines with this kid. That’s appalling.
TBC - "GO VOTE" means any way that doesn't rely on the mail delivering stuff. Biden better fix the USPS - one of our great institutions.
I think if we frame it as an anti-Republican thing that would help Biden we could fool them into supporting it
But it doesn’t matter if Biden loses 10% because of voter suppression. Trump can win this if nothing is done about him blocking voting from every direction.  With what I see, I think Trump will “win” and this is all so depressing.

Since we are comparing circumstances, Bernie wasn’t a realistic alternative after Super Tuesday. The momentum shifted and Biden clearly claimed victory. Polling and votes were against him.
I'm less concerned by her temperament than her qualifications.  In addition, Biden excluded 93% of the population by using race &amp; gender as a prerequisite for the job.  How is this acceptable?
Kamala Harris, Joe Biden's newly minted running mate, told The  Politics Podcast last year that the next DOJ would have "no choice" but to act.  Biden has said that pursuing criminal charges against Trump would be "a very, very unusual thing."
"Americans are accustomed, still, to discussing the notion of a woman in power in terms of toleration and palatability."

47 years of zero and I mean zero accomplishments. He's had 1 job his entire life.  What new and fresh ideas will Biden bring to the table??   Stock market will hit an all time high this week.  TRUMP
He is an absolute sellout; and Biden has zero dignity
Biden is absolutely screwed
No, 3+ years apart.  However, Biden has been milking America for 47 years! Numb nuts...
Trump shouldn’t even be allowed to run. He’s. Heated the entire time staring w/Giuliani digging up dirt on Biden in Ukraine, to Kushner colluding with Kanye for a bogus ballot run and Trump slowing down the postal service. He’s a dirt bag and a cheat!
I have a bunch of examples of what Biden has done and said—none of them positive. I remember, even though he probably doesn’t. 😉
Exactly! Someone (political blue check) said a desperate candidate asks for more debates. Hoping Biden denies and he can attack him for it? 🤷🏻‍♀️
Biden has nothing to gain by debating Trump. Nothing at all. He's already in the lead. When someone asks for an additional debate (the Trump camp just did) it means they know their candidate is tanking. That said, Trump won't do any, let alone four.
"He inherited the longest economic expansion in history from Barack Obama and Joe Biden. And then, like everything else he inherited, he ran it straight into the ground." -  🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I was sad for about 10 days after Warren dropped out of the race.   Then I dusted myself off and put on my big boy boots, because Trump is that bad.   If you need to be spoon fed reasons to vote for Biden-Harris, you're less reasonable than my toddler.
But Sanders endorses Biden. By that logic, he also isn’t a progresssive.
Yeah the OP wasn’t disputing that.  The point is that Biden was handsy with women and that made Reade more plausible.  Morse has no comparable, visible record of misconduct.  There is a really obvious difference there
While stricter gun control measures have at times been a major part of Harris’ campaign platforms, the issue was barely raised at Wednesday's press conference.
I was genuinely impressed by Biden and Harris modeling social distancing at this event. I know it’s a formality, but that’s the point. Leaders *should* model proper public health behavior. It matters!  I also love that they’re selling Biden/Harris masks.
How do you top the words of Biden and Harris which sounded like a beautiful symphony in contrast.
Milli Vanilli would be an appropriate analogy for Biden and Harris. 100% fake and full of poo.
Just in case you forgot Joe Biden will be 78 in November.
that would be great, i hope they do.  Biden’s current plan doesn’t even restore the tax rate to the (low) level it was at under Obama
Sure that could happen...but why doesn't Biden win MS then, not to mention NC.  (Or OH for that matter.)
What a delight to think of all the highly competent people who could be part of the Biden administration
Okay, sure Trump could win NH...but how does Biden win LA at the same time...while not winning MS...but winning GA...and not winning NC???
Biden doing a great job of singing Kamala’s praises as he introduces her now on CNN...
Biden says Kamala has our back, now it’s time to have hers...such a loaded statement.  I’m trying to be good today...I promise 😇
STARTING NOW: Biden and Harris give their first joint remarks as running mates. Watch live:
Remember when Biden introduced Obama as "Barack America" in 2008 when Biden was selected as VP?
Any minute now, Joe Biden and Kamala Harris will appear in Wilmington, Delaware, at their first event together. Don't miss their show-stopping opening duet on "Ain't No Mountain High Enough." It's sure to be amazeballs.
I like the way you think. But I also think Biden can win Montana and Alaska, so I may be a touch too exuberant.
gahhhh... i want to watch this Biden Harris unity rally  with people who are fired up!   Stinks to have to socially distance
Joe Biden could not pick his own NOSE
It’s a surprisingly appealing pitch, and I think the Biden team knows it.
Update: Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden and his running mate Sen. Kamala Harris will speak at 4:30 p.m. ET.
WATCH: Joe Biden announced on Tuesday that California Sen. Kamala Harris would be his vice presidential running mate. They are giving remarks together at 3:50 p.m. ET.   📺 Watch live here:
C'mon man... Biden is still trying to decide, green or red jello.
Biden &amp; Harris are not progressive enough. They have both done awful things. I’m disappointed that Biden is the Democratic Party candidate and that Harris is his chosen VP.   But I am still voting for them. And I think you should too.
So what? The dispute is not that the prosecutor was corrupt; the point is that Biden was on the take, so he pushed the firing for his own personal ulterior motives

"Make no mistake: Putting a qualified person of color like Harris — whose parents are Jamaican and Indian immigrants — on the ticket is a statement against President Trump."  Takeaways from Joe Biden picking Kamala Harris from
We’ve heard your racist misogynistic attacks before. BORING. Biden/Harris. We have your backs.
GOPmay not be willing to do anything about trumps racism, misogyny dog whistles, but women of color, white women, suburban women, will do something about it on Nov. 3rd.  We have Biden/Harris ticket backs that’s for sure.
Kamala Harris is a f**king warrior, and that’s what Joe Biden needs right now. She will also make an excellent POTUS, whenever that time comes.   All the rest is noise.   #BidenHarris2020
do Postal workers vote for Biden given  intentional actions to harm USPS and the wonderful people that work so hard for our country?
you fool. vote for Biden/Harris or you're voting for cheeto.

In answer 2 latest Trump stupidity (he said Americans will have 2 learn Chinese if Biden is elected) I am ready 4 that, Donald, I have taken 2 years of #Mandarin
Today's rule: every person who yaps about how Joe Biden is "building a bridge" should go watch "The Bridge on the River Kwai" to see how well the bridge building thing worked out for Alec Guinness. "Madness! Madness!" (Actually, just call quits on today &amp; watch a great film.)
Trump’s failure to contain COVID has absolutely cratered the economy. Not talking about numbers on Wall Street. Talking about people’s lives, and jobs!  Voting for Biden, and Harris.
I mean is he supposed to openly disparage the nominee and vp pick because he lost? Or is he smart and understands that it will be far easier to get movement on his agenda under Biden/Harris than Trump/Pence? Idk what this tweet changes?
Biden could have picked Donald trump jr as his running mate and I’d still have to vote for him, why does anyone care who it is
It goes so far out of bounds. He is supposed to be apolitical. Talk about bias. He needs to resign. He needs to be held accountable even after Biden wins.
Biden struggles with green or red jello.  He didn't pick Harris.
Well best of luck in the election then. I hope Biden and his disaster of a pick will make you proud 🤣🤣🤣  You don’t look long for this world, however. So perhaps whether Trump wins or not (he’s going to win in a landslide), you won’t have to endure him.
Well, why don’t you ask the President of Ukraine? He just named Biden as an accused party in a crime yesterday. 😃
Crucial thread. Look we have to vote Biden/Harris- but we also have to know exactly who we’re electing. Harris is pro-police, pro-war, pro-corporation &amp; has voted to further oppression of BIPOC Americans COUNTLESS times. Ethnicity &amp; gender do not a hero make.
I love how excited Kamala Harris’s colleagues are about her selection as Joe Biden’s running mate. People who worked with her back in the day and people who work with her now have all said how great she is.   It’s nice to have candidates who just know how to work as a team.
I much rather prefer #HeelsUpHarris, with no mention of Biden. He’s as lost from this ticket as are his marbles. 🤣🤣
I willlllllll...NOT be voting for the Biden/#HeelsUpHarris ticket!   #Trump2020 #KAG2020 #TrumpTrain
Biden is a sellout. Kamala is a phony
Keep this in mind before your rush off to vote for the Segregationist/Cop (Biden/Harris)  ticket, folks! 😃👍🏼 #BidenHarris2020 #BidenHarris
That 17 year old who hacked Joe Biden’s account for a Bitcoin scam should have announced his Vice President instead. Huge missed opportunity
why couldn't we have this race instead of the lame one we're stuck with?  Also we should run Hunter Biden on the Green Party so it's a 3 way brawl
This reads like a Biden interview
I’m backing Biden and Harris 2020.
And more good news for Biden and women voters today. Biden has an amazing 31% lead over Trump among women nationally in Monmouth poll (pre-Harris announcement).
Was I confident that Biden could win Texas? Not really.  Am I confident that #BidenHarris2020 can win Texas? Hell, yes.
Derp!  Here’s where you can donate to the Biden-Harris campaign, everybody.
Could you imagine what 45 would say about and do to a person (i.e. a black woman) who harshly challenged him on the debate stage? I’ll tell y’all one thing - he sure as hell isnt picking that person as his VP. Say what you will, but this says a lot about Biden’s character.
Joe Biden ran two campaigns before even winning a primary.
Ready to vote now for Biden/Harris. Hurry up November 3rd!
I guess you have this because Biden’s info is available while Trump’s is secret. Shame on you.
lmao if they think Biden and Harris are far-left
Biden already has one more person than trump does that'll call him on his bullshit and he's only filled one position.
Kamala got the Republicans out here accidentally campaigning for Biden.
I guess he should've cared what Biden said.
The Biden campaign equates socialists and plutocrats fo gods sake
This strategy is gonna backfire. Painting Biden and Harris as "radical left" is just gonna help turn out the far-left Democrats.
Biden-Harris👍for me. + AG Adam Schiff to BRING THE PAIN after 3+ years to 45 and  who are tied sloppy close with a “cord of steel”. The real Super Bowl is probs not happening. THIS is the righteous Super Bowl of our era. See ya in court, then prison,
Absolutely...there’s no way out for him, Biden, Wray, Comey, etc...
My daughter (21) has said she doesn't want a Biden sticker on our car. 🙄 Little does she know, I was just waiting for the #BidenHarris stickers to become available. Ordered one today. 🤣🤣🤣 (Yes, she's voting for them.)
Third, she’s qualified and competent for the position, and will be a good leader if Biden has to step down for something like a medical issue. Finally, it’s depressing that people continue to try and divide us, on the left and the right. What we need is unity, not division.
It pisses me off that people are saying “Kamala’s bad bc she’s a cop!” First of all, she was a prosecutor, and prosecuted people according to the laws in place. Secondly, nominating her damaged the Trump argument that Biden’s soft on crime and will let antifa destroy cities. 1/2
Biden is obviously anti-yo-semitic, too.
Biden Harris zoom background? 🤣
Watch, like and Retweet!  Biden in 2008...
Why are people so mad that Biden picked Kamala bc she was a former prosecutor. She did her job and convicted people of crimes. Crime is bad. I don’t see why this is so controversial
Is it too soon to make the “Kamala Harris is to Biden what Cheney was to Bush” take????
We have an actual lunatic as president and y’all want to say you’re not voting because he didn’t pick your favorite?   4 more years of Trump is a hell of a lot worse than 4 of Biden/Harris
President Trump just broke it down... #HeelsUpHarris 👠👠 was the meanest, most disrespectful person towards Justice Kavanaugh and then VP Biden during the primaries.
. just said with certainty that Biden-Harris will face Trump-Pence in the general election.  WE DON'T KNOW THAT UNTIL TRUMP CONFIRMS HIS VP PICK for upcoming election.  Which he has not.
We will vote for Biden/Harris BECAUSE she “was nasty to Brett Kavanaugh” in your words.
Harris is such the right pick. I was worried honestly that Biden would feel outclassed next to her and run away. Cudos to him for making the choice.
Great, historic choice! I’m so thrilled that Kamala Harris is Biden’s pick for VP! (And yes, for pete’s sake, I know that’s Maya Rudolph below. Did you see the movie CHiPs? Harris was in that. Rudolph took over as attorney general of California during filming. Facts matter!)
Could’ve had Bernie and we ended up with biden and kamala aint that some shit
Again, it’s politics. You eill a candidate that will add to the ticket and bring more voters. It’s a game of numbers not a correctness. Plus she is the best to run with Biden based on the climate.
How would Lester feel if Biden asked him if he took a cocaine test?
Democrats will capture the White House and Congress too. Just watch now, Excellent choice of VP by Joe Biden
Don't make Biden snap his fingers in a Z formationThat’s very clever Mr. T. I never thought of that.     What a terrible disappointment Biden and Harris are together.
Wow nobody told you Biden is Senile yet?
Let's Go and do this thing! I am in and ready to fight for the post office, our democracy, and our next President and Vice President  (Joe Biden and Kamala Harris)!

Joe Biden agrees.
What are Bernie and Biden if not dinosaurs? Plus some former humans self identify as dinosaursoon and who are we to disagree?
Sounds like Biden.....
Biden won't answer any questions so...
Unlike the left, we won't personally condemn Biden supporters, many of whom are our friends. But we do scratch our heads over how so many decent people can be utterly clueless about America's fate under the iron rule of a Democratic Party that has sold itself to leftist extremism
Think it’s just a numbers game w/ him!  If more of Biden Harris voters die than Trump voters, even if it came down to a difference of 1 voter, he would be happy with the outcome.  Remember, as long as it was hitting non-GOP states, he didn’t even consider it an issue! #voteBlue!
His campaign has called my house a few times, voice call tells me President Trump is calling 😂😂 I pick and say hello this is President Biden 😜

Hey Boomer Karen, let's have a chat shall we.  Does God support the candidate who held a bible upside down for a photo op, cheated on his wife with a porn star, had several divorces and makes fun of Biden for praying?  Or literally anybody else other than that?  Idiot.
Nope, this should be a gift from God ..this woman should LOSE Biden votes. She dropped out of the Democratic primaries with NO support from her own party when running against a field of terrible candidates.  There is a lot for trump campaign to go after here. She is a socialists.
Joe Biden, Jr if President Trump is a failure, I’d rather be a failure like him, than a success like you. The enemy within.
Just keep voting democrat you get all you want of this Biden/Harris
We need all our #WarrenDemocrats to ensure we hold Biden and Harris to a vision of America that works for everyone!  Excited to see her hold their feet to the fire in the Senate!
Not really baseless and even though you updated the story, you keep the headline?
Dunce. When  imposed the early January China travel ban Biden said it was premature. if Biden was president millions would be dead. before you start using your pie hole you need to be better versed in the facts
Spoken like a typical Hollywood elite. You have no fucking clue what real Americans want. They are sick of the liberal corruption and bullshit. #Trump2020 when's the Biden boat parade?😂
This shows again that Kamala Harris decisions are situational and based on what would give KH the most personal benefit.  This same logic applies to her actions in Senate hearings (Kavanaugh) &amp; Presidential debates (vs Biden).
yeah, real Americans don't want Trump...you're an elitist asshat! When's the Biden boat parade?😂 #Trump2020
Insane. It reminds me of when Obama/Biden decided it was a good idea to cut SS because the elderly vote Red. And found that the elderly have children 😂  In this case, rural is red, and really relies on USPS no need for derivative parties to jump in. &gt;
Could you imagine Biden trying to handle what Trump gets from the press?😄🤣😂🤣😂🤣
I didn’t say that I didn’t like I said Trump deserves some criticism but so does the other side you can’t be one sided. Why does nobody ever read the whole story? I’ve said this many of times I will criticize Trump the same way as if I would Biden. The left only chooses Trump.

Don't cover his badly-disguised rallies unless you intend to give the Biden-Harris campaign equal free air time.
Thank goodness Joe Biden has anything with over two wheels all about his candidacy.
President Trump’s last comment at his news conference: “Take a look at Joe Biden, he has no control over anyone, he has no control over himself.”
It’s about time.  If Trump wins, this process will continue for a long time.    If Biden wins, it will all end and Obama &amp; his team will be forever immune to accountability (just like Bhenghazi, IRS weaponization, etc)
Yep.  In the Senate she can push her own agenda.  In a Biden admin she will have to toe the line!
Why?  This is the shit that Biden chose.  He OWNS it.  They will keep doing it now that they've been validated.

But they still succeeded in scaring Dems about voting by mail unfortunately. I'm hoping the Biden Harris campaign will address this And I'll be here waiting to do whatever they say and help others vote safely!
I've got no respect for Maher but he's right. Even one person in this country voting for Trump is a national embarrassment. If Biden loses even one state, even a state like Alabama or Idaho, he should feel deep shame.

Ya I just feel mlk would campaign for Biden, then fight him like he did with LBJ, but that’s just me and my analysis of MLK’s teachings and style
What your saying is all the routes are headed in the opposite direction of where you want to go?  I see your point,  but I do think Trump is spectacularly dangerous.  The Biden folks keep getting me annoyed, so it makes it hard to hold my nose and vote for him like I did Hillary&gt;

I agree with your point in principle, but I think MLK would’ve actually endorsed Biden which Nina and Cornel refused to do, making him more welcome than Nina or Rashida
I think he would acknowledge the role of the white moderate and be critical of Biden, but his contempt for 45 would lead him to fall in line and campaign for Biden, but I also think he would be sympathetic toward, but ultimately against a third party mvmnt

I wasn’t trying to imply that the black vote is monolithic, I feel erased as a leftist when people do that, I’m just trying to say that a majority of black people would agree that MLK would be campaigning for Biden after the primary, 2much at stake
But when we’re talking about whether MLK would’ve been supporting Biden, this poll would be heavily skewed since most black people aren’t included in this data sample, and black ppl know MLK would be settling and campaigning for Biden
Trump Proves Biden Right on USPS Funding, Mail-In Ballots

Yes the dnc would let him because he would’ve been campaigning for Biden
Yeah I wont forget.  That is why I am voting for Biden!  We need more women like Kamala!!
Thankfully, Biden isn't even really running a campaign, so we'll never have to find out.

Doesn't the law matter, anymore? Or is it just an inconvenience? Biden's people should have settled this months ago.
The party he follows and believes in can't find anyone better than Biden &amp; Harris to represent them.   You'd have anger issues too.
Everyone wants Joe Biden because Trump administration are CRIMINALS AND EVERYONE KNOWS IT.

Also, another out of context meme. The guy was getting in his face about the second amendment. Biden told him to stop being a horse's ass and that he doesn't work for him (a person who has a misconstrued view of the Constitution). So.. either way, Biden was alright here too.
Quit trying to prime people that the election will be fraudulent if you lose. There needs to be a peaceful transition of power if Biden wins

Lol, I was suspended from Facebook for saying positive comments about Biden and Kamala
He’s right about the masks. And it’s really starting to piss people off. Between orders to wear them during a zoom meeting, to Biden’s absurd suggestion to wear them all the time, it’s bullshit. They don’t even work..... it’s like swatting fruit flies with a chain link fence.
Biden is a known quantity who has all the experience and attitude for the position. Kamala Harris is a slice of Americana - diverse in all her glory. The two will pull America back from the brink and restore her soul. That’s why I’ll vote Biden/Harris.
Any critique about harris &amp; biden running away from the press?
Hillary Clinton suggests she's willing to serve in Biden administration: 'I'm ready to help any way I can'  #FoxNews Yep, put her in charge of setting up IT and security of our embassies. She has a proven record there.
I’m doing my part to help, the Biden- Harris team to win this presidential election. ... just volunteered to work in the Demacratic campaign efforts for my county.
The question is, "if we have a Biden/Harris (let's face it, Harris) administration, how quickly will the entire nation look like Minneapolis, which is to say Kosovo?"
Because Biden does not support a candidate who believes in a batshit crazy conspiracy theory like QAnon.
Maher says Biden's lead over Trump too slim: 'Hillary was ahead by more' ... key takeaway here is Andrew Yang is wicked smart - Butigieg is a clown

Did we all forget? Did we forget that there were tanks in Ferguson, MO while Biden was VP? Did we forget that rubber bullets were being shot at protestors while Biden was VP? Did we forget that the department of justice ruled Michael Brown not a victim, while Biden was VP?
Ima vote for Biden
Their idea of “leadership” is a socialist dictator style leadership. Biden said “It’s not about your rights.” That pretty much sums up the Democrat Party.
“Sacrificing humanity and morality to get a conservative judge is not moral,” she says. ‘Gerrymandering a district so you get a conservative elected is not moral.’  ‘I was really beaten up,’ adds Lemel. ‘Because I didn’t want to wear red and cheer for an idiot.’”  #ncpol #Biden
I go thru cycles of Biden optimism. Reminder of that whole pants suit thing has me bidenpilled again
Tweets/RTs from  continue to praise  and fundraising while  boasts about Israel/UAE accord and attacks on Biden/Harris/etc. 81 days to Nov 3.    #JoeBiden #DonaldTrump #2020Election #SentimentAnalysis
I think Romney would be well suited to be Secretary of State in a Biden administration.
Oh, Biden is still embarrassing. Absolutely. But on a much more amateur level than Trump.
I think even a lot of the GOP legislators silently would prefer him to 4 more years of Trump. Biden is someone they can work with, and knows everybody has to walk away from the table with something they need for their constituents.
Won’t be long before all the woke ppl will be reposting anti Biden/Kamala propaganda from fake Russian social media accounts.  will be a former Grand Wizard of the KKK and  will be Uncle Toms granddaughter by November just like they did to
HRC is dreaming.  If she gets a cabinet position under Biden, look for another “Vince Foster move”.   The battle between HRC &amp; KH while Biden is President would be epic. The kibitzing between Bill Clinton &amp; Obama will also be epic.

So by that flawed logic, we should be equally concerned, disappointed, disgusted... by the endorsement of Biden/Harris by the US Postal Workers union.
I have an option not to cast a vote.  If you feel Biden doesn’t have  years of racism in his 40 years in office then check his record.   II don’t vote based on anyone else”s beliefs Live your truth and don’t judge others ❤️
Every single Joe Biden commercial on my fucking TV is about the pandemic. These Democrat governors are 100% sandbagging opening and making it seem worse than it is. This is their platform.
Why is Biden on there!?!?
My thoughts exactly!
Get over it and vote for Biden!
Nothing you or Biden have proposed would improve the situation. Trump has advocated reopening the schools and the economy precisely to help those who are out of work and allow kids to get an education. Lockdown and wear masks until we have a vaccine is not a strategy.
She's staying in the Senate and watching you Biden and Harris 🧐.
Pretty sure NBA folks in the bubble had done much worse in regards to Trump
Same here, even if I have to camp out.  I’m going to witness my vote for Joe Biden enter that machine!
It drives him nuts that nothing sticks against Biden. Joe Biden has been in public life for an eternity. People just don't buy the attacks on him. People don't associate those things with Biden.
This is a pretty revealing tweet. He just can't accept that Biden can't be pinned down so easily like Clinton.
I'm planning to vote for Biden but I don't think the last 20 years would have been much different if Gore had won. Doubt this argument will convince anyone who actually thinks Biden and Trump are equivalent.
Democrats supported the Iraq war too including joe Biden
The fact that our Presidential candidates are Trump and Biden shows just how we pretty much let anyone be president

The funny thing is I know a lot of people who bought or are going to try and buy an AW AND then vote for Biden who are going to be in for a huge surprise when Kamala has them turn it in or buys it back at half price...🤣
Masks narrative is about 1 thing - protecting #Biden from campaigning. If they work we should be able to go to sporting events, keep prisoners behind bars, send all kids to school. But he needs to hide in his #basement &amp; let his handlers tweet for him because we know he can’t
Biden campaign had better be working a strategy as well!
The top two candidates in the primary elections should be on the Presidential and Vice Presidential ticket- since those two candidates represent the majority of the voters. Therefore it should’ve been Biden and Sanders.
Please don't post Biden Gifs on my timeline... 🤣🤣🤣
And still KKK endorses Trump and all racists rally behind him..strange that your Biden is the secret racist attacks don't work when he was the running mate of first black man to be president and his running mate is going to be the first black woman to be vice president..hmm..

Vote for Biden then, is that the option?
This is the exact thing I called out today.
Don’t worry, just pull up Biden’s eulogizing Robert Byrd, a former Grand Master in the KKK.  Biden said a lot of nice things about Byrd....
If that's all it took to nullify your vote for Biden then maybe you weren't all that rogue to begin with and just another phony Republican acting as if they don't like Trump.
Y’all Jaye really just complimented a record with Drake on it. I thought I’d never live to see the day.   Biden definitely winning in November

Did they know KHyve threatened to dump oppo on Biden himself though???
Gee I wish there was nuance on this site to be able to voice a legit criticism of Biden without getting screamed at about how Trump is worse. As if that fact makes the criticism invalid.
I’m voting for Biden, moron
just straight-up saying that some people aren’t people  I don’t think this person is representative of all Biden supporters but they sure as shit aren’t by themselves
MN-8? Biden's not gonna win it
Calls people trolls and argues with other resisters. Then tells other people to give them the axe. Kind of rude.
Great  blog here. You shouldn't listen to anyone who says they're going to push Biden to the left during his presidency if they're telling you to keep your mouth shut now
Biden: Thanks to Billy Irish for that wonderful, wonderful performance. I know of a lot of "bad guys" too, myself. Tommy Capano. The Route 40 Killer. The Elsmere Strangler. Lotta bad jacks out there, man. You know—ah, I've said too much. Here's Common.

Literally everyone on here has stated ON HERE we are voting for Biden.  Maybe you are used to stealing other people's ideas at work and not giving them credit???? Who cares as long as you land the big account, right?
It's funny how Biden and Harris have flip-flopped on everything they once believed in, including each other. You don't think they'd trade people like they've traded values? They hold nothing dear, except power.
I'm supporting Biden/Harris.  You do you !  Be productive in whatever it is you do, young man !
What about this tweet nullified or would dissuade a Republican voting for Biden?
The national news of Biden's VP pick of Kamala Harris was affirming to North Carolina HBCU grads, who we interviewed here:
This is something I truly believe in.  and  proposals are absolutely phenomenal. I stand behind this. I think the people of America should stand behind this. Biden and Sanders make for a powerful duo.
Absolutely! However! Biden has no Memory! Dementia or Selective Memory?
The phrase “going postal” will now mean voting for Biden.
You should do what is best for the country and vote for Joe Biden. You should also vote BLUE for your Senator and your Congressman - without all three, it will be more of the same. You want to keep voting GOP, do it for your state offices - but please, vote Dem for federal. TY
Biden lost that vote during the duration of his whole career. I can’t believe lesser evilists are so entitled about this. Biden never had my vote during 2020 or the last 4 years.
When you &amp; George Bush came out and endorsed Biden recently, did you not think that we’d put two and two together to come to the conclusion that you both, somewhere along the way, became part of the deep state Democrat corruption?  Do you that poorly of law abiding Americans?
A lot of what is on your list us what Biden is now supporting, tRUMP is a Koch puppet which is a hell of a lot worse than Bloomberg!
You are the reason #IMPOTUS may win because you are so hung up on Bernie not getting the nomination that you are willing to bite off your own nose to spite your face. Bernie is supporting Biden so get over it!
Agreed. The most corrupt administration in American history will be held accountable when Biden is President.

Kamala Harris and Joe Biden's Son Beau Were Close Friends    Who the hell cares ? Two lying peas in a pod.
She’s certainly capable of answering questions.  Seems they are both being quiet so Biden doesn’t look bad by giving bizarre answers or leaving all answers up to Harris.  So strange he’s the nominee.

Joe Biden says that Trump is running a campaign based on fear.  The left acts like they used to respect the right before Trump came along....  In 2012 Biden said if Mitt Romney wins "they're going to put you back in chains"  Fear?  Respect?  Really......
Thanks for the shoutout! 🌊💃🏻
The lefts position for as many elections as I can remember has been that if the GOP wins, life as the left knows it is over.  Harken back to 2012, Biden commenting on Mitt Romney "They're going to put you all back in chains."    So get out with your "partisanship" BS.
npr feeling saucy today.  let's see how they do on calling out the lies of biden of harris.
Does the law matter? If there's a question, then it needs to be vetted. If she is disqualified, then she shouldn't be able to run for the office. If qualified, then she runs. What's the problem? Other than Biden's people should have vetted her ALREADY.

I wish I could do Biden's debate prep.
I mean there’s no denying that he’s incompetent. You could argue Joe Biden isn’t the best candidate, but at least he’ll put the right people in charge.
Every time I see Biden, he reminds me of what people look like in a casket and it makes me feel uneasy.

So I guess you won’t be voting for Biden either?  Why can’t the Democrats have a better candidate? What is an Independent to do?
Here is a not insane response.   Dems are already wearing a mask, so we are perfectly comfortable with the 3 MONTH period Biden called for and hope the rest of the country will join in.   Liberals didn't close schools/football, it was educators who understand the health risk.
Biden handlers will no longer let Joe dress himself
Are people that short sighted? Voting in THIS election is simply about preserving the republic.  Biden/Harris are not perfect, but if/when they are elected, we will live to fight another day. Trump is RIGHT now moving to steal the election. He needs to be stopped.

Kamala “phony” Harris might just be the worst pick Biden could’ve made.  She’s pissed off so many people &amp; thats why she dropped out of the Presidential race before the 1st primary vote even occurred.  And she’ll be President. Democrats wake the F up.  You’re being played.
I feel like Harris is the candidate that the party’s backroom bosses chose, and they are using Biden as a fullback to pave the way for her.

Provide one single shred of evidence that Biden wants to "take all your guns!" 🙄 The fact that y'all keep pushing this BS propaganda goes to show it's YOU who think your followers are morons, because you know good &amp; well it's just a manipulative LIE! Real leaders don't gaslight.

I’m seriously wondering if that’s not why Biden is saying that. It’s been proven over and over that they have little to no affect on prevention of the virus.
Trump is suing TV stations who run (truthful) campaign ads against him Trump's lawyers are working overtime to get a 3rd party candidate on the ballot to pull votes away from Biden in swing states
You are not just voting for Biden in November. If he was to claim presidency, there are serveral other appointed positions to be filled that can serve as change to our country.  These positions include the Attorney General, Supreme Court Seats, Secretary of Education etc.
Remember the long, long parade of Biden-alternatives from Democratic leadership? How the hell do you think Deval Patrick would be doing right now???
Vote for Biden. It's the only way to end this. No Marshal of the Supreme Court, no impeachment, no 25th amendment, and no handshake with a Brazilian minister who has COVID. There's just one thing we can do. I hope enough of us do it.
And you are holding millions of Americans hostage with this phony shut down of the economy. Your zeal to destroy Trump is dragging down the livelihoods of millions of Americans over what is no more than a bad flu season. I wager the masks come off November 4th if Biden wins.

Do that at the debate Mr President.  So the works can see.  Go on.  Avoid.  And then watch Vice President Biden answer every question in complete sentences and in complete honesty.  He was so flustered because he doesn’t know truth.
Joe Biden is also a bad representative of my values, but that’s another discussion. What about when trump restricts in person voting and congressional democrats do nothing but tweet and send letters on their way to yet another recess?
We need numbers great enough to transcend their creative and prolific malfeasance.     #PostalService  #USPSsabotage
Free infomercials?     Our local TV stations showed 4 interviews after Harris’s selection as the Democrat’s VP candidate.  They were nothing but non stop praise about her and Biden.
So Biden wants all Americans to wear masks for at least 3 months.....what is in 3 months? The election. #tinfoilhatthoughts
I saw a Trump commercial with a woman saying we can't rebuild if Biden is elected because he's too weak.  Biden should create, like a rap battle commercial response asking, "Now how did we get into this mess in the first place? Why exactly do we need to rebuild? Just asking?"
It’s very clear Biden said wear the masks for the next three months so that as soon as the election gets here they can say take the mask off and say it was their leadership that cured the country if they win. Just another ploy because one way or another Covid ends on November 3rd
Exactly. Their corruption is In Your Face, So What Are You Going To Do About It? It shakes your faith in people to know that so many voters will still vote for them in November. Biden's election is not a given.
Turn-out for Democrats exceeded 2016 and is on course to reach 2008 numbers.  Biden and Trump both got 18 million votes this year, but Democrats had 36 million total votes cast with a contested primary.  Biden wound up winning 51% of the vote.
Nobody's expecting Biden (or Trump) to fix all the world's problems. But it sure would be nice to have a President that wasn't actively making more!
Well for one nick cannon is a definite racist lol  but i mean obama picked joe biden as VP cause he was white so im pretty sure thats the only reason biden is picking kamala..and shes a women so even mor evotes
Very easily. Biden/Trump will focus on the NY/Calif voters, while not caring about the middle of the country. Why go to Nashville to get 500k votes when I can go to LA to get 5 million? Not getting into a political discussion but don't rewrite the constitution to benefit yourself
“And right after Reagan’s ‘wall’ speech, Biden again took the line that Reagan shouldn’t dare to provoke the Soviet bear.”  Sheesh...has Biden been right about ANY foreign policy decision?
No one even said they weren't voting for Biden in the thread so......????
We asked the public about a number of key federal and state races, but also surveyed their opinion on several political statements/slogans, such as: - Law and Order - Black Lives Matter - Defund the Police You can take a look at these results here.
If there is a fair election and the votes are all counted cleanly (big if), then Biden will win.  If Biden wins and Trump refuses to leave, then the US military is constitutionally bound, more than able, and will likely be very willing, to escort him out of the White House.
Biden &amp; Harris  Campaign 2020!
I hope this is incorrect! Professor who accurately predicted every election since 1984 says Biden will beat Trump
Dunno ... tell me  This scared the hell out of me ...
Yeah, even if Biden wins and Trump leaves (willingly or not), 2022 is going to be very challenging.
#ncpol On the same day   completes a poll showing Biden with a one percentage point lead.....
It’s hilarious that these people think Biden has any clue how to fast track an economic recovery. The first thing he will do is give away Nancy’s 3 Trillion dollars, then raise taxes by 4 Trillion while a ton of ppl are out of work. He’ll spend the SS money in his first month.
Biden can suck my balls
Historic, especially because so much ground had to be made because Obama &amp; Biden totally sold Israel up the river. Stabbed them in back
Joe Biden has never helped anyone other than his family. If you don't do anything it is virtually impossible to do anything wrong.
Honestly &amp; selecting Kamala for VP, completely solidified their stance with progressive politics/voters, Hispanic/Latino peeps, &amp; young voters. It’s honestly a shame. I can’t say I hope Biden loses but I do hope they find out how dumb it is to alienate such a large voting bloc.
Wow, just wow. Such a lie. Reagan had the longest peacetime recovery EVER. Obama and Biden destroyed the economy.  History revisionism will not work this time lady.  #reclaimingmytime
Republican voters, PLEASE force your representatives to have actual ideas and policies! Attacking the left is *not* a policy. "Biden wants to raise your taxes " Bleh - too easy. Why does he want to raise taxes? How much? Where will the $$ go? Make Haley prove it. Dig deeper.
I literally have been wondering who, if anyone, had been doing any leg work within the Biden camp to gain the Hispanic/Latino vote since Bernie dropped out and I’m pretty sure it’s no one.
I just hope if Biden becomes president ( and God I sure hope so) Kamala remembers she is vice president not the president.😉
Melania would just repeat Dr Jill Biden's answers
Biden calls for nationwide mask mandate amid coronavirus pandemic
My 70 year old father is one of them.   Just like Joe Biden, he may have made some mistakes along the way, but he’s learned and is a good man.   I’m proud he is my father. 💕
When people say we can move Biden on policy, I always ask why do they expect Biden to move if you’re going to vote for him no matter what? It makes no sense.
The mass incarceration ticket of 2020 pledges unconditional support to Israel "unlike some Democrats." Interesting.  Kamala Harris is Joe Biden's VP pick - here's what Jewish voters should know - Jewish Telegraphic Agency  via
She's a hypocrite for calling Biden a racist and saying she believed the accusations against him SMH. She prosecuted over 1500 marijuana cases, but laughed when she was asked is she smoked. It's pathetic! Biden and her will be the incarcerating dream team.
Obama/Biden.  Hands down THE MOST CORRUPT administration in the history of our nation.  I don’t care what your politics are, open your eyes to what the Democrats have become past 20 years.  I used to be one of them.  Time for others to wake the hell up...they do nothing but lie.
Uhhhh..#Biden and #Obama already had 8 years to try to get this done but did not. #Fail
Did Biden say it would not help democracy to prosecute tRump? Oh yes hell it will sir. Along with each and every one of his criminal co-conspirators.
It should not be that close!!! Biden and Harris should be ahead by a landslide!!
🤣🤣🤣 they all puppets.. ima vote for Biden though
None of them. It’s all about JoJo!! #JoJorgensen2020 !!!! Voting for Biden or Trump is a vote for old racist sex offending pedophiles!!
People can ACTUALLY SUPPORT AND VOTE FOR KAMALA because she's QUALIFIED.. not just cause she's BLACK! BIDEN-HARRIS 2020
I'm watching VP Biden speak abt the virus. What a breath of fresh air! He makes sense, I CAN trust what he says &amp; he's not degrading his apponents by calling them names &amp; acting like a bully. He's acting like an adult &amp; leader. It's like someone we've known has finally come home.
I bet Biden's happy it's only 56%!
If you don't vote for Biden, and could otherwise vote and are not disabled/afflicted in some similar way, it helps Trump win. You are, therefore, a Trump supporter. Vote for Biden and bug the hell out of him if he wins.
I think you mean “Kamala Harris news conference”....because Joe Biden is just an empty vessel....
Obama had bipartisan cabinet. If Mitt Romney would just get some courage and come out for Biden I would have no objection to his being SecOfState--and it would also be a slap in face to Trump 😊
i dont think you cab be making fun of biden when your own idiot cant do the same
”If he wins, you’re going to end up with a disaster,” he claimed of Democratic rival Joe Biden."  No sense of the self-own.  Aren't we're in a disaster *right now* thanks in no small part  to your ineptitude?  Can we just skip ahead to Nov 3?
The  campaign appears to believe that Republicans can be trusted to vote by mail.  It's just Biden supporters that can't be trusted, I guess.
I'm pretty sure helping Black people wasn't in the job description packet Biden handed her.
Going to make calls for Biden to spite her now.
I'm going to go make calls for Biden to spite you, Naomi.
Anyone that believes Joe Biden writes his own tweets hasnt been paying attention.
Most of the U.S. government’s 200 immigration detention centers are run by private contractors holding asylum seekers and other immigrants accused of administrative violations or awaiting deportation.
You're forgetting how racist this version of the GOP has become. They could not conceive that Biden would actually choose someone who wasn't lily white to run with him, particularly someone as strong as Harris.
We all know thatTucker/Hannity have a huge draw nightly, and I've never contested that.  I'm saying lets look at the data on a day that Biden doesn't pick his VP in the 18-49 segment. We already know the NBA heavily outdraws all news in 18-49 demo by a landslide on a normal day.
I’m sure mlk would love Biden who is a bigot then and I’m sure he died so he could be voted for
That's great and all but please don't give the Biden administration a pass like you did for the Obama administration. If Trump taught us nothing else it's that when you ignore abuses from your side, they will be doubled down on by the other side.
There might not be any partisan differences in states that already use VBM, but if bluer states increase its use while reddish states do not, vote margins for Biden will increase.  He could win nationally by 7 million votes and yet lose in the EC.
Biden and Harris are the same as trump and Biden is a klansman who brought slave markets to Libya but these ppl against confederates got no issue with slavery we brought there
Trump will do far worse (and less) for this country than Biden but....they both suck. Politics is always choosing between the lesser of two evils. We need an ACTUAL change to the system. I’m sick of choosing between two shitty options.
And Mark responded that the data here is skewed to the topical news of Biden picking his VP. It's literally the first line in the summary of data on the link Clay provided.  But alas, its still apples and oranges, per my earlier point.
Kinda reminds me how Biden is strong enough to ride a bike, in a mask, in the summer.  Trump, on the other hand, is so unhealthy that he can barely walk down a ramp.   I would make sense that Biden might choose to get some exercise that would likely kill Trump.
vote for biden because you will be able to hold him accountable also please donot hold biden accountable because that is a vote for trump
I am afraid there is no more time to settle for these bullshit artists. Ecologically, sociologically, and financially Biden is the worst choice imaginable. It is time to quell this.
Joe Biden has welcomed progressive input in his campaign. Lefty activists are hoping Kamala Harris, his vice-presidential nominee, will be just as flexible,  reports:
Watch Joe Biden and Kamala Harris First Joint Campaign Event Here
It would help to get a commitment to a policy platform so we can hold them accountable.  So far in the last 48 hours Biden has backtracked on M4A by saying people will get free coronavirus treatment.  Dude what about after that?!?!
Obama/Biden: "Listen to scientific experts. Constantly reevaluate options." Trump/Pence: "The FDA is wrong. Listen to the demon-sperm lady. There are only two options: take Hydroxychloroquine or inject yourself with bleach."
Your tweets alone can cheer me up. I’m trying to find the collection of montages from the 25th Ammendment now. I’m sick of the orange clown saying Biden is not mentally fit. 4 some reason I think it was u who put them 2gether. I want 2 post them so bad on FB where the asses are!
Dear Nate, We are not joined at the hip. Biden hasn't done anything to earn a vote. He believes he is entitled. Most Bernie Bros were Independents, and lean towards 'green' policies and aid the working class. Biden ain't that.
Biden and Kamala..tough on crime but also on board with police reforms..that's what the country needs right now..but we need to push for more reforms and more crime prevention than prison filling..
Obama/Biden: "Do this." Trump/Pence: "Do the opposite of this."
Yes, yes, yes.This, to me, is job one for the Biden-Harris administration.
Biden owns a gun
The August #CivitasPoll is out! Some important numbers that reveal a couple of very tight races.   Trump/Biden: 44%/45%  Tillis/Cunningham: 38%/41%  Cooper/Forest: 49%/39%  #ncpol
Clearly you’re not interested, I just don’t really care. “Lol Dr. Jill Biden had no ‘porn pics’” jokes are sex shaming and obnoxious. Comments about people being less-than because they don’t have a college degree are elitist.
This country is a mess. As a Conservative, I want a guaranteed, accurate election. In person or absentee with Verified ID. There is too much division and distrust on both sides for any mail in nonsense. And if we LEGITIMATELY elect Biden, then so be it. I’ll do what I have to.
Joe Biden is an idiot! 😡😡
Another reason to vote for Biden
When you are running against the most hated man in America.....
Biden and trump are the same to me so I’m not about to waste energy arguing over a rigged system, this is why ppl don’t vote
Wait. Is your argument that Trump is a fascist but Biden is better because he'll just *think* about bring us more fascism and THAT'S what makes Biden better? You do realize how stupid that sounds, right?  Our country is not a democracy: It's an oligarchy with the guise of
Biden never had a chance against  😂🤣. Gonna love seeing yall cry for another 4 years.
In Biden's defense, I suggest that Trump is insulting men everywhere by claiming to be one.
See this is a true American, Biden and his campaign actually believe made in America is best. Whereas the tRUMP only gives lip service to the idea.  #VoteBlueIn2020 #DumpTrumpNow #BidenHarris
Its interesting watching Democrats who complained about Biden/Harris now defending them and voting for them and not realizing that they’re doing the exact same thing Republicans have done with Trump.   “If they win, our team wins, so I’ll overlook everything I don’t like to win.”
"...only the 2nd Black woman ever to serve in the US Senate, and the first South Asian-American woman. No Black woman has ever served as the governor of a state...no Black woman had ever been on a major party’s presidential ticket."   The power she has!
LISTEN. Biden should’ve picked Bernie as his running mate. But I see what they did. Having an African American woman on the ticket is MONUMENTAL, so I’m not taking anything from her. Trump is going to spend the next 80 days focusing on defining a woman.. &amp; what she should be.
Ads here in NC by the admin take Biden’s “Not gonna be happy about raised taxes” (referring to the rich and himself, actually) and making it seem like he meant the middle and lower classes.  Still yet to see an ad about their successful COVID management though. Weird.
What jobs? We're tired of all the lies. That's why the Biden&amp; Harris ticket is the honest WINNER!
Remember all the hiring signs we saw in the past 3 years;  displayed in stores, on back of vehicles, billboards and everywhere we looked? Now think back to the 8 years of Biden and Obama.
Top story: WATCH: New Trump ad hammers Biden/Harris over Joe's endless array of racial gaffes  see more
This is exactly the tactics Putin uses and this will happen in every Republican state Trump needs. FL, TX, GA, PA, OHIO, etc..  Biden and Harris should file complaints now.
We have been hearing no defense for Biden since the reports surfaced... Unilaterally, the Democratic party has chosen to completely ignore or disavow outright the claims. I understand innocent until proven guilty, but people should at least investigate and have an inquiry.
WOW ! THAT IS DISTURBING TO SAY THE LEAST.
Hillary lost because of Michigan, Iowa, Pennsylvania, Arizona, Ohio, Florida, and Wisconsin’s going for Trump. Biden will win VA. Whomever wins won’t be decided by VA voters. Volunteer with the campaign if you want to make an impact.
Voter suppression, gerrymandering, pushback against mail-in voting, the elimination of polling sites, and Russian interference—all remove any possibility of a level playing field.  We have to overcome their criminality with numbers.    #BidenHarris2020
I’m good as long as trump isn’t president. We’ve had racist presidents before and the country was ran way better than this. If Trump wins because we keep slandering Biden and Harris which will split the votes or cause us to not vote at all... ima have a mental break down 😓
“Never forget peasants black people are a monolithic culture and will always fall in line when we ask.”        —Joe Biden (probably)
The media really wants me to be excited about the Biden/Harris presidential ticket don't they.
Got a loooot of white people on my feed saying that a Biden presidency would be just as bad as another Trump term. Um, hello?
'#HermanCain ’s #Twitter Account Attacks #JoeBiden and #KamalaHarris From Beyond the #Grave'  #GOPDeathCult #BaitShop, if they respond they have no "#respect for the #dead".  Mind you #trumpkilledhermancain, if there's an afterlife, he knows that now.
I.. yall.. did trump say that kamala harris was nastier to joe biden than.. Pocahontas? Trump supporters, this yall guy? 😂😂😂😂😂
Its only going to get worse when the unemployment checks stop next year and the real depression begins. And when Biden- Harris win or when the Left to contests a Trump victory.
You better take the social out of your name if you're going to vote for Biden and Harris. They're both tough-on-crime Republicans with a D next to their name.
Why Kamala Harris VP pick could cost Biden the election | Fox Business: Harris is a Sanders socialist , already rejected by the voters.
Don't forget Biden also wrote the 1983 Comprehensive Forfeiture Act that allows cops to steal people's property without charging them with a crime!
I cannot believe that I’m actually seeing posts from people about them not voting in September. You really want another 4 years of Trump?! Biden/Harris is not a perfect ticket but they are a HELL of a lot better than Trump. Check yourselves, people. #BidenHarris2020
A phrase you are beginning to hear pop up in private conversations about #presidential race is: '#JoeBiden has a lead..but his support is a mile wide and an inch deep". One operative characterized Biden support in #NorthCarolina as "1/4 mile wide 1/4 inch deep" Keep that in mind
PS...  Had he picked Klobuchar I suspect that would have been the knockout punch.  She would have delivered the midwest.  Harris?  Outside of California she's not well liked and never polled more than 1%.  California already voted for Biden so it doesn't matter.
Look what I ended up in Facebook jail for. Yup posting a positive comment on an article about Biden Harris speech🤦🏽‍♀️

Are you trying to show how much harder Biden will work tan you?
With Biden &amp; Harris we should expect millions instead of thousands of illegal immigrants.
good interview with Jack Lew this morning.  If Biden wins you think he brings him back to Treasury to tackle this mess? Or consider keeping Mnuchin and allowing him to negotiate without the limitations he clearly has now.
The entire world has a "dog in this fight."  Or...have you not been paying attention?  I do tend to agree with Gundlach, however.  She was poor choice for Biden.
That’s really gracious of Carlson to campaign so hard for Biden.
It means Biden is a stooge who they put up because they see him as “electable”. Then, they slip an in unelected socialist (Heels up) to fast track the socialist agenda that Trump halted. I feel like the voters will see through this obvious trickery and do the right thing though.

A 3T relief bill does more than a 1T relief bill and a lot more than Ted Cruz and Rand Paul's 0 dollar spending.Don't tell me GOP cares about deficit as if we haven't added historical national debt in the last 4 years.Pass the relief bill and vote biden to end the mess..
Hats off to Biden for making political ads that are actually pro-biden instead of just anti-trump. I still don't like the guy, but I can at least respect that, especially since dissing Trump is so easy.
Bring up Biden and Harris records was it relates to prison and arrest and then bring up Trump and Pences.

I have family members who think our current situation (i mean all of it) is great and Biden is a far left socialist. And I’ve concluded that it stems from this attitude “I got mine and I don’t care about anyone else”. American exceptionalism is quite the drug.
Rudi’s daughter Begs to differ and is voting for Biden
Biden being a conservative, pandering, racist who will escalate military tensions—like LBJ—was my original point. I think you missed it.
LBJ was a racist who did most things out of political expediency. He's also largely responsible for the escalation in Vietnam.  Biden would be the most conservative Democrat President in 50+ years.
Come on now Matt. It's almost September. Go ahead and tweet your half-hearted last-minute gotta-get-Trump-out-of-there endorsement of Biden now and don't keep us waiting.
Biden is LBJ being sold as FDR and that should piss you off.
Biden has been in politics for half a century.
Fuck Joe Biden
Niggas are like “bIdeN aNd kAmaLa aRenT aN imProVemenT” when there’s a whole ass racist floundering as the US is in the middle a pandemic induced recession
I love how Carl blames Trump for 165k Covid deaths. Liberal delusion alive &amp; well. You do realize Nasty Nancy and Basement Biden screamed “overreaction” &amp; Xenophobia” at band.  Considering 2+MM U.S. deaths was projection. U should stay away from this topic thank YOUR President.
Judge on Fox called for Biden assassination. One time I know what he’s talking about.
I don’t care who Joe Biden would have picked, I’m not happy voting for JOE BIDEN. Also, I can kinda understand why people would choose not to vote but Trump has done so much damage in the past four years how could you not vote against him?
If Keisha has been the VP pick it would have been a “Biden Bottoms 2020” ticket.
That's weird because a few months ago you said you believed Biden's accuser.
Biden is quite unlikely to be winning Montana. It certainly has a penchant for electing Democratic Senators but hard to see Biden carrying it, unless he's really up 15 points nationally.
Omg I just spent a small fortune in the Biden Harris store! 😊😳🤦🏻‍♀️

Yes when you try to compare two different things you get different numbers. It’s amazing. Now get that quote where the Biden accusers said it wasn’t sexual.
I thought Biden looks like he’s in great shape. I’d like to see Trump trying to move that hand powered car.
Biden will kick your ass, Trump!
Here comes the Republican attack against Biden/Harris. When did The Republican Party become so toxic? How can they bring our country together when all they do is spew vile propaganda at other Americans. Reprehensible. Repulsive. Dispicable.
big titty joe biden gf plz
Biden says campaign raised $26 million in one day since Harris joined the ticket
Apparently, Handsy  forgot about Obama ignoring the rise of ISIS, doing nothing about Syria, and how how Joe didn't want to take out Osama
Biden Harris 2020. The Choice is Clear.
I finally understand why experienced SA members went to such pains the last 4 years to clarify that we're not in a fascist moment yet and Trump is not actually a fascist leader: libs saying that fascism means we have to vote for Biden.
Has anyone floated this idea? Biden Wins, sworn in, resigns due to health.  Wala! The DNC is right where they always wanted to be. Don't sell them short.
This Biden and his granddaughter. You might wanna leave out family flavored metaphors with this guy.
"He inherited the longest economic expansion in history from Barack Obama and Joe Biden. And then, like everything else he inherited, he ran it straight into the ground," she said of Trump.
😂😂😂 Right?!!!  Me: Eh, he wasn’t my first pick. Tucker Carlson, trying to scare people out of voting Biden: HE’LL UNDO EVERYTHING MY IDOL DID?! Me: Thinking about a Biden Harris 2020 tattoo now, tbh.
If Biden/Harris is part of your long game you aren't making progress as anything but a neolib.
Didn't you campaign for #RobertByrd ?  #KKKBiden
Sometimes I forget that I surround myself with such progressive people that when I get around the rest of society I don’t know how to act lmfao.   Like huh??? You like Kamala and Biden???
Kamala Harris was born to highly educated middle class parents.  She was able to get scholarships to excellent universities.  She is not black.  She may be a wonderful role model, but as Joe Biden has said, “you ain’t black”.
Not even close. Listen to what these people are actively fighting for and you will understand why they are angry the Biden and Harris are the nominees. Progressives have legitimate concerns about Biden and Harris. Offer them the respect of paying attention to their needs.
Or purchase of Biden family support by the Chicoms to the tune of $1.5 billion. Bought and paid for by the CCP
Victory for Biden is not any type of victory for a progressive platform. Not now, not ever.
Funny that people think Biden/Harris will be literally any different than Trump
I think if the election were held today, Biden would win NC but not Georgia.
Man Biden picked Kamala Harris so he can persuade the blacks to vote in his favor...
Biden the Bigot...🤢🤮👎
Don’t know who Joe Biden is? His heart is pure.
And Liz and Katie were running a fundraiser at the exact time he announced Kamala... Coincidence?  You gotta give it to Joe Biden's team, they know how to use women and progressives and throw them aside.
I don’t share their political beliefs at all (I’m not ‘settling’ for Biden, he was my choice in the primary) but the Instagram account “Settle for Biden” is hilarious.
It should surprise no one that the “wing” this piece refers to is like 4 really disappointed people, one of which is a “never anyone but Bernie”, and even some of those recognize that there will be aspects of the Biden/Harris administration that will be positives ie climate.
Got this text from my mother a few minutes ago   “I am signing up to make calls for Biden/KamalaHarris Here’s the link if you want to do some yourselves.” 💪 #Kamala #BidenHarris2020ToSaveAmerica
The Biden media machine is more excited than those of us who actually vote
Good point, but:  Worst case scenario w/ Biden is returning to pre-Trump status quo. Which is bad, I know. That is WORST case.  4 more yrs w/ GOP will give us a full dictatorship, supported by a federal secret police, the DOJ, and the Supreme Court.   No contest. None. IMHO.
Good thing Biden isn’t exactly running against a Mensa Candidate.
I'm just one person planning to shrugvote Biden/Harris but I absolutely think your vote is your own, nobody is entitled to it. Vote your conscience.
Someone at Fox News who is not a Biden fan—maybe it was Tammy Bruce—said recently that one advantage Biden has over other political liars is that his lies are entertaining. His made-up-stories are at least interesting to listen to. Maybe he should’ve been a fiction author.
DNC: “Biden’s platform is the furthest left the party’s had in decades.”  The Left: We know. That’s the problem.
All of the “I’d vote for Biden but could never vote for an extreme candidate” all of a sudden finding a whole bunch of reasons to not for Biden. It’s almost like we shouldn’t let Republicans control who Democrats nominate.
what if at the first debate biden just walked out and smashed an orange with his fist before saying a single word, i feel like that’d really set the tone
I think that’s a cop out you know deep in your heart why ..nobody wants to talk to Biden or Obama either they are just blowing smoke up our ass if your not going to talk to everyone involved your wasting time

Amazing what our Crooked Fake Racist President  came up with after hearing about Kamala Harris:  “Take my word for it, if Biden-Harris gets elected, more blacks will move to the suburbs.”
I think she'll stay in the Senate.  A cabinet pick would pigeonhole her which is why she wanted President.  I'm happy for her to stay and fuck around with Biden/Harris as they've got little to no power.
Yes it is the two white women's fault because Biden scheduled their fundraiser from 4 to 6, and then announced his VP pick around that time (receipt attached 😉).
Same here. As the next President of the US, Joe Biden, and his badass VP, Kamala Harris, said today, Possibilities. Say it again, possibilities. A good day, for sure.

Funny, so the law and order guy is the guy in office when crime and murders surge? Get Biden in there to make America's streets safe again.
I don’t think I’m going to be able to get excited about a Biden/Harris candidacy. However, I am very much looking forward to Harris saying more stuff like “just like everythingp else he’s inherited, he ran it into the ground”.
Hey Twitter boy. Nothing inappropriate to say about the Biden-Harris press conference? Matter of time I’m sure. You are incapable of behaving like a leader.
Joe Biden, Kamala Harris make first joint appearance as running mates
Can’t wait for my ballot to start the journey afresh with BIDEN/HARRIS ticket!
But if something does happen to Biden, we know who to investigate. Question 1: How did you know something was going to happen to him?
3. Jeff Grundlach is an Economist, Global Macro Strategist, and Bond Manager. Without additional context, I don't see a problem with him saying a VP pick would be too dominant next to Biden. People said the same thing about LBJ next to Kennedy.
And winning is what Biden does best. #BidenHarris2020
OMG - The GOP compared to Biden - Harris looks like corrupt old white men from the Deep South, grasping at power that they know is slipping from their hands.  Goodbye and good riddance. Goodbye to the  hatered / bigotory/ and vial maliciousness of the Trump GOP.
Don't bother.  We knew she was first pick.  So, let's make her proud and get these progressives elected.  She will drag Biden and Harris in the Senate - the more of her we have, the more we can drag their asses.
Hoping there will be a spot in the Biden administration for you!

It's not about Trump or Biden. It's about becoming a dictatorship or keeping a democracy where we live to fight another day. The GOP will turn us into an autocracy if they get another term. They might have already, if they succeed in stealing this election.

. And this statement of mine remained true as well. It was Clyburn’s endorsement that cinched it for Biden. Obama didn’t endorse until it was “safe” for him to do so—after it was a foregone conclusion so Obama coudn’t be appear to be wrong.
What would the percentages for Biden look like in this situation. 80% of the vote in CA?
Biden and Kamala knocked it out of the park!!!
“And like everything else he’s inherited, he’s run ot in the ground.” (the economy from Obama/Biden) the NEXT VP of the United States,
“ inherited the longest economic expansion in history from Barack Obama and Joe Biden and then, like everything else he inherited, he ran it straight into the ground.” —  #BidenHarris2020
me and  are literally the BLUEPRINT for Joe Biden and Kamala Harris....truly the NC State SBP and SBVP ticket that y’all never knew you wanted
Beau Biden died at age 46 from glioblastoma multiforme, a form of brain cancer.  For over a decade I have been fighting for Burn Pit legislation to help veterans like myself and Beau.  I'm proud to stand with  as he fights for us.
I love your perfect purity.  Sorry for using shorthand (on twitter) to describe the overwhelming electoral turnout and validation among MANY, but not ALL, black voters that we all watched push Biden to the front.
God bless Joe Biden and Kamala Harris and god bless America. We at last have hope again💫 #JoeBidenForPresident2020 #JoeBidenKamalaHarris2020 #BidenHarris2020
While I don’t believe there will be any debates in which Biden is on a stage alone with Trump with no teleprompter to read or handlers to whisper in his ear—if there are, will the liberal MSM carry it on a delay so Biden’s losses of thought can be hidden from the viewers?
Joe Biden, Kamala Harris make first joint appearance as running mates: WATCH LIVE
Amazing how black voters LOVE Joe Biden...I am going to trust them on this one.
I am surprised the liberal networks are running the Biden/Harris annoucement live. If Biden forgets his place, everyone will see it.
Funny how #Kamala forgot Biden is a #racist who bussed her. 🤣😂 So freaking #fake  Oh kamala not even California love you. 😂🤣😁 Did you realize #DementiaJoe didn't express any optimistic plan? Nope just bashing POTUS. #SystemicRacism my butt
If you don’t vote for Biden I will make you eat my hot dogs ... that’s where this all ends.
Looks like Biden had a nice shot of #adrenochome  for this speach
Biden looks like he is being born again

Win one for the entire 🌏 everyone.   All people who are or want to be free need you to vote for President Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris.  And bring some friends. Get them registered.  💪👊🏾
She is not my choice for President or Vice President, just my own opinion, so sadly she can become President if Biden can longer perform his Presidential duties, although I dont feel he will get elected anyway.  So im not too worried about it.
Why when you type  in your browser does the Joe Biden website come up????? WTF?
The weather evidently has thrown the Biden schedule off per
Is what you are doing to Biden and Obama daily.
Biden on women, 2020: Sniff as many as you can 🤮  Kamala on politics for decades: who ya gotta sleep with to get anywhere’s here...
Unfortunately it’s a lesser of two evils. Not voting  all just gives it to him, and I don’t think Joe Biden could possibly do much more worse
I need Biden and Harris to hurry up though. They’ve been “speaking at any moment” for an hour and a half now
Rob, don’t get suckered in by this far-right conspiracy drivel, the domain owner likely transferred traffic toward the Biden website, which to me is actually clever if a bit sneaky.  My guess is this link will be down before the end of the day....
The next 100 days will be way more bearable if everyone admits that we all know exactly what will happen: liberals will check out the second trump is gone and Biden will sit in the chair and do nothing like they want.
Stick with the “he’s better than trump” argument, stop insulting our intelligence re: the “most progressive platform ever” full of things Biden didn’t support until this year and in most cases actively opposed for decades.
Despite Kamala Harris’s history, she probably looks better to the electoral college unfortunately.we all want Trump out so suck it up and vote Biden for 2020
In Joe Biden's case he said if a woman says she was sexually assaulted you believe her except of course for the woman accusing him of sexual assault.  You just ignore her.  Believe all women unless they accuse a democrat is usually how it goes.
“But not Joe Biden, he’s not that smart”🤣
no you mean the super delegates decided biden.  don't worry i'm sure that trump won't bring up kamala's attacks on biden at all during the next three months.
This is what boils my piss, people saying "but Biden is x, Kamala is y, and I voted for z"  Don't care.  There's an actual monster in charge now and do you really want an 4 more years of absolute misery??? Is the moral high ground worth all the COVID dead and kids in cages???
you understand that she said she believed what they said right?  you realize that what they said is accusing joe biden of inappropriate touching right?
No i've never had the position of believe all women.  that's a dumb position to take because then you end up in situations like harris and biden are in now.  You should investigate but to say believe all of anyone off the jump is just stupid.
Joe Biden: You ain’t black!🤬  Kamala Harris: I know.😪
This is the Biden War Room's best one yet.  👍
Good deal- there’s one educated voter that won’t be voting Biden 🤣
Four more years of Trump will definitely get those libs on our side.  They just wanna go back sleep under Biden
If you're looking to justify voting for Trump, look elsewhere. You know good and well Biden is the only viable alternative.
Seems odd that you dont want Joe Biden to do this.
Yeaaaaaaaaah if biden and kamala get elected I’m snitching
How y’all feel about Biden picking Harris?
This is too accurate. My view is at least Biden is less likely to be a national embarrassment.
Chip in to elect Joe Biden and other Democrats on the ballot
So what? Both Trump and Biden are creeps I thought this was already established
That’s a pretty gross way to describe a supporter. Are you in the Colon of Biden or any of the other corrupt scum you support?
Absolutely! Between Biden and Kamala! What is the Number of Black Lives Destroyed, Jailed or Inprisoned! If you have a Number! Let's Roll!
Followed and retweeted! 🌊💃🏻 blue wave coming through!
All you ppl complaining about biden/harris. Do you realize what the other option is, i mean come on, I cant take 4 more years of that cheeto puff bitch. #BidenHarris2020
There is no one solution my guy, you do what you can step by step to make progress and Biden is a step away from Trump, it might not be an end all solution, but it’s a step in the right direction to have our voices heard. I wanted Bernie, but you gotta do what you gotta do
I'm sure you were trying to look like Biden...right?
omg thought it was Biden lol
I'm not giving to the Lincoln project, but literally, it isn't Trump or Biden on ballot, but our Constitutional Republic. Will we keep moving towards a more perfect union based on the values we have espoused or slide into the abyss of a white nationalist totalitarian oligarchy.
Just ordered 2 Biden/Harris yard signs. One for the front and one for the back since our yard is up against the greenway.
They will spend the next 5 mo trashing everything they can just to make it that much harder for Biden to make actual progress.
Followed! Thank you! 🌊💃🏻
Wouldn't want people to see that Biden and Trump agree on everything.
again semantics aren't helping you here.  four women plus tara reade have accused biden of sexual assault.  unwanted touching is sexual assault.  the voters may not care at all but still doesn't change harris statement's
Biden has been criticized for telling a black jounalist that “you’re not black” or “you’re not black enough”.  If Joe applied those accusations to Kamala Harris, he would be right.
#GOP Trying to find bad things to say about Biden and a Harris is hilarious!  Your DEFENDING TRUMP!  PRES CLUELESS! We Win!   165000 DEAD!  Solution ‘IT WILL MAGICALLY GO AWAY’
Meanwhile, radical liberals are crying like babies and saying they won’t vote for Biden/Harris.
I’m white and live in the suburbs.  I didn’t misinterpret anything from this statement.  Nor did I get hysterical. Nor did I think that his statement showed any intelligence.  Just more of the divisive rhetoric that defines this man.  I’ll be voting Biden/Harris 2020.
One thing that is already odd (as if 2020 is not already "odd" enough) is that most presidential tickets tack to the center after primaries are over. #Biden keeps lurching farther and farther left with every decision including #Veep choice. Will center unaffiliated voters follow?
Meet President Biden
it's not a lie if it's true.  she did say she believed biden's accusers.  you just loop that over and over and there is nothing she can do especially after her grandstanding during the kavanaugh hearings.  again it will be glorious.
for biden/kamala who are both extremely pro policing pro cop and pro jail
I’m attending Joe Biden for President’s event, “National Women for Biden Bimonthly Training” – sign up now to join me! #TeamJoe
It is the political equivalent of #FourCorners before shot clock. The only problem is #JoeBiden is no #PhilFord...in order to win, you have to at least make your free throws when fouled and Biden keeps clanking even the easy softball interviews he has online
I heard her Family owned a lot of slaves, is that is the quality Joe Biden found most appealing in her. 😳not to  mention she’s black in color as well.
I assume anybody that really wants Biden to win will do whatever is necessary to vote for Biden. If you want Trump to win you will vote for Trump.  I don’t think Trump will want people who want Trump to win to vote for Kanye. I don’t see how this can help trump
Every time I here little girls I think of Joe Biden, hopefully those aren’t the same little girls he molested right in front of their parents. WTF😳
It's not excitement - it's the rage aimed at all those who were willing to risk our democracy by voting for a two-bit traitor reality TV personality. Vote for Biden, but the 2016 misogyny will not be forgotten.
Absolutely! The Perfect! Candidate for Biden! Maybe he can keep track of Kamala by her SMELL!
He is trying to replicate early days of  Republic where guys like Washington and Jefferson didn"t campaign for office...crass politicking was below them. They 'stood' for election and stayed home at Mount Vernon or Monticello. #Biden is trying new spin: Hiding Out with Biden
Biden knows what he’s doing  #JoeBiden #KamalaHarris #Election2020
Might be the first, and only time, you will see anyone in the public polling arena brag about how wrong they were in 2016 and also brag about how their model gives #Trump "MUCH higher" chance than other polls do...although still saying he will probably lose to a weak #Biden
In a Biden/Harris World! #Trump2020
Biden could’ve picked a Kit Kat to be his VP and I would still vote for him foh
So she's going to do all the work and Biden gets to lead and get credit?  No thanks.   stay in the Senate and give them hell.
Good for Democrats maybe, but bad 4 the people of North Carolina.  Joe Biden threw progressives to the curb with his pick, while shamelessly using African-American voters to advance neoliberalism.  Harris inspires nobody but party elites seeking power for their donors.  #ncpol
Moments After Biden Announced Harris, Trump Absolutely Flattened Her
Trump leads Biden by only 2 points in NC-11?
Number 35.
Congratulations to Senator Kamala Harris on being selected as the Vice Presidential running mate with VP Joe Biden. A Voteless People Is A Hopeless People.
And still Biden is 10 points ahead. AMAZING
Prob a long-shot for a D pick-up (former Meadow's seat), but redrawing of it will shorten the odds. That Trump is treading water vs. Biden is a good sign for the D. He prob lags behind Biden due to name recognition not preference. The R will likely make blunders, too.
Why isn't Biden (Or, really, his campaign folks) Segmenting emails?
Which will only happen with a D administration?  Work to get them elected and to move Congress to the left.  Biden/Harris will back it if the Congress passes it.
He actually admitted to most of the stuff you called obscure. You just pick and choose when to politicize your religion. Today you care about whatever is anti Biden.
No way Biden should debate Trump. Every word out of Trump's mouth is a lie.
Despite what happened to Ms. Clinton, I think the odds are in Biden-Harris’ favor.
What did I miss? #LincolnVoter  Lindsey Graham praises Joe Biden and calls Donald Trump a 'race-baiting, xenophobic, religious bigot' in new ad

if y’all keep gatekeeping biden by expecting everybody to kiss the ground he walks on and not have any critique ur gonna lose the progressive votes which u desperately need!😸
all my feed is rn is “StOp CoMpLaiNiNg AbOuT bIdEn/KaMaLa” like damn i thought we all believed in freedom of speech/having an opinion on issues, do y’all want my vote or not
Biden’s leadership has already been compromised.  This wasn’t his choice, nor was it his second choice.
I keep seeing people talk about how shitty the Kamala pick is for Biden but I have to ask, would any of Biden's VP picks NOT been shitty?
Biden seizes on Trump's attack on Social Security and Medicare, while team Trump panics
Biden must be pulling horribly behind Trump which is why The left is on this full court press about voter fraud all of the sudden.
If most people had suspected Biden was going to pick Harris for weeks, why is it taking the Rs so much time to come up with a strategy to attack her? Ahhhh, that’s right, we stole  , their best marketing team. 😂
“Good job siphoning those votes away from Biden!” - Jared
You keep acting like Tara Reade is the only woman to accuse Joe Biden of inappropriate behavior.  I just gave you a link with four other women.  That is why she said accusers.  Not accuser.
What happened to WSJ who uncovered Watergate? Exposed TRUTHFUL news? You r a mouthpiece for radical left. Expose that Biden can't string a sentence or remember where he is; that the flip-flop radical woman he's chosen for VP will be Pres within a year.

Dear Biden campaign - I would like to see individual debates between Kamala Harris and Bill Barr, Mike Pence, The Impeached One, Ben Shapiro, and the owner of Hobby Lobby. Thank for considering this request.
Anyone know if Biden gonna choose 8 treasury secretaries, make them battle it out for months, knowing the whole time he will cave to peer pressure, bullying and threats?  Or does he only do that with women?That’s very clever Mr. T. I never thought of that.     What a terrible disappointment Biden and Harris are together.
Wow nobody told you Biden is Senile yet?
Let's Go and do this thing! I am in and ready to fight for the post office, our democracy, and our next President and Vice President  (Joe Biden and Kamala Harris)!

“The Senate is affirmative action for white people. If we had to design political institutions from scratch, nobody — not even Republicans — would be able to defend a system that massively overrepresented whites.”
Joe Biden agrees.
What are Bernie and Biden if not dinosaurs? Plus some former humans self identify as dinosaursoon and who are we to disagree?
Sounds like Biden.....
Biden won't answer any questions so...
Unlike the left, we won't personally condemn Biden supporters, many of whom are our friends. But we do scratch our heads over how so many decent people can be utterly clueless about America's fate under the iron rule of a Democratic Party that has sold itself to leftist extremism
Think it’s just a numbers game w/ him!  If more of Biden Harris voters die than Trump voters, even if it came down to a difference of 1 voter, he would be happy with the outcome.  Remember, as long as it was hitting non-GOP states, he didn’t even consider it an issue! #voteBlue!

Hey Boomer Karen, let's have a chat shall we.  Does God support the candidate who held a bible upside down for a photo op, cheated on his wife with a porn star, had several divorces and makes fun of Biden for praying?  Or literally anybody else other than that?  Idiot.
Nope, this should be a gift from God ..this woman should LOSE Biden votes. She dropped out of the Democratic primaries with NO support from her own party when running against a field of terrible candidates.  There is a lot for trump campaign to go after here. She is a socialists.
Joe Biden, Jr if President Trump is a failure, I’d rather be a failure like him, than a success like you. The enemy within.
We need all our #WarrenDemocrats to ensure we hold Biden and Harris to a vision of America that works for everyone!  Excited to see her hold their feet to the fire in the Senate!
Not really baseless and even though you updated the story, you keep the headline?
Dunce. When  imposed the early January China travel ban Biden said it was premature. if Biden was president millions would be dead. before you start using your pie hole you need to be better versed in the facts
Spoken like a typical Hollywood elite. You have no fucking clue what real Americans want. They are sick of the liberal corruption and bullshit. #Trump2020 when's the Biden boat parade?😂
This shows again that Kamala Harris decisions are situational and based on what would give KH the most personal benefit.  This same logic applies to her actions in Senate hearings (Kavanaugh) &amp; Presidential debates (vs Biden).
yeah, real Americans don't want Trump...you're an elitist asshat! When's the Biden boat parade?😂 #Trump2020
Insane. It reminds me of when Obama/Biden decided it was a good idea to cut SS because the elderly vote Red. And found that the elderly have children 😂  In this case, rural is red, and really relies on USPS no need for derivative parties to jump in. &gt;
Could you imagine Biden trying to handle what Trump gets from the press?😄🤣😂🤣😂🤣

Don't cover his badly-disguised rallies unless you intend to give the Biden-Harris campaign equal free air time.
Thank goodness Joe Biden has anything with over two wheels all about his candidacy.
President Trump’s last comment at his news conference: “Take a look at Joe Biden, he has no control over anyone, he has no control over himself.”
It’s about time.  If Trump wins, this process will continue for a long time.    If Biden wins, it will all end and Obama &amp; his team will be forever immune to accountability (just like Bhenghazi, IRS weaponization, etc)
Yep.  In the Senate she can push her own agenda.  In a Biden admin she will have to toe the line!
Why?  This is the shit that Biden chose.  He OWNS it.  They will keep doing it now that they've been validated.

Let's not forget that Biden has his own troubles with both racism and mysogyny. I'm still voting for him, but I'm not nieve enough to think it's all on one side.
But they still succeeded in scaring Dems about voting by mail unfortunately. I'm hoping the Biden Harris campaign will address this And I'll be here waiting to do whatever they say and help others vote safely!
I've got no respect for Maher but he's right. Even one person in this country voting for Trump is a national embarrassment. If Biden loses even one state, even a state like Alabama or Idaho, he should feel deep shame.

Ya I just feel mlk would campaign for Biden, then fight him like he did with LBJ, but that’s just me and my analysis of MLK’s teachings and style
What your saying is all the routes are headed in the opposite direction of where you want to go?  I see your point,  but I do think Trump is spectacularly dangerous.  The Biden folks keep getting me annoyed, so it makes it hard to hold my nose and vote for him like I did Hillary&gt;
Thank you. Every single time I see one of my #Resistance buddies post a list I’m grateful. For each and every one of you. I was able to follow a few this morning then I got “theMessage” from Twitter. But I won’t forget and I won’t stop trying. Much respect and gratitude.
I agree with your point in principle, but I think MLK would’ve actually endorsed Biden which Nina and Cornel refused to do, making him more welcome than Nina or Rashida
I think he would acknowledge the role of the white moderate and be critical of Biden, but his contempt for 45 would lead him to fall in line and campaign for Biden, but I also think he would be sympathetic toward, but ultimately against a third party mvmnt

Project all you want about Biden... but what we have in office right now has proven completely unable, unwilling, and completely disinterested in leading this country.  Biden will lead and not put self interests first...that is MY projection.
I wasn’t trying to imply that the black vote is monolithic, I feel erased as a leftist when people do that, I’m just trying to say that a majority of black people would agree that MLK would be campaigning for Biden after the primary, 2much at stake
But when we’re talking about whether MLK would’ve been supporting Biden, this poll would be heavily skewed since most black people aren’t included in this data sample, and black ppl know MLK would be settling and campaigning for Biden
Trump Proves Biden Right on USPS Funding, Mail-In Ballots

Yes the dnc would let him because he would’ve been campaigning for Biden
Yeah I wont forget.  That is why I am voting for Biden!  We need more women like Kamala!!
Thankfully, Biden isn't even really running a campaign, so we'll never have to find out.

Dear progressives, tell me again how Joe Biden is a Republican and no better than Trump?

Doesn't the law matter, anymore? Or is it just an inconvenience? Biden's people should have settled this months ago.
The party he follows and believes in can't find anyone better than Biden &amp; Harris to represent them.   You'd have anger issues too.
Everyone wants Joe Biden because Trump administration are CRIMINALS AND EVERYONE KNOWS IT.

Also, another out of context meme. The guy was getting in his face about the second amendment. Biden told him to stop being a horse's ass and that he doesn't work for him (a person who has a misconstrued view of the Constitution). So.. either way, Biden was alright here too.
Quit trying to prime people that the election will be fraudulent if you lose. There needs to be a peaceful transition of power if Biden wins

FAUCI said early January that masks weren't necessary. Trump listened to him.  FAUCI now said masks are absolutely necessary because he's aligning with Biden &amp; Harris.  FAUCI is a fraud. Dr. Judy Mikovits should be his boss &amp; the one firing him!!!!
Lol, I was suspended from Facebook for saying positive comments about Biden and Kamala
He’s right about the masks. And it’s really starting to piss people off. Between orders to wear them during a zoom meeting, to Biden’s absurd suggestion to wear them all the time, it’s bullshit. They don’t even work..... it’s like swatting fruit flies with a chain link fence.
Biden is a known quantity who has all the experience and attitude for the position. Kamala Harris is a slice of Americana - diverse in all her glory. The two will pull America back from the brink and restore her soul. That’s why I’ll vote Biden/Harris.
Any critique about harris &amp; biden running away from the press?
I’m doing my part to help, the Biden- Harris team to win this presidential election. ... just volunteered to work in the Demacratic campaign efforts for my county.
The question is, "if we have a Biden/Harris (let's face it, Harris) administration, how quickly will the entire nation look like Minneapolis, which is to say Kosovo?"
Because Biden does not support a candidate who believes in a batshit crazy conspiracy theory like QAnon.
Maher says Biden's lead over Trump too slim: 'Hillary was ahead by more' ... key takeaway here is Andrew Yang is wicked smart - Butigieg is a clown
Nah lol I can't get over the fact you just tried to tell me  I don't have a moral compass for wanting biden when you are literally a trumper 😂😂 nahh That made my morning

How Jennifer O’Malley Dillon transformed Joe Biden’s campaign ⁦
Looks more like the daily faux Trump virus update.  At least Biden tells American facts while Trump spews lies.
Because every time Biden speaks unprompted he says something absolutely stupid.
how can they keep getting away with this?? when will they be forced to actually answer questions? this is what they are planning to do for the next 3 months (Basement Biden and Kamala with a virtual bubble around her) -- how can it be stopped???
Biden doesn't lie every time he speaks. Reporters don't need to be combative when they aren't being lied to every 5 seconds.
If the Biden tv spots are right, his master plan (minus the whole socialism thing) is to do much of what  is already doing. Guess he’s never heard “if it ain’t broke...” #NoJoe
via  Yes. Very yes actually.

*If* Biden becomes president.Watching all of this and with trump's base willing to accept any wrongdoing and liberal infighting, fairly certain Biden is losing in Nov..I really want to be wrong about this..but an election stolen is still an election won when supreme court is 5-4.
Its trump's america though so try again..dont scare us with Biden's america..we saw 8 years of economic expansion and stable and intelligent governance..
Vote for Biden. That is all.
I+Could+Never+Vote+for+a+Biden-Harris+Ticket
Wanna know why Trump has a chance? Watch this "both sides who can tell the diff" piece of crap.  They normalize his insanity.  Your everyday person gets a distilled and sanitized version of a raving lunatic. MSM works *hard* to find reasonable statements.
The more you actually listen to what Joe Biden says, the worse this whole situation seems. :/

President Bush needs to endorse Joe Biden.  #HumanityOverPolitics
Did we forget that Biden wrote the 1994 Crime Bill that led to the MASS incarceration of black people and he DEFENDED this bill last in 2016 saying it "restored american cities"
Did we forget thar Biden has been coined a long time supporter of law enforcement, who advocated for increased police funding for "reform" in response to the Ferguson protests?
Did we all forget? Did we forget that there were tanks in Ferguson, MO while Biden was VP? Did we forget that rubber bullets were being shot at protestors while Biden was VP? Did we forget that the department of justice ruled Michael Brown not a victim, while Biden was VP?
Ima vote for Biden
Their idea of “leadership” is a socialist dictator style leadership. Biden said “It’s not about your rights.” That pretty much sums up the Democrat Party.
“Sacrificing humanity and morality to get a conservative judge is not moral,” she says. ‘Gerrymandering a district so you get a conservative elected is not moral.’  ‘I was really beaten up,’ adds Lemel. ‘Because I didn’t want to wear red and cheer for an idiot.’”  #ncpol #Biden

I think Romney would be well suited to be Secretary of State in a Biden administration.
Oh, Biden is still embarrassing. Absolutely. But on a much more amateur level than Trump.
I think even a lot of the GOP legislators silently would prefer him to 4 more years of Trump. Biden is someone they can work with, and knows everybody has to walk away from the table with something they need for their constituents.
Won’t be long before all the woke ppl will be reposting anti Biden/Kamala propaganda from fake Russian social media accounts.  will be a former Grand Wizard of the KKK and  will be Uncle Toms granddaughter by November just like they did to
HRC is dreaming.  If she gets a cabinet position under Biden, look for another “Vince Foster move”.   The battle between HRC &amp; KH while Biden is President would be epic. The kibitzing between Bill Clinton &amp; Obama will also be epic.

Every single Joe Biden commercial on my fucking TV is about the pandemic. These Democrat governors are 100% sandbagging opening and making it seem worse than it is. This is their platform.
Why is Biden on there!?!?
My thoughts exactly!
Get over it and vote for Biden!
Nothing you or Biden have proposed would improve the situation. Trump has advocated reopening the schools and the economy precisely to help those who are out of work and allow kids to get an education. Lockdown and wear masks until we have a vaccine is not a strategy.
She's staying in the Senate and watching you Biden and Harris 🧐.
Pretty sure NBA folks in the bubble had done much worse in regards to Trump
Same here, even if I have to camp out.  I’m going to witness my vote for Joe Biden enter that machine!
It drives him nuts that nothing sticks against Biden. Joe Biden has been in public life for an eternity. People just don't buy the attacks on him. People don't associate those things with Biden.
This is a pretty revealing tweet. He just can't accept that Biden can't be pinned down so easily like Clinton.
I'm planning to vote for Biden but I don't think the last 20 years would have been much different if Gore had won. Doubt this argument will convince anyone who actually thinks Biden and Trump are equivalent.

Masks narrative is about 1 thing - protecting #Biden from campaigning. If they work we should be able to go to sporting events, keep prisoners behind bars, send all kids to school. But he needs to hide in his #basement &amp; let his handlers tweet for him because we know he can’t
Biden campaign had better be working a strategy as well!
The top two candidates in the primary elections should be on the Presidential and Vice Presidential ticket- since those two candidates represent the majority of the voters. Therefore it should’ve been Biden and Sanders.
Please don't post Biden Gifs on my timeline... 🤣🤣🤣
And still KKK endorses Trump and all racists rally behind him..strange that your Biden is the secret racist attacks don't work when he was the running mate of first black man to be president and his running mate is going to be the first black woman to be vice president..hmm..
I am for the Biden/Harris ticket for President &amp; Vice President.  Please join me.
This is the exact thing I called out today.
If that's all it took to nullify your vote for Biden then maybe you weren't all that rogue to begin with and just another phony Republican acting as if they don't like Trump.

It's funny how Biden and Harris have flip-flopped on everything they once believed in, including each other. You don't think they'd trade people like they've traded values? They hold nothing dear, except power.
I'm supporting Biden/Harris.  You do you !  Be productive in whatever it is you do, young man !

Biden lost that vote during the duration of his whole career. I can’t believe lesser evilists are so entitled about this. Biden never had my vote during 2020 or the last 4 years.
When you &amp; George Bush came out and endorsed Biden recently, did you not think that we’d put two and two together to come to the conclusion that you both, somewhere along the way, became part of the deep state Democrat corruption?  Do you that poorly of law abiding Americans?

Thanks for the shoutout! 🌊💃🏻
The lefts position for as many elections as I can remember has been that if the GOP wins, life as the left knows it is over.  Harken back to 2012, Biden commenting on Mitt Romney "They're going to put you all back in chains."    So get out with your "partisanship" BS.

I’m seriously wondering if that’s not why Biden is saying that. It’s been proven over and over that they have little to no affect on prevention of the virus.
Trump is suing TV stations who run (truthful) campaign ads against him Trump's lawyers are working overtime to get a 3rd party candidate on the ballot to pull votes away from Biden in swing states
You are not just voting for Biden in November. If he was to claim presidency, there are serveral other appointed positions to be filled that can serve as change to our country.  These positions include the Attorney General, Supreme Court Seats, Secretary of Education etc.
Remember the long, long parade of Biden-alternatives from Democratic leadership? How the hell do you think Deval Patrick would be doing right now???
Vote for Biden. It's the only way to end this. No Marshal of the Supreme Court, no impeachment, no 25th amendment, and no handshake with a Brazilian minister who has COVID. There's just one thing we can do. I hope enough of us do it.
And you are holding millions of Americans hostage with this phony shut down of the economy. Your zeal to destroy Trump is dragging down the livelihoods of millions of Americans over what is no more than a bad flu season. I wager the masks come off November 4th if Biden wins.
Trump Lies, lies , lies.  Dems only want to help Dem run cities. Lie Dem cities are poorly run. Lie Dems want to close schools so they can’t be used 4 polling. Stupid Lie Mail in voting is fraudulent. Lie Biden asked him to mandate masks. LIE!  Aaaaaaah!

So the  poll (CPD used in 2016) released today asks about Biden and Trump and does NOT mention any other candidate. So when  hides behind their arbitrary requirement of 15% to participate in a debate, just remember, THEY AREN’T EVEN ASKING ABOUT OTHER CANDIDATES!

Do that at the debate Mr President.  So the works can see.  Go on.  Avoid.  And then watch Vice President Biden answer every question in complete sentences and in complete honesty.  He was so flustered because he doesn’t know truth.
Joe Biden is also a bad representative of my values, but that’s another discussion. What about when trump restricts in person voting and congressional democrats do nothing but tweet and send letters on their way to yet another recess?
Free infomercials?     Our local TV stations showed 4 interviews after Harris’s selection as the Democrat’s VP candidate.  They were nothing but non stop praise about her and Biden.
So Biden wants all Americans to wear masks for at least 3 months.....what is in 3 months? The election. #tinfoilhatthoughts
I saw a Trump commercial with a woman saying we can't rebuild if Biden is elected because he's too weak.  Biden should create, like a rap battle commercial response asking, "Now how did we get into this mess in the first place? Why exactly do we need to rebuild? Just asking?"
It’s very clear Biden said wear the masks for the next three months so that as soon as the election gets here they can say take the mask off and say it was their leadership that cured the country if they win. Just another ploy because one way or another Covid ends on November 3rd
Exactly. Their corruption is In Your Face, So What Are You Going To Do About It? It shakes your faith in people to know that so many voters will still vote for them in November. Biden's election is not a given.
Turn-out for Democrats exceeded 2016 and is on course to reach 2008 numbers.  Biden and Trump both got 18 million votes this year, but Democrats had 36 million total votes cast with a contested primary.  Biden wound up winning 51% of the vote.
Nobody's expecting Biden (or Trump) to fix all the world's problems. But it sure would be nice to have a President that wasn't actively making more!
Well for one nick cannon is a definite racist lol  but i mean obama picked joe biden as VP cause he was white so im pretty sure thats the only reason biden is picking kamala..and shes a women so even mor evotes
Very easily. Biden/Trump will focus on the NY/Calif voters, while not caring about the middle of the country. Why go to Nashville to get 500k votes when I can go to LA to get 5 million? Not getting into a political discussion but don't rewrite the constitution to benefit yourself
“And right after Reagan’s ‘wall’ speech, Biden again took the line that Reagan shouldn’t dare to provoke the Soviet bear.”  Sheesh...has Biden been right about ANY foreign policy decision?
No one even said they weren't voting for Biden in the thread so......????
We asked the public about a number of key federal and state races, but also surveyed their opinion on several political statements/slogans, such as: - Law and Order - Black Lives Matter - Defund the Police You can take a look at these results here.
If there is a fair election and the votes are all counted cleanly (big if), then Biden will win.  If Biden wins and Trump refuses to leave, then the US military is constitutionally bound, more than able, and will likely be very willing, to escort him out of the White House.
Biden &amp; Harris  Campaign 2020!
#ncpol On the same day   completes a poll showing Biden with a one percentage point lead.....
It’s hilarious that these people think Biden has any clue how to fast track an economic recovery. The first thing he will do is give away Nancy’s 3 Trillion dollars, then raise taxes by 4 Trillion while a ton of ppl are out of work. He’ll spend the SS money in his first month.For the next 3 hours, he makes numerous comments about “Covid BS”, his views on politics and Trump/Biden. While we’re playing golf. Which is a sport. The whole time, I’m thinking “does he understand #irony?” 🤷‍♂️

President Trump Schools Biden on Historic Middle East Peace Deal
The key word there is "try". Biden/Harris will absolutely try to do things we don't like, but anything big like that done without broad bipartisan support will either provoke an electoral backlash or be tied up in court for years. Probably both.
China Is the Key to Hollywood—and Joe Biden - Crisis Magazine
Now that we all saw how Trump tried to quid pro quo fake dirt on Biden from Ukraine, it would be a November surprise if a single person believed any report from  Barr or trump.
Biden will never get to choose!
In this Nation! Political differences are supposed to be based in ideology. Not criminal Activity from the Highest office down. Joe Biden belongs in Prison! Along with Hillary, Rice   Comey, Brennan, and every other person who has betrayed their oath of office for personal gain.
I would say that Biden is Catholic*** or quality it somehow.   Many priests won’t perform communion or other rites while he had a left leaning abortion agenda.  Seems like a fake religion like trump standing with a bible photo.
I feel you. If you just think logically, the dems were very divided in 2016.. and are pretty united right now. There is a female POC on the ticket, and several prominent republicans have abandoned Trump. Biden is the perfect centrist to peel away his support.
Did anybody tell Biden?
Hey, Democrats. I have heard the new Biden ads, in which he says that everyone has a right to be treated with dignity. Considering what he and Harris plan for preborn children, someone should explain to him what dignity means.
Biden and Harris receive favorability bounces, says a new Politico/Morning Consult poll.  Biden Favorable: 51% (+4 since Aug 10) Unfavorable: 44% (-4)  Harris Favorable: 45% (+12 since late July) Unfavorable: 37% (+3)

Not sure what I was expecting from Biden's VP pick, but it definitely wasn't this:

Well, Patrick...I’ve seen a mentally-challenged kid goes on with his daily life; so if that kid can do it, so can Biden! I believe in you, Biden! Bless your heart! 🤡  Who knows, might be fun to have the first demented person as president. 😝
Only if Biden steals the election
When pointing out a blatant lie from Biden, why is it necessary to state you’re not a fan of Trump? Just point out the damn lie!
If Joe Biden Speaks about anything, it is to build confidence in every American Child above the age of 5. That they are already intellectually developed beyond the level of a Democrat Presidential Candidate. And therefore they can accomplish anything if they so choose.
So are you writing a column about Joe Biden, since he just mispronounced her name????
I’d like to see side by side videos of Trump and Biden speaking. Somebody make one.
People must understand that the Democrats are NOT the party that "cares." They are that, you are voting foe party of genocide. if you vote Democrat, you are voting for killing the helpless.
Joe Biden's Awful Vice Presidential Pick
Hahaha, I completely agree. The Kamala Harris pick makes a lot of sense to me because she will immediately demonstrate an organizational competence the Biden and Trump both lack. It may not be impactful now, but when she has to speak I expect her to dominate the weak competition.
Thanks for sharing the good news! I’m even happier I get to vote for the Biden/Harris ticket now.
Trump's handling of COVID is the issue of the election, but there seems to be more at play here. Only 38 percent of Americans approve of his response. 58 disapprove. Biden's pathetic campaign is making this WAY closer than it should be.

Trump is stealing campain funds to pay Mar-a_Lago expenses. The FBI cares that he’s a criminal. PS- 4 bankruptcies, no he really didnt get rich running his private business. Plus Moscow Mitch is wealthier than Biden.  Nice job at misinformation,  typical MAGA fuck Shit!

BREAKING📢   Joe Biden just announced the next Vice President of the United States will still be Mike Pence.
Really? Did you watch the primary debates? Harris had one big moment (when she went after Biden) and then got taken down hard by Gabbard the next debate. Wasn't a factor after that. I doubt Pence is all that worried.

It's kinda hilarious that they actually slapped a tweet on an absentee ballot request form. It's also a flat out lie that Joe Biden wants to defund the police (he said he wants to increase police funding). They're grasping at straws here.
Biden shouldn't even be on there, Kamala Harris is a black woman but she's also the worst. I wanted a break I think and so when it was announced people around me (yts)..
I'm guilty of being one of those "WeLl wHat'S tHE AlterNatIve" ass people when it comes to Biden/Harris. I've realized it is because I want a snippet of sunshine. And then going down that rabbit hole, I realize I've been conditioned to accept crumbs...

I can accept Biden is not ideal. But Trump constantly sews the seeds of doubt into this republic. He calls into question the the very validity of our electoral system. Has made people completely distrust the press and the government over all. What he is doing is dangerous (1/2)
Harris &amp; Biden aren’t going to do jack shit for us, Biden made that clear when he scrubbed Warren &amp; chose Harris for his VP.  Harris takes money from Donald Trump, Ivanka Trump, Steve Mnuchin &amp; comes from a family that owned slaves.  So fuck it, Voting 3rd Party, then #Warren2024

There’s a Church Militant article strongly implying McCarrick (and maybe Francis) helped China engineer the coronavirus to cancel mass and get Biden elected. Tying that into QAnon is just one final step...
If i support Trump I am a racist awful person ... how come if you support Biden you are not a baby-killer, racist, communist, bully,  anti-American Values, hateful and bigoted ?
I guess you could stretch it that way. She was born in 64, Gen X is mid-60s to early 80s. But, nah, Harris is a Gen X.
Thankfully, Biden isn't even really running a campaign, so we'll never have to find out.
Why won't Joe Biden debate publicly?
I’ve been pretty exhausted by “attack” ads lately and have really admired Biden’s generally uplifting messaging. But this one isn’t bad at all.
Mood ever since Kamala Harris became Biden's running mate:
y’all really keep asking this question about Biden’s policies as if the average voter even cares... there’s an entire website and you couldn’t even be bothered to check  ????
I really couldn't care less about the cone of silence the DNC has decreed around Biden &amp; Harris.  As long as we bring out factual, demonstrable things about them with a bearing on their fitness/qualifications for office?  If their handlers can't deal with it, it's their problem.
joe biden has all the money and influence in the political world to put together the absolute best media/design team in history and they're literally putting clipart aviators on a sign in what has to be the most non-political political campaign in history
Yes -- and your point is? Biden's up 9% in the polls. The last time the final margin was that large for any candidate was 1984. The last time a Democrat beat a Republican by that much was 1964.
Apology not accepted, he meant what he said.
Biden and Harris are going to exponentially beat trumps body count

I’m sure Joe Biden will make a speech very much like this. We just have to VOTE and try to live to see it.
Mass has supermajorities in both houses and they could have made Baker pick a Dem.  I wish Warren would have won and would have been picked but I don't think the moment gave Biden the room to pick her. I would bet he wanted to.

Screw Biden. Let him stay in his basement and eat tapioca.
I don’t care how you feel about Biden/Harris. You should be helping to scrub the orange stains off the white walls
I would never suggest that, nor did I imply it.  I loathe Trump.  I am voting Biden and I will put my body in the line of fire when the coup comes.  But I am talking to you about our leaders, who are failing us.  Don’t defend them.
Electoralism can no longer save us.  Biden will not protect us.  Only direct mass action and a #GeneralStrike will stop fascism
Forget "Ridin'". How about Flyin' with Biden!  get the  #TeamRespectNoMalarkey treatment!  #UnitedForBiden #SignsAcrossAmerica #WeWantJoe #NCForJoe  #BidenHarris2020
You’re full of it if you think for one moment that:  a) Biden is collapsing under the weight of his own vocabulary, and  b) Harris is a racist.
Did that trigger you 😂😂 Biden is losing his mind Trump never had one. Neither should be president but I trust Democrats more than Republicans that’s for sure
Someone earlier whos screen name and picture was John Brown was saying vote for Biden.  Not in a million years would John Brown vote for segregationist Biden.  The gaslighting is nearing war crime levels.
I’m sorry, I can’t support this ticket, Joe Biden literally picked the worst woman, out of every woman that was in the running for the VP Slot.  The woman takes money from Donald Trump, Ivanka Trump, Steve Mnuchin, and came from a family that were slave owners.  Voting 3rd Party.
In the wake of Sen. Harris’s nomination as Biden’s VP, what is the Trump campaign doing to reach out to Black voters?  talks w/ NPR White House reporter  on the latest “Tested":  (📷 by Madeline Gray)
How much you want to bet?  The only ones caught have been REPUBLICANS.  Projecting again, you Trumpers are good at it.  Should have known what was coming when started the whole Biden sniffing hair thing.  NOW WE KNOW TRUMP HAS CHILD RAPE CHARGES.
Yes people who care about their jobs and the country are voting for Biden.
Biden was not my first choice Kamala was so I’m sticking with her &amp; Biden and stopping Trump’s toddler rampage

I volunteered for the Harris|Biden (you read that right) campaign and am getting texts about attending virtual convention viewing parties.   NGL, this sounds like the most boring thing in the history of politics.
Biden has been in DC since 1973.   Just think about that- it's the only "job" he's ever had.
When are you going to get a spine and stand up to Trump? You should endorse Biden/Harris NOW. Salvage your legacy by being on the right side for a change.

Read their platforms, compare their accomplishments, look at what their biggest supporters say, listen to them speak, then decide what direction you want to see the US go in for the next 4 years.  For me, Biden Harris is an easy choice to make.
Buy a novel to support Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. This month (August 2020) I'll be donating all of my profits from book sales to the #BidenHarris2020 campaign.
Personally, I think Biden's hilarious. About as wrong as wrong can be, and about as corrupt. But hilarious.
Short answer—vote for Biden anyway!
No. Biden is too inept and delusional to be the devil. He's more one of these clowns
reports GOP firm Harper Polling is out w/a new poll for conserv grp Civitas Inst, showing Cunningham leading Tillis 41-38, Biden up 45-44. Harper's last survey back in May had Tillis up 38-36 (only recent poll from a legit group giving Tillis the lead). #ncpol #Vote2020
Biden is still the best option but this “mask mandate” he has been pushing the last two days is a mistake.

I'm more concerned by her limited qualifications and "on the record" opposition with Biden.   In addition, Biden excluded 93% of the population by using race &amp; gender as a prerequisite for the job.  How is this acceptable??
I am 100% positive John Brown would not vote for segregationist Joe Biden.  JFC
Wake me up when we get to call crime bill "super predator" nothing will substantially change Biden racist.
Why?  At every opportunity the DNC has told the youth to get lost.  Why vote for people that do not care one bit what we want?  And yea Trump is bad. Thats not a good enough reason when Biden and Kamala have just as bad policies and will be more competent in their execution.
Nobody else thinks it's suspicious that Kamala the wrestler died ON THE SAME DAY that Kamala Harris was announced as Biden's running mate?
You may say, “Biden’s not left enough” or “Look at Harris’ record.” Guess what? Don’t care. Anything other than a vote for a candidate that can win and removes trump from office is complicit in allowing trump to continue his destruction of this democracy. 3/
Its fucked no matter what BUT at least with Biden/Harris we will get normalcy back in government. Basically we get Obama back. I see it as live to fight another day. Its not what we want but it'll do for now until someone better can come around for real change.
Yep. Biden/Harris ticket is not ideal at all. It will be centrism at its best with some maybe good bills that can get pushed through with no real progressive change but what are our alternatives? Nothing. I am voting for no reason other than a sense of normalcy in the WH again.
Weve been hearing this since the beginning.  This is fantasy. No one is coming to save us. Worthless Congress is on vacation.  Biden/Kamala srent the answer either.  We protect us. #GeneralStrike and revolution.
I’m sure she feels totally “destroyed“ after getting picked as Biden‘s running mate. 😉
'Deeply flawed': Catholics react to Harris VP selection  via
Do Biden or Kamala have a plan to decarcerste people or is it business as usual?  Harm reduction is false.
Yea it is. It would be absolutely understandable if under Obama/Biden poverty decreased, cops were held accountable for murdering innocent black folks, imperialist drone strikes stopped, and green house gas emissions decreased.  None of those things happened.
I am 100 percent on board with this. Biden and Harris need to be held to a high standard once elected, but the alternative to getting them elected is more Trump.
Ask Anita Hill about Biden's Supreme Court credentials
I mean, the majority of this list is either wishful thinking or just BS... but the few concrete points here are more than enough reason to vote for Biden, as shitty as he is
3 new national polls of registered voters were released today, with Biden leading by 10, 11 &amp; 13 points, all taken before the Harris VP announcement. Now you know why Trump is illegally destroying the USPS &amp; attacking voting by mail.
You have only 2 choices. trump or Biden. Depends on how much you regret it. If you vote for anyone other than Biden,  you ARE voting for trump. That unsure vote is the ONLY reason trump won last time!
This is a really good piece by  about the Obama-Biden relationship, which was always a lot more complicated and tense than the fantasy version of it.
Vote for Biden.
The democrats signaled that they don’t mind if Trump wins when they nominated Biden
Super classy, but makes the point: you won't need RM House in Biden's world. Govt-run medical system assures all sick kids will just be left to die.
After almost 4 years of everything we've seen Trump tweet, say, and have books and court cases about, having supporters ask us "how you can support Biden, he's so inappropriate" seems, I dunno, self-evident...
"We are better than this moment we're in." Joe Biden #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica
And Biden got his son a million dollar a year job in Ukraine by withholding US Aid. Yawn.
It always is.  Talking head on  :  Joe Biden is going to have to start answering reporters questions!    When is Trump going to answering reporters questions   Double Standard.
And there's no particular reason to be confident that partisan State Supreme Courts or even SCOTUS will be especially interested in resolving the Biden campaign's emergency petitions the way they are interested in hearing emergency Trump petitions
Response: I will answer when you ask hidin Biden about his half century of racism.
On one hand yes it SEEMS like the dozens of bad faith legal actions would eventually be resolved in the favor of Biden, on the other hand an 11th hour order granted by a random partisan state judge in a critical swing state could be terrible
Ideally this won't be resolved this year, and with no leadership and voiding all the horrible things done, we can have a humane approach in the Biden/Harris administration.
She lost the election. Not saying to wait, saying to fight them *now* which people won't do if they assume Biden will win.   I always have faith in Democrats to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory, especially when they act like they are in a fair fight when they are so not.
The latest poll from NPR, PBS NewsHour and Marist finds that:  📈 Joe Biden leads Donald Trump by 11 points. 📊 71% of Americans see the coronavirus as a real threat. 📉 35% of Americans say they won't get vaccinated.  More analysis here:
these articles are probably very useful for biden and kamala herself, who probably never thought to check into her eligibility
Harris is an empty suit, along with Biden. She's a pathological liar.
Majority of the people saying that no one should say anything negative about Biden &amp; Harris are Boomers &amp;Gen Xers. Maybe it's because they've consistently had to settle knowing that the government won't work for us. Millennials &amp; Gen Z don't want to settle. We want better.
Harris is an empty suit, along with Biden. She's a pathological liar. Amazing that the people running for the highest office in the land, do not know how the position even works? God helps us all!!
Both Biden’s are hidden.
Hillary Clinton suggests she's willing to serve in Biden administration: 'I'm ready to help any way I can'  #FoxNews. Help?  When has she helped anyone/anything except the Clinton bank account.
One under discussed difference between the Clinton and Biden campaigns is that Biden’s team have made early and consistent investments in the states that shocked us on election night ‘16 by voting for Trump.   Clinton effectively ran no campaign in several of these states.
Trump has been in office 3 years.  Biden has been in office 48 years.  What make you think Biden will do something now?   Albert Einstein : “Insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results.” ...  Say no to Joe!
Good point. I think conclusions about not having a policy mandate are difficult to make in polls that demand only one response. This one simply shows that getting Trump out of office is the highest priority for Biden voters.
Not sure you can reach this conclusion from a poll that requires you to select only one response. Getting Trump out of office is the highest priority for those voting for Biden. Full stop.
Trump, Biden tied in NC heading into this month’s nominating conventions #ncpol
Kamala supports forced gun confiscation. Choosing her has moved the Biden campaign further to the left on gun control – more radical than any other major party campaign in recent history. Kamala’s baggage has damaged the perception that Biden is a more moderate Democrat. #2A
Sounds good - I'll be making the case (and Christian case) to vote Biden/Harris as much as I can
As a survivor of CSA and rape, I am FAR more offended by this adult woman’s interactions WITH A CHILD than I am by anything Joe Biden has ever been proven to have done with anyone. She *deliberately* and continually crossed lines with this kid. That’s appalling.
TBC - "GO VOTE" means any way that doesn't rely on the mail delivering stuff. Biden better fix the USPS - one of our great institutions.
i really don't bother to embroil myself in p*litics related stuff but what exactly did joe biden mean with the whole "corn pop" story and his hairy legs? i feel like i'm having a TBI b/c i've been listening to this fucking video for 14 minutes and still don't understand context
I think if we frame it as an anti-Republican thing that would help Biden we could fool them into supporting it
I called him Rudy Colludy earlier today. He's asking ignorant questions about Hunter Biden and other people/things of no relevance to the election.
But it doesn’t matter if Biden loses 10% because of voter suppression. Trump can win this if nothing is done about him blocking voting from every direction.  With what I see, I think Trump will “win” and this is all so depressing.
Translation:  Trump: 50-57 Biden: 34-41  (Based on polls historically weighted 8-15% in favor of Democrats)
Between the last three minutes of that game and watching Biden try to keep this thing between the lines through November, I don't even need booze to be completely on edge and feel like shit anymore!
Well, the difference between these two is Biden will concede victory to Trump if the election result is proven to be fair whereas, as for Trump, he will refuse to concede no matter the result. That's the difference between an adult and a toddler.
Just saw a nice Biden ad though.

I am getting so disheartened.  Just as polls show #Biden leading and Trump floundering, I keep seeing tweets from pundits who say "he could win with the EC," or "what happens between November and January even if he loses" or about the USPS being decimated so he'll win.
Elizabeth Warren is a political virtuoso: the Joan Sutherland of politics.  I’ll go to my grave thinking about what could have been.  I’m voting for Biden but can he please throw us paupers a tiny bone 🦴...?

Trump should debate Biden 3 times and the fourth debate against Kamala since she’ll be governing
Sadly, also sounds like something the president would say too! Which is precisely the problem. Virginia mayor urged to resign after saying Biden picked 'Aunt Jemima as his VP'
We are digging mass graves now in America to bury those who have died from Corona virus. We have a facist President. This is our reality. Biden believes in Democratic process &amp; Biden will improve our health crisis. That’s all I care about at this point.
Dude, relax with the hard sell, I'm already voting for her and Biden
If Democrats - especially Joe Biden - don't show some bold and outraged leadership about the Republicans literally stealing our government right in front of our eyes, then I can only conclude that they aren't fit to govern us either.
A few months back I signed up for Trump's campaign mailing list out of curiosity. Not kidding...they sent me 7 emails the day Biden picked Harris as his VP. They all say exactly the same thing. Apparently those two are the farthest left candidates that the democrats could find.🤷🏽‍♂️
Right.  Trumps been in public office for 3 years.  Joe Biden has been in public office for 48 years.  Do nothing Joe.  Except make his family rich.
yeah me too, don’t get me wrong.  I am voting Biden.  But I do believe we need to push them to be better when we can

Question:  Kamala Harris ran in the primary all last year, and she's been the frontrunner for Biden's running mate ever since he got the nomination.  How are the Republicans SO unprepared for her?  Did they convince themselves that Biden would pick Warren?
Biden is a racist. I concur.
I pitched a story to a major national pub asking to go to SC simply to report out the narrative playing out in churches and other key spaces w some other Biden themes I had discovered. A editor kept asking “but what poll will you be basing this story on?”

They may try to charge Obama or Biden to affect the election. Now that Trump's crony controls the USPS, I worry about Democrat absentee/mail-in ballots being systematically thrown away based on some Saudi or Israeli algorithm Jared's buddies cooked up for him as a favor.
But but but how come Biden’s not up more in the swing states of Texas and Georgia?!?!?
YES. Biden and Harris need to always be this forceful and straightforward when talking about what Trump and his cronies are doing to the USPS. They need to regularly tell every American to drop off their absentee/mail ballots at their county elections board IN PERSON if they can.
Let’s be clear, if you don’t vote because you don’t agree with Biden’s pick. YOU ARE VOTING FOR TRUMP.

Trump morons and Joe Biden are opposed to MJ legalization .   That’s not a good look Joe.
Again I understand, and it’s an unfortunate situation we are in of not having a candidate that truly inspires us and speaks to us. However there are lives that are at stake. As shitty as it is fewer lives will be lost under a Biden/Harris administration.
Since we are comparing circumstances, Bernie wasn’t a realistic alternative after Super Tuesday. The momentum shifted and Biden clearly claimed victory. Polling and votes were against him.
I'm less concerned by her temperament than her qualifications.  In addition, Biden excluded 93% of the population by using race &amp; gender as a prerequisite for the job.  How is this acceptable?

47 years of zero and I mean zero accomplishments. He's had 1 job his entire life.  What new and fresh ideas will Biden bring to the table??   Stock market will hit an all time high this week.  TRUMP
He is an absolute sellout; and Biden has zero dignity
So actively cutting social programs is better?   I’m not unfamiliar with Biden’s shortcomings dude   The problem is that you, and other Twitter-only leftists have yet to provide a viable alternative that results in something other than a Biden or Trump presidency.
Biden is absolutely screwed
He’d have to go on record as a D president, opposing a bill passed by the D house and senate.   And M4A won’t get passed until it’s viable   Does voting for Biden change my ability to oppose him 4 the next 4 years? If neither candidate supports M4A, I’m considering other factors
No, 3+ years apart.  However, Biden has been milking America for 47 years! Numb nuts...
Trump shouldn’t even be allowed to run. He’s. Heated the entire time staring w/Giuliani digging up dirt on Biden in Ukraine, to Kushner colluding with Kanye for a bogus ballot run and Trump slowing down the postal service. He’s a dirt bag and a cheat!
I have a bunch of examples of what Biden has done and said—none of them positive. I remember, even though he probably doesn’t. 😉
Exactly! Someone (political blue check) said a desperate candidate asks for more debates. Hoping Biden denies and he can attack him for it? 🤷🏻‍♀️
Remind me how many states Joe Biden carried in his first two presidential runs before becoming Vice President of the United States of America?
Biden has nothing to gain by debating Trump. Nothing at all. He's already in the lead. When someone asks for an additional debate (the Trump camp just did) it means they know their candidate is tanking. That said, Trump won't do any, let alone four.
"He inherited the longest economic expansion in history from Barack Obama and Joe Biden. And then, like everything else he inherited, he ran it straight into the ground." -  🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I was sad for about 10 days after Warren dropped out of the race.   Then I dusted myself off and put on my big boy boots, because Trump is that bad.   If you need to be spoon fed reasons to vote for Biden-Harris, you're less reasonable than my toddler.
But Sanders endorses Biden. By that logic, he also isn’t a progresssive.
I wonder if this is like the World Cup where they print swag for all the top VP contenders? Or like the iPhone where Biden actually make his choice a while back and the printers were under NDA?
Yeah the OP wasn’t disputing that.  The point is that Biden was handsy with women and that made Reade more plausible.  Morse has no comparable, visible record of misconduct.  There is a really obvious difference there
While stricter gun control measures have at times been a major part of Harris’ campaign platforms, the issue was barely raised at Wednesday's press conference.
I was genuinely impressed by Biden and Harris modeling social distancing at this event. I know it’s a formality, but that’s the point. Leaders *should* model proper public health behavior. It matters!  I also love that they’re selling Biden/Harris masks.
Exactly. I plan to vote for Biden and bitch about him for the next 4 years, ideally he gets primaried but idk if it’s likely   Politicians listen to the people that vote for them, above all else (except money but that’s a different convo)
Anyone watching Biden/Harris must be able contrast the divisiveness of Trump. For the first time in 4 years I watched LEADERS who were kind, strong, positive- oh man, what a joy!!!!! #BidenHarris2020Landslide
How do you top the words of Biden and Harris which sounded like a beautiful symphony in contrast.
Milli Vanilli would be an appropriate analogy for Biden and Harris. 100% fake and full of poo.
Everybody but Ben Carson will vote for Biden/Harris.
The fact that Biden chose KH is still not enough to persuade this perennial republican to vote for someone who says the spawn of Hitler are "some good people" or that he wishes well to the pimp of a pedophile.  For the record, no, the spawn of Hitler have NO good people!
Hawkins/Walker. Only real choice. We must talk both past and present. Neither Trump/Pence nor Biden/Harris will address the pressing issues this nation faces. We must vote our values. #VoteGreen2020 #RideTheGreenWave
Biden and Harris make debut as running mates, vowing to defeat Trump  Try to keep your pants on Joe, your chance is coming.
Not sure who Biden is talking to. Certainly no one with an attention span longer than that of a gnat.
Democrats never do things straight forward or above board.  My belief is that they plan to get Biden elected and then, within 6 months remove him as incompetent, thus elevating Harris to POTUS.  Barring election fraud, it would all be done Constitutionally.  But it would be done.
$30 million in a single day from individual donors is an incredible feat for Biden and Harris.
But did not mention H1N1 which arguably killed more people than Covid.  Probably because the Obama/Biden response to that epidemic was nonexistent.
But avoided altogether a comparison to H1N1. Probably because doing so would show how Obama/Biden did precisely NOTHING to counter that epidemic.
Wouldn't surprise me if they try and charge Biden or Obama with some bullshit. Trump is a wannabe autocrat.
But they will scrupulously avoid mention of the Obama/Biden response to H1N1.  Which, BTW, was precisely NOTHING.
Just watched Joe Biden and Kamala Harris speak as a ticket. This is the first time I’ve been excited and energized by a VP pick! #KamalaHarris #BidenHarris2020
Just in case you forgot Joe Biden will be 78 in November.
This is the one positive. If Biden makes Harris head of his pandemic task force, it will be in the hands of someone that is extremely competent. Though the jury is still out on the states with Republican leaders ... I doubt they will be on board w any Dem plan
And notice, Harris mentioned Ebola, but NOT the H1N1 epidemic. That, of course, is because H1N1 arguably killed more people (under Obama/Biden) than Covid has.  I'm in no way minimizing or dismissing the seriousness of Covid. I'm simply trying to inject some reality into things.
“And like everything else he’s inherited, he’s run ot in the ground.” (the economy from Obama/Biden) the NEXT VP of the United States,
that would be great, i hope they do.  Biden’s current plan doesn’t even restore the tax rate to the (low) level it was at under Obama
Love this Beau Biden connection. And Joe and Kamala Harris bringing it up. And the specifics of their relationship. Makes me teary. It's SO good for parents to hear other people talk about their kids, no matter what age. Love that she did that. #BidenHarris2020
Sure that could happen...but why doesn't Biden win MS then, not to mention NC.  (Or OH for that matter.)
I mean that's fair but it's a bit of a strawman in Tucker's case. He went on an irrational rant about how it means she can't be criticized. It's not a big deal he mispronounced it. It is a big deal he didn't respect her enough to look it up or care he did. Biden clearly did.
What a delight to think of all the highly competent people who could be part of the Biden administration
Okay, sure Trump could win NH...but how does Biden win LA at the same time...while not winning MS...but winning GA...and not winning NC???
Biden doing a great job of singing Kamala’s praises as he introduces her now on CNN...
Biden says Kamala has our back, now it’s time to have hers...such a loaded statement.  I’m trying to be good today...I promise 😇
STARTING NOW: Biden and Harris give their first joint remarks as running mates. Watch live:
Remember when Biden introduced Obama as "Barack America" in 2008 when Biden was selected as VP?
Even  discredited this idea that Biden is pro-defunding when Chris Wallace interviewed Trump. Come on, NCGOP. Your arguments are in bad faith at this point.
Any minute now, Joe Biden and Kamala Harris will appear in Wilmington, Delaware, at their first event together. Don't miss their show-stopping opening duet on "Ain't No Mountain High Enough." It's sure to be amazeballs.
I like the way you think. But I also think Biden can win Montana and Alaska, so I may be a touch too exuberant.
I agree 100% with your point, but I don't get how it's related to Republicans trying to get Kanye to pull votes away from Biden.
His lead in North Carolina is probably about 2-4 points. And Biden got 50% in this poll, which is noteworthy in itself.
gahhhh... i want to watch this Biden Harris unity rally  with people who are fired up!   Stinks to have to socially distance
Joe Biden could not pick his own NOSE
May vote biden/harris to epically troll internet leftists and alt right at the same time
Wow Biden, you hit 3 with one stone. Great advertising, this will fool them. No, really.
It’s a surprisingly appealing pitch, and I think the Biden team knows it.
Update: Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden and his running mate Sen. Kamala Harris will speak at 4:30 p.m. ET.
Yep, I’m either doing that or just a write in.  I’m not voting for someone who has Dementia and is in bed with the Wall Street Executives &amp; CEO’s (Joe Biden) &amp; a Fake black woman who came from a Jamaican family that were Slave Owners &amp; takes money from the Trump Family (Harris).
WATCH: Joe Biden announced on Tuesday that California Sen. Kamala Harris would be his vice presidential running mate. They are giving remarks together at 3:50 p.m. ET.   📺 Watch live here:
(fwiw, I think if we play this election right Biden and Harris, to say nothing of Pelosi and Schumer, will have a caucus of Dems in Congress that is markedly to the left of the administration and will push them aggressively on policy. But that's my last shred of optimism talking)
C'mon man... Biden is still trying to decide, green or red jello.
I love this take.  Get Trump out of office but push Biden/Harris to get on board with policies you care about !!!
Biden/Harris still well ahead of you, Corona baby.
Lol 😂 joe Biden and Harris love locking up black folk... but they are the more logical pick for me
We need YOUR help getting the word out! Let's get everyone in NC *United For Biden/Harris* to win in November!  #NCForJoe #TeamRespectNoMalarkey 6/6
Biden &amp; Harris are not progressive enough. They have both done awful things. I’m disappointed that Biden is the Democratic Party candidate and that Harris is his chosen VP.   But I am still voting for them. And I think you should too.
I'm sure you were trying to look like Biden...right?
omg thought it was Biden lol
My point is that she has multiple allegiances and her loyalties aren’t necessarily to blacks especially black Americans. She &amp; those behind her play up the “black woman” thing when it’s convenient. She adds nothing to the Biden ticket imo. Her presidential campaign was a failure
Any % of voters voting for Kanye is detrimental to Biden and helpful for Trump. If you don’t get that, idk what to tell you.
So what? The dispute is not that the prosecutor was corrupt; the point is that Biden was on the take, so he pushed the firing for his own personal ulterior motives
I need news stories about woke police unions backing Biden/Harris
Biden Harris 2020 let's get it done!
Voting for Joe Biden only feels like the only option if the arc of your political participation begins and ends with the electoral process
So what I'm seeing is this: Socialists hate Biden because they think he's a Republican, and Republicans hate him because they think he's a socialist.
Republican attack ads here are doing all they can to associate Biden with AOC and other progressives in an attempt to scare voters, because they know it has a chance.
I think Biden and Harris have a chance to get as much done as a more progressive team, due to having a lower fear level than a truly progressive team.
And the supposed extent to which a candidate is Jewish is no way the determinative factor for me in this election. "Trump or Biden? Hard to say so I'll just go with the one the Jewish establishment can convince me is most Jewish!"
I do get asked about candidates' faith. Here's something I found.  5 faith facts about Biden’s veep pick, Kamala Harris — a Baptist with Hindu family, via
Meanwhile the GOP has moved further into total unreality and gaslighting at the behest of a buffoonish would-be fascist. Maybe the mainstream democratic part has moved very far left (doubtful given that Biden won the primary), but the GOP has shown that they believe in nothing.
I mean, yeah I’ll vote for Biden but I’m gonna angry cry while I do it
Just call them female Biden supporters. 😌
Who am I kidding? All the people mad at me for not being excited about a Biden/Harris ticket will likely cease all political engagement until around this time in 2024
If you hate the system, GOOD.  We can’t change the system without a voice in the system.  Unless you’re happy with Trump as your voice, you have to vote and you have to vote for Biden.   Do I like it? No! But is it what we’re faced with? Yes.
There’s no statement to be made with a protest vote if the person in office won’t even acknowledge the protest.  If he wins Trump will set us back YEARS.   If you vote for anyone but Biden Trump will win.   Period.  It is the harsh truth of our broken system.
Righties saying Kamala called Biden a racist when she explicitly said he isn’t when asked, pointedly, after the relevant primary debate by a reporter last year is relevant.    They’re going to use “woke” as a proxy for exoticizing her and sadly it will work with some anti-wokies.
Seeing a lot of Biden/Harris hate on my TL.  And I get it, I do.  But there is no world in which they are comparable to another 4 years of Trump/Pence.  In order to progress in any way Trump has to be voted out this election cycle.  Period. End of discussion.
I can't wait to see y'all try to push Biden left
I should donate to get a chance to speak to both Biden and Harris, so that way, if I am picked, I can just tell them to “Fuck Off” and “Fuck You Both for using us and being in bed with the Wall Street Corporatists.“  And also thank Harris for taking money from the Trump Family.😉
Joe Biden just did.
Trying to say  should be in Biden's cabinet, now that she didn't get the VP nod, where you can't push progressive policies like she can in the senate is honestly kind of a slap in the face. She deserves better and her expertise cannot be confined to one area.
I’m mostly just looking forward to her making those lefties’ heads explode tbh. Lol  kAmAlA iS a CoP   Between that and “Biden is Antifa” the opposition to the ticket is running very thin and is poorly thought out.
Maybe vote Green &amp; just say you rode the Biden bus.
I'm going to be on edge the probability of Biden being elected is 100%, which will not occur until the votes are tallied and the election results certified.  Until then, we need to encourage people to vote like their lives depend on it.
White people saying Hillary lost because we talked shit about her &amp; that we shouldn't be critical of Biden and Harris while voting for them. Politicians need to be held accountable. Even when campaigning they have to serve us, because we are giving time &amp; money to help them win.
A lot of justifiable anger out there as well, especially around prison/police abolition and Kamala's history with it. But I would argue there's more room for holding the Biden/Harris admin accountable on progressive demands than a Trump admin with an even worse track record
rich celebrities are so quick to support biden and kamala because they will always be protected by society, regardless of what's going on in the world.   they won’t have to deal with our struggles in the same way.
Its just tiring "we have to vote Biden in so we can get real change later"  No one sees we are actually going backward, nothings getting fixed, but the rich are getting richer, black and brown people are imprisoned more, climate is deteriorating.  What is it gonna take?
Cool imma vote for Biden
What was going on in the head of the consultants that thought Kamala would get Biden even one more vote in a swing state than he already had.  Is there something I'm missing?
But I’m sure this won’t be the end of that right wing ad about how Biden’s America will be scary and cop-less showing up on my tv bc Joe Biden is so ~radical~
Biden +2 and DePasquale +2 in #PA10
Also true. The public wanted something done about crack. The original CBC bill accomplished that without centering incarceration. That’s not what Joe Biden and the Clintons sold to the people
Bernie is all in for Biden/Harris.  Let's take a page from his book and unite to take our country back and govern with compassion and humanity.
👆👆👆 And allies that Biden and Kamala would consider "anarchists"  They would just do it "legally" and eith the backing of neoliberals
We've lived for four years under a man who can never be criticized. If the only people who can serve in Biden's White House are people who have nothing negative to say about it, we're in for four more.
The other thing I'm super sick of is the hot take that Harris has recently criticized Biden on the debate stage and therefore she should have rejected the VP pick. Why? Criticism is good. I hope she keeps criticizing him all the way to the Oval and in it.
Imagine telling politically engaged, complex, sophisticated, intelligent people who are struggling with a myriad of problems that Biden/Kampala are the "most progressive" ticket in US history.  Its shameful and embarrasing.  We have cspan and records. Its a bold faced lie.
I be seeing y’all tweets and be like:  Yeah there’s no way they have read up anything on Biden fr lol guys when I do ya research, ian telling you to hack the NSA. Im telling you to go the man campaign website😂 its allll there🤯 crazy right.
If you email me or message me and your "climate focused strategy" is to canvas and vote for Biden/Kamala.  Please dont talk to me and leave me alone. Thanks.
The CBC knew the Biden bill was bad, and offered their own version of the bill that focused on drug treatment, mental health, community interventions, demilitarization of the local police, and racial justice. White Congresspeople and bitch ass Lacy Clay stripped it of everything.

This is where we diverge. I do not believe I owe the Democratic Party my loyalty. I will vote, bc voting is important to me; but I am not sure I will vote for a major party candidate. And if I do not vote for Joe Biden and he loses, I will not be convinced that it is my fault.
I can’t wait for y’all to say “c’mon man, there was crack everywhere” in defense of Biden bankruptcy bill.
Joe Biden's Awful Vice Presidential Pick
Biden is a practicing catholic. Why do you spew lies to stoke hatred and divisiveness?
Apropos of future Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Cory Booker, I was interviewing Barney Frank for something recently and he said that, if Biden wins, Biden should put Mike Bloomberg in charge of HUD.
Telling Progressives that they should be happy while voting for Biden and Kamala is like telling women they would look prettier if they smiled more.
Same. Exactly. I was excited to vote trump out but now I’m also excited to vote for Biden and Harris. I can’t wait.
Electrifying!
I like this too. Biden is actually tilting his head down. Body language tells me SO much about someone.
#Fact Check:  🗳While #Biden and #Harris may not have been your first choices, at least they know the “1917” pandemic didn’t end WWII  🗳The 1918 pandemic caused tens of millions of deaths worldwide in 1918 and 1919, not 1945  🗳It did sicken soldiers during the final year of WWI
Biden and Kalama are bad for Black people when it comes to crime.  But Tony The Tiger has been bad for Black folk economically
LOL she's a self-declared "Top Cop" of California. How will THAT play out? She also said she believed Joe's accuser! OK so the Top Cop believes Biden is guilty of sexual harassment!! but now you pander to the left, hilarious
i just had a class of 3rd graders shit on Trump so hard lmao they dont fw biden either tho
“Harris might also be a good policy influence on Biden if he treats her as a real governing partner, as he hopefully will. Here are three reasons why.” #progressives #KamalaHarris
Y'all are really ready to fall for the jig.  Black people are still suffering. Having a black VP won't change that. We celebrated Obama like Jesus was here and did he save us?  Is there doubt in ANYBODY'S mind we will continue to suffer under Biden/Harris?  Wolf in sheepskin.
Glad I didn't have to see Biden at the dentist, tho.
"Make no mistake: Putting a qualified person of color like Harris — whose parents are Jamaican and Indian immigrants — on the ticket is a statement against President Trump."  Takeaways from Joe Biden picking Kamala Harris from
I dont wanna sound flippant but yea.  Community is your best defense. And cant fight if your hungry. So priorities.  "Under no pretext"  Its why Biden/Kamala scare me. They are perfect for instituting a disarmament of the working class while upgrading the militarization of cops.
a voter rights org put together by basketballer  may have an important impact in this crucial election. We need this. All hands on deck! #Vote2020 #Biden #KamalaHarris2020
We’ve heard your racist misogynistic attacks before. BORING. Biden/Harris. We have your backs.
🌊 twitter:   "In this essay I will show how Biden and Kamala will take the exact opposite policy position they have historically taken and are actually more progressive than MLK, Stalin, Bush Jr. Climate change will be so afraid it will stop on its own. Vote and donate!"
Neither Joe Biden nor Kamala Harris were inevitable selections. They were chosen, and different choices could have been made.
No question about it, As a suburban housewife I would climb mountains to vote for Biden and Harris!  #BidenHarris2020
GOPmay not be willing to do anything about trumps racism, misogyny dog whistles, but women of color, white women, suburban women, will do something about it on Nov. 3rd.  We have Biden/Harris ticket backs that’s for sure.
Kamala Harris is a f**king warrior, and that’s what Joe Biden needs right now. She will also make an excellent POTUS, whenever that time comes.   All the rest is noise.   #BidenHarris2020
Way too close for comfort.  We still have plenty of work to do.  Let’s get on it.  I just donated to the Biden-Harris campaign.
do Postal workers vote for Biden given  intentional actions to harm USPS and the wonderful people that work so hard for our country?
I think the pro is she energizes some of the DNC progressives that were disappointed in Biden.   I think the con is she doesn’t inspire independents or nevertrumpers.
How is Biden trying to manipulate you? This just seems like catastrophising.
If this was your original tweet (which doesn’t include using Warren statements as an excuse to not vote for Biden) I wouldn’t have taken any issue with it.  You don’t owe anyone your vote.
I’m talking about Biden and Warren.
Saying Biden is saying something when he isn’t and getting frustrated about it is silly.   The SJW part is about how you mentioned his statement as if he didn’t publically apologize for it.
you fool. vote for Biden/Harris or you're voting for cheeto.
You can run through the same hypocrisy on the new right. Nothing about Trump’s spending says “fiscal responsibility.”   But I digress. My point is this prediction and Dems who had a primary choice other than Biden prophesying that X candidate would have crushed Trump is...wild.
Warren isn’t on the ticket, and Biden isn’t saying that.
What kills me about this is: 1) He either doesn’t remember that Biden was the “Catholic on the ticket” in 08 and 12, or is asserting that he’s not a catholic because of his abortion stance.  2)I wonder if he counts Pence as a Catholic because he grew up catholic before converting
Congratulations on being selected as Joe Biden’s VP.  #Bigsupporter #excitment #infectioussmile #ruleoflaw #beconofhope
Endorsement of Biden-Harris from Governor Roy Cooper of the great state of North Carolina. 🙏 🇺🇸
Let me just say to all the people that are hating the idea of Biden/Harris. The alternative will destroy America. The SC is going to lose RBG and I hope she can hang on until Nov. Do your protest voting or nonvoting in 2024 after we get rid of the sociopath in the WH.
This isn’t even “Chomsky on Biden,” it’s Chomsky on the difference between voting and doing the work, and how people gotta be prepared to do both.
You said “choosing not to vote for a candidate that doesn’t align with ideals”  Your options are literally Biden, Trump, or not voting
It is unreal to me how people are talking about not voting for Biden because of Harris. Unclench your privileged ass.
In answer 2 latest Trump stupidity (he said Americans will have 2 learn Chinese if Biden is elected) I am ready 4 that, Donald, I have taken 2 years of #Mandarin
“Biden may also face an outgoing administration that hinders his efforts, whether because of incompetence or malign intent. Planning, coordination, and information-sharing across government agencies and functions is vital to a successful transition.”
If you’re on this app referring to Biden and Harris as “flawed candidates,” you should refrain from ever talking about politics ever again. Vote for your cops, and leave the rest of us alone.
You mean the base that got wiped out by Joe Biden? Not much of a base.
I voted for her, but if Biden/Harris win, Warren could become Secretary of Education or part of their cabinet in another way. It may not be over for her just yet.
Today's rule: every person who yaps about how Joe Biden is "building a bridge" should go watch "The Bridge on the River Kwai" to see how well the bridge building thing worked out for Alec Guinness. "Madness! Madness!" (Actually, just call quits on today &amp; watch a great film.)
#Bunkerboy is just predicting his biglee loss to the Biden Harris ticket
I hope I'm wrong. I hope the election happens relatively unimpeded and violence free. I hope Trump loses. I hope people snap out of the brainwashing. I hope biden/harris is the most "progressive" admin and takes real meaningful physical actions on racial, social, climate justice.
Trump’s failure to contain COVID has absolutely cratered the economy. Not talking about numbers on Wall Street. Talking about people’s lives, and jobs!  Voting for Biden, and Harris.
I mean is he supposed to openly disparage the nominee and vp pick because he lost? Or is he smart and understands that it will be far easier to get movement on his agenda under Biden/Harris than Trump/Pence? Idk what this tweet changes?
Biden could have picked Donald trump jr as his running mate and I’d still have to vote for him, why does anyone care who it is
Biden/Harris voters in swing states without much experience with mail-in voting - Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, North Carolina &amp; Florida - should shun mail-in voting &amp; vote early, in person.  I’m in.  I’ll take the risk. Others risked far more to make sure their vote counts.
I know people who post pics of their ( rightfully) jailed cousins who can't stand Kamala. Biden ain't getting that vote 😂😂😂😂
It goes so far out of bounds. He is supposed to be apolitical. Talk about bias. He needs to resign. He needs to be held accountable even after Biden wins.
Biden struggles with green or red jello.  He didn't pick Harris.
Well best of luck in the election then. I hope Biden and his disaster of a pick will make you proud 🤣🤣🤣  You don’t look long for this world, however. So perhaps whether Trump wins or not (he’s going to win in a landslide), you won’t have to endure him.
If Biden is elected, they'll take credit for anything in the pipeline that will stem it.  If Trump is re-elected, they'll pillory him for having those same things in the pipeline and not on the market.
Well, why don’t you ask the President of Ukraine? He just named Biden as an accused party in a crime yesterday. 😃
Crucial thread. Look we have to vote Biden/Harris- but we also have to know exactly who we’re electing. Harris is pro-police, pro-war, pro-corporation &amp; has voted to further oppression of BIPOC Americans COUNTLESS times. Ethnicity &amp; gender do not a hero make.
Many “Christians” don’t think we Catholics are Christian.  Not all Catholics are Christians, but not all Christians are Christians either.  Living your faith is a choice-they shall know him by his fruits-Biden is a Catholic in name only.
So, to translate it out of CNN-speak...  Kammy will assume the office of president as soon as the DNC declares Biden unfit and  removes him. I conservatively estimate within 5-6 months.  Assuming, of course, that the American electorate is stump dumb stupid enough to elect them.
Legally, I don't know of a stipulation absolutely requiring a VP.  If I am correct, it would have been tactically better for Pelosi had Biden run without a VP.  Because in that case, should anything happen to Biden, Pelosi would, as Speaker, succeed to the Oval Office.
Me, now until Nov. 3: Biden/Harris 2020! Get on the bus! Me, for the entire ensuing four years: we elected you, now do your job, according to your electorate, who elected you. Imagine the damage the Trumpists could've done if they demanded real work out of their president
In the abstract, Biden and Harris are uncomfortably close to the center for my taste. But, pragmatically, my next president said "holy fucking shit don't drink bleach what is wrong with you people", and the next VP made little poop pellets come out of Barr and Kavanaugh
So, Biden was part of an administration that passed on prosecuting the previous administration for very clear crimes that could've stuck, at least for some. Heal and move on, I get it. But can a Biden/Harris ticket ignore the clear mandate that justice must be served?
So, what do you think is next For Elizabeth Warren?  You think she will have a Prominent Position in the Biden Administration like, Secretary Of State, Secretary Of Treasury?  Or do you think she will stay in the Senate and then make a run for President in 2024?  #Warren2024
I love how excited Kamala Harris’s colleagues are about her selection as Joe Biden’s running mate. People who worked with her back in the day and people who work with her now have all said how great she is.   It’s nice to have candidates who just know how to work as a team.
Furthermore, Kamala Harris took money from Steve Mnuchin in 2016!  Kamala Harris for the people???? Riiiiiight, for the people My Ass. She only looks out for herself &amp; nobody else.  Fuck Kamala Harris, Screw Joe Biden, I'm Voting 3rd Party.  #Warren2024
Kamala Harris Accepted Donations From Donald Trump And Ivanka Trump, you honestly think she will do anything to him? No, she will let Donald Trump &amp; his Criminal Enterprise Walk!  As far as I'm concerned, Both Harris &amp; Biden can go to hell.  #Warren2024
If you do get a cabinet spot, do you think Biden will support any of your policies? I fear that it will be like Robert Reich in the Clinton administration. You would be better off running for mayor of NYC. Don't get burried by this establishment administration.
You said on your podcast that you expected to have a spot in Biden's cabinet. Do you still believe that after this? I fear they're just using you for your supporters and you'll never hear from them again after the election. They're engrained in the institution you are fighting.
Independent voters who don’t like Joe Biden’s VP choice in Kamala Harris and are threatening not to vote for him now are essentially guaranteeing another 4 more years of the worst president in US history! C’mon! We have to stick together and see this through! #BidenHarris2020
I much rather prefer #HeelsUpHarris, with no mention of Biden. He’s as lost from this ticket as are his marbles. 🤣🤣
At the end of the day, it’s whether you want Trump back or not. I hate to over simplify it but🤷🏽‍♂️ ur options:   Vote for Trump.....  No vote (which) = Trump vote  Kanye vote (which) = Trump vote   Vote for Biden
I willlllllll...NOT be voting for the Biden/#HeelsUpHarris ticket!   #Trump2020 #KAG2020 #TrumpTrain
you really are terrified right now aren't you ? yeah all the progressives in the Dem party are not happy with the pick right now but most will suck it up and vote for the Biden\Harris ticket. But you say she is radical and too far left. Sure that makes sense. Go with that. LOL
🐷 FUCK KAMALA 🐷   IF BIDEN DIES, BERNIE IS THE PRESIDENT
Biden is a sellout. Kamala is a phony
Keep this in mind before your rush off to vote for the Segregationist/Cop (Biden/Harris)  ticket, folks! 😃👍🏼 #BidenHarris2020 #BidenHarris
It really does say that Biden has great BRAINS !!!
Did Biden ever say, "grab em by their p...y?" And excuse it as "locker room talk?". Did Biden ever have to pay off a porn star?  How many of Biden's cronies are in jail?
Waiting for his “Biden/Harris” fundraising email
That 17 year old who hacked Joe Biden’s account for a Bitcoin scam should have announced his Vice President instead. Huge missed opportunity
Val Demings would have been a Tim Kaine like choice for Biden, imo.   VPs gotta compliment the Pres.  Pence was the straight man and got religious cons.  Biden added experience and foreign policy.  Don't see what Demings would add b/c she is so similar to Biden in many ways.
why couldn't we have this race instead of the lame one we're stuck with?  Also we should run Hunter Biden on the Green Party so it's a 3 way brawl
The party ideologically is closer to Bernie (single payer gets 60% in primary exit polls) but loves the Obama years and they really want to beat Trump.   I expect the Sanders wing to go all out in '24, assuming Biden does not run again.
This reads like a Biden interview
Right? Biden was pro-choice on his previous two Dem tix/wins. Tim Kaine's pro-choice. Same with John Kerry. By this pedo-protecting bishop's standards, the numbnutz should be pouting that there's never been a single Roman Catholic candidate on either party's ticket.
Predicable: WaPo was going to say this about whatever running mate Biden chose.
i don’t wanna see any of y’all not showing up to the polls because you don’t like biden or harris because you know damn well trump supporters will be showing up and voting for his stupid ass
The LOL of the day today comes from a  fundraising email about the Biden/Harris ticket. "These two liberals are as far-left as they come." 😂🤣😂🤣😂
I’m backing Biden and Harris 2020.
Biden leads Trump in Georgia, a state that Democrats haven't won in a presidential race since 1992
Ppl who think we gotta support biden/kamala because there is a white supremacist in the white house have a fundamental misunderstanding of what white supremacy is lol Trump is just loud. Biden's version and Kamala's adjacency have been/are/will be awful for millions of ppl.Harris is going to humiliate  Biden will defeat the Liar in Chief.

WATCH: Biden Repeatedly REFUSES To Answer Reporter’s Questions. Trump Shreds Him. | The Daily Wire
I was 11 when Obama was inaugurated. I didn’t even know Biden existed until high school 🥴

All of a sudden, Joe Biden wants to invest heavily in Black businesses. GTFOH!😆 MFs trying to take advantage of BLM in order to get votes. Ill vote for Trump before I do Biden. At least Trump's upfront about being an asshole.
Biden’s record and Kamal record are moderate as the day is long. You know liberal about some shit conservative about some shit.. why do you think all the Bernie bro’s hated Biden
My bias! Ha I gave this president a shot, he lies and gaslights his way through 3.5 years I’m done. Time for a change.. and unfortunately Biden is all I got. The libertarian candidate is a joke. I voted Gary Johnson in 16, nobody was more qualified, vote wasted
This is a problem not Trump.  Use to be a fan of yours not anymore. Smh.

Hey All, Just wanted to let you know that I registered to vote in NC yesterday morning. Registered unaffiliated but will vote Biden-Harris &amp; the entire Dem ticket unless I am dead! #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica  #BurnitDown  Check your registration.

Trump also urges Americans to wear masks but opposes a national requirement. Plus: The NFL tries to virus-proof stadiums, and local school officials struggle with reopening difficulties.

I have to wonder how much of Biden's choice of running mate is because of her abilities  and not because of the pressure to choose a woman of color. Doesn't matter in this household though. We are all Trump all the time. #voteTrump2020

Watch Now | Biden and Harris appear together Wednesday at a high school in Biden’s Delaware hometown to discuss their shared vision for how to defeat President Trump. STREAM LIVE:
Maya Rudolph, portrayer of Kamala Harris on "SNL," admits she could be busy ahead of the election after Harris was announced as Joe Biden's running mate.
Joe Biden probably does support antifa though...to be fair
Well thank goodness Biden, who you endorsed, is a M4A warrior. Right?
That is a good plan not to let Biden talk
That is such total utter BS. Biden is probably the most devote church goer in politics. He has never tried to take guns or support any such legislation, limit them yes,put restrictions yes but never to take away. He supports the police.
Biden is sickening
Biden might’ve been racist 30 years ago but he isn’t today. Trump is racist TODAY with racist polices. The choice is so obvious. Biden/Harris or this👇
Seriously, did Biden even have a good pick option? Biden is a mindless idiot, what sort of pick was he? The Democrat party is a sad joke.
The worst decision ever!!!! And unfortunately it’s doing what they want it to do.... pull Votes away from Biden/ Harris !!!
All smoke and mirrors with Biden/Harris. Educate yourself American public. Really listen to their promises. Nothing is free. Our country will be in big trouble with Biden. He can’t even complete a thought  And he’s going to protect us?  I could go on and on.
But Biden can't do it. LMFAO!
My current election prediction as of Aug. 12th, 2020. Biden with 319 electoral votes, and Trump with 219 electoral votes. My prediction is based on the FiveThirtyEight election model.
Honestly bruh at this point he is not looking like a bad canidate, Biden doing way to much for me
Fox News Insists That Joe Biden Didn’t Really Pick Kamala Harris. This just in, FOX news insists world is really flat.
Fox News’ Chris Wallace: Trump Wishes Biden Had Picked Anyone But Kamala Harris
Now be fair and do the same with Biden.  Neither of these men should get a pass.
Presidential candidate Joe Biden and vice presidential candidate Kamala Harris are preparing to speak from the gymnasium of Alexis I. duPont High School in Greenville Delaware.   I posted this primarily for the second part of the sentence. 🐯🐾💙💛
Is Biden amazing, NO but he IS the BETTER choice. Anyone EXCEPT KANYE is better than TRUMP. Hell put The Backyardigans in that bitch!!
Chris Wallace hit the nail on the head!
if you don't vote for Biden, he said you're not black. Also, according to him the black community isn't as diverse as the latino community.
lets vote for biden!
Imagine being concerned abt Biden/Harris when this is the alternative... This is flat out racist cmon
"At the end of the day, that dame just had the best smelling hair.  And that's no malarkey." - Joe Biden when asked what tipped the scales for Kamala Harris.
Me and a Biden Administration.
We don’t have time to play around. We played around enough to have Biden as our only choice. Let’s not make it harder for us and give West the time of day.
Joe Biden choosing Kamala Harris is better than Christmas #BidenHarris2020 #trumpisdumbasfuck
Y’all sucking dick if you think ima vote for Biden
Biden is who we deserve, but not who we need right now
I was wondering the same thing. Black women were going to vote for Biden regardless.
So you would rather have Biden/Harris and the rest of the Democrat (Socialist/Communist) party destroy our Republic as they have been planning for the past 60 years?
First of all, your vocabulary needs work Mike. Second, Harris is no role model. She put hundreds of thousands of black Americans in prison for very minor crimes or no crimes at all. She is the ancestor of slave owners. She accused Biden of rape, now she loves him. Surely you jest
If we are firing the liar the only people we will be firing is Biden and Harris.  Get used to it Princess,  we WILL re-elect POTUS and we WILL change congress to all RED.  We will NOT allow this country to go Socialist!
Biden said he will legalize weed , I say take that money and pay Reparations they have done something similar in Illinois,but as  a whole ,there fighting giving cash and it's about cash and I want land , so I can be left alone
This dickhead created a photo with my wife’s pic and Joe Biden. My wife is a Trump Patriot! Litter his page with Trump pics and memes!!😡
Comes from a family that owned slaves  Said Biden is responsible for raping women, but now supports him  Is that enough for you?
You think people are illerate or stupid? Thank you for googling something for everyone. There was more googling of MONOTHEISM after Biden’s practiced comment trying to backtrack his offensive description of black ppl.
She wont be able to save him. Its a smoke screen to get the votes that he wouldnt get. Looks good on paper, but Biden has to defend himself and thats the nail in the coffin.
We're back! New episode dropping between 2:30 and 3:00 this afternoon 😁 #KamalaHarris #BidenHarris2020 #JoeBiden #Biden #RidinWithBiden
Regardless of Kamala turning back on her takeaways from Biden... it’s still necessary. I don’t even care about all the rah rah because Trump has to leave. He must.
Southern voters reward people who pay they’re dues. Obama being the only exception. And he won SC by a smaller margin then Biden and H. Clinton.
TFW Trump has done more about prison reform and marijuana legalization (First Step Act, Farm Bill) than Kamala and Biden.
Yea, really feeling the friendship blossom, especially after the DNC Convention snub.   Can't tell me Biden doesn't have any leverage over who gets to speak there.
Of course Trump doesn’t understand why Biden picked Harris! Trump surrounds himself only with people who kiss his ass. He would never understand the selection of a powerful, competent woman who will have different experiences and opinions, and from whom he could sometimes LEARN!

Dementia Joe Beijing Biden has been confused most of his life and on the wrong side of most major decisions. So where does he get the idea he would make a great President?? Even Barack told him to leave it alone...
She is not eligible to be President. She is an anchor baby. She cannot replace  Biden.
Even few of my social media friends who are conservative are so mad about her... it’s strange because they didn’t say anything about Biden to my face. Honestly, if they got mad then it’s absolutely total nightmare for them.   Not my problem.   We go forward together.
I’m not gonna lie. I’m definitely one of those people who are questioning Biden/Harris 😭😭😭😭 but I refuse to vote for trump so it’s really no choice, we fucked either way. Might as well be fucked w/ Biden. It’s still just bullshit to think about 🤣
Can't even think about a Biden Cabinet. Booker to Bernie. Wake up America.
Joe Biden and Kamala Harris: The Most Pro-Abortion Ticket in American History
No, I wouldn’t expect him to have the decency to congratulate the new president.  He would feel belittled, embarrassed and humiliated standing behind Biden at inauguration.  More likely to have a Twitter kniption fit from Florida on Inauguration Day.
Biden reportedly mocked for using script to tap Kamala Harris as his running mate. Ohh the scandal. A piece of paper near the laptop. Where is the FBI? Where is the investigation?
And you said Biden has a racism problem ??
Biden/Harris is the anti-black male ticket!
Don’t know , I do know that the Dem voters didn’t like her and she was forced out of the race. I do know she was picked primarily cause she is black. I do know Biden is running, so nothing has changed.
Thank you for your voice of reason. Most people don't know that Biden and Harris have done more harm for Black Americans than many in recent history. They are directly responsible for putting hundreds of thousands of them in prison, many for very long sentences
"Running to replace a president who has celebrated incompetence and elevated incompetents, Mr. Biden needed to choose a running mate who respects public service and has served well. In Sen. Kamala Harris, he has found such a partner.  - Washington Post Editorial Board
Incorrect.  Biden will be her puppet. Therefore, yes she can. But it’s not like it’s just her decision, but she would have major influence especially if Dems win Congress.
Unable to breathe with so much pride and hope! GOD bless Biden/Harris, and deliver us from the evil that is donald j. trump
Betsy gonna fuck over kids in 4 more years bro..like hardcore fuck over kids that’s why i gotta ride with Biden bum ass
I hate Joe Biden but my political focus is getting rid of Betsy Devos
Biden/Harris 2020!!!! The winning ticket.
I just can’t stop crying, with pride and hope, finally I feel like I can breathe a little easier...the noose has loosened!!! BUT, there is still A LOT to do. The noose has loosened, but the reigns have tightened. I’m Ridin’ with     Biden/Harris
Trump literally has nothing on Biden anymore as long as shit don’t improve lol
CNN reporter calls Biden's Harris pick 'big risk,' says American culture 'primed' to be racist and sexist    So let me get this straight- if you don’t vote for Biden then your a racist and/or a sexist...it’s so played out and old and tiring.
No Princess, but the truth hurts, dosnt it?   I suggest you go watch “Agenda”. It’s on Amazon Prime right now.  It will give you a whole new perspective on the Obama/Biden WH.
At pretty much every key political juncture in the last five years, Warren has made the wrong decision, and she has paid dearly for these mistakes. (For that reason alone, I'm glad she's not on the ticket with Biden – I've seen enough of her political skills.)   4/6
(4) ham-fistedly attacking Sanders for being a sexist; (5) breaking her own pledge not to accept Super PAC money; (6) withholding an endorsement of Sanders in the hope of earning influence and/or VP spot with Biden.  3/6

Trump 'surprised' Biden picked Kamala Harris as running mate  via
You can’t be serious a fearless fighter for the little guys I know you’re not writing this your campaign team is specially at 4 o’clock in the morning when Joe Biden is sleeping. Hell she put more people in jail and is a true leftist.
Wasn’t kamela Harris callin Biden a closet racist now they running mates the dems got this puppet runnin all different directions
This sums up Democratic voters who are “happy” about Kamala or just confident Biden can win in general   “WHAT!? He chose a literal pretzel? Oh my god! The progressiveness. The pure genius. We got this boys and girls! Trump is going down! REVOLUTION”
Biden picked a running mate That’s a gift to you.
America is extremely racist + sexist. That’s why I’m worried for this Biden campaign. 😓
Agreed...but realistically that’s what it is...give Biden a count by number puzzle to the side to look busy and keep from interrupting
Here's an inside look at the vetting process that led to Joe Biden picking Sen. Kamala Harris as his running mate.
Just remember, not voting Biden/Harris is a vote for Trump
Biden is the gift that keeps  She is a good debater, but nobody will be able to save old Joe.
Biden had no choice.  He knew his background and track record on burying black folks is documented.
Just threw $25 into the Biden/Harris ring. Felt good.
FTR : I was hoping that Biden would pick Susan Rice over Kamala Harris as his VP candidate due to Kamala's record as a prosecutor; HOWEVER, Kamala is his pick. That makes her my pick! I will rally around this sista and embrace her. LFG! #BidenHarris2020
Joe Biden selects Senator Kamala Harris to be his vice presidential running mate
“Biden’s been in office for over four decades, so what’s the point of having him on the ballot anyway?”
Kamala Harris is Joe Biden’s history-making pick for vice president
I understand Biden and Harris might not be everyone’s favorite choice but Trump has to go.
Discipline and having the right number of political vets leading the way. Biden's team actually seems like a well oiled machine all with a common goal. Compared to Bernie's campaign where the major players all had their own agendas and Bernie winning wasn't on the top of the list
Biden and Harris huh? Sigh...i guess...
In 2011  kicked me out of a conversation for asking their guest, someone running for US Congress, if they would change their stance on nuclear energy. Literally, that’s all I did. Anyways, that’s how I feel about the Biden Kamala ticket.
To see all these white dudes shitting on #KamalaHarris...you are really disrespecting women of color and EVERYONE sees it #BidenHarris2020 #BidenHarris #Biden #JoeBiden #RidinWithBiden
If not voting for Biden is a vote for Trump, then by not voting for Trump I'm actually voting for Biden. Or is it that I'm voting twice by not voting for either?
Over 160,000 Americans are dead under the watch of Trump &amp; Pence. I’ll take Biden &amp; Harris ANY DAY

When Biden picked Kamala, Trump pissed his Pence. #BidenHarris
Voting for Biden is going to hurt me to the core but it’s what we gotta do 😭💔 #JesusFixIt
President Trump wasted no time attacking Sen. Kamala Harris as Joe Biden's running mate. But in 2014, he was donating to her political campaign.
my hope is that Biden picked Harris to balance out as there are a fair number of Sander's policies being adapted
Reasons why Kamala Harris is a shit VP pick:  1. California is a safe state for the dems.This was a lost opportunity at gaining an electoral advantage in a battle ground state.  2. While the black community is not a monolith, they already showed in the primary they backed Biden.
Joe Biden and Kamala Harris on the same ticket? What’s the plan? To see how many black men that they can put in jail for non violent crimes over the course of 4 years?
I don’t care if you support Trump or Biden or whoever. Be mindful that not everything you see or read online is real.
Oh, I thought this was about Biden picking Harris...
Great News! She will be able to do very ,very well!      Go Biden &amp; Harris ,
November can’t come soon enough. Biden/Harris
And he still moves quicker than Biden and in the right direction!
honestly, i’m not sure. which is why i asked my initial question.  at the end of the day, i want niggas to vote for whoever is going to help then sleep at night. but i genuinely don’t know if i can vote for biden in good faith.
if joseph biden criticism triggers you, you should probably just hit unfollow. we don’t stan any politicians this way.
The more likely scenario is that Biden will step away from the ticket.
You think she has a cabinet position? I think Biden likes her just lacked major experience . She had a future though . Governor of GA?
Kamala Harris is Joe Biden’s pick for vice president  via  BUT she's Muslim! Sorry Felicia they need an American for that! WHAT DUMMIES!
I'm sure SNL, Colbert, Fallen, Kimmel and Myers will all be watching.  Biden/Harris!!!!! ❤
Bert .. Come on Man! You were SO easy on Amy Klobuchar, Joe Biden pushes back harder than you do “REALLY BRET”
Senator Kamala Harris is a great choice by Vice President Biden for his running mate. She is an enthusiastic and inspiring public servant who fights for justice and equality. I am ready to work so that we can see this ticket succeed in November.
Just like how Biden isn't Senator Klobuchar, Senator Harris is also not Senator Klobuchar and that little bit of positivity might not seem like much to you, but it means a lot to me. Knowing she won't have power helps when times get hard.
I know!! I keep having to stop myself from (good) crying! I feel so proud of Biden’s choice; I was hoping he would choose Harris. She’s gonna make mincemeat of Pence! Can’t wait for debates!!!
So you're thinking Biden may accidentally fall off the platform at his possible inauguration?
Biden...that’s was a mistake 😕
kid’s were in cages under obama &amp; biden, joe biden literally said if you don’t vote for him you’re not black lmao (but also idk why ‘overtly’ matters cause racism &amp; sexism are still racism &amp; sexism).
Shortly after #JoeBiden announced Sen. #KamalaHarris would be his running mate in the 2020 presidential election, Twitter lit up with reactions from President Trump, former Pres. Obama, and former Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. &gt;&gt;&gt;
Black male leaders say Biden will lose election if he doesn't choose Black woman as VP  via
Oh I infinitely prefer her to Biden, which is even in leftist circles a hot take, but when it comes to voting &amp; policy I think she's better than a lot of people who ran.
why do you believe those things? cause biden said so? his track record &amp; words don’t ever seem to match up
Joe Biden prolly think he all that and a bag of chips...serving as the VP for the first black man, and if he wins...having the first black/female VP......yeah he prolly thinks he’s all that’s and a bag of chips.
I'm not excited about Biden but I rather have a boring guy who's competent who knows what he's doing than a failed reality host where everyday there's some bullshit happening in his administration
no different than if biden is elected. like nothing has changed &amp; like there is still a lot of work that needs to be done
Joe Biden picked Kamala Harris to be his Vice President. She's a senator from California that I'm not a fan of. I also don't think she will help him win either.
Class act Biden.
This is gonna be a weird fucking election. I can easily vote for Biden &amp; Harris because we live in a system that forces us to make a shitty binary choice, but I get why people can't. That said Pence &amp; Trump actively encourage and reward police-brutality and they've got to go.
I honestly can't imagine what it must be like to be excited by a Biden/Harris ticket. That's not to say that there aren't neat aspects of such a ticket, such as representation (which is valid &amp; legitimately fucking matters), but Harris as the candidate... Yeesh, ya know?
joe biden can talk all he wants to now
am i not allowed to criticize joseph biden?
That's why we need progressives IN the Senate and the House. Because those policies are a lot harder to enact via fiat and because Progressives can watchdog the FUCK out of Harris &amp; Biden. But we need Republicans OUT. And there's only one way to do that in this fucked system.
I remember when I saw that Biden commercial that began by showing a bunch of footage of police brutality and the protests and then ended off by promising a bunch of shit that ain’t have nothing to do with any of that
You think?! I feel like it’s so ridiculous when they say “this will be Biden’s America” considering this is LITERALLY RIGHT NOW trumps America.
If Biden survives two years I would be amazed
my question is more so, why exactly? how is a biden presidency going to be any different than a trump presidency
Because Pence &amp; Trump ACTIVELY ENCOURAGE the murder of POC by cops. Harris &amp; Biden don't. They just don't. There is a culture in place, politically, that encourages police violence. To BEGIN to dismantle it we kick out Republicans.
So i will say this Kamala got 4 years to win niggas over cause Biden passing the sword to Mayor Pete
So apparently Biden picked Kamala as his VP  #Trump2020
That's actually very touching given Biden's own Job-like personal history.
Sen. Kamala D. Harris named as Joe Biden’s running mate    I predicted this!!
Looks like Kamala Harris as Biden’s VP pick is far more important and interesting news than whatever  could possibly lie about today.  #TrumpPreempted
What sold my family on Kamala Harris?  Her proposal to enact one of the largest middle class tax cuts in history.  I hope Biden adopts this platform
why do y’all want biden to win? honestly, what do y’all think a biden presidency is going to change?
true, but their breed never goes away. by then they'll likely learn how to dress up their racism and bad policies (while likely becoming somewhat more progressive themselves). mind you, I would not complain about Biden, Harris x2, AOC. somewhere in there M4A should be a reality.
Biden/Harris 2020! So excited for this!
Sooo... how do y’all feel about Biden’s running mate?
By voting for Biden &amp; Harris I am in fact voting against change. I know that sucks, but Trump HAS changed shit by making everything WORSE and I am voting against that. If you poison &amp; break things you change them &amp; after 4 years of that shit I'm very decidedly against it.
Lmaoo the one time I manifest some shit it’s Kamala Harris being Joe Biden’s VP off a dumbass joke
We won’t be watching this but will watch Biden’s VP!!
biden and harris... thats a no for me
I think Biden looked for the one that aligned with his beliefs
If you ever feel bad about the state of the Biden/Harris ticket just go onto right-wing Twitter and pretend that their "attacks" on the ticket were actually true. I wish we had a ticket that was 1/10th as rad as right-wingers pretend it was.
Take over when Biden's dementia advances further.
Of course! You're absolutely right, Phil! I'll be supporting the Biden-Harris ticket but I do wish it were different.
Biden plays it safe
Look I HATE Biden far more than almost any of my friends do. It's the sort of hate that's hard to articulate. But if Trump wins, not only does nothing change, but he can keep attacking abortion, LGBTQ+ rights, &amp; education. Biden is inarguably less bad than Trump.
Round 2 for  (alongside Iron Biden?)
But way worse since Biden and Harris have literally all the same problems Clinton had but times ten
Why not?  Trump and Biden are working for the same people.  No one is more qualified.  It is time.  It doesn't matter who wins.  Populism is on the rise, which will include voters from both parties.
There were probably a dozen better people for Biden to pick tbh.
Stfuuuuu. Is that all you can say?  Biden chose a good woman. These two will make a strong pair.  Stop trying to bring racism and lies into something that will definitely better this upside down country. #BidenHarris2020 #Biden2020
This will be Trump's first time in front of reporters since Biden picked Kamala Harris as his running mate and the Big Ten and Pac-12 postponed fall football.
Although you were my CLEAR FAVORITE, I am excited for Kamala. I know Biden is smart enough to have you in a huge leadership position in his cabinet.
Trump been putting in OT man I’m shook he may get a second term. Every YouTube video I’ve watched for 2 weeks got double ads of that Biden one
I'm not a political strategist, but I hope #Biden campaign puts #Kamala in Georgia ALL👏THE👏TIME👏

I just wanna say Joe Biden picking this woman is extremely tone deaf to police brutality and #BLM considering her track record. But...... i fucking digress. He really is bout to risk it all lmao
Also, there are legitimately worse choices Biden could have picked. Peeps like Buttigieg &amp; Bloomberg would have definitely been worse than Senator Harris. I'm as unhappy about it as I thought I'd be about it, but this was a long &amp; drawn-out primary with lots of bad candidates.
Kamala Harris "considers herself a Black Baptist" and more about her religious upbringing and perspective.

I don't like Kamala Harris. She was literally the only woman I was hoping Biden didn't pick. That being said, she is giant improvement from the wet noodle VP we have now.
So was Harris my first choice, no. Is she awesome and amazing and will she make a great VP, absolutely! Whomever you wanted as the Dems P or VP candidate, doesn’t matter. The past is the past. Now we buckle down and support the Biden/Harris ticket all the way!
I don't particularly like Senator Harris, but there are definitely worse choices than her. Like Biden. And I'm sure some of us were afraid Biden would tap Biden for VP so I mean this is definitely not the worst outcome possible.

Joe Biden picks Kamala Harris as his running mate - CNNPolitics
Biden / Harris 2020  Let’s do this 😎
You’re very welcome miss Marisol!  🥰
You’re welcome 🤗
Lmao Joe Biden finna pick Kamala Harris
Current chances Biden names his "Losing Mate" today 100% Chance its a woman 100% Chance she will be Black 100% Possibility he will lose 100% Moral is: "He who takes Black voters for granted gets hiss Ass served to him on a platter"
If the biggest story media is slobbering over is who will be Biden's losing mate, we are in serious trouble. Who gives a s...!
Joe Biden has pledged to select a woman and has conducted an expansive search, including Sens. Kamala Harris of California and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts.
The thing that CNN correspondents are not mentioning is that Biden would be a one term President and because of that his running mate could be the first black female President elected in 2024.
A vote for Biden is a sign of stupidity.
I saw 1 yards with 4 Biden signs, and it looked like a really dumb house.
Joe Biden finally bout to make the announcement we've all waited for.
I want to let y’all know if #Biden picks Kamala Harris #Howard and all #HBCU graduates are going to show OWT!   Y’all think HBCU graduates annoying now let Kamala get in there ! ✍🏾
Finally president joe Biden makes the announcement we've all waited for.
You all know deep in your hearts that neither Biden nor Trump could handle the grind of an SEC schedule.
Why does media think anyone even cares who Joe Biden picks as "The second loser" for his failing mate?
Uh, oh... Trump, referring to Biden's decision to consider only female candidates: “Some people would say that men are insulted by that. And some people would say it's fine. I don't know." He added that the VP pick ultimately won't matter because "people don't vote for the VP.”
The majority of the people who are voting for Joe Biden are not voting for Joe Biden. They are voting against President Trump. They are suffering from TDS.
The Democratic National Convention also will feature many of Biden's 2020 primary rivals, congressional leaders close to Biden and even everyday Americans.
If God existed, SHE WOULD’VE FRIED trumps ASS During This Bull💩 RANT.  Trump claims Joe Biden will 'hurt God' if elected president  via
People die every day, it’s part of life. Your party is the one destroying America but your TDS won’t let you see it. A vote for Biden is a vote for higher taxes, less jobs and no future.
Trump hasn’t mentioned the Zombie Apocalypse in his scare tactic ads. Boogie man coming disguised as Biden
That is what should happen, yes, but I promise you, you magnificent idiot that it's not what Biden wants.
Joe Biden pressed again to name a Black woman as his running mate
Well that’s a lie, person who tweeted this that isn’t Joe Biden😂

It hasn't been too rough here since we got here but OKC heat is brutal
Darn it, one less Biden voter.
Trump's strategy for the remaining part of this election is clear: Shut down the USPS and keep upping the fear game. But he's going to have to at least figure out a way to get independents nervous about a Biden/Harris ticket and right now... I don't see it.  #election2020
I'm on the fence for the upcoming erection. But, I think Trump will be bigger than Biden. Wait, what do you mean, it's spelled "election?" My bad.
Do you really want Joe Biden as President? 🤔 I don't think so.
i mean the dnc sucks at running ads. i obviously don’t want any of them to get cabinet positions but they’re 10000000x better than any democratic strategist working for the election of biden so
Is Trump trying to screw up the country so bad that he can hand it off to Biden and blame him?   Probably
That's EXACTLY what I have been saying but to Biden supporters. A mailed in election has so many potential pitfalls for BOTH sides of the aisle. I mean 20% of NY primary ballots didn't count &amp; in Cincinnati an experiment by a news station found 3% of ballots never reached voters
Thanks for clearing that up &amp; having the courage 2 post the mistake. I think if we can all begin to communicate from positions of respect we will find we have more in common than we disagree on. I'll vote Trump, I'm sure you'll vote Biden but I'm also sure we've got commonality 2

2/3 rds are voting for Biden because they dont like Trump. Why is this. There could be many reasons. The press doesn't like Trump. They're part of "The Swamp" and in turn after 3-4 years of filling up CNN's air time, 2/3rds have taken the bait. Results and truth is what matters
And BTW I truly do hope that at some point people can return to treating others w/civility &amp; express opposing political views w/o trying 2 slander or demonize those we don't agree with. And just a side note I think had Dems ran Obama as Biden's VP they would have won 4 straight

Signs/enthusiasm are historically a poor indicator of who wins. If it were, the nominee would've been Sanders or Yang.  However, I only take the polls and average them. Biden is up around 5 in PA, narrowing from ~8 last month.
I unfriended one with no regrets. I’m sad about the loss of another one to QAnon. I held onto one I felt there was hope for, and she has seen the light and will be voting for Biden.

Is it perfect or enough no but it's a start. I agree that the policies of the Biden VP years that led to 3m immigrants being deported are a cause r concern &amp; Trump's own policies toward at risk immigrants is an issue. But this budget &amp; effort is a start.

I’ll be watching Biden closely and listening to see what changes now that he has a VP. I like that Biden was one of the more moderate Democrats but I struggle with Biden as a leader. He doesn’t seem all they way there to me. (Not that our current president is a leader)
Actually having political experience and not being Donald Trump. That’s enough policy for me. And I trust that he’ll fill important seats with more competent people than ol’ Donny has. We aren’t voting for Biden; we’re voting against Trump. It’s a very simple concept.
None of you all would have a problem with this if they endorsed Biden . This is still America  for now , people are free to endorse &amp; vote for who they want to.
I think Yang had an uphill battle no matter what he did. The #1 reason most people I knew wouldn't vote Yang went down to "experience". He was too much of an outsider for their tastes. A NYC mayor or Congressman run while Biden/Harris runs its course will fix that.
I think Rogan liked a few candidates overall. I still think Yang was the strongest candidate in this environment but way too many underestimate Biden's starting field position and with this pandemic it's made such a position especially strong.
I did not vote for Trump in 2016 and I will not vote for Trump in 2020. Now I may also not vote for Biden but I know for sure I’m not voting Trump.

Alan Dershowitz DEMANDS You arrest Biden-Harris they’re Worthless Public Servant!!
Nobody is pretending that Biden is to stop the bleeding guy who will do 4yrs and retire. When he retires if we voted in 2022 then we have everything we need for reparations in 2025. However trump wins, most of us die without seeing justice.
Trump news - live: Obama accuses president of bid to suppress postal vote as US suffers 'historic humiliation' in UN vote
I hear you frfr but when Trump is the opponent I don’t even gaf who steps up. He simply has to go. Biden nor Harris are “ideal” but politics aren’t either. It’s just a game of the lesser evil 😭
Satan is working through thd Socialist Democrat party.  Their beliefs and ideals most resemble what Satan is.  A vote for Biden, Harris and the Socialist ticket, is a VOTE AGAINST GOD.  PERIOD.

Lol. Chuckleheads Biden et al
We must vote for trump.  Biden and then will put our country into dark era again after Obama administration.

How can we get you to understand what is at stake. Clinton started outsourcing, Bush added on, Obama tried to seal the deal. We are fighting for our survival. Free trade was never free to us. Biden already promised a 3 trillion dollars tax increase.
You are right, the thing about this election is global vs protectionists. If Democrats and Biden win American will be on the decline and at warp speed. That is why this on is so important. The only way to support the global agenda is to decrease America

Biden can't let Trump slide for the good of the country. If Trump gets away with his treasonous corruption, what's to stop the guy. If anything, this has taught us that the president has too much power.
You can’t be so dumb to believe that Biden is the one ignoring the science. Trump literally fought wearing a friggin mask til last month.

Listen Biden wasn't my choice but he won, until we have 60 senators not much is getting done anyway. We have 2022 and 2024 to get those 60 senators we could have reparations in 5yrs if Biden wins, he's the beginning not the end.

That is everything about the whole Democrats body. They insist on judging everyone by race then act all sanctimonious about people being judged based on race. Biden just said all blacks are alike, so why did he even pick her as if we didn't know
Trump has secret police on the streets, I'll kill the roaches and take my chances with Biden.

Fun fact: Obama/Biden proposed cutting Social Security benefits to Seniors through Chained CPI and Bernie stopped them. With Democrats like that who needs Republicans?
Another “flood the zone with sh#t” strategy? Suppress mail-in (harder to corrupt), make in-person vote harder for the Blue, and narrow Biden’s polling lead, and they’re in a position for a believable e-hack of the totals. Clearly, if these knuckleheads *can* do it, they’ll try.
Tokens we have seen but this level of tokenism, never. What about his sexual assault victim Kamala said she believes? What about Biden saying blacks aren't diverse or has no independent thoughts? This case of tokenism has never been tried before
I ask this bc in addition 2 directly deporting millions of immigrants back 2 areas w/high sex trafficking  There is this effect from what Pres Obama called "his biggest mistake"   So how can 1 vote 4 that legacy
Well that story must be fake because I remember hearing Biden saw out his own mouth he was smarter than most, at the top of his law class and basically a genius. Oh my bag, he was just a great liar.
No I think voting for Biden Harris is an not the son of a hood wearing klansmen
Maybe the POTUS (it sure as hell won’t be Biden) should eradicate these animals that perpetuate this kind of violence?!?
Another argument here is that non American citizens who will die under Biden will die under Trump too. I think this one mostly comes down to an ignorance about current, ongoing American imperialism. It also suggests not voting for Biden is actually, materially, a vote for Trump.
Sure isn't, Donald Trump is quick on his feet and has real world business experience. Biden is a braindead government leach who couldn't negotiate his way out a paper bag and Harris is suck a suck up, that she actually sucks up
Reminder that Joe Biden's campaign pushed people to vote at the polls during the primary, during a pandemic.
While in the same breath claiming a moral need to vote for Biden on behalf of non citizen immigrants!
People will say you must vote for him on behalf of people more marginalized than yourself. And if you bring up the many, many people who will die, directly, due to a Biden presidency, they will discount them entirely on the basis of them not being American citizens.
I didn't mean that Biden is worse than Trump. I mean the guy in 2024 who no one can possibly imagine now.
Tokens are back in😂😂😅 Did everyone forget that Biden just said blacks don't think for themselves?
A racist, sexual assaulting con man? Are we talking about Biden or Trump, because they both qualify for that statement.

Trump’s win of the black vote in 2020 will probably be higher than 2016.  I think the 8% will increase to 11-12%.  So that means Biden’s advantage of black vote is approximately 70%.

This has to be the last election like this. Our democracy can't take much more without splitting at the seams. The FIRST order of business for the Biden Administration should be the John Lewis Voting Rights Act.
Since we know Biden isn't writing his own material is Biden or the writer guilty of plagiarism? Ultimately it rests on Joe.
Several of those points ELIMINATE both Trump and Biden.  Next.....
IF Biden wins he’ll be a puppet for the far Left and you’re just hoping and waiting for his inevitable “stepping down” to hand over the Presidency to you. Yet another unearned opportunity falling into your lap.

Hiding in a basement and playing the role of Captain Hindsight does NOT make you a leader. It makes you a coward. Biden is a failed candidate and a detriment to our government.
You found four instances in four years all I have to do is watch Biden anytime he's on TV
This is why all I hear from lib friends is to STFU &amp; vote for Biden, don’t hold his feet to the fire, yada yada yada. Policy doesn’t matter as long as everyone can “go back to normal” &amp; “not Trump.” Our country is a freakin joke.
Even More than before. The democrat ticket is really a socialist ticket. Biden has already started his socialist campaign saying he will make people wear mask at all times! This is tyranny.🇺🇸🇺🇸
You have two candidates. This will NOT change. And you better goddamned well get in that booth and vote for Biden in November.
Yang, Kasich, AOC but no Davis, Julian, or Lawrence. I’ll give him Kasich because that seems like a request Biden would make. 🧢twitter made him add Yang. And AOC barely congratulated Kamala.
Biden has proven to me he makes, if not an ally for AsAms, at least a net positive. If anything, racial relations is one positive on his end I can back him on.
If they were in Iowa, Biden/Harris would be stealing corn, if it’s Idaho they’re stealing your potatoes. They know their base believes any lie. The uneducated are always afraid of the boogey man. Trumps always been this way, Pence now just adopted it. He’s just spineless.
I agree that Trump is bad. But Biden is worse than all of those on the list except Trump. And we should reward that? I don't think so.

Trump voters wouldn't see anything wrong with this, since they've been fed that Hillary did it in 2016. Is very likely that one month into election Trump will suggest that Biden, Gates, China and Yogi the bear are trying to rig the elections.
I disagree. The reason we've arrived at Trump is because this exact thing has been said before about, Obama, Bush, Clinton, Bush, Reagan, Ford, Carter, etc. This is part of a race to the bottom. Do you really like Biden?  It won't end until there's more choices.

I’m not really saying all that to you just trying to say it out loud for anyone that tries to hit me with all the bad shit Biden &amp; Harris have done
I get it but at the same time I realistically can’t see Biden and Harris being as bad as Trump
Biden and his enfeebled brain. Science does not back up wearing masks outside when you can social distance.
Y’all can be as critical of Kamala all you want, just please vote Biden in November.
However, it was just 6 short years ago that Obama/Biden sought to cut Social Security by adding Chained CPI requirements.  Had Senator Sanders not mounted an effort to stop them our Seniors would probably be cutting their already cut pills in half again by now.
Daily reminder that Joe Biden also tried to defund Social Security several times.

The only thing I don’t like about the kamala pick is that I feel like Biden did it becasue of the climate of the nation and the color of her skin. Thinking he could win over the black vote...Just my Gut. But of course black ppl will say doesn’t matter be happy you got a black vp

Nothing wrong at all. We love this country. We are AMERICAN PATRIOTS. Joe Biden is the biggest joke to run for POTUS since Walter Mondale. When you're right, you're right. When you're left, you're wrong!
You are 1/2 wrong. Biden appeals to neither party, it’s hatred for Trump daring to stand against their vision of Totalitarianism even a monkey would be appealing. Besides Trumps evilness NYT only prints stories aiding my sleep,as they feel nothing more worthy needs to be covered.

I never said Biden was a hero of the black community. But you, my dude, are very selective with your points there. Record funding for HBCU? That's false. First Step? He just signed it into law, it wasn't even a priority. Jared Kushner and Van Jones did most of the work lol
If Pence, Biden and Trump aren't showing birth certificates then neither is Harris. In fact as long as you are questioning  about anything other than her policies then you are not to call her by her first name. She is not your friend.
Now that we all saw how Trump tried to quid pro quo fake dirt on Biden from Ukraine, it would be a November surprise if a single person believed any report from  Barr or trump.

I noticed comma,la didn't bother to mention how Obama/Biden totally blew the H1N1 which was a pandemic not an outbreak like Ebola. 60 million people got H1N1&amp; they stopped testing because the numbers were so high. Over 16,000 people died. They only tell half truths that help them
Lotta black ppl think this concept is so far fetched, but Latinos have BEEN doing this. Both parties know that the Latino vote could go either way so they actually attempt to EARN their vote EVERY election. But like Biden said black ppl ain’t “DIVERSE” in their way of thinking.
If black people withheld their votes this election instead of just giving it to Biden, we would essentially be free agents in 2024. Do y’all understand how much leverage we would have politically, both sides of the aisle would do everything they could to try an earn our vote.
No, it’s Harris and ? Because Biden will be thrown out before the election
I can't with Biden. Trump's a narcissistic jerk, but he's cognitively intact, and I don't think he hates America. That's how low the bar is.

What sexist or racist comments are you talking about? The comments about her believing Biden’s accusers? The comments about here calling out Biden’s racism? I call into question her character if she believes Biden is a racist and rapist and still accepts VP Nomination

Hey, Democrats. I have heard the new Biden ads, in which he says that everyone has a right to be treated with dignity. Considering what he and Harris plan for preborn children, someone should explain to him what dignity means.
Biden and Harris receive favorability bounces, says a new Politico/Morning Consult poll.  Biden Favorable: 51% (+4 since Aug 10) Unfavorable: 44% (-4)  Harris Favorable: 45% (+12 since late July) Unfavorable: 37% (+3)
Standard politics that is part of any primary—Clinton &amp; Obama got pretty nasty with each other in 2008 and yet they worked well together for four years. Part of what made Biden look bad in Dem debates was his relutance to really go on the attack like that.
What is most likely to happen on Election Day or maybe Election week at this rate.  Trump will have huge leads of 10+ points in all the swing states and even be leading or close in solid blue states.  Then as the night goes on and week goes on Biden will slowly come back.
Several reasons: 1. Trump is a fascist destroying our norms and seeking to rig the election in his favor by hobbling the USPS 2. Biden-Harris are two of the most compassionate people in politics 3. They are running on a great platform designed to help working folks succeed

If you want to decide who to vote for, watch what Biden/Harris say about this protest. If they do not denounce and scream from the podium how wrong this protest is, then you know they have no business in the White House and do not deserve one vote from the American people
C’mon, now! Really? You had no intentions on voting for a Biden/Harris ticket. Don’t blame us. Be real. As a matter of fact, at this point, since apparently your mind is made up, you might as well consider yourself a Trumper. And, THAT’S disappointing.✌🏾&amp;💛
I’m sure a small percentage of Bernie supporters being insensitive after the SC primary outweighs the racism of Joe Biden’s support for school segregation in the 70s, welfare cuts and mass incarceration in the 90s, and murdering a million Arabs in Iraq in the 00s.
Kamala went toe to toe with Joe, confronted him, stood her ground, and asked the tough questions. Biden didn’t take it as an insult or disrespect. Biden saw her for the strong woman she is and he picked her for that quality. It takes a real man to do that. #TrumpIsLosing
Joe Biden is such a prolific LIAR! President Trump never called racists at Charlottesville,  "Fine People"! Biden is proving once and forever the Satanic Socialist Democrats will do &amp; say anything for political power! He and Kamel Harris are the most dangerous people  in America!

I'm not being racist. What I said is truth. Biden said he would choose his VP based on gender and race. He didn't say he chose Kamala for her policy. They don't even agree on policy. Why? To get the black vote. They count on your vote because it's the only way to win.
Joe Biden is such a prolific LIAR! President Trump never called racists at Charlottesville,  "Fine People"! Biden is proving once and forever the Satanic Socialist Democrats will do &amp; say anything for political power! He and Kamel Harris are the most dangerous people  in America!
I can't think of a single good reason to vote for Trump.  But if the best reason you can find to vote for Biden is his VP pick, then you shouldn't be voting for him either.  This election more than any other I've seen yet would be a great opportunity to give rise to a 3rd party.

Tax cut isn't touching social security. Do remember how hard it was to get a good job under Obama? More taxes and regulations mean fewer good paying jobs. Plus Biden isn't going to protect people. He supports defunding the police and getting rid of the 2nd amendment.
Y’all want a debate hack that will win Biden the presidency. He just needs ONE line where he looks at Trump and says “Mr. President, it’s because you’re a fucking asshole” on live television.
I sent Joe Biden a Tweet asking what he sees as the advantages to maintaining a For-Profit Insurance Middleman between a Patient and their Doctor in a system that excludes millions, over M4A that covers...ALL.  Can you believe he never even responded?
ok so like  how are Trump supporters so disgusted by Biden’s inappropriate behavior towards women  but can easily overlook anything Trump has said or done that has been inappropriate during his presidency &amp; in his past, towards women (and our country in general)???  LMK
do you two think Kamala being on the ticket is enough to push Biden to win? Or is the world's tallest oompa loompa going to stay in power? #askanidiot
Really it comes down to money. I will have more money if Trumps President. Democrats will take my money if they get into the White House. Biden already said he was going to raise taxes.
Here's your savior of single payer:
This is true... Many folks feared Kamala on the top of the ticket to be attacked by racist Trump. Joe that felt was a safer bet to lead as we have seen they were right Trump is struggling to hurt Biden, they did not want Kamala to take that direct fire. But want her on the ticket
Biden reads?
This is so wrong.  Nobody buys this crap anymore.  The Democrats are as corrupt as the GOP half of the duopoly.  Biden "I will veto M4A if it comes across my desk" is no progressive.  But you already know that, and this is just mindfukery from the duopoly.
Don't move on without checking with legal because it could be retaliation for covid which you can sue if Biden wins
The most recent respected, national live-caller poll (Monmouth) found Biden leading among women 61-32%. So keep it up, Donald.
A really telling moment from the primary is that a lot of Joe Biden voters thought he supported M4A
When asked how Biden will lead the military differently than President Trump, SGM Baker said “He’ll support the military chain of command and not lead by a chain of tweets.”
The argument that maybe Biden will beat trump as the worst president in history is something else.
He is absolutely the greatest conman to ever live. I recently had a Trump supporter tell me that if I voted for Biden we would have to worry about Sharia law becoming more common in this country. SHARIA LAW in a country 70%+ Christian 🙄🙄🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤣🤣
And you have no evidence that Trump is a racist. But yet look throughout Biden's history many many many questionable comments. And Trump was a Democrat star until he decided to run for the Republican party in 2016
If I could get a penny for every lie that Harris and Biden will say during this campaign I would be a billionaire. Super thin 48 hours I've already got a thousand bucks. Of course she doesn't feel Biden is a racist her parents owned slaves. #Trump2020
If Bernie has picked her and primed her like Biden did - I would still see an old privileged white man tokenizing a woman of color to the benefit of is white station. My tweet is a response to how Biden showcased Kamala. Look, think before you write to me!

So segregation isn't racism? He said, "blacks are not as diverse as Hispanic people". Who are you trying to convince me or yourself, Biden isn't racist.
You know how crackers handle injustice? We don't vote for race, we vote for policy. Just like blacks will vote for Biden/Harris but they helped mass incarcerate blacks. Instead of being used by politicians, why not try something different.
You know, your biggest problem is that it always has to be about you. “I did this, I did that.” I’m not sold on Biden, but at least he picked someone who calls out his weakness to make him stronger. All you want are ‘yes (wo)men’. You fire someone the second they disagree w/ you.
I'm a Biden/Harris Republican.
I know our friends on the right always try to dismiss these polls unless they’re winning of course. I think 🤔 the thing that’s alarming to me is Biden has 2 point lead in Georgia and a virtual dead heat in Texas....Folks Democrats don’t usually win those state lets be for real.

This woman is beyond nuts......it’s time for you to retire, get some help, and enjoy your life   Why would you suggest that something is going to happen to Joe Biden. Was that a threat?
In the last of four proposals, Biden's "build back better" earmarks $775 billion to the "caring economy" over the next decade.   His plan also includes enhancing infrastructure and tackling climate change.
Maybe the first thing Biden should do if elected is tell everyone that comes forward, that any NDA signed with trump is void, presidential pardons all around. I wonder how many thousands would speak. Also I wish the extra debate Trump wanted could be against Harris.
University of Pennsylvania's  researchers estimate [Biden’s tax plan] would raise between $2.3 - $2.6 trillion. That’s $600 billion less than what Biden wanted.  The study also estimates it would decrease economic growth by 0.1 percent by 2030.
This is not a wash. Biden/Harris will not end healthcare. They will not ruin medicaid/ social security. They will not gut the post office. There will be better plans for saving the environment. A national response to coronavirus.   I think there are issues with the ticket.
The Secret Service needs to make sure she doesn't attend any Joe Biden events for the next four to eight years.

Of course that is if Biden is the candidate. If not.... some of this begins to make some sort of sense.
Yeah, I agree that of Biden's final 3-4 choices, Kamala Harris was the best to have to debate against Mike Pence.  The big question though is she can probably outdebate Pence, but you have to coexist with her for 4 years. Can he after what happened in the first primary debate?
Y’all can miss me with all this nitpicking about #KamalaHarrisVP. We have a job to do, remember? Biden/Harris 2020!!
That’s correct. Independents like me &amp; my NC friends voted for Bernie bc M4All, but Biden won’t support it. He’s just another Wall St. puppet. And yes we don’t reside in the center (Libertarians, Green leaning).

I guess that takes her out of Biden's list of VP candidates! Can't have a depressed VP along with an early dementia President.
Yes why not now? We sure as hell won't get it with Biden.

And i cant stress this enough there is other people running besides biden, trump, and kanya we dont actually have a 2 party system there is people running that are better then this 3 we dont have to choose our destroyer
Biden Faces A Convention Test, To Offer A Vision Beyond Beating Trump
Which one is Trump and which one is Biden?
"Mr. Biden is promising to delete the jobs of millions of Americans—at a time of soaring unemployment." Good column by  one of the best.
All Dems know Biden has a lot of dirty stuff in his closet. This is so scary.
The only reason Democrats like Biden get away with shit that didn't happen is because it didn't happen. The only way 'tards like Dan Bongino get away with making shit up is because their fan base eats up bullshit.
Beyond their usual ineptitude and the fact that the workers union just endorsed Biden, and they shouldn't be walloped with a hasty plan at mass-mailed ballots.
A major union representing U.S. postal workers has endorsed Biden for president, a move that comes as Trump has acknowledged starving the postal service of money in order to make it more difficult to vote by mail in November's election.
Joe Biden is a racist
Before Joe Biden named Sen. Kamala Harris his running mate, women’s groups were readying a campaign of their own: shutting down sexist coverage and disinformation.   I want a woman of color for VP, not The White Party's lies from now until Nov 2. #Vote2020
I'M not at ALL worried over polls. others (apparently) are... getting very confident. much like what we all saw leading up to 2016.  if you think biden is going to LEAD that "train"... you are too far removed.  the far-left has a "PUPPET".  and that's IF he doesn't get replaced.
The President told hundreds of New York Police Department officers that “no one will be safe in Biden’s America" if the former Democratic vice president defeats him in November.
Biden-Harris ticket is a joke. Most are going to be shocked when it all unfolds. Biden cant be president if he's in GITMO.

I don't have a problem with you saying Biden lies. That's part of the political game.   My point is that if you can't/don't say the same about Trump, your argument is lost on me.  Here's a simple one. Trump just said he didn't meet with DeJoy. The  confirmed he did.
Greta has done a great job of making her supporters believe she doesn't take sides. They've been misled. She's clearly firmly planted in conservative ideology.  If Biden/Dems do something, she calls them out.  If Trump does something, she tweets about dogs.
You're a partisan Trump supporter.  Since one should do what the other does, Biden released his taxes, so Trump should, too.  Somehow, I think (to you) this is different.

Dude Reggie! Biden is an exceptional racist lots of game tape on this one. And that’s not an all Presidents comment. You can find lots of reasons to not vote for Trump but to say one is because Biden is not racist means your not paying attention
Joe Louis' trainer, "Chappie" Blackburn, once told the up and coming Brown Bomber "When you get into the ring, let your fists be the referee," meaning don't let it be close, because white people will rig the rules. The same applies to Biden/Harris now. If it's close, they lost.

That is such total utter BS. Biden is probably the most devote church goer in politics. He has never tried to take guns or support any such legislation, limit them yes,put restrictions yes but never to take away. He supports the police.

5 Takeaways On The New Biden-Harris Presidential Ticket
I will vote for Biden/Harris, but I can't support the ticket with my time or money. Harris has a terrible record, she's an unprincipled opportunist who doesn't care about the needs of the poor.
Ast night you said what if Biden is faking his dementia.  He is.  This way when he gets accused for Ukraine and indicted, he "wont be mentally fit to stand trial" and he cant throw people under the bus.
Although I have issues with the ticket itself I will absolutely still vote for Biden and Harris. But if you know anything about her being AG for California she put a lot of black and brown people in prison and the effects it had on the black family was devastating.

Biden's VP pick: Why Kamala Harris embraces her biracial roots
She’s a great pick.   My issue was with how the Biden campaign seemed to have narrowed the search to only black women, and did it to try and raise them up like they needed any help.   It’s become clear however, that women were the only viable options to be the next VP.
She is. She would’ve been my pick too.   My point was that it seemed the Biden Team narrowed the search to a black female only.   It has been brought to my attention that there were no viable candidates that didn’t fit that description.
At least he did something Biden proved he wouldn't have dont that with his false accusations. Now you act like he has a magic wand when he just said he'd keep Fauci and more of the same that Trump is doing.
I don’t think that. I think she is the best choice, and gives him the best chance to win (I’d like to hear who you would’ve picked). I am happy to see that a women of color was picked. But I thought it was clear that the Biden campaign was only picking a VP that was a female.

🤣🤣🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂You just did the same thing before that calling it lame and telling me to come back to 2020.    Trumps did more for this country in 3 1/2 years then Biden did in 50.  You think that's a deflect.  Neither of them are perfect but ones actually done something.
Don’t you think it’s pathetic the Biden Team chose to select a VP based on the candidate’s race and gender, not by character or qualifications? If Kamala truly is the best choice, then choose her. Instead they chose to come out and say “We’re only choosing a black female for VP”.
Maya Rudolph reacts to Kamala Harris as Biden's VP pick, her SNL return 🙌🙌🙌🤣🤣🤣 Let’s play ⁦
Kamala Harris is Joe Biden’s pick for vice president  via  BUT she's Muslim! Sorry Felicia they need an American for that! WHAT DUMMIES!
I'm sure SNL, Colbert, Fallen, Kimmel and Myers will all be watching.  Biden/Harris!!!!! ❤
Bert .. Come on Man! You were SO easy on Amy Klobuchar, Joe Biden pushes back harder than you do “REALLY BRET”
I'm quite america  but thanks for your concern.  She will have to because Biden doesnt stand a chance. Funny how now you guys want debate lololol.
Yeah okay
Beat day I’ve had in 4 years!       Joe Biden selects Senator Kamala Harris to be his vice presidential running mate
Good pick
Idk why when I see “Joe Biden” my brain switches it to “Joe Budden” 🤣🤣
Bruh I’m tired of explaining to my folks her and Biden ain’t it
At least Biden and Harris don't find it appropriate to vacation at the place Hitler "shared good times and laughs with his compatriots."  I live in NC. If your name shows up on my ballot, it's a definite NO!
What I don’t understand is if black people where that excited about her. We had the opportunity to vote her in at the top of the ticket. The reason why Biden is at the top of the ticket is Soley because of black people.
Just as afraid as black men and women were when she sentenced them to unfair sentences. Let me hold my nose and vote for Biden and Harris. But don’t act like we have overcome. When we still fighting the cops. And we just picked a cop for VP.
either vote for Biden or deal with trump for 4 more years. now stfu.
Trump trying to deflect from Kamala Harris.😂 After the world finish watching &amp; laughing at this impeached fool news conference, we will continue to celebrate the news of a Joe Biden VP pick Kamala Harris 🙏🏾✊🏾👍🏾  Trump is an idiot 🤡 for real🤣🤣  #PresidentClorox45💉 #VoteBlue✊🏾
Looks like Kamala Harris as Biden’s VP pick is far more important and interesting news than whatever  could possibly lie about today.  #TrumpPreempted
Yessss soon to be President Biden! #BidenHarris2020
Y’all realize police need reforming because of people like Joe Biden and Kamala Harris... what do Democrats even stand for dawg... I’m so lost
Can we stop with the cold take that Biden needed Kamala to get the Black vote?!?! I stg yall sound dumb as hell
Hey Donnie are you going to fire Mike Pence now that Joe Biden picked Kamala Harris so you can try to get more black votes? 😂  Melania saying you're going to replace him with a black female, either Candace Owens or Kanye West! TRUE or UNTRUE?🤔😂  #BidenHarris2020 #VoteBlue2020
Joe Biden don't want vote no more clearly
My religion believes in truth so where is your proof of that and I will condemn him just as I would anyone. Without proof you're just bearing false testimony.  Also have you seen all the photos of Biden groping children in public at their clear dismay? What say you?
Man we got Joe “where am I” Biden and Kamala “lock em up” Harris ffs we couldn’t do any better????
So if we not supposed to vote for trump, or Biden, we can’t NOT vote. So who am i voting for 😒
This nigga Joe Biden 🤦🏾‍♂️
This Biden Kamala shit is ghetto and we finna get locked tf up
Trump, Biden and kamala Harris man we are fucked regardless
Interesting choice by Biden. Kamala Harris seems to be an elitist. "The California Democrat and her spouse, lawyer Douglas Emhoff, reported about $1.9 million in adjusted gross income for last year, according to tax returns released earlier this year."
Biden was a slimy oft pres candidate when Obamessiah picked him. Slumping for go pick is their thing apparently.
I’m convinced Joe Biden don’t even wanna be president for real
Not really as much here as the headline promises: Biden's VP running mate is Sen. Kamala Harris
Man here. Couldn't be happier.  BIDEN / HARRIS !!!!!!!!

Hey y'all, did you hear Biden picked Harris?
That's because Biden would be wrapped up like a douche in the middle of the night with depends on sniffing his wife's hair as he dreams of the presidency by 9 o'clock.

Joe Biden selects his running mate with announcement coming as early as Tuesday
When  told Hugh that if Biden wins, we'll have to learn Chinese, Hugh should have challenged him. He didn't.
Biden has selected a Running Mate! #BidenVP
It's looking more like it. Why do you think Biden would pick her over Kamala Harris?
so that's why the only black president in American history chose Joe Biden - give me a break!!
Trump said if Biden wins the Election we will have to learn Chinese.  But if he wins I know we will have to learn Russian and lose our democracy.
Getting mad that Eric Trump used a clip of Robin Williams making fun of Joe Biden? No editing just a clip of a man expressing what he thought of Joe Biden. Just because it doesn’t fit your narrative doesn’t make it wrong. If Biden used a dead comedian to bash Trump you’d be fine.
Pretty sure trump knows hes running for President and not Senate. Pretty sure Trump never said that they had to reelect Biden at his own conference.  Pretty sure Trump didn't say if you aren't voting for him you aren't black and that Latinos are diverse unlike black people.
Even at Trumps worst he's 10x better than Biden you can see past the mold you've been conformed to.
Uh, oh... Trump, referring to Biden's decision to consider only female candidates: “Some people would say that men are insulted by that. And some people would say it's fine. I don't know." He added that the VP pick ultimately won't matter because "people don't vote for the VP.”
People die every day, it’s part of life. Your party is the one destroying America but your TDS won’t let you see it. A vote for Biden is a vote for higher taxes, less jobs and no future.

Long week already. Every damn day feels that way to me. I’m ready for the election &amp; to be rid of this toxic POTUS &amp; Senate. I fear everyday until then is going to be exhausting! Of course, there are the 1st three months after Biden wins that we will have to contend with! Jeesh!
I've been shouting this since befor Biden got the nomination, it would be awesome if Barack Obama was our VP.... Theres nothing saying it cant happen! Im ready for Nov. Though i hate to see the death toll then....
no. so much shit will come out if he loses to biden his brand will be beyond toxic. running for pres was his worst idea ever as far as his family name goes....

Yuck... that put a bad taste in my mouth. You know for3 weeks she kept talking  how as VP she was going run the Senate.   I did say that I would vote for Biden even if he picked Tulsi Gabbard.
So your saying he hasn't changed his course of "action" from doing absolutely nothing for the many years hes been a politician, yet somehow if hes elected president he will magically transform? Lying Biden sold you a huge one.
I went on a two week road trip from NC to Washington July 19-August 1. Visited 19 states stayed in Washington 4 days.  Did not see ANY Biden bumper stickers, flags, billboards, or any other Biden campaign advertising the entire trip.  Polls are fake and so is Biden's support.
I thought she was riding with Biden 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Look, if you care who  is picking for VP enough to be tracking flights, you need to be prepared for it not to be your favorite and to support the ticket anyway. I am Team Biden/whoeverhepicks
Guess she's taking her heels with her.  No more riding Biden!
It matters to me because as much as I like Biden I am preparing for what the future holds. And #TheFutureisFemale
He's got his hands on both of her bare arms.  No more "handsy" talk about Biden.
why in the hell are you giving Donald Trump free broadcast time to run a campaign rally (aka press briefong)for free on your network??!!! When exactly are you going to give Joe Biden equal time?
#politics Links to  BIDEN vs. TRUMP #Biden #Trump #Democrats #Republicans
The presumption you make is that Biden or any other democrat would have a magic wand to fight it of is hilariously wrong and blatantly stupid.
A ‘radical’ leftist who is ‘against God’? Trump paints Biden in a picture many don’t recognize.
Then blame the source of the China virus! People should not die of the flu either or car accidents but what are you going to do? You think Biden would have done better when he blamed Trump of being racist when he implemented travel bans?
In case you didn't know,  said he would accuse Obama of meddling in the election if he released information about Russia meddling.

for someone who CLAIMS to be a "conservative".... you have a real funny way of proving it.  can you name ONE thing that biden truly supports that a ACTUAL conservative would ALSO support?  ... or did your "anti-trump" condition cloud your objectivity?
But Biden understands the importance of having Dept heads handle their issues. He will delegate a lot, just as Obama did.
I’m voting for Biden but I would like to see a someone that has a history of moving our community forward
What’s the best part of having a Republican President.... It gives the Democrats something to do when the Republican is voted out.  With as much as Rump has fu*$ed up it will take Biden 8 years to get it straightened out.
The Democrats main focus is pushing. this Country into A SOCIALIST COUNTRY so They can Control each and every move we make from our  second Ammendment Rights and freedom of Religion:  It WILL not HAPPEN unless you elect Biden and Allow pelosi to continue with her agenda!

In an interview, Cooper described his efforts to ensure the Republican National Convention was held safely and explained why he supports former Vice President Joe Biden.
Biden doesn’t even have to campaign. Trump can’t stop talking and lying. Roll the tapes!
As opposed to being beholden to far right influences.  I don't understand how the person you described thinks Trump would be better than Biden with regards to, oh, let's say, Russia.
Translation: “If Biden goes on stage with Trump we will lose our ass! Not a chance. We can’t take the risk.  Plus: I wonder if the people will remember that he promised a VP candidate announcement last week. OMG! He didn’t???” Oops.
Let's get it straight Joe Biden quit your lying! Michael Brown in Ferguson is dead because he committed a crime and then he reached into a policeman scar to try to wrestle his gun away that's why his fingerprints were in the car that's why he had gunpowder residue on his hands!..

Doesn't the law matter, anymore? Or is it just an inconvenience? Biden's people should have settled this months ago.
That is the problem...Biden will take a follow up question and try and answer it truthfully...the more you exposure you have the more chance of a misstep... where Trump won't allow a follow up or just lies and everyone goes on to the next question like nothing happened...
See buffoon, that’s why you were such a horrible President. A “fair election” is not defined by the result being the Election of Biden. Or Trump for that matter. It’s about it being legit and the winner being who the EC picks under a legit election.
That’s why MAGA are made in China and Biden hats made is USA. You Marci have started to eat the bs you feed the nation. Bogey man arguments persuade idiots but fortunately most Americans see right through them and those who offer them.
FAUCI said early January that masks weren't necessary. Trump listened to him.  FAUCI now said masks are absolutely necessary because he's aligning with Biden &amp; Harris.  FAUCI is a fraud. Dr. Judy Mikovits should be his boss &amp; the one firing him!!!!
He’s right about the masks. And it’s really starting to piss people off. Between orders to wear them during a zoom meeting, to Biden’s absurd suggestion to wear them all the time, it’s bullshit. They don’t even work..... it’s like swatting fruit flies with a chain link fence.

It’s hilarious that these people think Biden has any clue how to fast track an economic recovery. The first thing he will do is give away Nancy’s 3 Trillion dollars, then raise taxes by 4 Trillion while a ton of ppl are out of work. He’ll spend the SS money in his first month.
None of them. It’s all about JoJo!! #JoJorgensen2020 !!!! Voting for Biden or Trump is a vote for old racist sex offending pedophiles!!
I'm watching VP Biden speak abt the virus. What a breath of fresh air! He makes sense, I CAN trust what he says &amp; he's not degrading his apponents by calling them names &amp; acting like a bully. He's acting like an adult &amp; leader. It's like someone we've known has finally come home.
That's great and all but please don't give the Biden administration a pass like you did for the Obama administration. If Trump taught us nothing else it's that when you ignore abuses from your side, they will be doubled down on by the other side.

LISTEN. Biden should’ve picked Bernie as his running mate. But I see what they did. Having an African American woman on the ticket is MONUMENTAL, so I’m not taking anything from her. Trump is going to spend the next 80 days focusing on defining a woman.. &amp; what she should be.

good interview with Jack Lew this morning.  If Biden wins you think he brings him back to Treasury to tackle this mess? Or consider keeping Mnuchin and allowing him to negotiate without the limitations he clearly has now.
It means Biden is a stooge who they put up because they see him as “electable”. Then, they slip an in unelected socialist (Heels up) to fast track the socialist agenda that Trump halted. I feel like the voters will see through this obvious trickery and do the right thing though.

This is what boils my piss, people saying "but Biden is x, Kamala is y, and I voted for z"  Don't care.  There's an actual monster in charge now and do you really want an 4 more years of absolute misery??? Is the moral high ground worth all the COVID dead and kids in cages???
Good deal- there’s one educated voter that won’t be voting Biden 🤣
If you're looking to justify voting for Trump, look elsewhere. You know good and well Biden is the only viable alternative.
That’s a pretty gross way to describe a supporter. Are you in the Colon of Biden or any of the other corrupt scum you support?
Just ordered 2 Biden/Harris yard signs. One for the front and one for the back since our yard is up against the greenway.
They will spend the next 5 mo trashing everything they can just to make it that much harder for Biden to make actual progress.
#GOP Trying to find bad things to say about Biden and a Harris is hilarious!  Your DEFENDING TRUMP!  PRES CLUELESS! We Win!   165000 DEAD!  Solution ‘IT WILL MAGICALLY GO AWAY’
Number 35.
And still Biden is 10 points ahead. AMAZING
Biden must be pulling horribly behind Trump which is why The left is on this full court press about voter fraud all of the sudden.
If most people had suspected Biden was going to pick Harris for weeks, why is it taking the Rs so much time to come up with a strategy to attack her? Ahhhh, that’s right, we stole  , their best marketing team. 😂
“Good job siphoning those votes away from Biden!” - Jared
I just wish Biden didn't look so fragile and senile sometimes.
As an independent I try to get diff. viewpoints. And usually I found u credible. But your article on Harris is nonsensical. No matter who Biden picked R’s would label her radical..Trump had no qualifications to be Pres. &amp; has proven to be a lying incompetent buffoon
I mean check out the opening paragraph from today's Washington Post story...
While some of y'all are bashing Biden and/or Harris, I just have one question:  What outcome are you trying to bring about? Like, what goal is putting the Dem ticket on blast going to achieve for you?  Because the effect it WILL have is to persuade some people not to vote at all.
Obama said Biden really nailed the pick
I was thinking the same: Biden has a trusted, dedicated staff. No leaking implies they are a team working toward the same goal. A novel concept after 3.5 years of chaos.
She's definitely blowing some energy into the Biden campaign
I am a Soror of Delta Sigma Theta Sorority, Inc, and I am honored to support my Howard U fellow alumni, Kamala Harris as part of the Biden/Harris ticket !  #DeltasForKamala #TheDivine9
No it ain’t.  1.) Y’all not black so y’all don’t have anything to say about a black card. 2.) Her record is trash but look who she’s up against. Pence believes in shocking gay people until they turn straight. Biden could run with Jeffrey Dahmer and he still getting all the votes
They really aren’t they? I mean Biden could have chosen Adam Smith as his running mate
I live in the suburbs but I’m a divorced single mom with a career and I’m all in for Biden Harris 2020
Oh don't mind me, I'm just making a list of people to drag to hell and back come November 4th when our current incumbent monster in chief gets another 4 years to destroy this country further because people seem to think Biden/Harris would somehow be worse...
Joe Biden chose PHONY KAMALA HARRIS AS VP  via
Biden must win
I see Green2020. Who do you think is more Environment Friendly, Trump/Pence or Biden/Harris?
At the end of the day, if she wanted the job, I want her to have it. And hopefully it will be helpful for whatever she strives for in the future. Hopefully Biden is still around to advocate for whatever that may be...
Your thoughts are always appreciated. I think she’ll bring energy. My brothers were thrilled, 1 is in Utah, the other NM. We have very different politics. I think Biden trusts her judgment, &amp; since we have no idea what’s up w/him, she may have a large behind the scenes role?
What’s the bet Biden mistakes a different black woman for Kamala
That’s a Joe Biden quote.... come on man
Now Biden will have a legitimate stranglehold on SF...without Harris he never would have had that...this is the equivalent of JFK picking LBJ
What is the game here?  Why do they want Trump to win re-election? They never thought Biden was up to the job, and the VP pick only makes the loss more likely.  #WTF
Biden will step down sometime in 2022 immediately after Obama is sworn in as Supreme Court Justice.
😂 “Come on man” Joe Biden
T-rump just killed 150,000 people. Y’all gonna not vote for Biden and Harris off principle?? Because she was a prosecutor. Our current dictator was a reality star host. What is wrong with y’all?
How is #KamalaHarris going to walk back the points she made about Biden”s racist legislation and the fact she said she believed Biden accusers in her savvy debate points?  It strikes me as phony AF now!
Looking up and down my timeline... let me get into it with some of y’all...   I want it to be clear.   I am voting for Joe Biden and Kamala Harris.   I’m not debating and I’m not convincing y’all to switch.   Do you. Be respectful. And let’s not engage.
Yeah this is the only reason why I’m not feeling Biden &amp; Harris
Kamala knows about salty replies.   She gave one to Joe biden.  In the debate.
Agree she has so much to answer for. While we are at it Joe Biden I do not forget your years of racist legislation.  What is an Independent to do?
Biden will be 78 if he is inaugurated. Perhaps the VP will be VERY important.
I’m so sick of Bernie bros continuing to bash Biden and Kamala for not being progressive enough. I get that they aren’t what you wanted. But damn, they’re the best hope we have of getting rid of the LITERAL FASCIST in the White House. Get off your high horse and join the fight!
I’m so excited about this ticket. VP Biden and Senator Harris are fighters - exactly what American families need right now!
I'm excited!  Biden/Harris is a great ticket. 😊😊😊😊😊
Joe Biden announced today that Kamala Harris will be his running mate. At least it keeps her out of the Department of Justice?   via
And Joe was like my 5th pick. I was Pete, Booker, Harris, Warren, Biden, Castro, Sanders, Klobuchar, Yang, Williamson IIRC
Harris doesn’t help Biden.  Biden will be destroyed in the debates.
do you think Joe Biden will remember who he picked tomorrow? #Trump2020
I hope we will see you in the Biden Administration. Secretary of State perhaps.
If Biden were elected, and re elected by some God foresaken reason, he will be 85 at the end of his second term. I just realized that. There’s no way this is possible, so Harris is the real Presidential candidate. Biden is just more “electable” right now. Sans the dementia....
Right- same goes for Chicago, San Fran, LA, New York and Portland. These douche nozzles get elected over and over and over. I mean, how can a buffoon like Biden get re-elected so many times that he has 50 years in office???
You know I was alright with voting for Biden in November but KAMALA HARRIS FOR VP???? As if 2020 cannot get any worse
A failure in leadership.  Trump MUST GO!  Biden/Harris 2020! #TrumpEvictions #BidenHarris2020
I am so damn happy!!!! Congratulations, soon-to-be-VP Harris. And congratulations, soon-to-be-President Biden. #BidenHarris #VoteBlueToEndThisNightmare
Don’t get me wrong, I still do not like Biden. But he has Kamala and I’d pick Biden over Trump any day.
From now till November 3rd. As you well said, everything will be sexist and racist! And both will supposedly work on behalf of Biden’s pick! However, Trump is not a PC person. He will find one thousand ways to unmask their radical agenda! Trump 2020!!!
Biden Harris 2020, here we come! 🇺🇸
I read a tweet the other day that said the moderates got Biden. The progressives should get a more progressive VP. That makes sense to me. I'd be voting for Biden regardless but I am glad he chose someone to FINALLY represent the most reliable voting bloc in the D Party
Congrats!! Can’t wait to vote for Biden/ Harris!! 💙🥁🙌
You as usual, a HYPOCRITE &amp; LIAR!  It's Biden not a racist anymore? Lol
Is it bad that I am more excited about Harris as VP than Biden as Prez.  Conventional wisdom is that VP choice doesn’t change any vote, which is the case for me, But man that boosts voter enthusiasm!!!  I’m gonna go fantasize about what is gonna b their signature policy GN
Yesssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss!!!!!!!! Biden Kamala for the WIN!!!!
I need a Biden/Harris sign STAT!
Ironic the Trump campaign is blasting Kamala over her criticism of Biden. Mike Pence endorsed and voted for Ted Cruz in the Indiana primary.
Biden’s running mate is the crave that mineral goat
Biden’s running mate is ice age baby
I am SO upset that we have to settle for biden and now also harris as well
Y’all...
Does that change whether you will support Biden?
Biden/Harris 2020! Let’s Go!! 🇺🇸
Really great idea from the Biden administration to pick the one potential VP that has a history with law enforcement right now. 👍👍
Biden/Harris has a nice ring to it.  Can November get here any faster, please? #BidenHarris2020 #VPPick #BidenVP
I don't think Biden ever waivered. I think he always wanted Kamala.
Dont lump all buffons like me with that Biden dude. He is a whole new breed.
🙏🏼❤️ - If Biden had handled this process better I think it would be easier for all of us to jump on board, he has put supporters &amp; those in consideration through the ringer. Which is why hopefully others also realize whoever it is isn’t the bad guy. We need to vote Trump out.
Even if it’s Charles Manson himself, I’ll vote for Biden and blue all the way. 😁
Y'all are spending so much energy on who Biden's running mate will be... He could choose a damn sock and it would be a better president than this clown.
DNC mailed the VP pick to Biden. He didn't choose.  He wants to inform the other losers b4 announcing.
THEY WANT YOU TO KNEEL TO THE NATIONAL ANTHEM &amp; THE AMERICAN FLAG. BUT THEY ALLOW BURNING, LOOTING, &amp; MURDER. THIS IS THE FUTURE OF AMERICA IF BIDEN IS ELECTED
No.  That would only happen if Biden chose a gay man as his running mate.WOW, ERIC TRUMP, AND THE MSM FAKE NEWS, SHOWS BIDEN AHEAD OF YOUR FATHER, THIS IS THE SILENT MAJORITY, MSM REFUSE TO ACCEPT, OR PUT ON TV, YOUR FATHER WILL ANNILIATE, JOE BIDEN &amp; HIS SIDE KICK, CAMEL TOE HARRIS..! 😎🙏🙏🙏🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
Why do you assume/believe that electoralism is the only way to bring forth the socialist revolution?  Also, if Biden fails won't most libs just blame Trump instead of going socialist?  Does the DNC even represent most Americans at all so why so much focus on the DNC?
Constitution says the President's term ends in January. If he refuses to leave, Biden gets sworn in, and orders the Secret Service to escort him out.
You know it funny. I.n the last several months I’ve not seen hardly any Biden signs. This one way flying at the beach back in May. I drive around the county I live in and the same thing. 95% are Trump signs.
You talking about Biden?
The notion that voting for Biden is the only or preferred option to prevent Fascism is laughable.  "This society won't accept us. We form our own. The humans have played their hand. Now we get ready to play ours. Who's with me?"  -Magneto
Hey Biden, knock knock, who's there? Argo. Argo who? Argo fuck yourself we ain't wearing no mask!
Keeping telling us leftist to vote for Biden we will give Trump landslide just to shut you up.
You need to compromise and vote for Biden or else you are letting fascist Trump win so vote for the neoliberal hack.   "America's time has come. This country has become a breeding ground for suffering and injustice. It is beyond saving and must be allowed to die."
They are Socialist Radical Liberal Dem’s now. 5 year old video’s &amp; both parties tear each other up on a campaign 2 lead their party. Wake up! They reunite. Look how Kamala ripped Biden up until he picked her as VP. Dog eat dog. I’d rather live in a Free country than a Commie!
POLITICO: Poll: Biden maintains clear lead over Trump nationally.   via
I would say the clown who had to call out trump in a dog video is the snowflake.   You keep on being mad at the world!   Good luck with Biden ( the racist ) and Harris ( the person who called Biden a racist)
You want to lose money? Biden and Harris are for raising taxes through the roof... and the middle class will be paying them. Trump cut taxes for us.
Vote Marquita Bradshaw tho! Please surprise them thery know Biden numbers wont be high but the GOP would be stunned with even a competitive race. In atleast 5 points and now they have to split the purse in a solid RED state.

Obama and Bernie both got those for different reasons of course. Thats why Biden cleaned up in the primafies was electability.
You’re a crook just like Biden!
I think it's a massively huge mistake to have this election by mail!Trump is gonna drive his loyalist to violence when he doesn't win!If he doesn't find a way to cheat!We already know Russia is helping the criminal! When we get Biden elected U BETTER PROSECUTE TRUMP
I like what I read about her so far, and I might be voting for her too.  I am so sick of the 2 political party fight that does nothing for this Country but produce mean nasty and disrespectful citizens against one another.  Biden with Kamala is already swinging to fight.
You have to be blind and deaf not to see that Biden who had the chance to bring some possible peace between the Political Parties in finding a better peaceful respectful Candidate who is neutral, instead chose a VP who will continue the Division with nasty fights out here.
Why didn't God tell Biden to pick a better peaceful Candidate to be his VP, somebody who would have helped to unite this Country that desperately needs it.  Kamala is already swinging in directions that will not unite us.  A Sad shame for America.  I am Praying.
This s what bothers me a lot, it's the big division in this Country, thus my disappointment in Biden picking You Mrs. Kamala, because you will not be able to unite this Country, as you are already coming out the gate swinging.  I'm an Independent who is fed up with both sides.
Threats?

Good news: Kanye being in the ballot doesn’t affect Biden. It probably affects the Libertarian party, or the GOP
I think if Biden and what's her name get elected we are.
My current election prediction as of Aug. 12th, 2020. Biden with 319 electoral votes, and Trump with 219 electoral votes. My prediction is based on the FiveThirtyEight election model.
"At the end of the day, that dame just had the best smelling hair.  And that's no malarkey." - Joe Biden when asked what tipped the scales for Kamala Harris.

It’s shameful, to say the least. It is clear the Biden/Harris ticket is the wrong choice for our country and inches us closer to socialism. We must preserve life, liberty, and opportunity for all. -
Agreed...but realistically that’s what it is...give Biden a count by number puzzle to the side to look busy and keep from interrupting
The problem here, she keeps proclaiming herself as fully black for no good reason. Instead of just telling the truth, and then she could get them both Demographics she could need to building up her supporter base more.  And plus, she also criticized Biden in the primaries, so...
BIDEN gone be the PRESIDENT. Calm down. Y’all doing too much. 😂

Well at least you are acknowledging that Biden just can’t even risk attempting a single debate himself
How did Joe Biden discriminate? Women have been so underrepresented in politics, especially in the executive branch.
The majority of the people who are voting for Joe Biden are not voting for Joe Biden. They are voting against President Trump. They are suffering from TDS.
You have been totally disrespected by the Democratic Party both at the debates and now at the convention. If the Biden team had any real sense they would have contacted you for the VP slot.
That is what I say. I am voting for Biden. We need #45 out of there.

But honestly, the single best thing to do (if you can) is to tell friends &amp; family (in a chill, strong way) that you're planning to vote Biden/Harris and why. There's a lot of power in the courage of conviction, particularly this year. #Onward
nigga fuck you, donald trump, bernie sanders, joe biden, kamala harris, mike pence, and every other politician and dumbass that tries to get me to to believe anything that any of those bitch ass niggas in office or running for office have to say

That describes Trump, not Biden. Truly a case of projection. Trump is unfit for anything.
Oh and now you want to have a for sure victory for Biden as he probably won't fulfill the entire 1st term, allowing the VP to take charge of the nation. She is not even qualified to handle. She can't even drop the "Racism" issues. Nation wasn't divided until 2yrs. before Trump.
Will DEM Biden-Harris gun confiscation start before mandatory mask rule?
your coverage of Biden's mask mandate misses the mark.  There is no Constitutional authority for a President to order such a thing.  None.  Nor for Congress to legislate it (unless it's a tax).
Let me guess, he wasn’t concerned about where she was born while serving in the US Congress. But now that she’s been named Biden running mate, you’re concerned about where she was born.🤦🏾‍♀️
That's a stupid statement. What makes you think it was The President that got us here? Did he created the virus? Trump has done more for this country in less than 4 years. What have you done, what has Joe done in so many years. God help us from having you or Biden in presidency.

Vote for Joe Biden for president and Kamala Harris for vice president a vote for them is a vote for the American people and our constitution
It’s always mf in non swing states like “I can’t morally vote for Biden” ... okay ur vote doesn’t even matter
remember when kamala harris said she believed the sexual allegation accusations against biden now she’s running w him 🤔
When I see people driving alone with mask and gloves I think Joe Biden bumper sticker
If only that were true. Biden’s handlers chose Harris precisely because of her sexuality &amp; skin color. Doesn’t get more racist than that. They are both place holders.
It’s wild how the left side of the political spectrum thinks a Biden/Harris administration would be a neo-liberal police state and the right thinks it’s gonna be a communist anarchy. It can’t be both.
Libs are funny! For 8 years under Obama/ Biden they lost billions, but you didnt give a shit then ! Go away !
But unless you are voting Biden, it's only half way there.
I’m sure after that VP pick. 🤦‍♂️! I’m feeling nauseous myself! Worst woman on the planet. Still had Biden Jiz on her lips during speech
And a vote for Biden/Heels up Harris is a vote for socialism and the Marxist domestic terror organization BLM and that’s not happening.  #Trump2020

roland is just caught up in symbolism and. now worrried about all the evil shit that harris and biden has done. I dont get people like that
If you vote for Biden we’re gonna have a serious talk
The funny thing is I said the exact thing! The sickest ticket ever! This had to give Trump more points in their polls! Would like to know why stupid Biden didn't pick Rice hell I would think about voting for her if I was a Democrat.
This is the Sickest Presidental Ticket ever! It nothing to do with race but just how it was put together, a joke! Biden is doing anything to be president they don't even like each other! Harris started about the girl be bused but left out (Rich Girl), she never rode a bus!
A 'tremendous running mate' for
I like the vibrant Biden, pumping away at a pretty good clip. Noble upstart, taking on the corporate behemoth.
of course there are many valid criticisms of Biden/Harris. I’m not THRILLED to vote for them either. But the indisputable fact remains that they would be the most progressive administration since at least FDR. suggesting there is any equivalence w Trump is absolutely mind numbing
Like...I LIKE BERNIE! I donated to his campaign!! I would much prefer him to Biden. I just don’t understand the segment of his base that refuses to even follow HIS LEAD. Like...y’all are “so progressive” you want trump to be re-elected?? Make it make sense y’all 😪
⬇️ yes. I am very much a member of left twitter™️, but the faction that sees Bernie Sanders as the one and ONLY true progressive messiah bothers me to no end. We get it, the choices aren’t IDEAL. But your king himself has been campaigning for Biden since the day he dropped out...
You're a liar biden wanted it Cut was said in Democrat debates
Biden has advocated for cutting social security many times
I just want trump to get the hell out. He’s calling Biden our for his past but that man is a racist ass till this day.  The world doesn’t need four more years of him
BIDEN’S FIXATION on cutting Social Security dates back to the Reagan era. One of Ronald Reagan’s first major moves as president was to implement a mammoth tax cut

Kamala the biggest loser Biden could ever pick
Lies he said he wants a Payroll Tax cut even Democrats supported that under Obama Biden wants get rid of Medicare and Social Security
Fake news only Biden wants to destroy social security and Medicare
Like Biden rambling
Let's be honest though,  do we really WANT him using his time on important shit that he will just fuck up? I say leave him in his room with his Adderall and his assinine theories and just hope he doesn't destroy the world before Biden gets in to office.
I was not a Trump supporter but Today I see the light &amp; it almost blinded me! I watch the News conference announcing Harris &amp; she's as ignorant as Biden! If it wasn't for the virus they wouldn't have anything to talked about!
Biden is a liar, he is lying to the people.
Just play video games and wrestle. Politics is a joke there’s no way Biden is gonna lose

Biden was trying tell blacks if they don't vote for him they are no longer black
Biden don't think you're diverse he said so on tv

How does Comrade Biden inappropriately touch Comrade Harris if zhe isn't in his dacha's basement?  And is the new Party dialectic that zhe now doesn't believe zis accusers?  Will CNN, MSNBC and the other Party agitprop organs announce that?

y’all gon be pissed when biden come and ain’t shit changed except the racists ain’t as proud to be racist no more

I like Harris but this will not shore up the progressive wing of the party. Biden needed some one from the Mid-West and progressive. That way he shores up the far left and the swing states Hillary lost in 2016.
Who cares if Kamala thinks Biden is a racist? 1) She’s a liar so she’ll say anything, 2) We all already know that Joe is a racist because of his record, his words, and his actions.
Joe Biden loves praising racist even though he lied and said he never praised a racist before. He praised racist KKK Byrd

President Biden and VP Harris Reach for the stars And as mr.lewis say KEEP YOUR EYES ON THE PRIZE AND LET'S GO GET IN SOME GOOD TROUBLE NECESSARY TROUBLE
Biden is looking to change his ways. Trump is sticking to his guns and is about to drag us down with him
There’s nothing safe about Joe Biden and liberal policies. That’s what dems ran on in 2016 and lost. The policies are unpopular, while Bernie Sander’s message was about popular politics that could transcend party. But that would cost establishment dems their power
I will not vote for Biden/Harris Sam I Am I will not vote for them at a school  I will not vote for them at a pool I will not vote for them here or there  I will not vote for them anywhere. Don't tell me to vote blue no matter who Or I will beat you until you are black and blue.
We definitely need more independent thinkers like you and me! Biden will start visiting black churches; so that the black ministers can get their people in line! It’s like leading the lambs to slaughter! It is so unfortunate that people can’t see through this ruse and charade!😤
Which is why I’m more interested in what the candidates’ platform/positions are NOW rather than what they were when Biden was in the senate in 1995 and Kamala was San Francisco DA in 2005. People change.  TL,DR there is an extremely obvious choice in 2020 and it’s Biden/Harris
nah i tweeted like people are rejoicing for kamala harris and joe biden being the presidential candidates lmao
the bottom line is that NO politician is perfect (not kamala, not Warren, not Bernie, DEF not Biden). Of course some are better than others, but who would you rather hold accountable in the White House? Donald Trump/Mike Pence or Joe Biden/Kamala Harris? It’s a VERY easy choice.
yes 100%!! it is definitely fair to criticize kamala. however, biden/harris is without a doubt better than trump/pence!! I keep seeing people saying that they’re voting third party or not voting at all bc of her which is so disappointing.
Yeah, but wall street funds the biden campaign no way they let warren close to any position inside the white house.
niggas was in the streets sayin we need less police and then say to vote for biden and harris like damn make up yo mind
PREACH!!! Biden Is trying to get the black vote; that is why he chose Kamala Harris! Biden and Harris have incarcerated more African-Americans than anyone else in this country!!! People need to wake up!!!😤😤😤

You're forgetting "nothing will fundamentally change"-Joe Biden
Nobody really wins in this election. Sure, Biden and Kamala Harris might be the sane option compared to Trump, but I don't expect much to change for the better. The status quo isn't going to change.  We wanted Bernie Sanders. We wanted a complete reconstruction of the system.
Warren had the highest percentage of supporters who were "blue no matter who.": 90 percent.

Unlike the current president, Joe Biden has defended the LDS faith multiple times, particularly in response to the same anti-LDS talking points we often hear from, oops, conservative Evangelicals.
Trump likes her as Biden's VP.
She legit hates Biden. Biden feels the same way after she nearly sank his bid in the debates. It's poetic that she will probably be Biden's VP. Trump will just run what she said about Biden in his ads.
To bad, Biden will not be president.
And the Biden campaign has been doing consistent, ongoing outreach to Latter-day Saints in the grassroots. The earliest &amp; most robust ever from a recent Democratic presidential campaign.
Exactly, that's what needs to be done, ask him for names, and corroborate his lies. I strongly believe that Trump has been holding the stupid/non-sense/ no-message-at-all press conferences to try to steal the thunder from Biden’s announcement of his VP... he’s desperate!!

Race or color should not be a factor or consideration in making employment decisions except in appropriate circumstances as set forth at Section 15-VI-C of the Compliance Manual section on Race and Color Discrimination. Black male leaders warn Biden.

Biden is too supportive of Antifa to contrast obviously with Trump as a champion of legitimate democracy. Four years ago I would have agreed with this, but put it nicer.  Now it just doesn't hold up well.
You're getting feisty b/c you are threatened by the truth. And the truth is Biden failed to tell the truth about violence when it counted. And no one truly knows his real stance on defunding.
I bet they won’t pocket campaign funds like Trump though. Good job Biden/Harris. Maybe they can keep spending in Texas and Ohio? #BidenHarris2020Landslide
I don't think you have engaged with me in an honest and serious way.  I think Biden shows serious weakness as "return-to-normal" candidate and does a poor job contrasting with even Trump's poor example.
Also, Biden has not been consistent on police funding.  He said he is against defunding.  He also said he is for "redirecting" some police funding into mental health and other services. Kinda sounds like a euphemistic way to say "defunding".
Carrying water to this degree for Antifa when the MSM was covering up violence amounts to (effectively) supporting Antifa, as I said.  This doesn't count?  Fine, then Trump's bad statements don't either. It's about being clean enough to contrast with Trump, and Biden isn't.
Where do you get this garbage from? Trump is the guy who holds all the time not Mr Biden. Despite what you may have learned from Donny... making shit up doesn’t actually make it true.
Relax. This exchange was this afternoon for Pete's sake. I am looking for video/transcript, but I only find articles about it. Multiple lies/distortions here by Biden at a time when MSM was still lying about "peaceful protest".

You... you think an Antifa "member" created that URL in 2002 and just chilled until the moment then-Senator Joe Biden announced then-City Hall employee Kamala Harris as his VP to finally unveil that they were Antifa operatives all along? 😂
Kamala Harris said she believed the women accusers of Biden!! What happened? She's promoting #BLM
Millie-Vanilla: Joe Biden Reads from Script While Talking to Kamala Harris on Zoom  via
Nah. It’s Biden-Harris for this suburban mom.
Suburban white woman here.  I will 100 percent be voting for Biden, am thrilled that he chose Kamala and believe that my mostly lily white neighborhood is badly in need of greater diversity.
Remember Kamala said she believed Biden's accusers!!
BREAKING: Wikileaks Posts 137 Documents on Kamala Harris Hours After She Is Named Joe Biden's Running Mate  via
She explicitly stated in her statement that she did not think Joe Biden was a racist I would appreciate if you were correct callers who are saying that she called Joe Biden a racist
Only if Biden can sniff her hair or wants to run his leg hair in the sun haha
She’s a joke. Biden is worse. Dems are ridiculous.
Obama would have said the same thing if Biden had picked a bag of oranges.  He’s such a skunk!
stable, competent?   I hope this is a snarky comment because biden is anything but stable and competent.  Poor man doesn't know what day it is.  Shame on his family and the leftards for allowing him to run -  He's going to lose and lose big.....
BREAKING: Former President Selina Meyer endorses Biden/Harris.
All I see tonight is about Biden’s VP pick!!! 🤔 Distracted much?!? Don’t forget what went on this morning!!! 👇👇
If Biden and Harris do not move to pass HR1 and invest in BLACK issues (education, businesses, housing) by year two of the administration, there will be hell to pay. We’re tired of being tired.
I don't need to know 55 things about anybody except my wife
So  “Sleepy Joe” Biden picked “Blow Em’ if You Know Em” Kamala Harris as his VP choice huh? That’s going to be a bigger disaster than my last 3 years on the racetrack! #SleepyJoeAndHisHo
I can’t find anything proving anyone was actually arrested behind truancy. On another note, both Biden and Kamala are on short notices with me. I totally understand your frustration. If I don’t see any substantial progress on black issues in their first year, it’s a wrap.
Has any Presidential ticket put more black men in prison than Biden/Harris?

BIDEN PICKS RADICAL HARRIS
Nah bruh you can’t do Mala like that. Yeah she was a Attorney General but I can’t fuck Biden bruh without a black woman around
The ONLY good thing that COULD happen with a Biden/Harris win is the commutation of #GeorgeGage
Trump and Biden is the best we could come up with? We are doomed....
I'm sorry, but Kamala Harris is not the best choice. Picking her just tanked Biden. I wish he would have picked someone who actually would strengthen his cause.
Chip in to elect Joe Biden &amp; Kamala Harris!!!
Is there any racial or ethnic group that Joe Biden hasn't insulted yet?
🤣🤣dude your hilarious if you can see that please tell me why you agree with your president Admitting to grabbing girls crotch, Adding to putting children in cages, reping white powder and treason on so many levels. Gosh if I continue you might start liking Biden heck Obama 🤣
But Biden hates God  (I almost can’t type that out)
I am from NC and I will crawl over hot coals in a snow storm with Aliens threatening me to vote for Joe Biden!
Hmmm well considering I'm already under the influence of leadership that already feels that way about me, I should be able to just get comfortable huh. I should be use to it. I mean heck do I really have a choice. Same song different singer✌ But Biden stays in tune
Search it again.  If you can vote for Joe Biden for President, your conscience needs some work.
THE POINT IS BIDEN RIGHT FROM THE BEGINING IS THE WRONG GUY FOR AMERICA!
O M G This idiot just lies non-stop. Again with the 'fact' that the country has made billions from China bc of the tariffs. Outright lies about the Democrat (Joe Biden) Platform. For starters it is far less progressive than the majority of citizens want. #M4A, #legalizeit
WHERE IS OBAMA, BIDEN, FARAKAN AS THE KILLING IN CHICAGO ESCALATES. THEY ARE HYPOCRITES!!! AT WHAT POINT DOES THE RIGHTS OF THE LAW ABIDING TAKE PRECEDENCE OVER THE  VIOLENT THUGS, ANTIFA???
Maybe President Biden can exile Trump to South Dakota as condition of pardon, and while there he can effectively disappear from our present and past memories as he nears obscurity.
Still statue worthy - better that dog than Trump (or Biden)
Of course China would prefer Joe Biden so they could manipulate him and go back to the old corrupted way, quid pro quo, my friends.
I'd rather have Biden than a friend of a Falwell
I'm Joe Biden and I approve of PPP as a word when I use the potty
I'm Joe Biden and I approve of Viagra
My name is Joe Biden and I'll cut your nuts off Joe Rogan
My name's Joe Biden and I have approve of this Chitterlings were great when I was a boy growing up in England with Corn Pop on Sundays and momma said Joe you go beat up that neighbor boy who took my panties off the internet
Whatever your ridiculous answer is he’s had 3 1/2 years to be prepared for what he said Obama and Biden weren’t prepared for. No excuses in the American people know it thank God
CAN'T BELIEVE YOU YOU STILL HAVE IDIOTS THAT FOLLOW YOUR IDIOCY AND LIES, PEOPKE WAKE UP, YOU ARE NOT VOTING FOR OLD BIDEN, YOY ARE VOTING FOR A LEFT AGENDA!
True but at the same time Biden and his past policies and his present bumbles say what I said to begin with
Joe Biden=Reconstruction PresidentCongress should open an investigation on Biden’s relationship with CCP.
Watch and see.....negativity will get you no where. Just like Biden.
Yea, those lies were meant for Biden not Trump.
Did I miss a meeting?  Democrats, Socialists, and Communists are all different things still, right?  Seriously folks, if you can't spot the difference between Joe Biden and Joe Stalin, I don't think I'm obligated to take ANY of your opinions seriously

DNC secretly  schedules Joe Biden Cognition test in his basement
Kamala Harris Lies Repeatedly in First Speech as Biden’s Running Mate
Two months ago, Joe Biden told thousands of African Americans the “you ain’t Black if you vote for Trump”
Trump also urges Americans to wear masks but opposes a national requirement. Plus: The NFL tries to virus-proof stadiums, and local school officials struggle with reopening difficulties.
Appropriately called the Harris-Biden ticket! 🤔🙄
I guess Biden isn’t a racist or part of the problem all of a sudden anymore.

Biden and Harris stance on PROABORTION needs to be exposed,  since this is a great evil.
How could I have missed the endorsement of Joe Biden by the Revolutionary Communist Party (RCP)? I heard David Duke’s ringing endorsement of Trump in 2020. He even wants Tucker Carlson to be his running mate.
I’ve noticed everyone jabbing at Obama on where he was born and from and throwing some heymakers at Biden’s VP . But as soon and you throw that combo at them and ask them about Trump past and who he’s married to the so call Patriotic people be like “ well that’s the past”
If Biden doesn't Debate Soon I will sit this election out. Bernie was ready before he was cheated again.
Maya Rudolph, portrayer of Kamala Harris on "SNL," admits she could be busy ahead of the election after Harris was announced as Joe Biden's running mate.
Biden Linked DOD Official Calls for Alex Jones' Death!
BIDEN WAS THREATENED INTO PICKING HARRIS: “HE BETTER PICK A BLACK WOMAN”
Jim Clyburn just said it well- “the road to the left or right always goes through the center.” If Biden/Harris is too “centrist” for you, think of it as a bridge to more progressive policy. There is no comparison between candidates in this election.
Why? I doubt it will influence any policy positions the Biden administration will take.
Is this because you know Biden is not competent enough to get through a debate and therefore cannot be President???
Notice how none of the democrats are trying to disprove that Biden is racist 🧐 crazy huh?
Had to re-read that. Thought you said Kamala would blow Biden.
In other words, there's no chance Biden wins.
I also saw that Biden will perform his own music........
Biden picked a cop....in the middle of the war on cops.
Harris, a 55-year-old first-term senator, will be the first Black woman to compete on a major party's presidential ticket.
Racism - Does it bother you that Biden's VP pick will be chosen by "skin color &amp; gender" instead of character!?!
Joe Biden is a pushover which is why Ping and Putin want him to win. Obiden is afraid to debate Trump..Retweet
Tell us how you really feel Joe Biden!  via
You’re so full of shit and this country would be better off if you had nothing to do with it. You should be ashamed and I bet you’re family is ashamed of you every time you open your mouth ,  You sound like Joe Biden when you talk and you Democrats are idiots.

Advice to Joe Biden. Act just like Jesus did when the Roman authorities questioned his faith and who he was. He didn’t utter a word! He knew the truth! The greatest speech in the Bible. #iwillvote
2 things that probably will not happen this year: Antifa invading Sturgis Rally, and Biden showing up to debate Trump. Why? Because they have yellow paint on their backs
Russia, if anything, like China, supports the new Communist left Democrat party, NOT, the Republicans. You have to be very naive to believe Russia supports Trump, no they support Biden. Just more Democrat party propaganda
Not only does Joe Biden have a. Very sordid past. Ethics and sexual misconduct, but he does not have the wherewithal to  comprehend what is happening globally, much less in our own country. He is unable to effectively communicate any relevant facts. Retire Joe
whats Biden gonna say when Trump asks him a question? C'mon man?  Haha lol
joe biden said Islam should be taught in public schools....been to great  britain?

Legionnaires' disease is not being misdiagnosed as COVID-19, and a missile wasn't responsible for the massive explosion in Beirut. Here are the facts.
Ok. They would probably vote for those who helped them gain freedoms. Sen Joe Biden/Pres Clinton’s 1994 Crime Bill that probably got them to prison, or  First Step Act 🤔
OFFS. Biden could pick a paper bag for VP and his administration would still be INFINITELY better than Trump nation. Don’t look for excuses. It’s inexcusable.
