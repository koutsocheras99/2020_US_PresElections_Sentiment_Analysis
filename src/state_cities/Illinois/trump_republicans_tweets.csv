don I saw today that your said we should have a trump day and day off to vote early. Was funny but Personally I think the day we vote should be a national holiday so everyone can vote.  I find it crazy we don’t have a holiday to vote....keep up good work
please don't tweet when you're president. we've had enough of president's embarrassing themselves with tweets to last a lifetime from trump alone.

😂 Time will tell. I’m a clean slate, basic NBA fan for now. That might change.
So true. I was not a Kobe fan but I feel the sadness of him being gone too soon. And I used to really hate on LBJ but he’s grown on me.
I have been staying for the past two years, and I'm going to continue to say it until everyone listens. The Trump Administration with Republicans behind them, are going to attempt a coup. The result of this at some point there will be violence on the street.
I suspect Trump’s morning tweet about delaying the election lit a fire under Obama’s butt. And he’s good at reading a room. 😂
If this was a regular season I might have become combative 😉 but I’m a clean slate since my sad Bulls aren’t even in this. I hate to admit it but I know the Lakers want this.
DeSantis won by fraud so why wouldn’t he pay Trump back?
Don’t ignore ~$2T, yes T for trillion, sitting in the TGA. Expect lot of bullish announcements with &gt;100 days to the election. New ATH in indicies is one of the ‘Trump’ cards (pun intended).
So once he turned to the right because he loved Obama back then and now you like him lol typical Trump sheep supporter. Clay will be watching front seat laughing having a beer making money of y’all 😂
Trump never debated Clinton. He just abused the truth and her. He does not deserve to “debate” Biden given his lies and corruption. No need to debate a criminal, impeached and convicted and conflicted.
Florida just broke it's daily record of deaths yet AGAIN. Trumpholio was just on the news saying Florida is a success story. Anyone still trusting Trump is a delusional sh#$ bag who is costing lives. DIAF.

America is 💯 behind you Mr President. We love your response to the China Virus and all of your other brave work. TRUMP 2020!!!
Agree 1000%. He was a accomplished man with a kind heart. It is just too bad he fell under the spell of tRump. He was sick for quite some time - I hope he didn’t suffer.  Rest In Peace, Mr. Cain.
I understand.  FYI: If the election were to be delayed, Trump's term would expire on January 20th 2021 &amp; Nancy Pelosi would be a caretaker president until an election is completed. A delay is actually against his interest, which gives further evidence that this is a distraction.
Must we pretend there's an invisible barrier that will protect us? I mean, if I have to I'll play along, but it's not fun.  Say Biden wins by a lot. Does anyone think Trump/Barr can't send uniformed guys to Biden's house before the inauguration to arrest &amp; send him to Guantanamo?
Again, it comes down to choice...some will choose to go to school while others are to afraid...  Everything is a risk... Democrats have been trying to scuttle the economy ever since Trump became president... shutdown is an opportunity for them.
Listening to Trump talk about mail-in voting in his presser is an exercise in suspending reality, truth, and common sense.

Anything to "own" Trump is alright for these creeps.
Hey let’s check in on how Trump’s governance is going...
Trump just doesn't want the poor and dark skinned people to be able to vote by mail. Not brain surgery. More people that vote by mail, the longer it'll take to tally. Again, not brain surgery. He knows he's going to lose so he's discrediting an election that hasn't happened yet.
This is one of the many reasons why so many administrations, Dem and GOP, took a possible pandemic seriously and planned for it. It took Trump to totally disregard all that planning and the roadmap he was given to fight it. He &amp; the GOP are destroying the nation.

Great write-up. Both  and  do a fantastic job, each in their own unique way.  Commentary: There's an art to impersonating Trump. Just ask J-L Cauvin and Sarah Cooper
Trump had it right 4 months ago when he stated if we left it up to the medical people, we would be on lockdown for 3 yrs. They have no concept of the negative ramifications caused by the lockdowns.  They are focused solely on eliminating the virus, at alll costs.  Not practical.
Who's the first moron to blame Trump for this?
Dr. Faucinstein says, "Look what I just bought with your tax dollars!  Enjoy!"
“But it's also possible Trump, intentionally or not, is setting a trap by shifting more of his own vote to Election Day while Biden's ballots face a higher risk of rejection, legal limbo and lengthy counting delays”
You’d think so, but it turns out, they don’t actually give a shit.   Otherwise, all of those retweets of Trump’s old tweet would change some people’s minds.   They love their guy and love when he does and says shit they want.

This dynamic, with siblings who are US citizens, DACA recipients &amp; undocumented all in one family, is quite common  The Trump administration's decision this week—refusing to re-open DACA applications for teenagers who have turned 15 since it ended DACA—exacerbates the hardship
How do you know Trump’s base is full of racists? It’s these generalizations that are dividing our country
Now that Trump has floated delaying the reaction, what chaos would ensue if he resigns, due to health concerns as an excuse, the day of election do he doesn't have to say he lost? Plausible and crazy idea. Lawsuits up the wazoo...
Trump's right. This guy's an idiot.
Right... trump’s a regular comedian.
Yes they know.  This is when being a Republican meant something.  I was a Republican till Trump!
Just a quick question, because I’m not a constitutional expert... Let’s say we delay the election to the first Tuesday in April... Trump’s term ends on January 20th unless he’s re-elected - full stop - so wouldn’t Nancy become president until we can hold an election?
What goes around always comes around.  If Trump succeeds in what he appears to be up, there will be a dictatorship in place of our democracy.  At that point there wil be no need for Congress and they will all be out of work!!
The US Constitution states exactly when the election takes place. Trump can not change that without an admendment which takes years. America this man is sick, very sick. He needs mental healthcare soon. His parents  illnesses genetics are recurring in him.

Going to see Trump killed Herman Cain.
Life expectancy after a Trump rally 40 days.
Her term expires expires 1-3-20. Here's where it gets complicated. Senate Republicans are defending 23 seats. If there is no election, they lose the majority in the Senate, Democrats take control &amp; the senior Democrat still remaining in office is Leahy. Trump won't risk that!
I know.  This is puzzling because Trump doesn't lie.  If only Herman had taken his Hydroxychloroquine.  The poor bastard never had a chance.
But not anytime soon. Not under trump. Maybe, finally, as a last ditch effort? “Only I can save you?”
It is an ethical dilemma. It was encouraging to see Trump's attorney, advisor(s), and campaign manager in prison. But felt wrong to laugh at Gomert's diagnosis.
WHAT A LOSS!  Herman Cain dies from coronavirus he got at the mask-free Trump rally in Tulsa.  Maybe he'll be buried in the Rose Garden as the hero he... never mind.  But Melania is having the Rose Garden dug up...
Because Trump has always shown good judgment
This guy is pure trash. He doesn't give a shit about Herman Cain or his family. It's all about "owning" Trump.  F*cking creep.

In fact, the biggest difference is that Byrd admitted his mistake and apologized while Epstein and Ghislaine (I wish her well - Trump) kept on preying on young girls while he was serving his "sentence" in FL. Trump 100% knew and admitted so. Anyone related should be prosecuted.
Normally, I’d tend to agree with you, but these aren’t normal times. Barr is more adept at lying than trump. There is no accountability. IMO, the best thing to do is shine a bright light on the corruptness, and she did.
I find you hilarious, which is why I keep writing. You make an argument, but when the same argument (not false equivalency, but congrats for knowing that concept) then you completely reject it. It is quite common for Trump supporters to deny all facts to live happily in denial.

“…it confirms that, during a deadly pandemic, you can’t separate the economy from public-health policy. The Trump Administration tried and, as a result, the country is now faced with a tremendous human and financial cost”
Bullshit. There’s no way that wasn’t in the PDB. Trump not bothering to read it is another matter. MUCH of intelligence gathering is unsubstantiated. Doesn’t mean you flat out ignore it. The NYT found evidence it was true. They did more investigation than our own government, FFS.

Obviously Trump loves him to death.
Nothing he does surprises them, get the hell out of here. I think at this point, it would have to be clear to even the slowest person in the White House. That Trump will lie about absolutely anything, at anytime.
He can triple down on it for all I care. I think anybody who listens, to Trump regarding this virus would be a complete fool, and proof of that would be to simply ask. How that disinfectant injection therapy is going?

I think that is what it would take, for Trump to be literally sworn into the KKK, before you would acknowledge his racism.

SURPRISE! Trump was never even invited to throw the first pitch at the Yankee's home opener.  He lied about that out of jealousy over Fauci throwing the first pitch of the poorly conceived MLB season. Trump has since "canceled".
After reading this I’m confused, are black people supposed to be against the racist liberal who’s racist but is “hiding” it or the far right racist that yells n*gger at children while waving their trump flags or spits on minority women and kids?
Ummmm... trump sent federal officers to Seattle because you can opt keep your population from hurting people and breaking shit you moron!!! DO YOUR JOB! You took the oath! Now act like it!
TWO FACTS: 1.Trump will announce a perfect, tremendous, powerful vaccine before the election. 2. He will be lying.  Meanwhile, enjoy the best propaganda our money can buy.  First Phase 3 clinical trial of a coronavirus vaccine in the United States begins
Nope.  Never.  Unless he was anti trump.
But Trump's the "fascist."
Tbh M4A has a better chance of surviving 4 years of Trump than it does Biden and the Democrats. If people don't want leftists to abandon Biden, then give them a reason to vote for him. What no one seems to realize is Leftists vote on morals and policies, not "Red bad blue good"
I wish trump would log off and resign
Like every other semi-rational conservative,  has had is brain completely eaten by Trump. Sad!
I don't think there's an actual chance of this, but I've been trying to think through how anti-vaxxers on the right would react if the vaccine was deemed safe for use weeks before the election and Trump pinned his election chances on pushing it out as fast as possible
My gosh u sound like trump Jesus Christ, lemme guess ur the type of guy to tell a girl after insulting her that it was “just a joke”

Trump is lying, as if that's something new. It's claimed that he won't throw out the first pitch at Yankee Stadium because he will be concentrating on the China virus, is a load of big bull s***. He either wasn't invited to do so, or was told that that invite has been rescinded
Maybe Jake Tapper can ask Joe Biden why he's too chickenshit to sit with Wallace for an interview.   At least Trump did.

What's the over/under that trump brags he allowed john Lewis such high honors at the capital and uses it to claim his good he is to people of color?
Great points.  I just went off the top of my head and I'm not even an armchair expert.  Trump is taking our country down several notches globally.
I can imagine it.  I can also imagine "China Says Trump Needs To Learn Respect - Will Withhold All Meds For A Month".
I'm not an 03 but the only people I see wearing this stuff are wannabes with an unhealthy obsession into guns and "glorification of warfare" that never served. Or are seriously trump hungry.
So you can judge the sincerity of Robert Byrd's apology and deem it inadequate, but you can also judge Trump and give him a pass for his near-daily racist comments. Ok. That makes sense.
TRUMP ONLY DISMANTLES Trump is tanking relations with China. China can easily damage us. Most US consumer goods come from China. Most pharmaceuticals. Much of our tech gear.  The way to have strengthened ourselves was via the TPP, which Trump destroyed because Obama built it..
Why do you think so many members of the Trump administration refuse to put their names on these benign comments to press?
Of course they are. The data is driven by the media and the narrative to keep schools closed.   You people think we’re idiot. It’s no coincidence that as soon as Trump mentioned kids going to school, that suddenly kids all over were getting positive tests.
You seriously think Trump supporters are going to listen to you? 🤣🤣🤣🤣  Biden can’t even form a complete sentence and refuses to take questions from media, debate Trump, or be interviewed by Chris Wallace.   Your party is a joke if that’s the best you can do.
I've read their amendments and quite frankly I think it is OK to say that the Palestinian people are equal human beings and deserve equal rights. I hope you are not supporting Trump's ideology that some people are more equal than others?

Not wrong because it's wrong, but wrong because it might help Trump.  I guess that's better than nothing.
I figured from the beginning Trump's disastrous response to COVID was because he simply couldn't understand what was happening &amp; had no interest in an effective response. More are coming around to that idea:
THIS person wants to call COVID-19 "The Trump Virus".  She'd really be funny if she wasn't so damn dangerous.
Was this a simple inauguration speech, or an ADOPTION ceremony?  WE THE PEOPLE have been welcomed into President Trump's own FAMILY, and his FAMILY comes FIRST!
Trump works for AMERICANS' FREEDOM...for FREE. Democrats work AGAINST AMERICANS...and want a RAISE.  Am I the only one who sees a "conflict of interest" here?

Tons of white friends and acquaintances who used to complain about people of color abusing the welfare system are now gladly collecting the Trump bucks while working under the table jobs... oh the irony
The biggest surprises of the Trump presidency are 1) We aren’t seeing him with Dennis Rodman 2) He isn’t using his catch phrase “you’re fired” when he cans someone. Unfortunately, much of the rest is not a surprise.
Their focus is on the economy as the key to retaining power.  The more people they can force to work in any capacity, the better for Trump.

3/7 As part of this tactic,  Trump has bizarrely invoked Sen. Cory Booker of NJ as the scary face of Democrats wanting to build low income housing in Iowa suburbs.

It occurred to me upon reading this that Trump appointed a Ben Carson, despite having no experience in the field whatsoever, to run Housing and Urban Development, because he seems to think all blacks must know about low income housing. And that says it all.

Trump had it right 4 months ago when he stated if we left it up to the medical people, we would be on lockdown for 3 yrs. They have no concept of the negative ramifications caused by the lockdowns.  They are focused solely on eliminating the virus, at alll costs.  Not practical.
please gets these guys off the air! 1)Trump is trolling! 2) There is no more normal 3) How much free air time is he getting with this latest tweet? 4) Conservatives will come out &amp; vote 5) He’s down in the polls because ppl on the left are nuts so we’re quiet!
Why do you hate our military, who have voted by mail since the Civil War? And why do you hate the Trump family, that also votes by mail?
It's all about what the military decides to do in my book.  As of now, much evidence points to the military turning on Trump if he attempts a self-coup.  Even former MIC lobbyist and current Defense Secretary Esper is against using the Insurrection Act.

Plus, NY State is going to crucify Trump, playing nicely into his messianic fantasies.
Going to see Trump killed Herman Cain.
If Trump supports it, it has to suck
Yep. Sad for the loss of this great man. Within nano seconds COVID is now a disease that if contracted is a death sentence. They will also use his attendance at the Tulsa rally a mandate for compulsory tracking.  It for rioters only Trump supporters.
Her term expires expires 1-3-20. Here's where it gets complicated. Senate Republicans are defending 23 seats. If there is no election, they lose the majority in the Senate, Democrats take control &amp; the senior Democrat still remaining in office is Leahy. Trump won't risk that!
I know.  This is puzzling because Trump doesn't lie.  If only Herman had taken his Hydroxychloroquine.  The poor bastard never had a chance.
It is an ethical dilemma. It was encouraging to see Trump's attorney, advisor(s), and campaign manager in prison. But felt wrong to laugh at Gomert's diagnosis.
WHAT A LOSS!  Herman Cain dies from coronavirus he got at the mask-free Trump rally in Tulsa.  Maybe he'll be buried in the Rose Garden as the hero he... never mind.  But Melania is having the Rose Garden dug up...

Dumb Donald Trump doesn’t have a clue as to what he’s doing in the WH. In fact I hear he gets lost at least once a day and can’t find his way to the Oval Office
“I am concerned that the administration is seeking to rush the process and sacrifice the accuracy of the census for political gain”
12/ It would, if Trump could get out of his own way defer to experts and admit that other countries have done this better.  Then copy them!    Unfortunately, he doesn't have the intellectual ability or emotional maturity to do that.  So it's on us.
7/ 150,000 Americans are dead as a result of that failure.  Last week, we lost twice as many Americans as we lost on 9/11.  Not because we don't have the tools to get COVID under control, but because the Trump WH is incapable of leadership.
6/ That is what most countries have done.  It is exactly the opposite of what the Trump White House has done.  We still don't have a national testing strategy.  We still don't have a national contact tracing database.  We hear too much from Trump and too little from Fauci.
There seems to be a bit of confusion about the prospects for the economy right now, so let's make this simple.  There is only one way to get the US economy going again: get COVID-19 under control.  Trump's utter failure to do so is why the prospects are so bleak.  Thread:

Wow you’re Just lumping in the paranoia. Of course it’s a Trump supporter who is infiltrating the protesters. And then the mysterious unidentified secret police.
“Born-again fiscal conservatives are sign of Trump’s weakening hand in Congress”
Trump is, yes
I tried to address this yesterday. My understanding is doctors have always been the ones making these decisions, they can still do so and all the hubbub is a political distraction. Trump mentioned it and now everybody has to virtue signal their tribe by supporting or opposing it.
She needed a little attention. Lunacy works for trump.
It says it in the first paragraph of your source. "A conservative website funded by a billionaire supporter of Marco Rubio paid for the opposition research that eventually led to the salacious dossier about Donald Trump." If the info wasn't shared, how did it lead to the dossier?
Not cried. I was livid. In Paris with a trump voter. I could not speak to her for hours. First cab we get in, cabbie realizes we’re American and proceeds to ask “what happened” “how can this be” etc. every single cab. EVERY ONE.
Nah, let Biden remodel it himself.  Trump will be gone before they can even get started.
Ya at least 60 million of us out here. We voted for President Trump in 2016 and we Will vote for President Trump again this November &amp; this time it we will be much more than 60 million voters
Yes, the trump administration is going to jail.
He would never. He’s a hardcore conservative who has said publicly that as much as he thinks Trump is a clown it is “imperative” that Republicans retain power. Bolton is a monster.

Regrets can begin to be paid now to ensure a brighter future in November. And post-election day we all work together to build a better country. #BuildBackBetter ⁦
Pritzker and Trump are the same. Just different sides. Both wrong in their handling of this.
As with Ben Carson, Trump only talks about Black doctors who are brain dead.  It's his updated version of portrayals of Blacks in old movies.
Haha! You're wrong. Same info!  "A conservative publication set in motion the research that led to a dossier that includes unverified claims regarding ties between President Trump and Russia, the publication revealed on Friday."
A nursing home gave over 200 residents hydroxychloroquine without state health department approval. People, this is why Trump should keep his mouth shut about a drug he knows NOTHING about. This is a perfect reason if someone taking his I’ll-advises advice
...White House - the Beacon wrapped up the investigation.  One month earlier, Clinton's team had hired Fusion to look into Trump for precisely the same reason."  THE SAME REASON. THE SAME RESEARCH WAS SHARED.
You say they aren't linked, but they are. "The committee heard that the website told Fusion GPS to look into the backgrounds of multiple GOP candidates, not just Trump, and dig up damaging information. But in May 2016 - as Trump neared the top seat in the GOP's run for the...
They probably found out that Trump &amp; Putin were in bed together with the first project and then hired Steele to corroborate it and find out more.
Anything on Trump would have been useful.
They never invited him Claudia just smother Lie ?!!!! Review the tape Mariano looked like he was going to throw up HAD NO IDEA what trump was talking about
You have enabled bigotry and facism by Trump.  You think that is what's "right" for Maine?
You have to remember, it’s all a liberal hoax just to prove trump incompetent. At least that’s what they all believe. I’m not in the medical field, so I can’t assess his competence, but yes he is brain damaged.
Last time I checked, New York and New Jersey were part of the United States, who's president is Donald Trump.
You aren't fooling anyone. You think Donald Trump, the absolute worst president in the history of the United States of America, deserves to be added to Mt. Rushmore!  LOL
This a Trump supporter in Congress. Well there you go.
I am not sure what you are missing. Illinois has been responsible- numbers say so. The youth sports rollback was unwarranted. Pritzker and Trump are almost equal idiots on different sides. Bring me a politician who has reasonable pragmatic solutions.
He is just pissed because President Trump has not retweeted his version of the “truth”.
(2) The obvious example: I DO think Trump sometimes says iffy stuff, but it's a weird assumption that people would want a violent housing project down the road if everyone in it was white. That's how many of 'em DO look in KY, and people aren't generally geeked to live next door.

This reads like a trump parody account what the actual FUCK
So Fusion GPS did all that Trump research for Rubio. Then threw it all out and started over for Hillary. Bullshit. They combined it all into the Steele Dossier.
It wasn't a hoax. It was real. Former intelligence people under multiple Presidents said even if Trump did not read his daily briefing. Someone in his Cabinet should have seen it, especially since it was shared with other countries. They would tell him.
So in case you’re really really dense when we say voting for trump makes you racist. This is the shit we are talking about... because you support this bullshit right here 🤬
Perkins Coie, to compile research about Mr. Trump, his businesses and associates — including possible connections with Russia. It was at that point that Fusion GPS hired Mr. Steele, who has deep sourcing in Russia, to gather information."

Hey - did you guys hear the good news about Trump?  Just kidding.
The only way to accomplish this is to thoroughly and profoundly denounce facist Trump.  You won't
Trump moves to protect the legacy of red-lining. And people actually question the existence of systemic racism. Smh. #StartsAtTheTop
This is gross, even for Trump. Why are so many "evangelicals" captivated by this man?
lol!  There is no one more dishonest than President Trump!
You’re not welcome. You’re columns are a joke. But it is fun to check your headline after the latest Trump atrocity and see you writing about some fucking Greek recipe. Priorities right?
and  are the same guy. Different ideologies but overbearing, overreaching, power hungry politicians looking to control everything. BOTH need to go down. No common sense on either side. Pritzker=Trump
Trump said he talked to Putin on the phone a week ago or so, oh boy, now that Mueller and Comy and Barr, and Pelosi, and, and …… protected him he is becoming brazen about Putin's total influence on him.
Pretty sure  was perfectly fine before Trump, and will continue to be fine after Trump in the years to come, either 2021 or 2025.
My husband its lobbing for Costa Rica if Trump loses.
. is right - Trump's deliberate scientific ignorance has only made the #COVID19 pandemic worse.
Keep drinking the Koolaide man. It's better than facing reality. Trump is a moron and delving into science (Clorox, UV light etc) are not his strong suit.
Phew...the alien craft has landed to take Trump away.
Trump thinks 'Phrygian' is what women do while masturbating.
And why is Trump sitting in the photo when it appears there is one woman in the room? Must be the bone spurs acting up or his wacky delusion of grandeur.
Just trying to get people to believe trump was right. Or money.
Good question. I can think of only two reasons. Money and trying to convince people that trump was right.
BREAKING: Putin doesn't like the latest poll numbers, so he ordered Trump to further weaken NATO now.  12,000 us troops leaving Germany.

C’mon.  Please stop playing cute games.  You also wrote “In his [Cuomo’s] defense, there was a lot we did not know then that we know now.”  But at the same time you make a chart and blame every death on Trump, and I have never seen you make ANY caveats about that chart.
maybe change "Demon Sperm" to "Demon Semen" for the silly rhyme? I can't decide if that would be more or less absurd; my absurd-o-meter crapped out pretty early on in the Trump administration.
He willfully ignored intelligence warning him. Other countries knew about it! Bad leadership.
I never voted for Obama. I was a Libertarian for 20 years until Trump.
Marco Rubio's donor paid for it.
Or windmills cause cancer. Or this beauty: “I tested very positively in another sense. I tested positively toward negative. I tested perfectly this morning, meaning I tested negative," President Trump says.
Not enough to connect the dots. Trump blocked the dots from talking.
You give Cuomo a pass, but not Trump?  I don’t know how to talk to you.  It’s all politics with you.  Not with me.  I’m about the data.
Polling seems to suggest opposition to masks correlates with support for Trump. But Trump supporters, for the most part, are not libertarians and would not describe themselves as such.
It does though. Women - especially in positions of authority - can’t permit people like Trump to behave that way. She could have taken action but chose to let it continue.

Trump's impeachment came after a House inquiry that he had solicited foreign interference in the 2020 U.S. presidential election to help his re-election bid. Then obstructed the inquiry itself by telling his administration to ignore subpoenas for documents &amp; testimony. Impeached.
Mueller was blocked from witnesses and documents by the Trump administration. What is he hiding?
In fact, the biggest difference is that Byrd admitted his mistake and apologized while Epstein and Ghislaine (I wish her well - Trump) kept on preying on young girls while he was serving his "sentence" in FL. Trump 100% knew and admitted so. Anyone related should be prosecuted.
Normally, I’d tend to agree with you, but these aren’t normal times. Barr is more adept at lying than trump. There is no accountability. IMO, the best thing to do is shine a bright light on the corruptness, and she did.
I find you hilarious, which is why I keep writing. You make an argument, but when the same argument (not false equivalency, but congrats for knowing that concept) then you completely reject it. It is quite common for Trump supporters to deny all facts to live happily in denial.
Defying the Supreme Court seems kind of important.  Not impeachment level of course.  Let's wait a little longer, that seems like the right thing to do.
Trump struggles to speak in coherent sentences too... I miss Obama, at least the man could talk.
He has been critical of Trump on his podcast.
It literally says Trump confirms he didn't do shit.
Trump was impeached.
It would have been found if the Senate GOP had not covered up for Trump by not allowing witnesses or new evidence. First trial of this nature in US history without witnesses. Putin has kompromat on Trump and the RNC. We saw the DNC emails. The RNC was hacked at the same time.
Um...if you have sanctions against a country and the fuck up, you give them more sanctions. You are bad at this and Trump is an ineffective leader.
“…it confirms that, during a deadly pandemic, you can’t separate the economy from public-health policy. The Trump Administration tried and, as a result, the country is now faced with a tremendous human and financial cost”
Democrats are nothing but commies! Socialism is communism bastard's son. Wake up America! #KAG2020 #Trump2020  #Trump
Aw...his BFF is helping him out...
Planning for November...
Trump is not sanctioning Putin.
Bullshit. There’s no way that wasn’t in the PDB. Trump not bothering to read it is another matter. MUCH of intelligence gathering is unsubstantiated. Doesn’t mean you flat out ignore it. The NYT found evidence it was true. They did more investigation than our own government, FFS.
Trump is co-conspirator #1.
I didn't want to bring up Russian interference encouraged by Trump, because you think it didn't happen, but that too.
Nice stereotyping. No, I don't blame Trump for my problems, but I do blame him for escalating racial tensions in this country, for taking kids from their parents, for ruining the great economy (and country) left him, and for looking the other way while Putin kills our troops.
Poor Barbara. Believing everything you hear on Fox or read in Breitbart. If they thought they could make something stick, don’t you think our partisan AG would’ve done it by now? Instead, all of Trump’s cronies are in jail. Why? Because THEY are the party of criminals. Wake up.
in other words a witch doctor, I don't believe that, but I know Trump has an African American woman for the sole purpose of further confusing the public, and that the founders of BLM are the ones who proposed her to him.
Imagine where this world would be without Trump. Go swallow some magic milk.
Nothing he does surprises them, get the hell out of here. I think at this point, it would have to be clear to even the slowest person in the White House. That Trump will lie about absolutely anything, at anytime.
He can triple down on it for all I care. I think anybody who listens, to Trump regarding this virus would be a complete fool, and proof of that would be to simply ask. How that disinfectant injection therapy is going?
And Trump has the audacity to compare Melania tonJackie! No comparison!  Jackie had class and style and never danced on a pole wearing hardly any clothes!
I've been looking for an explanation for why clearly intelligent women like Jenna, Kayleigh &amp; other women in Trump land act and speak as they do....and there it is...."nocturnal sex with demons while they sleep". Thanks Doc.

I am also uninsured and I can't afford covid treatment. However, democrats expanded access to healthcare, trump has gutted that expansion as much as he can. Democrats created DACA, trump and his cronies have taken US immigration abuse and turned it up to 11

Donald John Trump June 14, 1946 -- July 29, 2020

I’m glad you know all.  Like what tests they are using, like who they are testing, like how deaths and hospitalizations are reported.  It’s all different, but you compare and not correctly.  Also, if Trump is lying about the stats, then why are they worse?
That’s exactly why the Dems today in the Barr hearing were saying that Trump wants a Law &amp; Order campaign, but then said it was Trump who was breaking the law.  Ludicrous, but they knew their job.

Well Trump did say it was coming!
I just saw some clips of her preaching at her strip mall church...she may be from one of trump’s shithole countries which would be rich
What was that about keeping bad company? Trump knew Epstein "likes his girls on the younger side" but still hung out with him and JUST said of his accomplice, Ghislaine Maxwell, "I wish her well." So, by YOUR logic, Trump hangs out with pedophiles and therefore is a pedophile.
The Supreme Court has spoken, yet President Trump continues to to try and attack #Dreamers and end the #DACA program.  The Senate should move to immediately pass the bipartisan, House-passed Dream &amp; Promise Act and give Dreamers the peace of mind they deserve.In retrospect, Little's 2016 win in this Trump+17/Johnson+7 district in southern Dakota County is one of the more surprising wins of the night. Little is a strong candidate, but Duckworth is raising good money and partisanship might help him win.
This Trump+1.5/Walz+9 district in southern Washington County was a special election win in 2018 if y'all remember that! Anyway, Bigham is handily out-raising Holmstad here
This Trump+5.5/Walz+0.5 seat in northern Washington County is home to the Republican nominee to face Tina Smith in 2018, Karin Housley. She has a big cash-on-hand advantage, but Josiah Hill did out-raise her, which might raise some eyebrows.
This Trump+6/Walz+1 district in the Lino Lakes area was won by Chamberlain in 2016 by almost 20 points, but the DFL flipped one of the State House seats here in 2018 and Justin Stofferahn is raising some very impressive fundraising numbers.
This Trump+2/Walz+7 district in Blaine looks like a good bet to stay in Democratic hands. Newton won this then-open seat in 2016 by just 3%, but Republicans don't appear to be really contesting it this time around.
Just eye-popping fundraising numbers for Piper here in this Trump+8/Johnson+8 district in western Hennepin County. I believe none of it was self-funded either! This is definitely a sleeper race/one to watch!
This Trump+14/Walz+4 district in Mower/Freeborn counties is a district that seems to be trending away from Democrats on the national level, but Sparks is a very entrenched incumbent (first elected in 2002). However these fundraising numbers should give Dems some pause.
The other half of the north-south Rochester split in the State Senate! This seat went to Trump by 0.7 and Walz by 10. Borrud is posting some very impressive numbers, so she has a good chance at beating the one-time Congressional candidate Carla Nelson.
This seat in the northern Rochester area went to Trump by 3 and Walz by 8, but Senjem is putting up some good fundraising numbers and is aided by the fact that Rochester is split in two for the State Senate.
This Trump+21/Johnson+6 district in Wabasha/Goodhue counties is another seat that the DFL is looking to get back after losing it in 2016. You may recognize Kaehler actually from his brief run for MN-01 this year, but he dropped out and is posting some good fundraising numbers.
This seat, which was held by Democrats before 2016, went to Trump by 15 and Johnson by 2. This looks like a reach seat on first glance, but Olson's fundraising is very very good.
This St. Cloud district was won by Trump by 8 points, but swung back to the Democrats when Tim Walz won it by 3 in 2018. This is a top-tier flip opportunity, but Putnam is hurt by the presence of a marijuana party candidate on the ballot.
This Trump+13/Walz+1 district in the Pine/Carlton Counties was the site of a hotly contested special election in 2019 and Lee is fundraising pretty well. However, Rarick is a known quantity here and those Presidential topline numbers definitely help him.
Albrecht is fundraising really well in this Trump+17/Jeff Johnson+3 district in the Grand Rapids area, but there are two Marijuana parties also on the ballot with her (including one candidate with some very problematic views), so that hurts her a bit.
This Trump+8/Walz+3 district in the Moorhead area is a pretty good example of a district that Biden probably outperforms Clinton in. A good margin here for Collin Peterson is also key to his re-election.  As for Eken, he should be fine in his re-election bid.

This Trump+19/Schuette+6 seat in the Upper Peninsula was held by Democrats before Markkanen flipped it in 2018. Janet Metsa out-raising him has to give some UP Dems hope!
Dan O'Neil came very close in 2018 in this Trump+12.5/Schuette+2 district in Traverse City, so now that it's an open seat, he's in a much better position to win. It also helps that his challengers are essentially raising pennies, at least compared to his war chest.
This Trump+12/Schuette+1 district is anchored by the college city of Mount Pleasant (Central Michigan University), so this one may be moved off the board depending on how the pandemic effects college voting.
This Trump+19/Schuette+10 district in the Midland area doesn't seem like a battleground district on paper, but Schulz's amazing fundraising and Glenn's close 2018 win (she won by 4) makes this a race to really keep an eye on.
This Trump+8/Whitmer+7 district in Bay City is a perfect example of a district that might be trending away from Democrats on a national level, but local Dems are still strong. Brian Elder is no exception to that rule here.
This Trump+16/Schuette+1 district in Gratiot/Clinton Counties was kinda close in 2018 (Filler won by 8), so it's going to be interesting to see if this district stays somewhat competitive.
This district, which covers all of Muskegon County minus the city of Muskegon, went to Trump by 15 and Schuette by 3, so there is some potential for the crossover vote here. However, VanWoerkom did almost get Trump's numbers here in 2018, so he's going to be hard to beat
This Trump+8/Schuette+3 district in the Benton Harbor area remains right at the edge of the board for Democrats. Not really a top-tier opportunity, but it's certainly on the board nonetheless.
This Trump+9/Schuette+5 district in the southern Grand Rapids suburbs doesn't look like an amazing flip opportunity, but the Republican incumbent here is not really fundraising that well.
This district, which covers most of Eaton County, went to Trump by 2.5 and Whitmer by 11. Freshman State Representative Angela Witwer appears to be in very good position here. Her 2018 opponent (Barnes) only raised about 5K!
#NobodyLikesTrump the only people that like trump
This Trump+13/Schuette+4 district that covers mostly Van Buren County doesn't seem like a top tier flip opportunity for Dems, but their fundraising there is kinda close, which keeps this race somewhat on the board.
This Battle Creek-area district that went to Trump by 2 and Whitmer by 7 isn't looking so hot for Republicans (who held this seat before 2018). Their fundraising is really paltry, especially compared to Haadsma's.
This Trump+0.7/Whitmer+15 district in southern Genesee County seems like it'll stay in Sneller's hands. I'd be much more sure of that if the Republican candidates filed their dang pre-primary reports though.
Kennedy is facing a pretty decent opponent in Genesee County Commissioner David Martin, but Kennedy has a big fundraising advantage in this Trump+9/Whitmer+9 district in northern Genessee County.
This Trump+8/Whitmer+0.4 seat in Rochester/Rochester Hills is open thanks to a term-limited incumbent and the Dems are doing really good in the money department. Watch out for this seat flipping, especially if suburban polarization continues to happen here.
This Trump+4/Whitmer+7 district in Oakland County voted for pretty much every Democrat (aside from the State House) in 2018 and Pulver is raising some eye-popping numbers here...
This is an open-R held seat in Novi that voted for Trump by 4 and Whitmer by 6, but just eye-popping numbers from Cherukuri here. He's probably the best bet for Republicans to keep this seat, just judging on fundraising numbers.
This Trump+9.5/Whitmer+6.5 district in Macomb County is exactly the type of district that flirted with Trump in 2016 and then flew back to the Democrats in 2018 (The only D to lose it in 2018 was Dana Nessel, but only by 40 votes!)  Shannon is in a pretty good position here
This Trump+16/Schuette+1 district in Macomb County looks like another reach district for Democrats in their quest to take the State House. Dems are kinda competitive in the fundraising department, but Marino has a sizable cash-on-hand lead.
And I give to you The trump death cult
This Trump+7/Whitmer+7 seat in Livonia seems like a perfect contender for a suburban district that will only get bluer and Pohutsky is putting up some good fundraising numbers to further that case.
This Monroe-area seat went to Trump by 18, but Gretchen Whitmer only lost it by 1 in 2018. Slat raising some good fundraising numbers should give some encouragement to Dems here, but this remains kind of a reach seat for them.
Yeah Putin is celebrating now with trump’s vodka but come January 2021 party is over.

Here is the statement from  expressing the bishops' opposition to President Trump rescinding a fair housing rule dating back to
Right !!  Trump/Russia  Russia/Trump !! like the 2 PBS shows &amp; Frontline = now running!
Suburban Lifestyle Dream trump translation no ni_ _ ers allowed.
And I am here to inform you that the  is against what President Trump is doing here.
And Trump would pardon him if there was.
So this ie what Trump spoke to Putin about . Payback for 2016 election help.
Hillary didn't end up being the first woman president, but Trump is the first president who definitely isn't a man.
Because there's a Trump  crony sitting on millions of doses. It's basically an ad campaign.
I am sure Trump the moron was influenced by his best buddy Putin! He must have gave him the secret police talking points! We have to remove this administration and all that enabled him!
Maybe Trump had dream demon sex.
I just hope that Dr Fauci does not get Epsteined because he’s more popular than trump.
Jonathan Swan was OUTSTANDING!!! Trump is without a doubt a Russian asset an (UI). The world 🌎 should stop turning for 3 minutes so EVERYONE can see this interview. We can’t wait until Nov
He’s a Russian Useful Idiot )UI). Leaned about them on SHOWTIME series Homeland. The different is trump eyes are wide opened. He knowingly embraces killing US troops to keep Putin happy. This should be shown on EVERY news outlet! We hv a Russian spy in the White House.
Jonathan did an outstanding job!! America Thank You! trump has Spoken with Putin 8 times and never once brought up bounties on US Troops. 8 calls no transcripts bc they were all about how to steal the 2020 election. All of this unrest/chaos is Putin’s idea.
Political propaganda? 2 weeks ago Trump said he was releasing and signing into law his healthcare law that protects Americans with pre-existing conditions. 2 weeks are up again yet here you are carrying water for a con man. What’s in it for you I have to ask?
Makes sense Trump rallied against the swamp but he is the leader of the swamp! His whole adminstration corrupt swamp destroying our country!
He is right nothing is returning till normalcy till we have a vaccine and new president in the white house. Till Trump the moron is removed from office we are stuck!
Right on Dr Fauci. We love you and nobody likes trump.
I thought it was bc tRump had personal money in it.
This seat, which covers Lawrence/Carter Counties and went to Trump by 56 and Bevin by 5, is shaping up to be a very good test to see if Democrats can hold on to their coal country seats.
This Floyd County district voted for Trump by 50, but Beshear by 5. Combine that with the fact that the Democratic incumbent here ran for re-election, Dems here are in a lot better position than in other districts.
This is an open D-held district that went for Trump by 68 and Bevin by 18 that covers most of the non-Pikeville portion of Pike County. Kinda follows the story of most of the open coal country D seats honestly!
This open D-held district that stretches from Estill County to Breathitt County and went for Trump by 54 and Bevin by 17. Clemons-Combs is putting up a good fight though, but polarization might flip this district red.
This Trump+8/Beshear+17 district in Lexington is another example of the suburban swing that has been benefiting Democrats nationwide. Stevenson is handily out-lapping her opponent in the money department, which is the icing on the cake for Democrats in this district.
This Trump+15/Beshear+18 district in Richmond is a top-tier flip opportunity for the Dems and having a big cash on hand lead has to be music to their ears.
This is a Trump+43/Bevin+8 district that Democrats got really close in 2018, but the fundraising isn't pointing to another good performance from them this year
This Trump+31/Beshear+3 district that stretches from Bath County to northern Lexington was previously held by Democrats before 2018 and they're looking to get it back
On paper this seems like another "gimme" seat for the Republicans. It's a Trump+49/Bevin+14 seat that's open thanks to a Dem retirement. However, the Dem here (Bracken County Magistrate Craig Miller) has raised some very good money to keep it close.
This is a Trump+25/Beshear+2 district in the Cincinnati suburbs, so Democrats have some hope here that continued suburban swings creep their way downballot. Koenig also only won by a surprisingly small 10 points in 2018, so that may be the case...
This is an open D-held district in the Versailles area that voted for Trump by 12 and Beshear by 16. Allen should stay the favorite, but Fister does have a good chunk of change on hand there.
Good news for Republicans in the fundraising department, but this suburban Louisville district is trending away from them. It went from McCain+10 to Trump+2 to Beshear+17
This is an open D-held district that stretches from Gallatin County to Henry County. It voted for Trump by 45 and Bevin by 14, so it's a very tough hold for the Dems.
This is an open Republican-held seat in Lexington that voted for Trump by 11 and Beshear by 15. Pretty good news for the Democrats the fact that the Republican seems to just not care about fundraising.
Yes that's right, Lockett raised NEGATIVE MONEY! That means he had more refunds than actual donations I assume. Anyway, This is pretty good news for Democrats in this open-D seat in the Nicholasville area that went for both Trump and Bevin.
This Trump+7/Beshear+14 district in suburban Louisville is another district ripe for the flipping for the Democrats. Nemes only won by 2 in 2018!
This Trump+18/Beshear+11 district in suburban Louisville is a good flip opportunity for the Democrats. Bratcher, a pretty entrenched incumbent, only won by 6 in 2018!
This Trump+34/Bevin+3 district in Meade County may not seem like a top-tier flip opportunity for the Dems, but they only lost this district by 6 votes in 2018!
This open-D seat in the Allen/Simpson Counties area is probably the closest thing Republicans have to a "gimme" seat in the State House. It voted for Trump by 52 and Bevin by 21, so it's a very tough hold for the Dems.
Glenn posting some strong fundraising numbers in this Trump+15/Beshear+13 district in Owensboro. We'll wait to see what Johnson has posted, but this district might shift to Toss-Up soon!
Wiederstein is one of Kentucky's most endangered freshmen State Legislators and that cash on hand disparity is not good for him in this Trump+26/Beshear+6 district in the Henderson area.
Schamore faced a tough re-election bid against Calloway in 2018 in this Trump+37/Bevin+5 district. It appears to be the same again this year, but Calloway is hoping that increased polarization benefits him here.
This Trump+22/Bevin+1.5 district in the Paducah area should stay in Republican hands, but this district was in Democratic hands as recently as 2018, so there is some hope for Snardon here.
The site of a somewhat notable 2019 special election, this Trump+62/Bevin+13 district that stretches from Elliott County to Pikeville should stay in Republican hands thanks to Wheeler being a bit more entrenched.
This battle of Johnny/Johnnie Turners is taking place in a Trump+58/Bevin+8 district in the heart of coal country. Johnny Ray Turner is hoping that ancestral Dems carry him to victory, while Johnnie Turner is hoping that the ancestral Dems who now vote R carry him to victory.
This is a Trump +18/Beshear +6 district located in the southern Cincinnati suburbs (northern Kenton County to be precise). It's exactly the type of district in Kentucky that would be shifting to the Democrats, but the Republican incumbent here has been re-elected twice already.
This is an open seat that's been held in Democratic hands since at least 2004, when Julian Carroll was first elected there. It voted for Trump by 24 points, but went to Beshear in 2019 by almost 8 points.  (This seat is located in the Frankfort area)
Sure? The reason they sold out so quickly is bc tRump bought them for his cronies for Christmas this year🐥
#Gamblinman pissed off Some little bitch from Wisconsin threatened Trump supporters on CSPAN. Whoever you are come get some you freaking coward. However if you come looking for me, bring a body bag cause all I have is garbage bags. I am fed up with this BS!
This has more personality than tRump
He’s such a child.
Of course they did illegal things.
Good!
trump teabagger
When I was thinking I was making some progress on family members who were agreeing on most of what I was saying only to find out they're still bigots voting for a piece of shit like trump..family gatherings about to be HEATED because I'm ready to tear this shit down
Would you really want Trump to sully John Lewis's memory by saying something stupid?
Again, i get it. But can we honor these men, who totally deserve it, and not make it about Trump? Like yeah fuck that guy, but lets celebrate Fauci and Kaep for what they are, heroes
Hay trump go f your self.losser
Does Eliza see Trump becoming President at the end?  😜
🎶🎶🎶 and then there's Trump🎶🎶🎶
1. Donald 2. J. 3. Trump
There are much worse turds you could vote for. The thing I remind myself is that Biden is going to be an interim president. The main focus needs to be get trump out. We need some breathing room.
Give it a rest, Veterans back Trump!
She’s clueless to how Americans are suffering now.
⁦ Sir, as former Cleveland Baseball Team manager Lou Brown once said, what the hell is this crap?
Everything’s trumps fault right? It’s not like the best doctors and scientists in the world weren’t by his side telling him what to do the whole time. Oh wait... they were. Trump is a business man and president not Jesus Christ.
Americans weren’t prepared for this because it had already been spread throughout the country and wearing a mask wasn’t proven to help in the early months of the initial “outbreak”. We quarantined that’s the best we could do. How do you blame trump when China let it happen.
99 days away: Donald Trump hits a new low ahead of 2020 election -
Absolutely agree with 'helping Donald Trump' part. Of course, these means that those who want to 'help Donald Trump' might actually be doing the property damage. Regardless, we're in an unholy mess.
But did he meet with trump?
I could see the opinion columnists now: "How Trump's newly shaved head is a dog whistle to white nationalist skinheads"
How many press conference donald trump do in a single day?
Mark Zuckerberg makes huge profits off of Donald Trump's #Facebook ads. He'll never give those up no matter how many lies they contain. Time for federal regulators to investigate and act.
#donald trump  mayor of Chicago.
Guy finds a knot, claims it was a noose, left for him, made an enormous thing about it and after investigating found it wasn’t a noose and had been there for years. Trump thinks the guy should say sorry for over reacting and that makes Trump a racist. I don’t think so
If Hitler, Stalin, and Atilla the Hun had invaded America together they could not have down the damage Trump and his gang have.
Trump could spend the rest of his life on camera and never hit as many gaffes as Biden...ever!
Is it acne scars? Trump wears the makeup to cover acne scars? I wonder. #TrumpIsNotWell
I don’t know you nor do I know what you are or are not trained in. And I haven’t seen Trump himself claiming he has urban military tactics training. To pipe down there bin  Laden
Keep telling yourselves that...trump could lose, absolutely possible.  Dems could lose presidency, and the house...then what would you do with all three branches red?
This helps trump...bunker Biden is going to struggle!
Hay mr trump dont run for president  run for mayor of Chicago clean this bitch up.
This should be interesting....what did he mishandle,exactly? Trump isn’t perfect but I would argue he got blamed more for the failures of the left as the democrats politicized this from the beginning
Ok, I will bookmark this and show you how trump took the stock market from 18k to ?(27-28k) in a matter of months...never before and never again will an increase in percentage happen in such short time
So let me see if I follow you...stock market success can not be attributed to Trump but the stock market failure can be attributed to Trump. That’s how you know you are a hack!
Says the guy cherry picking stats from the pandemic (Trumps worse numbers) to prove how bad trump is for the economy...hahahaha
Stock market: At the lowest under trump is better then the highest under Obama
The left media hates trump, never accepted the 2016 election and skews information and presents it in a manner to paint trump as awful. I can acknowledge that trump says stupid shit but...economy, he does well with
The difference between you and I is that I can acknowledge politically skewed material with context and develop a sound rational opinion. (Like the Biden image). Trump never hurts the economy. Trump doesn’t push division, he just pushes against the radical left.
The context is: trump achieved the greatest economy ever prior to pandemic, economy took a huge hit due to pandemic. Pandemics are bad for economies. Everything else is opinion...and to push any narrative about trump failing the economy is biased. The pandemic failed the economy
No wall? Seems like there is 200 miles of it and amimal activists are crying and wanting gaps put in...so why are they crying if it doesn’t exist?And trump got rid of NAFTA (2016 promise) and signed a new deal. Trump supporters doesn’t burn down cities, that would be BLM &amp; Antifa
And now Floridians are paying the price for his stupidity.🤬
He is a snowflake because he calls the bias media “fake news”. I don’t think so scooter! Enjoy 4 more years of trump and watch the economy make the v shape recovery. #TrumpKeepsPromises
The left hates trump and spins everything in an attempt to smear him.Trump cares about the lives of every American and he is doing his best.He could have taken a better stance on masks but in his defense the science isn’t sound in favor and the left made it political immediately
Trump closes travel down = he’s labeled fear monger  Trump pushes to open schools = he’s labeled child killer. Trump has made the best decisions based on science as he can. What you witness is pure American politics mixed with extreme media bias.
That’s not how it works here...Trump is not a dictator. Ultimately local government has the authority. Trump sent a hospital ship to NY but couldn’t force cuomo to use it. Instead of taking trumps help cuomo sent positive patients to nursing homes. That’s purely political &amp; evil
Nobody? Watch the news...look at cuomo’s poster. Everyone wants to blame trump for everything when half of the decisions were not made by him.
Every death is bad. Don’t blame trump, the left has made this a political agenda. And stop trying to win an arguement with predictions over facts.  NY has 3.5x the deaths of Germany. MA has 1.7x the deaths of Germany.  FL has 2x the positive cases and 1/2 the deaths
Reasons not to compare: Doesn’t fit left agenda Makes Democrat governors look bad Scared of factual numbers You want to blame Trump for everything You are likely a snowflake
Covid, jobs, race and they see Trump is exactly like a bad employer, slow to action, poor planner, out for a fast buck and a real asshole.  #TrumpIsACompleteFailure
Deflection: the action or process of bending away or to change course  U: Trump’s inactions killed 147k Me: Cuomo and other Dems failed making it political U: that doesn’t affect me  I point out failures of left and you deflect with “doesn’t affect me (orange man bad)”
You should be praising President Trump, so far shootings over the weekend have been significantly reduced.
Simply known as the “ Trump Virus” and rightfully so......  Trump owns this 100%. Too bad we don’t have a president who can multi-task, ya know?
Fauci said we didn’t need to wear a mask...he changed his stance and trump eventually did as well
Trump didn’t fill nursing homes Cuomo didn’t stop subways until May 6th to clean them (after 26k dead) Cuomo refused to use federal resources Cuomo still leads the death count but shakes finger at Florida and Texas
They look like trump supporters. He can really pick them
Trump will do that to you.
4 more years of President Trump please!
That is so sad and tragic. The left will be surprised again when Trump wins because most of us are keeping our vote to ourselves.
Despite having a lot of Obama/Trump towns, it's also home of the only Romney/Clinton town in Rhode Island (East Greenwich)!
Trump not only bent the knee he kissed its ass
Your little Microsoft word letter isn’t gonna do shit boys. Leadership is action not words. That’s why Trump will get my vote.   #DrainTheCesspool #ExposeChicagoPolitics
If there is the almighty pres trump will prevail
'What does Ghislaine Maxwell have on Trump,' asks new attack ad by Lincoln ProjectYes then thousands of doctors and scientists engaged in a grand conspiracy to make sure Trump was wrong.   Hundreds of countries-thousands of politicians-sacrificed hundreds of thousands lives ALL BECAUSE THEY DONT LIKE TRUMP  Do you see how bat shit crazy that all sounds?
They want school to open if it's safe It's not My daughter is not sending her children to school Biden is listening to doctors Wow Herman Cain died today lady and your still pushing for schools to open Trump isn't sending his  son Enough said
The presidential election is a federal election. House is a state level election. If the state elections are still held, they are sworn in on the third. Making Pelosi holder of presidential power during the sede vacante from when Trump's term ends until a new president is chosen.
What type of tranquilizers were used on Trump this afternoon, his slurring was scary and such low energy?  He sounded so defeated.
Please read Rick Wilson's book Running Against The Devil He knows how to defeat Trump And don't bother with the evangelicals They see Trump as God My sister is one and nothing will change her mind  I m voting for you and praying every day this madness stops
Trump's Deranged Supporters? Nah, I don't think so.  Go on somewhere, you hydroxychloriqueen.
Thank you We can not take one more year of Trump Look how he is trying to subvert the election
“We have it under control” “It’s going to disappear” “It will go away” “It’s gonna be gone” “We have prevailed” “It’s fading away” “I’ll be right eventually”  150,700+ reported deaths by  COVID-19 in the U.S. over six months.
Davis Vows No Delay In 2020 Election Despite Trump Tweet
Trump is killing me. Stop this madness
Shame on anyone making excuses. He died because he made a terrible decision in following Trump’s antimedical advice.
Trump is giving me a stroke.
President Trump has explicitly floated the idea of delaying November's presidential election, a contest in which he currently trails his opponent by double digits
There's no way he will drop out Trump knows he's in legal trouble and can't drop out I only wish he would
Either Trump is having a stroke or he is giving us all a stroke in real time
Perhaps Trump is experiencing a stroke. His voice is shakey
Annnnnd...MORE Trump lies!
If Pompei would have had his way, there would have never been a British, French or American zone. Only Russian.  Info: Grafenwöhr is one those bases that Trump wants to remove troops from. Before the end of WWII, this was a nazi German soldier proving ground.
He would Trump is worse than a three year old Jealous of anything or anyone that takes attention from him Ugh I'm so sick of Trump What a pos
Trump floats idea of election delay, a virtual impossibility
Finally the truth be spoken,I knew that I passed the test,close one ☝️ LMAO 😂
That’s why all the 25th Amendment wishful thinking tends mostly to discredit those pinning their hopes on it rather than being a meaningful way of removing Trump, for example.
No.  You're just looking to contest the election before it's even been done.  No matter how it's done, Trump will inevitably say it was rigged if he loses.  Watch if he wins how fast he flip flops. He said the same in 2016, that everyone was against, yet he won.    .
And if he had, he'd be getting raked across the coals, just like Trump.  But he would never do that because he's not an idiot.
Again, you can be a racist/segregationist in the US. That doesn’t mean you’ll be able to implement your agenda (because it’s illegal). Trump is a textbook fascist.
No. Travel ban was a limited set of countries. Trump called for the complete shutdown of all Muslims entering the country. Then he settled for travel ban because he was told he couldn’t do it (it’s illegal).
Trump's just paying Putin for reelection help.
Trump doesn't read.   Doesn't pay attention if something is read to him.    Watch him read a speech and he can't followed a teleprompter.  He doesn't have the comprehension.
Did watch it all.  You must have slept through part of it.   Trump is in love with Putin and has no problem selling us off to him.
Wow. This may be the first time LaHood took his head out of Trump’s ass!
Do you know how easy this is?
Trump has never cared about keeping his positions consistent.
Kayleigh has said he's tested twice a day.   He said he took hydroxy. Hasn't said but im sure he shoots up bleach and he probably bends over his gold toilet for his nightly light treatment.   Trump's all good
Cain literally sacrificed himself for Trump. I’m sorry anyone is dying from #COVID19 but some of these people are showing why we need to follow the science, not the nonsense coming from Trump &amp; company.
Trump is a fascist. Its not about personal freedom. Its about his insistence that the media is lying about severity of the virus and its all been blown out of proportion. He doesnt give a shit about freedom. He just hates the media.
Not only does Biden wear a mask, he advocated that everyone wear them.   Basically, the exact opposite of Trump.  This is so stupid. Youre actually claiming he wasnt against wearing a freaking mask.
Maybe new York will send one Trump sent them that couldn't be fixed.
Nonsense. How has the left “politicized” mask wearing? Wearing a mask doesn’t mean you support them. It means you believe it helps stop the spread. Trump refused to wear one for months. Made it his mission not to wear a mask.
Trump does not joke. He is dead serious because he wants to kill us all.
WATCH Chicago Mayor Lightfoot RUN to CNN and Complain after Trump Sends ...  via
Like Trump,  he still wouldn't see
No. His racism is even stronger than his perverted sex drive. And PLEASE stop asking questions that make me envision tRump with an erection.
Ha, ha, ha. Keep digging.  If this ever ends, I'll be mildly interested to know what caused Turley to go into the tank for Trump.
Congressman  swats down a pipe dream from  who publicly floated the idea of delaying the election.   Noteworthy: Davis is the ranking GOP member on the House Committee that oversees the FEC and elections. Like Trump, he opposed expanded vote-by-mail.
Trump needs to move on and resign now.
Maybe not great timing, considering that Trump had two years to do literally anything and all he did was provide a tax cut to himself and his rich friends.
Death by Trump Rally &gt; Thoughts &amp; Prayers
Ooh ooh, address the issue of "Death by Trump Rally" in a posthumous tweet
Death by Trump Rally is a major problem in 2020
Death by Trump Rally is a serious issue in 2020
Trump never should have had that rally. He should never have turned wearing the mask into a political statement.   Dont listen to the world's biggest doofus. Socially distance. Wear a mask.
Trumpism 101.   Dont like a piece of information? Deny it!   The commerce department reported the number. They work for Trump.
Still better than Trump's far right America.
Trump just floated the idea of delaying election, obviously fucking clueless that Pelosi becomes president in that situation.
That was then, this is now. What does Trump do NOW, when unemployment's the highest it's been since the Depression?
Attended a trump rally, caught Corona virus, died at 74.  Herman Cain, Former Presidential Candidate, Dies at 74
Because he's a racist.
He died the minute he turned his back on conservativism and became a trump sycophant.
Defend the Clean Air Act from Trump Administration Attack
John Lewis is dead; Herman Cain is dead. Time for Trump to move on.
No it isn’t. This was tweeted out to watch our far left media freak out. This was floated 4 years ago by our “no agenda” media. When universal mail in ballots became an idea, Trump fans said, “I hope he floats delaying the election...watch how fast they stop talking about it.”
Stop this talk now, ⁦ before our country bows to tyranny.
You MAGA folks "balls deep in your sisters"? Your Messiah seems to think you are. He doesn't give two shits about anyone but Trump. Wake the fuck up!
I need to hear you loudly denounce Trump’s call for a delay to our elections and then I need you to ask him to resign. Short of that you are supporting a move every fascist has ever made.
Trump’s FDA revoked its approval for covid treatment, right?
The fact that people are blaming Trump in the replies is hilarious. Everyone was all for tanking the economy in March/April because of the pandemic and now it’s all Trump’s fault. I’m really not sure who’s more delusional nowadays, Trump’s fanboys, or the lunatics on the left.
Didn’t Trump’s FDA revoke their approval of hydroxychloroquine’s use for treatment for covid? How is this still a discussion?
In the news that anyone could have predicted...  Trump floats idea of delaying the November election, a power granted to Congress, as he ramps up attacks on voting by mail

If you think the ENTIRE world is ignoring a possible cure to hurt Trump you are an idiot.   There has been study after study that has shown it isn’t a consistently successful treatment. But you guys keep on trusting people who lie on a daily basis
Trump: "why don't I have a high approval rating... with respect to the virus?"  Everybody: No one trusts you. You have proven yourself to be a liar and someone who cannot be trusted.
We are witnessing how large corporate conglomerates manage messaging world wide. They are intrinsically tied to the CCP. The CCP uses their flow of money to purchase corporations and their access to the world as easily as going to the corner store to buy bread and butter.
Because Trump has business dealings with Russia. We all know that right.

Its real simple people when you vote, Do you want someone who Protects America &amp; American Values (President Trump) or do you want someone that protects Terrorists &amp; their Anti-American Values (Joe Biden/Obama)
He's mentally ill and that's why he misses details like that His enablers and family have to know this I can not wait to get rid of all of them When Trump's voted out they go to
They want businesses to close, so unemployment will be high, and they can win. The dems have done nothing but try to get Trump out of office and this is their last attempt! I mourn for what our country has become😢
China is to blame they did not disclose it until it was here! Fauci first said we have nothing to worry about, Trump didn’t want to close the country and I don’t think he should have but he listened to Fauci. That was the mistake
No. I live in a low income apartment in the suburbs. Why can't we live in the burbs? Our neighbors love us and we all get along. Trump can kiss my ass!

The Trump Virus continues to destroy state and local government budgets and 45 wants to punish them instead of helping.
So much for Trump’s vaunted supposed about-face on masks. (As if his promotion of the bullshit antimask video didn’t already tell us that.)
I'd rather have lunch with a roach than Trump 🤮
I don't understand this either His followers are blind to him and it's just horrible What I miss is nothing to the families that have lost loved one and friends Trump's supporters  have to have a heart of ice not to be sad about this This scares me so much to think about this
fuck donald trump
The point of my tweet was to ask the ? what makes Trump's claim unproven if Dr's all over the world are using it to treat patients?  Is it because the FDA hasn't approved it?  Is it because the WHO doesn't recommend it? The CDC, the NIH? What makes it unproven?
When I said "people who like Trump cuz he's 'not a politician' should have teeth drilled by 'not a dentist'" I WAS JOKING. WTF is this "I'll decide for myself which drugs are good" nonsense?   Laura Ingraham does NOT get her hair bleached by some rando off the street.
Ill never understand modern #GOP and Trump supporters  You get lied to on a daily basis.   Not complex/ hard to discern lies. Not middle of the road maybe it could be lies   Gigantic unending disproven bat 💩 crazy brainless inconceivable lies   And you go back for more
That you would sell out your own Country and citizens for the sole purpose of keeping Trump in power, maybe?
Time for Top Brass to Mutiny on Trump's Bounty
if Trump loses, who will be the new leaders or face of the Republican party? If anybody.who would you want it to be?
You live in an important swing state and Trump can't win without OH so he is gonna raise a ruckus and try to scare white voters
GOP will forever be the Party of Trump
Oh I believe the same Trump will never debate Biden VP Biden has too much to take Trump over the coals with I too would start with Why did you not confront Putin about bounties on our soldiers? Trump would be screwed He's stupid if he does debate Biden
Name two things you won’t find in the Trump administration.
No, why would they? American lives aren’t important to Trump.
So, I’m dog and housesitting for my aunt and uncle who are racist, homophobic, transphobic, anti-maskers, trump supporters, etc. (my aunt isn’t sexist and is very pro-choice but my uncle is the one that doesn’t step in when i’m being sexually assaulted so😬) and I am watching BLM
Trump dismisses virus aid for cities, lashes out at GOP

He never will I don't know what's wrong with these journalists including Chuck Todd Trump is insane and that's his tone It's not going to change
Remember when that US senator used priveliged info to make money off of coronavirus with her husband (president of the stock exchange) and then trump gave $758 million to Kodak to become a pharma company and people insider traded that too and 30mil ppl are being evicted
Trump asserted his phone was tapped 4 years ago. How long does it take to get evidence of a phone tap? You’ve swallowed the hook, dude. The emperor is buck ass naked.
Maybe it’s the lack of evidence for these far-fetched conspiracy theories that Trump boot-lickers have been beating off to for four years. MAYBE.
President Trump does work tirelessly...if you talk about golf &amp; endless vacations...look at former POTUS. At least he does his best trying to get things done for the American people. If media &amp; socialist Democrats supported him ...just think what could be accomplished.
I thought that was what I remembered.   Like Trump you can see when Barr is lying.
What do you think it will take to stop the violence?
The historic Democrats are gun owning working class. They are the Trump base. Curious to see how the working class dependent upon hourly jobs will vote since Biden supports keeping them unemployed. As those financial pressures crush this group the votes will shift to Republicans.
He knew he was a fool once again.   And after a Fauci threw out the ball and had a baseball card made of him.  Trump is so disappointed
Do you think President  should have gone?
Trump loves Russian bounties. He eats them for breakfast
This is why they are pushing #Hydroxychloroquine so much  It was another time the Trump administration burned Americans tax dollars

You're absolutely right, Epstein didn't kill himself, BLM is a marxists movement and Trump will get reelected. Glad you see it that way too.
Doesn't anyone learn their lesson? Remember 2016  Oh I don't like HRC so I won't vote We must avoid this Biden can't put in more than one person for VP He could still have Senator Warren fill another position Get over it Rick Wilson is right put aside the petty crap Defeat Trump
I'm with the dishonorable bill barr on this one--I also don't read trump's tweets. However, they're usually so fucking stupid, the tweets are always read on the news.   AG bill barr, do you read the newspaper or ever watch the news?
Another pathetic lie Where did you put the pandemic playbook? Between Trump's ears?

They like the usual. I look at Trump's presidency in the way of the era of the great depression. Many people didn't like the president's that got the us out of the spot cause of these new deals but they needed to trust them. I trust Trump with my money all I ask is if there's

And again, the case in New Jersey is complex.
I would take those, but I heard the side effects, including denial of reality and worshiping Donald Trump, are especially potent.
“Both sides” is lazy thinking and allows evil to flourish. Trump thanks you for your support. The kids in cages and 150,000 COVID dead, not so much.
Social media giants pull viral video shared by Trump with false coronavirus claims
This coming from a Trump supporter.🤣😂🤣😂
Both. It's so rare that it's essentially nonexistent, and you oversimplified the case out of New Jersey.
trump actually uttered these words about John Lewis in 2017: he is "all talk...no action"  During CRM, Lewis was one of the "Freedom Riders" who rode interstate buses into the segregated south.   He Got arrested. Got fire bombed. Got his head bashed in.  "all talk...no action"
That's oversimplifying what happened.
Says the Trump supporter.😂🤣
I wouldn't call getting Trump out of office "throwing my vote away."
If ur voting for Biden or Trump, u r tripping
Yep,  banned pro-Trump posts, not people.  Because fcking racism and white nationalism.  Trump is a white nationalist.  This ban in the context of BIPOC knitters finally standing up to be counted and included.  Amen.
So you ensure that Trump wins in November. I don't like Biden either, but when we have a "president" as incompetent as Trump, this is not the time to risk four more years of him just because Biden isn't the best candidate.
No it's not. It would simply siphon votes from Biden and ensure Trump wins a second term, which would be FAR worse than a Joe Biden presidency.
Mark it sounds like you agree with what President Trump has been saying about manufacturing in this country.
Because Rep Lewis was African American and was well respected  something Trump will never be

The police are rioting. American citizens are peacefully protesting. The entire Trump administration has been gaslighting this nation for 4 years.
All banding together to keep people from knowing they helped those rogue FBI agents set up the president Donal Trump and I'm am living proof and most of thier technology is fake lol
El presidente requested it.   The wolf his subordinate says by shooting and kidnapping people off the street this will subdue and stop the protests.   See how that's working for them.  More and more people are seeing Trump for what he is.
So is trump going to denounce the fda now that they have found hydroxycloroquine isn’t a safe/effective treatment against covid?
Well said, Judge Pirro!  I'm not a Trump supporter however; I'll take Trump any day over Biden as I don't want to return to the Obama years nor do I believe that Biden is Presidential material.

Trump again pushes unproven drug as COVID-19 treatment
Trump falsely promotes hydroxychloroquine as a cure and encourages not wearing masks. Both harm people.  Encourage your friends and family to wear a mask to protect themselves; avoid taking the above drug because it has no benefits in treating COVID-19.
In a nutshell, right here...who this fool really is.  Trump Announced, Then Canceled, a Yankees Pitch. Both Came as a Surprise.
JUST IN: Twitter says a video tweeted by Donald Trump Jr. violated the company's policies on coronavirus misinformation. His account is now being limited.

Sorry can't be around sheep. Im allergic. Changing my name would not mean what it does to me.   I voted primarily Republican till Trump  I didn't not and would not vote for him.  But then I knew Nixon was guilty too.

Trump loves nazies
Not to mention the number of people that died before Trump admitted covid existed or the numbers Republicans Gov hid to make Trump happy.
Uh he HAS worked with your boy! Typical tRUMP fan to get his panties in a bunch! 🤡
It's a step for facism Hilter did the same as I know that are familiar with this To build the military is the fifth step Trump is using the military against protestors This scares the hell out of me
I just realized it was a female hurricane.   Really sucks for trump
If they wouldn't infect the rest of us, I would hope that all Trump supporters would get Covid. Let them boil their brains in 103 degree temps and gasp for air. We'll wait to hear about how harmless the whole thing is.

They aren't riots, they are mostly peaceful protests with isolated incidents. And I use the "mainstream" media because they aren't worshiping Trump the same way some far right media do. And your question is a nonstarter because the media would NEVER call BLM terrorists.

No. Trump is a fascist who is openly and proudly doing fascism and Biden would...presumably not do that.   But both parties ultimately serve the same capitalist interests, and it is ultimately those capitalist interests that need to be defeated. And you can't do that by voting.

And Gaga’s family supports trump with her money
Trump is telling us he believes a woman's place is in the home- serving their husbands and raising the children.
I know you re going to hit the door ready to clean up this horrible mess Trump has created . I trust you will pick the best people to help you do that  I know you will. Only the Best can straighten out this mess
Yep. 4 at most. Any song he plays Rakim can trump it.
It's crystal clear she was installed for a reason. And covid was a big gift to her &amp; Trump in their plot to defund public schools &amp; privatize education. Trump had the Putin playbook well in advance of election and he knew who to put in key positions.
This is how the press should handle Trump now...stop the bullsh*t...confront him head on...call him on his sh*t...always
I think Putin has ordered Trump to call him every week and Putin tells him what to say.
I don't know anymore. Trump is using goons to tear gas and arrest peaceful protesters he calls "radical left mobs" then uses the footage for  propaganda videos. He can't be winning new voters right? Right?! Why do I feel like we're always one step behind this a**hole?
They want parents and teachers back to work so Trump's job numbers are better by election time. They don't care if kids get sick or die.
The bigger crime is you still getting away corruption and the 140+ covid#19 deaths. You should be ashamed  Karma! Baby, karma. Mr. Trump virus!
I will give Trump credit in that he has exposed a lot of folks for what they are. I've lost friendships and I'm not as bummed as I thought I would be.
I will not accept the outcome of the election if Donald Trump wins. #riggedagain

Trump likes Jack's Pizza
The owner of one of the franchises and the head coach of one of the others in your state think Trump is an idiot and are voting for Biden. You’re (again) on the wrong side of history. And your governor’s doing a shitty job on COVID 19. #coronavirus #GOPCorruptionOverCountry
lol saw a video matching up an old Trump first pitch and the video turned fauci on his side and the ball hit the ground at the same spot trump's did. Was funny stuff.
The only thing that stopped Trump's ball from reaching Hell was the ground.

President Trump announced he will send federal agents to Chicago and Albuquerque, New Mexico, expanding the administration’s intervention into local enforcement as he runs for reelection under a “law and order” mantle.
Donald Trump Joshua is coming in the room with me an I'm going use r pans
A collection of Chicago activist groups want a judge to block federal agents sent by President Trump from interfering in or policing protests, arguing in a lawsuit that the surge will inhibit residents' ability to hold demonstrations.
A judge ordered the release from prison, saying he believes the government retaliated against Cohen for writing a book about President Trump.
Please don't blame so much of what Trump is on his biggoted father. Many abused children grow up to be great people. Regardless of a man's up bringing, he can plow his on path. Donald is what he is because he chooses to be.
Again Megan, attacking Mary Trump, you keep talking to her about her cousin's, let her talk and stop taking over the conforsation, who cares that u don't believe her million of people do. So have a seat Megan.

And Trump looked absolutely pathetic while doing so ...the bar is so f*cking low for this guy
Ironic how Trump now cares about the seriousness of #COVID19. He downplayed it for months until some of the red states started getting hammered. #TrumpVirus #TrumpIsARacist #TrumpFailedAmericaI parked my car in trump towers fucking clown😂
just remembered trump said earliy on he would rathe resign than have he taxes made public
- supports Trump
Trump’s destruction  of the democracy is scary- the complacency of the Republicans in Congress is just as DEPLORABLE
I’m going to put exactly that in my will. “Obama is invited and can say whatever he feels like. Trump is not invited”. Every american should add that.
what’s the game plan when trump tries to challenge the election results? I truly hope the campaign is scenario planning because you just know he’s gonna try something.
Voters hear and understand this. Contrary to what Trump is saying and lying about:  There is NO difference between Absentee voting and Mail-in voting.  It is the same thing!!!! Pass it on.
I agree. That doesn't mean Trump isn't hoping for it.
Trump turns everything in trash Would you look at this. You cannot make this ish up #TrumpIsALaughingStock #trumpturnseverythingintotrash Straight garbage #ObamaWasBetterAtEverything

Postal employees and union officials say recent changes implemented by Postmaster General Louis DeJoy, a major donor to President Trump and the GOP, have led to days-long delays in mail delivery across the country.
I love that you’re upset with Trump but please take time to acknowledge how wrong you were on President Obama countless times. You added to the unnecessary stress caused by journalists looking for attention. Repent.
You mean for government to create more incentive for startups and entrepreneurship.  I don't see argument here, I think there's general concensus among most people that this is what is supposed to be happening.  In fact that is what Trump administration trying to do.
Funny how at the same time the Trump began running ads about cities being overrun by violent left-wing mobs suggests to me that he is motivated by the optics of the response than its potential effectiveness.  Btw the name calling is the new low for the GOP-- thank Trump.
I thought he caught the Coronavirus from Trump’s own droplets

why? Are we rewarding ignorance now?  He went to a rally #maskless, he was over 70 &amp; had underlying illnesses.    Are we rewarding him for being brave enough to die so  Trump could stick it to Science?  If so that didn't work so  remind me why we're rewarding him?
When one of the co-founders of the #FederalistSociety calls Trump a fascist, you know you're in uncharted territory.
Yeah. A lot of people fell for Trump's con
Trump Might Try to Postpone the Election. That’s Unconstitutional.
Is it though Lady G?!?! Sounds like to me we actually have judges who follow the Rule of Law! It's clear you dont because if you did you wouldn't be all the way up Trump's ass! November you will be voted out!
The Great Trump Diseaster #TrumpIsACompleteFailure
People were subject to state mandates, not Trump's advice. Also his administration did advise those things. The media and Twitter libs should be to blame for creating a political divide by screaming at everything he suggests, even if he's right.

Trump ain’t gonna kill my Obama buzz  #TrumpPresser
I am listening to trump rn. Let me get this straight. Young people won’t die from it so it’s OK if they get it, and a lot of old people have been dying, but they were super old anyway!!! very compelling.
This didn't age well #Trump
George W. Bush, Bill Clinton and Barack Obama were all there but you know who wasn't? That's right, Donald Trump

So who trusts their children with Trump’s opening of schools?
Donald Trump is the world’s worst public reader. And I say reader not speaker because when he reads it’s literally 😴😴😴🥱🥱.
However, Calabresi added, agreeing with Trump on this would not disqualify someone from being a Supreme Court or Court of Appeals justice, and, in fact, only enhance their qualifications.

I don't think they'll vote for Trump. I think they'll refuse to vote at all, which is effectively the same thing.
On top of all the tweets from #45 about how Biden is a puppet of the "Radical Left," I've also been seeing tweets saying this election is "really" Trump vs. Obama, Trump vs. China. I think #45's party has realized they can't win against Biden.
Lets move to Canada if trump gets re-elected
Must be backwards day at EPA! We know the truth, Andy.
Is been a long 3 years of being told what Trump won't do and then watching him do that exact thing.  Excuse my skepticism that 'it's just talk.'
not going to be hard on the "how Trump might quit" piece, it's a classic "I don't have any ideas this week" submission
He stupidly attended a rally in Tulsa w/o a mask.    He and the other "Blacks for Trump" wanted to prove a point and they did.  They proved #COVID19 is real and it can kill.
#KAG2020 are some ignorant people that don't believe in Science, instead they worship Trump.  They won't wear mask they would rather die in support of Trump like Herman Cain.   Trump promotes miracle cures &amp; witch doctors that appeal to the ignorant.     Judgement day 2020
If trump knew how to fix america why in the hell are there 150K dead, record unemployment, bursting debt.    WE could have fixed this with rapid testing, contact tracing and wearing mask.    The only way we save America is to dump the dunce.
trump is not up his shakespeare i bet
Barack Obama had more religion in his arse than trump has in his entire body and yet your hate Obama and love Trump.  That's why i'm denouncing Catholicism, it's just a racist cult filled with birthers.

Is Trump going to get away with Housing Discrimination? Will people allow him to? That is Pure Racism and I hope he can't get away with it.
Why do all the Jews support democrats? Trump has done more for Israel than any other President. Biden is Catholic not a big Jew supporter. Blacks hate Jews, his VP will be black. Wake up Jews vote Trump!
If there is a video of trump with an under age girl it would erase all support for him.
And yet he died for nothing like the 150,000 other people. Please don't wear a mask sir, trump will protect you maybe

Well, how effective was that, really? Lmao! Trump running everything.
Yall ! Why did Trump try to include funding for the FBI headquarters by his hotel in the next stimulus package ? Both the republicans and the Democrats asked him “ What does the fbi headquarters have to do with the Coronavirus ? “🤣 like foo you tryna finesse the government too?
To make President Trump look bad,and blame him to try and ruin the re election.Demorats help spread it through Fauci.
Doesn't this happen all the time? Trump tweets something. The GOP says "You fucking idiots it was CLEARLY a joke and HE GOT YOU." and then Trump is interviewed and he says "it wasn't a joke and I am issuing an executive order that says NO JOKE DO THE THING."
I wasn’t expecting Trump to attend but it was tacky &amp; petty for the White House not to send any representation.  #JohnLewisMemorial

Gurl you support Trump. You have already sold your sold your soul.
Learned this during Obama’s second term when I realized he could easily avoid doing the work if he placed blame for the work not being done solely on his opponents. Same playbook Trump is using today and Biden will use if he wins.
Trump is the kid who would reset the Nintendo when he was losing.
Mr. Turley:  Joe Biden did nothing more than predict EXACTLY what is happening.  Trump wants to postpone the election.  Whether he can or not is irrelevant; even proposing it is yet another step towards authoritarianism.  You should apologize.
Trump been on a Dick Flute solo victory lap for 3.5 years
White racist cops for Trump  fixed it.
I'm SUPER looking forward to your tweet apologizing to Joe Biden and condemning Trump for doing EXACTLY the opposite of what you said.  Can't wait.
It might seem counterintuitive but for my sanity I have to assume Trump will win. I can’t be surprised by that again.  Intellectually and objectively it is FAR more likely Biden will.
The CDC recommended wearing masks in March but apparently you were listening to Trump and his minions.

Buried with trump and his followers
The only consistent position the Resistance has is to disagree with whatever Trump says, regardless of context.  Still just wish he'd pull the ultimate move and talk up breathing. I have to wonder how many people that would actually end up killing.
I am pretty ignorant of economics but it seems to me that Trump and his enablers have been all about the short term. Trump wants his definition of a strong economy for the duration of his term. He has never seemed concerned with the long term or for sustained prosperity.
The worst that’s why trump is in White House. What a fuck up has nothing better to do. Don’t we know by now
Thank you,  - fight the Trump fascism at every turn!

Read the article. Look at the research timing.  Look at the numbers. Consider what your post was trying to do. Then, you will understand my response.  At the end of the day, the VAST majority of us CANNOT STAND TRUMP.
Fun presidential line of succession scenario: If Trump delays the Presidential election past Jan 20 and California still holds their elections then  gets to be President.
I’m honestly dumbfounded by the way 35% of the American population is so stupid, yes I said “STUPID”. We call ourself a progressive educated country? But yet 35%? 20,000+ lies. 3+ years of absolutely nothing done by Trump (LEGALY) and 150,000+ Americans murdered still supporting
Think about this for one second: IF Trump DOES manage to delay the election wouldn't it just make it MORE likely that he will get trounced when we're finally able to vote? Could be the best thing to ever happen since the ratification of the 23rd amendment.

Like Trump, he wasn’t the right man to be president.  For those who claim they “don’t see color” here’s a chance to put that in practice.  And the “b” in Black is uppercase.  What was he doing maskless + not socially distant in a room full of maskless people at the Tulsa rally?
It’s only kinda funny to see that black trump supporting ass nigga. But he old asl to be this
WATCH: Trump fumes at CNN after being confronted for promoting doctor who believes in ‘demon seed’
Trump is getting his people in line to delay the election. Time to wake up, folks.
Ain’t he get it from the Trump rally? Well....
Who didn’t see this coming?
Donald Trump has very little experience solving problems. He is better at framing what happened in a way that he can move forward
I can only assume but most other people would probably used the pandemic playbook developed by previous administration and the experience of the team of experts put together that Trump dismissed. But again, at this point we can only assume
How many more people like #HermanCain will throw themselves on the #Trump #MAGA #GOPDeathCult funeral pyre?
I am WAITING to see what Trump has to say.
Trump yesterday announced he would be withdrawing 12,000 troops from Germany.   Hmm. Sounds to me like an installment payment to Putin for election interference. #RememberInNovember #TraitorTrump
I can teach you how to google. But in the meantime here is an elaborate description of why your statement is mostly false
If  has a COVID briefing today someone ask him if he feels responsible for the passing of Herman Cain who he attended his Tulsa rally. Trump was still of the belief no one needed masks/ the virus was going to disappear. The only thing disappearing are lives.
His ass shoulda stayed home from that Trump rally
Herman Cain basically sacrificed himself to be one of Trump’s tokens and you know Donald dgaf about him dying.
Donald Trump surrogate  is dead of #COVID19, what a dumb fool.
Good job covid. Do trump next.
From your lips to gods ears. We need a high profile trump to die of covid. I’ll take any of them. Karma cmon.
The left is weaponizing Herman Cain’s death. They’re using the death of a recent cancer survivor with COVID-19 to push people to wear masks &amp; hurt Trump.  It’s quite sad that their hate for Trump is greater than their basic care for humanity.  They’re soulless! They’re pure evil!
Glad he is dead.  He deserved Covid. Hope trump contracts it next.

Trump can't really articulate a smart sentence to save his life &amp; he's not for the subtlety of dog whistles. That's why he'll probably lose, he really bull in a China shop-ed his way into power but doesn't have the creativity to anything with the rubble. He has blackmail, I guess

Trump doesn’t even have to do anything obvious to delay the election this right here is a hell of a tactic. Oh you’re voting by mail? Bye bye usps
Great  Whatever Trump wants the Demnuts are against! Using "Brear Rabbit" against the Demnuts works!
4 states have done this for a long time. It works very well for them. Most states allow mail-in voting with no excuse. It has worked well for them. Trump is afraid he will lose the election and suddenly it's an issue?
The Trump campaign is actually promoting mail-in voting
Trump : it’s too dangerous for the American people to vote   Also Trump: we have to send teachers and kids to school in the middle of a pandemic
So it’s now confirmed Trump is sending in federal goons to stamp out protesters and dissent, not “crime”. He told Gov. of Oregon he would pull the goons out of Portland only when they “clamp down on the protesters”. #GestapoTrump
Herman Cain, former GOP presidential candidate, dies after battle with coronavirus Kane was supporting Trump's wishes of not wearing a mask and going to these rallies with no social distance between a 10 days. Because of trump he is dead
Trump IS STILL going to fundraising events while not social distancing and his fans still doing the same. Unless Trumpsters are living in a bubble, they know how many in this country are ill and have died from Covid-19. Why are these people risking their lives?
Person. Women. Man. Fuck. Trump.  #wewillvote
There have been many.

About catching it at a Trump rally
GOP Rep Louie Gohmert from Texas, a mask averter, finally wore one but just tested positive before jumping on a plane with Trump. He informed his staff of his diagnosis while NOT wearing a mask &amp; then blamed his mask for having germs. Anyone wonder why the US in tops in Covis-19?
I told yall trump was gonna hold the united States hostage
THE BEST THING YOU CAN DO NOW TRUMP IS TO FABRICATE A COMFY STORY AND RESIGN USING YOUR STORY AS THE BACKDROP! YOU GRACEFULLY (?) BOW OUT &amp; GO AWAY. OR STAY TILL ELECTION AND BE LAUGHED AT &amp; TOTALLY HUMILIATED!!🤣🤣😂
When will Trump comment on this?
🤣😂😭😂🤣 they forgot to add that he got it after attending Trump's Tulsa rally and he bragged about not wearing a mask. Killing yourself to own the libs! You love to see it!
everyone who is like “trump can’t stop the election bc that’s illegal” wtf are you talking about he does whatever he wants and no one stops him who tf is gonna stop him, his military that is throwing citizens into prison for no reasons? his judges?
Trump is radicalizing his supporters to revolt if he loses by conspiracy driven propaganda and he’s telegraphing trying to maintain power in any way he can. He’s long ago proven he should he is no longer fit to serve
do it president Trump. Make it illegal for them to send in votes by mail. these people are all cowards and their atheist number to try to destroy America again like they have.
The thought of risking your life to see Trump do a bit about walking down a ramp for 15 minutes, and it winding up being one of the last things you do in your life is very depressing.
Yes, indeed. I'm not the biggest Biden fan, but I'm voting for a return to some semblance of normalcy, then a new generation can take over in 4 years. I don't think the country can take 4 more years of Trump. It's tiring. And I felt that way before the craziness of 2020.
delay the election then. I just got some stupid democratic piece of paper in the mail saying you can mail in your vote. President Trump I don't accept anything except you being our President for the next four years. we cannot have these atheist back.They will destroy America.
Better Trump then him. At least Cain had principles, as bizarre as they were. And he was a man of God.
Herman Cain is a death directly related to Trump and his selfish desires to hold rallies in a vicious pandemic.
Donald Trump should resign or be removed. Pass it on.
Remember when y’all tried to impeach trump and failed miserably? Lmao!
Sadly Herman Cain, a trump supporter who attended the Tulsa rally without a mask has passed away from Covid-19.  Will Trump feel any guilt that his friend died because HE decided mask wearing and social distancing wasn’t important at his rally, essentially killed his friend?
THE SENATE REPUBLICANS WHO ACQUITTED THE GUILTY TRUMP “MUST BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR VIOLATING THEIR OATHS!” THE REPUBLICANS FORGET THAT WE WOULDN’TBE ON THIS DEEP A MESS IF THEY WOULD’VE CONVICTED TRUMP INSTEAD OF SUCKING HIS ....! TRUMP CORRUPTED REPS &amp; YOUR REPUTATION’S GONE!
Maybe if trump tried to give healthcare to the poor.  Republicans hate helping out the poor
TRUMP &amp; HIS CORRUPT REPUBLICANS MUST STOP BLAMING OTHER COUNTRIES FOR A PANDEMIC THAT AFFECTED THE ENTIRE WORLD, AS AN ATTACK ON HIM &amp; AMERICA. TRUMP IS SAYING “I TAKE NO RESPONSIBILITY AT ALL!” EVERY COUNTRY IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THEIR OWN RIGHT NOW! DO SOMETHING COWARDS!
The real reason for Trump's election Tweet. Stay focused.
TRUMP TWEETS HE WANTS TO FUCK W/THE ELECTION BECAUSE SAFETY &amp; MAIL FRAUD. However, it’s *safe* to send kids to school in groups indoors for hours/day &amp; mail-in voting has been successful since the Civil War. So I call BULLSHIT on these fabricated concerns.
Y’all need to stop thinking Trump “can’t do that” we thought he couldn’t win , we thought he couldn’t end DACA , we thought he couldn’t send the feds , we thought he couldn’t put kids in camps and separate them from their parents and he DID do all of those things !
Fuck THAT WET WANT YOU GONE ! WE WILL VOTE BY ANY MEANS NECESSARY TO RID THIS COUNTRY OF THE TRUMP PLAGUE! #coronavirus #liarinchief #crookeddonald #corruptedinchief #racistinchief #liarinchief #lockhimup #donthecon #fraud45 #Trea45on #traitors  #illegitimatepresident
“Trump suggests delay in election which is illegal under the constitution and for which he has no authority”.  I fixed it for you. Change that headline!
Trump loves to say “this is good, I did this” and “this is bad, someone else did this” but never seems to have details as to WHY something is good or bad. Taking prescriptive language at face value from an authority figure is dangerous and misleads entire populations.
*Quelle suprise* in 2016 “initially seemed Mr. Trump was merely seeking an early scapegoat for a possible loss, his language had taken a darker turn.”
He also said 2016 was rigged here

Vote Trump away.  For the good of our country, please vote anyway you can.
Do people assuring us of what Trump can't do remember the con. crisis of Boris Johnson closing the British Parliament so that he could force his version of #Brexit , like yesterday? Their courts struck his move down. Do you believe our SC would do the same in crisis to Trump?
I’d be more comforted by this if the Trump administration wasn’t actively defying the United States Supreme Court’s holding on DACA. The rule of law means nothing to Trump and the GOP.
Trump is suggesting we delay the election. I was hoping we could speed it up!
should at the minimum flag  ‘s false tweet but  really should suspend Trump like they suspended  for spreading lies and false claims.
There’s A Major Scandal Brewing In Trump’s Kodak Pharmaceutical AwardTrump wants to know election results the night of the election because Republicans have figured out how to manipulate electronic voting booths. In 2020 we expect an accurate count and a day or two doesn’t make a lot of difference with mail in ballots that are sent a week early.
I am asking that we have a new segment on "The New Abnormal" called "Really Dumb Guy/Girl OR Smart Dumb Guy/Girl where you separate the various Trump clan lackies, toadies, lickspittles and demon-spawn into one of the two categories.
Where's trump on this bs
Damn what did he show you? He’s shown me a lot of bad shit like war And human trafficking... hope that’s not gods doing.... he’s in control right. 😭😭😭😭 god haves us trump too and about to get 4 more years. That’s gods will too?
If it was real Putin would see this as an opportunity, not a threat. Trump must be really, really worried.
Like a real man, someone with integrity and who understands the importance of participating in proper health precautions should.   Good example, #Obama.    Unlike  #Trump, who, you know, is an idiot.   A #COVIDIOT.

The Reason Trump’s a Monster – Markin Report
Who asked you? And trump did a mock election using mail ins and some of the votes got lost. Please educate yourself bc you don’t know if all the votes go in.
Trump had it right 4 months ago when he stated if we left it up to the medical people, we would be on lockdown for 3 yrs. They have no concept of the negative ramifications caused by the lockdowns.  They are focused solely on eliminating the virus, at alll costs.  Not practical.
You wouldn’t have to say Hillary Clinton’s name either, you might remember when she called Trump supporters deplorables
this is not a matter of spineless or fake news, for Trump it is a matter of deep loyalty and allegiance to his country of origins, Russia, and his Creed, which is exactly that of Putin, Judaism.
You believe that. Don’t mean it’s true. And that’s my point. You haven’t see he/she. So you don’t know. And if god is always in control like y’all love to say, then god gave y’all Donald Trump! Gotta love it 😂
Hello. I have a question for you and other TSB members. I live with my sister in the western suburbs of Chicago. We want to get involved in defeating Trump, but aren’t sure how - especially given our various physical limitations. Suggestions?
Probably worse than Arnold, who tried (and failed) to sell surrender of Fort Arnold/Fort Clinton to the British for £20,000. Trump has profited from his presidency and successfully killed many whilst demolishing the country's reputation.
Sorry this wonderful person had to die because of trump's weak leadership.  Everyone needs to listen to the experts and stop listening to the orange bafoon in our white house!
On November 3rd, #WeWillVote as scheduled. Any delay of any kind is unconstitutional! Trump is a disgrace to the human race! I've heard of chimpanzees being smart. I think they would beat Trump in the cognitive test. #TrumpleThinSkin
If Trump supports it, it has to suck
Donald Trump should resign. Pass it on.
Even if its not Trump's  FAULT he absolutely did next to NOTHING to make it better.
They won’t be able to blame the mask wearing since he didn’t wear one... I wonder if this will change Trump’s tune? Oh yeah, right, he doesn’t give a shit about anyone but himself. Not even his “friends.”
He got jealous that Trump got all the attention for bad hair.
Another Russian tactic. When is Trump going to realize Russia is making a fool out of him?
That’s cause his “base” is “Jim Jonesed” They will follow Trump into Hell.
Give it a freaking rest.  What about all the kids still in cages?  What about Trump not having a Federal COVID plan?  What about the Russian bounties?  Or Barr lying to Congress?  Let’s get up to date in political scandals.
I’m trashing hydroxy... because it doesn’t work for COVID, and trashing Trump because he can’t admit it. Did he buy stock in (or take a “donation” from) a company that makes it or owns a lot of it?

Trump is, yes

Bothe Trump and Senator Kennedy trigger my gag reflex.
A nursing home gave over 200 residents hydroxychloroquine without state health department approval. People, this is why Trump should keep his mouth shut about a drug he knows NOTHING about. This is a perfect reason if someone taking his I’ll-advises advice
They never invited him Claudia just smother Lie ?!!!! Review the tape Mariano looked like he was going to throw up HAD NO IDEA what trump was talking about
Trump said he talked to Putin on the phone a week ago or so, oh boy, now that Mueller and Comy and Barr, and Pelosi, and, and …… protected him he is becoming brazen about Putin's total influence on him.
Pretty sure  was perfectly fine before Trump, and will continue to be fine after Trump in the years to come, either 2021 or 2025.
And why is Trump sitting in the photo when it appears there is one woman in the room? Must be the bone spurs acting up or his wacky delusion of grandeur.
How many points do you think Biden's VP choice could swing his current lead over Trump in either direction?  Is 5 % points in play here, given this will likely be the defacto Dem nominee in 2024? #ithinkthatsright
Good point.  But I don't think the debates will happen.  I think Trump hinted last year he wanted no part of the debates, and will come up with outrageous demands in order to weasel out of them.
President Trump please help your people as you say and demand the use of HCQ for treatment of covid 19.
Democrats are nothing but commies! Socialism is communism bastard's son. Wake up America! #KAG2020 #Trump2020  #Trump

If Trump loses He will leave office. President Trump hasn’t violated the Constitution in his 4 years in office. It’s impossible for a President to stay in office after his term is over. He has no power, he can’t order anybody to do anything, this is just a lie pushed by Leftists.

Oh FFS the whole world is in on it to dis trump?  WTAF
Mr Trump these protesters and looters and anarchists are nothing more than terrorist. If we were under attack by any other country. You would send an army to cut them down with real ammo. Do what needs to be done. Quite sugar footing and cut these worthless pieces of human flesh

Strange thing for the Reagan Foundation to ask, since Trump is Reagan’s legacy.
You mean the Democratic virus! You know, the one you control! Like how People attending Trump’s rallies were high risk for covid, but not protesters standing on top of each other. Also how the DNC will be having a rally soon but no one attending that will be high risk. Stupid!

Ron Fournier is greatly disturbed that the electorate chose a salesman as President. Trump is not an elitist, he doesn’t sympathize with Marxist as Ron does, he doesn’t belong to the right clubs or go to the right cocktail parties, so Ron is scandalized.

Had someone comment recently that they had trouble understanding my mixture of posts about the police, the protests, and the Trump/federal response. Having married into a family with many Chicago police I know they are mainly just folks trying to do their job.

I’m sorry Trump sent who to Chicago???
You know the secret police he is sending will not be working on the gang problems. They will be abusing and detaining protesters and provoking protesters so Trump can get campaign video.
Im done. Im sorry. I just am scared as fuck of "But her emails 2020" and you know what it means very little to me anyway. I am a 54 year old rich, white, hetero man whose life will be little affected by Trump winning again.
I was talking about what I see today.  Not because of Biden. Because of media and Trump. I dont care about Biden.
Charlotte I have followed u 4 a long time. I just looked at your tweets for today and see tweets about a incorrect statement about the history of US presidents. Yet I dont see any about Trump and Barr sending secret police to our cities. It was a quick look and I could be wrong.
Its like this. In 2016 Trump would say awful thing after awful thing and media would say "But her emails".
Come November 4th rip him to shreds.  Hell come January 21st let him drop dead. Its like people saying he stumbles when he talks and ignoring Trump rambles on incoherently and forgets for minutes on end that his wife is next to him and he apologizes for her not being with him.
Yes Charlotte you are correct Biden was wrong he wasnt the 1st. Now can you get Jake Tapper and the like to talk more about Trump sending secret police into our cities.
Cancel me I guess because I believe Trump is orders of magnitudes worse.
I mean people are getting bent out of shape he said "Trump is 1st racist president" rather then cheering him on that he isnt afraid to say "Trump is a racist president".
THERE IS NO NEW TONE just liked this and it is a perfect example for the media. The media has gone on and on about Trump's new tone yesterday. We dont need them going on and on doing a "Joe, but actually".
I wont say anything about that last comment other then that is a silly thing to even think. I simply dont want media to dwell on the comment rather then secret police going into our cities creating chaos and giving media for Trump advertisements.
No. Its just a silly thing to put wind under the wings.  Lets live in the modern era. Not an era where like 90% of white people were racist. So of course Trump isnt the 1st racist president. Worry about #GestapoTrump not a technically incorrect comment.
Ding, ding, ding someone gets it. We dont need to let the media create another D E P L O R A B L E S for Trump and his supporters to exploit.
Just being snarky because of people getting up in arms about Biden calling Trump the 1st racist president.
Yeah but Joe Biden called Trump the 1st racist president
Just letting you know #MTPDaily I and many other will turn you off as soon as you put Trump on. Dont broadcast live. Cut to him if something important is being said. Dont be his propaganda network.
meanwhile Trump is sending Secret Police to cities and people are going "Joe, but actually". You know what he meant.
Yes and if media lets him Trump will try to make this a D e p l o r a b l e s moment

This is the truth. It’s just the media is paying attention, they think it’s connected to BLM or they want to blame Trump but Chicago’s always been a violent place
Lets be honest as well Trump goon squads wont go to those neighborhoods and try to stop violence. They will go to wear protesters are and abuse and detain them.

Well said, Annette! I got a Twitter account as a blood pressure lowering device. With Trump out of office, I’m not worried about national safety, mass death and starvation. I’ll drop it when Biden wins.
I know!  She’s as good as that Anthony guy that “worships” Trump. It’s awesome. 😂
Does he need to? Trump can’t even see his feet.
“And they say, the disinfectant. Can we inject it? Or the light in the body...” Has  gotten a injection of that alien blood, yet?
The magic virus fairies weren't able to use their pixie dust to destroy the Covid because Trump didn't order the US Military to imprison people in their homes at gunpoint and shoot them dead if they were out walking their dog or jogging in March.  Duh..  sarc//
You'll need pictures for Trump.... remember, he doesn't read much.
This is a damning portrait of the (lack of) federal government response to this threat. Some things are of large enough scope that only the US Gov. can address them -this was one, and Trump dropped the ball. Bigly. The election is a referendum on that failure.
These "stories" are only coming from Trump, so they can easily be dismissed as not credible.
This "joke" simply isn't funny. Maybe Russian bounties on US troops is also funny to Trump and Cornyn - they certainly don't seem to be taking it seriously!!
You’re right Joe Biden will try to get out of having any debate with Donald Trump. We the people want to have these debates move forward so we can make a choice based on what we hear
When I eulogized my father back in 2009, I talked about:  - gerrymandering - making Puerto Rico a state - making Washington D.C. a state - my children - how great a president I was - how much I couldn't stand Trump
Someone tweeted that trump has a 43% approval rating from blacks.
"Why wasn't Trump at John Lewis's funeral? He must be racist!"  That's a take I just saw on Facebook.  Remind me to stay off of Facebook.
Trump does not and never has had a 43% approval rating from blacks. Never.
Numerous polling places have been eliminated making it more difficult to vote. At the same time trump is attempting to stop mail in voting during a pandemic while he himself (and his family) have voted by mail.
Don’t fear Trump’s feeble attempts to delay the election and not accept a loss.. Embrace it and watch how our constitution works
#Kodak stock soared after the Trump administration announced that the company will be transformed into a pharmaceutical producer.  Prof. Matthew Lyle is available to comment on the impact of this move.
That’s what they do when it supports their desired narrative, such as any one or combination of the following: -wear a face mask or you’ll die; -Trump rallies need to end; -Trump killed Cain; -Trump is orange man bad; -Yada, Yada, Yada. Even a kid like me can see thru this scam.
She’s a trump appointee. Or was that a rhetorical question?
Terrible you used a funeral to go after Trump.
That's trump and Epstein. 13 yrs old. Maxwell has receipts.
Who do you think would deliver Trump's eulogy?
...and Trump deleted it.  Sad
Without a general election, she’d be in the same boat as Trump.  Her term ends on January 3, so she would need to be somehow re-elected before then.
Trump is a survivor. We underestimate him at our own peril.   Fight.
I didn't know this new source existed. THANK YOU! This is really interesting. Trump can't fund his paramilitary forces in the cities without this boost, I'm assuming.

Watch this - DHS funding is funding Trump's paramilitary operations
It didn't happen all at once. Take your pick: Jan 21, 2010, SCOTUS decides Citizens United Jun 25, 2013, SCOTUS decides Shelby V. Holder Feb 13, 2016, McConnell won't consider any Obama SCOTUS nominee Nov 8th, 2016, Trump election  Feb 5, 2020, Trump Senate acquittal
Or they would have before Trump appointees.
I find neither Trump nor Cornyn the least bit funny. They're shameful and embarrassing to our country.
"I assumed it was unthinkable."  Trump is going to do 100 more "unthinkable" things between now and January. Hopefully you now realize that we are dealing with an actual fascist, and you stop thinking that there is ANYTHING he will not do for power.
Trump is suppose to comfort our nation when he does his press conferences about the pandemic. He lies about it. He talks about how great he is. And he cry’s like a baby because Faci has a higher approval than him.
this is what happens when you consider your loyalty to trump more important than your own health. i would wish him peace, but i don't know what happen to trumpsters on the other side.
Who died because of the trump rally.
How are you surprised that the GDP drops when you shut down the economy?? Please tell how it could have been avoided?? You just make unqualified statements. Ok I will make one. The drop in GDP would have been worse if Trump wasn’t president. And the GDP will improve if he stays.

Donald Trump should resign. Pass it on.
Did he say he’s better than trump again?
Well...I can’t really object to Trump trying to kill off his own voters.
Just imagine trying to be a political refugee fleeing America after Trump wins again.
Government watchdog finds 'strong indicators of widespread fraud' in the $60 billion small busine...  via  with trump’s oversight what else would you expect?
Trump would most likely get impeached before that if he canceled the election - that might be a bridge too far for GOP enablers who put loyalty to Trump over country
I totally hear that. I just have a hard time shaming marginalized folks for not having faith in a voting system that has hurt them in many ways. But I also agree trump is directly hurting people too. It’s really a tough situation
It had better specifically call Trump all the things that you said Biden was calling him.  I look forward to you applying to the President the phrases "disloyal wannabe dictator," "evil and intent on destroying America," "un-American," and "traitorous intent."
There is no changing the minds of Trump supporters or Q-idiots. Our only hope in winning is getting independents to step up and vote and for all democrats to vote. Our numbers are way larger, but we need to stay energized. I just like to mess with them.
Trump could not speak like Bush or Clinton or Obama !  Trump is a joke
Doesn't take a rocket scientist to understand trump plays the media, or figure out the timing of his "press conference" during Obama's eulogy
But it’s safe to send kids back to school?  Is being beaten soundly &amp; this is a pathetic display of trying to change the rules because it’s not going his way. Trump is weak &amp; disgustingly unpresidential. Sad.   We must crush trump! #BlueLandslide2020  #TrumpsLies
He only kicked him out after they had a property dispute, Trump was totally fine with underage girls. Look it up, he was charged with rape of a 14 year old girl. And I thought you Q idiots were banned from Twitter.
Trump’s black support dropped by 50% with the passing of Cain
Trump’s black support was reduced by 50% with the passing of Cain
Give me ranked choice. Give me popular vote over Electoral College. But give me a Trump defeat in November, and only one vote does that.
Exactly! Ask Herman Cain....whoops, nevermind. BTW  , Mary Trump said your father-in-law didn't know who you were until you blew smoke up his ass at the rep convention. I've heard of bad in law stories, that ranks in the top 3.
I'm just saying if mental lucidity is the criterion, Trump has no claim to it either. It's Spiderman pointing at Spiderman. Will I be way more concerned about his VP choice than I was about Hillary's or Obama's? You bet.
Yes they are the same thing. Absentee is for people who might serve oversees or be otherwise unavailable whereas mail in is more convenience. Either way they use the same thing. Trump mailed in his vote for the Florida primaries this year
I agree with the racist part, not idiot. *45, &amp; every minion he put in place know very well what they're doing, how to do it &amp; how to get away with it. And, it's working. "Pausing" the election, abolishing the post office. Covid-19 was a gift to trump, great distraction.
Delighting in someone’s death is gross. Sorry, but it’s gross. And calling that out is also appropriate. I don’t want to be like these rabid, frothy-mouthed, morally bankrupt minions for Trump.
Trump told a reporter in a 1:1 meeting that he just bombed Iraq. It was Syria. The reporter had to correct him. They might be on equal footing in a debate.
It's really shocking just how despicable and desperate the GOP has become. Why don't they get serious about their responsibilities? Free and fair elections. Extending supplemental unemployment insurance. Mandate masks EVERYWHERE Denouncing Trump as he lies his way to November.
You and Trump killed him. Shameless.  How many more will have to die because you deny facts. Murders
How can evangelicals refuse to see genuine Christian belief like bill and Nancy and still call trump one of their own? Watching them you know they both genuinely have faith in God.
Would you have laughed had Hillary or Obama tweeted that? A lot of GOP people seemed to have developed quite the sense of humor since trump was elected.
Imagine a President who needs assistance walking. How weak!!!!
Trump may have scored a decades-old revenge for being sued under a 1973 anti-segregation law #TrumpIsARacist #TrumpVirusDeathToll150K
Had trump said anything about the death of the head of Blacks for Trump? Herman Cain was the head of the Blacks for Trump organization. And nothing. So disrespectful.
The cost of believing Trump's lies: #HermanCain #COVID19 #NotAHoax
You need to stop endorsing products. Not only is it a Hatch Act violation, your family is the kiss of death to any successful brand. Ask  Thanks to you they are a national punchline.  Face it, the  family and Organization are synonymous with bad taste.
Cite Trump last apology to anyone about anything, please.
We seem to forget that Trump is a few cards short of a deck. Biden could win a debate by staying on script while Trump goes off about how he's the stablest of geniuses and fittest and the best doctor and best truck driver and whatever he invents for the day.
This is some good news. It would be nice if he would address Trump, and let him know that he has ZERO authority to change the election date.
This. This is what makes my stomach curl. So many things that were not presidential have been normalized by trump. And not this year but in 20 years when someone says well president trump proposed it during the covid pandemic. American's have short memories unfortunately.
The lifeboats aren't available as long as the overriding philosophy of the Republican rank-and-file is "Donald Trump is an infallible omnipotent god-king who rules by divine right and must never be questioned."
Biden's team has wisely positioned Joe as the "Not Trump" candidate and done its level best to keep him out of the spotlight and put all of the attention on Trump.   With a big lead, there's not much incentive for Biden to agree to a debate: all risk, no reward.
Quit comparing. Trump is responsible for not only Cain’s death but for 150,000 Americans.
This looks like a newspaper from a nightmare, but I'm 100% awake - so the nightmare must be Trump.  #VoteDEM2020

You know, a reasonable argument can be made that Donald Trump killed Herman Cain, which was never on my Bingo card.
You are just opposed to Trump saying it. That the GOP has been destroying election integrity and voting rights for decades is fine with you. It just shouldn’t be said out loud
Monday morning quarterbacks, not problem solvers.  When POTUS banned travel with China, Democrats cried unnecessary, and xenophobic?  Good thing we didn't listen to Joe.  This is called a novel virus, bc it's unique.  President Trump has done as much as his office allows;
Also Trump: It's too dangerous to vote in person and voting by mail is fraudulent!
New York has more covid deaths than every country in the world except for 5.  Trump had a fkn hospital ship sent to its port.
I understand why Trump is against election security. But I CANNOT understand why the rank and file GOP lemmings are against it - it's not a good look when you choose Trump's idiotic ramblings over good, sound policy.
Well there you go. Hope he enjoyed that Trump rally.
The only threat from vote-by-mail is to Trump's re-election. Period.
We deserve to see an "x-ray" of this transaction to see who really benefits!! Insiders bought lots of stock, according the volume surge for Kodak.... Just another shady Trump/Kushner deal!!
Democrats had no response to the pronominal economy built by Pres Trump, except "fear of COVID."  Must maintain fear, to continue devastation of small business.  Under Socialist/Marxist O'Biden policy, all jobs must come from Government. Small business threatens that monopoly.
Also, is that cop allowed to show his support for trump, while he is in uniform?
This is *typically* the point at which Trump files for bankruptcy and leaves everyone else holding the bag...
Crime in cities is based on local and state politics.  Do you think there would be 103 homicides in July in Chicago if Trump had control over the city?  lmfao.  Use your head. just sound foolish right now.
I have an idea, as long as IMPOTUS wants the date change in his kingdom of Trump, can we have it next week?!?!
Exactly. Trump’s not the only problem; he’s the RESULT.
President Trump floats delaying the presidential election, citing his own prediction of fraudulent voting. Can he do this? #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica
only took these mfs 4 years of trump to figure out the right tone for the moment
Time for a new revolution.
Trump may be keeping America sick so that it makes voting set- up more difficult for states to enact. Causing chaos, leaves state voting administrators in the dark, thus wasting their time when they should be organizing for mail in ballots , etc.
Trump: Let me float this out there...  People: THAT IS AN ABOMINATION!  Trump Supporters: Kidding! Kidding! See the question mark? He's such a kidder, that super stable genius of ours.   Trump, in interview: No, I'm not kidding. I don't kid.
Trump can't delay the election.  Only Congress can move the election.  Keep your collective pants on.
That's because Trump is a callous old man who can't do the right thing seemingly ever.
I think a number of people saw this coming.... but scarily, Trump is still floating the idea. Too bad (for him) it won't happen.
Any vote against Trump is likely fraudulent, at least in his mind.
This is simply Trump's desperation in full view. It would be nice if someone in his Administration would let him know the date can't be moved.
On January 20 Trump’s term ends.. If for some reason we did not have an election Pelosi becomes president.. We have a constitution.. The only question is will the military follow the commander in chief or some rogue branch of the government
Fun Fact: Joe Biden appeared in several debates for the Democratic Primary. This year. Was he 'great'? No. But is Trump good at debates? LOL, no. Trump would have to answer questions on everything he's done wrong and LOL it's a really long list.
You do realize that there are millions of American who are NOT protesting in person who still would benefit from a mail-in ballot.   No, of course you don’t. Your profile says you’re a “School Safety Advocate” AND you’re on Team Trump. Classic example of an oxymoron.
Oh hell no...  Trump suggests delaying November U.S. presidential election
Why does trump keep pushing disproved drugs as an antidote for Covid?  Easy. Either he or his kids have stock, lots of stock, in the company.  or  He forgot that he's done this already and can't think of anything else to say.
How about Trump shuts up and does HIS job? Thousands of people dying each day. Trump does nothing. We need more testing. Trump does nothing. Solders being murdered by Taliban via Russia. Trump does nothing. Lost livelihoods? Nothing. Funds for the wealthy? Trump is all in.
The CRAZY thing about Trump saying we should delay the election is the US GDP fell by 32.9% in the 2nd quarter. The largest recorded drop in history.   More than 1.43M people filed for unemployment benefits for the 1st time last week, rising for a 2nd week.
This is where it starts. Trump will refuse to concede the election and refuse to give up power.
Trump us districting from the worst US GDP drop in history. He can't delay the election.
How can that be. Trump just said. President Trump’s repeated claim: ‘The greatest economy in the history of our country’.
You are tying to set up your excuse for loosing. When you loose you will need to blame it on something else. Like how you do with everything. I call it first. When Trump looses. He blames the Mail.
Oh I loved the MJF promo it just eerily reminded me of trump was all.
My friend’s Trump loving Dad just died. He watched Fox “News” and listened to your lies about low death rates, mask inadequacy, and social distancing. It didn’t work for him. You know you are causing people to die, right? Don’t you care?

It’s common knowledge that the liberals are being pushed by an agenda much higher than your regular democratic American. It’s a super filthy business &amp; population control is huge with them. They know Trump knows and will expose them. This is your answer.
If trump had anything to do with it, it’s a guaranteed failure!😂
So true. They dislike Trump primarily because he says out loud what they think
Isn’t that the same argument you used when you couldn’t pass your college English class, “I only failed your class because you don’t like conservative thought.” Between you and Trump I don’t know who whines and cries more. 97 more days til you aren’t relevant.

Open a map.   Putin is creating a modern Cuban Missile Crisis for Europe.   With today’s announcement, Trump’s withdrawal from Syria (warm water port) and disengagement in Balkans and blind eye in a couple of key places- Putin/Trump have  created a perfect storm for Europe.

At the start of the year I would've said Trump, but after the whole pandemic debacle I can see Biden winning.
I don't think so, but he is hurting his nemesis Bezos by slowing down the mail. He's the reason trump refused to bailout the USPS. The test delays are due to so many companies starting up quickly and using fax machines instead of more expensive and quicker permanent technology.
Clinton's was a EULOGY. Obama's was a Trump Roast!
Would this work at your job or company?  Trump: I've done such a horrible job that you need to fire me, I understand. BUT, I've put the company in such a "hole". You should probably wait until you can afford to replace me!
I thought Clinton's was pretty damn good! Better actually...because it was about THE PERSON. Not Trump &amp; his politics! Seemed MORE "Campaign Speach" and a lot LESS "eulogy". Kinda disrespectful if you ask me.

Sad your not gonna see him at the Trump Cock Sucking Sessions?!?  It's okay...I'm SURE someone will hold your hand...and DIGNITY!!!
They want Trump to end systemic racism in police departments like his admin has that power
Doesn’t even listen to him😂I guess cause he tells the truth about Joe and Trump he gets that vibe. People just want everyone to trash Trump rather than telling the truth, don’t have to like him but the truth matters.
We were having a discussion and a question came up. And I said, "I know someone who would KNOW that answer!"  So...Is Trump circumcised?!? I mean EVEN IF it "was dark" everytime. You HAD TO be able to tell with your tongue!!
Well if Trump thought he was a "total idiot"...MAYBE the Republicans should run him instead!!
It's going to take a decade to unravel ALL of the criminal shit they've done!!!  This was a Republican "Smash-N-Grab Robbery"!!!  I wouldn't be surprised if Trump pitched it as,  "Hey, by the time they can charge us. We'll be dead!"
So, the Trump approach. Should work.

I believe that draws a line in the sand &amp; let's us know we are in a war for our Freedoms. #Trump2020VictoryNowMoreThanEver #Trump2020 #VoterIDNow #MAGA #FreedomOfSpeech #BuildTheWall
Looks like a bunch of Conspiracy Idiots, trying to SET UP a much more educated, intelligent&amp; sharp man...3× their age! 😂 OF COURSE...What Trump DOESN'T love a good CONSPIRACY or SET UP.  BOTH....FORGET ABOUT IT!!!
Anything that threatens his dillusional narrative is a scam to him. #WallofMoms #WallOfVets #WallOfDads
While we wait on the November election... where are the Mongols and the rest of Trump's bikers?
No matter how much I agree with the peaceful protesters, this is very true.  Things have gotten out of control, and could get trump another 4 years.  We can't follow his distractions.
This makes Watergate seem like just a slight misunderstanding.  Trump makes Nixon look like a saint.
How so?  Trump has not led in the polling average over Biden at any point, even pre-COVID.  In January Biden was winning.  In July, Biden is winning by more.  Even without the pandemic, we were looking at a tossup election, IMO.
I hope that's true. The Democrats are up to something. #Biden is some kind  Managerial candidate. They are so cocky like they already have cheating set up. The real question is what are we going to do, nothing like the lame party usually does. #Trump #PatriotsAwakened #voterID
Has Trump during His administration solved these issues?
Oh but accused of spying on Baby Trump
Then I guess you expect something more from Trump than what he has already given you Nothing
I am SO F SICK of POLITICIANS tweeting how "Wrong what Trump's doing " is.  AND THAT'S IT!!!  JUST F TWEETING!!!  NOT DOING A DAMN THING ABOUT IT!!!!
I mean, anyone who doesn't agree with #Trump is guilty in his mind.
No, you're not horrible.  Many of us have that same voice. We are just terrified of the possibility trump, or even the  Senate gop, remaining in power. Our country's survival is on the ballot, and Dems must take all or we lose it.
Idk what’s the whole reasoning for saying that but that’s why they’re called Black Trump Supporters and have Black voices for Trump. That identity not going anywhere.
One thing ab Trump he rarely folds on his beliefs😂
Surprised  DIDN'T order the "Homeland Security" to beat the shit out of his casket!!!  Then again...Trump probably doesn't even know WHO he was... OR EVEN that he passed!!!
Now that Trump has secured 30% of Black vote...
Well...when Trump wins. And his "Municipal Guard" kick in your door and try to take your son or daughter.  You can play Taps for him and her, as they're shoved into their van!!!
You know this is untrue Trump golfs almost every weekend with an expensive entourage why lie?
So cute thanks
Nothing Trump says is well said
I posted a joke about Trump and Ivanka! But Twitter INCESTED I take it down!!
Do not vote for Trump 2020
I can almost hear trump thinking about banging porn stars with a newborn at home.
No Trump did not save America he did harm to America We do not need four more years of his destruction
You've LOST YOUR FUCKING MIND!  Big Nixon fan too, were ya?  DO NOT kid yourself!!! If you are a TRUMP FOLLOWER, you are a NAZI!!  And you're IMAGINARY MAN IN THE SKY ain't gonna change all of the WOMEN AND CHILDREN DYING because of his Pride, Gluttony, Greed &amp; Lust!!!
Trump isn’t getting paid tho?
Judge Jeanine on her Fox show tonight was also pushing bringing federal troops to Chicago. I don’t watch, but my husband was. This is obviously a coordinated effort by someone. Trump campaign? Idk.
Hey...EVERYONE!!!  DON'T FORGET TO WATCH  "REVILED:Ukrainian Witnesses Destroy Schiff's Case Exclusive with Rudy Giuliani"!!!😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂  In case you HAVEN'T heard ENOUGH UNBELIEVABLE BULLSHIT this year.  After that, "How Donald Trump Killed Bin laden"!!!😂😂
In other words, trump got to them.  I almost found respect for those corporations, but it's completely gone now.
Hmmmm.  That's new?  It's exactly why trump failed the nation, and Kemp failed GA, and Abbott failed TX, and Ducy failed AZ . . .  However, Cuomo didn't fail NY, because he followed science.
To trump and gop, the ones dying ARE nothing.  They quit caring when they discovered the majority of deaths are the people they hate:   Minorities   Elderly   Poor    Sick When rich, white men start dying, they'll start caring.
I THINK that you MEAN, "Like he's watching Trump do it!"   Not "Palestinians"!!!
I got a Trump joke for   What do a Person, Woman, Man,  Camera, &amp; a TV have in common?  They're ALL things he could VISUALLY SEE AT THAT SPECIFIC TIME!  😂😂😂
It’s all about their getting re-elected but supporting Trump will insure they fail stupid
People who hate Trump sure do talk about him a lot, I don’t have no beef with bro but damn I be tired of seeing the mess😭
Don't let them do it until it's definite they have to. open schools!  Last night Rachel had a lot about schools, and how teachers are fighting.  Even trump said hot spots maybe shouldn't open so soon.  Stream MSNBC's Rachel Maddow from last night if you can
😂😂😂 I always say stuff I don’t like is “trash” or “garbage” and I guess I said “Donald Trump is trash” when I was at Kye’s house last time and now he keeps repeating it. #oops
They weren't "raised" by him. But, YES, they obviously have picked up his traits to "curry favor". JUST LIKE he did with Papa Trump!!!
Right no kid should be throwing up middle fingers with trump gear on and no kid should be having explicit language on a sign🤦🏽‍♂️it’s really sad honestly
Not one. Seen some Trump signs &amp; a couple of Trump bumper stickers. The big thing I've seen way more of, has been America Flags in people's yards. I think that is also code for a #Trump2020 supporter.
We will have rule of law WITHOUT Trump
Over 140,000 dead on Trump watch do you get this????
Ask your self, why does the left hate the American flag, Our fore fathers, #MAGA hat, A Trump sign, a cross, the bible, etc.. They don't just hate but are not even willing to tolerate. Is that the America you want to live in? #Trump2020NowMoreThanEver #MAGA #WalkAway #TrumpTrain
Trump also took down the portraits of Clinton and Bush and put them in a closet. Such a petty little man.
We've probably missed thousands of Big Booms due to the hundreds of Sonic Booms since trump got in WH.
Worse, they are crediting trump for the great economy we had up until a few months ago.
I will be afraid to take anything that trump had a hand in.  I'll wait until something comes from elsewhere.
The guidelines trump had the CDC "lighten up" because they were too strict.  Just like he did for meatpacking plants.
I have to agree.  Nothing's going to change under trump, but next year we can make the positive changes to give equal rights to everyone, and get rid of traitor's memorials.  Any upheaval now plays into trump's hands and base.
Dr. Gupta had a lot to say about the CDC not being "independent" any more on 11th hour last night.  They've always been respected and looked to globally, and now they have no credibility.  Thanks, trump and gop.
You know how to peep a very misinformed person. Ask who’d they rather have running this country right now, Trump or Bill Gates🧐
What's a little fascism in today's world of rampant lawlessness by the entire trump administration?  He's gotten by with treason, tyranny, extortion, money laundering, Russian help in election, campaign fraud, genocide, war on protesters . . .
Just another distraction to keep our focus away from trump's evil doings.  Just makes me wonder what the hell he's up to now, besides working us into a civil war.
Not knowing those most of my friends believe trump over science 🧪
Johnson: Trump is our Bull Connor
Person, Man, Woman, Camera, T.V..  Name 3 things Trump couldn't care less about.   And two he thinks the world runs on!
Yes, you are lucky to have a great leader in NY.  Poor Vicky is in FL with trump's lackey.  It's going to be up to the school boards to save lives there.
This is the silent majority. I been telling people dude been finessing votes with them stims. Bro say he going to war behind Donald Trump😂😂😂😂😂
They really be like “I’m coming out as a Trump supporter. I’ve been struggling with coming out public but let’s go #Trump2020 #MAGA” 😂😂😂😂😂
Soooo...you are pissed because Moore was smart enough to BE RIGHT about Trump and how voters were fooled?!?  I don't understand your "gripe".
I ship Carole Baskin with Donald Trump.
NO!!! KIDS DON'T GET SICK!!! TRUMP SAID SO!! DIDN'T YOU HEAR HIM?!?  He probably would have been fine in Missouri!! Their Governor( says that "They will get COVID! And they won't even go to the hospital or even the doctor! They'll just get over it!!"
If Trump finds a way to cancel the election that’d cause so much more chaos lmao
Why does every news station want to convince us Potus Trump doesn't have a chance. What working class/ middle class, police officers, in the military, owner of a gun, Christain, or wants safe streets vote Democrat. #Trump2020NowMoreThanEver #MAGA #WalkAwayFromDemocratSocialists
The one of the best things Trump could do is negotiate with these colleges to cut down tuition if everything is going to be online. They already ganking us enough.
Ty for including me.
Then had the lil white girl with the eff trump thing. She probably doesn’t even know who Trump is😭
Trump say he volunteers to be either first or last to take the coronavirus vaccine💀
This is so wonderful!  Trump's Gestapo got caught being nothing but vandals themselves, and breaking treaties in the process.
Wow .. they are running out of time and yes the Democrates are throwing the kitchen sink to try and get Trump 😳🙄.  Won’t work ♥️🇺🇸🙏
This is Trump’s America now.
What do you figure the demographics of that were?  I say: 9 CNN "reporters" 7 MSNBC "reporters" 2 Trump oppo researchers &amp; 1 confused grandma that clicked on a YouTube add she thought was for a new dementia medication.
Trump’s America is a scary place.
TRump's sentiment to #Maxwell: *I wish her well* translates &gt; *Don't say a word--I'll pardon you.* #TrumpMeltdown #Epstein #TrumpOrAmerica

Tammy Bruce: Nancy Pelosi just told us everything we need to know about Dems and COVID-19  #FoxNews I want Nancy to keep wearing the mask, now and forever
Nancy Pelosi “Come to ChinaTown”                            “Trump’s Virus. “ Really?
Good!!!  Didn't ANYONE..NOT LEARN what HER FAMILY'S about?!?  Dick Cheney was a bigger monster than Trump could ever dream of being!!! And HE was smart enough to get a patsy and stay under the radar!  Do you REALLY THINK that apple fell far?!?  I DON'T!!!
They lived THREE BLOCKS AWAY on 5th Avenue in Manhattan!!!!  She could practically spit on Trump!  Oh....what a relaxing thought!
He's SCARED!!! She KNOWS something!!!  He, himself, has frequented their "Cesspool Island"(Per Trump) SEVERAL TIMES!!!!
Because THAT HONOR lies with TRUMP AND US!!!!
If the goal is to get Trump out of office, then we need to tell people to not vote for him. However, I don’t agree that we should force people to “settle” for a candidate. If the vote is so valuable, then why are we settling? If our voices matter so much, why lower ‘em to settle?
To be quite honest, the circumstances have always been the same. They are just being brought to light now. Voting is not a pie graph. If someone doesn’t vote for Biden, that doesn’t mean it’s an automatic vote to Trump. That means no one gets that particular vote.
I say, we shave the corners off of the Reflecting Pool so it looks like a giant..."Pea Pod"(😉).  And call it The Trump Impeachment Spittoon!!
Guess we'll see what you're REALLY made of! Won't we?(Hope Trump taught you, "It always comes out")  AND...I hope this apple has, not only, fallen FAR from the tree!  But continues to roll far, far away from the Orchard!!!
Idk what Trump doing but I know I’d nip all of this in a bud. First, I would tell people the truth about this virus and these phony masks.TRUMP VIRUS 🦠 Killed this Man who beat stage 4 CANCER
Someone tweeted that trump has a 43% approval rating from blacks.
Trump already calling the NOVEMBER ELECTION “rigged”. #TrumpPressconference
Trump does not and never has had a 43% approval rating from blacks. Never.
Doesn’t Trump vote by post in Florida? #TrumpPressConference
Quite ironic of Trump talking of banning evictions given his previous form. #trumppresser
Trump needs reading glasses. #trumppresser
I just rushed a donation to help Latino Victory elect diverse Democrats who will take on Trump’s dangerous agenda. Join me and rush a donation, too!
Trump’s swamp.
Trump administration
Yes! That will reverberate in Trump’s tiny brain. Plus Pres. Jimmy Carter’s message was included.
How can anyone trust the  federal government to lead us out of this crisis if the Trump administration listens to a bunch or quacks.
Hey Mika did you know Cain had stage 4 cancer? Yes he did. THATS why he shouldn’t have been at that stupid rally without a mask! Or not there at all! But according to these idiots tweeting, “oh well. He was sick anyway.” Trump has poisened the minds of his fans with stupidity.
How can evangelicals refuse to see genuine Christian belief like bill and Nancy and still call trump one of their own? Watching them you know they both genuinely have faith in God.
Would you have laughed had Hillary or Obama tweeted that? A lot of GOP people seemed to have developed quite the sense of humor since trump was elected.
Imagine a President who needs assistance walking. How weak!!!!
Had trump said anything about the death of the head of Blacks for Trump? Herman Cain was the head of the Blacks for Trump organization. And nothing. So disrespectful.
And when she says that when Trump is in the room I may show her some respect.
This. This is what makes my stomach curl. So many things that were not presidential have been normalized by trump. And not this year but in 20 years when someone says well president trump proposed it during the covid pandemic. American's have short memories unfortunately.
please include Tulsa’s COVID death toll when you mention Herman Cain’s passing on  today. Trump needs to own this.
Trump was needed to fully expose the corruption of the GOP. It’s been said that every President of the US was in office at the right time for the right reason. He was the GOP’s karmic comeuppance.
Defend the Clean Air Act from Trump Administration Attack Call Andrew Wheeler  EPA     (202) 564-4700 PRES DONALD TRUMP     (202) 456- 1414 Congressional SwBd     (202) 224-3121         ENOUGH!!!
Now tell me how you really feel. Nothing makes me feel more sane than listening to you dressing down Trump, his GOP enablers and the WH lackeys that carry his water.

That's a rich ain't it trump. #DonaldTrump
If he’s a fan of Trump, he has no taste in Presidents. I doubt his pizza has any taste either!  #DumpTrump2020 #FlushTheTurdNov3rd
‘Vladimir Putin’s dream’ As Trump admits he has not spoken with Putin about the intelligence on Russia paying bounties to Taliban fighters for the killing of U.S. soldiers, the U.S. announces it will withdraw almost 12,000 troops from Germany. #AmericaisCompromised #BLM
President Trump mused about delaying this year's election based on unsupported conspiracy theorizing about the integrity of voting during the coronavirus disaster. No authority ! He’s always looking for an angle. #AmericaIsStrongerWithBiden #BLM
July Hospitals’ve been directed 2 bypass CDC w/COVID stats b/c of course, the WH is the most truthful, &amp; competent receptacle 4 that critical info. Trump’s floated postponing elections. GOP won’t hold in-person gatherings but demand our kids go back 2 school
Trump can't delay the election.  Only Congress can move the election.  Keep your collective pants on.
And today reports of 23 members of black disciples street gang getting pinched.
Oh what a surprise!!!!  Trump: 'Delay election' because it will be the 'most inaccurate and fraudulent in history'
Obama’s radical judges?? Have you looked at who Trump has been nominating? Give me a break.
Oh I loved the MJF promo it just eerily reminded me of trump was all.
Imagine if Trump is a decoy for the release of information about UFOs. He’s purposely made everything so crazy and unbelievable if they release information people will either doubt it or just calmly go along with it as it’s just another batshit thing in a batshit year?!
This will backfire on Trump and drive away even more suburban voters. November 3 can’t come soon enough
vote for trump if you have a boat.
Over his eyes. Trump said his mask made him look like the Lone Ranger. Gohmert wants to be like Trump.
“Nobody likes me!!!”  *waa waa* “I’m going to take my spray tan &amp; orange head rat and go HOME!”   Chris Cuomo reacts to Trump comment 'nobody likes me'  via
I don’t think the term “Republican Party” will ever regain any respect that it once had. Trump &amp; McConnell have forever sullied it. New game! What should be the new name of the “Conservative Party”?
Seriously. And now MJF looking like he just took a page out of trump's book....
She’s got Admin experience &amp; legitimacy w/our allies. Watching Trump put the screws to Germany p*sses me off. Rice has the chops to deal w/the circumstances.
Ok so keep them on the federal court steps and no further. But that's not the message trump wants to send.
Four years ago, a friend asked me if I thought all Trump supporters were racist. My response was “Maybe not, but they certainly don’t care if their leaders are. They’ve decided racism is fine with them.”  Still true except maybe for the “maybe not” part.
This is exactly the point. MSM attacks  because he is African American Democrat, who supports President Trump.
Don’t think Trump has handled US poorly at all. Interested to know where you are getting this from?  Also, the race to cure COVID can only be achieved in a capitalism type market. Rely on the govt to find cure for COVID? 😂
Chicago Northern Suburb here. I’ve seen some END TRUMP signs which makes me happy! #SuburbsForBiden
Loved when the dude asked Zuckerberg about trump junior getting suspended on twitter. Their aides must be Lincoln Project plants. No way they should be that unprepared.
No. His incompetence cost lives. People were dying while he called it a “liberal hoax”. Your whole “I’m not married to a party” act is a joke. Your talking points are text book Trump supporter.  Just be yourself and stop pretending you care. It’s easier for all of us.
Susan Collins must go. She squandered any remaining integrity when she blindly supported Trump.  #SusanCollinsBetrayedAmerica #SusanCollinsSoldOutAmerica
That tragically averages out to about 1,000 Americans dead per day since Trump made this confident proclamation patting himself on the back regarding his administration’s Covid-19 response at the end of February.
We have to stop this as the Supreme Court ruled in favor of DACA and now TRump is trying to dismantle it!!!
Hey, low income Trump voters...this is what he thinks of you.
Nor is this. Nor is this....
Archie Bunkerboy is a racist scumbag. #trump
The only way Trump can get anyone to like him is by giving away money. Hence his big ‘Grants to Red States’ twit fest this morning. #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica
It’s amazing how blatant Trump is about his expectations for  to be a propaganda instrument for his agenda. He literally tosses out the quid pro quo notion that Fox OWES him their full support since the network has benefited so much from his presidency. Morally bankrupt.

Awesome because the 30 million people who’ve lost their jobs during Trump’s pandemic are looking to travel the country right now and pay $600+ a night for a room.  Dummy.
Speaking of Weekend at Bernie’s....
And Biden is the answer? That is absolutely ridiculous. America needs Trump more than ever. Biden can’t even put coherent sentences together.
All the Trump lemmings falling for the “China Virus” narrative and completely looking the other way on the monumental lack of preparation and leadership from Trump during one of the worst pandemics in our country’s history.  He’s got to go NOW.  150,000 dead and counting.....

We can retire the 'Narcissist of the Century' award 80 years early. Trump wins it, hands down. It would not be physically possible to be a more clueless, self-absorbed idiot than Trump has been in the past 6 months.
This is the way all reporters should be asking questions of Trump.

Why TF would we do this? Oh that's right trump's capriciousness.
I really think nina Turner style progressives want trump to win. I'd guess about 25% of Bernie bros want trump to win. They can't govern. They have no platform except med4all. And I don't think half of them even care about it. It just some rallying cry.
But those emails...and Benghazi...
You can't beat the sheer quality of BBC news with headlines like this, "Trump defend Houston doctor wey Facebook take down her post say she advocated di drug" #BBC #tvlicence #switchedoff
I use to think it was a symbol of hope. When I see it now, I think hopelessness and hatred. People are outraged about destroying symbols of our past. Well, Trump has destroyed this symbol for me. #Biden2020

I guess she must have slept with Trump
Thank you Trevor Noah for making us laugh and getting all the information out to us regardless of what it might of been for example Covid, Trump etc ... you are the man👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾
It’ll get you some trump steaks
Biden will win the rust belt for sure.  Florida, Arizona, and North Carolina will be very, very close, but out of those three, AZ will most likely go to Biden.  Georgia will be one of the worst BG states for suppression and I think Trump will win GA solidly
President Trump says #DrFauci has high approval numbers, but he (Trump) doesn't/ He wants to know why. Anyone care to offer an opinion?
Trump: I want to gas peaceful protesters  Biden: No, 𝑰 want to gas peaceful protesters
It works.  Americans are dying because of the all the lying. I'm pissed about it. Either they don't want a cheap cure or they want to prolong this to get Trump to loose the election. Maybe both

Because everyone is traveling these days and looking to spend a bloated $600+/night on a hotel room..... Dummy.

People who assume that anyone whose ideals skew more liberal than conservative “support those people” are simple-minded. This is what Trump has done to this country— if you have a differing point of view on the world, you are a bad &amp; inferior person. We are better than this.
Nadler! Stop lying! Great video. We need to unite and support Trump. I follow all Patriots. Please FB.
Trump's announcement he was throwing the first pitch at a Yankees game surprised staff, as it was never scheduled. Hallucinations keep coming.  may need to take the reins. #AmericaIsStrongerWithBiden #BlackLivesMatter
Probably because Trump still has a 40% approval rate which is just baffling to every other first world country. Glad you're having fun being the bottom of the barrel. 😘
Trump is such a coward he won’t throw the ball because he was afraid he would get booed.  Who’s the loser ? Go away

No!!! Poor thing really only wanted a rich husband and instead got the scum bag Trump.
I’m sure former Presidents will pick up the slack and will honor the passing of Rep John Lewis as it should be. Trump is a disgrace and his presence is about as wanted as Mitch McConnell’s hollow words.
You’re doing things right if they’re coming after you to try &amp; discredit you. That actually means You WIN! 🏆 Keep up the great work and take comfort knowing you get to live rent-free in Trump’s atrophying brain.

The hero in our town in western MA was the superintendent who wisely shut our schools a week before Baker's order.  Local leaders have been the heroes in MA while Baker suckles up to Trump/Pence and turns a blind eye to intersectional justice issues like the Weymouth compressor.

OMG A lifetime of Trump as president. Sick sick humor!
It was a picture of trump's weird gross nipples!!!
It’s time both sides quit posturing and sit down in a secluded room and don’t come out until you reach a compromise agreement. Maybe Trump can send in Big Macs.
Trump has done more to dishonor golf than any of the stuffy, elitist snobs in Caddyshack. “Golf lover” is not inherently synonymous with Trump supporter.
The People WILL Vote Trump out, I that I feel assured. However, as in 2016 beware the Electoral Delegates.
The Biggest problem to look for is voting by the Electoral Delegates. Trump somehow received more electoral votes even tho he lost the populare vote. I want a name by name accounting per state of how they indeed vote.
He is not Donald Trump.
Trump snake oil salesman  is up in arms over the nearly 300 tragic gun deaths in Chicago so far this year, and is quick to blame Mayor Lightfoot. As for the 140,000+ U.S. Covid-19 deaths tied to Trump’s lack of leadership and pandemic preparation— crickets. Shocking.
Leftists are burning down cities but it’s Trump bad lol. Gtfo
Not good!  Lack of leadership from Trump helped to prolong the pandemic.  Yes the states have a great amount of control over local policies but it doesn’t help when the leader is calling it the flu, threatening states to open schools to keep funding, etc..
But it is a myth. As sure as Trump is a traitor.
Trump at over 20000 lies and counting. Where is Barr on the lie-o-meter?
These are Trump’s radical Christian Domestic Terrorists.

The painting itself is very political, so I don't see what's wrong with a political response. I agree that we should promote peace and equality, but to do that we have to understand the obstacles preventing that. One of them is Trump.
Speaking of “dark money”, as a 501c3 organization, TPUSA and its executives are not legally allowed to promote or campaign for any specific political candidate.  is illegally using tax deductible donations to promote and campaign for Donald Trump. Where is IRS??

I’m helping you get ahead of the pack. Not a chance your idealogy will ever take root in USA. So get the prime spot on the commune. There’s a very loud but small bunch of people who want communism. That’s why Bernie lost. Sure a lot against trump. But they still love their c’ism

Powerful. This Trump-voting grandma from Indiana has had enough of Trump...  via
Which part is a lie. Trump admitted the first. Attempted the second and continues to do the third. The fourth allegation is beyond question. So where’s the lie?FOR. TRUMP
Trump wants to know election results the night of the election because Republicans have figured out how to manipulate electronic voting booths. In 2020 we expect an accurate count and a day or two doesn’t make a lot of difference with mail in ballots that are sent a week early.
The skinniest guy at the gym right now is wearing a Trump 2020 hat. Maybe not the best decision? You may say: “It’s 2020, we aren’t savages nobody will take exception to it.” I say, yeah it’s 2020 have you watched the news at all this year?

Well, Don Jr. has never been encouraged to stand up for what he believes in or shown that he  can be anything, which is probably why a lot of people are saying that he is a horrible father and a cheating husband!  via
And some say Trump isn’t Presidential. He would never make a political speech at a funeral and stoke racial violence . That’s as sleazy as you can be.
I have been staying for the past two years, and I'm going to continue to say it until everyone listens. The Trump Administration with Republicans behind them, are going to attempt a coup. The result of this at some point there will be violence on the street.
I suspect Trump’s morning tweet about delaying the election lit a fire under Obama’s butt. And he’s good at reading a room. 😂
DeSantis won by fraud so why wouldn’t he pay Trump back?
Don’t ignore ~$2T, yes T for trillion, sitting in the TGA. Expect lot of bullish announcements with &gt;100 days to the election. New ATH in indicies is one of the ‘Trump’ cards (pun intended).
So once he turned to the right because he loved Obama back then and now you like him lol typical Trump sheep supporter. Clay will be watching front seat laughing having a beer making money of y’all 😂
What are the odds that Donald Trump has ever donated blood or plasma? 0%
If Trump was a fascist he wouldn’t tweet about delaying the election, he would just delay it and send thugs to beat people up at the polls. I’m not seeing that yet, but I’ll keep my eyes open.
Yet here is proof that Oklahoma was directly effected from this super spreader event. This isn't assumptions. These are facts:

Agree 1000%. He was a accomplished man with a kind heart. It is just too bad he fell under the spell of tRump. He was sick for quite some time - I hope he didn’t suffer.  Rest In Peace, Mr. Cain.

Must we pretend there's an invisible barrier that will protect us? I mean, if I have to I'll play along, but it's not fun.  Say Biden wins by a lot. Does anyone think Trump/Barr can't send uniformed guys to Biden's house before the inauguration to arrest &amp; send him to Guantanamo?
How many THOUSAND people entered the US from China AFTER Trump supposedly stopped people from arriving?
Again, it comes down to choice...some will choose to go to school while others are to afraid...  Everything is a risk... Democrats have been trying to scuttle the economy ever since Trump became president... shutdown is an opportunity for them.
Listening to Trump talk about mail-in voting in his presser is an exercise in suspending reality, truth, and common sense.
Unfortunately, Herman Cain died from a thing called the TRUMP Virus!   Trump's rally. Trump's lies. Trump's virus.

This is  without a mask indoors during a global pandemic where six members of the Trump advance team all tested positive for Covid19 as well as members of the general public. Oklahoma had a massive surge in cases because of this event.

can’t remember the last time trump has been ahead in florida.
Why do you hate our military, who have voted by mail since the Civil War? And why do you hate the Trump family, that also votes by mail?
It's all about what the military decides to do in my book.  As of now, much evidence points to the military turning on Trump if he attempts a self-coup.  Even former MIC lobbyist and current Defense Secretary Esper is against using the Insurrection Act.
Bait? Trump says stupid things and you blame Dems. LOL
Nope, not buying it. November 3rd.!  People can just come out of their fearful hiding or not! I will &amp; I will vote for Trump.

trump wanting to delay the 2020 election is such a conundrum. I KNEW he'd want to mess with the election to stay in power, but at the same time, not getting all of america together at voting booths in the midst of a pandemic is pretty reasonable (although primaries did anyway)

RIP Herman.  You should have listened to the experts. Donald Trump is *NOT* an expert. Let this be a cautionary tale for others.
Trump is directly responsible for his death
Nasty Donald is forgetting who got him elected president!  via
The official cause of death is the Trump Rally in Tulsa
Herman Cain has died from COVID-19 after attending Trump's Tulsa rally.
Her term expires expires 1-3-20. Here's where it gets complicated. Senate Republicans are defending 23 seats. If there is no election, they lose the majority in the Senate, Democrats take control &amp; the senior Democrat still remaining in office is Leahy. Trump won't risk that!
I know.  This is puzzling because Trump doesn't lie.  If only Herman had taken his Hydroxychloroquine.  The poor bastard never had a chance.
It is an ethical dilemma. It was encouraging to see Trump's attorney, advisor(s), and campaign manager in prison. But felt wrong to laugh at Gomert's diagnosis.
Rest in covid Herman. You decided to ignore public health warnings. Donald trump is the reason you are dead.
WHAT A LOSS!  Herman Cain dies from coronavirus he got at the mask-free Trump rally in Tulsa.  Maybe he'll be buried in the Rose Garden as the hero he... never mind.  But Melania is having the Rose Garden dug up...
Because Trump has always shown good judgment
You don't have proof that all this looting and destruction was done by  just BLM protesters, could have been done by White supremacist Trump supporters like the guy at AutoZone.
How about we move the election forward? The sooner we dump Trump, the better.

If all you listen to is Fox News, then your opinion will be severely skewed. Throw in a general dislike (maybe even hatred) of those “coastal elites” and voila, you’re a Trump supporter.
Horrible headline. The headline should say Trump can’t delay elections. Period
Donald Trump delaying the election, even if he could, makes no sense for his gain. Because he technically wasn’t re-elected he wouldn’t be sworn in as President. Pelosi wouldn’t either and bc GOP has more seats in the Senate the next person in line is Sen. Leahy and he’d be Pres.
I hate that Joe Walsh has been able to come into good terms with dems because he’s anti-trump. Everyone in Illinois knows how much of a scumbag the guy truly is.
America's economy just had its worst quarter on record. 150,000+ have died, a large percentage due to Trump's incompetence.   Toss in the mega-corruption &amp; full on racism.    If not for all of that Trump would be looking good.
Exactly what I was thinking...  5) trump can say he’s claiming “victory”  6) republicans point at this as proof it works  7) a lot more people fucking die for being stupid
Trump suggesting the election be delayed:  this horrible president must be soundly defeated.
And Trump will release his tax returns too.
Like Trump, he's the Golden Corral of reasons to turn on him.
Dumb Donald Trump doesn’t have a clue as to what he’s doing in the WH. In fact I hear he gets lost at least once a day and can’t find his way to the Oval Office

Joe Biden for President 2020. In my opinion, Trump's all ready lost. He is losing big time in the general election. Trump needs to resign.
Biden for President 2020. Let's see who will win in November. Trump's all ready lost based on how he's handled everything recently. Trump is currently losing in the general election. Deal with that.
The only kind of assistance Trump can request from foreigners is “thoughts and prayers”
I was in the service the first term and back as a civilian the rest. No such a thing as a perfect term but at least he was a way better by far leader than Trump, who is a divider and not fit to be our president. Never like the guy before POTUS couldn’t believe he got elected.
My disgust with Trump and you is near the same level. So hopefully when we get rid of him in Nov, Ill has a similar movement to remove you. Politicians shouldn't be millionaires completely out of step with everyday people's lives and happiness. Today you broke people's trust

Mmmmmm you blame this on a party. Well if you do, then it would have to be the Republicans because they have been in charge (Senate and WH) since trump. So you are blaming losers WOW.

I am voting for Trump. I have been a Democrat my whole life.  I have switched to being 100% Republican.  I posted the video going around in regards to the front line doctors and I shared it on fb. FB said FAKE NEWS and removed my post. WHERE IS MY FIRST AMENDMENT RIGHT????
C’mon.  Please stop playing cute games.  You also wrote “In his [Cuomo’s] defense, there was a lot we did not know then that we know now.”  But at the same time you make a chart and blame every death on Trump, and I have never seen you make ANY caveats about that chart.
maybe change "Demon Sperm" to "Demon Semen" for the silly rhyme? I can't decide if that would be more or less absurd; my absurd-o-meter crapped out pretty early on in the Trump administration.
Or windmills cause cancer. Or this beauty: “I tested very positively in another sense. I tested positively toward negative. I tested perfectly this morning, meaning I tested negative," President Trump says.
You give Cuomo a pass, but not Trump?  I don’t know how to talk to you.  It’s all politics with you.  Not with me.  I’m about the data.
"We used to push Biden to put forward a vision beyond beating Trump, but since he won't try, I guess we won't either!"
Polling seems to suggest opposition to masks correlates with support for Trump. But Trump supporters, for the most part, are not libertarians and would not describe themselves as such.
It does though. Women - especially in positions of authority - can’t permit people like Trump to behave that way. She could have taken action but chose to let it continue.

Barr is acting as if the 440 Special Counsel's Report didn't exist. It contained 200 pages of evidence of conspiratorial behavior by campaign staff, allies, Trump, and Russians, and 240 pages of evidence of obstruction.  The Dossier is a red herring.
If you have evidence that compellingly refutes the 200 pages of evidence of Trump-Russia conspiracy that the Special Counsel Report contains, then produce it.  Argument-by-assertion isn't a thing.
This isn't about the White House.  It's about POUTS's *personal interest* in renovating the existing FBI building to prevent a disruptive construction project when the old one is sold to a developer.  Because it's right across from the Trump hotel in DC.
It is, but I don’t really care any more. And this is coming from someone who doesn’t really like Trump or Biden!
Barr also "thought" that the FBI had 'spied' on the Trump Campaign.  He said that 9 mos ago, yet we've seen absolutely nothing from DOJ to lend credence to the claim.  Nor is it an appropriate use of the term "spy", which describes *foreign* adversaries.
GOP sure love to kiss each other’s ASS! Barr u  are such a lying sack of shit! You do know lying under oath is criminal! So remember that when charges are brought up against u &amp; Trump after the election!

Having no idea what they're doing or where things stand is certainly on-brand for the Trump Administration.

1. "Defund the police" doesn't appear in Joe Biden's policy brief.  2. Joe has said publicly he doesn't support "defunding the police".  This means that Eric Trump is just fear-mongering with a GOP hoax. And violating his agreement to stay out of politics.

People were subject to state mandates, not Trump's advice. Also his administration did advise those things. The media and Twitter libs should be to blame for creating a political divide by screaming at everything he suggests, even if he's right.
You've murdered  As well as many others who attended. #SuperSpreaderTrump
6,000 showed up and amoung the crowd?  now dead as well as thousands infected. Thanks #SuperSpreaderTrump and thanks to the #DemonSperm
Trump is too far gone to correct him
Obama attacks police brutality and voter suppression in powerful eulogy for John Lewis – video | US news | The Guardian
This is  without a mask indoors during a global pandemic where six members of the Trump advance team all tested positive for Covid19 as well as members of the general public. Oklahoma had a massive surge in cases because of this event.
You miss spoke. You called the virus by the wrong name. Its pronounced the trump virus. Don't worry its just the dementia acting up again.  Person  Man Woman  Camera  Idiot
Except that's the entire point of the question YOU asked. The event was inside. Trump's first rally during the pandemic. Inside a venue in Tulsa.  Here is  inside with no mask on. What else do you want to hear? That the #GOPDemonSperm that  spokeabt?
Lol really  you wanna go there? How about if your boy Donald Trump was born Donald nobody what would he be doing today? I’ve lost complete respect for you during this pandemic and your love affair with trump. He’s a sexual predator and a egotistical maniac!!
Word up: You don’t gain any “points” for using a man’s passing as fame fodder. You claim Trump has no class? Look in a damn mirror!
On the way home I saw someone with Trump signs saying things like Trump country Trump 2020 I swear everytime I see those signs I get pissed off? Do you get pissed when you see any Trump signs
U.S. lets ex-Trump lawyer Michael Cohen publish book while serving sentence at home
Exactly. And the fact these guys are being duped by this complete fraud makes me wonder what kind of education they received at my alma mater. Basically all that remains of the Trump base are non-college whites... and apparently all the white kids who played football at MSU.
Trump slump.
To make President Trump look bad,and blame him to try and ruin the re election.Demorats help spread it through Fauci.
A U.S. appeals court will reconsider dismissal of the case against former Trump national security adviser Michael Flynn.
#TrumpVirus - Extremely ironic - the good men like Lewis who inspired Obama to lead were the positive change agents that  were the catalyst of the uprising of the loud white lions and the pilfered election for trump by 1.5M cancelled / suppressed votes in MI. #BLM #2020Elections
Trump says it is safe to open schools but now it is not safe to hold an election
I have a serious question, when tRump gets out of office, do we call him Mr. President, or by his inmate number?
Trump has broken the law before but Trump can't delay the election DO NOT fall for it lets keep the topic somewhere else okay. Let's talk about Lewis's funeral or Herman's death topics like that.
Herman Cain dies of Covid19 after being in the hospital for over a month after attending Trump's rally. Trump's rallies are a Covid19 breeding ground period.
So where the evidence of this? THAT TRUMP HAD THEM MOVED? Easy to say but prove it!!!!!! I’ll wait
I forgot jobs. And don't call Trump a traditional conservative. He's gotta play dirty because those were the rules set by his opponents.
Only a Trump Presidency can make you wish Bush was still in office.
I’m sure trump will “take NO responsibility.”
I urge everyone to read the  book “Hiding in Plain Sight” to know how pernicious the corruption of the Trump administration is. #TrumpThreatensAmerica
Trump : it’s too dangerous for the American people to vote   Also Trump: we have to send teachers and kids to school in the middle of a pandemic
Trump is directly responsible for his death
The official cause of death is the Trump Rally in Tulsa
Is there anything stopping #Trump from buying his reelection?  WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump says he wants the next coronavirus relief package to be "very generous" with direct stimulus payments to Americans that are potentially more than $1,200.
About catching it at a Trump rally
Rest in covid Herman. You decided to ignore public health warnings. Donald trump is the reason you are dead.
do it president Trump. Make it illegal for them to send in votes by mail. these people are all cowards and their atheist number to try to destroy America again like they have.
delay the election then. I just got some stupid democratic piece of paper in the mail saying you can mail in your vote. President Trump I don't accept anything except you being our President for the next four years. we cannot have these atheist back.They will destroy America.
The GOP had a plan to fight the tRUMP virus? Bullshit. You and the rest of the GOP have been very publicly downplaying it the whole time. Refusing to wear a mask calling it a hoax calling it fake news. Attacking our top medical advisors and now its the Dems fault. Blow me
Anything to delay his move out date  CNN: Trump floats delaying election despite lack of authority to do so.   via
Trump's tweet about raising the possibility of delaying the election is nothing but a distraction he can't delay the election by executive order. Congress decides when elections are not a sitting president
#WallStreet and some of the base dead-enders are about the only support #Trump has left. So now he wants to postpone the election. He has also put up barricades around the White House to fortify his encampment and make it more difficult to root him out in less then 100 days.
Illinois.  We need Trump and Police!
Trump received $10 Million to relocate the Embassy from Israel to Jerusalem from Sheldon &amp; Miriam Adelson, as a condition/campaign promise...but glad he's ALLOWING WOMEN TO SPEAK, not typically a Trump move, wonder how much that cost.
Pssh, trump is such a loser quitter, bailing on Portland already. If only he’d blackbagged more hippies, or maybe cracked a few more veterans’ skulls, he’d be crushing it in the polls.
Can you hear with your nose that far up TRUMP’s ASS Laura?
If Trump says schools are safe then he should personally visit schools and prove it.
A grand jury in NY may have indicted Trump but chose to keep it sealed atm and if Trump loses the indictment gets unsealed
Of you support him I want nothing to do with you. I blocked a fiend I've had for 20 years and will not talk to him as he supports trump.  The man doesn't even know why he wants a 2nd term. When asked he broke into some crazy story about his first day as president. He has no idea
To vent needed a place to unleash all the anger  I felt for Trump and the GOP since my friends outside of Twitter wouldn't talk about it as much or seem uninterested in the topic and it worried me
Can we please keep RBG in a bubble til January 20th 2021 I do not want her to retire and I don't want her seat to be stolen by Trump and the Trump party. We will impeach Brett Kavanagh and Neil Gorsuch along with every nominee he's ever appointed and we will be successful
Thank you govenor states like Florida are to blame for uptick in cases along with Trump not taking Covid19 seriously. Also Ron Desantis failed to take the virus seriously he is the worst govenor in the country
#NobodyLikesTrump is trending once again and I tend to help keep it trending since it hurts Trump's feelings
When Trump beat Hillary all their minds exploded!  They’re still trying to figure out what happened!  We know they never will. But they don’t know that.🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
Because she agrees with Trump!
How many months have the GOP and tRUMP just hoped this virus would go away without a plan of any kind? 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. Has America's biggest enemy living in it.
Exactly the way they attempted to orchestrate an impeachment of Trump.
Yes he does as trump said the confederate flag is freedom of speech he as a black man has some rights right?
I would not worry about NATO. A President Biden will undo the harm. In February 2021, we need a full investigation into the Trump/Putin disaster. Thanks Anthony for standing up to Trump. Maybe you can help rebuild the Republican party.
Trump Touts ‘Suburban Lifestyle Dream’ After Rescinding Obama-Era Rule Preventing Housing Discrimination
So am I wrong Mr Muir?  Are you married? To who? Are you HIV positive? You’re so quick to criticize Trump.  Let’s have some information.  Typical democrat .
Mary Trump to be on the #ReidOut shortly be prepared and Joy is keeping the bounty story alive after 1 month it happened
ABC news skewing their show to portray Trump in the worst possible light, meanwhile they hide the fact that David Muir is a flaming homosexual, married to a man. Doesn’t have the guts to admit it.  Hides it, and ABC is complicit
Mmmmmm you blame this on a party. Well if you do, then it would have to be the Republicans because they have been in charge (Senate and WH) since trump. So you are blaming losers WOW.
Please consult the lizard people and the demons that rape you and give you their demon seed like the woman trump just retweeted.
So you’re voting for Trump
So vote for Trump
Zuckerberg defending Twitters decision to temporarily limit Trump Jrs features for 12h who didn't see that coming?
The real nightmare would be having a Trump move into my neighborhood—or anyone from this clown car of an administration.
So what.  You had no mask yesterday and were breathing your illness all over the place.  You're a real piece of work Louie.  Take a nap man, get better and realize the nature of this pandemic instead of sucking up to Trump.  I understand this is harsh but hey.  Grow up.
She broke the law and got caught. Nothing to do with trump or any of the movement going on. Breaking the law is breaking the law
Oh so you’re responsible for putting them in the toilet? Another stunning deal from Trump
This is frightening NO More Cults IDC if your candidate lost or not anyone planning not to vote cause their candidate won't be VP are Trump supporters in reality same goes with Bernie or Bust voters
And if  biggest issue with  is that she voted with Trump too much, then they would be SHOCKED to learn that she voted against Trump TWICE as often as the late Sen. John McCain.
Trump tells suburban voters they will 'no longer be bothered' by low-income housing
Thank you govenor victory for the people and Trump caved once again
Vote as if your life department on it 3rd party vote is a vote for Trump staying home is a vote for Trump
When trump blames China for not stopping the spread of Covid, everyone should ask him why it’s on China, and NOT on him in the United States!
Demented donny tRUMP a puppet for Russia and a complete and utter failure.
Gm everyone i wake up to see Claudia Conway return and an interview saying Trump never discussed Russian Bounty on American troops. We all know he doesn't give a dam and is Putin's best friend
Love you President Trump
the truth is all they are doing is trying to make people sick and they hope everyone dies so they can blame President Trump so they can get back in office. That's it that's why all this nonsense is going on United States. they own all these dumb HATE groups. FUCK DEMOCRATS.

Do us all a favor and resign please. Stop blaming this problem on Trump because it was the same shit when Obama was in office. CPD hates you bacause you dont stand up for them. It's sad and pathetic.
Like how Putin will help cheat for trump to  “win” in 2020...
I dare you to watch this and tell me that trump isn’t the dumbest man to ever occupy our White House...⬇️⬇️⬇️
You call that "credible objective evidence" did any of those health professionals examined Mr. Trump and  prescribed him legal diagnosis?
Makes you wonder what the Dems plan really is.... Soros hinted at taking Trump out during his speech in Switzerland this month.

Democrats well is drying up  Trump keeps on exposing the liberal money makers Chinese faucets College indoctrination camps It was on display  the barr hearing  Love swalwell new look but brain remains the same
Putin is trump’s proud owner.
Stunning and revealing interview with Trump. I am convinced that Putin has something damaging on him. Where is the outrage from the Republicans about Putin arming the Taliban to kill our soldiers. Trump calls this fake news, this is CRAZY.
Trump campaign hid $170 million in spending, watchdog says - Los Angeles Times
easier said than done when you're a millionaire.I'm a trump supporter but I'm electrician and there is no work.I live in Illinois. I got unemployment thank God and then all the sudden they sent me a letter saying I was overpaid and I owe them the money back. I'm still unemployed
Because everything you just stated about Trump is pure emotional appeal and not statement based on facts and evidence.
As, to Bernie supporters not supporting Biden.  I hope that's the case, I hope they not that stupid to actually support him.  However there's graph based on his platform vs Trump's platform that shows that  Biden moved significantly more to the left than Trump to the right.
Dr. Stella Immanuel is a lunatic......if I see anyone tweet that crazy video of her saying masks don’t work, I’m going in. She believes in demon sperm and aliens running the government smh.....  .....and Trump said she’s an “important voice” 🤦🏽  Done
there's a lot of focus on trump, but trump is not the source of fascism in this country, nor will removing trump end fascism in this country
if you're unfamiliar with the history of steven bannon and the trump campaign, he was part of the team who, in 2014, selected trump for the 2016 election
These past 12h and so on have been the best since moment Trump got impeached in the house. With Trump Jr getting limited access to Twitter for 12h along with Kelli Ward and Twitter removing Trump's tweets on Covid19.
Donald Trump begins rolling back DACA in defiance of the Supreme Court.
Barr could NOT answer the simple 1st Amendment of the Constitution question Yes/No 5 TIMES. Always had to drag a Trump defense story into his answer. What a lying flying asshole!  How can that be defended?

You reported that Trump paid prostitutes to pee in a bed supposedly slept in in by Obama. Totally normal.
1.4 billion Chinese voters:  [   ] Trump [   ] Biden [x ] Xi  Democratic Party:  "Russians!"
I cant watch Trump speak and this is exactly why!
I am glad Bill Barr is on Parler and nothing else it's the perfect place for people like him Trump should join Parler and leave Twitter since he rants about them a lot lately
BREAKING: Michael Cohen said Trump ordered him to pay a demon $130,000 after an extramarital sex romp.
Rambling press conference, softball questions, obviously all set up.  Example “Are you running against Trump or for yourself?”. That triggered a lengthy response which made little, if any, sense
He didn't get suspended cause Trump retweeted the video Kelli Ward and Trump Jr uploaded the video according to a spokesperson for the company
Now do tRump sr
When you tweet or talk can you still taste tRUMP on your lips? He's pretty far out of date so it can't taste too good. How do you and others in the GOP justify blowing tRUMP when you all hate homosexuality? Just wondering. Now what were you saying?
Trump once again failed our nation but you won't President Biden. Pray for you and all Covid 19 victim's often.
Breaking: Kelli Ward like Trump Jr has been suspended for 12 hours for sharing the same video that he shared.
Trump Jr still suspended for another 6 hours these 12 hours will be the best 12h for the resistance
Barletta did overperform in Luzerne.  I think Trump is favored to carry it, but probably by a similar margin to Barletta even if Biden is winning the state by less than Casey did.
Lucerne County, PA- Trump vs Biden
Twitter limits Trump Jr.'s access after he shared coronavirus misinformation
I'm so over the GOP reps! Blatantly protecting Trump and Barr and a big FU to the American people! This has to be a joke!
The film in question claims that all Muslims are potential terrorists and argues for their dehumanization. It's from Trump's "let's ban Muslims from entering the country and kick them all out" school of thought, which is actively genocidal in intention.
Two things seem to annoy Trump: stealing the limelight and not falling in line. Fauci is doing both, so of course he annoys him.
This is Trump’s America
Lol...thinking everything is a conspiracy except anything that Trump is involved with must be a wild way to live.
Thanks to the Trump Virus, 150K Americans have moved underground
Really dude how about the spin video Jordan tried to pull? No issues with that Lady G??? You are so far up both Trump and Barr's ass you are gone! Oh look Johnson too fits right in there too!!! Disgusting!
good for you president Trump. our country needed a real leader and someone who's not a paid for puppet.
Typical seasonal flu: 10MM-45MM cases, &lt;60K deaths.  The Trump virus: ~4.1MM cases,150K deaths (3X high of range). The Trump virus is significantly more deadly than the seasonal flu. In your opinion, exactly when was the CDC overtaken by the commie dems?
1. CIA was monitoring the virus in Nov 2019. 2. trump had news on 12/22/19 in the PDB 3.  Went classified till later Feb. 4.  Pulled 3 offices of pandemic response 1 during this period. 5. Testing failure of not adopting Europes cost huge.
If Twitter can suspend Trump's son for 12h they certainly can do the same to Trump himself their actions today show that they are getting closer to suspending him
OMG wow 1st Trump's tweets get removed now Trump Jr has been suspended for 12 hours today is off to a great start well done everyone
Fauci responds to Trump tweet: 'I have not been misleading the American public under any circumstances'
The real Trump derangement syndrome affects those deranged enough to support him. Y’all are fucked up.
The fact that we even defending hashtags is insane that's how far Trump is gone
Trump cant fire Fauci fantastic he is safe atm but he could still find someone to fire him and with less than 100 days til election day it would make things even worse if he tries too
Gm everyone I wake up and Trump's tweet about being a cure for Covid19 has been removed making it the most severe action Twitter has taken what a great start to the day.
So, think that Trump, as man who admitted that he never kids, was kidding?
The Governors were trying to save your life something Trump should have done in the beginning. Did you forget Trump is the one who said to drink disinfectant. So he is the Toxic one.
Because Trump’s a douche bag
I will support the Lincoln project til the election, but they are still republicans. I do not agree politically with republicans at all, except for wanting tRump gone.
Their not afraid of it, they don’t want to give Trump credit for it!
You might want to rethink What you just said.   Trump has Leaders in other countries treating him like he’s a king.     Go ahead and watch this documentary it’s very enlightening 😉
Trump is 😆 to you.. trump said other idiot !
President Trump do you remember this statement you made in 2009?
Wait 'til it's over? The Obama admin. gave the Trump team a full playbook on how to respond to pandemic based on Obama's lessons learned &amp; Trump ignored it.
I lost one last week. 20 plus years of friendship gone because he likes trump and his ideas. Can't hang with that.
31 days it took 31 days for 1 reporter to ask Trump on if he confronted Putin on bounties. Why didn't they ask this from the day it happened what took so long.
Trump's national security advisor has been caught not wearing a mask along with his buddies having an indoor dinner. Remember the indoor dinners in the pre covid times except  the photo was taken 2 weeks ago and he's been caught wearing a mask below his nose which is incorrect
WTF Trump is planning to send hundreds of more unidentified federal agents to Portland specifically at a courthouse this is coming from Ali Velshi and the mayor of Seattle who is on his show.
Trump's RESPONSE to the pandemic is a disaster. For example, Germany's COVID-19 deaths per MM population is 88% less than the U.S. + the unemployment rate is 1/2 of Trump's.
We don’t need Trump to tell us anything at all, we see it all unfold before our own eyes VIOLENCE! Terrorizing America, destroying and denying history isn’t going to bring change or justice to anyone!  Patriots will stand up to all this, &amp; we will practice our 2nd amendment right
petition to make 911 a one time world wide holiday to take down all trump towers
Those so called protestors are behaving like thugs and rioting, looting, burning, attacking Police Officers, even killing and shooting People with opposing views like that black man Mr. Bernell Trammell! All he did was hold a Trump 2020 Vote for Trump sign, they shot him dead!
Since Trump thinks it's illegal for trending topics i am helping make #TrumpleThinSkin trend.
Which of Trump's accomplishments do you consider the most impressive: 30MM+ Americans unemployed or 150K COVID-19 deaths?
Mayors Tell Congress To Stop Trump From Deploying Federal Agents : Live Updates: Protests For Racial Justice : NPR
Good. He wouldn’t want Trump there. Racist a$$ Trump
It's not illegal to trend hashtags Trump is definitely insane if his supporters really believe that will they quit Twitter just to obey him. I mean come on this is another distraction that he is creating and it is a stupid one they know he has nothing left but to whine.
Trump needs this Doctor at his next Press Conference and let her louse.
WTF, I mean literally, WTF
Deactivate your Twitter account Trump if you hate Twitter so much
Who is that, and why did they make Trump masks blue and not red?
What happened to forgive and forget come on we certainly can't do that with Trump and Trumpers but we can with people like Harris
No one has explained if Obamacare is so awful why Trump can't deliver on his "beautiful" healthcare plan?
I'm an American and Trump hasn't fought for me.
It’s pretty obvious that Trump is not interested in the lives of any man, woman and child in the US.
Yeah because Trump allowed masks which means no mail in ballots.Which is why I don't understand the Trump love (and not just you). He's cheated on his wives, insulted a family who lost their son in combat, mocked a disabled person &amp; insulted a POW and Purple Heart recipients. If you or I did these things, we'd be vilfied (and rightfully so)
That's because there are few people I hate more than Trump. I'm not afraid to admit that. I find him to be a horrible person, and an even worse leader. Like I said, it's not about party here. I've never felt this way about another President, but I find Trump vile
2/2 that era never owned slaves, so again, hard for me to respect someone who dealt in human flesh. Trump however, is like no president before him, even Nixon. Any man who would  talk of dating his own daughter, even jokingly, does not deserve anyone's respect.
2/2 as passionate in my dislike. This is not about party with me, its about character, and Trump has yet to display any.
1/2 You support a vile human being, and I'm the one who's hate-filled? I never called you a racist, and I don't think you're dumb. Far from it, which is why I have such a hard time understanding why you so staunchly defend Trump. I promise you, if he was a Democrat, I'd be just
I'm not baiting you to do anything. You just don't want to hear the truth. And besides, you support Trump. Is there really any lower to go?
Obama inherited one of the worst recessions in history, cut unemployment in half, and didn't see the economy tank during the Ebola crisis. And according to Trump, Coronavirus was a Democratic hoax. The reason the economy is tanking is because of his piss-poor response to it
No, you just keep justifying a racist term. And are these the Trump supporters you're talking about?
No, all decent people decided well before this that calling it the Chinese Virus was wrong. There’s a reason you don’t hear it called that other than by Trump and his cult members.
Comparing food to a deadly virus? Since Trump started calling it the Chinese Virus, hate crimes against Asian Americans have increased. There’s a reason the WHO no longer names diseases after geographic regions. Its because morons politicize it
Things we may see before Fall High School football in Illinois  wearing an I love LA shirt  wearing anything pro Trump  wearing a KU Sucks shirt  wearing anything pro KU  wearing I heart Tiger Woods Feel free to add on
It may take their own mortality to open their eyes, or maybe not.  Eric Trump is the one who said all things Covid will disappear on November 3rd.
Piece of shit Trump goons, boy are we ever tired of winning.
MD in you handle signifies respect, yes? In a civilized country.  Have you listened to Trump’s speeches/pressers at all?  Our President, Donald J Trump deserves resqect, but at higher level than you. Good day.
Because trump wore one and said it was patriotic lol
He can’t because...  ...’MuST gET tRuMP’ 😡  (insert whiny child-like voice practicing Tourette’s for a role)
Well, the dead are refusing to be used to support Trump.  Reagan’s library has refused his campaign the use of his image.  He’s really tempting fate here.
I’m sorry you have “trump derangement syndrome” I wish you well, stop drinking the orange kool-aid and you should be fine Karen. #fakefraudfailure45
Of course it’s the irony that you don’t understand!  Trump blasted Obama for golfing while he was in office, however trump has golfed more in his one (and only) term than Obama did in both his terms. #fakefraudfailure45 #theRepugnantOnes
I will go to the poll in a full gear to vote trump WWG1WGA
July 14, 2016, CNN had Clinton ahead by 12%, same poll this year has Biden ahead by 6%, either way if Biden ever comes out of his basement and debates Trump, Biden will have a Chernobyl level of implosion
That’s the craziest thing in the world. Bro could say doo doo came from the sky and folks would say “That’s right! Trump 2020”
Donald Trump doesn't want the job of being president he just gets off on the power and prestige. He just doesn't want to actually do the work.
Genius—  “Trump is a Frankenstein…made up of all the worst possible presidents. He has the pandemic response of Woodrow Wilson, the racism of Andrew Jackson, the haughtiness of Bill Clinton, the vocabulary of George W Bush, and it’s all stuffed in to Taft’s body.”
This is quite possibly the greatest travesty of the Trump administration... and that’s saying something.
I’ve not wore one this whole time
CRIME SURGE: President Donald Trump and Attorney General William Barr announced today they will be sending federal agents to combat crime in Chicago and Albuquerque.
CRIME SURGE: President Donald Trump and Attorney General William Barr announced today they will be sending federal agents to combat crime in Chicago and Albuquerque.
No need to go insulting Disney villains by comparing them to American leaders, especially Trump. 😂😂   Sure the virus is more infectious, but not much more deadly than pneumonia or the common flu if one's immune system is weak to begin with.
The global tally of people infected with the coronavirus neared 15 million Wednesday. While in Philadelphia, President Donald Trump warned the pandemic would "get worse before it gets better."
Hey how’s your hairdo?? Y’all set up to see real Help come show you how to stop terrorists? Trump Train baby!!
Guess what darling you can’t stop Trump from sending help the police have asked people are dying and you are not doing ANYTHING! You think he will terrorize your people? Give the world a real story YOUR PEOPLE ARE ALREADY TERRORIZED!! And killed maimed so girl stfu
No more trump!!This is the standard Trump said something monumentally stupid/racist/sexist/classist/offensive defense. Its always just a joke.  The Fuck outta here with that bullshit.
The Trump cultists are saying he died from colon cancer. Just scrolling down the replies of the president’s statement about Herman Cain is eye-opening.
Not me.
They are saying he was weak and dying anyways so it wasn’t really his piss poor decision to not wear a mask that killed him. Clearly btw, Trump* knew what was happening to him, he canceled all of his rallies since. Only took Herman’s life to prove covids seriousness to trump.
So are you a Democrat? Because you’re obviously bringing it up. Go look at any single thing Trump has said and tell me again that he hasn’t pushed anything... why don’t you go sit and read rather than just spouting false information? ... 🤷🏼‍♂️🤦🏼‍♂️💁🏼‍♂️
Isn’t the white haired guy in the photo the same one that stood with Dr. Immanuel the alien DNA, demon sperm, religion vaccine conspiracy nut job?
President Donald Trump suggested delaying the 2020 presidential election on Thursday, tweeting it will be “the most inaccurate and fraudulent election in history.”
not to be a conspiracy theorist, but the republican foot-in-the-door strategy has been moving the overton window to the right for decades. trump suggesting delaying the election doesn’t seem far from suggesting we don’t need anymore at all.
Still better than Trump. Especially if he picks Warren or Harris.
Don wouldn’t show. He is a germaphobe.  He doesn’t like the reality of death, ask Mary Trump on that. And he doesn’t want to face the family since Cain most likely got the virus following Trump’s rally criteria and loved ones might be really angry at him.  It is all about Don.
Trump cannot delay the election. This is not a Republican or Democrat issue, this is an American issue. Vote on November 3rd.
Exactly. Trump is the Troll King. ❤️
4 billion in unrelated nonsense when the GOP can’t agree on as little as $200 for those displaced by Trump poor leadership in covid. Tomorrow citizens of the US will be homeless due to your inability to focus on the needs of Americans. This isn’t the Democrats fault. It is yours.
and send them in after I vote in person so I could vote Trump 4 times lol
Mail in voting is such a fraud I’m getting in my mail stuff constantly pushing mail in voting and the people haven’t lived here in four years  I’m sure I will get at least 3 ballots I won’t because I’m a republican but I should fill out all 3 and vote Trump
Enjoy Trump’s second term.
Remember when you said this was just some conspiracy bullshit? Is it bad your opponent knows you better than yourself?
It’s so sad how far Fox News has fallen just heard th  Edm  on the radio saying Trump is pushing false information about mail in voting They’re just such a disgrace to themselves
It's almost like...having a compromised immune system...would be a good reason to wear a mask and/or stay home from a trump rally, which he did neither
Tell that to Donald John Trump Sr. and all those who believe that he can selectively observe and change and over ride the United States Constitution and Bill of Rights by himself without congressional amendments at his singular discretion and whim.
During a visit to West Texas, President Donald Trump hinted that a second round of stimulus checks could exceed the $1,200 payment amount issued in the first COVID-19 stimulus package.
"No,  will not try and delay or postpone the election to keep the office."    What a load of bullshit.  you're afraid.  Afraid that you're losing power, control, and importance.  Still time to make good decisions.  #wearadamnmask
Tech CEOs that testify before Congress surely come away feeling like they just had to help their grandparents with their computer.
President Donald Trump is for the first time floating a “delay" to November's presidential election, saying mail-in voting will result in fraud.

I don’t support calling my daughter a piece of ass on Howard stern or having a sex addiction so bad it’s caused Trump* to cheat on every wife and pay a porn star to stay quiet about him raw dogging her... (while he was married)
Trump* wants to have sex with his daughter.
I guess I’d rather mix that up, than confuse my daughter for my 4th mistress like Trump* does.
Dear trump virus,  STOP F*CKING TEASING ME. HIT CHEETOH AND THE MITCH!!!
President Trump.  I never cared about politics or what was going on in this world.  I have been awakened.  And I see what's going on.  And you are the only person I have ever called a hero.  God bless you!  Let's have coffee.🙂
I agree- my fear is Governor will Trump this! (No pun intended)
Stop attributing every trump does to Putin, it makes him seem more menancing for actual anti Putin protests in Russia.
Lotta Trump voters in that feed...
He was on it for lile 4 days...
You're asking Trump supporters to do something inconvenient. They  all know what happens when they feel that something is inconvenient for them...
Can you tell me exactly how Trump is corrupt?  Btw, where are Nancy’s tax returns?
My favorite are the ones like " once Trump is gone, everything will return to normal."  No, MFer, I'm gonna fucking hate those people until I die. Full on spit in the face hate.  They built this.
They're ramping themselves up to vote for Trump, their lord and savior from those evil Democrats
Congratulations to both men for being recognized for your good works.  Now how will Trump retaliate given he pouting about his popularity and had already annouced removing our troops from Germany to as a distraction after the embarrassing endorsement of “alien DNA“ dr over Fauci?
I can only hope that The Lincoln Project does an ad titled “Trump’s AmeriKKKa “ with highlights from Lafayette Sq., Portland, Seattle and anywhere his gestapo thugs have been. The violence is now, caused by him not Biden.
I agree Linda. We need to stop these white supremacist Trump supporters from posing as Antifa.
White supremacist Trump supporters posing as antifa are looting and setting fires.
If Biden chooses a good VP candidate like Tammy Duckworth, Trump wouldn't stand a chance.
They are white supremacist Trump supporters posing as Antifa.
Qanon is a foreign managed psyop to focus a cult of personality of the most "useful idiots" in America to shield actual pedophiles like Trump by black flagging nonsense and accusing innocent people.   It always was, and always will be.
This is an awesome display of patriotism. I would love to see it catch on with Hannity and Trump
are you gonna let Trump disrespect you all?  Are you on his side too?
After now seeing two interviews of President Trump, it seems pretty clear that  A) Trump doesn't have anyone giving him good advice B) He's not listening to anyone who wants to give him good advice  And that advice is, "don't interview"  both options are bad.
you really have more important things to think about and do - get off Twitter before you become like Trump - you are better than this
35million unemployed 55million kids not in school 22million expected to be evicted soon  All because the Democrats and Chinese hate Trump.    #Trump2020 #MAGA2020 🇺🇸
So now Trump is supposed to stop hurricanes? He has to step in and do Gov. And Mayor's jobs because they refuse to stop the violence and destruction of our cities. Grow a brain,  smfh
All while trump is still fvcking his daughter?
Yeah, 'Trump dipshit sycophancy' is real alright and pathetic all around.
Nadler or Trump ?
Blacks Latinos Jews Women LGBTQ+ Muslims and Chinese for Trump  I try not to judge but I'm failing. I don't understand how these demographic of people (&amp; others unlisted) can support him.
President Trump holds a news conference:
Sooo Trump WASNT just "inspecting" the room in the basement. Lmao! #BarrHearing
She should be at the next Trump rally and the next corona briefings
Because the virus is now part of their coup. They weaponize it against Trump whilest simultaneously retracting information that can save lives, and ignoring it during their own riots and 'protests'.  Vile, murderous people.
Twitter has limited some functionality on Donald Trump Jr.’s account after he tweeted a video that ran afoul of the company’s policies on Covid-19 misinformation, a Twitter spokesperson confirmed to CNN Business on Tuesday.
Why don’t you report what the CLINICAL supporters of HCQ are saying?  Is the Trib part of a Racket that wants to raise the body count, in hopes of damaging Trump &amp; electing a senile and corrupt kid-sniffer for President?  Report the other side.  #LadyMacbeth washed and washed
Studies have shown hydroxychloroquine isn't an effective treatment for COVID-19 and the U.S. government is no longer allowing it to be used for that purpose.
Why won’t the Secret Service tell us how much they have spent at Trump* resorts? Why is the RNC and Trump* campaign spending MILLIONS at Trump* properties? Why won’t the admin share the list of biz that took PPP money? are trumps cronies on that list?
How did the Chinese get so much influence on our tech platforms and media?  🤔/ 😂   Go Trump, bust up those human traffickers aka China.  The days of them enslaving their people, via work conditions, surveillance, illness, need to end.
Politico is obviously part of this latest #Hoax.  HCQ saves lives, it doesn’t kill.  Is your state trying to kill people and raise the body count hoping to damage Trump?
Of course, illegal brown people. Duh. I’m surprised the cause isn’t stupid Governors pandering to their idiot citizens &amp; Trump.
Lol.. Trump*  and Barr are fucking incompetent.
Agreed worse now. Nixon put positive policies in place which affect us to this day. Can trump/gop the same thing?  No
Ted Nugent adopted a teenage girl so he could have sex with her  Trump only surrounds himself with deviants
Judging from how hard it had been for my niece to get that RX for her lupus, Trump hoarded it from the pharm companies and now the government owns millions of doses sitting in warehouses unused. BTW patient were thanked for their sacrifice when they denied per Trump’s request
They don't get a pass because they were only 80% shitty compared to Trump and McConnell being 110% shitty.
You're saying that as if Melania Trump cares about anyone who isn't Melania Trump.
Why would we all be getting played?  Who wins this game?  Trump wishes this to be true, it just isn’t factual.  There’s no conspiracy here, Americans simply can’t listen to simple instructions to help the more susceptible population, pretty sad.
Where are Trump's well wishes tweet to Cain?
Cute but I think her vocabulary is more difficult and expansive than Trump.  Liddle kids are adorable though,  CONFEVE that is all.
Trump should bring her to the briefings
Nah trump will just import from Saudi Arabia or Russia 😠
It has come out in the news media that the fbi lied about trump.  They signed off on releasing the dossier that had lies about trump.  Can’t trust the fbi either.
Since they work for the government they don’t have any choice but to obey Trump. And they’re not secret do you announce the departments they are coming from. They had identification numbers that you can report. So not secret. Try again.
One with a Trump bumper sticker.
A simple “no” on Trump’s part would have sufficed.  Everybody, even his supports, knows he didn’t.
Lol that lady isn’t far off from trump and it’s fitting she was outted as racist after the show. He called her “baby girl Lisa” 😂😂
Someone put trump and Kanye’s face over two characters from 90 day fiancé. It’s a reality TV show that is basically human cartoons.
Trump has been callous to this good man’s passing from the beginning.  It is a gift to the family that he doesn’t desecrate Rep. Lewis’ memory with he cold, ugly, racist presence.
Tell Facebook to stop allowing right-wing politicians to spread lies and misinformation!
Trump wins, so am I. Fuck this shit.
Everything you need to know about Trump in 2 simple tweets:
Trump isn't anything new for  He's not good at hiding the racist, homophobic, classist parts, but those have been there since (at the very least) Nixon.
Ok, what? Trump &amp; Hannity told me that Antifa is the violent group 🤔
Trump is doing the typical Dictator move. He's turning the White House into a fortress. Are you still wondering if he will need to be forcibly removed?
I'm good with trump not being at Lewis' funeral just like I'm good with him not unveiling Obama's portrait. It would be hypocritical. I know how he feels about Black people.
Me every time that picture of Donald Trump lactating pops up on my timeline
You will have done it to yourselves by hitching your wagons to Trump.
Me seeing Elizabeth Warren trending ❤️❤️❤️ #WarrenForVP  (*sidenote - I'd be happy with whoever Biden picks.  They're all great women.  So long as we get Trump out I'm happy)
The Nazi flags were a nice touch with the man’s Trump shirt.
And this is why, at any other moment, I’d never vote for Biden. However, there are two clear reasons to vote for him: he’s not Trump; Harris as VP.
Totally agree with Rush why are republicans not fighting back I think their not just incase Trump looses the want to be spared by media they have always been pansies and done with the flow they did same thing in the beginning of Trumps win just incase he was thrown out grow  some
Lmfao, this guy really believes Trump doesn't profit from the presidency...
Why is it extraordinary? It's the Trump administration. They literally lie about everything.   THEY LIE ABOUT EVERYTHING  How can you not see this after 20,000 lies in less than 4 years????
Trump has flipped on every single position but the Trump rubes always excuse that.
They’re just giving Trump what he wants. Need to stop.
It's too bad because if Trump weren't a germaphobe he'd probably would've had it by now. He doesn't shake people's hands in private and doesn't let anyone touch anything because in his narcissistic brain of his he believes everyone else is diseased and lesser than him.
So there really is nothing that Trump won't fuck up in this country...
Y’all ain’t doing your job correctly and that’s how I know this some shit cus how trump been around ppl with it but not exposed yet foh
It isn’t like Trump has ever acted protective of Melania. His cheating while she was birthing his son being the ultimate example of his lack of concern for her. But, by now you would think he would get the P.R. of his lack of gallantry.  She also needs to get her own umbrella.
I got a running list of things for which Biden needs to apologize, but he will still get my vote. Harris is my choice for VP no apologies necessary.   Trump is using the Constitution as toilet paper &amp; people want her to grovel? We are in trouble
Your tweet confirms trump has a real chance at winning 4 more years. I've said the same thing &amp; got the same argument from some independent voter.  Biden was my 2nd to last choice but he will get my vote to try to get out of a dictatorship
It would make sense.  The UN is telling Trump he can’t send feds in and what better way to destroy our country than sending in UN troops...democrats want to destroy.
You can dislike Biden, and be critical of his flaws, while still acknowledging the reality that he is very different from Trump in many policy areas.
Trump has been in office less that 4 years - one man hasn’t caused all these problems. All those who have been in office over 12 years are the problem on both parties. Term Limits!  This election is capitalism vs communism.
bUt bIdEn iS tHe sAmE aS tRuMp  Screamed the entitled progressive dripping in privilege.
Trump’s a damn liar!! Mail-in voting safe, except for Trump’s baseless attacks FULL OF LIES. Hey, Trump... How are you voting? #Biden2020Landslide #TrumpFailedAmerica
Seeds are probably what they were developing in the lab with COVID to get back at Trump over the terifs
Yes for TRUMP
Every last person in the Trump administration is absolute trash.
Meanwhile Trumps only for Trump*.
Mike Pence, Bill Barr, Kayleigh McEnany, Jared Kushner, Ivanka Trump, Melania Trump, Betsy DeVos, Larry Kudlow, Wilbur Ross, Brad Parscale and Donald Trump all voted with Mail-In. So, shut the fuck up &amp; stop dogging on USPS for your authoritarian regime you fucking dip shit
I mean, Trump* voted by mail. So in addition to taxes and his wives, you are saying he cheated cause he voted by mail?
Trump retweeted this more than an hour after the event started. Lol.
You are SOOOOOO right.  People think Trump made this happen.  The Shitty was there for decades.  is a festering boil. It has continued to grow and get worse, but it started long ago.
Joe, everyone will have an excellent shot at success if Donald J. Trump is re-elected.   If you are elected, the whole nation will go in the basement!  #MAGA2020 #BacktoWorkAmerica #BackToSchoolAmerica
According to Trump*, Trump and his entire family are guilty of voter fraud by doing mail in ballots.
Trump is either weak or inept or both.
I’m waiting for Trump* to do a interview on The Breakfast Club with
Were you sad when Trump put children in cages that are now being sexually trafficked?
Because of the hateful way the left talks about Trump, he has to emphasize how his actions have benefited minorities (and everybody).  The facts would be buried otherwise.  Media will not tell the truth.  #BacktoWorkAmerica #BackToSchoolAmerica
Copy and paste this text and tweet it:  JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
It’s weird how all the white nationalists vote for Trump* though... don’t ya think?!?!?
Hey uh.. QANON.. ya got any problems with a Trump* running around with a cult that practices polygamy and child brides? Or... ya just worried about Pizza Hut?
I'm also on the democratic mailing list and only get 1 maybe 2 emails a month though and never got this many before Trump. I dont normally donate to campaigns but I probably would donate to Biden if he chose Duckworth as VP
I need people to know that we are not all like the Asswipe down the road with the trump flag! #NotMyPresident #BLM #loveislove
4 million 17 year olds turn 18 before Nov 3  that is 1 of the reasons there is such a push for schools to open can't vote if you're sick or dead  Trump lost popular vote by almost 4 million  Younger people have the power
Trump* committed voter fraud by mailing in his vote?!?!?
Trump &amp; GOP will use the evictions to invalidate 100s of 1000s if not millions of voter registrations due to relocations &amp; homelessness. Nothing will stop that massive purge. Whether or not that works, I fear he will try to invalidate having the elections at all because of unrest
Can always count on the Trump rubes to make everything political...
I've been a part of the Republican party emailing list for years and get like 1 email a month, if that even. In the past month or so I have gotten 5+ emails PER DAY from the Trump campaign asking for donations, selling MAGA gear, and trying to get me to sign up to absentee vote
And, is that Harriet Tubman, the person he won’t replace Andrew Jackson with on the $20 until Trump is out of office?
Frederick Douglass????  Seriously??  Trump couldn’t “recognize” him if he were to come alive again and was the only one in the room!
Trump*: what is Ivanka has a nice rack?
Trump* said Washington liberated airports.
Quick signature: Tell the Trump administration and Congress to protect the CDC and fund testing and contact tracing!
I had a joke about Trump but nobody wanted to hear it.
Not just lazy.  Trump is callous, selfish, inept, demented and cruel.
“If we have free and fair voting Trump is going to win” y’all he is not going to accept this election.  #DumpTrump
I have said from the start, Trump is going to be the reason for a thousand laws to prevent another Trump.  via
The dude is wearing a Trump*/ Pence shirt.
Trump supporters going full Nazi
Incorrect. Don't really care for Trump, but all of the cognitive dissonance and idiocracy is completely on the left now. I say that as someone who voted democrat most of my life.  I'll be voting trump. TBH everyone remaining on the left has extreme cognitive issues.
Seriously, Watters is bring Trump’s long time buddy Jeffrey Epstein into this conversation with his children‘s cancer charity stealing son?  That is another door he wanted to swing open?
Thank you for inquiring. State Farm does not endorse Brett Favre. -Jessica
It isn’t subtle either.  It is the same thing Trump has said to all in trouble who have damning info on him.
Tom, the problem is that the next proto-fascist will probably be smarter and more capable.  Trump has shown how much destruction can be done if you just ignore every possible norm and no one pushes back.
The riots in Portland should be summarily put down.  People wielding eye-blinding lasers should be shot. The violence and destruction are not a lawful assembly ‘for redress of grievances’. Trump should invoke the Insurrection Act.  Thugs must be jailed.
Belief is such a funny word. Belief is a choice, and the Trump Evangelicals make the choice to follow their false orange god. I don't consider them Christians, just hypocrites who quote scripture and wave Bibles around.
He’s saying Trump* supporters have to do a lot of backtracking, grandpa.
Man, I made this bears twitter for sports only, followed devoted Bears fans for strictly football but some of y’all make it tough to follow  If you love Trump or hate him, I can guarantee everyone that follows you for bears football could give a fuck about your opinion on him.
Everything Trump does benefits Putin while damaging the USA bit we're not supposed to think he's a puppet??
Stop calling it fn "Trump's America." This is just who we fn are. He catalyzed a lot but it's not going away when he does.
This is a lie and it’s obviously so, since Trump has prided himself on raising employment rates.  The RINOs might turn up their noses at working people but not honest Republicans.
Yeah you follow trump and cited 13/50 un ironically like it hasn’t been discredited by every academic study conducted... I’ll doubt that one
It's quite interesting the  is trying to sell "pre #COVID19" Trump, while admitting we arent going back to pre #coronavirus days.
Trump taped the interview with Portnoy just a day after a Fox News interview in which he crowed at length about his supposed ability, on a cognitive test he says he took, to remember five words in order: "Person, woman, man, camera, TV."  Crowed at Length.  Fucking brilliant!
Let's say we will vote for GOP members that stood up to Trump. That would be one, once. Too late.
It’s time for Trump to take action and stop talking about doing something or Portland Seattle Chicago is just the beginning
Trump isn't "acting" like an authoritarian dictator. He is an authoritarian dictator. We need to stop using soft language that gives him the benefit of doubt.
Unfortunately, it is a scene from a dictatorship in some third world country.  America is sinking and Trump orders more anchors.
I see pic now.  I think that Trump has tried to save people, but many forces want him gone and think getting people to associate body count with him his helping their cause.  Just look at the cabal resistance to therapeutics, and blue state elderly maneuvers. Its obviously evil.
Odd that the same people celebrating the settlements of Nick Sandmann as some sort of proof that the media is corrupt don’t see Trump’s settlements as any sign of guilt at all.
One can only hope, wish &amp; pray she takes her trump values ass off the air!
You know because of Trump poor handling of covid, you are probably the only plane from the U.S. that was allowed in the country or in the entire EU for that matter. Personally, given the Trump Administration's rate of infection among personnel, I wouldn’t have let you in either.
Oh my, my, my.  Rich people don’t want their kids at risk of covid. You know what, others parents don’t either.  Will Don force Barron’s school to open too?  Barron Trump's School Not Resuming Classes Like Normal This Fall Despite Trump's Push to Reopen
Let’s help  weigh-in on the #RFS. Share your voice now and let President Trump and EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler to immediately reject the small refinery exemptions as invalid and illegal.
Media should be asking Trump why you still supporting Fauci after last nights actions
Since Trump took him off the briefings he wasn’t getting enough attention
Trump’s SS whacking a protestor upside the head with a baton. That’s an illegal action.
There is no trump without conservative talk radio, local communities of people talking about their ideas/identity, and a frustration with existing power structures
I think the tragedy is employers/employment. US leadship is a quagmire &amp; trump is a tyrant. But in a republic, it’s the actions of the people that dictate the leadership, not the reverse.   The militarization of ideology/politics (right &amp; left) is groundswell immorality
I have a package stuck in limbo since may. It's not the USPS fault. Thank trump for this
The maggat doesn’t realize you are talking about Trump* so he liked your tweet. Lol
Barron Trump's school and most private schools will have virtual learning It's not safe for them not us 😠😒
At least it's against trump as long as they all vote against him in Nov  We gotta take what we can get 😀
As parents and teachers worry over safety in the midst of forced school reopenings, it is noteworthy that Baron Trump's school is NOT reopening this year.  Another indication of how this Administration views the rest of us as beneath them    via
Most of Chicago's problems stem from the open sewer that is Indiana, the state that Trump's VP helped fuck up.
Everytime I go on YouTube it's a a tossup between peacock ads and trump ads. There is no escape
Palmer’s ‘report’ is deranged.  He claims Trump is trying to kill children by playing catch.  If Palmer doesn’t live under a rock — does he? — he knows kids are at practically zero risk from COVID-19.   Palmer is an idiot.
#MeToo Voting for Trump!
This read like a Trump speech. This is utterly ridiculous and dangerous. These folks don't give a fuck about they own kids. #Covid_19
See Rudy tweet.  See Rudy ramble.  See Rudy prove Trump is not the first President who is racist!
She just lost credibility. What did trump promise or threaten?
I don't see the upside for President Trump here. Nobody gives a rats ass how many people are shot or killed in Chicago.
1 of the evil reasons for opening schools -  4 million 17 year-olds turn 18 before Nov 3.  They can't vote if they are sick or dead  Trump lost the popular vote by almost 4 million
Didn’t y’all vote for Trump?
Trump talked to Putin today, but not Dr Fauci.  Think about that.
Let us hope, but they are both pretty lame. Trump can't even insult well, GOP are just p*ssies.
Trumpers are running out of excuses.  Once Trump backpedals enough, and they feel betrayed, they're gonna claim the Dems have cloned him and the real Trump is being held hostage in a pizza joint or something.
There is no we here fool. As big pharma makes progress would be correct. After the abysmal leadership on Trump Virus by your dear leader, NO ONE in this administration gets credit for a vaccine, get over it.
President Trump is announcing that he has canceled segments of the Republican National Convention scheduled for Florida next month, citing a “flare-up” of the coronavirus.
President Trump is expected to sign executive orders as early as Friday that are designed to lower drug prices, according to a report from The Hill.
WOW, Mr. Trump!! Your COVID press conference has made me reconsider your failures of the last 3.7 years. ALL YOU HAVE TO DO NOW IS BRING ALL THE UNFORTUNATELY PASSED AWAY AMERICANS YOU KILLED BACK TO LIFE! When this is done I will consider voting for you this November. #Biden
You misspelled Trump.
It isn’t democrats who are strong advocate of the racist flag or continuing to honor confederate Generals who committed treason against the United States.  It is Donald John Trump, Sr. and many members of the GOP.
Or maybe Mary Trump was a weakling who couldn’t take a joke, or even understand one.  They say 1 out of 3 people doesn’t understand humor.  Just guessing she was the dud.
but. i. this. this is Trump's. hmm...
Are you going to speak about how the Trump nightmare is your fault?
Somehow Trump has overseen 52,000,000,000 Americans being tested at the state level.  It’s actually been a beautiful manifestation of Federalism, well executed by POTUS.  People like Lightfoot favor BIG gov, centralized away from the individual.  That is why they criticize this.
Yes, you’ll watch Trump and then lie about it.  Pity the fools who rely on your reporting.

A judge ordered the release from prison of President Donald Trump’s former personal lawyer on Thursday, saying he believes the government retaliated against him for planning to release a book about Trump before November’s election.
Funny, you don’t hold Trump to those same standards.
How is this Biden’s protest? Trump is President right now, while this is occurring, and he is actively making the situation worse.
#CognitiveTest of the type Trump took do not test cognitive excellence. They test cognitive #integrity.  They are only hard if you have #cognitive deficiency.  I dont know why no one is telling this to
Their balls are sitting in a glass jar on Trump’s desk.
There was no mention of the Russian #bounty in the call between Putin and  because Trump was never briefed on it. #BountyGate #BountyGateAintGoingAway
Everything, everything trump does has an ulterior motive which benefits him.
Sure, we need a  box of rocks in office.  He has  no townhalls, fears constituents, while being Illinois’ fundraising fluffer to re-elect trump.  Another year of him sitting on his ass, twiddling his thumbs, raking in money on the taxpayers dime.  Get off the dole you miscreant!
Racist, Facsist, Authoritarian imbecile, damn fool. These are Trump’s calling cards. America needs better! NOW. #Biden
I do this exact thing when assessing someone for a concussion. Congrats  Trump, you don’t have a concussion. When they get it right, I don’t go “holy shit you are super smart!”
#ImVoting4BidenBecause ...oh wait... I actually have to provide an explanation?   I thought the hash tag spoke for itself, but Trump, Barr, Jordan, Graham, McConnell, Cruz, The GOP, Russian Interference, 2016 Election, Gestapo tactics, bounties on soldiers.How do you know that the media is lying and not Trump?  Who made you the one who decides who’s right and wrong?
If Trump knows the Trump Corona Virus why don’t we have a national plan to combat it? Instead Trump abdicated his responsibility and passed it off to the states.
All Trump did was put Trump first.
Part of me feels like the bar dropped so far that we’re going to always hold the president in lesser regard because he/she isn’t Trump.
Just like trump. They deserve each other.
Nunes... Benedict Arnold..... trump same.
Republicans and Trump have to worry that most of its supporters won’t show up on             November /03/20   , because he keep insisting it will be rigged and much fraud in the election ! He wins by taking the GOP down with him ! Keep him saying such lies &amp; it will cost u big!
Well, it would. If you're dead, you can't catch tRUmp Virus
Trump is Foxifying VOA. Remember the normal people who ran the VOA and quit mid June, only to be replaced by Trumpsters? 6 weeks later...
Fine with me, especially if it throws a wrench in to the Democratic plan to cheat. Adam Schiff already worried saying the election will be held on the third no matter what Trump says.
This needs to be said by all Republicans. Ads needs to play on this theme in all media forums. They need minority conservative groups to unite and be featured in ads. Trump won’t win with a twitter campaign by himself. He’s preaching to the choir.
No mask. No social distancing. No example for Trumpers. Didn’t Trump lose a friend to the Trump Corona Virus today and now he is endangering someone else?
The military will not follow his orders. Just swear Biden in, take the nuke suitcase away and govern at camp David. trump will find that an empty White House will become boring and he’ll eventually move out. The secret service for Biden can remove trump also.
I don't expect any different messages from the Trump haters.
Words. However most of the families that has a tragedy, will be at least 4 votes pulled away from trump
I may be delusional but come November the American people will decide. Would you like to make a wager with me if trump wins or loses?
Trumps administration has had no focus on anything. We just had the worst economic Qtr in history. We have the highest deficit in history. Trump has killed 151,000 from the Trump Corona Virus so far. Trump is by far the worst POTUS in history.
For every death from coronavirus and the people getting screwed on unemployment, the wrath of the American people shall fall onto trump and his republicans... so sayeth me.
If anyone thinks his behavior recently is because he is “trying to lose”, then they have not been paying attention the last 3 1/2 years. Trump has not changed
And look how much the Republican Party has changed since Lincoln freed the slaves over a hundred years ago till now where Trump is a raging, fascist, racist moron and the rest of the Republican Party are in lock step.
Trump rally is killing democrats
Trump only wok because not enough people voted for Clinton. She had poor voter turnout. Trump had average voter turnout. If no one cares enough about Joe as opposed to simply hate for Trump, the same thing will happen IMO.
152,000 deaths on trump's incapable hands gaming pandemic to steal another election. The most inaccurate &amp; fraudulent president in history. Hey, your Putin is ecstatic! You're breaking records all over the place! #TrumpIsTheBiggestMassMurdererInAmericanHistory
Trumps margin of defeat will be so huge we won’t need all to wait more than 5 minutes. Then the National Guard will head over to the White House to remove Trump.
Trump will lose by the widest margin in history. Unless he resigns and has Pence pardon him Trump will be off to prison early next year.
It is truly pathetic to watch these Democrats like Nancy Pelosi, Dick Schumer, Adam Schiff, and especially the rest of them attacking Mr. bar in the hearing. These are grown adults that act like children bickering over a candy bar. Every day it’s complaints about Mr. Trump.

Herman Cain thought it was a hoax too. He is dead today from Corona Virus he caught at the last Trump rally. You should go to a rally, catch the virus and die too.
No, they’re not. 95% of voters are confident with mail in voting. Trump knows in an honest election he will have a very embarrassing loss Nov 3.
trump wants for himself🤣🤣🤣
trump to follow
It turned into a cult like heavens gate. They will go down with trump without questioning his motives.
My chihuahua Ginger is all that and more. I think she could win against trump
TELL HIS WIFE YOU ARE VERY SORRY YOU KILLED HIM AND THOUSANDS OF OTHER AMERICANS BY TELLING THEM THAT THE VIRUS WASN'T SERIOUS
How nice of you to do that Rally during a pandemic btw
Trump should cancel the election until the Covid virus is gone. We don’t want to jeopardize our safety and our Do WE!!!
Trump killed Cain at his rally. Cain died of the Trump Coronavirus he got by not wearing a mask and not using social distancing at the Trump rally.
If we are at the point where you seriously think that some states may stop electors, Trump has already broken our democracy.
Trump floats idea of election delay, a virtual impossibility. This is just the start of his bid to be a dictator.
Only Trump could find that loophole. He is just too much of a genius. Believe me!
I'm dying for Trump to die does that count? 😂😂😂
Wonder if Trump world will consider Herman Cain a martyr, who sacrificed his life to please his leader?
Trump is so afraid of being embarrassed in the coming election (landslide loss) he is already making up excuses and trying to find a way to cheat the election for himself.
Trump is doing an AWESOME job of defining himself in terms favorable to Biden. Please proceed.
Instead of asking  can we go to rural areas and ask Trump voters, if they like the idea of spending 20-30 dollars to send mail via fedex as opposed to cents with USPS.
Donald Trump never wanted to be President, he just wanted to WIN. Winning is all that mattered to him, not the responsibility of the job. Being a winner is all that is important to him. That is why he is so desperate now. He knows he is losing and that is inconceivable to him.
Pfizer Could Cut Jobs Due to 'Radical' Trump Plan | Kodak Scores Major API Production Loan
people are saying you saved the great american company Kodak and it’s great employees this will bring numerous jobs to american shout it out for America to hear Obama ain’t save Kodak trump did. Black people love Kodak too.
Trump you are the best president ever. Obama could saved the great american company Kodak and had the working on the vaccine too. He fought 3 diseases and didn’t think cuz he ain’t as smart as you. Tell the world how you saved such a great american company
I bet it will really piss Obama off today if Trump bragged about how he saved Kodak such a great American company.
And President Trump will not delay elections during this pandemic.
Shed some light on the Vanessa Guillen case. Her family is marching RIGHT NOW, in Washington DC. They will speaking with DONALD TRUMP today!
Vanessa Guillens mom will be speaking with Donald Trump. Shed some light on this military issue rogan 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
That’s funny because you’re using a Mexican woman’s name and hashtag in your pinned tweet. By the way her mother will be speaking with Donald Trump today without the help of any black protest thank you next!
“Even in an emergency, such as a global pandemic, the president can’t circumvent Congress and postpone or cancel the general election. And it’s extremely unlikely Congress would move it.”
Trump be like blah, blah, blah.
I would believe you if you can honestly answer these questions: 1- Is Trump fit to be president 2- Can Trump be trusted with national security and american soldiers’ kives 3- Were you right when you said Trump has learned his lesson 4- Do you believe DoJ is acting with integrity
An 1845 federal law placed the date of the election the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November. The president does not have the authority to change the date; see you at the pollls on November 3rd, Trump.
Herman Cain went to a Trump rally without wearing a mask. His death could have been prevented if he had listened to experts and not had followed blind  propaganda.
and no, by absolutely no means am I simping for the Trump/Pence ticket
Democrats doing yet people only see Trump.
President Trump doesn’t have the authority to a delay an election and this fall’s election will happen as scheduled regardless of what conspiracy theories he tries to push.
Trump *wants* to delay the election.  Let's tell ALL OF HIS SUPPORTERS it IS delayed  And those of us who pay attention to the current laws will vote as scheduled, on November 3rd  Can the logic-minded collectively agree that this might work? 😉  #DumpTrumpDayNov3 #DumpTrump

His cronie is trying to rig the mail so he can mess up and rig the votes. The we can claim that it was really rigged and by the trump admin and republicans.
Yup we’re first alright. In coronavirus deaths and infection. Like trump said MAGA! Our economy will be the first to go also.
The teachers union will do anything to hurt Trump even hurting kids and not letting them go back to class
Sure  is a racist piece of shit. With 150,000 deaths on trump's incapable hands gaming pandemic for personal &amp; political gain, add #TrumpIsTheBiggestMassMurdererInAmericanHistory #25thAmendmentBeforeWeAllDie #VoteBlueToEndThisNightmare #WeStillShootTraitorsDontWe

But it is so great to experience the TRUMP ERA!!!
Where’d you get your neuroscience degree? Trump University? Did you go to school with Doctor Demon Sperm?
This is just more proof Trump could care less about our troops. I’m outraged and I’m not even in the military any more. Trump is a draft dodging coward.
‘Trump Grifts, You Die’: New Ad Rips President For Profiting Amid Pandemic   We all knew he's been stealing from America. It's his way.
My guess is Trump was told he wasn’t welcome but again just my guess 🤷🏼‍♂️

Trump says Fox News 'totally forgot who got them where they are'
Because they have one priority, outlawing a woman’s right to choose and Trump bows to their wishes.
Trump refused to pay them. I mean, I can understand if it was because they’re awful. But, it was likely it’s because the morals of an anthill.
And still we are paying over $2/gallon. Thanks for screwing us Trump. I bet the oil CEOs are happy with Trump and their profits.
Millions of Americans are sufffering from the virus, from a plunging economy that is threatening people's jobs and homes and a huge racial unrest crisis.  And this is what Trump is focused on?  He's definitely the president from hell.
Dear Santa, All I want for Christmas is for Trump to lose the election. I promise to be good.
If Trump can mail in vote and not worry about it why can’t I?
NO HE DOESNT. It’s always Trump first in his mind.
No one pay any attention to  anymore. He has no moral strength. He is speaking now only because Trump’s numbers are down.
#Republicans Notice the pic has no one with a mask or any social distancing? I wonder how many of these idiots will catch the Trump Corona Virus. Rep Gomert just announced he is positive. How many will not survive. I’m not voting for a dead man.
Call on them to forcibly remove Trump from office if necessary.
That's interesting since every commercial of his I ever see is making fun of Trump. I remember I could tolerate John Stewart since he made fun of everything. The show would be nothing without Trump.
Just saw a commercial for  where that #idiot  was making fun of Trump for stumbling over his words... just wondering if you've ever heard Biden talk? #Trump2020
Or,like trump's buddies in Russia and north Korea

Trump is a huge help to the energy industry. Trump raised prices to all of us so the energy companies could have higher profits. Thanks Trump for taking money out of my wallet and giving it to the wealthy.
Complaint: Trump Making Illegal Secret Payments, Including To His Own Family   No surprise here. He's been stealing from America since he took office. Jared and Ivanka have benefited to the tune of $100,000,000.
Yea, Yea Yea. Everybody hates Trump. Wait!! There’s great reasons for everyone to hate Trump. He is an idiot.
And what will Trump say about the electorate when TRUMP is overwhelmingly VOTED OUT OF OFFICE.
Anderson Cooper Taunts Trump With Baby Talk For Fleeing News Conference

So that’s why trump is trying to build a wall! Maybe he has alien DNA and doesn’t want anyone to know.
Because Trump only hires the very best idiots out there.  If he discovers that they are not idiots, he fires them.
Oh well. He’s following Heavens Gate prophet trump.
Big mistake trump real big!!!!
Donald Trump is literally trash and I sincerely hope we can collectively get our shit together to end this.
He might be confused with the $7 boyscout fee he once paid for his son using Trump Foundation funds.
Strategy? Trump? Those 2 words just don’t go together. All Trump does is hide in his bunker and watch Fox.
Some of Trumps lies were finally filtered on social media so now Trump is whining like the big baby he is.
Trumps presidency has cost us 150,000 American lives plus raising the deficit to world record highs along with record unemployment. How could Biden possibly make it worse than Trump?
If the crazy you’re referring to is Trump &amp; Barr then yes, they need to be gone.
(Collins declines to back Trump’s re-election)  (Collins condemns Trump’s reversal on transgender healthcare protections)  (Collins says Trump shouldn’t have commuted Roger Stone’s sentence)
CNN is a joke. They still think the protestors in Portland are peaceful. They completely ignore the videos showing anarchists/domestic terrorists attacking our federal agents and courthouse. Trump is 100% correct that CNN provides fake news. Trash tabloid network. Fire Zucker!!!
Folks are here due to the perception of free speech, whether they like Trump or not.. if this continues the perception will leave, and so will the people. They're slicing their own throat here on Tweeter.   #Hydroxychloroquine Works.
Time for Trump to consult with Dr. Terry Dubrow.
Excellent  piece by a long-time GOP insider on how the party lost its way - and its soul - with the tacit understanding they could simply ignore calls for inclusiveness once  was elected:
Yet another temper tantrum by the orange clown. Trump might as well have said "He gets a piece of cake. Why don't I get a piece of cake? I love cake." Such a large, dangerous child.
Not really.  But for Donald Trump, yes, yes, yes!
It’s true with trump. You say something, he’ll try and ruin you.
How’s you’re heavens gate cult doing trump?
Yeah yeah yeah.... same stuff different day. Lock trump up!

The more you piss off Republicans, the more they will want to make sure Trump wins, just watch in November.
SerialBrain2: Trump’s Secret Path  via
I think you want to blame the real cause, China, for all these desths, not Trump. If Biden was President the desths would be 1,000 times higher!
There will come a time - and very soon - when republicans will realize that hijacking of the party by Trump was similar to a corporate hostile takeover where person taking over the company has no interest or sympathy for the company or its employees/members. Will be too late.
I can't speak for everyone here but what I can tell you is that my post is about the official "text 88022" that then candidate Trump constantly mentioned in 2016. See link. Others here have complained about that official number exhibiting that behavior.
Trump’s New COVID Doctor Says Sex with Demons Makes You Sick
She’s so subtle and unemotional, and that trips up Trump. But he recovered by bailing out on the next question. If he still knows how to dodge shit, he’s senile. His priorities are wrong, but he’s not senile.
Trump had a news conference and snarky reporters kept talking and he walked out.
I don’t have any idea what you people are talking about President Trump took action from the minute the virus was detected in the U.S You people are just regurgitating the Democrat’s talking points
us: please stop beating and killing poc with the authorities trump: *sends in more authorities to beat and kill poc*
Please allow me to introduce myself. I’m a man of wealth and taste.   Unlike Trump.
It’s always about trump.
Did everyone notice Trump running out of the news conference like a complete coward when the questions got a little tough? I thought he was going to break out in tears.
Since when? Trump has done nothing but give it lip service.
I thought Trump said the Trump Virus would go away all by itself. Like magic. Why is it still here?
In order to achieve victory we must have a cohesive national plan. Trump has done nothing but abdicate his responsibility to state governors.
Trump is losing the right. And the left &amp; middle. He is even starting to lose the wack jobs.
Trump will post anything that agrees with him. Even very stupid stuff like alien DNA proponents like the wack job Doc mentioned. What POTUS in history ever said anything without checking to it?
Americans have them too. They are called tv evangelists. They will save you from the devil if you buy them a private jet. The new doctor... she is somewhere in the middle. Trump needs a doctor to move his agenda along and she will use his legion of loyal nitwits to make money.
Why didn't you ask why Trump has not invoked the DPA to increase COVID19 testing, with necessary supplies? Call him on his lies about amount of testing, which is totally inadequate!!!!
Surprised that Trump throws and catches that ball pretty darn well. Let's focus on wearing a mask, keep 6 ft apart and leave the medical advices to the doctors.
I just realized that trump took over the heavens gate cult and this guy along with the NRC are it’s followers.
trump is making you guys surveilling US citizens as I tweet. I trust Biden over the trump syndicate.
Not sure if his the same trump I really think he got worse with power.
Four more years for Trump🇺🇸!
And now we know how Barr fits in with Trump and Epstein.
And Trump is still bragging about acing a 1-page dementia screening test that any normal 10 year old would pass with flying colors.
It should NOT be illegal for Twitch to trend words or hashtags that Trump doesn't like. #TrumpleThinSkin
Beginning at 10:45am ET Attorney General Bill Barr will be testifying before the  on the Justice Department’s handling of legal cases involving allies of President Trump and its response to civil unrest across the country.
Ya hes trying to sway opinions. No Trump Supporter leaves him. None!TRUMP!!!!  Biden is showing signs of dementia!  He is not fit to be President let alone in charge of a ice cream truck!
He’s on tv saying China virus when everyone knows it now as the Trump Virus
And with one tweet, he ensures that Democrats won’t be able to attempt to delay the election.  In one tweet he removes that option from the deck Democrats are trying to stack against him.  Donald Trump is a brilliant man!!!
Trump just lives in the lefts brain, rent free
That’s the American spirit again, Mr President Trump🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
Mystery seeds was not on my bingo card.  Trump bloviating on suspending the election was though.   All I need for bingo is a giant meteor or birds falling dead from the sky in mass numbers.
The election MUST proceed as SCHEDULED!!!  You, Donald Trump, do not have the right to delay it!  It was NOT delayed during the US Civil War and will NOT be delayed in the mess that is 2020!
Yo, you realize if there’s a delay in election that Trump doesn’t just get an extension right? The Speaker of the House  would act as interim president. While I think that’d be great, I think you should be careful what you wish for.
This entire scam was planned to get rid of Trump. The Dems don’t care about one persons life.
Let me ask, if it was a Democrat in the office right now, would you be singing the same tune? Mail-in voting provides a safe, SECURE means of voting in this pandemic (which, by the way, Trump has downplayed at every turn)
Thank you President Trump,  we need law and order in this country.
I’m just going to say it right now: both the democrats and Trump are wrong on their election solutions. Americans voted in person during the civil war, even during a pandemic voting in person is the best way to go since polling places will do everything possible to ensure safety.
The dates of federal elections are enshrined in federal law and would require an act of Congress to change.

You have contradicted yourself when you said that you were smart but you are voting for trump. Not a good choice
There's simply no way any sane person could look at what Trump is doing and see anything less than hate and evil. He is the worst thing to happen to this country in its history.  At this point, if you still support him, you are supporting this generation's Hitler.
Anyone who agrees with Trump on what he said about low income housing is a racist. End of story. There was low income housing where I grew up in a small, 99% white town and I lived there. I am thankful for low income housing wherever it stands.

Well they don’t want Trump getting any credit. He brought it up a few months ago. If they let it out there and it actually works like it seems to, he would be a hero. They don’t want that. Going to be lots of mad people if they could have taken it and weren’t allowed to.
Trump suggested it, that’s all they need.  It will take away the need for their miracle vaccine and billions of dollars for big pharmaceutical. Not to mention all the corrupt politicians pushing to not let it get out there. Someone might live. They don’t want that.

We love you Mr President Trump and the American people would get you re-elected on November 3rd🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
Are you asking why the DNC would tank a candidate that had unprecedented support in the younger community and was drawing out people who had previously been jaded by all politics? Because they'll still be comfortable and make that lobby money regardless of Trump's reelection.
#BarrHearing  AG Barr better repent! #EVILisOUTofTIME for Trump and all his minions to push SATAN'S AGENDA!!! God is on the way! They will be forced to #LETOURPEOPLEGO, that is POC and people of faith!
nOw IsNt ThE tImE fOr DiViSiOn!   I love how Biden and the DNC can make all the shitty decisions they want as they court the right, and it's still everybody else's responsibility to follow along or take the blame for Trump's reelection.   Nah man, make your bed and sleep in it.
Twitter has asked the president's son to delete a tweet with a video that runs afoul of the company's policies on COVID-19 misinformation.
The  is worthless and out of touch. They busted their asses to tank Bernie and get a dud like Joe Biden as the nominee, and now they're going to blame Trump's reelection on voter turnout. Sorry guys, this is on you.
President Trump shared multiple versions of the video with his 84 million Twitter followers Monday night.
Yiu must forgive him he has mental issues. Trump derangement syndrome

Yeah he gave a dictator validation. And what did we get? Nothing. NK is making more nukes. He is threatening the US. And he says trump sucks.
Pretty much what I figured. He was never invited in the first place: Yankees surprised by Trump announcing plans to throw first pitch without invite: NYT
The BLK movement is just another way to keep us enslaved,the DEM don’t care,they only care about your votes,they love it when we act thugs &amp; savages it fits their narrative,a vote for Trump is a vote for the BLK community around the world,it’s also a vote for Religious Freedom.
When you come out with the point of President Trump not handling the covid response rightly, it only shows how naive and dormant your brain cells are.
I’m happy this coming out now, most covid deaths were as a results of the doctors unwillingness to administer treatment to the patient. Hydroxychloroquine works and Mr President Trump was right about the drug.
Everybody that voted in 2016 is responsible for Donald Trump getting into office even if they voted against him. You participated in the system. You were part of it. Your participation was implicit agreement with whomever was chosen.
I AM NOT A TRUMP SUPPORTER in any way.   #iVoted4Warren   Just have to make sure that’s clear know how y’all get down.    But the way Trump Supporters are treated is sickening.

K thanks again👍😄 and trump isn't either🤔 who the hell are they then......
Considering the trump campaign has been hammering Biden with accusations over his record on civil rights, that would be an amazing about face on their part.
I honestly hope trump gets an Inaugural Gala to remember next year. And I honestly hope the headliner is Charlie Daniels.
President Donald Trump in recent days suddenly acknowledged the gravity of the coronavirus pandemic. Here's a review of some of his statements on that and more from the past week.
These states would lose House seats under Trump Census order: study   Count the citizens and give them representation. That’s the law. Sorry if that messes up the liberal agenda.

Reagan was the last one with some guts. He was just a tad bit more mindful of what he says and how he says it. Trump just says what most of us want to say publicly, and take the heat for saying it. Don’t know how he does it. I couldn’t🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
I hope people aren’t believing the polls. They can manipulate those to whatever results they want. So ignore those. I think a lot of people are sick of all this crap the Dems have tried. Their only platform is to get rid of Trump at any cost.

Trump is unhinged even more. Any talk of the 25th? To try to save the party and the senate? Not that it will help, but they might think it would.
You do not have to respect my choices but you should respect the person. Or at least not be hateful. Think about it. I don't like Trump. I have my reasons. But J do  ot hate him or say hateful things about him. Same with Biden

I live in this scenario. I can't tell you how many shacks I see drape with Trump signs who don't understand that he is just pissing all over them
I wasn’t a never Trumper, but supported Ben Carson, then Trump. My vote was more against Clinton than for Trump. This time it will be voting for him.
Brooooo why do republicans think covid is only happening because it’s an election year &amp; that it’s gonna disappear after n Nov. 3???????  It’s a world wide pandemic. You think some grandma in India who’s never heard of Joe Biden is dying to make Trump look bad?   😭😷🙄
I really think the Clinton's are masons and I think the bushes are masons and i even think Donald Trump is a mason as well, maybe obama but I am thinking these more the  jihadi type.

75 percent? Your numbers are very incorrect.
I don't like him because all he does is profit off people's misery. He makes himself the star of stories about unspeakable tragedies. If trump, god forbid, is reelected, he will make a movie about that, starring himself, and laugh all the way to the bank. Fuck him.

I know he is very generous and caring person. He has helped a person in my area. President Trump is going to make America Great Again. He loves America

You are insane. Everyone has admitted it’s true. The only person who doesn’t believe the intelligence is trump. Dear God. Go see someone who specializes in cult deprogramming.
And I also suppose you think that Putin didn’t put a bounty on American troops. Even tho all intelligence agencies have confirmed it. And trump was briefed but has still not condemned Putin.
It’s going to be a landslide, for Trump
This is Trump's America!! From the looks of it he is scrambling to continue to push #SATAN'S#AGENDA!!!! God is on the way, and they will be forced to #LETOURPEOPLEGO bc #EVILisOUTofTIME  #NoWeaponFormedAgainstUS
This video is literally from donald trump's America, but whatever. Narrative, I guess.
just asked a guest to give her evidence of how Trump is a racist. Her answer was Trump said a lot of people were trying to cross the boarder and he carried a bible.
I've never felt less safe, and it is pretty solely because Donald Trump is a egotistical, ignorant sack of shit.  Vote him out in November. Re-claim your safety.
Kung Flu is racist!! Donald Trump and his racist minions are becoming very aware that #EVILisOUTofTIME and the time for pushing SATAN'S agenda is up!! Repent for God is on the way!!  #EVILisOUTofTIME  #LETOURPEOPLEGO  #GODisontheWAY
Trump as a election ploy will now agree with the sciencetist on COVID Hoping you will forget everything his done before!
He basically gave the answer.  A conservative drives by house with a Biden sign, smiles, laughs, shakes his head and goes on with his pleasant evening.  Lib sees a Trump sign, 100% loses his mind, lights it on fire and throws it under Trump supporters car. Only half hyperbole...
Trump has nothing to do with my beliefs in pizzagate. I believe because of my own research. The fact that you strongly assume something about someone you don’t even know. Tells me enough that you hold ZERO value in anything you say especially political views.
He WAS involved and I’ll admit I think trump is so narcissistic that he wants to try to go down as the greatest president by putting a stop to the huge pedo ring.   I could be completely wrong. Just an opinion. But if Biden when’s we have 0 chance
Umm yeah..?  I’m pretty sure there has never been a president that hasn’t lied in some way shape or form. A lie could be as simple as trump saying he knows nothing about pizzagate. But then is secretly trying to take down the elites.   (Just an example it’s not confirmed)
I feel like this tweet is super unfair. I support trump and believe in pizzagate.   I’m not going to defend trump for wishing her well but I won’t support that it was bad either. I would say it’s very odd. He said he doesn’t know the situation with prince Andrew and yet he
And you are entitled to your feelings.I do not feel those who support either Biden or Trump, are bad people.We all see something different. My experiences make me see something others might not catch up on.Same goes for you. I enjoy our talks. And wish more were like that
After watching all of this it boggles my mind that none of the "Famous" people in this video have not been charged and prosecuted.  All of them belong in jail including Trump if the evidence is in fact true.  I ask why hasn't it happened?
Questions and answers about this unconventional, if not unprecedented, use of federal forces. Is it legal? What comes next?
Attorneys general in 20 states and the District of Columbia sued the Trump administration on Tuesday, alleging that new federal rules undermine their ability to protect rivers, lakes and streams within their borders.
Is it difficult to live without a spine of your own? What are you going to do when Daddy Trump gets voted out and is sent to jail for treason?
Ted, why do you defend Trump when he called your wife ugly, and claims your daddy killed JFK? Try not to judge, buddy .
I advocate for equality and rights! I can't stand Trump. I think he is racist and hateful. But, I respect opinions and the right to choose who you support. No one should lose their job for saying they support someone. I would be a hypocrite if I was for this.Plus he said such a racist comment.  “That Trump is making is hard for minorities to vote because of id laws” I’m pretty sure minorities can figure out how to get an id.

Trump could not speak like Bush or Clinton or Obama !  Trump is a joke
Yes! That will reverberate in Trump’s tiny brain. Plus Pres. Jimmy Carter’s message was included.
Great idea to hold a rally during a pandemic! Should weed out some more Trump voters
How can anyone trust the  federal government to lead us out of this crisis if the Trump administration listens to a bunch or quacks.
Hey Mika did you know Cain had stage 4 cancer? Yes he did. THATS why he shouldn’t have been at that stupid rally without a mask! Or not there at all! But according to these idiots tweeting, “oh well. He was sick anyway.” Trump has poisened the minds of his fans with stupidity.
How can evangelicals refuse to see genuine Christian belief like bill and Nancy and still call trump one of their own? Watching them you know they both genuinely have faith in God.
Would you have laughed had Hillary or Obama tweeted that? A lot of GOP people seemed to have developed quite the sense of humor since trump was elected.
Had trump said anything about the death of the head of Blacks for Trump? Herman Cain was the head of the Blacks for Trump organization. And nothing. So disrespectful.
The cost of believing Trump's lies: #HermanCain #COVID19 #NotAHoax
Federal agents show stronger force at Portland protests despite order to withdraw
This. This is what makes my stomach curl. So many things that were not presidential have been normalized by trump. And not this year but in 20 years when someone says well president trump proposed it during the covid pandemic. American's have short memories unfortunately.
please include Tulsa’s COVID death toll when you mention Herman Cain’s passing on  today. Trump needs to own this.
Trump was needed to fully expose the corruption of the GOP. It’s been said that every President of the US was in office at the right time for the right reason. He was the GOP’s karmic comeuppance.

President Trump mused about delaying this year's election based on unsupported conspiracy theorizing about the integrity of voting during the coronavirus disaster. No authority ! He’s always looking for an angle. #AmericaIsStrongerWithBiden #BLM
Democrats had no response to the pronominal economy built by Pres Trump, except "fear of COVID."  Must maintain fear, to continue devastation of small business.  Under Socialist/Marxist O'Biden policy, all jobs must come from Government. Small business threatens that monopoly.
Looks like a Trump casino
Trump floats moving the election on the day when the govt announces worst economic quarter in US history. Coincidence? I think not.
July Hospitals’ve been directed 2 bypass CDC w/COVID stats b/c of course, the WH is the most truthful, &amp; competent receptacle 4 that critical info. Trump’s floated postponing elections. GOP won’t hold in-person gatherings but demand our kids go back 2 school
I have an idea, as long as IMPOTUS wants the date change in his kingdom of Trump, can we have it next week?!?!
I thought there was 1 Trump channel and 2 Biden channels on cable.
And today reports of 23 members of black disciples street gang getting pinched.
This is where it starts. Trump will refuse to concede the election and refuse to give up power.
Obama’s radical judges?? Have you looked at who Trump has been nominating? Give me a break.
How can that be. Trump just said. President Trump’s repeated claim: ‘The greatest economy in the history of our country’.
You are tying to set up your excuse for loosing. When you loose you will need to blame it on something else. Like how you do with everything. I call it first. When Trump looses. He blames the Mail.

Trump is aware- told us in the very first press conference. When he introduced FauXi &amp; Birx and said his Uncle Fred told him all about them.

Ok so keep them on the federal court steps and no further. But that's not the message trump wants to send.
Four years ago, a friend asked me if I thought all Trump supporters were racist. My response was “Maybe not, but they certainly don’t care if their leaders are. They’ve decided racism is fine with them.”  Still true except maybe for the “maybe not” part.
Don’t think Trump has handled US poorly at all. Interested to know where you are getting this from?  Also, the race to cure COVID can only be achieved in a capitalism type market. Rely on the govt to find cure for COVID? 😂

No. His incompetence cost lives. People were dying while he called it a “liberal hoax”. Your whole “I’m not married to a party” act is a joke. Your talking points are text book Trump supporter.  Just be yourself and stop pretending you care. It’s easier for all of us.

overblown, overreaching, Democrat run Federal Government. AFFH was put in place by O'Bidens, but Trump never enforced it.  Feds take over zoning in your towns, they force low income housing in your neighborhood, then force citizens to pay for it.  Fair housing will require a mix
That’s why we elect mayors and governors to manage their own states. Let say Trump is the CEO of the corporation The United States. We have 50 states we will call them divisions of the corporation. 50 managers we will call them governors. The CEO should fire them all.

Don't vote for Biden. Don't vote for Trump.  vote for who you want and reject the made up, yet overwhelmingly popular idea of a 2 party system.  but especially make sure you vote for the house and the senate conscientiously, they matter way more than the rapists on the ballot.
So after helping trump get reelected, he then takes away the vote without any checks what so ever, (the rich get richer and without the vote, the poor get even poorer) That's exactly why we revolted against Britain, extensive taxes without the vote

How can other countries take trump seriously when he still refuses to take either the "hidden virus" or "the outcry demanding justice" seriously
In the same way our founding fathers thought, first things first, postponing the question of slavery in order to get unity for a Declaration of independence, we also have to get rip of trump first. It won't be easy, not with his voter suppression and foreign hackers

So this is what winning looks like under Trump's Presidency.   Yep so much winning.   US economy posts its worst drop on record
Trump is already attempting to take control of every branch of the government. It's as obvious as the nose on Putin's face. BEWARE OF TRUMP!!!
Trump could kill somone in Tulsa and his supporters wouldn’t care!
As he was a Trump supporter, will Trump mention Cain’s passing?
GDP is down, Obama is giving an eulogy, Fauci threw out the first pitch...Trump just had to tweet something so the media would talk about HIM.
Herman attended the Tulsa rally and got sick right after....hmmmm. NO WAY they are connected. I think all older and sickly Trump supporters should continue to go to ANY rally he has and/or meet in large groups to talk about how great Scott Baio is.
Trump killed him
People blaming Trump for a down GDP clearly don't understand how a world economy works  Or any economy in that regard   If you shut down businesses for MONTHS and don't have any international trade........surprisingly, money isn't exchanged for goods/services
Five states already rely exclusively on mail-in ballots, and they say they have necessary safeguards in place to ensure that a hostile foreign actor doesn't disrupt the vote.
Damn.... Trump - talking about delaying the election.
We should all want to do the opposite of what Trump wants!
Considering that Trump keeps inviting Putin and other foreign adversaries to interfere in the election, voting by mail would have the least amount of voter fraud.
Trump wants to rig this right in our faces.
From CNN: Trump floats delaying election despite lack of authority to do so Trump floats delaying election despite lack of authority to do so   ( watch out, Trump WILL make a move to take TOTAL control of U.S. Government)
The dates of federal elections are enshrined in federal law and would require an act of Congress to change.

Donald Trump gets more bizarre everyday.  I can't wait to vote him out so we don't look at him anymore
Change “coronavirus” to “Trump”.
Trump would still partake of both.
Yes and Trump is seeing it for what it is and taking action. We don’t need to have all those troops in Germany.
OMG! You're a HillBot. I am so glad she lost a Trump. Kamala is a Hillary clone and I HATE her for that.   I'll be grudgingly vote for Biden as long as he doesn't pick Harris as VP.
Yes! I was going to go along with the Biden thing because I want to get rid of Trump. But if he picks Kamala Harris, I'm writing Bernie Sander's name in. F that crap, I'm not voting for that bi%ch.
True but if he picks a running mate I hate, wanting to get rid of Trump isn't enough to make me vote.
We’re doomed with Trump and the GOP betraying the nation.
Saw a lady at Target with a Trump 2020 mask on and I gagged in my BLM mask. Whoops🤷🏼‍♀️
Please add Barr in there because there's a high chance he would infect Trump.
Who has two thumbs and doesn’t like Trump? This girl.      👎👎#NobodyLikesTrump
Let's hope he gave it to Barr and he gives it to Trump and Pence. 🙏🏼
As an older member of Generation X, I find this very sad.  I remember the dawn of the space shuttles, the rise of the internet, and the end of the cold war with great fondness.  We need to make more great moments for the next generation.  Maybe start with the end of the Trump Era
Trump is the enemy. It’s simple.
Donald Trump is a pussy! He is so afraid of Putin! Putin says jump and Trump says “how high”.   ?????   He is terrified of Putin!!!!!👙🕷🦟🦂🦧🦨
Trump 2020
Trump's new Doctor, you gotta ccx read  this
Trump’s policies are also helping Texas to record record numbers of new Corona virus cases as well as deaths. Maybe Trump needs to reconsider changing some of his policies.
Please President Trump don’t go there they are your allies. They are trying to get you re-elected   But they are trying to be truthful and sir you have made a mistake or two. Let them do their job and please keep doing yours   I believe you are wanting the best for America

Republicans need to stop pandering to a manifesto led by a maniac whose only interest is Putin.  Republicans need to put Trump's needs down and take up the needs of Americans. The people who voted their traitorous ass back over and over.
Thank you President Trump. We want are country back. You can’t have your freedom of speech when you won’t let others have theirs. And it’s not a peace demonstration as soon as you start destroying others property.
Putin’s puppets. The GOP and Trump continue to destroy America.
The year 2020 and Trump will go down in history as two of the worst things that have ever happened to the United States! Both a waste of time and space! #MAGA #WhyIDontLikeDonaldTrump #2020sucks #TrumpIsACompleteFailure
Only because building a new FBI building in another location would cost the Trump Organization money.

Thank goodness it wasn’t needed. Hats off to NYC for getting prepared and ultimately flattening the curve. Did all of that with little to no help from Trump who was still in denial mode.
Here are some interesting bios...
It’s called The Buck Stops Here.  Sorta like Trump blaming everything on Obama.
Trump has killed 145K
Trump &amp; GOP are getting desperate. They know he's going to lose in a landslide to a weak candidate so they're using socialism as a scare tactic.   Joe Biden is NOT a Trojan Horse for Progressives, AOC &amp; Bernie. 🤣🤣 He's actually an old style Repub. That's what is scaring them.
You know it’s going to be a crazy day when Trump goes twitter crazy before you even leave for work. Buckle up Twitter Family something big is happening.
No there’s no pmt due. Are you aware of the fact that the orange slime is ok with putin paying the Taliban to kill Americans soldiers? Probably not. The senate has been told  but trump didn’t know??? Just another lie to add on to the 20,000.+. He is an embarrassment to the USA.
Biden is a well balanced, caring man who shows America needs him. Joe doesn’t need groupies, we get when we have Joe, truth &amp; visionAccording to the polls America loves Joe. We need calm but mostly someone we can trust, that Joe. With trump, it’s been 3-1/2 years ofchaos &amp; fear.
Trump has thrown people into his administration that he knows nothing about throughout his entire term. It's one of the few things he's consistent at. And with an 88% turnover rate, it's painfully clear he's picking the wrong people every single time.
trump costs the US taxpayers millions every year because of his golfing on his own properties. Scum.
I read recently that trump had $400,000 from the campaign funds to his personal account. I wouldn’t be surprised.
The Trump administration said Tuesday that it will reject new applications and shorten renewal periods for an Obama-era program that shields young people from deportation.
I have never said, "Christ, Almighty," out loud so many times since Trump took office, and I genuinely do not believe there can possibly be a higher power.
Wrong...he said a "woman of color", not necessarily black.  It's my opinion that she will be black in order to shore up the black vote since Trump's support was high in the black community prior to the George Floyd protests / riots.
The so-called doctor Trump and his son retweeted lying about how hydroxychloroquine works also says alien DNA is used in medical treatments and science is creating vaccines that immunize against becoming religious.  WTF?   You just can't make this shit up.
“Demon Semen”.  Isn’t that what produced Trump’s kids??
Ask Trump to recite the first fifty digits of pi and he’d ask:  “Apple or cherry?”
You should create a video that’s just Trump saying Pocahontas over and over again
.So ? Barr could not benefit from Run-on  mouth of trump talking points! and eat up all their time!
I want one a baseball card with one of America's heroes. And bonus it pisses Trump off, that made my day!
Yeah how about we listen to the Hong Kong protester from a few months ago   "Donald Trump don't trust China, China is asshole"
They couldn’t. Trump wants it to go private. Putting funding in would cause him to throw a temper tantrum.  Number 1 rule. Don’t make the child angry.
That's really funny considering I hate Hillary Clinton And Neolib Democrats. I'm a socialist who voted Trump in 2016. So back the F down.
Donald Trump's re-election campaign is buying ads on #Facebook that spread dangerous disinformation about voting. Facebook’s business model is subverting democracy. Tell federal regulators to investigate!
Twitter has asked the president's son to delete a tweet with a video that runs afoul of the company's policies on COVID-19 misinformation.

Iowa and no, I don’t think our governor has done a good job. She is a Trump admirer btw.
If this report was proof of Trump committing treason, then why wasn't Trump impeached based on the information within the report?  Why did the Dems have to wait until something came up on Ukraine??
Dr. Fauci: throws first pitch at Nationals game  Trump: I’m doing it for the Yankees sooo... I’m actually their new pitcher... but I can’t nowww.... I’m really busy soooooo
President Trump shared multiple versions of the video with his 84 million Twitter followers Monday night.

Have you read the Steele Dossier?  Why want you acknowledge that it is based on lies??  Why want you acknowledge that Obama illegally spied on Trump's campaign??  You are brainwashed, that's why!!
Was he convicted of anything?  Was there any "smoking gun" of Russian collusion? Yet you think that Trump should've helped Mueller out more when the investigation was based on the LIES OF A FALSE DOSSIER!!  So you can take your Mueller Report and shove it up your arse!!
You're the one who said that I believe anything that Trump says (which I don't), so I'm throwing the same logic back at you.  You haven't denied your love of Obama, have you?
You worship at the feet of Obama. It doesn't bother you at all that Obama illegally spied on the Trump campaign because for you others, the end always justifies the means.  You probably take a knee and pray to BLM and Kaeperdick each night before you go to bed.
It was the same thing when John McCain passed. He hated that the Obama’s were welcome but he wasn’t. Ohhhh—OBAMA!!😤😖😤😩😢😭 Trump wants a RING!🍊🤡💩🤬🤷🏻‍♀️🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊☮️❄️
I've read parts but why would I read something in its complete entirety that's based on a false dossier.  Why would I believe someone who is part of the deep state apparatus and is a sworn enemy of Trump?
How many Russians did Obama or Bush kill? What did the coward Obama do when Assad crossed his "red line".  Here's how Trump responded and how many Russians he killed:
I honestly can say, I’m beyond disappointed that we’ve continued to wait for the system to work &amp; remove him, yet nothing. Trump is using the system to commit his crimes. Had the system worked, most of the 150k would still be alive &amp; we would have barely heard about Covid-19.
How is Trump a traitor?  I understand that you may not like him, or even hate him, but exactly how has he committed treason???
Trump virus,  That's what we should call it.😠😠😠😠
The attorney general will also touch on other controversies that have shadowed his tenure, including his handling of the investigation into Trump campaign ties to Russia.
President Donald Trump's national security adviser, Robert O'Brien, has tested positive for the coronavirus — making him the highest-ranking official to test positive so far.
Saying this on Twitter is not going to make trump win but it will kill people.  signed a recovered Covid patient whose doctor Agreed that it won't work and it's dangerous.
As an Iowan I'm ashamed of you. As a healthcare worker and recovered Covid patient I'm horrified that you would push Trump's lie that it works.
While that might just be a meme, I really do not know, I am sure that she has a trademark (from China) for coffins.
Ahhh, but Trump plays a mean skin flute.
Bring back decency. Rest in Power John Lewis. Trump refused to go honor his life. #JohnLewis #JoeBiden   “Joe and Jill Biden pay their respects to late civil rights icon John Lewis, who is lying in state in the Capitol Rotunda.
agreed. 538 gave trump the best chances in 2016 and polling was pretty conclusive that Comey letter was a massive deciding factor late which broke Trump's way which was the election.
Completely agree. It was great pre- Donald Trump.  Let’s go back.
I completely agree with Donald Trump. I too am disgusted by all of negative trending tweets. As Donald has had 3.5 years to do something positive and has yet to deliver, apparently the only option is to have him removed from office.
Sure, give Trump another 4 years b/c you are sore loosers.
Iam definitely voting for Joe Biden, there is no.way I would ever vote for Trump. In my opinion he represents  everything a leader of this country should not be. It may take awhile to correct the damage he has done but we can do it.  #ResistanceTaskForce

Is there a bigger shithead than Donald Trump?
Trump is depending on the pandemic to prevent them from voting  in Hope of more votes for him. That's why he's pushing that it's safe to socialize and return to school without becoming infected. He doesn't care if you get sick after the election.
Up to 150k now. And no more mask for Trump?  No photo op needed?
The clip of part of the border wall falling over during the recent tropical storm in Texas would be a perfect icon for Trump’s entire term.
I honestly don’t see how it’s wrong, he’s not endorsing trump bye doing this and it’s not even for him. I just think it’s funny how some people are going to take everything he does and blow it out of proportion and make things worse then they need to be
You lie to yourself. Trump or America. Fu if you support a traitor who has let 150k Americans die and us soldiers.
Do you have a position with the Trump campaign or do you just generally violate the Hatch Act?
Good. At this point the less I see or hear from Trump, the better.
Trump’s team will never get it. ‘Getting it’ requires a desire to understand a problem and skills to determine effective solutions.  Trump and team have opinions and the confidence to speak. They are talking heads, not problem solvers.
If Donald Trump questions the election results it will be because his election tampering didn't work.
Will MAGA MAGA MAGA TRUMP all the way
Once Trump is in the ground, I plan on eating 2 medium Little Ceasars pizzas and a 6-pack of Blatz then head to his grave and wait. Just sayin.’
President Donald Trump in recent days suddenly acknowledged the gravity of the coronavirus pandemic. Here's a review of some of his statements on that and more from the past week.

A chump and a trump
Especially if you’re a Trump crony! You ought to be in jail along with the rest of this criminally corrupt administration
The wind blows almost as big as Trump.
Has anyone figured out the exact reason that Trump is trying to kill off voters
Fact Check: Trump's False, Recurring Claim About Biden's Stance on Police  ( And NBC's KWQC in Davenport, Iowa keeps playing it 🤣🤑🤣🤑🤣🤑🤣🤑🤣🤑 )
Tens of thousands more deaths in the way and states still don’t have enough ppe or tests. Failure 100% Trump’s fault.
1500k and counting. And still no response to the bounties. Failure at a massive scale from Trump.
The point of this tweet (just attempting an interpretation) is Trump's use of feds in protests is being exploited by Dems and taking away from the BLM movement even tho Obama could have done way more to help protesters at Standing Rock. That's what he gets at in the comments.
I have a joke about Trump’s border wall but it kinda falls flat.
I have a Trump Wall joke but it kinda falls flat.
It’s another grift I’m sure. There has to be a way Trump is skimming money off the top for these WH projects.
He doesn’t need one.  Trump has one everyday again &amp; inserts foot.
I think putin us trump’s commander in Chief. He doesn’t want to make putin angry, putin may expose info trump doesn’t want out there.He might still be alive if 1) trump hadn’t held his Tulsa rally or 2) trump had encouraged everyone there to wear a mask.

Definitely trump
Hoping that trump is shown as much compassion as he has shown to Reality Winner.
I know!  She’s as good as that Anthony guy that “worships” Trump. It’s awesome. 😂
#OddFirstAnniversaryGifts MAGA Commemorative First Printing of a COVID-19 Death Certificates signed by at least 1 member of the administratio/Trump Family. Order Now.
You'll need pictures for Trump.... remember, he doesn't read much.
This is a damning portrait of the (lack of) federal government response to this threat. Some things are of large enough scope that only the US Gov. can address them -this was one, and Trump dropped the ball. Bigly. The election is a referendum on that failure.
These "stories" are only coming from Trump, so they can easily be dismissed as not credible.
This "joke" simply isn't funny. Maybe Russian bounties on US troops is also funny to Trump and Cornyn - they certainly don't seem to be taking it seriously!!
You’re right Joe Biden will try to get out of having any debate with Donald Trump. We the people want to have these debates move forward so we can make a choice based on what we hear
Someone tweeted that trump has a 43% approval rating from blacks.
Trump does not and never has had a 43% approval rating from blacks. Never.
Numerous polling places have been eliminated making it more difficult to vote. At the same time trump is attempting to stop mail in voting during a pandemic while he himself (and his family) have voted by mail.
Terrible you used a funeral to go after Trump.
That's trump and Epstein. 13 yrs old. Maxwell has receipts.
I find neither Trump nor Cornyn the least bit funny. They're shameful and embarrassing to our country.
Willing to die to keep Trump happy!
Twitter to MKs: Unlike Trump tweets, Khamenei’s ‘eliminate Israel’ posts are ok  via
Donald Trump should resign. Pass it on.
There is no changing the minds of Trump supporters or Q-idiots. Our only hope in winning is getting independents to step up and vote and for all democrats to vote. Our numbers are way larger, but we need to stay energized. I just like to mess with them.
Trump could not speak like Bush or Clinton or Obama !  Trump is a joke
Doesn't take a rocket scientist to understand trump plays the media, or figure out the timing of his "press conference" during Obama's eulogy
I have a serious question, when tRump gets out of office, do we call him Mr. President, or by his inmate number?
He only kicked him out after they had a property dispute, Trump was totally fine with underage girls. Look it up, he was charged with rape of a 14 year old girl. And I thought you Q idiots were banned from Twitter.
Exactly! Ask Herman Cain....whoops, nevermind. BTW  , Mary Trump said your father-in-law didn't know who you were until you blew smoke up his ass at the rep convention. I've heard of bad in law stories, that ranks in the top 3.
Great idea to hold a rally during a pandemic! Should weed out some more Trump voters
I agree with the racist part, not idiot. *45, &amp; every minion he put in place know very well what they're doing, how to do it &amp; how to get away with it. And, it's working. "Pausing" the election, abolishing the post office. Covid-19 was a gift to trump, great distraction.
It's really shocking just how despicable and desperate the GOP has become. Why don't they get serious about their responsibilities? Free and fair elections. Extending supplemental unemployment insurance. Mandate masks EVERYWHERE Denouncing Trump as he lies his way to November.
Hey Mika did you know Cain had stage 4 cancer? Yes he did. THATS why he shouldn’t have been at that stupid rally without a mask! Or not there at all! But according to these idiots tweeting, “oh well. He was sick anyway.” Trump has poisened the minds of his fans with stupidity.
How can evangelicals refuse to see genuine Christian belief like bill and Nancy and still call trump one of their own? Watching them you know they both genuinely have faith in God.
Would you have laughed had Hillary or Obama tweeted that? A lot of GOP people seemed to have developed quite the sense of humor since trump was elected.
Had trump said anything about the death of the head of Blacks for Trump? Herman Cain was the head of the Blacks for Trump organization. And nothing. So disrespectful.
The cost of believing Trump's lies: #HermanCain #COVID19 #NotAHoax
This is some good news. It would be nice if he would address Trump, and let him know that he has ZERO authority to change the election date.
This. This is what makes my stomach curl. So many things that were not presidential have been normalized by trump. And not this year but in 20 years when someone says well president trump proposed it during the covid pandemic. American's have short memories unfortunately.
This looks like a newspaper from a nightmare, but I'm 100% awake - so the nightmare must be Trump.  #VoteDEM2020
Is Trump selling ads in his Twitter feed now??
First your Trump interview, now this... you're on a roll!! Keep it going!
Where does Trump find these losers??? Is there really NO ONE better qualified for this position?
Monday morning quarterbacks, not problem solvers.  When POTUS banned travel with China, Democrats cried unnecessary, and xenophobic?  Good thing we didn't listen to Joe.  This is called a novel virus, bc it's unique.  President Trump has done as much as his office allows;
I understand why Trump is against election security. But I CANNOT understand why the rank and file GOP lemmings are against it - it's not a good look when you choose Trump's idiotic ramblings over good, sound policy.
The only threat from vote-by-mail is to Trump's re-election. Period.
We deserve to see an "x-ray" of this transaction to see who really benefits!! Insiders bought lots of stock, according the volume surge for Kodak.... Just another shady Trump/Kushner deal!!
Democrats had no response to the pronominal economy built by Pres Trump, except "fear of COVID."  Must maintain fear, to continue devastation of small business.  Under Socialist/Marxist O'Biden policy, all jobs must come from Government. Small business threatens that monopoly.
The real reason for Trump's election Tweet. Stay focused.
I have an idea, as long as IMPOTUS wants the date change in his kingdom of Trump, can we have it next week?!?!
That's because Trump is a callous old man who can't do the right thing seemingly ever.
I think a number of people saw this coming.... but scarily, Trump is still floating the idea. Too bad (for him) it won't happen.
Any vote against Trump is likely fraudulent, at least in his mind.
This is simply Trump's desperation in full view. It would be nice if someone in his Administration would let him know the date can't be moved.
Why does trump keep pushing disproved drugs as an antidote for Covid?  Easy. Either he or his kids have stock, lots of stock, in the company.  or  He forgot that he's done this already and can't think of anything else to say.
The CRAZY thing about Trump saying we should delay the election is the US GDP fell by 32.9% in the 2nd quarter. The largest recorded drop in history.   More than 1.43M people filed for unemployment benefits for the 1st time last week, rising for a 2nd week.
This is where it starts. Trump will refuse to concede the election and refuse to give up power.
How can that be. Trump just said. President Trump’s repeated claim: ‘The greatest economy in the history of our country’.
You are tying to set up your excuse for loosing. When you loose you will need to blame it on something else. Like how you do with everything. I call it first. When Trump looses. He blames the Mail.
Trump. No taxes no ballot
You need to pray to Lord Trump. That is the only god. The J in Donald J Trump stands for Jesus, you know.
'Unfortunately, HVAC techs don’t make great pilots but if this is an invitation to provide mechanical services in the White House or on Air Force One, we’re all ears!” the tweet continued.' #marketing #hvac #phcppros Air Force One PHCPPros
It’s common knowledge that the liberals are being pushed by an agenda much higher than your regular democratic American. It’s a super filthy business &amp; population control is huge with them. They know Trump knows and will expose them. This is your answer.
Isn’t that the same argument you used when you couldn’t pass your college English class, “I only failed your class because you don’t like conservative thought.” Between you and Trump I don’t know who whines and cries more. 97 more days til you aren’t relevant.
vote for trump if you have a boat.
Pssh, trump is such a loser quitter, bailing on Portland already. If only he’d blackbagged more hippies, or maybe cracked a few more veterans’ skulls, he’d be crushing it in the polls.
Great news for us suburbanites. Thank you President Trump.
Didn't Germany get hit hard in an economic disaster (and they're still paying off a lot of that debt on countries like Greece) caused by a repub. admin. Plus, both Pres. Bush W and trump drastically lowered interest rates to artificially stimulate the economy for their reelection
Mr. Trump -- we can give you a million reasons why "nobody likes you."  Lies for a start.
Yeah!!! Let’s get it done once and for all. TRUMP 2020!!
Yeah!  I'm going to take this handle, "Trump's Black Grandson's number one fan."
Our Lord and Savior Trump never lies. He said this virus would disappear “poof” by April and it has!  Don’t believe the fake news and dying people. These people are only dying because they are in on the conspiracy against our Lord Trump!  Donald Jesus Trump  Amen. 🇺🇸 🦅 🙏
You're a Bernie supporter and you're defending trump's secret police?!?     Bernie would be disappointed in you buddy.
The "fake news" reports (which the Attorney General agreed with yesterday) is that there is no credible evidence of vote-by-mail fraud.  Except by members of the Trump Administration who use old addresses!!
This was totally expected when Trump nominated an inexperienced donor pal for Postmaster General - this is the kind of shill that will follow orders and trash not just the election, but the USPS overall, which many people really depend on.
Loved when the dude asked Zuckerberg about trump junior getting suspended on twitter. Their aides must be Lincoln Project plants. No way they should be that unprepared.
I don’t see how any serviceman or servicewoman or veteran could vote for trump now.
What is trump supposed to do about a dictator that also turns out to be the second most powerful nation in the world?
No. His incompetence cost lives. People were dying while he called it a “liberal hoax”. Your whole “I’m not married to a party” act is a joke. Your talking points are text book Trump supporter.  Just be yourself and stop pretending you care. It’s easier for all of us.
That describes my dream, but Trump's worst nightmare!
expense.  I know, they promised to take money from billionaires and give it to you!  Billionaires have the means to take their money elsewhere.  Do you? They can't control billionaires, they "will" control you.  President Trump ended this crazy Socialist scheme.  Vote Dem out!
The White House/GOP SHOULD be worried about this - we've seen them fail at every turn in this pandemic. The country needs help, not lies and other nonsense from Trump and his crew. DO THE WORK OF GOVERNANCE!!!
Mr Trump :After see  missile farm
So Trump still hasn't offered any sort of "vision" or plan for his second term. It's great that he can verbally trash the Green New Deal - but where is any Republican deal of any kind? Especially on health care - his 2 weeks to unveil his plan is almost up!! (It was another lie!)
overblown, overreaching, Democrat run Federal Government. AFFH was put in place by O'Bidens, but Trump never enforced it.  Feds take over zoning in your towns, they force low income housing in your neighborhood, then force citizens to pay for it.  Fair housing will require a mix
Because Trump is a small, petty man. Period.
Watching TV IS Trump's version of "working".
Trump is simply a short-sighted fool. The world, especially Putoin and Xi, are playing chess, with strategic plans. Trump can't even understand the rules of their game, so he tries to play checkers, and even fails at that.
And if  biggest issue with  is that she voted with Trump too much, then they would be SHOCKED to learn that she voted against Trump TWICE as often as the late Sen. John McCain.
The only way Trump can get anyone to like him is by giving away money. Hence his big ‘Grants to Red States’ twit fest this morning. #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica
Jesus, it's not like Trump has gotten markedly better in 2 weeks.
Your still concerned about keeping the GOP in power. All trump enablers have to go. America is more important than either political party.
Nothing but race-baiting from Trump.  It will not keep him in office!
Do you want Donald Trump to "Clean Out Your City"? Will you "Obey" Donald Trump? Will you let Him Decide? Everything?
Trump will be in the White House attic tonight looking to see if any of those uniforms are left!
The killers are the same illegal aliens who crash our border and show up in American neighborhoods.  Do you think they are importing rapists &amp; murderers?  This is exactly the element, President Trump was trying to repel, not every Hispanic a murderer, but Juarez is full of them.
You believe, whatever Socialist/Marxist/Democrats spoon feed you thru a biased media.  Yesterday, President Trump retweeted a video of a dozen doctors, who appeared on the lawn of their medical facility, to announce the great therapeutic value of Hydroxychloroquine, &amp; recommended
Joe, you know the history and heart of this country and I know a political platitude when I see one. You’re full of crap, just like Trump.
How does the Trump Admin get away with stating they are not accepting DACA applications after the Supreme Court decision directing them to continue the program???
I think Trump likes that doctor because he's found his intellectual equal.
Trump has over 20 women claiming he raped/ sexually assaulted them, has talked about walking into teen beauty pageant dressing rooms &amp; bragged about how hot his daughter is! Creepy Crown 👑
I guess he thought praising Trump provided some sort of immunity.... oops.
Why TF would we do this? Oh that's right trump's capriciousness.
Sorry, but Trump is simply an idiot. Incapable of seeing anything in terms OTHER than $$$$. It's all he cares about - and he's very wrong in this case, those troops and the American facilities in Germany are critical!
Is trump saying he is ALSO waging a disinformation campaign ???
This is the logic of a 3rd grader.... "did the Taliban pay bounties??" --&gt; answer: "yes, but..."  Trump does not have the GUTS to confront Putin on this - plain and simple.
I really think nina Turner style progressives want trump to win. I'd guess about 25% of Bernie bros want trump to win. They can't govern. They have no platform except med4all. And I don't think half of them even care about it. It just some rallying cry.
I find it very interesting that within 1-2 days of the frontline doc summit promoting H-C-Q...  ...Trump announces Kodak will be making ingredients for generic drugs.  Hmmmm 🤔
This Administration is a complete train wreck. Misinformation, lying, tweeting idiot doctors who believe in demons and aliens, "needing" a new FBI building to protect their hotel from competition, and now going after social networks that have hurt Trump's feelings and covid mess.
"Other issues?" You mean like the upcoming election and what he could do to guarantee your re-election? That kind of issue?  Very important.  So, how do you like being a puppet, trump?  We hate it.
Sorry. I've given up arguing with trump supporters. I refer to those completely contradictory verses in the Bible that are right next to each other
This is exactly my original point, would we have been better off under British rule without the vote (like today under trump's rule) where poor people would have had to pay all the taxes, or is something better than nothing, something that can be built upon like Lincoln did?
...and learn that it's all about the might dollar for Trump. Not coronavirus aid dollars, but those flowing into his properties. THAT is his #1 priority.
I think the American people (via  ) may have to help us dig into the financial shenanigans the Trump Admin is doing with all of the coronavirus stuff - the "air bridge" and "operation warp speed" and investing billions into as of yet unproven vaccines.  HELP US, Stephanie!
I think Jonathan Swan does not need a "history lesson" from Trump on USSR -&gt;Russia! I also think that Trump is clearly ignorant about the world and what happens in it. No clue... and unwilling to stand up for US interests, clearly.
Democrats reclaiming "their" time?  What about my time?  I tuned in to hear Barr, instead I heard egotistical Democrats repeating their objections to Trump policy. Reminding Barr and the People, how important their time is?  How much respect them deserve? Gaggle of grifters!
Trump is Gassing Citizens that dispute him. Let That sink in.
“ Justice B. Kavanaugh urged his colleagues in a series of private memos ...according to multiple sources familiar with the inner workings of the court.”and now the #scotus is leaking memos and docs?! 😱
The question one must always ask with this Administration “ who profits when trump pushes hydroxy chloroquine?”  There’s ALWAYS money as a motive.
Censorship!  What kind of hearing does not" hear" the  guest? Twitter actually deleted Trump posted video, of a team of doctors who were pro Hydrochlorogiune, pro return to school.  Only lasted minutes b4 Twitter deleted?  This is not America, this is not free speech or freedom!
As a Trump supporter it really does piss me off when he retweets himself. like MF. No one of Earth has the right to do that besides God.
Heating up engines...
J Swan, Trump seemed cornered when he changed course on your bounty question and diverted to conflicts in other parts of the world like India.
there's a lot of focus on trump, but trump is not the source of fascism in this country, nor will removing trump end fascism in this country
if you're unfamiliar with the history of steven bannon and the trump campaign, he was part of the team who, in 2014, selected trump for the 2016 election

Isn’t he the one that brought a bucket of chicken at a hearing ?! And they call Trump juvenile 🤣🤣🤣
History will record that we'd have been better off if Trump had said &amp; done absolutely nothing since the outbreak of the virus, just twiddled his thumbs and sat there silently and passively.  Because everything he has said and done has only helped to prolong it and make it worse.
just fine actually, considering that trump's cult base is STILL chanting #lockherup everyday for the past 5 years!😆😆😆

Omg. Joe is nothing to us. He is a poor choice for a candidate and I would have loved to have Kamala or Warren. But. He’s still better than Trump and that’s what matters. Do. You. Understand. That. A. Turd. Would. Be. Better. Than. Trump.
There literally has to be sooo much money involved by the tRump family. and IT WILL be exposed at some point.  Why else would this group be SOOOO desperate to push this drug?  I hope to God someone figures it out!!!!
So after helping trump get reelected, he then takes away the vote without any checks what so ever, (the rich get richer and without the vote, the poor get even poorer) That's exactly why we revolted against Britain, extensive taxes without the vote

Okay, you convinced me. Say I vote for trump. How is that going to make things better?
It works.  Americans are dying because of the all the lying. I'm pissed about it. Either they don't want a cheap cure or they want to prolong this to get Trump to loose the election. Maybe both

Fauci Responds To Trump Tweet Accusing Him Of Misleading The Public  via
Which of them is feeding Trump his info??
Now do tRump sr
Mr Johnson, your corrupt party used deep state Democrats to initiate, without evidence, 30 investigations against President Trump; 12 Congressional, 10 criminal &amp; 8 state/local.  Amid this 4 yr unmitigated attack on President Trump, deep state Democrats trapped Flynn and Stone.
Or.... Republican questions are more like; “Can you get me a meeting with Trump, I want blow him.”😂 (Hopefully Twitter doesn’t flag me for this.)
New bill includes 1.75 billion for FBI building?? Wtf and 200 for unemployment..  recession, pandemic, racism,. Trump brought the fucking apocalypse
&amp; looting didn't follow.  These statistics are gathered &amp; published by Washington Post, not a ally of Trump. Narrative of systemic, police brutality is a lie.  A lie perpetuated by Marxist Democrats to create racial unrest. For God's sake, change the channel, you are censored.
And because John Lewis was Moral Giant while trump is an immoral little man.
Think abut the magnitude of that investigation.  All Democrat, Deep State Trump haters, using all the resources of the FBI, CIA &amp; DOJ, to find collusion with Russia, and nothing surfaced?. No politician in Washington could have withstood such scrutiny.
What exactly bothered you?  The only reason Barr is being trampled by this faux Judicial Comte, is that the 30 prior investigations against President Trump, failed!  12 Congressional investigations, 10 criminal investigations &amp; 8 state/local.  How many failed attempts at coup and

Watchdog alleges Trump campaign illegally concealed $170 million in spending
Under other presidents, Fauci gets medals, under trump he gets death threats
Unlike trump who misleads the public on every issue
With all the voter suppression, foreign hackers, etc. trump could lose the popular vote by 30 points and still win the election. Everybody must vote !
After all those people touched the flag on the casket, wishing an American hero goodbye, trump is probably scared he would get infected if he payed his last respects. Better to go golfing
He's not funny, neither are the rest of these Deep State Democrats. We are humiliated before the world.  Democrats make a mockery of our Judicial system.  We think Barr has done a great job!  We think President Trump has done a great job too.  Vote in person, don't trust mail!
Fauci gets medals from most presidents, under trump, he gets death threats
Trump is simply incapable of telling the truth. Full stop.
Sounds like Rudy's given up trying to sell the Brooklyn Bridge and is trying to dump the millions of doses of this ineffective drug Trump has bought with our money!   --&gt; Can we investigate the spending of the Admin on this "project warp speed" - I bet some cronies did very well!
People have known who Trump is for many years - he's a cheat and a liar. Anyone who believed he could run a country was (and still is) lying to themselves. But we are all paying the price for his incompetence now.
These idiotic (and overtly political) attacks on Fauci should demonstrate to EVERY VOTER how ignorant, incompetent and murderous Trump is. HE DOESN'T CARE IF WE DIE - as long as his poll numbers improve. That's not a leader - it's a dangerous fool.
And the building is in close proximity to a Trump property. Grift.
Dems get all of their schemes from their own playbook.  If they accuse Pres Trump of doing anything, you can bet they are speaking from party experience.  It's projection, it's camouflage and it's corrupt. No politician in Washington, could have withstood such scrutiny or attack.
trump's new tone is pretending to care and take the hidden virus seriously, even while his top scientific advisor keeps getting death threats
The East German military refusing to follow orders to attack and hurt demonstrators is what led to the fall of the Berlin Wall. Of course, trump's contractors in Portland are not military
The irony is that Trump has made America a 3rd world country. Pandemic killing 1,000 people each day, double digit unemployment, secret police squads grabbing people off the streets
So, think that Trump, as man who admitted that he never kids, was kidding?
And they did and said nothing. How shameful is Madam Speaker. Trump 2020
I will support the Lincoln project til the election, but they are still republicans. I do not agree politically with republicans at all, except for wanting tRump gone.
But after all the people touched the flag, wishing an American Hero goodbye, then if trump goes and pays his respects, he might get sick from the "hidden virus." Better to stay safe in his bunker
The founding fathers only succeeded in getting all the states to ratify the Declaration of Independence by saying "first things first" by postponing the question of slavery. With foreign hackers and voter suppression, trump will be hard to beat. We have to say first things first
That's almost as much as the 3 miles of wall that trump built on the southern boarder. And considering that a hurricane knocked a lot of the shoddy built wall down, the Whites House's wall is undoubtedly longer
When Trump’s fake presidency is over all his appointments and executive orders need to be reversed immediately starting with that lying rapist Brett Kavanaugh.
How can other countries take trump seriously when he still refuses to take either the "hidden virus" or "the outcry demanding justice" seriously
In the same way our founding fathers thought, first things first, postponing the question of slavery in order to get unity for a Declaration of independence, we also have to get rip of trump first. It won't be easy, not with his voter suppression and foreign hackers
So are us blue staters.  Stay in your red state and enjoy the trump virus.
I’ve been down so many rabbit holes, remind me tomorrow if this happens but it’s convincing if the trump    is true?
Video Idea- Just tRump making statements that are indisputably False with no sound track or commentary. We should See him unflinchingly Lie so people will see how easily he does it.  His credibility needs to be Shredded. All he has is Lies to run on. Defang Him.

Just don’t be over confident on winning, Last 2018 who knows Crazy Nancy would win and became speaker of the house? We all should be diligent and pay attention of what might happen otherwise we will lose this country to communists if Trump lose!

I don't even care what his excuse is - he's an asshole for not going to pay tribute to John Lewis. On second thought, Trump isn't good enough to stand in front of Lewis' casket in the Capitol.
Sounds like the same suck up lines he says to Trump.
Donald Trump you say that people that demonstrate hate their country. Who hates their country more than a man who dodged the draft five times during the Vietnam war. Look in the mirror Donald!!! And thank you for not polluting John Lewis’s public viewing in the capitol building!!
Is your only job kissing Trump’s ass? What are you going to do after November 3rd when we vote his ass out. The entire 3.5 years has been a disaster and his mishandling of Covid shows he is inept at handling any real crisis.Plus he said such a racist comment.  “That Trump is making is hard for minorities to vote because of id laws” I’m pretty sure minorities can figure out how to get an id.
TRUMP VIRUS 🦠 Killed this Man who beat stage 4 CANCER
If Trump knows the Trump Corona Virus why don’t we have a national plan to combat it? Instead Trump abdicated his responsibility and passed it off to the states.
All Trump did was put Trump first.
Part of me feels like the bar dropped so far that we’re going to always hold the president in lesser regard because he/she isn’t Trump.
Remember what Rick Wilson said "What ever Trump touches dies"
Republicans and Trump have to worry that most of its supporters won’t show up on             November /03/20   , because he keep insisting it will be rigged and much fraud in the election ! He wins by taking the GOP down with him ! Keep him saying such lies &amp; it will cost u big!
This needs to be said by all Republicans. Ads needs to play on this theme in all media forums. They need minority conservative groups to unite and be featured in ads. Trump won’t win with a twitter campaign by himself. He’s preaching to the choir.
No mask. No social distancing. No example for Trumpers. Didn’t Trump lose a friend to the Trump Corona Virus today and now he is endangering someone else?
I don't expect any different messages from the Trump haters.
Trumps administration has had no focus on anything. We just had the worst economic Qtr in history. We have the highest deficit in history. Trump has killed 151,000 from the Trump Corona Virus so far. Trump is by far the worst POTUS in history.
Trump is so bad he's given GW Bush room for forgiveness. But let us know when Dick Cheney wants a piece of this.
Anxious to read your post Trump administration memoirs. Your tell-all book is going to be a page turner.
Trump supporters *volunteer* to sweep the leg.
Trumps margin of defeat will be so huge we won’t need all to wait more than 5 minutes. Then the National Guard will head over to the White House to remove Trump.
Trump will lose by the widest margin in history. Unless he resigns and has Pence pardon him Trump will be off to prison early next year.
Herman Cain thought it was a hoax too. He is dead today from Corona Virus he caught at the last Trump rally. You should go to a rally, catch the virus and die too.
No, they’re not. 95% of voters are confident with mail in voting. Trump knows in an honest election he will have a very embarrassing loss Nov 3.
No, the federal reserve is pumping up equities by buying bonds. If the minuted class ever got cut out, they'd dump Trump faster than the market would fall.
Trump killed Cain at his rally. Cain died of the Trump Coronavirus he got by not wearing a mask and not using social distancing at the Trump rally.
Trump’s swamp.
If only Trump spoke nicely too.
Our country is in DANGER! If Trump doesn’t win our country will be destroyed and I don’t think it would ever get fixed.
If we are at the point where you seriously think that some states may stop electors, Trump has already broken our democracy.
Wow!! 9 days is pretty early! Most likely was sick prior to Trump rally. He also had stage 4 cancer! So, GFY!!!
Yes! That will reverberate in Trump’s tiny brain. Plus Pres. Jimmy Carter’s message was included.
I'm dying for Trump to die does that count? 😂😂😂
Wonder if Trump world will consider Herman Cain a martyr, who sacrificed his life to please his leader?
How can anyone trust the  federal government to lead us out of this crisis if the Trump administration listens to a bunch or quacks.
Trump is so afraid of being embarrassed in the coming election (landslide loss) he is already making up excuses and trying to find a way to cheat the election for himself.
Trump doesn't have the authority let's move on! #VoteOnNovember3rd
Instead of asking  can we go to rural areas and ask Trump voters, if they like the idea of spending 20-30 dollars to send mail via fedex as opposed to cents with USPS.
Hey Mika did you know Cain had stage 4 cancer? Yes he did. THATS why he shouldn’t have been at that stupid rally without a mask! Or not there at all! But according to these idiots tweeting, “oh well. He was sick anyway.” Trump has poisened the minds of his fans with stupidity.
Donald Trump never wanted to be President, he just wanted to WIN. Winning is all that mattered to him, not the responsibility of the job. Being a winner is all that is important to him. That is why he is so desperate now. He knows he is losing and that is inconceivable to him.
I know that all these people can think for themselves, but it’s still infuriating that Trump has led his followers down this dangerous path during a pandemic.
The family can thank Trump for this sad event

I bet it will really piss Obama off today if Trump bragged about how he saved Kodak such a great American company.
Holy cow! He caught it after the #TulsaTrumpRally ? Trump truly DOES have blood on his hands.
please include Tulsa’s COVID death toll when you mention Herman Cain’s passing on  today. Trump needs to own this.
Trump was needed to fully expose the corruption of the GOP. It’s been said that every President of the US was in office at the right time for the right reason. He was the GOP’s karmic comeuppance.

An 1845 federal law placed the date of the election the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November. The president does not have the authority to change the date; see you at the pollls on November 3rd, Trump.
Herman Cain went to a Trump rally without wearing a mask. His death could have been prevented if he had listened to experts and not had followed blind  propaganda.
President Trump mused about delaying this year's election based on unsupported conspiracy theorizing about the integrity of voting during the coronavirus disaster. No authority ! He’s always looking for an angle. #AmericaIsStrongerWithBiden #BLM

Thank you Trevor Noah for making us laugh and getting all the information out to us regardless of what it might of been for example Covid, Trump etc ... you are the man👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾
There will come a time - and very soon - when republicans will realize that hijacking of the party by Trump was similar to a corporate hostile takeover where person taking over the company has no interest or sympathy for the company or its employees/members. Will be too late.
I can't speak for everyone here but what I can tell you is that my post is about the official "text 88022" that then candidate Trump constantly mentioned in 2016. See link. Others here have complained about that official number exhibiting that behavior.
Yeah, great idea, KellyAnne, to have Trump do his daily circus shows again!  You're giving Biden TONS of ammo!  :D
It’ll get you some trump steaks
Trump had a news conference and snarky reporters kept talking and he walked out.
Biden will win the rust belt for sure.  Florida, Arizona, and North Carolina will be very, very close, but out of those three, AZ will most likely go to Biden.  Georgia will be one of the worst BG states for suppression and I think Trump will win GA solidly
Don't vote for Biden. Don't vote for Trump.  vote for who you want and reject the made up, yet overwhelmingly popular idea of a 2 party system.  but especially make sure you vote for the house and the senate conscientiously, they matter way more than the rapists on the ballot.
us: please stop beating and killing poc with the authorities trump: *sends in more authorities to beat and kill poc*
Surprising no one ...
Trump: I want to gas peaceful protesters  Biden: No, 𝑰 want to gas peaceful protesters
It works.  Americans are dying because of the all the lying. I'm pissed about it. Either they don't want a cheap cure or they want to prolong this to get Trump to loose the election. Maybe both
Did everyone notice Trump running out of the news conference like a complete coward when the questions got a little tough? I thought he was going to break out in tears.
Since when? Trump has done nothing but give it lip service.
I thought Trump said the Trump Virus would go away all by itself. Like magic. Why is it still here?
In order to achieve victory we must have a cohesive national plan. Trump has done nothing but abdicate his responsibility to state governors.
Trump is losing the right. And the left &amp; middle. He is even starting to lose the wack jobs.
Trump will post anything that agrees with him. Even very stupid stuff like alien DNA proponents like the wack job Doc mentioned. What POTUS in history ever said anything without checking to it?
Your pants are not a bra
The US never had a "right" to lead the free world.  For a time, it had the *privilege* of leading the free world, a privilege earned by its promotion of ideals and policies that many countries found admirable.  That's obviously no longer the case, and Trump is part of why.
Trump the Crybaby in Chief. Barr the rudolf Hess of America!
Or.... Republican questions are more like; “Can you get me a meeting with Trump, I want blow him.”😂 (Hopefully Twitter doesn’t flag me for this.)
Not sure if his the same trump I really think he got worse with power.
And Trump isn’t?
Trump is despicable
And now we know how Barr fits in with Trump and Epstein.
'These are his people': inside the elite border patrol unit Trump sent to Portland
It makes a difference who he picks. If he values what’s left of this country he will pick a unity candidate as VP to unite the Democratic Party.  A United Party is the only hope we have left. It’s better than a total dictatorship by Trump.

Trump's announcement he was throwing the first pitch at a Yankees game surprised staff, as it was never scheduled. Hallucinations keep coming.  may need to take the reins. #AmericaIsStrongerWithBiden #BlackLivesMatter
This has nothing to so with Trump. There is very little reason to do mass mail in voting. If people can riot, protest, shop, go out to eat, etc they can go vote. 🤷‍♀️
Not surprising. Barr is a clever lawyer and Trump is an idiot.

whether or not people are tarred by Trumpism ought to depend on what they do about Trumpism.  When folks oppose Trump it isn't subtle.  One way of reading  's point is that such opposition at least in the GOP is by a wide margin the exception and not the rule.
Beginning at 10:45am ET Attorney General Bill Barr will be testifying before the  on the Justice Department’s handling of legal cases involving allies of President Trump and its response to civil unrest across the country.

Ya hes trying to sway opinions. No Trump Supporter leaves him. None!
The FBI planned to relocate to the suburbs and sell their current location to a developer who was going to turn it into a hotel, a block from the Trump Hotel in the Old Post Office. Trump blocked that...
Trump Announced, Then Canceled, a Yankees Pitch. Both Came as a Surprise.  What?  Are you 5?
I’m sure former Presidents will pick up the slack and will honor the passing of Rep John Lewis as it should be. Trump is a disgrace and his presence is about as wanted as Mitch McConnell’s hollow words.

And the fishermen who are trump supporters are calling themselves Master Baiters
Arguably the trump administration is the least corrupt administration he’s worked for,
The Iraq war turned me into a Democratic party member, the Great Recession turned me into a progressive, Trump turned me into a social democrat. The Trump virus epidemic is Turing Gen Z into moderate democratic socialists.
Seriously? Another report out today proves this drug is less than worthless for the Trump Corona Virus. Trump just wants to add to the 150,000 death toll he has run up.
Liberal privilege? How about being born into privilege? None of the current Trumps earned a dime. They all inherited it. Even our POTUS nearly lost it all needing to claim bankruptcy 5 times. Trump couldn’t even run a casino without bankrupting it. What a crappy business man.
All thanks to the left!! Trump stands for law and order. Not reckless riots, looting, violence, and death. The left has not only embraced that but has encouraged it to continue. GTFOH!
When Trump’s fake presidency is over all his appointments and executive orders need to be reversed immediately starting with that lying rapist Brett Kavanaugh.
I sent these to trump texts. My cat wearing a Trump wig. Does this count? #ResignNowTrump #iamtheresistance

What if Trump loses but refuses to leave office? Here's the worst-case scenarioHow do you know that the media is lying and not Trump?  Who made you the one who decides who’s right and wrong?

Trump lost the suburban moms..  Your facts are wrong...I don’t want schools reopened!!
If Trump knows the Trump Corona Virus why don’t we have a national plan to combat it? Instead Trump abdicated his responsibility and passed it off to the states.
All Trump did was put Trump first.
Part of me feels like the bar dropped so far that we’re going to always hold the president in lesser regard because he/she isn’t Trump.
Mexico will be putting up a wall to keep the Trump Virus out.
This is great. Out of 30,000, 97% VOTED for President Trump.  I have a wish. Let's reelect this great president.
Remember what Rick Wilson said "What ever Trump touches dies"
Just like trump. They deserve each other.
Nunes... Benedict Arnold..... trump same.
Republicans and Trump have to worry that most of its supporters won’t show up on             November /03/20   , because he keep insisting it will be rigged and much fraud in the election ! He wins by taking the GOP down with him ! Keep him saying such lies &amp; it will cost u big!
This needs to be said by all Republicans. Ads needs to play on this theme in all media forums. They need minority conservative groups to unite and be featured in ads. Trump won’t win with a twitter campaign by himself. He’s preaching to the choir.
No mask. No social distancing. No example for Trumpers. Didn’t Trump lose a friend to the Trump Corona Virus today and now he is endangering someone else?
The military will not follow his orders. Just swear Biden in, take the nuke suitcase away and govern at camp David. trump will find that an empty White House will become boring and he’ll eventually move out. The secret service for Biden can remove trump also.
I don't expect any different messages from the Trump haters.
Words. However most of the families that has a tragedy, will be at least 4 votes pulled away from trump
I may be delusional but come November the American people will decide. Would you like to make a wager with me if trump wins or loses?
Trumps administration has had no focus on anything. We just had the worst economic Qtr in history. We have the highest deficit in history. Trump has killed 151,000 from the Trump Corona Virus so far. Trump is by far the worst POTUS in history.
Trump couldn’t have upstaged that eulogy today if he called a press conference to announce he was resigning.
#America, you have endured many dark challenges and times of deep despair, without a doubt, TRUMP and his GOP enablers personify the most grotesque times in OUR history. When the sun rises past this moment, we need to take a LONG, HARD look at democracy. Yet, my flag flies high.
For every death from coronavirus and the people getting screwed on unemployment, the wrath of the American people shall fall onto trump and his republicans... so sayeth me.
And look how much the Republican Party has changed since Lincoln freed the slaves over a hundred years ago till now where Trump is a raging, fascist, racist moron and the rest of the Republican Party are in lock step.

Herman Cain thought it was a hoax too. He is dead today from Corona Virus he caught at the last Trump rally. You should go to a rally, catch the virus and die too.
No, they’re not. 95% of voters are confident with mail in voting. Trump knows in an honest election he will have a very embarrassing loss Nov 3.
trump wants for himself🤣🤣🤣
trump to follow
It turned into a cult like heavens gate. They will go down with trump without questioning his motives.
My chihuahua Ginger is all that and more. I think she could win against trump
Trump’s failure
Trump killed Cain at his rally. Cain died of the Trump Coronavirus he got by not wearing a mask and not using social distancing at the Trump rally.
If only Trump spoke nicely too.
If we are at the point where you seriously think that some states may stop electors, Trump has already broken our democracy.
Yes! That will reverberate in Trump’s tiny brain. Plus Pres. Jimmy Carter’s message was included.
I'm dying for Trump to die does that count? 😂😂😂
Great idea to hold a rally during a pandemic! Should weed out some more Trump voters
Wonder if Trump world will consider Herman Cain a martyr, who sacrificed his life to please his leader?
How can anyone trust the  federal government to lead us out of this crisis if the Trump administration listens to a bunch or quacks.
Everything trump touches turns to shit...
Trump is so afraid of being embarrassed in the coming election (landslide loss) he is already making up excuses and trying to find a way to cheat the election for himself.
I believe trump is trying to distract from the truth about the abysmal GDP ...but I also believe it’s no joke!!
Instead of asking  can we go to rural areas and ask Trump voters, if they like the idea of spending 20-30 dollars to send mail via fedex as opposed to cents with USPS.
Donald Trump just stood in the middle of 5th Avenue and shot somebody.  Is anyone going to say anything?  Show me that Herman Cain was infected prior to Tulsa and I’ll retract that statement.  Otherwise all available evidence points to an infection at Trump’s Tulsa rally.
Donald Trump never wanted to be President, he just wanted to WIN. Winning is all that mattered to him, not the responsibility of the job. Being a winner is all that is important to him. That is why he is so desperate now. He knows he is losing and that is inconceivable to him.

I bet it will really piss Obama off today if Trump bragged about how he saved Kodak such a great American company.
please include Tulsa’s COVID death toll when you mention Herman Cain’s passing on  today. Trump needs to own this.
Trump was needed to fully expose the corruption of the GOP. It’s been said that every President of the US was in office at the right time for the right reason. He was the GOP’s karmic comeuppance.

“Even in an emergency, such as a global pandemic, the president can’t circumvent Congress and postpone or cancel the general election. And it’s extremely unlikely Congress would move it.”
Don’t forget Herman Cain contracted COVID from the  Tulsa Rally!!  So trump is responsible ....
I would believe you if you can honestly answer these questions: 1- Is Trump fit to be president 2- Can Trump be trusted with national security and american soldiers’ kives 3- Were you right when you said Trump has learned his lesson 4- Do you believe DoJ is acting with integrity

It’s a shame you don’t demand info from trump with the same exuberance.  Like why haven’t you confronted Putin about the bounties on American soldiers?  Why are we pulling American troops out of Germany so Putin has a stronghold??  Interesting ....
‘Vladimir Putin’s dream’ As Trump admits he has not spoken with Putin about the intelligence on Russia paying bounties to Taliban fighters for the killing of U.S. soldiers, the U.S. announces it will withdraw almost 12,000 troops from Germany. #AmericaisCompromised #BLM
An 1845 federal law placed the date of the election the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November. The president does not have the authority to change the date; see you at the pollls on November 3rd, Trump.
Herman Cain went to a Trump rally without wearing a mask. His death could have been prevented if he had listened to experts and not had followed blind  propaganda.
Every single day hundreds of Americans are dying of something that should have been contained months ago.  The blood is on Trump’s hands and he doesn’t care, anything to get re-elected.
President Trump mused about delaying this year's election based on unsupported conspiracy theorizing about the integrity of voting during the coronavirus disaster. No authority ! He’s always looking for an angle. #AmericaIsStrongerWithBiden #BLM

Trump floats moving the election on the day when the govt announces worst economic quarter in US history. Coincidence? I think not.

Trump Floats Delaying The Election. It Would Require A Change In Law
President Trump doesn’t have the authority to a delay an election and this fall’s election will happen as scheduled regardless of what conspiracy theories he tries to push.
Trump *wants* to delay the election.  Let's tell ALL OF HIS SUPPORTERS it IS delayed  And those of us who pay attention to the current laws will vote as scheduled, on November 3rd  Can the logic-minded collectively agree that this might work? 😉  #DumpTrumpDayNov3 #DumpTrump

The question one must always ask with this Administration “ who profits when trump pushes hydroxy chloroquine?”  There’s ALWAYS money as a motive.
Not really.  But for Donald Trump, yes, yes, yes!
It’s true with trump. You say something, he’ll try and ruin you.
How’s you’re heavens gate cult doing trump?
Yeah yeah yeah.... same stuff different day. Lock trump up!
You have pushed disinformation on coronavirus since the beginning. When will you just go away magically?  150,000 deaths on trump's incapable hands gaming pandemic for personal &amp; political gain. #TrumpIsTheBiggestMassMurdererInAmericanHistory  #25thAmendmentNow
trump thinks he’s male.
The more you piss off Republicans, the more they will want to make sure Trump wins, just watch in November.

I think you want to blame the real cause, China, for all these desths, not Trump. If Biden was President the desths would be 1,000 times higher!
Liberals are so fucking scared of being proven wrong by Trump and Bolsonaro, that they rather let MILLIONS die when they had the answer in front of their face the whole time.
Thank you Trevor Noah for making us laugh and getting all the information out to us regardless of what it might of been for example Covid, Trump etc ... you are the man👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾
There will come a time - and very soon - when republicans will realize that hijacking of the party by Trump was similar to a corporate hostile takeover where person taking over the company has no interest or sympathy for the company or its employees/members. Will be too late.
I can't speak for everyone here but what I can tell you is that my post is about the official "text 88022" that then candidate Trump constantly mentioned in 2016. See link. Others here have complained about that official number exhibiting that behavior.
Yeah, great idea, KellyAnne, to have Trump do his daily circus shows again!  You're giving Biden TONS of ammo!  :D
It’ll get you some trump steaks
Trump had a news conference and snarky reporters kept talking and he walked out.
Don't vote for Biden. Don't vote for Trump.  vote for who you want and reject the made up, yet overwhelmingly popular idea of a 2 party system.  but especially make sure you vote for the house and the senate conscientiously, they matter way more than the rapists on the ballot.
us: please stop beating and killing poc with the authorities trump: *sends in more authorities to beat and kill poc*
Surprising no one ...
Trump: I want to gas peaceful protesters  Biden: No, 𝑰 want to gas peaceful protesters
It’s always about trump.
Did everyone notice Trump running out of the news conference like a complete coward when the questions got a little tough? I thought he was going to break out in tears.
Since when? Trump has done nothing but give it lip service.
I thought Trump said the Trump Virus would go away all by itself. Like magic. Why is it still here?
In order to achieve victory we must have a cohesive national plan. Trump has done nothing but abdicate his responsibility to state governors.
Trump is losing the right. And the left &amp; middle. He is even starting to lose the wack jobs.
Trump will post anything that agrees with him. Even very stupid stuff like alien DNA proponents like the wack job Doc mentioned. What POTUS in history ever said anything without checking to it?
Americans have them too. They are called tv evangelists. They will save you from the devil if you buy them a private jet. The new doctor... she is somewhere in the middle. Trump needs a doctor to move his agenda along and she will use his legion of loyal nitwits to make money.
Your pants are not a bra
Only if they’re old rich white guys who placate Trump.
Do you really that he is NOT! trump is an ENEMY COMBATANT potus in plain view...
The whole point of Jayapal’s questioning is that it’s clear that alt-right protesters and protesters that support Trump’s agenda too often get a pass while ones who speak against him or against oppressors are met with force.The U.S. Postal Service is experiencing days-long backlogs of mail across the country after a top Trump donor running the agency put in place new procedures described as cost-cutting efforts,
He might still be alive if 1) trump hadn’t held his Tulsa rally or 2) trump had encouraged everyone there to wear a mask.
It's been obvious he's a fascist, to Steve as well. He's just postponing himself strategically because now Trump might lose.
Obama's eulogy must have gotten under TucKKKer KKKarlson's thin skin like it got under Trump's thin skin. They both are lashing out.
Nice speeches by a bloodthirsty warmonger. Let's count his "contributions". War in Libya, Syria, Yemen, Ukraine, violent protests all over the Middle East, millions killed and many millions lost everything and turned into refugees. I prefer "bad speeches" of Trump and end wars.
You know who wrote a great book? Mary Trump.
Eh, this kind of lesser evil balancing act is how you end up with parties excusing people like Trump. Zero tolerance is the way to go, not “limited tolerance in ratio of how much I agree with them.”
The amount of negative Trump tweets on Twitter is absolute insane. Everyday on twitter, its always posts against #Trump Kind of makes it seem like we are living in the USSR when the media only shows Leftists agenda #VoteRed #EnoughIsEnough #MAGA #VoteTrump2020 #WakeUpAmerica
Wow  you’re going to let  make fun of someone’s bipolar disorder? What a disgusting “lady” you’re putting on your show. She’s already a disgusting racist, but let’s add mockery of mental illness to the mix. Her Trump-loving saggy ass needs to go.
I just wish this moron called President Trump will quit telling me what I know? everybody knows that he says about voter fraud with mail in ballots well I don’t know! it don’t tell me what I know you could tell you’re moron followers what they know but you can’t tell me.
Trump couldn't muster 50 GOP votes for ACA repeal, his executive branch takes everything he says "seriously not literally", and he might literally become the first R candidate lose among active duty military since like Bob Dole.
It’s not easy, but I’m going to keep it up. For at least 97 more days. Two hours every day in the lions den of conservative talk radio, trying to convince folks not to vote for Donald Trump. To put country 1st.  Catch the podcast of today’s Joe Walsh Show.
The most likely reason Trump Tweeted his "postpone the election" crap.
I mean obv when they say "vote" its against trump. its so dumb
Sorry you were laid off by the Trump Virus.
Here’s my cat wearing a Trump wig
I'm a mom. Trump is horrible for moms.  what do you think?
Trump WH Reportedly Ditched National Testing Plan in April Because Virus Was Only Hitting ‘Blue States’ Hard #SmartNews This story does not shock me one bit.
And Trump had a laundry list of things to distract from today.
and while that is hardly inconceivable, it also just doesn't seem likely. Nobody outside of his innermost circle is interested in making Trump a king, not at the risk of their reputations and certainly not at the risk of a protracted civil conflict.
Even Stephen Calabresi now supports this idea.
Interesting point. A couple notes:  1. Conservatives won so much from 1980 to even 2016 that too many got intellectually and morally lazy. There's no platform. We're a bit like seat belt-law people.  2. Trump made the GOP into a cult of hating immigrants and "owning the libs."
I parked my car in trump towers fucking clown😂
This Trump Virus is pissing me off!
“Until recently, I had taken as political hyperbole the Democrats’ assertion that President Trump is a fascist,” #Calabresi wrote. “But this latest tweet is fascistic and is itself grounds for the president’s immediate impeachment again by the House“
And kind.  Thanks to Trump, history will be good to W.
right, I'm just agreeing. Ultimately, I think the big thing is that so far Trump just breaks laws and people choose not to enforce them. It's passive tolerance of corruption, banal shit. Delaying the election would require decisive action in his favor, up to and including a coup
A bunch of people said Trump wasn’t misdirectioning us from the economic numbers with his whole “change the date of the election??” and but did he even get one question about the 33% drop in GDP at his press conference today? How many reporters tweeted about it more than once?
Trump Might Try to Postpone the Election. That’s Unconstitutional.
Mike these players have become a bunch of coddled wussies. I was a big fan of baseball. But with the kneeling and the BLM support, I'm done. Trump 2020!!!
⁦ I’ll clue you in, those aren’t Republicans. They’re not conservatives. And the leaders have huge debts to pay off.

In retrospect, Little's 2016 win in this Trump+17/Johnson+7 district in southern Dakota County is one of the more surprising wins of the night. Little is a strong candidate, but Duckworth is raising good money and partisanship might help him win.
Someone online asked me how the Trump presidency affected me personally/professionally. I lead international study trips and advise on how to get a visa to enter the U.S for a living. My passport is now worthless and the consulates are closed.

Joycelyn Savage was charged with the misdemeanor after she allegedly attacked Azriel Clary on Jan 8. at the 48th-floor condo the two women shared with R. Kelly at Trump Tower.
just remembered trump said earliy on he would rathe resign than have he taxes made public
The Russian trolls are out in droves tonight - like flying cockroaches. If you see a MAGA tweet, check the profile. It they have barely any followers, it's most likely a bot. People who have low numbers like 3-25 followers after 4 years of this fucking hell with Trump are bots.
So.. fake dossiers concocted by the Obama-Biden admin are OK?  But dossiers based on facts by Trump admin = evil?  Get your head out of your ass.
"leftwing political violence is Trump's fault"

The plan disappeared because trump was doing anything could to keep the positive results counts low. You remember him letting people sit on a cruise ship because he didn’t want his number to go up.

You’re another guy who has ruined his reputation for Trump. Thoughts and prayers!
Federalist Society co-founder calls Trump's tweet about delaying election "fascistic" and deserving of full impeachment by the House again as well as the Senate
Trump said that he would have a new health mcare plan in place two weeks from his interview with Chris Wallace. That would be Sunday. Look forward to seeing it
Why? Because you listen to Breitbart and support Trump?
Idc if you make fun of liberals or trump supporters it’s funny in both ways 😂 making fun of liberals and trump supporters is funny as hell just said your meme isn’t funny cuz it’s not accurate 😂
I think Mueller owes most of us an apology for not doing due diligence. Not pursuing Trump’s financial records was a major failure by Mueller and a dereliction of duty.
Neither point is really correct. Trump can flaunt some laws because the stakes are relatively low or the enforcement mechanisms are hazy/controlled by people willing to look the other way. That does not mean he can do literally anything, he has achieved surprisingly little.

Anderson Cooper: Like A Man Possessed, Trump Keeps Praising 'Demon Sex' Doctor  #SmartNews
This is absolutely genius from the folks at the Lincoln Project.  The true facts of Trump sound so made up for Hollywood when the get spoken back. This is a must watch.
I don't even talk to friends who are Trump supporters. Why the hell would I help some old white guy who helped keep women down my entire life? I know those guys.
Well Mike, I'm betting the Coronavirus victims, or the victims of ICE/CPB power abuses or the victim who was killed by some right-wing yahoo in Charlottesville in 2017 would say the same about the world you Mr. Trump have built.
High enthusiasm for defeating Trump of course. Plus last I checked Biden’s enthusiasm has increased substantially from a few months ago now that the general election is in full swing.
Plausible deniability,  can claim he didn't say that. Other users in his account did it. Trump did it. Trump hacked his account.  Nope, he's been bad for America and nothing has changed.   Trump knows all their secrets and is exposing each one.  God Bless Pres. Trump
I think about those early weeks of the outbreak, when Trump kept pointing to some study proclaiming the U.S. was No. 1 at preparing for a pandemic. That's just the sort of thing a real estate and business huckster would hype.
Trump is a sociopath trying to murder black leaders one at a time
When  wins in Nov, and the Dems take back the Senate, we really have to take steps to dismantle Fox News, as a news station.   It’s more dangerous to this country than Trump
No, Trump can’t delay the election  via
This Trump+1.5/Walz+9 district in southern Washington County was a special election win in 2018 if y'all remember that! Anyway, Bigham is handily out-raising Holmstad here
Trump’s destruction  of the democracy is scary- the complacency of the Republicans in Congress is just as DEPLORABLE
We can’t trust this president for a minute. This fucker and his team are up to something. You can smell the stench in the air. The election is in jeapordy. His base will buy into his bullshit. Trump respects no one, he’s scared of Putin, I wish we knew why to get rid of his ass.
Sounds like this is a you problem. I suggest you review civics and stop promoting trump’s lies. You’re in a cult. Seek help.
Singletary isn’t just taking a picture w/ the President for his den. He decided in these divided &amp; terrible times, less than 100 days from an election to appear to actively or passively endorse Donald Trump. So yeah. I question the f*ck out that &amp; yeah it makes me like him less.
All this happened 👏in👏tRump’s👏America👏
Last time I checked, blacks voting for Trump doesn’t scientifically mean they’re not black.
Oh, Trump is trying to lose too.
What’s even worse: It was SO easy . Putin installs Trump as his useful idiot. Trump drools for 3+ years. 50 million Americans &amp; entire GOP fall for this fraud. So here we are.
Get everyone you know registered to vote. Arrange rides to polling places. Help with mail in ballots. We must do everything we can to end this nightmare and vote out Trump and all his minions. God help us that we make it to January 20th.
Yep. Trump is disgraceful.
As opposed to ramping up infrastructure to ensure meeting demand. You can stop reading after words “Trump donor running the agency”.
Yet Trump was calling the Coronavirus a hoax not long ago. Hypocrites.
I’m going to put exactly that in my will. “Obama is invited and can say whatever he feels like. Trump is not invited”. Every american should add that.
A chicken 🐔 crossing the road would make a better president than Trump. At the chicken gets exercise and produces eggs.
I’ve loved Bush since Trump’s inauguration with his “that was some weird shit” comment.
I'm going to say what's on everyone's mind and probably say it just fine: Donald Trump is a gaslighting asshole.
In 1989, Keith Richards pulled a knife on Donald Trump prior to a show at Atlantic City. Now, 31 years later,  are releasing that concert as a live album and a film:

It should be really easy for Trump to catch human traffickers because he knows who they are already.
Yeah man, Trump just doesn’t whatever The Gremlin wants. I’m sick of it.
Trump confronted on his call to delay the election, gives HORRIFIC response  via
It all has to come out eventually. My guess is RU mob took over NYC after the Sicilian mafia was busted in the late 80s. They lured  in dummy Trump and his greedy family. Trumps got in deep shit financially through shady real estate deals. This was his way of paying Putin back 🤷‍♂️
This is crazy. Trump’s hissy fit with this long and steadfast Federal institution gives voice to the vindictive diversions he uses to hide his failure to lead. He’s only doing this to rig voting. Why doesn’t he just move to Putin’s guest house if he wants autocracy so badly?
Exactly. We are safe under Trump. Give or take a 1500000 dead people. And the economy is roaring, if you forget about all the unemployed people. Trump will protect us from kids and graffiti though.
Trump can declare all the emergencies he wants. But the election will proceed.
The Trump American Bankrputcy.
I'm not entertaining an Obama pissing contest with a child when Trump has, in fact, been president for nearly four years. Grow up.
Now the Trump is coming out in you. Wow. Nice manners.
Only reason emotional twats are voting for you is because you’re not trump. You will fuck more things up in your first 100 days just from forgetting to sign your name. Fear the silent majority. I’ve been a lifetime dem, but I’m done with this party. Trump 2020, Crenshaw 2024
Then those states do not get to send electors to vote for Trump nor do they get to have Senators and Congressmen.  Not having elections has consequences.
The evidence that Barr is working on behalf of saving Trump’s ass is right in front of us.  had  thrown back in jail because he talked about writing a tell-all. #RogerStone conviction was commutated because he didn’t rat out trump. Flynn is up for a pardon.
Trump is that house with the republican red roof
So many many more DO want to talk about it now!! 😀 The Great Awakening! Ya know, hydrochloroquine is said to also decalcify the pineal(third eye) gland. Perhaps THIS is part of the GREAT AWAKENING...Trump is brilliant!
Yes. Biden has more experience and knowledge of the world and the political system than Trump. Biden would at least fact check before he talks, where Trump just constantly shoots off with the mouth.
Every #CNBC headline goes like this: Experts question whether Trump is right.
Trump has been destroying America for 3.5 years and stealing babies from their mothers, BUT NOW THE FEDERALIST SOCIETY CARES!  FUCK THEM TRAITOROUS BUMS!
Are you *really* that obtuse? tRump literally dismantled the very protection Biden had in place to protect us from a pandemic. #tRumpVirus #TrumpVirusDeathToll150K
I get the feeling there is something going on in Kansas right now, yet it’s not clear what it is. Cruz, Kobach, Thiel, McConnell, Trump, Pompeo….lots of action for one Senate seat among many.
Maybe those 3 could visit Trump one night like the ghosts in A Christmas Carol and scare him into leaving the White House.
I guess. I'd like to know who wished for Trump? Let's face it even the Republicans thought that he was a Kook in the beginning.
In any sane world, this would be Game Over.  The Trump administration needs to be tried for crimes against humanity.  #TrumpVirus #TrumpVirusDeathToll150K
Oh look. Swanson boy is butthurt by *checks notes* Obama standing up for what Rep. Lewis believed in and civil liberties of the people.   Tuck tuck can go fuck himself. All that Trump has done for 4 years is campaign at his Y'all Qaeda rallies.
Reminder that Donald Trump doesn’t like dogs.   Only sociopaths don’t like dogs.
Donald Trump has cheated his whole life. Of course he’ll cheat in this election. Heck, he cheated in the last one.
maybe we should just get rid of the Trump voting cast members. Sonja, Ramona and Luanne? Times up
Trump 2020: My life matters  1. He only cares about himself 2. His supporters only care about themselves 3. None of them care about Black lives  I'd expect my check in the mail, but Trump Org would prob just renege on it.
I think the Trump presidency has made a lot of white people feel naive.
what’s the game plan when trump tries to challenge the election results? I truly hope the campaign is scenario planning because you just know he’s gonna try something.
Yeah that's probably also what most of Trump's business bankruptcies were like
Never did I imagine the day would come when Steven Calabresi called for #Trump's impeachment.
Does Trump come off crass when he talks, yes. He's not always the best diplomatic person when it comes to speaking. But he's doing a good job I rather have someone that speaks like he does then someone who speaks politically correctly and does a poor job.
It's kinda of like, I think Trump is despicable and that that is an emotional reaction.  However,  there is overwhelming evidence that can convict him once he out of office. Yet his supporters CHOOSE to ignore that, but can plainly see the evidence here. Crazy🤔
you’re enabling Trump’s despotic attempts to steal the election.

Wonder what he thinks of Portland?
Thats fine. But hes literally a male candace owens. Left the democratic party right around trumps election now they're all for republican talking points. I dont trust people who switch to make money. Candace had a doxxing site against trump then she became cons overnight...
And I hate that people thought that Trump was trying to destroy the Affordable Care Act. He actually made it so that more doctors would have to accept people that were insured by Medicaid.
This is interesting but fails to point out that Trump is close to Peter Thiel, who is spending massively to support Kris Kobach.  That’s important info.
This Trump+5.5/Walz+0.5 seat in northern Washington County is home to the Republican nominee to face Tina Smith in 2018, Karin Housley. She has a big cash-on-hand advantage, but Josiah Hill did out-raise her, which might raise some eyebrows.
Well illustrates how insane Trump &amp; co are...
#BlueWave I agree. We need to be a big tent and welcome those (NO MATTER HOW MUCH WE DISAGREE), who disavow Trump... even if he is a founder of the Federalist Society.
Now do Trump or even Jr.
Voters hear and understand this. Contrary to what Trump is saying and lying about:  There is NO difference between Absentee voting and Mail-in voting.  It is the same thing!!!! Pass it on.
Stop telling us you’ll be better than a Trump
just saying the trump one is hella accurate the one you posted here isn't accurate therefore it's not funny had it been accurate it would be funny anyways I'm done talking bout this, good day
Chris Hayes on Trump's flagrant assault on democracy: "The question of what the law allows becomes less important than what we the citizens will allow."
I agree. That doesn't mean Trump isn't hoping for it.
People need to realize that human beings do some of the most inhumane things in the world,  Jesus is not involved as many wish.   Human beings on all sides invent lies to prove there fault -  Trump has been doing it for a long time!   Being a politician is not being a CEO.

I think she just learned Trump is going to deport her.
It would cost hundreds of thousands lives. That is completely unacceptable--there should be no "battle" in that regard. There is nothing sad in that, as you suggest. It's called doing the right thing. Trump is sick, happy to send other people's kids to school--but not his own.
Yeah, all those pictures you see of kids being locked in cages when they were taken into custody at the border that was from the Obama administration. Trump did not have that done.
If Donald Trump could, he would step down to allow Putin to take over America and Democracy. Trump has yet to prove his loyalty to our Constitution and Rule of Law. He has a petty disposition that gives him the delusion that what he says is law. He think he’s our dictator.

What is not a hoax is Trump has to go away, I would suggest Russia or North Korea, where dictator's play with lives, like one would expect of judging angry god's that a lot of evangelists believe in.....
To be clear....that tweet finally hits home and effects him personally so NOW he cares. Too little too late. Good to note that he’s probably just as anxious to get trump out of here as the rest of us.
Except almost everything Trump says is a lie:
Half of these are googled pics, the actual meme are actual pfp's of trump supporters on twitter. Lame attempt at humor.
Wrong again, many of us have police officers in our families, and they want Trump out too. So you see your propaganda is falling on deaf ears.

Incorrect. No evidence they're refusing to answer. Is it only "Q" cultists still defending Trump on here? I guess that's a good sign though. It means the intelligent Republicans have mostly given up trying to defend him, mostly having abandoned ship. Good news.
I don’t think Trump understands reality or what a suburb is like... he was just stoking fears.  Maybe OP is talking about people I don’t know (ppl with money) moving to the suburbs... when I think about leaving the city it’s mostly cuz I can’t afford to live here much longer

It doesn't, the Constitution doesn't say who would become president if there is no election and January 20th comes (Trump's term would just automatically end).  Also Pelosi's term would also end, it would be most likely the highest ranked Senator who's term doesn't end this term.
So the faith we have had in our elections for 244 years will remain part if our fabric that binds us that makes America great! But Trump keeps feeding the fire &amp; this is our  warning that maintaining power is his only priority &amp; he will continue to ravage our country to that end!

If there is one thing I give Trump's presidency credit for, it pulled back the veil on so-called "patriots" bullshit. As he clumsily heads towards tyranny, they are in lockstep.

"Partenheimer said that claims that DeJoy takes directions from Trump are “wholly misplaced and off-base"
Yeah, she didn't. Not even close in battleground states. Biden was even up in Texas in a few recently, after Trump took Texas by 9 points in 2016. There's no way to spin this as "lol fake news" like a lot of Trumpists are doing. Republicans do answer the phone, and take polls.
Trump is doing his damnedest to destroy your faith in our government, the FBI, CIA, all of our institutions, Free Press, Free Speech ... and our election process. He knows he has no chance of winning unless he scares the crap out of you.  Don't let that happen, please.  VOTE.

Rats and sinking ships.  If this hadn't happened, in a couple of weeks Calabresi would have abandoned Trump for using the wrong dinner fork.
That’s true, but open borders are considered a more left wing thing and opening schools at this point is a right wing thing, so in trying to promote Trump they are just making him look like an idiot while Joe Biden looks at least fine by comparison. But yeah it’s a total strawman
This Trump+21/Johnson+6 district in Wabasha/Goodhue counties is another seat that the DFL is looking to get back after losing it in 2016. You may recognize Kaehler actually from his brief run for MN-01 this year, but he dropped out and is posting some good fundraising numbers.

President Trump's Strategic Advisor for Coalitions on the Trump 2020 Campaign, Boris Epshteyn, has written an op-ed in Newsweek excoriating Section 8 vouchers. Israel's illegal settlements just hit the campaign.
I didn't like him as a president for his politics, but he seemed to be a decent man. I don't like Trump as a human being. My dislike of Bush diminished once he was out of office. I will still hate Trump. And I never use the word "hate" lightly.
The odds are that he got it at the rally. Sadly for him, he drank Trump's Kool Aid. A five week lag between his exposure and his death. There are a lot of individuals being infected now that would succumb in August and September.
The majority are smart enough to know that four more years of Trump would be a disaster. Arizona is a hard-hit state for Coronavirus, and those of us outside the Fox News/Limbaugh/OANN/Breitbart echo chamber remember statements like these:
You are willing to sacrifice the lives of children and their families. You must be a member of the Trump Death Cult and your boy Trump abdicated his job of protecting Americans. Not Christian and Not Pro-life! You just outed yourself!

If the madman in the WH followed the pandemic playbook, accepted WHO tests, we'd likely be as well off as Germany now. Trump continues to refuse to do what's necessary to get the virus under control so the economy can restart. Virus first, then economy. Won't work otherwise.

This is accurate. Trump doesn’t have the IQ to be our president. There should be a 500 question test and 2 written essay on America and a 90 day probation period to be president. People have a 90 day probation period just to work at McDonalds. Why not for presidency? 🤷🏻‍♂️

This Trump+8/Walz+3 district in the Moorhead area is a pretty good example of a district that Biden probably outperforms Clinton in. A good margin here for Collin Peterson is also key to his re-election.  As for Eken, he should be fine in his re-election bid.

Must read. Gorgeous writing from my favorite journalist,  describing the terrifying, depressing world created by Trump. “November, not hydroxychloroquine, is the only real chance for every American to change our nation’s trajectory.”
Also, trump threatened to delay the election.
Yeah, but they lost. “Today, the House of Representatives passed legislation introduced by Rep. Lauren Underwood (D-IL-14) to protect the Affordable Care Act (ACA) from attacks by President Trump and elected Republicans across the country in the middle of a pandemic.”
Steven Calabresi, co-founder &amp; co-Chair of the Federalist Society is calling for Trump's impeachment &amp; removal after the election delay tweet. Time to back it up. Deliver 20 R Senators necessary to do it bc they won't listen to Dems. Rs are now trying to avoid an election wipeout

In February, I thought for sure it was going to be Trump, but I underestimated just how bad Trump was at being president. Since he's not going to be any better, and will probably screw some more things up between now and November, it's going to be Biden.
He died defended a moron, that was his choice. Trump misrepresented the severity, gave tins misleading information, &amp; then held an event in the midst of an outbreak. There's a REASON the Trump campaign made people sign waivers, they knew the danger &amp; lead people to death.
He’s better than Trump, he’s probably the best president we’ve had in our lives, but he is FAR from perfect

"Wrote this 10 days ago...almost nobody seemed to have noticed that Dems were trying to give the Department of Homeland Security $50 billion at the very moment Dems were issuing press releases pretending to be mad at Trump for deploying DHS police to cities"

She also was not the current president of the United States when she was making those objections. I think there's a big difference in power dynamics there, between what she did then and what Trump is doing now.
Another fun fact is that she votes for trump’s military spending bills, fast tracks his judicial appointments, and in general has done fuckall to resist trump except create iconic imagery exclusively for gifs and resistence libs twitter headers
To be go honest I haven’t been chill since Clinton. But trump certainly took it to an all new level.
I wish you were right Bernie, but you were the only chance for the Dems to beat Trump. There's no way sleepy joe can beat the half orangatan guy in the white house this election season.
The only reason we have them, IMO, is to stop people self incorporating as a mechanism to escape income tax (which is why Trump cutting corporate tax without lowering top marginal income tax was dumb). All the more reason to switch to a progressive VAT.
4 years of wasted Q drops and Trump not delivering the mass arrests you thought you were promised yet you want more.  The Q’s truly are a gullible breed.
I agree with that. It's best to hold both and everything is set. I also think it's possible that Trump is probably not the President to usher this in.

Someone give me one logical reason to vote for Trump. No emotions, no religious stuff, just pure logic and reason. I'll wait.
I love that you’re upset with Trump but please take time to acknowledge how wrong you were on President Obama countless times. You added to the unnecessary stress caused by journalists looking for attention. Repent.
Not sure I agree with your assessment (with our luck, Trump is immortable), but if true, then the logic still holds. The Dem VP, whoever she is, is likely better than Pence.

Herman Cain refused to wear a mask for months.  He attended a Trump rally where he was actively encouraged not to wear a mask.  He contracted COVID-19, likely at that rally, and, today, he passed away.   How are there people still not taking this pandemic seriously?

As with Covid testing,for example? Trump has zero credulity
The fact that he would even consider voting for Trump after what he's seen and been exposed to in Congress is baffling. He's probably just afraid to say he's voting for Biden because he doesn't want to get tweeted about. How weak.
I am extremely surprised that we may have actually found a red line for trump today
Most of us love America. Obama loved America. Trump does, too. The protesters do. The tea party does. Is it hard to think we just have different dreams for what America can be? This country has ALWAYS been about progress and change one way or another, please don't forget that.

Right on cue, wouldn’t you agree Trump suggesting delaying the election is another uniquely bad thing from him?
If Trump loses he will surely claim it was a fraudulent election. I think how republicans in Congress respond to these claims will be more important. If they stick with Trump and FNC it would give him more credibility and make the situation much worse.
Problem is, I think many blame Trump for allowing this all to happen on his watch.
You mean for government to create more incentive for startups and entrepreneurship.  I don't see argument here, I think there's general concensus among most people that this is what is supposed to be happening.  In fact that is what Trump administration trying to do.

All the years I have voted 30 years I have never seen any discrimination at the polling places. You must be in a different country. GO PRESIDENT TRUMP.
Dr. Stella Immanuel, who runs an 11-month-old medical clinic out of a Houston strip mall next door to her ministry, publicly “double dog dared” CNN anchors and Fauci to provide her with urine samples to prove they weren’t taking hydroxychloroquine.
I thought he caught the Coronavirus from Trump’s own droplets
A few people have asked why the picture in my first tweet shows that Trump tweeted this at 9:22 p.m. No, it isn't a tweet from the future! I grabbed the image from  not realizing it showed Ireland's time zone. Here's Trump's tweet with a U.S. Central time stamp.
Some Trump supporters think he was sent by God, and because so many of them refuse to wear masks, a lot of them are now able to thank God personally.
I guess he’s not afraid of Trump for now.
Yo we should do a triva just based on iac triva. Like who said it. Trump or ......😬😅🤣
From the way City of Chicago and Chicago Public Schools are terribly handling everything right now to everything that continues to come from Trump, I just can’t. The disregard for actual human life is just too much right now.
For his last trick, Trump will try to convince us that the Constitution is a hoax.
Trump, the GOP and Mr Cain are all responsible
Hoping that trump is shown as much compassion as he has shown to Reality Winner.
John Kass’ persecution complex is now reaching Trump levels.
Please, God 🙏🙏🙏🙏 Why Trump Might Quit:  #sayyourprayers
Buddy, we've been in Afghanistan all four years of the Trump presidency.  Wake up.
Is the FBI building you are planning to spend billions on to help Trump’s hotel make money fall in there?  Hmmm ... nope sounds like more crooked Mitch lining Trump’s pockets with federal spending again. #GOPCorruptionOverCountry  #MoscowMich
His 15 minutes were over long ago.
The Nightmare on Pennsylvania Avenue
On Thursday, however, they decisively broke with Trump over postponing the Nov. 3 election, which Trump floated as a way to guard against what he says is the danger of vote-by-mail fraud.
Lol not connecting the dots. Those so called connections rely on Trump getting reelected if that's the case.
Ordered a Mail-in ballot just as a fuck Trump.
Lady bye...i can ask you the same question as to why black people are "shuckin and jivin" for tRump... oh wait he pardon you, he did you a favor right?
Trump Supporters are disgusting.
Prosecutors in New York (and elsewhere) should quietly signal to Trump that they will not prosecute him for past crimes if he quits the presidency and agrees not to run this year. Pence should pardon him.  It's time for our long national nightmare to end.
How about stand up to him and the GOP? How about call him out and be blunt? Jesus fuck why is it men like you always turn out to be such spineless cowards. Men like you, who can't imagine getting right in someone's face are why we have Trump.
I don’t believe trump has any friends, just co-conspirators and a bunch of cans of Goya beans.
Trump and Barr will simply DO it, half the country will cheer, and the other half will dither about how they can't do anything.
What a tremendous burden it must be for you to still be defending Donald Trump
Explains why we got first glimpse of McConnell turning on trump.
The thing about this piece is it is so extraordinarily stupid that I kinda believe it was a sincere effort by the officially designated failure of the Trump family
Donald Trump's COVID-19 pandemic has revealed how much children need access to holistic supports— counselors, nurses, community outreach workers needed for socio-emotional support. On August 3, join the movement to #DemandSafeSchools #EdEquityOrElse - &gt;
Trump going down fa being one of tha biggest gangstas we seen idgaf wat nobody talm bout🤷🏿‍♂️
C’mon, it was just a joke tweet (per Cornyn) but we’ll still have the DOJ weigh in on it’s legality, just In case........  Has the Trump WH and GOP ever have a unified message on anything?
YOU WILL BE RETIRED IT WILL GIVE YOU SOMETHING TO DO. GO PRESIDENT TRUMP.
Well said, Annette! I got a Twitter account as a blood pressure lowering device. With Trump out of office, I’m not worried about national safety, mass death and starvation. I’ll drop it when Biden wins.
I know!  She’s as good as that Anthony guy that “worships” Trump. It’s awesome. 😂
That would explain Trump's 32% approval over his handling of coronavirus, yes.
Trump didn't event show up.
Part of your purchase went to support the trump campaign
Indeed. Point taken. I was merely comparing skillfulness and patriotism (in jest), both of which Louis XIV wins by a large margin over Trump.
This study, conducted in Chicago, suggests that children are potentially extremely virulent spreaders of COVID-19. It's a shame the science can't stand in the way of schools reopening. That might make Trump look bad, so there needs to be lots more suffering and death.
BS. Trump repeatedly whines, lies, throws tantrums, hates it when people disagree with him, etc. He's threatening to delay the election despite not having the authority to do so. He's also a racist.
We have a way to contact the attendees of the trump rally, they registered with email. Problem is, the administration would never allow it to get looked into, even if it would provide a public health service
My favorite part of this meme is that it's trying to say that transgender people don't like Trump, when it's clearly a picture that was taken in a different country.
😆😁🤣😂😅 Trump and the  has single-handedly destroyed this nation, keep your pants on, Bill!
Extreme “hillary telling trump to delete his account” energy
Does he need to? Trump can’t even see his feet.
NEVER FORGET:  Trump loves Goya Beans more than Americans #TrumpHatesScience
once again they were broadcasting  so turned his BS off, streamed Obama’s eulogy of John Lewis, then listened to Clinton and even Bush. I really miss Presidents. Intelligent men of honor, who are articulate, have kindness,shame on us if We don’t vote Trump out
You assumed you could write a piece mocking people who say Trump is an autocrat because, my God, man, there's *no way* Trump would ever suggest postponing elections.  Right?  I assume you will cease writing out of honor for yourself and your family now.
Trump’s military shuffle in Europe will take time and be costly
All your columns make sense. You even said Lori Lightfoot shouldn't have said F U to Trump. And YOU DIDN'T GET PROMOTED? YOU'RE A STRONG MAN &amp; you're RIGHT.
Angela, Biden apologized for that statement (as decent people do when they make a dumb mistake). When has trump ever apologized for anything?
Trump's claims that the military is prepared to distribute COVID-19 vaccine are 100% lies
I just saw my first MAGAt in Chicago last weekend in a grocery store. He had a hillbilly American flag button up shirt with "TRUMP 45" on the back like a team jersey. And of course, no mask, totally against the law and store rules. I called it a clown shirt and he gave me a look.
Trump supporters utterly disgust me.,-And please don’t bother responding,-you’ve already been blocked.
I can meet you I that and I wish him well but his tweets are nonsensical if he is the Trump supporter he claims to be and I just feel he's being disingenuous. So I'm out when it comes to
Trump has yelled "SQUIRREL" again with his bullshit about delaying the election.   ALL of the media turned heads in unison and said "WHERE"?  Focus you stupid idiots         The GDP fell 32.9%. The loss of a third of the economy.  ONE THIRD!
Today in The Spin: – Lightfoot pulls out of event with Minneapolis mayor – Madigan polls Democratic colleagues amid ComEd bribery scandal – Obama says voter rights are under attack  Here are today’s top stories in Chicago politics, from
I think it's fair to say that the tone of White House reporting from the paper of record has caught up with our moment:
Yes, I mean I obviously agree that Trump didn’t just wake up this morning and go, “Just this once, I’m gonna do this fascist thing.”
I just read that every evening, Trump sits in an alcove in the Oval Office, hugs his knees, and mutters to himself about all the people who don't like him.  I had no idea you were so sensitive,  .  Sorry for the things I've said.
Yeah Trump is gonna have his minions all over this in the next few hours
Why Trump's tough-on-crime message is not breaking through in suburban America
McConnell and other top Republican officials rebuff Trump suggestion to delay the Nov. 3 election
CTS President Stephen Ray was one of many Chicago religious leaders who added their names to this statement issued by  about President Trump's decision to send federal troops to Chicago.
Childcare for students, but not school. This again proves it’s just about defying Trump, not public health.
Trump gave Cain cancer? You've got some serious TDS.
Hello,
Elena Kagan and Merrick Garland spoke at Federalist Society gatherings. Trump’s best move was letting them vet his judicial choices.
They wouldn’t be able to afford the Trump rates in his hotels.
AM BLACK AND I WILL VOTE FOR TRUMP FOR 4 MORE YEARS NOT TIRED OF WINNING 🇺🇸🗽
“And they say, the disinfectant. Can we inject it? Or the light in the body...” Has  gotten a injection of that alien blood, yet?
Only in Trump's Amerika(sic)
No kidding. I wasn't crazy about GW, but I respected the office and never hated him like I do Trump!
Is Singletary actually KNELLING next to trump??? KNELLING??? Wtf is this picture actually saying????
WHY IS OUR PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP'S FACE ORANGE? What the FUCK are you people doing to him. He need BLACK WOMEN taking care of his HAIR and SKIN. We BLACK Women have WISDOM and KNOWLEDGE naturally to take care of MEN, treating them like KING'S. 🗽HELP OUR PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP🗽
If only Trump had handlers... there’d be at least 100k+ of us still alive
Barack Obama gave the eulogy at John Lewis’ funeral today.  As this happened, Trump gave a surprise press conference and has been criticized for doing so.  He also wants to delay the election as his defeat seems more than likely in November.  176 days until inauguration.
Sorry for being extreme here but we won’t be letting Trump cancel the fucking election after all the stress we’ve been through.
He said what needs to say, as a Trump blackmail victim.
Some might laugh at this now, but it won’t take long to become a commonly held Fox News, then Facebook, then Republican Congress talking point. This is coming.
So when  starts speaking nonsense like #DelayTheElection it's because he's trying to control the news cycle and hide unfavorable news for him, don't let him. #DumpTrump #VoteHimOut2020 #RegisterToVote #trump
Rephrase:  Would you rather try HCQ and possibly save your life, or get put on a ventilator and die? Liberals would rather die than admit Trump was right 🤣
Yes, he has. President Trump has  cut taxes more than any other President thereby effectively giving himself and his friends over two trillion dollars in tax revenue dollars. Two trillion dollars buys a LOT of quid-pro-quo’s in Donald Trump’s world!
I do love that you and Tiffany trump both graduated from the same law school.
Trump's antics a/b an election delay, litigation for years &amp; "you may never know who won w/ mail in voting" are empty dementia threats. He can’t do it. He's saying it's rigged as an excuse to quit &amp; get a pardon imo, rather than being wiped out by Biden. He's circling the drain.
and nail to stay in power and the Dems are not doing a damn thing about it. Seems like  are the only ones fighting back. Less than 100 days till the election. How much more will we let Trump destroy before it's over?
"And if I can help you out with the funeral, I'll help you out, financially, I'll help you," President Trump said.
I don't see how this relevant for a Trump comeback or not.
If Trump did that we’d all be better off, so basically you’re saying that’s an upgrade.
Conflicted. I felt certain Trump was gonna take it in 2016. This feels closer to me. I still think he has a chance to pull it off, but I wouldn't be surprised if Biden won.
I don't know if Putin would bother with Trump?
If Trump loses election is rigged, but if he wins its legitimate. Please  explain the logic or ask Trump to support the theory
Speaking of which, has any Republican Senator — or Trump or Pence — urged people to complete their census forms? I don’t follow them so I can’t say I’ve seen any
Cain chose to be a soldier on the other side of this war. If you think there is no war you are sadly mistaken. Trump, Barr and the GOP are sending the military into our cities to fight its own citizens. GOP Senators have continued to enable all of this. The GOP is fighting tooth
Probably. Although lion is terrified of covid and hates trump, so who knows!
Not to mention a convenient way to distract from yesterday’s excellent interview by Jonathon Swan  regarding Russian bounties on American soldiers. Why no follow-up today by WH reporters? Trump got his wish.
WaPo reporting that Trump would like to send a flat monthly stipend to all chapters to help smaller chapters get off the ground. He has been sent to The Hague
Commander in Chief of Inaction calls for action, now. Thanks, but you  know Trump is largely your fault, right?
1. Dump Trump. 2. Get the Dems in January to repeal that 2006 law that made the USPS fund the next 50 years of pensions up front, which drained all their profits forever. 3. New law to let the Post Office access that forced pile of billions to repair the damage the 2006 law did.
America HATES Trump and #TrumpHatesScience  Vote for OUR LIVES on Nov 3 to fumigate tRump from OUR HOUSE!! #EndTheNightmare
Ya know, my biggest fear is that Trump will give out a large enough stimulus check to buy the election. But, also, Republicans hate the poor so idk.
Although I was no fan of his, it’s truly sad that this man who beat colon cancer, died of ignorance and following the lead of  Remember when Trump asked Black folks what did they have to lose? Herman Cain is the answer...
#SuicideByTrump    Is when a person dies from #COVID19  because they listened to Trump instead of Fauci.  - #HermainCain is it's latest victim to date -   Do we need a separate category?  #TrumpLiesAmericansDie  #WearAMask  #rapidtest  #VoteBlueToEndThisNightmare
I’m with Trump they put up low income housing projects in my old town a few years ago and car thefts went up over 200%
Cite your sources. OAN, Breitbart, and Trump’s ass are not credible sources.
Teanna Trump??
Federalist Society Member Latest Republican to Denounce Trump’s Election Threats
It's kind of like when you chew gum. You spit it out when all the sweetness is done.  The federalist society used Trump like gum - to fill over 200 judge seats.  Now, this is the spitting him out.
Skimming through tRump's tweets makes me 🤢🤮  Blech...
don't look a gift horse in the mouth.  This is a big deal and a blow to Trump.  It's a real sign of the coalition cracking.
There are both areas where I agree and disagree with  colleague Prof. Steven Calabresi. Here, we agree. I'm unsurprised and pleased to see him reiterate so clearly that these are not rules to be disregarded, bent, or broken.
Donald trump saying that its finna be fraud with the mail in Ballots😭 dude pls god wtf is going on
Dammit...  I had ‘#Trump endorsing Witch Doctor’ on my August card, not July...
Not to mention nobody asking Trump follow-up questions about Jonathon Swan’s   interview with him regarding Russian bounties on American soldiers in Afghanistan. Divert and distract. The more outrageous and untrue the better. Trump doesn’t want anyone to look deeper
Do Tump’s Americans really believe in #Facism?? I still believe in our democracy!! I believe in checks &amp; balances! I believe in beating the fascists with the LAW! How can I support the #lawyers fighting for real change?
COPS FOR TRUMP THAT’S RIGHT 🇺🇸🗽!
The GDP is down 33%.   Over a million more on unemployment.  Vote by mail is safe.    Trump is throwing crap against the wall to deflect
Trump may have better hair than Boris (well, it’s a toss up...no pun intended), but maybe Trump needs to personally experience COVID19 so he can get somewhat sane about the US response (or lack thereof) to the pandemic. Boris did.
I mean I have no idea but my oncologist relative here days doubtful. The point is that it’s silly to say trump killed Cain because the latter chose to expose himself the virus even though he was at high risk of death because of preexistings.
Voter fraud doesn’t happen nearly as often as the GOP make it out to.     The system will be pushed to the limit to process the vote counting, but trump’s push to fight “mail-in” ballots and delay the election have NOTHING to do with electoral integrity.
Does the Trump administration do ANYTHING for Americans?? It's like ALL taxpayer dollars go for one thing only: keeping Donald Trump afloat.
#TrumpHatesScience #TrumpHatesScience #TrumpHatesScience #TrumpHatesScience #TrumpHatesScience #TrumpHatesScience #TrumpHatesScience #TrumpHatesScience #TrumpHatesScience #TrumpHatesScience And 70% of the nation hate Trump.
He puts TRUMP first, PERIOD!
Mandred and the Trump administration*
Yeah. Trump. Hope he does that again in AZ with Gifford's numbers!!
I guess it’s safe to say that, in addition to the 140,000 deaths to date due to Trump’s carelessness, Cain is also one of them.
Only reason Trump called this presser is bcuz Obama was giving a eulogy. This was his pathetic attempt to take back the spotlight.   All Trump has cared about since day 1 is his fragile ego. He doesnt care how many he kills in the process as long as he doesnt lose. #trumppresser

I’m really not sure Trump ever wanted this job. I don’t think he thought he would actually win. So he’s running the country like it’s an episode of The Apprentice.  VOTE BLUE NOVEMBER 3 TO END THIS NIGHTMARE.
Sick to death of this vengeful crap “The fact that our Wards infrastructure needs have not been properly addressed, in at times ignored, is not a secret.” This is what Trump does. YAWN 🥱 #insecure #grudge #vengeful
Fearing Trump interference, FBI agents hid copies of Russia investigation docs - CNNPolitics
trump is Reagan's legacy.
Shoes Trump will never fill or even be qualified to shine.
Look at it this way -Every vote for Biden is a dart in Trump’s heart. No votes for any Republicans!!
Thanks for the history lessons. Your polls are dropping in swing states. You need to start real live interviews on real networks. You can't stay in your basement till the "convention". Trump is being very effective lying about the protests/riots. What is your answer?
Oh ok. I think that carries a little weight but no confirmation. Especially if Trump loses reelection. Either way he still has to work with Congress who may be Dem controlled after the election if he was to win.
Man even thin skinned Trump keeps his comments open to the public, the Astros just shut them down.  Cowards
Fascist, cause that will reelect trump.

Who rally was it? Who was told it wasn't safe? Oh Trump

He got what he wanted now he’s looking to the future. Doesn’t want to be associated with trump’s name.
Trump puppet....totally disconnected from the hardships and realities facing everyday Americans.
All good for his tombstone. Make sure tRump signs his name in sharpie!
Ivanka has voting machine pattens in China.  Trump cannot win without cheating so he has to yell the loudest about how the other side is going to cheat. Meanwhile he’s begging foreign countries for help. #pathetic
Even #Trump is surely watching....waiting to hear his name dragged thru the mud. But not a single person called him by name, not a single person gave him the satisfaction. They were celebrating an #AmericanPatriot. Something he knows nothing about
I don’t need to see any of them to realize Trump is a whack job
Bernie Bro who believes trump propaganda who doesn't thin for hmself
And to think he didnt have to die. If trump didnt have this rally he would still be alive
They get me my prescriptions on time all the time. They've not lost anything. You're a Trump follower, which explains the tweet. You're afraid of all the Democrats that will vote by mail, which Trump admitted.
#Trump is killing us at a rate of 1 US citizen per minute.  How much #bounty is #Putin paying him for that?  #coronavirus   #TrumpIsTheWORSTPresidentEVER  #151KDEAD #trumppresser
Trump and his administration #WorstPresidentEver #GOPCorruptionOverCountry #TrumpVirusDeathToll150K
The magic virus fairies weren't able to use their pixie dust to destroy the Covid because Trump didn't order the US Military to imprison people in their homes at gunpoint and shoot them dead if they were out walking their dog or jogging in March.  Duh..  sarc//
Trump’s  Merit based EO on the week of 08/10 &amp; #s386 #UC next week. It seems immigration became a big issue when millions of #Americans jobless #stopS386
TRUMP+ HIS FOLLOWERS STILL DON'T UNDERSTAND THE CONCEPTS OF  THE LADDER, THE TUNNEL, THE AIRPLANE.
where is a few meme's with Trump whuppin demented Joe's ass?
Incorrect, its how you take the mask off.  unless you are grinding it into your face and nose, masks work.  Stop listening to Trump, and Fox....Don't become Herman Cain
Has any public official besides Trump said that there is rampant voter fraud? Republican, Democrat, Indie? Any official voice?  Anyone?
With Trump's crony running it now and cutting hours and closing offices right before a mail-in ballot election, I don't trust Donald Trump. The USPS got me my prescriptions on time every time. I trust them with my ballot! They sent my application for the ballot in 2 days.
Other then Trump trying to delay the election, It’s a slow news day 😊
How does Trump think the military votes? Pigeon Carrier? Americans Abroad?
Trump with a deeply partisan Rose Garden speech = crickets
What are your thoughts on Trump delaying the election? I’ll wait.
Why does Trump hate The Postal Service? The District Sleeps Alone Tonight slaps!!!
There is no mail in fraud. Stop regurgitating Trump's bullshit
I agree Jan  He says outragious stuff Everyday . But the Question and misanswer time with the  Babbling idiocy at the end is positively Astounding. I didnt get to see the end  As the wife made dinner And have to sit at the K table She wont watch Trump  When She eats. 😂😂😂😂😂
why? Are we rewarding ignorance now?  He went to a rally #maskless, he was over 70 &amp; had underlying illnesses.    Are we rewarding him for being brave enough to die so  Trump could stick it to Science?  If so that didn't work so  remind me why we're rewarding him?
Let’s not forget Nancy’s son.
You may be right - let’s just make sure we have the 3 debates and let Americans decide - but I don’t think there’s a chance in hell biden will debate trump
Thanks Trump for helping keep Corona in Mexico!  That wall is keeping Texas and Arizona citizens safe!
Stunning is a word we re all used to after 4 years with trump! 🤯
The co-founder of the FEDERALIST society is calling for Trump to be impeached.  WHAT MORE WILL 2020 BRING
I will never understand how someone could be accepting or approving of everything that Trump has done over the last 3.5 years but then a tweet about delaying the election is what finally does it for you.  To each their own, but that seems like an odd 'final straw' at this point.
Hearing trump say they know what they’re doing with covid now is fucking ridiculous. If you really knew what to do, our country wouldn’t have almost 5 MILLION cases. I fucking hate it here
Why do you think ppl are against mail in ballots? Millions of more people could vote: with majority being black, Hispanic, non-English speaking,those in poverty, women who face pressure from males to vote a certain way, women of color... everything Trump is not.
My hope is that  /  use their status as a white male to fight for equality, not just focus on beating Trump. Trump is winning. Minorities, women, poor, felons, - still do not have equitable voting rights/access or no rights at all.
I Give Trump 9 Gazillion Passes. He Has Had His Colon Cleansed On A Daily Basis For Over 3 .5 Years. As Seen Today , Barack Obama Still Hates America And Is A Muslim Shill. I Love My Muslim Friends Who Are Honest In Their Faith. Obama...Muslim Brotherhood Anybody?
Trump + the GOP don't care about Covid.  They DO CARE about the election,  which is why they will give speeches and hand our tax dollars to their 1% MASTERS.
Trump's tweet was just a joke? You are a disgrace to the US Senate and the state of Texas.
RIP Mr Cain. I didn’t agree with him on many things, but I admired his passion &amp; hard work. I bet if trump took Covid19 seriously, he would still  be alive today. While Cain was dying, trump was playing golf with Brett Farve.  140K+ dead on your watch. Trump is NOT #MyPresident
Herman Cain embodied the ignorance of the trump base. He’s dead due to his own stupidity as will many other anti-mask/anti-science trump boobs. On another note, which state will you be voting by mail from this election?
Does Trump like you “mansplaining” him to the world?
Biden is gonna win in November, Trump has to go, no more debating it
Why aren't the covid deaths considered negligent homicide against Trump? His do nothing magical thinking killed them.
That's right, my bad. He works for the NIAID. Despite that, many people more credible than Trump have mixed messages about wearing a mask. To demonize people on Twitter as though they know for certain what works is wrong.
How many times did you use the term “lie” when Trump actually lied (over 21,000 times)?  The 4th Estate is in life support.  Collectively, you’re narcissistic.  This tweet of yours is the evidence.  Do better.
where does trump fall on a single ideological dimension though
Dust off in case democracy is threatened.  Attorney General in Washington State is ready with a memo and lawsuit should Trump follow through with election threats.   via
Tucker criticizes Trump all the time and has record ratings. You ever think ppl just don’t like you?
Oh it was Tulsa? Seems like everyone got sick in Tulsa! Nobody got sick from “protest” or riots but a Trump rally is where Covid was just waiting in the corner for unsuspecting ppl to come.
Like we are so far beyond Biden and Trump comparisons lmao
Politics now: President Trump floats idea of delaying election, Gov. Pritzker tweets a no vote + Mayor Lightfoot pulls out of event to avoid being on stage with Minneapolis mayor: sources + Madigan polling Democratic colleagues amid ComEd bribery scandal
Is Donald Trump a good president?
'I don't want a delay': Trump rows back on delaying election but not on mail-in ballots.
Economic growth, which Trump promised would be over 4% annually but never reached Obama levels DROPPED 33% in the 2nd quarter.  Great job by Mr Bussinessman.
Absolutely. I do not believe that ANY of that statement is anything more than goading the Democrats to create a situation that makes Trump appear more sympathetic.
Tonight, I'm voting YES on  amendment to stop the Trump Admin from spending any federal dollars on their destructive lawsuit to strike down the ACA. During #COVID19—with 4.5 million infected &amp; 150,000+ fatalities—affordable health care is more critical than ever.
Trump REACTS to Polls with More Racism  via
I really want a bacon jalapeño cheeseburger from wendys or like a fish sandwich from some place not supporting trump’s campaign
He would stop being president on 1/20/21 no matter how long the election is delayed. He wouldn’t become president after that unless elected. Thinking trump is a dictator that won’t leave office is frankly retarded.
I’m so sorry for the loss of Mr Cain. I didn’t agree with him on many occasions, but I admired his passion and hard work. I bet if trump took Covid19 seriously, he would still  be alive today. F U trump, add Herman to the 140K+ already dead.
You'll need pictures for Trump.... remember, he doesn't read much.
No, he can't fire him. The CDC is not a government agency. Trump and the media can stop giving him air time if he loses legitimacy.
Calabresi is proposing an action that could make Trump appear more sympathetic. I do not believe his sudden change of heart.
This is a damning portrait of the (lack of) federal government response to this threat. Some things are of large enough scope that only the US Gov. can address them -this was one, and Trump dropped the ball. Bigly. The election is a referendum on that failure.
Exactly.  Trump is so awful, Biden can chill in his basement.
It’s brilliant political strategy by Trump to campaign against “Sleepy Joe” Biden by weaponizing the same primal fears of what could happen to America if Trump is not reelected - to again save us from the demonized Democrats. Brilliant lies are still lies.
And what is in place to prevent trump from declaring martial law and staging the coup he started in 2016.
realizing how unprepared emotionally i am for a biden victory over trump in november
When Donald Trump refuses to concede the election, he is to be removed by military force from the White House. If his supporters resort to terrorism, they are to be arrested and charged with terrorism. I don't care how much he cries, he's going to lose this election
The Spin: President Trump floats delaying election, Gov. Pritzker tweets a no vote | Lightfoot pulls out of event to avoid being on stage with Minneapolis mayor: sources | Madigan polling Democratic colleagues amid ComEd bribery scandal
I DO NOT believe he is sincere. He's looking to set up situation that makes Trump look more victimized.
These "stories" are only coming from Trump, so they can easily be dismissed as not credible.
And Trump killed over 150000 Americans
If Trump pulls a stunt like that, remember what Palin said about Second Amendment remedies?
Stop showing these so-called “Covid pressers” by trump    They are the ramblings of a delusional narcissist and always ends up dissolving into a campaign rally for him. Stop broadcasting his lies! #NoMoretrump  #TrumpLiesAmericansDie
And Trump will drop another 5 points in the polls with another corrupt act...
Anybody remember Trump telling Chris Wallace he would have a full new healthcare plan rolled out in two weeks? By that outline that is due this Sunday. Look forward to seeing it
When one of the co-founders of the #FederalistSociety calls Trump a fascist, you know you're in uncharted territory.
Trump is unfit - wake up!
Oh yeah I could at least do as good as Trump
Since when has Trump given a shit about laws? He's never been held accountable to any of them in the past 70-odd years.
Remember trump thought he was going to lose the 2016 election. For weeks in advance, he started saying if Hillary won the election was "rigged". They were prepared for a loss but Putin had god hackers. He is just reverting to that playbook.  Undermining the election.

Lol. With tens of thousands needless death and the economy cratered and democracy in danger, I think most Americans already know Trump was a huge mistake. Even the most miraculous debate performance couldn't begin to redeem him.
It is disturbing even to suggest delaying the Nov. election. America voted during the Civil War. We can and should vote in 2020. #Election2020 #Trump #Biden
How's your COVID-19 progressing, Kim? At which Trump rally were you exposed? Herman Cain's COVID death is likely the result of the maskless Tulsa rally he attended. And you want schoolchildren to experience and spread this disease? You and Junior are wrong for America. #VoteBlue

Trump walks back his tweet about postponing the elections.  Left it pinned up for 3 hours for his followers to see, then took it down. He knows he's losing &amp; it's all about discrediting the election results when he loses.   #wtpBlue  #ONEV1
Hermain Cain, Trump supporter died of covid. He was at agent orange's rally in June with no mask, tested positive 9 days later. JAMA report says kids carry 100x the virus. 1,403 deaths yesterday. 1 death per minute. And CPS wants to open schools. I guess I will be going to jail
I think it's safe to say that the clown involved in over FOUR THOUSAND lawsuits before being elected as POTUS is going to be a real pain whether he delays the election or attempts to litigate it afterwards, even if it's a moot point.
This "joke" simply isn't funny. Maybe Russian bounties on US troops is also funny to Trump and Cornyn - they certainly don't seem to be taking it seriously!!
#gileadsciences   Gilead the manufacturer of One of the best treatments for Covid 19 patients... misses EPS by 25%.   Who's managing the business finances, Trump ?
You’re right Joe Biden will try to get out of having any debate with Donald Trump. We the people want to have these debates move forward so we can make a choice based on what we hear
He also made a tweet about how you have to feel bad for the cops that killed George Floyd and these are typically more trump povs
Great. Another Trump Toady.
Yeah. A lot of people fell for Trump's con
Or sacrificing our President 🙏
I appreciate Sen. Collins' strong reaction to Trump's election delay idea.
Breitbart is notoriously biased, are you kidding me? The founder literally served in the Trump administration.
Oh, no. He had a little trouble with Zoom. Not as awkward as this. #TrumpIsNotWell #PersonWomanCameraManTV
#gileadsciences   Gilead the manufacturer of One of the best treatments for Covid 19 patients... misses EPS by 25%.   Who's managing the business finances, Trump ?
Obviously, that’s why so many people are dying and confused about covid
Seems like someone who supported Trump until now - through the border concentration camps and the Muslim ban and the deployment of unmarked federal agents to arrest protestors - should probably not serve as our impartial arbiter on what is and is not fascistic.
This Sunday would be the two week outline Trump told Chris Wallace about a full new healthcare plan. Look forward to seeing it, or did he forget?
They don't  want to come here because of the Trump virus.
You don’t work for Trump, you work for the people of Arizona.   Sad and pathetic. Delete this.
You're saying Obama supported ISIS while fighting them? That is so illogical. Ironically, Trump kind of did promote COVID because he downplayed the seriousness for months &amp; is still behind on creating enough tests for the American people (which should've happened during lockdown)

Is this really Robert Trump aka Uncle Trump here to join the show? Seems like it must be, well I dig it. Because he wants to #SaveTheChildrenWorldWide
Great but 3 will have to do! After Biden and trump debates let Americans decide - agreed?
No you are holding up everything! I can’t believe how you act at your age! You should resign or retire! For the best interest of America! You Lindsey Graham and trump must go! #VoteMoscowMitchOut      what use are you all?
Trump had emergency appt with neurologist to consider R foot drag, weakness in R hand, intermittent slurred speech? Surely this is the only “trouble” that would keep Trump from honoring John Lewis.
And Trump’s lack of any comment on the Russian bounty on our US Service men and women is the most anti democratic thing any president has ever ignored.
Trump Might Try to Postpone the Election. That’s Unconstitutional.
When are we gonna start talking about charging Trump with involuntary manslaughter of thousands of American lives?  He promotes not wearing masks, and he tells his voters the virus is a Democratic Hoax.  #HermanCainThe skinniest guy at the gym right now is wearing a Trump 2020 hat. Maybe not the best decision? You may say: “It’s 2020, we aren’t savages nobody will take exception to it.” I say, yeah it’s 2020 have you watched the news at all this year?
Last time I checked, blacks voting for Trump doesn’t scientifically mean they’re not black.
Also funny is trump is suing PA to not allow drop off ballot boxes!  He wants them thru his slow boat to China post office!
And some say Trump isn’t Presidential. He would never make a political speech at a funeral and stoke racial violence . That’s as sleazy as you can be.
How do you tweet from jail? Oh yeah trump let you out. More "law &amp; order " I guess. You dance with the devil..................
You think President Trump doesn’t know what he is doing? Obama had to change his “eulogy” at the least minute
Trump's claims that the military is prepared to distribute COVID-19 vaccine are 100% lies
That's great. Any national plan for the pandemic raging across America yet? Any plans to stop Russia from killing our soldiers?  What was that about a wall again?  Is it to help Mexico keep out Americans because we have no leader and they don't want trump virus? FAILURE
Yet here is proof that Oklahoma was directly effected from this super spreader event. This isn't assumptions. These are facts:
You've murdered  As well as many others who attended. #SuperSpreaderTrump
6,000 showed up and amoung the crowd?  now dead as well as thousands infected. Thanks #SuperSpreaderTrump and thanks to the #DemonSperm
Trump is too far gone to correct him
“Drain the Swamp” is a great slogan, bit would “Drain the Demons back to their Hell Hole” but more accurate?  Asking for a friend. 🇺🇸🎊TRUMP 2020🎊🇺🇸
This is  without a mask indoors during a global pandemic where six members of the Trump advance team all tested positive for Covid19 as well as members of the general public. Oklahoma had a massive surge in cases because of this event.
You miss spoke. You called the virus by the wrong name. Its pronounced the trump virus. Don't worry its just the dementia acting up again.  Person  Man Woman  Camera  Idiot
If only the Trump administration had a competent lawyer who could explain this stuff to them. Alas, all they have is Rudy "Goolie" Giuliani and "Bagjob" Billy Barr. It's a shame, really.
Except that's the entire point of the question YOU asked. The event was inside. Trump's first rally during the pandemic. Inside a venue in Tulsa.  Here is  inside with no mask on. What else do you want to hear? That the #GOPDemonSperm that  spokeabt?
What forgiveness? He refused to acknowledge Bush 43 &amp; Trump as President.
Word up: You don’t gain any “points” for using a man’s passing as fame fodder. You claim Trump has no class? Look in a damn mirror!
On the way home I saw someone with Trump signs saying things like Trump country Trump 2020 I swear everytime I see those signs I get pissed off? Do you get pissed when you see any Trump signs
No idea; I don't think I even get Fox News. They're not really going to pivot until someone else has and taken all the heat for it (remember banks charging ATM fees?). Once Trump's allies begin to desert him en masse, Fox will jump on the bandwagon.
Friday night on The Board Hitters &amp; Bourbon podcast™️  it’s the Battle of the Millionaires (no not Biden vs Trump) as I’ll be previewing Sat’s G1 Whitney Stakes (a  Win &amp; You’re In Race) at Saratoga
please gets these guys off the air! 1)Trump is trolling! 2) There is no more normal 3) How much free air time is he getting with this latest tweet? 4) Conservatives will come out &amp; vote 5) He’s down in the polls because ppl on the left are nuts so we’re quiet!
Exactly. And the fact these guys are being duped by this complete fraud makes me wonder what kind of education they received at my alma mater. Basically all that remains of the Trump base are non-college whites... and apparently all the white kids who played football at MSU.
Trump slump.
It's all about what the military decides to do in my book.  As of now, much evidence points to the military turning on Trump if he attempts a self-coup.  Even former MIC lobbyist and current Defense Secretary Esper is against using the Insurrection Act.
Nope, not buying it. November 3rd.!  People can just come out of their fearful hiding or not! I will &amp; I will vote for Trump.
A U.S. appeals court will reconsider dismissal of the case against former Trump national security adviser Michael Flynn.

Trump says it is safe to open schools but now it is not safe to hold an election
Anyone who believes twitter will change anything because a bunch of useless politicians threaten them needs a reality check.   They will change when Trump breaks the company into 80 parts then declares 80 new utilities. Standard Oil circa 1911.
Cancel The election there’s a pandemic!!!! Send your kids to school the pandemic is fake!!!!! All said by Donald Trump within 4 hrs of each other.  What a joke you are.
Trump has broken the law before but Trump can't delay the election DO NOT fall for it lets keep the topic somewhere else okay. Let's talk about Lewis's funeral or Herman's death topics like that.
Trump can't do it. Barr can't do it. Only Congress can do it, and Nancy will never allow it.
Herman Cain dies of Covid19 after being in the hospital for over a month after attending Trump's rally. Trump's rallies are a Covid19 breeding ground period.
Herman Cain posted a anti mask tweet now deleted before this picture. This is sad, and a direct result in the misinformation campaign against masks and the seriousness of Covid, and Trump pushing both and holding a rally when he clearly shouldn’t have.
Best laugh of the day. I still can’t stop laughing at the MSM. Trump is a genius.
So where the evidence of this? THAT TRUMP HAD THEM MOVED? Easy to say but prove it!!!!!! I’ll wait
#MSM  Trump's daily distractions are like yelling "Squirrel" to you. Don't chase every shiny object.
I’m sure trump will “take NO responsibility.”
Trump is just trying to distract from news that we experienced the worst economic drop in HISTORY.  Don’t let him forget.  Everyone should remind him.   #US #WorstPresidentEver #COVID19

Correction *not for rioters* only Trump supporters
Plus, NY State is going to crucify Trump, playing nicely into his messianic fantasies.
Yep. Sad for the loss of this great man. Within nano seconds COVID is now a disease that if contracted is a death sentence. They will also use his attendance at the Tulsa rally a mandate for compulsory tracking.  It for rioters only Trump supporters.
Rest in covid Herman. You decided to ignore public health warnings. Donald trump is the reason you are dead.
Same age as  infected in the same place. How much of his fav drug is Trump guzzling every day in hopes of avoiding the Corona?

You don't have proof that all this looting and destruction was done by  just BLM protesters, could have been done by White supremacist Trump supporters like the guy at AutoZone.
How about we move the election forward? The sooner we dump Trump, the better.
The GOP had a plan to fight the tRUMP virus? Bullshit. You and the rest of the GOP have been very publicly downplaying it the whole time. Refusing to wear a mask calling it a hoax calling it fake news. Attacking our top medical advisors and now its the Dems fault. Blow me
Anything to delay his move out date  CNN: Trump floats delaying election despite lack of authority to do so.   via
Trump's tweet about raising the possibility of delaying the election is nothing but a distraction he can't delay the election by executive order. Congress decides when elections are not a sitting president
#WallStreet and some of the base dead-enders are about the only support #Trump has left. So now he wants to postpone the election. He has also put up barricades around the White House to fortify his encampment and make it more difficult to root him out in less then 100 days.
And Trump will release his tax returns too.
Dumb Donald Trump doesn’t have a clue as to what he’s doing in the WH. In fact I hear he gets lost at least once a day and can’t find his way to the Oval Office
12/ It would, if Trump could get out of his own way defer to experts and admit that other countries have done this better.  Then copy them!    Unfortunately, he doesn't have the intellectual ability or emotional maturity to do that.  So it's on us.
7/ 150,000 Americans are dead as a result of that failure.  Last week, we lost twice as many Americans as we lost on 9/11.  Not because we don't have the tools to get COVID under control, but because the Trump WH is incapable of leadership.
6/ That is what most countries have done.  It is exactly the opposite of what the Trump White House has done.  We still don't have a national testing strategy.  We still don't have a national contact tracing database.  We hear too much from Trump and too little from Fauci.
There seems to be a bit of confusion about the prospects for the economy right now, so let's make this simple.  There is only one way to get the US economy going again: get COVID-19 under control.  Trump's utter failure to do so is why the prospects are so bleak.  Thread:
I am not a leftist. I'm a moderate. I was a Libertarian for 20 years before Trump.
They do. You just have bad reading comprehension. This conversation is over. I don't have time because I have 96 days to help get out the vote so we can vote The Traitor out and all the complicit GOP up &amp; down the ballot. It won't matter anymore on Jan. 20. Trump will be gone.
Illinois.  We need Trump and Police!
Trump received $10 Million to relocate the Embassy from Israel to Jerusalem from Sheldon &amp; Miriam Adelson, as a condition/campaign promise...but glad he's ALLOWING WOMEN TO SPEAK, not typically a Trump move, wonder how much that cost.

Joe Biden for President 2020. In my opinion, Trump's all ready lost. He is losing big time in the general election. Trump needs to resign.
A grand jury in NY may have indicted Trump but chose to keep it sealed atm and if Trump loses the indictment gets unsealed
Biden for President 2020. Let's see who will win in November. Trump's all ready lost based on how he's handled everything recently. Trump is currently losing in the general election. Deal with that.
Trump has shown that he can normalize his abhorrent behavior faster than the courts can move. He is out-running justice with his tweets. How in the world is it possible that the executive branch can blanket stonewall congress for years? Justice delayed is justice denied.
Of you support him I want nothing to do with you. I blocked a fiend I've had for 20 years and will not talk to him as he supports trump.  The man doesn't even know why he wants a 2nd term. When asked he broke into some crazy story about his first day as president. He has no idea

Exactly the way they attempted to orchestrate an impeachment of Trump.
I tried to address this yesterday. My understanding is doctors have always been the ones making these decisions, they can still do so and all the hubbub is a political distraction. Trump mentioned it and now everybody has to virtue signal their tribe by supporting or opposing it.
She needed a little attention. Lunacy works for trump.
I would not worry about NATO. A President Biden will undo the harm. In February 2021, we need a full investigation into the Trump/Putin disaster. Thanks Anthony for standing up to Trump. Maybe you can help rebuild the Republican party.

It wasn't a hoax. It was real. Former intelligence people under multiple Presidents said even if Trump did not read his daily briefing. Someone in his Cabinet should have seen it, especially since it was shared with other countries. They would tell him.

My guess is years ago. Trump praised Epstein and wished Maxwell “well” last week. If you can’t tell the difference I’ll get you a connect the dots book.
C’mon.  Please stop playing cute games.  You also wrote “In his [Cuomo’s] defense, there was a lot we did not know then that we know now.”  But at the same time you make a chart and blame every death on Trump, and I have never seen you make ANY caveats about that chart.
maybe change "Demon Sperm" to "Demon Semen" for the silly rhyme? I can't decide if that would be more or less absurd; my absurd-o-meter crapped out pretty early on in the Trump administration.
He willfully ignored intelligence warning him. Other countries knew about it! Bad leadership.
I never voted for Obama. I was a Libertarian for 20 years until Trump.

Mueller was blocked from witnesses and documents by the Trump administration. What is he hiding?
Do us all a favor and resign please. Stop blaming this problem on Trump because it was the same shit when Obama was in office. CPD hates you bacause you dont stand up for them. It's sad and pathetic.

He has been critical of Trump on his podcast.
It literally says Trump confirms he didn't do shit.
Trump was impeached.
It would have been found if the Senate GOP had not covered up for Trump by not allowing witnesses or new evidence. First trial of this nature in US history without witnesses. Putin has kompromat on Trump and the RNC. We saw the DNC emails. The RNC was hacked at the same time.

Nice stereotyping. No, I don't blame Trump for my problems, but I do blame him for escalating racial tensions in this country, for taking kids from their parents, for ruining the great economy (and country) left him, and for looking the other way while Putin kills our troops.
Putin is trump’s proud owner.

Four years ago, a friend asked me if I thought all Trump supporters were racist. My response was “Maybe not, but they certainly don’t care if their leaders are. They’ve decided racism is fine with them.”  Still true except maybe for the “maybe not” part.

TRUMP VIRUS 🦠 Killed this Man who beat stage 4 CANCER
If Trump knows the Trump Corona Virus why don’t we have a national plan to combat it? Instead Trump abdicated his responsibility and passed it off to the states.
All Trump did was put Trump first.
Mexico will be putting up a wall to keep the Trump Virus out.
This is great. Out of 30,000, 97% VOTED for President Trump.  I have a wish. Let's reelect this great president.
Remember what Rick Wilson said "What ever Trump touches dies"
This needs to be said by all Republicans. Ads needs to play on this theme in all media forums. They need minority conservative groups to unite and be featured in ads. Trump won’t win with a twitter campaign by himself. He’s preaching to the choir.
Hoping that trump is shown as much compassion as he has shown to Reality Winner.
No mask. No social distancing. No example for Trumpers. Didn’t Trump lose a friend to the Trump Corona Virus today and now he is endangering someone else?
I know!  She’s as good as that Anthony guy that “worships” Trump. It’s awesome. 😂
I don't expect any different messages from the Trump haters.
Trumps administration has had no focus on anything. We just had the worst economic Qtr in history. We have the highest deficit in history. Trump has killed 151,000 from the Trump Corona Virus so far. Trump is by far the worst POTUS in history.
Someone tweeted that trump has a 43% approval rating from blacks.
Trump does not and never has had a 43% approval rating from blacks. Never.
Trumps margin of defeat will be so huge we won’t need all to wait more than 5 minutes. Then the National Guard will head over to the White House to remove Trump.
Trump will lose by the widest margin in history. Unless he resigns and has Pence pardon him Trump will be off to prison early next year.
Willing to die to keep Trump happy!
Herman Cain thought it was a hoax too. He is dead today from Corona Virus he caught at the last Trump rally. You should go to a rally, catch the virus and die too.
No, they’re not. 95% of voters are confident with mail in voting. Trump knows in an honest election he will have a very embarrassing loss Nov 3.
Donald Trump should resign. Pass it on.
Trump killed Cain at his rally. Cain died of the Trump Coronavirus he got by not wearing a mask and not using social distancing at the Trump rally.
Trump’s swamp.
If only Trump spoke nicely too.
If we are at the point where you seriously think that some states may stop electors, Trump has already broken our democracy.
Yes! That will reverberate in Trump’s tiny brain. Plus Pres. Jimmy Carter’s message was included.
I'm dying for Trump to die does that count? 😂😂😂
Great idea to hold a rally during a pandemic! Should weed out some more Trump voters
Wonder if Trump world will consider Herman Cain a martyr, who sacrificed his life to please his leader?
How can anyone trust the  federal government to lead us out of this crisis if the Trump administration listens to a bunch or quacks.
Trump is so afraid of being embarrassed in the coming election (landslide loss) he is already making up excuses and trying to find a way to cheat the election for himself.
Instead of asking  can we go to rural areas and ask Trump voters, if they like the idea of spending 20-30 dollars to send mail via fedex as opposed to cents with USPS.
Hey Mika did you know Cain had stage 4 cancer? Yes he did. THATS why he shouldn’t have been at that stupid rally without a mask! Or not there at all! But according to these idiots tweeting, “oh well. He was sick anyway.” Trump has poisened the minds of his fans with stupidity.
How can evangelicals refuse to see genuine Christian belief like bill and Nancy and still call trump one of their own? Watching them you know they both genuinely have faith in God.
Would you have laughed had Hillary or Obama tweeted that? A lot of GOP people seemed to have developed quite the sense of humor since trump was elected.
Donald Trump never wanted to be President, he just wanted to WIN. Winning is all that mattered to him, not the responsibility of the job. Being a winner is all that is important to him. That is why he is so desperate now. He knows he is losing and that is inconceivable to him.
Had trump said anything about the death of the head of Blacks for Trump? Herman Cain was the head of the Blacks for Trump organization. And nothing. So disrespectful.

Don't vote for Biden. Don't vote for Trump.  vote for who you want and reject the made up, yet overwhelmingly popular idea of a 2 party system.  but especially make sure you vote for the house and the senate conscientiously, they matter way more than the rapists on the ballot.
So after helping trump get reelected, he then takes away the vote without any checks what so ever, (the rich get richer and without the vote, the poor get even poorer) That's exactly why we revolted against Britain, extensive taxes without the vote

Trump the Crybaby in Chief. Barr the rudolf Hess of America!
Mr Johnson, your corrupt party used deep state Democrats to initiate, without evidence, 30 investigations against President Trump; 12 Congressional, 10 criminal &amp; 8 state/local.  Amid this 4 yr unmitigated attack on President Trump, deep state Democrats trapped Flynn and Stone.

Think abut the magnitude of that investigation.  All Democrat, Deep State Trump haters, using all the resources of the FBI, CIA &amp; DOJ, to find collusion with Russia, and nothing surfaced?. No politician in Washington could have withstood such scrutiny.

2012 Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain has died from COVID 19 at the age of 74. The former Godfather's Pizza CEO attended President Trump's rally in Tulsa on June 20 where he was seen not wearing a mask. He was hospitalized with Coronavirus symptoms in early July.

Twitter is hiding this reply I tweeted about one of Trump's toadys. Adm. Giroir   must have been offended by me retweeting the OpEd he wrote two months ago to demand reopening the country at "warp speed" during a pandemic.
But wait, its President Trump and the Republicans that are sewing hate and division in this Country (sarcasm)! GET THE FUCK OUTTA HERE WITH THIS SHIT. These "parents", and i use that term loosely, should be charged with CHILD ABUSE!!!
He was the biggest “celebrity” trump could get to his death trap rallies. He needs those crowds of screaming lunatics. No President ever kept holding rallies after the election. Weak bastard
The only tweets I’ve seen lately in support of trump are bots and trolls.

Nobody likes trump fake sweetie.
So trump is gonna do a 2016 type election. Using his gunman to provoke peaceful protesters to go crazy and blaming the protesters for destruction.
In the spirit of acknowledging my error,I even deleted my previous comment to your friend.  I only posted that deposition to torpedo the myth of Trump being a child molester that some people seen to have.

I don't think it would be smart. Fighting would turn it into riots and that is playing right into Trump's hands. I think he wants to milk these protests for all he can until they do erupt in violence at which time he can claim his Law &amp; Order title again.

Yeah me too and he's clearly not that bright because he would've realized that by saying that the Epstein accuser may have lied on her deposition,he in fact implied that Trump is a child molester.

In saying she may have lied on her deposition,you are in fact implying that Trump is a child molester.
Your point is what?  It's public knowledge Scott is a Trump supporter
You want to call one of Epstein's accusers a liar,be my guest.  You're just mad that it wrecks the narrative you have of Trump being a child molestor.
That's a sworn deposition from one of Epstein's accusers.  She states that not only did Trump not have sex with her or any of the other Epstein victims,she also states that Trump wasn't at any of Epstein's residences.  Btw,since this is under oath,she's on the hook for perjury.

Also the deposition states that this person never saw Trump and Epstein together.  Now before someone tries to throw the Katie Johnson thing at me,that was a court filing and you're not under oath for those.  You are under oath for a deposition  and face all penalties for prejury
Lot of replies to this saying “it’s because the media won’t cover it because they can’t blame Trump,” but the reality is that Trump takes up all the oxygen and dramatically raises the opportunity cost of reporting on anything else.
Well what makes that deposition interesting reading is apparently Epstein thought he and Trump were still friends,even though Trump banned Epstein for life from all his properties,not just Mar A Lago.

There's also this,a deposition from one of Epstein's accusers which states that not only did Trump not have sex with her or any of the other accusers,but that Trump wasn't even there

Plus, NY State is going to crucify Trump, playing nicely into his messianic fantasies.
Yep. Sad for the loss of this great man. Within nano seconds COVID is now a disease that if contracted is a death sentence. They will also use his attendance at the Tulsa rally a mandate for compulsory tracking.  It for rioters only Trump supporters.
Rest in covid Herman. You decided to ignore public health warnings. Donald trump is the reason you are dead.
He was a grown man who knew he had a ore existing condition. He drunk the trump kool-aid.... Shame on him.

They won’t be able to blame the mask wearing since he didn’t wear one... I wonder if this will change Trump’s tune? Oh yeah, right, he doesn’t give a shit about anyone but himself. Not even his “friends.”

I’m trashing hydroxy... because it doesn’t work for COVID, and trashing Trump because he can’t admit it. Did he buy stock in (or take a “donation” from) a company that makes it or owns a lot of it?
7/ 150,000 Americans are dead as a result of that failure.  Last week, we lost twice as many Americans as we lost on 9/11.  Not because we don't have the tools to get COVID under control, but because the Trump WH is incapable of leadership.
6/ That is what most countries have done.  It is exactly the opposite of what the Trump White House has done.  We still don't have a national testing strategy.  We still don't have a national contact tracing database.  We hear too much from Trump and too little from Fauci.
There seems to be a bit of confusion about the prospects for the economy right now, so let's make this simple.  There is only one way to get the US economy going again: get COVID-19 under control.  Trump's utter failure to do so is why the prospects are so bleak.  Thread:

Trump has shown that he can normalize his abhorrent behavior faster than the courts can move. He is out-running justice with his tweets. How in the world is it possible that the executive branch can blanket stonewall congress for years? Justice delayed is justice denied.
Of you support him I want nothing to do with you. I blocked a fiend I've had for 20 years and will not talk to him as he supports trump.  The man doesn't even know why he wants a 2nd term. When asked he broke into some crazy story about his first day as president. He has no idea
When Trump beat Hillary all their minds exploded!  They’re still trying to figure out what happened!  We know they never will. But they don’t know that.🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
How many months have the GOP and tRUMP just hoped this virus would go away without a plan of any kind? 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. Has America's biggest enemy living in it.
Exactly the way they attempted to orchestrate an impeachment of Trump.
I tried to address this yesterday. My understanding is doctors have always been the ones making these decisions, they can still do so and all the hubbub is a political distraction. Trump mentioned it and now everybody has to virtue signal their tribe by supporting or opposing it.
She needed a little attention. Lunacy works for trump.
I would not worry about NATO. A President Biden will undo the harm. In February 2021, we need a full investigation into the Trump/Putin disaster. Thanks Anthony for standing up to Trump. Maybe you can help rebuild the Republican party.
It says it in the first paragraph of your source. "A conservative website funded by a billionaire supporter of Marco Rubio paid for the opposition research that eventually led to the salacious dossier about Donald Trump." If the info wasn't shared, how did it lead to the dossier?

Hillary had way more on Trump than the Russian collusion. If you listen to the debates, she knew everything about him.
Hillary was looking for anything on Trump. So they shared everything on Trump.
Bothe Trump and Senator Kennedy trigger my gag reflex.
While Donald Trump decimates American society... Junior whines on Twitter.
So am I wrong Mr Muir?  Are you married? To who? Are you HIV positive? You’re so quick to criticize Trump.  Let’s have some information.  Typical democrat .
"A conservative publication SET IN MOTION the research that led to a dossier that includes unverified claims regarding ties between President Trump and Russia, the publication revealed on Friday."  AKA The Steele dossier
Oh please. Trump goes too far and/or lies every time he opens his mouth.
It's July 29th and Trump still hasn't resigned yet.
ABC news skewing their show to portray Trump in the worst possible light, meanwhile they hide the fact that David Muir is a flaming homosexual, married to a man. Doesn’t have the guts to admit it.  Hides it, and ABC is complicit
Mmmmmm you blame this on a party. Well if you do, then it would have to be the Republicans because they have been in charge (Senate and WH) since trump. So you are blaming losers WOW.
Haha! You're wrong. Same info!  "A conservative publication set in motion the research that led to a dossier that includes unverified claims regarding ties between President Trump and Russia, the publication revealed on Friday."
...White House - the Beacon wrapped up the investigation.  One month earlier, Clinton's team had hired Fusion to look into Trump for precisely the same reason."  THE SAME REASON. THE SAME RESEARCH WAS SHARED.
You say they aren't linked, but they are. "The committee heard that the website told Fusion GPS to look into the backgrounds of multiple GOP candidates, not just Trump, and dig up damaging information. But in May 2016 - as Trump neared the top seat in the GOP's run for the...
They probably found out that Trump &amp; Putin were in bed together with the first project and then hired Steele to corroborate it and find out more.
Anything on Trump would have been useful.
Last time I checked, New York and New Jersey were part of the United States, who's president is Donald Trump.
You aren't fooling anyone. You think Donald Trump, the absolute worst president in the history of the United States of America, deserves to be added to Mt. Rushmore!  LOL
Please consult the lizard people and the demons that rape you and give you their demon seed like the woman trump just retweeted.
He is just pissed because President Trump has not retweeted his version of the “truth”.
The real nightmare would be having a Trump move into my neighborhood—or anyone from this clown car of an administration.
So Fusion GPS did all that Trump research for Rubio. Then threw it all out and started over for Hillary. Bullshit. They combined it all into the Steele Dossier.
It wasn't a hoax. It was real. Former intelligence people under multiple Presidents said even if Trump did not read his daily briefing. Someone in his Cabinet should have seen it, especially since it was shared with other countries. They would tell him.
So what.  You had no mask yesterday and were breathing your illness all over the place.  You're a real piece of work Louie.  Take a nap man, get better and realize the nature of this pandemic instead of sucking up to Trump.  I understand this is harsh but hey.  Grow up.
Perkins Coie, to compile research about Mr. Trump, his businesses and associates — including possible connections with Russia. It was at that point that Fusion GPS hired Mr. Steele, who has deep sourcing in Russia, to gather information."
"It was the same company, which means at least some of the info was shared with both Rubio &amp; Clinton because who is going to do work twice.  "After Mr. Trump secured the nomination, Fusion GPS was hired on behalf of Mrs. Clinton’s campaign and the D.N.C. by their law firm,
...for the party’s nomination, Senator Marco Rubio of Florida — told Fusion GPS to stop doing research on Mr. Trump in May 2016, as Mr. Trump was clinching the Republican nomination."
"During the Republican primaries, a research firm called Fusion GPS was hired by The Washington Free Beacon, a conservative website, to unearth potentially damaging information about Mr. Trump. The Free Beacon — which was funded by a major donor supporting Mr. Trump’s rival...
I won't vote for Trump in November.
Democracy 'under siege from multiple directions,' Lightfoot warns  (Via Sun-Times)  This from the most out of touch and inept politician in America.  She continues to distract from the murder epidemic and crime wave all over her corrupt city.
In a time like we are having now, it is selfish of them to make a new building. Do you think it's a coincidence it is across from the Trump hotel? What does Trump have to gain by having it close to his hotel? I hope you are able to stop this from being built.
Oh so you’re responsible for putting them in the toilet? Another stunning deal from Trump
Trump needs to resign.
Barr behaving like pouty teenager. Slouchy posture, too cool for school attitude. He and Toddler Trump are great pair.
lol!  There is no one more dishonest than President Trump!
It’s SCARY business. It feels like a dress rehearsal for the election and POST election.  We must be such a huge powerful Blue Tsunami top to bottom and vote Trump and his complicit GOP OUT    If not now WHEN???   Get busy donate apply for a mail in ballot talk with friends
Trump tells suburban voters they will 'no longer be bothered' by low-income housing
Trump said he talked to Putin on the phone a week ago or so, oh boy, now that Mueller and Comy and Barr, and Pelosi, and, and …… protected him he is becoming brazen about Putin's total influence on him.
Pretty sure  was perfectly fine before Trump, and will continue to be fine after Trump in the years to come, either 2021 or 2025.

Demented donny tRUMP a puppet for Russia and a complete and utter failure.
And why is Trump sitting in the photo when it appears there is one woman in the room? Must be the bone spurs acting up or his wacky delusion of grandeur.
It’s Trump’s MO. Guarantee he’s held a grudge for looking stupid about the whole HCQ issue, and this was orchestrated to try and reverse everything. But now he just looks even dumber, if that’s possible.
This is Trump quid pro quo'ing Greg Gutfeld for kissing Trump's oversized a$$ all these years.  I'd say you're better than that, Donnie, but Lord knows, you aren't.
How many points do you think Biden's VP choice could swing his current lead over Trump in either direction?  Is 5 % points in play here, given this will likely be the defacto Dem nominee in 2024? #ithinkthatsright
Good point.  But I don't think the debates will happen.  I think Trump hinted last year he wanted no part of the debates, and will come up with outrageous demands in order to weasel out of them.
If Kamala is the VP choice, imagine her vs Pence’ldick’ in a debate?   Forget about Biden v Trump...that’s the undercard.
He willfully ignored intelligence warning him. Other countries knew about it! Bad leadership.
I never voted for Obama. I was a Libertarian for 20 years until Trump.
Marco Rubio's donor paid for it.
Not enough to connect the dots. Trump blocked the dots from talking.

John McCain was a hero and would have made a better Commander in Chief than Trump. He wouldn't let Russia hang out in Venezuela or let Putin kill our boys.
John McCain was the one who ordered it.
Trump's impeachment came after a House inquiry that he had solicited foreign interference in the 2020 U.S. presidential election to help his re-election bid. Then obstructed the inquiry itself by telling his administration to ignore subpoenas for documents &amp; testimony. Impeached.
Mueller was blocked from witnesses and documents by the Trump administration. What is he hiding?
Sorry Nikki, your ship sailed. Take your carnival act into the private sector while you can before Trump completely tarnishes you for life.
Do us all a favor and resign please. Stop blaming this problem on Trump because it was the same shit when Obama was in office. CPD hates you bacause you dont stand up for them. It's sad and pathetic.
He has been critical of Trump on his podcast.
It literally says Trump confirms he didn't do shit.
President Trump please help your people as you say and demand the use of HCQ for treatment of covid 19.
Trump was impeached.
It would have been found if the Senate GOP had not covered up for Trump by not allowing witnesses or new evidence. First trial of this nature in US history without witnesses. Putin has kompromat on Trump and the RNC. We saw the DNC emails. The RNC was hacked at the same time.
Um...if you have sanctions against a country and the fuck up, you give them more sanctions. You are bad at this and Trump is an ineffective leader.
Like how Putin will help cheat for trump to  “win” in 2020...
I dare you to watch this and tell me that trump isn’t the dumbest man to ever occupy our White House...⬇️⬇️⬇️

Trump is not sanctioning Putin.Over 150,000 people dead because Trump didn't do his job and he's saying it's safe now???
I’m seeing a lot of false information about what would happen is trump found a way to cancel the November election.  Here is what it would look like if he found a way to do it.
Serious question to one who has been neck deep in the POTUS nomination process—Given Trump’s clear disdain for our democracy and it’s processes, COULD the delegates to the GOP convention repudiate DJT and nominate another candidate? Would the rules permit that?
1 good, 1 ok and 1 bad president. How quick the American people forget the truth. Only thing they have in common is they are better then trump.
I still believe there's only two types of Bernie bashers now, Russian trolls and Trump trolls pretending to be Bernie supporters. Very few of these Bernie bashers are real Bernie supporters.
Trump?
No. Yes, Trump is a narcissistic asshole, but people have to think and do for themselves.
Sorry but no delay in the election. Just gives Trump an excuse to stay in office and run this country over
All you Republicans who are now voting against Trump are still complicit in the wanton destruction of our environment, in the dismantling of our educational and health systems and America’s social safety net. The  was promoting bigotry and homophobia long before Trump.
I’d like all the #RepublicansForBiden, #LincolnProject folks, founders of the  and others who voted for Trump in ‘16 to consider how much fallacious propaganda your party fed America in order to get voters to believe Trump was preferable to
My tweet will age fairly well. The election will not be a landslide victory for either candidate. Honestly I think trump will lose the popular vote but will win the election based on electoral college similar to 2016.
Oh, that’s funny. Chuck is the co-chair of the Trump re-election campaign in Iowa along with the #KimReaper  Joni takes her marching orders from Koch Industries. They all work solely for the #ComplicitCorruptGOP
Trump’s ultimate defense is going to be “Why did everyone let me get away with it if it was all so bad?”
RUDY IS  A CONSIGLIORI FOR THE TRUMP/PUTIN MOB FAMILY!!
To be fair I feel like people are even less confident about the democratic nominee in 2020 than they were in 2016 so yes you’re right it’s not 2016. It’s an even worse situation where most people don’t even want Biden. That’s a strange situation to be so confident in a trump loss
You neglected to mention that two of the three judges in that second controversial ruling were trump appointees
I mean I doubt he will lose but we’ll see. This kind of overconfidence that the political left have the election in the bag and trump has no chance in hell of winning is what got him elected in the first place.
Biggest defeat in history of us election? If you think trump will lose worse than Mondale lost to Reagan in 1984 then you’re clearly blinded by your own disdain for the president.
A real president doesn’t intentionally divide the nation thats all trump has done since he started running for potus
Louie Gohmert aka Gohmert the Goober thinks he got Covid from his mask. This comes from the same book of logic that says Donald Trump is a Christian and we should care about the opinion of  TV game show host.
Trump's fault
Per Trump...you hate it here, then leave.
Trump speak - law and order actually means my way or the highway!
Trump speak - do your job. actually means, declare war on American citizens.
Trump speak - always actually means never!!
Trump is not an animal. Animals have decency and kindness, Trump is not an animal.
Trump speak, anarchists &amp; agitators, actual peaceful protestors!  Federal Government, his version of secret police, thugs, sent to declare war on American citizens!  Once again violating his oath of office!
Or the same logic someone would use to call Donald Trump a great President or a Christian.

-32% GDP report comes in and Trump then announces he wants to postpone the election. Are you kidding me?   It can’t come fast enough.
couple things: 1. no, trump can’t delay the election. 2. he’s only calling for a delay because today marks the worst gdp drop in history, and he’s trying to distract you. focus on and spread THAT news!!
You should question ALL nominees of Trump. His reasoning is questionable. BEWARE OF TRUMP!!!
Did anyone think to ask him if the Trump rally was worth it?
Journalism is about comforting the afflicted and afflicting the comfortable. Too often we readers/viewers see the opposite, especially with Trump in office. We see reporters fawn over Kudlow, Ivanka and Kushner, and mimic GOP talking points about lazy Mexicans &amp; welfare queens
Factor in the undeniable and systemic bias against President Trump and the data is overwhelming in favor of hydroxychloroquine - I didn’t think there was anyone left that actually believes media and academia are not tragically biased (maybe you’re that last one - well done).
So this is what winning looks like under Trump's Presidency.   Yep so much winning.   US economy posts its worst drop on record
No trump his killing off his buddies.
Trump is already attempting to take control of every branch of the government. It's as obvious as the nose on Putin's face. BEWARE OF TRUMP!!!
Trump could kill somone in Tulsa and his supporters wouldn’t care!

As he was a Trump supporter, will Trump mention Cain’s passing?
GDP is down, Obama is giving an eulogy, Fauci threw out the first pitch...Trump just had to tweet something so the media would talk about HIM.
Herman attended the Tulsa rally and got sick right after....hmmmm. NO WAY they are connected. I think all older and sickly Trump supporters should continue to go to ANY rally he has and/or meet in large groups to talk about how great Scott Baio is.
Trump killed him
People blaming Trump for a down GDP clearly don't understand how a world economy works  Or any economy in that regard   If you shut down businesses for MONTHS and don't have any international trade........surprisingly, money isn't exchanged for goods/services
Five states already rely exclusively on mail-in ballots, and they say they have necessary safeguards in place to ensure that a hostile foreign actor doesn't disrupt the vote.
Damn.... Trump - talking about delaying the election.
We should all want to do the opposite of what Trump wants!
Considering that Trump keeps inviting Putin and other foreign adversaries to interfere in the election, voting by mail would have the least amount of voter fraud.
Trump wants to rig this right in our faces.
From CNN: Trump floats delaying election despite lack of authority to do so Trump floats delaying election despite lack of authority to do so   ( watch out, Trump WILL make a move to take TOTAL control of U.S. Government)

Yes and Trump is seeing it for what it is and taking action. We don’t need to have all those troops in Germany.

OMG! You're a HillBot. I am so glad she lost a Trump. Kamala is a Hillary clone and I HATE her for that.   I'll be grudgingly vote for Biden as long as he doesn't pick Harris as VP.
Yes! I was going to go along with the Biden thing because I want to get rid of Trump. But if he picks Kamala Harris, I'm writing Bernie Sander's name in. F that crap, I'm not voting for that bi%ch.
True but if he picks a running mate I hate, wanting to get rid of Trump isn't enough to make me vote.
Yeah- I’m starting to give up hope. I pray if trump wins re election that the democrats take majority over the senate. If they have the house and senate they can stop a lot of the crap he is doing. If that doesn’t happen we’re screwed.
We’re doomed with Trump and the GOP betraying the nation.
Saw a lady at Target with a Trump 2020 mask on and I gagged in my BLM mask. Whoops🤷🏼‍♀️
Please add Barr in there because there's a high chance he would infect Trump.
Who has two thumbs and doesn’t like Trump? This girl.      👎👎#NobodyLikesTrump
Let's hope he gave it to Barr and he gives it to Trump and Pence. 🙏🏼
As an older member of Generation X, I find this very sad.  I remember the dawn of the space shuttles, the rise of the internet, and the end of the cold war with great fondness.  We need to make more great moments for the next generation.  Maybe start with the end of the Trump Era
Trump is the enemy. It’s simple.

I bet you were all for the Trump tax cut for the rich. But a few extra bucks for the people struggling to survive is to much for you. That $600 will go directly into the economy unlike the tax cut for the rich.
Trump’s policies are also helping Texas to record record numbers of new Corona virus cases as well as deaths. Maybe Trump needs to reconsider changing some of his policies.

Thank you President Trump. We want are country back. You can’t have your freedom of speech when you won’t let others have theirs. And it’s not a peace demonstration as soon as you start destroying others property.

Trump &amp; GOP are getting desperate. They know he's going to lose in a landslide to a weak candidate so they're using socialism as a scare tactic.   Joe Biden is NOT a Trojan Horse for Progressives, AOC &amp; Bernie. 🤣🤣 He's actually an old style Repub. That's what is scaring them.
You know it’s going to be a crazy day when Trump goes twitter crazy before you even leave for work. Buckle up Twitter Family something big is happening.
No there’s no pmt due. Are you aware of the fact that the orange slime is ok with putin paying the Taliban to kill Americans soldiers? Probably not. The senate has been told  but trump didn’t know??? Just another lie to add on to the 20,000.+. He is an embarrassment to the USA.
Biden is a well balanced, caring man who shows America needs him. Joe doesn’t need groupies, we get when we have Joe, truth &amp; visionAccording to the polls America loves Joe. We need calm but mostly someone we can trust, that Joe. With trump, it’s been 3-1/2 years ofchaos &amp; fear.
Trump is the first president to build a “spaceforce” #AlienDNA it’s starting to make sense 🤔🤕
Trump has thrown people into his administration that he knows nothing about throughout his entire term. It's one of the few things he's consistent at. And with an 88% turnover rate, it's painfully clear he's picking the wrong people every single time.
trump costs the US taxpayers millions every year because of his golfing on his own properties. Scum.
I read recently that trump had $400,000 from the campaign funds to his personal account. I wouldn’t be surprised.
The Trump administration said Tuesday that it will reject new applications and shorten renewal periods for an Obama-era program that shields young people from deportation.
I have never said, "Christ, Almighty," out loud so many times since Trump took office, and I genuinely do not believe there can possibly be a higher power.
Yes, you can always make fun of him for those things. But I wouldn’t end a relationship because of it. Now if he thinks Trump’s great, I’d run for the hills.
Wrong...he said a "woman of color", not necessarily black.  It's my opinion that she will be black in order to shore up the black vote since Trump's support was high in the black community prior to the George Floyd protests / riots.
The so-called doctor Trump and his son retweeted lying about how hydroxychloroquine works also says alien DNA is used in medical treatments and science is creating vaccines that immunize against becoming religious.  WTF?   You just can't make this shit up.
“Demon Semen”.  Isn’t that what produced Trump’s kids??
Ask Trump to recite the first fifty digits of pi and he’d ask:  “Apple or cherry?”

Yeah how about we listen to the Hong Kong protester from a few months ago   "Donald Trump don't trust China, China is asshole"
They couldn’t. Trump wants it to go private. Putting funding in would cause him to throw a temper tantrum.  Number 1 rule. Don’t make the child angry.
That's really funny considering I hate Hillary Clinton And Neolib Democrats. I'm a socialist who voted Trump in 2016. So back the F down.
Donald Trump's re-election campaign is buying ads on #Facebook that spread dangerous disinformation about voting. Facebook’s business model is subverting democracy. Tell federal regulators to investigate!

Have you read the Steele Dossier?  Why want you acknowledge that it is based on lies??  Why want you acknowledge that Obama illegally spied on Trump's campaign??  You are brainwashed, that's why!!
Was he convicted of anything?  Was there any "smoking gun" of Russian collusion? Yet you think that Trump should've helped Mueller out more when the investigation was based on the LIES OF A FALSE DOSSIER!!  So you can take your Mueller Report and shove it up your arse!!
You're the one who said that I believe anything that Trump says (which I don't), so I'm throwing the same logic back at you.  You haven't denied your love of Obama, have you?
You worship at the feet of Obama. It doesn't bother you at all that Obama illegally spied on the Trump campaign because for you others, the end always justifies the means.  You probably take a knee and pray to BLM and Kaeperdick each night before you go to bed.
It was the same thing when John McCain passed. He hated that the Obama’s were welcome but he wasn’t. Ohhhh—OBAMA!!😤😖😤😩😢😭 Trump wants a RING!🍊🤡💩🤬🤷🏻‍♀️🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊☮️❄️
I've read parts but why would I read something in its complete entirety that's based on a false dossier.  Why would I believe someone who is part of the deep state apparatus and is a sworn enemy of Trump?
How many Russians did Obama or Bush kill? What did the coward Obama do when Assad crossed his "red line".  Here's how Trump responded and how many Russians he killed:
I honestly can say, I’m beyond disappointed that we’ve continued to wait for the system to work &amp; remove him, yet nothing. Trump is using the system to commit his crimes. Had the system worked, most of the 150k would still be alive &amp; we would have barely heard about Covid-19.
How is Trump a traitor?  I understand that you may not like him, or even hate him, but exactly how has he committed treason???
Trump virus,  That's what we should call it.😠😠😠😠
The attorney general will also touch on other controversies that have shadowed his tenure, including his handling of the investigation into Trump campaign ties to Russia.

agreed. 538 gave trump the best chances in 2016 and polling was pretty conclusive that Comey letter was a massive deciding factor late which broke Trump's way which was the election.
Completely agree. It was great pre- Donald Trump.  Let’s go back.
I completely agree with Donald Trump. I too am disgusted by all of negative trending tweets. As Donald has had 3.5 years to do something positive and has yet to deliver, apparently the only option is to have him removed from office.
Sure, give Trump another 4 years b/c you are sore loosers.
Iam definitely voting for Joe Biden, there is no.way I would ever vote for Trump. In my opinion he represents  everything a leader of this country should not be. It may take awhile to correct the damage he has done but we can do it.  #ResistanceTaskForce

Trump is depending on the pandemic to prevent them from voting  in Hope of more votes for him. That's why he's pushing that it's safe to socialize and return to school without becoming infected. He doesn't care if you get sick after the election.
Up to 150k now. And no more mask for Trump?  No photo op needed?
The clip of part of the border wall falling over during the recent tropical storm in Texas would be a perfect icon for Trump’s entire term.
I honestly don’t see how it’s wrong, he’s not endorsing trump bye doing this and it’s not even for him. I just think it’s funny how some people are going to take everything he does and blow it out of proportion and make things worse then they need to be
You lie to yourself. Trump or America. Fu if you support a traitor who has let 150k Americans die and us soldiers.
Do you have a position with the Trump campaign or do you just generally violate the Hatch Act?
Good. At this point the less I see or hear from Trump, the better.
Trump’s team will never get it. ‘Getting it’ requires a desire to understand a problem and skills to determine effective solutions.  Trump and team have opinions and the confidence to speak. They are talking heads, not problem solvers.
If Donald Trump questions the election results it will be because his election tampering didn't work.
Will MAGA MAGA MAGA TRUMP all the way
Once Trump is in the ground, I plan on eating 2 medium Little Ceasars pizzas and a 6-pack of Blatz then head to his grave and wait. Just sayin.’
President Donald Trump in recent days suddenly acknowledged the gravity of the coronavirus pandemic. Here's a review of some of his statements on that and more from the past week.

A chump and a trump
Especially if you’re a Trump crony! You ought to be in jail along with the rest of this criminally corrupt administration
The wind blows almost as big as Trump.
Has anyone figured out the exact reason that Trump is trying to kill off voters
Fact Check: Trump's False, Recurring Claim About Biden's Stance on Police  ( And NBC's KWQC in Davenport, Iowa keeps playing it 🤣🤑🤣🤑🤣🤑🤣🤑🤣🤑 )
Tens of thousands more deaths in the way and states still don’t have enough ppe or tests. Failure 100% Trump’s fault.
1500k and counting. And still no response to the bounties. Failure at a massive scale from Trump.
The point of this tweet (just attempting an interpretation) is Trump's use of feds in protests is being exploited by Dems and taking away from the BLM movement even tho Obama could have done way more to help protesters at Standing Rock. That's what he gets at in the comments.FOR. TRUMP
The skinniest guy at the gym right now is wearing a Trump 2020 hat. Maybe not the best decision? You may say: “It’s 2020, we aren’t savages nobody will take exception to it.” I say, yeah it’s 2020 have you watched the news at all this year?
Do we know for sure Herman Cain caught the virus at the Trump rally?
Battery charge dropped against R. Kelly girlfriend - Chicago Sun-Times
And some say Trump isn’t Presidential. He would never make a political speech at a funeral and stoke racial violence . That’s as sleazy as you can be.
If Trump was a fascist he wouldn’t tweet about delaying the election, he would just delay it and send thugs to beat people up at the polls. I’m not seeing that yet, but I’ll keep my eyes open.
#America, you have endured many dark challenges and times of deep despair, without a doubt, TRUMP and his GOP enablers personify the most grotesque times in OUR history. When the sun rises past this moment, we need to take a LONG, HARD look at democracy. Yet, my flag flies high.
He doesn’t have to tell you why he support President Trump. It’s his given right to support who he wants.
Again, it comes down to choice...some will choose to go to school while others are to afraid...  Everything is a risk... Democrats have been trying to scuttle the economy ever since Trump became president... shutdown is an opportunity for them.
Cain was a card carrying Trump believer. Kissed the ring and believed the BS. A rally that should have never happened. This is so unfortunate. #RIPHermanCain
At John Lewis’ funeral, President Obama metaphorically pulled Trump’s pants down around his ankles and then bitched-slapped him repeatedly. Damn! #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica2020
If only the Trump administration had a competent lawyer who could explain this stuff to them. Alas, all they have is Rudy "Goolie" Giuliani and "Bagjob" Billy Barr. It's a shame, really.
On the same day 3 presidents honored John Lewis for his amazing commitment to civil rights and equality, Trump tweeted about gutting the fair housing act by eliminating a provision for communities to provide fair housing opportunities for lower income people. November.  Vote.
I hate that people talk like this. If Donald Trump loses John Roberts will swear Joe Biden in on January 20th and then Trump is a private citizen with no power. The idea that he will stay is ridiculous.
No idea; I don't think I even get Fox News. They're not really going to pivot until someone else has and taken all the heat for it (remember banks charging ATM fees?). Once Trump's allies begin to desert him en masse, Fox will jump on the bandwagon.
Friday night on The Board Hitters &amp; Bourbon podcast™️  it’s the Battle of the Millionaires (no not Biden vs Trump) as I’ll be previewing Sat’s G1 Whitney Stakes (a  Win &amp; You’re In Race) at Saratoga
Herman Cain quite possibly died because he went to a Trump Rally and caught COVID yet we still have losers making fun of joe biden making fun of him doing events from his basement studio
please gets these guys off the air! 1)Trump is trolling! 2) There is no more normal 3) How much free air time is he getting with this latest tweet? 4) Conservatives will come out &amp; vote 5) He’s down in the polls because ppl on the left are nuts so we’re quiet!
can’t remember the last time trump has been ahead in florida.
It's all about what the military decides to do in my book.  As of now, much evidence points to the military turning on Trump if he attempts a self-coup.  Even former MIC lobbyist and current Defense Secretary Esper is against using the Insurrection Act.
Nope, not buying it. November 3rd.!  People can just come out of their fearful hiding or not! I will &amp; I will vote for Trump.
Anyone who believes twitter will change anything because a bunch of useless politicians threaten them needs a reality check.   They will change when Trump breaks the company into 80 parts then declares 80 new utilities. Standard Oil circa 1911.
Cancel The election there’s a pandemic!!!! Send your kids to school the pandemic is fake!!!!! All said by Donald Trump within 4 hrs of each other.  What a joke you are.
You are, of course, talking about Donald “Putin” Trump
Trump is just trying to distract from news that we experienced the worst economic drop in HISTORY.  Don’t let him forget.  Everyone should remind him.   #US #WorstPresidentEver #COVID19
Well said.  I'll crawl over broken glass to get rid of Trump. And then you'll have my full attention as you need to be removed as well. No more millionaire/billionaire politicians. We need centrist people who can actually relate to every day people not just pay lip service.
You don't have proof that all this looting and destruction was done by  just BLM protesters, could have been done by White supremacist Trump supporters like the guy at AutoZone.
How about we move the election forward? The sooner we dump Trump, the better.
Every single day hundreds of Americans are dying of something that should have been contained months ago.  The blood is on Trump’s hands and he doesn’t care, anything to get re-elected.
Donald Trump delaying the election, even if he could, makes no sense for his gain. Because he technically wasn’t re-elected he wouldn’t be sworn in as President. Pelosi wouldn’t either and bc GOP has more seats in the Senate the next person in line is Sen. Leahy and he’d be Pres.
I hate that Joe Walsh has been able to come into good terms with dems because he’s anti-trump. Everyone in Illinois knows how much of a scumbag the guy truly is.
And Trump will release his tax returns too.
Dumb Donald Trump doesn’t have a clue as to what he’s doing in the WH. In fact I hear he gets lost at least once a day and can’t find his way to the Oval Office
Yep. Angry idiots that hate Trump. Blind hate is the worst.
Sometimes I ask myself, how much damage Trump &amp; co plan to incflict upon us in Nov-Dec-Jan?
Joe Biden for President 2020. In my opinion, Trump's all ready lost. He is losing big time in the general election. Trump needs to resign.
Biden for President 2020. Let's see who will win in November. Trump's all ready lost based on how he's handled everything recently. Trump is currently losing in the general election. Deal with that.
My disgust with Trump and you is near the same level. So hopefully when we get rid of him in Nov, Ill has a similar movement to remove you. Politicians shouldn't be millionaires completely out of step with everyday people's lives and happiness. Today you broke people's trust

Pritzker and Trump are the same. Just different sides. Both wrong in their handling of this.
It's July 29th and Trump still hasn't resigned yet.
I am not sure what you are missing. Illinois has been responsible- numbers say so. The youth sports rollback was unwarranted. Pritzker and Trump are almost equal idiots on different sides. Bring me a politician who has reasonable pragmatic solutions.
Trump announced plans today to move forward with withdrawing 12,000 troops from Germany.   Area churches are bracing for the impact.
I won't vote for Trump in November.
In a time like we are having now, it is selfish of them to make a new building. Do you think it's a coincidence it is across from the Trump hotel? What does Trump have to gain by having it close to his hotel? I hope you are able to stop this from being built.
Trump is a FRAUD!!! A DISGRACE! A TRAITOR! Try putting on your big boy pants and "adulting" for a while. We know you can't! #PersonWomanManCameraTV. People are laughing AT you and disgusted BY you...mostly both!
Donald Trump administration failed the COVID response and we now have 150k deaths and 13% unemployment  Loser Sexist Leftists Priorities:
Trump needs to resign.
Unfortunately you’ll have to do Trump. I bet it would be a nightmare.
This is gross, even for Trump. Why are so many "evangelicals" captivated by this man?
You’re not welcome. You’re columns are a joke. But it is fun to check your headline after the latest Trump atrocity and see you writing about some fucking Greek recipe. Priorities right?
and  are the same guy. Different ideologies but overbearing, overreaching, power hungry politicians looking to control everything. BOTH need to go down. No common sense on either side. Pritzker=Trump
We Lost the Battle for the Republican Party’s Soul Long Ago
Phew...the alien craft has landed to take Trump away.
These are Trump’s “celebrity” supporters. LMAO
My guess is years ago. Trump praised Epstein and wished Maxwell “well” last week. If you can’t tell the difference I’ll get you a connect the dots book.
I am voting for Trump. I have been a Democrat my whole life.  I have switched to being 100% Republican.  I posted the video going around in regards to the front line doctors and I shared it on fb. FB said FAKE NEWS and removed my post. WHERE IS MY FIRST AMENDMENT RIGHT????
C’mon.  Please stop playing cute games.  You also wrote “In his [Cuomo’s] defense, there was a lot we did not know then that we know now.”  But at the same time you make a chart and blame every death on Trump, and I have never seen you make ANY caveats about that chart.
maybe change "Demon Sperm" to "Demon Semen" for the silly rhyme? I can't decide if that would be more or less absurd; my absurd-o-meter crapped out pretty early on in the Trump administration.
Or windmills cause cancer. Or this beauty: “I tested very positively in another sense. I tested positively toward negative. I tested perfectly this morning, meaning I tested negative," President Trump says.
You give Cuomo a pass, but not Trump?  I don’t know how to talk to you.  It’s all politics with you.  Not with me.  I’m about the data.
"We used to push Biden to put forward a vision beyond beating Trump, but since he won't try, I guess we won't either!"
Whatever data that exists today, will change tomorrow.  What I don’t understand is how people can say Cuomo did a great job, while DeSantis and Trump did a bad job.  Deaths in Florida are multiples less than NY, with a bigger population.
I know at least 50 black people and none to my knowledge support Trump.
Trump struggles to speak in coherent sentences too... I miss Obama, at least the man could talk.
Obviously Trump loves him to death.
I think what the media does to Kanye West parallels what it does to Trump, giving a premium for outrageousness. This sells papers and TV time, but also hurts everybody, in the process.
I've been looking for an explanation for why clearly intelligent women like Jenna, Kayleigh &amp; other women in Trump land act and speak as they do....and there it is...."nocturnal sex with demons while they sleep". Thanks Doc.
Thank god its a tropical storm and not trump in the USA responsible for 150,000 lives in the states and 200 from PR. God is blessing you.
And the states have it better eith trump. Lol
Trump is worst and COVID-19 is aldo worst.
the women who vote for trump also hate women so this doesn’t effect them unfortunately 🙃
Drug price has been controlled by FDA been for years. Did not just happened now.  Trump may reduced some the medicine not all the medicine especially not fair to seniors
Dear president I like you to know I have heard radio advertising in Chicago radio news station as”Trump play dirty tricks raise millions money out of your electricity please tell your law maker for clean energy to save money and creat jobs”.  Ad was lies.
Chris Hayes is the definition of a “Well Actually” type of person. Eveyone knows what Joe Biden meant but Chris Hayes is out here trying to make it look like Biden wants to criminally punish speech.   This stuff isn’t shocking from Chris “Trump is to the left of Hillary” Hayes.
Wrong... America under Trump's (lack of) leadership
Donald John Trump June 14, 1946 -- July 29, 2020
I’m glad you know all.  Like what tests they are using, like who they are testing, like how deaths and hospitalizations are reported.  It’s all different, but you compare and not correctly.  Also, if Trump is lying about the stats, then why are they worse?
We need President Trump for at least the next 4years or more.
That’s exactly why the Dems today in the Barr hearing were saying that Trump wants a Law &amp; Order campaign, but then said it was Trump who was breaking the law.  Ludicrous, but they knew their job.

This is why Trump didn’t want an accountability or oversight
leave the drawing lines on hurricane maps to Trump.
What is your definition of effective? It reduces symptoms sometimes up to 50%. That’s not effective enough. Add in the fact tha Trump has a vesting interest and you can understand why he and his minions are pushing the shit.
Every time Trump tweets, we donate to swing state organizers working to ensure he doesn’t get reelected. #DefeatByTweet
Who needs a salary when you continue to build hotels in Russia and around the world. A direct conflict of interest. Or when you have the govt foot the bill for staff and secret service to stay at your Florida resort and the money finds its was back to Trump. Another illegal move.
WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump said Monday he will not be attending memorial services for civil rights icon Rep. John Lewis this week. So, we know what’s wrong with Trump. The question is what’s wrong with us? VOTE for a civil society. Vote Joe Biden. Please.
was Trump unable to drain the swamp there?
you're selling out the gospel by using your platform to promote political causes and worship Trump
Best one yet. Trump Virus robbed us.
what is most appalling to me is that Trump literally places his own re-election chances over people's lives... I don't think he would be downplaying this pandemic so much if we weren't in an election year.
1. Masks definitely work. 2. Hydroxychloroquine is very questionable. 3. This virus is serious despite what our dictator says. 4. Trump is far more mentally unstable than Biden. 5. Our constitutional right to peacefully protest is being threatened. You are fake news, sir.
Donald Trump doesn’t care about black people....    Actions speak louder than words. His disrespect towards people is disgusting.
How about reporting on scott Baio and how he molested nicole eggert and is now headlining a trump rally. Give kopech some room
I thought it was you at first read!! I have to say tRump is very unhinged at the moment and I am loving it! 😂
Trump will soon have his Dr. confirm his skin is in fact very thick!  The thickness skin ever.
Exactly. Senator for 32 years and VP for 8. And I think you better check your records if you think he’s accomplished nothing. Health care reform, taking on the NRA (twice) and winning. Nothing is what Trump has accomplished. No campaign promises fulfilled. Obamacare is still here
The trump one time shoppers forgot about them. We have not purchased any either.
American Dignity and Honor.  At this time it also makes me feel hopeful that we will have a President that will honor those that have done so much for the people. Trump is shameful!
Unironically “I left the left because some Trump voters were nice to me once.”
We do know what we’re getting with Trump. A 100% shit show. More disastrous foreign policy. More destruction of the environment. More economic collapse. More Covid deaths. More utter disdain for policy and rule of law. 2020 is time to take out the trash. Enjoy prison, Don.
Did I miss something? Biden’s been President for 40 years? I never realized one Senator could fix everything! And if we wanted someone to accomplish nothing we would all vote for Trump strictly on his track record.
Law and order belongs to Trump. Biden owns this.
If Trump is responsible for the 325 Coronavirus deaths in the US today Cuomo must be responsible for the 32,000 YTD in NY state.
Everyone knows that! You’re blind with Trump  lust. He was golfing and having Klan rallies 22 days in Feb! He didn’t care. Called it a hoax. Said it would magically go away. He’s responsible. He’s the President. It’s his job. And he did it poorly!
You show respect and attend. You ignore criticism and be the bigger man.    Something Trump can’t do
How is it possible to only blame Trump?
This shows what a dumb executive Trump was even before President. People are not going to risk their health and safety for a tax write-off. Nor would any respectable management team compel them to. If you want business roaring, kill the virus #TrumpIsACompleteFailure
We were woefully unprepared for the virus. Only a fraction of the PPE necessary for first responders. Maybe if Trump wasn’t having Klan rallies and playing golf like he did 22 days in February the country would’ve been better prepared.
Everyone should read this soldier’s account. Trump’s Little Green Men are the goons of a tyrant.
Good News that Trump's tweets don't get the attention they used to.
No because it helps Trump. They are incompetent and scared shitless of the media.
This is the kind of irrational thought that Trump has embedded into his followers. Ten years from now most of these people will look back like people do looking back at their youth and say “What the hell was I thinking?”

Class action lawsuits coming to the governors who banned it. The media that scoffed Trump as well.
Here’s what the great American propaganda machine is asking you to believe. 1. A man with advanced Alzheimer’s could have stopped the Coronavirus cold. 2. No law and order is better than law and order(see Seattle, Chicago, and Portland)3. The great economy of Trump means zilch.
With all the "winning" taking place you'd think Trump's supporters would be a happy, joyous people.

We all forget, but way back in the 80s, Oprah was an uplifting story.  She was an interesting person and not overly political.  When she had real estate developer Donald Trump on, it was a great show.  She was an inspiring figure and somehow, that all got lost.
President Trump reelection would end the Democratic party as we know it

Trump needs to resign.
a nice sight to see today in the west suburbs of Chicago. A real life #TrumpTrain2020. #MAGA #Trump
It is very obvious that some citizens and wanna be citizens don’t like my country. My country in February was near perfect before the Chinese imported sickness and death here.   If you don’t agree and are so thick you blame Trump for the virus just get your ass out of here.
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
Think about it. Trump is law and order and Biden is riot and loot.
Lori and his wife are caricature of themselves... kinda reminds me of the farmer and his wife... or Nancy &amp; Chucky... Would be funny except under their leadership, "No Lives Matter"  It's all about taking down Trump.
There is only two that can win so it must be nice for you to not have to worry about Trump winning a second term!
💯 This is so many people and why Trump and Republicans will be blown out in Nov
President Trump won in a LANDSLIDE.
Trump says Biden will destroy the suburbs, so I guess it’s goodbye to all this. Not! ⁦ The words of a delusional racist soon to be gone.#VoteBlueToEndThisNightmare
The more the riots continue the better for Trump. Riot away morons.
Opioid overdoses may be 75% of Coronavirus deaths this year. Seen anything in the media? No, you stopped getting Coronavirus deaths when they dropped.   Closed borders will reduce the former and that’s a Trump agenda.
She needs a cognitive test herself, she is like a ping pong ball. Back and forth. duh. They all know trump will win and it drives them crazy, love it.
What do u mean after November? They still haven’t accepted the results from 4 years ago! Even if Trump loses, their playbook isn’t gonna stop. It’s a Marxist communist takeover of America.
You’ll be sorry. Trump 2020
We are a 2 party system, like it or not. A write in for Bernie is a vote for Trump. It’s exactly this thinking that will keep things from changing.
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
What evidence made a Trump supporter punching someone politicall motivated?  He could just be a hater of other people and a fighter.
Bernell Trammell, a black Milwaukee businessman, who openly supported President Trump was gunned down on July 23rd. Politically motivated?  I searched google: not one CNN, Wash Post or NYT story.  Remember when a Trump supporter punched someone? Stories everywhere!
If Trump were the mayor of Chicago crime would be under control. Let that sink in because Biden is less competent that Lightfoot.
The night Trump was elected I was in shock, I felt this crushing depression and couldn’t sleep for days after. I didn’t even like HRC but I voted for her.
Interesting how so many people who hate "political correctness", "cancel culture", and "SJWs" are also full card-carrying members of the Tone Police who will say "this is why Trump won" when you call somebody out for supporting bigotry because you weren't "respectful enough". Hm.
We didn’t make a mistake, Trump has done great things and brought a number of evils out into the light. Evil is always most active when it has been discovered and cornered. The left is cornered and throwing a temper tantrum.
For 4th day in a row 1,000 Americans have died from Vuris. What do  &amp; right Trump sycophants like  do? Help?  Strategy? $? Plan? Maybe even a photo opp at a Food pantry? NO....Attack the scientists: Die Fuhrer  ist Gott!
I take my Trump joke everywhere, but secret police follow me home. (If anyone knows where I stole that, you either are old, or watched TV with your grandparents like me).
How can you even say this?  You are showing your opportunist side... all enablers like you are only clamoring to get attention.  The GOP has totally ruined the Republican Party by allowing this President to corrupt all with whom he associates.  Sad. Trump has no soul.Correction: *Trump Virus

Haven't tweeted in awhile but have been following closely every day the epidemic, the economy and other current events.  If anyone feels compelled to vote for Trump in Nov., you really need to examine everything that has gone wrong in your life to make you feel that way.
Don't let Trump check another box on the fascist checklist. And when we elect him out we have to help ensure that he is the last person to take us this close. My 93 year old grandfather didn't lie about his age to destroy an evil to live to see it happen here.
It's been proven that Russia interfered in our last election. That's why trump won!  Get the facts straight, Trumper.
Thread by  Fascism. Authoritarianism. The question has always been, could it happen here? Because the answer has been NO doeat it will always be so. It is happening here. It is happening right now. Trump crossed the rubicon this morning.…

This is your reply when presented the facts, I expected that. You #DATS are so scared of accountability, almost as scared as the #POUTINGpotus himself.  Good thing Trump listened to his military be fore Covid:
If it was real Putin would see this as an opportunity, not a threat. Trump must be really, really worried.
Explain how forcing service members to suffer w/o the FDA approved medications that are legally prescribed is supporting our military?  Maybe you can explain why Col. Vindman was chastised for doing his job? After all, he just gave Trump's hand picked AG his findings.

It's intentional so less people can vote. He will also make 600thousand full time jobs to be gone never to return. 2021 welcome the greatest depression that any country has ever seen. All on loser trump.

You know more about trump than any other writer anywhere. Thank you Seth I appreciate your work.
A real President to the world to admire not hate as they hate trump. Their hate for trump is well deserved. We all hate the loser ourselves.
Those teachers are crazy not to strike. You can't teach when you know we will die because your state couldn't do what was necessary to get the Trump Virus under control. This is trumps virus not China just Trumps virus.
See it’s always just the one work place or the community. Trump makes it okay to be a bigot. And I’m sorry you feel that way. I’m going to let you keep sipping on your haterade. My battle is not with you. It’s at the ballot box.
Why isn't Trump?
Yes he did. Just like he killed the 150K dead Americans because trump refused to do his job.
Wow sounds like an awful lot of haterade. #JohnLewis was a civil rights hero who shed blood for our rights in this country. He didn’t give a bunch of lip service. He inspired others. Exactly who did Herman Cain and Donald Trump inspire? I’ll just let you enjoy your haterade.

Who asked you? And trump did a mock election using mail ins and some of the votes got lost. Please educate yourself bc you don’t know if all the votes go in.
And you look him straight in the face and say stop lying your fascist pig. Not trump he just says whatever you say sir I am your servant.
This would be just desserts for Republicans. Dropping out so late in the game would basically let Biden walk in with the Presidency unopposed.  Not in a million years. Trump is going to grift all the way to the end.
trump doesn't do anything that Putin doesn't tell him to do. Trump is putins bitch.
liar, liar trump is on fire burn liar burn.
Obama and Biden made Putin shit in his pants scared not trump he is owned by putin. Putin has no fear of this coward no matter what he does.
Since Trump wants to delay the election, how about all his supporters vote in December? The rest of us will vote on Nov. 3.
I wouldn't be too sure about that, Trumper!  The country's had enough of trump's incompetence.
The day trump was seated in the white house.
trump and all his lies
One that is allowing Putin to kill our Veterans. My family did not fight and some die for this country to allow Putin rule. Trump is a nitwit that committed Treason to repay a debt to Putin because the big banks in America cut him off. Now we  are all paying for trump feelings
Trump loves his pizza young and fresh.
Sadly today one of Trump’s supporters lost his life due to COVID... is it real now  .. if not now then when?
I am watching a real President, Barack Obama giving his eulogy at the Honorable John Lewis funeral. The one word that stands out is HOPE. Listening to him reminds me of the good days before the Trump family fiasco. HOPE.
I really enjoy talking to Trump supporters.   Person: “well, the president said no debt is collectable right now because of the Chink Virus.”  Me: Well, the president doesn’t pay his own debts so I’m not surprised he would say that. Also, that’s pretty racist to call it that.
So Trump wants to delay the election...has that EVER happened in the 244 years of being a country??
And that’s another reason Trump has to go. . . . He has none of those qualities.
Trump’s Campaign Is Pretending There’s No Pandemic
No!  It's time for trump's goon squad to clear out of Portland so the governor can do her job!  Too bad trump wasn't so gung ho at the beginning of Covid-19!
Once he is convicted of his crimes he shouldn't be allowed to hold on to the former President title. Oh, Trump, Biden will not pardon you ala Nixon.
To a degree I am. The supporters of Trump might, just might see how they have been fooled. Our country will not recognize MAGA supporters who at this time are not afraid to show their birthright racism. Y'all go back to them thar hills.
The mail in voting must be harder for trump to rig. That's the only reason he's against it!
I think fake news, whether social, print and video media is not going away for awhile. I can see GOP after Trump will still use this tactic
Have the country did not trust our last election becase of proven Russian interference but Trump was still elected.
That’s just it you don’t know my life. You have no clue what I’m experiencing at this moment and yes it’s because of Trump. He gives the greenlight and 👍🏾 for bigots to be hateful and vengeful. I face it everyday at work, out in the community.
They want death so Trump can cancel the election and steal the country and give it to Putin officially.
has there been reporting specifically about cases after the Trump Tulsa  rally? Now that we know for sure  at least one person died because he went to that rally, it got me wondering.
I think he truly did good, don't trust Trump in the slightest. He exaggerates things and isn't good at all even as a human being, let alone the leader of a country. It's pathetic so many voted for him.
I wonder if all the Dems who were ok with Trump’s campaign being spied on would be ok if he were to do the same to Biden.
That he was whacked?
Check out our most recent newsletter!
Mark, great human and correct response. It has to be said however that same decency would not come from Trump and his pals.
Even better, take your mail-in/absentee ballot (actually, the same thing, Mr. Trump!) to your county courthouse and deliver it in-person with a photo taken by a witness! Take no chance that your vote can be lost!
I hate seeing anyone die in this pandemic, but this one was particularly avoidable. Another of 150,000 deaths at the door of Trump's ego.
Another Russian tactic. When is Trump going to realize Russia is making a fool out of him?
That’s cause his “base” is “Jim Jonesed” They will follow Trump into Hell.
Watching Trump niece. Mary,  in remarkable interviews and realizing he not only emulates, he also seeks revenge against his vicious father and Trump cruelty.

Trump and his fascist friends will do EVERYTHING they can to steal this election. The vote has to be protected. We have descended into being a third world country where elections are decided by the ruling junta in advance. American democracy is under attack.

Trump's an incompetent failure!  Look at what's happening to our country because of his failure, Trumper!
Where's trump's award for being the best Russian asset ever?  Quit deflecting and open your eyes, Trumper!
Hit home, Trumper?  They're two decent people that love their country and don't want to see it divided like trump is doing.
Thank you for that. I really needed to hear that. Trump is making life even harder for me nowadays. The fight must continue until bigotry gets the message it’s no longer welcomed in the United States
I’m definitely a suburban Black woman for Biden because Trump has got to exit stage left immediately!
I hope this is the finale of Trump's unreal show. During the Inauguration Ceremony. The one he refused to go to.
this dude weird ash💀💀 really went through all my tweets because I support trump😂 f*cking liberals have no life
Exactly! The world of laws regarding technology are abysmal to say the least! Looking at our past nit wits in office since the Internet has come of age, it’s no wonder that Trump has to clean up this mess too.
. , . , . , . , . , . , . . , . , . , . ...  *This* story *needs* to be covered *immediately*!  This mail-in voting prevention scam by Donald Trump *needs* to be exposed!
Trump has been the president America has had since JFK
Laura, you Trump Tool. 9,000 new Texas cases may be less than a couple days ago, but hardly "looking good".
I have a funny feeling that I could sell a lot of these at a Trump rally
I wouldn't last a session spraying Trump's fat ass.

Trump Supporters Get Angry As Campaign Spams Them With Sleazy Text Messages  via  Ring of Fire Network #GOP
Trump is, yes
Trump is literally spitting in the faces of MLK, John Lewis and too many more to name here. What hurts more is that people will justify accept and fall for this bigotry. Instead of advancing our rights they’re trying to legally take them away.
The military will not get any money trump will steal it for his stupid useless wall. The rest of America will be homeless with not food. This is when the rich will know what suffering feels like. We will usher in the Greatest Depression ever seen. All on trump and the GOP.
Your such a coward you won't even take out Putin who declared war on the United States of America. Trump is a Coward he must be removed now.
Here comes WWIII America against Putin/Russia and China. America if it had a real president would have already gotten rid of putin but trump is a coward.
You and trump did this loser mcconnell married to communist and steals our tax dollars. Vote this loser putin lover out of our country. He deserves the death penalty for treason. Treason is unacceptable. Why is Putin still alive he declared war on America and he is still alive.
Putin declared war on the United States of America why is he still alive?  Why? because trump is a coward. He must remove a leader of this country for being a coward to survive and take putin down forever.
Just more stupid trump decisions. Trump is the most stupid man on earth.
No I now I am done with cowards and lies. Why is Putin still walking and talking. He declared War on the United States and coward Trump did not attack his enemy and just allowed him to win without a fight.
Most importantly he is truely a coward. He isn't going after Putin because he is afraid of the little man that lives in russia. Trump is cowering someplace in a Bunker because he's afraid of Putin.
Brilliant ad.
People don't dislike trump they HATE trump with every fiber of their life.
I believe he can be sued by anyone else that gets sick from his refusal to stop the spread of the virus. Gohmert is a intentional spreader of the Trump Virus.
This stupid remark shows America just how stupid and detached trump is from America. Suburbs are all different wage earners. He's just scum trump is worth less than scum.
Yes he is and he will do nothing to stop putin. We must stop Putin ourselves. trump is owned by putin he is scared of putin and will not confront him because he is a coward. We must find help through another country to help us since trump is to weak to protect America.
What happens Marco when we all know YOU are the wicked and our ransoming our families health from a violent power that is trump and putin. You do nothing but support the criminals and the violence. God sees your now a sinner using his name to commit your crimes. Go to hell.
He really does not. This is why we the people must take of Putin to protect our own Country because trump never will.
Barr is a traitor to America he needs to be evicted from America never welcomed back. Barr and trump and McConnell along with Pompeo are all traitors to our country we can expel them legally.
No surprise. I said earlier we need to physically remove trump now and deposit him into a jail where he needs to await trail for treason. The HOP refuses to use normal channels so we need a way to protect our country. Lock trump up now. Hire Mercenaries to execute the arrest.
Trump.  I had COVID-19.
If we do that kids could go back to school and not be filled with fear. hitler/trump will never agree to protect all American Lives he wants us dead.
The President of the United States of America has this job to protect all American interests and protect all American Citizens. We DO NOT HAVE A PRESIDENT IN AMERICA. WE HAVE A RUSSIAN TRAITOR. REMOVE THE TRAITOR DONNY J TRUMP TODAY. CARRY HIM OUT BY HIS ARMS AND LEGS TO PRISON.

They are not cops.  Trump created his own national Militia group to go after and incite protesters.  By far, this is absolute proof that he is an authoritarian fascist. I dare him to send them to the Chicago south side. They will be slaughtered.
"Trump tells voters in suburbs they will ‘no longer be bothered’ by low-income housing"
Trump's a racist and so are most of his supporters!
Please tell me that's not your description of trump?  Because trump's exactly the opposite!  Look around and see what he's doing to our country, Trumper!
I swear trump wants to send this country back to the era of plantations and slaves!  News for trump...there's a lot of white folks I wouldn't want to live next to!  Like most of the folks that show up to your rallies.
So your Trump Virus kills both people and their jobs, if they live, they lose their homes and insurance (pre-existing conditions), and you have your thugs attack and kidnap them from the street. Sounds like a plan, Mafia Don.
So, the Trump virus throws people out of their minimum wage jobs, then he attacks the homeless, while encouraging his thugs to kidnap off the streets. See where this is headed?
Glad to hear Trump is the candidate Catholics can get behind I guess
It's a shame we have to pay for further protection because we've supported the whole damn trump family for 4 years!  But I do think they automatically get it, unless they refuse it. It's a shame!

Get back to work. trump is killing our country and you people are all sitting back and doing nothing to protect America. Why do we even pay anybody to pretend to be a politician none of you protect our country.
I do not believe America has any laws anymore. They just aren't necessary. Trump says he's above the law. When One is above the law legally we all are above the law. No laws exist now none.
So trump is removing all our troops in Germany. This is on Putins order not for the benefit of America. This move benefits only Russia. Trump is allowing our Allies to be attacked by Russia now. Putin needs to die now. The sooner the better.
We all know trump and his family owns tons of stock in this drug so they are pushing it like heroine cut with fentanyl. Which means it will kill you not help help. Trump and his family are just stuck with they chose to but it and it failed now live with the fuck up by your daddy
You already killed our economy. Now your pushing your loser drug again. Your closing USPS losing 600Million full time jobs you donald j trump are the hoax. You donny to so stupid you couldn't run a kool aid stand property. Your ugly, stupid, criminal and dirt poor.
Trump said out loud he really doesn't care if we all starve to death or lose our homes. He just wants all our money so when the great depression hits is has all of our cash to live one. This is who trump is a con man that needs to steal to get money he can't make any on his own.
Come on Pompeo is nothing but a criminal. He will never turn over doc. to support America he only help trumps trump and barr destroy America.
This should not surprise no person alive. Trump is not American he is Pro Russia all the time. He hates America because the banks would not lend him money and forced to go to Russia to loans. Now we are all paying for the rich playground that make donny boy trump feel poor.

David Perdue is a con man. 4 Ebola cases and Obama was unfit to be president. Trump 150K dead Americans over 4 million cases in America and Perdue is silent. Is this guy related to the Perdue Chicken. If he is we need to to start a boycott of the product. Perdue must go.
She is a fraud. She is so tough if she doesn't have to face the people she is trying to take down but face to face she is a trump coward. Packs of cowards stick together. Her poor father watching all this Trumpian behavior from his daughter has to be hard his spirit.
In other words trump is a coward and can't imagine starting a fight with a man that scares him named weak liddle Putin.
your column today was circular and proved your point.  It doesn’t make an iota of difference what President Trump does, you criticize him!
Barr look like a crazy criminal that should be on a mentally ill watch list. Barr is a Nazis who works only for Putin and occasionally trump.
Joe Biden is running to save America from trumps disastrously illegal running of America. Trump sold America to Putin. Biden is taking it back and Putin is not going to like it. We will silence Putin if he forces us to remove his voice from the earth.
Her notes are valid and they are Barr's answers. Barr was constantly interrupting the participant's questions to use up their time. His answers show he's just as as much of a liar and as crooked as trump.
He is sitting on them because they are useless and trump already bought them lock, stock, and barrel. They do not work they are garbage. hydroxychloroquine will treat the #TrumpVirusCatastrophe That drug is useless in the treatment or cure this is a clusterfuck.
Clusterfuck is the best definition of the trump administration and trumps presidency. #TrumpIsALaughingStock  he is in fact a clusterfuck.
This is the drug trump and his criminal family bought tons of stock in. This drug does not work for covid 19. It never will no matter how much trumps begs, and lies it does not and will not work. Peter Navarro can eat shit and die.
I don't believe trump or any of his family should be protected now. They have proven they are pro Russia so they will get whats coming for them. They all deserve it.

It would tank as fast as trump university!
If people die after taking dr trump's advice, can he be charged as an accessory to murder or something?  This moron is dangerous!
is he recommending Trump University?
That's a double standard if I've ever seen one.  How many Trump supporters don't believe in science, and prefer miracles and believe everything they don't like hearing as "fake news". I've seen enough articles from here and abroad that I'd love to be convinced it's all a hoax.
I want to know how much money Russia has given trump through the Deutsche Bank?  I believe trump is almost broke and Russia is funding him.

This is no surprise that DeVos unfit to run a single school is killing public education. The fact her brother is a Mercenarie hired by trump to kill Americans is also not a surprise. The entire Devos family will no longer exist whenever trump is forced to leave.

Amen 🙏🏼 Thanks be to our Lord and savior, Jesus Christ for working through  President Trump and his people for seeing to it that His children are safe from the demons who sought to harm &amp; kill us all. 🎚
The 4 governors are cloned AND groomed as a 'donald trump' TWINS!! I definitely don't want anyone to think this is any part a compliment - quite the opposite.   Could they be a part of PUTIN's regimen?  Seems as though - CURIOUS?
Because the majority of trump supporters ARE deranged!
Look at these young American hero's that Putin had murdered and trump did nothing to punish these murders. Coward trump must answer his questions and resign his traitor position. Biden will force Putin to answer questions or pay the ultimate price. Go Joe Go make putin pay.
This is months past due. Your late to the dance again. March is when you should have come out and wore a mask and talked to people about wearing a mask but no you listened to killer trump now USA is a laughing stock of the world. You Mitch are a coward and a Putin supporter.Loser
Just stop we all know trump is putins bitch in every sense of the meaning. He will never turn of putin. Putin owns trump, lock, stock and barrel.  If trump turns on Putin he will be executed within hours of the betrayal. That is a fact. Putin kills everything he can't trust.
I agree trump is guilty.
Guess the trump family will try to screw up as much as they can in the little time they have left. You know she'll make a mess of the Rose Garden, unless she steals the design from someone!

My point was that for 140 years presidents adhered to Washington’s edict of only having 2 terms. Until FDR. The left complains about Trump being a fascist dictator, yet excuse FDR for putting Japanese Americans into internment camps. I don’t like the hypocrisy of the left.
So I see people tweeting about “what happens if Trump doesn’t accept the election results and doesn’t step down”. This from the only party who’s had a president who didn’t accept presidential norms and ran for office 4 times.
Planning for early voting. But if there is one thing I would stand in line for that long, it would have to be to send Trump and brown shirt Miller to jail.

If Trump knows the Trump Corona Virus why don’t we have a national plan to combat it? Instead Trump abdicated his responsibility and passed it off to the states.
All Trump did was put Trump first.

Republicans and Trump have to worry that most of its supporters won’t show up on             November /03/20   , because he keep insisting it will be rigged and much fraud in the election ! He wins by taking the GOP down with him ! Keep him saying such lies &amp; it will cost u big!
This needs to be said by all Republicans. Ads needs to play on this theme in all media forums. They need minority conservative groups to unite and be featured in ads. Trump won’t win with a twitter campaign by himself. He’s preaching to the choir.
No mask. No social distancing. No example for Trumpers. Didn’t Trump lose a friend to the Trump Corona Virus today and now he is endangering someone else?
The military will not follow his orders. Just swear Biden in, take the nuke suitcase away and govern at camp David. trump will find that an empty White House will become boring and he’ll eventually move out. The secret service for Biden can remove trump also.
I don't expect any different messages from the Trump haters.
Words. However most of the families that has a tragedy, will be at least 4 votes pulled away from trump
I may be delusional but come November the American people will decide. Would you like to make a wager with me if trump wins or loses?
Trumps administration has had no focus on anything. We just had the worst economic Qtr in history. We have the highest deficit in history. Trump has killed 151,000 from the Trump Corona Virus so far. Trump is by far the worst POTUS in history.
Trump couldn’t have upstaged that eulogy today if he called a press conference to announce he was resigning.
For every death from coronavirus and the people getting screwed on unemployment, the wrath of the American people shall fall onto trump and his republicans... so sayeth me.

Herman Cain thought it was a hoax too. He is dead today from Corona Virus he caught at the last Trump rally. You should go to a rally, catch the virus and die too.

Trump killed Cain at his rally. Cain died of the Trump Coronavirus he got by not wearing a mask and not using social distancing at the Trump rally.
If only Trump spoke nicely too.
If we are at the point where you seriously think that some states may stop electors, Trump has already broken our democracy.
I'm dying for Trump to die does that count? 😂😂😂
Wonder if Trump world will consider Herman Cain a martyr, who sacrificed his life to please his leader?
Trump is so afraid of being embarrassed in the coming election (landslide loss) he is already making up excuses and trying to find a way to cheat the election for himself.
Instead of asking  can we go to rural areas and ask Trump voters, if they like the idea of spending 20-30 dollars to send mail via fedex as opposed to cents with USPS.
Donald Trump never wanted to be President, he just wanted to WIN. Winning is all that mattered to him, not the responsibility of the job. Being a winner is all that is important to him. That is why he is so desperate now. He knows he is losing and that is inconceivable to him.

An 1845 federal law placed the date of the election the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November. The president does not have the authority to change the date; see you at the pollls on November 3rd, Trump.
Herman Cain went to a Trump rally without wearing a mask. His death could have been prevented if he had listened to experts and not had followed blind  propaganda.

I can't speak for everyone here but what I can tell you is that my post is about the official "text 88022" that then candidate Trump constantly mentioned in 2016. See link. Others here have complained about that official number exhibiting that behavior.
Yeah, great idea, KellyAnne, to have Trump do his daily circus shows again!  You're giving Biden TONS of ammo!  :D
Not as long as Trump is leading the right
Trump had a news conference and snarky reporters kept talking and he walked out.
Don't vote for Biden. Don't vote for Trump.  vote for who you want and reject the made up, yet overwhelmingly popular idea of a 2 party system.  but especially make sure you vote for the house and the senate conscientiously, they matter way more than the rapists on the ballot.
us: please stop beating and killing poc with the authorities trump: *sends in more authorities to beat and kill poc*
Surprising no one ...
It’s always about trump.
Did everyone notice Trump running out of the news conference like a complete coward when the questions got a little tough? I thought he was going to break out in tears.
Since when? Trump has done nothing but give it lip service.
I thought Trump said the Trump Virus would go away all by itself. Like magic. Why is it still here?
In order to achieve victory we must have a cohesive national plan. Trump has done nothing but abdicate his responsibility to state governors.
Trump is losing the right. And the left &amp; middle. He is even starting to lose the wack jobs.
Trump will post anything that agrees with him. Even very stupid stuff like alien DNA proponents like the wack job Doc mentioned. What POTUS in history ever said anything without checking to it?
Americans have them too. They are called tv evangelists. They will save you from the devil if you buy them a private jet. The new doctor... she is somewhere in the middle. Trump needs a doctor to move his agenda along and she will use his legion of loyal nitwits to make money.
Your pants are not a bra
The whole point of Jayapal’s questioning is that it’s clear that alt-right protesters and protesters that support Trump’s agenda too often get a pass while ones who speak against him or against oppressors are met with force.
The US never had a "right" to lead the free world.  For a time, it had the *privilege* of leading the free world, a privilege earned by its promotion of ideals and policies that many countries found admirable.  That's obviously no longer the case, and Trump is part of why.
I just realized that trump took over the heavens gate cult and this guy along with the NRC are it’s followers.
trump is making you guys surveilling US citizens as I tweet. I trust Biden over the trump syndicate.
Not sure if his the same trump I really think he got worse with power.
And now we know how Barr fits in with Trump and Epstein.
It makes a difference who he picks. If he values what’s left of this country he will pick a unity candidate as VP to unite the Democratic Party.  A United Party is the only hope we have left. It’s better than a total dictatorship by Trump.

whether or not people are tarred by Trumpism ought to depend on what they do about Trumpism.  When folks oppose Trump it isn't subtle.  One way of reading  's point is that such opposition at least in the GOP is by a wide margin the exception and not the rule.

Arguably the trump administration is the least corrupt administration he’s worked for,
The Iraq war turned me into a Democratic party member, the Great Recession turned me into a progressive, Trump turned me into a social democrat. The Trump virus epidemic is Turing Gen Z into moderate democratic socialists.
Seriously? Another report out today proves this drug is less than worthless for the Trump Corona Virus. Trump just wants to add to the 150,000 death toll he has run up.
Liberal privilege? How about being born into privilege? None of the current Trumps earned a dime. They all inherited it. Even our POTUS nearly lost it all needing to claim bankruptcy 5 times. Trump couldn’t even run a casino without bankrupting it. What a crappy business man.
Reagan Foundation distances itself from Trump campaign and the president isn't pleased

Trump is trying to do that
Trump alone wouldn't have gotten the US into such trouble. He seems really lazy. He'd be happy being the head of state: speeches, rallies, etc. It's the energetic people around him that are the problem: incompetents like Kushner, crackpots like Barr.
Thank Trump for sending Herman Cain “home”.
Yup!  I've always preferred  Mike Pence to run the country ever since Trump got the nomination and *especially* after about 6 months of Trump's presidency.
Sure, Trump will lie in state when it’s his turn. But my guess is that the whole deal will be so sparsely attended it will only take 15 minutes, tops.
“The political folks believed that because it was going to be relegated to Democratic states, that they could blame those governors, and that would be an effective political strategy..."  Again, Trump demonstrates that he sees himself solely as the president of the red states.
For the record.  I will be buried with military honors in a veterans cemetery.  No #trump...living or yet to be born...is welcome at my funeral.  #VeteransAgainstTrump
Trump got what he wanted. He buried the trainwreck economy underneath his BS tweet about delaying the election. Journalists always fall for his shit.
He intends to delay the Election, but he doesn't have that power, Congress does. The real issue is what he is doing to the Postal System...that is a problem. So sick of this man, Covid-19 has nothing on  Donald Trump, who is the biggest sickness in America today!

Not sure this Trump conference should be aired live without fact checking. HE LIES!
Trump puts a shiny object out (election delay tweet) and everyone focuses on that instead of the disastrous economic numbers.
I called Davis' office this morning to complain about Trump's election delay tweet. I'm glad to see Davis quickly speak out against delay. However, his staff is still repeating the line that "mail-in" voting like in CA is insecure.
Donald Trump should resign
This isn’t about my personal opinion. I’m pointing out the insane hypocrisy in Trump preaching “we shouldn’t postpone anything” and then turning around and saying “let’s postpone the one thing that’s in my best interest to postpone.”
Man, what Lincoln Project is doing about Susan Collins is much more valuable (to me) than what they're doing to Trump. More of that please.
So we shouldn’t postpone school because the pandemic is being overblown.   We shouldn’t postpone sports at any level because the pandemic is being overblown.  But we should postpone the election because, in Trump’s own words, “people can’t vote safely during a pandemic”?
And now Trump will have a funeral Where he can go to where he might be Tolerated
Trump killed him
He was as intellectually incurious as Trump.   He didn't know the difference between Shia and Sunni - an important distinction to know if you're going to torpedo an Iraqi government.  His administration was pretty much the exact opposite of his campaign promises.
How dumb do you have to be to think that there not being a football season, out of all things is going to be the last straw for Trump supporters 🧐
Trump wants to delay the election because he thinks he won't win. He's not going to give up, though. We can't either. Register. Check your registration. Put your vote in the ballot box yourself if you can. If you have to vote by mail, do it way early.
How every single Democrat in Congress and every single media outlet with an editorial board isn’t calling for Trump’s resignation or the use of the 25th Amendment to remove him is beyond me.

Yeah I remember that. I also remember thinking that Trump would pull something to delay the election back in March...

Anyway, Republicans should have had the integrity to remove Trump from office in February. They didn't, so it's our duty to vote them out, too.
Trump doesn't run elections. States do.  For Trump to get his wish and "postpone" the election, he needs to either convince Congress to change election law or states to successful disobey the law and ignore court orders.

Utterly bizarre that Trump's call for delaying the election is the top story in most other countries, but somehow not in the USA
That's one small piece of the puzzle. Biden was also articulating a sensible plan for response while Trump was still claiming that it was just going to go away and we didn't need to do anything.
You took an oath to preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States, which makes clear that, without an election, come January 20, there is no President. Want to make sure that we're all on the same page here. No election = no President. Trump can't hold over.

I agree. I believe the press has a duty to push back hard at the assumed legitimacy of this tactic being used by Trump and his campaign surrogates. But they should not stop asking the question. Exposure can be an effective  way to call this out.
sure sounds like you’re just a scared little bitch now. Better head back to that bunker, Bunkerboy. Covid won’t get ya there.
If it wasn't an election year it would be that simple.. But understand, Trump supporters demand satisfaction over their enemy. All of this is just in case he loses. As long as he keeps up denial there's a real chance of civil war here. All he's gotta yell is fraud...
I respectfully disagree. Asking the question exposes the possibility. Prepares &amp; informs the electorate, as a free press should. And besides, when has ‘it isn’t legal’ stopped the Trump admin in the past?
They were never asked because they never brought up the possibility of rejecting the results. Trump has being doing so since the 2016 election.
Money is ALWAYS on Orange Nazi Trump’s menu!
They are showing your Trump Gestapo crew and you don’t like your “secret police “ being exposed
Breaking: Trump throws a hissy fit over the RNC &amp; his low polls.        👇👇👇
And don't get me wrong, im happy someone who may need help with their insulin can get it. But Trump acts like he just changed the whole game up and made it affordable for everyone, which he hasnt.
Oh, oh, I know, I know! It’s the tentacles 🦑 of the Alien inside Trump’s skull!
Everything that you all have said is absolutely true, but it comes down to this when taking Trump out; we must win BIGLY! Landslide his ass straight to Florida...no contesting votes as fraudulent, or a close call, but a BIG BLUE WAVE  making the biggest Landslide in HISTORY!
What do you expect from Mark Fuckerberg? He’s a Nazi &amp; one of Orange Nazi Trump’s best Ass Moisteners! Plus he’s so “WHITE” he looks like a slimey ghost
Ok I received my copy of Mary Trump’s book. About to dig in...
Then Trump wins and that in my opinion is way worse!!! Everyone needs to vote Blue!!
There's always been a conspiracy-minded element of the US (and often for good reason), but I think the Trump presidency has really empowered conspiracy thinking
Dear media, If Ted is setting the bar at Biden having to respond to a social media post from a county board candidate, he needs to answer for every single hateful &amp; sick tweet from Trump

I just listened to Pink Floyd's the Wall almost all the way through and boy that album is just a guidebook to the Trump era isn't it. Seen the movie countless times (midnight showing 8th st Playhouse in the 80s) and always fell asleep during The Trial.
Trump Says Portland Mayor Who Was Tear-Gassed Was 'Pathetic'
"I never received information about what happened with my ideas or results," said Thomas Hladish, whose regular calls with the health department ended June 29. "But I did hear the governor say the models were wrong about everything."I parked my car in trump towers fucking clown😂
just remembered trump said earliy on he would rathe resign than have he taxes made public
Trump’s destruction  of the democracy is scary- the complacency of the Republicans in Congress is just as DEPLORABLE
I’m going to put exactly that in my will. “Obama is invited and can say whatever he feels like. Trump is not invited”. Every american should add that.
what’s the game plan when trump tries to challenge the election results? I truly hope the campaign is scenario planning because you just know he’s gonna try something.
Voters hear and understand this. Contrary to what Trump is saying and lying about:  There is NO difference between Absentee voting and Mail-in voting.  It is the same thing!!!! Pass it on.
I agree. That doesn't mean Trump isn't hoping for it.
Trump turns everything in trash Would you look at this. You cannot make this ish up #TrumpIsALaughingStock #trumpturnseverythingintotrash Straight garbage #ObamaWasBetterAtEverything
Trump is a horse’s ass, I know that but at least he’s not a self righteous narcissist like Obama.
Trump killed him.
The extreme ciurt won dare defy the ppl IF the ppl vote in nasive number the court will be hard press by any legal bs Barr can dream up. JOE BEATS HIM BY 10 MILLION. TRUMP IS DONE.
Postal employees and union officials say recent changes implemented by Postmaster General Louis DeJoy, a major donor to President Trump and the GOP, have led to days-long delays in mail delivery across the country.
I love that you’re upset with Trump but please take time to acknowledge how wrong you were on President Obama countless times. You added to the unnecessary stress caused by journalists looking for attention. Repent.
You mean for government to create more incentive for startups and entrepreneurship.  I don't see argument here, I think there's general concensus among most people that this is what is supposed to be happening.  In fact that is what Trump administration trying to do.
Funny how at the same time the Trump began running ads about cities being overrun by violent left-wing mobs suggests to me that he is motivated by the optics of the response than its potential effectiveness.  Btw the name calling is the new low for the GOP-- thank Trump.
I thought he caught the Coronavirus from Trump’s own droplets

There are both areas where I agree and disagree with  colleague Prof. Steven Calabresi. Here, we agree. I'm unsurprised and pleased to see him reiterate so clearly that these are not rules to be disregarded, bent, or broken.

I agree Jan  He says outragious stuff Everyday . But the Question and misanswer time with the  Babbling idiocy at the end is positively Astounding. I didnt get to see the end  As the wife made dinner And have to sit at the K table She wont watch Trump  When She eats. 😂😂😂😂😂
why? Are we rewarding ignorance now?  He went to a rally #maskless, he was over 70 &amp; had underlying illnesses.    Are we rewarding him for being brave enough to die so  Trump could stick it to Science?  If so that didn't work so  remind me why we're rewarding him?
When one of the co-founders of the #FederalistSociety calls Trump a fascist, you know you're in uncharted territory.
Yeah. A lot of people fell for Trump's con
Trump Might Try to Postpone the Election. That’s Unconstitutional.
Is it though Lady G?!?! Sounds like to me we actually have judges who follow the Rule of Law! It's clear you dont because if you did you wouldn't be all the way up Trump's ass! November you will be voted out!
The Great Trump Diseaster #TrumpIsACompleteFailure
People were subject to state mandates, not Trump's advice. Also his administration did advise those things. The media and Twitter libs should be to blame for creating a political divide by screaming at everything he suggests, even if he's right.
Trump specializes in pulling out too soon?
Trump tells so many jokes, according to his enablers

#TrumpPresser :  fact check:  Biden does not want a fracking ban, he want to stop NEW permits.  Trump lied, things are NOT better in Fl.  He said he wants to stop evictions....there is nothing in the GOP bill addressing that.  No evidence of voter fraud.  #TrumpLies
Trump ain’t gonna kill my Obama buzz  #TrumpPresser
I am listening to trump rn. Let me get this straight. Young people won’t die from it so it’s OK if they get it, and a lot of old people have been dying, but they were super old anyway!!! very compelling.
This didn't age well #Trump
George W. Bush, Bill Clinton and Barack Obama were all there but you know who wasn't? That's right, Donald Trump
Is it sad that I love trolling Trump supports on here... #Biden2020
Market red and trump supports more handouts. Go figure.
So who trusts their children with Trump’s opening of schools?
Donald Trump is the world’s worst public reader. And I say reader not speaker because when he reads it’s literally 😴😴😴🥱🥱.
However, Calabresi added, agreeing with Trump on this would not disqualify someone from being a Supreme Court or Court of Appeals justice, and, in fact, only enhance their qualifications.
Obama attacks police brutality and voter suppression in powerful eulogy for John Lewis – video | US news | The Guardian
I don't think they'll vote for Trump. I think they'll refuse to vote at all, which is effectively the same thing.
On top of all the tweets from #45 about how Biden is a puppet of the "Radical Left," I've also been seeing tweets saying this election is "really" Trump vs. Obama, Trump vs. China. I think #45's party has realized they can't win against Biden.
Lets move to Canada if trump gets re-elected
Must be backwards day at EPA! We know the truth, Andy.
Is been a long 3 years of being told what Trump won't do and then watching him do that exact thing.  Excuse my skepticism that 'it's just talk.'
not going to be hard on the "how Trump might quit" piece, it's a classic "I don't have any ideas this week" submission
He stupidly attended a rally in Tulsa w/o a mask.    He and the other "Blacks for Trump" wanted to prove a point and they did.  They proved #COVID19 is real and it can kill.
#KAG2020 are some ignorant people that don't believe in Science, instead they worship Trump.  They won't wear mask they would rather die in support of Trump like Herman Cain.   Trump promotes miracle cures &amp; witch doctors that appeal to the ignorant.     Judgement day 2020
If trump knew how to fix america why in the hell are there 150K dead, record unemployment, bursting debt.    WE could have fixed this with rapid testing, contact tracing and wearing mask.    The only way we save America is to dump the dunce.
trump is not up his shakespeare i bet
Barack Obama had more religion in his arse than trump has in his entire body and yet your hate Obama and love Trump.  That's why i'm denouncing Catholicism, it's just a racist cult filled with birthers.

Stay focused. Don’t get so worked up that we forget what’s important.   - Arrest Breonna Taylor’s killers - Vote out Trump - Defund the police - Eliminate racism - Destroy wack rappers
Is Trump going to get away with Housing Discrimination? Will people allow him to? That is Pure Racism and I hope he can't get away with it.
Why do all the Jews support democrats? Trump has done more for Israel than any other President. Biden is Catholic not a big Jew supporter. Blacks hate Jews, his VP will be black. Wake up Jews vote Trump!
If there is a video of trump with an under age girl it would erase all support for him.
And yet he died for nothing like the 150,000 other people. Please don't wear a mask sir, trump will protect you maybe

Well, how effective was that, really? Lmao! Trump running everything.
The Trump Recession, of course! It is every bit his fault and the  is complicit
Yall ! Why did Trump try to include funding for the FBI headquarters by his hotel in the next stimulus package ? Both the republicans and the Democrats asked him “ What does the fbi headquarters have to do with the Coronavirus ? “🤣 like foo you tryna finesse the government too?
To make President Trump look bad,and blame him to try and ruin the re election.Demorats help spread it through Fauci.
Doesn't this happen all the time? Trump tweets something. The GOP says "You fucking idiots it was CLEARLY a joke and HE GOT YOU." and then Trump is interviewed and he says "it wasn't a joke and I am issuing an executive order that says NO JOKE DO THE THING."
I wasn’t expecting Trump to attend but it was tacky &amp; petty for the White House not to send any representation.  #JohnLewisMemorial
We will vote because the majority of this country sees with clarity that Trump has and is destroying our country. #WeWillVote
they are sitting apart and they all have on masks but you didn't notice that part did you?  The pic you should have posted was this one of #Trump in Texas yesterday.

Still a maybe?With 100s of brains pondering over it for months.. ?And they should add incentives more than the unemployment benefits to the ones who been working in this pandemic and to bring ppl back to work....
Gurl you support Trump. You have already sold your sold your soul.
Learned this during Obama’s second term when I realized he could easily avoid doing the work if he placed blame for the work not being done solely on his opponents. Same playbook Trump is using today and Biden will use if he wins.
Trump is the kid who would reset the Nintendo when he was losing.
Mr. Turley:  Joe Biden did nothing more than predict EXACTLY what is happening.  Trump wants to postpone the election.  Whether he can or not is irrelevant; even proposing it is yet another step towards authoritarianism.  You should apologize.
Trump been on a Dick Flute solo victory lap for 3.5 years
White racist cops for Trump  fixed it.
I'm SUPER looking forward to your tweet apologizing to Joe Biden and condemning Trump for doing EXACTLY the opposite of what you said.  Can't wait.
It might seem counterintuitive but for my sanity I have to assume Trump will win. I can’t be surprised by that again.  Intellectually and objectively it is FAR more likely Biden will.
The CDC recommended wearing masks in March but apparently you were listening to Trump and his minions.
Trump’s has no sympathy for anyone 🤡unbelievable not human
Read this thread and then get the word out. Trump already has plans and people in place to usurp the United States Constitution and kill American democracy forever. #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica #VoteForOurLives #VoteBidenToSaveAmerica #BePrepared
Buried with trump and his followers
The only consistent position the Resistance has is to disagree with whatever Trump says, regardless of context.  Still just wish he'd pull the ultimate move and talk up breathing. I have to wonder how many people that would actually end up killing.
I am pretty ignorant of economics but it seems to me that Trump and his enablers have been all about the short term. Trump wants his definition of a strong economy for the duration of his term. He has never seemed concerned with the long term or for sustained prosperity.
The worst that’s why trump is in White House. What a fuck up has nothing better to do. Don’t we know by now
Thank you,  - fight the Trump fascism at every turn!
Throw in Trump’s “The Art of the Deal”
I read ur entire thread &amp; I would be particularly angry if I were u bc this man died from a preventable disease,the majority of the deaths we have seen were entirely preventable had the trump administration followed the public health plan left to them, and I hope u can see that.
Hard to tell one Cops for Trump event attendee from another--that's one homogeneous audience.
*death tolls in America surpass 150,000*  Americans : Something has to be done !  The Trump administration : Okay we’ll revamp the Rose Garden

The Constitutional Case Against Trump’s Use of the Department of Homeland Security
I forgot jobs. And don't call Trump a traditional conservative. He's gotta play dirty because those were the rules set by his opponents.
Read the article. Look at the research timing.  Look at the numbers. Consider what your post was trying to do. Then, you will understand my response.  At the end of the day, the VAST majority of us CANNOT STAND TRUMP.
Fun presidential line of succession scenario: If Trump delays the Presidential election past Jan 20 and California still holds their elections then  gets to be President.
I’m honestly dumbfounded by the way 35% of the American population is so stupid, yes I said “STUPID”. We call ourself a progressive educated country? But yet 35%? 20,000+ lies. 3+ years of absolutely nothing done by Trump (LEGALY) and 150,000+ Americans murdered still supporting
Think about this for one second: IF Trump DOES manage to delay the election wouldn't it just make it MORE likely that he will get trounced when we're finally able to vote? Could be the best thing to ever happen since the ratification of the 23rd amendment.

Only a Trump Presidency can make you wish Bush was still in office.
Cause of death:  being a Trump Republican in 2020
Like Trump, he wasn’t the right man to be president.  For those who claim they “don’t see color” here’s a chance to put that in practice.  And the “b” in Black is uppercase.  What was he doing maskless + not socially distant in a room full of maskless people at the Tulsa rally?
It’s only kinda funny to see that black trump supporting ass nigga. But he old asl to be this
WATCH: Trump fumes at CNN after being confronted for promoting doctor who believes in ‘demon seed’
Trump is getting his people in line to delay the election. Time to wake up, folks.
Ain’t he get it from the Trump rally? Well....
Who didn’t see this coming?
Donald Trump has very little experience solving problems. He is better at framing what happened in a way that he can move forward
I can only assume but most other people would probably used the pandemic playbook developed by previous administration and the experience of the team of experts put together that Trump dismissed. But again, at this point we can only assume
How many more people like #HermanCain will throw themselves on the #Trump #MAGA #GOPDeathCult funeral pyre?
I am WAITING to see what Trump has to say.
Trump yesterday announced he would be withdrawing 12,000 troops from Germany.   Hmm. Sounds to me like an installment payment to Putin for election interference. #RememberInNovember #TraitorTrump
I can teach you how to google. But in the meantime here is an elaborate description of why your statement is mostly false
If  has a COVID briefing today someone ask him if he feels responsible for the passing of Herman Cain who he attended his Tulsa rally. Trump was still of the belief no one needed masks/ the virus was going to disappear. The only thing disappearing are lives.
His ass shoulda stayed home from that Trump rally
Herman Cain basically sacrificed himself to be one of Trump’s tokens and you know Donald dgaf about him dying.
Donald Trump surrogate  is dead of #COVID19, what a dumb fool.
Good job covid. Do trump next.
From your lips to gods ears. We need a high profile trump to die of covid. I’ll take any of them. Karma cmon.
The left is weaponizing Herman Cain’s death. They’re using the death of a recent cancer survivor with COVID-19 to push people to wear masks &amp; hurt Trump.  It’s quite sad that their hate for Trump is greater than their basic care for humanity.  They’re soulless! They’re pure evil!
Glad he is dead.  He deserved Covid. Hope trump contracts it next.

Trump can't really articulate a smart sentence to save his life &amp; he's not for the subtlety of dog whistles. That's why he'll probably lose, he really bull in a China shop-ed his way into power but doesn't have the creativity to anything with the rubble. He has blackmail, I guess

Trump doesn’t even have to do anything obvious to delay the election this right here is a hell of a tactic. Oh you’re voting by mail? Bye bye usps
Great  Whatever Trump wants the Demnuts are against! Using "Brear Rabbit" against the Demnuts works!
4 states have done this for a long time. It works very well for them. Most states allow mail-in voting with no excuse. It has worked well for them. Trump is afraid he will lose the election and suddenly it's an issue?
The Trump campaign is actually promoting mail-in voting
Trump : it’s too dangerous for the American people to vote   Also Trump: we have to send teachers and kids to school in the middle of a pandemic
So it’s now confirmed Trump is sending in federal goons to stamp out protesters and dissent, not “crime”. He told Gov. of Oregon he would pull the goons out of Portland only when they “clamp down on the protesters”. #GestapoTrump
Herman Cain, former GOP presidential candidate, dies after battle with coronavirus Kane was supporting Trump's wishes of not wearing a mask and going to these rallies with no social distance between a 10 days. Because of trump he is dead
Trump IS STILL going to fundraising events while not social distancing and his fans still doing the same. Unless Trumpsters are living in a bubble, they know how many in this country are ill and have died from Covid-19. Why are these people risking their lives?
Person. Women. Man. Fuck. Trump.  #wewillvote
There have been many.

About catching it at a Trump rally
GOP Rep Louie Gohmert from Texas, a mask averter, finally wore one but just tested positive before jumping on a plane with Trump. He informed his staff of his diagnosis while NOT wearing a mask &amp; then blamed his mask for having germs. Anyone wonder why the US in tops in Covis-19?
I told yall trump was gonna hold the united States hostage
THE BEST THING YOU CAN DO NOW TRUMP IS TO FABRICATE A COMFY STORY AND RESIGN USING YOUR STORY AS THE BACKDROP! YOU GRACEFULLY (?) BOW OUT &amp; GO AWAY. OR STAY TILL ELECTION AND BE LAUGHED AT &amp; TOTALLY HUMILIATED!!🤣🤣😂
When will Trump comment on this?
🤣😂😭😂🤣 they forgot to add that he got it after attending Trump's Tulsa rally and he bragged about not wearing a mask. Killing yourself to own the libs! You love to see it!
everyone who is like “trump can’t stop the election bc that’s illegal” wtf are you talking about he does whatever he wants and no one stops him who tf is gonna stop him, his military that is throwing citizens into prison for no reasons? his judges?
Trump is radicalizing his supporters to revolt if he loses by conspiracy driven propaganda and he’s telegraphing trying to maintain power in any way he can. He’s long ago proven he should he is no longer fit to serve
do it president Trump. Make it illegal for them to send in votes by mail. these people are all cowards and their atheist number to try to destroy America again like they have.
The thought of risking your life to see Trump do a bit about walking down a ramp for 15 minutes, and it winding up being one of the last things you do in your life is very depressing.
Yes, indeed. I'm not the biggest Biden fan, but I'm voting for a return to some semblance of normalcy, then a new generation can take over in 4 years. I don't think the country can take 4 more years of Trump. It's tiring. And I felt that way before the craziness of 2020.
delay the election then. I just got some stupid democratic piece of paper in the mail saying you can mail in your vote. President Trump I don't accept anything except you being our President for the next four years. we cannot have these atheist back.They will destroy America.
Better Trump then him. At least Cain had principles, as bizarre as they were. And he was a man of God.
Herman Cain is a death directly related to Trump and his selfish desires to hold rallies in a vicious pandemic.
Donald Trump should resign or be removed. Pass it on.
Remember when y’all tried to impeach trump and failed miserably? Lmao!
Sadly Herman Cain, a trump supporter who attended the Tulsa rally without a mask has passed away from Covid-19.  Will Trump feel any guilt that his friend died because HE decided mask wearing and social distancing wasn’t important at his rally, essentially killed his friend?
THE SENATE REPUBLICANS WHO ACQUITTED THE GUILTY TRUMP “MUST BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR VIOLATING THEIR OATHS!” THE REPUBLICANS FORGET THAT WE WOULDN’TBE ON THIS DEEP A MESS IF THEY WOULD’VE CONVICTED TRUMP INSTEAD OF SUCKING HIS ....! TRUMP CORRUPTED REPS &amp; YOUR REPUTATION’S GONE!
Maybe if trump tried to give healthcare to the poor.  Republicans hate helping out the poor
TRUMP &amp; HIS CORRUPT REPUBLICANS MUST STOP BLAMING OTHER COUNTRIES FOR A PANDEMIC THAT AFFECTED THE ENTIRE WORLD, AS AN ATTACK ON HIM &amp; AMERICA. TRUMP IS SAYING “I TAKE NO RESPONSIBILITY AT ALL!” EVERY COUNTRY IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THEIR OWN RIGHT NOW! DO SOMETHING COWARDS!
TRUMP TWEETS HE WANTS TO FUCK W/THE ELECTION BECAUSE SAFETY &amp; MAIL FRAUD. However, it’s *safe* to send kids to school in groups indoors for hours/day &amp; mail-in voting has been successful since the Civil War. So I call BULLSHIT on these fabricated concerns.
Y’all need to stop thinking Trump “can’t do that” we thought he couldn’t win , we thought he couldn’t end DACA , we thought he couldn’t send the feds , we thought he couldn’t put kids in camps and separate them from their parents and he DID do all of those things !

“Trump suggests delay in election which is illegal under the constitution and for which he has no authority”.  I fixed it for you. Change that headline!
Trump loves to say “this is good, I did this” and “this is bad, someone else did this” but never seems to have details as to WHY something is good or bad. Taking prescriptive language at face value from an authority figure is dangerous and misleads entire populations.
*Quelle suprise* in 2016 “initially seemed Mr. Trump was merely seeking an early scapegoat for a possible loss, his language had taken a darker turn.”
He also said 2016 was rigged here
He said 2016 was rigged here
Vote Trump away.  For the good of our country, please vote anyway you can.
Do people assuring us of what Trump can't do remember the con. crisis of Boris Johnson closing the British Parliament so that he could force his version of #Brexit , like yesterday? Their courts struck his move down. Do you believe our SC would do the same in crisis to Trump?
I’d be more comforted by this if the Trump administration wasn’t actively defying the United States Supreme Court’s holding on DACA. The rule of law means nothing to Trump and the GOP.
Trump is suggesting we delay the election. I was hoping we could speed it up!
should at the minimum flag  ‘s false tweet but  really should suspend Trump like they suspended  for spreading lies and false claims.

Donald Trump wants to delay the election. Obviously he has no idea that’d make Nancy Pelosi president.
Talk about a power grab. Did he really suggest we make him “Supreme Leader” indefinitely?  A page straight out of an authoritarian dictator’s playbook. Maybe that’s what he and Putin talked about last week since Mr. Trump was too timid to confront him about the bounties.Weren’t you at a Trump rally with no mask? Then came back to the district?

Four more years for Trump🇺🇸!
Unrelated, but he also said that there is NO NEED to deploy his stormtroopers anywhere outside Portland.  I hope Trump caught that!
And arrest these mayors and governors for failing to protect the people, they are just as bad as the anarchists.  They should be arrested for criminal actions and Mr. Trump make an example soon.  We cannot wait for action any longer before others start to apply the law!!
The police in ONE instance have been arrested, not all. tRumps goons are targeting peaceful protestors too and inciting more violence rather than quelling it. This is another tRump failure.
Hopefully these MORONS will leave when TRUMP wins TRUMP 2020

One man can’t fight the world alone, now the United Nation is starting, I would like to ask all patriots and and Relgious mostly Archbishop Viganò to start a prayer for our President Donald J. Trump on a specific day and time we can all agree on. Please add input.
Stanley Kurtz on Trump's latest 'tremendous accomplishment' and why media largely overlooked it   I listened to Levin’s show last night he was very interesting, suburbia better wake up to what the Democrats are doing, they r killing the American dream
Biden takes aim at Trump over coronavirus in new ad blitz courting seniors   I’m over 65, everything about Biden &amp; the Democratic Party disgusts me. They don’t care about people &amp; especially seniors, dem  run cities &amp; states ignored long term care
You've been at home for what 4 months, walked around China town telling people go out, pushing welfare on people, not condemning the violence. Face it Pelosi you're the problem &amp; your party of misfits. President Trump has done a great job and its time for you to go #PelosiMustGo
The uneducated rather listen to trump. Very sad.
Thank you  for helping to protect Chicago citizens.   and  have failed miserably!
7 days. And I had to call and ask for the result! I can say I do not have the Trump Virus 🦠
Tiffany Cross is fantastic. She made mince meat of black rep Trump supporter. Mr. Bevelle was exposed for the fool he is!
Trump's behavior with the coronavirus pandemic is intentional. He is malevolent. He is a first-degree mass murderer.”
How much, my Twitter family, do you bet, that if, and when the Democrats take over both houses they will not undo anything the Trump admin has done.  We must remember that the same things Republicans want so do the Corp Dems.
TRUMP CAMPAIGN SMEARS AMERICAN PROTESTORS WITH PHOTO FROM UKRAINE.  REALLY!
TRUMP 2020
I choose President Trump #Trump2020LandslideVictory
I think it's disgusting you are using your anti-Trump ism to make a few bucks.  I can't believe I was behind you years ago in IL.
The talking doll controlled by Trump how does it feel to be a stooge
. needs to call a Special Session so that we can elect a new Speaker. We need a  reformer, not corrupt tax raiser  #nevertrumper Durkin HATES  and has opposed him since 2015. Durkin - TOTAL FAILURE!
Are you ( and Trump) aware that he actually took this test in 2018? The clue is that the Dr. who he claims grave him the test last treated him in the Fall of 2018!
When President Trump banned travel from China everyone screamed he was racist. Should he have not done that? What else should he have done?
unless it’s happening to him or someone he cares about - it’s not real, it’s a multipurpose deep state conspiracy to get microchips in our heads because “new world order” &amp; to stop Trump from being re-elected. The Illuminati is probably involved somewhere too.
by far the best interview I've seen of with Mary Trump. Thanks Stephen!
Saw a billboard on ret31 n. Heading towards McHenry, it said"I stand with Trump", let the man do his job. I immediately had the urge to throw all my dogs poop bags at it🐾💩💩🐾i wonder what the IQ of that fool was..I'm figuring 0.
I guess Trump made it popular to them. They should've been did it
The Trump GOP Are Psychopaths with a eugenics program.
Pelosi is all out of BS and WE THE PEOPLE see right through her and THE FAILED DEMOCRATIC PARTY So now the new spin is the Trump Virus How can anyone support her and these Failed Democratics
Donald Trump the ENEMY of the ppl and the puppet of the coporate Elites.
Intensely Masculine will be the name of Trump’s next autobiography
Let's have an understanding. You don't decide whether or not President Trump will send in troops to quash the continuous uprising and relentless murdering going on in Chicago. That is never going to be your decision. Do you damn job and get the police department the tools needed.
Stupid!!!  Really stupid! No wonder Trump says he is doing a good job
Through inactivity, down playing and out right lying he is absolutely responsible for the state of the US. It’s not fake news, a hoax, or going to disappear like a miracle. tRump failure!!!
tRump doesn’t discriminate, he abuses both. 25x accused rapist by women and girls.
And tRump still refuses to apologize to the Central Park 5.
You realize tRump is a 25x accused rapist right? That he’s admitted to being more sexually attracted to his daughter that his wife, right? As a Trumper you don’t hold the moral high ground you sit in the swamp.
Are you describing tRump? Seriously. You have no ground to stand on. tRump is a fool who stumbles and slurs his words as well. Not to mention lies CONSTANTLY.  Good try skippy. Put the Kool Aid down.
Influenza kills 20-50k a year. COVID-19 has killed over 140k in 6 months. FFS this is not political. Countries around the globe did not secretly get together to come up with a way to screw tRump.
So I’m starting over due to unfortunate circumstances.  Trump guy, Cub fan who is rebuilding his following.  I re-followHow do you know that the media is lying and not Trump?  Who made you the one who decides who’s right and wrong?
Weren’t you at a Trump rally with no mask? Then came back to the district?
Just like trump. They deserve each other.
Nunes... Benedict Arnold..... trump same.
Well, it would. If you're dead, you can't catch tRUmp Virus
Trump is Foxifying VOA. Remember the normal people who ran the VOA and quit mid June, only to be replaced by Trumpsters? 6 weeks later...
Fine with me, especially if it throws a wrench in to the Democratic plan to cheat. Adam Schiff already worried saying the election will be held on the third no matter what Trump says.
The military will not follow his orders. Just swear Biden in, take the nuke suitcase away and govern at camp David. trump will find that an empty White House will become boring and he’ll eventually move out. The secret service for Biden can remove trump also.
Words. However most of the families that has a tragedy, will be at least 4 votes pulled away from trump
I may be delusional but come November the American people will decide. Would you like to make a wager with me if trump wins or loses?
For every death from coronavirus and the people getting screwed on unemployment, the wrath of the American people shall fall onto trump and his republicans... so sayeth me.
If anyone thinks his behavior recently is because he is “trying to lose”, then they have not been paying attention the last 3 1/2 years. Trump has not changed
And look how much the Republican Party has changed since Lincoln freed the slaves over a hundred years ago till now where Trump is a raging, fascist, racist moron and the rest of the Republican Party are in lock step.
Boys we found trump on vacation😱😱😱😂😂😂#Trump
Trump rally is killing democrats
Trump only wok because not enough people voted for Clinton. She had poor voter turnout. Trump had average voter turnout. If no one cares enough about Joe as opposed to simply hate for Trump, the same thing will happen IMO.
152,000 deaths on trump's incapable hands gaming pandemic to steal another election. The most inaccurate &amp; fraudulent president in history. Hey, your Putin is ecstatic! You're breaking records all over the place! #TrumpIsTheBiggestMassMurdererInAmericanHistory
It is truly pathetic to watch these Democrats like Nancy Pelosi, Dick Schumer, Adam Schiff, and especially the rest of them attacking Mr. bar in the hearing. These are grown adults that act like children bickering over a candy bar. Every day it’s complaints about Mr. Trump.

It turned into a cult like heavens gate. They will go down with trump without questioning his motives.
My chihuahua Ginger is all that and more. I think she could win against trump
TELL HIS WIFE YOU ARE VERY SORRY YOU KILLED HIM AND THOUSANDS OF OTHER AMERICANS BY TELLING THEM THAT THE VIRUS WASN'T SERIOUS
How nice of you to do that Rally during a pandemic btw
Trump should cancel the election until the Covid virus is gone. We don’t want to jeopardize our safety and our Do WE!!!
Trump floats idea of election delay, a virtual impossibility. This is just the start of his bid to be a dictator.
Only Trump could find that loophole. He is just too much of a genius. Believe me!
Trump is doing an AWESOME job of defining himself in terms favorable to Biden. Please proceed.
I am not an American, but I love and pray for your President sooo much! I love him, because Heaven backs him up! :-) And also he is so bold! God bless the USA and God bless President Trump and team.
Trump be like blah, blah, blah.
Don't Forget ....  The Secret Epstein documents are to be unsealed today.   Trump is distracting us.   He cannot delay an election and if he tries we’ve got President Pelosi.   #covidiotinchief
#TheTwitterPOTUS forgets his latest distraction on mail in voter fraud means we would welcome President Pelosi on January 20th by default.   Because without an election, Trump has absolutely no authority to remain in power unless he does a military coup.  #covidiotinchief
Democrats doing yet people only see Trump.
Maybe Trump's ballot will get stuck under audit for 4 years? 🤞🏾

His cronie is trying to rig the mail so he can mess up and rig the votes. The we can claim that it was really rigged and by the trump admin and republicans.
Yup we’re first alright. In coronavirus deaths and infection. Like trump said MAGA! Our economy will be the first to go also.
I’d love some help. I’ve been on here for months. I probably hate trump as much as you.
Sure  is a racist piece of shit. With 150,000 deaths on trump's incapable hands gaming pandemic for personal &amp; political gain, add #TrumpIsTheBiggestMassMurdererInAmericanHistory #25thAmendmentBeforeWeAllDie #VoteBlueToEndThisNightmare #WeStillShootTraitorsDontWe
MJF doing his Donald Trump 🤣🤣🤣 #AEWDynamite
My guess is Trump was told he wasn’t welcome but again just my guess 🤷🏼‍♂️
trump hates our country and most of the people in it.
Because they have one priority, outlawing a woman’s right to choose and Trump bows to their wishes.
Trump refused to pay them. I mean, I can understand if it was because they’re awful. But, it was likely it’s because the morals of an anthill.
I hope she runs for President. If I was advising Trump I would tell him to dump Pence and go with either Haley or Noem.
Now you’re creeping on my new picture of me and my disceased mom from 2016? Are you really fucking that sick or do you get off from creeping on people? I know you are mentally ill being a Trump supporter and having those Biden videos, but creeping on me is really sick.
And I may be trash to you, but at least I don’t support, defend, and vote for trash. You can say all you want about what Biden might of done, but he cares about America unlike Trump who you support and that’s what makes you even worse than trash in this world. 97 days...
Millions of Americans are sufffering from the virus, from a plunging economy that is threatening people's jobs and homes and a huge racial unrest crisis.  And this is what Trump is focused on?  He's definitely the president from hell.
You are projecting yourself on to me by calling me a pussy. She lives in Illinois and is a Bears fan. I don’t know and I don’t care where you live. But you want to call names and send memes and you call me a child? Yeah, typical Trump apologist. Lame. 97 days to $1200 for me...
Dear Santa, All I want for Christmas is for Trump to lose the election. I promise to be good.
...a first grader doesn’t know how to social distance and many school teachers are over the age of 50 putting them at serious risk. Trump doesn’t care about Americans. He cares about re-election only and that’s pathetic. 97 days until Biden is president elect.
Stinky, the left isn’t rooting for the destruction of the country. Trump is the one doing the destruction and mishandling the Coronavirus situation in all areas, especially telling people their kids should be in schools. You are ignorant if you think that will work...
Thank you so much Maggie-Mae for posting this video.  It is refreshing to find out that there are former Trump voters who have come to their senses
So now we are finding out that Trump says he did not raise reports of Russian bounties during the call with Putin.  The obvious question is, why the fuck not? And we're supposed to believe that Donny is not a Russian asset? Get real.

So that’s why trump is trying to build a wall! Maybe he has alien DNA and doesn’t want anyone to know.
Because Trump only hires the very best idiots out there.  If he discovers that they are not idiots, he fires them.
Oh well. He’s following Heavens Gate prophet trump.
Big mistake trump real big!!!!
He might be confused with the $7 boyscout fee he once paid for his son using Trump Foundation funds.
Remember when you continually stated moving the embassy in Isreal was the worst thing Trump could do?  Or when you said there's no need for anyone to have a firearm with more than 5 rounds in the magazine?  Your wrong again Savage.
CNN is a joke. They still think the protestors in Portland are peaceful. They completely ignore the videos showing anarchists/domestic terrorists attacking our federal agents and courthouse. Trump is 100% correct that CNN provides fake news. Trash tabloid network. Fire Zucker!!!
Folks are here due to the perception of free speech, whether they like Trump or not.. if this continues the perception will leave, and so will the people. They're slicing their own throat here on Tweeter.   #Hydroxychloroquine Works.
What does Putin have on Trump?
Time for Trump to consult with Dr. Terry Dubrow.
Excellent  piece by a long-time GOP insider on how the party lost its way - and its soul - with the tacit understanding they could simply ignore calls for inclusiveness once  was elected:
Yet another temper tantrum by the orange clown. Trump might as well have said "He gets a piece of cake. Why don't I get a piece of cake? I love cake." Such a large, dangerous child.
Have a great day! I need to go and fight Trump ,  and
It’s true with trump. You say something, he’ll try and ruin you.
How’s you’re heavens gate cult doing trump?
Yeah yeah yeah.... same stuff different day. Lock trump up!

Trump’s New COVID Doctor Says Sex with Demons Makes You Sick
She’s so subtle and unemotional, and that trips up Trump. But he recovered by bailing out on the next question. If he still knows how to dodge shit, he’s senile. His priorities are wrong, but he’s not senile.
I don’t have any idea what you people are talking about President Trump took action from the minute the virus was detected in the U.S You people are just regurgitating the Democrat’s talking points
Please allow me to introduce myself. I’m a man of wealth and taste.   Unlike Trump.
They don't understand the mentality of the average Trump supporter. It's completely beyond their grasp. Honor and loyalty completely eludes the left.
It’s always about trump.
Americans have them too. They are called tv evangelists. They will save you from the devil if you buy them a private jet. The new doctor... she is somewhere in the middle. Trump needs a doctor to move his agenda along and she will use his legion of loyal nitwits to make money.
Why didn't you ask why Trump has not invoked the DPA to increase COVID19 testing, with necessary supplies? Call him on his lies about amount of testing, which is totally inadequate!!!!
Surprised that Trump throws and catches that ball pretty darn well. Let's focus on wearing a mask, keep 6 ft apart and leave the medical advices to the doctors.
I just realized that trump took over the heavens gate cult and this guy along with the NRC are it’s followers.
trump is making you guys surveilling US citizens as I tweet. I trust Biden over the trump syndicate.
Four more years for Trump🇺🇸!
And Trump is still bragging about acing a 1-page dementia screening test that any normal 10 year old would pass with flying colors.
It should NOT be illegal for Twitch to trend words or hashtags that Trump doesn't like. #TrumpleThinSkin
Unrelated, but he also said that there is NO NEED to deploy his stormtroopers anywhere outside Portland.  I hope Trump caught that!
I’m not rooting for the destruction of the country. Can you read a sentence that I typed? Probably not. Anyway, nothing Trump touches does any good. One thing was to lower insulin prices which was last week and only took four year to do. He did it for political reasons...
And where are people going to find jobs right now? 40 million people are out of work with little or no hope of going back. People may go homeless. You’re not only dumb, you’re heartless. No wonder you like Trump. You terror of a human being.
...an we have had better economies in history. Look it up or do I need to provide it for you? And the so called economy Trump got was inherited from Obama who knows the stock market isn’t the economy. Like everything else, Trump inherits things from others. Lame. 98 days.
How was economy good before Corona. Explain that please. The stock market isn’t the economy so right there you are wrong. More people than ever were working two or three jobs so the economy isn’t that good. That’s another Trump myth...
The only but I can think of is trump.
We’re gonna have to since the trump depression began.
You left out the important part,  you  caused the virus to grow out of control making Trump responsible for those deaths and then abandoned us when the economy and your budget took a hit
Then why can’t Trump? If you can make time for golfing with has been football players, He could join the rest of the nation grieving. Even Mitch was there, and he’s at least as big a hypocrite!
Which new ways has the trump administration kept nursing homes safe?  They’ve locked the doors.
Freedom - Trump
I know you don't read, but your idiot is a grifter &amp; your party a failure.
Trump wins again!  Snowflakes will melt, I’ll have beers and popcorn.
The police in ONE instance have been arrested, not all. tRumps goons are targeting peaceful protestors too and inciting more violence rather than quelling it. This is another tRump failure.
Hopefully these MORONS will leave when TRUMP wins TRUMP 2020

Didn't Parkland during the Trump admin?
Protecting her donors, the Private Healthcare System. Nancy Pelosi is planning to pass an EXPANDED DHS budget with Republican votes.  That's what she's been working on while publicly pretending to oppose Trump's abuses in Portland.
Trump has it rigged
Our political opinions aside, fuck you if you support trump.
John Lewis’ was in state today. You didn’t go. And you didn’t even tweet condolences for a man who got the crap beat out of him because he was black, and fought the injustice until his death. What did you today? “Words on Twitter are mean to me.”
After 4 years of  that may take some time. But Trump losing would definitely Make America Great Again!  #Trump2020 #TrumpIsACompleteFailure #TrumpVirus

So this is what Trump was referring to with person, woman, man, camera, tv.

Economy already falling apart due to coronavirus and inaction by trump. Anyone can sign papers but actions after that is more important.
I’m probably bigger than you. And little is your line of thinking. You are a Trump supporter who doesn’t look into his indiscretions and only look at one side. You are a partisan hack who doesn’t pursue the truth and will be paying me $1200 in 100 days. It’s funny miss this fact.

And you call me the child with you petty memes lmao. You’re an idiot who doesn’t see reality. But you won’t pay up when I win. And believe me, I will win. Things are getting worse every day for Trump and sadly, the country.
More evidence of media bias. If Trump was being hurt they would be digging.

John Lewis believed, “If you see something wrong, say something.”  Donald Trump believes, “If you see something wrong, Tweet something wrong”
Don't commit to any party, make them EARN your vote. Having said that, vote Biden. He's the second shittiest candidate in the history of politics, but we are facing literal destruction of America with a second Trump term.
tRUmp should pay for this
Trump's wishing Ghislaine Maxwell well is classic mafia speak for, I know you have the goods on me, so you better not squeal.  Trump has been intimately connected to the mob since his early 20s when he got into Manhattan real estate and Roy Cohn was his lawyer.

No it’s not. Because it’s all a made up lie by Trump. If you believe it without any evidence you are watching too much Fox News and even they aren’t talking about it too much.
About Trump or about a moderate foreign policy?
Which world leader do you most resemble. President Trump is unique, his main concern, the well-being of the American people. That in itself makes him one of a kind. The lawlessness and social disorder of antifa and black lives matter will be short-lived.#KAG
I think we need a proper balance between the isolationism and the awful neoconservativism and Reagan did achieve that. Trump’s nationalism makes a good but imperfect attempt at striking the balance as well. Still, as long as we maintain a baseline of military strength to maintain
Favorite presidents off the top of my head.🤔Washington, Jefferson, Lincoln, Madison, Reagan, Monroe, Coolidge, Eisenhower, Trump, and I believe I remember Hayes and Grant being good. LOL.
They’ll say they CAN’T, because, after all, it’s Donald Trump. But each party in the past few elections has started the same rumor about the other, incumbent or not.
So you think there is only one person in the world more incompetent than trump yet you’d still vote for him. Let me get this straight, you are voting for the second most incompetent man in the world. Are you proud of that.
This is a Portland mom. She wasn't rioting. She wasn't damaging property. She was asserting her First Amendment right of free assembly. She was gassed. She was assaulted. She was kidnapped. Here we have Trump's Goon trampling the Constitution while we watch. Cruz approves.
Jeez Carlson is a nut job. His criticism of our mayor (which isn’t accurate) can be applied to Trump (which would be accurate).
I understand. I really do. But as long as liberals continue to eat their own. Trump gets an easy road to re-election.

This is what is so disturbing about our country. How much will defeating Trump and enabler do to make this less frequent. So days I have a "hope" deficit.
How much, my Twitter family, do you bet, that if, and when the Democrats take over both houses they will not undo anything the Trump admin has done.  We must remember that the same things Republicans want so do the Corp Dems.
TRUMP CAMPAIGN SMEARS AMERICAN PROTESTORS WITH PHOTO FROM UKRAINE.  REALLY!
TRUMP 2020
I think it's disgusting you are using your anti-Trump ism to make a few bucks.  I can't believe I was behind you years ago in IL.
Democrats are ruining it let trump ido his job
I'm shocked to see you supporting Trump after he disparaged your wife and correctly labelled you Lying Cruz.
How many more ads will #Facebook let Donald Trump run that are filled with false and vote-suppressing content? We can't wait to find out. Federal oversight bodies need to investigate — and act.
Happy fabulous Friday morning.Aligment trump everything . Alignment to source is most wonderful good feeling thing in entire world . One who align with source is millions time powerful than who aren’t .Have fab Friday
This is a Portland mom. She wasn't rioting. She wasn't damaging property. She was asserting her First Amendment right of free assembly. Here we have Trump's Goon trampling the Constitution while we watch.
Name one racist thing Trump has done.
So Jesus endorses Trump? Really?
Remember this is the same mayor that thought it was a good idea to set up a curfew half hour before it came into effect and then kettle the protesters in the beginning of the George Floyd protests.
Wait, what?  Trump doesn't know how real people live?
Another Trump hater. Might as well join the anarchists and democrats working to overthrow our country.
Does Donald Trump work?  He is a celebrity... and he's Prosecuting pedophilia as it's never been done before.
May we see the hand of God on the day of election!  Trump is the man for our country!!

Yes it is shameful. Trump needs us to come out in droves because the democrats will cheat any and every way possible. They will try and steal the election. I pray God steps in and says not so fast.
Exactly what facts did you use to decide Clinton wasn’t competent?  The ones Trump and Russia told you about?Seriously, there was literally no one more competent!  She trained her entire life for that position and Russia stole it from her.
PUtin the RUssian, bought tRUmp what a great deal for #NotDemocracy
He isn’t gonna do it. Deep down they are extremely scared. They know Trump keeps going downhill.
Towering Inferno: Trump Edition
Your news story is about one lab that botched tests. Most hospitals have bought the equipment to do their own covid tests in house now. Trump wants to falsify reports because he's a failure as a man, leader, and human being.
“I also spent a lot of time talking to Melania Trump about the locations of all our intercontinental ballistic missile fields. She was more inquisitive and smarter than the president.” This was 2 years ago. It would suck if Melania is a spy.
Find it really weird that Trump memorized the name of my Podcast.   "Person. Woman. Man. Camera. TV."
We had the longest bull run in the HISTORY of capitalism, yet somehow Trump managed to fuck it up, what else could be expected from someone who bankrupted a casino. And every major city is Democrat. Sorry there's not much crime in Bumblefuck, Mississippi
tRump says has “to protect the American people”. Great! When does he start?
Go kiss tRump’s a$$
BREAKING NEWS: Pres. Trump has cancelled the Republican National Convention in Jacksonville. (s/
Like Melania stated when kids were being kidnapped.... trump feels the same.........Like I Care!   Shame on trump and Republicans. NO COMPASSION FOR PEOPLE!
Need to get rid of trump and his gang,
Yup we are scoring number one in the pandemic thanks to trump
Yup you here that trump?!?! Failed presidency if that’s what you want to call it.
Coronavirus updates: Trump says COVID-19 testing 'is overrated'   Meanwhile, he himself is getting tested several times a day, and many of us cannot even get tested once. Trump is a lying bastard, plain and simple!
Sad to hear that our PM decided to go out of his way to avoid having to meet with normal members of the public whilst in Moray today.   Every day he grows more and more like Trump.
Again, the lying cheating fake news. This should read "Democrats stirring fear Trump will not leave office." They talk about it daily from one useful idiot to the next.
Is there anyone in all of America that believes Federal support personnel are being sent to Chicago to terrorize residents? It sounds ridiculous when said out loud. Please respond if you truly believe that terrorism is Trump' s agenda. Idiots. Have you been to South Chicago?
Evidently Trump is to blame for all the other countries in the world that are unable to do these things either. Especially the ones that caught the virus before the US did, because you’re the Lincoln Project.
trump promised that we would get sick of winning so much. I’m sick just watching everything fall apart and the US acting like a third world country. I’m sick of losing so much.
Yes!!! TRUMP 2020🇺🇸👍🏻❤️
don’t care 🤷🏻‍♂️......TRUMP 2020 🇺🇸❤️💪🏻

💙💙💙 I don’t even like Joe Biden’s policies. He is way too conservative for a center/left voter but we really need to get rid of Trump and his ilk. Still wish Bernie would have won
True but if we are too have an America, then we need to keep President Trump in the White House .
If anyone was watching #KayBurley there is an argument on  And Scottie who is a crooked GOP Supporter who supports Trump, I bet watches Fox News which as a Democrat myself that is Fake News which means POTUS is fake news, DING DONG!!! GN  go to sleep!!!!!!
by far the best interview I've seen of with Mary Trump. Thanks Stephen!
This Trump's current America you idiot, vote him for a second term and this is the America that stays until the American people get sick of it and fight back
If Trump had said this, it would have been over for Trump.
Can you imagine if Trump had said something like this?
Get your SA storm troopers out of my state of IL Trump
I listened to NPR radio. They had a guest that didn’t quite say what they wanted him to because he said it’s basically all hearsay. And even if Trump did say it, who gives a rats ass!
Trump announces he's sending federal agents to Chicago
Homeland Security is looking mor like the SS everyday under the Trump administration. It is scary.How do you know that the media is lying and not Trump?  Who made you the one who decides who’s right and wrong?
Part of me feels like the bar dropped so far that we’re going to always hold the president in lesser regard because he/she isn’t Trump.
Just like trump. They deserve each other.
Nunes... Benedict Arnold..... trump same.
Republicans and Trump have to worry that most of its supporters won’t show up on             November /03/20   , because he keep insisting it will be rigged and much fraud in the election ! He wins by taking the GOP down with him ! Keep him saying such lies &amp; it will cost u big!
The military will not follow his orders. Just swear Biden in, take the nuke suitcase away and govern at camp David. trump will find that an empty White House will become boring and he’ll eventually move out. The secret service for Biden can remove trump also.
Words. However most of the families that has a tragedy, will be at least 4 votes pulled away from trump
I may be delusional but come November the American people will decide. Would you like to make a wager with me if trump wins or loses?
Trump couldn’t have upstaged that eulogy today if he called a press conference to announce he was resigning.
For every death from coronavirus and the people getting screwed on unemployment, the wrath of the American people shall fall onto trump and his republicans... so sayeth me.
And look how much the Republican Party has changed since Lincoln freed the slaves over a hundred years ago till now where Trump is a raging, fascist, racist moron and the rest of the Republican Party are in lock step.

It turned into a cult like heavens gate. They will go down with trump without questioning his motives.
My chihuahua Ginger is all that and more. I think she could win against trump
An 1845 federal law placed the date of the election the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November. The president does not have the authority to change the date; see you at the pollls on November 3rd, Trump.
Every single day hundreds of Americans are dying of something that should have been contained months ago.  The blood is on Trump’s hands and he doesn’t care, anything to get re-elected.
and no, by absolutely no means am I simping for the Trump/Pence ticket

Yup we’re first alright. In coronavirus deaths and infection. Like trump said MAGA! Our economy will be the first to go also.
I’d love some help. I’ve been on here for months. I probably hate trump as much as you.

My guess is Trump was told he wasn’t welcome but again just my guess 🤷🏼‍♂️
trump hates our country and most of the people in it.
I hope she runs for President. If I was advising Trump I would tell him to dump Pence and go with either Haley or Noem.
Dear Santa, All I want for Christmas is for Trump to lose the election. I promise to be good.

So that’s why trump is trying to build a wall! Maybe he has alien DNA and doesn’t want anyone to know.
Because Trump only hires the very best idiots out there.  If he discovers that they are not idiots, he fires them.
Oh well. He’s following Heavens Gate prophet trump.
Big mistake trump real big!!!!
(Collins declines to back Trump’s re-election)  (Collins condemns Trump’s reversal on transgender healthcare protections)  (Collins says Trump shouldn’t have commuted Roger Stone’s sentence)
CNN is a joke. They still think the protestors in Portland are peaceful. They completely ignore the videos showing anarchists/domestic terrorists attacking our federal agents and courthouse. Trump is 100% correct that CNN provides fake news. Trash tabloid network. Fire Zucker!!!
Excellent  piece by a long-time GOP insider on how the party lost its way - and its soul - with the tacit understanding they could simply ignore calls for inclusiveness once  was elected:
Have a great day! I need to go and fight Trump ,  and
It’s true with trump. You say something, he’ll try and ruin you.
How’s you’re heavens gate cult doing trump?
Yeah yeah yeah.... same stuff different day. Lock trump up!

And you #KremlinKevin has been transformed into Trump Lap Dog.
I don’t have any idea what you people are talking about President Trump took action from the minute the virus was detected in the U.S You people are just regurgitating the Democrat’s talking points
It’s always about trump.
Americans have them too. They are called tv evangelists. They will save you from the devil if you buy them a private jet. The new doctor... she is somewhere in the middle. Trump needs a doctor to move his agenda along and she will use his legion of loyal nitwits to make money.
The whole point of Jayapal’s questioning is that it’s clear that alt-right protesters and protesters that support Trump’s agenda too often get a pass while ones who speak against him or against oppressors are met with force.
This is why Trump didn’t want an accountability or oversight
I just realized that trump took over the heavens gate cult and this guy along with the NRC are it’s followers.
trump is making you guys surveilling US citizens as I tweet. I trust Biden over the trump syndicate.
Four more years for Trump🇺🇸!
I'm really gonna just say that that's a real big leap to connect that kind of thing to Trump. People are disgusting and have been disgusting before Trump showed up, saying they're doing so "on behalf of Trump" is weird.

So you think there is only one person in the world more incompetent than trump yet you’d still vote for him. Let me get this straight, you are voting for the second most incompetent man in the world. Are you proud of that.
Trump probably mains Jiggs
I understand. I really do. But as long as liberals continue to eat their own. Trump gets an easy road to re-election.
A plan is okay... to implement it is more difficult but better. trump doesn’t have the mental capacity to do the latter.

I mean, she apologized for it and how she used the DNA test once she was told by the Cherokee people that a DNA test is not an acceptable way to prove anything  That doesn't excuse Trump or anyone else using Native American hero &amp; victim to the English Pocahontas's name as a slur
That's the *given intent* and the intent from Lightfoot which I believe and I believe the only reason she gave any go-ahead for the agents. But Trump or the agents won't hold up their side of the bargain, bad things are gonna happen.

Honestly it’s easier just to block, he does it with both Trump and Biden and somehow always winds up on top of the comments
They're like Ken and barbie they don't have real parts and trump is stamped on the bottom of their plastic feet.

I’d like to think that because of what he and his administration did to President Trump
I ❤️President Trump! He knows how to upset the Dems.. especially when it comes to his re-election!😂🤣
Trump is scared of getting voted out. He knows he fucked up the country's Covid response and is doing everything in his power to cover up his failure.
Quite a coincidence. Obama compares Trump to George Wallace at a funeral today and the NYT just HAPPENS to have a long article along the same lines with quotes from Wallace’s daughter. Like magic!
Donald Trump should resign. Pass it on.
Now might be a good time to remind the other half of America that we felt the same way about Barack Obama that you feel about Donald Trump. We just were grown ups about it.
The GOP Trump Depression
LMFAO they asked for federal assistance from Trump as well as protection from these exact circumstances. While you sat on Twitter criticizing them because you don’t want it to be clear that you’re incompetent at your job.
Will anyone notice now that Trump has consumed all the air with his insane tweet ? It’s another shiny object.
Fox's Chris Stirewalt: Trump Election Delay Shows Weakness
A number of congressional Republicans openly reject Trump's suggestion that November's presidential election should be delayed, a move that the President would have no authority to make
But it didn't. Trump did. Racist Trump. We'll wait while you let that sink in.
Listen to her. Just getting rid of Trump is NOT ENOUGH! It's time to hold the  accountable for their inaction as well as Republicans. Black people are tired of empty promises and bad policies from EVERYBODY. Listen to this if you REALLY care about Black lives.
You are right. The real surprise is that the whole Trump administration hasn't caught it.
This did not have to happen. He made the ultimate sacrifice--to Trump.
Donald Trump will probably be the last president of the united states
There are differences between "Trump can't legally", "Trump doesn't have the power" and "Trump literally has no avenue to make this happen". Delaying the vote falls into the latter category.
Donald Trump wanting to delay the election rather than have a vote by mail election just shows that he's scared of losing and is a corrupt mother fucker. America is much better off without him in office and that's a fact...
you don’t  know trump his mess with the democrats heads 62% of people polled say they  afraid to  voice their political opinions . Those are all Trump supporters .
As in the 2016 election, if Trump actually wins this one, I believe you are correct Wesley, it will just fade away.  Joe Biden et Al willtl fade away from public view and punishment.
Trump looks incompetent all on his own.
Trump doesn’t even care.
You can't make deals with dictators. Pay attention to how Putin smirks at Trump when they're together.
President Trump, who has no authority to set the date for voting, tweets an explicit suggestion to delay November's election
Yes he thinks.   Realize that Trump doesn't give a damn about our children.   He only cares about what he wants to do.
You're right Rick! People think Trump won't leave the White House if he loses, this will have him running and tripping over people to get out.  He's such a coward he might sneak out in the night.  Watch out Trump family because he'll leave you behind!
Trump is the "greatest embarrassment" to the United States EVER!
Plus why would Trump think there's  a danger in voting when he refuses to believe the pandemic. Trump is destroying America and it is intentional. There is no doubt Trump hates America and our democracy.
While I wish we could delay a second Trump term or a Biden first term, indefinitely, this trick doesn’t usually enhance democracy elsewhere.
Lots of the think tank’s $100M annual budget comes from anti-Trump interests
Likely someone who cares about pleasing Trump. but not protecting other people spread the virus to someone who cares about pleasing Trump but not protecting other people. Keep the chain going. Woo woo!
A mask can give the wearer some degree of protection, especially the professional type vs. a scarf. So, someone who cared more about pleasing Trump than protecting other people likely gave it to someone who does the same. :)
Well since Trump cancelled the RNC they need riots to come back since they can't complain about COVID in Florida.
Trump and wit are not synonymous, I think he’s a Traitor to our nation . And bye the way, Trump did not give us Veterans Choice, I was using it under President Obama .
Floridians are for “Trump”
Hey if the Dems have to put the Trump's choice through the ringer while Biden takes over then I'm good with that. Majority will win out but put his pick through it hard. Trump made it that way so it shall be this time. Don't make it easy.
If Trump has any thoughts of appointing another SCOTUS from seeing RBG's recent health issues I have two words for him....Merrick Garland.
If you tweeted something positive about Trump no one would see it but this we can!

Trump sent his condolences.. what more is expected? He should go to only have democrats disrespect him for attending?
I didn’t wish it on him but I’m not sorry to hear it, and if I hear that Trump has Covid-45 I’m going to party! These people have caused unnecessary death by denying science, now let them live with their lack concern for our national health. Maybe Louie’s donors can save him.

Trump administration to send federal agents to Cleveland, Detroit and Milwaukee
There is no middle ground in the media. Poison from both sides. This is a perfect example.  Take care of yourself. Take care of your family and friends. Be empathic to all.
That’s one reason why so many schools will be online until November. The weeks before the election will be a disaster; that, on top of what will certainly be the Dems ratcheting up the country’s temperature to oust Trump. Can’t trust adults to protect our kids—maybe home is best.

Pundits put too much stock in what might happen today and in the analysis of news readers on TV. There is no reason to worry, as usual we the people will teach Trump and his lawless administration what democracy looks like and thankfully you and others like you will record it.
LOL Nadler mad Jordan played that video, which should be turned into a Trump/GOP campaign ad.
Jim Jordan now fumigating the hearing room with truth. They’re after Barr bc he confirmed Obama DOJ spied on Team Trump.
I noticed the same thing, always saying he’s being attacked by conservs, it wasn’t until he started speaking out against Trump that I did start seeing ppl saying wth? I got tired of his constant whining &amp; complaining &amp; he noticed, bc several of us were saying same, he blocked me
Please tell me you did not believe him in the first place🤣🤣🤣🤣there is no level to the lies trump will tell to make himself look good.
I agree most normies are watching the riots and know what is going on they also realize the BLM / AWFLs will torch their houses if they show support for Trump.
I (and several others) spoke out against his constant flip flopping and whining and speaking out against President Trump on his page about 2 months ago, he ended up blocking me..
A lot of people are afraid of admitting to being Trump voters because they don't want their home torched by BLM.

“The political folks believed that because it was going to be relegated to Democratic states, that they could blame those governors, and that would be an effective political strategy..."  Again, Trump demonstrates that he sees himself solely as the president of the red states.

Donald Trump should resign
This isn’t about my personal opinion. I’m pointing out the insane hypocrisy in Trump preaching “we shouldn’t postpone anything” and then turning around and saying “let’s postpone the one thing that’s in my best interest to postpone.”
Man, what Lincoln Project is doing about Susan Collins is much more valuable (to me) than what they're doing to Trump. More of that please.
So we shouldn’t postpone school because the pandemic is being overblown.   We shouldn’t postpone sports at any level because the pandemic is being overblown.  But we should postpone the election because, in Trump’s own words, “people can’t vote safely during a pandemic”?
And now Trump will have a funeral Where he can go to where he might be Tolerated
Trump killed him
He was as intellectually incurious as Trump.   He didn't know the difference between Shia and Sunni - an important distinction to know if you're going to torpedo an Iraqi government.  His administration was pretty much the exact opposite of his campaign promises.
How dumb do you have to be to think that there not being a football season, out of all things is going to be the last straw for Trump supporters 🧐
Trump wants to delay the election because he thinks he won't win. He's not going to give up, though. We can't either. Register. Check your registration. Put your vote in the ballot box yourself if you can. If you have to vote by mail, do it way early.
How every single Democrat in Congress and every single media outlet with an editorial board isn’t calling for Trump’s resignation or the use of the 25th Amendment to remove him is beyond me.

Utterly bizarre that Trump's call for delaying the election is the top story in most other countries, but somehow not in the USA
That's one small piece of the puzzle. Biden was also articulating a sensible plan for response while Trump was still claiming that it was just going to go away and we didn't need to do anything.
You took an oath to preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States, which makes clear that, without an election, come January 20, there is no President. Want to make sure that we're all on the same page here. No election = no President. Trump can't hold over.

Yup like what Trump is doing in the US.
trump staffers need to prepare for their future.

He sued the guy who wrote tRUMP*land, not bc of the awful truths about him, but bc he wrote that tRUMP* wasn't all that rich. tRUMP* lost that lawsuit. So, there is that....
trump is finished.
Thomas Friedman just stated to the effect - assume Trump will refuse to leave office when he loses or appears to lose, but hope for the best.  All speculation, he admits.
I know who you’re talking about (I think)but I’m not gonna press that subject So the default ass hat it’s going to be Trump
Watch a repeating loop of Trump giving out his rhetoric see if you can stay silent🤪
They'll be back working for insurance companies when Trump loses.
Yes, they’ve concluded trump is a one term president and it’s now time to start undermining Biden.
Hell of a tweet to see immediately after reading this article about "moral outrage" directed at ambitious women:
with “Suburban Lifestyle Dream” trump has gifted us the most ominous, ironic, memorable name for a fiery PhD thesis or an 80s skate punk album, but sure go ahead and complain!

The future of the GOP? I hope at least one of them said, “Well,  and Trump are the natural result of the GOP’s ideology of NIMBYism and WIIFMness. Our worldview has wrought this. Therefore, we have no future in a moral country based on laws.”
I've said it before and I'll say it again: Louie Gohmert is one of the dumbest politicians I've ever seen. He's much like Trump in the way he is constantly uttering nonsense in front of a camera.
I do not know the "how" of this, but the "what" is that more prosperous neighborhoods will supposedly not have their property devalued by having Section 8 housing on the same street (which is, sadly and stupidly, a thing that happens). Also, Trump is an asshole.
Looks like the Trump train

Man, if only there was a way they could have simply not given trillions in tax cuts to the wealthy and corporations within a year of Trump taking office, and then continuing to increase the deficit every year since

Not real. The characters involved are real...characters.
This doctor who was retweeted by Trump says that the nephilim cause real health problems and financial ruin, that reptilians run the government, and that vaginal cysts are caused by demon sex.
In case anyone needed to see this.  Having a president who didn't post dangerous misinformation on social media would be nice.

That's the whole game with these people its plausible deniability, the older ones had better training on bullshit.. The last few white Presidents didn't even try to hide lies. Bush jr was really no different than Trump, One thing ALL other races do is stay on CODE.
I said  should start going after the GOP senators who enable Trump, and then they did! Where’s my  profile?
That trump was a wonderful leader, and that he reformed the house. 😢

The unwavering stupidity &amp; loyalty to Trump shows just how far these Nazis will go to believe the fascist bullshit he puts out
So much is happening yet nothing is happening. Until we get a vaccine, until we get Trump out, the news is just variations on a holding pattern.

Trump's running America like a business of his
Your statement saying these riotors are there because troops are there is ludicrous! They were there long before the military. You don't care about lives being lost to these anarchists!! You only care about destroying Trump and his administration no matter how many lives it cost!
Trump Announced, Then Canceled, a Yankees Pitch. Both Came as a Surprise. - The New York Times
The solution is to stop watching what the right hand does while the left one robs you blind. You focus so much on trump and the conservative party that you are blinded by what the democrats do. The Dems are still a right wing party

Trump was irritated that Fauci was given the honor, the Times reported, citing an official familiar with his reaction.
“And also point out the idea that there really is probably no single diagnosis. There’s so much overlap. His behaviors are often complex and often seem self-defeating that, you know, we need to dig a little deeper,” said Mary L. Trump.
A quote from Trump “the years before I was elected president were the best years of my life”. Well Obama was president in those years before you got elected !!!!
I’m dead at Trump using black models for his gear smh
Because that’s all that ORANGE NAZI TRUMP knows how to do - Make shit up then lie about his own lies.
Fuck it! Run that video guys! If Trump gets pissed enough he might have a stroke. Hahahahaha!
I’d tell a Trump as President joke but it’s just too sad
"To my good friend, Donny Trump, whose house I have dinner at whenever I'm in town. - Joe Namath"
(Trying and being wrong does require the mental fortitude/honesty to admit mistakes, cancel what doesn't work, and shift effort elsewhere. Trump is incapable of the 1st, and the GOP as a whole is not good at it. But if we don't get sane government next year, we're screwed anyway)
This is probably another example of "oh hell, it's pointless, but at least they'll shut up about it" legislation. Trump is well known to latch onto random ideas and push them (Hydroxychloroquine) and Kudlow brings to bear all the insight  of a history major turned TV pundit.It was horrible, talking about politics when ur supposed to give a eulogy at your friend's funeral.

Being sarcastic. Trump will wreck him.

The GOP Trump Depression
LMFAO they asked for federal assistance from Trump as well as protection from these exact circumstances. While you sat on Twitter criticizing them because you don’t want it to be clear that you’re incompetent at your job.
Will anyone notice now that Trump has consumed all the air with his insane tweet ? It’s another shiny object.
A number of congressional Republicans openly reject Trump's suggestion that November's presidential election should be delayed, a move that the President would have no authority to make
But it didn't. Trump did. Racist Trump. We'll wait while you let that sink in.
So Trump wants to delay the election...has that EVER happened in the 244 years of being a country??
You are right. The real surprise is that the whole Trump administration hasn't caught it.
This did not have to happen. He made the ultimate sacrifice--to Trump.
And that’s another reason Trump has to go. . . . He has none of those qualities.
A main has died and his family is grieving and all these idiots are just fixated on blaming trump.
you don’t  know trump his mess with the democrats heads 62% of people polled say they  afraid to  voice their political opinions . Those are all Trump supporters .
Trump looks incompetent all on his own.
Trump doesn’t even care.

Likely someone who cares about pleasing Trump. but not protecting other people spread the virus to someone who cares about pleasing Trump but not protecting other people. Keep the chain going. Woo woo!
Trump is a segregationist demagogue. If you have not realized that by now, have your head examined immediately.
A mask can give the wearer some degree of protection, especially the professional type vs. a scarf. So, someone who cared more about pleasing Trump than protecting other people likely gave it to someone who does the same. :)
Well since Trump cancelled the RNC they need riots to come back since they can't complain about COVID in Florida.
Trump and wit are not synonymous, I think he’s a Traitor to our nation . And bye the way, Trump did not give us Veterans Choice, I was using it under President Obama .

Hey if the Dems have to put the Trump's choice through the ringer while Biden takes over then I'm good with that. Majority will win out but put his pick through it hard. Trump made it that way so it shall be this time. Don't make it easy.

That’s one reason why so many schools will be online until November. The weeks before the election will be a disaster; that, on top of what will certainly be the Dems ratcheting up the country’s temperature to oust Trump. Can’t trust adults to protect our kids—maybe home is best.

He’s a Russian Useful Idiot )UI). Leaned about them on SHOWTIME series Homeland. The different is trump eyes are wide opened. He knowingly embraces killing US troops to keep Putin happy. This should be shown on EVERY news outlet! We hv a Russian spy in the White House.
The evolution has been obvious, and began long before trump
Jonathan did an outstanding job!! America Thank You! trump has Spoken with Putin 8 times and never once brought up bounties on US Troops. 8 calls no transcripts bc they were all about how to steal the 2020 election. All of this unrest/chaos is Putin’s idea.
Right on Dr Fauci. We love you and nobody likes trump.
Apparently it’s true, trump was so jealous of Fauci, he lied about throwing out the first pitch for the Yankees on Aug. 15, tried to take a longtime previous offer . Now he says he’ll be busy fighting the virus. Man boy child petty fn weirdo psycho!

Jim Jordan now fumigating the hearing room with truth. They’re after Barr bc he confirmed Obama DOJ spied on Team Trump.
I noticed the same thing, always saying he’s being attacked by conservs, it wasn’t until he started speaking out against Trump that I did start seeing ppl saying wth? I got tired of his constant whining &amp; complaining &amp; he noticed, bc several of us were saying same, he blocked me
I agree most normies are watching the riots and know what is going on they also realize the BLM / AWFLs will torch their houses if they show support for Trump.
I (and several others) spoke out against his constant flip flopping and whining and speaking out against President Trump on his page about 2 months ago, he ended up blocking me..
A lot of people are afraid of admitting to being Trump voters because they don't want their home torched by BLM.

The Trump campaign should hammer the idea that if Dems win White House and Senate, they’ll pass a multi-trillion dollar package to rescue bankrupt blue states and cities under siege. That’s why mayors are letting this happen—they’re gambling on a Dem sweep to bail them out.
Trump isn't on the streets, ANTIFA and the other Leftist favorites of the DNC are.  Financed by Soros another Democrat favorite.  DJT is at least trying to protect Federal Properties, because that is all the Feds can do at this point.  Local PD's all controlled by Dems won't.

Trump and the GOP have a big war chest to spend. Sadly, that  will buy a lot of hateful and fearful signs.
Grasping at straws are you trump
But we can’t vote in person? or Trump can’t have the RNC convention? Or huge rally’s?
Btw, the future GOP, either with or without Trump, will have no room for Russian collusion hucksters and religious bigots like French.
Phew!  Thank you  and President Trump.

This is crazy. Trump’s hissy fit with this long and steadfast Federal institution gives voice to the vindictive diversions he uses to hide his failure to lead. He’s only doing this to rig voting. Why doesn’t he just move to Putin’s guest house if he wants autocracy so badly?

Well said, Annette! I got a Twitter account as a blood pressure lowering device. With Trump out of office, I’m not worried about national safety, mass death and starvation. I’ll drop it when Biden wins.
Does he need to? Trump can’t even see his feet.
“And they say, the disinfectant. Can we inject it? Or the light in the body...” Has  gotten a injection of that alien blood, yet?
The magic virus fairies weren't able to use their pixie dust to destroy the Covid because Trump didn't order the US Military to imprison people in their homes at gunpoint and shoot them dead if they were out walking their dog or jogging in March.  Duh..  sarc//
You'll need pictures for Trump.... remember, he doesn't read much.
This is a damning portrait of the (lack of) federal government response to this threat. Some things are of large enough scope that only the US Gov. can address them -this was one, and Trump dropped the ball. Bigly. The election is a referendum on that failure.
These "stories" are only coming from Trump, so they can easily be dismissed as not credible.
This "joke" simply isn't funny. Maybe Russian bounties on US troops is also funny to Trump and Cornyn - they certainly don't seem to be taking it seriously!!
You’re right Joe Biden will try to get out of having any debate with Donald Trump. We the people want to have these debates move forward so we can make a choice based on what we hear

I find neither Trump nor Cornyn the least bit funny. They're shameful and embarrassing to our country.
"I assumed it was unthinkable."  Trump is going to do 100 more "unthinkable" things between now and January. Hopefully you now realize that we are dealing with an actual fascist, and you stop thinking that there is ANYTHING he will not do for power.
Trump is suppose to comfort our nation when he does his press conferences about the pandemic. He lies about it. He talks about how great he is. And he cry’s like a baby because Faci has a higher approval than him.
this is what happens when you consider your loyalty to trump more important than your own health. i would wish him peace, but i don't know what happen to trumpsters on the other side.
Who died because of the trump rally.
How are you surprised that the GDP drops when you shut down the economy?? Please tell how it could have been avoided?? You just make unqualified statements. Ok I will make one. The drop in GDP would have been worse if Trump wasn’t president. And the GDP will improve if he stays.

Government watchdog finds 'strong indicators of widespread fraud' in the $60 billion small busine...  via  with trump’s oversight what else would you expect?
Trump would most likely get impeached before that if he canceled the election - that might be a bridge too far for GOP enablers who put loyalty to Trump over country
I totally hear that. I just have a hard time shaming marginalized folks for not having faith in a voting system that has hurt them in many ways. But I also agree trump is directly hurting people too. It’s really a tough situation
It had better specifically call Trump all the things that you said Biden was calling him.  I look forward to you applying to the President the phrases "disloyal wannabe dictator," "evil and intent on destroying America," "un-American," and "traitorous intent."
There is no changing the minds of Trump supporters or Q-idiots. Our only hope in winning is getting independents to step up and vote and for all democrats to vote. Our numbers are way larger, but we need to stay energized. I just like to mess with them.

Give me ranked choice. Give me popular vote over Electoral College. But give me a Trump defeat in November, and only one vote does that.
I'm just saying if mental lucidity is the criterion, Trump has no claim to it either. It's Spiderman pointing at Spiderman. Will I be way more concerned about his VP choice than I was about Hillary's or Obama's? You bet.
Yes they are the same thing. Absentee is for people who might serve oversees or be otherwise unavailable whereas mail in is more convenience. Either way they use the same thing. Trump mailed in his vote for the Florida primaries this year
Delighting in someone’s death is gross. Sorry, but it’s gross. And calling that out is also appropriate. I don’t want to be like these rabid, frothy-mouthed, morally bankrupt minions for Trump.
Trump told a reporter in a 1:1 meeting that he just bombed Iraq. It was Syria. The reporter had to correct him. They might be on equal footing in a debate.
It's really shocking just how despicable and desperate the GOP has become. Why don't they get serious about their responsibilities? Free and fair elections. Extending supplemental unemployment insurance. Mandate masks EVERYWHERE Denouncing Trump as he lies his way to November.

We seem to forget that Trump is a few cards short of a deck. Biden could win a debate by staying on script while Trump goes off about how he's the stablest of geniuses and fittest and the best doctor and best truck driver and whatever he invents for the day.
This is some good news. It would be nice if he would address Trump, and let him know that he has ZERO authority to change the election date.
The lifeboats aren't available as long as the overriding philosophy of the Republican rank-and-file is "Donald Trump is an infallible omnipotent god-king who rules by divine right and must never be questioned."
Biden's team has wisely positioned Joe as the "Not Trump" candidate and done its level best to keep him out of the spotlight and put all of the attention on Trump.   With a big lead, there's not much incentive for Biden to agree to a debate: all risk, no reward.
Quit comparing. Trump is responsible for not only Cain’s death but for 150,000 Americans.

New York has more covid deaths than every country in the world except for 5.  Trump had a fkn hospital ship sent to its port.

President Trump floats delaying the presidential election, citing his own prediction of fraudulent voting. Can he do this? #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica
only took these mfs 4 years of trump to figure out the right tone for the moment
Time for a new revolution.
Trump may be keeping America sick so that it makes voting set- up more difficult for states to enact. Causing chaos, leaves state voting administrators in the dark, thus wasting their time when they should be organizing for mail in ballots , etc.
Trump: Let me float this out there...  People: THAT IS AN ABOMINATION!  Trump Supporters: Kidding! Kidding! See the question mark? He's such a kidder, that super stable genius of ours.   Trump, in interview: No, I'm not kidding. I don't kid.
That's because Trump is a callous old man who can't do the right thing seemingly ever.
I think a number of people saw this coming.... but scarily, Trump is still floating the idea. Too bad (for him) it won't happen.
Any vote against Trump is likely fraudulent, at least in his mind.
This is simply Trump's desperation in full view. It would be nice if someone in his Administration would let him know the date can't be moved.
On January 20 Trump’s term ends.. If for some reason we did not have an election Pelosi becomes president.. We have a constitution.. The only question is will the military follow the commander in chief or some rogue branch of the government
Fun Fact: Joe Biden appeared in several debates for the Democratic Primary. This year. Was he 'great'? No. But is Trump good at debates? LOL, no. Trump would have to answer questions on everything he's done wrong and LOL it's a really long list.
You do realize that there are millions of American who are NOT protesting in person who still would benefit from a mail-in ballot.   No, of course you don’t. Your profile says you’re a “School Safety Advocate” AND you’re on Team Trump. Classic example of an oxymoron.
Oh hell no...  Trump suggests delaying November U.S. presidential election
Why does trump keep pushing disproved drugs as an antidote for Covid?  Easy. Either he or his kids have stock, lots of stock, in the company.  or  He forgot that he's done this already and can't think of anything else to say.
How about Trump shuts up and does HIS job? Thousands of people dying each day. Trump does nothing. We need more testing. Trump does nothing. Solders being murdered by Taliban via Russia. Trump does nothing. Lost livelihoods? Nothing. Funds for the wealthy? Trump is all in.
The CRAZY thing about Trump saying we should delay the election is the US GDP fell by 32.9% in the 2nd quarter. The largest recorded drop in history.   More than 1.43M people filed for unemployment benefits for the 1st time last week, rising for a 2nd week.
Trump us districting from the worst US GDP drop in history. He can't delay the election.

At about age 1, babies learn object permanence. I.e., something still exists even when you can't see it. Just like with the covid testing, Trump evidently believes that if we can't see low income people, they simply disappear. Like if we don't test for covid we won't have cases.
I think he lost me at his second "Trump's America."

Watching TV IS Trump's version of "working".
Trump is simply a short-sighted fool. The world, especially Putoin and Xi, are playing chess, with strategic plans. Trump can't even understand the rules of their game, so he tries to play checkers, and even fails at that.
Look to the City of South Milwaukee when results come in. Clinton won it only by a point as it swung against her compared to Obama's 2012 margin and Evers only won by 2. Biden would like to get a 5 point win or better, while Trump would love to pull out a win here. 6/6
This is a region were Biden will want to continue to build on Clinton's 11 point lead here and get closer to Senator Baldwin's win of 15 points, while Trump would love to get close to only losing by around Walker's 7 point margin. 5/6
Comparing the two elections one can see that Walker did do better than Trump did in many of these municipalities. I would argue this is due to a positive home region effect for Walker and a dislike of Trump. Evers did do better in many of the blue-collar communities. 4/6

How does the Trump Admin get away with stating they are not accepting DACA applications after the Supreme Court decision directing them to continue the program???
I think Trump likes that doctor because he's found his intellectual equal.

Neither. I will acknowledge he has the brain of a 75 year old, the remnants of a speech impediment and like Trump, is more plainspoken than most polished politicians and thus gaffes more easily. The difference between his gaffes and Trump’s is the hateful rhetoricI can't believe that Trump and his croney Postmaster are actually fucking with the American Postal Service for their own gain. People get paper checks through the USPS, like Social Security and unemployment, bills they must pay. Makes me want to throw up!
The U.S. Postal Service is experiencing days-long backlogs of mail across the country after a top Trump donor running the agency put in place new procedures described as cost-cutting efforts,
It's been obvious he's a fascist, to Steve as well. He's just postponing himself strategically because now Trump might lose.
Obama's eulogy must have gotten under TucKKKer KKKarlson's thin skin like it got under Trump's thin skin. They both are lashing out.
Nice speeches by a bloodthirsty warmonger. Let's count his "contributions". War in Libya, Syria, Yemen, Ukraine, violent protests all over the Middle East, millions killed and many millions lost everything and turned into refugees. I prefer "bad speeches" of Trump and end wars.
You know who wrote a great book? Mary Trump.
Eh, this kind of lesser evil balancing act is how you end up with parties excusing people like Trump. Zero tolerance is the way to go, not “limited tolerance in ratio of how much I agree with them.”
The amount of negative Trump tweets on Twitter is absolute insane. Everyday on twitter, its always posts against #Trump Kind of makes it seem like we are living in the USSR when the media only shows Leftists agenda #VoteRed #EnoughIsEnough #MAGA #VoteTrump2020 #WakeUpAmerica
Wow  you’re going to let  make fun of someone’s bipolar disorder? What a disgusting “lady” you’re putting on your show. She’s already a disgusting racist, but let’s add mockery of mental illness to the mix. Her Trump-loving saggy ass needs to go.
I just wish this moron called President Trump will quit telling me what I know? everybody knows that he says about voter fraud with mail in ballots well I don’t know! it don’t tell me what I know you could tell you’re moron followers what they know but you can’t tell me.
Trump couldn't muster 50 GOP votes for ACA repeal, his executive branch takes everything he says "seriously not literally", and he might literally become the first R candidate lose among active duty military since like Bob Dole.
It’s not easy, but I’m going to keep it up. For at least 97 more days. Two hours every day in the lions den of conservative talk radio, trying to convince folks not to vote for Donald Trump. To put country 1st.  Catch the podcast of today’s Joe Walsh Show.
The most likely reason Trump Tweeted his "postpone the election" crap.
I mean obv when they say "vote" its against trump. its so dumb
Sorry you were laid off by the Trump Virus.
Here’s my cat wearing a Trump wig
I'm a mom. Trump is horrible for moms.  what do you think?
Trump WH Reportedly Ditched National Testing Plan in April Because Virus Was Only Hitting ‘Blue States’ Hard #SmartNews This story does not shock me one bit.
And Trump had a laundry list of things to distract from today.
and while that is hardly inconceivable, it also just doesn't seem likely. Nobody outside of his innermost circle is interested in making Trump a king, not at the risk of their reputations and certainly not at the risk of a protracted civil conflict.
Even Stephen Calabresi now supports this idea.
Interesting point. A couple notes:  1. Conservatives won so much from 1980 to even 2016 that too many got intellectually and morally lazy. There's no platform. We're a bit like seat belt-law people.  2. Trump made the GOP into a cult of hating immigrants and "owning the libs."
I parked my car in trump towers fucking clown😂
This Trump Virus is pissing me off!
“Until recently, I had taken as political hyperbole the Democrats’ assertion that President Trump is a fascist,” #Calabresi wrote. “But this latest tweet is fascistic and is itself grounds for the president’s immediate impeachment again by the House“
And kind.  Thanks to Trump, history will be good to W.
right, I'm just agreeing. Ultimately, I think the big thing is that so far Trump just breaks laws and people choose not to enforce them. It's passive tolerance of corruption, banal shit. Delaying the election would require decisive action in his favor, up to and including a coup
A bunch of people said Trump wasn’t misdirectioning us from the economic numbers with his whole “change the date of the election??” and but did he even get one question about the 33% drop in GDP at his press conference today? How many reporters tweeted about it more than once?
Trump Might Try to Postpone the Election. That’s Unconstitutional.
Mike these players have become a bunch of coddled wussies. I was a big fan of baseball. But with the kneeling and the BLM support, I'm done. Trump 2020!!!
⁦ I’ll clue you in, those aren’t Republicans. They’re not conservatives. And the leaders have huge debts to pay off.

just remembered trump said earliy on he would rathe resign than have he taxes made public
The Russian trolls are out in droves tonight - like flying cockroaches. If you see a MAGA tweet, check the profile. It they have barely any followers, it's most likely a bot. People who have low numbers like 3-25 followers after 4 years of this fucking hell with Trump are bots.
So.. fake dossiers concocted by the Obama-Biden admin are OK?  But dossiers based on facts by Trump admin = evil?  Get your head out of your ass.

Trump said that he would have a new health mcare plan in place two weeks from his interview with Chris Wallace. That would be Sunday. Look forward to seeing it
Why? Because you listen to Breitbart and support Trump?
Idc if you make fun of liberals or trump supporters it’s funny in both ways 😂 making fun of liberals and trump supporters is funny as hell just said your meme isn’t funny cuz it’s not accurate 😂
I think Mueller owes most of us an apology for not doing due diligence. Not pursuing Trump’s financial records was a major failure by Mueller and a dereliction of duty.
Neither point is really correct. Trump can flaunt some laws because the stakes are relatively low or the enforcement mechanisms are hazy/controlled by people willing to look the other way. That does not mean he can do literally anything, he has achieved surprisingly little.

Anderson Cooper: Like A Man Possessed, Trump Keeps Praising 'Demon Sex' Doctor  #SmartNews
This is absolutely genius from the folks at the Lincoln Project.  The true facts of Trump sound so made up for Hollywood when the get spoken back. This is a must watch.
I don't even talk to friends who are Trump supporters. Why the hell would I help some old white guy who helped keep women down my entire life? I know those guys.
Well Mike, I'm betting the Coronavirus victims, or the victims of ICE/CPB power abuses or the victim who was killed by some right-wing yahoo in Charlottesville in 2017 would say the same about the world you Mr. Trump have built.
High enthusiasm for defeating Trump of course. Plus last I checked Biden’s enthusiasm has increased substantially from a few months ago now that the general election is in full swing.
Plausible deniability,  can claim he didn't say that. Other users in his account did it. Trump did it. Trump hacked his account.  Nope, he's been bad for America and nothing has changed.   Trump knows all their secrets and is exposing each one.  God Bless Pres. Trump
I think about those early weeks of the outbreak, when Trump kept pointing to some study proclaiming the U.S. was No. 1 at preparing for a pandemic. That's just the sort of thing a real estate and business huckster would hype.
Trump is a sociopath trying to murder black leaders one at a time
When  wins in Nov, and the Dems take back the Senate, we really have to take steps to dismantle Fox News, as a news station.   It’s more dangerous to this country than Trump

We can’t trust this president for a minute. This fucker and his team are up to something. You can smell the stench in the air. The election is in jeapordy. His base will buy into his bullshit. Trump respects no one, he’s scared of Putin, I wish we knew why to get rid of his ass.
Sounds like this is a you problem. I suggest you review civics and stop promoting trump’s lies. You’re in a cult. Seek help.
Singletary isn’t just taking a picture w/ the President for his den. He decided in these divided &amp; terrible times, less than 100 days from an election to appear to actively or passively endorse Donald Trump. So yeah. I question the f*ck out that &amp; yeah it makes me like him less.
All this happened 👏in👏tRump’s👏America👏
Oh, Trump is trying to lose too.
What’s even worse: It was SO easy . Putin installs Trump as his useful idiot. Trump drools for 3+ years. 50 million Americans &amp; entire GOP fall for this fraud. So here we are.
Get everyone you know registered to vote. Arrange rides to polling places. Help with mail in ballots. We must do everything we can to end this nightmare and vote out Trump and all his minions. God help us that we make it to January 20th.
Yep. Trump is disgraceful.
As opposed to ramping up infrastructure to ensure meeting demand. You can stop reading after words “Trump donor running the agency”.
Yet Trump was calling the Coronavirus a hoax not long ago. Hypocrites.
I’m going to put exactly that in my will. “Obama is invited and can say whatever he feels like. Trump is not invited”. Every american should add that.
A chicken 🐔 crossing the road would make a better president than Trump. At the chicken gets exercise and produces eggs.
I’ve loved Bush since Trump’s inauguration with his “that was some weird shit” comment.

It all has to come out eventually. My guess is RU mob took over NYC after the Sicilian mafia was busted in the late 80s. They lured  in dummy Trump and his greedy family. Trumps got in deep shit financially through shady real estate deals. This was his way of paying Putin back 🤷‍♂️
Exactly. We are safe under Trump. Give or take a 1500000 dead people. And the economy is roaring, if you forget about all the unemployed people. Trump will protect us from kids and graffiti though.
Trump can declare all the emergencies he wants. But the election will proceed.
The Trump American Bankrputcy.
I'm not entertaining an Obama pissing contest with a child when Trump has, in fact, been president for nearly four years. Grow up.
Now the Trump is coming out in you. Wow. Nice manners.
Only reason emotional twats are voting for you is because you’re not trump. You will fuck more things up in your first 100 days just from forgetting to sign your name. Fear the silent majority. I’ve been a lifetime dem, but I’m done with this party. Trump 2020, Crenshaw 2024
Then those states do not get to send electors to vote for Trump nor do they get to have Senators and Congressmen.  Not having elections has consequences.
The evidence that Barr is working on behalf of saving Trump’s ass is right in front of us.  had  thrown back in jail because he talked about writing a tell-all. #RogerStone conviction was commutated because he didn’t rat out trump. Flynn is up for a pardon.
Trump is that house with the republican red roof
So many many more DO want to talk about it now!! 😀 The Great Awakening! Ya know, hydrochloroquine is said to also decalcify the pineal(third eye) gland. Perhaps THIS is part of the GREAT AWAKENING...Trump is brilliant!
Yes. Biden has more experience and knowledge of the world and the political system than Trump. Biden would at least fact check before he talks, where Trump just constantly shoots off with the mouth.
Every #CNBC headline goes like this: Experts question whether Trump is right.
Trump has been destroying America for 3.5 years and stealing babies from their mothers, BUT NOW THE FEDERALIST SOCIETY CARES!  FUCK THEM TRAITOROUS BUMS!

I get the feeling there is something going on in Kansas right now, yet it’s not clear what it is. Cruz, Kobach, Thiel, McConnell, Trump, Pompeo….lots of action for one Senate seat among many.
Maybe those 3 could visit Trump one night like the ghosts in A Christmas Carol and scare him into leaving the White House.
I guess. I'd like to know who wished for Trump? Let's face it even the Republicans thought that he was a Kook in the beginning.
In any sane world, this would be Game Over.  The Trump administration needs to be tried for crimes against humanity.  #TrumpVirus #TrumpVirusDeathToll150K
Oh look. Swanson boy is butthurt by *checks notes* Obama standing up for what Rep. Lewis believed in and civil liberties of the people.   Tuck tuck can go fuck himself. All that Trump has done for 4 years is campaign at his Y'all Qaeda rallies.
Reminder that Donald Trump doesn’t like dogs.   Only sociopaths don’t like dogs.
Donald Trump has cheated his whole life. Of course he’ll cheat in this election. Heck, he cheated in the last one.

Trump 2020: My life matters  1. He only cares about himself 2. His supporters only care about themselves 3. None of them care about Black lives  I'd expect my check in the mail, but Trump Org would prob just renege on it.
I think the Trump presidency has made a lot of white people feel naive.
what’s the game plan when trump tries to challenge the election results? I truly hope the campaign is scenario planning because you just know he’s gonna try something.
Yeah that's probably also what most of Trump's business bankruptcies were like
Never did I imagine the day would come when Steven Calabresi called for #Trump's impeachment.
Does Trump come off crass when he talks, yes. He's not always the best diplomatic person when it comes to speaking. But he's doing a good job I rather have someone that speaks like he does then someone who speaks politically correctly and does a poor job.
It's kinda of like, I think Trump is despicable and that that is an emotional reaction.  However,  there is overwhelming evidence that can convict him once he out of office. Yet his supporters CHOOSE to ignore that, but can plainly see the evidence here. Crazy🤔
you’re enabling Trump’s despotic attempts to steal the election.

Thats fine. But hes literally a male candace owens. Left the democratic party right around trumps election now they're all for republican talking points. I dont trust people who switch to make money. Candace had a doxxing site against trump then she became cons overnight...
And I hate that people thought that Trump was trying to destroy the Affordable Care Act. He actually made it so that more doctors would have to accept people that were insured by Medicaid.
This is interesting but fails to point out that Trump is close to Peter Thiel, who is spending massively to support Kris Kobach.  That’s important info.
Well illustrates how insane Trump &amp; co are...
#BlueWave I agree. We need to be a big tent and welcome those (NO MATTER HOW MUCH WE DISAGREE), who disavow Trump... even if he is a founder of the Federalist Society.
Now do Trump or even Jr.

Chris Hayes on Trump's flagrant assault on democracy: "The question of what the law allows becomes less important than what we the citizens will allow."

People need to realize that human beings do some of the most inhumane things in the world,  Jesus is not involved as many wish.   Human beings on all sides invent lies to prove there fault -  Trump has been doing it for a long time!   Being a politician is not being a CEO.

I think she just learned Trump is going to deport her.
It would cost hundreds of thousands lives. That is completely unacceptable--there should be no "battle" in that regard. There is nothing sad in that, as you suggest. It's called doing the right thing. Trump is sick, happy to send other people's kids to school--but not his own.
Yeah, all those pictures you see of kids being locked in cages when they were taken into custody at the border that was from the Obama administration. Trump did not have that done.
If Donald Trump could, he would step down to allow Putin to take over America and Democracy. Trump has yet to prove his loyalty to our Constitution and Rule of Law. He has a petty disposition that gives him the delusion that what he says is law. He think he’s our dictator.

What is not a hoax is Trump has to go away, I would suggest Russia or North Korea, where dictator's play with lives, like one would expect of judging angry god's that a lot of evangelists believe in.....
To be clear....that tweet finally hits home and effects him personally so NOW he cares. Too little too late. Good to note that he’s probably just as anxious to get trump out of here as the rest of us.
Except almost everything Trump says is a lie:
Half of these are googled pics, the actual meme are actual pfp's of trump supporters on twitter. Lame attempt at humor.

Incorrect. No evidence they're refusing to answer. Is it only "Q" cultists still defending Trump on here? I guess that's a good sign though. It means the intelligent Republicans have mostly given up trying to defend him, mostly having abandoned ship. Good news.
I don’t think Trump understands reality or what a suburb is like... he was just stoking fears.  Maybe OP is talking about people I don’t know (ppl with money) moving to the suburbs... when I think about leaving the city it’s mostly cuz I can’t afford to live here much longer
Let’s just put the dagger in...let’s vote!  Trump 2020
Looks like so far they all oppose the idea of election delay -   Of course the president has no power to delay the election regardless.
Trump is not a King. Most will not be forced to put their lives, or family's lives, in jeopardy for the economy. Therefore, beat back the virus, make workers feel safe, solve the problem.

Trump is doing his damnedest to destroy your faith in our government, the FBI, CIA, all of our institutions, Free Press, Free Speech ... and our election process. He knows he has no chance of winning unless he scares the crap out of you.  Don't let that happen, please.  VOTE.

The odds are that he got it at the rally. Sadly for him, he drank Trump's Kool Aid. A five week lag between his exposure and his death. There are a lot of individuals being infected now that would succumb in August and September.

Please again educate yourself. If Dems or whoever was to “leak” his tax information wouldn’t you think it would have been done by now?  The IRS would have to release them, nothing to do with either party. Check the most recent Supreme Court decision.He might still be alive if 1) trump hadn’t held his Tulsa rally or 2) trump had encouraged everyone there to wear a mask.
I don't want trump period . Pos
Definitely trump
Trump’s Sudden Photo-Op Just Happened To Be During Obama's John Lewis Eulogy  via  it didn’t help him
Hoping that trump is shown as much compassion as he has shown to Reality Winner.
I know!  She’s as good as that Anthony guy that “worships” Trump. It’s awesome. 😂

You'll need pictures for Trump.... remember, he doesn't read much.
This is a damning portrait of the (lack of) federal government response to this threat. Some things are of large enough scope that only the US Gov. can address them -this was one, and Trump dropped the ball. Bigly. The election is a referendum on that failure.
These "stories" are only coming from Trump, so they can easily be dismissed as not credible.
This "joke" simply isn't funny. Maybe Russian bounties on US troops is also funny to Trump and Cornyn - they certainly don't seem to be taking it seriously!!
You’re right Joe Biden will try to get out of having any debate with Donald Trump. We the people want to have these debates move forward so we can make a choice based on what we hear
Someone tweeted that trump has a 43% approval rating from blacks.
Trump does not and never has had a 43% approval rating from blacks. Never.
Numerous polling places have been eliminated making it more difficult to vote. At the same time trump is attempting to stop mail in voting during a pandemic while he himself (and his family) have voted by mail.
Terrible you used a funeral to go after Trump.
That's trump and Epstein. 13 yrs old. Maxwell has receipts.
I find neither Trump nor Cornyn the least bit funny. They're shameful and embarrassing to our country.
Twitter to MKs: Unlike Trump tweets, Khamenei’s ‘eliminate Israel’ posts are ok  via
Donald Trump should resign. Pass it on.
Government watchdog finds 'strong indicators of widespread fraud' in the $60 billion small busine...  via  with trump’s oversight what else would you expect?
There is no changing the minds of Trump supporters or Q-idiots. Our only hope in winning is getting independents to step up and vote and for all democrats to vote. Our numbers are way larger, but we need to stay energized. I just like to mess with them.
Trump could not speak like Bush or Clinton or Obama !  Trump is a joke
Doesn't take a rocket scientist to understand trump plays the media, or figure out the timing of his "press conference" during Obama's eulogy
I have a serious question, when tRump gets out of office, do we call him Mr. President, or by his inmate number?
He only kicked him out after they had a property dispute, Trump was totally fine with underage girls. Look it up, he was charged with rape of a 14 year old girl. And I thought you Q idiots were banned from Twitter.
Exactly! Ask Herman Cain....whoops, nevermind. BTW  , Mary Trump said your father-in-law didn't know who you were until you blew smoke up his ass at the rep convention. I've heard of bad in law stories, that ranks in the top 3.
I agree with the racist part, not idiot. *45, &amp; every minion he put in place know very well what they're doing, how to do it &amp; how to get away with it. And, it's working. "Pausing" the election, abolishing the post office. Covid-19 was a gift to trump, great distraction.
It's really shocking just how despicable and desperate the GOP has become. Why don't they get serious about their responsibilities? Free and fair elections. Extending supplemental unemployment insurance. Mandate masks EVERYWHERE Denouncing Trump as he lies his way to November.
How can evangelicals refuse to see genuine Christian belief like bill and Nancy and still call trump one of their own? Watching them you know they both genuinely have faith in God.
Would you have laughed had Hillary or Obama tweeted that? A lot of GOP people seemed to have developed quite the sense of humor since trump was elected.
Had trump said anything about the death of the head of Blacks for Trump? Herman Cain was the head of the Blacks for Trump organization. And nothing. So disrespectful.
The cost of believing Trump's lies: #HermanCain #COVID19 #NotAHoax
This is some good news. It would be nice if he would address Trump, and let him know that he has ZERO authority to change the election date.
This. This is what makes my stomach curl. So many things that were not presidential have been normalized by trump. And not this year but in 20 years when someone says well president trump proposed it during the covid pandemic. American's have short memories unfortunately.
This looks like a newspaper from a nightmare, but I'm 100% awake - so the nightmare must be Trump.  #VoteDEM2020
Is Trump selling ads in his Twitter feed now??
First your Trump interview, now this... you're on a roll!! Keep it going!
Where does Trump find these losers??? Is there really NO ONE better qualified for this position?
Monday morning quarterbacks, not problem solvers.  When POTUS banned travel with China, Democrats cried unnecessary, and xenophobic?  Good thing we didn't listen to Joe.  This is called a novel virus, bc it's unique.  President Trump has done as much as his office allows;
I understand why Trump is against election security. But I CANNOT understand why the rank and file GOP lemmings are against it - it's not a good look when you choose Trump's idiotic ramblings over good, sound policy.
The only threat from vote-by-mail is to Trump's re-election. Period.
We deserve to see an "x-ray" of this transaction to see who really benefits!! Insiders bought lots of stock, according the volume surge for Kodak.... Just another shady Trump/Kushner deal!!
Democrats had no response to the pronominal economy built by Pres Trump, except "fear of COVID."  Must maintain fear, to continue devastation of small business.  Under Socialist/Marxist O'Biden policy, all jobs must come from Government. Small business threatens that monopoly.
The real reason for Trump's election Tweet. Stay focused.
I have an idea, as long as IMPOTUS wants the date change in his kingdom of Trump, can we have it next week?!?!
That's because Trump is a callous old man who can't do the right thing seemingly ever.
I think a number of people saw this coming.... but scarily, Trump is still floating the idea. Too bad (for him) it won't happen.
Any vote against Trump is likely fraudulent, at least in his mind.
This is simply Trump's desperation in full view. It would be nice if someone in his Administration would let him know the date can't be moved.
Why does trump keep pushing disproved drugs as an antidote for Covid?  Easy. Either he or his kids have stock, lots of stock, in the company.  or  He forgot that he's done this already and can't think of anything else to say.
The CRAZY thing about Trump saying we should delay the election is the US GDP fell by 32.9% in the 2nd quarter. The largest recorded drop in history.   More than 1.43M people filed for unemployment benefits for the 1st time last week, rising for a 2nd week.
This is where it starts. Trump will refuse to concede the election and refuse to give up power.
How can that be. Trump just said. President Trump’s repeated claim: ‘The greatest economy in the history of our country’.
You are tying to set up your excuse for loosing. When you loose you will need to blame it on something else. Like how you do with everything. I call it first. When Trump looses. He blames the Mail.
Trump. No taxes no ballot
You need to pray to Lord Trump. That is the only god. The J in Donald J Trump stands for Jesus, you know.
'Unfortunately, HVAC techs don’t make great pilots but if this is an invitation to provide mechanical services in the White House or on Air Force One, we’re all ears!” the tweet continued.' #marketing #hvac #phcppros Air Force One PHCPPros
It’s common knowledge that the liberals are being pushed by an agenda much higher than your regular democratic American. It’s a super filthy business &amp; population control is huge with them. They know Trump knows and will expose them. This is your answer.
Isn’t that the same argument you used when you couldn’t pass your college English class, “I only failed your class because you don’t like conservative thought.” Between you and Trump I don’t know who whines and cries more. 97 more days til you aren’t relevant.
vote for trump if you have a boat.
Pssh, trump is such a loser quitter, bailing on Portland already. If only he’d blackbagged more hippies, or maybe cracked a few more veterans’ skulls, he’d be crushing it in the polls.
Great news for us suburbanites. Thank you President Trump.
Didn't Germany get hit hard in an economic disaster (and they're still paying off a lot of that debt on countries like Greece) caused by a repub. admin. Plus, both Pres. Bush W and trump drastically lowered interest rates to artificially stimulate the economy for their reelection
Mr. Trump -- we can give you a million reasons why "nobody likes you."  Lies for a start.
Yeah!!! Let’s get it done once and for all. TRUMP 2020!!
Yeah!  I'm going to take this handle, "Trump's Black Grandson's number one fan."
Our Lord and Savior Trump never lies. He said this virus would disappear “poof” by April and it has!  Don’t believe the fake news and dying people. These people are only dying because they are in on the conspiracy against our Lord Trump!  Donald Jesus Trump  Amen. 🇺🇸 🦅 🙏
You're a Bernie supporter and you're defending trump's secret police?!?     Bernie would be disappointed in you buddy.
The "fake news" reports (which the Attorney General agreed with yesterday) is that there is no credible evidence of vote-by-mail fraud.  Except by members of the Trump Administration who use old addresses!!
This was totally expected when Trump nominated an inexperienced donor pal for Postmaster General - this is the kind of shill that will follow orders and trash not just the election, but the USPS overall, which many people really depend on.
Loved when the dude asked Zuckerberg about trump junior getting suspended on twitter. Their aides must be Lincoln Project plants. No way they should be that unprepared.
I don’t see how any serviceman or servicewoman or veteran could vote for trump now.
What is trump supposed to do about a dictator that also turns out to be the second most powerful nation in the world?
That describes my dream, but Trump's worst nightmare!
expense.  I know, they promised to take money from billionaires and give it to you!  Billionaires have the means to take their money elsewhere.  Do you? They can't control billionaires, they "will" control you.  President Trump ended this crazy Socialist scheme.  Vote Dem out!
The White House/GOP SHOULD be worried about this - we've seen them fail at every turn in this pandemic. The country needs help, not lies and other nonsense from Trump and his crew. DO THE WORK OF GOVERNANCE!!!
So Trump still hasn't offered any sort of "vision" or plan for his second term. It's great that he can verbally trash the Green New Deal - but where is any Republican deal of any kind? Especially on health care - his 2 weeks to unveil his plan is almost up!! (It was another lie!)
overblown, overreaching, Democrat run Federal Government. AFFH was put in place by O'Bidens, but Trump never enforced it.  Feds take over zoning in your towns, they force low income housing in your neighborhood, then force citizens to pay for it.  Fair housing will require a mix
Because Trump is a small, petty man. Period.
Watching TV IS Trump's version of "working".
Trump is simply a short-sighted fool. The world, especially Putoin and Xi, are playing chess, with strategic plans. Trump can't even understand the rules of their game, so he tries to play checkers, and even fails at that.
Jesus, it's not like Trump has gotten markedly better in 2 weeks.
Your still concerned about keeping the GOP in power. All trump enablers have to go. America is more important than either political party.
Nothing but race-baiting from Trump.  It will not keep him in office!
Do you want Donald Trump to "Clean Out Your City"? Will you "Obey" Donald Trump? Will you let Him Decide? Everything?
Trump will be in the White House attic tonight looking to see if any of those uniforms are left!
The killers are the same illegal aliens who crash our border and show up in American neighborhoods.  Do you think they are importing rapists &amp; murderers?  This is exactly the element, President Trump was trying to repel, not every Hispanic a murderer, but Juarez is full of them.
You believe, whatever Socialist/Marxist/Democrats spoon feed you thru a biased media.  Yesterday, President Trump retweeted a video of a dozen doctors, who appeared on the lawn of their medical facility, to announce the great therapeutic value of Hydroxychloroquine, &amp; recommended
Joe, you know the history and heart of this country and I know a political platitude when I see one. You’re full of crap, just like Trump.
How does the Trump Admin get away with stating they are not accepting DACA applications after the Supreme Court decision directing them to continue the program???
I think Trump likes that doctor because he's found his intellectual equal.
I guess he thought praising Trump provided some sort of immunity.... oops.
Why TF would we do this? Oh that's right trump's capriciousness.
Sorry, but Trump is simply an idiot. Incapable of seeing anything in terms OTHER than $$$$. It's all he cares about - and he's very wrong in this case, those troops and the American facilities in Germany are critical!
Is trump saying he is ALSO waging a disinformation campaign ???
This is the logic of a 3rd grader.... "did the Taliban pay bounties??" --&gt; answer: "yes, but..."  Trump does not have the GUTS to confront Putin on this - plain and simple.
I really think nina Turner style progressives want trump to win. I'd guess about 25% of Bernie bros want trump to win. They can't govern. They have no platform except med4all. And I don't think half of them even care about it. It just some rallying cry.
This Administration is a complete train wreck. Misinformation, lying, tweeting idiot doctors who believe in demons and aliens, "needing" a new FBI building to protect their hotel from competition, and now going after social networks that have hurt Trump's feelings and covid mess.
"Other issues?" You mean like the upcoming election and what he could do to guarantee your re-election? That kind of issue?  Very important.  So, how do you like being a puppet, trump?  We hate it.
Sorry. I've given up arguing with trump supporters. I refer to those completely contradictory verses in the Bible that are right next to each other
This is exactly my original point, would we have been better off under British rule without the vote (like today under trump's rule) where poor people would have had to pay all the taxes, or is something better than nothing, something that can be built upon like Lincoln did?
...and learn that it's all about the might dollar for Trump. Not coronavirus aid dollars, but those flowing into his properties. THAT is his #1 priority.
I think the American people (via  ) may have to help us dig into the financial shenanigans the Trump Admin is doing with all of the coronavirus stuff - the "air bridge" and "operation warp speed" and investing billions into as of yet unproven vaccines.  HELP US, Stephanie!
I think Jonathan Swan does not need a "history lesson" from Trump on USSR -&gt;Russia! I also think that Trump is clearly ignorant about the world and what happens in it. No clue... and unwilling to stand up for US interests, clearly.
Democrats reclaiming "their" time?  What about my time?  I tuned in to hear Barr, instead I heard egotistical Democrats repeating their objections to Trump policy. Reminding Barr and the People, how important their time is?  How much respect them deserve? Gaggle of grifters!
Trump is Gassing Citizens that dispute him. Let That sink in.
“ Justice B. Kavanaugh urged his colleagues in a series of private memos ...according to multiple sources familiar with the inner workings of the court.”and now the #scotus is leaking memos and docs?! 😱
Censorship!  What kind of hearing does not" hear" the  guest? Twitter actually deleted Trump posted video, of a team of doctors who were pro Hydrochlorogiune, pro return to school.  Only lasted minutes b4 Twitter deleted?  This is not America, this is not free speech or freedom!
As a Trump supporter it really does piss me off when he retweets himself. like MF. No one of Earth has the right to do that besides God.
Heating up engines...
J Swan, Trump seemed cornered when he changed course on your bounty question and diverted to conflicts in other parts of the world like India.
there's a lot of focus on trump, but trump is not the source of fascism in this country, nor will removing trump end fascism in this country
if you're unfamiliar with the history of steven bannon and the trump campaign, he was part of the team who, in 2014, selected trump for the 2016 election

Isn’t he the one that brought a bucket of chicken at a hearing ?! And they call Trump juvenile 🤣🤣🤣
History will record that we'd have been better off if Trump had said &amp; done absolutely nothing since the outbreak of the virus, just twiddled his thumbs and sat there silently and passively.  Because everything he has said and done has only helped to prolong it and make it worse.
just fine actually, considering that trump's cult base is STILL chanting #lockherup everyday for the past 5 years!😆😆😆

Omg. Joe is nothing to us. He is a poor choice for a candidate and I would have loved to have Kamala or Warren. But. He’s still better than Trump and that’s what matters. Do. You. Understand. That. A. Turd. Would. Be. Better. Than. Trump.
There literally has to be sooo much money involved by the tRump family. and IT WILL be exposed at some point.  Why else would this group be SOOOO desperate to push this drug?  I hope to God someone figures it out!!!!
So after helping trump get reelected, he then takes away the vote without any checks what so ever, (the rich get richer and without the vote, the poor get even poorer) That's exactly why we revolted against Britain, extensive taxes without the vote

Fauci Responds To Trump Tweet Accusing Him Of Misleading The Public  via
Which of them is feeding Trump his info??
Now do tRump sr
Mr Johnson, your corrupt party used deep state Democrats to initiate, without evidence, 30 investigations against President Trump; 12 Congressional, 10 criminal &amp; 8 state/local.  Amid this 4 yr unmitigated attack on President Trump, deep state Democrats trapped Flynn and Stone.
New bill includes 1.75 billion for FBI building?? Wtf and 200 for unemployment..  recession, pandemic, racism,. Trump brought the fucking apocalypse
&amp; looting didn't follow.  These statistics are gathered &amp; published by Washington Post, not a ally of Trump. Narrative of systemic, police brutality is a lie.  A lie perpetuated by Marxist Democrats to create racial unrest. For God's sake, change the channel, you are censored.
And because John Lewis was Moral Giant while trump is an immoral little man.
Think abut the magnitude of that investigation.  All Democrat, Deep State Trump haters, using all the resources of the FBI, CIA &amp; DOJ, to find collusion with Russia, and nothing surfaced?. No politician in Washington could have withstood such scrutiny.
What exactly bothered you?  The only reason Barr is being trampled by this faux Judicial Comte, is that the 30 prior investigations against President Trump, failed!  12 Congressional investigations, 10 criminal investigations &amp; 8 state/local.  How many failed attempts at coup and

Watchdog alleges Trump campaign illegally concealed $170 million in spending
Under other presidents, Fauci gets medals, under trump he gets death threats
Unlike trump who misleads the public on every issue
With all the voter suppression, foreign hackers, etc. trump could lose the popular vote by 30 points and still win the election. Everybody must vote !
After all those people touched the flag on the casket, wishing an American hero goodbye, trump is probably scared he would get infected if he payed his last respects. Better to go golfing
He's not funny, neither are the rest of these Deep State Democrats. We are humiliated before the world.  Democrats make a mockery of our Judicial system.  We think Barr has done a great job!  We think President Trump has done a great job too.  Vote in person, don't trust mail!
Fauci gets medals from most presidents, under trump, he gets death threats
Trump is simply incapable of telling the truth. Full stop.
President Trump suggested that Twitter's trending topics are 'illegal' because they make him look...  via  what’s illegal is how donald trump has disrespected and disregarded the United States constitution
Donald Trump says he won't attend John Lewis' memorial services  via  donald trump isn’t worthy to a tend Mr John Lewis’s memorial services
Sounds like Rudy's given up trying to sell the Brooklyn Bridge and is trying to dump the millions of doses of this ineffective drug Trump has bought with our money!   --&gt; Can we investigate the spending of the Admin on this "project warp speed" - I bet some cronies did very well!
People have known who Trump is for many years - he's a cheat and a liar. Anyone who believed he could run a country was (and still is) lying to themselves. But we are all paying the price for his incompetence now.
These idiotic (and overtly political) attacks on Fauci should demonstrate to EVERY VOTER how ignorant, incompetent and murderous Trump is. HE DOESN'T CARE IF WE DIE - as long as his poll numbers improve. That's not a leader - it's a dangerous fool.
Dems get all of their schemes from their own playbook.  If they accuse Pres Trump of doing anything, you can bet they are speaking from party experience.  It's projection, it's camouflage and it's corrupt. No politician in Washington, could have withstood such scrutiny or attack.
trump's new tone is pretending to care and take the hidden virus seriously, even while his top scientific advisor keeps getting death threats
The East German military refusing to follow orders to attack and hurt demonstrators is what led to the fall of the Berlin Wall. Of course, trump's contractors in Portland are not military
And they did and said nothing. How shameful is Madam Speaker. Trump 2020
I will support the Lincoln project til the election, but they are still republicans. I do not agree politically with republicans at all, except for wanting tRump gone.
But after all the people touched the flag, wishing an American Hero goodbye, then if trump goes and pays his respects, he might get sick from the "hidden virus." Better to stay safe in his bunker
The founding fathers only succeeded in getting all the states to ratify the Declaration of Independence by saying "first things first" by postponing the question of slavery. With foreign hackers and voter suppression, trump will be hard to beat. We have to say first things first
That's almost as much as the 3 miles of wall that trump built on the southern boarder. And considering that a hurricane knocked a lot of the shoddy built wall down, the Whites House's wall is undoubtedly longer
How can other countries take trump seriously when he still refuses to take either the "hidden virus" or "the outcry demanding justice" seriously
In the same way our founding fathers thought, first things first, postponing the question of slavery in order to get unity for a Declaration of independence, we also have to get rip of trump first. It won't be easy, not with his voter suppression and foreign hackers
So are us blue staters.  Stay in your red state and enjoy the trump virus.
President Trump do you remember this statement you made in 2009?How do you know that the media is lying and not Trump?  Who made you the one who decides who’s right and wrong?
If Trump knows the Trump Corona Virus why don’t we have a national plan to combat it? Instead Trump abdicated his responsibility and passed it off to the states.
All Trump did was put Trump first.
Part of me feels like the bar dropped so far that we’re going to always hold the president in lesser regard because he/she isn’t Trump.
Just like trump. They deserve each other.
Nunes... Benedict Arnold..... trump same.
Republicans and Trump have to worry that most of its supporters won’t show up on             November /03/20   , because he keep insisting it will be rigged and much fraud in the election ! He wins by taking the GOP down with him ! Keep him saying such lies &amp; it will cost u big!
This needs to be said by all Republicans. Ads needs to play on this theme in all media forums. They need minority conservative groups to unite and be featured in ads. Trump won’t win with a twitter campaign by himself. He’s preaching to the choir.
No mask. No social distancing. No example for Trumpers. Didn’t Trump lose a friend to the Trump Corona Virus today and now he is endangering someone else?
The military will not follow his orders. Just swear Biden in, take the nuke suitcase away and govern at camp David. trump will find that an empty White House will become boring and he’ll eventually move out. The secret service for Biden can remove trump also.
I don't expect any different messages from the Trump haters.
Words. However most of the families that has a tragedy, will be at least 4 votes pulled away from trump
I may be delusional but come November the American people will decide. Would you like to make a wager with me if trump wins or loses?
Trumps administration has had no focus on anything. We just had the worst economic Qtr in history. We have the highest deficit in history. Trump has killed 151,000 from the Trump Corona Virus so far. Trump is by far the worst POTUS in history.
Trump couldn’t have upstaged that eulogy today if he called a press conference to announce he was resigning.
#America, you have endured many dark challenges and times of deep despair, without a doubt, TRUMP and his GOP enablers personify the most grotesque times in OUR history. When the sun rises past this moment, we need to take a LONG, HARD look at democracy. Yet, my flag flies high.
For every death from coronavirus and the people getting screwed on unemployment, the wrath of the American people shall fall onto trump and his republicans... so sayeth me.
And look how much the Republican Party has changed since Lincoln freed the slaves over a hundred years ago till now where Trump is a raging, fascist, racist moron and the rest of the Republican Party are in lock step.

Herman Cain thought it was a hoax too. He is dead today from Corona Virus he caught at the last Trump rally. You should go to a rally, catch the virus and die too.
No, they’re not. 95% of voters are confident with mail in voting. Trump knows in an honest election he will have a very embarrassing loss Nov 3.
trump wants for himself🤣🤣🤣
trump to follow
It turned into a cult like heavens gate. They will go down with trump without questioning his motives.
My chihuahua Ginger is all that and more. I think she could win against trump
Trump killed Cain at his rally. Cain died of the Trump Coronavirus he got by not wearing a mask and not using social distancing at the Trump rally.
If we are at the point where you seriously think that some states may stop electors, Trump has already broken our democracy.
I'm dying for Trump to die does that count? 😂😂😂
Wonder if Trump world will consider Herman Cain a martyr, who sacrificed his life to please his leader?
Trump is so afraid of being embarrassed in the coming election (landslide loss) he is already making up excuses and trying to find a way to cheat the election for himself.
Instead of asking  can we go to rural areas and ask Trump voters, if they like the idea of spending 20-30 dollars to send mail via fedex as opposed to cents with USPS.
Donald Trump never wanted to be President, he just wanted to WIN. Winning is all that mattered to him, not the responsibility of the job. Being a winner is all that is important to him. That is why he is so desperate now. He knows he is losing and that is inconceivable to him.

people are saying you saved the great american company Kodak and it’s great employees this will bring numerous jobs to american shout it out for America to hear Obama ain’t save Kodak trump did. Black people love Kodak too.
Trump you are the best president ever. Obama could saved the great american company Kodak and had the working on the vaccine too. He fought 3 diseases and didn’t think cuz he ain’t as smart as you. Tell the world how you saved such a great american company
I bet it will really piss Obama off today if Trump bragged about how he saved Kodak such a great American company.
And President Trump will not delay elections during this pandemic.

I would believe you if you can honestly answer these questions: 1- Is Trump fit to be president 2- Can Trump be trusted with national security and american soldiers’ kives 3- Were you right when you said Trump has learned his lesson 4- Do you believe DoJ is acting with integrity
An 1845 federal law placed the date of the election the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November. The president does not have the authority to change the date; see you at the pollls on November 3rd, Trump.
Herman Cain went to a Trump rally without wearing a mask. His death could have been prevented if he had listened to experts and not had followed blind  propaganda.
Every single day hundreds of Americans are dying of something that should have been contained months ago.  The blood is on Trump’s hands and he doesn’t care, anything to get re-elected.
and no, by absolutely no means am I simping for the Trump/Pence ticket
President Trump doesn’t have the authority to a delay an election and this fall’s election will happen as scheduled regardless of what conspiracy theories he tries to push.
Trump *wants* to delay the election.  Let's tell ALL OF HIS SUPPORTERS it IS delayed  And those of us who pay attention to the current laws will vote as scheduled, on November 3rd  Can the logic-minded collectively agree that this might work? 😉  #DumpTrumpDayNov3 #DumpTrump

So that’s why trump is trying to build a wall! Maybe he has alien DNA and doesn’t want anyone to know.
Because Trump only hires the very best idiots out there.  If he discovers that they are not idiots, he fires them.
Oh well. He’s following Heavens Gate prophet trump.

Donald Trump is literally trash and I sincerely hope we can collectively get our shit together to end this.
Strategy? Trump? Those 2 words just don’t go together. All Trump does is hide in his bunker and watch Fox.
Some of Trumps lies were finally filtered on social media so now Trump is whining like the big baby he is.
Trumps presidency has cost us 150,000 American lives plus raising the deficit to world record highs along with record unemployment. How could Biden possibly make it worse than Trump?

CNN is a joke. They still think the protestors in Portland are peaceful. They completely ignore the videos showing anarchists/domestic terrorists attacking our federal agents and courthouse. Trump is 100% correct that CNN provides fake news. Trash tabloid network. Fire Zucker!!!
Excellent  piece by a long-time GOP insider on how the party lost its way - and its soul - with the tacit understanding they could simply ignore calls for inclusiveness once  was elected:

Trump had a news conference and snarky reporters kept talking and he walked out.
I don’t have any idea what you people are talking about President Trump took action from the minute the virus was detected in the U.S You people are just regurgitating the Democrat’s talking points
us: please stop beating and killing poc with the authorities trump: *sends in more authorities to beat and kill poc*
It’s always about trump.
Did everyone notice Trump running out of the news conference like a complete coward when the questions got a little tough? I thought he was going to break out in tears.
Since when? Trump has done nothing but give it lip service.
I thought Trump said the Trump Virus would go away all by itself. Like magic. Why is it still here?
In order to achieve victory we must have a cohesive national plan. Trump has done nothing but abdicate his responsibility to state governors.
Trump is losing the right. And the left &amp; middle. He is even starting to lose the wack jobs.
Trump will post anything that agrees with him. Even very stupid stuff like alien DNA proponents like the wack job Doc mentioned. What POTUS in history ever said anything without checking to it?
Americans have them too. They are called tv evangelists. They will save you from the devil if you buy them a private jet. The new doctor... she is somewhere in the middle. Trump needs a doctor to move his agenda along and she will use his legion of loyal nitwits to make money.
Do you really that he is NOT! trump is an ENEMY COMBATANT potus in plain view...
The whole point of Jayapal’s questioning is that it’s clear that alt-right protesters and protesters that support Trump’s agenda too often get a pass while ones who speak against him or against oppressors are met with force.
This is why Trump didn’t want an accountability or oversight
I just realized that trump took over the heavens gate cult and this guy along with the NRC are it’s followers.

Seriously? Another report out today proves this drug is less than worthless for the Trump Corona Virus. Trump just wants to add to the 150,000 death toll he has run up.
Liberal privilege? How about being born into privilege? None of the current Trumps earned a dime. They all inherited it. Even our POTUS nearly lost it all needing to claim bankruptcy 5 times. Trump couldn’t even run a casino without bankrupting it. What a crappy business man.

You'll need pictures for Trump.... remember, he doesn't read much.
This is a damning portrait of the (lack of) federal government response to this threat. Some things are of large enough scope that only the US Gov. can address them -this was one, and Trump dropped the ball. Bigly. The election is a referendum on that failure.
These "stories" are only coming from Trump, so they can easily be dismissed as not credible.
This "joke" simply isn't funny. Maybe Russian bounties on US troops is also funny to Trump and Cornyn - they certainly don't seem to be taking it seriously!!
You’re right Joe Biden will try to get out of having any debate with Donald Trump. We the people want to have these debates move forward so we can make a choice based on what we hear

Numerous polling places have been eliminated making it more difficult to vote. At the same time trump is attempting to stop mail in voting during a pandemic while he himself (and his family) have voted by mail.

I find neither Trump nor Cornyn the least bit funny. They're shameful and embarrassing to our country.
"I assumed it was unthinkable."  Trump is going to do 100 more "unthinkable" things between now and January. Hopefully you now realize that we are dealing with an actual fascist, and you stop thinking that there is ANYTHING he will not do for power.
Trump is suppose to comfort our nation when he does his press conferences about the pandemic. He lies about it. He talks about how great he is. And he cry’s like a baby because Faci has a higher approval than him.
this is what happens when you consider your loyalty to trump more important than your own health. i would wish him peace, but i don't know what happen to trumpsters on the other side.

I totally hear that. I just have a hard time shaming marginalized folks for not having faith in a voting system that has hurt them in many ways. But I also agree trump is directly hurting people too. It’s really a tough situation
It had better specifically call Trump all the things that you said Biden was calling him.  I look forward to you applying to the President the phrases "disloyal wannabe dictator," "evil and intent on destroying America," "un-American," and "traitorous intent."
There is no changing the minds of Trump supporters or Q-idiots. Our only hope in winning is getting independents to step up and vote and for all democrats to vote. Our numbers are way larger, but we need to stay energized. I just like to mess with them.

I'm just saying if mental lucidity is the criterion, Trump has no claim to it either. It's Spiderman pointing at Spiderman. Will I be way more concerned about his VP choice than I was about Hillary's or Obama's? You bet.
Yes they are the same thing. Absentee is for people who might serve oversees or be otherwise unavailable whereas mail in is more convenience. Either way they use the same thing. Trump mailed in his vote for the Florida primaries this year
I agree with the racist part, not idiot. *45, &amp; every minion he put in place know very well what they're doing, how to do it &amp; how to get away with it. And, it's working. "Pausing" the election, abolishing the post office. Covid-19 was a gift to trump, great distraction.
Delighting in someone’s death is gross. Sorry, but it’s gross. And calling that out is also appropriate. I don’t want to be like these rabid, frothy-mouthed, morally bankrupt minions for Trump.
Trump told a reporter in a 1:1 meeting that he just bombed Iraq. It was Syria. The reporter had to correct him. They might be on equal footing in a debate.
It's really shocking just how despicable and desperate the GOP has become. Why don't they get serious about their responsibilities? Free and fair elections. Extending supplemental unemployment insurance. Mandate masks EVERYWHERE Denouncing Trump as he lies his way to November.

We seem to forget that Trump is a few cards short of a deck. Biden could win a debate by staying on script while Trump goes off about how he's the stablest of geniuses and fittest and the best doctor and best truck driver and whatever he invents for the day.
This is some good news. It would be nice if he would address Trump, and let him know that he has ZERO authority to change the election date.
The lifeboats aren't available as long as the overriding philosophy of the Republican rank-and-file is "Donald Trump is an infallible omnipotent god-king who rules by divine right and must never be questioned."
Biden's team has wisely positioned Joe as the "Not Trump" candidate and done its level best to keep him out of the spotlight and put all of the attention on Trump.   With a big lead, there's not much incentive for Biden to agree to a debate: all risk, no reward.
Quit comparing. Trump is responsible for not only Cain’s death but for 150,000 Americans.

President Trump floats delaying the presidential election, citing his own prediction of fraudulent voting. Can he do this? #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica
only took these mfs 4 years of trump to figure out the right tone for the moment
Time for a new revolution.
Trump may be keeping America sick so that it makes voting set- up more difficult for states to enact. Causing chaos, leaves state voting administrators in the dark, thus wasting their time when they should be organizing for mail in ballots , etc.
Trump: Let me float this out there...  People: THAT IS AN ABOMINATION!  Trump Supporters: Kidding! Kidding! See the question mark? He's such a kidder, that super stable genius of ours.   Trump, in interview: No, I'm not kidding. I don't kid.
That's because Trump is a callous old man who can't do the right thing seemingly ever.
I think a number of people saw this coming.... but scarily, Trump is still floating the idea. Too bad (for him) it won't happen.
Any vote against Trump is likely fraudulent, at least in his mind.
This is simply Trump's desperation in full view. It would be nice if someone in his Administration would let him know the date can't be moved.
On January 20 Trump’s term ends.. If for some reason we did not have an election Pelosi becomes president.. We have a constitution.. The only question is will the military follow the commander in chief or some rogue branch of the government
Fun Fact: Joe Biden appeared in several debates for the Democratic Primary. This year. Was he 'great'? No. But is Trump good at debates? LOL, no. Trump would have to answer questions on everything he's done wrong and LOL it's a really long list.
You do realize that there are millions of American who are NOT protesting in person who still would benefit from a mail-in ballot.   No, of course you don’t. Your profile says you’re a “School Safety Advocate” AND you’re on Team Trump. Classic example of an oxymoron.
Oh hell no...  Trump suggests delaying November U.S. presidential election
Why does trump keep pushing disproved drugs as an antidote for Covid?  Easy. Either he or his kids have stock, lots of stock, in the company.  or  He forgot that he's done this already and can't think of anything else to say.
How about Trump shuts up and does HIS job? Thousands of people dying each day. Trump does nothing. We need more testing. Trump does nothing. Solders being murdered by Taliban via Russia. Trump does nothing. Lost livelihoods? Nothing. Funds for the wealthy? Trump is all in.
The CRAZY thing about Trump saying we should delay the election is the US GDP fell by 32.9% in the 2nd quarter. The largest recorded drop in history.   More than 1.43M people filed for unemployment benefits for the 1st time last week, rising for a 2nd week.
Trump us districting from the worst US GDP drop in history. He can't delay the election.

I DON’T CARE. I don’t care if they are woman, man or frog. I don’t care if they are alive or dead. I don’t care what race, how old, if they like Disney. I don’t care if they were a prosecutor or an undertaker or a clock watcher.   As long as they aren’t Trump, Pence or GOP.

The Trump Pandemic has now killed  153,708 Americans. #FailedPresident #TrumpVirus
As bad as trump has been with  coronavirus 45 deaths per 100k residents chicago has 111 people shot per 100k and on pace for 25 dead per 100k residents.  There is no vaccine.  Try everything to get it under control.  Read the book Ghettoside.  We are all wishing you success
NO!! Trump announced troop withdrawal from Germany today.
NO!!!! Trump announced troop withdrawal from Germany/NATO today.

And Trump is giving him a reduced NATO today:
Yeah, Trump learned his lesson when the Supreme Court ruled against his DACA executive order
The "fake news" reports (which the Attorney General agreed with yesterday) is that there is no credible evidence of vote-by-mail fraud.  Except by members of the Trump Administration who use old addresses!!
WATCH NATO -- TRUMP IS NOT JUST MAKING US WEAK AT HOME, HE IS DESTABILIZING THE WORLD.
I've gotta say, while I'm not sold on Rice, I'd love to see Republicans start to go back to screaming bloody murder about four (very sad) fatalities as the Trump Death Count heads past 200,000 into November and they assure us that's in fact a Very Good Job.

This was totally expected when Trump nominated an inexperienced donor pal for Postmaster General - this is the kind of shill that will follow orders and trash not just the election, but the USPS overall, which many people really depend on.
I don’t see how any serviceman or servicewoman or veteran could vote for trump now.
That describes my dream, but Trump's worst nightmare!
Finally Twitter stepped on the worse callus of Trump junior. Maybe now FB, Google and Twitter will be stripped from their monopoly - feeding users with PROPAGANDA
#TrumpTraitor Putin’s number one goal has always been to get the USA out of NATO. Trump is #PutinsPuppet
The White House/GOP SHOULD be worried about this - we've seen them fail at every turn in this pandemic. The country needs help, not lies and other nonsense from Trump and his crew. DO THE WORK OF GOVERNANCE!!!
Trump Isn’t Serious About Russia. But Neither Is Biden. - Noah Rothman, Commentary Magazine
So Trump still hasn't offered any sort of "vision" or plan for his second term. It's great that he can verbally trash the Green New Deal - but where is any Republican deal of any kind? Especially on health care - his 2 weeks to unveil his plan is almost up!! (It was another lie!)
The never trump placement was nice
This is the most racist tweet  has written in a long, long time. The racial undertones are deafening.  I’ll deconstruct the tweet.   Don’t worry white people, trump won’t allow blacks to move into your neighborhoods.   #TrumpsAmerikkka  #TrumpIsARacist  #TrumpLies
This just seems like some baised individuals are just trying to create division. Keep this crap up and trump will get another 4 years!
At about age 1, babies learn object permanence. I.e., something still exists even when you can't see it. Just like with the covid testing, Trump evidently believes that if we can't see low income people, they simply disappear. Like if we don't test for covid we won't have cases.
I think he lost me at his second "Trump's America."
This is infuriatingly stupid “ThEy LoOk LiKe TrUmP aNd KaNyE”
Does it even matter anymore whether or not we catch him in a lie? Or in hypocrisy. Or in a corrupt act? As a nation we have to hold our breath that Trump loses badly and we get White House back to patriots.
The Coronavirus doesn’t care if you are Senate Leader and Trump is President but America does. Quit your divisiveness and fight for us. We are dying, we have no jobs; soon we will go hungry and you don’t see us.
Because Trump is a small, petty man. Period.
Good idea! All ready have the  logo like the one in my pinned tweet. Know where I can a TRUMP 2020 from?
Watching TV IS Trump's version of "working".
Trump is simply a short-sighted fool. The world, especially Putoin and Xi, are playing chess, with strategic plans. Trump can't even understand the rules of their game, so he tries to play checkers, and even fails at that.
Look to the City of South Milwaukee when results come in. Clinton won it only by a point as it swung against her compared to Obama's 2012 margin and Evers only won by 2. Biden would like to get a 5 point win or better, while Trump would love to pull out a win here. 6/6
This is a region were Biden will want to continue to build on Clinton's 11 point lead here and get closer to Senator Baldwin's win of 15 points, while Trump would love to get close to only losing by around Walker's 7 point margin. 5/6
Comparing the two elections one can see that Walker did do better than Trump did in many of these municipalities. I would argue this is due to a positive home region effect for Walker and a dislike of Trump. Evers did do better in many of the blue-collar communities. 4/6
Amazing what happens when you send a completely unqualified &amp; paranoid jackass as your Ambassador   Also, Trump’s obsequiousness towards Putin is really paying off
“covid will be over in november. it only exists to prevent trump’s reelection”  how do you cope with your parents terrible politics? i don’t wanna cut them out because i love them, but they are so hateful and bigoted without even realizing it.
my parents talk politics with me every time we’re together and they refuse to hear me out. it’s always “antifa is financially supported by george soros” “trump is an asshole but he gets shit done” “black employment went down more under him than obama”
Uh oh. Trump is using his “dog whistle” again.
trump isn’t this smart. But hes got enough truly evil people working for him
I can only speculate it is done to fill the coffers of some Trump crony or family member in one way or another. when will we ever get to the bottom of this pile of horseshit corruption and grift?
I hold the RNC and the rest of the GOP more responsible than Trump. 1000% more. Because I would presume that at least SOME of them are sane. Trump I believe has lost it to dementia and possibly syphilis-related mental illness. But for the rest of them there is no excuse.
sure, Louie. Just double down on your stupidity. That will be in character. You had an opportunity to really help and save the lives of your constituents, or simply kiss Trump's ass instead and spread lies and misinformation. You chose B. Nice knowing you

It disgusts me that Trump would support a drug that has no benefit to Corona patients but is needed for Lupus etc. He could cause supplies for those who need it to be unavailable. I wish he'd shut up.
Trump and his posse are complicit in 150,000+ deaths of Americans. There will be many more.This admin. Really doesn't care. And then there’s job loss...
Trump has a type. He likes Kushner and Swan.  He trusts them in a weird way.
Nothing but race-baiting from Trump.  It will not keep him in office!
It was his employees who outed Trump’s racist policies. You can’t just make sh*t up &amp; try to pass it off as fact. You are fervently defending a racist, predatory, misogynistic moron who doesn’t care about you but desperately wants to win to avoid prosecution. #MoronInChief
Looks like you and trump do not learn any lessons, your time is up, step aside Stooge.
Trump is ruining our country and you yahoos don't give a damn. Fixed it for you.
Trump will be in the White House attic tonight looking to see if any of those uniforms are left!
1. Listen, I know you think he is the last great man, but Trump is an individual and not a group parents may belong to.  2. If a teacher at your school is public posting “Conservatives Suck” they should be reported, don’t just complain about it in your bubble. Take a screenshot
Joe, you know the history and heart of this country and I know a political platitude when I see one. You’re full of crap, just like Trump.
saying at least half the parents at the school go him in trouble, not saying Trump was President.   I would have been fired when I was a teacher if I said “Man Conservatives Suck” in a public forum, because the parents would demand it.
How does the Trump Admin get away with stating they are not accepting DACA applications after the Supreme Court decision directing them to continue the program???
I think Trump likes that doctor because he's found his intellectual equal.
I guess he thought praising Trump provided some sort of immunity.... oops.
Sorry, but Trump is simply an idiot. Incapable of seeing anything in terms OTHER than $$$$. It's all he cares about - and he's very wrong in this case, those troops and the American facilities in Germany are critical!
This is the logic of a 3rd grader.... "did the Taliban pay bounties??" --&gt; answer: "yes, but..."  Trump does not have the GUTS to confront Putin on this - plain and simple.
This Administration is a complete train wreck. Misinformation, lying, tweeting idiot doctors who believe in demons and aliens, "needing" a new FBI building to protect their hotel from competition, and now going after social networks that have hurt Trump's feelings and covid mess.

TRUMP (A TRUE REPUBLICAN) IS RAPING THE USA BY ALLOWING CORRUPT CORPORATIONS AND BUSINESSES TO RUN FREE.
I think there are a lot of signs (and hopefully it’s not wishful thinking on my part) that people in all levels of this country are just done with Trump’s shit.
Trump Wants to Postpone the Election  Once again, Trump made a complete fool out of himself. Tweeting an idea before vetting it. Not even Republicans could defend it.
Trump Wants to Postpone the Election  Ted Cruz (R., Texas) and Lindsey Graham (R., S.C.) openly disagreed.   This is a Trump blame game for when he loses.
Jeanne Ives is a dishonest “politician” who gaslights and distracts voters with lies and misinformation. She wants you to believe that she’s moderate, when in reality she is a right wing extremist with hideous views around race and sexuality. She is a power hungry Trump puppet
polls are fake but interesting!
Here, listen to Trump himself admit he's working for Putin. It's not sad, but stupid and treacherous for any American to deny Trump is working for Putin and instead push Trump's "Deep State Conspiracy" that accepts Putin's word and seeks to discredit US Intelligence work product.

#HermanCain at rally at which Trump had campaign staff REMOVE stickers already placed on seats by the convention center so people wouldn't sit right next to each other. Trump wanted everyone PACKED together for cameras and didn't want anyone wearing masks.
I'll bet some how Trump runs this company and is scamming the fed. gov. for billions.
There is no bottom to Trump betrayal of America. For Putin, and here for Putin and himself.
Trump said that voting by mail will be the most inaccurate and fraudulent election and it will be a great embarrassment to the USA. It is a lot more embarrassing the way he has managed the pandemic making the USA the country with more cases and deaths around the world.

Please explain this Biden corruption. He never said any such thing. It’s been proven and it’s what Trump was impeached for was trying to dig up dirt on Biden. Go back to watching Fox trying to push HDQ and “Dr.” Immanuel on you.
He is just about the last person I would try to emulate. Have a great night. Will put you down as a hard no on a Trump vote. Can’t win them all.

Joe agree with you. This is Trump..
This is the very thing the Soviets did in the old days.  Unfortunately, we don’t educate Americans in good civics.  Remember Trump has been a East European Fan for 40 years. He has picked his tactics from the Soviets, now Russians, Hungarians and Bulgarians....
Suggest reading Mary Trump's book. Even though Trump shows us who he is every day and there are few surprises, it's informative to hear from an insider who lived in that dysfunctional family.
How about lets get rid of the biggest crook here in the U.S. "Donald Trump" More people have died on his watch because of his bullcrap and lies than anyone else thats held office.
Just another way for the Trump Admin. to damage this country and screw over the people.
Brazen.  Trump believes in segregation. What a White RACIST...
How can we blame President Trump for this?
Absolutely voting for Trump.
You keep falsely accusing me of hatred when you started this by deriding me for my tweet &amp; video about the wrongness of Trump's hatred, contrasted w/Christ's words: Love your enemy. You said you don't care if he hates people or goes to hell. Please review your thought process.

What are you even talking about?  Man, look at the arrests, look up the arrest records if you think city rioting is some Trump Supporter inspired conspiracy.   Lay off the sauce Nancy
It has to do with Trump's treasonous service to Putin. Here's the most telling 55 seconds of   interview with Trump. Trump feigns ignorance about Russia arming Taliban, asking a playing-dumb question of his interviewer &amp; saying it never came to his desk.
You think it even truly matters who you vote for. And if you do you’re mistaken. Trump became president without the popular vote. Let’s not get into that. This will only stray way to far away from the main points here
Not voting for trump or Biden. Why is this coming to politics 😂😂😂 this is the farthest thing from that
Covid-19 was designed to take down trump  Its all fake.  Trump needs to win or our country is doomed due to all the corruption

Here's the most telling 55 second excerpt from   interview with Trump. Trump lies &amp; feigns ignorance on what is well known &amp; undisputed: Russia's arms supply to the Taliban. Trump also says "we did it too" as part of his excuse for not caring. #TraitorTrump

He’s afraid of Putin... He either wants something personal... Or Putin has something on him... Trump does nothing unless it helps him personally...
Not an error, but a betrayal, an intentional gift to Putin. Trump is #gaslighting everyone. Even people who KNOW he is gaslighting us STILL cooperate with gaslighting by subduing their own responses.  interview is just the most recent proof Trump works for Putin!
I've isolated this 55 seconds from Trump's larger attempt at confusing everything. This clearly &amp; concisely displays what  astutely recognized as the most grave: Trump's LIE, feigning ignorance, "it never reached my desk" Russia is arming Taliban, &amp; "we did it too".

You not only never intelligently thought about my video, which you keep deriding, but you fail to see for several back-and-forth's I've been rebutting you on entirely different grounds: When you claim Trump's character doesn't matter, you've given up any basis for attacking mine.
The fact you thought you had to add a question mark shows #Gaslighting's effect even on people who've KNOWN ALL ALONG that Trump is #Gaslighting us. Same reason news people repeat Groundhog Day, feeling obligated to introduce what Trump is ABOUT to say as though he MIGHT not lie.
Wow....So the doctor Trump retweet it and Giuliani held up as definitive proof that hydroxy worked also believes in Astral pregnancies?  Lol, sure you can trust her.... you really can’t make this shit up 😂🤣😂
We're past the point where anyone with high security clearance KNOWS Trump is betraying USA to Putin, as it's obvious to us on the outside. We have reports of what he is briefed on. They SEE what he is briefed on &amp; brief him themselves. If they ignore this, THEY are traitors too.
LOL as if anyone believes Trump reads
Trump's answer was long-winded way of saying, "I'm actively &amp; knowingly betraying our country to Russia." Being long-winded is part of the design, to spread out &amp; dilute minimally relevant snippets in his answer with  irrelevant garbage. He needs to be asked repeatedly &amp; pressed.
You don't even listen to yourself, or you'd see it is logically incoherent nonsense. Your thinking isn't internally consistent, invalidating itself. You RELENTLESSLY attack me for "hatred" &amp; "hard heart" for rejecting your bogus assertion that TRUMP's hatred is IRRELEVANT.
You're speaking nonsense that is antithetical to God. All I did was share a video with Trump's OWN words. From that point you have relentlessly lauded Trump &amp;  falsely attacked ME on the same basis that you say means NOTHING when it's Trump -- ie, hatred.  "Who cares?", you said.
You falsely praise Trump as a promoter of Christian values &amp; attack me as "hateful" &amp; "spewing bile" for bringing you Trump SAYING he loves "getting even", "getting revenge", an "eye-for-an-eye". He even gave an example: "destroying" a man for merely hesitating in a petty matter.
You're a brazen liar, falsely accusing me of hatred so you can cravenly &amp; scurrilously deny what is undeniable in the two-part video &amp; in the supporting documentation I presented. In the video you apparently never watched, Trump DEFINED his life by his DELIGHT in hateful revenge.
Janet Parshall ( blocked me for the video of Trump saying the Bible verse that most defined his life was "eye-for-an-eye". It's really scary and sick the way prominent Christians are promoting someone as evil as Trump &amp; excommunicate anyone who brings truth to them.
tRump runs.
Trump even went out of his way to say emphatically that he didn't need Fauci and could have put someone else in his role, implying that Fauci owed his "popularity" to Trump giving him his role -- that Fauci was a fungible commodity, expendable, replaceable.
Trump is an evil sociopath without a functional human conscience. This is one of the reasons he is able to brazenly lie in a continuous stream without showing physical indications normal people show. You obviously didn't even watch the videos of him or read anything. Here's more.
I can’t believe they were so indignant and would not allow AG Barr to answer their questions. They came off as a bunch of clowns trying to outdo each other ! November 3 is the most critical day of our lives !! Trump ‘20 clean sweep

TRUMP says Trump is a Christian -- falsely. Further, "Nobody reads the Bible more than me", lied Trump, though the ONLY verse he knows is his SELF-DESCRIBED life's verse: eye-for-an-eye. Church Leaders laud Trump as WONDERFUL. I'M not limiting God. God WILL use the/an Antichrist.
Unfollowing you, after yrs. Trump is antichrist-LIKE, 5 ways: Comes in his OWN name. Brazenly evil, antithesis of godliness, personally &amp; as #POTUS. Lies continuously: Huge, obvious lies w/o conscience. Eye-for-an-eye=life's verse. IDOLIZED by "the elect".
I am just happy about more Trump signs. Can never have enough of those babies!
Form of questions AND answers is crucial: 1. NOT about ANY opinions. Barr could make up anything he wants. 2. Concerning ONLY facts of a kind that can either be reliably corroborated OR proven to be lies by future testimony &amp; documentation -- whether soon or after Trump leaves.
People who worship politicians like religious figures, regardless of their place in the political spectrum, really freak me the fuck out. It's really common with Trump but like you see it with Bernie and Hillary a little too. Like I love AOC but you don't see me with an altar.
And arrest these mayors and governors for failing to protect the people, they are just as bad as the anarchists.  They should be arrested for criminal actions and Mr. Trump make an example soon.  We cannot wait for action any longer before others start to apply the law!!
Are you insane? It does not work. Trump bought a huge stockpile of HDQ, is now stuck with it and is now trying to pedal it to numbskulls like you. The classic snake oil salesmen. You probably would’ve fallen for that too.
Boy you weren’t kidding… I got less texts and emails when I signed up for one beach bodies video then I am getting now. 17 emails yesterday alone from the Trump campaign or groups supporting his campaign… Not to mention the texts.  It’s like I’m on the list from hell.
The #GOP has a far deeper problem -- its PEOPLE. When Trump STARTED his campaign portraying US. POWs as losers for getting captured &amp; tortured, that should have been the end of him. Instead, to CHEERS, it established him as the man who could say &amp; do ANYTHING &amp; get away with it.
People tuned in to hear what Fauci said about the pandemic, not Trump. I can't even imagine the meltdown that would create for a narcissist like Trump
The only person Biden could pick that would give me pause would be a Trump.
I sure hope people really start to wake up.  38% still holding that TRUMP is a real business man. How??

Trump's announcing he was going to throw a pitch at Yankees Stadium on Aug. 15 without giving a "heads up" to the Yankees is like announcing he was going to be the best man at a couple's wedding without giving a "heads up" to the bride &amp; groom. Ridiculous on more than one level.
The most "ardent apologists" for Trump NEVER bother to explain Trump seriously. They just skip over whatever they need to, and easily can because of the flood of lies and wrongdoing Trump engages in every day, each lie and act quickly pushing prior ones out of the news cycle.

You've been at home for what 4 months, walked around China town telling people go out, pushing welfare on people, not condemning the violence. Face it Pelosi you're the problem &amp; your party of misfits. President Trump has done a great job and its time for you to go #PelosiMustGo
Trump is doing his best Fabio impression. Yes, his utter best.
So would wearing a mask, and Trump politicised that.  Didnt hydroxychloroquine fail to produce substantial efficacy results in FDA testing?
I didn’t expect Ronald Reagan’s Foundation to tell Trump’s campaign to get his name out of their damn mouths. Especially not 100 days before the election.  Reminder: Reagan’s policy was Republicans should never criticize fellow Republicans.
AFFH / Stanley Kurtz / Wow, what an education on tonight’s show ! It’s imparative Trump gets a second term! Expose Biden’s Agenda !! Great Show !! We must prevent this take over of the suburbs!
True, it was just a vindictive act, just like Trump having #MichaelCohen thrown in jail for refusing to agree not to talk to media or publish a book. In this case, casually pepper spraying this Vietnam vet as these criminal goons walked by was cruel *battery* to say "SHUT UP!!!"
And that doesn't even account for all the deaths caused by his policies the first 3 years of his presidency.  Trump is so much worse than 9/11 that it's almost insulting to 9/11 to compare the two.
Yea maybe he'll show trump his pics he sent to that girl a few years ago....
Why haven’t you publicly called out the Trump administration for their hypocritical and unethical handling of Chinese “diplomacy” then?
What?  What planet are on you on?  Ask the over 4m people in this country. The Demócrats are working for the people.  TRUMP is working for himself at your expense..
Yeah. Not a good move by Mnuchin. He it an idiot along with the other Trump enablers...
You might say Trump is their golden calf, or more like their bronzed ass.
Two hit pieces against President Trump in less than one hour. I guess Biden never needs to leave his basement since CBS and the other usual suspects are doing his politicking for him. This is garbage.
Trump doesn't just lie. Trump lies all the time -- stupidly obvious lies. Which obviously makes anyone who continues to believe anything he says more stupid than he is. Or, un-self-aware of something in their psychology that he plays on to captivate and deceive them every day.
You mean Trump signs his name in Russian?
Just like your hero, draft-dodging #TraitorTrump, you &amp; K don't give a damn what is true. I registered for the draft and, unlike Bone Spurs Trump, I would have gone if called. Here's an example of the HEROES Trump denigrated &amp; you denigrate with your lies.
Criminals that have loud music at 5:00PM on a Saturday should have Trump’s secret police called on them.
Let me get this straight. Trump knew about Epstein's island of underage sex trafficking, and did nothing.  Yet investigates Joe Biden's spn's business dealings on a hunch.
#TrumpMeltdown #EpsteinIsland  Let me get this straight. Trump knew about Epstein's island of underage sex trafficking, and did nothing.  Yet investigates Joe Biden's son's business dealings.  #JoeBiden #GhislaineMaxwell
Cheap and consumed by grievance and entitlement (per Mary Trump's book which I am reading now).
Thank you for serving our country.   You did the right thing by obeying the law and answering your subpoena to appear before Congress and you told the truth.  Trump and his cronies are destroying our democracy and I’m sorry that you were treated with disrespect.
thinks President Trump is a white supremacist. I asked her to provide evidence as everyone should when someone makes such a statement. She blocked me. I hope she’s more prepared when someone else asks her to back her opinion with FACT.
They aren’t wasting their votes if they want Trump to be in office for another 4 years.
Tiffany Cross is fantastic. She made mince meat of black rep Trump supporter. Mr. Bevelle was exposed for the fool he is!
Trump is an anti-Christ pretending to be a Christian. Here he is in this video telling us why "eye-for-an-eye" is the verse that defines his life. If you look at the reply chain, you'll see that "eye-for-an-eye" is literally the only Bible verse he knows.
Pro-Trump veterans need to realize he has redirected their affections &amp; turned them into traitors to other vets, active-duty &amp; America. To support Trump is to support: Animosity for POWs. Putin/Russia v USA/NATO: Bounties on US soldiers &amp; much more. Confederate treason=patriotic
Who cares what HIS CHOICE IS why is it if they dont agree with u its a bad smh.  Everyones entitled 2 thier own opinion wether u like it or not trump has done good stuff get off the bandwagon of hate n just enjoy the season of all stars please.  Not everything needs 2b political
Yet Trumps continues to use this little twerp Fauci SO disappointed in Trump. He stared off great shutting off travel from China when we didn’t know what this covid19 was about but has completely caved to the left since then-smhThe skinniest guy at the gym right now is wearing a Trump 2020 hat. Maybe not the best decision? You may say: “It’s 2020, we aren’t savages nobody will take exception to it.” I say, yeah it’s 2020 have you watched the news at all this year?
Zirconia and polyester, the trump kids,  weird Dr. with the Alien DNA, and Dr. Ronnie Jackson....
Trump lost the suburban moms..  Your facts are wrong...I don’t want schools reopened!!
Last time I checked, blacks voting for Trump doesn’t scientifically mean they’re not black.
Also funny is trump is suing PA to not allow drop off ballot boxes!  He wants them thru his slow boat to China post office!
Mexico will be putting up a wall to keep the Trump Virus out.
This is great. Out of 30,000, 97% VOTED for President Trump.  I have a wish. Let's reelect this great president.
How do you tweet from jail? Oh yeah trump let you out. More "law &amp; order " I guess. You dance with the devil..................
That's great. Any national plan for the pandemic raging across America yet? Any plans to stop Russia from killing our soldiers?  What was that about a wall again?  Is it to help Mexico keep out Americans because we have no leader and they don't want trump virus? FAILURE
#America, you have endured many dark challenges and times of deep despair, without a doubt, TRUMP and his GOP enablers personify the most grotesque times in OUR history. When the sun rises past this moment, we need to take a LONG, HARD look at democracy. Yet, my flag flies high.
Yet here is proof that Oklahoma was directly effected from this super spreader event. This isn't assumptions. These are facts:
You've murdered  As well as many others who attended. #SuperSpreaderTrump
6,000 showed up and amoung the crowd?  now dead as well as thousands infected. Thanks #SuperSpreaderTrump and thanks to the #DemonSperm
Trump is too far gone to correct him
This is  without a mask indoors during a global pandemic where six members of the Trump advance team all tested positive for Covid19 as well as members of the general public. Oklahoma had a massive surge in cases because of this event.
You miss spoke. You called the virus by the wrong name. Its pronounced the trump virus. Don't worry its just the dementia acting up again.  Person  Man Woman  Camera  Idiot
Except that's the entire point of the question YOU asked. The event was inside. Trump's first rally during the pandemic. Inside a venue in Tulsa.  Here is  inside with no mask on. What else do you want to hear? That the #GOPDemonSperm that  spokeabt?
Lol really  you wanna go there? How about if your boy Donald Trump was born Donald nobody what would he be doing today? I’ve lost complete respect for you during this pandemic and your love affair with trump. He’s a sexual predator and a egotistical maniac!!
Trump is a Russian puppet
Kiss asses butter trump up....
Word up: You don’t gain any “points” for using a man’s passing as fame fodder. You claim Trump has no class? Look in a damn mirror!
On the way home I saw someone with Trump signs saying things like Trump country Trump 2020 I swear everytime I see those signs I get pissed off? Do you get pissed when you see any Trump signs
Willing to die to keep Trump happy!
Exactly. And the fact these guys are being duped by this complete fraud makes me wonder what kind of education they received at my alma mater. Basically all that remains of the Trump base are non-college whites... and apparently all the white kids who played football at MSU.
Trump’s failure
#TrumpVirus - Extremely ironic - the good men like Lewis who inspired Obama to lead were the positive change agents that  were the catalyst of the uprising of the loud white lions and the pilfered election for trump by 1.5M cancelled / suppressed votes in MI. #BLM #2020Elections
Trump says it is safe to open schools but now it is not safe to hold an election
Trump has broken the law before but Trump can't delay the election DO NOT fall for it lets keep the topic somewhere else okay. Let's talk about Lewis's funeral or Herman's death topics like that.
Great idea to hold a rally during a pandemic! Should weed out some more Trump voters
Herman Cain dies of Covid19 after being in the hospital for over a month after attending Trump's rally. Trump's rallies are a Covid19 breeding ground period.
Everything trump touches turns to shit...
I believe trump is trying to distract from the truth about the abysmal GDP ...but I also believe it’s no joke!!
So where the evidence of this? THAT TRUMP HAD THEM MOVED? Easy to say but prove it!!!!!! I’ll wait
Donald Trump just stood in the middle of 5th Avenue and shot somebody.  Is anyone going to say anything?  Show me that Herman Cain was infected prior to Tulsa and I’ll retract that statement.  Otherwise all available evidence points to an infection at Trump’s Tulsa rally.
I urge everyone to read the  book “Hiding in Plain Sight” to know how pernicious the corruption of the Trump administration is. #TrumpThreatensAmerica
Trump is directly responsible for his death
The official cause of death is the Trump Rally in Tulsa
Is there anything stopping #Trump from buying his reelection?  WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump says he wants the next coronavirus relief package to be "very generous" with direct stimulus payments to Americans that are potentially more than $1,200.
Don’t forget Herman Cain contracted COVID from the  Tulsa Rally!!  So trump is responsible ....
Rest in covid Herman. You decided to ignore public health warnings. Donald trump is the reason you are dead.
It’s a shame you don’t demand info from trump with the same exuberance.  Like why haven’t you confronted Putin about the bounties on American soldiers?  Why are we pulling American troops out of Germany so Putin has a stronghold??  Interesting ....
The GOP had a plan to fight the tRUMP virus? Bullshit. You and the rest of the GOP have been very publicly downplaying it the whole time. Refusing to wear a mask calling it a hoax calling it fake news. Attacking our top medical advisors and now its the Dems fault. Blow me
Anything to delay his move out date  CNN: Trump floats delaying election despite lack of authority to do so.   via
Trump's tweet about raising the possibility of delaying the election is nothing but a distraction he can't delay the election by executive order. Congress decides when elections are not a sitting president
Trump Floats Delaying The Election. It Would Require A Change In Law
#WallStreet and some of the base dead-enders are about the only support #Trump has left. So now he wants to postpone the election. He has also put up barricades around the White House to fortify his encampment and make it more difficult to root him out in less then 100 days.
This has been talked about for months... Biden accused him of this months ago.  There are no provisions to delay ...so we shouldn’t expect anything less from Comrad Trump.
Illinois.  We need Trump and Police!
Trump received $10 Million to relocate the Embassy from Israel to Jerusalem from Sheldon &amp; Miriam Adelson, as a condition/campaign promise...but glad he's ALLOWING WOMEN TO SPEAK, not typically a Trump move, wonder how much that cost.
Sometimes I ask myself, how much damage Trump &amp; co plan to incflict upon us in Nov-Dec-Jan?
Can you hear with your nose that far up TRUMP’s ASS Laura?
If Trump says schools are safe then he should personally visit schools and prove it.
Joe Biden for President 2020. In my opinion, Trump's all ready lost. He is losing big time in the general election. Trump needs to resign.
A grand jury in NY may have indicted Trump but chose to keep it sealed atm and if Trump loses the indictment gets unsealed
Biden for President 2020. Let's see who will win in November. Trump's all ready lost based on how he's handled everything recently. Trump is currently losing in the general election. Deal with that.
Of you support him I want nothing to do with you. I blocked a fiend I've had for 20 years and will not talk to him as he supports trump.  The man doesn't even know why he wants a 2nd term. When asked he broke into some crazy story about his first day as president. He has no idea
To vent needed a place to unleash all the anger  I felt for Trump and the GOP since my friends outside of Twitter wouldn't talk about it as much or seem uninterested in the topic and it worried me
It won’t be needed ...when Biden takes over, he won’t need that and all the other useless spending trump and his wife in name only want!   We are in the middle of an economic crisis and this jackass is trying to cash grab on his way out!
Can we please keep RBG in a bubble til January 20th 2021 I do not want her to retire and I don't want her seat to be stolen by Trump and the Trump party. We will impeach Brett Kavanagh and Neil Gorsuch along with every nominee he's ever appointed and we will be successful
Thank you govenor states like Florida are to blame for uptick in cases along with Trump not taking Covid19 seriously. Also Ron Desantis failed to take the virus seriously he is the worst govenor in the country
#NobodyLikesTrump is trending once again and I tend to help keep it trending since it hurts Trump's feelings
When Trump beat Hillary all their minds exploded!  They’re still trying to figure out what happened!  We know they never will. But they don’t know that.🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
Because she agrees with Trump!
How many months have the GOP and tRUMP just hoped this virus would go away without a plan of any kind? 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. Has America's biggest enemy living in it.
Exactly the way they attempted to orchestrate an impeachment of Trump.
I would not worry about NATO. A President Biden will undo the harm. In February 2021, we need a full investigation into the Trump/Putin disaster. Thanks Anthony for standing up to Trump. Maybe you can help rebuild the Republican party.
Trump Touts ‘Suburban Lifestyle Dream’ After Rescinding Obama-Era Rule Preventing Housing Discrimination
It's July 29th and Trump still hasn't resigned yet.
Mary Trump to be on the #ReidOut shortly be prepared and Joy is keeping the bounty story alive after 1 month it happened
What’s with washed up old men who find it necessary to to expose their crazy on behalf of trump??
Mmmmmm you blame this on a party. Well if you do, then it would have to be the Republicans because they have been in charge (Senate and WH) since trump. So you are blaming losers WOW.
I want Trump to go so I can get back to regular tv programming. No offense  but...
Because trump said so...
Is that the code word for the trump kids??
Please consult the lizard people and the demons that rape you and give you their demon seed like the woman trump just retweeted.
So you’re voting for Trump
So vote for Trump
Zuckerberg defending Twitters decision to temporarily limit Trump Jrs features for 12h who didn't see that coming?
It’s too bad the  has their head up trump’s ass and can’t do what right for the people of our country!  I can’t wait until you’re voted out down ballot!!
The real nightmare would be having a Trump move into my neighborhood—or anyone from this clown car of an administration.
So what.  You had no mask yesterday and were breathing your illness all over the place.  You're a real piece of work Louie.  Take a nap man, get better and realize the nature of this pandemic instead of sucking up to Trump.  I understand this is harsh but hey.  Grow up.
She broke the law and got caught. Nothing to do with trump or any of the movement going on. Breaking the law is breaking the law
I won't vote for Trump in November.
In a time like we are having now, it is selfish of them to make a new building. Do you think it's a coincidence it is across from the Trump hotel? What does Trump have to gain by having it close to his hotel? I hope you are able to stop this from being built.
Trump is a FRAUD!!! A DISGRACE! A TRAITOR! Try putting on your big boy pants and "adulting" for a while. We know you can't! #PersonWomanManCameraTV. People are laughing AT you and disgusted BY you...mostly both!
Oh so you’re responsible for putting them in the toilet? Another stunning deal from Trump
Trump needs to resign.
This is frightening NO More Cults IDC if your candidate lost or not anyone planning not to vote cause their candidate won't be VP are Trump supporters in reality same goes with Bernie or Bust voters
And if  biggest issue with  is that she voted with Trump too much, then they would be SHOCKED to learn that she voted against Trump TWICE as often as the late Sen. John McCain.
Trump tells suburban voters they will 'no longer be bothered' by low-income housing
We Lost the Battle for the Republican Party’s Soul Long Ago
Thank you govenor victory for the people and Trump caved once again
Vote as if your life department on it 3rd party vote is a vote for Trump staying home is a vote for Trump
Demented donny tRUMP a puppet for Russia and a complete and utter failure.
Gm everyone i wake up to see Claudia Conway return and an interview saying Trump never discussed Russian Bounty on American troops. We all know he doesn't give a dam and is Putin's best friend
Love you President Trump
Trump has over 20 women claiming he raped/ sexually assaulted them, has talked about walking into teen beauty pageant dressing rooms &amp; bragged about how hot his daughter is! Creepy Crown 👑
"We used to push Biden to put forward a vision beyond beating Trump, but since he won't try, I guess we won't either!"
I find it very interesting that within 1-2 days of the frontline doc summit promoting H-C-Q...  ...Trump announces Kodak will be making ingredients for generic drugs.  Hmmmm 🤔
Do us all a favor and resign please. Stop blaming this problem on Trump because it was the same shit when Obama was in office. CPD hates you bacause you dont stand up for them. It's sad and pathetic.
Makes you wonder what the Dems plan really is.... Soros hinted at taking Trump out during his speech in Switzerland this month.
Democrats well is drying up  Trump keeps on exposing the liberal money makers Chinese faucets College indoctrination camps It was on display  the barr hearing  Love swalwell new look but brain remains the same
These past 12h and so on have been the best since moment Trump got impeached in the house. With Trump Jr getting limited access to Twitter for 12h along with Kelli Ward and Twitter removing Trump's tweets on Covid19.
Donald Trump begins rolling back DACA in defiance of the Supreme Court.
Barr could NOT answer the simple 1st Amendment of the Constitution question Yes/No 5 TIMES. Always had to drag a Trump defense story into his answer. What a lying flying asshole!  How can that be defended?
We need President Trump for at least the next 4years or more.
You reported that Trump paid prostitutes to pee in a bed supposedly slept in in by Obama. Totally normal.
1.4 billion Chinese voters:  [   ] Trump [   ] Biden [x ] Xi  Democratic Party:  "Russians!"
I am glad Bill Barr is on Parler and nothing else it's the perfect place for people like him Trump should join Parler and leave Twitter since he rants about them a lot lately
Only if they’re old rich white guys who placate Trump.
Do you really that he is NOT! trump is an ENEMY COMBATANT potus in plain view...
He didn't get suspended cause Trump retweeted the video Kelli Ward and Trump Jr uploaded the video according to a spokesperson for the company
When you tweet or talk can you still taste tRUMP on your lips? He's pretty far out of date so it can't taste too good. How do you and others in the GOP justify blowing tRUMP when you all hate homosexuality? Just wondering. Now what were you saying?
Trump once again failed our nation but you won't President Biden. Pray for you and all Covid 19 victim's often.
Breaking: Kelli Ward like Trump Jr has been suspended for 12 hours for sharing the same video that he shared.
Trump Jr still suspended for another 6 hours these 12 hours will be the best 12h for the resistance
They would like President to be responsible for everything that trump takes no responsibility for....  But it doesn’t work that way!!
Barletta did overperform in Luzerne.  I think Trump is favored to carry it, but probably by a similar margin to Barletta even if Biden is winning the state by less than Casey did.
Lucerne County, PA- Trump vs Biden
Barr isn’t that big of an idiot...he knows who and what trump is!!
Barr is only there to protect trump and help shield him as he tries to be re-elected!  That’s all!!    It’s horrible to sheenwhat has become of our country and these people are destroying it for their own personal gain!
The film in question claims that all Muslims are potential terrorists and argues for their dehumanization. It's from Trump's "let's ban Muslims from entering the country and kick them all out" school of thought, which is actively genocidal in intention.
Two things seem to annoy Trump: stealing the limelight and not falling in line. Fauci is doing both, so of course he annoys him.
This is Trump’s America
Lol...thinking everything is a conspiracy except anything that Trump is involved with must be a wild way to live.
1. CIA was monitoring the virus in Nov 2019. 2. trump had news on 12/22/19 in the PDB 3.  Went classified till later Feb. 4.  Pulled 3 offices of pandemic response 1 during this period. 5. Testing failure of not adopting Europes cost huge.
If Twitter can suspend Trump's son for 12h they certainly can do the same to Trump himself their actions today show that they are getting closer to suspending him
OMG wow 1st Trump's tweets get removed now Trump Jr has been suspended for 12 hours today is off to a great start well done everyone
The real Trump derangement syndrome affects those deranged enough to support him. Y’all are fucked up.
The irony is that Trump has made America a 3rd world country. Pandemic killing 1,000 people each day, double digit unemployment, secret police squads grabbing people off the streets
The fact that we even defending hashtags is insane that's how far Trump is gone
Trump cant fire Fauci fantastic he is safe atm but he could still find someone to fire him and with less than 100 days til election day it would make things even worse if he tries too
Gm everyone I wake up and Trump's tweet about being a cure for Covid19 has been removed making it the most severe action Twitter has taken what a great start to the day.
So, think that Trump, as man who admitted that he never kids, was kidding?
Because Trump’s a douche bag
Their not afraid of it, they don’t want to give Trump credit for it!
You might want to rethink What you just said.   Trump has Leaders in other countries treating him like he’s a king.     Go ahead and watch this documentary it’s very enlightening 😉
Trump is so jealous Dr. Fauci got attention and was asked to throw out the 1st pitch at the Nationals game.    How pathetic is trump to make up that he was invited to do the same at a Yankees Game!  He is seething with jealousy....
Trump is still pissed and jealous that Dr. Fauci was invited to throw out the 1st pitch!
I lost one last week. 20 plus years of friendship gone because he likes trump and his ideas. Can't hang with that.
How about reporting on scott Baio and how he molested nicole eggert and is now headlining a trump rally. Give kopech some room
In other news, because of my strong focus on the Trump virus, I will have to cancel my August 15th wedding to Scarlet Johansson
31 days it took 31 days for 1 reporter to ask Trump on if he confronted Putin on bounties. Why didn't they ask this from the day it happened what took so long.
Hope he had a good time at the Trump rally 🤣
Trump's national security advisor has been caught not wearing a mask along with his buddies having an indoor dinner. Remember the indoor dinners in the pre covid times except  the photo was taken 2 weeks ago and he's been caught wearing a mask below his nose which is incorrect
WTF Trump is planning to send hundreds of more unidentified federal agents to Portland specifically at a courthouse this is coming from Ali Velshi and the mayor of Seattle who is on his show.
Trump will soon have his Dr. confirm his skin is in fact very thick!  The thickness skin ever.
Since Trump thinks it's illegal for trending topics i am helping make #TrumpleThinSkin trend.
Unless someone makes up an award, Trump is getting nada!
Good. He wouldn’t want Trump there. Racist a$$ Trump
It's not illegal to trend hashtags Trump is definitely insane if his supporters really believe that will they quit Twitter just to obey him. I mean come on this is another distraction that he is creating and it is a stupid one they know he has nothing left but to whine.
Deactivate your Twitter account Trump if you hate Twitter so much
What happened to forgive and forget come on we certainly can't do that with Trump and Trumpers but we can with people like Harris
Unironically “I left the left because some Trump voters were nice to me once.”
Trump is no leader...he hasn’t done shit to contain this virus!  He has absolutely NO ability to lead!!
Obama helped pull this country out of the Great Recession of 2008. He helped save America. Goofs like you think Trump walks on water as he enriches himself at our expense
Welcome to Donald Trump’s America
Yeah because Trump allowed masks which means no mail in ballots.
145,000+ dead from Trump virus. He spends the weekend golfing now today rage tweeting
Interesting, Trump also has massive debt &amp; ties to Russia
Are you an active Senator?  Do tax dollars pay you to monitor the other political party’s ad buying? That has NOTHING TO DO WITH BEING A LAWMAKER!! You OLD WHITE REPUBLICAN MEN sit around, looking for ways to inside trade, kiss Trump ASS, and yell out BENGHAZI every few min!This is the standard Trump said something monumentally stupid/racist/sexist/classist/offensive defense. Its always just a joke.  The Fuck outta here with that bullshit.
The Trump cultists are saying he died from colon cancer. Just scrolling down the replies of the president’s statement about Herman Cain is eye-opening.
Not me.
They are saying he was weak and dying anyways so it wasn’t really his piss poor decision to not wear a mask that killed him. Clearly btw, Trump* knew what was happening to him, he canceled all of his rallies since. Only took Herman’s life to prove covids seriousness to trump.
So are you a Democrat? Because you’re obviously bringing it up. Go look at any single thing Trump has said and tell me again that he hasn’t pushed anything... why don’t you go sit and read rather than just spouting false information? ... 🤷🏼‍♂️🤦🏼‍♂️💁🏼‍♂️
Isn’t the white haired guy in the photo the same one that stood with Dr. Immanuel the alien DNA, demon sperm, religion vaccine conspiracy nut job?
President Donald Trump suggested delaying the 2020 presidential election on Thursday, tweeting it will be “the most inaccurate and fraudulent election in history.”
not to be a conspiracy theorist, but the republican foot-in-the-door strategy has been moving the overton window to the right for decades. trump suggesting delaying the election doesn’t seem far from suggesting we don’t need anymore at all.
Still better than Trump. Especially if he picks Warren or Harris.
Don wouldn’t show. He is a germaphobe.  He doesn’t like the reality of death, ask Mary Trump on that. And he doesn’t want to face the family since Cain most likely got the virus following Trump’s rally criteria and loved ones might be really angry at him.  It is all about Don.
Trump cannot delay the election. This is not a Republican or Democrat issue, this is an American issue. Vote on November 3rd.
Exactly. Trump is the Troll King. ❤️
4 billion in unrelated nonsense when the GOP can’t agree on as little as $200 for those displaced by Trump poor leadership in covid. Tomorrow citizens of the US will be homeless due to your inability to focus on the needs of Americans. This isn’t the Democrats fault. It is yours.
and send them in after I vote in person so I could vote Trump 4 times lol
Mail in voting is such a fraud I’m getting in my mail stuff constantly pushing mail in voting and the people haven’t lived here in four years  I’m sure I will get at least 3 ballots I won’t because I’m a republican but I should fill out all 3 and vote Trump
Enjoy Trump’s second term.
Remember when you said this was just some conspiracy bullshit? Is it bad your opponent knows you better than yourself?
It’s so sad how far Fox News has fallen just heard th  Edm  on the radio saying Trump is pushing false information about mail in voting They’re just such a disgrace to themselves
It's almost like...having a compromised immune system...would be a good reason to wear a mask and/or stay home from a trump rally, which he did neither
Tell that to Donald John Trump Sr. and all those who believe that he can selectively observe and change and over ride the United States Constitution and Bill of Rights by himself without congressional amendments at his singular discretion and whim.
During a visit to West Texas, President Donald Trump hinted that a second round of stimulus checks could exceed the $1,200 payment amount issued in the first COVID-19 stimulus package.
"No,  will not try and delay or postpone the election to keep the office."    What a load of bullshit.  you're afraid.  Afraid that you're losing power, control, and importance.  Still time to make good decisions.  #wearadamnmask
Tech CEOs that testify before Congress surely come away feeling like they just had to help their grandparents with their computer.
President Donald Trump is for the first time floating a “delay" to November's presidential election, saying mail-in voting will result in fraud.
"I don't like the racist things Trump does, I have to support him because of the economy though" ~Someone who is definitely a racist
Hi Marsha, I didn’t notice how old she was. Do you think that Trump will pardon her?
Regis Left $20 Million to Trump Campaign:
TBF, Putin speaks English far better than Trump can.
Democrats don’t care how many die the more the merrier they blame it on corona and blame Trump
Because they want Trump to be right.
I don’t support calling my daughter a piece of ass on Howard stern or having a sex addiction so bad it’s caused Trump* to cheat on every wife and pay a porn star to stay quiet about him raw dogging her... (while he was married)
Trump* wants to have sex with his daughter.
I guess I’d rather mix that up, than confuse my daughter for my 4th mistress like Trump* does.
Dear trump virus,  STOP F*CKING TEASING ME. HIT CHEETOH AND THE MITCH!!!
President Trump.  I never cared about politics or what was going on in this world.  I have been awakened.  And I see what's going on.  And you are the only person I have ever called a hero.  God bless you!  Let's have coffee.🙂
I agree- my fear is Governor will Trump this! (No pun intended)
Stop attributing every trump does to Putin, it makes him seem more menancing for actual anti Putin protests in Russia.
Lotta Trump voters in that feed...
He was on it for lile 4 days...
You're asking Trump supporters to do something inconvenient. They  all know what happens when they feel that something is inconvenient for them...
Can you tell me exactly how Trump is corrupt?  Btw, where are Nancy’s tax returns?
My favorite are the ones like " once Trump is gone, everything will return to normal."  No, MFer, I'm gonna fucking hate those people until I die. Full on spit in the face hate.  They built this.
They're ramping themselves up to vote for Trump, their lord and savior from those evil Democrats
Congratulations to both men for being recognized for your good works.  Now how will Trump retaliate given he pouting about his popularity and had already annouced removing our troops from Germany to as a distraction after the embarrassing endorsement of “alien DNA“ dr over Fauci?
I can only hope that The Lincoln Project does an ad titled “Trump’s AmeriKKKa “ with highlights from Lafayette Sq., Portland, Seattle and anywhere his gestapo thugs have been. The violence is now, caused by him not Biden.
I agree Linda. We need to stop these white supremacist Trump supporters from posing as Antifa.
White supremacist Trump supporters posing as antifa are looting and setting fires.
If Biden chooses a good VP candidate like Tammy Duckworth, Trump wouldn't stand a chance.
They are white supremacist Trump supporters posing as Antifa.
Qanon is a foreign managed psyop to focus a cult of personality of the most "useful idiots" in America to shield actual pedophiles like Trump by black flagging nonsense and accusing innocent people.   It always was, and always will be.
This is an awesome display of patriotism. I would love to see it catch on with Hannity and Trump
are you gonna let Trump disrespect you all?  Are you on his side too?
After now seeing two interviews of President Trump, it seems pretty clear that  A) Trump doesn't have anyone giving him good advice B) He's not listening to anyone who wants to give him good advice  And that advice is, "don't interview"  both options are bad.
you really have more important things to think about and do - get off Twitter before you become like Trump - you are better than this
35million unemployed 55million kids not in school 22million expected to be evicted soon  All because the Democrats and Chinese hate Trump.    #Trump2020 #MAGA2020 🇺🇸
So now Trump is supposed to stop hurricanes? He has to step in and do Gov. And Mayor's jobs because they refuse to stop the violence and destruction of our cities. Grow a brain,  smfh
All while trump is still fvcking his daughter?
Yeah, 'Trump dipshit sycophancy' is real alright and pathetic all around.
Nadler or Trump ?
Blacks Latinos Jews Women LGBTQ+ Muslims and Chinese for Trump  I try not to judge but I'm failing. I don't understand how these demographic of people (&amp; others unlisted) can support him.
President Trump holds a news conference:
Sooo Trump WASNT just "inspecting" the room in the basement. Lmao! #BarrHearing
She should be at the next Trump rally and the next corona briefings
Because the virus is now part of their coup. They weaponize it against Trump whilest simultaneously retracting information that can save lives, and ignoring it during their own riots and 'protests'.  Vile, murderous people.
Twitter has limited some functionality on Donald Trump Jr.’s account after he tweeted a video that ran afoul of the company’s policies on Covid-19 misinformation, a Twitter spokesperson confirmed to CNN Business on Tuesday.
Why don’t you report what the CLINICAL supporters of HCQ are saying?  Is the Trib part of a Racket that wants to raise the body count, in hopes of damaging Trump &amp; electing a senile and corrupt kid-sniffer for President?  Report the other side.  #LadyMacbeth washed and washed
Studies have shown hydroxychloroquine isn't an effective treatment for COVID-19 and the U.S. government is no longer allowing it to be used for that purpose.
Why won’t the Secret Service tell us how much they have spent at Trump* resorts? Why is the RNC and Trump* campaign spending MILLIONS at Trump* properties? Why won’t the admin share the list of biz that took PPP money? are trumps cronies on that list?
How did the Chinese get so much influence on our tech platforms and media?  🤔/ 😂   Go Trump, bust up those human traffickers aka China.  The days of them enslaving their people, via work conditions, surveillance, illness, need to end.
Politico is obviously part of this latest #Hoax.  HCQ saves lives, it doesn’t kill.  Is your state trying to kill people and raise the body count hoping to damage Trump?
Of course, illegal brown people. Duh. I’m surprised the cause isn’t stupid Governors pandering to their idiot citizens &amp; Trump.
Lol.. Trump*  and Barr are fucking incompetent.
Agreed worse now. Nixon put positive policies in place which affect us to this day. Can trump/gop the same thing?  No
Ted Nugent adopted a teenage girl so he could have sex with her  Trump only surrounds himself with deviants
Judging from how hard it had been for my niece to get that RX for her lupus, Trump hoarded it from the pharm companies and now the government owns millions of doses sitting in warehouses unused. BTW patient were thanked for their sacrifice when they denied per Trump’s request
They don't get a pass because they were only 80% shitty compared to Trump and McConnell being 110% shitty.
You're saying that as if Melania Trump cares about anyone who isn't Melania Trump.
Why would we all be getting played?  Who wins this game?  Trump wishes this to be true, it just isn’t factual.  There’s no conspiracy here, Americans simply can’t listen to simple instructions to help the more susceptible population, pretty sad.
Where are Trump's well wishes tweet to Cain?
Cute but I think her vocabulary is more difficult and expansive than Trump.  Liddle kids are adorable though,  CONFEVE that is all.
Trump should bring her to the briefings
Nah trump will just import from Saudi Arabia or Russia 😠
It has come out in the news media that the fbi lied about trump.  They signed off on releasing the dossier that had lies about trump.  Can’t trust the fbi either.
Since they work for the government they don’t have any choice but to obey Trump. And they’re not secret do you announce the departments they are coming from. They had identification numbers that you can report. So not secret. Try again.
One with a Trump bumper sticker.
A simple “no” on Trump’s part would have sufficed.  Everybody, even his supports, knows he didn’t.
Lol that lady isn’t far off from trump and it’s fitting she was outted as racist after the show. He called her “baby girl Lisa” 😂😂
Someone put trump and Kanye’s face over two characters from 90 day fiancé. It’s a reality TV show that is basically human cartoons.
Trump has been callous to this good man’s passing from the beginning.  It is a gift to the family that he doesn’t desecrate Rep. Lewis’ memory with he cold, ugly, racist presence.
Tell Facebook to stop allowing right-wing politicians to spread lies and misinformation!
Trump wins, so am I. Fuck this shit.
Everything you need to know about Trump in 2 simple tweets:
Trump isn't anything new for  He's not good at hiding the racist, homophobic, classist parts, but those have been there since (at the very least) Nixon.
Ok, what? Trump &amp; Hannity told me that Antifa is the violent group 🤔
Trump is doing the typical Dictator move. He's turning the White House into a fortress. Are you still wondering if he will need to be forcibly removed?
I'm good with trump not being at Lewis' funeral just like I'm good with him not unveiling Obama's portrait. It would be hypocritical. I know how he feels about Black people.
Me every time that picture of Donald Trump lactating pops up on my timeline
You will have done it to yourselves by hitching your wagons to Trump.
Me seeing Elizabeth Warren trending ❤️❤️❤️ #WarrenForVP  (*sidenote - I'd be happy with whoever Biden picks.  They're all great women.  So long as we get Trump out I'm happy)
The Nazi flags were a nice touch with the man’s Trump shirt.
And this is why, at any other moment, I’d never vote for Biden. However, there are two clear reasons to vote for him: he’s not Trump; Harris as VP.
Totally agree with Rush why are republicans not fighting back I think their not just incase Trump looses the want to be spared by media they have always been pansies and done with the flow they did same thing in the beginning of Trumps win just incase he was thrown out grow  some
Lmfao, this guy really believes Trump doesn't profit from the presidency...
Why is it extraordinary? It's the Trump administration. They literally lie about everything.   THEY LIE ABOUT EVERYTHING  How can you not see this after 20,000 lies in less than 4 years????
Trump has flipped on every single position but the Trump rubes always excuse that.
They’re just giving Trump what he wants. Need to stop.
It's too bad because if Trump weren't a germaphobe he'd probably would've had it by now. He doesn't shake people's hands in private and doesn't let anyone touch anything because in his narcissistic brain of his he believes everyone else is diseased and lesser than him.
So there really is nothing that Trump won't fuck up in this country...
Y’all ain’t doing your job correctly and that’s how I know this some shit cus how trump been around ppl with it but not exposed yet foh
It isn’t like Trump has ever acted protective of Melania. His cheating while she was birthing his son being the ultimate example of his lack of concern for her. But, by now you would think he would get the P.R. of his lack of gallantry.  She also needs to get her own umbrella.
I got a running list of things for which Biden needs to apologize, but he will still get my vote. Harris is my choice for VP no apologies necessary.   Trump is using the Constitution as toilet paper &amp; people want her to grovel? We are in trouble
Your tweet confirms trump has a real chance at winning 4 more years. I've said the same thing &amp; got the same argument from some independent voter.  Biden was my 2nd to last choice but he will get my vote to try to get out of a dictatorship
It would make sense.  The UN is telling Trump he can’t send feds in and what better way to destroy our country than sending in UN troops...democrats want to destroy.
You can dislike Biden, and be critical of his flaws, while still acknowledging the reality that he is very different from Trump in many policy areas.
Trump has been in office less that 4 years - one man hasn’t caused all these problems. All those who have been in office over 12 years are the problem on both parties. Term Limits!  This election is capitalism vs communism.
bUt bIdEn iS tHe sAmE aS tRuMp  Screamed the entitled progressive dripping in privilege.
Trump’s a damn liar!! Mail-in voting safe, except for Trump’s baseless attacks FULL OF LIES. Hey, Trump... How are you voting? #Biden2020Landslide #TrumpFailedAmerica
Seeds are probably what they were developing in the lab with COVID to get back at Trump over the terifs
Yes for TRUMP
Every last person in the Trump administration is absolute trash.
Meanwhile Trumps only for Trump*.
Mike Pence, Bill Barr, Kayleigh McEnany, Jared Kushner, Ivanka Trump, Melania Trump, Betsy DeVos, Larry Kudlow, Wilbur Ross, Brad Parscale and Donald Trump all voted with Mail-In. So, shut the fuck up &amp; stop dogging on USPS for your authoritarian regime you fucking dip shit
I mean, Trump* voted by mail. So in addition to taxes and his wives, you are saying he cheated cause he voted by mail?
Trump retweeted this more than an hour after the event started. Lol.
You are SOOOOOO right.  People think Trump made this happen.  The Shitty was there for decades.  is a festering boil. It has continued to grow and get worse, but it started long ago.
Joe, everyone will have an excellent shot at success if Donald J. Trump is re-elected.   If you are elected, the whole nation will go in the basement!  #MAGA2020 #BacktoWorkAmerica #BackToSchoolAmerica
According to Trump*, Trump and his entire family are guilty of voter fraud by doing mail in ballots.
Trump is either weak or inept or both.
I’m waiting for Trump* to do a interview on The Breakfast Club with
Were you sad when Trump put children in cages that are now being sexually trafficked?
Because of the hateful way the left talks about Trump, he has to emphasize how his actions have benefited minorities (and everybody).  The facts would be buried otherwise.  Media will not tell the truth.  #BacktoWorkAmerica #BackToSchoolAmerica
Copy and paste this text and tweet it:  JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
It’s weird how all the white nationalists vote for Trump* though... don’t ya think?!?!?
Hey uh.. QANON.. ya got any problems with a Trump* running around with a cult that practices polygamy and child brides? Or... ya just worried about Pizza Hut?
I'm also on the democratic mailing list and only get 1 maybe 2 emails a month though and never got this many before Trump. I dont normally donate to campaigns but I probably would donate to Biden if he chose Duckworth as VP
I need people to know that we are not all like the Asswipe down the road with the trump flag! #NotMyPresident #BLM #loveislove
4 million 17 year olds turn 18 before Nov 3  that is 1 of the reasons there is such a push for schools to open can't vote if you're sick or dead  Trump lost popular vote by almost 4 million  Younger people have the power
Trump* committed voter fraud by mailing in his vote?!?!?
Trump &amp; GOP will use the evictions to invalidate 100s of 1000s if not millions of voter registrations due to relocations &amp; homelessness. Nothing will stop that massive purge. Whether or not that works, I fear he will try to invalidate having the elections at all because of unrest
Can always count on the Trump rubes to make everything political...
I've been a part of the Republican party emailing list for years and get like 1 email a month, if that even. In the past month or so I have gotten 5+ emails PER DAY from the Trump campaign asking for donations, selling MAGA gear, and trying to get me to sign up to absentee vote
And, is that Harriet Tubman, the person he won’t replace Andrew Jackson with on the $20 until Trump is out of office?
Frederick Douglass????  Seriously??  Trump couldn’t “recognize” him if he were to come alive again and was the only one in the room!
Trump*: what is Ivanka has a nice rack?
Trump* said Washington liberated airports.
Quick signature: Tell the Trump administration and Congress to protect the CDC and fund testing and contact tracing!
I had a joke about Trump but nobody wanted to hear it.
Not just lazy.  Trump is callous, selfish, inept, demented and cruel.

Trump supporters going full Nazi
Incorrect. Don't really care for Trump, but all of the cognitive dissonance and idiocracy is completely on the left now. I say that as someone who voted democrat most of my life.  I'll be voting trump. TBH everyone remaining on the left has extreme cognitive issues.
Seriously, Watters is bring Trump’s long time buddy Jeffrey Epstein into this conversation with his children‘s cancer charity stealing son?  That is another door he wanted to swing open?
Thank you for inquiring. State Farm does not endorse Brett Favre. -Jessica
It isn’t subtle either.  It is the same thing Trump has said to all in trouble who have damning info on him.
Tom, the problem is that the next proto-fascist will probably be smarter and more capable.  Trump has shown how much destruction can be done if you just ignore every possible norm and no one pushes back.
The riots in Portland should be summarily put down.  People wielding eye-blinding lasers should be shot. The violence and destruction are not a lawful assembly ‘for redress of grievances’. Trump should invoke the Insurrection Act.  Thugs must be jailed.
Belief is such a funny word. Belief is a choice, and the Trump Evangelicals make the choice to follow their false orange god. I don't consider them Christians, just hypocrites who quote scripture and wave Bibles around.
He’s saying Trump* supporters have to do a lot of backtracking, grandpa.
Man, I made this bears twitter for sports only, followed devoted Bears fans for strictly football but some of y’all make it tough to follow  If you love Trump or hate him, I can guarantee everyone that follows you for bears football could give a fuck about your opinion on him.
Everything Trump does benefits Putin while damaging the USA bit we're not supposed to think he's a puppet??
Stop calling it fn "Trump's America." This is just who we fn are. He catalyzed a lot but it's not going away when he does.
This is a lie and it’s obviously so, since Trump has prided himself on raising employment rates.  The RINOs might turn up their noses at working people but not honest Republicans.
Yeah you follow trump and cited 13/50 un ironically like it hasn’t been discredited by every academic study conducted... I’ll doubt that one
It's quite interesting the  is trying to sell "pre #COVID19" Trump, while admitting we arent going back to pre #coronavirus days.
Trump taped the interview with Portnoy just a day after a Fox News interview in which he crowed at length about his supposed ability, on a cognitive test he says he took, to remember five words in order: "Person, woman, man, camera, TV."  Crowed at Length.  Fucking brilliant!
Let's say we will vote for GOP members that stood up to Trump. That would be one, once. Too late.
It’s time for Trump to take action and stop talking about doing something or Portland Seattle Chicago is just the beginning
Trump isn't "acting" like an authoritarian dictator. He is an authoritarian dictator. We need to stop using soft language that gives him the benefit of doubt.
Unfortunately, it is a scene from a dictatorship in some third world country.  America is sinking and Trump orders more anchors.
I see pic now.  I think that Trump has tried to save people, but many forces want him gone and think getting people to associate body count with him his helping their cause.  Just look at the cabal resistance to therapeutics, and blue state elderly maneuvers. Its obviously evil.
Odd that the same people celebrating the settlements of Nick Sandmann as some sort of proof that the media is corrupt don’t see Trump’s settlements as any sign of guilt at all.
One can only hope, wish &amp; pray she takes her trump values ass off the air!
You know because of Trump poor handling of covid, you are probably the only plane from the U.S. that was allowed in the country or in the entire EU for that matter. Personally, given the Trump Administration's rate of infection among personnel, I wouldn’t have let you in either.
Oh my, my, my.  Rich people don’t want their kids at risk of covid. You know what, others parents don’t either.  Will Don force Barron’s school to open too?  Barron Trump's School Not Resuming Classes Like Normal This Fall Despite Trump's Push to Reopen
Let’s help  weigh-in on the #RFS. Share your voice now and let President Trump and EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler to immediately reject the small refinery exemptions as invalid and illegal.
Media should be asking Trump why you still supporting Fauci after last nights actions
Since Trump took him off the briefings he wasn’t getting enough attention
Trump’s SS whacking a protestor upside the head with a baton. That’s an illegal action.
There is no trump without conservative talk radio, local communities of people talking about their ideas/identity, and a frustration with existing power structures
I think the tragedy is employers/employment. US leadship is a quagmire &amp; trump is a tyrant. But in a republic, it’s the actions of the people that dictate the leadership, not the reverse.   The militarization of ideology/politics (right &amp; left) is groundswell immorality
I have a package stuck in limbo since may. It's not the USPS fault. Thank trump for this
The maggat doesn’t realize you are talking about Trump* so he liked your tweet. Lol
Barron Trump's school and most private schools will have virtual learning It's not safe for them not us 😠😒
At least it's against trump as long as they all vote against him in Nov  We gotta take what we can get 😀Correction: *Trump Virus
Damn what did he show you? He’s shown me a lot of bad shit like war And human trafficking... hope that’s not gods doing.... he’s in control right. 😭😭😭😭 god haves us trump too and about to get 4 more years. That’s gods will too?
If it was real Putin would see this as an opportunity, not a threat. Trump must be really, really worried.
The Reason Trump’s a Monster – Markin Report
Why isn't Trump?
Who asked you? And trump did a mock election using mail ins and some of the votes got lost. Please educate yourself bc you don’t know if all the votes go in.
You wouldn’t have to say Hillary Clinton’s name either, you might remember when she called Trump supporters deplorables
You believe that. Don’t mean it’s true. And that’s my point. You haven’t see he/she. So you don’t know. And if god is always in control like y’all love to say, then god gave y’all Donald Trump! Gotta love it 😂
Have the country did not trust our last election becase of proven Russian interference but Trump was still elected.
I wonder if all the Dems who were ok with Trump’s campaign being spied on would be ok if he were to do the same to Biden.
On November 3rd, #WeWillVote as scheduled. Any delay of any kind is unconstitutional! Trump is a disgrace to the human race! I've heard of chimpanzees being smart. I think they would beat Trump in the cognitive test. #TrumpleThinSkin
If Trump supports it, it has to suck
Donald Trump should resign. Pass it on.
Even if its not Trump's  FAULT he absolutely did next to NOTHING to make it better.
Another Russian tactic. When is Trump going to realize Russia is making a fool out of him?
That’s cause his “base” is “Jim Jonesed” They will follow Trump into Hell.
Give it a freaking rest.  What about all the kids still in cages?  What about Trump not having a Federal COVID plan?  What about the Russian bounties?  Or Barr lying to Congress?  Let’s get up to date in political scandals.
this dude weird ash💀💀 really went through all my tweets because I support trump😂 f*cking liberals have no life
Trump has been the president America has had since JFK
Because the white evangelicals who support Trump are racists.
Wow you’re Just lumping in the paranoia. Of course it’s a Trump supporter who is infiltrating the protesters. And then the mysterious unidentified secret police.
Trump is, yes
Ya at least 60 million of us out here. We voted for President Trump in 2016 and we Will vote for President Trump again this November &amp; this time it we will be much more than 60 million voters
A nursing home gave over 200 residents hydroxychloroquine without state health department approval. People, this is why Trump should keep his mouth shut about a drug he knows NOTHING about. This is a perfect reason if someone taking his I’ll-advises advice

I hope they play the clip of Trump where he said that the Dr.Immanuel is a very fine Dr. from his tweets yesterday A reporter this is the same Dr. who alleges alien DNA is currently used in medical treatments and vaccines are being cooked up to prevent people from being religious
What did you expect. It’s time for the 25th amendment. Trump is deranged.

If Trump loses He will leave office. President Trump hasn’t violated the Constitution in his 4 years in office. It’s impossible for a President to stay in office after his term is over. He has no power, he can’t order anybody to do anything, this is just a lie pushed by Leftists.

Strange thing for the Reagan Foundation to ask, since Trump is Reagan’s legacy.

Without a single solid doubt, this is the most disgusting, disrespectful, and disgraceful thing that I have seen on Twitter! These idiotic Trump supporters, wearing swastikas as face masks, say, "A vote for Joe Biden = a vote for Nazis." Totally disgraceful to America!
A vote for anyone other than  or not voting, is a vote for Trump.

Ron Fournier is greatly disturbed that the electorate chose a salesman as President. Trump is not an elitist, he doesn’t sympathize with Marxist as Ron does, he doesn’t belong to the right clubs or go to the right cocktail parties, so Ron is scandalized.
How much more disrespectful and hateful does the President have to be?! Mocking a Democratic mayor who got gassed by Trump's paramilitary forces like that! It's unacceptable! He needs to be voted out of the white house forever in November! #EnoughIsEnough #GestapoTrump

Hey man I get it. Trump may say dumb things, but if you look he’s doing great things. Biden has had 40 years in office, and his most successful bill locked up more black Americans. Trump freed them with the First Step Act. Vote for who you want, I just ask you do your research
He is nuts. I have known since the 1980s that Trump was a scumbag.

Im done. Im sorry. I just am scared as fuck of "But her emails 2020" and you know what it means very little to me anyway. I am a 54 year old rich, white, hetero man whose life will be little affected by Trump winning again.
I was talking about what I see today.  Not because of Biden. Because of media and Trump. I dont care about Biden.
Charlotte I have followed u 4 a long time. I just looked at your tweets for today and see tweets about a incorrect statement about the history of US presidents. Yet I dont see any about Trump and Barr sending secret police to our cities. It was a quick look and I could be wrong.
Its like this. In 2016 Trump would say awful thing after awful thing and media would say "But her emails".
Come November 4th rip him to shreds.  Hell come January 21st let him drop dead. Its like people saying he stumbles when he talks and ignoring Trump rambles on incoherently and forgets for minutes on end that his wife is next to him and he apologizes for her not being with him.
Yes Charlotte you are correct Biden was wrong he wasnt the 1st. Now can you get Jake Tapper and the like to talk more about Trump sending secret police into our cities.
Cancel me I guess because I believe Trump is orders of magnitudes worse.
I mean people are getting bent out of shape he said "Trump is 1st racist president" rather then cheering him on that he isnt afraid to say "Trump is a racist president".
THERE IS NO NEW TONE just liked this and it is a perfect example for the media. The media has gone on and on about Trump's new tone yesterday. We dont need them going on and on doing a "Joe, but actually".
I know a lot of Trump supporters who are pissed that he changed his tune.
I wont say anything about that last comment other then that is a silly thing to even think. I simply dont want media to dwell on the comment rather then secret police going into our cities creating chaos and giving media for Trump advertisements.
No. Its just a silly thing to put wind under the wings.  Lets live in the modern era. Not an era where like 90% of white people were racist. So of course Trump isnt the 1st racist president. Worry about #GestapoTrump not a technically incorrect comment.
Ding, ding, ding someone gets it. We dont need to let the media create another D E P L O R A B L E S for Trump and his supporters to exploit.
Just being snarky because of people getting up in arms about Biden calling Trump the 1st racist president.
Yeah but Joe Biden called Trump the 1st racist president
Just letting you know #MTPDaily I and many other will turn you off as soon as you put Trump on. Dont broadcast live. Cut to him if something important is being said. Dont be his propaganda network.
meanwhile Trump is sending Secret Police to cities and people are going "Joe, but actually". You know what he meant.
Yes and if media lets him Trump will try to make this a D e p l o r a b l e s moment
During that era wasnt he more the normal every day white man. Trump isnt. Trump represents the minority view, not the majority view like Wilson.
Words cannot describe how much disappointment, frustration, and fury I have for your Republican colleagues! They're failing their constitutional oath and They've done nothing to protect the American people! They're only doing President Trump's dirty work, and it's disgraceful!

Yes. Unmarked federal agents are kidnapping people and teargassing moms in Portland.  This is Trump's America.  VOTE!
This is the truth. It’s just the media is paying attention, they think it’s connected to BLM or they want to blame Trump but Chicago’s always been a violent place
Lets be honest as well Trump goon squads wont go to those neighborhoods and try to stop violence. They will go to wear protesters are and abuse and detain them.

I've worked in two US Fortune 5 corps, the US Military, have my own consulting firm. I know what leadership is, what organizational skills are. trump has none of it.
I've watched trump for 30+ years. There is nothing about his life that has made him fit for this job. He is not a real businessman, is in no way a leader, has no idea of what the job requires, has no experience for it, and has not gotten any better at it.
Trump must lose and lose by a very wide margin!
There is nothing about trump that is fit for the office he holds.

He don’t care.  Trump need go to JAIL!!  He make a more crime!!
I’m sort of.... an agnostic Swiftie. When she finally came out against Trump I may have seen the light :)
Yes. This is Trump's America.  Why do people constantly put the blame on past and future presidents for Trump's ineptitude  I wonder.
Only in Trump's America would this happen.
Trump has made it political .
Ya when I hear that Trump was slow on reacting and taking care of this virus, I asked them what they would have done different.i get no response so that tells me its just a talking point for them.
“The game is over for me...” - should be the new Trump campaign slogan 😂
It’s unprofessional speaking!! Trump should stay work at hotel!!
Geraldo Rivera fires back at Biden's 'flamboyant' Trump racism claim
Gov. Whitmer says she wants Trump administration to issue a federal mask mandate
Really? You think she‘s worse than trump in this regard? Funny...
In the toilet with trump.
I am now seeing clown ads from the trumpshits on some Youtube videos. What will be more entertaining to watch is biden getting elected and trump sent to federal prison.
Oh Donald John Trump 🤦🏽‍♂️ we don’t care! 😂
Having dealt with many teachers today, I am not suprised, I’ve seen children come home and blurting our anti American anti Trump anti capitalism rhetoric and hate. Not normal for a 9 year old.

Bro back then white supremacy was normal . I can 100% guarantee if u lived back then you would be racist. Trump is a racist and a idiot in 2020. The previous presidents besides Andrew Jackson were all heroes.
Lost me at “Trump provided”

You are just spewing what you've been fed. There is no reason why it might just as well have started here as they spring up where there is animal/human contact. Where do you think the Spanish Flu started?  But trump doesn't do details. Guess that is why you seem to like him.

I’m not so sure about the citizens who support wanna-be dictator trump.
sieg heil ... WTF happened to this country? Not Trump because, 30%+ still support him and these federal assholes have no problem beating on women. “Moms” have raised some serious narcissistic assholes
If I was there for a month attacking cops and burning federal buildings , tearing down statues etc I wouldn't blame the feds for snatching me, the Fascists state or Trump or anyone but myself.
Or even better “first openly racist president in modern times” or better yet just left it as “Trump is a racist.”
I wish you would have showed the same concern about federal law enforcement abuses when President Trump had intelligence agencies weaponized against him in an attempted soft coup.Then  I would take your concern for this shit puppet more serious.
