Joe Biden is struggling. The idea that the African American community is one monolithic group with no diversity of ideas or thought is a racist idea. It stereotypes an entire group of Americans.
And of course you realize if you vote for Biden,  the country will really be run to buy Harris or Talib or whoever he picks for vice president.  Biden won't be able to mentally run the country.  Guess you dont mind that.  But regardless, I can't wait for the debates!!
And Russia is working hard for Trump...  Not buying for a single second China wants Biden. Trump is giving them everything they want.
Most of the US is Winner take all,‚Äù so skipping voting or voting third party means a vote for the incumbent. He‚Äôs going to have &gt;35% registered voters turn out for him. His staff is getting Kanye on the ballot in blue states to take votes from Biden.
Yes, it's the comic artist making things worse, not Biden every time he opens his mouth. Thank you for that insight.
Biden...you mean the dementia patient?  No, I wouldn't wait any amount of time to vote for Biden.  Matter of fact, I'll use all the ballots the state sends me to vote for Mr. Trump.
Under Obama/Biden the steel industry was handed over to China. They didn‚Äôt have to adhere to strict standards that American business had to abide. CCP didn‚Äôt tax their steel to death. Steel companies moved out of eastern OH and west PA in droves. O/B policies killed it.
Someone responded to a friend on FB recently after Trump's disastrous Jonathan Swan interview, saying something about Biden being out of it. I wanted to respond that they need to watch full interviews of Biden instead of highly edited clips. Swan's &amp; Wallace's interviews are full
LMAOOOO sure the President‚Äôs disastrous Axios interview and rants about water pressure and ‚ÄúBiden hurting God‚Äù are definitely evidence of his newfound message discipline
I think it will be Rice. I think that is who Biden will feel the most comfortable working with.
Went on Joe Biden‚Äôs website, found his policies right away. Went on Trump‚Äôs website, literally zero policy to be found.
Rich white men like Joe biden. I'm sure he'll fix it.

Joe Biden, lmao you people.   The man‚Äôs getting a couple hundred live viewers, ya really gotta work hard at being this dense.  Atheist, Vegan, Tds, libtard, our true bottom of the barrel.
And Dementia Joe and his V.P. pick will carry the conservative torch? Don't be silly.  Even if you don't like Trump, Biden is a horrible alternative. 40+ years in office with little to show.

Well to be fair, he did just issue an apology this week for one of his gaffes. I‚Äôm pretty sure that Biden has more apologies this week offered than Trump in his whole life. But as you say, it‚Äôs a low bar and no one should necessarily feel proud of beating Trump at anything.

This is 100% spot on.   Biden is Uncle Junior. Well intentioned enough but also sad, confused and lashing out.  Trump is Livia. Determined to malignantly burn everyone and everything down along with himself on the way out.

Because Joe continues too make racist statements. You ain‚Äôt black if you don‚Äôt vote Biden racist racist #Trump2020Landslide

I'm pretty sure Hunter Biden and Obamagate were both from before I was born at this point tbh.
Oh ok actually I just figured out how Joe Biden could get me to vote
Oh my gosh! Look at Steve Kornacki's "Road to 270." He's got Biden at 334 and Trump at 125
An incompetent President could not accomplish the things Trump claims Biden will accomplish (in a negative sense). It‚Äôs one or the other. Or, does he think Reps are so weak that even an incompetent Dem could do anything he wants? It doesn‚Äôt make sense. Maybe it‚Äôs not supposed to.
Trump is trying to simultaneously maintain that Biden is too senile and incompetent to be President, and that he was will be successful in implementing his ‚Äòdastardly schemes‚Äô that he will erase religion, guns, police, and prosperity from the US. It‚Äôs nonsense.
If Biden manages to hurt God that would be quite the accomplishment üòÇüòÇ
Biden is a practicing Catholic and he is "against God."  Oh sit back down.
Who will you vote for if you don't like Biden's VP pick?
Honestly, and this is saying a LOT, I would rather have Hillary than Biden.  You don't even have to pull some "her e-mails" shit, you don't have to say the magic word "Benghazi," you just put him on TV for a minute and he can't help but out himself as another senile old racist.
So obvious... By the way Biden prays in church... That he hates God...
I‚Äôm Joe Biden and we‚Äôre rollin out
Every time the right says some negative shit about Biden, I can't help but be like "Yeah, we already knew that."  Truly, the unity candidate.  Everyone agrees he sucks.
We'll of course he'd say that!  Trump thinks he's God, so naturally Biden is against him.

Yes i wamt to hear Biden plan for us so i can make up my own mind. We compare prices so we choose what we believe is the best one for us. I want to see the difference in a debate.
Ur crazy. Biden has been in the basement for months and when he does come out  His rallies are held in school auditoriums with a little audience. I would like to hear his plans for our country in a debate i want to be able to see both sides so i can make my vote.
Yes! Need to hold Biden accountable. Plus people need to stay active in their local and state governments. Reverting back to not being involved in politics gets us no where.
I know people laugh about that but it's an actual cognitive test and indeed not everyone can remember what they answered exactly in the same order 15 min ago. I can assure you Biden couldn't.
This is a cool ad but there's an unfortunate reason they had to cut Biden so many times to edit his sentences...

i am seeing more outrage at the bryan callen allegations than i am for a dude that may be the next president.  tara reade has been attacked and slandered when everyone should be helping her heal, and cope with the trauma.  fuck joe biden.
So, if Joe Biden chooses a WOC for VP, she's Aunt Jemima? So any elected official set to retire can make racist comments on his way out? And ppl have the nerve to say racism isn't systemic in this country. Stuff like this isn't funny or cute.
Pretty sure folk voting that early already know for whom they will vote ...   They're not gonna be swayed by anything you or Biden have to say
There ya go! Biden 2020. Go America! Good to see vets like me, standing up for decency and honestly over greed and corruption.
They think the black voters are stupid and are trying to lure them away from Biden, obviously.
Trump's ad men are masters of the self-own. Trump looks like an ignorant, preening buffoon while Biden is shown as a serious,  thoughtful, and devout man. This is as bad as their ads trying to scare you about "Biden's America" using pictures of Trump's actual America.

Wow! Everyone doesn't like someone and that someone would be a disaster. You all sound like bots. All of this is being considered by Biden, his selection committee, the DNC and the billionaires that run everything.  The husband that doesn't like Rice doesn't know who Rice is.
I think this is very possibly true. The press conference where Biden announced he wasn‚Äôt running was painful because it was clearly an edited announcement speech.
I do not intend to imply whether the supposed advances for the gay and lesbian communities are good or bad. I am merely analyzing the political strategy behind this quote which is supposedly meant to engender support for Trump over against Biden.

LOLLL I would say yes but because he still will be President, they won't miss any time to continue criticizing him. In fact, any bad thing that happens under Biden if he wins, will be blamed on Trump. They did the same to Bush.

In conclusion I am deeply concerned about signs of Joe Biden's cognitive decline.
Sure, but polling is just prediction &amp; a matter of likelihood anyway. What other evidence should one use? He has to plan his efforts. The more states show polls for Biden, the tougher the road. He could assume that GA &amp; NC are his, but he could also end up wrong.

No, there are no ‚ÄúBiden supporters‚Äù, but there ARE ‚ÄúTrump haters‚Äù who, while voting against our President will be supporting Biden with their votes.  I can‚Äôt think of a worse way to approach an election - voting AGAINST  something you have been ‚Äòbrainwashed‚Äô into hating.
So do you. Always been a left/lib prob: wanting to dictate "right" answer regardless of opinions of others &amp; often w/o consulting those impacted. It's authoritarian not democratic. Ppl chose Biden &amp; you don't care b/c you disagree. Fine line btw upholding democracy &amp; dictating
Such a dumb ass thing to do regardless of how you feel about Kaep.  If he had a Trump wig on, or was wearing a Biden mask, still a dumb ass thing to do.
Why?  Because Joe Biden is a racist and a sexist.  If he actually cared about our country, he would simply pick the best person for the job - regardless of race, sex, etc.
Your delusion and hypocrisy goes deep !! Obama and Biden knew all about Epstein‚Äôs island &amp; did NOTHING! They knew what the FBI had on some members of Congress, well known Hollywood actors/actresses and foreign dignitaries  &amp; did NOTHING !! #exposingDS
Joe Biden should not debate President Trump, Clinton‚Äôs ex-WH spokesman says
Slightly different question though - "What's best for Harris" is not the same as "What is Biden looking for in VP"  Again - I like Harris, and think she would be a great VP pick.  I also think there are other women who would be great VP picks.
True - but we don't really know what role that will be.  Biden was more international policies.  He might want the same for a VP, or he might want someone to lead on domestic policies. He may want someone to really help push through legislation.  Biden could be more transparent.
You cannot be that deluded. Epstein was ALLOWED to sex traffic underage girls and boys by both Clinton &amp; Obama/Biden. FBI, Mueller, Comey , Dershowitz protected their own,not the children. Clinton 26X on JE‚Äôs plane. Trump exposed them allx
and, at that "tele-rally" he talked trash about Biden giving speeches from his basement

This is the dumbest take. Why shouldn‚Äôt *any* vice presidential nominee want to be president? Especially a woman nominee. Any Biden ally or aide who argues that wanting to be president is some sort of deficiency for a VP pick has no business advising a presidential nominee.

Thus, Biden, for all his flaws and shortcomings as a candidate, is our best shot at protecting those in danger and  the future of our democracy. Giving Trump four more years because you don't like Biden isn't woke or progressive.
But the alternative is four more years of Trump. Admittedly, I initially let my dislike of Biden cloud my judgement. While I never considered voting for Trump myself, I did find myself entertaining the idea of a second Trump presidency.
It's no secret that I don't like Biden - his policies are lackluster &amp; don't reflect my interests as a voter, &amp; after the sexual assault allegations against him, the thought of voting for him is physically repulsive. As a victim of sexual violence myself, this was a deal breaker.
Should former Vice President Joe Biden win the White House in November, America will likely be in for a foreign policy about-face as Biden reverses, dismantles or severely curtails many, if not all, of President Donald Trump‚Äôs most significant actions.

Enthusiasm gap will get bigger when Biden comes out of the basement.
No, they‚Äôd rather ‚ÄúWeekend at Bernie‚Äôs‚Äù Biden until he passes it over to the VP. Disgraceful.
You need to state what you plan to work on and contrast that with what Biden has already said he will do. The Dem platform is not what America wants but they are focusing on riots, covid, and divisiveness. It sounds like a daily DNC briefing every evening in the MSM.
Yes, for Joe Biden!
My presidential electoral history:  2004: G.W. Bush 2008: Bob Barr 2012: Gary Johnson 2016: Evan McMullin 2020: Joe Biden  #RepublicansForBiden
I turned 18 in 2002 and originally registered as independent. When Bush ran for re-election I decided I was a Republican and I remained one until shortly after the 2016 GOP convention. After a brief stint as a Libertarian I am now a registered Democrat supporting Biden.
I believe the dis honorable judge, has had screaming sex with an alien of unknown origins! Vote Biden 2020!!
I love you guys and Joe Biden
Naw bitch, there will be no delay.  I will scale Everest to cast a ballot against you.  Wait in line all day?  No prob.  Walk through glass?  No prob.  I will do what I have to do to vote for Joe Biden in November.  #Biden2020
üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ maybe Biden does have it together after all.
This isn't Biden
I realize he has zero power to change the Election Date and that would be a job for congress. I don‚Äôt hang on every tweet  or statement that he makes just like I‚Äôm sure you don‚Äôt for Joe Biden.
I hope this sexist bullshit backfires big time.  Some Biden allies wage a shadow campaign to stop Kamala Harris from becoming vice president
People laughed out loud at anyone suggesting that he'd ever try to do this. Biden included when he suggested Trump would try it.   The current President floated the idea of delaying an election he is projected atm to lose. How is ANYONE with any objectivity left okay with that?
I wouldn't vote for Joe Biden and furthermore you deleted over 34,000 emails have you left those poor soldiers to die in Benghazi you're Satan sister that is pretty low.
That's just stupid. I watch Biden speak fairly frequently. FOX would have you believe an unpolished speaker is two steps from a home. Stop buying in to that blatant crap.   You managed to ignore the entire point of this tweet. Want to address that or deflect again?
Folks on the Right tell me ‚Äúa vote for a third party is a vote for Biden.‚Äù On the Left they say, ‚Äúa vote for a third party is a vote for Trump.‚Äù No, a vote for a third party is a vote for a third party.

Hunter Biden is not running for president nor is he grifting America
In Florida, getting an STD vs not getting an STD would somehow come out 50.3%/49.7%. So if it's sitting at 4, I'm probably feeling good if I'm Biden.
Your boy Biden is in the basement, so there‚Äôs that.
I wish he was the radical left, because he is gonna be the next president and this country really needs a lefitst president. Biden is no leftist. The Democratic Party is center or center-right. Republicans are ultra right wing
Thanks?  Ps they're voting for Biden in November too üòâ
Biden: Illegal Immigration Makes The U.S. "Strong"...  via
Going out in a limb here and gonna say that Joe Biden is going to overwhelmingly win the female vote.  Just a hunch. Can't imagine why?
It's actually quite calm outside of TheProudSocialist Brie Brie or Krystal Ball threads.  Most progressives are supporting Biden. These jackals though... There's no hope.
So you think all women hate Biden.  Got it. That's wrong but at least you admitted you think it.
You're saying all women hate Biden?
Most who aren't are very easily voting Biden.  Evidenced by the progressive female in this thread vs the 4 or 5 Bros who want their student loans paid off and don't understand how detrimental to women's rights it would be if Trump gets to replace RBG.
No the implication is that things are worse for POC and women under Trump than they would be under Biden.  Thats fair.

Biden Gets Confused Again, Doesn't Know What Year it is: "In the 2020 Census, Which is Now Two Censuses Ago" (VIDEO)  via
Thanks for sharing SB! I have seen a lot of people propping up Biden with BLM, which is why I originally asked these questions. People do this with every candidate at every level (i.e. Christians propping up Trump &amp; McConnell) and I think more people should realize this.
But back in the day isn't now. What Trump rescinded literally came from an administration in which Joe Biden was #2.  Why even make such a remark?
You weren't going to vote for Biden.  And if someone being mean to you on Twitter would change who you voted for, then you clearly don't have any conviction anyway.
Strange, every single progressive always says they voted for HRC (after spending months shitting on her).  In a few years you'll all say you voted for Biden too.  Your lying is shameful.
Good thing they'd be covered under the Biden plan.
I am as well. I‚Äôm hopeful for change but I guess I have more of an attitude of ‚ÄúI‚Äôll believe it when I see it.‚Äù  I have a severe lack of trust in the two party system and am concerned that Biden will promise equality but never actually work to make changes in the current systems.
Do people really think that everything will change with one election after decades of inequality?  Is it not problematic that many white people have turned BLM into a campaign for Biden rather than actually seeking reform?  These are real questions, would love to discuss.
All of this can‚Äôt be done quickly so Biden should be prepared on November 4th to announce a complete reversal of all of it.
Considering minorities voted overwhelmingly for Biden... That's just factually incorrect.  Old-fashioned head counts... You mean basic democracy?  Lol that's idiotic.
So you guys don't accept plans, don't accept the time as VP... We are only allowed to submit policies that are more than a decade old Biden supported as a senator?  Thats an absurd standard.
And Trumps policy is anti-union. Anti-working class. Etc. Just read the policy itself, it's not hard.  Trump as also been in charge for 4 years so you can see his actions as well.  Biden has been a private citizen and anytime things he did as VP you all say "that was Obama"
If he gets a presidential Day 1, Joe Biden has a nearly endless list of ways to spend it
Opinion | Now we know why Trump sought foreign help to beat Biden
Opinion | Biden‚Äôs election will end national nightmare 2.0
Anyone with a brain could seee 45 "supporting" Sanders as a candidate was becuz they had ammo built up for that. It's either 45 or Biden. Win the battle to fight another day.
And progressives also didn't listen to the LGBT community who said repeatedly that they cared about married specifically.  Telling disenfranchised communities what is best for them is what you guys do best.  Ignore the LGBT community, ignore the black community (who voted Biden)
Biden supports a public option which has better polling than M4A.  And public support of a general idea of a plan isn't the same as knowing how to pass legislation.  There aren't 20 votes for M4A in the senate it would never pass.
Because overreaching leads to Trump.  Biden is where the voters are and that's how democracy works.
Biden is one guy, stuff like a single payer wont succeed because of one progressive president.  It has to be accepted in the fabric of the economy and it just isn't yet. You have to take steps. And you guys just don't understand that because you are impatient.
Historically that doesn't happen. It's why minimum wage goes up, civil rights improve over time, environmental laws become more strict, etc.  What sets us back is when we do things that lead to guys like Trump in office. (like shitting on Biden the whole election cycle).
Joe Biden‚Äôs election will end national nightmare 2.0, the nation‚Äôs second domestic debacle in two generations.  Opinion by George F. Will - The Washington Post

Russia is working to undermine Democrat Joe Biden
He puts the thoughts that have been swirling inside my head into beautiful paragraphs. This is true of the Biden/Trump race, as well. Biden was not my first pick, but he's the only choice if we are to build a better democracy down the road.
So is  working with Russia to denigrate Joe Biden?  traitorous pos
If you have to, would you wait in an 8 hour line to vote Biden in, to get Trump out?
Biden could literally pick an old broken table as a VP and I‚Äôd still vote for him before I‚Äôd ever vote for you
According to   everyone can attack Trump 24/7 BUT, Biden must be defended by MSN at ALL times. They know he is the weekest candidate ever and CANT defend himself.

It‚Äôs amazing the more racist stuff biden says the more support he gets from the people he insults . You ain‚Äôt black ! Latinos are diverse than blacks! Wtf . black kids are as smart as white kids, I don‚Äôt want my kids in a racial jungle the list goes on
Have you listened to any of Trump‚Äôs recent interviews?? I know this is pointless because you people will follow that POS over a cliff...Everything you are saying applies to Trump 10X more than Biden, there are endless videos and he is the biggest racist on Earth.
Quite frankly Trump is a raving lunatic + the antichrist. His cult is incapable of seeing through his deceptions and lies. In fact, the more you point out how evil Trump is, the more his cult defends him. They will tell you Biden is pro abortion while Trump has paid for abortions
üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ....more like the puppet master was supposed to pick a VP this week. Joe Biden can‚Äôt find his pants without help.

BOOM!!! THERE IT IS!!!!!!üòä  History professor who has accurately predicted every election since 1984 says Trump will lose
Oh yeah he was getting black people to come out against trump for sure. Nothing is worse than Trump is the truth and that‚Äôs why Biden‚Äôs just gonna win by doing nothing. It‚Äôs been his strategy since the end of the primary. It‚Äôs hilarious Trump can‚Äôt beat someone not campaigning
If you genuinely had a problem with Trump because of that, you should then have an issue with the DNC basically coercing an entire community to vote for them.  So yes, let them vote for who they want, even if it‚Äôs Joe ‚ÄúAll Black People are the same‚Äù Biden.
So is Biden. C'mon man!
What rights do presidents-elect have in the transition period? Could Biden have him evicted the first time he makes any move to stay beyond his ‚Äúterm‚Äù? Can Biden be sworn in prior to 1/20/21? Can Biden just go in n punch 45 out? Ok, kidding, but I wish. Don‚Äôt you?  SCOTUS HELPUS.
Looks like brain dead Biden is gonna get more votes off just not talking bc hiding in the basement is a better strategy than being a blatant idiot publicly

I like what you guys are doing and want Trump gone, but let‚Äôs quit bringing religion into US politics. No place for it. I understand Trump brought it up with his dumb comments about Biden, but those don‚Äôt have to be addressed with affirmation of Biden being ‚Äúa devout Catholic.‚Äù
Jory, I love and respect you, but South Carolina turned out en masse for Biden, with little to no help from the Democratic establishment, which turned the tides. Most voters aren‚Äôt dupes. I voted Bernie in 2016 but was not planning to do so again this year, like many others.
Well the Black Man shouldn't have asked Biden if he had taken a cognitive test; White males lead in mental illness's; so it goes both ways. Hispanics come in all races Blacks DON'T, Hispanics vote especially Cubans vote conservative, Blacks 90% vote the same. These are FACTS.
Trump Tries To Portray Joe Biden As A Racist | Morning Joe | MSNBC  via
I disagree with you. Biden wants Trade schools and accelerated programs for trade licenses,STEM schools and standardized testing doesn't work and isn't reliable studies have shown. My ACT score was 14 and I have a Masters Degree. If they went by my test scores i'd be screwed lol
To be fair, Abraham Lincoln would probably approve of Biden‚Äôs recent comments.
I love that my phone allowed me to type ‚ÄúBudens‚Äù and not ‚ÄúBiden‚Äôs.‚Äù
I think Biden gained it lol Trump calling it a BLACK vote lost me .
Really? This is sad at this point. Biden isn't president yet. Trump is and he has failed miserably. When Obama and biden were in office we had threats like this. Which were nipped in the bud due to government oversight
On top of that Hispanics come in all races, again speaking to the kind of diversity Biden was articulating.
When Biden said "With notable exceptions",  That's clear to me that he acknowledged that there is diversity in the African American Community it's just not as diverse as Latino voters who are different races and nationalities  .
Wait! Did you just say Trump has facts to prove Biden hates God + wants to take God from you? You mean the sinner who rarely ever goes to church and who never repents but instead plays golf is going to say that a man who prays to God every Sunday hates God? Go back to hell Bekee
Well if they say he didn't, then someone should tell the Biden campaign because one of his staffers tweeted out some half ass attempt at damage cntrl...I mean 'apology' about the remarks.
And Joe Biden is the King of getting rich off of his seat. He also makes sure his family gets rich. Shameful!
Haven't seen much commentary on Biden's use of the word "junkie"...anyone else see that as problematic? (this Tweet is not about Trump, so please don't "but Trump" in response) #medtwitter #treataddiction

Gonna get on the veep talk a little here, even though I won't be happy with whomever Biden picks. I do find it interesting. Everyone in contention has some obvious baggage except for one person. Tammy Duckworth. And yet she isn't considered a likely pick. (1/3)
Between Biden stridently opposing his own church's teaching on social issues and Trump saying Biden will "hurt God" (along with numerous other agitprop inanities) both are extraordinarily disqualified from being standard-bearers for the Christian faith.

Ye is going on ballots in swing states, which is strictly designed to help reduce the electoral count and hurt Biden. Trump's campaign is apparently PAYING for that. It is against federal election laws.

My husband and I saw a Biden ad tonight while watching the news on a Louisville station. Is Biden actually spending in red state Kentucky? I was hoping he would, since we did just elect a Democratic governor, but was still shocked to see it.
Biden is mentally deteriorating omg
Stick a fork in Biden he is DONE!
Goodbye America of trumps hello Biden!
I saw a Biden ad in Kentucky on a Louisville station, I hope it wasn't some weird fluke. We do have a Democratic governor, so even though red state, we do sometimes come together and vote blue. Also it would boost Amy McGrath's chances against McConnell.
We saw a Biden ad on a Louisville KY station. Is he doing random ad buys in red states too? I love it, because I feel like Biden spending here will give McGrath a boost against McConnell too.
Well there you have it, Biden is anti anything
We were watching the news on a normal Louisville station and a Biden ad came on! They have ad buys in KY! I had to double check it wasn't a national buy on CNN or something, nope, it's a KY buy.
Umm. Biden is also against energy. So.....
Do we need a debate to prove that? Just check the recent Axios interview. Debates are great for people with witty one liners and comebacks as opposed to actual policy discussions. Very little for Biden to gain imo
the fact people say Biden shouldn‚Äôt be president bc he ‚Äúsmells kids‚Äù (which yes is weird and he should seek help) but then they support Trump who has RAPED children and has ties to sex trafficking makes no sense
What a strong heartfelt statement. This is the man I know Joe Biden to be and it does my soul good to know that soon this is what the world will see from the US again.

I know Biden was nowhere close to being your candidate in the primary. I‚Äôm glad to see you recognize the stakes are so high that we can‚Äôt afford to vote with a ‚Äúclear conscience‚Äù for a 3rd party candidate or write in Wendell Berry (and I‚Äôve done that a time or two).
Biden has insulted the African American folks once to often. Pathetic. He constantly has to apologize. No more !!
I think I'd prefer no debates. Seems like that used to be a way to learn candidate positions but the internet allows us that info now. How is winning a debate important to being a good president? Trump v. Biden debate seems like an exercise in outrage/car crash porn for ratings.
Joe Biden wants to ban your last resort second amendment for self preservation especially if the Marxist Black Lives Matter"s defund the police garbage catches on.

Biden will not be the Dem candidate. But who will be?
Why? We ignored Trump's mental capability and look what happened. Biden is in much better shape... He took his SAT's and passed legally.
I‚Äôd wait in a 28 hour line and my vote won‚Äôt count for anything bc I live in a red state full of idiots.  But I feel that strongly about showing up and voting for Biden.
No not like the white liberal democrats who use black ppl every 4 years obama /Biden 8 years? Did nil pelosi , Schumer,biden,Feinstein all 45+ years &amp; did nothing for black ppl except keep them down in poverty in projects,look at murder rate in all democrat
Well. Obviously the most objective form of measuring blackness is whether you vote for Biden or not. A blackness scale brought to you by a white liberal saviour.
Sad that Republicans are celebrating a mentally ill Kanye West running for President just to sway African American votes away from Biden. Tells you that they know Trump needs help to win

Now? You mean always! Always with the crazy shit!  Biden is the one who goes to church every Sunday. President Dumbass is the one who only goes to church when he needs a photo op.
And twice on Sunday while Biden is at church honoring God and Trump is on the golf course honoring himself.
This is not sarcasm.  Biden may have stumbled with the argument, but he is basically correct.
Remember that this same faithless man in the same paragraph said that Biden would hurt God. Do not be fooled by the lies of this snake. He is the antichrist and is using weak minded souls for his evil purposes.
He is going to need Joe Biden after he is elected, better watch what he says
Obviously, I‚Äôm serious... Biden‚Äôs political beliefs contradict the Catholic teachings in MANY ways. That doesn‚Äôt make him a bad person. It just is what it is.
OK, don't give Biden too much shit over his gaff about 'hispanics have all sorts of different issues/priorities, AAs don't'.  In many ways, he is kinda right. For example, the Cubans don't flat out hate trump, but most others do.  The entire AA population of the USA hates trump.
Actually, he said Biden, ‚ÄúHurt God...‚Äù
I saw Georgia was in play too ? I think Biden can reclaim the rust/Big 10 belt but Florida will go down to wire
"Take the guns 1st, due process 2nd"  ~Joe Biden.
I don't recall Biden having people shot with tear gas and rubber bullets for a photo-op with a Bible in front of a Church he doesn't even attend.
I agree!  Biden thought he was being ‚Äúcute‚Äù - instead, he was crass and a bully.  If he‚Äôs not careful, he will become more obnoxious than Trump.  üò°
Biden keeps talking about racial communities instead of American individuals.
It‚Äôs important to remember he didn‚Äôt say Biden would punch God, just that he would hurt him. He might step on God‚Äôs toe or accidentally spill hot coffee on him. There‚Äôs no telling.
If Trump wins it‚Äôs Joe Biden and the Democrats fault, not the people who didn‚Äôt vote.
Didn‚Äôt you know, Biden has Thor‚Äôs Hammer.
Isn't that why the Catholic Church has denied Joe Biden communion?
The point isn‚Äôt to be   The point is to promote a celebrity‚Äôs upcoming project and/or ego that is fueled by an obvious mental illness based upon a bizarre and racist notion that Black voters think dude is a serious person.  So, yeah.  Per
What I don't get in terms of strategy is Trump saying Biden is essentially suffered end-stage dementia and can barely speak. He sets the bar so low for Biden's debate performance, that when Biden does just fine, Biden will look like a stable genius. The strategy eludes me.
Ur still completely off topic. If u don't like Joe Biden that is fine.
Whining about Biden /drug prices?
Biden has been refused communion for his stance on abortion. He is not a devout practicing Catholic.
That does not make anyone else less racist. This is classic whataboutism. I never brought up Biden. Whataboutism is a big part of what keeps inequity going ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
He says he wants to hurt Biden. Most Democrats are not that stupid. We see what he is trying to do. Depending on his BS he may pull  tRupers instead.
Biden is indelibly racist at heart.
Great. Now I can‚Äôt stop thinking about Kratos with Biden‚Äôs head photoshopped onto him.
hot damn. vote biden 2020 #JoeBiden2020

Joe Biden places American lives before tRump lies.
Trump ad portrays Biden as weak because he prays.   ‚ÄúI have been driven many times upon my knees by the overwhelming conviction that I had nowhere else to go. My own wisdom and that of all about me seemed insufficient for that day.‚Äù - Abraham Lincoln
‚ÄúMy opponent can hurt God‚Äù makes Biden sound pretty badass.
I broke down and went to the site just to see what this is about and I'm starting to agree with their thoughts that Biden is skeet skeeting all over the Bible.
Black lives matter has already donated Enough money to Biden .
Crazy part is...Trump doesn‚Äôt know that. He just thinks saying Biden hates the Bible will excite his Evangelical base. But he doesn‚Äôt completely understand why.
Having a hard time understanding why this is an attack on Catholics?? I‚Äôm Catholic &amp; nothing about the wording offends me... Also, why is nobody talking about Biden - a devout Catholic - being beholden to the Pope?? Wasn‚Äôt this a huge issue with JFK...
Biden will mop the floor with the Trump during the debates. I can‚Äôt wait for the debates to begin. Dementia Donnie will not be able to keep up, as his last 2 interviews were evident. How much you wanna bet Trump will bow out of the debates come election time? He‚Äôs such a coward.
They are embarrassed to support trump and want to appear concerned about what he is doing. They say they won't vote for him again, but they are obviously looking for an excuse. Biden's VP choice is a deal breaker? Seriously? Just shut up and vote trump. Biden doesn't need you.
That‚Äôs so kind of Trump to buy Biden a new plane.
tRump claims Biden is 'against God' and will 'hurt the Bible'

Biden was denied communion because he supports abortions so he isn‚Äôt religious in the eyes of his church!

Not that this is or in any way should be a prerequisite for holding office, but Biden is a devout Catholic. I‚Äôm doubtful the eradication of religion is anywhere on his agenda.
You are a joke!  Biden May claim to be Catholic but he is not a practicing Catholic!
The tax issue is separate from ‚ÄúRussia‚Äù. Only the Dems tied 1 into the other..ridiculous statements should be treated equally and we certainly don‚Äôt have that in the nationwide media today...same goes for Biden‚Äôs racial African American words he used..the CJ won‚Äôt even touch that
I‚Äôll say this, a lady in my book club thought she was about to die and Biden called her and talked to her for like 15 minutes just out of the goodness of his heart. I‚Äôm excited to have a person like that in the Oval Office again.
ü§£ü§£ü§£. Biden in a debate setting will be the highest rated program in the history of tv
Wouldn't it be fun if Biden could time his announcement of his VP to step on Trump's latest effort to be the Total Focus of news cycle.
So....trump is a agent of Russia with no proof...proven made up lie and I didn‚Äôt feel the outrage from ya there...now an outrageous statement against Biden and here comes the critique...doesn‚Äôt seem 50/50 there
Just so we‚Äôre clear, are you enthusiastic about Biden?
Joe Biden...obviously a racist
Wasn't there an SNL skit where a radio talk show host gets increasingly outrageous to try to prompt people to call in? Reminds me of the increasingly ridiculous rants of POTUS. Now Joe Biden is "against God?"  There is no bottom with this man. He will always go lower.
Yo if Biden is powerful enough to "hurt God" then maybe I will have to vote for him.
It's a very funny play on words that rolled off there.   Too bad Biden's racism isn't equally as funny.

A particularly interesting part of this poll:  is polling 3 points higher than  among Kentucky voters in who they think would do a better job addressing racial inequality.  Trump leads Biden by 9 points in this poll and won Kentucky in 2016 by ~30 points.
I didn't realize Biden had that level of superpower. Impressive.
So Trump just announced in his speech in Ohio that Biden is against God. I'm voting for Biden because Trump is the Antichrist.
I heard Biden was gonna punch God in the butt.

Biden was against abortion before tRump ever was.
Good context: if Biden wins by 15 nationally, as their national poll shows, McGrath will keep it close.  I think it's definitely possible!
I‚Äôm always scared off by a puppet in charge. Biden may as well have strings hanging off. Don‚Äôt think he‚Äôd even notice.
Many people are rightly mocking Trump for claiming Biden will "hurt the Bible, hurt God."   But instead of criticizing Trump, let's ask ourselves: How will we help God today by being co-creators of the just world that God envisions for us?
Obviously Kentucky isn‚Äôt that close, but it does make you wonder if Biden can win back Obama ‚Äò08 counties in Eastern KY...
I'm not joking and I've said it multiple times: They *literally* have nothing else other than to tell you that you just didn't hear or see what you heard or saw. Antifa is a myth. There are no riots. Joe Biden doesn't have dementia.

A Biden / Trump debate will sound like a bowl of spaghetti-o‚Äôs being read aloud
I am sure he meant ‚Äúmuch like‚Äù Even if he thinks that sentiment. He would not go on tv and say it. This election will be of old dudes who can‚Äôt read and misspeak a lot. The difference is Biden will surround himself with qualified people and not cronies like Trump.

I'm not sure I'm following. Biden has agreed all along to three debates. No waffling at all on the subject. That seems reasonable to me.  It is true President Trump was initially reluctant to debate, but he as changed his position on that.
Nah. I'm over pretending that Joe Biden has a shot. I can't say what will happen downstream but I have a hard time seeing the Senate flip, too.
Are we still pretending like this guy has a shot?
the day biden is sworn in - the day! - you're gonna hear the republicans get religion and scream about the debt, the deficit, the poor economy, and unemployment (which they caused). See 2009.  It's the same ole tired game plan.
So how is re-electing Trump the answer? Btw, I'm not voting for Biden either. We have a choice between 2 old Democrats. I will vote 3rd party again. This country has decided that truth, justice AND morality no longer matters.
But a pic of Joe Biden with his daughter is flouted as something evil? Disgusting? Goose...Gander? Pot...Kettle? And...then there's... Mmmm...real creepy.
Medicare4All has been on my agenda for a very long damn time, but we are stuck w/Biden &amp; I'm doing everything in my power to see him elected. If Trump wins, this country will be irrepairably destroyed. + no other country will let us flee there bc we are plague vectors. Fuck that
Joe Biden Is a Racist! I wish every Black Person would realize this. He doesn't care for them, he just expects their vote. Look at who he ran with back in the day. Wish someone could find his KKK membership card. Trump has, and will continue to do more for Black American's.  üá∫üá≤ü¶Ö

I'd rather people go to 538 and look at win probabilities than look at a poll that shows Biden with a 8% margin and assume it's over. Or, listen to some pundit and decide it's over. Or, listen to psychic pets and decide it's over.
Yes. Trump has to go. And I want Biden appointing federal judges instead of Trump.
But it's happening now! Not in a Biden presidency, in a Trump presidency! Socialism is happening now! Chaos is happening now! And it's because Republicans have settled for less for years.

I‚Äôm going to vote for Biden because he‚Äôs not a narcissist, blatantly racist human. He will listen to his advisors and appoint people that will actually do their job. And if you‚Äôre seriously calling Andy a dictator for trying to save lives, you are part of the problem.
#TrumpDeathToll160K and Rump's push to kill people by opening schools snaps me back no matter what Biden says or does.  Biden could become The Streak (Ray Stevens) and I'd still recall that Rump wants teachers, other school personnel and their families dead.
Democrats moved farther left but picked Biden over Bernie and Warren?
One campaign spreads disease like a horseman of the apocalypse.  The other respects our health, putting it over electoral considerations.  Which one will you vote for?  #GTCBlue  #gtg2020

Joe Biden learning from Bloombergs mistakes.   1. Big ad spend 2. No real life talking
A load of crap from Biden, the Democrats, and so many  Americans biased by the media.
How does the Biden campaign fix this?
Oopsie! Biden already said on camera he HAS taken a cognitive test. One of those answers was a lie!
I hope this at the same time acknowledges Trump is a far worse option. I know every critique of Biden doesn‚Äôt need to refer to Trump but it‚Äôs important in context.
I see Joe Biden took over  Twitter for the day.

ü§£Trump has been asked to take a cognitive impairment test. He has definitely lowered the bar for the presidency. Trump can remember 5 words in order. Biden will have to skate by on his lifelong government service.
JESUS CHRIST HAS BIDEN PICKED HIS FUCKING WHATEVER YET IT‚ÄôS AUGUST
Next thing you know Trump will challenge him to a game dodge ball or something.
Trump has to be frightened like a lost child at the thought of debating  on the national stage. He'll be asked questions he can't answer and have to watch Biden actually answer everything asked of him.
If Biden won't listen on policy when he needs our votes, he ain't gonna.

Oh good let's throw this in the big pile of "reasons Biden's gonna lose that couldn't possibly be due to  incompetance" along with the Bernie Bros, Russia, etc. Meanwhile the Biden campaign has ZERO ground operation anywhere.

Oh but which word and at what moment. Not even Biden would do that. Strump
I think the confusion may be this phrase: "I am not committed to naming any (of the potential candidates), but the people I've named, and among them there are four Black women," Biden told MSNBC's Joy Reid on "The ReidOut."  Among them, meaning, including, but not limited to
I agree. And this is not a decision that can be made hastily. I might be wrong but I feel Biden's Vice President is going to play a much bigger roll than ever before.  He must choose wisely and as deliberately as he can. I will trust his judgement and support his VP choice.
Well, it looks like Minnesota paid the price for their ignorance. Look what it has done to a once beautiful downtown and ....‚Äùsafe city.‚Äù So sad, but there are many happy revolutionaries and anti-Americans who will be voting for Biden, Ilan Omar, AO Cortez, and Rashida Tlaib.

Ms. Harris I support you and Joe Biden but please be careful of BLM, they are now making demands and trying to extort $$. That‚Äôs not what the party is about.

I am ok with the fact that there are some people who won‚Äôt vote for Trump. But for the love of God and all things holy, please don‚Äôt vote for Biden.
Biden‚Äôs campaign should try to get this interview seen by as much of the country as they can. If u can watch this interview and say, yep, that‚Äôs the guy I want in the White House, u have problems and u yourself are a major problem for the country, just like this man-child.
Predictably the GOP is suddenly concerned about debt because they‚Äôre going to be defeated and they‚Äôre leaving an economy in the toilet. They‚Äôll spend the next 4 years obstructing everything Biden does, because of debt, and block anything that stimulates the economy.
At this point the "Joe Biden is losing it" feels like his version of the Trump effect.   Lowering the bar for him so when he does sound presidential (which is obv often) it's like every time pundits say Trump has a "new tone."
100% of the "Joe Biden is losing it" attacks are in bad faith, but they should all be responded to with this, which is obviously a basic slip of the tongue but also makes him look even stupider than usual.
All I see is everyone talking about Obama turning the Joe Lewis funeral in to a Biden campaign rally. Who the hell gets up and give a round of applause at a funeral. Also saying Trump trying to suppressing votes was misinformation.

The Biden vacation is so close these people can taste it.  Kick up feet, drink in hand, White House press releases slapped on front page.....ah, so relaxing.
A must-read. I see Biden as more than even a "place-holder" for "transition," but actually as a sort of mask. This mask that is Biden -- the image of a "known" and "safe" "moderate"-- is the cover for the radical Left that intends to take power if he wins.

It's closer to it than what Trump wants. And even if they were the EXACT SAME ON ISSUES, I would still vote for Biden, because Biden doesn't pander to White Nationalists and Supremacists and doesn't exhibit as many fascist tendencies.
Oof you are REALLY pushing it. Maybe, they are more or less the same on trade, possibly foreign policy, but it's nonsense to say that they are the same on healthcare. Trump wants to completely toss ACA, while Biden wants to expand it to a full public option. Is it M4A? No, but
You're delusional.  But so is Georgie. Many people of many races made this country great. Biden can't articulate a thought.  Protestors have become nothing more than terrorists.  Enjoy the second term.

No. Actually it‚Äôs not. Obama and the rest of the DNC elites made sure all the candidates dropped out of the race and to endorse and coalesce around Biden. If Biden wins - I guarantee you will see those candidates in his admin. They‚Äôd rather Trump be president instead of Bernie.
Dem and Repub party presidential candidates suck. Biden fog brain. Trump "he didn't come to my inauguration" ego.  We need better choices.  #TeamSomewhereInTheMiddle
When people wonder why Biden isn‚Äôt doing more in public right now, this is why. Trump can‚Äôt keep himself from sounding like he doesn‚Äôt know what he‚Äôs talking about. It‚Äôs almost weekly. If he tweeted less and did less interviews, I think that would have forced Biden to do more.

And Trump says Biden can't speak coherently? I would be surprised if he didn't do it so often.
Because Biden is better than Trump. We have to work for change within the system before we can throw the system out. Getting Biden elected is the choice that will get progressives closer to their goal, even if just marginally.

Many of your answers have been commented on. Apparently you have not been following the news, so I will fill you in. 3 debates per tradition are planned starting in September. Biden has been out on numerous occasions and given detailed plans on many subjects. He does web casts 2.
Insert Joe Biden! Duh! He has represented African Americans his whole career! Oh wait..
Lol. If that is the worst 10 things Biden has done, he looks like a saint compared to Trump.   As for the picture of him whispering in the ear of the woman, at least he didn't grab her pu**y or rape a 13 year old and 23 women.
Relatively speaking, the Democrats are more persuadable.  At any rate, the pandemic response from Biden would be more based on science and less on Rump-grade whim.
They are concerned about a debate because Trump will turn it into a lie fest and Biden will spend most of his time refuting the lies. Trump is a con man plan and simple. Always has been and it works. Simpletons hang on his every word. Biden is looking forward to the debates.
I think Biden should just refuse to debate Trump at all. I don't think he'd lose a single vote.

The burden of proof is always on the positive point. All I have is absence of evidence with regard to Biden, but with Rump, we have plenty of it. So, it's prudent to choose Biden, as we don't have a reason to believe he would govern that way.

I know all the bad things about Biden.  I'm under no illusions.  But Rump is much worse and he's going to have to go, or the next 4 years destroys the country.  I wish other progressives could feel the alarm.
There are no positive arguments for Rump.  Biden isn't a fascist (positive) and he would deal seriously with the pandemic (positive).
Arguments like that can be made, but that still makes Biden easily the more prudent choice.  We certainly want fascism kicked to the curb, and we want this pandemic seriously dealt with.
Did Biden forget his teeth?
Against fascism, I would hope voters would choose a pile of turds or anything not fascist.  Biden is far from perfect, but he's not an authoritarian and would indeed seriously deal with the pandemic.
We need a Presidential debate with the other party candidates on the stage to work over Trump and Biden on live TV.
Biden has to put in more effort he can't expect votes to be handed in for nothing! The American people need something in return.
I get progressives railing against Biden on policy &amp; saying they wish they had a better choice, but after Rump's fascistic displays, I don't get not voting for Biden. We'll have our day on policy, but we have to get rid of Rump. I'm not playing when I say our country is at stake.

Surely Biden's immediate staff realizes this is not an option.  The smarter play would be working to convince Rump not to appear. Rump has his own set of fears - play to those and push him to make an excuse not to appear.
There are people who will vote Trump no matter what and people who will vote Biden no matter what. All propaganda aside, if Biden pulls out or refuses to debate he loses. Period. End of story. And it doesn‚Äôt matter what the excuse is.
A few more months. We just have to hold it together for a few more months. This isn't 2016. Bernie is campaigning for Biden. Please let's find common ground and get rid of Trump. Let's not let the Russians divide us again. We can go back to fighting after the election.

Biden/Pickle Rick 2020!
My visits last week to Texas and Frorida had massive numbers of cheering people gathered along the roads and highways, thousands and thousands, even bigger (by far) than the crowds of 2016. Saw no Biden supporters, and yet some in the Fake News said it was an equal number. Sad!
Even if it's a landslide for Biden, the change to a new president doesn't happen until January 20.  So I expect Rump to spend most of his time during the transition feverishly pushing orders and otherwise working out deals to reduce his criminal legal exposures.

That's an ignorant reply, as Hillary did beat Rump in the popular vote.  Polls however are sometimes too late to capture what happens in the final several days of a campaign, however, and Rump had the edge in a few key swing states. Biden is enough ahead of Rump to win.

Won't happen. If it were an election with Michelle as Biden's running mate, it would in effect become Donald vs. Barack. That would be a rout in Trump's favor. No contest whatsoever. Of course it's likely that Trump will win anyway, but her as the veep candidate would cinch it.

Biden Version 1995 couldn't get 1% of the vote in Democrat primaries back when he was only dumb but not senile.
It really doesn‚Äôt matter. No one is asking our opinion. Biden gets to choose, no one else.  I‚Äôll vote for him no matter what. And IMO so should everyone else.
Joe Biden ? Child fondler Biden? Sniffer Biden ? No billion dollars if you don‚Äôt fire the guy investigating my son Biden? Loony tunes Biden ??????
I didnt write the article and you havent been anle to dispute 1 thing with facts. Joe Biden, is that you?
I think this guy is voting for Biden. A perfect representation of the left. So is this the new American citizen if Biden wins?
I absolutely agree with this. I truly believe Biden hasn't put enough effort in to pull in Bernie supporters or swing voters.
That makes no sense. And Trunp didnt call covid a hoax. You people just dont like facts. He in fact started acting while dems and fauci and WHO was still saying it WASNT a crisis. Pelosi and Biden said he was wrong to implement bans on people coming into America
I‚Äôm still convinced that  is going to be on the ticket. I have listened to Clyburn talk about what Biden‚Äôs running mate needs to bring to the ticket and that color is not the most important thing. Clyburn saved Biden and probably has more clout than any other advisor.
The only disagreement I have with his policies!
I have never thought of myself as a marketing strategist. But Trump lowers the bar so much, I know I could do it. I know exactly what I would have Joe Biden do at his next campaign event. He will be using in front of everyone (and pass out samples of) his own brand sanitizer.
Donald Trump today:    ‚ÄúIf you elect Joe Biden I will go to prison.‚Äù
Spoken like a white suburbanite who has a job and health insurance, and doesn't give a shit about anyone else. You're fine with big money lobbyists, endless war, corporate welfare, austerity, and fossil fuels.  These are all issues Biden is wrong on. You'd make a good Republican.
Democrats in the Senate have confirmed dozens of Trump's judicial nominees.  Biden more or less helped get Clarence Thomas on the high court. RBG isn't the liberal darling on the court that you think.
Biden helped get Clarence Thomas on the SCOTUS.  Also, Dems in the Senate helped confirm Trump's judges 35% of the time.
My daughter just got $10 for losing one of her baby teeth. Instead of buying something for herself, she decided to give it to the Biden campaign. Trump may have his corporate buddies, but Joe, you have people like my little girl. Win for her!
No. Of course not. This party only wants rightist anti-Trump voters. The rest of us can kick rocks. So be it.   Don't come knocking at my door when Biden loses. As a socialist, I don't owe you my vote.
Keep praying....
It's not entirely clear most Democratic voters did choose Biden.
"Let's criminalize those who grow and sell that Mary Jane, because of how I feel. No science necessary." ~Biden, 1995. Whoever is running Biden's Twitter is missing the mark hard.
I'll remember this tweet when Biden loses and you spend another four years blaming his loss on Bernie Bros, Russia, and Susan Sarandon.
Day of election in 2016 hillary up by 16%‚Äôthe only way Biden wins is fraud ! Mail in ballots! I‚Äôll volunteer to work polling place ! And be fair

But Biden does leave his basement. He occasionally goes to Pennsylvania. So near, yet so far.
I don't think they are concerned with Biden, If they keep the house and flip a senate seat or 2, then impeachment 2.0 here we come, we are seeing GOP infighting in TN and other states, that just opens up the races, like AL in 2018
I logged on here and thought it was a joke that Donald Trump said there would be no more hand sanitizer if Joe Biden was elected but I should know better by now than to think that
I will vote for Biden no matter who he picks. But why isn't this getting more attention? Someone who admires L. Ron Hubbard and Scientology as VP? What's going on? Is everyone afraid of Scientology? Come on... Seriously?
This is not shocking after seeing the arm holding video from last week. Jill Biden should have ended this months ago.
Liberal fundamentalism make people think a ham would be OK.   It really wouldn't.   Think about it... Would it be OK if Biden were to pick Paul Ryan? Or Candice Owens, a black woman?? Or Stacy Abrahams, a woman who picked Atlas Shrugged as a personal favorite book?
He was correct when he came right out of the gate. He mentioned the power center for Biden is the radical left. AOC, Omar, etc. Next Wallace tries to push back using RC polls showing Biden ahead. Jason correctly refutes the polls. That's just the first 2 minutes. Jason killed it.
Please explain to me   and senator duckworth how obama or biden would hace done more?   wouldnt have even issued the reavel ban and obama would NOT hace shut down economy in an election year. You all are lying sacks of ... And you know it!!
Not to mention Joe Biden is the true racist,not Trump.
Unfortunately while it is very disappointing it is very much not at the unexpected circumstance. I will be voting for Biden this year. But I am not happy about the lack of Healthcare in the United States.
If this is correct, and they can pick anyone. How about Hillary Clinton. That freakout the entire republican party both elected and MAGA's. Although Biden is the logical choice.
And as proof ^ Biden has been racist his whole life. Trump only became president after he ran for President on a Rep. ticket.
#1 He endorsed Andrew yang a few months ago. Btw anyone can put a meme together saying anything.Biden is on tape wanting more blks in jail so his kids arent raised in a racial jungle  #2 Its 1 thing for some loser to indorse you,its another when you are the one endorsing the evil
Does Joe Biden know where he is???
What is up with the people obsessing over Biden's pick for VP. It's like y'all are trying to fuck up his momentum. Get over it. We'll find out when we find out.
Well, you could always opt for Joe "vote for me or you ain't black" Biden. But that would make you a dog-faced pony soldier.
They are currently among Biden's campaign advisors.
Sure he will. Stop gaslighting me. Biden is the one that doesn't know where he is &amp; is about to fall over. ü§£üòÇ Trump looks the same as he did four years ago. He looks great!
They have 3 debates scheduled and it's a democracy tradition, so I don't see that happening. Also, Biden wants to debate him as Trump has a terrible track record and Biden has a great plan put together for the future. If there were no debates, I will still vote Biden on morality.
You don't even know what those words mean.  Biden isn't remotely Marxist.
Biden is a mess!
No it‚Äôs because Biden has DEMENTIA
Something both Democrats and Republicans can agree on. Get rid of Birx, she says what is politically expedient instead of sticking to the science. The rats are jumping a sinking ship, Birx is trying to save her job with a Biden administration. The Republican party is going down.

if Democrats don't deliver on progressive priorities. It won't matter that Biden isn't running on them. Progressives aren't playing any longer. We'll get Trump out, but then it's all-out policy war.
I think Biden is going to be elected, but he and the Dem establishment might be surprised by a couple things after he takes office: 1) #BLM isn't about Trump and the protests won't magically stop. 2) Progressives won't turn out in 2022 and 2024...

30 million people lost their jobs. They‚Äôve lost their insurance. And it‚Äôs pathetic that $600 extra is more than what a lot of people make working. Servers in a lot of states are still making $2.15 an hour. It‚Äôs been like that for 40 yrs. Biden: ‚ÄúThings won‚Äôt fundamentally change‚Äù
Many more would have died if Biden would have been in office. His family gets paid by the CCP. Also, almost a third of those deaths could have been prevented. Cuomo is responsible for 10s of thousands of those deaths (nursing homes). Plus thousands more didn't really die of covid

The same can be said for Biden then correct?

I hadn‚Äôt read this, but I‚Äôve been suspecting that this is their game plan. Wreck the country as much as possible so that Biden (and possibly Congress if Dems take the Senate) have to focus all their time on that while GOP spends two years blaming them for it not being fixed yet.

I get this is screaming into the void but I'm a white male from Ohio with no active plans to vote for Biden right now, I am almost spot on the target demo for this move, and I think it fucking sucks. Somehow Democrat pandering to Ohio makes me so much more distant from the party
As a retired carrier, I ask ALL postal employees to support and vote for Joe Biden. Joe has always supported the postal employees. Joe has ALWAYS had the support of the Firefighters Union. He is one of us. Can you HONESTLY say that about Trump???????????? No you can't!!
I‚Äôm actually sorry man, I saw her face and it doesn‚Äôt look good. I‚Äôm just so used to blatant political posts and took it as one. My bad, just skimming at it.both parties have garbage candidates. Biden is just as corrupt
No, what I‚Äôm saying is that with a 7-2 far right Supreme Court, $15 minimum wage is impossible for a generation.  Even if Biden doesn‚Äôt get it done, you can primary him from the left in 2024 and get it done then.
As a retired letter carrier, I ask my brothers and sisters to fully support the Biden/ Harris team. For YEARS we have heard that the GOP wanted to privatise the PO. That time has arrived. Your jobs REALLY do depend on removing Trump from office. Vote Dem on Nov 3rd.
Of course you endorse Biden. Your jobs depend on him winning. The Clown in Chief is destroying the USPS. The Postmaster General isn't helping with his ridiculous demands regarding routes, sorting and delivery. As a customer, I want my mail. I like &amp; support my carrier.
Recent loss of liberal followers and biden supporters. Good. :)

You mean the deal that‚Äôs not even a deal? The one Israel said yesterday wasn‚Äôt really a peace deal. So he lies about it being an actual deal, then lies some more about Biden trying to take credit for a deal that isn‚Äôt even real. Sums up trump &amp; the republicans pretty well.
Trump can't win a free and fair elections, he's trying to sabotage the postal system. Laura Ingraham is a pathological liar. Obama never tried to discourage Joe Biden from running. We are currently in pandemic to save lives mail-in voting the only way out. Cheaters, scary tactics
Either Trump or Biden is going to win, and I know Trump/Republicans will change things:  - make abortion illegal - outlaw gay marriage - make it harder to vote - deny climate science  Biden might not move your causes forward as much as you like, but Trump will set you back 30 yrs
Joe Biden doesn't even know what day of the week it is. The only science he knows about is when he urinates his Depends.
biden is gonna win california? just cancel the election, he‚Äôs already won.

That‚Äôs a funny/good analogy because Biden looks like a bad version of Bobby barker.
Biden has literally been moved left since the primaries ended. Which never happens, nominees usually tack to the center after they get the nomination. Joe asked Bernie to help him set up working groups to draft new plans, which include the $2 trillion climate one.

This race will be between Trump and Biden. A third party vote will be lost in this election. We need every Blue vote who is interested in saving this country, our constitution, and our democracy. This is a fight that we must win for our country.
I agree with her 100%.  Biden, Harris and DNC are deeply flawed and must be taken to task if elected. But current situation is pre-apocalyptic fascist hellscape. Got to stop the bleeding first and foremost.
A no vote for Biden is not a proxy vote for Trump. A no vote for Trump is not a proxy vote for Biden. Our vote has to be earned.  Neither candidate has offered any policies to better the lives specifically for #ADOS.  The "1st black women" VP candidate doesn't count for anything.
Earlier this year, Kamala Harris said she believes Joe Biden sexually assaulted Tara Reade. Now, with much alacrity, she has accepted the offer to be his presidential running mate lol. Harris is a textbook careerist.

Stop falling for the "the stock market will crash if Biden gets elected" narrative. Check out how well the market did with Obama/Biden from 2009-17. Not saying that's all because of them, but acting like our 401ks will be fucked with a Dem in office is a blatant scare-tactic.

W respect, you get we're in the middle of a Pres campaign where Trump's character is driving many Republicans/indies to Biden, yes? This is someone else who saw him up close (Mary Trump, Bolton, etc) sharing his character. It's anything but meaningless

Indeed, but they‚Äôre missing the point.  Those who oppose masks are just fine with sacrificing any potentially saved lives to their cultural identity/world view/comfort zone.  That‚Äôs what Biden/Harris need to be calling out directly.
Hilarious to me that he uses disgusting Biden quotes bc we could write a mf book on his racist, misogynistic, sexist statements. For fun we will add a whole chapter on lying. Ppl talk about all the good he‚Äôs done in his term but he doesn‚Äôt ever highlight that for some reason.....
You know what‚Äôs crazy.  That Trump and Biden are even eligible for presidency.  Both are obvious traitors and criminals.
No thanks, I‚Äôm voting for life, liberty and democracy‚Äî I‚Äôm voting for Biden/Harris!
Imagine feeling so scared and insecure that you‚Äôre okay being told how to live your life. This is why Biden could win. Too many people want to be controlled.
Biden isn't our President,President Trump stop flights from China, but he couldn't stop the virus. Because of his recklessness and incompetence 170k Americans are dead and 6 millions affected, and constantly telling dangerous lies about the coronavirus and undermining the process

Of course they answer yes, especially today when contrary opinion gets you assaulted. Now ask them if they favor a national mask mandate that results in fines as Biden will direct. Big difference.

Biden/Harris will strengthen int'l terror groups w/ same Obama cash on a pallet approach. That $$$ funded Hezbollah. Hezbollah likes to fire missiles to US bases in Iraq. Trump got their General (Soleimani). We can't throw money at terror groups.

Clearly Biden and Harris are far left.  Their statements and voting records confirm.  Cobb has to support them, if not, she's not black.  if not, she's not a woman.  If not, she's not a democrat.  paraphrasing Joe Biden's own words here.

Buck, 3 months at least is what he said.  What else is in about 3 months.  Just a ploy to use in his campaign.   He will continue to say Trump does not care.  JoKe Biden is at it again!
I wonder if Democrats realize, if Biden wins, the surge to remove him will begin almost from the day he takes office, and it will come from within his own party. BLM and Progressives are not going to let a dottering old white guy stand between Harris and history.
i understand that and i respect that, but i‚Äôm not sure bieden will actually end fascist policies created under trump. children are literally still in cages yet i don‚Äôt think biden will change that practice. wealth is accumulated through exploitation.

Biden definitely, completely picked a female VP.  People voted for Trump because they hated Clinton... "it's a man's job" was a terrible terrible excuse so they didn't have to explain why they didn't like Hillary.
Hopefully Biden will reach out and actually try to talk to Ice Cube and many others like him and truly listen to what they say. We all know Trump won‚Äôt.

Personal opinion on the Biden VP saga: His team screwed it up from the start. There‚Äôs no way for him to make a pick that unifies factions. The roll out is botched before it starts. It‚Äôs lose-lose for him. He doesn‚Äôt have savvy people doing this. Beats me as to why that is.

Biden is winning in the Polls!! But I guess not with the American people! U  know where to stick those POLLS!!!
You all realize that Biden is on record stating that he wants to kill Social Security too, right?  There was a whole conversation about this back in the primary.  Remember the primary?  Trump is a goon and needs to lose, but don't pretend Biden is on our side.  He's not.

You completely missed my point. Shame really. Biden is in no way capable or qualified for that matter to be president. Only someone greedy&amp; power hungry would accept the VP nomination. Male or female but she happens to be a female.
Mark Nickolas must do digital for Biden as a side hustle.

And? How often have we heard Pence speak the last 4 years? How often did we hear Biden speak as VP? Spend half an hour listening to McConnell garbling into a mic, or Cruz whining, or Trump rambling; none of it is pleasing, but a voice is a genetic factor you can‚Äôt control.
Don't let a single liberal get away with co-opting the term "leftist."   If you tell people to vote for Biden, you aren't a leftist.

If anyone thinks voting Biden is going to save America, they're the problem.
Yes. Many have argued that Biden is more likely to be influenced by direct action than Trump, and so you have to vote for Biden, etc.  They fail to grasp that regardless of who's in power, the only way to influence people who only care about money is to attack their money.
I love how the people who demand you vote for Joe Biden also argue that the only way to get what needs to be done done is by direct action, but under Biden.  I wish they spent half the energy they do voter shaming on actually organizing direct action instead...
Yes, I'm a tankie for *checks notes* not wanting to vote for Joe Biden because that only legitimizes the government power structure by giving the system power and then demanding it does my bidding, whereas I'd rather just organize to tear the whole fucking system to the ground.
Why does the CA ballot have ‚ÄúVice President Joseph Biden‚Äù?  Shouldn‚Äôt it be either ‚ÄúFORMER Vice President‚Äù OR ‚ÄúSenator‚Äù since there is only 1 VP? Any protocol experts  out there?

As long as Kamala keeps talking about him I am sure he won‚Äôt let her accusations go unanswered. Plus if Biden gets elected he won‚Äôt be there for long. I think the dems know that. He is just a prop.
Frida.  The point is Biden has 40 years for experience.  Trump can‚Äôt even win an Emmy for his reality TV show.   63% of Americans can understand this basic concept.
He has threatened to block every bill if Biden wins. So what else is new?
Smart move by both Biden and Buttigieg.    Pete resonated in Iowa, and gets to keep his name out there, and Biden can take advantage of Pete's good-will in the community.
Has anyone had more practice running for President since Henry Clay than Joe Biden?
I haven‚Äôt seen the numbers but maybe more people voted for Trump than Biden is because of all the other candidates on the Democratic ticket. A lot of people still voted for who they liked white T got all the Rep votes. What were the totals? D vs R?
don't think that aoc needs your help.  in fact you would be more helpful in helping  organize a strike, or being a high profile proxy to  and defend her by calling out joe biden.  those are two things that you could do to reach out to progressives.
Agreed and if Biden steals the election I have a feeling that the country will be split wide open and we‚Äôll see riots and major properties of major cities burned to the ground. Most people are unwilling to live under communism, real or perceived.

Are you really sure? And when they do, what kinds of questions will be asked? I assume you've seen the few times Mr. Biden has been questioned it's been mostly softball. Not to mention, there's been a document released from the dem party with a "how to" question Ms. Harris.

I also feel the need to clarify that my original tweet isn't equating a third party vote with a vote for Trump. I'm specifically referencing the people who are choosing not to vote, or choosing to vote for Trump just because they don't like Biden.
Trump supporters aren't worried about Biden.. just like they didn't worry about Hillary. The democratic party in a civil war would be funny.. clueless adults (kids) that have yet to grow up..
So Biden paired with a more liberal Congress is going to be a lot better for the country than Trump with any kind of Congress.
That's an understandable opinion, but that's not really what I was going for with my tweet. Biden sucks, yes, but Trump poses an active threat to the lives of many. Being able to ignore that because you don't like Biden is a position of privilege.

Matt, you are completely wrong with this. Biden is 78 years old with rapidly diminishing mental capacity, Kamala is not just VP choice she will be the defacto President at least within 2 years.. Like her or not With Biden, this pick is huge..
I still think Biden is going to win big, but Biden is definitely doing everything he can to cost himself the  election so I'm not as certain now.
That's funny.  Look at the multiple crises left by Obama-Biden. Difference is they created crisis, Trump is undermined by nature and infantile lefties acting their emotional age. #leftylies

Yes. Again, political commentary from pundits. It will be Biden vs Trump.

No one is telling you not to vote for Biden. We're simply saying that we aren't wasting our time with it, and we're sick and fucking tired of assholes hounding us over it.  If you want Biden to win, pressure his campaign to better appeal to us. Otherwise, leave us the fuck alone.

If there is a presidential debate (which I doubt) it might be the most watched show of the year.  Biden will forget where he is and who his running mate is and Trump will continually talk about how this will be his third term and how huge his two previous wins were.
This dude. A literal non-chess piece bishop from Rhode Island does not know Biden is Catholic and went on ahead and popped off. I‚Äôll let y‚Äôall extrapolate whatever you‚Äôd like.
Guys it's okay. Biden can have Kamala as VP and you can still be ACAB heavy. I'm looking at it as "okay prove something to the people. Do good by them and for them. Or go down as another shit stain of a politician and make ACAB beliefs stronger".

MAJOR coup for Nancy Pelosi, Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos and Mark Zuckerburg......a slap in the face to the Clintons and Obamas (they needed Rice as vp).  Biden will resign within six months and Harris will be President with Pelosi as the puppet master.
Kamala seems like the best option on Biden‚Äôs short list. She‚Äôs definitely a better pick than Rice, who has terrible baggage, an unpleasant personality, and has never been elected to anything.

Flashback: Kamala Harris said she believed women who accused Biden of inappropriate touching  #FoxNews
Apparently, Tucker is endorsing Biden.
If you honestly believe that Biden picked Harris for any reason besides identity politics, I want you to know that the word "gullible" is written on the ceiling above you.
.  Biden's father was a used car salesman. Mystery solved. #LyinBiden #PutThatInYourPipe #Patheads

honestly anyone who donates to biden instead of investing in local on-the-ground community work is a total mark who values spectacle over material reality
Biden Harris is better than Clinton Kaine, but oh boy do we still need better.
Biden &amp; Harris:  No-Knock Campaigning
We'd guess that Biden is already making up his cabinet even though he hasn't yet won the presidency. He needs to move quickly as soon as he is sworn in. The country is in need of some competent leadership. Kamala Harris is a good choice for vice president.
Kamala Harris chosen as Biden‚Äôs VP.   Amy Klobuchar‚Äôs staff hardest hit.
Yeah.... Biden/Hitler definitely doesn‚Äôt get my vote...
What do you think of Biden's pick? MORE &gt;&gt;&gt;
Opinion | Biden needed a running mate prepared to serve as president. Kamala Harris met that test.
Yes, and in the same breath he called Elizabeth Warren and Joe Biden names. Irony is just another thing that trump has destroyed. #TrumpIsANationalDisgrace #TrumpVirus #BidenHarris2020
I‚Äôm not voting for Biden. I wasn‚Äôt anyway, but I‚Äôm deciding not now. üôÑ
So Biden (instrumental in the drug war and crime bill) nominates a bulldog prosecutor known for aggressive tactics at a time people are in the streets protesting over policing. Cool cool.
When did Biden say not to play?
I'm not sure I was hoping for anyone in particular that Biden would have realistically chosen.
BTW, you can be genuinely disappointed in Biden picking Harris without being a sexist asshole. And you can recognize that this is the lesser evil while being rightfully enraged that we keep being asked to choose a lesser evil.
And no moral principles. Colbert cornered her on her vicious racist smears on Biden. Her answer? "It was a debate, it's what you do." This is Matt's use of a good VP?
Stacy Abrams has stated she will still accept the nomination for VP, giving Biden an out if Kamala gets upset with him sniffing her hair
I cant wait to tweet Biden and Harris WIN!
Well with Biden you never know. Ok, you do always know.
It'll be so much better when President Joe Biden is the one you see walking in.
Not sure I had any "hopes" with Biden. It's more that in the midst of a national reckoning with police violence and mass incarceration we have a lifelong prosecutor in the VP slot.
Wish we had Biden of '08 of the VP debate against Palin.
Just in case you're out there thinking about writing how "dems just aren't excited about her" I AM FUCKING ECSTATIC ABOUT THIS VP PICK
Hillary was always within the margin or error, Biden is not.  I know you won't understand this but there is a big difference.
Trump is ridiculous.  He calls a church going Biden, a man who "is against God."   Plain stupidity.
so  do you still believe that biden is a racist, and do you believe the women who have called him out for being a creep? #Metoo ?
Latest polling indicates 20% of respondents say they‚Äôve NEVER heard of Biden VP pick Sen Kamala Harris. That‚Äôs more than 60 million Americans üò≥ think  about  that  for  a  minute ü§î #KamalaHarrisForVP
Joe Biden selecting Kamala Harris is kind of like the halftime show where people jump off trampolines
I really hope there was some kind of sophisticated political calculus behind Biden's pick of Harris for VP, because I am having a hard time figuring out which relevant swing voters she is supposed to attract.
I‚Äôm a voting ass dude so Biden will get my vote but damn I will be dragging my ass to the ballot.
I love Bernie but I hate when he puts the nation before his progressive agenda. We know you ain‚Äôt for this Biden shit.
I'm so excited! Biden &amp; Harris can make America America again.
Agreed ... once Biden took over the race, this was the most likely outcome
If Trump loses, GOP recalibrates, looks for someone who didn‚Äôt go full #MAGA. (Mitt Romney will be as old as Biden is today...)  If Biden loses, Harris joins Kaine, Ryan, Palin, Edwards, Lieberman, Kemp, Stockdale, Bentsen and Ferraro as losing VP candidates never seen again.
Anyone not bothered by Trump's grotesque mishandling of the COVID-19 epidemic, his racism, criminal acts, childish behavior etc. isn't going to care one iota about who Biden chose for his VP.
This Dem is sad and disappointed. Warren was the one. Harris is ok but she does not excite me. Biden made the safe, predictable choice.
1) UK will have maybe their best team in decades, if not ever. If we we were ever going to do something funky with Ohio State do it now. Why not?  2) Not my first choice but I have no issue voting for a Biden/Harris ticket. Sign me up.
She stated publicly that she believes Biden's sexual assault accusers, and called him a 'vile racist' on a national stage one year ago.ü§¶üòÇ
Did Joe Biden ask #Copmala to get that work done to her face? Was it not sniff worthy for him?
But you said you prefer action, a Biden Harris admin will take actions to stop the exact abuses that Harris committed! Another Trump admin won‚Äôt
Harris was a pretty easy choice for Biden. There was tons written in 2016 that decreased African-American turnout cost Hillary. If you think Harris will boost that number she totally makes sense. Biden and team guessing record won't matter. Right? Who knows. But not a crazy pick.
BIDEN READ THE ROOM BITCH
Bet? I'm all in Biden wins. I'll give you odds.
Alot of people on the left don't like it because they want another Bernie-esque person to be VP, they want further progressive. I like the pick, I felt Biden needed a heavy hitter and more well known candidate than Rice (more baggage) and Bass.  Also Kamala going to shred Pence.
With prison/police/court reform being at the forefront of America right now, Biden could not have picked a worst candidate.
My first pick over Biden!
YAHOO!  Congratulations!  Great pick,  !!!! BIDEN/HARRIS2020

Biden‚Äôs VP could be a newborn kitten and I would still vote for them
I would not. I dont think all that highly of Biden. I believe the DNC picked the worst possible person
Remember, Republicans are helping West try to get on the ballot - in order to drain votes from Biden.
Unfortunately young progressives already busy bashing Biden. At a guess will be equally harsh or worse with VP. I wldn't have picked Biden either but I get how it works. So will support him &amp; whichever running mate. And I'd like to smack the next one who "okay boomer"s me...
Why didn‚Äôt we just nominate a strong woman (person of color or not) for the top of our party‚Äôs ticket in the first place?!?! Threatening Biden over his VP pick now isn‚Äôt a good look. ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Is Biden really gonna pick Cameltoe Harris as a running mate? üòé  I meant Kamala!
And Biden is impaired? Give. Me. A. Break.
The Clintons left office in debt because of all the costs associated with the blue dress scandal. They wrote books.   Obamas wrote best seller books and had speaking engagements  Biden has been frugal with his money, and has pensions associated with his public service.
I feel like there are better options than Bill. Also noteable would be R‚Äôs for Biden.

It's not goofy things alone. But it's visual decline. Nobody can look at him and say he is as good now as he was 4 years ago and that's fine. But he starts at such a lower cognitive spot than Biden so his decline is markedly worse.
Again, I dont disagree. Anyone at that age is not better with time. But again, comparing Biden to Trump when it comes to cognitive decline is not an argument you want to be making if you are Trump. Biden starts from a higher point and Trump's decline is visually measurable.
I would disagree but to compare any level of cognitive decline between Biden and Trump is not an argument I'd want if I were Trump.
The hill this goes down has a much deeper and much worse end for Trump than for Biden. We all know this.
So you are attributing to Biden  what is apparent in trump.

Oh ok actually I just figured out how Joe Biden could get me to vote
Oh my gosh! Look at Steve Kornacki's "Road to 270." He's got Biden at 334 and Trump at 125
An incompetent President could not accomplish the things Trump claims Biden will accomplish (in a negative sense). It‚Äôs one or the other. Or, does he think Reps are so weak that even an incompetent Dem could do anything he wants? It doesn‚Äôt make sense. Maybe it‚Äôs not supposed to.
Trump is trying to simultaneously maintain that Biden is too senile and incompetent to be President, and that he was will be successful in implementing his ‚Äòdastardly schemes‚Äô that he will erase religion, guns, police, and prosperity from the US. It‚Äôs nonsense.
If Biden manages to hurt God that would be quite the accomplishment üòÇüòÇ
Biden is a practicing Catholic and he is "against God."  Oh sit back down.
Who will you vote for if you don't like Biden's VP pick?
Honestly, and this is saying a LOT, I would rather have Hillary than Biden.  You don't even have to pull some "her e-mails" shit, you don't have to say the magic word "Benghazi," you just put him on TV for a minute and he can't help but out himself as another senile old racist.
So obvious... By the way Biden prays in church... That he hates God...
I‚Äôm Joe Biden and we‚Äôre rollin out
Every time the right says some negative shit about Biden, I can't help but be like "Yeah, we already knew that."  Truly, the unity candidate.  Everyone agrees he sucks.
We'll of course he'd say that!  Trump thinks he's God, so naturally Biden is against him.
Hey  My feed is full of the video and people calling out Biden but "Biden" isn't trending.. You still controlling the feeds? Biden is a Racist and you're hiding it! Wake up America!!!!! #Election2020  #BidenIsARacist  #Trump2020

If this doesn't scare people, I don't know what will. For progressives who are ambivalent about Biden, I should remind you that Justice Ginsburg won't live forever. If you want long precedented cases to stand, VOTE TRUMP OUT.Do you think one of those parallels, long experience and relationships in the Senate, gives Biden‚Äôs legislative agenda more legs than Obama‚Äôs had. So much, I guess, depends on the party composition, but that was always a knock on Obama‚Äôs admin, that they struggled on the hill.
I think the author doesn‚Äôt understand that Israel will always be supported by the US, but it‚Äôs obvious Harris and Biden will be less supportive than Trump
President Trump answers dozens of questions daily from a hostile media.   Biden and Harris have answered no questions from a friendly media since announcing the ticket.   Could it be they have no answers to our countries problems?
Simple, if you're voting for Trump, you only vote once.  If you're voting for Biden, vote as many times as you like.
He is racist. My black friends and neighbors definitely are not all the same. They aren't all Biden voters either. Of course Biden doesn't even think they are black if they don't vote for him.
‚ÄúTrump is our last hope!‚Äù ‚ÄúBiden is the only way to heal this nation.‚Äù  Me: ‚ÄúHave you guys heard of Jesus?‚Äù ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs eternal and conquered death. He‚Äôs God incarnate.‚Äù
What is sad is my black neighbors are scared too? I hear all the time how they want the police here. But, we all know that there won't be enough of them and our Mayor and Governor want the violence. Never let people like Joe Biden tell you all black people are the same.

I have to assume this dam will break eventually. It's unsustainable. I'm fine with team Biden playing prevent defense for a while, but he'll have to make the rounds eventually, and this really raises the stakes for when he does. If he doesn't ever, of course, that should cost him
Ooo, sweet burn, bro. Even tho Biden and Harris gave speeches 2 days ago, the day after he announced Harris would be his VP. Not in his basement.
That‚Äôs his point I think. If Democrats start acting like an opposition party for once they‚Äôll  beat him pretty handily. 2 1/2 months should be enough time. Just don‚Äôt let Trump, who‚Äôs willing to run left of Biden on issues to win, actually run left of Biden. I would love to 1/

The progressives lost already. We don't have a dog in the fight. Bernie is working hard to get Biden elected. So am I. I want M4A badly, but the 2020 election isn't going to get it. Protest vote is going to make things worse-solidify Trump's power. Like it or not it's Biden.

Joe Biden is definitely senile.
I am more/less on the same page as Cornel West. I'm not endorsing Biden-Harris, but I am voting for them. One of the top orders of business we progressives/leftists have is anti-fascism. And that's why we're voting to remove Rump. But we're not done once Rump is gone.
Not even Biden is pretending like he's going for a second tern and has basically saidbas much, I know he said he "isn't ruling it out" but he pretty much has to say that.  Every indication is that he will serve one term, if that.
I listened to future president Biden. Not one time did he say any of this! Wake up America our President is a narrassis liar.
It is hilarious to me every time a Republican cites the current situation in America as a reason not to vote for #BidenHarris2020. Hey morons, that‚Äôs WHY we want to vote for Biden!
Only if trusted Medical Professionals agree that a vaccine is safe.  If Dr Fauci agrees I will.  I trust Joe Biden as well because he will listen to Fauci or other trusted Medical Professionals.  When Trump has his "October Surprise" and announces a vaccine, the answer is NO.

But neither Biden nor Harris are socialists....? What are you going on about?
Biden got angry when Trump began shutting off travel a little at a time as the Caronavirus first spread, in hindsight he says Trump was too slow to act. Which is it Slow Joe ?
Another term of Trump destroys what's left of the country, so we progressives won't have anything to fix at that point. We're just going to have to suck it up and install Biden. And we'll have to hound him into the ground.

Do you not understand that Trump will REVERSE ALL THE PROGRESS WE‚ÄôVE MADE. Maybe Biden won‚Äôt push us forward, but he won‚Äôt openly bring out racism and fascism as well as dismantling USPS, Medicare, social security, national parks, etc.
I agree in sentiment, but this election is different. Trump is openly dismantling all the socialists progress we‚Äôve made. He‚Äôll see the end to Social Security, Medicare/caid, libraries, USPS, publi utilities and LGBT+ progress. A Biden admin wouldn‚Äôt do this.
We need to vote out Trump this November. Vote Kamala and Biden and we can at least have the possibility of moving the country left. Without them, Trump could do unknown atrocities. People advocating AGAINST Biden/Kamala are doing so from a place of privilege.

People are fools to hold the President responsible for the economy, post Pandemic. If we want to get back to where we were, we better vote Trump. It's crazy to let China destroy our country in order to get Joe Biden elected. It's definitely what they want. Say no to China Joe! üá∫üá≤
I‚Äôm not backing Biden or Harris, but it‚Äôs time we become realists.
And you know that how? Do you have proof?  Just keep talking guys with unsubstantiated bs he‚Äôs going to get the elected it doesn‚Äôt matter who Biden has as a vp all that is way to the left I am American and plan on stayi ng that way!
so do you believe Biden's accusers or not?  Oh that's right, the #MeToo and #believeallwomen movements ended when  got the nomination.
I did the same a while back, I even un followed some people because following them had Biden and others popping up in my timeline constantly. And while we get bored/distracted truly NOTHING else matters but Christ and witnessing to the lost. God's got the rest under control.üôè‚ù§Ô∏è

He needs to hit the campaign trail (basement) with Biden. He‚Äôs the Grim Reaper.
Welllllll, Biden did say everyone should wear masks for the next 3 months with no explanation and took no questions. So that's kinda leadership.....if you're a fucking idiot.
Biden is a transitional candidate don't expect too much from Him Harris and who she chooses as a Running mate in 4yrs is where the Medicare for all conversation begins shes for it ! .Biden will step down after 2-3yrs more than likely ..
What... Do you you have a hard time understanding that with Harris and Biden we're moving closer to Medicare for all even if it comes from the next president after Biden . But if Trump elected we'll move further RIGHT as a country and won't get Medicare for all PERIOD!
No shit but Biden will do 2-3Yrs and hand it off to Harris, the next president will be able to be more progressive after that . It's a slow progression .but if Trump is elected then no we'll move further from Medicare for all. Does that make sense ?

And before you say "uh vote him out in November," remember that he is trying to make that completely impossible. What are you going to do when he steals the election? Are Biden/Harris gonna give some weak concession speech and ride off to collect speakers' fees?
It is lame. The more they attack Harris the better off Biden and Democrats are. It will not sour non-white voters who already see Trump for the racist pig that he is. Ultimately, attacking Harris will look like misogyny and turn off the white suburbanites Trump covets.
I'm as left as we can get, but I'm pulling for Biden/Harris just like I pulled for Clinton/Kaine.  I like our chances this time around. I'm not trying to win the world-- just trying to get my foot on solid ground.

Here‚Äôs an idea, if you feel meh about Biden and Harris but want Trump out, slow your roll and maybe Biden will actually make an effort to campaign.
Retweet have Biden and Harris use this song for campaign videos.
This may be premature, but if Biden gets elected, we need to seriously push our govt to pay the first lady. I'm sure Mr. Kamala Harris is nice, but I know some fool is gonna wanna give him a First Man salary in 2024, and if that happens we will rage! #FLOTUS #PayJill #paygap

You are so wrong. Biden will straighten out the mess you have made with our allies while you cower to Putin. It‚Äôs so strange how you admire and fear Putin at the same time . N Korea  has more weapons since you entered office Iran closer to a nuclear weapon. You‚Äôve made a mess!!!!
How many women has  fucked, abused, attacked &amp; paid off to win be POTUS?Ask yourself that  Last count was over 20 with 2 in lawsuits with him right now. I pray  pulls the same stunt showing America ALL 20 on national TV like Trump did w/Clinton
Why not just say "if Biden gets elected the world will blow up."? More fear is produced and it's just as big a lie as any of the others he tells.
I don't want to see either of them.  Both are abominations.   But, I feel trump is far worse.  He is worse as a human being, he is worse for the nation, he is worse for democracy.   I don't support Biden because trump is worse.  I don't support Biden period.
Yeah but with Biden being sick do you really want this loser to run our country??

If Donald Trump‚Äôs gambit to defund the post office so we can‚Äôt have mail-in voting fails, he will slash the ink budget so there isn‚Äôt enough to put Joe Biden‚Äôs name on the ballot.
I think the Biden campaign wishes the You Ain't Black episode would go away, but this kind of 'support' for the campaign extends that message. I don't understand your reference to a 'messenger' but I do know Mr Arthur. He's not posing or playing a role.
The best gift Biden gave Trump was picking this POS as VP.
Thing is you guys have alienated good people within your own party. I have lifelong conservative Republican friends here in Kentucky who will not vote for Trump. 4/5 are voting for Biden.

Totally true.  However, I think one of the left's principles is anti-fascism, and we have a fascist to remove from office. After we accomplish that, we can be as harsh on Biden as we so choose.
Biden can't talk

Anyone that falls for this Biden/Harris narrative that our economy is a wreck because of Trump's handing of the China Virus is ignorant. First of all, our economy was the best ever, before the virus. 2nd, our economy is coming back quicker than anyone thought.

Biden said he was going to serve only one term. She is in line for that top job! üíõüêù
I think because our economies have a symbiotic relationship, there will never be s war between China and the US. I do think they need to open the country more to foreign investment. If Biden becomes president, he should stay strong on them, and force them to open their markets.

We have bigger issues Biden/Harris2020
I just watched Biden/Harris and it was so refreshing to hear two people who can speak so well while expressing their thoughts. It took me back to Pres. Clinton and Pres. Obama. Instead of numb nuts...
5. Neither were my absolute top pick for President or Vice President. Today‚Äôs speech did help me get excited for the ticket though. The Biden/Harris ticket seems to have more energy and charisma than the Clinton/Kaine ticket.
While Biden and Harris did let Trump have it, they also gave ideas on what a Biden Presidency night look like and I was on board with having a Biden Presidency listen to the scientists about Covid.
As evidenced during the VP debate in 2016.   3. Both speeches from Biden and Harris were empathetic, detailed, and tough on Trump when needed.   4. Clinton was criticized for focusing her campaign on solely being the anti Trump candidate.
I need that....To hear someone speak that is really capable of leadership. We are hungry for that. No lies and pulling a rabbit out of his ass like somebody else I know. Preach Biden  and K Harris. We can not deny the fact that that news briefing was right on point
A few things from Biden and Harris‚Äôs speech today.   1. They have great chemistry together. That was something I didn‚Äôt think that Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine has exactly.   2. Harris will be an attack dog VP candidate. Kaine struggled with this role
The gaslighting and ignorant ‚Äúreasoning‚Äù my parents are trying to provide on why Biden/Harris is better literally makes me want to vote for Trump JUST so they lose and I can throw it in their faces. (I won‚Äôt, but that‚Äôs how mentally unbalanced I‚Äôm feeling.
2/7 To some, Harris is problematic because her police record doesn't conform to burlesque standards of an acceptable constabulary, and Biden's Senate record categorizes him as a "racist" since he once dared to question the wisdom and utility of busing children.
1/7 The Democrats have quite the wrinkled shirt on their hands. According to Biden, Harris isn't Black (and according to the standards of the left, she is and is not at the same time). According to Harris, Biden is an abuser of women (and an enfeebled man).

I‚Äôve never heard as many lies, sexism and racism on Fox News as I did during the Biden/Harris press conference
Let me help your out Eddie while you are making a fool of yourself
Don can't take this. If Biden does one of these a week, the Cheeto pimple will pop.
If you think Biden is in a mental decline then it‚Äôs obvious that Trump is in full blown dementia at this point.
Biden on racism: "My father used to say, 'Silence is complicity.' Not original to him, but he believed it."  ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
How wonderful listening to Vice President Biden and Senator Harris. These two are inspiring. Caring thoughtful, intelligent people. What a difference from the trash in the White House now. #BidenHarris2020 #nastywoman
JoeBiden: Working families need someone on their side...because they certainly don‚Äôt have anyone on their side with this president.   That‚Äôs going to change in the Biden-Harris administration.
Harris just said it‚Äôs a honor to be with Biden. Just during the primary she called him a racist.  ü§°ü§°
It‚Äôs so refreshing to hear some one that‚Äôs actually Presidential. In the 5 minutes I listed Biden has restored my hope that we will survive this pandemic and racial turmoil as a country.
Shame on . for not showing the Biden/Harris event live. All the other major stations are. Minor league guys. Minor league.
That was as good a Biden we‚Äôve seen so far.
Joe Biden sounds like a President.
Hi Lily and pals!! You watching Biden and Harris?
And... Trump has always been completely respectful of Biden???
‚ÄúHispanics, unlike blacks, are a very diverse people.‚Äù - Joe Biden 2020
‚ÄúNothing will fundamentally change‚Äù -Joe Biden
doesn‚Äôt it all depend on what Biden said? the portion of the clip she claims he said wasn‚Äôt shown.
You all watching Biden and Harris?
I am over the whole group. I am going to try my best over the next 3 months to not waste one more minute giving them my attention.  Henceforth my energy and time will be used to get Biden et al into the WH.
Basement Biden and Caretaker Kamala
Here we go!!!!  Biden/Harris 2020!!
what do you believe will get worse? like even the covid response, I would have so much more faith in a biden administration dealing with it than a trump administration. trumps literally tryna force kids to go to school rn like thats fucked
LIVE: Joe Biden, Kamala Harris make 2020 debut
Okay I‚Äôm here for this Biden/Harris presser but the music is wearing me out
Uh huh. Every single republican I‚Äôve met has said they don‚Äôt like his rhetoric but hate the dems and will vote him anyway. They‚Äôve been conditioned that dems (even Biden) are trying to turn the country into the Soviet Union. I‚Äôm not sure why there‚Äôs a modern red scare??
that's interesting. trump defunding Obamacare has resulted in over 20 million people losing healthcare and 5 more million since corona. trump doesn't even have a health care plan while biden is proposing a public option so everybody would get insurance. thats not better?
Wait, so Democrat politicians and MSM can attend school but students can't? Biden Harris first appearance taking place at Dupont high school.
biden at least has a plan to decriminalize drugs which would make mass incarceration a much smaller issue. trump pardoned a couple black people and now he thinks he's done more for black people than any other person ever üòÇ
Exacly! Joe Biden/Harris is strong ticket. They actually gave the experience to run the country .
Given all the vitriol I see aimed at the Biden-Harris ticket, all I can say is, America is fucking doomed.
No Vote for Biden .

WATCH LIVE: Biden And Harris Give First Joint Remarks As Running¬†Mates
Initial response to Harris' selection from the right has been to drag out all of her more extreme policy takes over the years. That's fair game, but I suspect they overestimate how effective they will be when she starts cleaning them up and sounding more in tune with Biden.
One of Harris' biggest problems in the primary was she didn't know what policies to support (see MFA debacle). She's not an ideologue, she wants to position herself to the electorate. Being a VP candidate will suit her. Aligning to Biden will make her stronger as a candidate.
Your point is what, that Biden picked the right person? I agree! #BidenHarris2020
But if that man wins again, there won't be anything. This country is at a tipping point. The disenfranchised have already been feeling it. I had no intention of voting for Biden, that Tangerine Farquuad showed me I have no choice when he gassed protestors for a photo op.
I honestly think so, Biden was leading in every poll without her, she'll only boast the lead for JOE and it shows that we're moving in the right direction, the ticket seems like change . I wasn't going to vote for Biden but I will now .
I will never fully support the Biden/Harris ticket, but my vote is going toward them. The stakes are too high.
I'm voting for the Biden/Harris ticket as well .
Oh I'm voting trump. Im not voting for the mentally incompetent joe Biden.
Well if Biden and Harris win then a Bernie like person and or policies will be at the top in 3-4yrs
Let the games begin! Biden/Harris 2020!
Goes straight to Joe
Basement Biden and Caregiver Kamala
Basement Biden and Caregiver Kamala
In your dreams, but Biden and Harris are looking back at you in your nightmares.   Better wear those depends so you don't pee on yourself in bed
If that is who you want for President  because we all know Joe Biden can't do it then know people who can laugh about jailing parents like this mom they can do anything. She isn't better than Trump. She will be harder to fight with all those libs sleeping like the fools they are
Translation:  I think I can take attention off Biden/Harris because I'm a little baby
But you never gonna find a perfect candidate.  I wasn't for Biden or Harris. But I sure as hell am not voting for the incumbent. And not voting basically is a vote for him.   Let me know when you agree with any politician on every policy and every decision.
Biden don't know and Harris Blows!
If this presidential election proves anything It‚Äôs that everyone needs to stop voting democratic and republican bc both parties are shit and fuck all that this is better than 4 more years of trump, like great 4 years of Biden and Kamala.ü•¥ü•¥ü•¥
Here's the thing: If the Harris pick pushes you to vote for Trump, you were always going to vote for Trump. That the Dem VP nominee would be someone with views like Harris is not new information. I don't see how a Biden-Harris ticket is somehow worse than a Clinton-Kaine ticket.
Biden deserves the free air time.  Trump is using taxpayer money in ‚Äúbriefings‚Äù to attack Biden anyway, why not take the stage and just say what your plans are, and ignore the drunk at the end of the bar.
Kamala Harris be like   "Vote for biden you niggers"
Why would Biden pick a progressive?
Uh huh you skipped all the people that Biden and Harris have put in prison with their policies, which is a hell of a lot more than 160,000.
They couldn't have Grimmace Bitch and Moan on how the Georgia election was stolen from her while Biden and Harris are trying to steal this election.  Hypocrisy only goes so far.
we could always overthrow the government like we been saying üôÑ but y‚Äôall too cap for that convo... so vote Biden you pussy niggas.
When the rest of the world realizes we're just printing money and stops using us as the base currency, the resulting fall will make the Great Depression look like a day at Disney. Trump doesn't care about this. Biden won't care about it. But you should.
I don‚Äôt get all into politics like that and no candidate will ever have every thing on your checklist but y‚Äôall really keep talking negatively about Biden and his mate, which will give Trump the votes. Y‚Äôall know y‚Äôall don‚Äôt want that man in office another 4 years.
The "I think we should shoot protestors" far right thinks crime bill Biden and copmala are far left as we march off the right side of the cliff.
I‚Äôm hoping Biden will nominate you to be his US Secretary of SHADE because üëë #BidenHarris2020
Wow... When did Tucker join the Biden-Harris campaign? I don't think he's going to convince very many of his listeners, though. ü§£
Yes, because we're moving further towards a progressive candidate. The next vice president or president will be a progressive Sanders type but if Trump gets 4 more years his son will run lol and we'll move further right .so..The Sanders supporters like myself will vote for Biden
No,Biden and Harris will make America Better!!!
So Joe Biden‚Äôs entire policy is just a UNO reverse card. I‚Äôm good with that.
When the alternative is strengthening Trump's power, the choice is obvious. The bar is set very low, and Biden has sailed over it. The Democrats are our only hope to beat Trump. I can't handle 4 more years.
I would fire your campaign manager if he thinks it‚Äôs smart for  to run on Joe Biden being a racist üòÇüòÇ Go back to killing black people and calling them names under your ‚ÄúLaw &amp; Order‚Äù This nurse and #suburbanhousewife is voting Biden/Harris!!

‚ÄúFox News‚Äô Chris Wallace: Trump Wishes Biden Had Picked Anyone But Kamala Harris‚Äù FOX News

None are credible or they‚Äôd be in court. No matter how many times you repeat ‚Äúracist‚Äù, it doesn‚Äôt come true. On the other hand, Kamala herself believes the allegations against Biden and called HIM racist ü§°
Idgaf Kamala Harris and Biden can disappear. Id be damned if I vote for some mf just cause you foundationless niggas tell me soüòÇ y‚Äôall be voting out of fear‚Äî that‚Äôs some sorry ass shit.
Agreed but I also think that‚Äôs why Biden got the Dem money.
Suburban. ‚úÖ Wife. ‚úÖ Lives in house. ‚úÖ VOTING FOR BIDEN. ‚úÖ‚úÖ‚úÖ
You continue to spew centrist talking points ignoring all context.  Bernie's wealth is a very recent thing and it hasn't shaped his policy. If anything he was further left leaning following his first presidential run.  Biden crafts Jim Crow policy.
He also donated to Joe Biden
So you saying Obama/Biden didn't cause thousands of deaths? Or do only American lives matter?
According to the right, Joe Biden wants to defund the police which is exactly why he picked Kamala Harris, a former prosecutor and "top cop," for his VP pick.   Joe Biden is playing 15-dimensional chess to dismantle the police from the inside. The man is a mastermind
A vote for Biden is a vote for Trump because regardless nothing will change
Biden &amp; Kamala - one sucks, and the other blows.
I hate the guilt trip game. It‚Äôs a false ass statement by people who are uncertain their candidate will win.  Not voting is not voting.   Voting 3rd party is voting 3rd party.   Voting for Biden is voting for Biden   Voting for Trump is voting for Trump.  End of discussion.
Forces in the country, and within the Democratic Party, were indeed pushing Biden toward a history-making pick.
For some people, getting back to "normal" is the priority. They are 100% fine with Biden/Harris enacting Trump/Pence policies, but dressed up in 2020 DNC rhetoric. The quiet parts will be quiet again. The text will return to subtext. All will be well.
Historic Photo: Biden asks Harris to be his VP
As someone that lived through it, Biden was right to oppose forced busing. MAGA
Y‚Äôall save your anti-Biden shit for AFTER the election. Otherwise? You‚Äôre doing Tr*mp a favor. This includes retweets too luv
Think of how depressing it is to be a biden campaign staffer having to call some bullshit like family first, usa united super PAC and ask for 300k that goes to  for like a tweet a week and two rally appearances
Plus... I don't remember Biden announcing that he would be hiring someone based on their race and sex. I DO remember him saying that African American women were among the people he was considering.
This white woman ain‚Äôt voting for him! Biden/Harris has been the ticket I‚Äôve wanted since she opted out. She‚Äôs the bulldog he needed and I cannot WAIT to see her tear Pence a new one in the Veep debate.
"Biden will help deliver a massive climate deal that will generate real jobs. Trump repealed or rearranged every environmental act he could find."

Mitch McConnell campaign press release says Amy McGrath supports the "radical" Biden-Harris ticket, adding "If elected, these Three Political Stooges would lurch our nation to the left and usher in a new era of socialism in the U.S."
Everyone is talking about how Biden needs to win for the Supreme Court but he‚Äôs probably going to end up nominating a conservative justice to promote unity and then you guys will keep moving the goal posts to gaslight progressives ü•¥
I really got beef wit everybody that voted for Biden in the primaries y‚Äôall and y‚Äôall candidate can eat a dick
I used the word 'season'. I think most would use 'era'. I think season is the correct word, as my suspicion is that to end the era, stop it from becoming a major turning point, the oligarchy intentionally choose Harris and Biden.
It amazes me how often Republicans can over look the lunacy that trump says and does. I can over look the stumbling speeches. The cognitive decline. The physical decline. But joe biden cant form a thought. You keep telling yourself that lie
can't wait for Biden to further explain the tremendous diversity in that community.
Yeah, lol, I know what you meant.  Can't change the past, wish I could.  All I can say is, Biden has pledged to reverse all of those policies begin reuniting families, and end detention in the first 100 days. It's on his website.  I mean, that's what we all want, right?
The entire thing is just very hypocritical and tone deaf, and with Biden‚Äôs track record with unintentionally insulting the Black community, it makes me wonder if this was a blatantly calculated tactic to have her as VP.
This is what he REALLY wanted to type: White Women will be voting for me. They want safety and lord knows they don‚Äôt want Black people or People of Color in their community. A vote for Biden means BLACKS!!! Be afraid be very afraid!
And that‚Äôs great but his campaign desperately needs enthusiasm. For those that really think electing Biden will make a significant difference in this country I can‚Äôt figure out 4 the life of me why they arent donating endless time and money like the unprecedented Bernie campaign.
Biden said he would serve only one term. I interpret his choice as setting her up for the big job. Always possible I am being wildly optimistic, but I am picking that hill to die on.
Just a reminder, final Hillary/Trump odds were ~68/32.  Roughly speaking, if this "game" was played three times, Biden wins twice and Trump once -- just like four years ago.  But now Trump is in a lot more control of how "lucky" he can get on Election night.
Nope. They'll be voting for Biden &amp; Harris. You've already defunded Social Security &amp; Medicare &amp; want to gut them. They're general welfare items under the Constitution (Art I ¬ß8 Cl1).
I am 1000% sure Joe Biden has said, ‚Äúand trust me, I have A LOT of half black friends‚Äù at least twice in the last 5 years
Adorable puppies.  Biden/Harris2020!!!
y‚Äôall think biden can beat trump? lol ok
So they differ in their devotion to the corporate hegemony, if only slightly. Biden befriended segregationists &amp; wrote policy that cruelly punished people for living in poverty. Predictably, it was used to target victims of institutional racism. Modern day Jim Crow.
I hope you‚Äôre not just shaming. That‚Äôs the incredibly lazy and child like way to go about things. The adult thing to do is what the Bernie crowd did for their candidate. If you want Biden/Harris to win you better be making phone calls, knocking on doors, and donating money.
Newt Gingrich: Biden vs. suburbs ‚Äî here's how Dem plan would declare war on American dream  #FoxNews , democrats need to stop hating Trump and look what‚Äôs at stake .
You will make any excuse.  He just told you that Kamala believes Biden finger-raped one of his workers, and you‚Äôre ok with it. Astounding.
People arguing against this are in the same category as anti-maskers, imo. Self-centered outlook, justified by  a sense of moral/intellectual superiority.  Vote for Biden as if some border kid locked in a cage's life depends on it, because those are the stakes right now.
I know I said I'd support Biden regardless of his VP pick simply because he isn't Trump.....but y'all are testing me. A cop. He picked a cop. A cop with a questionable history of fairly applying the law to black people. READ THE ROOM JOE
Okay I guess we can wait a week and then discuss all the black people she helped lock and use as slave labor for California. Which was made possible thanks to Biden's policies. Party on.
voters?! Oh well, maybe now I‚Äôll at least see a bumper sticker or two on the roads. Because you know, Biden ‚Äòwon‚Äô the primary. 2/
Lots of people seem enthusiastic about the Biden/Harris ticket. That‚Äôs a start I guess. I wonder how many phone calls they‚Äôre willing to make and how much money those supporters plan on donating. Or are they only going to participate in democracy via the lazy way by shaming 1/
Facebook people talking bout they rather have 4 more years of trump, than Biden/Harris. And before you ask, no they aren‚Äôt
üî∏Any quibble I have on any aspect of Kamala Harris is completely overshadowed by the threat that another Trump term represents, especially to our most vulnerable citizens.  üî∏There are zero reasons to not vote for Biden as an alternative to Trump.
üî∏White women conservative voters who are generally disgusted by Trump have also watched a lot of Fox News propaganda about "riots" in Portland, etc. and it is not unsavvy of Biden to pick a VP candidate that might allay these voters fears.
Well I just wouldn‚Äôt vote then. Bc Biden shouldn‚Äôt be our president lol
I know everyone hates Trump, for very good reasons, but y‚Äôall should really do your research on Biden/Harris before voting. Don‚Äôt shoot the messenger.. just trying to put people up on game. OUTSIDE of social media hype &amp; the news..
Gag! ‚ÄúSuburban housewife‚Äù here- you do not speak for me! I will vote for Biden/Harris to represent my voice
People from the right shit talking Kamala as a VP pick we‚Äôre already not voting for Biden. She wasn‚Äôt picked for you, so don‚Äôt act like your personal opinion is an indication of the 2020 outcome.
Your stance can only work for Biden-Harris because they are running against an open fascist. In your case, the ONLY way you can contest a sitting Senator is via POLICY. WHERE. DO. YOU. STAND??
That ‚Äúhalf assed attempt‚Äù was mocked and labeled unecessary by Pelosi and countless other Dems and even xenophobic by Biden. Now it wasn‚Äôt enough? And bringing up New York‚Äôs handling of things is laughable. The governor should be criminally charged for his nursing home policy!
Leftists ARE the alienated voters. All of Biden's pablum is catnip to the rest of the voters who just want the same-old-same-old stuff and are hostile to any and all progressive policy proposals.
Watch Joe Biden give an endless hug to Hillary Clinton  via
üò≠üò≠üò≠ and Biden‚Äôs VP choice ain‚Äôt shit. Like what the fuck
Doesnt harris enjoy throwing the book at people for weed? And biden was partially behind overcharging black people, leading to mass incarceration with the "tough on crime" law? How is this a positive thing?
Fuck Joe Biden and Donald Trump as well. Yall can lie to yall selves and act like they not one in the same but choosing between the lesser of two evils is still choosing EVIL. Fuck that
If Biden wins, #Kamala will become President. She'd then be the first US president to have BOTH non-citizen parents at the time of her birth in the US (Obama had 1), a citizenship status that Scalia in Hamdi called "presumed."
I don't want to spend much time dunking on Biden or Harris before they replace #FascistTrump (that treatment mostly waits for these CorpoDems to be installed), But I wonder how long until the identity euphoria ends and voters start thinking about actual Biden-Harris policies.
Trump has serious and decades old connections with oligarchs in Russia laundering money. He is a compromised individual because he has laundered money for the Russians plus more. Biden is not compromised. Putin owns Trump. That‚Äôs the difference. Trump is a compromised asset.
I like Joe Biden‚Äôs plan where he is not going to allow any rich people in your middle class neighborhood.
I‚Äôm Catholic and I‚Äôm all Biden. So you go ahead and be a two face and vote for the orange evil. You pretty much make me sick.
a Biden/Harris administsrtarion allows for agency, organization, and bargaining power. The executive branch is only one piece of the puzzle. Vote progressives into congress and state gov.
Bernie had the momentum to flip seats. Bernie's policy generates excitement. Biden's campaign is begging and shaming people to show up simply because he isn't Trump. That's how we lose midterms.  Bernie wasn't corrupt enough for the corporate masters of the Democratic party.
This dude is gonna sweep. ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è DNC, once again, give us no good alternative. First Killary, now dementia Biden and flip flopped Harris.

Hell of  a Pick ! the GOP is scrambling now. Joe Biden pretty much secured victory in November. Mike pence has no chance in a Debate with her. I'm excited the Democratic base is rallied thats for sure, she could be thee next president in 3-4yrs so turn will be high for her alone

Aside from it being completely untrue it‚Äôs also really irritating to people on the left and isn‚Äôt going to help your argument. The best option is the settle for Biden route imo even tho it‚Äôs cringe at least the are honest lol
Go get a six sided dice.  Roll it once. Every morning when you wake up.  If it's a 5 or 6, Trump wins the election that day.  If it's a 1, 2, 3, or 4 the Biden wins the election that day.  Keep track of results.  By October you will have a firmer grasp on probabilities.
It‚Äôs totally fine and good when people on the left advocate for voting for biden and kamala but all I ask is that in doing so you don‚Äôt try to convince ppl they‚Äôre somehow even slightly progressive
Y‚Äôall out here saying Biden‚Äôs the same as Trump like hundreds of thousands of your comrades didn‚Äôt bury their loved ones after they died from a pandemic that Trump denied for over a month.

No he isnt Biden is winning and he Raised 7 million in 2hrs after his VP pick and he'll rise in the polls now even further since he picked a good VP that is African American at that. There is talk that the Republicans will lose the senate even lol Fox news is lying to you
Biden is so racist that he worked shoulder2shoulder with a black president for two terms, while Trump questioned that president‚Äôs legitimacy because he was black. Now, Biden chose a biracial black woman to run as his partner &amp; you seem to think he is ‚Äúequally‚Äù as racist as Trump?
Thank you for admitting, but Biden isn‚Äôt near as racist as trump! Like Chelsea said who questioned Obama‚Äôs nationality because of his father and his race?
Wrong, you‚Äôre the one who keeps saying Biden is racist just like trump.
Some are trump ü§ñ‚Äôs. Notice how they don‚Äôt criticize trump but they criticize Biden. Or they lump them together when normally it‚Äôs trump who is guilty of the worst, such as ‚Äúrapist and racist‚Äù in this instance.
Only trump has a rape lawsuit pending against him. Not Biden. üòÑ
Obama/Biden raised the black unemployment rate that Trump gloated about.
Only the radicals said refund the police.Biden is a moderate and Harris is tough on crime.
Cool. Biden will write another crime bill and shoot protestors in the leg instead of the eye while we wait.
You keep calling Biden trash, as if Trump is garden variety bad! If you really looked at Kamala‚Äôs history, you will see the laws she has passed to help people of color and the poor. And you juxtapose a racist vulgarian like Trump with a man like Biden? Shame on you!
Epstein's pedo-empire existed during the Obama/Biden administration days
The entire system is messed up and they're demand that it be fixed point blank period or the city will be destroyed and the suburbs are next . So we can elect Biden and fix it or we can elect trumo and attempt to crush and silence the people and hope to contain revolts in future
We are aware of Trump agents pretending to be black on Twitter and Facebook to discourage Black people from voting for Biden. You seem to got the bill.
That sounds crazy, that's not going to happen especially with the history of this country the protest are justified, most Americans are embarrassed by Trump. I think Biden wins pretty easily and Its expected that Dems win senate as well lol
Trump's racism and pandering to radical far right neo nazi groups turned the white suburban people especially women off . Trump's behind Biden with every Demographic group ! Hilary never lead in that way to add to it Biden has a Black VP
No disrespect to Ms. Harris, Biden could run a ham sandwich as his mate and I will vote to keep Trump from being able to select another Supreme Court Justice. Thank you for this article though. It does give me more confidence in her as his choice. üëç
I hate Trump, I also hate Biden ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è But in order to be a responsible adult I have to vote for Biden because I hate Trump slightly more then I hate Biden. Adulting is fucking ridic.

I was already begrudgingly voting for Biden and now I have to ignore my morals and vote for him with Harris as his running mate?? I hate it here. Worst choice he could‚Äôve made
Biden doesn't want to defund the police. Democrats do not support Antifa, they are a radical group who has their own agenda. No one ever said all cops are racist. Cops are doing their best to stop violence. Electoral college? That's why you are brainwashed. Trump lies you believe
Biden touches and gropes young children. People that don‚Äôt have a chance. Don‚Äôt get mad at a man for having relations with a grown ass woman who then tries to defame you bc you‚Äôre famous. Huge difference little guy
I remember when Biden back Slick Willy aka Bill Clinton when he cut the CIA in half!
Giving Biden Kamala Harris is like giving a monkey a drum. Name one thing Biden has done in 50 years of politics. I remember one thing, the day before 911 he was wanting to cut Defense spending. How did that idea look the next day?
üò¨üò¨üò¨ bernie baby pls just... don't bring attention to this... she's a cop. biden was a hard enough sell with the rape allegations and the shit history with BIPOC. We'll vote for the lesserü§¢evil but jfc can we not run excitedly in doing so?
Biden and Harris are Blue collar folks they come from the working class ! No ivy League degrees they went to HBCU's lol
Whether he is a Christian or not I do not know. I could equally question the veracity of Biden‚Äôs faith. What I do know is that our President supports the sanctity of human life, and that alone is enough for me to vote for him again. Thanks for wanting to know what/why I think!
And Biden isn't?
Exactly! Do you you know he posts in Biden campaign Twitter account as well?! This is how desperate Demented Don is!
Yes.....I wanted Kamala or Elizabeth although the entire group of women was very impressive.  I hope Biden finds a place for all of them!
Harris publicly referred to Biden as an all around bigot and sexual assaulting predator  then accepts the chance to become his running mate. This seems hypocritical to me.
How Biden selected Kamala Harris as his running mate
Is this a joke?  This has to be a joke?  But no concern of Biden losing his cognitive abilities?
Harris publicly called Biden a racist, a segregationist and a sexual predator. Then she becomes his running mate. I personally call that hypocritical how about you ?
Let's get Joe Biden and Kamala Harris in the white house. Vote everybody.
This Biden VP pick is the death of the Democrat party campaign.
This made me want to vote for Biden more .
I want to see white candidates‚Äô heritage picked apart like was done to Obama and now Harris. I need to know if Biden really is a white man of European American ancestry... I have a feeling he is hiding a secret Canadian ancestor.  We need to know the truth!
It's crazy that you can say "I don't like Biden, I don't like Kamala" and you're suddenly a misogynist, an idiot, a republican, and ignorant. These Democrats sure know how to win over a progressive! #VoteGreen2020 #DemExit2020 #BidenSucks #TrumpSucks #KamalaSucks

It makes me seriously doubt that Biden was serious about his leftward shift. I was really excited about his new climate policy but now I don‚Äôt trust him one bit
Kamala Harris is literally the opposite of criminal justice reform. She also called Biden a racist and said she believed sexual harassment allegations against him. I‚Äôm looking forward to the word-salad mental gymnastics the left and the media employs to excuse this.
And Kamala accused Biden of both racism and sexism. Wow.
BIDEN WONT BE PRESIDENT FOR 8yrs he's a transitional candidate fuck him, it's about getting Trump out . Harris will take over Biden may not even get to  4yrs .
Forget Biden I'm voting for Harris
What Kamala Harris means for Joe Biden's campaign‚Äîand the Democratic Party's future:
Ordered my Biden/Harris sign and made a small donation. Here‚Äôs to the future president!
She passed the Biden "smell test"
His team knows, it's why they are so desperate to say that Biden is in the basement and has dementia. As far as I can tell Biden is the same stutterer and gaffe prone politician he's always been. But he is physically fit, especially for his age, and can make it through a speech.
So was hillary, barak , Bill Clinton ( 1st black President) you don‚Äôt remember that now do you ! You know if god forbid Biden elected she will be president.

Joe Biden went from praising Confederate organizations who supported the KKK to becoming the Dem pres candidate.   Come to think of it that's not a stretch.   Hillary got the Margaret Sanger award. She started planned parenthood to get rid of black people.
Joe Biden was the author of a 1994 crime bill that turned into a key reason for the 90's incarceration bump. He has shown a complete lack of touch in public relations, intentionally and accidentally insulting workers and anyone who questions him.
The Democratic Party's selection of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris as proposed leaders of the U.S. shows a direct lack of touch/care in relation to multiple months of protests - main topics being police brutality and systemic racism.

I just had a girl block me on Facebook bc I said that Biden was the lesser of two evils. She said that Biden is a child molester and I can‚Äôt understand bc I don‚Äôt have children. I literally can‚Äôt. Do people not realize that painting people out to prey on children is propaganda?
But my greatest area of common ground was the left's renewed emphasis on reforming the criminal justice system. I would've had more confidence in Biden's commitment to this had he picked just about anyone else.
I'm not gonna sit here and pretend there was a chance of me voting blue in November. But I definitely looked at a Biden ticket as I did Trump in 2016 and now: someone I'm not voting for but can at least expect to accomplish things in areas of common ground.
Who knows, maybe she does believe those things, but if she truly believed Biden had segregationist views would she agree to be his VP? Prob not, but she had no problem insinuating it anyways.   Okay so she's smeared a couple people as racists, thats it thought right?
Some of the "Vote Biden/Harris and hold them accountable in the WH" folks are the same ones that snidely scold anyone who supports leftist challengers to Republicans or  corporatist Democrats.   Their vision of accountability is feckless.

You do realize Biden never said he would pick a black woman for VP. He said he would pick a woman for VP and would pick a POC for supreme court and would CONSIDER  a woman of color for VP. I still say he will pick Hillary because he never said he would pick a woman of color.

Seems consistent for the most part, the only outlier is that they're deeming the audio as "an attack against Biden" when it's just from an investigation of the Obama administration that was ongoing since 2015-2016. Trying in vain to paint the scandal as a political attack.
