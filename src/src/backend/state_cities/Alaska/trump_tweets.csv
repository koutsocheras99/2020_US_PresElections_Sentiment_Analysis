Basically if Biden wins it’s simply because more people disliked Trump. We’re also voting for whoever Biden’s running mate is because there is no way he’s getting through a 4 year term with his mental state the way it is.
You are so very welcome Monica  🌹🌹Appreciate you, my dear and wonderful friend!!🌹💖🇺🇸💘😉🤩😍🌟💞💐🥰🤗😘😘😘
Texas and Florida are a Covid disaster. We are at the beginning of this catastrophe. Wait until school kids become vectors. Donald Trump will be the cause of death of at least 1,000,000 Americans, deaths that could have been avoided. And probably more.
Thank you dear  Here's more
Trump just announced that he had just eon the second world war
The term “misinformation” is used so that the boomers, who buy into the crock of shit that is Donald Trump’s rhetoric, won’t have their feelings hurt as badly when they are called out for believing blatant LIES.   Wear a damn mask, assholes.
trump actually takes them serious as a threat. biden is too dead to be a threat to them

Regardless of our race, religion, national origin, or age...it's going to be the women who will set the tone for the outcome of the General Election.   B/c we've had enough backtalk from the  and we're T-I-R-E-D of Trump's chit!  #bottomline

Thank you dear  Adding more:
Sounds like he was being honest about what they would see.  What's wrong with that?  If you were half as honest as President Trump you'd do a lot better!   🤣😂🤣
Agree.  The plan is for neither Trump or Biden to be President.  Mail in voting is key and Pelosi will be President to an unresolvable count.  They don’t care what the issues are, just as long as there are lots of them.
If you’re a Democrat, two are to blame:  #1 Trump, #2 Covid.
Another link that has the rest of the video.
Yes, Trump is responsible.  Poor leadership, lack of planning, fallacies, and praising protesters of the lockdown.   Trump did say Obama should be responsible for U.S  H1N1 deaths, 12,000 + in 1 year. In 5 months COVID-19 has killed over 158,000 Americans. #itiswhatitis
Trump kicks ass!
Apart from that.  Tonight’s speech made it clear this man is looking out for America, and not interested in playing politics for personal gain.  So glad to have Trump in office!
unless ur a trump supporter thats the only time i’d judge
Trump is a “saint” by the blood.
Trump advisors repeatedly steered him away from military options for fear he would start a war.
))Ahem!((  I think I can speak for a good portion, if not most American women when I say...Donald J Trump needs to stay full clear of our Thighlands.  ))That is all.((
The Trump Virus is very real. And the Trump hoax is very real. Your corruption and callousness knows no bounds. #TrumpVirusDeathToll160K
Why are my Twitter friends watching Trump? Fuck that. Have some fun.
Trump is rambling like an old friend you haven’t seen since high school and you realize too late that they are sniffing that good china white.
Thx, Neal, but isn’t it inevitable that anything unfavorable to Trump will be appealed all the way to SCOTUS, which will strike it down?
"Unemployment has dropped   by 33% since April 2020?..."  - Trump #fromthepodium   😆😆😆❗️
Putin. Bounties. Troops. Trump. Silence. See ya at the polls, BOZO! #trumpresignnow #TrumpVirusDeathToll156K #25thAmendmentNow
Yeah and it will hit right when trump is out whining for votes and I hope his own followers turn on his ass and tell him stfu anywhere he goes. Flying around like it’s nobody’s business to his own golf resorts to get more of our hard earned tax money. That they STILL collected.
Trump is Herbert Hoover #2.
As an Alaskan....we are HORRIFIED that Trump is okaying the Pebble Mine—-which will destroy salmon spawning grounds...Among other horrors. This is why Dr. Al Gross(Independent) has a good fighting chance to beat GOP Dan ‘Do Nothing’ Sullivan in November!!
Bert—the potus is not an independent dictator with unilateral powers. I know Trump fancies himself King, but he isn’t.
I propose that ALL Red States who vote for Trump leave the U.S. &amp; form their own country—&amp; thus stop getting funded by Blue State tax $$ &amp; federal funds. This would include AL, GA, MISS., ARK, &amp; possibly FL. Then they can build whatever monuments they want—w/their own money.
Fuck them
If Pompeo talked to Russia about bounties, why didn't Trump?
China &amp; Russian, or whatever nation that is involved, needs to have the full weight of the U.S. upon them.  The push back has to long-term and impactful.  Must be bi-partisan, unified, and without any daylight between the R's and D's on this.    Trump will not lead on the way.
My favorite trump supporter dis is: “Obama is still your hair style’s president” 😵
Thanks to President Trump he may address the issue by EO.  Unfortunately the worthless Democrats cared more about special interests than the American people!
Kaitlin Bennett's Trump Boat Rally! OMFG! KILL ME! Now.  via
Yes and if found guilty its either life in prison or execution . I want trump to spend life in prison with the biggest gayest black cellmate .
Yep 👍, our President Trump will forever be known as the ‘Empowerment and Economics President.’
Why didn’t Trump??
Don’t even keep track anymore.
a security threat?  How about Trump has no presence on the platform and got punk'd by a bunch of TikTok teenagers at his Tulsa Rally.  The threat is that TikTok users might rally to vote and they don't like Trump.
Time to call it like it is. You're a shill for a fool. Trump is a traitor. Your actions are directly harmful to America and Americans. The GOP is dead. Trump killed it. Move on and form a new conservative party. #GOPCorruptionOverCountry
remember when everyone said Hillary would win cause Trump is such an easy beat? Lol
U can say what ever u want,sloppy orange coward shows us daily that his brain is damaged he reads at a child like level can't pay attention for 5 minutes. He not a cosmopolitan he's a fuckhead,trump couldn't read or understand ur tweet if it was written in crayons with pictures.

etc. didn't learn a damn thing about giving trump free advertising from 2016. Turns out he's right about "ratings"
Homeboy has been sleep during this whole time....... President Trump has endured hardships from every front. In that he stays the course accomplishing much more than any President. Go back to sleep  you missed the train.  Cry Babies Need not apply
Millions across the country, from  in Alaska, to     and  all agree #NoPebbleMine. They’re confident  will make the right decision.
Ok yeah, but when can you call him as a witness? After the Supreme Court gets a chance to look and then sends it back to the courts for "new arguments" while Trump is still ruining our country?
He doesn't realize he's been in charge for 4 years. Our current problems are a result of Trump's admin. They even had two years owning the WH, Senate and House. No excuse anywhere that explains why his bankrupted businesses are different than his bankrupted country. You suck dude
OK, I won’t get a vaccine if Trump has anything to do with it. It’s unfortunate, but true.
Suspicious that ACLU constantly and ONLY attack President Trump and GOP, yet NEVER knock DEMS? Bible tells us we'll 'know their hearts by their words'. 4 YEARS of OBVIOUS partisan rants by ACLU, dismisses them as an honest source but elevates them to 'a clear &amp; present danger!
I had a dream that I met Donald Trump &amp; it was fuckin weird
This analysis is excellent! Please read
You wouldn’t know hypocrisy if it snuck up behind you and bit ya in the keister! You really think your hurting our feelings with your self righteous drivel? Trump lives in your head and you are now reduced to trolling Twitter like the good little snowflake lib that you are. Bravo
Nope .. Trump is not smart enough to be the anti-Christ ..
No wonder why trump wants this removed it is showing who is racist  thank you TikTok I say let the app run and ban all who do this and be ban on all social media Apps to protect everyone
Facebook Employees Wonder What Would Happen if Trump Used Their Platform to Dispute Election Results - A senior engineer collected internal evidence that showed Facebook was giving preferential treatment to prominent conservative accounts
No we are not all with this fake impeached president! How stupid after all this time to believe anything good or decent about this lying con man! You know who else called the media fake? Hitler! Much of what Trump does is relatable to Hitler... history repeats!
People know that giving away 400,000 a year is no big deal when you can steal millions from tax payers! He cares for no one but Trump, not the country, not the soldiers, not the sick or the dead!
That’s all bullshit! What do you think Trump is going to do, when reporting straight to him instead of the CDC happens? Exactly what you believe right now! He has blood on his hands and would rather golf then give a damn!
Admittedly, it would be hard for any semi-competent person to negligently kill 160,000 Americans in 7 months.    Trump is either grossly incompetent, or criminally malicious.
True, however the current GOP has lost my trust as they've capitulated to Trump at every step.
Trump will be! He’s a criminal and some of you are just to stupid and blind to see the truth!!
Wow talking about misinformation!! You need to get away from Fox fake news. Trump politicized a virus and used it against blue states, blamed it on their failed leadership! One thing we now know is Trump’s words are pure projection! Trump kills!
What’s fake and corrupt is you Donald Trump!! You’re a liar and a fraud, a con man! Your desperation is showing and we’re smart enough to not fall for it!                                             Real news is Fake Trump!!
Taking his non-leadership role from trump

How am I going to watch my funny videos and communicate with my fellow BTS Army?

Because TRUMP IS PRESIDENT! He and republicans don’t give two shits about kids once they’ve let the mother-ship
Trump gassed people to get to a Church for a photo op. And that was the last time he came near a Church.
Trump had threatened a deadline of Sept. 15 to “close down” TikTok unless Microsoft or “somebody else” bought it.
Biden’s dumb ass remarks about prosecuting trump is exactly why Bernie should have the nomination but I do like that he said that he wouldn’t interfere if they do. The issue is we have a repeat of Nixon and his dirty tricks. They’ll make excuses to let trump off as good for
Biden on the path of Marxism TRUMP on the path of Liberty! # #WWG1WGA

Trump orders vague ban on dealings with Chinese owners of popular social media apps TikTok and WeChat
Both sides said the future of the talks is uncertain. President Donald Trump is considering executive orders to address evictions and unemployment insurance, but they appear unlikely to have much impact.
Alex Jones, Tucker Carlsen, Hannity, Pirro...take you pick of all the lunatics trump listens to 24/7.
If we could pick a leader, how about William as Hand of the Queen, and he could oversee the trial and execution of trump?  Or something
Dissolve and dismantle the Trump Administration.
Trump is making everything he touches worse, and it’s exhausting
It is shaking down all our own strength, &amp; forcing us all to question if we want to live or not. That’s the sweeping existential crisis replaying like a bad song on the radio Trump lies like an arsonist playing with Fire, then plays the hero, trying to put out a fire he started
Lmao american "libertarians" are one of the only groups of voters dumber than hardcore trump people
Very disgusting if you said this. God I m tired of this crap. You had 8 years of Obama. Any progress during his reign. HE DID WELL! HOW ABOUT BLACK AMERICA? They were doing better under Trump!!!!!!
It’s tax payer money, and it’s going to already obscenely rich churches, like Paula White, and other big talking lying wonders the Bible warned us all about in the last days. I didn’t know what it meant when the Bible said: “whosoever loveth and maketh a lie” till I saw trump
You don’t have to be perfect to worship God BUT don’t forget to worship God, and not yourself Trump worships himself
We just need people to lie more to pollsters and say they are voting for Trump.  Strong polls, and he'll relax.
Hope none of them catch Trump's China Flu
But Republicans are the MAJORITY in the Senate, Bert.  Trump is a white supremacist who openly uses racist hate speech. And he also mocks people who have disabilities. He is a despicable person lacking basic ethical moral values.  Trump and his Republican cronies are UnAmerican.
You do know we are in the second Great Depression, correct? And that millions are unemployed? And the economy is in tatters under this Republican potus and Senate? This is how Trump and his Republican cronies are ‘Making America Great Again’—destroying our democracy.

Um. I guess it won’t be a landslide. I don’t see Biden winning Alaska no matter what Trump does. Side note— I am an Alaskan, born and raised.
Run against him in the next election. A 24 year old defeated a candidate endorsed by trump in North Carolina.
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 these comments are gold! Like I didn’t even care trump said it wrong- he can barely read, let alone speak- but now I’m totally invested in the defense of him saying it 😂
There is LITERALLY no way- that trump said if that way because someone in Asia/India does. Trump said it wrong and then corrected himself. It was funny &amp; lame- yes. He said it wrong and yet you are spending all this time to explain it. This is the hill? Let it go, this is weird.
Safest place is aloft in Airforce 1, the President can stay up there as long as he wants!)  Prayers for President Trump, May God bless him and his family and America!)
Trump could not get a bigger syncophant than pense. Lol. I think nokki haley is "too ambitious". She gets alot of press. Trump would be peeved
President Trump will hear us tomorrow. Please join our tweet storm to tell the president that Pebble is the wrong mine for the wrong place. #HuntFishStopPebble
Trump denounced for ‘attempt to gut Social Security’ after he announces plan to unilaterally suspend payroll tax
Do you think when trump says ‘they said’ that they are voices in his head? Or like is someone really saying these things?  I just really really wanna know who ‘they’ is.   Because ‘they’ are saying a lot of stupid shit and orange mister potatoe head keeps repeating it
It gets better! I’m sick of this too Even if Trump gets everything he wants, he’s too stupid to hold on to it. You are smarter than he is. Don’t let it poison your mind and heart. No one is ready for this. We are all in the same boat.
This is a dare Trump and Reps (McConnell, an the Supreme Court) will make the NRA part of the constitution or shred it. Trump would appoint La Pierre just to piss off Dems MOAR, and stir the pot, as his base loves. We are past a boiling point, into a breaking point
Don’t pin this on Steven King  He said himself Trump is worse than any character he’s ever thought up.  King is too smart to fathom someone so incomprehensibly stupid, selfish, wicked, and abusive.
Pretty transparent that McConnell and company are opening the door for an executive order to extend benefits, etc... so that uninformed voters will be like “boy that trump feller really cares about the people”.
The only reason I’m anxious is to deal with the crap. There will be people who complain- and it will be something else for trumps shit to talk shit about. I personally don’t care- trump HAS to go. It could be a spider for all I care and I HATE spiders. I hate trump more tho 🤷🏻‍♀️😂
Looking good, Sexi!  Very patriotic!!💞🌹💞🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
my grandma just told me and said that trump was a good president if he wasn't on twitter. then i countered with him being racist, sexist, accused of sexual assault, denied coronavirus seriousness and she just goes ' yeah, but if he didn't do those things, he'd be good. ' what ???
Just a periodic reminder, in 2016 we were internationally considered the country best equipped to handle a pandemic. Now in 2020 we are the only developed nation that COVID has brought to its knees. It wasn't bad luck or misperceptions in 2016, it's the choices Trump made.
#VoteBlue2020 Let's make that blue wave happen!  He Predicted Trump’s Win in 2016. Now He’s Ready to Call 2020.
I don’t have a lot of hate in my heart.  But i FUCKING HATE Donalt Trump.
If you read Mary Trump’s book he never had to apologize to him. He was kissing his fathers ass his whole life, hoping he would love him. We now deal with daddy issues as the ‘president’
Trump Moves to Ban TikTok, WeChat From U.S., Pressuring China
Blaming Trump for banning a National security risk btw
10 more hours of Twitter jail for calling a homophobe the C word. In the meantime, Trump can lie, get people killed and be openly racist.
And mercandise for trump campaign
Reading the comments -- what will the Ds do when they can't just bleat "but Trump..." after every embarrassment?
Humility - one of Ivanka's strengths...ABSOLUTELY NOT.  This vain, arrogant, entirely self-centered.
Useful idiots can never sense irony, eh? Because thinking Biden is in cognitive decline and supporting Trump couldn't possibly be not mutually exclusive.
Trump taking on Pharma during a pandemic has to be one of the most American things a president has ever done.
Trump Isn't "Failing" on COVID Testing. He's Carrying Out a Brutal Plan. “” ... he does not want testing because he does not want the country to know how sick it is. It is the information he fears most”
Credit where it’s due - Trump did say he was going to close borders. And he did. Just everyone else’s.
yikes, when trump haters make fun of trump for mispronouncing a word, then find out he actually said it right. thailand is actually pronounced thighland
Garbage take on this election. Not supporting Biden means supporting Trump. #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica2020  #VoteBlueToEndThisNightmare
Apart from seeing President Trump sweep the floor with Biden, no.  Although Beijing Biden would be exposed for the fraud that he is!
Joe Biden says that once elected President he will not stand in the way of the Justice Department pursuing criminal charges against President Trump.
trump is probably gonna win again
I don't believe these low numbers, all the sudden  I smell a 🐀 suppressing data in the Trump admin...
How can we fight back? I left FB cause I was so mad. But then people pointed out that that’s exactly what they want  to stifle conservative voices.
We openly know that this whole thing is to help get trump re-elected and you’re feeding into it
Tell the trump campaign and Ivanka that. Get their merchandise from China.
It’s like that in Kansas, Missouri, and eastern Colorado too. Arizona is stupid for Trump, I mean stupid.
Trump has absolutely nothing to say that’s worth remembering, much less writing down.
"if we let tis Trump scumbag muthtahfuckah take over our Party, he' s gonna destroy it, an' we will have deserved that" 3 months later Graham was licking the 'THINGS' ass on the golf couse. You figger it out.
Trump signs everywhere in Ohio farm country. Though I did see a couple Biden signs yesterday.
Like I said, their chances of winning are higher than Biden's chances of actually governing to the left of trump.  And not only do you know this, it's specifically why you support him
This lie has been told by Trump 142 times.
This is insane. Trump says Biden will hurt God.
Well, trump is a full time liar so there's that
There are plenty of Trump morons in Ohio.
This is Trump everyday. Run on sentences that make no sense and never get to the point
Trump says, if Biden is elected, he will "hurt God." If Biden is that powerful, we should do what he says.
Facebook, Twitter Pull Trump Video For Spreading Bad COVID Information  via
President Donald Trump accused former Vice President Joe Biden of wanting to 'hurt God' during a stop in Ohio on Thursday.
You’re talking about Trump, right?
Give me a break. Corporate lobbyists everywhere in this administration and sweetheart deals to corporations that support trump.
Trump is the head of the Republican Party. He still has more than 90% approval among Republicans. To call yourself a Republican but not support Trump makes you look like you don’t understand what is going on
You don't understand. Trump has the secret to immortality stashed away. We've all been played.
Trump presidency has been devastating for farmers. As far as I can tell, farmers still supporting him. A version of Stockholm Syndrome?
What work? Shit for brains? Your comment doesn’t even make sense (just like Trump)! As for no evidence that it harms children or they pass it on... Really?? I know I’m probably responding to a bot ...
Kidding aside, I think this is a revealing slip. "God" is not real to Trump. "God" is churches, voters, a rhetorical hammer. If more people become atheist, or stop going to church, to Trump, "God" is hurt.
Like trump knows what a weedwhacker is.
at least when Trump plays golf, he does not shut down private clubs, public streets. And when he travels, he does not shut down public beaches for two weeks. Obama had no problem interfering with the public and ruining people's vacations
Trump also did a deposition to help put Epstein away in 2008 but you &amp; everyone else conviently forget that fact as well.
‘Trump is scared’ and ‘literally does not appear to understand’ what is going on around him: White House reporter
Good description of Trump supporters.
Trump translation: Keep that church 💰 a-funnelin'!
EXACTLY what Trump did, favoring a trade deal over COVID response. You guys literally ignore all reality. Like mad lib political ads. Just take what  did and change the name to Joe Biden to scare white women.
ITS NOT POSSIBLE TO CHANGE THE CONSTITUTION WITHOUT NOTICE. It’s NOT possible to do anything trump just said in his tweet. It’s not a thing. You cannot just change the constitution on a whim. No one is taking your guns.
The Trump administration is waging war against people of color, and you’re voting for him? Along with all of the Klansman? Along with all of the racists? I don’t get you.
That’s a whole lot of words to say nothing of truth or value. Good job ignoring what trump just said...but hey- fear a bunch of lies. Whatever makes you feel better

Unelected, unqualified and unethical.  Trump Brand.
Strategic! 👍 The Democrats won't negotiate &amp; hope to make Trump &amp; Republicans look bad. Now Trump issues executive order which may exceed his authority, so Democrats sue to take much needed benefits away from Americans.  Brilliant! 👏👏👏
I think the real question is if You like Malt Liquor. I mean, Bernie’s Friend is saying ya’all are the same.   Now imagine Trump, Ted Cruz or Lindsey Graham stating that Blacks are all the same, with a few notable exceptions.   He was probably referring to you and Nina Turner.
Honestly, you seem bored and distracted. The media can't stay focused and KEEP asking Trump the important questions because he goes and does something else. There is no comparison between a penchant to stick a foot in a mouth and an unholy shit storm of lies, stupidity, and hate
Imagine Trump, Mitch McConnell, Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio, Lindsey Graham, Sean Hannity or some Fox and Friend saying all Blacks, except for a few exceptions, are all the same.  Yes, Biden Suoporters! You’re a bunch of Racist Cucks!
Bette Midler to Trump: ‘Shut the F**k Up, You Nitwit. YOU Are the Enemy of the People’
The WSJ editorial pages’ idiotic support for Trump’s kakistocracy no longer surprises. These are without doubt the dumbest, most irresponsible editorial pages in the country.
So you're saying that Biden would kill his own campaign if he were allowed to speak, but Good News For Dems, he isn't!  And in more Good News, now Trump can't rely on Biden self-destructing, which was his only hope (besides, of course, his extremely motivated base).

Are you that fucking stupid? This describes Trump down to the last letter!! And ANTIFA? Anti- fascism  yes I’ll take that! Trump is a fascist. Trump is for Trump!! Not the people. Open your eyes!
Never trust a dog hater. Trump hates dogs because "they beg" &amp; thus have no dignity. Trump has never accidentally brushed up against, nor would he recognize, dignity--even if it sank its canines into his planet-size, corrugated behind. A smashed maggot has more dignity than Tump.
Yup! And it’s bullshit! I still feel #MoscowMitchMcTreason is more dangerous and more important to replace than anyone else! Wait, Stephen Miller is next in line as well. And obviously trump. Oh fuck! Send em all out and to The Hague.

The kind of conditions trump wants to take us back to by reducing regulations. Am I right?

If you replace Trump with someone else in the scenario, the toxicity becomes obvious. Trump himself is... just a yikes, to put it nicely. But I don’t blame people for being apprehensive/ defensive about if someone is a supporter. Still, doesn’t make it ok to attack people
I’ve been through a lot of farm country this summer and there are Trump signs everywhere Mask use is spotty too.

Trump is beyond fascist he is monarchist and just straight up said it
Nope it will be the Kung flu and they will blame it on trump. More likely it will be lead poisoning !
Am I shocked that Tucker Carlson spread that unabashedly lazy false news hit piece on Mayor Berkowitz to his audience? No. Am I annoyed? Sure. The irony is not lost on me that he turns a blind eye to all of Trump’s ‘favors’ to his cronies &amp; biz interests. 🤷🏻‍♀️ but ok.
I don’t see that! Insane! All I can assume is that these idiot trump supporters are purposely reporting things as much as possible so that the system removes them. You’d think  would see mass reports and work on those immediately to see what’s going on
"We have done a lot for Alaska, it’s a special place, and I’ll take a look at that. It’s interesting," Trump said after his son tweeted his opposition to Pebble Mine.
Yes, we’ll, Ari, the President demonstrates his cognitive dissidence on an hourly basis.  For Trump’s team to raise this issue is like the pot calling the kettle black!
Now do Trump
President Donald Trump’s daughter Ivanka Trump raised $4 million for his reelection campaign during a virtual event that marked her return to the high-dollar fundraising circuit.
"...the acknowledgment Republicans can't get African Americans, therefore, the need is either to suppress them or to divert them from the Democratic Party, has been at the core of Republican electoral strategy" Repubs aren't even TRYING to woo Black voters
Daymn..!!!   Maybe time for a new strategy Team Trump?
Update: Twitter temporarily bans Trump team from tweeting
That's exactly right.  I dont know how some folks have come up with Kanye taking votes away from Biden. No he won't. He'll be taking votes away from Trump  because there are some republican voters who won't vote for Trump or Biden.

Trump is Hoover #2.
I understand they want to trash Biden but can’t do it by claiming Trump doesn’t do the same stuff. Try again.
Oh totally. I’m a middle age woman and almost all the women I know are very pro Trump. I don’t believe polls that say what I want them to i believe zero polls.
Did anybody read the  article about the church of Trump in the new  ??? OMG!!!!!

FOCUS: A New Trump Rule Could Help Big Oil Crush the Climate Movement  -  ;-(
3. The Trump era has been nothing but toxic, divisive, and dangerous to our country and our community at a cellular level. It’s emboldened self-righteous stupidity, it’s fueled a warped indignation in our most racist, most uninformed people. It’ll take generations to repair this.
Twitter stopped Trump from tweeting until he removed a tweet with false COVID-19 info.
Bigger picture when I look back at the rightie tighty-whities over the last 40-some years. Trump is the result, not the cause. At least in my mind. From Gingrich to McConnell, and everyone in between. They have spent years building up to and normalizing this.
I think the Trump strategy is to reach herd immunity before any other country regardless of number of deaths. Then we can be normal economically while other countries can’t.
trump has proven himself time and time again to be the one with zero credibility.
About a month for planned parenthood, I’m sure you support the murder of innocent life
Ugh.....I absolutely hate trump. He is the worst and is going to continue to tear apart our country for the gain of the very few if left in office. But Biden is the best we could come up with to go against him?!?! Just so disappointed in our country since Obama left.

You are right about the pebble mine project.  But the Trump family has frequently shown their tendency to be congenital liars. Sen. Dan Sullivan has been a Trump sycophant. Look for actions, not words.
One day Donald Trump will disappear. Like a miracle, he will just disappear.
Nope. My Dad &amp; I were talking about Biden's VP &amp; he suggested that Biden might pick Condoleezza Rice. I replied "Hmm, idk, but that might be smart. It could sway a lot of Trump-skeptical GOPers." He then clarified that he meant *Susan* Rice, to which I replied, "oh, yeah...yuck."
every trump interview comes off like an snl sketch parody of a trump interview
Kind of like, why is it not okay for people to go to the polls so we need to delay the election, but okay to go to school, work, and gatherings. It’s called Trump knowledge.
Biden is probably praying for Trump as it is. Because as far as the election go impeached failure 45th president Donald J Trump doesn’t have a prayer!
Most of the programs the Trump administration is building on were started in the Bush and Obama eras.
This MAGA cult is fucked. They rule rural farm communities RN. I’m seeing it in my recent travels. Trump signs are everywhere. We have to really make sure we get out the vote.

So, when Trump claimed it was an attack yesterday ahead of any actual intelligence, is that because his buddy Putin gave him inside information?
President Donald Trump said Wednesday that he's considering delivering his Republican convention acceptance speech from the White House after his initial plans to hold the event were foiled by coronavirus concerns and health restrictions.

I think the election is going to be a lot closer than people think it is. A lot of people are going to vote for Biden simply because he’s not Trump, similarly to 2016. But the economy is not doing well. That alone could sink Trump.
Donald Trump reads like a third grader seeing common words and names for the first time.
We don’t support a road that will cause the loss of critical caribou habitat, degrade boreal forest that is important for rare songbirds like the Blackpoll Warbler, and threaten the future of Sandhill Cranes.
Trump suffers from a narcissism so intense it’s almost debilitating , and Biden is frequently given to bizarre bouts of verbal diarrhea. And both of them frequently tell obvious demonstrable lies to make them sound better.
Because......Trump promotes it and they sure as hell can't give the impression of agreement with their hated nemesis. And...They don't want the crisis to end hoping it torpedoes Trump's chances for re-election. They don't care about the ppl.
The war they could unleash on each other would be a world ending war. Not a world war. An apocalyptic hell scape. Aside from all the other countries in chaos and disarray, and escalating tensions. Pence is a statesman and good husband, or was before he joined Trump
Germany has all kinds of white supremacists, and their country is great! For them at least, sometimes. They don’t have an out of control pandemic, and are lots of smart ppl there. Trump abandoned Germany to Russia, possibly. That internal WS versus WS.
I don’t think Biden is a closeted White supremacist. I don’t know him, I didn’t watch the debates. I just wish ppl would stop fighting. I’d honestly feel safer with VP Pence in charge right now, than Trump, even assuming he is a closeted White Supremacist. At least his not a..
I would take VP Pence as Commander and Chief right now over Trump. Say what you want about white supremacists, in their own habitat, Germany, they get stuff done. There’s plenty of Closted white supremacists in Germany, and they saved each other, and flattened the curve

Trump will Never quit or step down willingly. To think otherwise means you missed countless interviews where he stated, "I'm not a quitter. I never quit," and "I don't like to lose. I don't lose."
If you watched Trump's interview with  you'd see that  truly doesn't understand the severity of #COVIDー19.  His response to the death count was "It is what it is".  What Leader SAYS THAT?!?!?!

Watched the entire interview this evening. Trump is a Clear And Present Danger to Democracy as we know it.  He represents everything  stands for.  Frightening how far he goes to pedal falsehoods, deny scientific facts, and place blame on others.
No, he should not debate Trump.  Why should he? Trump needs the debate to help him—not the other way around.  Joe should decline.

What? That’s the most ridiculous thing I’ve heard yet! This is still America! No thanks to Trump! So maybe you should shut your pie hole!!
So Biden will build the United States up again from the ruins if Donald Trump

I implore all rational Democrats to really consider voting for Trump this Nov. If you vote just beacause he is not politically correct you are inviting more of the same violence, mayhem and Anti American craziness that is going on. Dont wait till it is too late!

What a P.O.S. Doesn’t he have some windsurfing to go do, or speeches to give at 250K a pop? Pretty cool when you accomplished NOTHING that Trump couldn’t undo with the stroke of a pen, lost 1200 seats, and left the party in shambles.
Right now, our country has far more important things to worry about.  155,000 + American Deaths from COVID   Millions Jobless   Trump =Incompetent

Trump allegedly threatened to kill a 13 year old girl he allegedly raped, and her whole family. Don’t think he won’t actually do it to you, someone who isn’t an aspiring 13 year old model.

Trump isn’t campaigning He’s manufacturing consent, and trying to destabilize and collapse the US so he can go full dictator   He will literally kill you, and shred the constitution to save his own temporary ass.

NPR still repeating obvious Trump lies without context or rebuttal. Somebody should be be fired for allowing such bad journalism to air. So irresponsible.

Trump banning TikTok  has nothing to do with the 1 million teenagers who punk'd him at the Tulsa rally.

i think fox ratings in general would soar to stratospheric levels ranting about the new pres. there wouldn't be enough time in the day to contain all the talk...leading to probably a trump cable tv slot to allow for even more lunatic ranting.
Trump isn’t running for re-election, he is running FROM any accountability, or the premise of accountability. He also wants to avoid comeuppance, pay back, blow back, law suits, Johnny Law, being a loser, and Jail  Just fuck everything, and hope he’s still standing at the end

Pay attention to what Trump says when reporters ask him about the election and what he’s going to do about it regarding if he’s going to except the election he said well we haven’t got there but you’ll see what I’m gonna do it’s going to be big it’s going to be big. Ffs
Trump doesn’t know his ass from a hole in the ground, but JFC, I can’t fathom the balls it must take for the gov. of the state with the most deaths by FAR, who caused God knows how many nursing home deaths, to be the one to call him out on it
More quid pro quo. The king says pay into my treasury.    Trump stuns observers by openly soliciting payment to US Treasury for his ‘approval’ of TikTok sale

When Trump drinks a glass of water, they try to indict him...
Yes, tRUMP donates his salary. Big Whoop!  By his own admission, he's making a LOT of $$ with his other investments ~ investments he Refused to give up, as required, when he took office.  Then there's the $$ Secret Service (i.e. American Taxpayers) must pay tTUMP resorts.
Trump surrogates have been saying biden will be a disaster. Hysterical if it wasn't so bad. Millions unemployed, pandemic raging with no national leadership,  international relations in the toilet. Pretty sure most Americans are not better off than 4 years ago, except the rich.
There will be a Long road ahead for U.S. COVID-19 patient recovery, with astronomical expenses to taxpayers.  Trump's Legacy will be thousands of chronically ill Americans needing healthcare.  Democrats will have to pull U.S. out of the muck. 😖
tRUMP has never read the Constitution ~ I don't believe he Understands what it means...
I'd say by the hundreds of great things he's done he is the greatest POTUS ever.   but the news refuses to talk about even one of them, brainwashing yu intellectually challenged into irrational anger, its called 'Trump derangement syndrome'  Whats your REAL issue? Get help! sigh
The trumpies I know honestly think his policies are Good.  They agree with his stance on immigration, China, and the economy.  They credit tRUMP for the booming economy &amp; stock market &amp; refuse to acknowledge that Obama put the country on the path to prosperity after a Recession.

There is still a lot of concern he is going to try and tie up the election results in court for as long as possible.  He is already laying the groundwork for that.  He is trying to deligitimize the results so his followers don’t accept his defeat.
Many of them are so focused on one issue, abortion, that they refuse to see Trump for the madman he is. Trump is capable of anything to prevent losing, including starting a war.

Actually, I've heard from a respected source that there is a good reason for banning Tik Tok. Not that Trump is doing it for this reason:  We need our tech sector to get busy and make a decent clone. I do love Tik-Tok.
I’d be sad too! I ready Mary Trump’s book- that family is BEYOND toxic
Pence is a nominally competent administrator.  He would listen to scientists, and is literate.  He probably would have pardoned trump, and found a way to shield him from state prosecution as well.   In a way, Pence would be worse, but i would guess less than 80k dead
Sounds like pipe dreams. Trump wins 2020 no matter what the media pushes forth, silencing the people, no matter if we cannot go to a rally. Reason is GOD that's right, God wins! God put Trump there in that seat to do his will. Don't like it? take it up w/ the big man upstairs.

It’s not a quincidence because they are demons. Makes from demon sperm, they are aliens and if you just listen to the smartest man in the world Trump you’d get it. He knows everything, better than everyone. Now get in line for your vaccine with tracking so we can send you ads.
Most Trump voters say they will not accept the results of election if Joe Biden wins. Naming mail-in ballots as reason.
Republicans are UnAmerican &amp; have BANKRUPTED the U.S.  Trump is Hoover #2 and presides over the 2nd Great Depression.  Trump failed at public health policy and preparations—more than 150,000 Americans DEAD from COVID under his watch.  RECORD Deficit  Trump—Incompetent, Unethical

The Polls were the same with Hillary. Voters will consider whether or not COVID-19 will be dangerous to them during November (typically flu Season) and the Democrats will likely stay home, while Anti-Science Republicans will Vote for Trump hoping to stop the Satanic Order.
Ben, I think you are overlooking the serious possibility that Trump might grab on to one of the legs of the Oval Office desk and refuse to let go. Then what?! CHECKMATE LIBS.
Pres. Trump votes by mail, as have military members since Civil War. Where’s the evidence of fraud? “Incidence of voter fraud in mail voting is about 0.00006% — about one ballot per state every six or seven years.” Your response shows the need for education—be well, Matt. #akleg

Just watched a news special re how restaurant workers are paid $2.13/Hour in many states &amp; even w/tips make poverty wages. &amp; yet...Kokomo, Indiana &amp; the state of Indiana voted for Trump in 2016. Can anyone explain WHY? WHY is the 2020 election even contestable? Incomprehensible.
That. Is. The. Sickest. Thing. I’ve. Ever. Seen. But my brother and mother think the same thing about Trump.  Jesus wasn’t playin’ when he said we are blind.
Biden can sit in his easy chair until Nov 3 and I’ll vote for him. Trump is insane and incredibly dangerous.

You might as well speak at a Trump Rally, too.
The tale of Narcissus is a warning.  Narcissus was cursed to obsess over his own perception of his "image"--transfixed by its greatness--'til he died from neglecting reality.  Trump spends all his time studying his image.  Trump neglects reality.

FUCKTARD TRUMP, your mother should have swallowed you. Just cause your finding out how many people hate you doesn't mean you get on your high horse
I’m not a fan of trump but this is the one good decision I think he’s made since he’s been potus
FUCKTARD TRUMP,  what's wrong? You mad cause no one says shit about you on Tik Tok? So you have to take it away. Your a fucking lil bitch boy. Grow the fuck up and do something other then fucking the U.S! Your a fucking bully and you need to be put in your place.
How can someone donate to Trump 2020 without going through the RNC or any other committee that supports RINOs or other nonre-election priorities?
Let me be clear. Hillary Clinton and G.W Bush are far more wicked people than Trump, in that they are Warmongers who have no problem killing Millions of People, mostly with brown colored skin.  Trump is evil for many things to be sure. But this is the problem with US Politics.
#PresidentSnowflake i dont really like tik tok, and how much data it takes, but trump banning it now is very clearly just petty retaliation to the fact that he got owned and cant maintain the perfect little illusion hes built for himself that he isnt a fucking loser
They (trump campaign) thought it would. Someone in DHS even said in an interview that pdx wax all about “creating viral content”. They want images of you guys doing stuff that looks scary. Deny them from having that! Dude trying to shut down fire is smart! Listen to him

There is a good chance Trump will succeed. He will remain in office despite the vote. And he will execute his political rivals. It's actually really common what he's doing.  Lots of us are going to die resisting him. I mean it. Lots of people.
Trump keeping another campaign promise.. American carnage  Al Franken: Trump’s handling of the pandemic ‘is the American carnage he was talking about’
Trump is an amazing forward thinker. Ex: India trade reset prior to China decouple&lt;— is an underreported massively impressive move. I am very curious to see what he is going to do. C19 cases dropping like a rock now, might be all better by then. Or vote over 3 days maybe.
The Supreme Court declined by a 5-4 vote Friday to halt the Trump administration's construction of portions of the border wall with Mexico following a recent lower court ruling that the administration improperly diverted money to the project.

People can be wooed over by crazy ideas and not be crazy. That's what is happening now. Republicans deny science, attack it, and Trump denies that there really is such a thing as truth at all.
If trump bans tik tok the nation is going to explode.

Alaskan here, Dan. You can’t have it both ways, supporting Trump’s incompetence in dealing with the virus (and everything else) while acting concerned about our health and the economy. Alaska has turned purple, show some deference to the 48% who are done with your partisanship.

No I accept what the FDA recommends based on their scientific review of trials. You just accept what Trump (a businessman) recommends at face value when giving advice on medicine. Just think about how ridiculous that is.
Every metric will be abused. Liking someone as a person  doesn't mean you think they, or the policies they represent, will be good for an important job. (In long run perspective, Hillary's was in the stratosphere. Biden's is merely awfully high, as is Trump's.)

I have a similar situation, but I'd say I had far more friends on the left than right. But, I've seen a lot of those on the left (particularly 2016 Bernie fans) turn into big Trump supporters. Nobody talks about Biden unless they are making a sniffing joke.

“Many voters who support the president live in a totally different, alternate information environment in which the news of Herman Cain’s death — his visit to the Trump rally, his decision to not wear a mask — won’t reach them.”
You are right! President Trump is terrified of the damage Joe Biden (Obama really) will do if elected. Quite frankly, so am I and a majority of Americans! What is even more scary is whom ever he chooses as VP running mate. Whom ever it is will take this country extremely far left
He is working overtime to defend Trump, it’s disgusting.
Imagine how terrifying Donald Trump would be if you buried him in the place above the Pet Sematary, where the ground is sour? I mean who would be able to tell the difference?   But still.
A shift to mail voting is increasing the chances that Americans will not know the winner of November’s presidential race on election night. But that doesn’t mean the results will be flawed or fraudulent, as President Donald Trump suggested.

Considering the “experts” have gotten it wrong on many things (fauchi mask flopping, covid patients to retirement homes...), perhaps the claim that “he isn’t a doctor” has less weight today than it used to. Trump making a management decision, influenced by experts is supported
(Narrator:   That's not at all what happened.)  Trump:  Delay Election?    Nope.  POTUS can't, won't happen.  Trump:  Glad to get MSM talking about RISKS of "mail-in".  Left MSM:   corrupt/dictator.  Right MSM:  (please forget what we said previously)
This sounds Way too much like Putin's attempt to hold office... We MUST Stop tRUMP. This is NOT Democracy in action.
18 U.S. Code § 2331.  TERRORIST LAW  28 C.F.R. 0.85  TERRORISM LAW  Which TRUMP and his ADMINISTRATION ALONG with BARR and PENCE have been committing
Comments coming out of the gop on this moot topic are their way of indirectly saying they want him out. tRump has no power to delay the election. Everyone but him knows this, because he spilled coke and ketchup all over his copy of the constitution while he was busy tweeting
18 U.S. Code § 2331. Section 5 DOMESTIC TERRORISM  This is what TRUMP is doing now in these MAJOR CITIES; PORTLAND, CHICAGO, DETROIT AND OTHERS,  28. C.F.R. 0.85 of the FEDERAL code on TERRORISM  Both have the death penalty or JAIL and $10,000 fine  or both
I AGREE, Senator. Thank you.  Now, please choose to represent Americans and disavow trump. #AmericaOrTrump
Unfortunately, Trump meets hate with hate.  His speeches &amp; Tweets deride the Dems, and anyone who disagrees with him.  Both Dems &amp; Repubs are at an impasse &amp; not working together.  We need new Leadership, &amp; Trump's tone is NOT unifying.  Why would you vote 4 more years of this?
TRUMP is more than petty he is a FULL BLOWN TERRORIST who does TERRORISM UNDER THE LAW  18 U.S. Code § 2331. Section 5  DOMESTIC TERRORISM
Agree. Thanks for the dialogue.  Do you think Trump's words and Tweets add to racial tension, police brutality, and mis-information regarding COVID?
How come your not dead yet? If Trump is who you say he is shouldn’t you be wearing goggles and a mask? Why not scuba gear and a plastic bubble. We are onto the scam. Take a hike....
Even if you manage to rig the election in your favor. Keep in mind the Democrats will win the Senate have power over the house and you will be impeached again. The Trump clown show is coming to an end.
Trump is on a path to change Alaska's environment more than any other state. This article focuses on Pebble mine, Ambler Rd and Tongass NF, but the administration also is making significant changes to the NPRA and the Arctic Refuge. #akleg
Even a rat will turn on you when it’s cornered. These are the words of a desperate scared individual. You know the end is near and you will do everything in your corrupt mind to prevent the end evitable. America is done with you impeach failure liar 45th president Donald J Trump.
Agree.Were you objective w/Obama? I was. Please list Trump accomplishments I see huge racial divide,greatest DROP in GDP (several times over), sky-rocketing Deficit &amp; Unemployment.  And when the tax break trump signed for middle-income Americans expires, our taxes will go Way Up.
Alaska’s Energy Desk reports that the largest U.S. national forest will probably be impacted by the Trump administration’s recent revisions to the National Environmental Policy Act.
The limb ALWAYS seems to get lobbed off behind them.  Must be some really good fruit, or they like looking like DOLTS.  (or Trump likes making them look like DOLTS).
I smell a coup . trump will not leave without a fight .
The more  and other media outlets even question something that is laid out plainly in the constitution, the more traction you will give tRump in trying to intervene in americans' right to vote on nov 3rd..stop with these ridiculous polls. Its moot
Just like Obama did. But got blamed for giving trump a bad turn over🤦🏽‍♂️
If you are a trump supporter I don’t understand how the hell you can support that pos.
Fuck trump
Yes.  Protesters need to get smart and go home when these guys arrive. Trump thrives on chaos.
Thank god Dr Fauci didn’t require masks for  dogs . If Trump had one, the dems would have made it mandatory
Yes, Trump supporters are absolutely stupid, 100% without question.
Trump floated delaying the November election. Here’s what Alaska’s congressional delegation says about that.
All the evidence you need to know about Barr licking trump’s boots.
Puerto Rico is fucked trump doesn't think they are part of America.  trump is now willing to hurt non racist white people in Portland brown people in Rico are doomed.
Sadly, I don’t see it happening. I wouldn’t put it past Biden to forgive Trump all his transgressions “in the interest of unity” ala President Ford and Nixon
Obama out here giving us verbal gymnastics. Some time today trump will stand in front of a mic a say i had a bigg-lee-rrrrr crowd the size no one ever seen before.
It’s pretty common among tin-pot dictators and fascists. Right down to the use of repetition, changes in tone and pace, and other speech patterns. A lot of what they say is nonsensical.  A Half-Century After Wallace, Trump Echoes the Politics of Division
When Moscow Mitch rejects Trump's nonsense, you know it's some next-level nonsense!
'We will not be leaving' Portland until 'safety' is restored: Trump   18 U.S. Code § 2331 Section 5 Also STATES that this ACT is  DOMESTIC TERRORISM  TRUMP PENCE and the ADMINISTRATION are TERRORIST
Herman Cain just died after catching COVID-19 at a Trump anti-mask rally a couple weeks ago
'We will not be leaving' Portland until 'safety' is restored: Trump   Under 28CFR 0.85 THIS IS THE ACT OF TERRORISM
Man trump has like 250 pounds on Obama.
My statement wasn’t why you thought Trump was dangerous, that’s too loaded of a question &amp; not fair to ask, I agree. You said he was the reason or createated (can’t remember which)Antifa &amp; BLM. I’m very confused by that since they are both Democratic groups.
The bounds of Trump's narcissism and quest for absolute power are truly frightening. This is the kind of rhetoric one would expect to see in Russia, North Korea, China, etc., but not in the United States of America. Trump is a menace. I'm quite scared.
Trump 2020
How have we sunk so low that trump is president? Watching President Obama giving John Lewis eulogy brings tears to my eyes.
I have a son who lives in Germany!! Believe me... Trumps working for Putin!! When has Trump ever been hard on Putin or Russia??!!!
Sounds like a threat but I’ll still be voting TRUMP
Your support of Trump is why you’re still at McDonalds! Stupid is... as stupid does!
President Donald Trump and his Democratic challenger, Joe Biden, both promise sweeping progress over the next four years — via starkly different paths.
They’re all afraid of Trump! Stupid asses should have voted him out of office at impeachment! Boom fear gone!!
I’m glad Trump wasn’t there. He didn’t deserve to be.
Herman Cain dies after contracting the Coronavirus, most likely at Trump's rally in Tulsa.
Cain loaded and handed the gun to trump . He deserves no pity
Yes!! Trump is lair, crazy, sick man! 🐍
Trump tweet about delaying election is just a tactic to make today about himself and not John Lewis and the praise he is getting from 3 former presidents and other dignitaries
US, BRAZIL, and INDIA. WE are in the same bracket as those countries in regard to covid infections. Jfc. Never thought we’d see the US in the same sentence in this type of failure. Ebola would have killed half of us had it hit w Trump running the country. That’s one thing to
Blow smoke up someone elses ass!! We already know it’s the Republicans! Lying and covering your asses. You people,thank God will be gone soon! Unbelievable! The Democrats have been fighting for the people to survive this pandemic. Not Trump!!
Donald Trump tweets desire to delay the election.
Why does a billionaire hang out with a pedophile especially after he was convicted? all pictures of Trump with Epstein are before his conviction and before Trump kicked him out of Mar-a-Lago for attempting to mess with a minor.
Yankees surprised by Trump announcing plans to throw first pitch without invite: NYT
Trump jr. Proves his irrelevance.   Donald Trump Jr. launches Twitter attack against “Democrat” Barbie
Factbox: What would it take to postpone the U.S. presidential election?  Even if Congress decided to delay the election, Trump’s presidential term would still end at noon on Jan. 20, 2021, a date that is set in the Constitution’s 20th Amendment.
Well, this explains the tweets by Trump on the election delay.  Any distractions, now matter how asinine, still distracts from this bleak news.
(28 C.F.R. Section 0.85). People NEED to know the TRUTH about what is TERRORISM TRUMP and his ADMINISTRATION is doing
American People what TRUMP is doing in PORTLAND, CHICAGO and other cities is the ACT OF TERRORISM; As well as the fact that he is doing the ACTS OF A DICTATOR which is in VIOLATION of the CONSTITUTION; TRUMP, PENCE, THEIR ADMINISTRATION, ALLIES AND BARR
Federal agents show stronger force at Portland protests despite order to withdraw    This PROVES that HOMELAND SECURITY AND BORDER CONTROL/CUSTOMS ARE NOTHING BUT LIARS AND WILL BREAK THE LAW FOR TRUMP THE DICTATOR
I think Trump thought he could actually kill off voters that wouldn’t vote for him! Now it’s Republican states and his people are dying and he’s freaking out!!
Let me put this as succinctly as I can: f*ck this guy | Trump floats November election delay, but it won't happen - KTVA 11 - The Voice of Alaska
Trump is a big fat idiot wrapped up in a moron. You don't got a clue how to lead. You are a coward. You are the worst president ever; you are the biggest embarrassment the world has ever seen. Stop being a whiny crybaby and take it like man.
He’ll get better ratings then Trump! That’s the way Trump will see it anyway!
Trump killed Herman Cain.
Why Trump Might Quit  via
Red with embarrassment for supporting Trump!!
It's not clear when or where Cain was infected, but he was hospitalized less than two weeks after attending President Trump's campaign rally in Tulsa
Trump is bumping off all members with this virus this is his warfare and you allow this
The dates of presidential elections — the Tues. after the first Mon. in Nov. in every 4th  year — are enshrined in federal law &amp; would require an act of Congress to change. The Constitution makes no provisions for a delay to the Jan. 20, 2021 inauguration.
You read the Bible? Does the Bible  promote Donald Trump’s racist views? Does the Bible support your racist tweet?! Are you saying poor people don’t work?! Ask Christ about poor people! Dumbass! Jesus would agree!
He died from the Trump Tulsa super spreader strain. What does he win Johnny?
Trump said 100,000 to 200,000 deaths would be a success. As countries have flattened the curve, didn’t go broke, didn’t ruin their economy, and didn’t have mass death.  This was preventable, and ruin was avoidable. Making it worse was optional, and that’s exactly what Reps did
So also, can we stop mocking the people who are preparing for the possibility that Trump won't leave office when he loses?
What are you high on? If you’re such a great President with a silent majority, what are you afraid of?? What’s fraudulent and inaccurate is this ridiculous lie you’re telling to steal an election!! The great embarrassment is Donald Trump!!
Thoughts? Should the election be delayed?  There is no evidence of widespread voter fraud through mail-in voting, even in states with all-mail votes.
Trump floats delaying the election, but he can't do that  via
trump wishes he could delay the election by executive order.
Trump for the first time floats a “delay” to November’s presidential election, as he makes unsubstantiated allegations that mail-in voting will result in fraud
Hooray for redlining and segregation! Looks like Trump takes after his old man. This is just a personal vendetta from the time he was charged for discriminatory housing practices.
I’m sure I’ll be corrected if I am wrong but I believe this is the first time we’ve seen President Trump call for a delay in the upcoming elections. Expect reaction from all sides to follow.
Trump is trying to interfere in our elections.
After nearly four years without one, the U.S. State Department again has a top-level official devoted to Arctic issues
Trump and his allies respond with pseudo-science as US death toll hits 150,000.
Now the MAGATS take over, inspired by the secret soldiers sent by Trump and his Wolf
PS I also respect the fact that you don’t like Trump.  He’s not everyone’s cup of tea.   I can’t stand Trudo.  I think he’s a two faced out for himself man as well.
Those deaths are Trump's responsibility. He wants to be the all-powerful, but he doesn't want to take any responsibility. If he had treated this pandemic seriously, he would have marshaled all the great US forces. Instead, he hindered, at every chance.
Hey, where's the Russian bots and Trump supporters?
Fauci is key member of the Deep State plot staging this Plandemic to create a crisis, establish mandatory vaccines, make Big Pharma and Bill Gates even wealthier, assert greater government control, and remove President Trump.
It appears to be the effects of a TIA --transient ischemic attack, or in common parlance, mini stroke.  In Trump's case, some/much of the related pathology has not resolved.
Trump's pulling troops out of Germany is a PAYMENT to Putin. It is a payment for Putin to put EVERYTHING THE RUSSIANS HAVE into subverting the November election.
She said she thought Trump had learned his lesson, and so she didn't vote to remove him. Look where that had gotten us. Either she is an idiot, or she was lying and don't care what befalls this country. Or both. She has to go.
Yes it is RACISM AND IT SHOWS THAT TRUMP IS ALSO A WHITE SUPREMACIST and in my opinion he is also part of the NEO NAZI MOVEMENT,  TRUMP IS A DICTATOR JUST LIKE ADOLF HITLER was during WWII
Pub. L. 103–322, title XXXIII, § 330016(2)(J), Sept. 13, 1994, 108 Stat. 2148.) So by FEDERAL LAW WHERE TRUMP IS ADDING RUSSIA IT IS TREASON AND PUNISHABLE BY DEATH OR IMPRISONMENT
she is living proof that ignorance is bliss and denial an even greater sign she suffers from 'TRUMP DERANGEMENT SYNDROME, cognitive dissonance, false equivalencies and the appearance she's in a childlike fantasy world. are any dems sane? help us God!
This shows the true TRUMP he is nothing but RACIST AND WANT TO SEGREGATE AMERICA AND TAKE US BACK 60 YRS
Trump is crippling NATO as a favor to Putin. This and Brexit Putin's long game. He wants chaos in the West. Trump gives him even more than he asks for.
So Kavanaugh and giving Trump a pass are in Maine's best interest? I don't think so. #GOPComplicitTraitors
TRUMP is a TERRORIST and TRAITOR to AMERICA and the REPUBLICAN SENATORS let him get away with the CRIMES
I have never understood anyone who is faithful to God backing Trump.  He had never seen or held a bible before he campaigned. Well maybe in a hotel room drawer.  Even talking about him makes me want to take a shower.
Without Democrat fraud he may. That’s why everyone who supports him, regardless of the state they live in needs to go out and vote!  I’ve heard IL and even NY has increasing Trump support. Alaska sure does.
Wow it’s the week for devils and demons! Trump must be so proud his makeup fell off.
July 19th (which feels like 5 years ago at this point) trump said:  "We're signing a healthcare plan within two weeks, a full and complete healthcare plan,"  That was 10 days ago.   There is no plan. But he’s glad he says so much stupid shit that no one will even question this.
is a rubber stamp for all things Trump.  Get him outta there!
The report gives recommendations for these problems, specifically encouraging 6 feet of social distance and for people to wear a cloth face covering indoors.
I personally would like an Alaskan to represent me in Washington, not a Ohio plant in Trump’s pocket. I’m voting for Dr Al Gross
I don’t even know what to say about this.   Trump administration COVID-19 task force urges #Alaska to require masks for seafood plants and hot spots - Anchorage Daily News
Now would be a good opportunity for Trump and his side to prove that hydroxichloriquine works. Maybe they don’t even believe what they say.
The Trump administration wants $377 million in the next coronavirus relief bill for a long-delayed modernization of the West Wing.
Proposed effective date for NEPA update is 9/14/20, subject to congressional (and presumably judicial) review. Based on EO 13807. Trump started gloating 3, maybe even 5 years too early.
I'v donated to your opponent and I don't even live in ME!  ME deserves more than a TRUMP STOOGE!!!
He was tested in a pre-screen at the White House before a scheduled trip to his home state with President Donald Trump.
Just like Biden said “you ain’t black”
There is a lot more to say about Biden and Harris but would you listen?
U vote for everything that is wrong inthis country? What has Biden done? Made his son &amp; family members rich w/ deal from China &amp; Ukraine. What has Harris done for this country? Locked Black men up for life over weed &amp; withheld evidence that would free a man on death row,
I’m right there with your mom. Always a conservative, but not alway R, registered independent. Trump has radicalized me so far Left I’m ready to literally die to vote for Biden/Harris. #GenXmomsforBiden
This isn’t even a mediocre effort at a diversion tactic. The President is in front of the American people almost daily. We don’t see Biden for more then 3 minutes at a time. Sometimes in a week. How can that be ok with anyone?
You have a right to your opinion. I'm thinking of the enormous amount of damage that could be done by another Trump term. In spite of Biden's faults, I don't think he's a wannabe dictator. And Kamala Harris really helps the ticket.
It’s simple! Don’t Vote for Biden or support Yuppie Asshole Sellout Democrats. Their days are over! It’s time to stir up some major shit and agitate like hell! Revolution is in the air!
Is it Anonymous policy to throw comrades under the bus to save themselves AKA abandon victims of Scientology? And you criticize Biden for not doing more to help victims? Hypocrites. Cowards. BTW, Anon has an ableist problem- might wanna do something about that, "freedom fighter".
What do you mean just like Biden??
Take a shot every time Bernie endorses the ticket. And another one every time one of you says, “Biden and Trump are the same.” Or “The movement is bigger than Bernie.”
Kamala Harris believes that Joe Biden sexually assaulted women. She's on the record
I'm beating a dead horse, but I keep bringing up Scientology and the truth about them being a cult, because there are plenty who criticize Republicans, Donald Trump, Joe Biden, Democrats, Putin, CCP, etc. Anonymous criticizes all.  Who criticizes Scientology? Besides Leah Remini?
You can twist &amp; squirm, tell lies, hypnotize him, drug him, rehearse in for hours &amp; hours, but FACTS R, Hidin' Joe Biden' looks like a wax figure, READS from notes, refuses any interviews, walks like zombie, has dementia &amp; should B in a home! R U CRAZY?  Elderly ABUSE, NO DOUBT!!

joe biden is not flexible on policy. how on earth could you think he is
Only if Trump were to win. Biden/Harris winning would make up for a LOT of 2020 misery.
Biden sold us t China #trump t us out of the war and now they are with us against Iran  in peace .Obama  sold us to Iran and kept the war going to tear our military down t nothing and raked in millions for him self then gave Iran 5.5 billion to Iran soooo your  we’re saying
I already requested a mail-in ballot a month ago so I could vote for Joe Biden and maybe make Benedict Ronald McFrump unhappy, since he's killing the American dream for millions.   Thank you, Trump, for the stimulus check- I bought a #GoJoe button with it. #SaveUSPS #BidenHarris
You talk like Joe Biden won’t be around much longer.
The voters are left an joe biden is right of Trump
And this is what Hillary would do to Biden just so she could be POTUS. (From House of 1000 Corpses)
There are two Fascists running against each other who hate Black People.  You have fun picking between the two, cause Biden is the One who made sure Blacks stay in Jail for good.  Those of us who aren’t Suckers have a Revolution to start!
Biden will not save us from anything. In fact, be prepared for more Wars, likely with Iran and Venezuela, which is the real reason the Establishment/Resistence hates Trump so much.   The Manufacturering Consent is on behalf of the Military Industrial Complex.
Bring it. You may be useful yet. Biden will get us into WW3 for the sake of Israel.
If Biden takes the White House, Progressives are sure to be kneecapped until 2032.   We must either seek 3rd Party or just plain ole Revolutionary Tactics. The Democratic Party is poison.
😀 This is good, VERY GOOD❗️😎🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸 Every time a liberal asks you why hasn’t Trump done this or that! Ask them why Obama and Biden didn’t do it! Then tell them President Trump will get to it! - Join the conversation on
You cut up a bunch of video clips to make things fit. The President works harder than most and comes back the next day. All you have to do with Biden is leave the camera and mic on for 5 minutes. If he’s allowed to speak at all.
I hope 2021 can be Absinthe (with Joe Biden as our President).
Great Song With Truth Message-No Biden (Original Song)  via
This man is a terrorist using his money to cause division in this country.  He has bought Biden &amp; Harris.  Harris has let it slip that if elected she will do an executive order to take our guns.  I did not know vp’s can do that only presidents,
Absolutely!All our energy should be on voting for Biden.  Then we can dump him off to the side or go after him.  If Biden is elected, so much goes in to fixing the mess he made for the American people and with our allies. It will keep him and us busy for  the first four years.
Wow! Together, we can Fight the Power as we enter a Brave New World. Joe Biden is the Scarecrow in the Wizard of Oz, and Trump in the Tinman. Amerikkka is the Evil Empire from Star Wars.  We need to be all new Characters!!
Do you know if there is a backup plan for when Donald Trump refuses to leave office if we had a legitimate election where Joe Biden is the clear winner? Is there a plan for if Trump refuses to leave? What if he uses direct force, and murders congressmen to retain the White House?
Is that you SMH? campaining for Joe Biden? Be careful what you wish for.....
Inappropriate, unconstitutional, treasonous... Alaskans, let’s vote Biden. I know the GOP likes to scare us that 2A is in danger, but it’s not. 2A will be fine. It always is. Plus nothing is worse than this unpatriotic traitor.
Biden a racist? I will refrain from additional remarks. Are you a Russian bot? A trump supporter?

Today's #FederalBudget Note| Even before COVID, federal deficits were on track to &gt; $1T/yr. Trump proposes to reduce revenues even further (w/o offsetting spending cuts); Biden proposes to raise revenues (but w/ spending increases). NEITHER is helpful.
Many people see Biden suffers cognitive issues and media is trying to cover for him. Neither will take questions from reporters at events. He makes racist remarks. She culturally appropriates as African-American when she isn’t. Dems continue to be the party of racism and hate.
LOL.  Right along the lines of "Biden is not capable of debating" to "Biden is a stellar debater".   HAHAHA     Trump is like a pane of glass.
Trump and Biden the same mf. USA u are f****d.
The National Association of Letter Carriers represents 300,000 people. It said Trump has long been hostile to the Post Office, calling for an end to collective bargaining rights, proposing service cuts and eyeing the possibility of privatizing the agency.
We were already going to vote for Biden!  I refer you to the Women's March that occurred when this administration began!  We haven't forgotten.
Michael Cohen has no credibility. But even Kamala Harris believes the most recent sexual assault victims of Joe Biden.
Joe Biden’s hypocrisy exposed
Dear NRI community in USA. Stay away from Joe Biden and Kamla. 🙏
Are you doing endorsement ads for Biden/Harris now? Seems off-brand.
If you are in the middle of a disaster, are you going to be picky about who rescues you?  We picked Biden to offer a middle road alternative to people like you.  We are trying here, meet us in the middle.
So he said Mandatory for three months because of the election Joe Biden is already starting to be a dictator he has no authority to do so and I’m telling you don’t do it you wear your mask inside only an outside no he wants more people to die
President Donald Trump on Thursday attacked Joe Biden for calling on governors to mandate that all Americans wear masks for the next three months.
Biden’s Busing Blues.   ‘It was just a bus’
YouTube is desperately trying to help elect Joe Biden president
They lead by example &amp; I hope that shows people the difference between Biden &amp; Trump.  Y do we still have an electoral college?Hilary would have been our President since she won by popular vote, but lost to Trump due to the electoral college.I hope history does not repeat itself.
The debate over masks has moved to the presidential race.
Kamala Harris was selected by Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden to serve as his running mate
My vote will go to the most conservative of the candidates.  My vote will go to the devout catholic.  My vote will go to the gun owner.  My vote is for a science based approach to the pandemic. My vote is for racial &amp; gender equality.  My vote is for Biden/Harris. #BidenHarris
Thank you team Biden Harris #BidenHarrisAdministration
Tweeting is nice, but more important:  VOLUNTEER.  This is how we get a Biden/Harris win!  #BidenHarris
This is why high voter turnout is KEY.  We HAVE to outnumber these voters. We all need to volunteer  the local level for get out the vote help. Local volunteering, all across the U.S., will ensure a Biden/Harris win!!  #BidenHarris2020
If Progressives continue with the Establishment in the Democratic Party, the Movement could be squashed till 2032.  It’s time for us to try a different Route and use force if necessary.  Biden/Harris is a travesty.
I’m surprised that Biden is still alive. I think he’s had a stroke or something. There’s at least a 50% chance he dies in Office.  The GOP will implode Post Trump. The Free Traders are gone, and it’s like Pat Buchanan somehow took over the Party with his views.   Who knows?
i want to support biden but i can’t get over those vids of him grabbing young girls and sniffing their hair! #CreepyJoeBiden
There is nothing left to talk about. Progressives speaking on behalf of Biden make me sick. It’s time to fight the System with force. Talk is cheap. I’m done asking nicely! Fight the Powers that Be!
Same place they make Biden. Some machine made by the KKK.
All the Bushies are with Biden now, so piss off Fascist Clown!
Better than being in the George W Bush fan club with Bill Kristol, David Frum, Carl Rove and the rest of your Genocidal Friends who now are in love with Biden.
I think Biden &amp; Harris have been wearing their masks 24/7.  Breathing their own carbon monoxide has damaged their brain &amp; their way of thinking. The Democrats keep pushing &amp; we will have a Civil War.
Stand for something or we are all moving on. Many of us are Voting 3rd Party because the Democrats are pointless. I like the few real Progressives, like you, who are fighting with all their might against the Corruption.  But We will NOT tolerate Biden or Cuck 1% Demon Dems!
I was so moved when She showed us that Biden is a Racist Asshole.
Bad take Brother West. I doubt Malcolm-X would find any hope in a Biden Presidency, whatsoever. Place wake up!!
Biggest load of crap I ever heard.  Biden said MOST votes &amp; voices in America matter, he is pos, a crook, liar, racist &amp; has abused power of his office.  Who does he pick as his vp another pos, crook, liar, racist, has abused power of her office
Just remember that Biden and Trump are basically Nazis.   I mean....who said that Blacks are all the same? David Duke or Joe Biden?
BIDEN ISNT A SCIENTIST! BIDEN ISNT A PRESIDENT! Trump is. Now eat 💩
Joe Biden calls for national mask mandate. Because that's what leaders do.
needs to put together a video of Biden and Harris walking up and down ramps. #TrumpIsUnwell
And it only took a couple of minutes for Lyin-Biden to come out and try to take credit for the corrupt Obama administration!
Ever watch one of the many videos of racist Biden sniffing or  grabbing children? How about Biden’s most recent accusers of sexual assault. Kamala said she believed those women.
I just watched Joe Biden on camera being asked the question and he said that everybody should be mandated to wear a mask outside everybody should be mandated to wear a mask outside
She is a liar a smear of innocent people she hates everybody that is not her she spews hatred out of her mouth every time she opens it if people vote for her and Joe Biden I don’t know what this country is going to look like because it won’t look like America our freedoms gone
Because President Trump only speaks the truth he’s never told anybody a lot about anybody and Carmella Harris is a pothead lying liberal left Democrat Joe Biden poor man has dementia
These people of You want to call him that are cahooyinh with China Pelosi said it herself in an interview she said China would prefer Biden if that isn’t colluding I don’t know what it is
Biden isn’t the fucking president!!
At least they've finally stopped railing on Biden for never having had a boat parade. That was devastating, let me tell you.
Make America great again.  Vote Biden?
They are really threatened by this woman!! That tells me how good she really is! I’m voting Biden /Harris!
I will never forget how she decididly and unequivocally knocked his dick into the dirt.  That is why I am happy she is Biden’s running mate.
Joe Biden is calling for a nationwide protective mask mandate, citing health experts’ predictions that it could save 40,000 lives from coronavirus over the next three months.
They’re cracking the whip as the Plantation Owners defending the Interests of the 1%.  And anyone who defends Biden has Stockholm Syndrome.
if you believe you can bully Biden to the left I’m gonna bully you until you’re a ML

Franklin Graham warns Biden-Harris ticket ‘should be a great concern to all Christians’  #FoxNews   These are the same 'Christians'   that claim to be 'Pro-Life'.
As long as the Republican Party has the Senate Majority, Biden (or any Democrat) will be basically powerless. We saw it with Obama and the Affordable Care Act.
I bet most of the people saying they’re voting for Biden so they can “hold him accountable” don’t even know what Senate seats are up for grabs in November. Or how important it is to flip the Senate.
Impeached failure 45th president Donald J Trump was beaten in a landslide victory by the Biden Harris administration. It was a landslide defeat like no other election has seen in the history of the electoral college. #Bye-byeDumbAssTrump
The Senate has the real power not the president and y’all can’t even hold your senators accountable now so what makes you think you’ll be able to hold Biden accountable later?
Why don’t y’all hold your elected officials accountable and make them stay in session until they reach a deal? Or do y’all just plan on holding Biden accountable once he’s president?
I second this opinion please get out n vote. That’s why they make the polls looks like Biden has it by a landslide . So people will just give up
I first read that as "Biden uses PUNS as an inspirational example..."  Almost had me there.
I'm depressed about this. What good is voting for Joe Biden if Donald Trump steals the election anyway? It would feel like a pointless exercise in democracy rather than the real thing.
Biden-Harris ticket will save our country from this MAD man, and right wing conspiracy theory media people like yourself.  #TrumpFailedAmerica  #Covid_19
Every single American should be wearing a mask when they’re outside for the next three months at a minimum.'
Joe Biden can say whatever he wants- until Joe's in the White House, his words have no weight and are therefore meaningless.  Remove. Trump. to. save. democracy. NOW.  #ImpeachHimAgain #CensureTrump
Supports Joe Biden’s sexual assault of Tara Reade!
Anyone who says Biden has done more harm than Trump is a damned fool.
Trump: If Biden gets elected, he's gonna crash the economy  The economy:
You and Biden just asked for a national mask mandate. This gives citizens an idea of how your first response is to step to over-reaching Control of the people.
Biden and Harris if ever was voted in would be the hypocritical xenophobic bigoted corrupt traitors in chiefs in the Demonrats country were laws are none existent if you break any nothing happens because: “No laws for me but for the.”
So someone in Russia created an "Antifa" website and linked it to Joe Biden's campaign. Weird.
Fuck joe Biden
Next line of attack:   Joe Biden would just be a puppet of the Trump agenda. Is he actually Trump? Where's his birth certificate showing that he's not Donald Trump? Shouldn't we stay the course rather than risk electing Donald Trump?
How can GOP question Joe Biden's faith when they support a faux Christian ammoral dictator for president
Biden was involved in extrotion from Ukraine and Obamogate.
The next Biden-Harris campaign ad.
If Biden puts out nothing but reviews of sick cars for the rest of this election run up I’ll vote for him.
It feels like Kamala is running for President not Biden
Not a single drug company sponsored ad supporting Biden/Harris has aired in Alaska or Chicago.
They all need to be rallying people to vote every single day, and to support not just the Biden/Harris presidency but also to denounce Trumpism and vote out every Trump sycophant enabler in every election.   #BidenHarris  #TrumpIsANationalDisgrace
Does this mean that the model says that Biden has a 3% chance of getting 470+ electors?
Kamala Harris Lies Repeatedly in First Speech as Biden’s Running Mate
And when Biden &amp; Harris continue to allow police to run rampant, continue to limit us to ineffective half-measures against the pandemic because full measures are "too expensive", &amp; refuse to bail out anyone who isn't a billionaire, guess who they'll want in 2024?  Someone else.
Biden will likely win not because people appreciate the Democratic party's "restraint" in avoiding "too much" responsibility to the population, but rather because the pandemic, police brutality, &amp; economic collapse are causing people to simply want "someone else" in charge
Joe Biden raised $26 million in the 24 hours after he named Kamala Harris as his running mate.
Thank you, Dr. Biden. Social Security is vital to retired and disabled Americans.  But why not expand Social Security for all? We can give everyone a monthly income, irregardless if they have a disability or have advanced in age.  #SocialSecurityForAll #UBI #UniversalBasicIncome
The Government is the people. The White House is just a building. Trump won’t leave? So what? Turn the power off. Turn the water off. Biden can live somewhere else and govern just fine. For that matter we can blow it up and build anew. Trump has tainted that house anyway.
Yes ma’am ... very thrilled with his choice and I think they will make a great team !! Go Biden
If you when, this nation will be divided even more than it is now!!  You are just a puppet on the string.  Hidin’ Biden!!
Kamala Harris Is Perfect  - REEEeeeee Stream  via  More black peoples killed by #blm than cops this year. No Biden! These racists, bad #communists #Marxism #racist #front #wolfsinsheepswool
watching my friends go from "WOO FUUUUCK YEAH BERNIE" to "ugh fine i'll vote biden" has been fun to watch
So his long will it take to get the Biden Harris year I just ordered?  #USPSisEssential
With Kamala on the ticket I feel good. Biden's experience and her energy and new ideas, I'm finally excited.  In 2016 I wanted to stop Trump. This one is so much more than that. This is about stopping Trumpism and sending a message to the world.  We're back!! #BidenHarris2020
I want biden to lose just to see the Khive meltdown and also the Democrats really deserve it
I don't think we have to back burner it at all, if anything we need to push for progress harder. Biden was the wrong pick imo, but all over the country progressives are winning, and pollijg indicates the majority of voters are on that side of policy.
I thought Biden was at least a smarter politician than that. Of all the years to put in a cop as VP, this was probably not the year.
I assume you’re taking Biden where a cognitive decline is concerned.
Amen to that! Biden isn’t  my choice but it is THE choice I will go with to save America. To save children stolen from their parents at the border and thrown into cages. The choice I will pick to hopefully save millions of lives from death by covid. For OUR FUTURE as a republic.
Sure shows Biden in great shape!  Unlike an obese person!
I thought it was a parody. But Biden and Harris are promoting this. Not a great look for either of them.
She was nasty towards Biden she was very nasty and he told the true that she was very nasty towards biden they are evil and vile towards trump and they tell lies as they do so but trump told the truth I watched it she was nasty towards biden
Fear, violence and trauma is what the Democrats are unleashing where they govern. Biden/Harris is bad for business, bad for freedom, bad for security and safety.
Now that it's official and Biden has picked Kamala Harris as his VP, I'm wondering how  is feeling. If she could turn back time, do you think she would have claimed she was 1/1064th African American if it would help her secure a nomination?
You can’t starve a nation of decency for so long and expect us to listen to your toxic drivel. Especially not after getting what we need from Biden and Harris.
Elizabeth is keeping her promise through Joe Biden’s choice of Kamala.
Can Kamala Harris and Joe Biden Defeat Trump?
Oh please. Who has gone to the Supreme Court to overturn the ACA. It's not Biden. Trump wants to do away with healthcare, social security and medicare. Desparation makes you kue more
And if you’re not abstaining from voting or voting third party, then what is ripping Kamala apart accomplishing other than advancing a conservative agenda? Once elected, we can demand better from Biden/Harris, but criticizing them now only helps Trump.
To clarify, Biden is absolutely not remotely my number one choice and I recognize Kamala’s controversial past. It’s just baffling to me that we’re debating their backgrounds with civil rights given who they’re up against...it should be a no brainer
The fact that they're attacking Biden for being a Muslim/Sharia law-bringer makes me feel 5% less bad about them attacking Obama for it.
So if biden were president,  there'd be no deaths? How can you be so ignorant?
In  First speach with Biden. Close to quoting as I can: [Trump] inherited one of the strongest economies in history. Like everything else he’s inherited, he’s driven it into the ground. #burn #truth
Watching Joe Biden and Kamala Harris and i'm not gonna lie, it's giving me a feeling of hope for our country that I haven't felt in a LONG time. #VoteBidenHarris2020
Trump had the HIGHEST EMPLOYMENT RATE of EVERY RACE in US HISTORY!! We had a thriving economy until the pandemic. You’re delusional. Biden said as soon as he’s president he going to get busy undoing everything Trump did. As a Mexican woman &amp; small business owner, this scares me.
Watching this Biden/Harris event. Kinda forgot what coherent, articulate leadership sounds like.
I’m working from home, listening to Biden and Harris give hope back to an emotionally threadbare nation.  It is a good day.
President Biden and Vice President Harris.🇺🇸
America already knows...that you will not find a jacket with "I really don't care" written on the back...hanging in Dr. Jill Biden's closet. #FirstLady  #BidenHarris2020
Biden is still the lead. You didn't make America great again. You made it worse!
Can we have a tee-shirt made for Kamala that reads "Thx Donald &amp; Ivanka for the campaign donation"...and then have her wear it on the night (fingers crossed) she and Biden win? 😛 #BidenHarris2020
Donald Trump dislikes Joe Biden's new running mate so much that he donated more than once to her campaigns.
both trump and biden suck ass, but biden is the lesser of the two evils. he’s the one who will most likely listen to us and do what we, as a country, ask him too. both of them are absolutely horrendous, but we have to get trump out before he does more damage.
Good thing it’s Biden.. how would you have impersonated anyone else? 😂
We don't. we're concentrating on putting criminals like Comey, Strozk/Page, Mueller, Schiff, HRC, H. Biden, 3-4 RINOS, 12+ libelous news folk, et al, in jail. Then expose Obama, Biden, Rice et AL 4 illegal acts against mR Trump &amp; Gen Flynn! Wha?? you're not laughin' now, Bob???
You see Biden’s cognitive decline as your opportunity to become President.
President Trump was asked about Joe Biden's VP pick, Sen. Kamala Harris at Tuesday evening's coronavirus press briefing. The president said, "...we’ll see how she works out. She did very, very poorly in the primaries..." and that he was "a little surprised that he picked her."
A Biden presidency is not objectively good; it does literally nothing to solve any of the problems we’re currently trying solve in America; that’s all I’m saying; obviously I’m voting Biden Sam I’m not an idiot, but it’s not a revolutionary act
Yes but the people who are specifically oppressed under Trump won’t stop getting oppressed under Biden, so it doesn’t matter; the only actions that matter are ones that will actually work against systemic oppression
And it will be effectively the same under Trump again or Biden; that’s our privilege
#Biden choosing #Harris as his running mate is a wink to white capitalists that he doesn't give a fuck about police brutality
Happy to have  in Alaska visiting our beautiful state! He went on record with  discussing how the #BidenHarris ticket could be disastrous for #energy workers here and across the US. Biden would end leasing on federal lands - goodbye #ANWR!  Fight on, Ted!
Russia doesn’t want Joe Biden and Kamala Harris to win in November. They should be elected on this issue alone.
I can understand voting for Biden over Trump all day long, but I cannot abide voter shaming. Its a form of abuse.  Appeal to nonvoters. Reason with nonvoters.
This past weekend I was riding bikes over on the Campbell creek trails and saw a person standing in the middle of the woods with 24x36 United for Biden sign.
The big one being corporate sellout. Biden is also clearly a classist who Isn't willing to listen to the working class which you can see in many interviews he's done where he'd rather insult someone than answer a question/concern that is brought up. Yes I know trump does the same
If y'all need to tell yourselves that Biden/Harris is a great ticket to make what we have to do in November less distasteful then go for it, but trying to chill speech about how they are not utter trash is really wierd imo
Not a good pic. Harris looks engaged. Biden looks lost. Looks like he’s smiling but with an expression like he’s not sure what he’s smiling about.
Biden is Trump...but with more Wars coming.:.. And if you’re looking for etiquette....please!!! Every other day is a Racist Tweet worthy of a David Duke....
Listen, Sellout Yuppie Takei. If You think Biden is the answer to anything, you’re a pathetic Clown. Biden is a Mother Fracker, a Prison Industrial Complex Master in Chief for Private Prisons, an ICE Maker, a Warmonger, and he doesn’t have a brain left.
Ok but also don’t you dare tell me to think about the bigger picture vis a vis Biden/Harris when all of these protests have been not just about police brutality, but that incarceration in this country is just the new face of slavery, and in America rn there is no bigger picture
I totally love Biden’s shirt “You won’t have to worry about my tweets when I’m President.”  They have my vote!
I fully get it. The center left picked Biden &amp; Harris so the Right can’t play the ‘socilaism &amp; defund the police’ angle against the left.  It’s gonn work, if the far left will come over and vote for a centrist law and order ticket like Biden Harris.
Today is my goal to get rid of as many fucking false democrats as I can. And by false democrats, I mean everybody who does not support Biden/Harris. Everybody else who has a weird gripe can go to hell.
Im voting for Biden but betting on Trump.
I'm going to vote for Joe Biden because his economic and environmental policies are more to my liking than Trump's but I'm not going to kid myself that either Biden or Harris care about me or my caste of society. These fucking people are delusional.
How considerate of Rs and why not spruce it up for Biden and Harris?
Sounds like you are suggesting a way to hide Biden’s cognitive challenges.
I still feel sorry for Hiden Biden. At least he can read so he must have gone to a private school! Joe Biden Reads from Script While Talking to Kamala Harris on Zoom  via
Biden got over it. It’s a good quality.
Definitely! Within MINUTES of Biden’s announcement..Trump posted his first lie-filled tweet !
I believe Biden/Harris will do more for marginalized people in one week than Trump has done in 4 years. If you want to bring about change, start on 11.4.20 after you help elect the ticket endorsed by Bernie Sanders.
Like someone said, having Trump as president is like being in a room with a 2-year old holding an automatic weapon. I’m voting for Biden/Harris because they’re adults. We can look at the fine print after we disarm Trump.
Bernie supported the NRA. For years. He voted YES for the 1994 Crime Bill. To equate Trump and Biden is ignorant, at best. As David Sedaris said, it’s like being unable to decide between a chicken sandwich and a shit and ground glass sandwich.
Well thats not entirely true, but I get the point. I honestly don't like any options they're all bad candidates, but I'd rather see a biden win than trump
What would be dumb is for anyone with even 1/2 a progressive brain to throw shade on Biden/Harris.
2 choices. Trump or Biden. What’s it going to be?
Fuck Joe Biden
Trying to deflect negative attention from Bernie while trying to smear Biden/Harris? Give it up. Bernie went the way of the buffalo. You’re helping Trump now. Knock it off.
most significant movement against police brutality and racial injustice in decades: exists  joe biden: makes a cop his vp 🤡
My Favorite part about Rumpty's Rant is his accusation that Kamala Harris was 'very disrespectful' to Joe Biden, right after he refers to Senator Warren as 'Pocahontas'! 😂🤣😂🤣😂
Joe Biden was 52 years old in 1994 so anybody that thinks he made an honest mistake is just being naive.
I figured Biden would pick Harris.  I didn't predict it would feel this good. Hopeful.
Only a combination of Joe Biden and Hillary Clinton could have upstaged Trump.... Trust Trump to give her a nickname😀
Lmao Kamala???? What a joke. More Prisons, less Schools. She has a good chance of being the 1st Woman ever to be VP. So sad and pathetic...just like Rapist Biden.
She's a high dollar prostitute. Called out Biden as a racist and now joins his team.
Former Republican vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin is congratulating Kamala Harris on the historic nature of being selected as Joe Biden's running mate — and offering some advice on how best to fill the role.
Calling a  Biden/Harris ticket extreme and radical is like calling wine coolers the hardest alcohol you can drink #JoeBidenForPresident2020 #Trump2020 #KamalaHarris #BidenHarris2020
Nice meme even though Biden has been on record saying he doesn’t support defunding the police. This should’ve surprised no one.
Disagree...Trump's no angel but he's not intimidated by anyone; Dems or Reps...he's arrogant and abrasive at times, but we need someone like that to fix this country. He's been true to his word on most of his promises.  Biden changes his mind with the prevailing political winds.
I got your previous comment about partisanship...bad assumption on my behalf. I wouldn't disagree with your comment about the parties. So, it's really about who is right for this country at this time...not Biden-Harris.
Biden was in office for 8 yrs as VP.  I wonder why he didn't do that...
It came out of her mouth....also said she believed Biden's accusers. I've seen Trump do more for this country in 3 yrs than I saw out of Obama in 8 yrs. I was a former Obama voter. Don't drink the Dem's kool-aid, they are liars &amp; thieves. Join the MAGA train, it's not too late.
liberals who think that racism is defined by simply things that white people do black people are the same people who think Kamala Harris is gonna save the Biden campaign in November🤡
Guaranteed, decision was made FOR Biden, not From Biden. 🙈🙊🙉🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
Wow the left is so desperate for Trump to have the tiniest slip up mean while Biden can’t even make a full sentence
Even if Biden had the answers he still couldn’t get them correct.
In choosing Harris, Biden is embracing a former rival from the Democratic primary who is familiar with the unique rigor of a national campaign.  Story:
Yes, Harris losing to Pence would be better than Biden absolutely obliterating himself - if you, like Bill Kristol, are a progressive.
I 100% agree. She would have give Biden a chance and would have been the only hope the Dems had for a viable candidate.
You must know, You are NOT voting for Biden, you will actually be Voting for his VP, so Left agenda can be fulfilled in the destruction of the American people and Country as a whole
Democrats backing Harris and Biden proves how wishy washy they are  If it’s a cop or rapist who’s a republican it’s evil and cruel, but if it’s democrats it’s fine You know as shitty as Republicans are at least they are consistently shitty
I may be crazy but today’s revelation of Biden/Harris ticket reminds me of 2 movies: Dumb &amp; Dumber, and Liar Liar.
It’s interesting, Trump says something wrong the media has a field day with it.  Biden does it and the media doesn’t care.
Yeah I only know her from her sus DA work and from everyone clowning her so thought I’d ask. I think Biden wins with this VP pick
I had not seen Biden's profile before now
I want real change and I know we’re going to have to fight for it. Bowing down to the Biden/Harris ticket is actually sending the opposite message, one that says we’re complacent enough with the bullshit that we’ll allow it to happen for four more years.
Biden is not in control. They picked her FOR him.
Smart, tough and a great choice for Biden! I’m very glad he chose her..total class !!
SO LOOKING FORWARD TP DEBATE BETWEEN TRUMP N biden THAN THE ONE BETWEEN OUR VP N LYING kamala
Hopefully Biden can bail her out to put his name on the bus with hers now.
WOW JUST SEEN. biden AD ON TV. THREW UP IN MY MOUTH OT WAS SO FILL OF B.S.
Other things I won’t forget  is that you whored your way up in politics, kept innocent black men in jail &amp; stated you believe Biden’s multiple accusers. You have the exact same warmth as Hillary, that of a reptile. Can’t wait to see what else America finds out.
Biden should be in jail not running for president.
I personally think a vote for Biden is saying that the poor children that he took advantage of don’t matter. We’ve all seen the videos of him touching girls inappropriately with cameras rolling. Imagine what he does when there’s no cameras around. It makes me sick to my stomach.
She may or may not be a lot of things. I would hardly label her or Biden as progressives - but they aren't fascists, and they are the best choice we have right now. Not sure how there can be any debate on the matter unless one digs what's going on right getting even worse.
In my opinion you can’t be down with BLM and vote for Biden. It’s hypocrisy.
Everybody that is down with the Black Lives Matter movement but  voting for Biden, who is/was a HUGE part of the problem we’re fighting to fix, needs to do their research. Watch 13th on Netflix. Something.
I am still baffled by the the trumpers saying they are a big tent, but reject any moderates as RINOs.  They have seriously abandoned them and forced the rep mods to vote for Biden.
Joe Biden’s pick can’t be disappointing at this point because he’s such a failure himeself  Having said that it’s disappointing lol
‘Vice President Kamala Harris’ has SUCH a Beautiful sound to it!!  🤗🤗🤗  #Kamala #Kamala #KamalaHarrisForVP  #Biden  #BidenHarris2020Landslide
Any good Biden/Harris gear? Preferably where the profits go to the campaign? The Biden site just has boring stuff for now.
Nobody cares.  #Biden  #KamalaHarrisForVP  #Kamala #Kamala #BidenHarris2020
Yeah, it's Biden/Harris!
the Biden/Harris ticket IS in favor of police reform, actually. if they win, the cops will be dual-weilding
This dynamic is perplexing.  Team #MAGA is all about supporting Police, yet their strategy is to paint Biden/Harris as tough on crime?  HUH?  I'm no Democrat, but this really seems disingenuous.  (Sarcasm)  LOL
Disrespectful women!   I love them I am one.  I’m so glad Biden picked Sen Harris.  This makes my day
Lowering expectations for Trump already?  I thought it was going to be Biden Gaffe City?
I wish Biden was the monster your think he is.
Again vote for Biden if that’s what you decide, but don’t try and guilt other people who are grappling with this difficult decision, just because need to pretend you’re not voting for a shitty person
I’m not saying you shouldn’t vote for Biden, but you can’t present him as a morally/mentally superior option to Trump, because he simply is not; if you really need to vote for ‘the right person’ to make you feel like you’re doing the right thing:
Ok but for real, for a lot of people a Biden presidency and a Trump presidency are functionally equivalent; so if you’re about to make a post about how imperative it is to vote for Biden to oust Trump, just take a second and think about who in America needs help right now and who
Wow Kamala Harris as VP? Wow that’s a Top choice by Biden 👏🏻👏🏻
Neither are my 1st choice. But we get no real progress in America until unlimited corporate spending on elections &amp; policy issues stops polluting outcomes. That requires a Supreme Court change. That requires we get Biden in and Trump out #KamalaHarris
Biden the ultimate clout chaser 😅
I don’t know what to say other than this. Neither are my 1st choice. But we get no real progress in America  until unlimited corporate spending on elections &amp; policy issues stop polluting outcomes. That requires a Supreme Court change. That requires we get Biden in and Trump out
I hope people that want to vote for Biden do. I don’t want Trump in office either. But forcing people to vote against their best interests is not how the DNC should’ve handled things again. If Trump wins it’s bc the DNC failed to pick the right candidate to go up against Trump.
At this point almost anything is better than Trump/Pence and I'm going to try and focus on the positives of the Biden/Harris ticket, we all need to come together and get the current admin OUT. It does make me feel good to be witnessing such an important moment in history, though.
Joe Biden picks Kamala Harris as his running mate!
This is what Biden's Army will look like...
It doesn’t. Some states always vote a certain way. That’s why presidential candidates spend their time and campaign money in swing states. That’s also why you don’t see Biden ads in Alaska.
I just want normalcy again (well as much as politics had ever been). Biden is, at the very least, an actual politician so that's a come up from what we got now.
Kamala had to drop out the race because she couldn’t get the black vote what made Biden think that picking her would magically change that.
That’s nuts.  I haven’t been this happy about a VP choice since Obama chose Biden.  Honestly, I’m sure I’m MORE happy with this.  She’s incredible, and just what we need.  I can’t wait to support her for President eventually.  She’s a force of nature, exactly what we need!
No sarcasm here, btw. I support making Joe Biden into "Someone Else" as much as possible.
And also why you don’t see Biden campaign ads in Alaska. It would be a waste of campaign money.
I’ll admitit, I shed a tear or thirty when  announced  as his running mate. I haven’t been this encouraged by a political ticket in many years. I’ve been Team Kamala for Vice President since it became clear Biden would be nominated. It’s a great day! 💙🇺🇸💙
Killary......🤔 Girl stop..... We know you're going to remove Hiden Biden. So you can fulfill your dream of being a 3X  Loser again.  She knew  she would lose  and she did it anyway. #SaveTheChildren
I’m glad I live in a Republican state because I’m for sure not voting for a Biden-Harris ticket
Gee Kamala, what changed your mind?  Hypocrite!
Does this mean Jill Biden is relieved of her duties as spokesperson for the person who can’t speak for himself?
Killary/Killmala 2020 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣  Going to move Hiden Biden out the way. Memes gonna eat those Dems alive. Can't wait to see them.
DARK TO LIGHT NOTHING Can Stop What's Coming Clinton takes Hiden Biden place.  Welcome the Killary/Killmala Ticket
you bastards think I don’t see ur game here...take away eyes from the whole biden/kamala situation by doing a lil photograph follow-up, huh? COINCIDENCE?!?! foh I’m awake
Right!?  Who damaged the little girl who had to get bossed to school and it was all Biden’s fault. She’s a bigger liar than Biden.
I’m not surprised that Biden, the man who drafted the 1994 Crime Bill, picked this bitch as his running mate smh...
Joe Biden named Sen. Kamala Harris as his running mate, making history by selecting the first Black woman to compete on a major party’s presidential ticket and acknowledging the vital role Black voters will play in his bid to defeat President Donald Trump.
Biden is a man of his word ~ Unlike our current 'president'.
Trump says: If Biden wins, we’ll have to learn to speak Chinese.  I say: It’ll be worth it.
President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris!!  Finally!!  Our long national nightmare is about to be OVER!!  #KamalaHarris  #Biden2020Landslide  #JoeBiden2020  #KamalaHarrisForVP
during an unprecedented backlash against mass incarceration and police brutality, the Dems are running a Biden/Harris ticket. they know we know they don't care about winning, so they're just embracing it now. it's beyond parody.
Fucc Biden
Joe Biden selects Kamala Harris as his running mate  via  Yahoo!
Joe Biden selects California Sen. Kamala Harris as running mate
You indicated Biden was intentionally racist (which he is) and supported racist and divisive policies (which he does. And so does the Democrat party).
Joe Biden and Kamala Harris need to appear on The Breakfast Club right meow!
This only shows Joe Biden is not scared of a smart aggressive woman. Kamala will Rip Mike Pence Apart. Mark my words.
Just a reminder that Biden’s VP pick, Kamala Harris, previously said that she believes Biden’s accusers. #BidenHarris2020 #Trump2020LandslideVictory 🇺🇸
Cue the video of Kamala attacking &amp; destroying Biden in the primary debates. Gonna see that a lot in the next few months🙄
Listening in to an "Alaska Women for Biden" town hall when they announced Kamala Harris as the VP seems like a very appropriate place to have been. And folks were thrilled!
It's official. Biden selects California Sen. Kamala Harris as running mate.
I am A MESS. As soon as I heard the news that KAMALA HARRIS is officially Biden’s VP, I called my partner and we literally just screamed at each other like little girls and then hung up. Not even exaggerating.  I am so happy I get to vote for her.  #BidenHarris2020 LETS GOOOO
Lol, Biden trying to win back some of those black votes.
Joe Biden has decided on his running mate: Sen. Kamala Harris.
Who will Biden pick as his running mate? A poll posted too late. . .
JUST IN: Joe Biden has picked Kamala Harris as his running mate. She'll be the first African American nominated for VP by a major party.
Joe Biden has selected Kamala Harris as his running mate
Kamila Harris named as Biden’s running mate
Kamala Harris is Biden's pick! 💙🎉
Joe Biden chooses Kamala Harris as his running mate  LETS GOOOOOO!   #BuildBackBetter
Yes, good practice for when Joe Biden is on the lawn, thinking he's showing up for work
Awesome! So you are definitely voting for Biden?
This is the most annoying VP rollout ever, and I’m actually fired up about the contenders. Why is he dragging this out? Suspense doesn’t work this way, now I’m just mad lol. At this point Biden’s VP could be a tap dancing ham sandwich and I’d be like “y’all hear somethin”
The suspense is only killing the media and team trump. The rest of us know better days are ahead regardless Biden’s pick.
Susan Rice, aka how to make Trump-skeptical GOPers and people interested in sound foreign policy (not necessarily the same demographic) much, much less willing to support the Biden campaign...
Sarah Palin was a popular Governor.  She's more qualified than any of the Dem VP frontrunners  Hell, she was more qualified than Biden in 2008, who didn't understand the role the VP plays in the Legislative branch *as a sitting senator*
Thankfully, disgruntled Bernie fans such as yourself WILL be FAR out-numbered at the polls.  Joe Biden WILL be our next awesome President of the United States of America! 🤗🤗  Go Joe!!  #Biden2020  #JoeBiden #Biden2020 #JoeBiden2020 #Biden2020ToSaveAmerica
As someone who was raped and lost their home because of Scientology, I will hunger strike outside  home if Karen is Biden's VP pick until he picks someone else.  Scientology is a cult and a scam- it is NOT a "harmless" religion. 😡  Don't be apathetic and complicit!💔
NO.  Karen Bass is disqualified to be Joe Biden's VP nominee because she praised and promoted the propaganda that  is a religion, when Scientology is in fact a cult guilty of rape, blackmail and murder.   Karen Bass should resign!   #DefundScientology #KarenBassRESIGN
My general view of this is that Biden has like a rock-solid base, locked in by Trump's awfulness. We're not going to see the race tighten beyond a certain point.
I suspect that this is about as tight as the race will get, and Biden has some running room as Trump continues to bungle things.
did anyone look at Michelle Obama's wiki page? I tried but I don't know how to look up edits, it was edited yesterday. I know she's just listed as a speaker at the DNC but the first thing that popped in my head was  "Biden/Obama 2020"
Totally gonna vote Biden even though he is NOT my man at all! AND you are not alone. Many have been down this trail and survived for decades💕💕you can do it!
"As President, I will do what President Trump has failed to do: listen to the scientists and experts to protect Bristol Bay — and all it offers to Alaska, our country, and the world."
On the left is Greater St James &amp; Little St James. They both belong to Jeffery Epstien. Little St James was pedophile island. On the right is Water Island, Joe Biden &amp; Biden family own it. If you don't believe me research it yourself. I do  mean this as a political point.

Weird, I see him on a bike and campaigning at events while the GOP photoshops his images, lying to Americans that he’s in his basement. #GOPLiesToAmerica

It’s finally happened. I had a dream last night that Harris was announced as Biden’s VP
Sorry ass having the lack of any supplies is all on Obama and Biden they sold our factories to China and Obama didn’t have any stock piles the only thing he stockpiled was the Koran he stockpiled us the American citizens in the war in the Middle East to break our military down
Oh, you think me posting this is my way of advocating for Biden? Hilarious.
Nobody actually thinks Biden is socialist, nor has his centerist politics in the last 40 years suggested as much. In fact, Biden is more conservative than Trump.  Biden has spent a career opposing Russia while Trump licks Putin’s boots and Putin pays bounties on our troops.
Open my recent searches and who do I find? Joe Biden. I have never searched for Biden, and all my previous searches are gone. You suck
No.  Biden only wrote the bill that has lead hundreds of thousands to be incarcerated.  That's all.
President Donald Trump has never said that..... but you Joe Biden have said it... but you probably don’t remember!!
Add it to the Presidential debate. I’d love to hear Trump and Biden’s platform on the female orgasm.😂
Biden is going to ask us for 6 weeks of lockdown in exchange for the $ help we need and to be as united as we can be for the duration to save lives.
I’m generally an optimist, but unless Biden wins and a whole lot of these crooks do serious jail time, 2021 will make 2020 seem good.
tRUMP doesn't represent All Americans. His Administration openly admits that $$ will flow to 'Red' states and neglect 'Blue' States.  Joe Biden won't divide America by Red and Blue.
When Biden chooses Whitmer you will look stupid for making fun of him
Yes! Joe Biden and his Vice Presidential candidate are ready to Lead Americans in a National Pandemic Response Plan and a way OUT of this COVID crisis created by  and
I cannot shake the impression that Pelosi, Biden, and Nadler are just actors in some demonic theatre.  Blackmail? Extreme cognitive dissonance? Anti-peace nihilism?
As noted previously, there won’t be a national testing strategy before Jan. 21st, and THEN only if we elect Joe Biden. So,  I’d rather see you tweeting about electing Biden than wasting time tweeting about Trump’s FAILURES. Get out the VOTE!
Quick send Joe Biden to defend the USPS!
What?  Beijing Biden is changing the narrative...again? Or did you simply forget the script?  Obviously, these words are in response to OUR Presidents comments this afternoon.
NO.   Fck Karen Bass for praising and defending the cult of Scientology. If Joe Biden picks Karen Bass, I WILL go on a hunger strike outside his home in Delaware until he picks someone else!
such a deep bench of talent, the best you could come up with was Biden
We have an #IdiotInChief  Yet  jabs at Biden's verbal gaffs!
Dues Biden even know how to tell the truth? He lies like it's second nature!
And people talk about Biden. 🤣🤣🤣
I can promise you that Biden knows when the NINETEEN EIGHTEEN Spanish Flu happened and when one of the two biggest wars happened/ended.   This guy was it for some of you? THIS guy? Seriously. This is getting ridiculous.
"Now, Alaskan culture, traditions, and jobs are on the line. As President, I will do what President Trump has failed to do: listen to the scientists and experts to protect Bristol Bay — and all it offers to Alaska, our country, and the world."
Robin Williams on Joe Biden...
Stop with the Joe Biden has to pick a woman of color. Some of y’all didn’t vote for the white email lady. Hush!
"Bristol Bay has been foundational to the way of life of Alaska Natives for countless generations, provides incredible joy for recreational anglers from across the country, and is an economic powerhouse [...] It is no place for a mine."
I will vote for Biden and nothing will change my mind ❤️
New Standards for Tailings Storage; Biden vows to sidestep law on permitting.
Biden is so full of it. They don’t care about Alaska. They are just talking to get Alaskans to vote for him.
There is nothing prominent about any of these “men”. Since when do “prominent” men determine the outcome or decide an election? They are power broking manipulators and are not America First. No matter who Biden picks, he will be trounced by #Trump2020 #WWG1WGAWORLDWIDE
Joe Hiden Biden would close Alaska to any and all resource development except for Seattle fishing businesses. Alaska's economy would be decimated. #alaska #ResourceBasedEconomy
Joe Biden would shut Alaska down. You think the Chinese Flu is bad. TAPS would be shut down, no mining, no coal, nothing but Seattle fishing. Joe Biden would #flattenalaska
Iowa rocks! Where's Hiden Biden?
Biden won't spend this much time Primping... Let alone have a Professional do MAKEUP! 🤣😂 It's past time for Americans to have a Real President, not a poor Actor.
Exactly!  Yet many have voted already for Biden, without knowing who they are voting for as his running mate....pure lunacy!  We must ensure that President Trump wins 4 more years!
Spot On, Cheri!  Biden has gained his wealth after being in office.  Amen, the dems are morally, and intellectually bankrupt!
My vote is for Biden! I trust him to pick the person he will work the best with. Those not chosen will be used to fill some very critical positions in his administration. ❤️
So you’re voting for Biden then. Awesome!
DT is NOT republican, or aligned with any party other than himself. Trumpies are willing to avoid Biden and cling to this psycho in the name of what?? I still don’t get it. Their other option is Kayne 😂🤭
Why do people keep saying Susan Rice? I'm sorry but that would be the most boring ticket since Gore/Lieberman. Biden isn't a dynamic candidate. He needs to pick someone to get people excited about.  That would be Harris or Warren.
Vote for Biden!🙏🙏🙏
Biden does have alzheimer’s and you need to watch a different channel trump has done more for the Americans then any other president your just used to being lied to to get your vote then they do nothing that they said  a vote for Biden is death to us
There’s people out there that are really going to vote for Joe Biden😂
Jill Biden could run for VP as a woman of color, I'm sure she's dyes her hair regularly enough.
And suddenly media is real concerned about how progressive Biden.
Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden said on Sunday that if he’s elected, his administration would stop a proposed copper and gold mine in Alaska’s Bristol Bay region.
A vote for Biden means there won't be freedom for any future generations. Vote TRUMP 2020!!! 🇺🇸🇺🇲🇺🇸
Been saying this since last year. I love me some Kamala. I’m fine either way. ⁦  “The vice presidency is not the job she should go for — asking to be considered as attorney general in a Biden administration would be more like it.”
China Biden collusion
Biden could reasonably win by 10 points even
It’s 68% minority. It’s voting for Biden
i'm a bit underwhelm with Biden yet i would rather have him than 4 more years of gop
Notice how SOME from the news media are trying to get SOME democrats to reveal Biden's VP choice...before he's ready to announce? Stop...just stop.
79% Americans said that they would vote for President Trump instead of Biden and this still is not the silent majority
Shut everything down, give everyone Basic Income monthly checks, ramp up testing, keep schools closed, etc. UNTIL a vaccine is developed and enough PPE is provided to everyone who needs them to stay safe on the front lines of this out of control pandemic.  In the words of Biden-
At this point, it’s pretty easy I figure. I can’t stomach Biden. He’s a Reagan republican light, but I’d crawl over broken glass to fight anyone who tried to keep me from voting for him right now.
I'm meta-predicting that if 538 comes out with a model in the next week, it puts Biden's "nowcast" odds at 95%, and election-day odds around 75%.
Biden approval? ROTFLMFAO He will be dead before it’s ever approved.
That’s Right that’s about all Joe Biden knows how to do is ride a bike because he can’t think he can’t speak I’m pretty sure he doesn’t even know where he’s at even riding his bike that’s why he’s got a follow so many people while doing it
Donald Trump is got leather soled shoes on on a steel incline and Biden his mind is gone for good vote read vote trump he’s our Countries only hope
She’s panicking because less than 3 months until the election, Trump did the unexpected with his new EOs yesterday that made him look like a leader once again, and Biden’s numbers are slipping fast. Trump has the upper hand now and Pelosi knows it. 😁
You’re the Sucker if you’re voting for Joe Biden....
Joe Biden says he’ll work to stop Pebble Mine if he wins presidency
Too late- we need to impeach and remove Trump immediately. Joe Biden can easily defeat Mike Pence in November. Trump needs to GO NOW.
I’m riding with Biden no matter what they come up with because it’s a lie.
Biden’s appointees will at least be competent, unlike trump’s “best people”.
i thought there were FOUR Horsemen of the Apocalypse? oh yeah, Biden is number 4!

U.S. Intelligence Says Republicans Are Working With Russia to Reelect Trump
What's the Catholic Church say about abortion compared to Joe Biden?  Seems to be in conflict for a devout Catholic.... just saying... 🤔
President Trump.  Please tell the people clearly that the goal of Mail in voting it to have issues (any issues work) that cause counts to be indeterminable.  That’s why no one cares about Biden, or even you winning.  The plan is Pelosi given vote count impossible.
Of course not.  The goal of mail in voting is to have issues that cause the count to be “indeterminable”.  That’s why no one cares about Biden, not hearing much about the election.  If a count cannot be resolved, Pelosi becomes President.  ANY counting problem works.
Shut up Racist!  Whoever supports Biden is a loathsome Racist!
there’s something to be said about nobody really knowing what a Joe Biden sounds like pre 2020 and now everyone knows EXACTLY what his old dying brain sounds like and he might be PRESIDENT. dumb country
The Russian government is actively seeking to undermine Joe Biden's campaign in order to help Donald Trump win reelection. Sound familiar?
That will be a fun thing for Biden to deal with in his first couple of months in office
that's all ya got joe? "Hidin' Joe, Biden', aka 'bunker Biden'...only have attack dog politics, weaponizing the deaths of thousands, using covid19 2 justify hiding. u know your brain cant handle a debate. u r sick, joe. go home to your family, joe.
Hope everyone is prepared for an “indeterminable” outcome of the election.  Neither Biden or Trump will be President because of irregularities that will not be able to be resolved.  This is why there’s no need for Biden to face voters.  Prepare for Pelosi as President.
Wonder if he is waiting for Obamagate indictments, cat and mouse between Trump and “Biden”.
Just look a Biden’s history. His actions speak volumes about his policies..  His support of the crime bill resulted in the incarceration of a lot of people of color.  His support of the patriot act lead to the militarization of our police. But hey🤷‍♂️
To be honest, most people considering voting for her weren’t voting for Biden anyway.
The fact that Biden is a cyclist (like me!) makes me like him so much more
So you don’t like what you have been doing to trump but are mad because your loser Biden got all that he had coming poor baby’s lie in your bed and you have to lay in your bed
One is pancreatic cancer, the other is brain cancer.. Both ore terrible..  Look at Biden’s record.  His history cannot be ignored.
China wants me to vote for Biden.  Russia wants me to vote for Trump. I want $20million. DM me. Serious bidders only.
Basically if Biden wins it’s simply because more people disliked Trump. We’re also voting for whoever Biden’s running mate is because there is no way he’s getting through a 4 year term with his mental state the way it is.
Y’all think they support Biden?
trump actually takes them serious as a threat. biden is too dead to be a threat to them
Joe Biden is gonna totally #JoeBiden this #VicePresident pick.
Agree.  The plan is for neither Trump or Biden to be President.  Mail in voting is key and Pelosi will be President to an unresolvable count.  They don’t care what the issues are, just as long as there are lots of them.
Russia Working to Damage Biden's White House Bid, Spy Agencies Say

Thank you President Joe Biden for NOT referring to that traitor as "President"- Putin's sockpuppet doesn't deserve that title. Donald Trump should be called BunkerBoy, if anything.  Joe Biden is our President now.🗽🌊
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Friday rejected congressional subpoenas issued for him and for the State Department to provide information and testimony to lawmakers about two politically charged developments.
Wow! Joy Reid heard it come out of Joe Biden's mouth 13 times.
pennsylvania biden president. cant you read
Hillary Clinton, because Biden does the wrong thing by nature. Its his default.
Nichols is just another DS liberal covering for Joe Biden as usual! He’s a joke! Another progressive POS!
Thank you!  Who in their right mind would vote for Beijing Biden and Marxism.....just saying....
Soooo....does that mean Joe Biden is a demigod? Like in the movie "Clash of the Titans "
They keep having to remind Biden that he’s not running for the Senate Seat in South Carolina. 🤣  Once he figures that out, they will inform him what VP they have selected for him.
‘I didn’t mean to say that all Black People are the same.  It just naturally came out that way.’-Joe Biden
To make matters even more confusing, there are Scientologists pretending to be old fashioned Democrats and make a big show of publically supporting Joe Biden- but they're really trying to lure naive victims into their trap to gain trust- to get blackmail they can use against you.

god  biden when he got hurted
How would you explain a non-racist being pro-segregation, like Biden was?
All of that is under the Blood. You obviously know nothing of the Lord Jesus who forgives all of our iniquity and cleans the slate when we receive Him. His sins are under the Blood! Are yours? He has plenty of fruit to show for his repentance. Biden meanwhile still lives the lie!
Is this the future you want? Then vote for Hiden Biden. Just despicable. #flattenantifa #alaska #riots2020
Yeah that’s pretty bad but he -said- that, Biden -did- sniff and touch those kids....
Oh I agree fully. I intend on voting for biden but ugh I hope he picks someone for AG that has intent to go after him and not let him off the hook.
What's Biden going to do to hurt God? Nuke heaven?
My question is the same one I have for all those who say Biden is a Christian? How do you know? Where is the fruit of that?
Biden’s dumb ass remarks about prosecuting trump is exactly why Bernie should have the nomination but I do like that he said that he wouldn’t interfere if they do. The issue is we have a repeat of Nixon and his dirty tricks. They’ll make excuses to let trump off as good for
Biden on the path of Marxism TRUMP on the path of Liberty! # #WWG1WGA
I know 2 people personally. My own father was against Trump until I showed him the media's lies. He's aTrump voter now! Everyone else I know is voting Trump. Even those voting Biden are just anti-Trump not pro-Biden.
We create our own reality. The impeached president Donald J Trump created the reality in which is in right now. And unfortunately he created the reality for 210,000 Americans dead due to what he didn’t do in his reality. That’s why I am voting for Joe Biden’s reality.
It’s not Biden’s fault Trump is dying...
Here you are about dead and still talking shit about Biden.  Satan is going to love having you in his presence when you do croak.
Biden can run circles around your feeble dad.
Here's my "I hope it's just Tin Foil Hat &amp; Not Real" Theory...China released The Virus  Covid-19 to destabilize world governments, especially Western Governments, particularly Trump. Biden is Pro-China, would re-open all kinds of Trade, drop Tariffs
On one hand, Trump might have spread COVID to the Dems' nominee for President. On the other hand, Biden might have caught it. Both sides have a lot to answer for.
Rhetorical question: if tables were turned and Biden was in hospital with COVID instead, what would Trump Tweet?
I think y’all meant Vote for our PRESIDENT TRUMP and leave the constant lies and hateful hypocrisy propaganda of no soul, no go hiding Joey Biden in the hands of the American People and the Justice system with the rest of the traitors who’s been committing voting fraud for years.
I think they get mad about Trump, but then they get depressed about Biden.  In 2016 Hillary made me mad, but Trump made me depressed, and I almost didn't vote.
Joe Biden is my President.  #GoJoe 🇺🇸
Why did you not warn Biden that you had the virus?
Your administration is like and to the boy who cried Wolf. You’ve lied to the American people so many times that even if you were telling the truth now you have zero credibility. More lies more fake news from the fake president. That’s why I’m voting for Joe Biden.
By my count, my very white, middle-upper-middle class Anchorage neighborhood has 3 Biden signs, two Al Gross signs, 2 BLM signs, a pride flag, and no Trump signs. It’s a pleasant surprise.  Oh and a Jorgensen sign on the outskirts for good measure.
After reading Michael Cohen’s book, I wouldn’t put it past Trump to try to kill him. He probably though that he could easily survive the virus but that Biden would not.
Trump would do anything in his power to step on Biden’s neck if he was sick! The same way he he did Hillary. No empathy from Trump!!!
Donald Trump should resign for purposely trying to infect Joe Biden with the novel coronavirus in the hope Biden would become sick with COVID-19. If he refuses to resign, the Senate should have another vote and remove from office. This is attempted murder.  #TrumpTriedToInfectJoe
Here is a theory. What if Trump purposely exposed Biden to kill him . Trump with his stupid ego figured that he would survive it. ?
Would you expect anything less from the administration that has supported the 27+ thousand lies that have been told to the American people? Scandal and cover-up is their MO. That’s why am voting for Joe Biden.
Yeah because they knew Biden would simp for him and his recovery anyway
This is something Trump would do.  But Mother Gaia and the Universe protected Joe Biden.  So fuck Trump-  Joe Biden is blessed.🙏🌎
The fact that Biden pulled his negative ads and team Trump is in the attack shows you who has class and grace.  And who doesn’t
But were they “repelled” sufficiently to vote for VP Biden?
Thank you for the update. The simple fact that he caught the virus due to his selfish self-centered actions is the reason why he’s going to lose this election. Joe Biden is theMan with honor in character and has the ability to unite the Americans.
He yelled at Biden because he's an asshole.
What about Rudy Giuliani? What about Bill bar? They might think they’re above the law but they’re not unable to catch the virus. Karma is alive and well in the White House. The downplaying of this virus by the whole administration is why I was voting for Joe Biden.
Any word from Bill bar? The blatant disregard for the virus and how this administration has handled it is the very reason why I’m voting for Joe Biden. The Trump administration has been a clown show from day one. The GOP is full of hypocrites and can no longer be trusted.
I’m not Voting for Biden or Trump, but listen to this insane Anti-Gay Trump Voter.
My husband is a Republican USAF vet who is for Biden. He didn’t vote for trump last time either. He’s not on twitter
Joe Biden gives his deepest sympathy and condolences to the president and the first lady and family. What would Donald Trump do if the shoe was on the other foot. He made fun of Hillary Clinton for catching pneumonia he made fun of John McCain on his deathbed.
I do not wish this virus on anybody. However Karma has a way of writing the wrongs. I do want him to recover because I want him to be defeated by Joe Biden. And then I can’t wait to see the Trump trials. I will put money on his books so he can get some candy bars.
No, then want Biden elected so *they* can run the country because they think Biden is too weak.
Selfish actions and self-centered choices have consequences. The impeached president Cot the virus because of his blatant disregard.   The Biden campaign needs to move ahead strongly and forcefully because America needs them now more so than ever.

Things are the way they are because the impeached president Donald J Trump acted the way he did. What would Donald Trump do if the shoe was on the other foot? We will have an election and I will be voting for Joe Biden.
This is my personal thoughts. I do not wish anyone harm or death from this coronavirus. Donald J Trump is a victim of his own choices and actions. I do wish him and the first lady all the best. But I’m still voting for Joe Biden! Karma is alive and well.
Have you noticed the news media stop talking about trumps taxes or tax fraud implications. They stop talking about his ultimate failure at the debate. Still not sure what to think. But I’m still voting for Joe Biden!
How many American lives could’ve been saved if he would’ve caught the virus in March? No one deserves to die from this virus. So wake up and show up and vote were possible. Make a plan wear a mask. I’m voting for Joe Biden.
Exactly! This president shows no respect to anyone so concedeljng to him only fuels him! Wtf is the Biden camp thinking? Stop thinking this is a regular presidency. It’s not. This cookoo land.
Donald Trump Jr. Melts Down and Blames Hunter Biden For His Dad’s Potential Tax Fraud  via
I agree! It is what it is because things are the way they are. We have a narcissistic social path in the hospital that cares only about himself with over 200,000 Americans dead due to his lack of response. I’m not going to rally behind him now. That’s why am voting for Joe Biden.
some the best news i heard yet   Joe and Jill Biden test negative for COVID-19
Kudos to Biden for choosing to do what is smart regardless of how it looks to the peanut gallery...
??? A lot of democrats are extremely conservative, like joe fucking Biden for one.
Christie is just delusional if he thinks there’s  any way at all Trump comes off as “consistently coherent” for 5 minutes, much less 90.  And how the hell is ANYONE on Trumps team ballsy enough to chide Biden for name calling?  Good grief.  That’s MADNESS!
Maybe Biden will be different.... lmfao🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
A couple of things to remember before I go to bed.  1) Wishes and Prayers don’t do a goddamn thing. 2) If Trump lives or dies, whatever you wish won’t make a difference. 3) Pence, Pelosi, and Biden are not your friends 4) Voting will not get any of Our Policy goals enacted.
We need ad showing how weak and sick Trump is. We need ads that show we need a compassionate  leader in Biden
Biden is inherently decent. Huge difference from the administration.
Can't believe Biden is going to cheat AGAIN in the next debate, this time by "not being hooked up to a ventilator"
Upon being elected a 2nd term, Trump would see it as full mandate to continue his sectarianism . I think it will inform a far more authoritarian and dangerous presidency and put the nail into our democracy’s coffin. Biden is the only option we have to reject a backslide.
Biden is an Idiot and will continue being one for the rest of his short life.
Biden, Obama and HRC invented and promoted a Russia collusion conspiracy to sabotage Trump's campaign and undermine his Presidency.  I'm surprised he's not wiping his butt with their "best wishes" and returning them
Unfortunately positive results can be quite delayed. I've seen case studies in the literature up to 13 days from exposure to positive results. These are very rare, but Biden probably needs to quarantine for at least two weeks. Trump knew he was exposed and went to events wed.
Great...so will follow Biden's lead &amp; pull all negative campaign ads?   Asking for a friend....#BidenHarrisToSaveAmerica
Why should Biden suspend his campaign? Trump was reckless with his own life as well as every American's lives. Who told him to refuse to wear a mask or assemble large gathering?? He has nobody to blame but himself!!
Americans are exhausted. Many of us have no idea where we will be living in 30 days, or tomorrow for that matter, or how to keep our families together.  We have to get out of this nightmare. Biden offers hope.
Biden isn’t sick with Covid....
Biden isn’t sick. And he’s not POTUS.... until January🤷‍♀️
Joe Biden is not sick with Covid and he’s not POTUS ... yet.
Biden is not in the hospital.
Biden has class
Mr Vice president Biden, think🤔... would our current president and Senate discontinue negative adds or attacks on you or your family with covid-19 ?  NO, so p'lante...God bless them, pero f them.
I flipped to the the Conservative station in the car. They say “Biden had no answer on law and order or his son”🙄
Time for Biden to rev it up!!
Damn Joe Biden tested negative. Was really hoping it would take both of them
LIAR FROM THE PIT OF HELL, BIDEN 😈
But biden should suspend his campaign. Got it
I know that Biden doesn’t want to come off mean, but dammit take the gloves off and do what needs to be done. Being tough doesn’t mean you wish him dead, just not President
Biden should demand that FOX News suspend their operations forever - in return.
Paraphrasing Joe Biden’s debate remark, would you please just shut up, Sean?
Biden is running his campaign with a genuine care and concern for the American people. Trump ran his campaign caring about only himself and not the American people. And now he is a statistic.
My thoughts and prayers go out to the families of the over 200,000 Americans that have died due to the lack of response from this fake president. I hope he does recover so he can see how future President Biden runs our country.
That’s the character, and dignity I’d like to see in a president. I look forward to having Joe Biden as our future president. That’s why I am voting for Biden Harris! #BidenHarris.
Well then let the Biden campaign post the truth and the facts and let that speak for itself. That should be good enough!
They would treat biden as awfully and denigratingly as Hillary when she had pneumonia
That’s the character in class of the Biden campaign. Well I don’t have that character in class. Let them shove a lightbulb up trumps ass and make sure he gets plenty of fluids bleach Windex etc. It is what it is!
Thank you future President Biden for doing what’s best for the American people trying to unite us and bring us together. That’s why am voting for Joe Biden for president next month. You’re what America needs as a leader.
Fact-checking the first Trump-Biden presidential debate
Yup, Biden the sniffer, he’s one too
Thank you President Obama. For your strength and leader ship in these trying times. Always acting presidential and always thinking about others. Your leader ship is needed now and I will be voting for Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. Thank you!
Biden shouldn’t have to suspend his campaign because Trump doesn’t give a crap about others not to mention stupid!!
Up yours Fox News!! It’s Trumps own fault he couldn’t follow CDC guidelines. He wouldn’t wear a mask or do social distancing!! Let’s not forget his rallies. To bad for Trump, Biden followed the rules and kept himself safe along with others!
Thank you future vice president Kamala Harris for acting with honor and dignity and uniting the country. We need your leader ship now more so than ever. I will be voting for Joe Biden and Kamala Harris!
Thank you future President Biden. For doing the right thing and uniting Americans. Always acting presidential having character honor and morals. That’s why I will be voting for you!
RESPECT, that's what's been missing the last 4 years.  This is a wise move by Biden, but surely not going to be reciprocated.
This is not true! I saw where Biden wished him well!
In a scenario in which Pence is suddenly at the top of the ticket, Biden loses hands down. Absolves all those "reasonable Republicans" of the concerns they say they currently have.
biden is such a stupid bitch baby now is the time to go for the throat
Biden has pulled all negative ads about Trump. I doubt Trump would do the same, but I think I heard they ran out of money anyway
I'm sorry, future President Biden,  but I just can't stand that POS.
Leave it to the vice president Joe Biden to take the highroad. Always acting presidential and doing what’s best for Americans. That’s why I’m voting for Joe Biden!
Ummm I don’t need to make up comments, it’s all there Lmfaoo. Also, I don’t think Biden not Trump should be president and also that’s a bad argument because he was quoting 🤦🏽‍♀️🤦🏽‍♀️. Trump has a history of Racism and lets not forget potentially a Rapist.
Biden doesn't look so stupid for wearing a mask now.
Live updates: Trump expected to head to Walter Reed hospital after positive test- Ugghhh. Why can’t we learn n listen to the medical experts ....
“Fox News demands  to suspend his campaign for 14 days”  Uhh. No. 🙄 Reckless negligence that leads to illness is not Biden’s problem when he has taken every precaution. The thousands of people committed to &amp; invested in his campaign shouldn’t be forced to hit pause.
no the 27th amendment says "if trump and biden die bernie sanders becomes president automatically" what kind of google do you use?
Sounds like  is helping write Biden's speeches now. It's effective &amp; no doubt matches Biden's genuine sentiments.  But what will a Biden Admin bring?

Omg the debate commission and Cleveland Clinic tested Biden but not Trump? Wtf?
Joe Biden Wil be there at the end of this.
Ohohoho the IRONY😂😂 Trump was just making fun of Biden for wearing a mask😂😂😂 the jokes write themselves at this point
It’s painfully obvious that the Trump administration does not care about the American people and fail their oath of office miserably. That’s why I’m voting for Joe Biden! #BidenHarrisBuildBackBetter!
What a bigly week.  Vote for #Biden.
For me it's not so much about her. I voted for Johnson in 2016 because I didn't see any reason to vote for or against either main candidate. Both seemed equally bad. Now tho, I'm voting for the guy Commies hate, because Biden will cave to the Marxists.
This is probably the only Corn Pop Biden remembers ... defeating ...
Trump literally killed a dude with his rallies and didn't bat an eye, why should Biden slow down for a second?
Maybe Biden should try running a more positive campaign, like Trump is
A new group of evangelical leaders forms in support of Biden - Yup
Biden’s supporters...
We are nurses, America's most trusted profession. And we support Biden | Opinion
Joe Biden tests negative for the Coronavirus.
Biden doesn’t suspend anything. Period.
Hallelujah! God bless Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, the President and Vice President of the United States of America! 🇺🇸 #BidenCalm #BidenHarris
Joe Biden is still a lousy candidate. The Ds succumbed to Bernie Sanders and the AOC crowd. Biden is too weak to even campaign--he puts a LID on his campaign at 9:30am.
Joe Biden has tested negative for the coronavirus, his primary care doctor confirmed on Friday
Biden tested negative today. Try to keep up.
Thank you Mother Gaia and Universe for protecting Joe Biden! Our prayers have been answered!
Biden was on the debate stage with Trump for more than 90 minutes earlier in the week.
Confirmed! Negative tests for Joe and Jill Biden.
Dear future President Biden thank you for your service and hard work. Thank you for your honesty your transparency and wise words in keeping America safe. Thankful that the family is safe. We need your leader ship now more than ever.
Dear future president Joe Biden, I am a 57-year-old blind man working part time at the Alaska Center For The Blind. I humbly ask to work with your administration in the disability department helping others and build back better.
How can former VP Biden scale back his campaign any further? Hide even deeper in his basement? Put a LID on his campaign by 8am?
Yeah I don’t even agree with that. The election continues. Campaign should continue. Not Biden’s fault Trump acted with reckless abandon.
84% of Canadians support Joe Biden. Good. If DJT is re elected, 84% of Americans will want to become Canadian.
Trump mocks Biden during first presidential debate 'I don’t wear a mask like him'
Joe Biden releases statement on Trump diagnosis
Just waiting and hoping to hear from the Biden Camp. I hope that we get a 2 for 1 special. And if Pelosi gets it too, I will renounce my Atheism!!! 😇😇
What about Joe Biden? 🙏🇺🇸
Exactly...Biden is the American Imperialist War Candidate. It’s in plain site that this man will be responsible for murdering Millions of People.
Thoughts and prayers to the 200,000+ that have died from this virus. All the best to the Trump administration wishing them well! I’m still voting for Joe Biden I believe he’s the best one to lead us out of this pandemic in any future crisis that might arise.
It’s sad that trumpers repeat trump’s (or Russia’s) false accusations about Biden’s mental capacity when their boy has trouble completing sentences, no less paragraphs. Have brainwashing techniques improved or their intelligence declined?
Shut up! Trump KNOWS that Covid is highly contagious, yet he repeatedly encouraged people NOT to wear masks! He spread lies saying masks were dangerous! He made fun of Biden for wearing a mask! I’m LMAO all the way to the voting polls 😂🖕🏼😆
What do you think would be Trumps tweet storm if the tables were turned? Do you think he would wish Biden well? Or would he do the same as 2016 and mock him like he did Hillary?
That is why I’m voting for Joe Biden. He always takes the highroad and displays himself as presidential. One acts like a president and the other acts like a predator. You’ve got my vote vice President Biden
Trump was making fun of Biden during the debates for always wearing a mask yet he’s not the one who just tested positive 🤔
More than 175 current and former law enforcement members endorsed Joe Biden after Trump claimed he had no support.
This must happen: in Alaska Biden a d Trump.inndead heat and new poll suggests Joe Biden has a shot at blowing out President Trump in the Electoral College. Sen. Sullivan, an R, is also in trouble. #Alaska  #Trump #Election2020
Wow that describes Donald J Trump exactly. Right on the head. No misunderstanding no miss interpretations but that describes the impeached failure Donald J Trump to a T. It confirms we have a narcissistic sociopath as a president. That’s why am voting for Joe Biden.
Wait, if Trump has covid and just had his debate, could Biden have it as well?
Let’s all wail about how biden should suspend his campaign
Finally some nice words to actually read. I may not support Joe Biden and I may not support Donald Trump but I don’t wish this virus on anybody. I hope his family has a speedy recovery.
I will rest easy after biden is inaugurated and not a moment sooner
I'm worried about Biden. I know he was 6+ feet away, but Trump was probably spewing a lot of saliva.
I️ can’t be the only one thinking about the CDC telling us about aerosol transmission of COVID-19, and the way they were yelling and virtually spitting at one another, if Trump gave Biden COVID. #BidenHarris2020  Biden was seen coughing a lot last night  rally.
sorry its the 28th amendment: bernie gets to be president if joe biden and trump die
No one in the world is as qualified to comment on the "debates" as the one and only weird al.   Watch "WE'RE ALL DOOMED - Trump vs. Biden ft. "Weird Al" Yankovic" on YouTube
My thoughts were that if he says he has it, he'll have an excuse not to debate Biden again, play the sympathy card, and say he lost the election because he was too sick to campaign. He'll want a do over!!
However, I worry about Biden being in the same room with Trump! Karma is a beautiful thing however! This what Trump gets for making fun of Biden for always wearing a mask!!
I think it will be very interesting what the market does based on the POTUS news of COVID.   Futures down, market drops?? One thing, it will give some insight to what will happen to the economy if Biden is elected.
Oh shit does that mean Biden will get corona next... do we get a clean slate at the election ??
The way Trump looked during the debate with Joe Biden was reminiscent of Richard Nixon's appearance during his debate with John F. Kennedy- sick, sweaty, and shifty. Nixon had a cold that he wasn't quite over- did Trump just get COVID-19? Or has he had it for who knows how long?
Not praying for any recovery here. I just hope it spreads to Biden, Pelosi, Schumer, and Mitch McConnell!! 🥰🥰🥰
you know what’s actually hilarious? When I was watching the debate and trump was making fun of Biden for wearing a mask, I turned to my dad and said  “How funny would it be if he caught covid?” So basically I can tell the future
Oh god, please pour that shit on Pelosi, McConnell, Schumer, Biden and Trump like a 9yr old dumps Mrs Buttersworth on some egos.
The pragmatist - Joe Biden would not remake America’s economy | Briefing | The Economist -
EXCLUSIVE: Newly Uncovered Transcripts Reveal Joe Biden Dropped the N-Word in Public Senate Hearing in 1986 -
Or how about this one - Biden had some of the virus on his person &amp; sprayed it onto Trump at the debate? I think this idea has real potential.
If trump dies the. The republicans have no one to run for President. If Biden does, then Bernie gets to run for President.
If Trump was pretending to have Covid, it would b strategic genius. Isolating himself as the sarcophagus Biden slugs on. When Trump recovers quickly, he’ll completely shatter the last shard of Covid death alarmism, reinforcing his base + on-the-fence voters.
I think that the CIA will eventually take out Trump, regardless. The Military Industrial Complex and Biden have Wars to conduct, for Israel.
I could be wrong, but I don't think he'd lie about it. Too damaging given his past statements (as evidence, see everything everyone on Left Twitter is dredging up right now - making fun of Biden for wearing a mask, talking about how it would just go away, etc.).
I never said Biden sucks. I said Biden is another politician that has been in office for decades and has not done shit for america. It’s the same shit over and over. America can see right through it. The best you can come up with is Biden? Either way we lose. Trump or Biden?
Prayers from Alaska! I know you’ll beat this and Joe Biden! #TrumpStrong 🇺🇸
“I can’t debate...I don’t feel that good.”  Imagine being so bad that you turn down a debate opportunity against Joe Biden. 🤣🤣🤣
Trump I can care less about he’s allowed over 200,000 of us die but Biden that would be HORRIBLE. Id be so sad to hear of that. Trump, meh🤷‍♀️. But Bernie earned his way in as the next presumptive candidate I think but the establishment wouldn’t have time fo that I already know.
Trump &amp; first lady test positive for coronavirus - ..Joe Biden shot back: “He’s been totally irresponsible the way in which he has handled the social distancing and people wearing masks, basically encouraged them not to,” Biden said. “He’s a fool on this.”
So glad Jill Biden wore a mask at the “debate.” Prayers sent!! ❤️🤍💙
1) does anyone believe Trump saying he has Covid without actual medical testing proof? 2) Does Pence beat Biden?
Joe Biden should be tested for covid-19.  Better to be safe than sorry... 🙏💔🇺🇸
Both Trump and Melania. I wonder about Barron? Joe Biden? Chris Wallace? Oh crap!
You know Biden is lying all that funny money his son got I’m sure he got half of it I don’t believe a word either one says
BTW Biden has a stutter. Should I assume YOU shouldn't take care of patients because you are clearly insensitive to these issues?  Possible.
I recon this is old slimy, creepy, sleepy, ’No Soul” hiden uncle Joey Biden’s break.
Right and your Tweets about Joe Biden being mentally unstable are what, helpful?
You sir, should study fluid mechanics. The masks that the general public wears are a joke, number one. Number three (ha, a Biden debate joke there) the masks are used to MITIGATE. That does not mean PREVENT. It means to MINIMIZE. Go get your mini wheats degree and stick it.
If the left gets their way and Biden is elected I’ll be the FIRST one to say he’s Not My President and I dare a damn liberal to say ANYTHING!
Seriously though. If Donald has Covid, he’s probably fucked. His age and obvious poor health are huge risk factors. Biden might be running against Pence
Someone who called the virus a hoax? And made all of our jobs harder. Even in Tuesday night's debate he mocked Joe Biden for wearing a mask.
Why would Biden have ANYTHING to do with closing the border? He’s NOT the President!! You all seem to think he can just pick up the phone and give Government Departments orders as a citizen 🤦🏻‍♀️ Trump didn’t CLOSE the border, he amended them. Look it up

Biden is the lesser of two evils and it’s not even close. We will just have to agree to disagree. Have a good night.

Trump evangelists, don’t try it with an educated LGBTQ+ woman of color. Not in this universe. 🙄   And I’ll mop the ocean floor before I vote for Dan Sullivan or Donald Trump. They’re toxic to our country.  ✅ Dr. Al Gross ✅ Alyse Galvin ✅ BIDEN / HARRIS ✅ Yes on 1 ✅ Yes on 2
After *going there*, the Dan Sullivan canvasser spent the next 10 minutes trying to convince my partner that Joe Biden was wearing a wire during the debate, that he can’t think for himself, that the Bidens are a family of corruption, and that Trump “cares about race” 5/
Here's what was true and what was false from the first debate  via
Yes and I hope Trump shuts everything down. Or Biden. We need to be on permanent shut down. No one qt allowed out. Military in hazmat suits can deliver MREs and water. No one outside. Punishable by life in prison..no one out until until no one can die from the virus.
More fake news more doctored photos more bullshit from the fake president. Impeached failure has to lie cheat the American people to make himself look better. That’s why I’m voting for Joe Biden.
Chris Wallace was awful, a shill for Biden. Fox News is dead, with the exception of Tucker and Laura
We see antifa rioting daily yet hear Biden say it’s just an idea and not real.  Same with MSM.  Think it’s fair to ask for examples of what white supremacy actually is before saying yes.  You’re a Nazi these days for not supporting &lt;leftist cause&gt;.
The left has polar opposite positions on everything, depending on the convenience.  Wasn’t it Biden that gave the eulogy for a famed KKK leaders funeral?
In any normal circumstance this is an easy poll.  But Biden with his “it’s just an idea” word smithing..
They wanna change the rules for Biden the Banana, because he has a hard time listening to his people talking into his ear through his ear piece

Can you make a rule that O’ NO, NO GO, “No Soul” JOEY Biden cannot open his mouth if he is just going to keep lying and slinging fake hypocritical xenophobic bigoted accusations that’s never been true. He needs no wires or ear buds either.
Real leaders do what’s best for those they lead, not for themselves! They lead from the front and by example! Neither you nor biden understand this concept! You’re a hypocrite and disconnected from the rest of the population that isnt rich! You jump from bandwagon to bandwagon!
I am sorry for being the downer here but we need to give old uncle, slimy, muli-faced hiden, ‘No soul’ Joey Biden his due. He has done many hatefully hypocritical, bigoted xenophobic, corrupt, racist fascists things that few if any were to help the American people. Greeds F.E.A.R
you aren't holding Biden to any expectation; why didn't and hasn't he come out against the "idea" of Antifa???? You sir, are a double standard walking. Just like every other single Democrat on this earth!
Or that he just insulted the late Beau Biden who is decorated veteran in front of the Nation and World.
Sounds like a a win for all of us and that trump is afraid to debate Biden again
Vice President Biden, I am a blind 57-year-old man working with the Alaska Center For The Blind And Visually Impaired. I would love to be part of your campaign and help out with the disabled people around the United States in anyway I can. Alaskans are voting for you.
Similar tactic Biden has with his son.  Any time he wants to get folksy, he stares straight into the camera, turn on eye watering, then tries to earn points.
I want Biden back.
Cnn said all polling had Biden with an 80% chance of winning.
You lying sack of dung! If that were true, I’d be super happy. The truth is that Biden doesn’t even support one of Our Progressive Policies. You’re just a complete liar! Wow!
Yep no go hiden Biden is just more of the same hypocrisy she was helping to spread including Haiti.
it is possible to be proud of biden for standing up against our bully of a president for weaponizing someones addiction on national tv while also protesting his shameful record criminal justice policy. 🤷🏻‍♂️
Does not matter. We already know all we needed to know about slimy uncle dead poll No Go Joey Biden from the last 47 years, his - families corrupt, treasonous and subversive activities and monetary bribery ‘Pay to Play’ with enemy nations as well as payola from others.

Michelle Obama Steps In To Save Joe Biden: Trump Wins If You ‘Tune Out’ Following Debate
😂 touché, Miss Amy. I think we each have a definition of “worst” and it’s based on our own perspective of the world. I should have started there. I can only assume future president Biden meant overall worst and I’m not sure I’m there ... yet ...
He lies to America he cheats on his wives he cheats on his taxes and people are dead because of his lack of care or concern for anybody but himself. He has failed the American people and he has failed his oath of office. That’s why I will be voting for Joe Biden next month.
So you were ok with Hillary fighting the results and now saying that if Trump wins Biden should never concede? But if Trump says he will question it thats bad? I’m not saying he’s some Saint but as far as I know he owns up to his mistakes unlike Biden.
I mean christ look at the kids on TikTok. Im sure  doesn't have a metric for that. Pro Biden content is on fire. Many of those kids couldn't vote in 2016. Yes their turnout is historically low... but ALL their social media is hammering the point. REGISTER. VOTE.
Here's a thought: Next time Trump interrupts Biden in the debate, short of turning Trump's mic off, Vice President Biden should forcefully say 'Two Hundred and (Five) thousand American  lives', declare a moment of silence and step away from the mic for ten to twenty seconds.

Now that a Biden presidency seems more likely, an important article.  It may soon be conservatives' turn to pray that Biden can preserve his vigor on the job.
Furthermore, the whole veil of "he'll shake things up" is burned off along with 200k American lives and everyone he's ever associated with is a criminal and the feeling is palpable. I have an aunt 2x Obama voter and 1x Trump who is voting biden. In PA. Fucker is done. GOTV

It looks like Trump's prospects are fading.  Perhaps it is time for NeverTrumpers for Biden to let us know what we can expect from a Biden administration, cum The Squad, the BernieBros et al.

Bullshit. Same tucking lame story every Election Cycle. In order to have a coalition, you have to make one. Biden hasn’t done a damn thing or even made one concession. You have this on your own, Warmongers!
Odd, since you're one of the few people in the USA more soulless and misguided than Donald Trump.
The dumbest take ever. I think Trump and Biden sowed their own discord and don’t need any outside help. We can easily see how their are both completely pathetic people.   You’re the One that propped up Biden while destroying Bernie.  And Hillary propped up Trump=Pied Piper.
I’m not asking for a complete list in alphabetical order. Just give me 1 or 2.   If the list is that long it should be easy. During the debate Biden said he wants to defund the police. Then in mid sentence he “changed his mind” and said he wants to give them more money.
Typical. If you had ANYTHING to back up your claim you would prove it.  This tells me that you believe everything the media feeds you.  You say Biden just changed his mind. I can show you over and over where he “changed his mind” during his campaign over and over.

Laugh in their faces and walk inside to vote for Biden/Harris
Here is a second story, which is bullshit, trying to implicate Iran as if they are being super aggressive right now against the United States.  Question: doesn’t the Military Industrial Complex want Biden for this, or is this an October surprise Event for Trump?
I so hope Biden loses just cause he’s a fucking Idiot. What we really need is a Revolution.
No one has been more responsible for locking up the Blacks you hate, than both Biden and Harris.  Biden’s not on Our side man....any more than you are.
I honestly dont care about Biden. I'm sick of hearing his name. I'm sick of hearing his voice. I'm sick of seeing his face. I feel traumatized. Can someone talk about something else and can we just ignore the democrats for the  next 4 months?
What the fuck is Biden’s message, you worthless Cheerleader???
Biden is a Mother-fracker...as well as most of the Democrats..🤢
Nobody has ever asked Biden about his self proclaimed mentor, the late Senator Robert Byrd, who was an “Exalted Cyclops” of the KKK.
I'm the same way! Like I don't support Trump himself, but I do think Trump has done more good than Biden has done. I might just say screw it and vote, but our electoral vote is so tiny ahaha
Biden is a POS...but I’m happy for you two!!! 🥰🥰
If you think Biden’s followers are radical left then you’re either insane or completely lying!!
i’m still gonna vote because there’s no way Biden can run this country better than Trump has, not saying Trump was the best president ever, but better than Biden could ever be🤷🏻‍♀️
Proud Boy narrative is a joke. They have no real power. The Military isn’t exactly fond of Trump. The Liberal Media is working with the CIA because they can’t wait to have their War President in Biden.
Exactly! AIPAC/Israel wants us to destroy Iran. Biden will go to War with Iran for sure. Trump has been reluctant to, so far.
Funny how many, including myself, could understood everything in those episodes which was exactly where the truth came out of Old corrupt slimy uncle hiden ‘Jim crow’ Joey Biden’s mouth. The only time he speaks truth is When his mouth is closed
Thank you. Why I was stepping over bodies just to get to my car today! 200 million people died during a Biden speech! The horror!
Biden supporters mocking someone while they watch their husband die.   Just in case any libs still think there's any real difference between liberals and nazis.  Liberals are just weak, gutless versions of nazis
Disrupt conversation? What utter Bullshit. What more could they add that we don’t already know or feel? The debate was a joke. Biden and Trump are pathetic.  Sounds to me like you are promoting a CIA Narrative to prepare for War with Iran.
Oh so when Trump says something he’s a lier but when Biden says something it’s just that he changed his mind.  Changing your mind means admitting that you said something and the changed your viewpoint not saying that you never said it.  That’s changing your mind.
That would be kinda hard, cause Biden will block you.
Yep, our President Trump beaten old slimy, creepy, sleepy uncle hiden ‘Jim Crow‘ Joey Biden With truth and facts not the xenophobic racist bigotry lies of Old uncle Joey and the Demonrats fascists Propaganda fantasies
Biden will just lock up the Black folks like he’s done since 1994.
That doesn't make interrupting OK - it's still rude.   But it's also not important, particularly in light of the content.  Biden didn't answer on court-packing, slandered Trump about "very fine people", confused his own climate platform, lied about Hunter, and more.
Biden may be old and have a stutter. But it's clear he has a big heart and a sense of empathy Trump can not match.
I wouldn’t need to.. my Biden sign can stay, because I live in a city that doesn’t discriminate by who you are voting for. That is as it should be..
Biden may be old and have a stutter. But it's clear he has a big heart and a sense of empathy Trump can not match.
If you look at it that way Laura, Trump was debating Wallace, Biden, Harris, Clinton, Bernie and Warren. It was a crowded stage for Trump's delusional mind!
Wut? So vote for Biden? No way man.
I found myself telling my 12yo that “probably Biden shouldn’t have resorted to name calling” to which my boy genius responded (with raised eyebrows), “but really, it was warranted, don’t you think?  I mean, come on, debating Trump would be irritating as shit.” Proud Mama here.
Earlier you said to do my research. He you are defending Biden and can’t recall any lies he has told?  Youtube Joe Biden vs Joe Biden.  May shed some light on the subject for you.
What’s even more appalling is that Biden did not condemn Anifa
One of Fox's CEOs or some such position was recently filled by a former Biden staffer.
Trump has no alternative but to try to drown out Biden. If less-informed voters get to hear anything like the full list of what Trump has done and not done, it's a catastrophe for him. Shout-downs and insults are his only option. Last night was completely predictable.
Oh yeah see I’m not trying to get black people to vote for Biden.  I’m trying to get people to vote for Biden.
He will just yell loud enough to be picked up on Biden’s mic. #TrumpIsABully
Biden did his fair share of interruptions also. My issue with Biden is he will say anything you want to hear to get your vote. You have no idea where he stands on anything because he won’t say. He says one thing to one person and the opposite to another.  Make a decision man!
He is using tax code put in place by Obama n Biden.  I don’t blame him for doing so.  I would if I could.
We get the klansman for 4 more years at least and Roe vs. Wade overturned, or we get a few months of Biden before Harris gets sworn in.  Nothing is fair, I’m so sorry.
You say ppl should not believe Trump because he is a con man. But Biden talks out of both sides of his mouth.  I support defunding the police.  I never said that.  I will ban fracking. I nvr said that. I want to ban fossil fuels.  I nvr said that.   He sounds more like a con man.
And Biden is racist. So many commments and pro KKK association on tape.
How about instead of a debate,  sits down for a 1-on-1 with  and then  sits down for a 1-on-1? If Biden isn't interested, that's his choice.
Tired of people labeling those they vote for by the politicians bad stereo types. Just cuz you vote for tTump doesn’t necessarily make you a racist and just cuz you vote for Biden doesn’t necessarily make you a pedophile.
I missed the first 5 min of the debate &amp; re-watched it just now. My immediate reaction was to notice that despite how we all know Joe Biden feels about Donald Trump, Biden came out &amp; was polite &amp; greeted the Trump nicely. It went downhill from there but it said a lot about Biden
Yep, following after old slimy, creepy, sleepy uncle hiden Joey Biden exactly. Joey says he has plans to help every American citizen and illegal alien while building up our military without costing anyone anything EXCEPT, his extremely wealthy communists fascists supporters PAYIN
Not even close, President Trump took slow slimy, creepy, sleepy racist uncle hiden Joey Biden to the back of the woodshed and beaten him like until Joey cried.
Yes he did. Despite Wallace’s soft ball approach with Biden.
Really?  This is all?  5) Drug Price are high.  Trump ain't done SHIT. 4) Police endorsements don't = majority of voters. 3) Biden isn't in charge. 2) TRUMP shut the country down.  (He's POTUS.  6 TRILLION added to debt) 1) Of course the Dems will try.  (You new to politics?)
Does this include the wire Biden was wearing or nah?
The vocal minority is always the loudest. You would be surprised how many people think Biden is a creepy old man who doesn’t know what he’s talking about or doing.
The Biden/Harris merch team really be doing the most
Saw someone get mad today that Biden called Tr*mp a clown in the debate but didn’t say anything about him being cool with white supremacists. Never hit unfriend/unfollow so quick
1. When  took a stab at Biden’s son, and made fun of him for addiction, he wasn’t just making fun of BIDEN’S son. He was targeting the MILLIONS of Americans suffering from addiction.
"I'll read my daily intelligence briefings" -Joe Biden
98 minute ‘debate’ An interruption on average of one every single minute. 71 of them belong to Trump 22 belong to Biden. I don’t want to hear anymore about how ‘they both did it’ when one did it overwhelming the entire time. So TLDR: shut up Trump. They need to turn off the mics
John, do you have anyone in your family suffering from addiction? I can assure you if someone did to me what trump did to Biden last night, I wouldn’t have been as kind as Biden. Ppl’s family struggles are off limits and it was a low blow, even for trump.
I commented on a Joe Biden tweet a few hours ago, and some fights started in responses to my comment, so my Twitter mentions is going pretty wild right now
Hell Freezes Over: The New York Times Fact Checks Biden On The Economy, Rates His Claim As ‘False’
Biden: Peaceful protests are fine, but violence and rioting is bad Trump: Proud boys, standby Conservative Twitter: TRUMP CONDEMNED WHITE SUPREMACISTS BUT BIDEN DIDNT CONDEMN ANTIFA!
Fact: Last night, Trump confirmed to the world he is racist. Also, his rhetoric indicates he is seeking to intimidate voters &amp; will attempt a coup if the results show he lost to Biden — a coup assisted in part by the armed white supremacists he told to “stand back and standby.”
I take it you didn’t actually watch the debates.  Trump was a HUGE ASSHOLE that took everybody’s time and would let Biden answer any questions.
We need to hear from presidential candidates about their plans to address the $1.7 trillion #studentdebtcrisis. Tell the next #Debatmoderators,   and   to ask  and  about student debt!!!
Watch while Fox News hosts cringe at Rudy Giuliani trying to suggest that Joe Biden is mentally ill and on drugs.
2/2  "For the sake of Peace &amp; Safety for your citizens, can I persuade you to accept Fed Troops to assist your Police in ending the violence" For Biden to give the excuse "I wasn't in government then" Is a cop out... If he had Guts &amp; Gravitas Biden would've made that call
Considering all the years Joe Biden has served in The Senate, and then as VP, certainly he should have the Gravitas to call the Mayors of the Cities under siege and say something like
Maybe Hunter Biden can help Don jr with his drug problem.
people acting like Biden actually debated or answered any questions, they both embarrassed themselves. In my eyes, they both lost and proved they both will lie to get votes.
Defend someone?  Maybe you should read my tweet again.  It was a joke about how the alleged use of a teleprompter by Biden made Trump act the fool.  I ain't voting for Biden.  ROFLMFAO    #MAGA idiots.
Biden said what nobody else has had the guts to say -- something we've all wanted to hear.
I agree Biden sucks. TRUMP 2020
Trump has certainly killed more people than Biden’s 47 years. America has 4% of the world’s population and 21% of Covid deaths, most of which could have been avoided if he was honest with Americans about what he knew of the virus Feb 7 #woodwardtapes  #TrumpLied200KAmericansdied
It’s called, The Calm before the Storm. Biden doesn’t have to prove ANYTHING to you. Let’s see how calm the reporters are when watching you get evicted from the WH😆😂😆😂
You wonder why everyone all over the internet wants trump out, but there’s still a big risk of him being elected because of young people not voting, protest voting, or voting for a third party that has no chance. Vote for Biden, any other vote is a vote for Trump.
Sheesh Biden n team are just too stupid smh
This is assuming all Hispanics vote Trump and all white college voters vote Biden.
#2020swingometer If only Hispanics and white college voters turn out, Biden could win by 30% (15 million votes) and still lose the EC
Assume I vote for Jo Jorgenson, rather than voting for Biden to push him over the top of Trump.  Does Jo Jorgenson command this cycle to move those policy proposals forward?
Only 5 weeks to go, Fatso. And peo[le are already voting. I told you I had a  bad feeling about the debate....you flopped.  Joe Biden gained eight points in just one week according to the latest weekly Rasmussen poll. Tick Tock.
The presidential debate commission says it will soon adopt changes to its format to avoid a repeat of the disjointed first meeting between President Donald Trump and Democrat Joe Biden.
In that regard I feel like trump was successful in his strategy. Biden being quiet would’ve been reported as a sign that he was weak today. And frankly, trump did need to stfu.
Debates commission says it will roll out format changes for #Trump and #Biden’s remaining showdowns  via
The lies continue: Biden claims he "got started"  at Delaware State but officials there say he never attended
If you think Trumps a racist but not Joe Biden who literally has on video and recording statements saying racist things your a dumbass and brainwashed.
How could someone come out of this debate saying "I will vote to elect Joe Biden?" Not going to happen.  Fixed it for you!
Debates matter,  someone i know called  they voted for trump then ignored news for all this time saying people will just lie   they wanted to hear how trump will defeat Biden so they watched the debate,   they not voting for trump or gop again
Yup I agree Biden lost  some of his base denouncing the new Green Deal
I believe to say their debate performances were equally bad is what Trump wanted.  Biden would have been happy to argue the issues and not interject but he couldn't answer without being interrupted. If Biden hadn't made the snarky remarks he did, he would have come off as weak.
I loved that comment from Biden!  all I wanted, was for someone to shut that asshole up! Trump is an ignorant loud mouth, who doesn’t care about anyone but himself. He did accomplish one thing.. he let everyone see who he really is!
And how he mask shamed Biden as well. Literally made fun of him for wearing “the biggest mask you’ve ever seen” while in public. At a time when we struggle to get all people to wear masks at all, he makes fun of them.
He did condemn white supremacist. It’s in the beginning of his reply in transcript of debate. Now how about that Antifa that Biden said wasn’t organized? And how about the video of Biden wearing a wire? How about Biden not answering about stacking the court? Or his lie about GND?
Good one President Biden! Alaska votes 💙💙💙💙
He did at the beginning of the interchange - in the transcripts. Even wearing a wire (which slipped out on video) and Wallace taking his side, Biden looked weak refusing to answer direct questions. Biden’s head and eye movements unnatural except when looking directly at camera.
“Almost everything I see is from the left wing, not from the right wing,” said Trump, whose exchange with Democrat Joe Biden left the extremist group Proud Boys celebrating what some of its members saw as tacit approval.
anybody else think "The President" made a sexual joke yesterday?  Mr. President, can you let him finish, sir?  Vice President Joe Biden: (14:44) No, he doesn’t know how to do that.  President Donald J. Trump: (14:46) You’d be surprised. You’d be surprised.
Trump's only win would have been to make Biden look bad in some way.  He failed.
I also died at the part when he said “every time I see Biden, hes always wearing the biggest mask I’ve ever seen” hahahahahah this man is a joke
There certainly isn’t! The President is a racist who’s willing to abuse his own people for power! Biden is right when he says if you lose, you’re out of here just like that! No waiting around for we’ll see. You lose you’re gone!
Biden win. Trump, the bilious buffoon, was what I expected.
I thought Biden did support the Green New Deal!  He needs to.
So yeah, I’m scared. No way in hell have I ever stood for Trump but I also don’t stand for Biden?? We’re literally fucked either way.
If Biden wins, Alaska is screwed though... but neither candidate is worthy of the position as president.. it sucks.
Joe was laughing at Trump's humiliating performance. No revisions. Biden won that debate.
And you REFUSED to condemn White Nationalists! Biden laid out a plan for our Police. You called on a Racist group to “stand by” Polls show Biden kicked your ass at the Debate 😆😂😆
Quit saying the debate was a disaster when the truth was Trump was a disaster.  Yes Chris Wallace could have cut the mike but people need to see and hear Trump.  Any moderator would have lost control because Trump is a pompous asshole.  Biden clearly was the better person.
Why is the mediator arguing with Trump more than Biden?
At the next debate, Biden needs to put a Dog Shock collar on you, so he can get a word in.
The “expectations game” turns into a sewer-diving exhibition.
the word is:  Biden by large amount
Joe Biden has the love understanding and compassion for the love of a Family member who has struggled with the disease of addiction. Joe Biden will be my next president.
I have seen elsewhere where Latinos preferred Trump tonight. You’re being fooled by the Media as to how this played out. Mermosa Moms May be Voting for Biden. But the Zealots will be out...and if Latinos back Trump, it’s over. Obama was the deporter in Chief.
This entire take by the media is completely about Manufacturing Consent to promote their Warmongering Agenda. It’s not like Biden is a strong Candidate with any Policies for us, the Electorate to Vote on.  The Media made this anything but Trump, which is why this debate sucked.
Ppl that aren’t going to settle for Biden👎👎👎👎  Please vote
I was concerned watching you speak in 2016. I was a supporter nonetheless after you were elected. Today you acted like a toddler throwing a temper tantrum while Biden seemed like a lost puppy.. God save us all... Where is  That's who I voted for..
I was just thinking about the same thing: Biden at least attempted to address the people watching; DJT was focused on bullying, berating and lying.
I take a two hour nap and wake up to people talking about Biden taking performance enhancing drugs. Dawg what the fuck
I’m not at all a Biden guy. But also recognize that every vote for anybody else is a vote for trump. And as sad as it may be - anything is better than trump. Biden at least gives some of the more progressive ideas a seat at the table.
I wish I could Mr Biden.. but I heard nothing from him that made me feel like he could be able to do that.
Personally, tonight proved that one debate was one too many!! I just want to she Kamala wipe the floor with Pence! What could anybody possibly get out of another Trump/Biden debate besides a headache?
Joe tried to get the first family in on it before President Trump said anything. So sad that its ok for Joe to do it, but when Trump blocks it and states truths Joe lies and then says yes its true. Like the drugs. Biden said thats not true. Then he said my son had a drug problem
Cause you are afraid that Biden will loose it even more than he did tonight. If we are being truthful neither one of them did good. And to say that Trump is causing the divide is so funny. Telling the public white cops murdered a black person when it didn't happen is the divide.
Why didn't Biden also remind Trump that Obama also served 4 yr terms, so the Senate could have voted on Merit Garland. Obama was still president and elections have consequences, Mitch McConnell!!!!
I think Bernie covered the bases, thus You’re lying.   I wonder why?  Bernie addressed Biden on: 1) War in Iraq 2) Social Security Cuts 3) Health Care Lobby vs M4A 4) no Green New Deal 5) no plan for College Debt 6) Private Prisons 7) ICE  What fucking Planet are You living on?
I’m no Biden fan, but man this guy seems a lot more lucid than Trump has portrayed him to be. Biden came with numbers and clarity and Trump keeps saying words like “stuff, many people, and things”
Biden was so disrespectful with those comments. Which he spoke from his heart. C'mon Man This was a spar. 2 more 2 go. President Trump is going to manhandle his cheating behind. It's on and popping from here on. Want Biden to show up again.🤗
Biden is up and Trump is down across ALL of the variable markets on Predictit tonight.
Red Wine is kinda like Biden, not my first or second or third choice of beverage, but if it’s all we got it’s all we got so why not
More Red-baiting from the deceased Soul of Senator Joesph McCarthy.   You fools make Putin look like a super bad ass. But I know it’s a CIA Narrative to silence all opposition to the Establishment Democrats, which includes neutering the Left/Socialists.
Why are you lying? Trump said he didn’t know Beau.   And if You’re going to support the BS Claims of Russiagate, then you have to ask Yourself what the fuck is?
Why do we have to watch Joe Biden be the victim of narcissistic rage &amp; abuse? That wasn't a debate. Trump attacked Joe, interrupted repeatedly, tried to bring up unrelated topics like Obama/Hillary/Hunter, told blatant lies, told racists to "stand by"... #JoeWonTheDebate #Debates
During tonight's debate, Joe Biden called Trump the worst president. What did you think of the debate?
Republicans for Joe Biden...aka a democrat.
WHY DON'T YOU FACT CHECK BIDEN TO YOU HIPPOCRITS
This isn’t Cosplay. This is enabling every single Military Industrial Complex Douchebag that worked under George W Bush, to Unite with Biden to Murder countless People.
Joe Biden lied so many times in the debate. They were obvious lies
And a considerable number of Americans were probably saying "Will you shut up" right along with Biden. Not appropriate in a debate, but extremely cathartic none the less.
Good column.
A Vote for Biden is a Vote for Imperialist Wars.
His name is Beau Biden and he died sucking his own dick.
I noticed that too! Biden didn’t even defend Roe VS Wade and instead defended Romneycare. 🤣🤣🤣  So, in essence, he didn’t propose anything new. For Instance, the Public Option.   And Trump already signed an Executive Order to protect the Pre-existing Condition Clause.
I really wish Biden hadn’t called Trump a clown.  It’s very demeaning to the clown population. 🤡
I was abused....😱😱😱😱😱 What a joke!  You abused Bernie Sanders the whole time he was running with lie after lie!  And now you’re going to use the Feminist/Abused Victim Hybrid to analyze the Debate?  Joe Biden didn’t even care to defend Roe Vs Wade. Wait!
Joe Biden was out there like “first off I’m not a liberal...”
That's because Trump interrupted Biden 1,232,598x. Wallace was trying to rein in Trump, a modest 76x.
Yep voting for Biden. Case closed.
Liberal’s heads are going to explode once Trump wins in a Landslide. The Corporate Media is so desperate that they actually have this Election as close. Biden will lose most Battleground States.
I agree. Trump’s base has contempt for the Media, Biden, etc. I’m sure they were cheering the entire time. Biden didn’t even take the time to defend Roe Vs Wade and wanted to talk about Romneycare. Fucking lame! And his brain was on display as dysfunctional.
Trick here is that he doesn't see anyone as white supremacists. So it was useful that Biden suggested a name, of some obvious white supremacists, and Trump praised them instead.   This is "fine people on both sides" again, for emphasis, in case you missed it the first time.
Tom Ridge, Gov Snyder, Bill Kristol... What’s so appealing about Biden? Only One thing! War!!  All these People are War Criminals and they want their Stewardship back!
But like why cant people agree to disagree. I dont like trump or biden. Peoples politics are usually very private and complicated
Well, he did say nothing about Biden is smart, and that seems a little personal.
If Trump had not ruffled Wallace, maybe Wallace would have asked the follow-up questions that Biden deserved.
So freaking true! And I didn’t hear Biden come to the defense of Roe Vs Wade at all. Just blathering about his favorite Heritage Foundation POS, Romneycare.
Trump refused to denounce white supremacy, doubled down on “patriotic education”, called for law and order and amped up red scare propaganda, while Biden spent the whole debate calling for “unity”, speaking in platitudes, and never detailing a single policy.
I fell asleep midway through. Got tired of Trump talking over Biden and Wallace.
With Trump's constant interruptions Biden had few chances to get his ideas out there. That was a strategy, and based on your reaction I think it was somewhat successful.
I’m pretty sure I heard Biden say that all Black People are the same...and it wasn’t a gaffe.
Chris Wallace was absolutely disgraceful. Worst moderator.  was not allowed to counter the lies that Joe Biden spewed.  should moderate the next debate.
I hate this political shit. But Biden has been in politics for over 4 decades, and now he has plan to save America when he couldn’t help it in 2008-2016.
Yes, #BidenWonTheDebate thanks to Trump's bad conduct, but Biden is a cutout for revolutionaries, so #MarxismWonTheDebate
Joe Biden said they was no difference between the two as well..these people are idiots.
And Biden should recite the preamble to the US Constitution, you know the thing.🤣
You can be against the shit trump has pulled and the garbage Biden has pulled too🤷🏽‍♂️ but go off man.
It is, unfortunately, not a surprise that a well documented despicable narcissist would, again, bad mouth a United States VETERAN who is no longer with us.  For his service in Iraq, Beau Biden was awarded the Bronze Star Medal. What an absolutely heartbreaking moment.
#Debates2020 Trump sounded very mad when Biden made talking points and was cut off by Trump even showed a red face
Voting for Biden is Code for: I hate Black and Brown People and can’t wait to Murder them in Iran, Venezuela, Syria, and Libya.  Also, we hate anything that comes close to Socialism in Latin and South America...  Liberals must enlist for Biden’s new Wars!!
Biden lost the debate but not according to the mainstream media’s propaganda machine
Trump spent his time talking to Biden. Biden spent his time talking to America. Not to mention Trump refused to call out the KKK and White Supremacy groups🖕🏼🖕🏼🖕🏼
Same...but tonight, I donated $250 to Biden.
Biden lost big time.
Mr. President. No one wants to talk about the look on Biden's face when you brought up the logan act. Right then and there was proof that he lied about no knowledge of Flinn. Investigation
“One in 1000 African Americans are dying of COVID but if he doesn’t do anything by the end of the year 1 in 500 will die” -Joe Biden So it will get better? 🤦🏻‍♀️#debate
His stutter got the best of him at the beginning; he was rocked back on his heels. But he got a grip, dropped his own intensity, and focused. That would be really hard to do with the shit-flinging red-assed primate unleashed. Next time, Biden will do better and the other worse.
Well there you go, Biden did what pretty much everyone in the United States and around the world has wanted to do, He told Trump to shut up!🤣🤣🤣🤣 #Debates2020
But slimy creepy hiden uncle Joey Biden just says he doesn’t support the green deal.
"Hunter Biden!" "China Virus!" "Murders and Rapists!" "Antifa!" All a fucking excuse they can use to to justify destroying this nation and enslaving their neighbors. Deep down they know that those neighbors are going to outperform them in any environment, so they need an excuse.
Please exclude Wallace from anything you want to be viewed as fair.  He was horrible after the RNC speech, clearly showing he hates Trump.  Tonight he basically finished second behind Trump.  Hard questions to Trump, no follow up to Biden.  Bye FoxNews.
Biden should stop trying to use a dead son for points.  He was in the usual build up to emotion but the pace prevented it.  Sick to see that used over and over as a tool.
I loved it. Trump behaved boorishly, but that's his brand - it doesn't hurt him.  Biden couldn't hang.
Biden finished third from what I could tell.  Tough questions never routed to him, Wallace handled those for him.
Yeah biden is a turd, youre right
But Biden actually acknowledges &amp; wants to deal with systemic racism, climate change, &amp; the pandemic. He wants to expand healthcare, expand green energy and green jobs, &amp; protect peaceful protesters, people of color, &amp; reproductive rights.  I'm baffled by Trump supporters. 5/5
Trump again incited fear about the validity of mail-in ballots &amp; the election, &amp; bragged about how his law enforcement has attacked innocent protesters. In contrast, my criticisms of Biden are that 3/5
That presidential debate was unprecedented. Trump constantly interrupted and insulted Biden &amp; the moderator didn't really stop him. Trump refused to agree with the results of the upcoming election, agree with climate science, condemn white supremacists, 1/5
Biden finished third after Wallace.
Biden was rude a few times at the beginning of the debate - telling the president to shut-up - but he settled down. Not Trump.
Shit. Biden confirming more debates even after this shitshow. Ugh.
Really? Biden has positions &amp; proposals out. He’ll appoint people who will actually work for the betterment of the country not themselves. He may not be my first choice but I know I don’t want to go through another 4 years of what we have now.
He told the President to shut up and called him a clown and the worst president in history.  Trump wasn't any classier, but Biden was just as bad.  That doesn't hurt Trump (we all know he's an ass), but it *does* hurt Biden.   And it doesn't help that Trump is better at it.
BUT wasn’t it priceless when #biden told Trump to shut up 🤐❗️❗️ FINALLY somebody said it! #BidenWonTheDebate Trump is a raving idiot!

Biden Beats Trump 48-41 in CBS News’ Instant Post-Debate Poll By Reed RichardsonSep 29th, 2020, 11:14 pm 123 comments  submit to reddit
Trump vs Biden &amp; Wallace
Here’s hoping this is the percentage win for Biden in the actual election.
Ok, but Biden's coalition will hold. Trump's conduct will probably drive Green New Deal progressives to vote for Biden, despite Biden's comments.
The questions and answers. That's what Biden was reading off of and writing on.
Biden won the debate but I don't see the leadership that the USA needs out of either man. The debate was horrendous and should never have happened. The only thing that I took away from it is that Trump is despicable and Biden cannot run this country. The people lost this debate.
Mediator: “Mr. President can you please let Biden finish”   Biden: “he doesn’t know how to do that..lol”  Trump: “well.... you’d be surprised 😏”   ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME??
“All the debate did is   - make Trump supporters feel less good about voting Trump  - make Biden supporter feel less good about voting Biden  - make Jo Jorgensen have such a spike in search traffic it took down her website  I’m good with that. -Alex Merced
if I got a dollar every time trump interrupted biden tonight I’d have more than trump has paid in taxes (:
Donated 100 to biden just now
What the fuck is the Biden deal?
Demand mic be cut off when biden talks
I love a 49 yo white man who’s an evangelical Christian &amp; whose family have been Trump supporters, but have a beloved daughter who has suffered from drug addiction, and Trump’s horrid attack on Hunter Biden tonight just lost their vote, and  just gained it. #Debates2020
any path forward w trump means dictatorship. barr and doj. on and on. Biden and harris will bring a team of experts and scientists and people who believe in public service. empathy. kids in cages released. covid &amp; climate change hope. we must vote. for ending this horrible 4 yrs.
So the hypocritical lies from slimy creepy sleepy hiden uncle Joey Biden was just that. Kelly Anne was correct and needed to be stopped. Only the Demonrats can stop their terrorism from their own unless our LEOs and elected officials take their gloves off and ready for war.
For conservatives, tho, that's exactly what we want.  And Biden didn't convince anyone he had anything better.
Good insight but the Quitman comparison doesn't quite hold for me. Rather, Biden seems a Buchanan or Pierce comparison - a doughface willing to bend for, and be used by the rising oligarchy.
I think Biden was thrown off his game, because tRUMP refused to abide by the rules of the debate - and Wallace refused to enforce the rules.  A lesser candidate would have been thrown off More and risen to tRUMP's bait.  Biden was outstanding, Despite Wallace's lack of control.
Knew Wallace would softball Biden and not push him to answer questions.  Immediately after the RNC he went into a long rant about how horrible Trump was.  Really bad moderator.
YES! ME! It was pissing me off that Chris kept telling the President to be quiet so Biden could make his point!
I wouldn't have dignified that question with a direct response, and I wouldn't feel less decent for it.   I would have said that Biden's supporters are already rioting in the streets - ask him to tell them now.
Yo let’s get Trump and Biden in the octogan!  talk about a blockbuster fight! #UFC254 #Debate2020
"Will You Shut Up Man!" Joe Biden-Trump Face-Off At Presidential Debate.
Trump over Biden/Wallace
The fact that he wouldn’t condemn white supremacy proves he is a racist. Donald J Trump is part of the problem in the United States Joe Biden is the solution.
You had to debate both the moderator and the former Vice President! The moderator didn't even let you speak for as long as both he/Biden did or at all. It was rigged!
Joe Biden clearly won the debate. A wise man speaks because he has something to say. A foolish man speaks because he hast to say something. The impeached failure Donald J Trump just had to say something!
Trump might have given them the smallest of cover with his behavior, and Biden can't keep up with that.   But if Biden bails it's aTrump win
Despite several instances of mild confusion and Wallace having to remind Biden what question he was asking, I will concede that Biden performed better than I had expected.
Sure, and much more can be said.   Will Biden's bad answers be enough persuasion to bring millions of Americans with mouths agape right now, to vote for Trump?  We are saddled with a Fremont &amp; cannot replace him. Who can stop the Dems now? My fears for our country are magnified.
Find a state candidate!  They all need help, and local candidates drive voter turnout. It’s the best way to help Biden.
Yes. Biden's directly looking into the camera was one of the best thing about this debate or shouting match: Biden's looks to camera during debate draw Jim from 'The Office' comparisons online  #Debate2020  #BidenHarris2020
We were watching the debate clearly you weren’t Biden had zero arguments or plans. Just far fetched ideas that he could of done the last 50 years but did Ntn. Gtfoh
Trump did beat Wallace.  Biden can basically be summarized as repeatedly saying “that’s not true, c’mon”. And if I hear “Scranton” one more time...
My guess is that his indecency will net lose more voters than Trump gained by the Biden flubs and the hard punches that Trump certainly landed.
The stupid childish mindset is “well Biden won’t condemn his hateful radical wing so I won’t condemn mine”  It was childish not racist.  Trump not a complete idiot he wouldn’t openly racist on live TV but he would be openly childish.
But Biden has to debate him again otherwise he'll look weak. Trump is his own worst enemy. The obvious contrast between the 2 men is very striking. That helps IMHO.
Me  Biden during the whole debate 🤦🏾‍♀️
It’s definitely not a good look for him, and anyone who has been exhausted by the craziness of the last three years will be forced to take the tenseness of the debate into account. I don’t see this debate changing much though, which will likely work in Biden’s favor.
Biden is clueless .
Biden’s the sniffer is talking about super predator, he’d know he likes to smell children
#Debates2020 we heard Biden say to Trump "Shut Up" ... we heard Biden call Trump "Clown" ... I don't recall hearing Trump calling him names, and Biased Moderator Chris Wallace did not once call out Biden for his name calling &amp; for his lies
That was a shit show.  We can’t even have a real debate in 2020...  But we did find out that Biden does not support the coal miners in this country or the green new deal supporters. No surprises there.
Are you nuts!!?? Fox is trashing Trump right now, and saying Biden won.   Trump told racists to  "stand by"  Trump LOST - he beat himself, for crissake.
I thought Joe Biden lost on Hunter Biden, and lost hard.
We know Biden will be better for Indian Country
Did anybody ask Biden to disavow Antifa or BLM?  Didn’t think so because he can’t that’s his voting base
Well, I mostly meant what you said about Biden, but you're right - that's entitled-celebrity levels of vapid.
Biden said this isn't happening and isn't true.
It’s not that Biden won. It’s the Trump lost and Biden managed to stay up right. So Biden wins by default I guess lol
I heard you prepped Trump for the debate. I think team Biden owes you a huge floral bouquet!
Trump lost so Biden wins by default
I’m now tasked in pondering what alternate reality I’d actually vote for Biden if Trump wasn’t president.   That shit scares me.
So are u voting for Biden ?
Just the truth and facts not like old slimy creepy uncle hiden Joey Biden.
He’s horrible! And Biden will destroy America.  so sad the direction youve gone. Maybe have a conversation with  ... he can lead you back.
You have no room to talk. You are part of the problem. Biden Harris or Harris Biden🙄 will destroy America.
I got so mad when Trump attacked Biden’s son about his substance abuse later on. Uncalled for.
Biden/Harris is DESTROY AMERICA. What a joke!
So who are you not voting for slimy hiden uncle Joey Biden our our President?
Except it won’t change the minds of his strongest supporters. We can only hope that this debate galvanized anyone who was thinking Biden but not sure.
Chris Wallace was not fair. It felt like the President was debating Biden and Wallace.
did not get to see biden suplex trump. I feel lied to, decieved, duped, hoodwinked
Better said, Trump immolated himself, leaving Biden in command of the field.
Face-to-face: Trump and Biden lash out at each other in crucial first presidential campaign debate marked by angry interruptions and bitter accusations
It's over &amp; I'd like to buy  Chris Wallace a drink.   He did an admirable job in moderating the debate. But I still think he should have been given the opportunity to cut off Trump's mic during all the times he loudly continued to talk over both Wallace &amp; VP Biden
So Biden is competent and Trump spews bullshit.   So glad we have two more debates
Lots of Biden weaknesses exposed - no answer on packing court, Green New Deal waffling, unwilling to name &amp; denounce leftist violence - but all overshadowed by Trump's conduct.
The drinking game should have been whenever Biden says, “Here’s the deal.”
Wallace and Biden doing their best to get Trump. Such a shame that the hard hitting questions all aimed at Trump and softballs to Biden.
"here's the deal .... " Biden #Debates2020
Biden try’s but Chris does so Chris would have won Biden goes back to hiding in the basement
If you take the time to fact check— Biden said some doozies.
WoW’, look who’s calling the kettle black, a true hypocritical Demonrats supporting, slimy hiden uncle Joey Biden’s supporting neoleftist fascists calling others stupid or DUMB.
Biden: Vote vote vote, you Americans have the power, all will be well.   Trump: Be scared! Fraud! I’m a victim! Ballots are flying out your ass!! The US is a fraud!! Aaaahhhh!!!  #Debates2020
Trump stopped debating Biden and just decided to take on democracy directly
Ok but who wins In a fight Biden or trump
One thing is for sure. Biden is poised, patient and strong-willed. Trump needs to be punched in the mouth.
This last segment Biden looking at the camera and saying people have the power....vote.  Excellent.
Yeah. He’s reading the invisible screen that no one else can see and that Trump isn’t pointing out. You think that if there was a teleprompter Trump wouldn’t call him on it? Seriously? Trump is covering for Biden now?
When Biden called Trump a clown, I felt that!!
"Fine people on both sides" is a lie that Biden keeps repeating
Biden won the debate. Reply with the hashtag if you agree! #BidenWonTheDebate
Next moderator needs to be more unbiased.    Listening to moderator he sound to much for Biden.    As a media reporter you are not suppose to interject the way you feel
That's an evergreen Biden statement if ever there was one
Welp. Biden does not support the #GreenNewDeal. Cute.  #Debates2020
What a bully we have in this president. He is a little off the rails. Hard for Biden to keep his focus and I know Trump’s supporters will play that up.  Big time. #PresidentialDebate
Biden supports and doesn't support the green new deal????
I think even Chris Wallace is ready to vote Biden #debates2020
Biden: create thousand and millions of.... hard,hard, good jobs  I pass on both hard jobs and just want the good one- thx
biden said trump doesnt know how to finish 😳😳😳
My mind is blown how Wallace is stepping in and debating on behalf of Biden. I do wish the President would step back and let it unfold. He doesn’t need to prove he’s capable.  #PresidentialDebate #Debate2020 #debate #debates #Election2020
Note to #Biden camp...he's a better person than #IMPOTUS and the country knows it. Do not stoop to his level.
The difference is Biden will surround himself with smart, capable, driven people who won't just tell him yes. They will move the country forward.
This is weird. Biden actually answering questions with specifics.
It looks like Trump might actually be learning something from watching Biden speak about climate. 🙄#Debates2020
I disagree. He should agree but only if there are clear rules on interrupting, and the moderator has some control and has courage to execute those rules. Biden's debate skills are on point - he just can't continue a thought with the baboon interrupting all the time.
Yep, this will be slimy creepy uncle hiden Joey Biden’s world chaos and destruction
Who cares? Biden is going to make a National Police Data Bank to keep track of Officers that get fired for breaking the law, so they can’t get hired at another Station. Biden doesn’t need their support.
Looks like Biden is reading from his phone. His lips are moving while his looking down.
POTUS- “I don’t know that son I know Hunter”  Biden- “my son has overcome his drug problems” POTUS-“Why was he given Millions of dollars” Biden-” I’d like to talk about something else” Hunter
Biden is doing better, cognitively, than I had expected.
Donald J Trump is a shit show on live TV. He makes absolutely no sense and he’s the reason I am voting for Joe Biden. The impeached failure Donald J Trump is a disgrace to the American people
I want Biden’s dentist godamn
Biden never did get that 30 seconds back
I went over there for two minutes, when he was vilifying Biden’s son. So now I’m back to just watching the Twitter feed.
I am loosing my mind!!! Why is Trump bringing up Biden’s children??? He has so much to say on that topic but can’t denounce racist white people #Debates2020
Trump has never once talked about his children with the passion that Biden just did.
Hunter Biden sounds like a wild dude...consider him my write in. #makeamericarowdyagain #Debates2020
Biden brings up Trump refusing to mention Putin's bounties on American soldiers. Feed cuts. #debates2020
Biden won the debate.
Biden asked for 30 seconds and he’s gonna spend half of that stuttering
Joe Biden yes he has not taken up Puttin in the bounties on US troops heads.  #VetsForBiden
We are now left with two candidates who have refused to condemn violent and hate groups for political reasons.   Trump refused to condemn: The alt right White supremacist  Biden refused to condemn: Critical race theory  BLM  Antifa  This is awful.
"he never keeps his word" BIDEN #Debates2020
When is the "Moderator " going to tell  to quit interrupting? So wrong!  #Debate2020   is debating Biden AND Wallace!!!!
Biden can't name a law enforcement agency that backs him. Trump won't denounce white supremacists and militia nutjobs.  There's got to be a connectable dot here. The FBI called them "ghost skins". #debates2020
Biden - Trump's interruption is losing votes.
Trump did his “elect Biden and the suburbs will be extinct” nonsense and Biden told him correctly that it was not the 50s and dog whistle racism won’t work. Except it is working too often. #Debates2020
Trump’s shit talking skills were built in loud strip clubs. Biden’s were forged in Sunday School.
Who Biden? He’s an idiot
both BIDEN and Chris avoid saying the word DEFUND #Debates2020
Oh my God, Biden will end our suburbs, per Trump. #debate
Radical leftists don't like Biden lol trust
Trump really thinks Biden's only chance is his "radical left supporters"? #debates2020
trump is a spoiled rich kid with undiagnosed adhd but biden doesn’t have the discipline to tame trumps bad debate habits. watching these two together is driving down my iq and democratic turnout at the same time
Chris Wallace is awful and Biden says nothing. Horrible format.
Biden is like a soggy biology textbook while Trump is like a plagiarized thesis written on an Arby’s napkin
Joe Biden's calm demeanor is important here - he demeans himself when he stoops to the #IMPOTUS' level.
Niggas posting pictures if the debate posting in their story “omg I hope Biden Wins” “TRUMP2020” not having ANY clue on politics
The Trump cultists and toadies will all say that his constantly talking over Wallace and Biden means he "dominated" the debate. To everyone else, he's just a rude asshole.
Welp.   I have no idea how Biden’s even being this nice.   Trump is a MFing clown.
I said it too. Biden should have.
Biden is wrong, State of Michigan Governor reported economy comeback
I truly don’t understand how Biden has made it THIS far🤯🥴
Trump just really brought up 250 military leaders' support. Must not have read that Biden got 500. #debates2020
Brain dead and brainwashed hateful hypocritical xenophobic racism of slimy uncle hiden slimy creepy Joey Biden
I agree Biden is a big baby
Trump’s strategy is to make an accusation and then talk over Biden so he is literally unable to respond. It is so painful.
Biden: "It's hard to get any word in with this clown!"   Truth.
There you go Joe Biden “It’s about your family” the American family. #VetsForBiden
watching this debate makes me feel like we are living in a simulation. the moderator and Biden are openly laughing at our current president because that cheeto rapist is so fucking dumb. how had he even made it this far????
"SORRY I CANT GET ANY WORDS IN WITH THIS CLOWN. E-EXCUSE ME THIS PERSON" HOLY CRAP BIDEN IS FUCKING GOING INSANE LMAO.  also i agree with trump being a clown btw
It’s not about Biden’s feelings. It’s about the fact that most of us who run small businesses wouldn’t hire trump for an entry level position. It’s that we are being laughed about on the national stage. Is it because his mediocrity is relatable or...?
How many times have we heard the moderator asking for Trump to let Biden speak? Jfc #SettleforBiden #DumpTrump2020 #PresidentialDebate
Literally just mute #trump’s mic when Biden is trying to speak
I feel bad Biden even has to stand up there and deal with this fucking ass clown. VOTE. Please for the love of god vote.
Ballsy of Trump to insinuate a Biden-Russia scandal. #debates2020
Biden when Trump starts talking to about his son:
Yep, hiden Joey Biden is lying his body’s language is very telling. He doesn’t believe most of what he is trying to think?
Biden said he'll  tweak the laws that businessman Trump had the right to use before he was president
Biden in 5 imo he’s just to consistent
WHOA HOLD UP BIDEN JUST CALLED TRUMP THE WORST PRESIDENT IN AMERICAN HISTORY LOLL LMAO TRUMP LOOKS SO DEFEATED
Your comment tonight about Biden being senile was deplorable. Your condescending and snide diagnosis did nothing except display your own idiocy. You are the epitome of today's "Christian." And the reason so many turn away from your ilk. Shame, sir. Shame.
Biden just said, "You folks living in Scranton..." #debates2020
“Let go of whatever doesn’t serve you” is kind of garbage advice but I think you can reasonably invoke it on watching Trump and Biden argue. Like you can turn the TV off, it’s fine.
Love that Biden keeps looking at the camera and talks to us...it's very effective.
“Do I get my time back” shouldn’t be just a fun joke, how much time has Biden lost when Trump can’t stand to wait his turn. #debates
"you folks at home..." Biden reaching out to the people #Debates2020
I’m waiting for Biden to call him a disgrace.  He needs to do it, or perhaps rather, *I* need him to do it.  🤷‍♀️
This is not a debate. Trump is incapable of debating. I wish they’d turn off his mic when he talks over Biden or the moderator!
Biden to Trump: “oh will you just shut up.” 😂😂
Is Biden sleeping?
Glad to see Biden holding his own. #Debate2020
Just now the host said: “Trump has been holding events but Biden hasn’t” — Trump cut him off and said “well yeah because no one would come to his events”
Biden: Will you shut up man lmao trump
not biden telling trump to shut up LMAOOOOO
Dr Fauci has caught a stray and Biden has caught a stray.  #Debates2020
Omg now Trump is making fun of Biden for wearing a mask. Huhh???? #Debate2020
I need a super cut of all the times that trump and biden end up trying to talk over each other, and I need it bass boosted
Why is Biden always laughing?
Yes. But Joe’s also bought and paid for. Trumps a new disaster, Biden is the old cancer we’ve been dying from for years. Pick your poison.
I think Biden has nothing and is using the pandemic as the president's fault
bruh let biden fucking speak dumbass
Trump accuses Biden of playing more golf than him. Does literally a single person play more golf than Trump? #debates
And it’s still not working lol. Biden 🤪🤪🤪
Biden speaking directly to the camera and the people is playing off really well so far
"Do you believe him for a moment in light of all the lies he has told?"    Great question to the American people from Biden.
Biden is talking directly to the American people, using Trumps own words against him.  This is the best!!!!
ZERO. Not a bit of responsibility. only answer is That Biden would have done worse.
Biden is doing a decent job trying to pick apart the idiocy of #IMPOTUS' claims tonight. But there are just so many.
All Biden has to keep saying well why haven’t you done it in the last 4 years
Biden to Trump: Shut up! 😁😂🤣
Y’all referring to old slimy uncle creepy hiden Joey Biden?
Biden has reached the “laugh so I don’t cry” stage of the debate.
Biden told him to shut up! 🤣🤣🤣
We need a President who lead us to a recovery after we have a vaccine,  Joe Biden is that man.  #VetsForBiden
#Biden is getting served!! Really all the president needs to do is let Biden talk 🤣🤣
I wonder, just how many Americans would rather choose our President’s health care plans over anything that those hatefully hypocritical bigoted xenophobic corrupt fascists Demonrats especially sleepy old uncle hiden Joey Biden would ever back?
Trump really just tried to pin Biden on H1N1. #Debates2020
Biden Empathizing.....#Debates2020  "how many of you have an empty chair because you lost someone because of COVID"
I'll bet that felt good. 😈 No one can fault Biden given Trump's interruptions.
Biden: “will you shut up man?!”  Honestly Im surprise Joe didn’t say it any sooner. #Debates2020
Biden by TKO in round 3
Joe Biden is making a poor impression so far.
Biden is eating his ass alive, I am loving this...
Biden: "Shut up!" Sometimes it's got to be said. Trump interrupts constantly. 🤡
Biden just told Trump to “shut up man” so disrespectful and character revealing.
We need a president who can lead us through this pandemic. Joe Biden is that man.  #VetsForBiden
#Debates2020  Trump is working on getting Biden rattled...if Biden can't handle Trump, how can he handle Putin? The President of NOKO? The President of China? Other dangerous entities?
I can’t even hear what Biden is trying to talk about due to how much he’s being screamed over &amp; interrupted.
I say Yang, but Bernie over Biden too
Biden calls Trump.a clown. Go Biden. More hard hitting from you. #debates
Trump is just going to choke slam Biden unfortunately
So are you livetweeting Biden's thoughts here, or the moderator's, or...?
#Debates2020   I know what Trump is doing...he's on track to get Biden totally flustered...if Biden can't handle Trump, how is he going to handle Putin? The President of NOKO? The President of China?  Other Dangerous Leaders?
Joe Biden's face is everything.........
Trump is out here debating the moderator instead of Biden #Debates2020
Cut Trump’s fucking mic while Biden is talking. He’s just acting to bamboozle.  #debate #Debates2020
Biden is sticking to facts and is measured in hiw he speaks.
Debates 2020: Trump and Biden face off in the first of three presidential debates #Debates2020
Biden and Trump look wayyy to old for this
Biden should just let him talk for 30 min. Then comeback with everything he said that was wrong.😂
Watch Live: President Donald Trump and Democrat Joe Biden will meet in their first debate Tuesday in a presidential election year marked by extraordinary turmoil.
And Biden too, but where Trump surprises are like "Trump has better accountants than you", Biden's are like "Biden's last administration tried to frame the opposing candidate as a Russian asset"
We need Joe Biden to be our President because we need a leader in the White House that can lead us through COVID and to a recovery.  #VetsForBiden   #CommenDefense. #VoteVets
Biden mocks Trump campaign debate claims: 'I've got my earpiece and performance enhancers ready' | TheHill
And Trump should ask Biden what he had for breakfast...
Biden *only* making a single gaffe over 90 minutes would be the big story.
Gawd I can’t stand the chattering class anymore. Listening to pundits like Gregory blabber on about how Biden has so much to lose and how it’s such a “stable race“ and blah blah blah. Everything has to be an ambulance chase with them or it’s just not good TV. Well, Fuck off,
don't see why biden doing amphetamines before the debate is bad, between calling troops bastards and doing drugs he's making a cool guy pivot. Tell me about Snapchat and I'm sold completely
Only you would think a) that's clever, and b) Joe Biden tweeted that
No. Biden / Harris. The country cannot withstand another 5 years of the egomaniac cheat.
#VoteBidenHarris2020  One of the many things I like about Joe Biden, the lack of drama over his taxes!
biden is going to be on so many uppers hes gonna look like this
So Biden is off the table...?
People making more money than me doesn’t effect me. Within months of Trumps election, my 6 year dead end contractor job with zero benefits went full time with a wage increase and full benefits. Biden’s plan would decimate my future. No thanks.
So much for hiden Biden’s plans to lockup all the country.
You Can Bet Trump’s Debate Prep Was a Total Shitshow  via
Uncle Hiden Joey Biden is a hatefully hypocritical lying Demonrat out of step career politician.
Very excited for Biden to say something extremely weak like "look, I don't want to punish anyone, but billionaires should pay their fair share." and then the next day a report will come out saying Biden privately walked that comment back  after the debate
John McCain's widow joins Joe Biden transition team.
DEBATE  PREDICTIONS:  Trump has set the bar so low for Biden that the country will be surprised by his performance.   Trump will under perform and will come off as a bully.  Trump will not know his numbers   Biden will get softball questions  I don’t see this going well for Trump
Biden will be lucky so say and remember that he’s running for POTUS, vs some other office.  All eyes are on Biden until the CIA Murders him and makes Harris the POTUS.  Biden has maybe 27 months, at most, before they dispose of him.
The only good thing about Biden winning would be that Democrats might just finally shut up and get what they ask for. (A failing country)
The Media is Our greatest Enemy, manufacturing consent to think that Biden is somehow the existential good guy, when he’s nothing but a mother-fracker!
If you’re Voting for Biden, at least please enlist in the Military and I’ll respect your decision. I mean, if you’re going to make it so we Murder Iranians and Venezuelans, please at least do your part. Don’t just leave it to the Poor to clean up Your mess!
why are you guys saying the n word? did you both vote for biden?
Looks like you’re full of shit. Just read where you say otherwise. Please volunteer and sign up for Biden’s Wars and keep it real!! Need more Warmongers like you to enlist!!!
I can't think of a single reason to sit in front of a TV and watch Trump interrupting people &amp; shouting, "Everybody is lying but me!" I've been there &amp; done that. After living through 4-years of his ineptitude, what could Trump possibly say? I want Biden _back_.
On the eve of the first Presidential debate I recall I once gave Joe Biden debate advice on national television twelve years ago.
Also, remember how  creeped us out standing behind HRC? Well, #Biden won’t have to worry about being labeled an “emotional woman” when he stands up to  #DebateTuesday #BidenHarris2020ToSaveAmerica
It Wasn’t top trending on Twitter when it came out Biden asked for the breaks but now that a statement was released refuting the claim it is... funny how that works. #ParlerIsTheFuture
Indeed. I have hope. I’m working my ass off to ensure Biden/Harris are sworn in on 1.21.21 (look at that date). Unless I’m proven wrong, which we won’t be, there will be a President Biden-Elect before Yule. 💙🔮Right is might and I’m with you, karma is unforgiving.
Classic Trump projection. Joe Biden knows more about the world, the US, the Constitution and politics than the entire Trump Cult combined.
My very smart adult son can’t understand why I thought Biden wouldn’t show. And sees a totally different side of the issue. It’s so weird to is that the other could not see what is so obvious.
Biden expecting a “ break” every 30 min while President??? This is laughable!!
by design even if trump has 12% less than Biden's votes he could still win, Biden would need 8% more votes than trump to win the electoral votes by comparison
I think it’s the Biden’s who use Coke.
Heard Stormy Daniels is in Cleveland. My respose to Biden earpiece and drug use. All false.
You are allowed to write off business debt. Its part of the tax law that Biden was part of passing. Dont hate him because his accountant knows the tax laws
Jealous because his accountant followed the tax law that people like Biden/Harris help put in place?
I am voting early for Biden-Harris.
Lol biden will walk off the stage like nadler did.
WILL YOU WATCH? The first debate between President Trump and Joseph R. Biden Jr. takes place Tuesday night at 5 p.m.
Evidence? People like you always on the attack.   Where is your parties platform?  Give me 5 reasons to vote for biden. Your attacks are losing votes for biden.
You are assisting the Biden campaign not reporting news.
Trump's attempts to discredit Biden could come back to haunt him in first debate                                                #ICantWait 🤨✊✌️#VoteHimOut  #JoeBiden2020
Joe Biden doesn’t cheat on his taxes.
Maybe he could borrow $3 million from Hunter Biden. You know...the money the got from Moscow.
My Response to Jill Biden's #VoteForScience Tweet (THE SAAD TRUTH_1132)  via
Biden doesn’t impress anyone by releasing his tax returns... his tax release is the same as putting a pig in a dress and high heels, all the while you still can’t help but notice, it’s swine!
Mr. Hiden Biden doesn’t impress anyone by releasing his tax returns... his tax release is the same as putting a pig in a dress and high heels, all the while you still can’t help but notice, it’s swine!
Hiden Biden doesn’t impress anyone by releasing his tax returns... his tax release is the same as putting a pig in a dress and high heels, all the while you still can’t help but notice, it’s swine!
this presidential debate has two purposes for democrats today: for biden to overcome the public perception that he’s senile, and to put trump on the defense for the next few weeks.
Alaska. and Trump is only one percentage point ahead of Biden here - pretty astonishing. there’s hope. (AK hasn’t voted for Dem prez since 1964.) #BidenHarrisLandslide2020
Obama/Biden used ICE to rid Our land of Mexicans when they saw fit. Don’t pretend it will be so much better under the Warmonger, Biden!
This isn’t commendable. They aren’t suddenly good people. How naive do you have to be to not understand that all this is, is that the Pro-War Bush Crowd is backing Biden in order to spill more blood overseas.  You People are so fucking blind...or just dishonest.
Guess that means Biden is the favorite Candidate of the Military Industrial Complex.  Now go enlist you and your Family, Mr Boot (licker)!!
Remain calm? How about ask him “If he’s done with his same bullshit” then move on! Possibly laugh out loud?!?! Mock the fucker, his ego won’t handle that at all! Biden just needs to be condescending to him. lol 😂 #BidenHarris2020 #biden #KamalaHarrisVP
he just drops them in a matter of days... as soon as we asked how bout that.  this speaks a little for mr biden.
Whatever happens tonight... Biden had better not let trump punk him!!! Dammit be a fighter &amp; call him the FUCK OUT!!! #BidenHarrisToSaveAmerica
Trump needs to just come out and say it already he wants Biden to Pee on him. He’s missing his years of golden shower Parties
Taking the over 2.5 on Biden saying “come on man” at +350
I wouldn’t be concerned about the Presidents tax returns. He was a billionaire prior to his position. Now, you might want to inquire on the returns of Biden, Pelosi, Schumer, Feinstein, etc.
Biden runs on Android.  The breaks are the really important item, that’s when they swap SD cards per topic.  IOS BTFO.
Yeah, we believe you’re awake now.  My guess about the break requests during debate.. Biden is running on Android and the breaks are needed to swap out SD cards per topic.  Sorry Apple..
I have zero faith in Chris Wallace asking Biden any tough questions or follow ups.
No. Trump.  I am very interested to see if Joe Biden can hold his own. I want to see for myself if what we’ve been seeing in clips is a true representation of his mental health and stamina.
Millions of voters will get their first opportunity Tuesday night to compare the candidates’ policies and personalities side by side on national television just five weeks before Election Day.
Is Earpiece Disruption/Interception signal needed for tonight’s debate to prevent Biden from being fed answers?
Trump: Hey Joe, how are you? How’s the fam?  Joe: C’mon man, I had dumplings. Shoelaces are a terrible threat.  Does my Velcro look ok?  Donald T.: Never better Joe.  I’m celebrating my re-election a little early.  Sorry for your loss.  Mr. Biden: Good to hear.
Biden earns his money rather than stealing it from vendors, swindling this country on his taxes, filching government resources and nickel and diming everyone around him.
Yes .... i want to see what Joe Biden will say and   watch him whoop orange
Beginning at 5:00 p.m., KFQD will be carrying live coverage of the first presidential debate between Donald Trump and Joe Biden. You can listen to the debate on 103.7 FM, 750 AM, or online at
Clearly Hunter Biden, the Clinton Foundation, and the Podesta Brothers can rake in $$$ millions from Russia. But Trump....
Another participation trophy for Biden.
It’s about time you checked into a nursing home for dementia patients Biden.
#Debates2020 Will Biden remember to go to the debate?
Exactly... Not to mention Bill Kristol, Colin Powell, David Frum, Jennifer Rubin, Gov Rick Snyder, and a bunch of Warmongering George W Bush rejects will be Voting for Biden. This Klan of War Criminals can all go to hell. And I will not be supporting their murderous cause!
Well....it’s like what Biden said: “Blacks are all the same.” And they’re “Super-predators.”   Hence the 94’Crime Bill, Mass Incarnation, and Blacks being targeted by the fucking Police.. 🐷   Maybe Racist America should stop Voting for Racist Politicians?
Yeah....Biden might win and we’ll go to War with Iran and Venezuela, and finish the job in Syria.  Wake up and smell the Fascism from both Red and Blue MAGA.
Please sent Your Children and Relatives to fight Biden’s new Wars on Our behalf!!!  Thank you Lindsey!! 😋😋
I’d love to move to Venezuela, but I know Biden will blow it to Smithereens. 😵
Biden is going to start speaking with an awful fake Southern Accent and say he’s running for Governor of Texas. And he has pet Roaches that he has all named after the members of the Jackson 5, etc.
This is all Biden needs to say at the debate:
CNN is in the tank for Biden and trying to make the news rather than report the news.
I’m a Socialist. Your arguments are pointless. Republicans aren’t going to listen to your ridiculous arguments. In fact, they’re going to laugh at you and mock you.  You might try something tactically different, like stop running shitty Candidates like Hillary and Biden!!
You idiots literally say that every four years.  You’re voting for ‘all Blacks are the same’, Biden.  94’ Crime Bill, Biden.  Warmonger, Biden.   No thanks...Going to War against pretend Enemies is the most evil of all.
Hmmm...Obama, the Clintons, and George W Bush all killed way more People than Trump has so far. And Biden is committed to murdering more when he goes to War with Iran and Venezuela. Not to mention that he will finish America’s Coup attempt in Syria, etc. Mark these words.
Listen to all you Xenophobes hating on Russians and the Chinese.  Israel and AIPAC has a proven record of trying to influence Our Elections by going after Rep Ilhan Omar and Rep Tashida Tlaib. And AIPAC wants us to go to War with Iran. And Hunter Biden got $3 million from...
You won’t be able to Vote for ‘a Bernie’ in the next Election if Biden/Harris win.  Biden will likely be either dead or in a Hospital. And then they will turn to Harris. And She could be POTUS for up to 10 Years if Biden can hang in there for just 2.
If the Biden’s are ready for jail!
I have hope that like me, after enjoying Bernie as the Gateway Drug, that others will discover what Socialism really is.  The Democrats are more of a threat to Socialism then the GOP is.  When you Vote for Biden, you will have sold Your Soul to Satan and will be a War enabler.
Better than Warmonger Hillary!  Whoever is a friend of Henry Kissinger is no friend of mine. Please enlist your Children in Biden’s new Wars!!
I love You Ilhan Omar, but I hate Joe Biden with a Passion. Please note that there are many of us out there that feel the same way.
could owe billions in taxes and I’d still vote for him before Biden. #Trump2020 Js
Pro-War Pro-Fascist Christians are for Biden....lmfao
Biden needs to champion changing it to quit rewarding the 1%. When the working poor pay more taxes than billionaires, ifs time to throw out the tax codes and start over.
And Hunter Biden got $3 Million from the Mayor of Moscow cause he’s just a good guy that Russians love.
The only time Biden or Harris or Nancy or any Dem tweets are on my feed are when Trump supporters I follow like them... am I missing something here.
All the idiots voting early for Biden will end up wasting their votes when he has to pull out of the election. Then they will cry their votes need to be counted..but if he's off the ballot, votes are moot!
I’m not Voting for Biden or Trump. But in my view, Voting for Biden is a worse Act, because you’d be Voting for a known Warmonger who has 100% Warmonger Support from the MIC Establishment.
Biden’s going to show? To me that says that the DNC has a plan. They don’t care how he does in the debate because he is insignificant to their plan. A plan that will fly in the face of everything our country stands for. They plan to appoint a President not let us choose one.
I’m voting for Biden and Gross.
🙋🏻‍♀️This Alaskan is voting a straight blue ticket.  All five adults in my home are voting Biden.
That’s nice. They pretty obviously leaked it to the Biden campaign though
Should take and display your drug test. Embarrass Biden immediately before the debate.
We are not a swing state. Only 3 votes for the electoral college .and it’s always gone red... I’m voting Biden
When was the last time the Secret Service was required to rent golf carts from Biden?  And give him money for staying in his hotel? #TrumpGrifter
Blue here watching those numbers go up.. Trump is awful and I have faith in Biden .. he is going to go up ..
Biden is going to jab first and then the Boss is going to mop him all over the floor. That's when they'll have technical difficulty 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
America says Yes for Biden to take the Test!
Things are changing! My Alaskan-born partner, who is 35 years old, voted for the very first time yesterday — and he voted for Biden. Some Alaskans just don’t get into politics, they figure things will sort themselves out, but the stakes are too high now.
Agreed, and there’s no comparison between T &amp; B. Not trying to say there is. Simply pointing out that the levels of grift are staggering, all. Over. The place. And NeverTrumpers who can’t understand why people aren’t on train Biden are blowing past the very facts that explain it.
And i was talking local law in major cities. Biden in office for almost 50 yrs and harris put more black people behind bars in cali then anyone. Do your due diligence. Vote independent
You gonna vote biden and kamala after what they did for stop and frisk and stupid weed laws in cali where she was a DA?
He's not attacking Biden for being Catholic, he's attacking him for being a *terrible* Catholic.
They have her talking about our Presidents taxes and other BS. Both affel Harris and hiden Joey Biden is constantly lying and continued spreading Manure they try to flip and flinging onto the President.
Probably developed a you know what over his choice of biden.  No guts.
Supporting Biden...when you were on Mayhem I thought you were grounded in the same beliefs.
Biden donated $1 million to charity and paid over $3 million in taxes. Tr didn't. He paid $750 in federal taxes.
We had like 50 at one point then they all quit for biden lol. They should all get Miss America questions that would be awesome
It’s not tax fraud. Direct your anger at the correct People. It’s a full blown heist at the expense of the American Tax Payer...is the Middle Class.  It’s the People in Congress who help to legislate on behalf of their rich Donors who make it this way. Bush Tax Cuts=Biden/Pelosi.
More Bush reject, Warmongers pulling for Biden. It’s not a mystery as to why this is.  The Warmongers love Biden.
Did Trump break a law? If he didn’t, be mad at the Establishment for setting up the System this way.  They’ve been cutting Taxes for the Rich since Ronald Reagan.   And no one loves Reagan more than Nancy Pelosi and Joe Biden.
I hate Trump... But doesn’t this mean that he’s the wisest???  Me thinks that Trump didn’t write the tax laws. And legislators like Biden would be to blame, keeping Bushes Tax Cuts in place.  No one donates their money to the IRS. If he broke a law, go after Trump!!
That’s quite all right anyhow because we all know how it would end. Hunter Biden would come out of the stall holding his drug test and then we finally see where he is LOL
You seriously haven't seen the plans  has already put out? Do some reading, man. It's easy to find on Biden's website.
Think Biden should just yell lie every time  Will Joe Biden Be Able to Withstand Trump's Barrage of Lies During the Debate?
Selling Cocaine for the CIA and to Hunter Biden 🤣
Joe Biden is... she’s part of a frikken fringe sect. Look it up.
Joe Biden stopped by today to thank the Rock for his endorsement... #BidenTheRapist #BidenDrugTest #Debates2020 #debates
when joe biden compares coronavirus to ebola i have a very hard time maintaining whocare mindset
I bet Joe Biden supporters hate Catholics.... and don't know #joebiden is #catholic.
Coron took as many lives as America has taken in middle East since last two decades..  Support you biden from India 🇮🇳
Latest on some poll numbers sent my way from Harstad Strategic Research on the #AKSEN race: Sullivan's at 46 to Gross' 45 (Trump's at 47 to Biden's 46).  Another 7% of undecided/Sullivan voters said there's a "fair chance" they'd ultimately vote for Gross.  #akelect
Did they endorse Biden Harris or Harris Biden. Not sure the ticket
You’re a joke!! You scammed the government with your shady taxes, no wonder you fought to keep them hidden 🖕🏼 YOU ARE SO BEHIND BIDEN that you’re grasping at straws to CHEAT your way to another term. You’ve already lost!! Don’t fight it. You already look and sound desperate 🤦🏻‍♀️
Direct action. I've been on this for a while. Best thing Biden's campaign could do is fix Flynt's water. Fix social problems directly. Great PR and cause.
So if Biden pulls a win out of his ass is there a lid on the Whitehouse every other day
Undecided is not an option. The wave of indifference and  abnegation is what got us here. I'm voting for Biden.
People who are for trump are solely for trump because they don’t like Biden. It’s always but Biden did this, biden did that, so trump must be ok. 🤯
Between him and Biden, there's be no time for actual debate
Yes. This is most definitely why trump hasn’t paid his taxes. To make a debate easier for Biden. 🤣
I vote for Sarah Cooper for Secretary of Laughing in the Biden Administration
There’s definitely whataboutism going on from MAGA freaks and hunter Biden right now. Sorry he’s such a cool dude
Use your business skills and negotiate a deal, Biden takes a drug test and Trump shows his Taxes.
Biden gets so juiced for tv its as obvious as seeing a crack addict
Now count the death toll in wars under biden &amp; obama. American lives aren't the only lives that matter.
He has to resign. Pence becomes President until Biden is sworn in.
Then how about a drug test for the debate? That’s a good idea. Biden is hiding.
Trump and Amazon paid NO taxes. That is wrong ! Biden / Harris, go win and then get on that shizzy !
Denial by Biden. Fawning by Tapper.
I heard that wireless earpiece radio frequencies should expect issues during the debates.  Has the Biden campaign been made aware?
CNN: Chris Wallace won't fact check Trump and Biden during the debate.   via
I want Biden to bring his tax returns, clean drug test, and a fact machine.   Then what would  do?.
Hold on. Joe Biden paid nearly $4 million in taxes in one year and no one thinks anything of it? Trump is awful for not paying. Biden is awful for accumulating so much wealth that even expert accountants can’t bring his burden lower than 4 MILLION DOLLARS. Must be gross &gt;$15 mil.
Joe Biden's disastrous policies?  Your boss has been President for almost 4 years. It's time suffering Americans hold HIM responsible for his murderous policies. Americans see through your dishonest delusional nonsense.
Biden? Self-indulgent? You’re delusional if you think he’s more self indulgent than trump. Have you seen the photo if Trump in his gilded living room and gold toiletted bathroom? Plus I think Biden paid a lot more than $750 in taxes in 2017.
At least Joe Biden was right for once. 🤣
Nope don’t watch CNN. Concerned about a president with $400M in loans coming due during his term. Compromised? In fairness let’s see what kind of loans Biden has that would come due during his term? Oh and thanks for the pedestrian insult. It shows you’re really not very erudite.
And these loans would come due during a second term. What kind of deals would he make with the countries that hold the? So let’s see what Biden’s debt is and what loans of his would come due in the next few years?
Well let’s compare this to what Joe Biden paid 🤔
Hah, your worst lie yet. Trump is going to bomb the debate. He knows it. Biden is going to beat him like a drum.  #BidenHarrisToSaveAmerica
Right and IF he wins a second term those loans will come due during it. Talk about compromised!!! Can we see how many loans and for how much Biden would have come due during his term????
U are either for Pebble/Dunleavy/Alaska/USA/TRUMP or you are for Biden/Dr.Al Gross/China. “Alaska is open for business,” “tremendous wealth” in the ground. Working class &amp; unemployed people of the region support. Area is flat, 1 of 8 rivers total less 1/10 of 1%. ACOE says safe!
I can't wait to vote for Biden/Harris Dr. Al Gross Alyse Galvin
How compromised is biden? Looks like hunter and joe are in serious trouble with the Russian energy company scandal, even more so now.
After a day, a furby easily makes more sense than Hiden Biden.
I can’t wait to see Biden’s gaffes at the #PresidentialDebates. They’re going to be epic! #debates #Debates2020 #Trump2020LandslideVictory 🇺🇸
The first of three 2020 debates kicks off in Cleveland, Ohio, where incumbent President Donald Trump meets former Vice President Joe Biden. Special coverage and analysis continues after the debate with   Watch Tuesday, September 29 at 5 p.m. on Alaska Public Media TV.
highlights. will tape the debate so can watch it if the highlights justify it. i just can’t tolerate trump unless necessary. go Biden....
I’d assume that Trump’s accountants have been keeping his businesses in line with tax codes passed by congresses that  has been part of for the last 180 years.
Dwayne Johnson Drops People’s Elbow On Trump, Endorsing Joe Biden For President &amp; Kamala Harris For Veep: Watch  via
Trump would even cheat on a drug test  As debate looms, President Donald Trump suggests he and Joe Biden take drug tests
Joe Biden is going to win in the biggest landslide in American history. ALL republicans will be tainted beyond repair once Trump drags them through the mud in the attempt to steal the election. We do not need a Republican representing Alaska if we want federal money.
So who else thinks Trump is gonna pull out of the debate at the last minute and say it's because Biden won't take his drug test? Am I alone? #Debates2020 #TrumpTaxes
Seriously. He could have remained silent. He didn't. Now we know Biden's getting one more vote. And I'm not disturbed about that. And it doesn't hurt that he's a big muscular giant who lots of people admire.
I'm down to drag Biden, but this is weak sauce, especially from WSJ, which should know better.  S corps aren't a loophole, they are a very common tax designation for small businesses. Any money they saved in employment taxes would have been taxed at their personal rate anyway.
Fast and Furious?  Wasn’t that the Obama/Biden gun give to the Mexican Drug Cartels?
If Donald Trump doesn’t prep and doesn’t know his numbers like he hasn’t in the last few interviews he’s done the debate with Biden is going to turn out a lot worse for Trump than anyone is expecting. Biden has done nothing but prep for a week. Trump hasn’t done anything.
200,000,000+ actually. Joe Biden said it.
Yes. The douche around the corner has a Trump flag. But he has to drive by my Biden flag everyday. I only hang it when I’m home though. I got two in case one was stolen.
“Progress takes courage, humanity, empathy, strength, KINDNESS &amp; RESPECT,” Johnson wrote.
Orrin Hatch was primary sponsor, knew D sponsorship was needed. Biden BEGGED to be a CO-SPONSOR!   So Thomas, a black jurist, gets a "F. C. THOMAS!"??? From another black man no less...😔  I love the (not) tollerant left!  #ACBSCOTUS
there would be no harm if you were to take your self out for RBG seat.  allow the american people to choose the next president 1st.  trump wants you to fix the election on his behalf if we get to that point..   are you of Honor and integrity?  AK vets for Biden
Yep, slimy creepy sleepy uncle hiden Joey Biden’s family involved in human slavery and child sexual trafficking
I really don’t think Biden needs Florida. 🤷
Hiden slimy creepy sleepy uncle hiden Joey Biden’s double dose of mental cloud leadership
Especially after visiting 3 states yesterday while Biden was where?
He submits to a drug test to dispel Trump’s crazy accusations? He sets precedent &amp; falls into the trap. He doesn’t submit to a drug test? Trump rolls out another slew of “Joe Blow” and “Drugged Up Biden” slanderous attacks, knows the “ReAL tRuTh” about why he didn’t test.
Joe Biden better not agree to a drug test. Not because he has *anything* to hide but because it’s a trap. He should not be abiding any Trump “demand.” Don’t set a stupid precedent like this because then Trump will always get to throw his weight around &amp; cause chaos when he wants.
Jill Biden just showed us a proper response to such idiotic questions. Just shut down those crazy assholes in the press --they've ignored the Sociopath-in-Chief's craziness and absolute unfitness for FOUR YEARS. Gaffes -- JFC.
Serious question. A lot of decent people are throwing their support behind Biden. Has one decent person declared their support for trump?
Impeachment, Russia, coronavirus, mask, education, truth, legislation, justice, Obama, Biden, Medicare,  the wall, taxes, pick one.
You aren’t effectively motivating me to vote, and I have been a Super-voting Democrat longer than you have been alive.  In fact, I was lobbying and testifying in my state politics since 1988.  So, keep in mind that I am voting for Biden in spite of your political savvy.
And where is Biden... probably at mass
Next Biden lie: says "$400,000 is more money than I ever made" yet financial docs show he made over $15 mil in just 2 years!
They are being herd and she is in remember biden your just a pon in this election harri is the one that’s going to be president not you if you get elected
Or Mr. Biden is just good at communicating complex ideas, like a real president does.  No surprise this blows Trump’s mind considering he can’t complete a coherent sentence.
It sure the hell won't be China or Biden/Harris that save us from the Chinese Virrus
Joe Biden compares Donald Trump to Nazi propagandist Joseph Goebbels, says he is "not that smart."
Joe Biden needs to stay in the basement 😤
I wonder what trump is on? Cuz if he’s talking about Biden bein on drugs it can only mean 1 thing!
Unlikely voters are going to give Biden a landslide like they've never seen before!
Odds are that rape baby would be his or Biden's so...
So, you are voting for Biden and asking others to do so?
Voting Biden/Harris
Wall Street is betting big on a Biden presidency.
It’s Joe Biden’s kid... Just call him Jr.
This is exactly how the world sees America and America politics. They see and hear the outright lies, half truths and bigoted xenophobic corrupt racist fascists propaganda fantasies of hiden Joey Biden and other Demonrats in government leadership office
I just have to get this off my chest . If you argue with others against Trump , yet will not be voting because you hate Biden . Then stop arguing and go suck Trumps a$$ like the rest of his followers .. Rant Over
Uh, yeah they are - have you heard Biden talk?
Was Biden’s dead wife the one who was DUI that day?
You actually think that comment was merited?  That Trump is comparable to Goebbels?  I mean, I wouldn't make that comment about Obama or Biden on a bad day
Trump is going to breeze to victory.  He's better now then in 2016, polling better than Obama in 2012, and a track record his base loves.  Biden, tho, is worse than Hillary - not campaigning, uninspiring, and doesn't even have the advantage of a potentially historic win.
Name the Rape Baby Joe Biden Jr...since he’s the Father...
Ohio is a state to watch.
If the Democrats do expand SCOTUS, I hope Joe Biden will pick extremely bright, extremely healthy people in their 20's who come from a long line of ancestors who live well over 100 years.
How to Debate Someone Who Lies
Obama and Biden used a dossier paid for by the DNC and put together by someone suspected of having ties with Russia to spy on the Trump campaign/administration. The case was closed 11-3, then reopened 12-5. Not a peaceful xfer.

"Policy makers have known for yrs that benefits paid to older &amp; disabled Americans will be cut unless Congress acts to shore up the program. That prospect seemed distant enough not to require immediate action. The recession has accelerated the reckoning."
How about Omar??!! And “Fire his ass” Biden??!! Are U.S. Senators and presidential candidates beyond Barr’s reach?
WTF. have you not heard how trump speaks about the living and the dead, military or men women and  kids in cages.  Henchmen lets see stone, barr, Mcconnell, don, eric.  should I go on.  you belong on f"""ING fox. AK Vet for Biden
Biden has flipped on every topic. Every dem and rep has stated the sitting president has the obligation to pick a justice. Good or bad its trumps call. Changing their tone cuz they hate him is not the constitution. The senate can withhold a vote which may happen
Interesting to see how Harris/Feinstein &amp; others attack ACB Catholic religious background, while supporting Biden with exact same background &amp; publicly discusses his faithfulness to his religion.
Cool plan by Biden, nothing I need to worry about as an Alaskan. Thanks for sharing, I think I’ll make a donation, then back to my moose hunt.
She will likely strike down ACA. Which means kids under 26 won’t be able to be on their parents healthcare anymore, and insurance companies don’t have to cover pre-existing conditions. This is why it’s important to vote Biden/Harris.
How come Democrat’s only use the words together, bipartisan, etc only when they are in power or as a promise for when they get elected. We remember the Biden/Obama “elections have consequences” attitude, IRS scandals against conservative nonprofits, and race baiting.
Hope trump gets all sweaty and his orange runs. I know I'm voting for biden and don't need to be sickened by trump.
while Trump is more conservative than Biden, I don't think he's really conservative in most things.
I'm setting up a Trump/Biden debate BINGO card game to play with my family on Tues. What should I add in the squares?
Oh and one more thing the things that you said about Trump is a baby child compared to the liberal left democrats he did not sell our country to China biden did Hillary sold us to Russia and the cartels Pelosi shummer keeps us in wars to launder money from Russia
You must be thinking of creepy Joe Biden 😳
No one has still shown me bidens platform. Just hate trump and sorry that still is not a platform. And calling me ignorant and uninformed shows your a moron. What is biden running on other then orange man bad

Will Joe Biden be a no-show at the debate Tuesday night and blame President Trump for getting the China Virus?
Prediction: Biden will come down with the China Virus and blame Trump for it. No-show.
Biden is a living meme.
An exercise in stupidity sold like NASCAR or some phony-ass wrestling event. Your choices are simple. Be ruled and enslaved by fascist morons. Hope a vote for Biden buys us some time to turn this around. Destroy the county in Civil War. That’s it. That’s the cost of conservatism.
Besides...Marx was emphatic that he wants us to have guns for the Revolution.  We must arm Ourselves against the tyrannical Govt, whether it is run by Trump or Biden.
Biden is a Fascist Warmonger! Wake the fuck up People...cause they want Your kids to fight the new Wars!!  Why do you think Bush rejects like Bill Kristol are behind Biden?  Because they are prepared to murder Brown People all over the World!  Iran Venezuela  Libya Syria Etc
Oh my goodness.  You are supposed to be the press....and yet you ignore the Democrats telling Biden not to concede if he loses.  They are PLANNING on trying to defraud the election and yet you turn a blind eye.  Shame.
Same headlines/ stories should be written about Trump and Biden. She is in a higher position it’s excepted that her income will reflect that, if it’s acceptable for men, it’s acceptable for women.
I’m a Working Class Leftist...and Biden is my Enemy. So is Trump. But there’s no way I’m rewarding the Corporate Establishment by Voting for someone who is a fascist, fascist, warmongering misfit who has a history of promoting mass imprisonment, violent wars, and no M4A!
I’m mad at the Hillary/Biden Voters! Why are You such Warmongers!!????
Well he's right  Biden doesn't even have a job right now
Just like Joe Biden. What else you got?
He does the same to Biden.
Perfect Statement.  Biden is the one being backed by the Military Industrial Complex, which makes him more evil.   I’d rather save People’s lives overseas, because they don’t deserve to be Victims of American Imperialism.   If we don’t rise up in Revolution, we deserve Our fate.
How good will Biden be able to hide an earpiece. Cause thats the only way he can spit out a sentence
More than a 1000, Joe Biden said it was 200,000,000 just recently. He also told you stupid bastards to clap.
Biden on video with the bastards comment. Just like he’s on video with his racist remarks. Trump story in Atlantic is unverifiable with anonymous sources. And actual sources who were there who say it didn’t happen.
Elect Biden. Expand the court by two or three seats. It’ll be a long 40 years.
rumors that Biden is a pedophilia are circulating, a false narrative that has been perpetuated by a photo taken out of context. The truth is according to fact-checkers, "no credible evidence that supports this claim. In Joe Biden's more than 40 years of public life . . .
Whoa. New from Moody's. At least over the near term, real GDP &amp; Jobs higher under Biden plan than Trump's. "Lower &amp; middle-income households benefit more from Biden’s policies. Trump largely does the reverse." Let that soak in; Moody's.
Two things can be true at once  1. I don’t think Joe Biden calling military personnel  “stupid bastards” was anything more than a stupid joke.  2. If Trump had done it it would be the top story for a week  That being said conservatives shouldn’t blow it out of proportion.
This is such worthless journalism. Like writing in September about the coming fourth game of the World Series. A waste of ink.
The Kremlin in  panic over the probability that Joe Biden will win the 2020 election.

Support from India 🇮🇳🇮🇳 Biden
“Now clap for me you stupid bastards”-Joe Biden
Hillary Clinton voting in because Biden has dementia. She won't let anyone take what she think was taken away from her 4 years ago 😂😂😂
Wrong!  Its Biden Vs. Freedom of Speech Its Biden Vs. The Constitution Its Biden Vs. Free Enterprise Its Biden Vs. The Free Exchange of Ideas Its Biden Vs. Protecting your families  Democrats are nothing but RACIST LIARS! and want nothing but to control the USA and Communism
Watch "JOE BIDEN FAILED YOU: Democrats Worst NIGHTMARE came True at Trump Black Empowerment Speech" on YouTube -
When Biden says this he’s talking about not being turned away from the ER while you’re dying (but still being billed down the road)  preventative care, dental, vision, mental health (the things that will actually let you live a healthy life) doesn’t even enter their brains.
Hmm...would Trumpkins claim “fraud” if the ballots had been marked for Biden, which would have been stronger support for their otherwise baseless claim. Clearly, a setup and a dumb one at that!
He can fight. It’s just dirty, and without dignity. Sadly, 40% of this country finds that essential for leadership. God help us all. The contrast with Biden will be sharp, as long as Biden doesn’t get flustered. That’s what Trump’s plan will be, petty and small man that he is.

Watch: Joe Biden refuses to call China a foe. Where's the Biden-China investigation?!
Unclear if the polls are mediocre, or if Biden performed mediocre in good polls. Im assuming the former.
I can’t wait to see the impeached failure Donald J Trump stumble his way with lies and nonsense trying to bully Joe Biden. It’s not gonna work truth matters fax matter Donald Trump doesn’t.
It’s not that hard to figure out.  All ballots say what party you are affiliated with on the outside of it. 🤦🏻‍♀️ it makes it really easy for someone to pick all of the Rs and throw those away.  I realize statistically some are going to be for Biden but that’s the breaks.
So Trump debates biden and fights the panel
