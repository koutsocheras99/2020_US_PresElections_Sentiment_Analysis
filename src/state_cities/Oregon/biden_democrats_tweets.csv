Biden is gonna beat Trump by 10M
And your supporters say Biden has dementia...and you don't even know who you ran against in 2016.
Yes, I want to see if Biden is capable of something as simple as this.
Sure. We‚Äôll wait. I wouldn‚Äôt get a vaccine under this administration if I was on my death bed. I‚Äôll wait for President Biden.
After Biden is inaugurated in January, we need an independent commission to investigate the Trump administration‚Äôs mismanagement of the coronavirus pandemic. Individuals‚Äîincluding Donald Trump and Jared Kushner‚Äîshould be held criminally liable for mass American death.
LMFAOOOOOOOOOOO  Thats why Biden is winning like 93% of the minority vote right???
One important thing that's in this poll and several others over the last month, is that Harris wins those who are enthusiastic Biden voters. Warren wins the unenthusiastic ones ~ ie: Warren brings him voters he doesn't already have a lock on.
You said "go check the betting sites". The betting sites all have the odds in favor of Biden. You're now saying "Well...the polls were wrong in 2016! Trust my gut over all evidence to the contrary!" Hence moving the goalposts.
3/ This coming amid suspicions / claims that foreign disinfo campaigns against Biden are heating up.
I agree. It‚Äôs time for Biden to announce his VP and assemble his Cabinet.
The way it's worded and listed right above MSDNC tells me it's what [they] are trying to make us believe.  Pelosi and Biden still push Russia, Russia, Russia and China is no threat to us.
If Biden wins the nomination, there WILL be a revolution, and the left will not like the outcome.
Whoever Biden picks, let's hope for a hard pass on Bass. This is embarrassing.
Is there any chance Barack will be Biden‚Äôs VP?
LMAO.  Chuck Ross, who will never get a real journalism job because of past racist authored blogs about blacks and whose followers are mainly QAnon cultists, has taken it upon himself to vet Biden's VP picks ...because they're black.
When Pew Research calls and you have to pretend to be a Biden Bro so you don‚Äôt get canceled.
I agreee. Very strong ticket. Biden needs a VP that could take over at any point in his presidency. We all need an AG that can clean up the mess, inspire and reform the Dept. of Justice
Whoa, Biden lost Ryan Cooper. This is a bad sign for the campaign, folks.
I‚Äôll tell you what I‚Äôm sick and tired of: White Male Americans in positions of power &amp; authority. IMHO, Biden‚Äôs choice for VP is hugely symbolic and important. I love  I would vote for her for pres. But I also love  and I think  should pick her as VP
Side note, it's been 3 or 4 months now, we can all actually agree that the Biden campaign ended #MeToo right?   The character assassination of Tara Reade was the end of the movement's fair treatment by media.
What's ridiculous to me is how purity tests that were considered absolutes in the 2016 primary, like federal support for abortion, were thrown out the window for Biden, a man who decided he actually "opposed" the Hyde ammendment a little more than a year ago.
Smh. Whenever I see a Trumper talking about Biden‚Äôs competency I slip further into the Twilight Zone.
He still should have done it in March though, because now we're looking at next summer instead of this fall, assuming a Biden win.  Neither party is good here, but my criticisms of Democrats should not be considered endorsements of Trump, who is again categorically awful.

Democrats love populist messages that don't threaten corporate profits, ones that do are less supported.   That makes them better than the GOP, but only marginally so.  Lots of people can't afford to go back to brunch once Biden is in office.
Joe Biden has an all star list to choose from. I am rooting for  but will be there to support the  ticket regardless of who his VP pick is.   Joe Biden‚Äôs cabinet will be filled with qualified people who will make America proud again
He was the WORST president to date we've ever had but if Joe Biden gets elected Obama may lose that well deserved title.  Get out &amp; vote Republican, even if you have to hold your nose on some of them. The Democrats are far more terrible &amp; without any ethical or moral standards.
If Biden wants an African American woman on his ticket, he really couldn‚Äôt find a better choice than NC Supreme Court Justice and civil rights lawyer Anita Earls ‚Äì¬†who unlike Kamala Harris and Val Demmings has been on the right side of battles over policing/incarceration.
Right... another good one for AG would be Swalwell.  I see him as POTUS in 2028.  There are MANY good ppl &amp; I hope Biden can bring them all into the circle &amp; use all their talents.  Warren is a dyn-O-mo! - I want to see her renovate public education.  o-mo!
I'm old enough to remember that when Obama picked Biden there was a huge flap in a lot of Dem circles. That noise went on until the convention was over and it was obvious that there was a chemistry between the two. This partnership is like a marriage. Same wavelength all day long
You can believe that   has giving this a lot of thought. I'm good with Whom ever he picks.. I'm with #Biden all the way!
Are you sure that wasn‚Äôt Biden?  You know, he really liked Byrd a lot.  Gave the eulogy at his Funeral.  So did Hillary.
Honestly, there are many who will not vote for Joe Biden.   Probably millions.   Liberals understand that we aren't going to donate to their corporate candidate, and they only care because they can use this to excoriate us.  I'm happy to respond by voting my values. #VoteGreen
I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll like whoever he picks even more than I like him. I mean Biden is good, but what a stellar list of women!
Has anyone looked into whether or not the Other Biden is on the logs?
We ain't swallowing Biden, much less his VP. #ReplaceBiden
A vote for Biden is a vote for trump! Don‚Äôt be a part of this inexcusable problem
Maybe Biden is getting that feedback now.  I'll support whoever the nominee is.
Most Dems know that the problems in this country are not all traced back to Trump. But the vocal minority‚Äîwho seriously believe Biden will save us‚Äîwon‚Äôt let them express any kind of dissent. Biden bros are extremely toxic. No one is allowed to question them because... TRUMP!!!
Or M4A? Think how we could be more productive 8n the marketplace? We are a nation of consumers, are we not? So, why not support it, Creepy Joe Biden?
Finally motivated to donate $5 to the Biden campaign so I could see Elizabeth Warren üòç but even better I saw Bailey in the background!!!
Watching Biden/Warren grassroots fundraiser.Joe is looking and sounding so good. So nice to hear a caring, voice of reason,empathetic. Presidential.They have a wonderful ASL interpreter on screen, too!Looking forward to seeing the amazing Elizabeth Warren too! #Biden #WarrenForVP
‚ÄúBiden‚Äôs VP candidate‚Äù is the new ‚Äúdrummer for Spinal Tap‚Äù
They are which makes me wonder where, and who they're really coming from. I'M VOTING FOR BIDEN, I DON'T GIVE A SHIT WHO HE PICKS FOR V.P. FULL STOP!
I think it‚Äôs about having experience at the national level, which is something she lacks right now. I don‚Äôt question her intelligence or abilities, and she is going to be an asset to the Biden Administration one way or another
1.5 million $$ raised at the Biden/Warren fundraiser
Kamala,  because of gender, race &amp; name recognition.  The amusing part is, during the debates, there was a clear disdain for Biden on her part. A lot of ppl think the DNC will remove Biden shortly after he‚Äôs taken office. I still wish the VP would be Pete.
Doesn't seem Portland is at all interested in voting.  No biden shirts stickers and when you talk to them, they hate hate hate Republicans and Democrats. There is nobody fighting for them.  So again they will sit at home.   Trump 2020  faaaaaaack
And even if the Biden camp had sexist reasons to prefer Bass to Harris, why leak them? Just leak stories about how awesome Bass is?
REMEMBER THIS, WE'RE NOT VOTING FOR A VICE PRESIDENT! THIS IS ABOUT THE SOUL OF OUR COUNTRY, SO KNOCK OFF THE BULLSHIT!  Whoever Joe Biden chooses you can bet he took the time to choose wisely! FULL STOP!
I'm excited to vote for Howie Hawkins for POTUS.   Biden could not earn my vote if he wanted to.
um doesn't matter who he picks. He will lose. He can't debate with big mouth Trump when Biden has so many damn skeletons out of his closet forget in his closet
Biden for president, 2020.
Rebuild with Biden..Donald Trump today went to Florida without a mask. It‚Äôs clear to see the death of his friend after attending his rally. Didn‚Äôt change Trumps mind. Donald Trump doesn‚Äôt change his mind, because he would have to say he was wrong in the first place.
I don‚Äôt defend Obama at all, my point was:  at the time he ran he was Not the very worse. By his 2nd term he WAS the worst. As compared to now, both Trump and Biden are the 2 very worst options and once again üá∫üá∏ forced to choose the ‚Äúlesser‚Äù of the very bottom of the barrel ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
I'll take Joe Biden in a Covid-induced vegetative state over Donald Trump at his very best 155,246 out of 155,246  times.
We‚Äôre not talking about non voters though are we? We‚Äôre discussing those who voted for Sanders in the primary and now are pouting about having to vote for Biden. Plus trolls who probably can‚Äôt vote at all and only seek to sow discord.
watching you endorse biden is uniquely devastating.
Warren would be great, except for the fact that she is old and in the same very high risk category as Biden. Non-zero chance both of them die or end up hospitalized on the campaign trail or in office
His Biden impersonation is spot on.
Um I'm not a trump supporter or a troll I follow Biden and I don't agree with trump on many things.  I saw your comment because if you look up DACA on search it'll pop up cause you used the word DACA . ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è I was just trying to explain what trump means but I don't support him!
I like Warren - a lot.  I honestly think she can accomplish greater things such as revisioning the education system - my #1 priority.  However,  ... &amp; this is true for whichever woman Biden picks, is that she'll be put into the VP 'role' &amp; her hands will be tied.
If they think she‚Äôs too ambitious, then she‚Äôs doing something right.  Fortunately, Biden doesn‚Äôt seem to feel like her alleged ambition is a problem.
If I see ONE MORE (1) story about Biden‚Äôs VP choices that makes NO mention of Elizabeth Warren at all, I am going on a full-blown journalism major TIRADE and aiming straight for these reporters‚Äô necks I swear to god do NOT test me with this sh*t anymore
I WANT M4A but Climate change is my biggest issue. I've decided on Biden. I know i've been going back and forth but I WANT M4A but I think a Biden administration is much easier to PRESSURE on Medicare for all than  Trump. #politics #political

Those primaries weren't over in mid March.  Also, Biden has been promising to announce his VP "soon" for about 3 months now.
I have absolutely no plans to get behind Biden.  Hope that helps, Tom.
So y'know how people are trying to say that Biden and Trump are basically so much the same in the ways that matter?  But look at Biden now  He's even oranger, as if the conservative racist within is rising up to show everyone.  I didn't edit this at all.
So where‚Äôs the pics of Biden partying with Epstein?
Oh no... I said earlier today that I‚Äôd be happy with Karen Bass, but I don‚Äôt want another 2016. This would definitely rile up the Q crowd with millions of deep state conspiracies that would really push the focus onto her and Biden.
Source is Joe Biden this week:
Karen Bass Kamala Harris I'm cool with either one, but I will vote for #Joe no matter who he picks. Let's stop speculating &amp; make sure everyone of our contacts is registered to vote, knows how to obtain an absentee ballot &amp; how to return that ballot #Biden
I have a feeling that Biden has a special important cabinet position for Liz Warren. Something to do with the economy.
Amazing you would pick Biden over Trump. Do you not see your own freedom hanging in the balance? Bidens America is the opposite of individual freedom
Oh, Pew Research Center lists her as a Baptist. No? Something wrong with that?
Please explain how Trump is better for brown people than Biden. I'm giddy with anticipation.
And btw - although I‚Äôm still voting for him - Biden has recently pledged to ‚Äúarrest anarchists‚Äù. That can‚Äôt be allowed either. It‚Äôs just as fascistic as anything Trump does. Protests can be ugly but we don‚Äôt round up dissidents here.
No. By not voting for trump, you are helping to elect biden, but without voting against your values.
Like this tweet there Biden?
I feel like this but with a bunch of headlines of war crimes from Obama administration, footage of Biden sniffing young girls, that monstrous speech Kamala laughs her way through talking about locking up kids parents, etc could be fucking hilarious.
in conclusion, it should be biden warren 2020
Me, too.  We need both right now.  Biden is excellent w ppl &amp; compassion &amp; Harris scares the criminals..... so?? lol, what's the decision?
YES!  I hope we get pages so Biden can see them &amp; his advisors as well.  HARRIS - ALL THE WAY!  you-who!!
I'm not claiming voting Biden will fix anything. That's your straw man, not mine. I said Biden is better than Trump, which is FAAAAAAAAAR from saying he'll fix anything.
The whole obsession with the veepstakes is hilarious mostly because Biden isn't even competent to make this decision, much less be POTUS.  #ReplaceBiden or #FindOut
Nor will President Biden as he has stated more times than you
I think Karen Bass is a Baptist.
It‚Äôs like Biden has turned to the balcony and Statler and Waldorf are heckling opinions on his choices...
You know I'll be voting anyway, right? Like there's local shit to do and it takes a literal second to check that box or not. I swear to god, y'all think I'm spending all my time prepping to vote for Biden or some shit.
Because the dude said Harris shouldn‚Äôt be VP because she rubs a few people wrong. That‚Äôs a standard not applied to male candidates, certainly not Biden. That‚Äôs called hypocrisy.
Why is it so many leftists online (not the ones I know in town) seem more worried e.g. Biden than they are about Trump?
Don't care who he picks....sick of the anyone but Kamala and only Kamala camps. It's Biden vs Trump regardless of their VP picks. Getting rid of Trump is the goal...if we get a great VP that is icing on the cake....won't be Pence so Yay!
Who do you think Joe Biden will choose as his running mate?
Hell no indeed!
I don‚Äôt see enough conversation about the caliber &amp; qualifications of the VP in context of a) a heartbeat away from the Presidency &amp; b) the successor to Biden (2024).  IMO none of the VP options is more prepared than Kamala Harris, w/ the psbl exception of Warren.  #BidenHarris
Yes, all of the other times, his VP pick is the 2024 Dem standard bearer, you're not voting for Biden, you're voting for 8 - 12 years of ideology.
Yes, all of the other times, his VP pick is the 2024 Dem standard bearer, you're not voting for Biden, you're voting for 8 - 12 years of ideology.
The question is, how would Kamala strengthen the Biden ticket?
"biden will surround himself with smart people!"
no shit. biden sucks. thank yourself and your colleagues for forcing his nomination.
In fact, it‚Äôs the klobuchar camp that is least likely to vote for Biden. Over twice as much as Bernie supporters.
It‚Äôs incredibly sexist to say Biden is going to elevate a woman to power as VP, but only if she doesn‚Äôt want to be POTUS. The point of the position is to be ready to be POTUS on day one. Rather than shit on Kamala for being incredibly capable and empowered it should be a plus.
Trump‚Äôs Poll Numbers SURGE Passed Obama‚Äôs as Biden Campaign Begins to IM...  via  Obama was the worse POTUS in my seven decades as an American &amp; Biden is 100X worse! Vote Red in Nov &amp; save our country from the far left Marxists.
I have concerns that she's not progressive enough, but I know that ship had already sailed with Biden.
Republican &amp; Republican-lite are the Wall Street approved options. I am hoping Biden will accidentally pick a VP who's vaguely willing to represent actual leftist policies occasionally. That way, when he can't finish his term we might sneak a little progress into the White House.
The [bipartisan] logic of a waning American empire &amp; the concomitant inherent belligerence to compensate for the perceived loss of US global power are the issues to follow, not whether Trump or Biden clinch the dog-and-pony race to the White House.
I guess there are some things that‚Äôd dampen my support and question Biden‚Äôs judgement after al
Top Biden Advisor: Yeah, We Really Screwed Up Swine Flu and are Lucky More Americans Didn't Die
the one thing making my existence worthwhile right now is watching shitlibs and pseudo progressives tear each other apart over Biden's VP pick
He's threatening to send his goons out if/when Biden gets elected, is how I read it.
Ok.  Regarding Trumps election scare tactics: doesn‚Äôt  the Electoral College determine the outcome?   So if those big states with in person voting and absentee ballots  results come in on time with 270 for Biden what difference will it make  if some mail ballots are late?
He is the antithesis of Trump, but he does not want to do anything with police or veterans or anything like that. We will get Trump out of office and then start protesting Biden a few weeks later. It is a lesser of two evils and I'm tired of the entire two party system.
Joe Biden can pick Kamala as his running mate, and bulldoze the trump machine clean off the cliff.
To my knowledge there is no 3rd party on the ballot. If you vote for someone not on the ballot, your vote is not counted. Its like you never voted. Biden has been in office before as VP. he worked with Obama.  He's my choice.
Though I suspect you won't like my vote. I won't vote for Trump and I can't vote for Biden.
Maybe even a "Fuck it, vote for Biden."
He's trying to learn not to be so handsy with women. It's one of the many problems that he shares with Trump. So, I know that you were being sarcastic, but it's not funny when it turns out Biden is just a less overt racist, old, white dude who touches women without their consent.
Biden you mean. Because they have no other means.

I don't think a single word of that is true. We literally nominated Biden to get back to a sense of normal, not because he actually stands for anything. Zero chance of any actual soul searching or prosecutions during a Biden administration. None. Never gunna happen.
Right, as if Biden doesn‚Äôt rub EVERYONE the wrong way...
I'm one of those voters. I wasn't even aware of the online movement at the time, wasn't on twitter yet. But I went from kamala to biden. Kamala had been the only reason I wasn't automatically biden in the first place.
who do you think Biden will Pick for VP and who do you WISH  he'd pick?
I donated too! I got a text with my Biden donation history today, and it's literally every time Warren has asked for $$, and only those times. Hope they get the message. :)
Yes, Biden all the way.
HRC‚Äôs VP pick Kaine brought 0% excitement.    made it to the debates.  She has a following.  She is tough and driven.  The only ppl that think that is bad are old white men.   Biden/Harris 2020.
"Grassroots donations are the backbone of our campaign"  And then there's this:
Man, your parents really did hurt you, didn't they! You are a sad petty man in search of praise. True Leaders actually lead without the need for acknowledgment of their performance. Biden will be sooooo much better than you!
Still think there a slim chance Hillary is Biden‚Äôs running mate.
How many Biden supporters are counting on the implicit compact that he'll be a one-term president who then supports his VP for the next election? (i'm raising my hand)
We need a federal ban on tear gas use by LE against civilians, full stop. On President Biden's first-30-days To Do list. Chemical weapons cause lasting harm, are indiscriminate, and have no place in a civilized society.
Biden/ Harris would be unstoppable. End of story.

I blame the republicans who pushed for Biden, who belongs to that same old white establishment men club... I blame you, jennifer.
Just terrible choices, both of them. It's one thing to commit to choosing a woman, but Biden bocked himself in way too much by limiting it to a black women. Once Harris blew up he doesn't have any good backup plan.
Joe Biden wouldn't know "real leadership" if it kicked him in the balls üôÑ
It'd be one thing if Biden won because voters wanted him to settle intra-party disputes, but he won b/c democrats thought a white non-"socialist" man would have the best chance of beating Trump. He doesn't have any mandate to pick our first woman president, nor should he (imo).
Sorry. If it was Biden against, say, any of the other Republican candidates from the 2016 election I'd be there with you, but Trump is different, and worse.
No we don‚Äôt. I‚Äôm a Bernie voter and Biden has my vote just as Clinton did in 16. You‚Äôve killed 150,000 and tanked our economy. 95 days until we vote you out.
what about what Biden's statement calling for the arrest of anarchists, simply for BEING anarchists?  Not saying this in support of 45 in any way. I just think we need to challenge all in leadership who target a specific political ideology.
By the time trump is convicted , Biden will be president and I don't see a future pardon for him .
I don't care as long as it's not Harris. I feel like the least Biden can do for all of us is gift us the greatest twitter meltdown of all time by not choosing Harris as his VP.
Rice has too many associations w the past; it would open up all the events of the time.  Just sayin' - there 'many' good ppl.  I hope Biden finds ways to use them ALL in a team approach to put the USA back on a secure track to move the country forward &amp; lead the world once again.
Joe Biden knows all too well how difficult a decision it is to choose a running mate. SO ALL YOU MEDIA HYPES, LEAVE HIM THE HELL ALONE &amp; AND LET HIM DO HIS JOB!  Do yours and report the fucking news, THAT'S IT!

üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇyou‚Äôre calling Biden a radical? üòÇüòÇüòÇ
My prediction is it's going to be that no matter who is VP. It makes no sense that Biden should unilaterally get to decide the future of the Democratic Party, and I'm confident that the factions of the Party that his VP pick doesn't belong to will agree.
PLEASE choose Karen Bass.
I believe the case is Doe v. Trump (1:16-cv-04642)
The GOP protects landlords, and  aren't willing to do anything meaningful. It's once again up to the people to force justice.  Let's see how long it takes before  is asking to have these protesters arrested and charged.
Biden seems like he's missing out on a lot.
She'll beat him. Matter of time. If he gets Maxwell'd that won't hurt her cause. And  is going to get Maxwell'd.  should soon have a compelling incentive to communicate with a heretofore unimaginable degree of openness and clarity. Just a hunch.
Bernie was so left, they left him out of the race on purpose. Biden is not that left, we know, bc he's going to beat you. #VoteBidenToSaveAmerica #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica2020 #VoteBlueToEndThisNightmare
It makes Biden look weak in contrast when you consider what‚Äôs being said and it‚Äôs all the worse when considering that this is specifically a search for a woman VP
Reagan, Clinton, Obama all chose VPs who‚Äôd run against them and had even said tough things about them (even Biden!). Bush chose someone with the agreement that he‚Äôd almost be copresident.
Worried about what happens if Biden wins. A popular '08 sticker read: "Yes, we did" And in a wave self admiration America went back to sleep, while   deported millions, separated families, bombed innocent people, sabotaged "Obamacare" &amp; strengthened Wall Street.
No, I'm implying that if people can work the rest of the system to get what we want, Biden will follow. Nothing more. That IS better than Trump. It's not great, but since I don't believe in accelerationism it is, in my opinion, a shitty stopgap plan in the absence of a good one.
Thank god we have Biden fucking over the left for all these right wing/centrist voters
Millennial tweet Biden is very unsettling because it is so far removed from reality... it‚Äôs like a hundred rats inhabiting a corpse and trying to pass as a human man
According to this survey, American's top political concerns are the pandemic response, the economy, and race relations - all areas where this administration has failed miserably, among many others. #Vote
Just saw on  that Biden will pick next week. FWIW
Joe Biden has not had an antibody rich transfusion as the President has and may not survive  Covid 19
I have no argument against that. None. (Biden &gt; Trump) =/= (Biden = Good)
This is going to be the Trump equivalent of removing all the 'w' keys from the keyboards before GWB moved in.    Biden moves in while massive 'renovations' underway..
Joe Biden will be shoed in to office because  TFS suffered by    his republican supporters. ( Trump Fatigue Syndrome.)  Green New Deal will cause mass starvation on earth . over 3 billion people will die. Sponsored by the Sierra Club and the New York Times.
What we know ‚Äî and what we don't ‚Äî about Susan Rice, a potential Biden VP pick  via  Susan Rice is lucky she hasn't been picked up for treason, after the white house meeting stunt on jan 5.
We should save a LOT of time and resource and remove trump and Biden, have Bernie unsuspend, and voila, we have a great leader who is ready for today, who can handle the crises America faces. He has the best agenda with the progressive platform. We need M4A!
Ugh is Biden really going to pick Copmala in a time like this
I have complaints about Obama but he‚Äôs not a raging narcissistic sociopath. Nor is Biden.
Good point. The Bush‚Äôs are probably voting for Biden, unforgivable knowing what we know now.
Whomever he chooses, Biden gets my vote!
Dems are real good at talking tough about their position and folding when they can 'get something done.' I expect nothing less from Biden.
I don‚Äôt think either of them will be chosen. It‚Äôs either Harris or Rice I think. Possibly Demings.
i honestly cannot comprehend letting expanded unemployment protections lapse, unless the idea is to saddle the incoming Biden administration with a bonafide Depression
Who are they?
Gun control in America has a very racist history. Starting with ‚ÄúBlack Codes‚Äù in 1860s, Reagan‚Äôs Mulford Act, Clinton‚Äôs AWB. All were reactions to Black uprisings/excellence.  Biden‚Äôs gun control plan is to add $200 to pretty much every part of ‚Äúassault weapons‚Äù 1/
It‚Äôs funny bc at least 90% of the annoying ID politics shit joe biden says is just his interns/social media managers talking. He does not know what a person of color is
Rich, white liberals like  being more upset at Joe Rogan having more listeners than she is about Tara Reade's credible rape accusations against Biden is exactly why Trump got to be president in the first place.
It could be kinda cool if you were Biden‚Äôs press secretary
It didn‚Äôt look like much of a funeral, it seemed like a political ad for Creepy Joe Biden!
I mean both are true, but Hillary was DEFINITELY a worse candidate than Biden.
Susan Rice remains the most likely candidate IMO.  She could be Biden's Kaine.
I have, and Article II after an amendment in the 1800s states: The election will happen on the FIRST Monday in November, so get prepared to get destroyed by Biden! lol  And this is coming from a Progressive, ex-Democrat.
Two women, Representative Karen Bass and Susan Rice, the former national security adviser, are among the most formidable contenders on Joe Biden‚Äôs list.
There's something satisfying about using my unemployment $ to donate to Biden &amp; Warren.   We need  as VP.
Are you sure you immediately condemned the tweet?  Maybe you condemned Joe Biden first?
The fact that I  have even decided to vote for Biden should be enough for them to listen to me,  I shouldn't have to trek half way across the city into the inner city in the basement of some church to tell leaders what I'm concerned about.  I should be able to do it on here.
I'd gladly take the "Romney bullet" to have avoided Trump, but I think had Obama been voted out the Dems would have assessed the loss as Obama being too liberal &amp; moved further right w their 2016 candidate. Hard to get more right than Biden, but I'm sure they would have managed
You can thank Joe Biden for that. Really. Prick made the bill.
That‚Äôs your case for electing Biden?
They‚Äôre always threatening us with a good time.  This dude makes Biden sound cool as hell.  Except for the dictator part, but still...
Reagan was 77 when he LEFT office.  Biden will be 78 when he TAKES office.  Was that your point?
I'm voting against tRump. A "third-party" candidate can't win, so I'm voting for the strongest opponent.  I don't care if it's Biden or not, as long as they can restore some semblance of sanity to this nation.  I'll vote for who I want when it won't end the world if they lose.
i mean, what would they even say? "we fucked this up six ways from sunday, but joe biden is ANTIFA now"
Trump is not fit for the challenge of destroying America and implementing the Globalist Authoritarian Agenda. We need Joe Biden for this job! #Biden2020
52% of Americans believe Trump will not accept the results of November‚Äôs election if he loses.    55% of Trump voters say they will refuse to accept a narrow loss if mail-in ballots contribute to Biden‚Äôs victory.
What's the change? Provide the proof. I'm voting for biden but if you can provide actual evidence you will manage to change my mind.
this would be like biden making an ad that appeals exclusively to people who have a blue donkey tattooed on their arm and framed, autographed photos of them standing with no less than three democratic politicians.
Susan Rice, former National Security Advisor for President Obama, is reportedly on the "short list" of VP candidates for Biden.    She says the Trump administration was prepped by the Obama admin, gave Trump 'pandemic for dummies playbook.'
If Trump decides to not run for a second term, would you Vote for Pence over Biden?
Yes, and they came when Dems had WH.  And neither president was perfect, FDR had intermittent camps, LBJ had the Vietnam War.  Dems no matter how faulted move the country to a more perfect union. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm with Biden no matter how imperfect.
Joe Biden is the Democrats‚Äô nominee for this year‚Äôs general Presidential election.
Exactly, that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs crucial for Trump to win in 2020. It would be a disaster if that idiot Biden won.  More testing equals more cases, however, the death rates are going down not up per capita of infected. Simple really.

I‚Äôm so old, I can remember the juvenile super-predator panic stoked by people like Donald Trump and Joe Biden. Turns out those dinosaurs were the predators. The kids, overwhelmingly, are alright.
Until then please vote for  in 2020. If you don't vote, or don't vote Biden you are effectively voting for Trump.
Those are actual photos of trump's America, moron. Those are the best Biden campaign commercials ever.  No more of trump's America.

Talking like a baby . Just like Ms Ford  did . It is lies .
Google "Biden qualified immunity" and let me know what pops up.
Fortunately you've got a great record in insisting on realities like WMD that turn out not be true while calling people who point that out crazy.  Didn't you say Biden was wrong to suggest Trump would try to move the election a few months ago?  And yet here we are.
Endorse Joe Biden, Jeb.  You and W need to do this for our country.
I think he's actually just being old-fashioned. Because VP picks have generally been done in the week or two before the convention (usually because the Pres nominee has only just secured his spot too). Biden wrapped it up EARLY, but stuck to traditional VP timing
Chris Wallace talks Biden VP pick, 'embarrassing' Barr hearing and Trump 'stoking a brush fire'

As Joe Biden would say ‚ÄúYou ain‚Äôt bl...err a politician!‚Äù
Gonna have to disagree with the conclusion to this statement. Biden sucks, but he is movable. Trump is a straight up authoritarian. There's a difference.
Also 45 expanded these detention centers and routinely encourages hate against non-whites. Don‚Äôt be stupid I can‚Äôt wait for him to be voted out. And no I don‚Äôt like biden but 45 needs to go.
What about His son Hunter getting millions from U.S. aid to Ukrain deal. As well as 1.5 billion from trip to China. STINKS to high heaven. I have to question your judgement on voting for Biden. Have a good day. And thanks for your service.

You make me sick. Defending a child rapist is about as low as you can go.
She was threatened. Trump's goons followed her and threatened to kill her family.
No it has not.
She says she withdrew due to her life and the life of family members was threatened.
Thank you for speaking out. He only wants his voters to vote by mail &amp; use absentee ballots. He knows he's losing. He can't beat Biden fairly &amp; he knows that. He must chest to win.
Biden has a private island and Maxwell's submarine is parked there but all the sex slave children are in the underground sex facilities at Mar-a-Lago. Sheesh. Catch up!!!
GET REAL! Biden never was but  IS in a position to do lots he promised and hasn't Look where we are now The stock market is down, again Covid is out of control He's seen to it that USPS will be hamstrung on election day. Immigrant children STILL not with parents
What should be Biden's top priority?  *Voting Rights *Electoral College *Income Inequality  *Climate Change  *Gerrymandering  *Healthcare  *Criminal Justice Reform  *Guns *Raise Taxes *Other #Resist

Trump v Biden   Is actually  Democrat v Nazis
It is about degrees. I hate Biden but I loathe Trump. I am leaning toward despising Biden but that still is a hair short of loathing. This is voting in America, for me.
Biden may be the only person to actually be reading the briefing.
Are we sure Bernie doesn‚Äôt agree? Bernie is supporting Biden.
no. that‚Äôs pretty obvious. that‚Äôs the whole point of biden‚Äôs candidacy.
If you're ancient Egyptian and you support Trump #YouAintBlack #Biden #BLM
This ad I got soliciting me to donate to Biden looks like a candidate report card where he‚Äôs received a ‚ÄúB‚Äù which neatly sums up how that campaigns strategy seems to me.

Kinda like Biden - if you aren't smart enough to follow the conversation, I can't help you...
Love it when you guys try to play the dementia card--Biden is a doddering dumbshit and a creep, but your special boy? Have you heart him speak? Have you read his tweets?
When Biden's dementia becomes impossible to hide, and the Dems need to pick a new candidate, they will ask for a delay...  But they will all be on the record as against any delay.  üé™ ü§°üíØüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
I don't like Biden at all, but he's crushing Trump right now. At this point, it would take a colossal fuckup from him to lose.  Always a possibility when dealing with Biden, but his team is doing a great job of hiding him.
Thee is no lead so big Trump won‚Äôt try to steal it.  He is going to DAZZLE us with the bullshit he comes up with - before and after the election - to try to turn the tide.  If you think Biden‚Äôs gonna walk away with this thing, clean and easy, you‚Äôre underestimating Trump again.
Surprised he didn't save that bat shit crazy statement for the Biden VP pick and instead used it for the tanking economy numbers and Herman Cain's Trump rally Corona death.  Let's see what look over there he has for the VP pick. Couldn't be more crazy?
"I may not be surprise" that you made a dumb statement or that you're voting for someone who has been destroying the country for decades: #YouAintBlack #Biden #BLM.
no one disagrees that biden is a move to the right
ü§£ü§£ what a load of drivel and whataboutism. Never mentioned Biden, mentioned Trump being a mess, which he has been. Won‚Äôt be getting my vote this election.
And creating the usual fog of disinformation to rob the winner of legitimacy,while utter bullshit,will work with enough people to be an obstacle to Biden and all Dems.Unless,of course,people smarten up.
Joe Biden‚Äôs tv commercial says he wants to keep Americans safe and healthy. So we can expect him to challenge his own platform committee forcefully on #MedicareForAll.  Right? ü§î
So any criticism against Biden is not okay? Justified criticism, like this? It's a dilemma that makes people hate politics and hate getting involved in society. The DNC is not entitled to my vote. I will no longer be in this abusive relationship.
Tonight! Join Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren!  They talk in complete sentences and have a plan to fix the country!!!
I understand the predicament, I too will be supporting Joe Biden or any human that can breath over jackass. That being said, Biden will deliver what the Country needs now. However, he is a Corp dem..ü§Æü§Æü§Æ
Biden has never once advocated defunding the police, and is the man behind the crime bill in the 90's, which he still stands by today so you're either I'll informed, or lying.
Biden is the guy who gave us Trump, Becky.
Biden will pick Kamala because she is the most prepared to be President and she will absolutely turn a VP debate into a SNL highlight film making Pence look so stupid. God I wouldn‚Äôt want to debate Kamala, she is a verbal assassin just ask Kavanaugh
the idea that biden would be some sort of deceleration seems to ignore the trajectory of american politics.
i think what irks me about this "settle for biden" bs is that it dances around the subject of how democrats - specifically joe biden - are complicit in what they would define as "trumpism".
you have to wonder about the health of your party when "settle for biden" is a thing that's gaining traction.
Kamala is the most prepared to take the helm of the presidency. In many ways she would be a better choice than Biden himself.
i don't know which is more pathetic:  this hang-dog "boohoo, we have to vote for a segregationist" mummery or biden's true believers.
I‚Äôve been #NeverBiden for a long time but recently, I‚Äôve realized that Trump is as bad as the faux-resistance folks say he is. It‚Äôs a tough thing to concede but I will probably end up voting for Biden. But we HAVE to keep pushing just as hard throughout Biden‚Äôs presidency.
This all day long. I see kamala all the time on media and she never fails to say we have to elect Joe Biden. I haven't heard from Bernie at all.
Dude, just take the loss. Biden has dementia.
I get an email every 45 seconds from one blue org or the other, asking my opinion about VP choices. Stop. Elizabeth Warren, please. I‚Äôm so tired of her being the Hermione Granger to Biden‚Äôs Ron. Let the woman with the magic in already.
Biden thinks the pony express is still a thing.
He's just distracting. Joe Biden is not "radical" left.
Saw Obama today on TV! Just reminds me of 8 years of hell. No leadership by him and Sleepy Joe Biden! Thank God for the Electoral College.

Besides VP Biden should announce his cabinet and other top positions this summer...that way "the team" can start working, planning, etc and can hit the ground running...including planning legislation for first day, week, month, 100 days...would help buoy the people's spirit...
No he is not.  Stop your Biden bashing.
Youre right, vote biden!
Biden has run for President approximately a million times. What is that if not ambitious?
I think I am at the "you could tell me that Biden invented Covid"   and I'd be like.. "eeeeehhhh but still..."  -stage
The weakest reason to vote for Biden I've seen yet. Straight from corn pops own Twitter account.
What a fucking joke. Its all such a joke &amp; plug for the prision industrial complex. Like both sides now have leaders that want to incarcerate people en masse. Link to Biden from the past above bc news outlets are too scared to say stuff now i guess?
This mom is voting for Joe. And we all want schools to reopen...when it‚Äôs safe. I trust Joe Biden will surround himself with worthy, qualified experts to inform us and keep our children safe.
FUN FACT:  Donald Trump got impeached for trying to dig up dirt on Joe Biden and now he is going to lose to Joe Biden.
we‚Äôve set the bar so low for biden. less authoritarian and somewhat more competent pandemic response. everything else probably not gonna change, even though it needs to change. Wheeeeee
That depends on how much longer the GOP can keep Trump afloat. If Trump  is forced to resign mid-August like Nixon was, Pence will appoint a VP, pardon Trump and mount some kind of campaign against Biden.

I've had to say this before elsewhere, but the Trojan Horse analogy does not work for Biden. It is clear and obvious what he's ushering in. There are no hidden forces at work. You can see the strings as easily as a middle school Peter Pan production.
We do.   So do something bout it.   Biden won‚Äôt.
The number of people positively responding to Biden‚Äôs tweet, eager to be plugged back into the matrix, is disappointing.

I don't need to read a bunch of lies and empty promises when I can just look at Biden's entire 40 year career in Washington.
Swing Voters in Michigan gave Joe Biden tte Worst News!!
He should but he won‚Äôt. They hate Democrats so much they‚Äôd rather destroy the country. In Texas a vote for anyone but Biden is a vote for Trump. And Trump is an existential threat. Go figure. Bolton is the same - he knows what Trump is doing to America but won‚Äôt vote for Biden.
there are ALREADY much more progressive dems than biden IN OFFICE whp have been trying to make progress, but just can't get anything off the ground  the dems trying and failing vs the gop actively killing ppl is, still real simple math
Correctamundo...  Angel for DNR Joe 30330 is Dr Jill Biden.
plus it deff ignores that trump ran as a segregationist and 60% of white ppl said 'yes plz'  or that bush started everything obama "failed to stop"  plus the takeway still isn't 'biden will never move to the left and a vote for biden is a vote for worse-than-trump in 24 "
trump may try to say Biden is afraid to debate him.
holding dems accountable for tilting right is deff an important conversatuon to have, but while mcconnell is still in power it, doesnt matter?  the v progressive house relief bill passed in MAY has been just sitting in a drawer  biden sucks but if he can beat trump AND mcconnell?
biden sucks but what other option is there today? vote not for him but for:   - rbg can retire  - aoc warren and bernie can send progressive legislation to biden's desk instead of mcconnell's  - slow progress under biden bs inmediate fascism if trump stays in office
You're repeating 2016.  Endorsing Biden then when he loses they will blame you and say you didn't do enough.   Pack your bags up for neoliberal centrists please. Just because Trump is worse doesn't mean you have to settle.   You wouldn't want your grandkids to settle..
Here's my honest answer man. I don't care about Biden's cognitive abilities. They could wheel him out Weekend-at-Bernie's-style and I'm still voting for him.

I never said anything about supporting Biden! And it is said that only the left is radical, judging by some of these comments including yours, you guys on the right proved me wrong!
You're right there Biden because you'll never be president
Fine, sky high profits for health insurance companies it is, then.  Biden's pushing 78 himself, so hopefully his VP pick will be younger and can pick up the slack when his gaffes are no longer defensible.  It's hard to imagine someone almost 80 running ship, Biden or Bernie.
He has disappeared from the public eye as the first openly gay closeted GOP.  A perfectly divisive running mate for Mr Biden, particularly after Joe doubled down against M4A during a fucking pandemic.
Why would anyone donate to either of these 2? Biden is funded by billionaires, why you trying to take money from regular normal people?
OMG!  This is scariest day of my life.  This is truly a #shitshow2020 #Biden #VoteBidenToSaveAmerica
What happens to this information when Biden is elected?
Meh, probably nothing substantial.  Personally, I'm still expecting a last minute endorsement of Mr Buttigieg by Mr Biden.  It would be perfectly tone-deaf and out of touch with the electorate, so largely spot on for his campaign.
Of course, clean up time by Biden. How much of his time.
How can Biden have an aggressive ckimate plan when he owned by climate denying billionaires. ü§î. There‚Äôs your answer.  They are lying. The Left must not work with the DNC. It must destroy the DNC after 5 years of Bernie kneecapping   #KillSmaug
Nice try...it's not going to look like that until AFTER Biden gets elected. FAKE NEWS!!!
is it bad that i find myself mixing up joe biden and bill clinton quite often. they both suck
Must be nice to live such a privileged existence. I didn't have healthcare under Obama, I don't have healthcare under Trump, and I won't have healthcare under Biden but enjoy your future brunches, bro. Just remember the people serving you won't have that luxury.
I will proudly vote by mail for Joe Biden. #WeWillVote
Biden voters are too thick, propagandized or establishment embedded to grasp that he‚Äôs a puppet &amp;  they are really voting Hillary as stealth POTUS. That‚Äôs why his losing is good (DNC controlled opp dies). The Left can then   fight/defeat GOP. His winning assured climate collapse
I don‚Äôt give a fuck if Joe Biden is winning by 99% I‚Äôm still gonna vote and encourage people to vote like he‚Äôs losing because I will absolutely not go another 4 years of this
nothing in his tweet was about Joe Biden.. it's about #AllofUs..
Did you see Trump's 'Trojan Horse' ad on Joe Biden?  Neither did anyone else.  Meanwhile, whenever a new anti-Trump ad from The Lincoln Project or MeidasTouch hits the net, it goes instantly viral.  Trump's minions can 'review and fine-tune' all they want; it won't do any good.
Exactly. Biden 2020. The choice is clear. Crystal clear.
I am old enough to remember when Biden wanted people voting in the Wisconsin primary during the pandemic.
Obama/Biden plotted a coup attempt, seems newsy.
‚ÄúMark my words,‚Äù Biden said at a fundraiser. ‚ÄúI think he is going to try to kick back the election somehow; come up with some rationale why it can't be held."
From a human who reads and is on the ground in Portland ... prepare yourself for tRump getting 4 more years. Don't get mad at me. If üí© don't radically change in 95 days prepare yourself for a shock.  And I'd lay my life down to get Biden into office &amp; I'm not a fan.
I mean, people are all "where's Biden hidin' hahaha", and I'm like - frankly? I don't give a shit. He's not embarrassing us, he's released some awesome plans, and...yeah. I'm good.
The second one I‚Äôve seen in the wild, first was a ‚ÄúFirefighters for Biden‚Äù one. That ‚ÄúSettle for Biden‚Äù joke campaign might become a reality, very much enthusiasm here against Trump, more so than enthusiastic support of Biden
This looks like a recent photo based on Biden‚Äôs hair style and skin tone.
Biden cannot think straight, the Democrats will use him like a puppet. #ChangeMyMind
The diff here is that Biden will listen to doctors &amp; scientists. When it‚Äôs safe to reopen schools he will. Your dad in law just decided it was safe to send kids to school, but not to have the Repub convention. So it‚Äôs ok to kill kids but not old white guys who are supporters?
Who's left to vote for Biden? Serious question.
I think people are sufficiently fed up with Trump that they will vote for a bag of potatoes with a mustache instead of him, but I also think a lot of the problems happening right now with police and whatnot will not magically cease once biden is in power.
As a Democrat, Biden was also not my first choice, but we‚Äôve got to start pulling our country back together.  No more division, we need to stand as one!!!!!
Uh. I think you are the confused one here. Biden just said he would INCREASE police funding.
Any plans to apologize to Biden? Or do you lack the spine necessary to do so?
When is that gonna start?  Oh yeah, on January 20, 2021 when President Biden moves in.
Look, Biden is the least worst. We know that. This is that decision you melodramatically said every decision before was. You are going to have to choose between ‚Äúhe sucks‚Äù and ‚Äúhe is a fascist and we‚Äôre well on our way to a dictatorship.‚Äù
A Biden presidency has to undo literally Every Single Thing this administration and it‚Äôs smarmy bagmen like Ajit Pai have touched.
Just got $10,000 from Soros this month to post in support of the communist Joe Biden
I agree.  Biden should not get so close cause we don‚Äôt know his intentions.  It‚Äôs weird to kiss and smell people.  I touch peoples arms and hug them but I‚Äôm a woman.
Trump v Biden  Is actually  Fascism v America
Have it prepared as a protest OR a celebration if Biden wins. Same people would go.
via   WILL TRUMP START FOAMING AT THE MOUTH NEXT WEEK?
Okay folks, if you're concerned that trump won't give up his office when Joe Biden wins in November get involved.  There are people already working on it.
This unintentionally says so much about who Joe Biden will be president for.  If Trump's tweets have been worrying you, you are completely divorced from the lived reality of average Americans, some 30 million of whom are facing eviction in the next few months.
What gets me is how the deadenders constantly talk about how we want to murder poor people, but when you point out that voting for Biden would extend Medicaid to millions &amp; reelecting Trump would make people lose healthcare they do not give a single fuck. ‚ÄúNot me? Who cares!‚Äù
Surveilling U.S. citizens in the line of duty and fully within their constitutional rights. This is how fascism comes to America.   The Department of Homeland Security needs to be dismantled in the Biden Administration.
I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôre trolls. I legitimately think many Biden supporters have come unglued from reality. The brunch liberals are probably the population least prepared for a revolution. They are not mentally prepared for what‚Äôs happening.
Text TRUMP to 88022! I stand with
It‚Äôs too little, too late. This evil clown show has been on for years &amp; Hurd supported it. It was apparent Trump mishandled Covid from the start. Now we have over 150,000 dead, people‚Äôs lives have blown up, kids can‚Äôt go to school &amp; Hurd ‚Äúmight‚Äù not vote for him? Worthless POS.
Voting is definitely not enough. Want to help? Here are 16 ways you can:  #Biden2020
Just that people interested in PR have to start with score/approval voting first to end duopoly. They have the cart/horse backwards. That's all. I'm voting for Biden and working on voting reform in the meantime, because I'm not a nihilist.
Biden Obama ticket and then Biden retires Obama becomes Potus again and chooses Susan Rice as VP???  Kamala Harris AG and Warren Senate Majority? Duckworth as Secretary of State? All other Dem Presidential candidates with places in the Admin??? My dick got hard...
You are hardly making any sense at this point.  I think you're trying to do the whole, "if you don't vote Biden, you vote Trump," thing, which is not worth my time. If you don't believe in the power of individual vote, what's the point? Worry about the 30%+  people who don't vote
You are lying Biden has no trolls only trump does
Welcome to the ruling class. How can we upend the us gov senior center and revitalize our political system? I think Biden will be the last old white man I vote for. After that we need to sit down and take away some keys. THEY SHOULDNT BE DRIVING THE COUNTRY
He's an idiot. He scathingly excoriated Biden for even thinking that trump might want to postpone an election. But will he apologize to Biden? Not on a bet.
It looks to me like an uncompromising approach is working (i.e. Biden embracing tenets of the Green New Deal). I agree that the Left should claim more victories when we get them, but it's easy to be skeptical of Biden, who has been antagonistic to the Left for most of his career
Thank you for your speech today. It first moved me to tears, then it made me fired up to do all I can to help Joe Biden get elected. üíôüíôüíô
If you‚Äôre wondering this, there are some serious conceptual gaps about how dangerous a Biden win would be for conservatives.
You owe Biden an apology.
Did you apologize to Biden yet? ....I'll wait....
Shut up only yours in the white house is in jepordy when Biden wins Nov 3 ha ha ha ha
I respect your choice. I am voting for Biden, however. If Trump wins, 4 more years of GOP may run out the clock on our chances to avoid the worst effects of the climate &amp; habitat crises. That could mean many plants &amp; animals going extinct, including humans.
The fact that I thought the guy on the right was Biden shows that all old white men look the same
After a Joe Biden speech!üòÄ
They aren‚Äôt even tweeting at him. They are tweeting at progressives trying to convince us to ‚Äúsettle‚Äù but with apparently no real awareness of what‚Äôs actually wrong with Biden as a candidate.
I don't care what anyone says. I am Republican. But I really liked Barack.  My age, He gets it!!  In my opinion I thought he did a pretty good job as President. He knows!!  Biden is going to need all the help I can get. I feel sorry for Joe he should have retired!
Vote for Biden.
No bc remember all those times Trump kissed Xi's ass? Biden never did that. You're lying. Your party will lose in embarrassing fashion. Let me know when you guys figure out who you are.
please screw off with your two party oligarchs. Im not voting for rapist trump and im not voting for sexual assaulter biden.    and the  are my option.  AND MY VOTE FOR THEM IS A VOTE FOR THEM ONLY.     MY VOTE MY CHOICE!!!
Guess Biden's speeches are the replacement for stand-up comedy?
He presents as a person with a stutter problem who is not always good with the anecdotes. My question is when was this take? Biden is willing to learn
Not happy about this, it‚Äôs nerdy and shows his flawed sense of story telling and his unfortunate stutter problem. But Im still voting for Biden.
I see young kids, who don't remember Byrd very well, showing pictures of Biden with Byrd in the 90s or early 2000s and condemning Biden for doing the photos I say, "Actually, by that time Byrd was much better on race than Biden and shouldn't have had his picture taken with Joe.
Biden's plan good, it just makes Sanders pragmatic, and frankly it's hard for me to look at that without feeling like he and the rest of the "unity commission" got played.
Love it when people reply to my threads, and then immediately block me.  There is video of Biden proposing cuts on the senate floor, fuck off with this nonsense, Politifact is a hack website.   And yeah Bernie is a mensch, he'd rather get something than nothing, that doesn't make

Yes you do, but sadly the Canadian People's Party (I was sparring with a Canadian Biden troll) is more like Donald Trump.
A call to action      #blacklivesmatter #JoeBiden
We already had that shot in the primaries. ~5m more people went for Biden for Bernie, and about the same amount went for centrists over progressives. Primarily Black voters, at that.  Biden‚Äôs already indicated several times he knows he‚Äôs a bridge and won‚Äôt see a 2nd term
Suburbs for Biden
If Biden isn't capable of campaigning it sends the clear message he won't be able to run the country either. It then also sends the clear message a vote for Biden is a vote for a return to the Obama years! They can't win ethically so they're resorting to manipulating the system!
Indeed, Biden will win by a landslide, indisputable
Another reason to vote for Biden.

‚ÄúSomeone in the Biden camp did something really dumb. But white men can‚Äôt be dumb so obviously it is from the Harris camp instead bc women are evil! I will never question my thinking process.‚Äù
And, while I've mostly tried to stick to basic, verifiable facts in this thread, I will freely admit that I'm biased. I support Biden but he wasn't my first choice -- I supported Elizabeth Warren initially (&amp; still hope he picks her for VP). /17
So, on January 20, 2021 at, say 12:01 ET, can President Biden just issue one blanket executive order reversing every disastrous Trump order; just get ride of them all in one fell swoop? #RidinWithBiden
I have never understood this.   Alt-45 supporters who comment on Biden's physical health, mental fitness, or relationship to women are NOT doing so honestly, given that for every example they give of Biden there's at least 2 dozen you can give for the #Tre45onWeasel /16
Joe Biden has tried to cut Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security at least five separate times.   His coronavirus healthcare plan is best described as a giant giveaway to the insurance industry.
Joe Biden has tried to cut Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security at least five separate times.   His coronavirus healthcare plan is best described as a giant giveaway to the insurance industry.  You do not have to help him carry water on this subject.
Lol He did not.He been warring about this.Funny how you always take what other say about trump and try and turn it on others.Clip did not even have him say it.Trump fired the CVC Obama and Biden put in place to stop this kinda stuff.Trump said there one or two case and it go away
blm isn't a democrat org they dont give af about biden or msnbc  or this partisan nonsense  herman cain advocated that people not take corona seriously, something that disproportionately effects black people.
No. Dear god please no. Biden better pick a person of color. Most preferable is an African American woman. My vote goes to Kamala. She‚Äôs the answer.
Mmmm... Actual patriots are gonna vote for Biden this year, Binky.

Biden is nothing like FDR. The only comparison is to rising to the challenge in a moment of crisis, similar to what FDR dealt with in 1933.
Joe Biden was hoopin and hollerin to do war in Iraq so it's unclear to me how that would be true when both capitalist parties have the same foreign policy.
Biden is not in any way a perfect candidate &amp; criticisms can be made. For one, he's what we call "touchy-feely" -- he touches people when he's talking to them, especially women. This is not the same thing as sexual harassment as it's not intentionally sexual in nature but can /12
vote by mail here but Alt-45 is claiming it's prone to fraud - despite voting by mail himself via absentee ballot. (Note: I live in a state that's been 100% vote by mail for over 20 years. We have no problems with fraud - nor do any of the other VbM states)  Back to Biden /11
While I would DEFINITELY vote for a Biden-Harris ticket; I believe Joe would be better off with a running mate from the Midwest or the South. IMHO, Kamala would be a better choice for Attorney General!
I'm not the one using Biden as a barometer for whether or not masks help reduce the spread of covid in situations where there isnt any social distancing.  There is no conflict to what I am saying.   I'm saying be safe.  Wear a mask when you're around people.
If he had a health problem, he wouldn‚Äôt lie about it like your daddy. Biden would be forthright like RBG
Or he can just hide in the bunker and Joe Biden can lock him in instead of waiting to lock him up.
I'm not going to laugh at the absolute desperate stupidity of the whole Biden pedophile thing amongst idiot Republicans projecting their subconscious knowledge that Trump IS PROBABLY A PEDOPHILE. Because pedophilia is not a laughing matter.  You belittle its horrific importance.
The IRL non-Twitter left is already locked for Biden bc they recognize the existential fascist threat that Trump is, and gaining disaffected R‚Äôs is the pertinent move  And his point is that any one party holding all the power for a long time generally turns out bad, which is true
A reminder that Biden isn't even pretending to hit the targets scientists have said are non negotiable.   This hellscape is our future, and it's going to get worse.   Maybe I should start working on climate controlled PPE as a means of embracing the suck.
The only thing Biden will do good at is forgetting that he‚Äôs president..
True, but your next tweet be jerking off Joe Biden who can't even do that.
I would take Pelosi over Biden.

Biden might win the presidency regardless, but a true progressive party platform *this* year would likely result in loss of the Senate (this year heavily favors R‚Äôs) and House (still gerrymandered heavily in their favor)  the ‚Äò22 mid terms will be an entirely different story

Smarter than Trump. Handsomer than Biden. #VotePeeWee
Considering it sounds like biden wants to put me and my friends in prison i think some of us might care.  And you might care that some of us might be actively on the ground at BLM protests telling our friends and allies that biden agrees with trump about protestors.
Skew so much towards right to the point that most of the population doesn't have an accurate idea of what real leftist politics look like- hence you see a lot of people claiming Biden's a socialist &amp; a communist as if they're the same thing. For extra fun, they'll also call /3
So, actual facts: Biden was Vice President for 8 years under Pres Obama, our first Black President. He was a US Senator for 38 years prior to that. He's left of center, policy-wise, but would be considered centrist just about anywhere else in the world, as US politics /2
Biden sucks too
Biden endorsement a forgone conclusion but having the t shirts pre-printed before the actual vote is quite a commitment to democracy
Well, for one thing, that's not even remotely an accurate representation of Biden. If you aren't familiar with US politics long term, it'd be near impossible to get an accurate picture of him from social media, when tends to amplify conspiracy theories &amp; partisan bs. /1
Biden having the nomination wrapped up as early as he did while more than likely selecting his running mate in august is such a stupid move. If he had selected earlier he could‚Äôve had more time for damage control for internal dissent. Now we get to watch K-hive burn it down

Like voting ever got us anything but the likes of #Trump and #Biden to choose from.
We do need a new people's party, but I am going to cast my vote for Biden to try to ensure that humanity has a chance to build that party.

How a VP with law enforcement experience could help Biden win over moderate voters | PBS NewsHour
Ya'll say we are the violent ones. When biden wins I have a feeling we might see who the real violent ones are. I don't know if ya'll remember El paso, 23 dead? BLM/ANTIFA doesn't have anywhere near those numbers in their whole existence.
And frankly, this goes for the incoming Biden administration as well, not coming in with a giant day one omnibus bill and ramming it through is bad politics, but neither Obama nor Biden have ever intended to govern for the people, but for corporations.
One of the chief complaints is that making concessions and reaching out has almost entirely been toward the right, and we have no expectation that that will change. Any VP pick acceptable to the left would stand directly opposed most of to Biden's agenda. So realistically, no.
But dont worry Folks. Dementia Joe Biden woke up this morning and was able to remember he &amp; his wife's name without so much as a Hint being offered from his team this time. When asked his favorite Jello flavor. BAM !  He answered immediately !    JOE'S BACK !
I love Obama, and he was a very consequential president, yet as far as accomplisments go, I believe FDR is still this country‚Äôs most tranformational president. Circumstances made him transformative. If we prevail, perhaps Biden will do the same in this critical time for the USA.
This is good, refusing to campaign for Biden, or even saying that you will vote for him until he at least pretends to support Medicare For All would be better.
Biden will arrest us and shoot at us just the same
There is a group of people that feel like America was perfect before Trump got elected. If Biden wins the thing that will change most if Don Lemon won't have mental breakdowns every day.
Trump Floats Delaying The Election. &lt; Remember a couple months ago when Biden said Trump would probably try to delay the election rather than risk losing? Trump and his enablers all accused Biden of being crazy for saying that.
I get it. What are we supposed to do to advance progressiveness with Trump? Is he more amenable than Biden? Is keeping what we have now, in the House and Senate, enough to advance these policies?
Please reconcile this with all of your tweets about the Biden "unity" group telling progressives to fuck off on every single policy agenda item.
I love that you cite Biden‚Äôs political career and then claim he‚Äôs a socialist? Like he is absolutely not a socialist. He doesn‚Äôt even support Medicare for all.
biden agrees with clinton
she has been suspiciously quiet about biden üòùüòù

Trump is, as always, only thinking about himself, but Mitch McConnell is thinking about four years of denying Joe Biden a single Supreme Court seat because he was not ‚Äúlegitimately elected‚Äù
If I were potus I would vote for biden thru the mail to prove that it can be exploited
I feel like the biggest danger is from other elected Republicans also chasing that power high and trying to preemptively gin up some fake voting crisis to invalidate their state results after the fact to give themselves cover for refusing to treat Biden as legitimate
"Even if Biden is guilty, he's still much better than Trump. So I believe Tara Reade but I'm voting for Biden."
I'm not happy about Biden, I'm just happy that you'll be disappointed with the results. And there's a different between leftist and liberal, most leftist hate biden just as much.
Joe Biden will always be my first choice in stagnating, not worsening, our current political climate.

More BULLSHIT. Get Us #MedicareForAll or #GetFired2020!!!  An employer-focused public option offers Biden a path forward on health care

I‚Äôm definitely in Kamala‚Äôs corner!!                              Kamala Harris isn't 'too ambitious' to be Biden's VP. We know what the real problem is | The Independent
Biden spokeman says not confronting Putin on the intelligence was part of ‚Äúan indefensible pattern of Donald Trump weakening the United States in the world in a manner that no American president ever has before, and it‚Äôs absolutely despicable.‚Äù
For fucks sake. Pathetic and evil. Wow.  And it‚Äôs pretty damn likely Biden will destroy trump. I‚Äôm saying this as a liberal who thought trump would win in 16. Everyone I know thought I was crazy. Now I predict the opposite. The only way trump can win is by cheating.
The economy is down 9% this year under trumps watch. He spent more then 3b on a wall that isn‚Äôt complete. He rolled back environmental protections, so energy jobs. Biden promised an energy directive in his vp and has been fighting for it ever since.

She won the BLACK VOTE in the primary and the general, just like biden. Changing the subject is another thing you racists do. Bernie sanders lost because black voters rejected him twice. His racist base is why. You all spin conspiracies just like trumpers to pretend its not true
Excuses to diminish the force of our votes. Like always. Instead of accepting the reality that we rejected him twice, you have these layers of lies and propaganda to pretend it didn't happen and more to explain how hillary and biden won while pretending it wasn't OUR VOTES

Name one thing Biden has done for anyone except his dem cronies and his family.  Give examples. Are you trying to help your candidate? Then try to change people's minds. Not insult them.
Cherry picked polls isnt proof of votes. Votes are, and they DECISIVELY went for Biden in the primary in nearly every single state, in every single state among black voters. No where did bernie get more black votes than biden. But you all spin talking points to hide from it
i agree and it's really scary cuz trump sucks so bad. but every time biden is on camera i'm actually just anxious and freaked out.
Your belief that those are the only blacks who support biden is what makes you racist. Its a lie bernie people spread to make themselves feel like you arent the white supremacists everyone knows that you are
cnbc isnt rando and 538 had hillary clinton winning in 2016 so i think skepticism is healthy. biden's true believers should be phone banking and selling his clearly amazing policy platform of no m4a, no legal weed, aggreeing with bill bar on civil disobedience, annexing west bank
I find solace in knowing that if Biden is elected, this man will be advising every step of the way Well done, Mr President. Well done. üôèüèøüôèüèΩüôèüèª

Wow. If that's the best argument you can make, I'd hate to have you as an attorney - you yourself published Biden saying, "Mark my words: I think he is going to try to kick back the election somehow.." Get your story straight, dude. Biden didn't say Trump would unilaterally do it
Pretty weak half-measure. Automatic expungement is needed. Under this model most of the convictions will stick
Okie dokie. Well he doesn‚Äôt seem to think it was rigged since he‚Äôs working with the Biden campaign. Pretty sure if Bernie thought it was rigged against him he would be complaining instead of working with the Biden campaign. But whatevs that‚Äôs just me.

AP reporting that in a compromise with GOP Biden says we can delay elections just a week or two... "as a treat".
Biden's got more experience working with her than we do armchair quarterbacking.
Honestly I think he is right where he wants to be. Biden is playing the don't talk so I don't say something stupid which is working for him.  The polls set Trump about what he was with Hilary and Trump hasn't even actively started campaigning against is opposition.
+4 in Michigan is Hillary Clinton level and Trump will dump 50 zillion dollars there in September and have an army of people with flags and signs on their doors chomping at the bit to vote for him. I'm just saying I hope I get a phonecall soon or see a Biden person in public.
I don't agree. I don't think Biden feels this way, and I don't think he communicates in code. I think he is reaching out to those who might be the "law and order" folks in the GOP, but in a fair way. Not like Trump is doing.
Who  ??? Biden,  who's that  ?
Your term expires January 20th  at noon.  That day either Joe Biden or Namcy pelosi (if there is no election) will take power.  The Constitution is clear. No delay of election can save you.
Biden warned us. We've been here before. Learn from history, please.
With Biden the US might end up like the rest of the world did without the economic near depression trump has put us in. The US is on course with other third world countries like Brazil! The USA is no longer the global leader and respected as a democracy!

Hey  when will you be publishing a column apologizing to the Biden campaign for this terrible take?
Remember way back in April when Biden said Trump would do EXACTLY this and was criticized by Republicans for saying so? They said Trump would never do such a thing. If those Republicans do not loudly and publicly rebuke him for this, know that they never will.

Exactly. They are actively closing ranks to defend him the way people actively closed ranks to defend Biden!
In Oregon where we‚Äôve had mail-in ballots for over 20 years, unless it‚Äôs a close race we‚Äôve never not known the results the night of the election.   Let me tell you, Biden is going to blow him away, so will know election Biden is the next president.
The constitution states that whoever wins the majority of appointed electors wins, even if all states don‚Äôt do that. So if R states don‚Äôt hold elections but D states do, then they will be effectively ceding the election and Biden would win
No, we the people are not this moron. Absentee ballot are no different than mail-in ballots. Both go through the mail.   He‚Äôs setting up the scernio of fraud ahead of the election so when Biden whips his ass, he can squeal fraud, like the pig he is.
Trump literally suggested this very thing today.    Biden was right. You‚Äôre a hack.
No Biden didn't denounce the China flight ban. Deaths lag cases by 3-4 weeks, so deaths are just starting in red states, like TX and FL are now setting daily death records. You don't seem to understand the pandemic but are quick to call names, such a typical trumper.
trumpf said it, so Biden is pointing that out. trumpf also said he'd show his taxes. Hold trumpf accountable or Shut Up.

Who fears ambitious black women? Biden's choices of black women r daunting. All of them r smarter than he is. Joe is a back slapping smiley kind of guy who effuses likeability. He needs a black ‚ôÄ to take the wheel. My 1st choice is Val Demings. I like the way she scares me.
Biden called this shit months ago and the trump lickers mocked him for it.
remember if trump was a woman every single person pestering you to vote for biden would consider him the greatest democrat president of all time

Just in case you are wondering why I am voting for Biden. He will leave when his term is up. We cannot let him continue to segregate our country‚Äôs basic principles. We must follow Bernie‚Äôs example and fight for someone we don‚Äôt know. This election we must remove a dictator.
I sure hope creepy ass Joe Biden becomes president

Biden saw this coming
Joe Biden often came to Oregon in the 80s on behalf of  As a teen, I heard him quote then from the hymn ‚ÄùOn Eagle‚Äôs Wings,‚Äù a hymn I‚Äôd hear him lift up at The White House Easter Breakfast years later. His faith his deep, rooted in Catholic social justice teachings.
Here‚Äôs another tweet where I say I will NEVER vote for Biden. Don‚Äôt let anyone pressure you to vote for anyone you don‚Äôt want to. Your vote is yours, and it counts no matter what they say.
I hope it doesn‚Äôt involve any fangirling for that Biden dude who‚Äôs been accused of sexually assaulting a woman
Only if we have a solid plan which fully compensates ppl more than $1200 to cover ten weeks locked down. Until then, why bother, it will be more of the same. We need Biden in hitting the ground running on this. Then we get control over it.
3 months ago, Joe Biden predicted that Pres. Trump would eventually try to delay the November election. ‚ÄúMark my words,‚Äù he told a fundraiser, ‚ÄúI think he is going to try to kick back the election somehow.‚Äù Conservatives exploded in outrage at the suggestion.  Biden Was Right.
via   GO PUBLIC. PLEASE, GO PUBLIC.  MAYBE WHEN THE TIME IS RIGHT.
It means uniting the left and stop playing around with centrists like Warren and RWers like Biden or pretending Democrats are somehow better than Republicans on working class issues
Unfortunately the corrupt dnc put up joe Biden. It‚Äôs a shame that‚Äôs who we gotta go with. Another corporate war monger but I guess he isn‚Äôt a fascist.
This is absurd.  Might as well give Biden credit for predicting rain in Portland.
Biden said "try," so if Trump fails it does not change whether Biden was right.
Ok, let‚Äôs narrow it down more. Do you agree that Biden is pro choice and Trump is anti abortion (at least when it comes to women he doesn‚Äôt personally impregnate)? ~76% of Americans support abortion rights. Conservative SCOTUS takes those away.
Hoping they have a spot for you in #Biden admin as Secretary of #Commerce.
"The contrast Joe Biden has to offer," Wear continued, is that he "isn't looking to see what faith can do for him. His life has been looking to see how he can serve out of, in part, a motivation of faith."
You‚Äôre aware that Biden is pro choice, was early advocate for gay marriage in Obama Admin., and separation of church and state is kind of the Democratic Party‚Äôs thing? It seems like you‚Äôre really missing the basics here. Maybe read this?
I‚Äôm sorry, but have you seen Biden? He wouldn‚Äôt last four years as a Walmart greeter, let alone as president of the United States.
Biden wants schools closed because teachers unions demanded it.
One simple reason you must vote Biden: RBG isn‚Äôt going to last another 4 years. If Trump picks her replacement, SCOTUS will be majority conservative for a generation. Say üëã to abortion rights, LGBTQ+ rights, separation of church/state, worker protections, and the ACA.
TOTAL AND COMPLETE VINDICATION!!!
Trump tweeted his election delay nonsense literally a minute after this came out. In the words of Joe Biden: ‚ÄúC‚Äômon folks!‚Äù
If I was Joe Biden, I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd choose a VP that made it look like Obama was the puppet master of the Biden administration. #SusanRice
I heard on a Pod that Biden has been having trouble picking a VP because none of his list ‚Äúcheck all the boxes‚Äù and he wants a relationship like he and Obama had. Have to assume that a list of strong, vocal women check every box but that last one.
Aged like milk. Biden actually looks‚Ä¶ smart?

Trump will ‚Äútry to distract‚Äù all the way till he declares the election a fraud and rejects the results at which point 1/5 of Americans will show up with long guns in the streets to prevent Biden from ‚Äústealing it‚Äù. The potential for violence is so real, nobody should dismiss this

he says words. they are disconnected from reality and then the media repeat the words and that gives them undeserved credence. stop reporting words. report the actions.   biden's response should be - Trump smears shit on himself in public and you respond as though he was sane.
Does anybody believe that kidnapping citizens in unmarked vehicles is going to stop under a president Biden? Bc I don't.
If Biden wins , he will not be the person running the country. It will be everyone around him. Biden is sick and his brain is dying. It is irresponsible for people to vote this man into office.

While Biden gives the appearance of caring what has he actually done for America? In reality he‚Äôs manipulative, arrogant, misguided, foolish, deceptive, corrupt &amp; in the pocket of the extreme left &amp; China. He pretends to be for the common man but is an elitist in sheep‚Äôs clothes.
He can not win.  He knows this.  His attempts to smear Biden have failed. #COVID19 is kicking  his ass, because he refuses to listen to the  experts. His only hope is to close post offices &amp; cheat like hell!

I would vote for a cat I saw today in my neighborhood at this point.  Yes, I'm voting for Biden. He's an actual human with empathy and intelligence.
While I greatly admire Kamala Harris and think she would be a GOOD Vice President, I believe she would better serve the Biden Administration as his Attorney General. Joe's Campaign would, IMHO, be much stronger if his VP nominee comes from either the Midwest or the South.
I was a Kamala Harris supporter from the moment she announced she was running for President; and I greatly admire her. The ONLY reason I do NOT think she should be Biden's VP nominee is because I believe his choice should be from either the Midwest or the South. #KamalaForAG
Biden says irreversible damage in 9 years, yet China pulled out with a 30 year lean. üòÇ
We would all be better off if Biden and Trump just dropped dead tomorrow.
Kamala Harris has withstood more than her share of sexist attacks, hard for me to say that's what this is when Biden has said his VP will be a woman. I think this is about her being a cop.
Ahh yes ol Joe ‚ÄúI got mad for being caught plagiarism and had to drop out so I pushed Thomas forward and attacked Anita Hill‚Äù Biden Solid Joe ‚ÄúI voted for Scalia and fought for segregation‚Äù Crow Biden
Exactly. Biden winning in this cycle would only signal to the Democrats that ‚Äúrunning against the devil‚Äù (title of a Rick Wilson book) is their winning strategy. And 2024 will be the same as or worse than 2020.
Any Biden Signs?
I totally agree with all of that. I just question how it all can be achieved with the GOP obstruction, voter suppression, foreign interference and trump hamstringing the USPS which is so crucial. For Biden and the Dems, the resources would have to be almost incalculable.
Biden is about as radical as a line dance at a retirement home, but you do you
You cannot win by subtraction. That‚Äôs a fools errand. Get everyone to hate you by being racist and idiotic. That is a recipe for a landslide by Biden. If Trump was confident he wouldn‚Äôt be trying all these dirty tricks.
Yes.  Sides have been drawn.  Trump's support has been holding steady at about 40% .  It's down from his avg of about 45% but close to his all time low.  Support is in the south but waning in his swing states in 2016.  MI, WI, MN are looking at Biden.   N-S again.
Biden/Warren MIGHT be ...it's a toss up!
I agree. Can't fault anyone. It's a terrible choice and I hate Biden to his core... But to me a presidential vote is a chess move, not a love letter. Biden appointments would be nowhere like Trump.
What about the Obama years makes you think that Biden wants to do ‚Äúbig things‚Äù?

The sign says, "Biden Works for Iowa." I'm guessing it was after the Iowa Caucuses. I suspect he had to be dragged out of his campaign office by an aide because he had a schedule to keep. He's replying to the reporter as if he had just lost Iowa. Just guessing, though.

Well... that Biden ad just wrote itself.
Biden would raise corp taxes in several ways:  1) Set the corporate tax rate at 28%, up from 21% 2) Increase taxes on US cos' foreign income  3) New minimum tax - in effect, anything cos did to drive their tax rates below 15% would be taken back
Biden has no patience for destructive people either.  He is not going to support anything violent.  You are so far out in left field it's just completely amusing.  Where do you dream up this stuff?  Must be rantings because you say you never sleep, that affects the mind you know.
I think Biden is what this country needs in 2021. The right has gone off the rails. They need to see that the left isn't the threat they've been led to believe. Getting the train back on the tracks will take experience, wisdom, and leadership. Biden has those qualities.
Won't relax until Biden is sworn in in January.

I understand your point, and  agree.  I'm just curious, given the constant attacks on Biden's health, will this be the first time the VP pick will have an effect on the electorate.    Interesting to see.
Wow, Biden will have to work hard to match that. Maybe Donnie Most and the bass player from Faster Pussycat are available?
Most elections I would agree.  But anyone, and I mean anyone, who thinks Biden could actually make it through 4 years, has a major screw loose.   If he's elected, whoever his VP choice is will be your President some day.  Most likely sooner than later.  So yes, it kind of matters

The problem is, if we want the GOP to really hit rock bottom we have to stop these Dems from shooting themselves in the foot with their base. If Biden keeps attacking protesters and resisting #MedicareForAll we‚Äôre going to see Black voters in Milwaukee stay home.

This is also true:  If anyone is still convinced Biden will save us from fascism, they should ask him why he tried to swing to Trump‚Äôs right condemning ‚Äúanarchists.‚Äù
I‚Äôm damned angry at establishment Dems for not even offering crumbs and mad at Biden for siding with fascist cops over antifascist protesters; but I still want to beat Trump!  So we need to support the delegates pledged not to vote for Biden unless he capitulates!
. is also ignoring that Joe Biden just gave a speech where he sided with the secret police and repeated Andy Ngo‚Äôs idiotic RW propaganda about anarchists. So Uncle Joe isn‚Äôt going to save us from the scary #OrangeTroll!
they are so extreme they nominated Joe Fn Biden as President....get the rats out
I doubt it. I'm sticking to my argument, you're getting creative trying to stick to your argument that supporting Biden is progressive.
That's right on the nose. Biden wants to better fund the cops. Bernie wants to pay them better and strengthen their unions, which are the core of the problem.  No one in office is sufficiently progressive on #Abolition, or even on properly defunding the police.
So am I. That's why I keep going after Biden even though people really don't want me to.
Yes, but Biden just said that we need to crack down harder on "anarchists and arsonists," so he wants to arrest the people getting their hands dirty fighting to save people.  He wants to get everyone back to the sidelines and let the world burn.
Joe Biden is likely to continue this federal crackdown on protesters after he's President, which means we need to keep the uprisings going to have a chance of surviving this.
I think so. But the Biden quote is interesting. It could just be boiler plate.
The trouble is, right now,  is so completely committed to supporting Biden that he's thoroughly uninterested in seeing constructive criticism of the Dem Party from anyone who says, "It isn't all Trump."  I know because he blocked me for this.
I bet you don't like it because you haven't given it early in the right dosages to see improvements. And if Obama/Biden were pushing it, I bet you'd be onboard?

Nope!  They are all traitors. Everything they say should be used against them in a court on law on Day 1 of the Biden presidency, provided they don't all flee to some Siberian Tropical Getaway.
Neither.  Biden wasn't for the public option until after he "won." He took it from Mayor Pete and Liz Warren.  Did exit polls show people voted for Biden because they thought he was for #MedicareForAll instead of a shitty ACA expansion?
No dude, you're fighting hard to get Trump elected again by not supporting the platform the American working class needs. You're going to quietly thank Biden for leading the charge against Trump and Biden will lose because he doesn't offer people anything, the same as Hillary.
I don't think so. I don't think the people protesting stop being mad at the cops because Biden wins. The real trick is keeping the uprisings going through the entire election cycle.

I get your reasoning... i think Trump was the ideal anti politician when he ran, but even if he is or isn't controlled by his enormous debts that we could debate on forever. He looks weak when he won't admit a mistake. I think going deep state is a little far fetched but Biden

After January 20th, Joe Biden will tear down that wall.
So  I think  rebutted your rebuttal without trying.  To win Black, brown, and progressive votes Biden is going to have to break up DHS and repeal the PATRIOT Act. How does John Kasich sell that?  Why would he?
The Harris/Biden debate moment is the strongest argument FOR Harris. It shows that she will be a voice of warning to Biden when he gets too close to a cliff he is not instinctively aware of. That is a valuable asset in a partner.
2/3  "Increasing turnout by Black and brown voters in swing states is indeed critical for a Biden victory. But the two strategies aren‚Äôt mutually exclusive."  -    Peter is repeating the most popular Dem phrase from 2017: "We can walk and chew gum at the same time."
ABC is Always the Biden Campaign...
"It isn‚Äôt clear if he‚Äôll officially endorse Joe Biden, but his presence at the convention is a very public repudiation of Trump."  -    John Kasich has been repudiating Trump at the top of his lungs since 2016. Why does it matter now?
What point Would it serve for Biden to go on Fox News only to be Attacked with vicious and fictitious propaganda and conspiracy theories that that network propagates
I think it's very likely that Rick Wilson is Biden's chief strategist by now.
Joe Biden thinks its 1957 too
Everyone should give that one a read, as well as the rebuttal published to please the Biden camp. The rebuttal really needs to be dragged too.
Need to get rid of the politicians who made it the way it is today like pelosi, biden, schumer, basically anyone who has been in politics over 20 yrs
On July 21st, Nation legal columnist  wrote this superb critique of the Biden camp's "suburban strategy" and their decision to invite John Kasich to the Dem convention.  He said there was no point to it. He was right.
He got beaten pretty badly, yes, and his sole constituency is centrist Dems and socially liberal Republicans who are already voting for Biden or have already left the GOP.
"If Kasich can pull potential Republican defectors to Biden, why not ask for his help?"  -    Because we're interested in social and economics justice and he's not, Peter. This take reveals the bankruptcy of the comfortable white "left."
A reminder that Biden and Harris supporters are both more upset about their debate exchange and the subsequent fallout than are either Biden or Harris.
A true friend tells you when you did something wrong. Harris did that.   A true friend listens to criticism from a true friend and learns from it. Biden did that.
This article hilights that some Biden supporters were more upset with Harris than Biden himself ever was.
The foreign policy associated with Biden they're focused on is concerning Ukraine and Hunter Biden.  RU misinformation.

Biden is a true raciest. He hates non whites. If he is elected we will be electing the first true raciest as President of the United States.
Dangerous over selling Biden's evident dementia.  If (a very big if) he shows up to debate Pres Trump &amp; sounds mostly coherent, many will ignore his dementia. Clintons were masters at setting expectations so low that just showing up was considered a win
Biden IS a Republican. I would expect this to happen.

Biden needs to either eliminate it or do some drastic restructuring. This is what some feared would/could happen when creating DHS.
Kamala Harris is only popular on twitter. She isn‚Äôt popular in real life.   Biden‚Äôs internal polling most likely supports this and the results of the Democratic primary clearly support this.
precisely. It's not like Joe Biden doesn't have name recognition.
Do you think Joe Biden doesn't have enough name recognition? One problem in the last election was that Hillary had too much name recognition. Kamala has Considerable name recognition. Just like Susan Rice. OTOH you make a good point.üëÄ
This is a poor metric to use.   Warren did the best out of everyone on Biden‚Äôs VP shortlist in the primary.   She did better than Kamala Harris who was so unpopular in her own home state that she polled in 5th place (tied w/ Gabbard) and had to drop out to avoid being embarrassed

By election day, everyone will know Biden's pick for VP is really the DNC's pick for de facto President (if not, President-in-fact when Biden is 25'd). That means it'lll be someone DNC leadership will be VERY comfortable having as President.  And that may well mean it'll be HRC.

Does Biden‚Äôs campaign really want more stuff like this?  It‚Äôs only occurring with Harris too.   Isn‚Äôt that interesting?   There‚Äôs like 5+ other Black women in contention for the VP job but the only social media controversies are related to her. Funny.
The amount of ~drama~ Kamala Harris has created surrounding the VP thing should be a red flag for Biden.
At least he is not a TRAITOR to his country, nor a RUSSIAN ASSET, as Trump is. BIDEN as CIC, would not allow our soliders to be murdered by Putin bounties w/o ordering an investigation. He would definitely retaliate against such an atrocity, not make excuses for Putin's actions!
Exactly!!! They want to keep us home, no school, crash the economy, submit to Anarchists, to get Biden elected.
‚ÄúBiden‚Äôs team is harboring resentment towards Kamala Harris, therefore she would be a great VP‚Äù
I agree. perhaps i do believe that running on law and order when we have a gestapo problem is bad optics, but if it makes you feel better im not voting for biden either. The honeymoon with the religious left is over
I like Warren, Harris, and Rice.  I think a pick like Colin Powell could have helped heal the country,  But Biden has my vote no matter what.
Also, Trump wants to define suburbans as "white" and ban all low-income housing projects in suburbs. Can we assume Biden disagrees?
I don't see Biden signing up for a second term so a VP should be considered for 2024 run for Pres. Come on. All politiins vievfir high
Dude we don‚Äôt need you. Go vote for Biden and the rest of the commies.
Biden couldn‚Äôt fix a martini, how do you expect him to fix the economy?
Everybody though Hillary would win and she just tried to glide through the election barely up by 2-3 points in most key states. Biden is still up, but not much traction despite how awful Trump is and getting worse each passing day
Blowing political phone surveyors' minds:  Q: On a scale of 1-100, how interested are you in the upcoming election? A: 100  Q: Which presidential candidate would you vote for in a race between Joe Biden and Donald Trump? A: I would not vote.  #JoJorgensen2020
I do not like Joe Biden. But if you need a difference between Biden and Trump it‚Äôs that Biden actually wants to govern the country. Will he do it well? Depends who you ask. But right now we‚Äôre managed by people who proudly, aggressively, do not know what the fuck they are doing
hasn‚Äôt biden said publicly he‚Äôll only serve one term? what does he expect his vp to do??
There are tons of reasons why Kamala Harris would be a disaster VP choice:  -mismanaged office while AG, Biden said she botched over 1,000+ cases  -flip flops on important issues: medicare, defense spending, etc  -her office tried to keep prisoners locked up for cheap labor
I would vote for kamala harris over joe biden, she talk like obama and can word her words in education way.
Since Biden is likely to be a one-term president, what's wrong with getting Harris ready to go?
To be clear, it would be crazy for Biden to want someone who *doesn't* want to be the post-Biden nominee - that's an important way to exercise his power. But I do think they have an unusually acute problem here in terms of incentives.
I think this is a huge difference. My assumption is that Biden does not see himself as necessarily a one-termer, but that his VP may well see him that way.
Wasn't one reason Obama picked Biden that they thought he was too old to spend his VP term scheming for a presidential run?
You are the Supreme agitator. You and the GOP have destroyed more of this country than any peaceful protesters.  Millions of jobs lost, over 150,000 Americans dead, and Biden will never get the greasy, clown-face make-up out of the Oval Office. Biden2020. #TrumpVirus
I don‚Äôt understand this question ü§î Joe Biden was the author of that bill. He championed it. Sanders voted for it but he didn‚Äôt center his career on it. Both obviously have some responsibility but it‚Äôs something that could be used as a cudgel against Biden more easily
This loyalty stuff is probably a cover for concerns about her record that Biden‚Äôs team doesn‚Äôt want to publicly bring up
Their goal isn‚Äôt to convince people to vote GOP, they just need to convince people not to vote for Biden. Trump‚Äôs campaign already has ads running in some states focused on Biden‚Äôs crime bill and how it affected Black communities. The goal is to make people stay home.
Being forced to vote for Biden..... Why do I feel so violated?
She is such a terrible candidate. This is the one good thing Biden‚Äôs team has  done
Trump will use Harris‚Äôs controversial record against her and against Biden
Why do Biden's aids always sound like a Hallmark greeting card when they tweet for him?
If the Federal Government didn't go to Portland last week there would haven't been a resurgence in the violence giving us actual footage of what America will look like under Biden. #TrumpThreatensAmerica  #TrumpIsALaughingStock #TrumpGestapo
My God!  He cannot even read a teleprompter anymore!  And wondering, is this a Biden ad...or a Trump ad?

I'm just pointing out there's no relief in sight for the problems that ail America. Yes, I hope Biden wins. He's a better human being &amp; a better POTUS. But he's still against #M4A, #BLM, #GND, #Legalization-- everything we really need. Either way, the riots must continue in 2021.
Biden won the nomination on perceived electability. Not because of his policies or his record.
I hope everyone knows a vote for Biden is a vote for Kamela Harris as well, a well known radical Attorney who would push out Biden ASAP allowing Pelosi to move into second place for The Predidency. A disaster for America!
I thinks it‚Äôs pure trump to do this since Biden will be selecting a woman VP. Haley has been sucking up big time as of late. Biden just needs to wait to announce his VP until after the RNC
I cringe with you! Can you imagine Biden at his first Press Conference? I wish Red Skelton was still alive, his parody of Biden would be hilarious!
biden wont do anything about the war against cities or the doj and its war against liberalism. hes just a place holder while we wait for another trump
I thought Joe Biden was a no brainer.
Think he has already, the guy is a step closer to Biden‚Äôs brain power as well.

Not surprising from Biden, but it is bracing to watch in real-time how Liberalism aides and abets the rise of fascism by cheering on state repression of radicals, militants, and anti-fascists.
I am right there with you sir as a pastor and a former city government official in Oregon I supported Donald Trump in 2016 but will not in 2020 Joe Biden has my full support
I'm already a follower! ü•≥ All the Resisters will make sure VP Biden is our next LEGITIMATE President! We will also see that the Trump Authoritarian regime is sent back to the same sewer gutter they crawled out of! We will make sure it is sealed so they never get out again!
Yep... Biden‚Äôs ahead:) NOT!
getting us out of the fascist toilet your former boss threw us in makes that an easy call for Biden
No, we really should not put her in a role where she has to do all the hard work and Biden and his VP (hopefully not Harris) takes the credit
Biden vows investment in Black-owned businesses as he unveils plan to fight systemic racism  #BuildBackBetter #racism
Currently we‚Äôre seeing a pattern of posts, which often pile on earlier posts that seek to normalize Donald by opining that both he and Joe Biden are unpalatable.  6/17
Fascism is when capitalism subverts the will of the electorate. It‚Äôs when corporate powers intertwine with governmental authority. The media blackout on Bernie was a glaring indicator. Biden‚Äôs 1994 crimebill is cringe AF. In non related news I‚Äôm old AF
Lmao what? The first time he made a video doing these phone calls to donors it was *with* Elizabeth Warren.  I know you‚Äôre a Biden supporter but don‚Äôt let your bias blind you to the facts
No one is claiming she invented it, but she did popularize it and Biden did adopt it from her
Publicizing the phone calls with videos on social media is a Warren thing. Obama didn‚Äôt do this, he didn‚Äôt turn it into an event in itself. Biden adoptee this from Warren
Biden discusses 'Build Back Better' plan  via    The Q&amp;A was very odd. As he reached for the pre-scripted list, he mumbled something like "this is what I'm supposed to do" on whose orders? For real ppl, who is pulling his strings? #democrats Jordan
Since Biden is using Elizabeth Warren‚Äôs grassroots tactics, her messaging, and her policies, then he should make her the VP.
I think the plans that Democrats have been working on are taking exactly that into account, and working on entrepreneurship, day care, education, etc. I thought Buttigieg's plan was comprehensive and promising, and Biden's been talking about the same direction.
For VP I like Rice for foreign policy smarts and overall cool (a trusted, moderate ear for Biden). Harris might serve most effectively as, I dunno, Attorney General? Who's gaming out the DEM candidate for prez in 2024 in these discussions? Not sure Rice would even want to run.
Exactly. We don't have to worry about Susan Rice and "Benghazi!!" because no matter who Biden throws up, The GOP smear machine will Besmirch.
Bernie's Aunt Tom still can't shut her mouth and stop trying to help Trump.  Many more people will proudly vote for Joe Biden than would have ever voted for your commie friend Bernie.
Why are you lying about Harris‚Äôs record?   Are you ashamed of it?  ‚ÄúHarris did directly prosecute marijuana cases as San Francisco district attorney from 2004 through 2010.‚Äù
Why are you lying about Harris‚Äôs record? Are you embarrassed?  ‚ÄúHarris did directly prosecute marijuana cases as San Francisco district attorney from 2004 through 2010.‚Äù
You'd think Biden would care enough about winning to adopt a policy that would help all Americans and give non-conservatives a reason to vote for his lame ass.
Elizabeth Warren would make the best Vice President because she would be able to push Joe Biden more left like she‚Äôs done already with him on: abortion, student loan forgiveness, social security benefits, bankruptcy, etc.    None of the other VP choices have pushed him left
Is the libertarian or Joe Biden more likely to win and get the Orange Cheeto out?

A new Democratic poll finds Joe Biden ahead in a district Trump won by 15 points four years ago
Biden emphasizes Trump's mishandling of COVID-19 in new ad campaign targeting older voters
Pointing out that Harris has been very flippant about her busing attack isn‚Äôt ‚Äúattacking‚Äù her.    The Trump campaign will use this as a cudgel against Joe Biden and it‚Äôs fair to inquire more about Harris‚Äôs motivations for launching this attack
You fit the bill, what if Biden turns around and makes you Veep?
Biden can't answer real questions!! He is Mentally Gone!!!
drop DONDA or we voting for Biden
The KHive (Kamala Harris zealots) are now threatening to not vote for Joe Biden if she isn‚Äôt on the ticket
Biden has cast a wide net for ideas; his campaign has talked with progressive Elizabeth Warren, liberal economists from the Obama administration, and ‚Äúevery Democratic think tank under the sun,‚Äù one Biden aide told Vox.
Why Biden‚Äôs V.P. Pick Could Cinch the 2020 Race | Vanity Fair  ‚ÄúI would argue that of all the Democrats who ran for president in this campaign, Warren became, over time, the most disciplined and highly skilled communicator of the bunch.‚Äù
Isn‚Äôt it interesting that people who say they‚Äôre promoting the Libertarian, Jo Jorgensen, are willing to ignore *everything* Donald has said for more than four decades and dust off one out of context quotation of Joe Biden from 1977?
Biden is wholly owned by the rich, so obviously he won't do a damn thing for the poor of this country.
Biden is no longer like this, while Trump is 1000 times worse, and that's just with race.  Trump is full blown evil while Biden is not.   If you can't tell that already then I will pray for you.
Dodd is old and out of touch.  Don't isten to him, Biden!
Kamala Harris supporters now suggesting they might not vote for Joe Biden in November if Harris isn‚Äôt on the ticket  Terrible. Why won‚Äôt  tell her supporters to tone down the toxic rhetoric?
GOOD! Dude, the "middle" is so far right at this point, people have forgotten where the middle is actually supposed to be. Eisenhower would be considered a "radical leftist" by today's GOP. Biden is farther right than Eisenhower was.
You are unbelievably delusional. YOU are the President now. Do you know that? The America you keep taking about President Biden giving us is the one YOU'VE given us RIGHT NOW. Dude, pull it together...it's just sad now.
Musky boy. You got it wrong sir. The left is winning the middle. Republican here, voting for Biden.
Kamala‚Äôs supporters have been smearing every other woman on Biden‚Äôs VP shortlist.   It‚Äôs disgusting and Harris and her husband give the KHive a wink &amp; a nod. ü§¢ü§Æ
We all know the plan if Biden gets elected. Beto goes for the guns, AOC goes for your tax dollars, Rashida Talib will lead foreign policy and the rest is history pal.
Biden should also ignore GOP op-ed writers like Jennifer Rubin who are constantly pushing centrist VP candidates
Karen Bass is 1000x better on Israel / Palestine compared to Harris  Kamala Harris co-sponsored legislation with the senate GOP to condemn the Obama-Biden administration because they criticized Israeli land grabs.  Terrible foreign policy record
If Harris‚Äôs record didn‚Äôt make Biden‚Äôs team nervous, nobody would be talking about Karen Bass right now.
We f*cked up. Big time. At least Biden has a somewhat-improved climate plan. It's a start, but, we're f*cked. We have wasted decades. #ClimateEmergency #Biden2020Landslide #Biden2020 #ClimateActionNow
Really no reason for Biden to rush either as he‚Äôs up in every poll.  VP is always made on how it can benefit the nominees chances so...
If it‚Äôs Wareen ‚Äî&gt; I will donate money and volunteer my times towards the Biden campaign  If it‚Äôs Bass ‚Äî&gt; I will donate to the Biden campaign   If it‚Äôs Harris ‚Äî&gt; I will feel very disappointed
Indeed. But as VP, Biden's route to presidential plausibility was to hug Obama as close as possible. That might not be the case for whoever Biden picks.
Even Biden has talked about this üòí
And Biden will most likely fix it.
Hard feelings about the debate is a really stupid reason not to pick Harris but loyalty seems a rational thing to worry about for Biden. Whoever he picks will prob spend the next 4 years prepping a primary campaign and trying to nudge Biden into not running again.
Respectfully VP Biden, slow down on the Bernie points. Please hold your briefings outside in your yard. I want you to be President. Please come out if the basement. They are holding all of this against you
#Biden should pick #Obama as his #Veep, then resign on January 21st. Talk about making America great again! Remember the Obama years? Robust economy, no pandemic, qualified people working in the White House...ahhh, the good old days
Biden up 7 in NC, 51-44, 5 in AZ, 50-45, up 12 in MI 52-40, Cook sees D control of US Senate likely
The Trump campaign is a cesspool of mismanagement, nepotism, grift, and idiocy
That‚Äôs bc we‚Äôre anti Trump, not pro Biden
Elizabeth Warren is the only person on Biden‚Äôs VP shortlist who has experience w/ handling a national economic crisis
everything makes me happy. like i just told biden it had to get this bad for people to wake up exactly this much. your problem is you are invested in making me unhappy.
This is kind of normal, though. Obama waited til Aug 23 to announce Biden; Hillary July 22 (the convention was 7/27). I know we are all anxious, but it'll happen as the campaign rolls out. There are reasons. Hope they're right!

But how will he overcome Biden‚Äôs strength with the only other crucial demographics, knitters and skateboarders (?)
Biden is the middle.
I totally agree about Hillary. But the Harris piece was part of one about ALL these women prospects. I didn't think any was a 'hit job.' Kamala was fully able to go after Biden in that debate. She was a prosecutor and AG. I am not too worried about her. She likely will be VP.
I just signed a  petition to  and  calling on them to include ending marijuana prohibition in their campaign platforms. Sign here:
It‚Äôs been 27 days since Joe Biden‚Äôs ‚Äúnurses‚Äù let him have a press conference.
But the slate of candidates is all women! A woman WILL win, because Biden is choosing one. I am a woman, and I support another choice, for good, (to me), reasons. I hate that, if Harris doesn't get the nod (and she probably will be chosen) many will frame it as stolen from her.
Biden is the other Trump
yep, I think that's about right, and I hope Joe Biden has some females on the vetting team
Kamala‚Äôs only response to being called out for hitting Biden over segregation and then supporting him enthusiastically now is repeating ‚Äúit was a debate‚Äù over and over again.   She has no principles. This is why people dislike politicians
Fear mongering. Obviously Biden is not against religion. Anyone that believes this should please do research and use common sense.
hes right of hillary and democrats pretended to beleive fox lies to get rid of hillary, it proives they are hipocrites that they would even consider biden. after that., Now they said clintoin wasnt liberal enouygh either they are nazis or they will give us someone liberal
I WISH he‚Äôd even COMPROMISE with us left-wingers!! Biden is as centrist as the country could ask for.
The best thing about being a Warren Democrat is that our support is 100% about policy. If Warren doesn‚Äôt get the VP job but Biden adopts even more of her policies we will consider it a success  Meanwhile this will be you-know-who‚Äôs supporters if she doesn‚Äôt get the VP job
Yes, so glad that you noticed.   Happening now in Dem Controlled Cities that will Vote Biden. That is why  said what he did.  Even though   deny what is going on.  Surprised that you needed an explanation.
You are correct about the "want Biden to win" part.
Now is a party compared to what he will do in the 77 days *after* he loses and Biden is installed. My teeth chatter at the thought of it.
YOU did this, not Biden.
I hope Joe Biden and other leaders are preparing for the worst case scenario. With Donald that seems to be what we always have to expect.
The one thing we DO NOT need is worthless identity politics.   What‚Äôs the point of having a Black female VP if she ends up supporting the exact same policies as Joe Biden?????  Give a progressive woman the VP job.
The KHive made a deal with a devil that Biden‚Äôs VP would be a woman of color  ...they should have been more specific!!!! üòù
magic plastic on the butt, who's the better of them all?  another $25 to the biden campaign. its day 100. maxing out is cheaper than emigrating.
Biden's path to the White House could hit a dead end on Facebook
Honestly I don't place much trust in Joe "Serial Liar" Biden.
I could be wrong of course, but it's the neoliberal playbook to keep chasing the right wing.  Who knows, though -- Biden might surprise us all &amp; choose Hillary f'n Clinton (which is the comedy option).   Gosh why does 2020 have to be the worst. Why can't things ever get better.
I doubt Biden can use it either
hold on a hot second what  is this person voting for Biden then
Biden's a compulsive liar.  He's gonna serve his donors' interests 100%  Proof that he's in politics just to sell out:
election is a sham, fbi picks the president and they are morons who love trump.If they allow racialist biden then he will do what they want, at least with trump the world sees what they really are a bunch of clowns
Hey, why don't you tell *Biden* to ~be like Bernie~, he'll get more votes that way.  Though the wiser of us will know Biden is lying through his teeth if he suddenly starts saying he's gonna ~be like Bernie~ bc Biden's track record is all conservative racist anti-worker bullshit.
In other words, 32% will vote for  and that‚Äôs his fans. Leaves a good 60% for  and margin for write-ins and people who have ZERO chance of being president. Don‚Äôt waste your votes people. Vote against Trump, vote Biden. Trump is killing America one by one.
Hillary led Trump by 5.7 in July '16 Biden leads Trump by 5.9 in July '20  Both numbers are an average of the major polls
Welcome to trump‚Äôs America. Stay in line or you will be beaten, and the judge said it‚Äôs okay. How many were pretty okay in Obama-Biden‚Äôs America?  trashed our great country-like he does with everything he‚Äôs given.

Wait until the debates.. Biden will implode.
I don't think a vote can be wasted if it matches your values. Biden doesn't support anything I do, so he does not get my vote. Neither does Trump. It's that simple, and anyone who doesn't think so is gaslighting you.
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
Joe has billionaire backers and his own donors, Bernie didn't take corporate money. Ergo Biden hasn't earned my donation or vote for that matter.
Appreciate the point you make about Biden's purpose as Vice-President. That he was there to comfort white conservatives worried about a Black President. He was never about a progressive agenda, he was (and is) the safe guy who assures us that nothing will substantially change.
Copy and paste this text and tweet it:  JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
If I lose my mind by Election Day then I will vote for Biden, but if my mind is alert,I will vote for Trump.  Now ...what did I do with my keys? ....Found em! Whew!

Biden has empathy, he listens to experts, not always the best thing, he wishes to ease human suffering. He has humility and admits mistakes. I'm  a great judge of character and i trust Joe to do the right thing, but if he strays, we gotta hold his feet to the fire
Biden should ask a progressive female Dem to be his VP running mate if he wants to tap into this large pool of donors who are wary of him  Having Kamala Harris be the VP will make these donors even more hesitant to donate
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.

Not to mention, Joe Biden has an actual name.  I really can‚Äôt take someone serious when they claim to have a better candidate, but they refuse to name them.
You oppose big government, big taxes, and big debt?  So who is the dream candidate you will support instead of Joe Biden?
Having a Warren in the VP role would put her in a position where she has more influence over Biden. I support Warren for the VP role because of her policies. Karen Bass supports *some* of the same policies.
thank you from a grateful Nation for everything you did &amp; are still doing for the ppl of America &amp; around the world. One of the best decisions you made was to choose  as our VP. We will pay it forward by electing VP Biden as our next   #VoteJoeBiden
January 20th either Joe Biden or Donald Trump will be sworn ito office. That‚Äôs just a fact.   I noticed that you mention both spending and the debt. Are you hoping to impose austerity in the midst of a pandemic?
I‚Äôm not surprised none of the management there took care of it either üò° fucking assholes. ‚ÄòThis is what you‚Äôll get voting for Biden.‚Äô No bitch, that‚Äôs what we get now with Trump! ü§¨üñïüèº

Idealist should all vote for Biden this election if they want Trump out of office. Voting for Jill was a mistake last time. It accomplished nothing.
Not voting for either Biden or Trump
Interesting. This person below says she will only volunteer and donate if Kamala Harris is the VP because ‚Äúthe VP must be a black woman‚Äù  Is the KHive even aware some of the other choices on Biden‚Äôs list are also Black?  Do they think Karen Bass is white?
I think you‚Äôre wrong on this one Kat...  America would look and become totally different under AOC‚Äôs hand puppet Biden
OK well based on this we need to shut down the country and the economy and make everyone stay in their closets‚Ä¶.until Joe Biden is elected of course.
In other words, I doubt we'd see Biden's current incredible swing state numbers under one of the more progressive nominees.
Yeah, I wasn't a Biden nominator, but I have to say the NeverTrump ex-GOPs love him. The All-In-On-Trump GOP is not persuadable but that's a shrinking base.
Knowing Biden‚Äôs most ardent supporters like you don‚Äôt give a shit about young people like me make me very feel discouraged about supporting him  Thanks!  I won‚Äôt be donating because of you
The reason Karen Bass is getting more attention from Biden‚Äôs team is because they realize the Left doesn‚Äôt trust Kamala Harris and her record is too controversial
Trump enablers...is it more important to vote republican and keep this sociopath in office, just to keep a republican in office, than to save your country and protect your fellow Americans. Vote for Joe Biden. Because after Nov. it will be too late to decide you made a mistake!
Noam Chomsky described Biden as empty, able to be swayed this direction or that. That‚Äôs how I feel about him, and if we can surround him with loud and strong progressives in the house and senate we might be able to do something.
Huh, that's funny, I'm looking forward to November 5th as the start of an era of good accomplishments and hopefully bipartisan cooperation as the new blue US Senate joins the House and President Biden to make america American again.
No, you are Pres ONLY because of Putin, the  successful Voter Suppression &amp; Gerrymandering efforts! Now that was REALLY a RIGGED ELECTION!! It WON'T happen again! Biden asked that Obama hold off on endorsement so he could prove he could win  nomination w/out it! HE DID!
here is an idea for a campaign advert: Just cropped photos of the top of the heads of Biden and Trump with the caption "America could really use a Whig right now".
That's going to last until Biden's hand is on the Bible.  As a matter of fact, it is going to get *way way* worse after the election until then.

I donated more than the max to Warren‚Äôs primary campaign and I‚Äôve been on the fence about donating to Biden‚Äôs campaign and your tweet convinced me **not** to do so  Think before you write anything that stupid again in the future
If you're not unhinged, you're either not paying attention, don't really care, or are wearing blinders! Even conservative George Will, among other Republicans, is going to vote for Biden. He has never voted for a Democrat in his life. Do any of these issues raise a red flag 4 U?
Biden is a Proven Racist!!!

Karen Bass rises as sleeper pick to be Biden's VP  ‚Äú...some of [Bass‚Äôs] personal qualities starkly contrast with [Kamala Harris]: that she‚Äôs persuasive but not flashy, and that she's trusted by progressives but still respected by Republicans.‚Äù
Karen Bass rises as sleeper pick to be Biden's VP - POLITICO  ‚ÄúKaren Bass is the anti-Kamala Harris.‚Äù üòå
Democrats must be getting paid by the Chinese, just like Joe Biden and Hunter Biden are!!!
Well, I guess you could listen to the other Joe Biden.
Members of Congress, including Sen. Elizabeth Warren, have proposed including such a bailout in larger Covid-19 relief packages ‚Äî but so far, nothing has passed.  Now Biden is making relief for child care centers part of his larger caregiving plan,
Not one. I've seen the "anyone but trump" signs, but the small print must say.. "EXCEPT BIDEN".  I live in a very blue-pill swallowing town, too.

I'm a Republican and I find you a tremendous traitor to our great country. For factional reasons, I don't believe anything you say. Be a man, and take some responsibility. I am voting Joe Biden all the way. In fact, I'm voting blue across the ballot. You are a disgrace to the US.
Another reason we don't need Biden
Thank you for this tweet.  It convinced me not to donate any $$$ to Joe Biden since my opinion doesn't matter.
‚ÄúBut remember, Kamala has simpatico with him on every foreign policy‚Äù  Kamala Harris literally voted against the largest international trade deal in the past 25 years. A deal that Joe Biden supported üòÇü§£
I accidentally saw one of Trump's fearful campaign propaganda ads. He says Biden will take away the police and make everybody unsafe. Trump is nothing but a warped fear monger and I hope he loses big in 2020

These are the same VP choices I would enthusiastically support:      If Biden chooses Harris, I will not donate to the campaign.  Absolutely not.  She has a lot of experience courting wealthy donors for $$$ I‚Äôm sure she‚Äôll be fine lol
Thanks for this‚Äî the next time Joe Biden sends me an email asking for money I will delete it since you said he doesn‚Äôt need our support
These are the same VP choices I would enthusiastically support:      If Biden chooses Harris, I will not donate to the campaign.  Absolutely not
yea democrats madeit clear they hate theleft and arent goingt left. I remember when people would have protested biden...nevermind. They are about to get some hard knnocks. Maybe when they wake up they be more  liberal. it worked in cartoons
see, i remember when biden voted against bussing. to me that means he was right of the pulitical bubble. The political bubble is far right of the popular center. so biden is conservative even for hard right conservatives. demoicrats need to run a liberal to get a liberal vote
Yes, sure Biden the corrupt liar senile dementia Alzheimer‚Äôs.... tomorrow for sure a I‚Äôm voting for Biden...watch me
That wasn't even Biden's voice,  it was Trump's!! His campaign is getting good at FALSE info in their ads. One ad featured a picture of UKRAINE protesters from 2014, they were insinuating it took place in America!
Trump will do nothing to mitigate COVID-19 American pandemic, Trump is determined to leave the worst possible situation for the Biden presidency.

No, this IS tRumps America right now! Stormtroopers assaulting peaceful marchers. Biden will lead America through our healing rebuilding of our democracy. Trump is killing us
In July 2016 Hillary led Trump by 5.7% in average of the polls   July 2020 Biden leads Trump by 5.9% average of the polls   Not too big of a worry
Fuck this noise, complacency in discourse is how fascism festers. Biden is already there, just nicer about it.
He's talking about what the house plant, I mean Biden, said.LMAO.  Chuck Ross, who will never get a real journalism job because of past racist authored blogs about blacks and whose followers are mainly QAnon cultists, has taken it upon himself to vet Biden's VP picks ...because they're black.
When Pew Research calls and you have to pretend to be a Biden Bro so you don‚Äôt get canceled.
I'm old enough to remember that when Obama picked Biden there was a huge flap in a lot of Dem circles. That noise went on until the convention was over and it was obvious that there was a chemistry between the two. This partnership is like a marriage. Same wavelength all day long
I have a feeling that Biden has a special important cabinet position for Liz Warren. Something to do with the economy.
Nor will President Biden as he has stated more times than you
Florida teen arrested in Twitter hack that hit Biden and Obama
No we don‚Äôt. I‚Äôm a Bernie voter and Biden has my vote just as Clinton did in 16. You‚Äôve killed 150,000 and tanked our economy. 95 days until we vote you out.
Until then please vote for  in 2020. If you don't vote, or don't vote Biden you are effectively voting for Trump.

It is about degrees. I hate Biden but I loathe Trump. I am leaning toward despising Biden but that still is a hair short of loathing. This is voting in America, for me.
Joe Biden‚Äôs tv commercial says he wants to keep Americans safe and healthy. So we can expect him to challenge his own platform committee forcefully on #MedicareForAll.  Right? ü§î
Biden will pick Kamala because she is the most prepared to be President and she will absolutely turn a VP debate into a SNL highlight film making Pence look so stupid. God I wouldn‚Äôt want to debate Kamala, she is a verbal assassin just ask Kavanaugh
Kamala is the most prepared to take the helm of the presidency. In many ways she would be a better choice than Biden himself.
Biden knows some people who like to stroke leg hair.
Here's my honest answer man. I don't care about Biden's cognitive abilities. They could wheel him out Weekend-at-Bernie's-style and I'm still voting for him.
Go hide in your basement with Biden.
Can someone make a Biden bumper sticker that says, ‚ÄúBiden: he doesn‚Äôt have rallies that‚Äôll kill you.‚Äù    Too soon?
I see young kids, who don't remember Byrd very well, showing pictures of Biden with Byrd in the 90s or early 2000s and condemning Biden for doing the photos I say, "Actually, by that time Byrd was much better on race than Biden and shouldn't have had his picture taken with Joe.

SAY NO TO JOE BIDEN NO GOOD FOR YOU DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH NOT JUST THE NEWS ON TV THEY SENSOR WHAT YOU SEE &amp; SHOW YOU WHAT THEY WANT YOU TO SEE NOT ALL OF WHAT YOU SHOULD BE SEEING AND KNOWING TRUST ME ON THAT.
Huh? You called Biden extreme and dangerous. That's not polite.
When Trump signs an EO declaring the election of Biden fraudulent and void, Sen. Lindsey Graham will say, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think that is a particular good idea.‚Äù

Democrats want to kill the economy, celebrate the Biden comeback.

Joe &amp; Dr. Jill Biden paid their respects but Trump has not.  Black &amp; Brown people remember this when you vote on Nov 03, 2020.  #HugeBlueTsunami2020 to vote out the corrupt/criminal GOP who allowed Trump's racist attacks &amp; dog whistles for four years.
Only if we have a solid plan which fully compensates ppl more than $1200 to cover ten weeks locked down. Until then, why bother, it will be more of the same. We need Biden in hitting the ground running on this. Then we get control over it.
It means uniting the left and stop playing around with centrists like Warren and RWers like Biden or pretending Democrats are somehow better than Republicans on working class issues
Biden wants schools closed because teachers unions demanded it.
Please settle for Biden this election
Joe &amp; Dr. Jill Biden paid their respects to Civil Right icon John Lewis but the Trump refused to.  Remember that Black &amp; Brown people when you vote on Nov 03, 2020!
After serving for 40+ years, NOW Joe Biden has the answers.
She is one GOP I do respect and admire.....but she isn‚Äôt on Biden‚Äôs short list.  At least I don‚Äôt think so.
Any Biden Signs?
This thread is worth reading. I hope Biden has a special seat picked out for her in his cabinet!
They are helping to save us from this orange nightmare. Biden 2020
Seriously, I will vote for Biden but I wish his tweets were less flights of fancy and more balls of steel. The middle ground has been obliterated by Drump, stop trying to appease everyone.
Mostly we ridiculed the task forces and said mean things about the Bernie people who participated.  Biden‚Äôs foreign policy is one of the reasons for that.
I'm pretty ambivalent to who Biden chooses for VP, but the case for Susan Rice is a strong one. Worth a listen.
If Biden let‚Äôs us. We‚Äôll see Dems lose seats on the same scale they did under Obama precisely to avoid that.
Democrat Biden says he will name running mate in first week of August
So the USA soldiers are leaving Germany for a six month vacation? They will be invited back come January when Biden takes office.
Sounds like a conspiracy theory to me ! Easy way to get Biden out the way ! Can some say ‚ÄúThe Clinton‚Äôs ‚Äú are involved! Lol üòÜ
Guys, just stop it. This is all part of my plan. Two years of Biden and Harris (with Obama helping them out), Biden steps down, two years of Harris, then four years of Harris.
Covid-19 will disappear, as if by magic, on Nov. 3rd if Biden wins. If Trump wins - no church, no school, masks required everywhere, no attendance at sports, social distancing, further destruction of the economy, until Jan. 21st, 2025.
It goes far beyond the President. People like Biden and Pelosi have no real understanding of radicalism either.
Maybe fired by President Biden come February
I support Medicare for All, actually. Don‚Äôt lump us all together. But we can‚Äôt even begin to work on getting it in place without Biden.
This is what we wake up to. As someone with a chronic illness, it terrifies me:  Biden is at least going to keep us from losing healthcare.
Will anyone ask Biden why he likes to smell little girls?
He was of course sitting with the Republicans yesterday. Could not have happened to a nicer guy.
The problem is, if we want the GOP to really hit rock bottom we have to stop these Dems from shooting themselves in the foot with their base. If Biden keeps attacking protesters and resisting #MedicareForAll we‚Äôre going to see Black voters in Milwaukee stay home.

We will President Biden.  Can we speed up the clock and get to 11.3.2020 already, I don‚Äôt know how much more of Donaldü§°ü§°ü§° I can take!
This is also true:  If anyone is still convinced Biden will save us from fascism, they should ask him why he tried to swing to Trump‚Äôs right condemning ‚Äúanarchists.‚Äù
I‚Äôm damned angry at establishment Dems for not even offering crumbs and mad at Biden for siding with fascist cops over antifascist protesters; but I still want to beat Trump!  So we need to support the delegates pledged not to vote for Biden unless he capitulates!
. is also ignoring that Joe Biden just gave a speech where he sided with the secret police and repeated Andy Ngo‚Äôs idiotic RW propaganda about anarchists. So Uncle Joe isn‚Äôt going to save us from the scary #OrangeTroll!
they are so extreme they nominated Joe Fn Biden as President....get the rats out
I doubt it. I'm sticking to my argument, you're getting creative trying to stick to your argument that supporting Biden is progressive.
That's right on the nose. Biden wants to better fund the cops. Bernie wants to pay them better and strengthen their unions, which are the core of the problem.  No one in office is sufficiently progressive on #Abolition, or even on properly defunding the police.
AG Barr may be the best man ever ! Barr 2024 for President. He‚Äôs got spank and spark ! Ask Biden about liers ? Taking money from China üá®üá≥ and the other foreign investments .?Trump 2020
So am I. That's why I keep going after Biden even though people really don't want me to.
Yes, but Biden just said that we need to crack down harder on "anarchists and arsonists," so he wants to arrest the people getting their hands dirty fighting to save people.  He wants to get everyone back to the sidelines and let the world burn.
Joe Biden is likely to continue this federal crackdown on protesters after he's President, which means we need to keep the uprisings going to have a chance of surviving this.
I think so. But the Biden quote is interesting. It could just be boiler plate.
The trouble is, right now,  is so completely committed to supporting Biden that he's thoroughly uninterested in seeing constructive criticism of the Dem Party from anyone who says, "It isn't all Trump."  I know because he blocked me for this.
I bet you don't like it because you haven't given it early in the right dosages to see improvements. And if Obama/Biden were pushing it, I bet you'd be onboard?
Biden campaign tells staff to delete TikTok from their phones.
Kamala Harris did what true friends do: they tell their friend when they did something wrong. And Biden responded as a true friend does by listening and correcting his approach on the issue.   Neither candidate is as upset about this as are their most ardent supporters.
Do you appreciate how mad Biden‚Äôs comment made people who are still suffering from the legacy of segregation? If you are going to ask for empathy, first try showing some.
Censorship is the Democrats answer to everything. Wait till Biden is President, Republicans will be silenced.

Nope!  They are all traitors. Everything they say should be used against them in a court on law on Day 1 of the Biden presidency, provided they don't all flee to some Siberian Tropical Getaway.
Neither.  Biden wasn't for the public option until after he "won." He took it from Mayor Pete and Liz Warren.  Did exit polls show people voted for Biden because they thought he was for #MedicareForAll instead of a shitty ACA expansion?
No dude, you're fighting hard to get Trump elected again by not supporting the platform the American working class needs. You're going to quietly thank Biden for leading the charge against Trump and Biden will lose because he doesn't offer people anything, the same as Hillary.
I don't think so. I don't think the people protesting stop being mad at the cops because Biden wins. The real trick is keeping the uprisings going through the entire election cycle.
Hidin‚Äô Biden has no memory of his previous beliefs.
Hidin‚Äô Biden has no clue, does what ‚Äú handlers‚Äù say.

How much of Dubya‚Äôs massive expansion of the NatSec state did Obama undo? Guantanamo Bay is still a prison. He signed the law that made what Trump is doing in #Portland legal until a judge says otherwise.  Does anyone think Biden will end this crackdown?

After January 20th, Joe Biden will tear down that wall.
So  I think  rebutted your rebuttal without trying.  To win Black, brown, and progressive votes Biden is going to have to break up DHS and repeal the PATRIOT Act. How does John Kasich sell that?  Why would he?
The Harris/Biden debate moment is the strongest argument FOR Harris. It shows that she will be a voice of warning to Biden when he gets too close to a cliff he is not instinctively aware of. That is a valuable asset in a partner.
2/3  "Increasing turnout by Black and brown voters in swing states is indeed critical for a Biden victory. But the two strategies aren‚Äôt mutually exclusive."  -    Peter is repeating the most popular Dem phrase from 2017: "We can walk and chew gum at the same time."
ABC is Always the Biden Campaign...
"It isn‚Äôt clear if he‚Äôll officially endorse Joe Biden, but his presence at the convention is a very public repudiation of Trump."  -    John Kasich has been repudiating Trump at the top of his lungs since 2016. Why does it matter now?
What point Would it serve for Biden to go on Fox News only to be Attacked with vicious and fictitious propaganda and conspiracy theories that that network propagates
I think it's very likely that Rick Wilson is Biden's chief strategist by now.
Joe Biden thinks its 1957 too
Everyone should give that one a read, as well as the rebuttal published to please the Biden camp. The rebuttal really needs to be dragged too.
Need to get rid of the politicians who made it the way it is today like pelosi, biden, schumer, basically anyone who has been in politics over 20 yrs
On July 21st, Nation legal columnist  wrote this superb critique of the Biden camp's "suburban strategy" and their decision to invite John Kasich to the Dem convention.  He said there was no point to it. He was right.
He got beaten pretty badly, yes, and his sole constituency is centrist Dems and socially liberal Republicans who are already voting for Biden or have already left the GOP.
"If Kasich can pull potential Republican defectors to Biden, why not ask for his help?"  -    Because we're interested in social and economics justice and he's not, Peter. This take reveals the bankruptcy of the comfortable white "left."
A reminder that Biden and Harris supporters are both more upset about their debate exchange and the subsequent fallout than are either Biden or Harris.
A true friend tells you when you did something wrong. Harris did that.   A true friend listens to criticism from a true friend and learns from it. Biden did that.
This article hilights that some Biden supporters were more upset with Harris than Biden himself ever was.
The foreign policy associated with Biden they're focused on is concerning Ukraine and Hunter Biden.  RU misinformation.

Can you imagine Biden, Harris and Obama in the same room trying to get us back on the right track!?! Then, after a couple years, Biden steps down and Harris finishes out strong and then wins 2024!?! 100 days.

Joe Biden is a man who is capable of personal growth despite his age, and if he surrounds himself with motivated, thoughtful, honest people who want him to succeed, he will stand and deliver for his country.

They'll find planted evidence pointing to Hunter Biden being the creator of the coronavirus.
He tanked both! Yes . That is quite a story to tell and Biden is telling it!
If the polling indicates that Biden won the popular election, the American people won't accept a fraudulent result form the Republicans.
Social Justice League is supporting Biden? Stunner!
Stop lying about Joe Biden. He‚Äôs not for defunding the police and you know it!
I have trouble believing Biden‚Äôs margin isn‚Äôt bigger.
He literally just stated that he turned down an interview with Biden before this happened, listening is really not that hard...
To clarify: Biden has my vote, and my hope is that the Democrats rise the challenge of history and bring this about on their own.
Bernie supporter now Rick? Jumping onto the train a little late. Can we expect you here in Portland at the next Antifa Board Meeting?  You realize that's an anti-Biden slogan?
I'm well aware. The question was rhetorical. Of course  is trying to co-opt something that has nothing to do with him. It's not like he was ever a Hillary or Biden supporter before Trump stopped hiring the GOP consultant class.
He reached the plate so success! Glad he could take a brief break and enjoy himself. Fun to see. Reflecting current administration wouldn‚Äôt understand the meaning of fun. How sad, sad for all of us. I‚Äôm ready for some feelings of joy and hope. Vote Biden
If Biden wants to win over progressives by using  to run interference he probably needs to start by convincing Bernie. Probably requires #MedicareForAll.
They‚Äôll use them as ammunition against Biden and anyone else who opposes Trump, but no, they don‚Äôt care.
There is no doubt that Harris is the most qualified and ready to take the mantle of the presidency on his short list. She is most ready to lead and by picking Harris Biden proves again that he is ready to lead too.
Anyone who is against Biden for accusations of pedophilia but still supports Trump is lying about why they are against Biden, because apparently pedophilia has nothing to do with it.

Why would you marginalize yourselves at this moment in history?  Why even ponder sending anything but a black woman to Washington as Biden's VP?  How many times do black American voters have to thanklessly save our asses?
Yep, yep, we're all expecting it.   Biden predicts that Trump will try to ‚Äòindirectly steal‚Äô the election
I live in the suburbs.    I will be voting Joe Biden for President.   Your a failure
I live in the suburbs. I am voting for Joe Biden for President.   Your a failure
I live in the suburbs. I am voting for Joe Biden for President. You are a failure  .
This fool forgets that Biden served as a be for eight years and we came through pretty damn good, then came a NY wantabee mob boss....
Biden's a barely blue John McCain apparently now incapable of not saying stupid shit about racism.
...that if trumps administration is having mothers physically beat up and gassed, and it looks horrible, bcuz it is horrible. And its what trumps people who are doingit, not Biden's people.
...blood that wont stop leaking from his head. The moms are there bcuz trump is using footage of this mess to scare folks, saying this is what Biden's America looks like. Except his trumps America, and with moms being gassed and beat up, it looks really bad. The point is...
That is yet another reason why Congress matters as much as the Presidency. Congress is sworn in the 9th (I think). That gives them eleven days to resolve any remaining disputes and validate the election results. Only then does Biden officially win and the clock starts ticking.3/3
The real danger we have is that the vote is close enough that a Republican Congress might have sufficient wiggle room to refuse to validate a Biden election. The Electoral college is not actually the final arbiter of the winner. 1/
I'm a woman in the suburbs and voting for Joe Biden. üëç
That moment you realize if Joe Biden was actually in office Portland would look nothing like this. What you see is a direct reaction to trump policy.
Biden says ‚Äòpeople‚Äô don‚Äôt make distinction between Chinese, other Asians while knocking Trump's China attacks    He‚Äôs so ignorant. I know the difference between chi-com folks and Taiwanese and honk Kong people. What a racist comment
Hey, grow up, Mr. Zero Credibility. Among other things, you claim Biden calls police the "enemy." What Biden said was that military operations by police turns them into enemy in some communities. Biden also said some funds should be "redirected." He never said "defund" police.
I know it's beneath Joe, but God what I wouldn't give to see Biden walk up to him and punch him in his smug face. Then repeat those words and walk off.
Why don't you stop posting on Twitter and go campaign? Oh wait...you screwed up so bad with Covid pandemic no one will let you do your rallies inn their state! Guess Biden will be able to say he's in office because of you. Hahaha.
The audacity of Biden wanting more Americans to actually have a shot at the American dream. Would hate for the ‚Äúpoors‚Äù to move into your neighborhoods. üôÑ
I am voting for Biden because:  Intelligence over Idiocy.  #ImVoting4BidenBecause
The author of this story is not exactly fair and balanced. She also wrote this and several other odious stories.
It's really hard to know what Joe Biden believes because of the unanswered questions about his cognition.
Now try to imagine what might come after Biden.
Better ‚Äúa Creeper‚Äù than a Rapist?  Don‚Äôt know how you folks can ‚Äúsquare a circle‚Äù by claiming Trump is more virtuous Biden.   Grab them by the pussy? How do you legitimize that?  Even worse, paid an Adult Porn Star $130,000 weeks before ‚Äò16 Election... and you‚Äôre good with that?We're not even asking for much. I'd even go hard for Biden if he said he supported "the concept of UBI" or EVEN just Emergency UBI. Not asking for much here. Give me something.
You know what, Biden wasn't my first choice, but I am supporting him 100%, and I will continue to do the same if picks a ham sandwich for a running mate. People need to focus and not forget the peril we are in.
If you say anything critical of Biden then you're telling people not to vote for him now. You didn't know Matt?
You're deluding yourself. Biden has said he'd veto M4A and he isn't even for emergency UBI.
Have you taken a look at Biden's record? Sounds like you haven't. This argument was about Biden and not Trump. I hate Trump and I think  Biden is slightly better but still bad. Both things can true. The world is full of grey.
Biden isn't for UBI. I support UBI candidates. Where's the disconnect? Biden isn't for single-payer healthcare. I support candidates that support that. Where's the disconnect?
Ironic because everything that I do has been to help down-ballot Yang Gang candidates since Yang dropped. Being critical of Biden isn't necessarily "trashing" and one can be critical while also supporting the down-ballot.
I have a feeling that Biden has a special important cabinet position for Liz Warren. Something to do with the economy.
Nor will President Biden as he has stated more times than you
Exactly! Also, we never liked establishment Democrats or why the hell would be have been Yang Gang? We want a smart savvy outsider and that's not Joe freaking Biden. He's more of the same. He won't even support Emergency UBI right now. That's pathetic.
And who did that? Both Democrats and Republicans. Lots of Biden's friends, too!
Dear #Resistance,  Please evict Trump from your head.  States run elections on the date set by Congress; the EC elects the President on the date set by Congress.  Trump's power is equal to Biden's (read: nonexistent) here.  Here's why he's floating this:
...and NOTHING about Trump or his campaign operation says "competence" to me.  He'll tweet about it, get bored, say he was treated unfairly, challenge some votes, blah blah blah.  But he doesn't have any more power than Biden does here.  Sorry.
Same. Tweets are the least of our damn problems. Biden needs to come out for UBI. At the very least emergency UBI. He's out of touch.
Little Gym Jordan should‚Äôve gone to work and stopped the team doctor from molesting all those kids at Thee Ohio State University. So will  ask a question today or just jack off to his own voice for another 5 minutes. Stop waisting the countries time Little Gym. #Biden
SAME.  I see Warren as having the stomach &amp; mind for the fight ahead, which Harris hasn't shown. The Biden administration can be diverse like America, but it needs to do so with personnel matched to their own best positions.
Biden is like the lowest common denominator for the Democratic Party and that's *still* a fucking huge improvement on Trump.
Go hide in your basement with Biden.
'Cheat-Sheet' Biden's 5 Simple Kamala Harris Talking Points Revealed
#MANA Make America Normal Again. Vote Joe Biden 2020.
Exactly James. I'm not going hard for Biden. I may vote for him while holding my nose but that's different than offering my support! No, thank you.  However, I'll likely vote for Mark Charles because he's at least pro-UBI and has better ideas to make things better.
Kamala Harris would literally be the worst person joe Biden could pick for a VP... like any chance at rallying all of the left behind him would just vanish
Biden called this shit months ago and the trump lickers mocked him for it.
Didn't Biden predict this?
Remember when Biden banned raves? lol good times jk that sucked.
Biden wants to protect ACA by giving larger tax credits and expanding Medicaid. This is fine but it won't solve the overall cost issue like single-payer would. His public option is a Medicare buy-in but no details listed anywhere.
Biden/Warren MIGHT be ...it's a toss up!
Also, Yang speaks highly of everyone and he would do the same for whoever the nominee ended up being. I don't understand why this is hard for everyone to understand. Biden is highly problematic. Look at his record. It should be obvious why I won't go hard for him.
Trust his instincts? Why are you acting like he's the only one supporting Joe Biden? Everyone is stumping for him. He's the Democratic nominee. It's not some radical position. Again, we are not the cult of Yang. I don't have to support Biden bc Yang does.
This thread is worth reading. I hope Biden has a special seat picked out for her in his cabinet!
Is the Burisma issue ever going to surface?  We have the poster boy for dementia, the Dem candidate Biden, on TV bragging about withholding a billion dollar loan to the Ukraine unless a prosecutor investigating his son‚Äôs company is fired? A quid pro quo, and do not let it die!
Sounds like a conspiracy theory to me ! Easy way to get Biden out the way ! Can some say ‚ÄúThe Clinton‚Äôs ‚Äú are involved! Lol üòÜ
This means Biden rallies are still happening üòú
Sadly, I think they're just trying to keep spirits up... by sharing anything we know showing Joe Biden *could* win.  Personally, if I were ever to hear someone say their vote wouldn't matter, I'd give them the long explanation, then the short explanation, then... üò†!
Covid-19 will disappear, as if by magic, on Nov. 3rd if Biden wins. If Trump wins - no church, no school, masks required everywhere, no attendance at sports, social distancing, further destruction of the economy, until Jan. 21st, 2025.
Ugh these ethical questions. Ok so I would probably put on my Biden 2020 cap (which I keep in my car) make sure my mask is snug &amp; help them. I would be nice &amp; polite so they understand that's who Democrats are. You?
My father died from complications stemming from dementia. As much as I do not like Biden (in a political sense), this is sad and I wouldn't wish this on anyone. Can we charge the campaign with elder abuse?
Question: how many GOP Senators will actually vote for Joe Biden to end this nightmare? I believe that some of them will.
Juan Wiliams says he‚Äôs not - and Juan knows, or so he thinks. Biden might as well be wearing a commie membership pin.
But yet you still won't vote for Joe Biden. You know it's a binary choice right?
That's absolutely not the only thing he's been spending his time on. I support his other causes wholeheartedly. I don't support Biden. I didn't sign any contract to do so. He did.
"That being said, a female vice president under Mr. Biden might well end up playing an enormous role in the future of the Dem. Party ‚Äî because of not only her own achievements but also the fact that, given his age, Mr. Biden would most likely be a 1-term president."
"...would remain incumbent on him to enable her to play more than a symbolic role in his administration ‚Äî a robust position along the lines Mr. Biden himself occupied under President Obama."  Women Can Have a Little Power, as a Treat
I'm not going to do either of those things. I'll vote for a third and better option like Mark Charles. I don't need to vote Biden. I'm in Oregon anyway.
Not me. Never was and never will be. Sorry not sorry. Why would I support someone like Yang and then go for Joe Biden? There are a lot of blue no matter who people in the Yang Gang, though. ü§∑
If he gets a presidential Day 1, Biden has a nearly endless list of ways to spend it
We're already in a crapload of trouble under Trump. Even Biden would be an improvement.
Warren is my top pick. At this point after what feels like an interminable wait, &amp; knowing how much vetting Biden et al have been doing, I leave it in his hands... No matter who. Am ready to start supporting a woman VP as his running mate!
Not news. For real. Just found out my kids aren‚Äôt back in school until at least November and we‚Äôre taking pictures of Biden‚Äôs talking points! (Read last bit loud like Toby Ziegler from West Wing).
Makes perfect sense. i donated LOADS to Bernie and will always be ZERO to Biden.
AG Barr may be the best man ever ! Barr 2024 for President. He‚Äôs got spank and spark ! Ask Biden about liers ? Taking money from China üá®üá≥ and the other foreign investments .?Trump 2020
Sky Sports Understands‚Ñ¢Ô∏è that the Biden campaign is vetting (someone).
üëâüëâüëâ15% of Sanders supporters will vote for Trump over Biden. - USA Today Poll
No, this is now -note it says it's an estimate of Biden's CURRENT standing in each state. This isn't a forecast. The model isn't out yet.
98 days till election 2020. Counting the days. Biden 2020.
Muting this conversation because some people can't stand it when I disagree with Andrew. We are bigger than one man people. We are a movement regardless of what Andrew does. I promise you that. I love him as much as anyone but I do not like Biden. Both can be true.
His campaign is so much more fun than Biden's No Malarkey lame show could ever be.  I'll never understand this.
"He said it‚Äôs 'more fun' to campaign for Biden than it was for himself."  Absolutely not Andrew! üò° It's 1000x more fun to campaign for you and you know it. üò≠ I hate 2020.
You save pictures of Biden on your phone? Nice!
I'm sorry, but will comments like this actually make a difference in November? Especially in a pandemic?
President Biden, tear down that wall!  #VoteJoeBiden2020  #VoteBidenToSaveAmerica
Genuinely curious, why keep commenting on the Bernie Bros? Bernie dropped out and endorsed Biden.
I will feel a lot better once Biden names her as his VP
Biden has been around my whole life. üòÇ I was there for the 1994 crime bill. Yet Democrats still want to say that I "didn't do my research"
Biden just needs to say nothing and do nothing and he'll win.
Yeah, the # of undecideds was a HUGE factor all over the place in 2016.  That, I think, is the kicker this year.  There are maybe 5% undecided this time around, and Biden is the challenger now...
There is always polling error - though often they cancel each other out - but there could be an error that favors Biden just as easily as it could favor Trump.
And this year shows that 4% isn't needed.  FL, PA, MI, and WI are all in the Biden+7 to +8 world and the national polls are at Biden+8.  This means that it'd take Trump getting down to Biden+1 or so for it to matter.
Right now the tipping-point-state polling averages are about 1 pt in Trump‚Äôs direction (Biden+7) as compared to the country (Biden+8).  That means that it‚Äôs need to be MUCH closer for the PV-EV issue to be relevant this time.
Copy and paste this text and tweet it:  JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
The consequentialist approach to political campaigning? Biden is no stirring figure to inspire us and their's no point in him pretending it. Trump provides all the inspiration needed.
And Biden only needs 3-4
Please copy and paste this tweet.   JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
Right and then the DNC puts up their candidate again. You also have to know that Democrats will get complacent with a Biden win. The top of the ticket is not the most important thing. We have to pass voting reform, democracy reform, and more or we are screwed.
Then what about 2024 when it's the lesser of two evils again? You know that it will be. They'll tell us next time again. You realize the next Trump could be 100x worse than Trump, right? If we don't fix the stranglehold of the duopoly then it doesn't matter if Biden wins or not.
i can beat biden off
And yet it is actually all happening in tRump's America. This is not Biden's America. As of yet there is no Biden's America. This is tRump's doing, its on his watch, so he make ads saying that it Biden's America. Because #TrumpIsALiar!
Holy shit, do you actually think this makes an argument against Biden?!?!  Educators in charge of the Department of Education. Oh the humanity!
once the votes are in in Nov &amp; Joe Biden is the President-elect, You need to march up to the WH &amp; demand that trump/pence resign. Let Nancy Pelosi guide us thru the last couple months so we can save American lives by getting Covid under control. Otherwise won't happen.
Trust. You nailed it. I really wouldn't trust a vaccine or therapeutics until President Biden oks it. In the meantime I take all my info from Dr. Fauci &amp; other experts outside of the gov't. Thank you for this. Btw love your Podcast!
He tanked both! Yes . That is quite a story to tell and Biden is telling it!
Biden &amp; Barry‚Äôs apologetic admin is disliked more than Trump‚Äôs ‚Äúbull in a china shop‚Äù presidency. Build Back Corruption means a return to the tax spending frenzy we endured for 8 years of Barry‚Äôs empty carpetbagger promises.
Also, checked her feed....  Having grown up in the South (although I left asap &amp; haven't lived there in almost 50 years), I recognize her type.  UGH.  Am even surprised she's voting for Biden, although that's a good thing.
Remember that, even in a Biden blowout, 35-40% of the United States still votes Trump.  That's...like 75M people.
Biden winning is not the victory we need. His administration must be held accountable more than any other or we lost BIGLY.
I'll hold you to that Tom. I have about 100 anti-Biden tweets saved ready to drop in 2021. He's honestly the worst pick for this moment.
Democrats in 2020: Don't say anything bad about Biden. We have to vote blue no matter who! Trump bad!  Democrats in 2021(assuming Biden wins): Don't say anything bad about Biden or you're a traitor! All is saved!   When will it be okay to hold Democrats accountable? ü§î
He reached the plate so success! Glad he could take a brief break and enjoy himself. Fun to see. Reflecting current administration wouldn‚Äôt understand the meaning of fun. How sad, sad for all of us. I‚Äôm ready for some feelings of joy and hope. Vote Biden
One could say the same of the Obama and Biden Admin in regards to #H1N1 response.  which prompted the movie #Contagion based on a #NovelVirus #MEV1 think man!
Another thing to put on the list of crap to fix in a Biden Administration. 103 days.
I believe you can find one in a Licoln Project ad or Joe Biden ad.
Right there with you!  It's not just the Fed Courthouse either. It's going on anywhere in the city. Unless you bend the knee, you can be openly attacked &amp; no one will interfere. They'll say "he's a racist" when one has an American flag on clothing or say you don't like Biden.
Biden/Cage 2020?
This fool forgets that Biden served as a be for eight years and we came through pretty damn good, then came a NY wantabee mob boss....
...that if trumps administration is having mothers physically beat up and gassed, and it looks horrible, bcuz it is horrible. And its what trumps people who are doingit, not Biden's people.
...blood that wont stop leaking from his head. The moms are there bcuz trump is using footage of this mess to scare folks, saying this is what Biden's America looks like. Except his trumps America, and with moms being gassed and beat up, it looks really bad. The point is...
Omg look out Biden going to  let black people move in next to you.  You should move fast!!!!   I hear North Korea has many of your same values and a great exchange rate
Why don't you stop posting on Twitter and go campaign? Oh wait...you screwed up so bad with Covid pandemic no one will let you do your rallies inn their state! Guess Biden will be able to say he's in office because of you. Hahaha.
Yeah, that's not just polling error.  AT BEST, you could MAYBE call this a 10-point swing in favor of Biden.  That's if you had a really, really skeptical view of polls.
Biden addressed the subject to the19 people who tuned into his internet live-streaming basement appearance this week. That's right, 19, 12 of whom were journalists and five were his staffers.
I don‚Äôt think too many buy into that framing that aren‚Äôt firmly in the Trump camp.  We‚Äôve had two months of protests, almost no one believes that we‚Äôre gonna go policeless, and Trump has lost ~2 pts on Biden since.  This has had time to sink in and his framing isn‚Äôt working.
Because, ‚ÄúHe is a fascist‚Äù.  While the Mayor was speaking the mob projected their demands on the wall above him. One demand was his resignation.    .... of interes: Joe Biden is also considered a fascist by these folks.  Welcome to OregonAfter Biden is inaugurated in January, we need an independent commission to investigate the Trump administration‚Äôs mismanagement of the coronavirus pandemic. Individuals‚Äîincluding Donald Trump and Jared Kushner‚Äîshould be held criminally liable for mass American death.
Good point. The Bush‚Äôs are probably voting for Biden, unforgivable knowing what we know now.
Kinda like Biden - if you aren't smart enough to follow the conversation, I can't help you...
Everyone wants a simple answer for everything. The answers are not simple. Biden elected hides the truth while Trump reveals it. You can‚Äôt vote for someone else to play the role of you having compassion and caring and hide behind that. We have to treat each other equally.
Obama/Biden plotted a coup attempt, seems newsy.
Surveilling U.S. citizens in the line of duty and fully within their constitutional rights. This is how fascism comes to America.   The Department of Homeland Security needs to be dismantled in the Biden Administration.
Patience never visited me with this stupid.
Biden saw this coming
A Republic, if you can keep it.  NYTimes
I concur. There are more qualified candidates for VP. Harris would be a great AG.
I got a $1,200 class action check for Safeway last year. I didn't even file for it. Maybe I win .... üòÇ
Great points. Absolutley no reason to take Obama/Biden out of the investigation.
Biden's notes suggest Kamala Harris may be his chosen running mate: reports
I have suffered worse political traumas (cough *2016*) than having to vote for Joe Biden AND an eminently qualified woman VP. That said, I hope with my SOUL he picks Kamala Harris.
‚ÄòIt's absolutely serious‚Äô: Susan Rice vaults to the top of the VP heap
Wait, Biden running for   president? Can someone chime in on this?     . You guys didn't even include him on your polls!
I am a suburban housewife and I call the shots. I decide who I‚Äôm voting for. And it‚Äôs not Biden!
I‚Äôm hoping Biden‚Äôs first act will be to remove this.
If the Democrats can't see that "we the people" need Medicare for all then Biden may not be the candidate for me and I may vote independent instead.
We made it thru 8 yrs under his most hated Obama with nary a whiff of this and, in fact, he cleaned up the mess the Rs left. Now we are in midst of pandemic, major civil unrest, and cratered economy under Trump. Biden will be left to clean it up again.
I get your reasoning... i think Trump was the ideal anti politician when he ran, but even if he is or isn't controlled by his enormous debts that we could debate on forever. He looks weak when he won't admit a mistake. I think going deep state is a little far fetched but Biden
What makes him better than Biden?
On top of that, there is a good chance Trump wouldn't even do any debates, so it makes sense for Biden to agree to the standard three debates.
When Dr. Jill Biden gets in there, she can dig it up for another round of vegetable garden...
Vote Trump OUT in November. Everyone at the protests and at home can't be pulled into a false sense of security. Like it or not, we NEED to elect Biden. Otherwise, we fall further into dictatorship. #TrumpisaDictator #FascistGOP #fascistTrump #TrumpsGestapo #gestapoLEAVEPortland
It's been Kang v Kodos forever here in the U.S. but I only started paying attention 20 years ago.  Biden (like Clinton in 2016) has a 0% chance of getting my vote. t('ÃÄ-'ÃÅt)
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
Obama and Biden sold our country over and over to the highest bidder!
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
I hope Biden‚Äôs pick for VP is an open minded and progressive person.
BULLSHIT!!!! YA CANNOT HIDE STUPIDITY ON BIDEN‚ÄôS PART!!!
ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTING BIDEN!!!!  HE DOES NOT MAKE THIS STUFF UP!! THE DEMS AND RADICAL LEFT TELL HIM WHAT TO SAY!!! STUPID!!!!
Please stop following and supporting this man! He wants to screw Biden and is totally fine with trump winning. A vote for Kanye is a vote for Trump
Joe Biden has been indicted in Ukraine. And has been shown he's proud of it all. "Well, son of a bitch, he was fired".  Are those the types of crimes Trump commited?   #Trump2020LandslideVictory  #DonJr2024
FISA court approved warrant because of perjured testimony, by [redacted], but "verified" by James Comey, Dir. FBI. Info for dossier came partly from Russian Oligarchy, Clinton KNEW while SOS. Or is it the crime that pedophile Joe Biden commited extortion, and...2/x
Recent Biden quotes, "Is it tomorrow yet?", "Where's my foot?"
This has been true for quite sometime. They hate Trump as a conservative. To promote Biden, a demented grifter, is to promote the Progressive Machine propping him up. That Machine is showing its intent in every riotous city‚Äîcoercion through fear to achieve socialism.
Biden might end up with a Reagan type win if this keeps up
Obama/Biden administration set up trump with a ,‚Äùwhat to do during a pandemic‚Äù handbook. Paid for by us. There was a plan in place, trump refused to follow or listen to experts. This is the,‚ÄùTrumpVirus‚Äù he‚Äôs responsible.
President Trump, Joe Biden really cares for people. You do not care for anyone but yourself and your family (when they blindly obey you.)  will fulfill our dreams of getting America back on track and by being some one we can respect and look up to. #TrumpCorruption
OBAMA &amp; BIDEN WERE BIG FAT FAILURES!!!!
Another Wow here. I sure hope the Biden admin can fix the bad judges this nasty gang has installed. Thanks for another good news perspective!
Actually, it looks good for Biden.  So good that we should fully expect the goon squad to help interfere in the election.
Decent and respectful discussion between former Vice-President Joe Biden and former President Barack Obama about pressing day-to-day life and societal issues, bringing unity, and leadership. A tone that needs to be restored in our nation.
Biden leads in dead voter polls by 90%.  Fact!
If there‚Äôs no debate, Biden will win. That‚Äôs the strategy.
Exactly how are you going to pin Trumps America - he has dying and unemployed -on Biden?
It‚Äôs Trump‚Äôs America -stop the blame.  Let Biden fix it. He will restore Dignity, Health, Prosperity. Trump led us here in 3.5 years.  Imagine where we‚Äôd be in 7 or 8? #Biden2020ToSaveAmericaNo you have it wrong Biden is going to lose.  The only thing Democrats care about is power and control.
The lesser of two evils is the better choice when choices are down to that.   is pure evil.  Biden is not.
Is Biden going to make it this easy? Especially if we can get Cannabis Repealed! #FreeTheLeaf #SaveThePeopleAndPlanet #CannabisKillsCancer #WeDontWantHARMAweWantFARMA #GodBlessAmerica
Just reading the comments to his thing just shows how poorly people‚Äôs reading comprehension is. That idiocracy was how we had Trump v Hilary and now Trump v Biden. Jesus.
I think we should open schools when President Biden says we should. #StudentsMatter
I agree with this video's sentiment Let's say the protesters stay home... Trump's response will be to claim victory and use it as an example of how strong arm tactics work The argument that he's going to jail if he loses is unlikely based on Biden's desire to get "back to normal"These folks will create significant damage to a Biden presidency
If you make so much money that Vice President Biden's tax plan would raise your taxes, you have my congratulations. I don't make nearly that much.  " I am old enough to remember when they were pushing Global freezing!" [Citation needed.]
Allies say Karen Bass's reputation as a bridge-builder would make her a strong partner to presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden.
Funny how a few months ago it was a "stupendous fabrication" when Joe Biden suggested that this would happen.
Step DOWN Joe.  You just alienated more than half the country you are officially unelectable
Kamala Harris likes to portray herself as a progressive, but the California senator has said that tech giants like Google must be allowed to grow unimpeded.
Ken Salazar‚Äôs ‚Äúlucrative spin through the revolving door‚Äù is reminiscent of the pay-to-play system that has grown under President Donald Trump.
Vote and return ourballots as soon as possible!  Biden and his competent team are gonna be so busy fixing all that Trump has broken.
I'll like him until the election is over (that is, until after the Biden inauguration).
Yes, we have Vice President Biden as our nominee.  And you have donald as yours.  See you in November.
And, actually that‚Äôs really sad! Because that means that absolutely nobody cares about what Joe Biden has to say. They‚Äôre just going to vote for him regardless. Because Donald Trump has fucked up so bad that no matter what Biden says he‚Äôs going to win the vote.
I have wondered for a while if a trump campaign plan is to get the Biden camp to release a pandemic plan and then see if they can win an electoral college majority from folks voting for death.
I happy for every single vote that changes from Trump to Biden. I'll welcome them and hope they bring more with them.
Victory for Biden in 2020 is a victory for Western democracy akin to the fall f the Berlin Wall and the defeat of the Axis.  If we pull it off.  If we fail, it will be a disaster equivalent to an Axis victory or the fall of NATO to the Warsaw Pact.
Do black ppl really want to vote for joe Biden who is responsible for over a million black men locked up and thousands on thousands dead right now today by the hands of police. He‚Äôs responsible for the Obama laws which of right now got all ppl in debt and suffering
Matter of fact even though it haven‚Äôt been easy it‚Äôs been a cakewalk under Donald trump then any of a white senator laws that was made in 1994. If you think I‚Äôm lying ask all the dead black ppl and the ones locked up about the affects of Biden laws.
Here is the truth that dems aren‚Äôt going to tell blacks and the other political groups won‚Äôt say. That blacks survived slavery Jim Crow  joe Biden laws and Obama housing crisis Donald trump is the least of black ppl concerns.

The Biden-Sanders Unity Task Force presumes that the economy will recover as the virus recedes and the world returns to normal. This presumption is wrong at every level.

Indeed. Elect Joe Biden.
We don‚Äôt need the debates. We know Trump‚Äôs agenda. We know Biden‚Äôs long record in government. The debates arose long before the front page of the NYT carried more news than the average American heard in a year. No amount of gotcha moments are needed.

Joe Biden when it comes to any issue. Health for all he don‚Äôt support. Black history he thinks slavery never existed and this country wasn‚Äôt founded on it and immigrants build it. His crime bill he‚Äôs proud he wrote it. Climate change N/a. Police he wants more. Soc sec he want non
The way the dems arepushing joe Biden goes to show you they never had respect for you but a strategy to get your vote. Just like the southern strategy we need to talk about how this black strategy kept tricking black ppl to vote for the enemies and not the black agendas
That‚Äôs the craziest thiNg I ever heard that‚Äôs almost saying your not black if you don‚Äôt vote democrats. Biden don‚Äôt care about climate change matter of fact that‚Äôs not even one of his topics that he talks about. Think about it what plan or agenda does he have for climate control.

Unfortunately, Biden's past loyalty to military-industrial interests does not bode well for the kind of leadership we need, and which we have not seen from any U.S. president of this generation. We must demand better.
Sen. Kamala Harris' no vote "makes her a dubious choice" to be Joe Biden's running mate, said one progressive organizer.Right... another good one for AG would be Swalwell.  I see him as POTUS in 2028.  There are MANY good ppl &amp; I hope Biden can bring them all into the circle &amp; use all their talents.  Warren is a dyn-O-mo! - I want to see her renovate public education.  o-mo!
Maybe Biden is getting that feedback now.  I'll support whoever the nominee is.
Or M4A? Think how we could be more productive 8n the marketplace? We are a nation of consumers, are we not? So, why not support it, Creepy Joe Biden?
I like Warren - a lot.  I honestly think she can accomplish greater things such as revisioning the education system - my #1 priority.  However,  ... &amp; this is true for whichever woman Biden picks, is that she'll be put into the VP 'role' &amp; her hands will be tied.
Me, too.  We need both right now.  Biden is excellent w ppl &amp; compassion &amp; Harris scares the criminals..... so?? lol, what's the decision?
YES!  I hope we get pages so Biden can see them &amp; his advisors as well.  HARRIS - ALL THE WAY!  you-who!!
Man, your parents really did hurt you, didn't they! You are a sad petty man in search of praise. True Leaders actually lead without the need for acknowledgment of their performance. Biden will be sooooo much better than you!
Rice has too many associations w the past; it would open up all the events of the time.  Just sayin' - there 'many' good ppl.  I hope Biden finds ways to use them ALL in a team approach to put the USA back on a secure track to move the country forward &amp; lead the world once again.

Today, Mitt Romney. A year ago, Joe Biden.,
Yes.  Sides have been drawn.  Trump's support has been holding steady at about 40% .  It's down from his avg of about 45% but close to his all time low.  Support is in the south but waning in his swing states in 2016.  MI, WI, MN are looking at Biden.   N-S again.

Biden deserves to have his name cleared. She deserves jail for lying &amp; all media should be apologizing for putting out her story w/o more research first. Most importantly, who put her up to it? Not okay to shove under the rug, imo. If we ignore it, they can pull that shit again!
Sorry, but I think everyone deserves to hear the truth. She should be forced to admit that she lied, on air. Media and everyone should apologize to Biden and learn to look deeper before spouting or repeating shit! To just have it fade away w/ a shrug seems wrong.
Maybe so. But doesn‚Äôt the media have a responsibility to report that her story was fabricated? Don‚Äôt you think Biden deserves a huge apology?

sir, Many educated Ds have expressed feelings, that is what the police are for. Being injured is part of their job.   Biden does not need to come out if his bunker. One Federal bullet kills a rioter and Biden Wins. They the Ds will sacerfice their people to bullets
A vote for Biden is a vote for Russiagate. A vote for Trump is a vote for Chinagate. A vote for Jo is vote to tell both of the above to go fuck themselves with their goddamn ICBMs. Don't waste a good vote on more war. #VotePeace #VoteGold
sir, is there something a lot more sinister.  Look at how the D party is helping the  BLM. Money to the Ds and then back to BLM for ammo. Thry keep pushing on for Feds toreaction.Biden doesnot need to campaign they are doing it for him. If Fed bullets fly Biden win

Biden would have had the crew Obama created called the pandemic response team on the ground in China keeping us informed.  trump cut their budget keeping us in the dark while trump tried in futile to get his trade deal with China.

You're right. Many Republicans are voting for Biden in 2020 because they don't like what they got in 2016.
But VP to who?  Biden, Trump and Kanye ‚Äî none are good options.
What‚Äôs your point? I don‚Äôt like Biden either.
He did all of those within his power and in many circles he was called a dictator. States had many of those options and many choose not to use them. He locked down early and was called xenophobic by Biden and many others. He did invoke the defense production act and you missed it
The Dems in control already know that Biden is a failure. Everything we see now is just punishment and rage as their power drains with the swamp. It will get worse, not better.
Well Grandma Grit is a trump resistor so please forgive me for jumping to the conclusion she might be voting for Biden.

I didn't vote in the 2016 election because polls were showing Clinton had an insurmountable lead. It won't happen again! hitler came to power when voters became complacent. America has seen what trump is selling. It's so poisonous many Republicans are voting for Biden!

Projustice is also advocating for a Presidential candidate who upholds the Constitution and American values. The choices in November will be trump or Biden. Many Republicans are voting Biden because they believe he is better than trump for America.
My hopeful theory is when the Russians (and other bad actors) discern that Trump is losing bulgy they will realize that a Biden win will mean a concerted effort to screw Putin and his Russia mafia. And so will desist.
Funny that you produce that photo. That woman and her husband are great friends of the Biden family. Nothing wrong about that photo.  BTW, Biden didn't have an adult woman sue him for rape when she was 13.
You wish I didn't have a college education. Vote for Sleepy Joe Biden and let him studder his way through everything.
You are unbelievable.  Obama did not endorse a Biden earlier so he did not want to influence the primary process.  You would not be in the WH if it weren‚Äôt for the electoral college, the Russians and Comey.  You lost the election, have done nothing to bring this country together.
and Biden certainly wouldn't give Russian Top Secret information the Israeli's had just shared with the USA!!  Between Trump &amp; Jared I doubt the USA has any secrets left.
Just wait for bill Barr to drop a bomb in October that he is opening an investigation into Biden. It‚Äôll happen
It also risks discontinuity, halting any progress made to change America for the better. A combined 12 years of Biden followed by his VP is a lot of time to make a lot of changes. Although there would also be discontinuity if the GOP win in '24.
Rice is a career diplomat. She has never sought elected office and doesn't seem all that interested in starting now. She would be on the ticket as a reliable voice in the Oval Office that Biden knows and trusts from serving together in the Obama Administration.
If, as is likely, Joe Biden only serves one term if elected, the smart move may be to picl someone who would clearly be a one term VP too.
Oh dear God please let Trump go on celebrity Jeopardy with Biden And Obamaü§¶
Whose procrastination is more infuriating--the Washington Football Team or Joe Biden?  Like, you know what NOT to do.  So just .... do the opposite of that thing.
I TOTALLY AGREE with you except on ONE thing . . . it will stop when Biden is elected.  That you can take to the bank - except banks will likely close as people rush to take out their money and stash it in their mattresses.
You would have thrown a fit if he had endorsed him earlier, claiming it was an unfair advantage or something equally as ridiculous. He waited so that it would be fair, so that Biden could do it based on his own merit and not anyone‚Äôs endorsement. I think it was wise.
Marie Harf is making false statements again! When Biden was asked what he would do differently for COVID he listed off everything Pres Trump has done!!!!!!
It‚Äôs funny how you are using trumps America to scare people from thinking that it‚Äôs going to be Biden‚Äòs America. Because this is our reality now, because of Trump.Guys - we demand D's fight harder and when they do, we get nervous.   I don't like corporate Dems for sure, but they're right this time. If we took 4 mo deal, just as Biden wins power would swing to R's about evictions.   Come on team be strong. Don't cave now.
- I disagree Ana. Republicans must make a deal or evictions will happen under Trump.   Dems have leverage so now is not the time to give in. Finally, Pelosi playing hardball and she's right. Too late, but if cave then giving R's power when Biden wins.

Emma sadly, since a true #progressive seems out of the question I'm leaning towards Susan Rice.   May I ask your thoughts about her? There's a good chance Biden may not last 4 yrs. I don't wish him harm but at his age he can pass at any time.   Thank you Emma.
There goes Trump's October surprise!   The House issued a subpoena as part of an investigation into Pompeo's ‚Äúapparent use of Department of State resources to advance a political smear of former VP Biden.‚Äù   Sen. Ron Johnson &amp; Devin Nunes are also complicit in the scheme
The way to do things is neither conservative nor liberal but with intelligence and finesse. We need balanced and effective policies to inaugurate a great American renaissance. Great works await your willingness to hear me. Otherwise, Biden will win as the reform candidate.

Yeah, right!  You saying that Mr. Biden had a hand in murder?!?!  That‚Äôs a new one!!  I guess you can say anything, can‚Äôt you??
I don't think any Democrat would mind welcoming President Pelosi. Let's say the election happens, Biden wins, Trump cries fraud, it ends up in court and he refuses to leave. I think if January 20th comes &amp; Trump hasn't left, the speaker can call the Secret Service or US Marshals.

From what we're hearing, it sounds like it will be Harris. I've been rooting for her so I'm happy if that's the news. I like how she responded to criticism by taking a progressive stance on cannabis, an issue regarding which she can hopefully influence Biden much as he did Obama.
Probably he‚Äôll still blame Biden. He should look in the mirror and the person looking back is who he should blame. He won‚Äôt win tho! We are done with the malignant tumor who has occupied the wh.
Wouldn't be able to understand what's being said or happening in either one the hearings or the Biden speech
People are of their times, shaped by events as much as our own idiosyncratic identities. Biden is no different. But we have to remember Biden came out in favor of gay marriage equality before Obama, causing controversy. He has a progressive streak purists are willfully blind to.
I see in Biden a potential great President. The possibilities of the office are immense. Hopefully, the Presidency shall continue to listen to the citizens, whoever occupies it. Yang is right on.
Awe I‚Äôm sorry! The good news is that I‚Äôm confident that we will get back to ‚Äúnormal ‚Äú soon. It may take Biden some time to undue the malignant tumor evil deeds  #ISTANDWITHPORTLAND
If Trump wins critics of the Republican party will be jailed and/or disappear. #MAGA will cheer.  If Biden wins, the few corporations which own everything will bring back company stores. #DNC will issue guidelines.   America must collapse &amp; suffer for any chance of change.

Yeah but I feel like we out number them. George w took back gop super funds from trump campaign and gave it to Biden. He said just cuz you are gop you don‚Äôt have to vote for trump sounds like George w is endorsing Biden
I don't like the "Biden will be busy on the first day" tweets. Yeah, he will, but the statement reeks of complacency. There's an election to be won first. After that, we all need to stay busy creating the space &amp; demand for change and that will be quite the long-term effort.
When Biden wins, no matter where Trump is on Jan 20, 2021 at 12 noon, he ceases being POTUS.
That kinda good right? Now average joe who lives within the law will see trump for the criminal he is. George w took trumps gop campaign pac funds and gave to Biden campaign! Good news  #istandwithportland
I'm voting for Biden ONLY because he's not Trump.   The second Biden is sworn in, I go full on attack mode towards corporate Dems.   Enough of this shit.
It's a very real possibility that Biden's VP will inherit the POTUS position.   I don't wish it, but it's a real possibility.   I demand a true progressive.
Why won't Joe Biden sit down with Chris Wallace for an interview like President Trump did? What is he afraid of? Tough questions like were put to Trump? Trump is going to walk all over Biden in a debate. I can't wait to see it happen.

Everyone wants  to win even a lot of your own party they know what a complete failure you are. Did you lose some gop pac funds recently? I think you did where did they go? Biden‚Äôs campaign? Ouch gotta hurt  #istandwithportland
Out of the women Biden is chosing from, you‚Äôre not funny if that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre going for.

Thank you  the cancerous growth is scheming something evil. I posted an email saying George w pulled pac funds from trumps campaign and gave it to Biden ouch. trump won‚Äôt go quietly   #istandwithportland
Idk he should hold his head in shame. I got an email saying George w pulled gop super pac money from trumps campaign and gave it to Biden. Ouch! He‚Äôs going down in nov. rest assured he won‚Äôt go quiet.   #istandwithportland
Cancer growth, your lying again. You know that vote by mail safe,  fraud free. You just want to be able to call fraud when you lose. You are going down. hear Bush took pac from you and gave it to Biden. ouch gotta hurt #IStandWithPortland
Did George w Bush denounce the malignant tumor? He has taken the special pac money from trump campaign and giving it to Biden. So flipping cool. trump going down. Stay alert on his evil deed he could pull before nov. #westandwithportland
This picture makes so sad How could Bernie support Biden after the DNC and Obama rob him and the country for the second time never Biden.
Biden‚Äôs America
New RNC ad that plays on fear in the hearts of White suburban voters by arguing that they will not be safe if Biden wins   has great graphics from current protests with this caption:   "This is what Biden's presidency looks like"  Lying much?
I'm not voting for Biden or Trump.
Biden will not reform the police. Nothing in his history suggests otherwise.
Follow Biden! #Resistance #ResistanceTaskForce #Biden #November3rd #DumpTrump2020
Wait til there‚Äôs dancing in the street when Biden defeats Trump.  This is warm up.
Of course he is just like Biden isn‚Äôt going to take the suberbs from you he‚Äôs not going to take windows away. Cancer growth is grasping at straws he knows he‚Äôs behind and losing desperation   #IStandWithPortland
Let's be honest, Biden doesn't have to do anything until November and he has my vote!
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.  #TrumpFailsAmerica
Best wishes to you Jess.   It is time to demand our tax money be used on us.   To be clear - I am voting for Joe Biden ONLY because he's not Trump &amp; demand he chose Main St over Wall St.   I am a progressive w/ zero f*cks left to give. #Enough.
Karen, if you become VP candidate please know this:  I am voting for  ONLY because he's not Trump.   The second Biden is sworn in I become his opponent if he compromises on climate, health care &amp; racism.   Done pretending America's system is good.
Protesters Pull Down Joe Biden After Mistaking Him For Old Racist Statue
This is partly the same as the Lafayette Park gassing so he could have a photo-op at the church. A campaign video. If he thinks people will believe this is Biden's America, he has grossly miscalculated. Yet again. This is Trump*s American Carnage speech come to life. He's losing.
I just saw a very lame political commercial on television for sleepy Joe Biden. No substance at all it was just about wearing facemasks.  should just stay in his basement with the rest of the basement dwellers.
It‚Äôs a layup Boston strong the patriot 911 great police work for a greater nation fly a flag fuck Joe Biden
Let me be clear:  I will vote for Joe Biden ONLY because he's not Trump.   The second Biden is sworn in, I become corporate Dems enemy.   Zero f*cks left to give Bernie. Lack of health ins is ruining my  life &amp; I've paid $ tens of thousands into system all my life.  #Enough
Joe Biden is releasing a video of his first in-person meeting with Barack Obama since the coronavirus outbreak began, enlisting the former president to help slam his successor's response to the pandemic.
The one thing I noticed about Biden‚Äôs ads are that he cares about the American people. He has empathy. Trumps ads are inciteful, full of hate &amp; lies. He‚Äôs really lowered himself. But that‚Äôs what he does. He really truly HATES this country. Fact check that!
I don't believe any trying they say never Biden.
Such a careless statement from Biden. Thomas Jefferson didn't believe that African Americans could function as citizens; And we have the White House tapes of Nixon saying the n-word repeatedly... just to rattle off a couple examples. The first racist President? hardly
Has anyone seen trumps new campaign ad? What a bunch of bullshit, lies to make Biden look bad. We got to boycott channels that air the ad. Check it out on YouTube  monologue from tonight  #RIPJohnLewis honor him by votingI understand that all politics is local, but if this is real, it's disqualifying for me.  I'd still vote for Biden though.
Eating a fried turd is still better than eating a fried turd laced with cyanide if you‚Äôre at the point where you have to choose one. Both are shit but one has less of a chance to kill you. The only intellectually honest argument for not voting Biden is an accelerationist one.
Or perhaps the "Do Nothing Committee" it fits perfect since Biden did nothing to become the nominee and they are going to #DoNothing for working people.
Ignoring the fact that this reply is false as to be completely bonkers, $67k is peanuts compared to what Biden‚Äôs family has gotten during his political career.
Trying to talk to people is almost impossible. They have there "hot takes" that must be true and most these hot takes are used to dehumanize people. Its hysterical. People will here someone talk once and assume they know them perfectly then turn around and support biden.... lol
I'm doubtful that those suspicious lunatics are gonna vote for Biden regardless. Whatever VP Biden chooses, there will be some supposedly disqualifying, horrific thing about them that the GOP will promote and Fox News will sell like it's going out of style.
Fliescher was the guy who was all ‚ÄúBiden is irresponsible for suggesting Trump wants to delay election‚Äù as well
Can we just lol  how  and his supporters just "wont accept" the results if Biden wins?ü§£ too bad so said mother %$*+%!
My current nightmare scenario is a Great Schism where blue states recognize a Biden Administration and red states recognize Trump Term Two
Biden should legalize weed = less bail.
I understand you but, we REALLY should have a freeze on rent.  just got a job last week after being out of one since all of this started. A freeze would be nice, instead of my sister and her child struggling to help me live. Biden is kind of insane but no other choice really
You, sir, owe VP Biden an apology in writing. Your spurious opinion piece of 4/24 was myopically intended to discredit the VP. He put forth a plausible scenario that‚Äôs come to fruition. I‚Äôm sure a man of your integrity(?) can do the right thing! Consider #VoteBlue
Senator Tammy Duckworth, Vet Pilot &amp; Iraq War Hero, rec'd a purple heart for horrible injuries. She is the first Thai American elected to Congress.  Duckworth--a wife, mother and fighter--is on Joe Biden's "short list" for V-P.    Washington Post 7/30/2020
You are just scared of not winning!! You will be defeated! Biden 2020!!
You all get he's signaling right? He's saying the right things so we'll believe Biden can be swayed by Obama and feel better about voting Joe. But he's secretly telling donors, of course that isnt happening. He then doesnt have to follow through because it was "Joe's" decision.

Lincoln Project co-founder says if Trump loses he‚Äôll ditch Biden‚Äôs inauguration regarding it as ‚Äòillegitimate‚Äô
I love this. Also, those saying not voting isn‚Äôt an option and we have to get Biden in...do they not realize that Trump is rigging this as we speak? No way we get legit results. Gonna be worse than 2016
No one did shit when Breonna died.  This is hive mentality and the protests will not end unless Biden wins.
Yes,  she's my pick because once we are through  #trumpsCOVIDdisaster, we will need an economic &amp; financial wizard to crawl out of the depression.  However,  I will vote for Biden regardless of who he picks.
Confuse them a little. Say, "Yes. But not nearly as much as George Soros offered to pay me if I would support Joe Biden."
The fact that Biden promised a progressive woman VP then hired noted sex pest and corporate bank hack Chris Dodd to pick which woman is peak Biden candidacy.
Hasn‚Äôt Biden already said he‚Äôs aiming to be a one-term, transitional president? Don‚Äôt most VPs ... want to be President? This is so stupid.
Democrats are not Socialists, my dear, just as you are not truthful. Fair minded folks know Biden is not an extremist, but is a true Patriot.  The GOP no longer represents Conservatives, allowing Trump to spend the country blind and ignore the Pandemic.
Well, with Biden being at such an advanced age, being ready to be pres should be an important criteria.
After the food is done in 16 minutes it will rest and will do more postcards to voters.  TiK Toc.   Today the official thug secret police began a theoretical egress from Portland's BLM march .  Hopefully all will go well tonight.  Hug to all sane Biden supporters.
Once again you apparently can't hold complex views whatsoever. Even if Biden doesn't improve much healthcare-wise a public option better than Trump who has been trying to kick millions of people off health insurance completely with no replacement for his whole presidency.
Once again insulting. It should tell you that I would not take this decision lightly that I'm a survivor. Voting for Biden doesn't mean he's going to legalize rape or something. I view this choice for president as picking which enemy I want to fight for the next 4 years.
Oh so you only care about what *you* want? I'm a sexual assault survivor and advocated against Biden harder than anyone I know, still believe he's probably a rapist. Still going to vote for him, it's insulting that you would try to use that as a bludgeon against me.
I'm hesitant to believe that Joe Biden even uses "anarchists" with any intent outside of referring to people causing "chaos" at protests, none of these boomers have any idea what they're saying when they use that word
Allies would support Joe Biden‚Äôs choice for Vice President. Period.
Voting is just a tool it takes 10 minutes. We the progressives lost when Bernie lost. We‚Äôre stuck with 2 choices, you want the worse one by not voting for Biden. I hate Joe Biden. I‚Äôm voting for Joe Biden. I have been and still will be in the streets whether he wins or loses.
Even if we ignore Biden‚Äôs new climate plan(which is actually decent) just getting back into the Paris Climate Accord would be a marginal improvement over Trump‚Äôs climate accelerationist policy reversals. Not going anywhere near far enough is still the lesser evil in this moment.
Biden Details Proposal To Advance Racial Equity In America
Yes. Knew it before she fully opened her campaign. She's also hiding a cruel streak history which will eventually come out. There's a bigger reason why she was chosen Biden's VP.
Part of Bernie's platform was building 10 million low income housing units. I noticed Biden does not have that in his platform, but I didn't make the connection to racism ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
WHY are we keeping ill people working in the government??   Pelosi, Nadler, Biden....   they need to resign!!!!
Pelosi represents the Clinton faction of the DNC. She's the one who told Biden who to pick. I pointed all that out before the first debate. I've been on way too many campaigns. Know too many secrets.
Put my Biden 2020 sticker on my car---expect it could be damaged.  Hope I am wrong.  This year have been more hesitant to put a sticker on, so feel it's more important than ever to have one.
#President #Trump has the support of over __% of the #American people but the fake news would never report it. That looser Sleepy Joe #Biden is lucky that his name is even on the ballot.
Biden will in inaugurated at noon on January 20, 2021.  At 12:01, 45 has no further business in THE PEOPLE‚ÄôS HOUSE. If he still refuses to leave, the Capital Police can perp walk him out. I want video I can watch daily for the rest of my life.
Biden notes show talking points about Kamala Harris
Dementia-is-Chief doesn‚Äôt understand that ‚Äúvoting by mail‚Äù and ‚Äúabsentee voting‚Äù are the VERY SAME THING! VOTE BLUE! We need a sane POTUS (Joe Biden) who is actually interested in running the country. 45‚Äôs sole interest is in lining his own pockets.
Don't you think people have already tried withholding their vote before to no effect? I plan on going hard at Biden, but I don't trust anything he says he'll do before he's in power anyways. Using my time and energy on fighting the battles of the moment.
I loved that show! Biden is short circuiting. Like a Disneyland animatronic.
It‚Äôs all going to be a shit show. If Trump wins the Liberals are gonna say fraud. If Biden wins the Consevatives are going to say fraud. Divide and conquer. People are so stupid. It‚Äôs hard to watch.
JOE BIDEN'S FAVORITES:  1. Equal Opportunities for all 2. Living Wages for workers 3. Affordable Health Care  4. Environmental Protection     Clean Air/Water 5. Federal Projects Rebuilding     bridges &amp; transportation 6. Criminal Justice Reform 7. Safe Elections &amp; Voter Rights
The electoral college is locked for Biden, vote how you want.
Can we talk about the dogwhisles? I'm going to start a list because Trump has done it too. Pretty sure Biden is fash.
Biden said he would veto it.
For your reading enjoyment:
actually this is all happening under that Trashbag Trump, this is his America, not Biden's, or anyone else's, Trump's.
TRUE! I‚Äôd really love to see her as Biden‚Äôs VP choice.
She does,  but Biden has plenty of Foreign Policy experience (it's one of the reasons Obama, who lacked it,  picked Biden) I want a another expertise for the VP,  like Finance/Economics. We're going to need it.
&gt; then voting in Biden (who lacks the conviction, resolve, or mental fortitude to stand up to the extremists on his side) will utterly fail to quell movements of violence which are led and agitated by left-wing zealots.  Rebellion is inherent to the leftward pull.
I do not see Harris as a good fit for Biden.  Too confrontational &amp; talks to everyone like she's prosecuting them.  On the other hand,  for those same reasons,  I see her as Attorney General.
Biden has foreign policy creds and policy know-how already. I would like someone with strong financial background because we're going to need a financial wizard to get us back from the economic disaster of COVID-19. That's Elizabeth Warren in my mind.
I love Susan Rice but Joe Biden has strong foreign policy cress already.  I want someone with strong financial cress to compliment that
I am voting for Biden, but I am boycotting the DNC! I will send no more $$$$ to any Democratic fundraiser, because the Democrat Party is voting for Slavery by refusing to legalize a FLOWER!
VOTE BIDEN IN NOVEMBER!
Biden already has the Dem/progressives vote. He needs a dynamic VP who can cement undecideds as well as clearly demonstrate it‚Äôs not the White Boys Club of Trump/Pence. In my mind that person has been and continues to be Kamala Harris.  Picking a bland VP achieves nothing.
The differences between Trump and Joe Biden are very real!  Joe Biden is a Patriotic Vet, and helped solve the 2008 Economic Crash left us by Bush.  A Senator for 30 years, Biden knows U.S. Law and loves America's people.  And, Joseph Biden is a kind and honorable family man.
Trump had peaceful citizens "gassed" near the White House.  Trump caused the violence in Portland--beatings, fires, serious injuries--by sending "National Police" with Gestapo Tactics.  Biden respects our civil rights to free speech and to assemble.   U.S. Constitution
Me too but not in the way 45 wants to make it great. I want the government I support to support ALL Americans not just the Caucasian humans but ALL humans. I want my government to apply the laws of the land to EVERYBODY including those in government. I want Joe Biden as POTUS.
I‚Äôm a Catholic. NOBODY tells ME who to vote for. I‚Äôm ‚Äúridin‚Äô with Biden‚Äù AND I‚Äôm voting for ALL the Dems on the ticket. üëç
Dear Democratic establishment, This is why leftists fucking hate you. Get your shit together. Be better. If Biden loses, it *will* be your fault.
Yes, let's make America Great Again! America lost it's greatness when you became president. You are a racist, fascist, bigot. Why won't you go and pay the respect due to John Lewis? Is it because he's so much greater than you'll ever be? Jealousy becomes no one. BIDEN 2020!!
Mr. Allen Frances &amp; wife:  My extended family in Tulsa don't get information on the candiates. One said Biden is a Communist. Others thought we have Riots in Portland and don't know of Trump's Gestapo tactics with the "National Police."  Please help.  WRITE TO CENTRAL STATES.
VP Biden and Dr. Biden paying respects to Rep. John Lewis touched my heart.
Trump is going to lie and say China interfered for Biden.
Watch Trump/Pompeo/Barr/GOP amplify conflict and strongman narrative they‚Äôre ‚Äútough‚Äù on China while claimJoe Biden is ‚Äúsoft‚Äù on China. I‚Äôm hearing China may be falsely blamed for ‚Äúelection interference‚Äù on Joe‚Äôs behalf when he wins. How can manipulated narrative be addressed?
Trump is setting up China as how Biden wins the election-Trump lie will be China interfered for Biden because likes Biden better since Trump has been a anti-China strongman and Biden is soft. This is a STRATEGY by losing campaign and Pompeo/Barr/GOP to hold onto POWER.
Will Biden‚Äôs choice for ruining may sour his chances is that why he hasn‚Äôt made a decision
Mnuchin is buying junk bonds with. US Treasury dollars.  Hundreds of billions of dollars. They will sell if Biden is elected.
Either I didn't see it or I did a Joe Biden
This is really unusual. In pretty much every modern-day political campaign, politicians appeal to their base, then soften rhetoric and drift to the middle.   This indicates Biden is not in charge of his own campaign
YES! Beat Trump is with his own words &amp; illegal actions. While Trump &amp; his Crime Family are slandering Joe Biden with lies, we can fight back with the TRUTH! Biden has a PLAN moving forward.  Trump‚Äôs plan is to lie his way into 4 more yrs of us paying for his golfing weekends.
Who is Biden?
Obama, Biden, Antifa and China. üôÑ
I look for Biden to do exactly that the first month of his administration. Sadly, it‚Äôs a little over five months until the inauguration. I‚Äôm concerned about what can happen to the economy between now and then. We can‚Äôt rebuild the economy until we control the virus. üôè
Biden has lied his entire career. Big things, little things, plagerizing over and over, lying about the way his wife died, the video of him creeping on girls and women and saying creepy shit to their husbands about them. This guy doesnt belong in the White House.
We didnt even have a primary. They had already chosen Biden, the other candidates were cover from scrutiny.
This is so ridiculous.  The country has already been destroyed by Trump.  It can‚Äôt get any worse.  No, Biden is the answer right and I‚Äôm happy to see that the majority of Americans agree as well.   Thank God you‚Äôre  in the minority.
That explains why Hunter Biden's father #BeijingIntercourseJoe wants America to have more "economic intercourse" with #CCP China.
It‚Äôs not just   EVERYONE (at least intelligent people) wants Biden to win in November. Stop whining and start preparing your concession speech.
Biden needs to calm things down if he can.
The anti #Biden bots are out in force today. Nice trending Biden bots. Not so good at hiding your botness.
No, just the idiotic white folks. Most of us will go with Biden.
Has Biden released a plan on helping/saving the USPS?
Trump setting up China as blame for election interference, thus someone to blame for his tremendous Loss. He‚Äôll claim Biden ‚Äúsoft‚Äù on China.
If anyone tries to say Biden is the most progressive since FDR, please dont let that stand. It's a terribly incorrect statement based on his current policies, I beg you to push back on that narrative.
Gen. is correct. The DC establishment from both parties has sold "We the People" interests 2 #CCP fascistüá®üá≥4 personal gains.  invested in firms that movedüá∫üá∏jobs 2üá®üá≥.üá®üá≥gave Hunter Biden $1.5 billion &amp; funded the Penn Biden Center that paid #BeijingIntercourseJoe $800k.
Biden is clearly NOT Catholic...not in action or in confessing his faith...it‚Äôs the saddest thing, how much good could he be doing if he was actually a true and faithful Catholic? ANY Catholic that votes for him in this coming election ‚Äúlet him/her be Anathema‚Äù
Was it something like this?  The Media with its Polls pushing the Biden Candidacy for President! The lights are on, but no one is Home.
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
I would love nothing more in my lifetime than to have everything related to our involvement (ie, Obama/Biden-era administration) in the 2014 coup which sent Ukraine spiraling into civil war.  If the best we get is Biden dirt, I guess that's what I can live with, but I want more.
#BeijingIntercourseJoe aka father of Hunter Biden has been paid by #CCP via CCP funded the Penn Biden Center to be #Xitler's apologist. That's why Joe wants America to have more "economic intercourse" w/ China &amp; blames . for #CCPVirus killing 148,202 Americans.

Part of Bernie's platform was building 10 million low income housing units. I noticed Biden does not have that in his platform, but I didn't make the connection to racism ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
WHY are we keeping ill people working in the government??   Pelosi, Nadler, Biden....   they need to resign!!!!
Pelosi represents the Clinton faction of the DNC. She's the one who told Biden who to pick. I pointed all that out before the first debate. I've been on way too many campaigns. Know too many secrets.
Put my Biden 2020 sticker on my car---expect it could be damaged.  Hope I am wrong.  This year have been more hesitant to put a sticker on, so feel it's more important than ever to have one.
#President #Trump has the support of over __% of the #American people but the fake news would never report it. That looser Sleepy Joe #Biden is lucky that his name is even on the ballot.
Biden will in inaugurated at noon on January 20, 2021.  At 12:01, 45 has no further business in THE PEOPLE‚ÄôS HOUSE. If he still refuses to leave, the Capital Police can perp walk him out. I want video I can watch daily for the rest of my life.
Biden notes show talking points about Kamala Harris
Dementia-is-Chief doesn‚Äôt understand that ‚Äúvoting by mail‚Äù and ‚Äúabsentee voting‚Äù are the VERY SAME THING! VOTE BLUE! We need a sane POTUS (Joe Biden) who is actually interested in running the country. 45‚Äôs sole interest is in lining his own pockets.
Don't you think people have already tried withholding their vote before to no effect? I plan on going hard at Biden, but I don't trust anything he says he'll do before he's in power anyways. Using my time and energy on fighting the battles of the moment.
I loved that show! Biden is short circuiting. Like a Disneyland animatronic.
It‚Äôs all going to be a shit show. If Trump wins the Liberals are gonna say fraud. If Biden wins the Consevatives are going to say fraud. Divide and conquer. People are so stupid. It‚Äôs hard to watch.
JOE BIDEN'S FAVORITES:  1. Equal Opportunities for all 2. Living Wages for workers 3. Affordable Health Care  4. Environmental Protection     Clean Air/Water 5. Federal Projects Rebuilding     bridges &amp; transportation 6. Criminal Justice Reform 7. Safe Elections &amp; Voter Rights
The electoral college is locked for Biden, vote how you want.
Can we talk about the dogwhisles? I'm going to start a list because Trump has done it too. Pretty sure Biden is fash.
Biden said he would veto it.
For your reading enjoyment:
actually this is all happening under that Trashbag Trump, this is his America, not Biden's, or anyone else's, Trump's.
TRUE! I‚Äôd really love to see her as Biden‚Äôs VP choice.
She does,  but Biden has plenty of Foreign Policy experience (it's one of the reasons Obama, who lacked it,  picked Biden) I want a another expertise for the VP,  like Finance/Economics. We're going to need it.
&gt; then voting in Biden (who lacks the conviction, resolve, or mental fortitude to stand up to the extremists on his side) will utterly fail to quell movements of violence which are led and agitated by left-wing zealots.  Rebellion is inherent to the leftward pull.
I do not see Harris as a good fit for Biden.  Too confrontational &amp; talks to everyone like she's prosecuting them.  On the other hand,  for those same reasons,  I see her as Attorney General.
Biden has foreign policy creds and policy know-how already. I would like someone with strong financial background because we're going to need a financial wizard to get us back from the economic disaster of COVID-19. That's Elizabeth Warren in my mind.
I love Susan Rice but Joe Biden has strong foreign policy cress already.  I want someone with strong financial cress to compliment that
I am voting for Biden, but I am boycotting the DNC! I will send no more $$$$ to any Democratic fundraiser, because the Democrat Party is voting for Slavery by refusing to legalize a FLOWER!
Just wait til Obama pays the price with Biden, too. P R I S O N    #ObamaGateAintGoingAway
VOTE BIDEN IN NOVEMBER!
Biden already has the Dem/progressives vote. He needs a dynamic VP who can cement undecideds as well as clearly demonstrate it‚Äôs not the White Boys Club of Trump/Pence. In my mind that person has been and continues to be Kamala Harris.  Picking a bland VP achieves nothing.
The differences between Trump and Joe Biden are very real!  Joe Biden is a Patriotic Vet, and helped solve the 2008 Economic Crash left us by Bush.  A Senator for 30 years, Biden knows U.S. Law and loves America's people.  And, Joseph Biden is a kind and honorable family man.
Trump had peaceful citizens "gassed" near the White House.  Trump caused the violence in Portland--beatings, fires, serious injuries--by sending "National Police" with Gestapo Tactics.  Biden respects our civil rights to free speech and to assemble.   U.S. Constitution
Me too but not in the way 45 wants to make it great. I want the government I support to support ALL Americans not just the Caucasian humans but ALL humans. I want my government to apply the laws of the land to EVERYBODY including those in government. I want Joe Biden as POTUS.
I‚Äôm a Catholic. NOBODY tells ME who to vote for. I‚Äôm ‚Äúridin‚Äô with Biden‚Äù AND I‚Äôm voting for ALL the Dems on the ticket. üëç
Dear Democratic establishment, This is why leftists fucking hate you. Get your shit together. Be better. If Biden loses, it *will* be your fault.
Yes, let's make America Great Again! America lost it's greatness when you became president. You are a racist, fascist, bigot. Why won't you go and pay the respect due to John Lewis? Is it because he's so much greater than you'll ever be? Jealousy becomes no one. BIDEN 2020!!
Mr. Allen Frances &amp; wife:  My extended family in Tulsa don't get information on the candiates. One said Biden is a Communist. Others thought we have Riots in Portland and don't know of Trump's Gestapo tactics with the "National Police."  Please help.  WRITE TO CENTRAL STATES.
VP Biden and Dr. Biden paying respects to Rep. John Lewis touched my heart.
He needs to take a competency test. He and Biden can go together.
Trump is going to lie and say China interfered for Biden.
Watch Trump/Pompeo/Barr/GOP amplify conflict and strongman narrative they‚Äôre ‚Äútough‚Äù on China while claimJoe Biden is ‚Äúsoft‚Äù on China. I‚Äôm hearing China may be falsely blamed for ‚Äúelection interference‚Äù on Joe‚Äôs behalf when he wins. How can manipulated narrative be addressed?
Trump is setting up China as how Biden wins the election-Trump lie will be China interfered for Biden because likes Biden better since Trump has been a anti-China strongman and Biden is soft. This is a STRATEGY by losing campaign and Pompeo/Barr/GOP to hold onto POWER.
Will Biden‚Äôs choice for ruining may sour his chances is that why he hasn‚Äôt made a decision
Mnuchin is buying junk bonds with. US Treasury dollars.  Hundreds of billions of dollars. They will sell if Biden is elected.
Either I didn't see it or I did a Joe Biden
This is really unusual. In pretty much every modern-day political campaign, politicians appeal to their base, then soften rhetoric and drift to the middle.   This indicates Biden is not in charge of his own campaign
YES! Beat Trump is with his own words &amp; illegal actions. While Trump &amp; his Crime Family are slandering Joe Biden with lies, we can fight back with the TRUTH! Biden has a PLAN moving forward.  Trump‚Äôs plan is to lie his way into 4 more yrs of us paying for his golfing weekends.
Who is Biden?
Obama, Biden, Antifa and China. üôÑ
I look for Biden to do exactly that the first month of his administration. Sadly, it‚Äôs a little over five months until the inauguration. I‚Äôm concerned about what can happen to the economy between now and then. We can‚Äôt rebuild the economy until we control the virus. üôè
Biden has lied his entire career. Big things, little things, plagerizing over and over, lying about the way his wife died, the video of him creeping on girls and women and saying creepy shit to their husbands about them. This guy doesnt belong in the White House.
We didnt even have a primary. They had already chosen Biden, the other candidates were cover from scrutiny.
This is so ridiculous.  The country has already been destroyed by Trump.  It can‚Äôt get any worse.  No, Biden is the answer right and I‚Äôm happy to see that the majority of Americans agree as well.   Thank God you‚Äôre  in the minority.
That explains why Hunter Biden's father #BeijingIntercourseJoe wants America to have more "economic intercourse" with #CCP China.
It‚Äôs not just   EVERYONE (at least intelligent people) wants Biden to win in November. Stop whining and start preparing your concession speech.
Biden needs to calm things down if he can.
The anti #Biden bots are out in force today. Nice trending Biden bots. Not so good at hiding your botness.
No, just the idiotic white folks. Most of us will go with Biden.
Has Biden released a plan on helping/saving the USPS?
Trump setting up China as blame for election interference, thus someone to blame for his tremendous Loss. He‚Äôll claim Biden ‚Äúsoft‚Äù on China.
If anyone tries to say Biden is the most progressive since FDR, please dont let that stand. It's a terribly incorrect statement based on his current policies, I beg you to push back on that narrative.
Gen. is correct. The DC establishment from both parties has sold "We the People" interests 2 #CCP fascistüá®üá≥4 personal gains.  invested in firms that movedüá∫üá∏jobs 2üá®üá≥.üá®üá≥gave Hunter Biden $1.5 billion &amp; funded the Penn Biden Center that paid #BeijingIntercourseJoe $800k.
Biden is clearly NOT Catholic...not in action or in confessing his faith...it‚Äôs the saddest thing, how much good could he be doing if he was actually a true and faithful Catholic? ANY Catholic that votes for him in this coming election ‚Äúlet him/her be Anathema‚Äù
Was it something like this?  The Media with its Polls pushing the Biden Candidacy for President! The lights are on, but no one is Home.

Biden‚Äôs internal polling
She hasn‚Äôt. Warren has lead almost every single poll. Harris has lead 1 of them or been tied   Biden‚Äôs internal polling shows Harris isn‚Äôt popular amongst Black voters, according to The NY Times
Biden‚Äôs team is doing internal polling, if Harris isn‚Äôt chosen it‚Äôs because she doesn‚Äôt poll well amongst voters Biden wants support from
People who don‚Äôt support Kamala Harris for the VP position  -her former aides  -young voters  -Biden‚Äôs VP search team  -progressive voters  -Biden‚Äôs aides  -people who endorsed Harris during the primary  -the Left  -california dems  -black voters in the midwest

There might be a contested nomination no matter what, assuming biden doesnt run. The Dem party is restive and has a lot of talented people who want to move up.
Biden needs to either eliminate it or do some drastic restructuring. This is what some feared would/could happen when creating DHS.
Kamala Harris is only popular on twitter. She isn‚Äôt popular in real life.   Biden‚Äôs internal polling most likely supports this and the results of the Democratic primary clearly support this.
precisely. It's not like Joe Biden doesn't have name recognition.
Do you think Joe Biden doesn't have enough name recognition? One problem in the last election was that Hillary had too much name recognition. Kamala has Considerable name recognition. Just like Susan Rice. OTOH you make a good point.üëÄ
This is a poor metric to use.   Warren did the best out of everyone on Biden‚Äôs VP shortlist in the primary.   She did better than Kamala Harris who was so unpopular in her own home state that she polled in 5th place (tied w/ Gabbard) and had to drop out to avoid being embarrassed

We can either have a VP (president of the senate) who supports getting rid of the filibuster and has pushed Biden successfully to the left on a bunch of issues (Warren)  ...or we can have a VP who has made lukewarm comments, sometimes negative, about getting rid of the filibuster
Biden does not support getting rid of it. This is why we need Warren to be the next VP: she has successfully pushed Biden left on a bunch of issues.   The other people on his VP shortlist haven‚Äôt been able to push him left on any major issue

I was really dreading a Biden/Hillary ticket. That would have been worse. Instead, the dems have settled on a pair that will at least provide some humor before getting crushed. I mean, if you can't laugh at these 2, you've no sense of humor at all.
By election day, everyone will know Biden's pick for VP is really the DNC's pick for de facto President (if not, President-in-fact when Biden is 25'd). That means it'lll be someone DNC leadership will be VERY comfortable having as President.  And that may well mean it'll be HRC.
I'll take a "Sleepy Joe" over "Sleazy Don" any day. At least he has some integrity. You, your corrupt father, and all your sons (and sons-in-law) have never had ANY integrity. You're all thieves, cheaters and liars. Biden isn't perfect. But he's 10,000% better than you.
Does Biden‚Äôs campaign really want more stuff like this?  It‚Äôs only occurring with Harris too.   Isn‚Äôt that interesting?   There‚Äôs like 5+ other Black women in contention for the VP job but the only social media controversies are related to her. Funny.
The amount of ~drama~ Kamala Harris has created surrounding the VP thing should be a red flag for Biden.
At least he is not a TRAITOR to his country, nor a RUSSIAN ASSET, as Trump is. BIDEN as CIC, would not allow our soliders to be murdered by Putin bounties w/o ordering an investigation. He would definitely retaliate against such an atrocity, not make excuses for Putin's actions!
Exactly!!! They want to keep us home, no school, crash the economy, submit to Anarchists, to get Biden elected.
‚ÄúBiden‚Äôs team is harboring resentment towards Kamala Harris, therefore she would be a great VP‚Äù
I agree. perhaps i do believe that running on law and order when we have a gestapo problem is bad optics, but if it makes you feel better im not voting for biden either. The honeymoon with the religious left is over
I like Warren, Harris, and Rice.  I think a pick like Colin Powell could have helped heal the country,  But Biden has my vote no matter what.
Also, Trump wants to define suburbans as "white" and ban all low-income housing projects in suburbs. Can we assume Biden disagrees?

Everybody though Hillary would win and she just tried to glide through the election barely up by 2-3 points in most key states. Biden is still up, but not much traction despite how awful Trump is and getting worse each passing day

I do not like Joe Biden. But if you need a difference between Biden and Trump it‚Äôs that Biden actually wants to govern the country. Will he do it well? Depends who you ask. But right now we‚Äôre managed by people who proudly, aggressively, do not know what the fuck they are doing
hasn‚Äôt biden said publicly he‚Äôll only serve one term? what does he expect his vp to do??
There are tons of reasons why Kamala Harris would be a disaster VP choice:  -mismanaged office while AG, Biden said she botched over 1,000+ cases  -flip flops on important issues: medicare, defense spending, etc  -her office tried to keep prisoners locked up for cheap labor
I would vote for kamala harris over joe biden, she talk like obama and can word her words in education way.
Since Biden is likely to be a one-term president, what's wrong with getting Harris ready to go?
To be clear, it would be crazy for Biden to want someone who *doesn't* want to be the post-Biden nominee - that's an important way to exercise his power. But I do think they have an unusually acute problem here in terms of incentives.
I think this is a huge difference. My assumption is that Biden does not see himself as necessarily a one-termer, but that his VP may well see him that way.
Wasn't one reason Obama picked Biden that they thought he was too old to spend his VP term scheming for a presidential run?
You are the Supreme agitator. You and the GOP have destroyed more of this country than any peaceful protesters.  Millions of jobs lost, over 150,000 Americans dead, and Biden will never get the greasy, clown-face make-up out of the Oval Office. Biden2020. #TrumpVirus
I don‚Äôt understand this question ü§î Joe Biden was the author of that bill. He championed it. Sanders voted for it but he didn‚Äôt center his career on it. Both obviously have some responsibility but it‚Äôs something that could be used as a cudgel against Biden more easily
This loyalty stuff is probably a cover for concerns about her record that Biden‚Äôs team doesn‚Äôt want to publicly bring up
Their goal isn‚Äôt to convince people to vote GOP, they just need to convince people not to vote for Biden. Trump‚Äôs campaign already has ads running in some states focused on Biden‚Äôs crime bill and how it affected Black communities. The goal is to make people stay home.
Being forced to vote for Biden..... Why do I feel so violated?
She is such a terrible candidate. This is the one good thing Biden‚Äôs team has  done
Trump will use Harris‚Äôs controversial record against her and against Biden
Why do Biden's aids always sound like a Hallmark greeting card when they tweet for him?
If the Federal Government didn't go to Portland last week there would haven't been a resurgence in the violence giving us actual footage of what America will look like under Biden. #TrumpThreatensAmerica  #TrumpIsALaughingStock #TrumpGestapo
My God!  He cannot even read a teleprompter anymore!  And wondering, is this a Biden ad...or a Trump ad?

I'm just pointing out there's no relief in sight for the problems that ail America. Yes, I hope Biden wins. He's a better human being &amp; a better POTUS. But he's still against #M4A, #BLM, #GND, #Legalization-- everything we really need. Either way, the riots must continue in 2021.
Biden won the nomination on perceived electability. Not because of his policies or his record.
I hope everyone knows a vote for Biden is a vote for Kamela Harris as well, a well known radical Attorney who would push out Biden ASAP allowing Pelosi to move into second place for The Predidency. A disaster for America!
I thinks it‚Äôs pure trump to do this since Biden will be selecting a woman VP. Haley has been sucking up big time as of late. Biden just needs to wait to announce his VP until after the RNC
I cringe with you! Can you imagine Biden at his first Press Conference? I wish Red Skelton was still alive, his parody of Biden would be hilarious!
biden wont do anything about the war against cities or the doj and its war against liberalism. hes just a place holder while we wait for another trump
I thought Joe Biden was a no brainer.
Think he has already, the guy is a step closer to Biden‚Äôs brain power as well.

Let them steal from their own campaign. That‚Äôs less money for voter contact.  And the FEC, with a quorum legit board under President Biden, can give them all a lovely colonoscopy, followed by 3 to 5 at Danbury for each of them found to have pocketed the cash.

Not surprising from Biden, but it is bracing to watch in real-time how Liberalism aides and abets the rise of fascism by cheering on state repression of radicals, militants, and anti-fascists.
I am right there with you sir as a pastor and a former city government official in Oregon I supported Donald Trump in 2016 but will not in 2020 Joe Biden has my full support
I'm already a follower! ü•≥ All the Resisters will make sure VP Biden is our next LEGITIMATE President! We will also see that the Trump Authoritarian regime is sent back to the same sewer gutter they crawled out of! We will make sure it is sealed so they never get out again!
Yep... Biden‚Äôs ahead:) NOT!
getting us out of the fascist toilet your former boss threw us in makes that an easy call for Biden
No, we really should not put her in a role where she has to do all the hard work and Biden and his VP (hopefully not Harris) takes the credit
Biden vows investment in Black-owned businesses as he unveils plan to fight systemic racism  #BuildBackBetter #racism
Currently we‚Äôre seeing a pattern of posts, which often pile on earlier posts that seek to normalize Donald by opining that both he and Joe Biden are unpalatable.  6/17
Fascism is when capitalism subverts the will of the electorate. It‚Äôs when corporate powers intertwine with governmental authority. The media blackout on Bernie was a glaring indicator. Biden‚Äôs 1994 crimebill is cringe AF. In non related news I‚Äôm old AF
Lmao what? The first time he made a video doing these phone calls to donors it was *with* Elizabeth Warren.  I know you‚Äôre a Biden supporter but don‚Äôt let your bias blind you to the facts
No one is claiming she invented it, but she did popularize it and Biden did adopt it from her
Publicizing the phone calls with videos on social media is a Warren thing. Obama didn‚Äôt do this, he didn‚Äôt turn it into an event in itself. Biden adoptee this from Warren
Biden discusses 'Build Back Better' plan  via    The Q&amp;A was very odd. As he reached for the pre-scripted list, he mumbled something like "this is what I'm supposed to do" on whose orders? For real ppl, who is pulling his strings? #democrats Jordan
Since Biden is using Elizabeth Warren‚Äôs grassroots tactics, her messaging, and her policies, then he should make her the VP.
I think the plans that Democrats have been working on are taking exactly that into account, and working on entrepreneurship, day care, education, etc. I thought Buttigieg's plan was comprehensive and promising, and Biden's been talking about the same direction.
For VP I like Rice for foreign policy smarts and overall cool (a trusted, moderate ear for Biden). Harris might serve most effectively as, I dunno, Attorney General? Who's gaming out the DEM candidate for prez in 2024 in these discussions? Not sure Rice would even want to run.
Exactly. We don't have to worry about Susan Rice and "Benghazi!!" because no matter who Biden throws up, The GOP smear machine will Besmirch.
Bernie's Aunt Tom still can't shut her mouth and stop trying to help Trump.  Many more people will proudly vote for Joe Biden than would have ever voted for your commie friend Bernie.
Why are you lying about Harris‚Äôs record?   Are you ashamed of it?  ‚ÄúHarris did directly prosecute marijuana cases as San Francisco district attorney from 2004 through 2010.‚Äù

You'd think Biden would care enough about winning to adopt a policy that would help all Americans and give non-conservatives a reason to vote for his lame ass.
Elizabeth Warren would make the best Vice President because she would be able to push Joe Biden more left like she‚Äôs done already with him on: abortion, student loan forgiveness, social security benefits, bankruptcy, etc.    None of the other VP choices have pushed him left
Is the libertarian or Joe Biden more likely to win and get the Orange Cheeto out?

I‚Äôm not particularly fond of Biden, but  he‚Äôs probably the most qualified nominee by any party since George H.W. Bush.
I had a Joe Biden joke, but I forgot to put on my pants.
A new Democratic poll finds Joe Biden ahead in a district Trump won by 15 points four years ago
Biden emphasizes Trump's mishandling of COVID-19 in new ad campaign targeting older voters
Pointing out that Harris has been very flippant about her busing attack isn‚Äôt ‚Äúattacking‚Äù her.    The Trump campaign will use this as a cudgel against Joe Biden and it‚Äôs fair to inquire more about Harris‚Äôs motivations for launching this attack
You fit the bill, what if Biden turns around and makes you Veep?
Biden can't answer real questions!! He is Mentally Gone!!!
drop DONDA or we voting for Biden
The KHive (Kamala Harris zealots) are now threatening to not vote for Joe Biden if she isn‚Äôt on the ticket
Biden has cast a wide net for ideas; his campaign has talked with progressive Elizabeth Warren, liberal economists from the Obama administration, and ‚Äúevery Democratic think tank under the sun,‚Äù one Biden aide told Vox.
Why Biden‚Äôs V.P. Pick Could Cinch the 2020 Race | Vanity Fair  ‚ÄúI would argue that of all the Democrats who ran for president in this campaign, Warren became, over time, the most disciplined and highly skilled communicator of the bunch.‚Äù
Isn‚Äôt it interesting that people who say they‚Äôre promoting the Libertarian, Jo Jorgensen, are willing to ignore *everything* Donald has said for more than four decades and dust off one out of context quotation of Joe Biden from 1977?
Biden is wholly owned by the rich, so obviously he won't do a damn thing for the poor of this country.
Biden is no longer like this, while Trump is 1000 times worse, and that's just with race.  Trump is full blown evil while Biden is not.   If you can't tell that already then I will pray for you.
Dodd is old and out of touch.  Don't isten to him, Biden!
Kamala Harris supporters now suggesting they might not vote for Joe Biden in November if Harris isn‚Äôt on the ticket  Terrible. Why won‚Äôt  tell her supporters to tone down the toxic rhetoric?
GOOD! Dude, the "middle" is so far right at this point, people have forgotten where the middle is actually supposed to be. Eisenhower would be considered a "radical leftist" by today's GOP. Biden is farther right than Eisenhower was.
You are unbelievably delusional. YOU are the President now. Do you know that? The America you keep taking about President Biden giving us is the one YOU'VE given us RIGHT NOW. Dude, pull it together...it's just sad now.
Musky boy. You got it wrong sir. The left is winning the middle. Republican here, voting for Biden.
Kamala‚Äôs supporters have been smearing every other woman on Biden‚Äôs VP shortlist.   It‚Äôs disgusting and Harris and her husband give the KHive a wink &amp; a nod. ü§¢ü§Æ
We all know the plan if Biden gets elected. Beto goes for the guns, AOC goes for your tax dollars, Rashida Talib will lead foreign policy and the rest is history pal.
Biden should also ignore GOP op-ed writers like Jennifer Rubin who are constantly pushing centrist VP candidates
Karen Bass is 1000x better on Israel / Palestine compared to Harris  Kamala Harris co-sponsored legislation with the senate GOP to condemn the Obama-Biden administration because they criticized Israeli land grabs.  Terrible foreign policy record
If Harris‚Äôs record didn‚Äôt make Biden‚Äôs team nervous, nobody would be talking about Karen Bass right now.
We f*cked up. Big time. At least Biden has a somewhat-improved climate plan. It's a start, but, we're f*cked. We have wasted decades. #ClimateEmergency #Biden2020Landslide #Biden2020 #ClimateActionNow
Really no reason for Biden to rush either as he‚Äôs up in every poll.  VP is always made on how it can benefit the nominees chances so...
If it‚Äôs Wareen ‚Äî&gt; I will donate money and volunteer my times towards the Biden campaign  If it‚Äôs Bass ‚Äî&gt; I will donate to the Biden campaign   If it‚Äôs Harris ‚Äî&gt; I will feel very disappointed
Indeed. But as VP, Biden's route to presidential plausibility was to hug Obama as close as possible. That might not be the case for whoever Biden picks.
Even Biden has talked about this üòí
And Biden will most likely fix it.
Hard feelings about the debate is a really stupid reason not to pick Harris but loyalty seems a rational thing to worry about for Biden. Whoever he picks will prob spend the next 4 years prepping a primary campaign and trying to nudge Biden into not running again.
Respectfully VP Biden, slow down on the Bernie points. Please hold your briefings outside in your yard. I want you to be President. Please come out if the basement. They are holding all of this against you
#Biden should pick #Obama as his #Veep, then resign on January 21st. Talk about making America great again! Remember the Obama years? Robust economy, no pandemic, qualified people working in the White House...ahhh, the good old days
