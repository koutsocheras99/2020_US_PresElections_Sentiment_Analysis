I‚Äôm pretty pragmatic so I never expected Biden to choose Nina Turner or Jayapal, but hopefully the left is a real force that can push the Biden administration towards our side
I‚Äôll laugh until I cry if Biden chooses Condoleezza Rice
Damn I‚Äôm impressed that Trump is so fucking awful he got this guy voting for Biden
honestly.. You seem very reasonable. I appreciate the Civil convo. Biden sucks.. There's no lying there about that. However trump is prolly the biggest liar and the books that bolton and trumps niece wrote about him are pretty scary if they're true. Trump just has a BAD history
Not true... Bernie Sanders people do not love you, in fact the majority have committed to voting for Biden. You have seen all of the results and you know you were going to lose the election and now you were just preoccupied and once again calling names and lying!!
That was what they feared about Joe Biden too, and somehow it wasn't viewed as a deal breaker then.
Knowing Biden, he'll choose Rice, which is üò†
They only call landlines and have Trump with a giant lead with over 65 while many polls have Biden ahead or close. Not a very good pollster. Also never trust a poll that has no undecided.
won‚Äôt be doing much winning this Fall. You might have 10 seats in the House, the Senate will probably be slightly in your favor (51-49) and Biden will be president.  Good luck with that.
Joe Biden narrows down his VP list, with Karen Bass emerging as one of several key contenders
What I have been saying for awhile. BIDEN has to win so big that it‚Äôs uncontested.  I wish we could think of an out excuse for the baby so he still thinks he‚Äôs wonderful. Not that I care about him but I care about our country. Like he‚Äôs been offered a World Consult position.
This is a myth that the  keeps floating which is not only false, but the exact OPPOSITE. Biden wants to throw more funding at police. He‚Äôs said that several times and Chris Wallace, of FOX NEWS, verified that.
The risk to our democracy with vote by mail in states that haven‚Äôt done it much before is that the rejection rate is fairly high. It could flip a state to Trump if most Biden voters use the mail and most Trump supporters go in person.
And I'll keep doing it, because this is not a normal election. We aren't trying to defeat a normal Republican. If Trump gets another term, there is the real possibility that we will no longer live in a democracy. Vote against Trump, if you need to. I'll be voting FOR Biden.
A book about radical associations and a family‚Äôs self-dealing ‚Äî is it about Biden or Trump?
Under your logic, Biden broke the law on the list. I just want to clarify, you do hold Biden to the same standards, correct? If not, then we don't need to continue this discussion.
As a joke, my kids bought me a bunch of hand-held signs saying NO (my default response). I told them I would plant them in the front yard to show my opinion of Trump and Biden.
Democrats should put up Biden signs.  That is all.
It's it too much to ask the parties to switch tickets to Pence-Trump and Anyone But Biden-Biden?
No worries! It was 13 years ago so easy to forget.   Barack being a man definitely didn't stop those attacks. Ambition is ONLY reserved for cishetero white men: even in the Biden article from last year, Barack picked him, in part, because he promised he didn't want to be POTUS.
How many will starve to death before Jan 20?  How many will die of COVID?  How many will be kidnapped or killed by rogue ‚Äúfederal agents‚Äù?  Why won‚Äôt  and  #ImpeachTrumpAgain?  (We CAN still elect Biden in November!!)

If Biden is unwilling to debate, should there be a delay?
Biden calls for 100 percent clean electricity by 2035. Here‚Äôs how far we have to go.
Brown‚Äôs win was underwhelming for a solid incumbent in a pretty good D year; Renacci got way closer to 56%(!) than we expected. Doesn‚Äôt mean Biden CAN‚ÄôT win it but I can‚Äôt imagine it‚Äôs going to be within 5 of the National popular vote like from 1976 (at least)-2012
We need Joe Biden...a man seasoned by personal pain to understand the pain our country is going through after 4 years of neglect. We need a man seasoned in law &amp; diplomacy to lead our country towards the fulfillment of its ideals &amp; potential.
I‚Äôm still sad that  is no longer a candidate for president, and my heart sings at the idea of #BidenWarren2020, but I‚Äôll vote for Joe Biden proudly. It would be good to have a decent, competent leader in the White House. #Biden2020

If Biden doesn‚Äôt pick ME then I‚Äôm voting for Trump.
It‚Äôs almost like the average democratic pundit thinks Hillary is the better Candidate vs Biden when it‚Äôs just clearly not true.
Can Bernie get her to 1/3 of the vote? I'd bet against it, even if Biden makes it to that magical number
WE CAN IMPEACH TRUMP AND BARR, AND STILL ELECT JOE BIDEN.
Fact check: Trump makes at least 19 false and misleading claims in wild anti-Biden monologue - CNNPolitics -
Technically this is the ultimate of what Biden would want, he doesn‚Äôt really want this clown‚Äôs endorsement but he wants her to get her fellow clowns to vote for him nonetheless
Good thread outlining Biden's commitment to combatting homelessness and ending the housing shortage.
The Biden campaign's strategy is to put as little attention on Joe Biden as possible. That is completely intentionally.
And Biden recently said that he is being viewed as the antithesis of Trump. And he'll win because of it.
And when you keep saying, "those people wouldn't have voted for Biden anyway," that's exactly the problem. There are only two viable choices. Anyone who wants Trump out is sabotaging that cause if they don't vote for Biden.
I haven't said that people who don't want to vote for Biden are instead voting for Trump. I'm saying that each liberal who refuses to vote for the Dem candidate makes it more likely the Repub wins. Voter suppression + protest votes + staying home = Trump wins.
I agree with George Will. Opinion | Biden‚Äôs election will end national nightmare 2.0 - The Washington Post
I think yang thinks anything is better than trump. Even if its Joe fucking biden. Baby steps.
I didn't accept your premise. Its bullshit, like all of your arguments.  I like it that you didn't deny Biden's dementia.  Now I'm going to block you because you're not adding any value to this conversation,  or the world, really.
Oh, no, I don't think she's a bad pick. I think she's THE pick lol I think she's the best pick. I'm saying if Biden picks her, Trump will lose and he can go back to being a scammer (what he was before being *elected)
Biden picks her as his VP, it's over. He keeps telling the Times how much he misses his regular life lol
Ah yes, the racist card. When you run out of things, always accuse them of racism.   You're a vacuous fool. You've been stuck in academia too long and probably retired too late.   Head into the sunset and live out the rest of your sad life as you descend into dementia with Biden.
You really have never looked at the difference Trump has made in 3 years for minorities that Biden hasn‚Äôt been able to make in 20 years.
What is this 90% Seattle proper for Biden, 8% Hawkins 1.9% Maoist 0.1% Trump?
Biden says he will choose his running mate next week
Do you trust Joe Biden?
probably was written up by Biden campaign IF he chooses her and was mistakenly put out. She's a finalist, nothing more
here's a really easy issue for Biden to rally the youths
It‚Äôs gonna be Kamala Harris. That‚Äôs going to tank Biden‚Äôs candidacy. Nobody is going to vote for someone who locked up people for weed possession.
I'm saying that those people, who refuse to vote for Biden *because he's not progressive enough,* are helping Trump. I'll grant you we have a choice btwn center-right corporate Dems vs. far-right corrupt GOP. Not the choice I wanted, but I know which one needs to win.
The Court is not a finder of fact. A trial would be necessary for finding an objection to the state rule.  Biden is free under Dignitatis Humanae to not claim any affiliation with the Vatican or the bishops. They need to stay in their lane.
If they can leave some of the local voter targeting to down-ballot Dem candidates, the party can increase turnout without Biden needing to spend time and resources in the state. In essence, the House candidates act as his ground operations. Very smart play. And unique.

We deserve better than Trump, Biden and the people who hold an office right now. We need someone who will stand up against Wall Street and stand for the common people. üëÄüëÄüëÄ
Biden wasn‚Äôt gonna loosen up on it after we started seeing this stuff
Liberals/progressives who protest Biden by not voting or voting third party reduce the chance that he will get the votes he needs to win. If he doesn't win, Trump does.
Biden victory could yield some opportunities for oil, gas sector
Listening to  Bannon on Squawk Box. Expect Beijing-Biden to become part of the gop campaign lexicon.
Im blocking you. You ARE crazy. You hear messianic voices that nobody else hears. People take into account all the BS that you keep preaching. You are hurting Biden‚Äôs chances. As May said   I CAN‚ÄôT ANYMORE!
Why would you hope she loses? If you read through this excerpt, she is more of action than words. She wants Biden to win and not Trump., and for that I Love her!!!
Me: What team did Villanova beat in the 2016 NCAA Basketball championship? Joe Biden:
I have a Joe Biden joke but I, I, I forgot it.
!!!!!  Biden‚Äôs the walking dead!
In other words, staying home also = Trump. Anything that's not voting for Biden = Trump. I think you made my point.
I‚Äôm hope so,  but I fear Biden will start screwing up or the democrats get lazy on Election Day
You must have a tough choice. Biden is pro-choice and Donald Trump is a reality TV star who doesn‚Äôt understand much of anything but he needs money to pay his debt service.
Tell Biden to debate Trump if he turns in his taxes.  No taxes, no debate
That‚Äôs not good for Biden.
Rice has foreign experience, complementing Biden's more domestic approach to policy.   Harris has the domestic experience (although not the best record) to handle and, fingers crossed, address the policing issue this country faces.  Rice-VP; Harris-AG.
Biden‚Äôs faith outreach has been so much better than Hillary‚Äôs, it‚Äôs crazy. And Hillary is a devout believer. Absolute malpractice by that campaign in 2016.
Given the fact that that will never happen until we have Ranked Choice Voting, will you still consider it optimal when those votes come from Biden and result in another Trump term?
Thank you. I am focused on getting progressives elected down-ballot. We need Biden to salvage SCOTUS, if nothing else.
I‚Äôd also accept Biden-Demings.
You call yourself a real man &amp; Patriot? Joe Biden is a real man...SNIFFING LITTLE GIRLS, selling out our country to pack his loser son‚Äôs nostrils with cocaine, finger blasting staffers, loving China üá®üá≥, making bankruptcy hard for avg Peeps, BIDEN=SCUM!
Ed Markey is a Joe Biden Democrat
For sure, and that has a lot to do with many people from PA, OH and other northern, red states moving to MD. But it‚Äôs still safe to assume Biden carries at least 60% of the vote in MD for the time being

I just wanna Let Shawn know that Biden is about to pick his VP
If you follow me please follow Joe Biden. #ResistanceTaskForce
Biden is letting Trump implode.
You don't have to be Chris Dodd to notice that  is self-serving and puts ambition first. I was in a room with all Black women when she dropped out, &amp; to a person they were relieved. Biden wants someone to serve him like he served President Obama. That's a bad thing?
None of potential running mates are ‚Äúincompetent‚Äù by comparison to Trump. Consider your vote for anyone but Biden a vote for Trump.
"Dodd told a longtime Biden supporter and donor, who relayed the exchange to POLITICO on condition of anonymity."  So.... Sen. Harris lands a punch publicly in a debate = gimmick.  Anon source talks üí© = honorable?
Chip in to elect Joe Biden and get a cool We Want Joe sticker
This election is about who can talk the least and therefore say less idiotic things. Biden is winning that strategy right now.
#Biden2020   Biden won‚Äôt debate Trump but vows to SNIFF 100 little girls leading up to election. Biden says ‚Äúthe kids would reach in the pool and rub the water up and down my legs ‚Äú what a scumbag....
This pandemic was China‚Äôs fault, in bed with Obama and Biden for 8 years!  Biden is Puppet, others making his VP choice for him ecsuse he is incompetent.
I'll be shocked if   does the interview... Prove me wrong Joe!
Considering that the Republican House candidate didn‚Äôt even get 20% of the vote in 2018, Blumenauer is beyond safe going into November. Trump‚Äôs recent antics in Portland will likely only galvanize Biden skeptics against Trump, as if Oregon was ever anything but safely Democratic.
All that money you spent on poisonous ads just increased Biden‚Äôs lead.  People are done with all the hate and division.
MAGA 2020.. Oppose you.. you had 8 years and set us Back. Biden is a puppet with socialists/communists as his puppeteers . Go to your basement with Joe!

#cancelculture #snowflakes It wouldn‚Äôt be a disaster at all. Get out of your bubble. Tom Brady wouldn‚Äôt mind. Most don‚Äôt care either way but the corrupt media &amp; spineless jellyfish blame Trump for everything despite Clinton‚Äôs , Biden &amp; Obama being in control for YEARS.
Well I‚Äôd like to see ol Joey Biden wriggle his way outta this one.

Be careful... Your discrimination is showing.  You post seems to imply that people who are Bi-Polar or have other mental issues are incapable of making an informed decision.  You say Kanye doesn‚Äôt give a F about me, but you somehow think Trump or Biden does?  You are the fool.
So... they‚Äôre claiming Hitler was Socialist? Or that Biden is Fascist?
Clinton basically hit her RCP polling averages in most key states. Trump won by over performing his polls, not because Clinton‚Äôs support was overstated.  Biden is around 49% in key states. If he  hits 50%, he wins even if the polls are as ‚Äúwrong‚Äù as they were in ‚Äò16
Bro trumps dad was literally in the KKK any picture of him with his dad is more damning than some fake ass pic of Biden
All it will take is people thinking Biden was going to win by a landslide &amp; staying home instead of voting for him to loose. UNLESS the vote totals are OVERWHELMINGLY in favor of Biden - &lt;3% - they will be able to sow doubt. Don‚Äôt give them the opportunity.

And, if Trump loses, you don't fear that his investigation will be swept under the rug by a Dem AG?  Biden would be bringing back all of Obama's cabinet.  Durham would be gone.  So it all needs to come out before election, regardless of optics.
my favorite viral instagram posts are the ones that are like, ‚Äúlook, biden sucks, not gonna argue with you there, but anyway here are 20 reasons why he doesn‚Äôt‚Äù
I live in Montgomery County, MD. There‚Äôs more Biden signs here, but this is a deep blue county.
It's July 25th and Joe Biden still doesn't know it's July!
And you think your world will be good with the puppet Biden and his puppeteers.  AOc and the Squad, Sanders, Bozo Bezo, and the entire Deep State.. good luck!
Watch Trump try and strong arm Joe Biden to go easy on him if he leaves office without a fuss.
Vote fir Biden or get 4 more years of Trump
At the rate  is progressing, Ingraham has nothing to worry about. Trump will destroy America before Biden takes office.
Biden plans to spend $450B over 10-yrs on initiatives allowing people to choose to receive care in community-based settings. He wants to use Medicaid funding to provide the full cost for each person w/a disability who‚Äôs on a waiting list.

"I'm 'Biden' my time cause that's the kind of guy I am" ("Glen Miller Story"). It happens to be OUR time also. It's cruel to waste time. ['Everyone' knows that Biden is merely a placeholder for Hillary (don't they)?]
If they don't make all of this public before the election there's a reasonable chance Biden will win and then quash the investigation. Why put in the effort for nothing?
Your accusory claims are laughable. You sound like you‚Äôre becoming more desperate to try and pin something on Obama and Biden to try and make them look bad so you‚Äôll look good. It isn‚Äôt working. You‚Äôre very sad.
In 2016, Kent County was a rare part of Michigan where Hillary improved from 2012. She lost Kent County by just 3%, and it seems ripe for the flipping for Joe Biden this year. Gretchen Whitmer was the first Dem gov. candidate to win Kent County since 1986.

Ed Markey is a Joe Biden Democrat I mean no disrespect but look at their careers
It's alot of the media, who wouldn't be doing this if it was two men.   Because had Biden just picked a woman instead of making a show of picking one, alot of this is probably mitigated tbh.
These are all pretty weak. ‚ÄúBiden gets seriously ill‚Äù is the only one I‚Äôm worried about.
When have any men up for VP been put through the vetting process and pitted against each other to where you have to put down one of them to uplift the one you prefer? It seems that expectation only applies to the women &amp; Biden set that up by saying he'd pick a woman as oppose to
Question: IF Biden picked a Republican running mate (you would have to guess a moderate Republican), would you be more or less likely to vote for him?
That seems a little optimistic but I maintain that the 10 R since at least 1964 counties I named (also James City Co,VA) are very plausible Biden wins and Oklahoma is one

I'm in deep blue Montgomery County, MD... I've seen a few Biden signs.  Trump supporters keep a low profile here.
Voting in November for me is going to be easy. I've got easy mail in ballot options, in an easy Biden state. But for the people who are actually going to be needed to swing this election- it's going to take hours of misery, intimidation, and bureaucratic bollocks.
Why do you want Trump to win Texas and Texas to remain the province of the right longer? Biden‚Äôs gonna run strongest in TX no question so his performance is what matters for future investment?
Me Me Me... hope Obama and Biden are at the top of the list!!! The slime bags
You clearly didn‚Äôt watch the segment that spawned him trending if you think he still supports Bernie over Biden.
The betting markets still give Trump a 40% chance of winning. Let‚Äôs make sure to keep working and get 270 votes for Biden.
BIDEN IS SO OUT OF TOUCH.  44 years of turning his head away and not seeing anything.
I totally agree, keeping Biden in the basement and no answering questions won‚Äôt work. Hillary tried the same and didn‚Äôt work either.
That's not going to happen. Hunter get billions from China. The bidens are compromised and Biden said China was no threat.   Conversely, Trump has spoken clearly on trade issue with China.
This is what Russia evolved to under Trump‚Äôs watch.  has empowered Putin on so many levels, including the placement of bounties on our soldiers. Help organizations such as  and others end this nightmare! #AmericaOrTrump #Biden
It would be very unlikely Joe Biden carries this district, and McMorris Rodgers is viewed as a way longshot for Democrats that could only occur in a big wave year. They have much easier, better targets to prioritize than WA-05. Expect McMorris Rodgers to hang on.
Bro who is defending Biden here? Trump is a racist and Biden has a racist past and has exhibited racial ambivalence during the campaign. Trump is a racist dude. He literally pushed the racist narrative that Obama wasn‚Äôt born in the US. And thats just ONE example.
I don't think Biden is playing 4D chess here, but the counter of "Hey, at least our guy didn't own slaves!" isn't the compelling argument they seem to think it is.
#OpeningDay Every baseball stadium should fill their seats with cardboard cutouts of Obama and Biden.
Honestly genuinely no clue. As someone who is the radical left I would genuinely love it if joe Biden was actually pushing for most of these things.
You try to say anything you possibly can to discredit Obama and Biden because you can‚Äôt let go. You‚Äôll say anything to try and make your supporters want to support you still, but look what a shambles you‚Äôve made of this country. You don‚Äôt deserve reelection. We deserve better.
It‚Äôs currently Trump‚Äôs America. Biden will clean this up
So wonderful to have two real statesmen talking about the issues confronting us and actually offer solutions! ‚ù§Ô∏è Vice President Biden &amp; President Obama. Vote for Joe Biden for President if you love our country. It‚Äôs our patriotic duty to right a ship tilting to extreme right
#ImVoting4BidenBecause I‚Äôd like the next 4 years to not suck as much. Biden is by no means my favorite choice but I‚Äôll take him over who we have now. At least then we can look to better candidates down the road. We have to start somewhere ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Jill Biden still is unhappy with her, which is usually the death kneel for applicants
your preaching video to Biden in the new ad video is disgusting. Both of you LOSERS!
This is just plain up is down, 2+2=5, wrong. If Trump had handled the response competently he would be cruising to re-election and Biden wouldn't stand a chance. There are still voters who are influenced by reality.
Hot take: Ed Markey and Joe Biden are both total generic Democrat and the clowns who differentiate are clowns
you are a failed President and I had voted for you. Now you hope to continue your FAILED, Deep State legacy by supporting an incompetent Biden. You have set this country back YEARS in race relations and you continue to do so.. you are disgusting!
It‚Äôs all to get Biden elected at all costs.
That's not true. In the case of Biden his dementia is completely apparent.  But that's the trick isn't it? Say a drug addict called you a drug addict and you rightfully called BS on that and pointed out that it's them, not you that's the addict.   That's what's happening here.
Like the idea of universal preK and a large, refundable tax credit for child care? Vote #Biden2020
Biden has a long history of making up stories in political speeches. I'm guessing this is just the latest in a long line of them.  The media called him out on it in the 80s strongly enough it should have ended his career, but Democrats rarely pay a political price for anything.
Biden is gonna suck as much as trumpOh please! Kamala will be the VP nominee and you know it. Biden has done nothing wrong. Like Kamala said (when she implied Biden was a racist), ‚Äúit‚Äôs all politics‚Äù.
Thanks much for the mention!
Because we can do better than anyone who's moderate enough for Biden to want as VP
Okay, but this weird shit is def going to make it easier for me to fill-in the bubble for Biden.
She won't run for president, and she has the most progressive record that doesn't make Biden's wall Street donors antsy. She's also not a cop
IF BIDEN IS ARRESTED OCT 31, -NOV 2, DEMS WOULD LOSE THE RACE!
I just want to say, I love your tweets. here's a fun question. Who would you like to see a Josh Lyman in a Biden admin? #Biden2020
Politics and Obama picked you ain‚Äôt black Biden as his VP.....hmmm
It's always weird when I see people criticize Biden's campaign strategy. In an era of hyperpartisanship and negativity, all news is bad news. If you do what he's done and induce a coma until November your opponent has nothing to attack and he's the one who recieves a critical eye
BIDEN FAILS WITH ZOOM! HE FITS IN WITH KIDS THAT GO TO SCHOOL ONLINE WITH ZOOM! KIDS FAIL 77% IN ENGLISH AND 50% IN MATH WITH ZOOM! US NATIONAL FRONTLINE DOCTORS BROUGHT THESE FACTS TO US! FRONTLINE DOCTORS ALSO KILLED FACIE/BIRX FEARS OF VIRUS IN AMERICA! IMPORT

Obama was corrupt ! You ain‚Äôt black Biden is a bobble head and a Trojan horse that is an empty vessel ready for doing whatever Sanders and AOC and quid pro quo pelosi and Schumer and Robert Francis (beto) bozo Orourke want him to do  !
Biden wants to kill an economic gold mine
You ain‚Äôt black Biden is a bobble head and a Trojan horse that is an empty vessel that Sanders and AOC and  pelosi and Schumer and Robert Francis (beto) bozo Orourke use Xi of China likes Biden. Xi of China does  NOT like President Donald J Trump. Why? EZ  Xi can‚Äôt control him !
Oh...I see.  BIDEN was VP FOR OBAMA....LETS LOOK WHAT HE DID IN OFFICE ALREADY... URANIUM DEAL...FALSELY JAILED RANCHERS...FBI SHOT FATHER AND TOOK THEIR LAND FOR ITS URANIUM WHICH WAS SOLD TO RUSSIA...OUR ENEMY...IRAN DEAL..GIVE MONEY, WEAPONS, AND TRAINING IN RETURN FOR NOTHING
Biden released a statement that said he wants the prosecution of the believers of a political ideology. He probably only meant that he wants  the prosecution of some undefined, inherently  violent group of people who are responsible for all the trouble at protests.
I had multiple people reply that the statement doesn't say that. Well, no. Biden may have meant something different, and we may all agree that he's dumb that he probably meant something different, but the statement still said what it said, and the refusal to admit that is weird
I understand that Biden is dumb and doesn't know what words mean, so whenever he says something wrong, we're supposed to imagine him saying something different and only react to that. I also simply refuse to allow my standards to be that low for the president. Like, c'mon now.
Convenient that we only report on deaths, not decline in hospitalizations, how many have recovered etc. The most irresponsible reporting by the media on all fronts. All because you don‚Äôt like the President. Would you report the same if Biden was President right now?
The amount of white people in this thread fantasizing about an end to Biden and trump winning is...predictable
obama didn't want to hear it and Biden don't  know shit
BIDEN WOULD KILL US ENERGY! BIDEN WOULD TAKE ALL TAX BREAKS AWAY, NOJOBS, NO GUNS, DESTROYS AMERICA! VOTE PRES TRUMP AND SEND BIDEN TO HELL!
#FredDems - We have Biden signs at our new local Democratic HQ! -
You and Alyssa should do a follow up episode of That‚Äôs the Ticket after Biden announces his VP. I found the whole thing very interesting would love if you‚Äôd follow up after.
If Biden gets Texas that would be big for his electoral vote. Texas is the 2nd most populated state behind California.
Lol, Yeah I'm a POC and I"m not voting for #JoeBiden . While I can't stop you from rationalizing your choice, voting for Joe Biden is actually the greater evil. It's been the rationale of political strategy that's brought us to this awful choice in the first place.
Defund the police detail of the demon rats üêÄ (Democrat‚Äôs) and you ain‚Äôt black Biden too  !
So if Biden is not in prison by October, then BDA is a confirmed LARP?
Biden's going to say "can't, coronavirus"
FEAR MONGERING &amp; LYING  WANTS YOU TO BELIEVE THAT CRIME &amp; CHAOS WILL BE WORSE UNDER BIDEN  GASLIGHTING AMERICA!   TO DO THIS YOU HAVE TO IGNORE THE FACT THAT CRIME &amp; CHAOS IS SURGING ON TRUMP'S WATCH - DURING A PANDEMIC!   IT'S JUST TRUMP SHIFTING BLAME AGAIN!  DUMP TRUMP!
Put the police union will still endorse Joe Crow Pedo Biden.
You ain‚Äôt black Biden is a bobble head

Her statement might be the best argument for a Biden Win. All the progress the Trump Administration has made toward the destruction of the American people and the nation.
To all of you so called Democrat who aren't voting for Biden if it's not your choice of candidates. Trump has a message for you.
AG Barr is not afraid of the demon rats üêÄ (Democrat‚Äôs) and speaks his own mind unlike you ain‚Äôt black Biden who is a bobble head and does EXACTLY what AOC wants Biden to do !

JUST REMEMBER THAT AS  INCOMPETENCE GROWS &amp; HIS POLLING NUMBERS GET WORSE - THE LIES, CONSPIRACY THEORIES, AND CON JOBS WILL GET BIGGER &amp; BOLDER FED BY TRUMP'S DESPERATION.  GET OUT THE VOTE - WE CAN'T LET UP NOW!  VOTE BIDEN, VOTE FOR OUR DEMOCRACY, CONSTITUTION, &amp; COUNTRY
You ain‚Äôt black Biden is a bobble head
You ain‚Äôt black Biden is a bobble head and a demon rat (Democrat) !
Nah, Larry will vote for Biden. I live in Maryland and I‚Äôm a Democratic. Hogan was pretty aggressive when the pandemic started. There were multiple times he went against Trump and followed the science. He didn‚Äôt give in.
The problem is that Joe Biden is 600 years old and he hasn't absorbed any new information about drugs since a private conversation with Richard Nixon in the presidential sauna in 1969
Like they tell is we have to vote for Biden cause he can stop the madness but they dont want anything better. They just want to be on top of the heap of corpses I'm sick of it!!! Help! Someone help
This is the right move I think. Biden is fundamentally hostile to the left, so if we don't set a tone day 1 of his administration that he won't be automatically getting the left in party-line votes, well Simpson-Bowles pt 2 is going to be painful, and only the beginning.
Biden, cause I haven't done shit as a senator or a VP, aligned myself with segregationists, supported bussing of blacks, I need to lock in the black vote and the woman vote to win, so I will make my VP a black woman, because I can't win on myself or my platform...
Biden will Make America Great Again.
He‚Äôs apologized, expanded his intelligence and changed mindsets. You should let go of the long ago past. Believe it or not, you can evolve like Joe Biden and many other wise ppl have.
LMFAO they‚Äôre saying this like fucking BIDEN is going to win. That mf is going to forget where he is halfway through a debate. He‚Äôs gonna show up running for city mayor. He‚Äôs gonna hav   What happens if Donald Trump refuses to accept the election results?
Thank la Andy!
This. And why in the hell does Biden even have any old white men on the vetting team? What the hell would they know about smart women in politics?
Agreed. Biden was frankly a bad choice (not the worst, but not good) of a wide variety of much better options...but somehow he's the one that came out on top and is our best first step to correcting the damage already done by Trump and heading off his opportunity to do even more.
Oh please!!! The party has NOT lost standing with black voters. I love Kamala but you do her no favors with your constant whining. Biden is the nominee and he has earned the right (by winning) to pick anyone he wants.
Actually...Pelosi and Schumer got there first...Biden already has money from China and Ukraine, so he doesn't need any

ONE THEORY IS THAT MEDIA SAYS THAT BIDEN WINS BUT U ARE ACTUALLY THE WINNER BY BIG NUMBERS. DEMS SET UP A SEPARATE GOVT AND LEAVE REPUBLICANS BY THEMSELVES IN A ONE PARTY TAKE OVER W/MEDIA! DEMS AND MEDIA ARE DESPARATE BUT VIRUS DISCUSSION W/DOCTORS  WH BIGGIE
Fuck Biden! They aren't peaceful and they aren't protesters! This is an insurrection people! Time for armed feds (troops)!
Wow. This was such a tone deaf statement. Biden doesn‚Äôt need to spend a penny, you‚Äôre doing the job on yourself.
IT IS AN LIE WHEN MEDIA SAYS THAT BIDEN IS LEADING DUE TO WAY VIRUS HANDLED. PRES TRUMP HAS THE MEDS NOW IN HIS QUIVER! HE HAS STAMPED OUT THE DEATHS WITH VIRUS, AND BIDEN WILL NOT TALK AT ALL INDICATING MORE THAN EVER THAT BIDEN HAS NOTHING BETTER TO OFFER AMERICA ON ANY ISSUE!
FOX IS STILL LYING ABOUT PRES TRUMP IN BATTLEGROUND STATES! OUR POLLS SHOW PRES TRUMP LEADING BIDEN BY 17 POINTS!
That‚Äôs okay because joe Biden is going to kill the suburbs, so everyone will come back to the city I guess üôÑ
BIDEN HAS DIMENTIA PRETTY BAD. HE IS DODGING THE INTERVIEWS LIKE A FLY DOGES FLYSWATTERS! HE IS AFRAID TO HAVE INTERVIEWS FOR HE KNOWS THAT HE IS FAILING! HE DOES NOT HAVE A CLUE NOR PLATFORM THAT IS SUITABLE FOR ANYTHING FOR AMERICA! HE IS A DO-NOTHING CANDIDATE!
You are aware that Biden is about the least "radical" democrat alive today, right? Compared to the democrats we actually want representing America's interests, Joe Biden is basically a right-wing conservative...
Your supporters are finally waking up and voting for Biden!! You‚Äôve lied to them too many times! Don‚Äôt you get it?!? We don‚Äôt want you as president anymore  !!
PA RESIDENTS ARE PISSED AT PA GOV AND HEALTH DIRECTOR! NO PEACE YET IN PA! PRES TRUMP IS NOW LEADING BIDEN!

Wasn't Joe Biden was the Chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee &amp; wasn't Barr the AG during the height of the BCCI investigations &amp; they both just covered everything up?
Maybe Biden will get the people to contain this disease and he can probably be the voice of reason.
My point is what is that point of a 4 year plan to turn off money that could just be turned back on after  the next election? Unless they *know* Biden can't win for some reason, &amp; preordained elections = fake elections. If there truly is a plan to bring justice, it's now or never
If no high level prosecutions happen in Aug then they can't happen before the election given the 60 day rule, &amp; if they're waiting until after the election it means they're risking it not being done under Biden, which means either they aren't prosecuting or the elections are fake
WHEN IT COMES TO LAW AND ORDER, PRES TRUMP SURPASSES OBAMA AND BIDEN AND BLM AND ALL THE WHOLE DAMNED DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST PARTY BY A COUNTRY MILE! IF THE MOBS WANTED TO HAVE A TWIST IN THEIR ASS, BE THERE TODAY!

Biden as a campaigner isn't going to come to a decision point and pick something other than telling progressives to eat their vegetables. That's how you show you're responsible. He may be more amendable after the election, but not now.
Progressive groups finding her acceptable is a pretty good argument that she's not in serious consideration by Biden

Does Joe Biden have the power to call off the mob in Portland? Will the mob respond to him, or will it ignore him? And if he becomes President, what will he do about the mob, its thuggery, and its bullying? #purplepolExactly. People act like corruption began on 1/20/17 when fact it's been there for quite a while. Trump just puts an ugly face on it. Plus, when it comes to a guy like Biden, even if he's marginally better than Trump in some areas, he's not exactly a dyed-in-the-wool progressive.
1. I'm waiting for the veep announcement tbh.  2. I've donated at times when Biden promised a sticker and so far 1 sticker and that just said "Beat Trump".
THE SWAMP WILL BE DRAINED ON NOVEMBER 3RD, ON THAT DAY JOE BIDEN WILL BE ELECTED PRESIDENT.
It‚Äôs been reported she has no intention to be in politics, even though she virtually guarantees a win and would be a shoe in 2024  If Biden was ‚Äúlosing‚Äù I think she‚Äôs consider, but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôll happen

That's for sure  That's why the choice has to be Joe Biden.
These are my views as well. I fought for Warren‚Äôs candidacy but defer to the Black community that surged for Biden and to the historic need for a WOC on the ticket. I also trust that Warren is working towards a position of maximal impact (that could take many possible forms).
Thank you, thank you, thank you! Biden for president!!

Yup! Because it‚Äôs the right thing to do.  It would also be a great opportunity for me to slap a ‚ÄúBiden 2020‚Äú sticker on the back of their car...
How low Biden will go? Are you fucking for real? Trump will do anything to steal this election. Joe Biden isn't saying anything that the rest of America doesn't believe.
We must elect Biden, a Democratic Senate and hold the House.  Then we need to investigate Trump and those eight Senators that went to Russia in depth.

Just realized that Obama's mantra was "Lead from Behind," &amp; Biden's mantra is "Build Back Better." Seems that both Obama &amp; Biden were/are fixated with the posterior side of leadership instead of active, out-front bold leadership-Like President Trump has been doing for 3-1/2 yrs!
Biden condemns Trump‚Äôs use of executive orders. Wow. He forgets the Obama admin
Biden isn‚Äôt embarrassing himself in this press conference. But he looks and sounds frail, and there‚Äôs no tough questions or follow-ups
Decency, morality, honesty &amp; a desire to make this country better for us all. After 4 years of listening to Trump's hate, bigotry, racism and lies, hearing Joe Biden is the change I need to hear. The anxiety, anger &amp; depression trump has caused has affected millions of Americans.
OK folks, I have one thing to say.  President Joe Biden will have amazing consultants if he needs them.
Actually, he did answer the specific question if Biden has a clear win (not like Bush Gore) could Trump refuse it. Barr said no.  You might want to take a look at your replay.
Trump says he won‚Äôt go and pay respects to John Lewis at Capitol

Biden's not in office dipshit.  150,000 dead. Millions sick &amp; dying. Millions unemployed &amp; facing eviction after standing 8 hours in lines at food banks. Trillions added 2 the national debt handed 2 the wealthy &amp; trump's business.  This is trump's Amerikkka. Retweet that.
I see Joe Biden all the time.  You must not be looking.  But then again, you're a republican and they just "hide" the truth as a code of conduct.  LIARS!!
Biden isn‚Äôt president. How could this be his fault?
Total lunacy.  The president was targeted with fake info by corrupted cops, and you want *him* to resign.  Or to be replaced by the fast-declining Biden.  Sure...whatever.  Nothing can get through to those who choose to hate the President irrationally.

How long has she been in Congress? What has she done for black people? She has lined her pockets well, and paid her family members, like Biden, but her constituents still have no power. She could have fixed it.  Can someone ask what she's done for 30  years?
Biden doesn't know what month it is and you want him to be in charge?  I realize the plan is to put in a shadow government, but he has to be able to able to function until the election.

Do not worry. He will have no choice but to leave. When the results are validated, if he doesn't leave by the time Biden is sworn in, the Secret Service will remove him.  He will have no authority.  His base is dwindling his polls are in the 30s.

Adds nothing to Biden with FP experience, which he has.

Trump's polls down to 35% nationally. Even Republicans know you're trying to start a dictatorship. Once Biden's in control, the whole lot of you will go down. I vote for Guantanamo, nice lodging don't you think.
Biden doesn't know what lockdown is! He is not going to be the candidate.  There is something much worse planned.
Imprisoning merely for political purposes should never be done.  I sincerely hope that Biden, if elected, does not pull a Ford-Nixon with respect to Trump‚Äôs crimes.
I agree. When Biden wins by a landslide we can start to make America great again.
Thanks but we are good with electing Joe Biden and your bigotry makes it oh so easy!!!!
Plenty of Biden signs available now. We have 2 in our front yard and will add a third with the VP candidate name. #VoteBlueToEndThisNightmare

My thought Trump he will not concede even if Biden beats him by a blow out. He will use his power and Bill Barr to make sure that he and his spawn and Bill Barr cannot be sued afterwards, in order to have a peaceful transfer of power. Remember where you heard it.
Spent the day with a good friend. They said they thought 45 must be reelected, Biden would mean we would have a socialist state. They were also upset about removing confederate statues, re-naming schools. I am so disappointed. Sad.

Knock it off Trump.... You are so full of bullshit, no one listens to you any longer... Biden's not going to destroy neighborhoods.....Take some advise, stop the lying, and the con man bullshit, it's not funny anymore.
Unlike you, Biden and Obama are more methodical, planned and purposeful in their strategy.    The fact that you are so affected about Obama's support of Biden illustrates not just your jealousy and fear of them, but you don't have anything else to do.  #VoteBidenToSaveAmerica
I will vote for Biden because I want my Grandchildren to grow up in a kinder and gentle Nation. A nation who celebrates diversity and is a role model for the world.

And Biden isn't in any way radical, and even Bernie isn't very far to the left, but the GOP needs and wants and gets a world in which every Democrat is in the superposition of Establishment Corruptocrat and Left Anarchist.
Whoever Joe Biden picks for vice president will be the worst possible person, the worst possible pick. Not because he made the wrong choice. But because in choosing her, he moved her into the position where she needs to be the worst. They will make her the worst.
I hope so to. I can assure you that Muslims will have more support with Biden than trump

He gives them more opportunities to do something for themselves. What has any other President done for this country in the past 40 years. Which Biden has been in office what has he done good for the American people
It‚Äôs funny when I never called u racist I said a fact that Biden is racist. And for to call someone else racist without facts just show what kind of a person u are
Might be in ur neighborhood but that‚Äôs the first time I heard that. What that‚Äôs got to do with Biden actually saying it.
I think Biden is going to tromp the crap out of Donald Trump in November. Donald is finished! The majority of America sees him for the fraud, liar and criminal he is. #BidenLandslide2020

They always go back to Russia lol they can‚Äôt get anything else to argue about. Are they ok with Obama being the most corrupt president ever and Biden being the biggest racist in the country today. U ain‚Äôt black if u don‚Äôt forget Biden lol
Yes- and if he loses, in his anger and madness, what will he do until Biden takes over?
Yes. trump is in very bad territory. I worry what will happen if he somehow got reelected. I don't trust him and hate what he is doing to U.S. and our allies. He is not to be trusted. Allies must protect themselves. Hope Biden is elected. If not, Americans may have to fight.
If trump is re-elected? Yes. But not if we get Biden in office.
I really hope we vote his orange ass out in November. Whether you like Biden or not, he would never resort to openly abducting people on the streets.
Even when he limits the choice for VP to a Woman of Color, Joe Biden still has a vast wealth of talented, qualified candidates to consider! Joe Biden‚Äôs White House cabinet could truly be the best people, a true dream team!
"Until Joe Biden is Bernie Sanders, he's not getting my vote."
Honestly if Biden is in office I‚Äôm cool with it. As long as they help us cross the finish line, they can shit in the punch bowl at the after party
Exactly, fuck trump. Biden 2020b
A great question. Can you imagine if this was a Biden supporter?
I don't know who needs to hear this, but "He's Not Bernie Sanders" would not be a valid reason to invoke the 25th Amendment on Joe Biden.
Biden could never get that many votes! Even in his glory days
So you would rather take your vote away from Biden which is basically giving a vote to tRump.  ‚ÄúA journey of a 1,000 miles begins with a single step.‚Äù  ‚ÄúAny chance of actual progress begins with a single vote.‚Äù  Don‚Äôt act like a spoiled toddler! The Republicans have that already.
üëá#hererightmatters  Trump violated law wanting favor from UA of dirt on Biden or he‚Äôd withhold already approved aid. Trump demanding schools reopen no matter what threatening withholding federal funds if they don‚Äôt just wrong  Trump/complicit GOP asking to be voted out of office
At least he cares more than Biden! TRUMP TRAIN BABY
And Biden didn‚Äôt call his wife ugly or claim his dad was involved in the JFK assassination to get his support. Coward.
Why would that happen to Biden and not trump? Maybe because IF Biden became unfit, he would have real, qualified, cabinet members that are loyal to the country instead of just him and his ego? Yes, I agree with that assessment
I am really looking forward for that, but I don‚Äôt think Chis Wallace is interested. He knows that he will have to ask the hard questions and Biden won‚Äôt have a teleprompter.
You realize that Biden is a puppet right?
I‚Äôll hit you up in November until then Joe Biden 2020‚úåüèæüòÅ
Jamie you can get in on this bet as well! When Biden win you put on a shirt that say good umbr√©s for Biden lol üòÇ ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£
We don‚Äôt even have to bet money now I want something else! When Joe Biden win I want you take a picture in a Joe Biden hat that say trump lost and so have I. Biden 2020?
Ah-- so you FEAR Biden. trump is an imbecile. He is easy to flatter and commands no respect. We are voting him out.
Respectfully, you changed ‚Äúthey‚Äù will destroy YOUR suburbs to ‚ÄúBiden.‚Äù  Sincerely, that won‚Äôt help. You lost suburban women when you separated families &amp; caged children &amp; had your Trump admin lawyers argue ‚Äúsafe &amp; sanitary‚Äù for kids alone doesn‚Äôt mean soap or showers. Cruelty.
Am I cruel for hoping he has be dragged out of the WH?  Or, if he actually attends Biden's inauguration, that the moment he becomes a private citizen, Feds come handcuff him and prep walk him?
Dear Leader's lack of agenda is the biggest threat this country has seen in a long time.  Destroying our civil liberties, sending goon squads into cities, and doing nothing while COVID-19 spread like wildfire.  Yeah Biden's the threat.  #GOPLies #GOPComplicitTraitors #TrumpVirusI‚Äôm pretty pragmatic so I never expected Biden to choose Nina Turner or Jayapal, but hopefully the left is a real force that can push the Biden administration towards our side
I‚Äôll laugh until I cry if Biden chooses Condoleezza Rice
Damn I‚Äôm impressed that Trump is so fucking awful he got this guy voting for Biden
honestly.. You seem very reasonable. I appreciate the Civil convo. Biden sucks.. There's no lying there about that. However trump is prolly the biggest liar and the books that bolton and trumps niece wrote about him are pretty scary if they're true. Trump just has a BAD history
Your husband will have a role in the Biden administration. Another door will open somewhere, maybe in the WH, maybe the Pentagon. He will be able to pursue his passion for public service. You can count on it! #BidenPledgesAllegianceToUS
Not true... Bernie Sanders people do not love you, in fact the majority have committed to voting for Biden. You have seen all of the results and you know you were going to lose the election and now you were just preoccupied and once again calling names and lying!!
That was what they feared about Joe Biden too, and somehow it wasn't viewed as a deal breaker then.
Knowing Biden, he'll choose Rice, which is üò†
They only call landlines and have Trump with a giant lead with over 65 while many polls have Biden ahead or close. Not a very good pollster. Also never trust a poll that has no undecided.
won‚Äôt be doing much winning this Fall. You might have 10 seats in the House, the Senate will probably be slightly in your favor (51-49) and Biden will be president.  Good luck with that.
Assumed she was keeping quiet while being vetted as Biden‚Äôs running mate. Guess this means it‚Äôs a no-go
How about figuring out why some people dont want to vote for Biden because both parties and their policies and the system as a whole have failed them countless of times
Not a loss for me, I don‚Äôt know Bryan Callen and not even a fan of his comedy. I think we actually all agree though, if Bryan Callen should be considered guilty, so should joe Biden. Makes sense to me
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not about Biden though.‚Äù   You refuse to hold any consistent standards. When accusations like this have major consequences, we need rational standards.   It seems you‚Äôre just applying this to people when convenient.
If you feel so strongly about this, is it safe to say you would never vote for Biden? Are we believing all women, or nah?
If we‚Äôre going to save our environment before it‚Äôs too late, we need a leader who believes in science. Thankfully,  has made it a priority to fight climate change while growing our economy. I‚Äôm proud to be on his team. #TeamJoe
Joe Biden narrows down his VP list, with Karen Bass emerging as one of several key contenders
I‚Äôm actually not, and the fact you assume I am bc I don‚Äôt like Biden is telling...
I know, so gross. I‚Äôm assuming you would never vote for Joe Biden then?
Are you sure about that? I feel as if some in media will still be doing the fact check bit and amplifying his tweets, especially if they are aimed at something Biden does. We shouldn‚Äôt care, but I see ‚Äúexcuse‚Äù of, he‚Äôs a former president as reason why to give him press.

"Before Mr. Biden‚Äôs transformation, the question facing voters was 'Do you support Donald Trump?' The question now is, 'Are you willing to endanger the economy and your freedom to end the Trump presidency?'‚Äù    via
What I have been saying for awhile. BIDEN has to win so big that it‚Äôs uncontested.  I wish we could think of an out excuse for the baby so he still thinks he‚Äôs wonderful. Not that I care about him but I care about our country. Like he‚Äôs been offered a World Consult position.
#Cancelled for having a different view based on professional experience.  Imagine when Biden's Communist Party controls everything.
This is a myth that the  keeps floating which is not only false, but the exact OPPOSITE. Biden wants to throw more funding at police. He‚Äôs said that several times and Chris Wallace, of FOX NEWS, verified that.
The risk to our democracy with vote by mail in states that haven‚Äôt done it much before is that the rejection rate is fairly high. It could flip a state to Trump if most Biden voters use the mail and most Trump supporters go in person.
The #GreenNewDeal is straight up communism.  That's what a Biden administration would be all about.
And I'll keep doing it, because this is not a normal election. We aren't trying to defeat a normal Republican. If Trump gets another term, there is the real possibility that we will no longer live in a democracy. Vote against Trump, if you need to. I'll be voting FOR Biden.
Interesting reflection of India‚Äôs concern over Iran-China deal: ‚Äúwe cannot afford to wait for the Majlis to kill this deal, or for Joe Biden to become US president and wean Iran away from China.‚Äù

Under your logic, Biden broke the law on the list. I just want to clarify, you do hold Biden to the same standards, correct? If not, then we don't need to continue this discussion.
Am voting for Joe Biden
As a joke, my kids bought me a bunch of hand-held signs saying NO (my default response). I told them I would plant them in the front yard to show my opinion of Trump and Biden.
Gotta do better ‚Å¶
It's it too much to ask the parties to switch tickets to Pence-Trump and Anyone But Biden-Biden?
Because the Far Left Marxists Dems assume these Globalists are in sync with their Communist agenda. He failed their assumptions. For once this Globalists was honest. Kids are less likely to be stricken with the Chinese virus. The Left is hoping shut down will elect Beijing Biden.
I‚Äôm fine with postponing the election if Biden is unable to debate in person. How can we elect someone that isn‚Äôt even really campaigning?
No worries! It was 13 years ago so easy to forget.   Barack being a man definitely didn't stop those attacks. Ambition is ONLY reserved for cishetero white men: even in the Biden article from last year, Barack picked him, in part, because he promised he didn't want to be POTUS.

Certainly some either oppose Harris, or favor someone else. But the idea that any Biden "allies" oppose Harris because she's too ambitious &amp; wants to be president eventually is, how can I put this,  RIDICULOUS

Good thread outlining Biden's commitment to combatting homelessness and ending the housing shortage.
The Biden campaign's strategy is to put as little attention on Joe Biden as possible. That is completely intentionally.
And Biden recently said that he is being viewed as the antithesis of Trump. And he'll win because of it.
And when you keep saying, "those people wouldn't have voted for Biden anyway," that's exactly the problem. There are only two viable choices. Anyone who wants Trump out is sabotaging that cause if they don't vote for Biden.
I haven't said that people who don't want to vote for Biden are instead voting for Trump. I'm saying that each liberal who refuses to vote for the Dem candidate makes it more likely the Repub wins. Voter suppression + protest votes + staying home = Trump wins.

I think yang thinks anything is better than trump. Even if its Joe fucking biden. Baby steps.
Oh, no, I don't think she's a bad pick. I think she's THE pick lol I think she's the best pick. I'm saying if Biden picks her, Trump will lose and he can go back to being a scammer (what he was before being *elected)
Biden picks her as his VP, it's over. He keeps telling the Times how much he misses his regular life lol
It‚Äôs about the censorship of conservatives. It‚Äôs not about whether what‚Äôs being blocked is valid or accurate. They want to pretend if Biden peddled a bullshit doctor, it would be celebrated and it‚Äôs false. They are acting in bad faith, while their audience falls for BS as truth

The Court is not a finder of fact. A trial would be necessary for finding an objection to the state rule.  Biden is free under Dignitatis Humanae to not claim any affiliation with the Vatican or the bishops. They need to stay in their lane.
If they can leave some of the local voter targeting to down-ballot Dem candidates, the party can increase turnout without Biden needing to spend time and resources in the state. In essence, the House candidates act as his ground operations. Very smart play. And unique.

Hey,  Trump being terrible is NOT a reason to justify leftwing violence.  You can condemn both. I don't blame Biden for the idiots in Portland/Seattle, but I know people who do.    The election is not over.  You can't just assume Biden is so far ahead that it does not matter

Given the fact that that will never happen until we have Ranked Choice Voting, will you still consider it optimal when those votes come from Biden and result in another Trump term?

Ed Markey is a Joe Biden Democrat
For sure, and that has a lot to do with many people from PA, OH and other northern, red states moving to MD. But it‚Äôs still safe to assume Biden carries at least 60% of the vote in MD for the time being

Funny how ‚ÄúWoke‚Äù Dems are all about ‚ÄúMe Too!‚Äù Unless it‚Äôs their corrupted lame Candidate. They elevate their serial sexual predators JFK,Ted Kennedy, Bill Clinton, &amp; Beijing Biden. Then it‚Äôs not that believable. Only if leveled at a Conservative or Reps they don‚Äôt want elected.
"I'm 'Biden' my time cause that's the kind of guy I am" ("Glen Miller Story"). It happens to be OUR time also. It's cruel to waste time. ['Everyone' knows that Biden is merely a placeholder for Hillary (don't they)?]This is almost the exact line I used to convince several folks in PA and FL to vote for Clinton 2016. It's far more true for the marvelously incompetent, patently senescent Biden. Jesse Myerson had a great article-length version of the argument in 2017, but I can't find it today.

I know this isn‚Äôt the way you want change to happen but the mob is scary and if they turn on you it can be very unnerving.  So, you given in.  MW...DO YOU THING ALL WILL CHANGE WITH BIDEN?  All of a sudden new polices will emerge?  You see how the Dems treated you on stage.
They (DNC) can lose, if they want to.
Does this sound like someone who needs Biden or his campaign to defend her? No, &amp; that‚Äôs the point people are missing. Think - it‚Äôs one of the worst sexist tropes there is, &amp; many are pleading for it. She stands on her own.
I‚Äôm glad folks exposing Biden cuz he‚Äôs horrible
you can count on this...one way or another.  The Chinese want no part of POTUS, but would do back flips if their puppet Biden got in somehow.  The Chinese would eat him alive.
I‚Äôm making a prediction. This is a smokescreen. Kamala is not going to be a big exciting rollout, and by planting these seeds about her ambition, they build the excitement. PS - Prediction #2 - Trump dumps Pence for Haley within 24 hours of Biden‚Äôs VP announcement
there are tons of these out there...POTUS needs a full 2 minute commercial running key parts of them.  It may take 10 commercials to get them all in.  Biden is a crook and needs to be exposed ASAP.
The very first election of someone's life can't be for VPOTUS. Rice should have a role in the Biden admin, but not VP
Also depressing is that ppl are going ‚Äúrawwwr, Biden/campaign needs to defend her,  speak out, etc!!!‚Äù when wouldn‚Äôt that be the most sexist trope of all? Clearly she stood/stands on her own two feet as we &amp; her supporters saw today, which is entirely the point ppl are missing.

Your a fool. Trump doesn‚Äôt give a shit about police. Your voting for the wrong guy. Biden cares about police. Trump cares about Trump. Don‚Äôt team up with a racist.

People in the replies to are saying that Rendell and Dodd are undermining Biden with their misogyny.  Too true. If only we could remove their toxic influence from the campaign of noted feminist, Joe fucking Biden.
Dr. Fauci believes that  decisions saved lives, &amp; thus Joe Biden, who said the ban on travel from China was "racist," would have cost American lives. So those claiming Biden would have done COVID better are lying or ignorant.
Yes the disaster is because we actually have to see his name on the ballot as we vote for a Joe Biden.

It‚Äôs also incredibly stupid politically. The more of a liberal darling he becomes the less appealing he is to the conservative voters he is supposedly going to attract to Biden.
This whole "process" seemed like a joke from the very beginning.  A stunt to attract attention and make Biden seem interested in advancing progressive causes a few decades late.
Biden won't last 1 year
Oh Trump‚Äôs the Swamp?  Nancy/Chucky/Biden all been in office for many years and look where we are.  Trumps been there less than 3 and been harassed for all 3 and look what he got done. Dem are a joke. Some Republicans are too.
Cuz he def should choose the person* on record saying she doesn't want to be preslz... which is what the VP must do in case Biden can't finish his term.  * That would be Bass.  She's cool but PLEASE pick someone else (such as the person whose name rhymes with "Hamala Karris")
It all comes to down who Biden trusts.
Once everyone‚Äôs done fighting over a VP pick that won‚Äôt move the needle in any direction, we should pressure Biden and Co. to put out a list of judges they‚Äôd nominate for the Supreme Court.

Biden and Obama Trump Trump on that front, Ronna.
I bet that if Joe Biden is able to beat Trump in November even though I don't think so will he take a salary or work for free like Trump does.
"The attacks on Harris and the apparent pitting of the two Black female politicians against each other prompted Biden campaign manager Jen O'Malley Dillon to weigh in. "Ambitious women make history, change the world, and win," Dillon wrote on Twitter."
So if Joe Biden does beat Trump in November I will bet that he will take a salary and not work for free like Trump does
Yes Biden will fix all of the government problems, some of which he created and says he wants to keep, before he's even sworn in.  That is a thing which will happen.
Florida teen arrested in Twitter hack that hit Biden and Obama
I feel like news outlets will invent it because clicks &amp; looks are what drive their ad prices. If Biden is cruising seamlessly &amp; professionally, as he mostly is, they are going to leap on irrelevant things like Dodd or inept "analysis" of an in hpme studio to get the clicks

Calling Robert Evans a pro-imperialist fed is like calling Joe Biden the mayor of Antifa. Out of all the absurd things I've had to read this week, this tops the list.
Good for you!  I don‚Äôt understand why the left thinks all blacks should automatically vote left?  We really need to work on this narrative and re-educate people to the truth.  The world has changed and is headed down a terrible path if it follows Biden.
And these allegations are ALWAYS true, right? TDS.
I don‚Äôt see how US foreign policy ever recovers from this. No matter what President Biden does, every negotiation, partnership, pressure campaign, and sanction regime comes with an asterisk, because there could always be another Trump waiting in the wings to torpedo it all.

Bizarre the Dem establishment isn't thinking about this in terms of how can they lock in now someone they find acceptable for '24.  There's a least the barest sense to Biden not wanting palace intrigue (still stupid, though) but why does anyone else care?
Biden literally did this exact thing!!!
Funny haven't seen one Biden sign in PA. Lots of Trump signs. Wolf is a goner too.
These people don't get that the endorsement of Biden is less galling than the endorsement of "settling".
Leave it to the lefties... Epstein files opened and released. Nothing implicating Trump at all. But.. they STILL make it about Trump. TDS is SOOOO real.
Right,  Biden can be anywhere and be sworn-in  and the second he is sworn in he is President   and Commander-in-Chief of the most powerful military in the world  The WH Squatters will be ejected and their shit piled up by the street
My concern is the millions who don‚Äôt care if he knows what he‚Äôs doing or not. And his influence over people who believe mandatory masks wearing violates their rights. They might think that Biden will mandate masks nationwide and vote for Dumpy. Just saying.
Fk'n Biden doesn't know what world he'in.
You‚Äôve persuaded me on this today, FWIW. Especially since she is otherwise undefined, and given the importance of Florida for the legitimacy of a Biden win.
If Joe Biden was actually writing these tweets ... I would agree with you.  But we all know he is not.

Nothing wrong with ambition, only corruption. If Biden picks Kamala Harris, he can forget about my vote. Oh, wait. He's against all of my issues anyway. He doesn't even need my vote!
Anyone who opens their eyes and ears and is not blinded by hate can see the truth.  The truth is.; Joe Biden is no longer middle or left even,  he‚Äôs now far left with the radical movement to ruin our country. #TrumpNowMoreThanEver  #bidennever #
Replace Bernie with Biden and this is accurate.
Don't delay the election but change the date of it to tomorrow.  Then have Biden's inauguration the day after tomorrow.
If and only if a Biden administration decides to prosecute for it. And not until then.
Yeah and the nominee is already Biden so who cares
I wonder if the thousands of furious white Berners screaming into the ether about how Biden can't pick Kamala Harris remember that Biden won the nomination by never going on or listening to Twitter.
Bullshit.34%. But keep believing it‚Äôs 50%. It will hit you right between the eyes on January 20, 2021 when Biden takes office and daddy goes to prison. #LyingTrump
If biden doesn't pick harris I think he genuinely will try and run again in 24
It would be a colossal waste of time at taxpayer expense. He‚Äôs a liar. If I were Biden, I would do regional townhalls. Allowing trump to be placed on a stage to lie is enabling him yet again. Biden needs to focus on a robust transition by prioritizing our greatest threats!
Watch Fox choke on their own words!
In a story abt Republican complicity &amp; treason  can't stop himself from gratuitously attacking the man who will save US:  "Former Vice President Biden is a deeply flawed candidate, with an unimpressive record, poor judgement, and often a mien of senile uncertainty."
When Trump removed the rioters, Portlandians protested peacefully. A Biden administration must identify and prosecute violent extremists in DHS.

You mean the Joe Biden who lead the Great Recession recovery effort for Obama? A crisis, like the current one, created by Republican mismanagement. Let me jog your memory: it happened before you had to bend the knee and change your name from Romney.
And Obama is better than Trump and Biden, are you boiling yet Morpheus?
Biden dragged this out too long he has to pick Harris at this point.
No offense dude but Biden cannot form a coherent sentence.  His VP will be President and you know that‚Äôs going to be a far, far left winger.  No thanks.
I‚Äôd have voted for the Democrat, but I had preconditions. Biden, Bloomberg &amp; Harris were hard passes. They had to have an honest process w/o media + donors acting shysty &amp; helping rig IA for Ratboy. And what Obama did behind the scenes is reprehensible. They drove my vote away.ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
I wasn't speaking of politics as I already stated, so this isn't about Trump vs Biden. It isn't a stutter that I'm hearing. He doesn't appear well and it's shameful to use him like this if what many suspect is true. To pretend otherwise makes you complicit.
Some of Biden's climate advisers have direct ties to the oil and gas industry and have pushed for CCUS and direct air capture technologies. This may explain why the plan focuses on these technologies instead of more proven ways to reduce carbon pollution.
Under Obama/Biden unemployment went from 10% to 4.5% and yet you seem to forget that.. What is unemployment now..? The only jobs that  created was for his #ShittyKids  Notice Tiffany does not work for him...

Moreover, having studied the law, and knowing how the pandemic has affected the economy, given Biden a chance when he otherwise would have not had none and the problems it could cause voting.....One musing over how it could possibly change the election is not much.

Well Biden could have, at the very least, stood in front of a church and held up a Bible as if he'd never held it or any other book before.

It‚Äôs Trump that puts NYT in good shape. If Biden wins, watch the share price and digital subs decrease.
Biden isn‚Äôt going to win. He‚Äôs an idiotic hologram.
Considering Biden suggested that Anarchists inherently need to be locked up, I'm gonna guess nothing
Joe Biden is tight lol?
and the left have apparently had another conference call telling each of them to laugh as if it's a joke all the time.  Biden says that as well.  His brain is mush and the rest of them are hideous.
and the notion that inevitably if biden wins we get someone even worse than trump in 2024 doesn't actually make a whole lot of sense. radicalizing electoral movements that face defeat don't actually tend to double down; they peter out. one wd rather expect a tom cotton type in 24
and yeah, as much as i continue to be disappointed about bernie's loss (emotionally, i almost can't believe it, after the elation of february) but anyone who thinks that things won't get better vs trump under a biden presidency, i just don't buy it. in all likelihood due to the‚Ä¶
If he doesn't have a place in Biden's cabinet or some other worthy spot, no lie, I'll be disappointed.
Maybe that‚Äôs true, and I do think local elections are a great place for Green candidates. I voted Josh Harris in 2016. But compared to impact Biden made coming out in favor of gay marriage while sitting VP? That was a powerful moment. I agree ‚Äúboth/and‚Äù overall, though.
Biden called that long ago and Trumps reply.  ‚ÄúI never even thought of changing the date of the election. Why would I do that? November 3rd. It's a good number. No, I look forward to that election."
He is getting Michelles name out there for Veep, he knows he isn't allowed, so if Michelle is on the ticket they feel that Barack is really the one who is Veep, see how fast they ride the WH of Biden, if he's elected....I give 1 month
He had his eight years...no to automatic registration,.we have had a problem since the days of motor voter, now where oh where is Joe Biden and why hasn't he spoken at the funeral?  I feel if you really want to vote &amp; know the issues, you'll find a way to vote. No to lazy people
Biden should just copy all that and say he thought of it all.
Joe Biden continues to decline in full public view of his voters: The 2020 U.S. Census took place twenty years ago, presumptive Democrat presidential nominee Joe Biden implied Wednesday.
If he‚Äôs better than Netanyahu, that‚Äôs what matters. It‚Äôs the same way I feel with Biden. Anything to get us out of this hellhole
#Resisters I‚Äôm sorry that I‚Äôm not understanding how everyone that loved Obama is questioning Biden. Who do you think trained him for eight years? How could he not be a clear choice?#MyPresident
He needs to be on the Supreme Court! #Biden
Note: Youve alredy said that the Democrat Party is a mess, and they will be the ones running the country, not Biden.
Economy and unemployment was great going into an election year. How will Biden make the country better in 2021?
Will you explain your reasoning as to why Biden would be better?
RUSSIA Planning to Steal Election for TRUMP Through Mail-In Ballot FRAUD!! &gt;&gt; Protect Our Vote and Demand NO MAIL-IN BALLOTS!!! Please help spread the word. Biden has to win fair and square! #Biden2020
It‚Äôs even a little different in the county, though Dems generally still win 60-40 there. I also know there‚Äôs no chance AL/MS are going to go to Biden, despite Trump doing everything he can to tank this thing and get out.
We‚Äôre in a bubble on Twitter. And I‚Äôm in even more of one in Baltimore where we only have 1.2 political parties combined.  If we could get people who were disgusted in the right spots to pair up with one another, we could get 5% and Biden in office with like 10% to spare tbh.

In a tweet this morning, President Trump attacked voting by mail, suggesting a possible delay to the November election. This reporting from  makes it clear that he does not have the power to do that. What will you do to defend our right to #vote ?
It will be game over of Biden wins.
Please post the ‚Äúmany times and for years‚Äù that  trump who pretended like he didn‚Äôt know who David Duke was when asked about the endorsement, denounced him. How about Richard Spencer? Why aren‚Äôt they or women like this supporting Biden if he‚Äôs the real racist?
FUCK BIDEN
Thank you so much King!!!
So supporting a candidate that is sending out his goons to take away our 1st amendment rights is better? Hard pass on that.  Any vote other than for Biden is a vote for Trump. #WeWillVote
I'm not knocking anyone who votes for Biden. But I've had enough "helicopter" jokes made towards me that I'm voting PSL. If they think I'm a communist? I'll vote for the communist ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Biden Tells Reporters He Doesn‚Äôt Know Where He Is
Biden has the support of the CBC as well as the majority of black voters in the country. trump has the support of Richard Spencer, David Duke,  neo Nazis and the rest of racist white America.
I wish people would stop talking about Biden like hes a savior.  Remember folks hes a sexual abuser and should not be praised. Regardless of if you‚Äôre voting for him or not I wont judge you if you choose to vote for him,m but I will judge you if you talk like hes gonna be amazing
It doesn‚Äôt surprise me that you want to talk about legislation from 45 years ago instead trump‚Äôs long history of racism that spans his entire life. Your own article states that even back then that Biden was strong on civil rights.
I want what's best for my country &amp; fellow Americans! I know that Biden does not share these sentiments! I believe Trump Does share these sentiments!  Plus, Trump's exposing of corruption is awesome to witness! I believe him to be more a Patriot!
Well, point I have been making. No one can tell if it would be widespread or not, uncharted territory. Sorry, I don't read WaPo but the figure flying about is a lot more than that. Even the White House report puts it around 400
He needs to endorse Biden
Wtf is he talking about? Biden talked about non-violence in a speech THIS WEEK. Everyone from Ilhan Omar to Keisha Lance Bottoms have preached non-violence. Just a bald faced, easily disprovable lie.
is just getting desperate. Bad economy. Pandemic. Massively behind Biden in the polls. He should start packing.
So how many "VP Venn diagrams" have been drawn in Biden campaign offices, do you think?
needs to learn the constitution. Biden wouldn‚Äôt make that error.

Since we are asked to settle for Biden in order to defeat trump,just to be really safe the Dems should pick a white man for VP. Too many citizens will not vote for any woman of any race to hold that position.
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.   DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
Are you kidding me? If anything can we hold the election earlier. We need President Biden ASAP!

Old people gonna die on Biden‚Äôs hill.. that nigga is NOT our savior. Yeah niggas gonna vote for him but both wings are on the SAME bird!
Here‚Äôs the deal folks, it‚Äôs easy for many to forget his past if his racist behavior doesn‚Äôt affect you personally. But don‚Äôt make light of his actions because they have had a negative affect on the Black community and Biden could care less.
Well if Obama, Biden, and Clinton can get away with conspiracy, sabatoge, and treason against the nation, no one is going to care about petty allegations against Trump. "No one is above the law!" Says the corrupt Democrats. :D
When was Clinton as far ahead in Florida polls as Biden has been?
Joe Biden's getting intelligence briefings now. I wonder if they're warning him about intelligence gathered from Trump
I might have to settle for Biden but what is a ‚Äúwhite lie‚Äù and how is it different from a big lie? It‚Äôs a mistake to say Biden doesn‚Äôt believe in white supremacyjust because his racist record is being sweep under the rug. Biden must address it because it‚Äôs not going away

Northeast PA likely includes Monroe, Carbon, Northampton &amp; Lehigh Counties. It may include Berks as well which could also be part of SE Pennsylvania too.  Poll suggests that #PA07 is likely very strong for Biden and Biden will also carry #PA08 but at a much smaller margin.

we consoled ourselves w/ idea biden wd lose badly.  'we can't yet take over the dem party bc of restrictive institutions, but the country is sick of them‚Ä¶'  but so far, idea that most americans are perfectly content w/ moderate leaders seems stronger than 'silent left majority.'

President Trump please stop with these stupid tweets come you get Biden in a couple of debates it's over his mind is gone
Individual voters do not decide elections, you have nobody to blame but Joe Biden if people don‚Äôt show up for him in November.
TBH I'm not excited about the prospect of Biden choosing a Black woman as VP. The fetishization of Black women as saviors, fixers and care takers for white folks is not something I'm in the mood to watch play out for 4 years.
Pretty bleak that these guys can‚Äôt tell you why you should vote for Biden without calling you stupid or evil
Trump Floats Whether to ‚ÄòDelay the Election,‚Äô Something He Cannot Legally Do
Truly astonishing that the flaw Biden's staff saw in Clinton's campaign was all the public appearances
I‚Äôm looking forward to this joint #Biden‚Äî#Warren event Friday. And because of  persuasive email, I made my first donation to  campaign. I hope Joe realizes that his Presidency will need Elizabeth Warren‚Äôs passion &amp; her ‚Äúplans-for-that‚Äù to bring America back.
Not at all, voting fraud is rife in many swing areas. You should see it the other way around. The Dems won't help you, Trump just might.  Even so, Trump will butcher Biden when it comes to it. He's clearly suffering dementia.
The election will not be delayed.  I love how scared you are.  You should be.  Joe Biden and the American voter is going to give you the shellacking of your life.  We cannot wait.
...to Trump than final tallies. He‚Äôs going to claim that‚Äôs evidence of fraud and argue we have to go with election night results (like he did about FL Senate in 2018), and he may have states Biden wins with GOP legislatures appoint alternate slates of electors...
Obama Unleashes on Trump Privately as He Raises $24 Million for Biden - The New York Times
Ohhh, so since they discovered that you voted by absentee voting a couple of times, that part is good. Aren't you really worried that mail in voting makes it easier for everybody to vote, mainly people of color, which means more will vote. For Biden!!!

Opinion | Biden‚Äôs election will end national nightmare 2.0
The debate situation between Biden/Harris was nothing compared to the Obama/Clinton primary battles and Obama still made her SecState.  Biden's allies need to let that go
We‚Äôve been living in a  novel since 2016. We are in the part now where the  good guys finally wake up and come up with a plan to defeat the evil one (ü§°üçäüí©)There is usually an older or wiser person (Biden)who steps up to save the day. It Better happen! VOTE!
Yes and her name is Condoleezza Rice.  Of the four are on Biden's shortlist, Kamala is better suited for AG or the Supreme Court.   California doesn't buy him anything and there will fear, from the right, about her 2024 run.  I like Karen or Stacey.
Wait, I have to ask this because I don‚Äôt understand your tweet. If Biden appeals to the PA blue collar type, but the MN north woods non-college white is a different type, why would they be ‚Äúcoming back to the Midwest pack‚Äù (which I read as voting for him).  I‚Äôm confused.
Not sure this is the right move.  I understand it in principle, but this will give Democrats an additional reason to keep Biden in the basement until Election Day claiming insufficient security and protection at any and all events
Remember Hoe saying that if he we elected, he would cure cancer in his first term?
AOC singlehandedly, cost NYC 25k jobs plus all of those temporary construction jobs. Biden will do the rest when he drives smaller firms into bankruptcy.
Maybe something you could one day talk about on the pod, seems in your area - If Biden is sworn in on 1/20, what documents are left behind and what get carried out by Trump to be locked up for 25 years in his "Presidential Library"?

Trumplings always say incorrect things about Biden that Trump is guilty of. #Biden2020Landslide  #TrumpFailedAmerica
People have been saying that since 1968.  As far as I‚Äôm concerned, it was over for me when the DNC installed Biden after 2016‚Äôs revelations in court from everyone involved.  They‚Äôre both ideologically opposed to me. The Dems decided they‚Äôd rather fuck the left &amp; get the neocons.
Biden was 18 in 1960, so that decade‚Äôs legal victories were the work of people who came up under FDR. (CRA = 1964)  When his generation got into power, we got union busting, trickle down, resumed wars for resources &amp; geopolitical reasons, the War On Drugs, and the list goes on.
If you vote for Biden, it‚Äôs endorsing the DNC rigging the 2016 &amp; 2020 primaries against Bernie Sanders (even admitted it in court) &amp; supporting the system that put Donald Trump in the White House to begin with.  Thanks, Hillary!
Why Yeezy wanna jerk off Joe Biden tho??????

Make no mistake the CCP owns and controls the D's. This election is between America and China. Biden is China's bitch, we all know it. Unless you want the CCP in full control, we need to FIGHT HARD
You said that right.  Biden is dangerous, this is his last chance after over 40 yrs.  He latched on to everyone he can and contradicts himself. Never know what‚Äôs gonna come out of his mouth next. AOL Sanders and God knows who all will be in charge.
Donors (1 named who is a Roger Stone affiliate üòí &amp; 11 unnamed, which is very convenient) who are labeled as allies w/o any info as to the extent of a direct relationship w/ Biden/campaign besides writing a check. Can‚Äôt rein in a circle if don‚Äôt know who they are.
Better friends? These are all donors (1 Roger Stone affiliate, 11 unnamed). Biden/the campaign have zero control over them, just as you have no control over yours.
I cannot understand why Chris Dodd and his ‚Äúbaggage‚Äù are anywhere NEAR this decision. If Biden understands that a lot of Americans are sick of Old White Men running the country, why has he allowed an Old White Man with a tarnished reputation to create drama?
He will get sick. Pence will take over and lead the transition team to Biden.

That, or maybe they rely on knee-jerk Twitter to disseminate something click-baith w/o reading beyond the headline. Beyond Stone-affiliate John Morgan who has already done this before, who are these unnamed Biden donors? One self-identifies as ‚Äúclosest to‚Äù but how can anyone...

As an outside observer, that  "technical error" is funny &amp; hopefully nobody got fired for it.   I know the Dems would never pick Nina so I don't have a horse in this race, but I have to wonder:  What demographic that wasn't sure about Biden is Kamala bring to the table?

I got excited by Susan Rice, and I thought Biden and Warren might have well complemented each others strengths and weaknesses, but the seeming eventual inevitability of Harris hits home all Harris's weaknesses particularly hard. 7/7
That's completely fair as well. She just seems like a "I want to serve my nation the best way I can" (which I can admire) vs a political dreamer like Harris/Duckworth, which is something I think Biden should be looking for in his VP

I‚Äôd love either! I have taken some abuse for supporting Harris, been called ‚Äúanti-Black‚Äù. It‚Äôs bizarre. I think Biden has so many good choices and I‚Äôm glad I‚Äôm not making that decision.
Note who is being quoted on background in this piece and the Politico one. DONORS. Even the Dodd quote was secondhand per a donor. Plenty of shady Marc Rich types have always been the dark underbelly of the Democratic Party--they fear Kamala and always have. Biden won't listen.
Candidly, all I wanted to do was state the fact the Obama-Biden did not sign the bill into law. It was signed 52 years ago. The tweet is misleading. It‚Äôs a lie.
It's not Biden who's focusing on her. Be less disingenuous.
IN 2015 Obama/Biden updated the AFFH which is what Trump rescinded....and rightfully so....
Biden belongs in a home
Oh well ... go vote Biden ... who the f*c* cares... just save extra money for all the ebt you have to pay... that‚Äôs all
if the democrats were to win the election.. no matter what the VP is automatically considered the president... don‚Äôt even try it biden couldn‚Äôt run a fucking playdoe table in a kinder garden class
Well then your niece might understand what the hell Biden is saying when he speaks. It‚Äôs gibberish!
Live where you want, just make decisions based on fact. Obama-Biden didn‚Äôt sign the AFHA into law, Lyndon Johnson (GOP) did in 1968!! That was done 52 years ago! He‚Äôs lying!

That seems like what they are trying to avoid here though. It would seem like a 2024 presidential candidate would know that they are basically going to be judged on Biden's record as pres (see for a counter example Gore's terrible decision to try to distance himself from Clinton)
It‚Äôs not about the election, or rather, not about THIS election. Either Biden wins, in which case they have a cudgel to use against him, or Trump wins, in which case who cares?
He's a phony
They‚Äôve implicitly conceded 2020, and are looking ahead to 2022/24. They‚Äôre trying to leave as big a mess as possible for Biden and the Dem Congress, so they can blame them for not cleaning it up. They‚Äôre the tenants from hell who trash the house when the eviction notice comes.
Same
They will, but if the past is any indication they will dominate.  I cant even remember the last time the sitting VP had a challenge in securing the nomination. Hell, Biden did it relatively easily with a four year break. I guess Humphrey in 68 is the last real challenge to a VP.
He's a friend of Stones
This guy is a Biden saboteur, block is idiocy
Well no one cares what you want
Don‚Äôt miss a break away layup here folks. Biden is going to delegate to his VP A LOT. This is a selling point

Joe Biden voted to let states overturn Roe v Wade in 1981.
You might also be underestimating the number of people impacted by Biden somewhat. Every college grad is dealing with his work on student loans, everybody on the streets protesting is dealing with his crime bill, etc. ofc on the other hand you got trump and it's just... fuck

Although frankly I'd love to see Warren as VP and Harris as a fiery, bring-the-receipts AG. I mean, I'd be cool with Biden-&gt;Warren-&gt;Warren-&gt;Harris-&gt;Harris from here until 2040.
On one hand, you're right that Trump is far worse than Biden.  On the other hand, a lot of people have been harmed by policies Biden refuses to adopt and those people / those close to them should have a right to complain. Like this guy here whose son died from lack of healthcare.
I feel like there‚Äôs spooky wicked shit like soul cooking but that‚Äôs like your Clinton‚Äôs, Biden, Obama‚Äôs .. and then there‚Äôs trump lol who is strictly for self.
I'm cool with that. Ideally, at Biden's age he should be planning to be a one-term President and to hand the ball off to a super-capable VP.
I am hardly a Biden Bros. He wasn‚Äôt my first or second choice but as a member of the LGBT community it could be life and death for us if Trump wins so whatever.

Biden‚Äôs not ‚Äúthe left‚Äù so totally fair game
He is going to go to one of his properties every weekend until the election to pocket the money. After he loses to Biden, he will move to Mar a Lago until Jan 20, simply to have secret service and the rest of the govt pay hotel bills. He is a thief.
Joe Biden is not mentally strong to be president.#outnumberedOT
Are you kidding? It‚Äôs a huge story that the left media is covering for Biden just to beat Trump. Staffers whose job it is to make sure their boss gets where he‚Äôs supposed to be, don‚Äôt usually lead them around like a lost puppy.
....too bad the WHO lied/dropped the ball back in January. They set the snowball rolling. Thankfully our President implemented travel bans to try and slow the virus from spreading.   .....oh, and anyone who votes for Biden really isn‚Äôt firing on all cylinders.
Nope haven‚Äôt read it.   And yes, she definitely did. Biden has done it to a lesser extent.
I think at this rate Biden can win here.
Well yeah. Biden said that nothing will fundamentally change. Maybe the cap will be blue.
Sure, but its even less likely if Biden doesnt invest there.
i remember ferraro on tv claiming palin beat biden in the 2008 vp debate (presumably because ferraro was bitter about hilary losing to obama, but it was the best display of motivated debate reviewing i've seen)
Germany is hoping Biden wins so they don't need to pay their fair share.....Germany wants the USA to continue paying for their protection.....

As crime surges on his watch, Trump warns of Biden's America
I think you‚Äôre right. She is Biden‚Äôs best fit.
Also, I would expect the tipping point state to be closer to the national average because Biden has a bit of a different coalition than HIllary - more like Obama's.
the idea of a biden / harris ticket winning more EC's than obama / biden in 2008 is a sobering one, it undermines everything we thought was true (which shd already have been undermined by the 2020 primary results). but no one seems to know what to do about it besides cry &amp; pout‚Ä¶

Biden "Accidentally" Reveals Handwritten Notes on Potential Running Mate Kamala Harris
Chill. This is a junk poll by a junk pollster. Just look at the national topline (Biden by 9) and the swing states.   Also - Trump still loses in this poll.
Rashida Tlaib refusing to endorse Joe Biden is a very risky move for her reelection but I had the good fortune to meet her at a small gathering in 2019 and she was like‚Äîlook. I'm not trying to be in the House forever. I'm gonna do me bitch
AOC gets all the press but for my money Rashida Tlaib is far and away the most badass member of the Squad, defeating Ilhan Omar for the crown (not easy!).
my most controversial opinion right now is that a biden presidency will probably be better for the left than obama's, because he has no independent legitimacy to insulate him from public pressure

‚Ä¢Biden is incredibly corrupt. ‚Ä¢Biden doesn‚Äôt respect the rule of law. ‚Ä¢Obama repeatedly violated the Constitution. ‚Ä¢Biden is Pelosi‚Äôs henchman.
What was Joe Biden, Nancy Pelosi, and Chuck Schumer's reactions to the China travel ban? Did you have an opinion by January 30th? What was it THEN exactly? Care to enlighten us? Blaming a pandemic on ONE human being is a sign of deep psychosis.
Biden has always been a moderate.  Calm, serene, logical and trustworthy.  We are safe with him.  Dinosaurs like Trump are afraid of any new idea.  They cling to the past and shake in their shoes at modern ideas.  Trump wants to live in the last century.
I feel you been fooled by these accounts but #WarrenDemocrats are voting for Biden no matter who the VP is. Those who believe this unfortunate misinformation is true, simply put on your critical thinking cap and see if a narrative is being drafted. #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica
You hated Joe Biden when you were in office. What changed? Joe Biden had over 40 years to get things moving, but Trump has been in office for 3 and it's ALLL his fault. Right........
Agree. But Biden's as well. Sweet Lord we are screwed.
#Biden as a lawmaker voted in favor of radical gun controls that trampled upon the rights of law-abiding Americans and against legislation to protect those rights.   As vice president Biden led the Obama administration's assault on the 2nd amendment. He's gotten more extreme!
If Biden were my uncle he would have already been admitted to a memory care facility.

Barr‚Äôs Testimony yesterday May Have Revealed Another Obama-Biden Scandal
Afraid that‚Äôs why the left wants open borders . I especially don‚Äôt trust Joe Biden he‚Äôs just creepy. Makes me wonder what they promised him to use him as a stooge.
It doesn't work that way in the USA. The President is selected by the Electoral College whose members are selected by states by votes. The distribution of delegates favors small states and in turn Republicans. There is a small chance VP Biden would lose even at 56% of votes.
Vote for Joe Biden!

Has the Biden-Sanders joint task force created a climate change policy that will unite the progressives in the party against Trump?
She's also telling us, in pretty clear language, that the primary reason to vote for Biden is that he isn't Trump.  Not that he's going to be a good president, just that he's... not Trump.
I hope she does and it‚Äôs the new Trump Campaign ad. #slamdunk for Biden!
I saw something to the extent of -- from a white guy -- "if the Dem party cared about Black people they wouldn't have propped up Biden." Who do y'all think VOTED for him? I'm not opposed to DNC criticism but...
"Resist", their pfp read, but Biden and Pelosi has already sold Amercians out by allowing them to be evicted, AND furloughed without backing a UBI
Look, I was never in it for Biden. But I see a lot of white online leftists conveniently blaming the DNC and ignoring his very real success with Black voters in SC. Also, I still think it's problematic to not really think your candidate has anything to do w/ their loss.
I'm not a Biden fan per se but a lot of people are ignoring his success with Black voters in SC
2) trump was called xenophobic when he banned travel in January   3) has Biden left his basement yet??

Very interesting. The resistance to HCQ is because Trump promoted it. They've also made BLM an anti-Trump movement. Watch the 'peaceful protests' destructions come to an abrupt end when Biden is inaugurated
Looks like Tulsi needs to come back and finish the job. When the left is foaming at the mouth to defund the police, the Biden campaign picks Kamala the cop.

I can't wait 4 Biden 2 be interviewed by Chris Wallace as he really goes after people not caring what party they belong to.  Oh wait a minute? What am I thinking. That ridiculous hearing 2day messed my brain up. He is 2 chicken because he knows Wallace will make a fool out of him

Yes Trump did more things the first 4 months in office then Laurel &amp; Hardy did in 8. Trump made sure other countries were not taking advantage of us unlike Biden.

I have yet to see a Biden sign or bumper sticker
Maybe we wouldn‚Äôt be still bringing this up if the DNC hadn‚Äôt rigged the primary to install Biden, who‚Äôs adamantly against every piece of progressive legislation making the radar.
No way.  We were told that same set of lies in 2016 after it came out that the primary was rigged.  You can get rid of Biden &amp; find someone worth voting for, or you can risk having 4 more years of Trump, bc many of us will vote third party before voting either of those clowns in.

not that this makes it acceptable, but there‚Äôs a solid chance biden doesn‚Äôt even know what an anarchist is
Would seem like something someone forgetful would do that has a tendency to have angry outbreaks...  How many of these dem party operatives are quietly praying more and more people die because that‚Äôs the only reason Biden is leading as much as he is.
wtf i love joe biden now
Sorry but this Registered Independent, that has always voted for whom I thought was the best person for the position,  I must say NO to Biden,  He has to have TelePrompTers and can't get that accurate.  He is a poor puppet of the Squad and Sanders people.
Bold Take: August recess is nigh and it‚Äôs the Rubicon for Republicans if they want to stay with Trump or take a ‚Äúcontain Biden‚Äù approach. Once the Covid relief Bill FINALLY passes, the GOP will start bailing on Trump. Gotta go in front of constituents before the election
Yes, definitely! He is going to hand over a disaster to Biden.
We are watching Democrats destroy this country and the liberal media is basically state TV. If we do not elect Republicans in November every city will look like Portland with their not so peaceful protest. Attention Democrats Americans are not blind. Riots will grow with Biden

There are only two choices, and it's about as binary a decision as it's possible to have. Barring unforeseen calamity, either Donald Trump or Joe Biden will take the oath of office on January 20 at noon.

Is the VP debate before or after Biden implodes on stage?
Yeah, Biden's a total fascist. üôÑ Stick to to connecting newspaper clippings with yarn.
Somebody please remind him that protests ALSO happened when he was VP. And also remind him that the National Guard was deployed during Obama‚Äôs/Biden‚Äôs presidency because they LOVE to forget that.
Biden didn't win in Iowa or New Hampshire. Didn't even place well. His campaign didn't turn around until South Carolina. Obama won a surprise victory in Iowa launching his 2008 campaign.
Biden put them up to it. Lol
You think the strongest VP choice would be a Senator who's campaign didn't last long enough to get to Iowa? I respectfully disagree. Had Biden not promised to choose a woman as VP  would have been my choice. Given that constraint  or  look solid.

Oh I don't know. With the Biden campaign's blatant attempt to fold in all the same suburban conservatives who *claim* to be Never Trumpers, I'd wonder if we're not seeing the culmination of that project
We've wandered quite far from the original point, which was that I don't think Senator Harris would be the strongest VP candidate choice for Biden.
Thank you, Dr. Biden ‚ù§Ô∏è
Wouldn‚Äôt it be great if someone asked Biden abt these and he said, ‚ÄúI think he should keep doing them. They‚Äôre great. I go up two points in the polls every week he does them.‚Äù
For those "leftists" constantly pushing the lesser of two evil narratives, Biden wants you in prison just as much as Trump does. Will he be better? More than likely.  Is he a potential ally? Don't delude yourself.
Biden will make some concessions and keep the wheels turning
That said, if there was a serious medical/mental issue demonstrated, I'd refrain from voting for Biden. But frankly, I've already seen that, I feel, from Trump and so wouldn't switch my vote to him.
Biden vows to fight racial inequalities with economic agenda
Biden won't be alive four years from now. That's why everyone's desperate to know who his VP pick is.
Quite frankly if you're excited about voting for Biden you're not a progressive you might be a Democrat you might consider yourself a liberal but you are far from being a progressive.

Biden says he will choose his running mate next week
Ms. Martin.   You said that Biden hasn't spoke out against the situation in Portland and other places.  Isn't that the sitting president's job?  Instead of petty attacks on doctors and those trying to save lives?
My point was the complete hypocrisy of criticizing the press for not asking Biden how he would pay for his plan then not asking a single question about the debt or deficit to one of the architects of the GOP tax scam that added $2 trilllion to the debt.
Trump says he won‚Äôt go and pay respects to John Lewis at Capitol | The Independent~ would it kill him to pay respects to him?
THE JOE BIDEN ICE CREAM FLAVOR WILL BE CALLED *GROPEY TRIPLE VANILLA* Ben &amp; Jerry‚Äôs Radical Ice Cream Dreams

In general nothing shocks me. I'm tempted often enough to say it does, rhetorically - I  say 'I can't believe...', then stop and alter: 'well, of course I can believe it, but...'  But: I cannot believe that Joe Biden is running for president and we're expected to vote for him.
2 mins after criticizing the press for not asking Biden how he would pay for his plan (by eliminating the GOP tax cuts for the wealthy) you interviewed the architect of the GOP tax cuts that added 2 trillion to the debt and didn't ask him a single question about debt or deficit.
Well I guess we'll have to agree to disagree. Given that your party's presumptive nominee will be the 4th Catholic major-party presidential nominee in U.S. history I find it odd that you're so quick to label a Catholic fraternal group as a single issue org
He also said he's going to beat Joe Biden on national TV (CNBC). How can any normal person reconcile that and vote for him?
I don't hate Joe Biden, but my god I hate that he is the presumptive nominee. I hate the democratic party. I hate political parties. I hate the word hate, but how else to capture the frustration? Biden is a shit-grinning shill. What a waste.
If Biden picks someone else he‚Äôs gonna have to win without my money.
You're right of course.  Objectively looking at it: she makes a great candidate for Biden to make the argument that he is looking to govern
Pete,  this sounds like a wet dream you and your husband had last night, Joe Biden wont remember how to get to the white house

I'm legit curious as to how Biden would answer about why he wants the job. (Why does ANYBODY want to be President now?)
Deja Vu 2016. Peeps can't stomach Hillary so vote Trump. Now can't vote Trump so will vote Biden
Finally (I think), I'm listening to Joe Biden right now who is crystal clear that anyone committing crimes during the course of protests should be prosecuted.
I know we have to plug our noses and vote for Biden. But they seem to be going out of their way to make it harder and harder.
If Biden wins they manipulate the interest rates and start that old saw up again. It‚Äôs their best weapon because stupid people believe it.
is doing a live stream during the Barr hearing. Haha the democrats know exactly how to hide sleepy Joe.  #BarrHearing #biden
My point being, I've been convinced that I don't really care that much if marijuana is legalized or just decriminalized (as Biden wants to do) at the federal level. What matters is we need states to legalize. Is this hindering that effort? If so then yeah fuck all the way off DNC
When a neighborhood falls apart, Trump sees wealthy apartments for the rich. Biden sees reasonable houses for the poor and working class.
Pretty sure if Biden wins and Republicans maintain control of the Senate than Mitch Mcturtle will actually say the words "get fucked" in response to trying to pass a voting rights bill

How Biden's foreign policy team got rich
One thing I‚Äôve noticed living in a blue state, Maryland, is there is NO excitement for Biden. By this point in 2015 there was a ton of Bernie and Hilary lawn signs all over the place, I have yet to see one for Biden. I‚Äôm sure they are out there but I haven‚Äôt see them.
2/ "They will not have decades of work already done for them," I replied.  I hope we don't make the same mistake a second time. It's not as though there are no other good people in the Democratic Party. And it's not as though foreign policy is Biden's weak point.
Headlines today seem to push Rice to the front. I still like Kamala a lot. Warren would be my personal #1 pick because of her experience on economy and education. Rice is smart and tough. Keisha is too. Biden can't really screw this up, I don't think.
I want things to get getter. Biden will change nothing.
So is Biden going to name his VP *this* week? I love the veepstakes every election and this one in particular, but I'm kind of exhausted by it. All these women are really good. I see no real red flags now that Amy K. is out of the running.
And for your information I didn‚Äôt jump to defend her whiteness, I jumped to defend her point. Any black person that Joe Biden picks as his Vice President is just pure showmanship. But I find it funny that you as an activist defend a sexual predator. Question why you do that
I thought I‚Äôd preface this with saying that I‚Äôm not thrilled with any ‚Äúleft‚Äù group endorsing Biden, but the second you decide to start putting that campaign in your affiliate network I‚Äôm out.  No way am I voting for the people that are fucking us every primary cycle.
Almost as funny as Biden challenging a 300 pound man to a pushup contest like he is Mr. Olympia...
The scam is on. Biden needs a 30pt lead to eek out a victory!
I don't know if I'd rather Biden chose Aunt Esther for VP or AG.
It was hysterical.  I can show you about 75 videos of Biden fumbling speeches and showing serious signs of mental incapacity.  But THAT is how you base your political opinion? So yes. Mindless.
Well yeah, the DNC will shut down any progressive, but they "forgave" and welcomed her back as soon as she endorsed Biden.   I question these "progressives" like her and Bernie that toe the line to the DNC while 3rd parties would welcome them.

Not that I disagree, but when do we get to vote FOR someone? The lesser of two evils is still evil. And if Biden is elected, he and his neoliberal masters will administer a sedative to the Left. It happened under Obama.

Fauci won‚Äôt take off, he‚Äôll be even more energized and committed to getting the country back on its feet. With Biden as POTUS, he will finally have all the support he needs. More importantly, he‚Äôll be allowed to lead the fight against COVID-19.
Biden may not need to ask permission of Congress, but you can be damned sure he won't take a sh*t without first asking his corporate donors!
Well Biden is likely to pick a black woman as a VP, so apparently he can be ‚Äúconvinced‚Äù
Yeah it‚Äôs crazy how literally only the two candidates who support legalization are third party
They were historically slave traders. Right now they are just using the commies to further their agenda, if Biden wins the election, they will throw them under the bus.
Why is it wrong to expect something for your vote? Is my racist is nicer than your racist all they can offer.?I find Biden just as horrible as trump and his life and voting record proves it. I‚Äôll vote for him only because most of the  GOP crap smells worst than the Dems crap.
Biden not making a clear case for himself. Which is both a shame (he has good ideas) and also good becuase many times when he opens his mouth not so great stuff comes out.
Compare NC to GA and TX, though.  If Biden wins GA and TX, I have to think NC goes blue (along with a pretty big electoral landslide, obviously).  It isn't a huge outlier like MN is, but it's probably still an outlier to some extent.
Joe Biden ISNT safe for Women or Children to be around.We had the best economy and best jobs reports under Trump, the Deep State along with China unleased the CV19 all over the world.The economy is better now and continuing to resurge. Open America back up and jobs will return!
And keep an eye out for our national media town hall Aug 4 with a number of public health luminaries. We need Biden to adopt this Pandemic Prevention Plan. Please sign and share.
America needs a plan to stop COVID-19 and stop the pandemics of the future. Donald Trump's only plan is to torture immigrants and deploy brownshirts.  We have a plan, and we're asking Joe Biden to adopt it *this week.* Health worker? Sign it here:
If Joe Biden doesn‚Äôt choose someone who can immediately grab the reins of power and run the government,  the enthusiasm will evaporate. It HAS TO BE Harris or Warren. The press should STOP encouraging anything else. Seriously. This sucks.

The headline does not match the text.  There's nothing that Hogan says that even implies he's vote for Trump.  When did this interview take place anyway, before the Biden became the presumptive nominee?
Trump has shifted the Overton window and now people are excited to vote for Joe Biden. I‚Äôm all for harm reduction and I hope Trump loses in November, but I will not celebrate this Democratic Party. It will be a true Pyrrhic victory.
The data collected this far from around the world is clear by now. People are just scared and refuse to pay attention to how dangerous this virus is to the world.
If Biden picks Forky to be his running mate I am still voting for him.
It‚Äôs odd. She claims that voting for her will help get Biden elected, and she doesn‚Äôt say anything ‚Äònegative‚Äô about him. Yet no endorsement; this feels like a cop-out to me. Like she doesn‚Äôt want to piss off the people who don‚Äôt like him, so she just isn‚Äôt willing to commit.
Joe Biden has accepted more than $800,000 from energy companies and has a long way to go to unite the progressive base around his climate policies.
Trump wins? ü§î That's funny.... because you know what I see is increasing with each passing day?.....  Biden's Lead Margin  ü§£ü§£ü§£
He was on to talk about John Lewis, not Biden, though. It very awkwardly switched to the ‚Äúoh, by the way, about this thing about Kamala and Politico and Chris Dodd. Not the only one on this hellsite who saw it.
It's a fucking photo of their backs in a fancy room quit projecting. Biden is absolute trash and will only be elected because Trump is worse. Surface level aesthetics as politics is classic liberal bullshit and why we're in this mess.
I seriously believe Val and Kamala are the top 2. And Kamala has the better electoral record and knows the Senate and how to build voting coalitions in it - something Biden will need from his VP not often discussed
This is a bad take. Biden's candidacy is supposed to represent a return to normalcy. Refusing to debate would have the opposite effect.
Hahaha. No, BLM means, with each passing day:   Biden's Leading More and More  ü§£ü§£ü§£
Thank you, President Biden! Boy, I just love the sound of that!!
No mention of Biden in article.  This is probably the part the headline refers to:
een doing calls for #PoweredByPeople in TX.  Let me tell you: Trump supporters are going to vote. They will go through hell to reelect him.  We are going through hell because of him.  WE ALL HAVE TO VOTE FOR BIDEN. Only a selfish prick (  wouldn't.
Here you angry ones come.  Always to inject something stupid to a positive funny post.  Just say any dumb thing.  Don't you guys have a Biden page you can kumbiya on?
I like Karen b/c she is experienced, moderate and less polarizing than Kamala. I would like Kamala as AG or on the Court  Biden's 78 years old, will he make it to 82, in that stressful job?  Karen Bass Veep Kamala Harris AG Elizabeth Warren Fed Chair Susan Rice Secretary of State

You will never see me argue otherwise. At least, unlike many Biden supporters, you acknowledge Biden's
I want Trump to beat Biden, there's a difference. If the Democrats had presented a non-corrupt, non-race baiting Democrat that isn't from the Obama wing, that would have been my choice.   Your inner Trump is surfacing again. Where have I defended his bad behaviour?
Just reading it. Unfortunately the center no longer exists, at least for the upcoming elections. Many subgroups are finding themselves not fitting in to the extreme stances of these political parties. Biden won't shift with elections upon us, they should move their support to GOP
Lmao yeah right nobody who thinks Biden's a good pic would change their vote because of this.
If Joe Biden can't beat Donald Trump in THIS election we should rise up and murder absolutely nobody because murder is wrong!!!!
Not going to happen.  President Trump will win handily and again Americans will reject Biden the third time!  He‚Äôs unelectable and more so since his dementia
honestly holographic joe biden would get a better turnout
That sounds like  is not being objective and is pushing his personal favorite &amp; tipping the scale instead of leaving it up to Biden .  I think  would be an excellent choice.   I‚Äôd also be okay with  as VP and  as AG kicking ass !
I wann fight joe Biden
What you said about Joe Biden is disgraceful and I hope you apologize.  Bernie had his chance and he lost to Joe Biden.  Millions of Afro-Americans voted for Joe Biden over Bernie.  Respect that.
Probably the worst choice. I don't know, Biden may lose. Nobody is enthusiastic about Biden. Especially, if there is a sort of vaccine against COVID-19 before election things could turn very different.
If you dont like biden..  mostly bernie bros. You might vote for trump.. now they will possible vote for kanye.   If you dont like trump.. your definitely voting Biden. Majority anyway
Ladies and gentlemen..... i give you the Biden voter
Voting for Biden is the best and only choice is we want Trump and Trumpism to fall. If we fail, the consequences are dire.
I call üêÇüí© on you! You lie like a rug. There are no Biden 2020 signs anywhere, but there are Trump 2020 signs everywhere. That's more scientific than your üêÇüí©. üòâ
Pollsters don‚Äôt bother with Indiana, and it‚Äôs probably not on anyone‚Äôs radar now, but Obama made a push in 2008 and was rewarded when he became the first Democrat to carry the state since LBJ in 1964. If Biden‚Äôs wants to expand his map, Indiana‚Äôs an inexpensive place to do so.
We don‚Äôt need to ‚Äúbreak the Donald.‚Äù He‚Äôs doing just fine breaking himself every time he opens his foolish ignorant befuddled lying mouth. Biden isn‚Äôt winning by making noise. He‚Äôs winning by sitting back and watching Trump make his own self destructive noise. Carry on Donald.
Wow I didn‚Äôt make the Chloe list? üòÜüòù
Thanks King! Hope ur well
are indeed enemies of the people. #DemocratsRuinEverything #Biden and  are frauds!
Yes there is such a thing as too controversial. And I'm voting for Biden, regardless of who he picks. I would just prefer it  not to be Susan Rice.
If Joe Biden gets elected, will his wife, Dr. Jill Biden, be called Dr. First Lady?Contrary to what the DNC and MSM say, President Trump, even when a businessman, was always working for black America, record low unemployment rates for minorities before pandemic, First Step Act and opportunity zones, while Biden hasn‚Äôt done anything for black America. Ed
When Biden gets in office they will be dealt with.  Right now we have a weak A ineffective leadership.
Biden's team? This reporting relies almost exclusively on so-called Biden allies, most of whom have nothing to do with the campaign and will have no influence on the pick.
Please get names no he say she say. Send a direct message to Simone Sanders that they need to stop this BS. I think Jill Biden has more pull with Joe than Rendell or Dodd
Lmao, what?!  Like Biden saying ‚Äúyou ain‚Äôt black if you don‚Äôt vote for me‚Äù wasn‚Äôt racist af? Y‚Äôall are completely deluded... half of the country is not racist. These damn old wealthy politicians might just be racist, that‚Äôs different.
Defund is being floated by their leadership and some hard left Liberals. But the Establishment Dems aren't on that Bandwagon. Keep in mind. Trump is running against Biden..He is a Centrist Establishment Democrat. It won't happen with him in office.
Do you think Biden is doing that?

That‚Äôs a total misrepresentation of the facts. Trump‚Äôs economic policy with strong economy he can raise more poor people into the middle class. He‚Äôs always working hard for black America. Biden‚Äôs track record is a total failure when it comes to black America so why vote for him?
Even if the majority of people vote in 2020 the voters aren‚Äôt ideologically motivated they just hate trump or hate Biden. Or hate one more/less then the other. That doesn‚Äôt mean they‚Äôre democrat, socialist, anarchist or liberal. Just like how not all trump voters are racist.
I will stand by what I said. Lock it in. Oh yeah..Obama and Biden already showed us how to create a great economy. Republicans seem to always cause a Recession. Review your History. I got Facts on my side bro.
I'd be willing to bet that's all Biden and his inner circle are thinking about.
Barr &amp; Durham could come back with proof that Joe Biden is a serial killer, and he'd still be a better pick than Donald Trump in November. By far!
I am a strong Biden supporter volunteering for his campaign, and I want him to choose Harris for VP.  I talk to very strong Biden supporters all the time and no one is talking about this. Maybe this a drama only on Twitter?
Time to begin promoting Biden.
Good morning King!
Willingly.  If you try to make some sniveling statement about Biden as a reason for not voting against the candidate who can actually defeat Trump then you might as well support him. Vote to win, say it, or vote for him publicly and take the consequences
Your trash, how do you destroy Biden only to end up endorsing him

I don't know if I'd rather Biden chose Aunt Esther for VP or AG.
Shout-out to BSU Alumna, Carissa Smith ('16) for being featured in a recent article by  on her role as the women‚Äôs vote director for Joe Biden's presidential campaign.
Nina Turner has been trashing Biden so that's not logical because clearly Turner doesn't want the VP job. Barbara Lee didn't even want to challenge Pelosi for Speaker. These are 2 women who don't want that kind of responsibilities.
Lots of politics not much science. Twitter wants to bias election against Trump. Biden lies all the time on Twitter how come they don‚Äôt penalize him. Biden constantly shows miss-leading graphics all the time about COVID-19. Ed
and if Biden is stupid enough to debate, that will flip instantly
No doubt Warren could meet that test as well. I was assuming Biden would want to select an African-American woman, which at this point probably is the wisest course of action. But I will support whatever decision he makes.
We hear Greece likes Tom Hanks. If Joe Biden is elected you can‚Äôt escape what will follow when anarchists take control.They‚Äôll be in charge of most powerful military and our nuclear arsenal. I‚Äôll leave rest for your imagination.
Whomever Biden picks will come under ugly attack.  Which of the prospective candidates has demonstrated the ability to fight back effectively, and take it to Trump/Pence under the withering pressure of a national campaign? Sen. Harris might be safest bet to meet that test.
Not a chance Biden will debate anyway
It was nice that Joe Biden went to the viewing. Ed
Joe Biden will abandon America if elected President. Ed
This is another one of Joe Biden‚Äôs total lies. Even the MSM is noting the major progress be achieved by the President‚Äôs warp speed program with multiple highly promising vaccine programs running in parallel and making the virus so if passes all the tests can be provided ASAP. Ed
They‚Äôre all hiding like Joe Biden. Ed
We all know when Joe Biden isn‚Äôt plagiarizing someone he then lies. Ed
did you just see Nancy Pelosi with the Biden‚Äôs at the Rotunda for John Lewis Memorial pretty disrespectful that she is standing there engaging in a full blown conversation next to his coffin with her hands moving all over
Well, I think GOP plan is people have to work part-time so businesses can open safely by obeying social distancing, masks and washing hands.Nancy has socialism agenda, make Americans stay home, provide a free paycheck so businesses go broke so Biden gets elected. Ed

Biden doesn‚Äôt do well if he doesn‚Äôt know the questions in advance and Chris Wallace can be very probing in his questions, especially if Biden really wants to be President and the take over of our government by the far left. Ed
So if you want the federal govt to take away your single family homes and convert them into multi-unit public housing and force you to use public transportation,look what happened to NYC when pandemic hit,vote for Biden. But if you want to keep your suburban house vote for Trump!
Say what? Gillum never won a State elected office neither Congress why would Biden consider him for VP?
The choice is simple, Biden will be a weak President, send American jobs back to China, he‚Äôll cave into the mob,let our cities burn &amp; our economy to go down with it. Trump is a strong President, keep America safe &amp; peaceful, oppose the anarchists, &amp; bring jobs back to America. Ed
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
When anarchists take over they will destroy all these so called programs and burn America to the ground. So what will Joe Biden really do? He might get on Air Force One, fly to Beijing China, surrender to the CCP never to return. Ed
I've been an activist for years but like me, a lot of people I know have been paralyzed by outrage, disbelief, grief and some with fear. Last week, I shook it off. Began volunteering for Biden campaign and today I joined
kanye just tweeted this : I CAN BEAT BIDEN OFF and then some more words, just when i thought the election was as weird as it could get #wtf #VoteBlueToEndThisNightmare
The polls show Biden is a clear favorite 100 days out from an unprecedented election  These are phony polls since 1. You give Biden an 8 pt lead since you say 26% GOP &amp; 35% Dems,2.Dems aren‚Äôt afraid to talk while GOP are, mob may burn down their house. Ed

Do U think career staff at CDC had anything to do with what CDC issues now. They're probably making strong objections but being ignored. Their only other option is to resign. I don't want that. We will desperately need their expertise when Biden is POTUS
Both have liberal and conservative pockets. The rural areas are predictably conservative and the cities are predictably liberal. You can drive north in Maryland and go through one town that has all Biden signs and the next town is all trump

Plus, Biden said on Monday night that the vetting process was ongoing and described the process after the vetting is completed, which would  include interviews. All of that did not happen in the last two days.
Are you voting for Biden?
Biden needs to improve his support among Black and Hispanic voters, which is currently less than Hillary got. He's ahead by such a wide margin because he's getting more white support. Who knows if that will hold. Biden has to increase his support among POC.
So the far left is basically using the vote for Biden as protection money for America, a tactic normally used by gangs and mobsters. Ed
I fully support the  plan that will expand access to care for older Americans and those with disabilities and provide Universal Childcare and Pre-K, which have proven to be effective at setting up our children for success.
