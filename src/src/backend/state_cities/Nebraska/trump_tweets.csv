Not even remotely well thought out, honestly.  She has called herself 'pro-open borders' and has criticized Donald Trump's treatment of immigrants.  And yet here she is giving a pass to China for doing FAR worse.
They don’t have to be trained to find tRump lovers. They’re born to sniff assholes!
Us Americans too!
Dumb ass Lost 30M jobs and partially recouped 1.8M jobs.  That's the definition of "winning" that bankrupted the Trump casino.
Do you consider Latino voter outreach the key to defeating Trump?  Or is it just one important part of an overall strategy of reaching out to middle-class voters?
There are actually people out there who believe that Trump figured out that hydro chloroquine not only stops COVID but also uses COVID to CURE FUCKING CANCER. HOW IS THIS REAL LIFE???

She's great!  Smart, hardworking and dedicated to defeating tRump!  Can't wait to find out who she is.
So let me get this straight: the Republicans have been futzing around w the relief package &amp; not bringing a real working plan to the table. So now #Trump says he’s going to use “executive powers” to get the funds to people that need it. Anyone else see what I see? #DonTheCon
I love that 90% of these comments are anti-trump. Pack your bags Trump. 🤣 #WorstPresidentInHistory
Vote Trump out!

Reason number 1. So many people care about you. Reason number 2. You know you have people would do anything for you. Reason number 3. You have to see Rosalie grow up. Reason number 4. You know how sad we all would be to see you go Reason number 5. You have to outlive Trump
That’s why Trump calls everything a hoax because he’s always looking in the mirror at that ugly orange demon face as he talks badly about others.
Trump is interfering in our elections
I don't think anyone had Very Stable Genius signing Obamacare into law on their Trump bingo card, but then nobody knew health care could be so complicated, huh?
I wish we could see Obama’s candid reaction every time Trump blatantly rips him off like this.  It just has to involve the word “motherfucker.”
I Pray Our Love of Country fuels President Trump.

Trump &amp; Putin have chatted 8 times already this year! It’s an election year 🤷🏼‍♀️. Putin knows Trump needs lots of help. Even with the obedient GOP Senators, Trump can’t win without Russian help.

It’s felt like the US elected a criminal in 2016. I mean, how can anyone deny Trump’s motives for everything he does are self serving? He doesn’t know the constitution or the Bible. 🤷🏼‍♀️ Add an AG that says Trump can do anything he wants &amp; nobody can touch him.

The ammonium nitrate came from Russia, Trump's BFF. Apparently, somebody doctored the videos to make it look like it was hit by missile...which Trump believed as real. Is Trump's mental capacity for real?
Wtf is she drinking? Trump should be listening to the Dr. Not the other way around
Really Trump would be a BABBLING idiot by the third question!
Seriously?  Assange's output went down when he was holed up for several years out of fear of prosecution by the United States?  What a shock!  By the way, the Trump administration is STILL trying to prosecute him, specifically for helping Chelsea Manning.  That's still relevant.
Thanks for the clarification.  Anyway, Assange is Australian, so how did he commit treason?  Even if he were American, Trump and Russia (bad as they are) are not enemies of the United States.  (Russia may be, with the bounties in Afghanistan, but that came later.)
Let Trump do it. But when Biden or the next Dem takes office and creates Medicare for all I don’t want to hear about it.
Even with Pelosi and the Senate Democrats offering to cut 1 Trillion off the House Bill you still refuse to pass legislation.  Now President Trump is going to initiate a declaration for an act that the Legislative Branch is sworn to perform You are allowing a dictatorial act.

Our PRESIDENT speaking about a CONGRESSWOMAN ?? This is sickening &amp; every woman should be offended right now. AOC is a fucking icon who could run this country infinitely better than Trump - not that it would be hard to beat!
Twitter purging Trump supporters followers faster than Joe Biden is losing the black and hispanic vote!   #FACTS
Lies. I received more money because of the tax cuts Trump enacted.
Trump has barely maintained an even keel to run the country during ‘normal’ times. What I mean is the world didn’t blow up.   Whatever he uses, medication-wise, has kept the country just under full boil.  Now we have a deadly pandemic &amp; civil unrest (finally).  Watch this space.

Trump bans #TikTok &amp; #WeChat in 45 days via executive order. He banned "any transaction by any person..." What's a legal expert's definition of transaction? A slippery slope to censoring the #internet begins. #CyberSecurity

Yeah I'm well aware that Trump is a racist and I will never vote for the man or anyone who associates with him.  But how does that excuse Biden for the things mentioned in my tweet that you responded to (with an complete tangent no less)??
Yes. It's all about Trump all the time. #TotallyNotACult

Trump Winning is a given!  And none of Us are tired of Winning!
I guarantee someone is going to respond to this with "well that's a vote for Trump". They only know the dichotomy and Trump being bad (like yes we know) excuses everything Biden has ever done or said.
It’s supported by data and facts. Trying to convince anti science,  anti expert, trump cult guy is futile. Enjoy your vacation to Scribner Ne because Americans aren’t allow to travel to other 1rst world  countries.
Nope if there a unification fight that’ll trump it
This is my personal opinion! Anyone who supports ,enables,voted or will vote for Donald Trump will &amp;has the blood of everyone who has an will die of covid-19 on their hands for ALL ETERNITY!!! An I hope you ALL end up in Hell
White phony Christians who claim the name but don’t act Christlike in any way are Trump’s base. I am as disgusted with their deraved actions as you are. The Bible describes  these phonies who claim God while doing ungodly actions as blasphemies- an old time word for the damned.

Agree that Biden says stupid things and will say more. Kind of a shitshow, really. He's not racist, of course. He has the grace and humility to apologize. Awaiting Trump's apology for saying he's "against God."
tRump’s fear is how he shows respect. His fear of Joe shows his knowledge that Joe is superior to himself, and his ego can’t stand it!
Manhattan DA subpoenaed Trump's financial records from Deutsche Bank and got them
It tells me that there are many petty, selfish, hateful, evil, and intellectually challenged people among us. Poor excuses for humanity that enjoy the chaos tRump causes!
Right.
Susan Collins should think about all the people Donald Trump has offended. He instigates hate every day. He is the crazy guy yelling on the bull pit every day!
and  , vaccines don't shut down the disease. Vaccinations do. Given a growing anti-vaccine bias that pre-dates COVID and Trump's dismissal of science, how do we get sufficient participation to establish herd immunity? Force Trump to respond to this.
Trump is such a sad loser. If anyone is against God it is Trump - child trafficker - admitted rapist - admitted adulterer - admitted felon - fraud - prostitute’s John  - racist and all the things GOD IS NOT- that’s Trump. Looking in the mirror again and opening lying mouth.
You ARE aware of how Trump sees Blacks, right, Ari?
The orders take effect in 45 days and could bar the popular apps from the Apple and Google app stores, effectively removing them from U.S. distribution.
For all those who have been cheering for Trump to use EOs to bend the framework of the Constitution and using a secret police force to quiet the 1st amendment.  Those very things you cheer will be how Biden goes after guns.   #carefulwhatyouaskfor
One of Trump’s most moronic moments... “You can’t do that.” ... wait, what??!!
Not true. Reps make laws. Our elected officials such as Trump have powers to create rules that act like laws. Trump can enact Martial Law in the interest of national security without any vote by the people.
Ha ha you hate the gays and love Trump then pretend you’re bipartisan. NE-2 sees through your fear tactics.
Actually, they lost them because the House passed its plan in May and McConnell and Trump dithered until late July.
Cool, now do the Patriot Act.
Imagine trying to gaslight the entirety of the English speaking nations on earth just to support Trump.
For respect to be real, it is felt. For respect to be real, it is seen.  For respect to be unfelt and unseen it isn’t respect, it’s fear and pity. tRump neither commands, or deserves respect.  That derision he gets, he EARNED that!
I do not honestly care about thighland or yo semites. Even great speakers stumble over words sometimes or say things out of order. However, Trump is a piece of shit human being. That is why he will lose in November. Allowing the focus to get away from that is letting him win.
The tv networks better goddamn well not show Trump every goddamn night, if/when he loses.  I have had enough of his goddamn voice.
You have to choose between Trump and this guy
You do realize that I'm extremely not a Trump supporter right?
Let’s face it. To support Trump and the personal attacks he levels on 60% of the country, and directly on Joe Biden, you have to be shameless.

Let the young people of our life, LIVE LIFE! Protect the vulnerable and treat the sick! MY GOD! I can not wait until November when Trump wins and this all goes away!
A. Your entire politics is centered around opposition of one man, Trump, who employs childish name-calling tactics regularly. Yet you employ those same tactics. Why is that?  B. I am not privy to this "reframing" of Biden's. But I'm sure it was articulate &amp; poignant. Fill me in??
Good question. I will cut back Twitter 90% after Trump is ousted. But, I tried to quit once and only made it two days. Shit's addictive. I think I'd have to delete my account. I'll be in consultation with myself and we'll make an announcement sometime in 2021. Stay tuned. 😆
Omg, Joe, has had a lifetime stuttering issue does’nt always explain his positions as well as  wish he did. But he never willfully lies, uses  inappropriate words to describe others or spew hate like DJT. He is a good man, father, husband, and patriot. Trump is none of these.
He doesn't want to win. He's just trying to stay one step ahead of law and avoid prison. Because in prison, real men would make Trump their bitch. He's terrified of that.
Now that so many of us who didn't know before have tasted the poison all too well, we need to completely drain the supply. And we can't do that by letting the DNC win with Biden. So yes 4 more years of that rancid Trump poison taste is worth it if we can start afresh in 2024.
The water's already poisoned beyond fixing. Has been since the very beginning, under Republican and Dem alike. We need to drain the supply completely &amp; rebuild the entire infrastructure. Electing Biden is like masking the taste of the poison whereas under Trump it's revolting.
Our numbers nation wide are sky rocketing, thank u idiot Trump.  Your model skips cold &amp; fly season here also entirely.  Maybe it’s due to weather ?  At least where I live snow and cold temps are common Nov-March
It's my position that telling the DNC to go fuck itself instead of voting for Biden - who wrote the '94 crime bill and represents corporate cronyism and demonization of the black community just as Trump does - will lead us to brighter years ahead while giving into Biden does not
...I'm a white cis male so I can't begin to understand how you feel in light of everything that's transpired 2015-present. Thus I can't shame you for voting for the only viable option to oust trump we've been given. But we can't let the DNC continue to abuse and gaslight us.
You're right that it has moved the needle. White supremacy, bigotry, and xenophobia are mainstreamed/normalized now more than ever. Idk if cops would feel emboldened to attack journalists at protests under Hillary. However police brutality &amp; BLM protests far predate Trump...
That's how Trump perceives Ohio folks as out of touch, hill billies that know nothing about Joe Biden. But Ohio seems to respond to Trump's snake oil pitch.
The DNC-their corporate and ruling class interests above all else-already promised us 4 years of no meaningful change. Sorry you don't like seeing Trump on TV/in the news (neither do I) but I'd rather do 4 more years of him and have a chance in '24...
Trump is only good for  grabbing them by the kitten.
Because of the DNC's choice to coalesce against Bernie and force Biden down the electorate's throat, we are stuck with either 4 more years of Trump (and a chance to nominate an actual progressive in 2024) or 4 years of "nothing will fundamentally change" and a likely GOP 2024 win
Whut the whut? This sentiment amd the quote it came in is like the script to a bad Adult Swim cartoon.   Trump: Biden will 'hurt the Bible, hurt God,' guns
Trump cares more about a kid's app than the pandemic or bounties on American soldiers or the environment or voting rights or black lives or seniors in nursing homes or . . .
Dont understand this logic, the alternative is to not vote or trump. Unless you're holding out for Kanye.
Trump apologist with no content knowledge in foreign affairs will provide us with ample solutions?  The laughs never stop.  Cheers!
This sounds like something out of an SNL skit from right after Trump was elected.
Trump and Much will just use the extra money not spent from the first stimulus and I believe they can leverage it up?
Please don’t tell me I have to choose between Trump and this guy
It shouldn't be a debate. Biden lives by the Bible, Trump uses it for photo ops.
Trump said voting for Biden is going to hurt God like its a bad thing
Fuck, man—they don’t lie to your goddamned face this much in late night infomercials.  I hear tell the Shamwow was actually a hell of an absorbent towel.  But Trump?  Hot air and sweaty desperation.
I guess the treasonous and unpatriotic flag desecration doesn’t apply to Trump supporters?
I just don’t know how  didn’t say “of course I fucking hate Trump everybody fucking hates Trump!” When asked by the GOP sycophants at the hearing!  OK I might be projecting because that’s what I would do. But still: hats off for the composure!

This might be why Trump has gotten away with murder. Revealing. Worth a read.
Are you daft? Biden could pick my dog as VP &amp; it would still be a better ticket than the one headed by Trump.
Trump’s choice for Ambassador to Germany thinks it’s sick that the Germans continue to confront their atrocities in and around World War II. Which makes him the perfect and obvious choice for this administration.
Vote this Trump enabler out.
He's correct  is definitely against the kind of religion tRump and some of his folks practice.  Poor Jerry Jr. might have to change his practices.
Not only this, Trump may start kissing babies !!!!
Trump 2020. MAGA!
Donald Trump isn't shredding the Constitution! And I should know, I'm John Yoo and I wrote memos designed to shred the Constitution for the Bush administration. Send $$$.
I'll argue the opposite. Put both Biden and Trump under floodlights between now &amp; Election Day, refusing to shut up about how they are slaps in the faces of the working class &amp; BIPOC. Generate shockingly low R/D turnout (&amp; high Green turnout) thereby forcing the DNC's hand in '24
Trump's a racist!!  This proves it!!!

Trump just said that if Biden is elected, he will double, triple, and quadruple your taxes.  Then he said it will be "depression time".
This is seriously just a non political observation about trump. I wish I loved talking about anything as much as he likes talking about different names that he calls things and why he does that.

Trump is right, Biden will do as Obama, jail Kim Davis, sue the Little Sisters of the Poor, force to pay for abortion and contraception, and Biden would never protect bakers from the lgbt mob suing them. Biden hates christians.

I knew a couple years ago that as time went on Trump &amp; the GOP would do more &amp; more outrageous things. Unchecked, they would get more emboldened. Look at how brazen they are now. Between Barr, McConnell, the “hearing” with Sally Yates, Durham… It’s a free-for-all!
My question is: will they keep pence as VP so that when trump is totally incapacitated the party can effectively puppeteer that milquetoast? Or will they put a strong-willed ‘true’ bully in that slot to cut out the middleman when Trump is out of the picture?
Trump's inability to express a coherent thought? That's a 100% legit area of concern. Likewise Biden's "age issues". I'd love to see a debate moderator press both of them on that.
My main concern is how easy it is to go from legit concern to outright mockery. The ad is the latter. Trump has a history of mocking people with disabilities/differences and he has rightly been criticized for it. It's wrong to do the same to him.
I certainly hope nobody starts photoshopping penises or anything like that into Trump photos. Really! Don’t do that!
One thing I would have to disagree with: Trump never dominated anything. I think people let themselves be dominated. People that worship money they’ll never have by fawning over a guy that lied about having it. It’s literally the only thing that ever got him paid, or laid.
Passed a BLUE sign that read: “ALL LIVES MATTER. Jesus died for ALL of our sins.” It was proudly displayed next to a trump sign. If he gets voted out in November, the hatred &amp; bigotry he ignited isn’t leaving with him.

The only thing the trump presidency has done right is shown us how many complete and utter idiots we have in this country
It must suck to actually be held accountable for all of trump's lies.  He should have been thrown off social media 4 years ago.
I report sports on-air and online then here on social media share my opinions on politics and other topics. None of that carries over on-air, where I work. My on-air coverage included saying that police needed to act, which has nothing to do with Trump or how I feel about BLM.
would be smart to pass on debates, if that's possible. All Trump does is lie and drags opponents down in the mud. They end-up wasting time fact-checking Trump so nothing productive comes of the debate. It becomes all about Trump, just like his entire presidency.
If this happens there will need to be another revolution to take democracy back from king Trump.

Gone like shining a light up your rear end to get rid of the coronavirus ? Or maybe drinking a little disinfectant? Sorry Trumpers you don’t have crap on Joe-and you’ll never be able to talk about him being too far gone when Trump is bragging about differentiating a cow on test.
Trump told them don't believe your own eyes or ears &amp; they don't crazy shit
I am with you! Hopefully prisoners , like Trump don’t have Twitter privileges
Donald Trump
I just saw that Biden has a 3% national lead &amp; he hasn't even debated Trump yet. Trump will gain ground thanks to debates just as he did in 2016. There is somehow far less enthusiasm for Biden than there was for Hillary. Plus Trump has political power now &amp; can play even dirtier.
And she showed up. Trump and his cronies refuse to testify.
I really don't understand how after 2016 we can look at mid-2020 national polls / polls from a few purple/red-leaning states &amp; act like Trump is a huge underdog again. He's not. Follow the campaign money &amp; look at how little Biden is offering for those who didn't show for Hillary
So you hate trump
Trump family indictments!
Trump’s indictment!
Have trump find it on a map!
Really don’t need to see Trump’s mini-morel...
Communist Chinese and the EU doing all they can to elect #CreepySleepyJoeBiden should give every single true blooded American even more incentive to re-elect president Trump. Sticking it to the globalists and the Communists should be top priority! Taking out leftist is a bonus.
Aren't you supposed to be big on leadership deficits?   This is the President, you know, speculating like any idiot.
Very few are. Before China sent this virus to the US, Trump had the economy humming and things were great! Unemployment at record lows! More blacks working and successful than ever. Black entrepreneurs killing it! My retirement accounts were overflowing! Damn China virus!
Is this for real? I know this is joking, but what audience are you aiming at here? I’m married with 3 children and since the pandemic hit, every is a crapshoot if we will be able to pay our bills. I’m  going to vote against Trump but I find this out of touch with reality
Hatch Act. Quit your taxpayer-funded job and go collect a paycheck from the Trump campaign for the work you’re already doing.
"Special counsel Robert Mueller ultimately concluded after a two-year investigation that he could not prove a conspiracy, though he found that the Trump campaign welcomed and made strategic use of Democratic emails stolen by Russian intelligence officers" 🙄
4+ years has proven one undeniable truth! The corrupt Washington DC swamp and the Lame Stream Radical left media hate Donald Trump because he is the ultimate anti socialist Globalist Liberal who can't be controlled like #CrookedHillary was going to be!  #VoteTrumpAgain #KAG
Why aren’t they kicking him out due to his 85 million dollar conflict of interest. He’s a Trump cultist to the core out to USPS and America.  Give him the boot. And soon.
Ignore everything that Trump the Ripper baby killer says.haven’t heard any truth from him yet. He’s all out to profit whatever way he can. Blind cultists are crazy who follow him.
He also predicted Trump would be kicked out of office via the 25th amendment.
Trump doesn’t care.!hes on free dole healthcare right now for which he pays nothing.
After he’s President he will listen and hone in on the issues. Trump has done nothing about this issue except interject more illegal police type violence.
I think that would help them down ticket, judging from what my anto trump conservative father in law says.
The real fun is when/if President Trump doesn’t get re elected in my opinion.
Even with all that, you would still do less damage than trump has
I bet Donald Trump hates boobs. That's why he is such a miserable human being.
If you're someone with a significant platform, use it responsibly please.  There's too many left leaning folks deluding themselves into the idea that Biden and Trump are equitable. They're not. Neoliberalism is preferable to fascism. That doesn't make neolib good. Nuance please.
If you don't see how neoliberalism is preferable to fascism I don't think there's any argument that could reach you.  Yeah Biden sucks, but to think Biden is exactly as bad as Trump is deceiving yourself.  If you're against fascism you'd be pretty strongly against Trump.
Trump rewarded the swamp.
Prolife?  How do you figure with the tRump Admin bringing back executions?  Just say what you mean..the most controlling of women admin in history.
If trump would have came out in the beginning  and said masks were great, everyone would be wearing one. Democrats because they believe in science &amp; Trumpers because they believe in their trump lord
That’s Trump and the gop majority cult followers of his - twisted cruelty in all they do.!

Trump just said “my son’s an environmentalist “ what the fuck? He kills endangered animals for SPORT
Agree. Trump will just lie and lie so there's no point.
And Ricketts knows this. So the fact that he keeps saying it gives up his game: He's just trying to look like a tough guy, maybe angling for a gig in a second Trump term, or at least a tweet from the big guy? Whatever it is, he's beclowning himself.  2/2
The trump campaign is full of lies Lmao like you guys act like this is anything new. He’s a desperate old fuck.
voted for Trump. What a mistake!! Every day is unfathomable with him!! I literally have apologized to my friends!
He would also never endorse Trump. Though if he was forced to choose between them, I suspect he would choose Biden, since Trump is the antithesis of the morals and values of both parties.
Pentagon Officials Say Trump Was Talking Nonsense When He Called Beirut Explosion an Attack

It is literally why we have Trump as President. It is why the GOP have lost their way in Trumpism’s wake. And Trumps feeds it every day, intentionally and unintentionally. Hannity Ingram Tucker set the standard for this. AM airwaves dominated by right wing pundits.

Journalists are college-educated and tend to be Democrats. That's why Trump attacks the press. Side stat: College-educated women in 2016 were -6% against Trump. Now it's -67%. College-educated women are the demographic that's going to rescue America from trumpism. Thanks ladies!
It's what happens when you listen to Trump &amp; consume Fox Entertainment News &amp; Propaganda all day. Both those entities are a big reason why the U.S. has never gotten a handle on #COVID19. They muddied the water to the point where way too many people don't take the virus seriously.
I stand for the flag, I stand for our country and if I lose the election because of it than that’s fine with me.  I wont back down.  -President Trump. #ILovethisguy
You spelled "trump supporters" wrong....
How irresponsible. As  says: "Wars have started over less." When Trump was pressed by the press why he thought it was an attack , Trump said, "Well, it SEEMS like an attack."
The funniest part of this is our future President, Joe Biden, doesn’t have to say or do anything. Trump’s mouth along with people like you are campaigning for him. You’re just to stupid to realize what you are doing.
President Trump signed on Tuesday legislation that designates nearly $3 billion annually for conservation projects and maintenance of federally owned lands.
Trump followers listen up!
A real President (Number 46 Biden) will care about the American people not just his pocketbook as Trump the Ripper does. Can’t wait! God help us.
How can Donald Trump ignore 2 million Americans suffering in the pandemic- Puerto Rican Americans suffering floods - Americans suffering from Hurricane Isaias - &amp;express his sympathy and support for Lebanon - an enemy of the US? Another stupid distraction where he lied to press.

If we had a functioning media Anderson Cooper or Chuck Todd or whatever would have done what Jonathan Swan did... back in like January 2017.  But I guess nobody thought to ask Trump basic followup questions
Good ear. Thx, but I really try to listen to Trump as little as possible. Difficult to do, his buffoonery has dominated the airwaves for so long now.
With the shenanigans trump &amp; the #gop are using to suppress voting, all gloves should be off.   If it makes  cry on camera then so be it. 𝗜𝗧 𝗜𝗦 𝗪𝗛𝗔𝗧 𝗜𝗧 𝗜𝗦.  It’ll make for great television which seems to be the only thing he thinks is important.
For example, I think MSNBC has a liberal agenda.  FOX has a conservative agenda.  But CBS, ABC, and NBC do well.  If the CBS news says "Trump's handling of the pandemic response has been a disaster," is that true?  The numbers say it's true, but you might hear a liberal agenda.

The thing is: reporters have to be very prepared before interviewing a person like Trump. Otherwise, he will bulldoze like bullies do. You have to anticipate his every answer and cut-in when Trump spews falsehoods and call him out. You can't be polite. You gotta think fast.
Trump hates everyone that lives in a blue city or a blue state. He wants no federal funds to reach you if you live in a blue city or blue state. Is that patriotic? It certainly isn’t presidential or Christ like. It’s evil plain &amp; simple.

Listened with interest to both your interview w/  and your longer, podcast conversation with him. Two points I wished you would have raised.  1. The rise of Conservative Hate media/Gingrich-style politics, which prefigures Trump by decades.
Back in February, I remember telling co-workers that every candidate left was a guy in his 70s, one has a lot of competency questions, one had a recent heart attack and Trump is the youngest one. Not great.
It's not for you to believe. How does God tell you to treat your neighbor? Your throwing in of these photos speak more to your walk with God, than Donald Trump's. As your sister, I'm strongly suggesting you work on comprehending the verses in the text, not just memorizing.❤
Remember after he was elected, and everyone who met him at Trump Tower came oitbsinging his praises? Do you ever wonder why? Or why those people were then immediately castigated for doing so? Do you believe God grants us our leaders, or we are supposed to be subject to them...
It amazes me how a post about God’s Love can be misconstrued as Trump Derangement Syndrome.
If you're a Christian, what you're doing to someone who claims to be a Christian is a sin. Donald trump is, in fact, your "neighbor" is the biblical sense. We are called on to ACT like Christ, even when it's difficult.
Trump bungling a Venezuelan coup, despite bipartisan support, was one of the more accidentally humane things he's ever done
Biden did a fine job debating Sanders last winter. I would think the set up would have to be the same— no audience for Trump to play to. After watching the Axios/ Swan interview, I would think the Trump camp would be worried. Trump won’t look good with his nonspecific answers.

As President Trump said, "It is what it is."  In lawyer speak, "res ipsa loquitir."  What worries me most is, I'm not sure if he knows what he's saying is not supported by facts.  What I see is a bizarre distortion or interpretation of facts, which seems to contradict reality.

"Yay Donald Trump for doing the bare minimum. Have I sufficiently licked your boots so you don't tweet at me?"
Has Biden indicated that he doesn't want to debate? Trump is wholly unaware of what's going on in the world, as he showed in that  interview. Seems like a preemptive attempt to justify calling off presidential debates so  doesn't embarrass himself.
Take a bow, Ryan.  You're nearly as bad at lying and great at whining as Trump.

What's with the spate of opinion pieces by members of Trump's government or campaign team lately? This is clearly a coordinated effort to get positive coverage with your logo attached, but it's just dishonest drivel that doesn't meet your journalistic standards.
Twitter is trying too hard to be "fair" with their summary, "Donald Trump talks about the COVID-19 pandemic and Rep. John Lewis' legacy in new interview".  "Donald Trump dismisses John Lewis' legacy and staunchly defends his misconceptions about COVID" would be more apt.
Nah. Save your pity for those who are suffering from his actions/lack of actions. Trump is totally undeserving of our concern. He sure did squirm though!

And to think the Trump campaign is advocating for more than 3 debates with Biden. Do they really feel Trump shuffling charts and repeating lines his handlers have pounded into his thick Neanderthal skull are going to make him “presidential”?

Are you really expecting trump to be civil? That boat sailed years ago and you fu*kers let him keep on doing it
the old white man racist GOP was desperate for a candidate and they didn’t care how he got elected . If Obama hasn’t preceded Trump, he never gets elected or even nominated probably wouldn’t have even run
Pathetic is the Trump Administration blaming others for not getting job done regarding coronavirus
OK, I'll admit it: I do make scroll through TikTok every so often, so I guess I wouldn't mind a US buyer coming through.

Waah, I don't know John Lewis. John Lewis chose not to come to my inauguration. I never met John Lewis actually. By the way, no one has done more for Black Americans than I, Donald Trump, have. Waah, he didn't to come to my inauguration; he didn't come to any of my speeches. Waah

So if a state passes a bill that president Trump can sue them if he doesn’t like it? What BS.
But how do you KNOW Trump will be in prison?
Trump’s threats of executive orders &amp; suing everyone, suing  blue states, suing blue governors, sending armed troops to blue cities, wiping out USPS...is getting old &amp; it’s useless. The dope will be voted out in a landslide if this continues.
When it comes to the voting procedures of the various states, Trump can have an opinion, but he doesn't get a vote.
Every medical expense went up under Trump.
He’s a slimy competitor of the USPS and out to destroy them . Illegal unConstitutional conflict of interest. As bad a con man as Trump.bcongress needs to stop this man right now. All will be liable for his felonies.

President Donald Trump is claiming he has the authority to issue an executive order on mail-in ballots, though it is is unclear what he could do to curtail the practice.
Bacon voted for the Trump lawsuit aimed at throwing out the ACA and pre-existing condition protections by judicial fiat.  In 2017, Bacon voted for a bill that would have gutted these protections.

Can’t wait for each member of the GOP to get infected with COVID one by one and then ... “Eh tu Brute, then fall Ceasar”. May the virus infect Trump ,  may he fall , fall, fall

Trump says  can't handle mail-in ballots. Guess, he forgot about Christmas season.
It is a waste of time right now. The Senate won’t vote against Trump. He needs to be voted out of office and then let the charges fall where they may with Barr out of the picture.

He's repeated it about 100 times. Trump thinks if he keeps repeating something it'll magically become true.
Trump just we're bigger than India and China. Good try, champ.
With 157,000 dead Americans -- more than any other country -- Trump is touting the decline in mortality rate. Talk about putting lipstick on a pig.
Yeah he's crazy.  Never proclaimed myself to be pro-Trump or pro-Biden.  Just thought it was interesting how you blamed Trump for a concert in October being cancelled when it's pretty clear that a majority of the world will be in the same boat.
That everything bad that has happened on Earth since January 20, 2017 is Trump’s fault?  Nothing would have been able to “open” until a proven vaccine is released.

I think trump made a mistake, not the first time 🤦‍♂️ he meant sloppy joe. Stumbling through his words....his best decoy would be a sloppy joe. HOPE 2020 🤷‍♂️
Trump's foreign policy is praise dictators and give the middle finger to allies.
I don’t often like to talk about politics, but I think the DNC choosing Biden as their running candidate guarantees that Trump is our president for another 4 years. I’m fairly certain Trump wins again.
Actually the report i saw said he did quietly as not to enrage trump.
Trump is going to get someone killed!
If Trump could tell us the geographic dialect differences that resulted in why he chose to say Thighland, I would be astounded. He was ignorant of it but got lucky. Just like a stopped grandfather clock is still accurate twice a day.
I was startled awake this morning by a dream that nominated Bruce Springsteen. I’d be fine with that too, so long as he isn’t Trump

They will instantly try to distance themselves from Trump.  Begin to  become fiscally conservative again.  Worry about the deficit.  The fringe GOP will try and drum up all kinds of moronic lawsuits/hearings about Biden/corruption.  America will not forget their current treachery
Trump seems to have no idea how Coronavirus is spreading in the U.S. or how it is impacting our economy &amp; society. Trump is clueless.
Though the Trump argument was long gone because it was heated and it was our entire general chat. But there are some pieces of his other conversations.
Donald Trump has no idea what Obamacare covers or how it works economically. Covering preexisting conditions requires spreading that cost over all insured people.

In the Trump administration we know someone can actually buy a government position by giving $$M to the Trump campaign or to Trump directly.  Ambassadorship. Education Director. USPS Director.  when did government jobs become a commodity?
So Trump called his press conference a political event and also a protest so he didn't have to follow any rules or regulations on wearing masks or anything else.  Why did we sit there and have to pay for him to have a political rally at his own club that he's paying himself for

I truly feel if the Dems replaced Sleep Joe with a moderate, likable candidate with Barack endorsing and calling for national unity, Trump would be in trouble.  There's a reason he's choosing not to.
Barack Obama is just as white as he is black.   Right now he has a chance to put politics aside and unite the country. He's one of the best orators of our time. He could be the bigger person than Trump.

Trump signed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, which lowered corporate and estate taxes permanently, and lowered most individual income tax rates temporarily while increasing them for some.
A key part of President Trump's economic strategy during his first three years (2017–2019) was to boost economic growth via tax cuts and additional spending, both of which significantly increased federal budget deficits.

I hate that I have to vote for him. I understand that this is less racist than Trump, but come on.
Why, the 'stable genius', Trump, who SPOKE OF IT, would ALSO probably tell you, right to your face, without blinking an eye, that it is located SOUTH of ASSLand (not ICELAND) and NORTH of FOOTLand (not Finland). Trump SEEMS to LIVE in an ALTERNATE UNIVERSE; other than THIS WORLD!
His heart is with Donald Trump. Don’t be fooled.
Trump has been the most toxic person to ever occupy the Oval Office. He cares only about himself. He is way over his head and knows absolutely nothing about governing. The country can not afford another 4 years of this conman. Biden is honest, competent, and ready to lead.
Yeah I can see that. And no, I wasn’t aiming to claim trump is or is better for what the US needs. Just weak leadership imo from the DNC. Buttigieg, Gabbard, or Yang would have been my picks. Yang would have won in a landslide with Covid and his platform of universal income.

Same. I’m just exhausted as is and now I’m supposed to send my kids to school on Monday! I’m so afraid!!! We already lost my husband but now one of us could die! Trump cares more about the money than the people. Why couldn’t they just keep school closed a little longer?!🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️
How can you put your trust in someone who constantly puts out lies about the pandemic? He keeps saying it will just go away when the health experts dispute this. 160,000 Americans are now dead and it’s anticipated that will grow to 300,000 by years end. Trump is to blame.
That’s just a baseless Trumper talking point. You better come up with something better than that. Biden (and most anyone else) would have done a better job containing the pandemic. Perhaps if Trump had not thought it a hoax and developed a coherent plan fewer would have died.

That’s such a stupid comment. The virus is “floating around” because Trump has failed to control it. People are turning to Biden because they realize he would have taken the pandemic seriously and designed a national response to it. Fewer people would have died as a consequence.
What does it mean, Meghan? 🤔 Because Trump has actually done IN THREE YEARS what Establishment Republicans have told us they wanted to do for decades. Your dad sucked hind tit with the rest of the do-nothing GOP for far too long. GET ON BOARD. #TRUMP2020
Donald Trump is both the culmination of decades of the GOP pandering to the worst instincts of Americans AND a unique threat to the survival of the Republic itself. There are people who had no problem with the former who are still going to be concerned about the latter.
Republican values have always been trumps values that’s why they have no problem enabling and supporting him, they have never supported the ideas of helping those  who are disenfranchised. All trump did was bring the hypocrisy of the Republicans to light!!

What has happened to Marco Rubio? He has never recovered from being called “little” Marco by Donald Trump. It permanently diminished his stature among Republicans. No everything he does seems small and irrelevant.

That's what I never understood how Democrats can continue to lie about Trump selling out the Putin when the Russian economy is in dumps because of Trump's actions against Russia aggression. Unlike under the Democrats where Russia expands power. CNN watchers, so easy to play
I’m so tired of you Trump people immediately turning to saying things like “brainwashing” and “fake news” when you have nothing intellectual to add to a conversation. It’s so trite and over used. I guess when your house is built on sand there is not much you could say. So sad.
Great 🙄 what is the non lawyer going to say. Oh just another attack on Trump prolly.
Today is the 75th anniversary of the first usage of an atomic weapon as an act of war. Using these weapons is immoral. Trump has awoken a new nuclear arms race by abandoning our non-proliferation treaties and restarting device development and testing after 28 years of inactivity.

Also in 1980: Sydney, Australia rejected Trump's bid to build a casino for two reasons: 1. Per usual, he over-inflated his worth. And, wait for it... 2. His ties to the mafia! Trump has played both sides. He's a informant and he's a criminal. That's how he got away with it.

Trump says kids have to go to school regardless of virus status, but election that affects him isn't safe enough to do right now. WTF?
The dates of federal elections are enshrined in federal law and would require an act of Congress to change.
Pres. Trump suggests a delay of the 2020 election.  It’s important to note elections dates are set by law and Congress would have to act to move the date. Elections are also run locally, not by feds. There are several hurdles if the president is serious about this.Did he just say Trump is trying to give us something we already have? Even though Trump is actively working to take it away? I must be confused but how do you give someone something they already have

Donald Trump has no idea what Obamacare covers or how it works economically. Covering preexisting conditions requires spreading that cost over all insured people.

I truly feel if the Dems replaced Sleep Joe with a moderate, likable candidate with Barack endorsing and calling for national unity, Trump would be in trouble.  There's a reason he's choosing not to.
Barack Obama is just as white as he is black.   Right now he has a chance to put politics aside and unite the country. He's one of the best orators of our time. He could be the bigger person than Trump.

Trump signed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, which lowered corporate and estate taxes permanently, and lowered most individual income tax rates temporarily while increasing them for some.
A key part of President Trump's economic strategy during his first three years (2017–2019) was to boost economic growth via tax cuts and additional spending, both of which significantly increased federal budget deficits.

Joe Biden knows a thing or two about being Vice President.💛
In addition, we should do what we can to facilitate early voting. Biden could recommend a schedule, maybe based on last name, that would streamline the process fir retirees and others with flexible schedules. And it would be a good example of leadership.
Biden isn't going to veto something for being too progressive. Just like Trump signed a bunch of stuff incompatible with his platform because Paul Ryan wrote and passed it.
Part of the reason that the specific policies don't play a role is that on matters of legislation the President is really not that influential beyond party allegiance.  Congress will write the bills.  Regardless of whether it were Biden or Harris or even Sanders
And as with Trump, reporters must agree to ask bonehead questions, with NO followup, and take everything Biden says at face value.

My main vote will go to   as I agree with almost everything she says, bonus points she's not wildly racist, or a pedophile like Biden, and his new BFF Kamala Harris or as I like to call her Stalin 2.0 #Democrats #Republicans #Libertarians  #nomoretwopartysystem
Of course, because Biden is going to be with Harris today, Trump has to have a news convenience with Pence. If nothing else, he is predictable. #TrumpIsACompleteFailure #BidenHarris2020
Callers have reported their signs are missing. We're out of  Biden signs.  They are HOT.   Get Kate Bolz for Congress signs at her tailgate, 7 pm, Wed, Aug. 19 at IBEW  #LNK
Of course Jared is supporting Kanyr. He snd Zivsnka just went to Wyoming to bribe Kanye to run to hopefully take votes from Biden. They’re both frauds who have stolen taxpayer funds for their personal is. Kanye is a worse mental midget than Trump,
I noticed and think that is a real statement about leadership. Biden believes in himself enough that he doesn't need someone who strokes his ego. He want someone who challenges and makes him think.
Umm, that's a hard "NO" from this Suburban Housewife. I can't wait to #VoteByMailEarly  for  &amp;  and the thought of  in any position in Biden's administration is delightful!  #BidenHarris2020
the latest polls suggest Biden is leading slightly in the Catholic vote, and that has to “burn” most one issue voters like Tobin. they know Trump is amoral, but he is just a tool to save their “religious freedom”. Which by the way, means freedom to discriminate against gays,etc.
Here’s the ugly reality.  Make life as miserable as possible for people before the November election.  You would not be seeing these shutdowns late in the summer with Biden as president and you certainly would not see COVID day after day leading national newscasts.
I AM SO EXCITED ABOUT HARRIS &amp; BIDEN!!! The enthusiasm &amp; energy created by Joe's VP pick is palpable...together we will VOTE OUT the dictator-in-chief and restore America's democracy. For the 1st time in 3+ years I feel hope ✊❤
Lol, 😂😂😂. Yeah, and Biden is also using Bernie's "manifesto" and going to kill the middle class with $3T in new taxes.
Umm, Kamala Harris? She called Biden a segregationist and a rapist, now she’s his running mate.
Do you have something worthwhile to do today? You will never measure up to the accomplishments and character of Biden
It’s okay to dislike Kamala and still know the right thing to do it to vote for Biden. Do I want either of them in office? No. But do I want Trump out?? YES
I didn't watch the clip but I did watch the primary season. Harris is radical left and will say whatever she thinks is the right answer. Reminds me of Hillary. Biden says whatever he's told to say.
Yeah, I’ve seen people state they weren’t voting for Biden now. This isn’t the year to vote independent. It simply isn’t.
Former Vice President Joe Biden ends his running-mate process having traveled a far-reaching distance -- for his campaign and perhaps for a country that has never before had a woman of color on a presidential ticket.
Maybe - I’m really not enthusiastic given some of the names I’ve heard
So in your opinion, not only is Biden not a real Catholic, but Barack Obama is???
Biden/Harris all the way!
&amp; people are really tryna act like joe Biden is the better option.. THEYRE BOTH EQUALLY BAD
That’s how the Trump campaign works NOT how Biden works.  Trumps incapable of running a show or .... basically anything. Name a success of Dementia J Trump. 🤷🏼‍♀️⚠️
I do not want to disparage Joe Biden, but White male dominance in American politics needs to end.  I know Joe is helping to make this happen.
I am sure Biden will have all the answers....if he can just remember them.
That name still gets me haha. This sounds like something Biden would say trying to remember what their name was 😆
Biden will do just fine embarrassing himself...
Get to know Kamala Harris, Joe Biden's pick for Vice President.
dems really backed themselves into a corner on this whole kamala/biden/trump situation. talked negatively about kamala and biden for months because there were MUCH better candidates but now have to speak positively on them because it's the only chance to get trump out of office
Biden and Obama were worthless on H1N1. DemoRats hail mary alomg with racial divide going into the election. Pathetic
Judging by how hard and kinda desperately Republicans, including assorted MAGAs in my timeline, are going at Harris, Biden seems to have chosen wisely.
I'm not interested in relitigating Tulsi Gabbard's presidential campaign now that Kamala Harris is Biden's running mate. Tulsi is a good person. Demonizing her will only make the Biden/Harris ticket unlikeable for people who are already on the edge but willing to suck it up.
Damn...dude has every right to drag Biden through the mud like this. The gloves are off.
That's impossibly naive or willfully ignorant.  Trump is wretched, Biden and Harris decent and better for the country in every way.
There are people in this world who are going to buy into the “Joe Biden as a radical leftist candidate” rhetoric and that is never going to stop being hilarious to me.
Nope ! I would have preferred one of the other candidates. I will still vote for Joe Biden and his pick for vice president over trump any day and every day
No . I was hoping that he would pick Stacy Abrams or  Susan  Rice . I think with Kamila Harris , Joe Biden will still be a Vice President!!
Where are you getting your information? The Obama-Biden administration was one of the most respected presidential administrations in many years.
This is Biden's tempo to be honest. Not bad.
I don’t have that emoji but I am voting for Biden/Harris
Fuck joe biden. Fuck kamala harris. Don’t act like you’ve got any moral high ground voting for these sacks of shit
Sounds to me like an excuse to avoid having to acknowledge that there wasn't actually a joke (or that the joke was about Biden dying).   It's pretty common for someone to say something horrible and then claim it was "just a joke" after. It's a trope at this point.
What's the joke exactly? I would love to know what the funny part is supposed to be? Is it just "Ha ha, Biden's gonna die"?
Kamala will make us proud of America alongside Joe Biden
I'll vote for her and Biden, but please excuse me if I'm not super enthused
With friends like these...
I think she's pretty skilled at plunging the knife without seeming mad about it. Ask Biden, hah.
I'm partial to how the socialist indoctrination camps masquerading as institutions of higher learning are going to help Biden steal the election.
Is Biden great? No. Is Kamala great? No. Is Trump great? Definitely no. The problem is Trump has PROVEN his incompetence over the last four years. We can do better. Let’s try SOMETHING different, yeah?
I heard Joe Biden was *actually* born in Kenya....
I look forward to voting by mail for Biden/Harris.  Every part of that sentence is upsetting to Trump and that makes it good. But also they will be so much better for our country than the steaming pile of rancid old mayonnaise we’ve barely managed to endure since 2016.
Kamala Harris Will Make Sure Racial Justice Is a Key Part of Joe Biden’s Climate Agenda  via
wow! So let me get this right. Biden wants to take away guns destroy 2nd Amendment, no religion, no anything, hurt the bible, hurt God, against energy plus Kamala is against military, fracking, and healthcare - then what is left?  No more rainbows, no windows in your buildings?
So calling you out for basically stating Biden will die (but you aren't saying you want it to happen, sure, sure) is pearl-clutching?  Get over yourself, Ashley.   No one is gullible enough to believe you aren't insinuating what you blatantly are. "Mortal placeholder", indeed.
Like voting and getting EVERY MF to vote Biden/Harris!
And smile without looking deranged! I love both Biden &amp; Harris’ sense of humor. Trump is so boring and stale.
You're not going to go all Joe Biden and blow in hubby's ear and rub his leg are ya?
I am voting for the Biden/Harris ticket in November.   Let's end this nightmare.
There is no way you can support Joe Biden. Why don't you just open up the town and let us get back to normal?  Mask off lady
Biden and Harris bonded over their experiences being ambushed by animal rights activists, sources say.   "These guys are doing exactly what Trump does, so don't pay attention to them" Biden was quoted saying.   "I love cheeseburgers" Harris quipped.
Biden is as stupid as Trump. Have y’all seen any of his campaigns? He doesn’t seem be all the way there.
I'm apparently in an argument with some of them right now after a person I thought I knew better made several tweets about how Kamala will be VP in four months, insinuating Biden will die.
I'm not nervous about Harris joining Biden. Allan Lichtman's prediction about Biden winning in 2020 makes very nervous.  He hasn't guessed wrong since 1984. Words of comfort,  please Momna! My stomach is already in knots.
can you comment on Allan Lichtman's presidendial predictions being correct since 1984 &amp; he is predicting Biden to win 2020? I need to be reassured that Trump will win!  Biden just can't.  :(
Trump would just cry like a baby and whine. Biden should not even think about debating him. It would be a waste of his valuable time.
I think more people may be excited about Joe Biden’s VP pick of Kamala Harris than they are about Joe Biden. I think I fall into that camp. Actually, I know I do.
My heart feels refilled with hope that American freedoms under the Constitution will be honored once again by Biden and Harris. Trump tried his hardest to ignore the Constitution and steal rights, taxpayer funds, and create divisions of hate. Good riddance to bad rubbish, DT...
Some people I know say that biden is worse than trump but if trump wins then civil war is inevitable. Hard to disagree. They're both horrible.
Let's get it straight. Biden isn't thinking anything it's the Puppet Masters in the Democratic Party who know this is their only chance. Female and black.
Joe Biden selected Kamala Harris as his Vice President. Just 4 months after she said she “believed” the woman who said they received unwanted touching from Joe Biden...
I see that you are now ok with a guy that sexually assaulted a staff member running for President and now you are excited about a woman who slept her way up and by the way, call Biden a racist and who supported Tara Reade.
I definitely wish that he wouldn't talk so dismissive of the virus though. I hope I can vote for Biden/Harris.
Biden would likely appoint a merrick garland type so the courts would be less likely to overturn important precedents than with another Trump nominee from fedralist society
Yes I’m voting for Biden but in reality I’m voting for Kamala Harris through Joe
Bold of you to assume Biden will win any term at all, especially now with a cop on the ticket.
Who threatened you into saying such nice things about Biden?
Based on...what exactly? Unlike Trump, who has a known unhealthy diet, aversion to exercise, and lies about his weight, Biden is rather healthy for his age, frequently goes jogging and the like, and hasn't had any general health problems to write home about.
Is Biden not complicit and involved in all of that? Lol
Not sure what more specific criticism is needed of someone that wants Biden to die in office.
Biden and Harris weren't my first choice, but at least I can respect them and trust our government in their hands. Something I have never been able to do with
Song for Biden ... "Do you suffer from short term loss? I don't remember" ... Chumbawumba ... lol
I’m not a religious person, but I’m disappointed a person in your position would tweet such a remark. Biden is a devout and proud Catholic. He may not be a perfect Catholic or Christian, but neither are you or anyone in this world.
My take as well. Pre-covid, we were looking at a Biden/Klobuchar ticket. We upgraded, a little.
It can only get better, if Biden/Harris win that is.
I don't mean to slag on Kamala (though her efforts to sustain mass incarceration remain very unsettling). She is a fine choice. I just wish...Democrats would quit dithering and show some courage. There were at least three other candidates (Kamala included) better than Biden.

When you also add Biden's age + pandemic to the picture, which makes the chance of Harris stumbling into the presidency much higher, her anti-Catholicism and awful record on life becomes even more alarming.
Idk, as a trans woman,  I just really want Trump gone, I haven't slept well the last 4 years.  Biden  and Harris were not my choices, but I will gladly vote for them over Trump/Pence honestly.  If those are the choices,  it's easy, Bernie knows it too.
Realistically,  even if someone has completely different policy preferences than what Joe Biden offers, the fact that getting progressive change done will be easier under Biden than Trump, is a no brainer.
The rich need to start paying an with Biden you WILL
"a lot of progressives HAVEN'T gotten over biden's past record"  as a pretty radical progressive, i think it would be a waste of time for biden to try to chase progressives at this point. who do you think he could have picked that would've convinced progressive holdouts?
Biden/harris 2020: dems couldn’t give less of a fuck
“a potential successor who could become the nation’s first female president”
How?  Biden is obviously suffering from dementia.  It's crystal clear if you compare him to prior campaigns.  I'm quite certain that I could beat him on a debate stage.  Trump went toe-to-toe with Hillary, who had her wits about her.  Biden will be a complete push-over.
Actually...now that I think about it.  Was Simpsons right again?  Technically assuming Biden leaves soon (I could see within 6 months or at least after COVID,) wouldn't that still make it correct or were we assuming that Elizabeth was Lisa?   Just curious.
AND does she still "believe" Joe Biden's accusers like Tara Reade?  She said she did previously.
Hahahahaha So predictable. You need to yell and scream about the Democrats, how Biden and Harris will destroy America, the mail -in vote is corrupt, again. We all know you’re full of 💩. At least I have popcorn. I knew you’d do this today.  😂
I’m still voting Biden lol
Just curious  why I got a push notification about the BIG10 postponing fall sports but not Harris being selected as Biden's #VEEP?
I’m still voting for Biden, but picking Kamala Harris, a know nothing on foreign affairs in an era where the US needs to rebuild trust with other nations at a crucial axis following Trump, is uninspiring to say the least.
all things i already know, disagree with, and will have 0 impact on my voting for biden/harris over trump/pence. as SF DA she also refused to seek the death penalty against a cop killer when feinstein publicly pushed for it, pushed back against 3 strikes. it's just not that meaty
biden and harris looking at us poors like
Having a strong VP candidate helps Biden. He did well, I think. #BidenHarris2020
Like it matters VP debates never matter.  Mark my words: Biden will not debate due to his obvious dementia.
&amp; Now we have Biden who really picked Kamala Harris ... WE DO NOT WANT HER. Omg pls 2020 do better
One has to wonder if the Democrats aren't trying to lose.  Biden is clearly suffering some level of dementia, and Harris isn't going to pull any votes.
warren used to be a corporate lawyer. i am pretty progressive but in the research i did on harris during the primaries there wasn't anything really meaty in her history to really turn off progressives. if you were ready to turn your nose up and vote biden this didn't change that
One has to wonder if the Democrats are actually TRYING to lose.  Biden is clearly suffering some level of dementia, and Kamala the Ugandan Giant isn't going to pull in any votes.
Biden picked Harris as VP 😃
One has to wonder if the Democrats are actually TRYING to lose.  Biden is clearly suffering some level of dementia, and Kamala the Ugandan Giant isn't going to pull in ant votes.
So, on the 11th day of August, Biden climbed out of his basement, saw his shadow, and gave of four more years of tЯump.
Hooray for America! Hooray for Joe Biden. Hooray for Kamala Harris! Hooray for women! Hooray for Asians and blacks . Hooray for America. There is Hope!
This is the first election of my lifetime (Trump is the 10th President since I was born) in which the Democratic VP nominee matters.  Biden is quite obviously suffering from some level of dementia, so at some point he'll become incapable of carrying out his duties.
Congrats to Maya for being chosen as Biden's SNL running mate.
Biden/Squirrels 2020!
So the options are Trump or Biden and a cop..
It’s a fantastic selection. She is a formidable leader, candidate, and person.  Well done by Biden and his staff. They hit it out of the park!
Joe Biden has decided on his running mate: Sen. Kamala Harris.
Harris, a 55-year-old first-term senator, will be the first Black woman to compete on a major party's presidential ticket.
Again, don't care about politics all that much.   Biden at the debates is going to be more important than this announcment
Great pick.  Biden made herstory today.  On to victory!
Seeing the news about biden.  Still waiting to see him just fall flat once Trump pulls out all the stuff before the first debate.

"No president -- whether named Obama or Trump or Biden or AOC -- has unilateral power to rewrite immigration law or to cut taxes or to raise taxes," Sen. Ben Sasse tells President Trump on Twitter.
I find everything about Joe Biden &amp; his corporate-funded trainwreck of a campaign despicable. However, people's need for healthcare is more important than my own principles. If  &amp;  get fully on board with M4A, they have my vote. That's where I #DrawTheLine
It's so sad that this is undeniably the case. We cannot enable this blatant cronyism and abuse of the working class by voting for Biden UNLESS his campaign and  make #M4AllNow a top policy priority.
Guessing that Biden will pick Harris!
No, I can't stand Bernie. I think he's soft and would've eventually bowed and had a plan similar to Biden as president. I preferred Warren out of the people who ran, but my platform and beliefs have not been represented by a presidential candidate.
If y'all are Biden's running mate I am OUT.
First off, I'm white.  Second off, democrats are trash too. Joe Biden isn't going to do anything that is gong to actually bring about positive change systemically. Dems like Hillary, Biden, Obama are still right of center with their economic policies. That is not the way forward.

Warning  If Joe Biden wins. He's going to spend the next 4 years digging America out of a very deep hole.  Trump broke a lot of our government, more than we are currently aware of, to be sure.

How does increased spending mean increased taxes? Trump spent $800 billion on the military and CUT taxes for the wealthy.  Low inflation means Biden SHOULD be spending lots of money. Boost the economy and provide for the working class.

It's always good to hear these stories on Twitter of Trump voters that come to their senses and avoid #Cult45. I suspect a lot of folks are trumpists bc of peer pressure. Hopefully, when they're alone in the voting booth they'll do the right thing: reject Trump and vote Biden.

ANOTHER RACIST!
Biden’s campaign is running off “I’m not trump” and “I have a black woman VP” I’m not saying these are his policies. I know what he says his policies are. I also know he’s a horrible person. Don’t vote trump, but know who you’re voting for when you vote Biden.
Bruh the world would be so much better if they just let twitter run it. Step down Biden and Trump we don’t need u anymore, but we’ll keep Queen Elizabeth and Michell Obama around cause they keep the world spinning ☺️
I’m ready, say when!
Is  or  going to do anything about the “wrong trump” hashtag? Of course not, they probably encourage that type of vile behavior.  It would be just as vile if the hashtag were “wrong Biden”.
Biden is pathetic  it’s unbelievable he is running  He has no f’ing clue as to where he is or what he is doing!  His grades were c’s and D’s in college , and accomplished nothing in 47 yrs in politics

Healthcare plans would have a replacement, if they went away, which they won't. Biden is on the record as anti-M4A.  Not all in NE can easily unionize bc of GOP anti-union policies. If u want jobs to provide healthcare then support bills that get all employers to do so.
I see the blaming of Bernie for Biden's incomprehensible loss has already begun.   Next up, we discuss the omnipresent evil of Russia and how the voters who saw no reason to support our platform are stupid, ungrateful, and racist
I am a rare republican who works at the USPS.  I was outraged that our union would would support a corrupt Hillary Clinton let alone a corrupt ass Joe Biden ticket!
You realize the Biden/Harris ticket isn't democracy. Voters didn't nominate them, Bloomberg's billions bought it. Stop preaching about democracy when you deal in authoritarian fascism. Have fun with 4 more years of Trump, you guys clearly want it
Biden hasn't been in office for the last four years while the country has fallen apart... Trump has.  He is responsible.   Trump is a self-serving, wanna-be dictator who couldn't manage his way out of a paper bag.
I knew it. Biden will make sure the Republican party puts a full blown fascist on the ticket next election, and that person will win against these chuds.
“This guy has been taking your dignity away and your respect,”” Trump said of former Vice President Joe Biden. “And I’m telling you on Nov. 3 you’re going to be getting it back.”
Surely you jest. Dems don't want Biden to say anything for fear he will make an add of himself again, and maybe forget where he's at. He's an accident waiting to happen. And you know it.

I have yet to see you call out Democrat’s transgressions against them country. Everyone knew what they were getting with Trump. I’ve not seen a probe into don JR like I have hunter Biden. If Biden was so great why didn’t he tell Obama how to do it better. He’s a 30+ yr politician
Haven't seen much of the former vice president and 30 year senator? Didn't see him in a dozen debates this year? There are few politicians the people have seen more than Biden over the last decades.
Cool. Go look at them then. Biden's taxes are widely available. Trump's aren't, certainly hiding his conflicts of interest, grifting, and probably years of financial impropriety, if not crime.
Would be cool if she told her impressionable progressive zombies to shape up and vote for biden/harris too
I’m Republican,will vote for President Trump BY MAIL,very high risk.I read through replies,noticed 1 thing-no mention of Dems actions in problems we have.We must ask ourselves,”What have we done to help.”Easy for Biden to be armchair quarterback,he just has to talk,not govern.

Biden's campaign is actually worse because his only argument is "I'm not Trump" and that's not even true. Trump and Biden are both racist Republican sexual predators, there's no difference between the two.
Joe's exactly like you, what do you expect? Both Hillary and Biden are deeply unpopular among their own voters, so that's not really different
Have to also credit the Biden people for obfuscating the search just enough to make Harris seem like a surprise pick as well.
There's no path to victory for Biden. Even without GOP shenanigans, he'd still lose. Hell, Biden couldn't win the nomination without DNC shenanigans. The progressive votes Biden needs to win are gone to Howie Hawkins (I know, I'm one of many)

hey Donald Trump you make the statement on national news that Joe Biden don't have a clue as what you said you as well don't have a clue of what's going on in the world you are the biggest liar and the biggest idiot that we've ever had for a president
And voting for Biden because you don’t want Trump to ease the overt white supremacy (I’m saying overt because the democrats and especially Biden are not off the hook) is a good and sound choice, and you can do either and not be a bad person.
I hate that the only opinions I see are either, if you don’t vote for Biden to get rid of trump, you’re evil, or vice versa. There is nothing wrong with treating the vote as a choice for something you want, not what you want less. It doesn’t make you bad.

Joe Biden says no one should go outside without a mask for the next three months.  If you water your lawn you better have a mask.  Wow.  What a cutting edge idea.  I’m gonna vote for Joe.  He is sooooo smart.
At 19 weeks, 6 days, 23 hours and 59 minutes, it’s not a human being but at 20 weeks it is? Regardless of that illogical train of thought, dismemberment abortion rips apart a child limb by limb. You are okay with that? Joe Biden’s Democrat Party I guess!
And please explain me what ”science” is mandating mask wearing outside! 🤣🤣 Must be the Democrat 5600 genders science. BTW .. Did Joe Biden stop being a racist and a grabber to Kamala as soon as she got picked for VP? Miracle!
Joe Biden’s Democrat Party — they think ripping a human being apart limb by limb is a human right.

So Obama-Biden had a Catholic on it but Biden-Harris doesn’t? Hmm, not sure how that’s possible.
agree completely. we are herewith pedo Biden and scam Harris, Dolan trump by design. Purely by design. trash on both sides
It also has a 69% chance of Trump winning Iowa.   All in all, the model gives Biden a 71% chance of winning the election.
Trump campaign tweeted mugshots of released Black inmates in a callous attempt to smear the Biden campaign, which some said channeled the racist Bush campaign 'Willie Horton' ad  #SmartNews
According to  Joe Biden has a 54% chance to win Nebraska's 2nd district.   It shows Pres Trump has a 98% chance of winning the state and a 94% chance to win NE-1.
B.S.  Biden is not there mentally - the debates will (would) expose it.
Check out that WaPo article dude. Very positive!  ‘I believe it’s normal for the president to say “Yo Semites” and “Yo Seminites,” “Thigh Land,” “Minne-a-napolis,” “toe-tally-taria-tism,” “Thomas Jeffers” and “Ulyss-eus S. Grant.” I believe it’s Biden who’s cognitively impaired.‘
Video shows Joe Biden asking Kamala Harris to be vice presidential running mate
I feel the argument but her and Biden are running against DONALD TRUMP...
Just ordered my Biden-Harris t-shirt.
My theory is they made Biden the candidate because the others (Mayor Pete, Crazy Bernie, Klobuchar) wouldn't have gone along so willingly.
Yeah, Trump needs a foil desperately, and Biden isn’t providing it. His biggest asset in 2016 was the righteous cause of keeping Hillary Clinton out of the White House. I stayed neutral back then because I couldn’t bear the thought of helping her, and I don’t think I was alone.
When do they get rid of Biden, before or after the election?
IMO at this point there are only two things that can save Trump:  1. Disastrous debate performances by Biden. Like, Trump gives him an impromptu dementia test and he can’t remember what day it is.   2. Mail in ballots are rejected at vastly higher rates than in person ballots.
My thoughts exactly! Dems need  ticket worth cheating for &amp; Biden-Harris isn't it.
Never said it did. But it’s BS with Biden- that video doesn’t mean shit. Propaganda that’s all.
You mean the Democrats. Biden has dementia and now his vp believed his accusers and basically called him a racist just 5 months back. Communism didn’t let anyone speak out against anything with the government (see China, N. Korea) and if they did would be imprisoned. #Facts
It looked like pure instinct on Karine’s part. These are two strong, dedicated  and courageous women who will serve Joe Biden well. I am so excited about this ticket.
Team Biden/Harris response to criticism...
Biden is so far out of touch with reality, he doesn’t know anything about what is going on.
All of the things listed make her the ideal match for Biden. Biden is so far over the hill and out of touch, he is not aware of anything.
Just for that I will personally remind you everyday that Biden chose Kamala Harris until November 4th with this picture...how about that?
How can you support Joe Biden and BLM? Like what? 🤦🏻‍♂️😂
Pastor Janet Goodman Banks of Christ Place Church in Lincoln, who is Black, said she was “ecstatic” and “elated” at Tuesday’s announcement by Biden.
Biden is Catholic like Warren is a Native American.
Biden is Catholic but a hypocrite
Biden Harris ticket...hell yeah!!!💯🔥
Donald Trump says on TV Carmela Harris was very disrespectful to Joe Biden Donald Trump's got to say these things to make himself look better which city is the biggest liar safe disrespectful person and so racial he is a pathetic human being
You can be critical of our democratic ballot and still plan to vote for them. I will 100% be voting Biden/Harris 2020 but I will not stop speaking out about the issues involving them.
I first would like to preface this teeet with letting y’all know I understand why people don’t like Biden and Harris. I truly do.   That being said, if you are someone who would rather not vote than to vote for them can you please explain why?
This says it all about K Harris!  Watch Tulsi Gabbard tell it like it is. Like Joe Biden you can't run from your record.!
Better than being a Trump humper, Biden/Harris 2020!!!!
In your dreams bunker bitch. Biden/Harris 2020!!!!
President Trump announces Joe Biden's VP pick, Kamala Harris. You read it here first people
Interesting  she is not wesring mask with Biden  who was  just unrapped out of a coffin in his basement
Abbreviated Pundit Roundup: The stability of the Biden lead, the chaos of the White House
I don’t care what you claim to be, but you still haven’t answered the original question.  Why would Biden, a lifelong Reagan Democrat, listen to leftists once he already has your vote? Where is the evidence to suggest he (or any Dem) would move left instead right?
Clyburn: Joe Biden does not take the Black community for granted
Clyburn: Joe Biden does not take the Black community for granted
What a duo Biden and Harris. a very scary thought if they ever get voted into office we need to all pull together and make sure that does not happen. Trump / Pence and American values and pride for 2020‼️
The same poo flinging that Harris did to Biden.  Pence will likely point that out.
Trump World’s inability to hone in on a consistent line of attack against Harris was particularly surprising, given that she was long viewed as one of Biden’s most likely picks for his ticket. Get your shit together PRES🤷🏼‍♀️
That attack alone — that Harris was “nasty” because she was disrespectful of Biden — is odd coming from someone who regularly attacks Biden and many other people he disagrees with first by calling them insulting nicknames. THE POT CALLING THE KETTLE BLACK 😂😂😂
Trump tells Americans they'll have to 'learn to speak Chinese' if he loses to Biden in 2020
Hey Hannity staff: you folks stoked about Biden/Harris? The country is.
I'm waiting for you to congratulate Biden/Harris. 👀
I'm quaking right now because I'm thinking pence may not beat Harris, but Trump will beat Biden.
I can’t wait until these twits and their negativity are gone from our government. Biden was making one of the most significant announcements in US history. Of course it’s going to be scripted.
He has to vote Biden or we'll say he ain't black
Man I cant wait until this stupid noise machine is over with in a few months, and I dont even like Joe Biden
Is Biden/Harris worse than Clinton/Kaine? It feels worse.
Saw a NEBRASKANS FOR BIDEN sign in someone’s front yard and it was clearly made a like Kinkos. Pretty sure that’s a metaphor for Biden’s ground game.
In choosing Kamala Harris, Biden may have found the anti-Trump  #SmartNews
They know Biden has no chance" its isn't about who is running it is all about The left Removing Biden if he actaully became president...vp will be told to step down...and take a guess who becomes President...thats right...this is how absurd the Democratic party is..look at covid!
"She Never Called Biden Racist" Watch Fox News Fact Check Trump Statement on Kamala Harris  #SmartNews
With all due respect Dr. Kendi. How exactly is this ticket specifically good for the marginalized communities they terrorized while in power?  See Biden’s crime bill. See Harris’s record as Cali AG.  Asking for my BIPOC students. Thanks!
Warren was better, no, she was the best choice!.. But she was screwed over yet again, because Biden caved. At least be honest. #WarrenDemocrat 💚
Joe Biden Picks Senator Kamala Harris as Vice Presidential Running Mate
I Wish Biden campaign implodes ☺️
How Biden selected Kamala Harris as his running mate
Ah yes. love this one Biden does a racism What about CP5? Biden does another racism  What about CP5? Biden does 25 more racisms what about CP5?
You realize if Biden wins, Harris like every VP in history will be given nothing to do of consequence?  But yeah, Presidents dont always finish terms for various reasons.
Joe Biden chooses Kamala Harris? The most conservative woman running? I’m shocked 🙄
He spun more circles that Donald Trump and stumbled over more words than Joe Biden. It was almost embarrassing
Trump Suggests 'Men Are Insulted' by Biden Committing to Pick Female as His VP
So is biden not racist like you said?
Can’t wait!   Biden Harris for the win!
Don’t live in fear! And don’t vote Biden! He will take away your freedoms! He wants control! He is too far right!! Please do your homework.
This is a win for all of us. We have a pair that can truly take on the task of restoring the soul of America. Congratulations Senator Harris and Vice President Biden.
Nope!! His daughter!! Geez people!! He’s not a Biden! AKA- sniffy-joe!!
yeah the biden/harris ticket is MUCH better than trump/pence but deep down i am crying because i wish it were sanders/warren
Do your homework, she’s awful! You will have no freedoms if Biden gets in. They want to control you. Just please look up things! I wasn’t a trump lover till I did my homework! You’ll be glad you did!
Joe Biden keeps this simple comic strip on his desk — here's what it says  #SmartNews
I am not saying trump is the good guy. what I am pointing out is Trump is the NEW guy. Kamala and biden have been in the system for decades. they had plenty of chances to clean up, but instead benefited from and exacerbated the problem. Trump has been in for 4 years.
So Kamala Harris just forgave Biden for sexual harassment that she said he did 6 months ago. #bideniscrazy #sniffherhair
Joe Biden wears Depends
Fox News Host Neil Cavuto Corrects Trump Campaign: Kamala Harris Never Called Biden ‘Racist’  #SmartNews
Biden/Harris is the Democrats' McCain/Palin.   #BidenHarris2020
Biden made history by selecting the first Black woman to compete on a major party’s presidential ticket. The choice also acknowledges the vital role Black voters will play in his bid to defeat President Trump.
Hey  why do you fact check anything. Biden/Harris are running for the White House. The Dems lie to us every time they run, and we are used to it. So don’t waist your time. And if you wanna gamble with your 230 protections,keep messing with Republicans, Trump will end you!
If I had a dog, she would be voting for Biden/Harris!
There have been protests about police brutality for MONTHS, and Biden chose a fucking cop.  Your argument is blown to bits.
Senator Kamala Harris is Biden's VP pick!    This  is thrilled to see a Black woman (and former CJS professional) on the democratic presidential ticket. A Madam VP on the 100th anniversary of the women's vote: FABULOUS! Madam President 2024?!
Kamala Harris was by far the best choice for Vice President Joe Biden could make. He gets  A + for judgement on his first big decision of the campaign.
Biden picked Horse Face. 😂
I’m a little confused why Rose Twitter is mad about Harris (one of the most progressive members of the Senate) being named Biden’s running mate. Who did you want? The Scientology Congresswoman? An ACTUAL cop? A moderate governor? The woman you refer to only with snake emojis?
us: abolish the police  biden: vice president police?
This shack will be president “if and when” Biden steps down. Do you see what’s happening people? #BidenVP #HarrisBiden2020 #2ndAmendment #BidenHarris #Barr
I am happy that Kamala Harris was chosen as VP. This is a new day, it is over for the likes of trump!Congratulations to you Symone and Karine Jean-Pierre ,two bad ass women who have served Biden well!!
If Biden/Harris win, maybe when can get a non Goldman Sachs Treasury Secretary.
Laughable headline.  She didn’t cut it the first time when she ran for President.  She sure as hell isnt going to entice people the second time.  Kamala isn’t likeable and that’s the truth.  Biden campaign errored with this pick.
I’m looking forward to the debates. This isn’t going to be as bad as Clinton/Kaine.   If the moderators are sort their salt they’ll bring up criminal justice. Trump &amp; Pence haven’t a leg to stand. Biden &amp; Harris will have to explain their record and hopefully see religion on…
Kinda hard to want to vote for Biden when he chooses a TERF for a running mate, calls for the prosecution of activists, opposes universal healthcare, and literally tells people not to vote for him.
Trump surprised Biden picked Kamala Harris as running mate
Can’t believe I had to log onto twitter after work and find out Biden picked Kamala Harris as his running mate.....
Kamala Harris, Biden's V.P. Pick, Is First Woman of Color on Major Party Ticket
I’d like to wish a sincere good luck to Kamala Harris as she will undoubtedly carry Biden’s entire campaign from here until Election Day.   Prediction: more than one Vice Presidential debate
Trump’s weak framing of her as a phony kind of illustrates the truth of this.   Trump desperately needs a foil to saddle this unrest with. Were Bernie or even Warren the nominee, he’d be tearing them apart over it. But Biden has refused to take the bait, including here.
He sounded like Joe Biden when he's not reading a script several words some of which made sense but nothing to do with what was asked
I’m happy to see Kamala added to the ticket. No I don’t agree with her on everything. But Trump needs to go and every time Biden opens his mouth I cringe. I have way more faith in black women, whether I agree with everything they stand for or not. #BidenHarris
Don’t tell  but I think the hubs (former military, rancher from South Dakota) is warming to the idea of  It’s one vote, but it shows that people recognize the decency of #BidenHarris2020. So, with my dad, stepmom, and hubby, Trump’s lost 3 R’s in Nebraska.
Biden/Kamala is a more traditionally republican ticket than what the GOP is running lmao
And good for Biden to pick someone who will have open honest conversations with him. Not a bunch of .... well no words to describe the group of spineless GOP supporting this Tyrunt Trump.
Biden died last year its all good
So you're admitting Biden will be President in name only.
I can’t wait to watch! Harris &amp; Biden= Trump win.
Biden couldn't have picked a worse running mate.
Biden/Harris 2020 That’s The Ticket. #AnybodyButTrump
I was so hoping Biden would pick a woman with a law degree to help clean up the legal nightmare Trump's going to leave behind.
Lmao I was literally thinking this earlier. To be honest though they probably aren’t voting for Biden either.
I remember the history books the unaltered ome atleast painting  biden as not a fighter for all people but just white people and your not loved by anyone bit the anyone bit trump party so i doubt itll jnify
Biden’s a better Catholic than you will ever be.
It actually seems your the snowflake as you attacked first...his comment was right it wasnt biden who chose but the party
If you are voting for President Biden &amp; Vice President Harris, respond with 🗳️
Apparently Kamala is doing a 180 on Biden’s rape accusers......
Harris doesn’t help him in battle ground states and she is absolitely polarizing in a time when we really need unity.  She has a very shady background and her own state has become a dumpster fire.  She will get eaten alive.  Biden handed Trump 4 more years on a platter today.
Did you hear Biden picked his running mate?  Kamala. Just like the olive. Isn’t that the name of an olive?  Kamala olive.
It’s obvious that if Biden wins, it’s going to be Weekend at Bernie’s with Harris and the Clintons calling the shots. A Biden/Harris ticket won’t motivate people to vote.   Clinton barely lost in 16 because of low Democrat turnout. This ticket is even worse IMO.
1.)Tulsi Gabbard - hands down. But she won’t be a DNC soldier, so party kicked her to curb.   Not worried about Biden’s age, it’s his Alzheimer’s. Everyone knows he needs to be in nursing home, not Whote House. If you can’t leave your home to accept the nomination, you can’t win.
Well, at least I’ll have something to be excited about voting for Biden. Congratulations  #KamalaHarrisForVP #KamalaHarris #KamalaHarrisVP #KamalaHarris2020
#BidenHarris2020 hilarious, Biden nominatrd one of the most unpopular, callous, Marxists in the country, so of course Biden picked a radical leftist as his VP &amp; likely Pres because we know Creepy Joe wont last one term before resigning. Trump's chances just improved dramatically!
I understand if you’re upset about the Kamala pick. Although I don’t understand the surprised reactions.  I’ve seen too many, “You mean to tell me Joe Biden didn’t appease leftists in his VP pick?  I was certain he would do that for the first time in his whole political career.”
She is "of color" but not of African descent but she can't undo Biden's history.
What a ignorant comment, he looked at the situation and determined it was just not worth a comment, thing is Biden or Obama would not have had protection, secret service hated them!
Dafuq? This dude got BLM in his name but support Biden/Harris. Biden wrote the Crime Bill and Harris selectively enforced it against BIPOC.
Biden loves all women regardless of age
Its not tonsay we shouldn't fight the ideal fight, but rather, we have to understand where the actual battle lies. We lost the battle for Bernie, who is not blameless, but thats done and over forever. We now have 2 choices and only 2 choices. Choose Biden.
😂😂😂 We shall see.  My vote is on the prosecutor.  The same one that made Bill Barr cry.  The Elf on the Shelf may get dumped by Trump prior to the debates anyway.
But but but she's not black. She's indian/Jamaican and I don't think either thinks their black. Someone should have told Biden. When she ran for Senator she portrayed herself as Indian.
Sorry. You may want to address your obvious cognitive dissonance, Biden isn’t a progressive and if you claim to be but support him, you’re not a progressive either.  Free yourself from the shackles of your lies.
😂😂😂  Biden may win CA but she's hated in the state.
I thought Biden was racist? Did you ever get your apology?
TBH, I think the puppetmasters are holding Pelosi, Biden, and their families hostage
In Teleprompter Gaffe, Biden Says His Vice Presidential Pick Is 'Insert Woman Of Color Here'  via
Let it not be lost that the entire list of non-white and/or non-male VP candidates in all of American history was exactly two names long before today.  Regardless of what you think about Biden or Harris, this is a good thing.
“Progressives for Biden”
Anyone else wonder how long it will be before Twatter &amp; FB decide to close ranks with the lamestream media and shut down the truth on Biden &amp; Kamala?
that's it I'm done. Only acceptable choice was for Biden to say he was VP and Bernie would be leading the ticket
Good choice smart woman Thank You  Joe Biden!
Top stories right now 1.)Biden/Harris 1.1) Urban Meyer’s naked dude meltdown.
like Eastman want to raise your taxes. Look what happend to the #DJI after Sleepy Joe Biden picked Harris for his running mate. It tanked. Just an example what will happen if these Liberals get into office.  #Squad
I wouldn’t make fun of Biden‘s cognitive abilities when Trump can’t even say the word Yosemite
Probably. But given what she was willing to do with Willie Brown to become S.F. D.A., CA AG and U.S. Senator I'm sure she'll swallow her objections to Biden.
Biden has made his VP pick
lying to the extreme on   on  Biden "mental capability". I mean..."C'mon man"!! It's VISIBLE to all America whenever he goes on TV and it WILL BE visible after the first debate. DemoRats will put a zombie as a candidate if they could...
IT’S ABOUT DAMN TIME    Joe Biden selects Senator Kamala Harris to be his vice presidential running mate
Now  can blast videos about #TraitorTrump #TraitorMcConnell #TraitorPompeo #TraitorDevos       - All are going down!   Trump campaign blasts 'phony' Harris after Biden names her VP
What does that have to do with Kamala Harris calling Biden and racist and her record of putting black men in jail? Thought you Democrat’s would hate that I guess not though.
Well Trump still didn’t get impeached so they wasted so much time trying to do that. But hey, November will say it all. I know enough to know Biden is NOT the person for this country
DON’T SAY A DAMN THING- YOU’RE DEFINITELY JUDGING HER MORE HARSHLY BECAUSE SHE IS A WOMAN AND ALSO WE ARE IN A FIGHT FOR OUR LITERAL FUCKING LIVES RIGHT NOW SO SIT DOWN, SHUT UP, AND VOTE BIDEN/HARRIS THANK YOU.
can I get a Biden Harris bumper sticker or yard sign?

You forget...only trumpee holds grudges. Biden doesnt have thin skin.
It's Kamala Harris: Joe Biden announces vice presidential pick
It's time to unite and take home the bacon and kick a little bit of ass love this pic Biden Harris that's all you have to say
What will make Trump’s legacy infinitely worse is if we refuse to apply fair scrutiny to politicians’ records, particularly Dems, because we fear pointing out their shortcomings.  Trump’s impact, in that case, is that he continually lowers the bar for ALL politicians (see Biden).
Did Biden do anything to actually help her win this primary? Or did he support her AIPAC challenger?
Joe Biden I honestly believe that you pick the right partner for your running mate Kamala Harris is a very smart very well spoken and a terrific woman you've got my vote from Omaha Nebraska
I told y'all who Biden was choosing as his running mate.
I am surprised Hide'n Biden didn't pick Where's Hunter. In hopes of saving them from the wrath of AG Barr. They are both are under investigation in Ukraine for Corruption. Fact checkers cant say this is bogus, its FACTS! There are no longer Democrats now their is "Corrupt Party"
I'm thrilled Joe Biden has made history by choosing Kamala Harris as his running mate. Senator Harris is a talented, pragmatic leader with a strong record of holding elected officials accountable, fighting corruption, and advocating for the most vulnerable Americans. Let's go!
Joe Biden so desperately wants to loose this election I swear to god
If Biden is elected, Don will vote against every Democrat policy, the same way that he's voted against every bill they've brought up this session, and he'll have the same bad reason to vote against it, even if he "agrees with the idea".
No football and Biden picked his VP...trumpee must be having a day 😂
Remember when Brian Stelter celebrated Biden riding a bike?  Good times!
Biden/Harris vs trump/pence we have our matchup
I believe what I believe and you believe what you believe. I don’t see Biden doing a single thing for this country. He’s literally hiding in a bunker. People make Trump out to be the bad guy in every situation. His jobs hard enough and y’all just make it so much harde for him
Democrats needed to get on board with this a long time ago though. They left Biden out on an island and he’s got an uphill battle. Got too greedy.
You need to grow up, you think any of us care about this? Kamala called Biden a racist not to long ago and she locked minorities up for weed charges!
Meltdown over Biden's VP pick at 5:30 P.M. Enjoy!
Damn Biden really picked kamala harris as his VP 🤢
If Biden wins, I hope Harris will use her background as a prosecutor to squash the anti-police sentiment running rampant in her party and the radical followers that are destroying their own communities.
THIS IS NOT AN ENDORSEMENT OF TRUMP:  But, you want to know how whack our country is? Democrats had 4 years to groom someone to beat him &amp; best they can do is a Joe Biden-Kamala Harris ticket?  Jesus Christ. So many brilliant leaders in this world and you go Biden-Harris? 😂🤣😂
Of course, Biden won’t do shit for us no matter what color you are. He will ruin America. Talking about taking guns away when it’s our right. He can’t even talk straight to even be able to address the nation if he had to
Hey Big Mouth Donald Trump why don't you say something about Joe Biden and his running mate now that woman to put you in your place she'll tell you what a loser you are
Remember if you vote democrat this is who you are voting for president:
I think if Biden can tap into the progressive part of the left, he'll win. A lot of progressives voted third party in both last election and even tho Hillary won popular vote it hurt her in blue states and swing states. Biden needs to bring those aggrieved progressives back.
And, god-willing, once Biden/Harris convincingly win the election, we can pressure them to add strong progressive voices to the Cabinet. We can demand progressive ideas.  We're not going to go back to the way things were pre-Trump. We're going to fucking fix everything.
Yay for #Kamala and #Biden. #ChangeIsHappening!
I get why Biden picked Harris but Jesus Christ I wish he hadn’t
She’s definitely not a perfect pick. Neither is Biden.
Remember what Biden you ain’t black if u don’t vote for him
No we don't. Biden used Warren. You must not truly understand the #WarrenDemocrat. The majority of us will vote the ticket, but we're definitely NOT happy about it.
Look, I know Biden wasn't a lot of people's first choice, and I know Kamala comes with a lot of baggage from her time as a DA, but this is it. This is what we have to work with in order to get that stupid motherfucker and his corrupt cronies out of the White House. #vote
Ima still vote Biden doe
Will  stand with  (who endorsed her) in calling out Joe Biden?
I complained about Biden even when I voted for Obama.
She has the least garbage and vetted most. It was the least risky pick for Biden. Biden/Harris ticket has no chance in November. 🇺🇸
1 he did not say he grabs women by the pussy he said when your ricj an famous you can do that...proof look at 50 shades of rap the womans favorite movie...and what about the women who came forward accusing biden of the same shit...is he exempt
I still can’t believe it was joe Biden....
at least the debates (if they happen) will be entertaining. Pence nervously chugging water while waiting for Kamala’s applause breaks every few seconds as she denies needlessly locking people up. Biden trying to figure out where he is while Trump mispronounces words. AMERICA!
That it is! I would have loved a Biden/Harris ticket but that is not going to happen. There will be so much work to be done and Kamala is fierce and up to the task. What a formidable cast of candidates he vetted. All strong wonderfully experienced women.
Excited to vote #BidenHarris2020 but I hope the 2020s versions of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris listen to the people, continue to evolve (quickly) on criminal justice issues, and take serious, lasting action on healthcare and climate change.
Kamala Harris congratulations congratulations I am so happy that Joe Biden chose you for a running mate I think you would have made a great president but that may still happen my name is Richard French I'm from Omaha Nebraska
Well Biden is most definitely not getting my vote. He can barely say a sentence without fucking it up
Biden chooses a cop as his VP... yikes man... way to read the room there
I smell a Burger King versus Biden/Kamala mashup coming.    Personally, that’s the way I’d like to have it.
Joe Biden very smart I think that was is a right decision and Kamala Harris congratulations I think you will make a very good vice president or maybe president one day and graduation
So  really didn’t care about Biden’s bussing stance after all

Very cool..  Biden picks Sen. Kamala Harris as running mate
I trust her less than Biden
If I have a very low IQ and I am dependent upon government entitlements would it be smart for me to vote for Joe Biden?  Someone in my group said he would be an asshat to the country.  I think I heard that right.
Well, she’s practically the democrat presidential nominee.  Biden won’t be able to finish a first term, let alone remember there was an election if he wins.
Wonder if Kamala Harris did some “special favors” for Biden to get picked... lol
I'll vote for Biden regardless, but, man, I don't think it's possible for me to be less excited about it.
I always felt strongly for Kamala Harris but especially when Karine Jean-Pierre begin working for Biden‘s campaign. She physically put herself in front of Kamala when she was attacked on stage, he has some tough black women around him!
Joe Biden choosing a cop to be his running mate in the year of "defund the police" is hella on-brand for 2020.
Short memory
Biden had a chance to unite the party. Could have went with Brother Bernie and did not. Missed opportunity
Two Hypocrites supporting each other. What a Fucking Joke. 😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠        "Joe Biden selects Senator Kamala Harris to be his vice presidential running mate"

Harris, a 55-year-old first-term senator, is also one of the party's most prominent figures and quickly became a top contender for the No. 2 spot after her own White House campaign ended
I was NOT expecting Kamala as Biden's running mate but THIS MAKES ME SOOOO HAPPY!
If Biden wins, then: If (when?) Joe Biden dies in office, Kamala Harris will become the president, right? But is that constitutional? Or will it go straight to Nancy Pelosi?

Biden + Harris time to conquer!!!
In choosing Harris, Biden is embracing a former rival from the Democratic primary who is familiar with the unique rigor of a national campaign.
Its funny if all the people who are excited for this would have actually voted for her she would be the nominee and have a much better chance at beating trump than Biden.

In a time when people are demanding that police departments around the country be defunded, Biden chooses a former cop as his VP.  Lmao
Joe Biden picked a poor time to leak his VP pick. . .
Joe Biden selects Kamala Harris as his running mate.
These Biden VP leaked calls are like that first Thursday of the NCAA tourney where seeds and falling left and right
Bad polling, and he can't talk about Trump or Biden or any specific policy, so this is literally all he has to campaign on.
It's almost a cop out, but yes. Biden now, then once we get this country's collective head out of its *** then we can move on getting a woman where a woman is long overdue.
The announcement is expected very shortly.
I just found out who Biden is picking and will tell the first person to reply to this tweet.
Correct. Trump will tweet that they have found the body of Jimmy Hoffa in Biden’s backyard, along side of D B Cooper.

Sometimes people misspeak. Just ask Joe Biden.
Naturally it’s what I expected you to use for “proof”.- a “subscription based conservative political commentary website” covering the accusations but offering no evidence of what they claim. It’s as credible as Joe Biden is going to take away your windows.
So I think I would rather have Sarah Palin as a VP then Biden as president. Man can barely speak and I was hoping the DNC picked someone else. The Democrats are just as corrupt as the Republicans if not worse at this point
Ole Joe is just Biden his time before he has to answer for his corruption issues.
It should but this is what I'm afraid of. Nobody is pro-Biden but many are anti-Trump thus they'll vote against him by voting for Biden even though they don't like him.
No he is not........Biden has outright said he wants a black woman for VP.....and I am fine with that....but dont choose a VP because of skin color or gender.....choose by the persons ability.....no room for racism
It is funny to me that liberals actually think that sleepy, creepy Biden is going to save them. Nothing will fundamentally change. As Trump is not a conservative, he is is not a liberal. This is the duopoly we live in. #VoteGold2020
I hear you... my circle is the same way, but I live in Nebraska and trust me, I see the craziness... it's everywhere. Thankfully we split electoral votes and hoping Dist 2 comes to its senses and votes Biden, but the gerrymandering that happened after '08 is a lot to overcome.
Trump and his corrupt administration is the true problem.  Biden is honest and trustworthy. I put my faith in him.
Wait, is he campaigning for Biden now....  cuz, that's the point...
I will, but I'm taking crap from people today for defending Biden.

Just a hunch but I'm assuming that every member of Nickelback is going to announce that they're Biden's VP very soon
Hope that everyone understands that who ever Biden's VP pick is, they will end up becoming President, Biden wont last though one term if he wins, so who ever is the VP has to be someone the radical left knows will push their agenda when Dementia Joe resigns.
Biden seizes on Trump's attack on Social Security and Medicare, while team Trump panics
I wonder if they’ll announce another slot for her on Wednesday - when/if she’s chosen - and then this Thursday slot will just be a lead-in to Biden’s big speech? Is that out of the realm of possibility? Maybe I’m just grasping at straws but 😂
I WILL vote Biden no matter who he picks for VP.
But Sleepy Joe is not lying,  By reason of a mental defect or disease, he does not know the difference between the truth and lies.  Six times Biden described major events in his life that never happened
Yes, I am told Biden will speak for 15 seconds so the Democratic Party can ensure he knows where he is.
Don’t worry, Biden will restore order soon enough.
The unusual format, with just eight hours of prime-time programming spread over four nights from Aug. 17-20, will test Biden's ability to project a cohesive message to a splintered electorate.

Which will come first? The announcement of Biden’s VP or The Big Ten decision on fall football?
Kind of dreading tomorrow, where Trump will have to be extra bombastic to steal the news cycle from Biden's VP choice (you know he will try)
She's not ready.  I like her a lot, but Michigan looks relatively safe for Biden right now.  They're going with a black woman, to ensure the black voters show up.  So yeah, I'll take that bet.  Save the nickname - you can give it to the republican trolls in Michigan.

It's normal for the president to say ‘Yo Semites’ and ‘Yo Seminites,’ ‘Thigh Land,’ ‘Minne-a-napolis,’ ‘toe-tally-taria-tism,’ ‘Thomas Jeffers’ and ‘Ulyss-eus S. Grant.’ but it’s Biden who’s cognitively impaired,”  🤔
We'll probably get some college football announcements and a Biden VP pick on the same day and the internet will melt.

They have the same policies!  They are a part of the Democrat platform.  Does Biden oppose unemployment benefits?  Does he oppose police reform?  Does he oppose anything that is in this ad?
You don't find it funny at all that this old white guy is awesome, but the other old white guy isn't?  Guess who will listen to Markey?  Biden will, Trump won't.  Seems like an easy vote.
Biden needs votes to get in.  Trump needs less votes to *stay* in.  You know his base is going to vote, so if all the leftists stay home or write in Bernie, Trump wins.  I understand not being excited about a Biden presidency.  But a Blue cabinet is veerrrrrryy helpful, to us all
She really is helping Trump though if she doesn't vote Biden.  That's just a fact.

Biden’s campaign is running off “I’m not trump” and “I have a black woman VP” I’m not saying these are his policies. I know what he says his policies are. I also know he’s a horrible person. Don’t vote trump, but know who you’re voting for when you vote Biden.

You realize the Biden/Harris ticket isn't democracy. Voters didn't nominate them, Bloomberg's billions bought it. Stop preaching about democracy when you deal in authoritarian fascism. Have fun with 4 more years of Trump, you guys clearly want it
Biden hasn't been in office for the last four years while the country has fallen apart... Trump has.  He is responsible.   Trump is a self-serving, wanna-be dictator who couldn't manage his way out of a paper bag.

“This guy has been taking your dignity away and your respect,”” Trump said of former Vice President Joe Biden. “And I’m telling you on Nov. 3 you’re going to be getting it back.”

And voting for Biden because you don’t want Trump to ease the overt white supremacy (I’m saying overt because the democrats and especially Biden are not off the hook) is a good and sound choice, and you can do either and not be a bad person.
I hate that the only opinions I see are either, if you don’t vote for Biden to get rid of trump, you’re evil, or vice versa. There is nothing wrong with treating the vote as a choice for something you want, not what you want less. It doesn’t make you bad.

The Biden-Harris tkt is anti-American, anti-Catholic, pro-abortion even after birth, they are pro-murder!  They are anti-police, anti-freedom, no personal responsibility,.  They promote indoctrination &amp; Communism.  . is NOT #Catholic if you are promoting tkt. #Catholic
It’s not official Trump gear, this is fake just like Biden has products made overseas, though no one want any of it.  get a clue!
Biden has a 25 point lead in New York according to the latest polls. This is Trump just saying shit. Because in fact, he's terrified and wants to pretend he's confident. Unfortunately.
Blame the people in charge. Blame the people who keep the two party system. Blame the people who make it impossible for your choice to matter. Make your choice matter. Because if Trump wins, you voting for Biden because you think he’s your only chance...
Don’t just vote Biden cause you won’t Trump our. Find a candidate you actually like, even if you know they can’t win. Vote for who you’d want. When either win, and things get even worse, don’t blame the common voter, or say that a third party or independent are spoilers
Biden's biggest weakness is among young voters. Why not use the convention to help fix that?
See, there is no reason NOT to vote for the Biden ticket because Omaha already has mandatory masks.  We were the last city our size NOT to require them. Nobody is afraid of masks. They rely on the Covid tests.
Trump calls Kamala Harris ‘mad woman’ and bizarrely claims Democrats want to abolish ‘any kind of animals' and tear down Empire State Building #SmartNews #wtf #crazytrump #idiotinchief #Biden/Harris2020 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸💙💙💙💙💙💙💙
Come for the caring.  Stay for the racism.
You’ve got a typo there. Please remove Biden and insert Trump.
It was obvious from the very beginning. Harris checked all of the boxes, and crucially, already had a comfort level with Biden.
Its truth serum!   According to the new york times however Biden is a lying dog face pony soldier   .  We need the slug to take some
America This Week: United We Stand takes a look at Joe Biden's VP announcement and President Trump's reaction.
I expect him to get some largely ceremonial Cabinet post in a Biden administration.
This public speaker starts his talk on a treadmill on stage. It’s an effective and unexpected opener. I’d pay to see Biden use one at a debate and crush Trump.
If someone can convince me Biden &amp; Harris's policies and actions throughout the years, haven't had a worse effect on black men compared to Trump's admin than I might vote for them. If not then MAGA all the way.
Kamala has done more public speaking in 2 days than Biden in 2 months. Why?  #BidenHarris2020
Trump also urges Americans to wear masks but opposes a national requirement. Plus: The NFL tries to virus-proof stadiums, and local school officials struggle with reopening difficulties.
You deserved that call,I believe she called you one other time as well. You are her number one fan and that was a personable thing for her to do. I hope she will be in the Biden administration!
Biden the bigot lies and the next bigot affirms his lie. Thank you for being a prime example.
Well last time i checked #Biden is not the president    is! Go back to your #BasementJoe
If Trump can’t defeat Biden and his commie followers then he doesn’t deserve to be President and America deserves to become a third world banana Republic.
Ya   Right  Her, comrade Biden, and Bolshevik Bernie  all bought and sold by.,,, Russsia!!!  Tried to take down a sitting president  They are all mf’ers that need to go
Come on white women!  It’s up to us to vote Biden and Harris into office! Trump thinks we are not smart.  Let’s show him.  BIDEN HARRIS 2020!!!
I can feel your fear all the way over here in Nebraska’s 2nd district, where Biden leads in the polls.
Mark Cuban says people watched Fox News instead of the NBA because of the Biden-Harris coverage.
About damn time!  calls for a nationwide #maskmandate mandate, starting immediately!
About damn time!  calls for a nationwide #maskmandate mandate, starting immediately!
The Democratic presidential candidate also responded to those who push back against such mandates: “This is America. Be a patriot. Protect your fellow citizens. Step up, do the right thing.”
Joe Biden says no one should go outside without a mask for the next three months.  If you water your lawn you better have a mask.  Wow.  What a cutting edge idea.  I’m gonna vote for Joe.  He is sooooo smart.
At 19 weeks, 6 days, 23 hours and 59 minutes, it’s not a human being but at 20 weeks it is? Regardless of that illogical train of thought, dismemberment abortion rips apart a child limb by limb. You are okay with that? Joe Biden’s Democrat Party I guess!
And please explain me what ”science” is mandating mask wearing outside! 🤣🤣 Must be the Democrat 5600 genders science. BTW .. Did Joe Biden stop being a racist and a grabber to Kamala as soon as she got picked for VP? Miracle!
Joe Biden’s Democrat Party — they think ripping a human being apart limb by limb is a human right.
Possibly the best reason to vote for a Biden/Harris ticket
It started with a tweet from Dr. Jill Biden. “Hey (Douglas Emhoff). Are you ready?” she asked. “Ready to work! Let’s go (Dr. Jill Biden)!” he wrote back. So who is Douglas Emhoff?
Did you really think they answer any unscripted questions. Biden will only do a debate if moderators only ask him questions that his handlers provide. It’s amazing the protections being provided by the left wing media mob. Biden sold his office, and will sell out America #sad
The Bolsheviks have spoke! "Let's institute a mask mandate"- Bolshevik Biden  We have to Fight this nonsense👊🏽🇺🇲
Your jokin right decency and honest are not biden qualities
Joe Biden is a sinner who carries the name of God in vain.
Questions have arisen about whether Johnson's Senate committee is mimicking, even indirectly, Russian efforts and amplifying its propaganda.

We know in Biden's case he cashed more than just our governments checks.
If Joe and Donald split the electoral college 50/50 then the decision goes to the House, where Dems rule.  It’s that simple: there is no reason for me in NECD-2 to vote for Joe Biden in order for him to get ONE electoral college vote. I don’t want to, &amp; don’t have to, so I won’t.

Thank you  !  Brilliant to frame Harris’ “failed” presidential run in light of what Biden learned during his failures
They are laughing at us due to you ineptitude. Btw no matter what you try to do to the post office it will not stop me for casting my vote for Biden/Harris. #RidenWithBidenAndHarris2020
Harris selection could majorly boost Biden among Latino voters, polling firm says
Harris did everything she needed to do in her first appearance with Biden, and then some
Why no news coverage and panic when the swine flu hit in 2008? Because the dems were in power. They will wreck the country to get trump out of office. If biden is elected, the virus will be forgotten. The deep state is real folks.
I understand not wanting to vote for Biden but last election showed not voting had a lot to do with Trump winning too. If Biden is willing to have someone as his right hand who is more for the people, I think he’ll be influenced to do more good AND if his health declines she will
Trump used sound effects from The Texas Chainsaw Massacre for his latest campaign ad  #SmartNews
Joe Biden getting a huge boost from Kamal Harris selection for Vice President. People love it all over the country. Lot of energy and enthusiasm for BIDEN/HARRIS.
Hey  even ACLU of Nebraska says "one-size-fits-all laws have no place in healthcare." Yet your plan would strip 180 MILLION Americans of their private healthcare and force them onto a one-size-fits-all plan that even Joe Biden said would bankrupt the country.
In her first remarks as Biden's running mate on Wednesday, she spoke of her mother's Indian roots but described herself as the "first Black woman" to be nominated for the vice presidency on a major party ticket.
