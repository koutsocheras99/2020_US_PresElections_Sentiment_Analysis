American values? Like the values the left lets happen in Portland? Those American values of burning federal buildings? Undermine the constitution? You might be as mentally unfit as Biden.
I feel sorry for Biden. This statement shows he is not well mentally. I pray for him and you should, too.
Biden is not well. I don‚Äôt get how the Democrats aren‚Äôt finding a replacement? Biden will get eaten alive in the debates. Do the right thing Democrat‚Äôs and get another candidate.
but.. but .. the MSM said there is no wall.... Biden says border wall construction will stop if he‚Äôs elected president
Mainstream media malfeasance in the USA has reached a point where (1) politicians and protest leaders - including Joe Biden, over the past two days - are literally apologizing for doing specific things at the same time (2) the press is denying they ever occurred. #so_theres_that
AG James of NY, going after the NRA, is probably not great for Biden.
Imagine Biden being the one who let one of his families handle the pandemic plan and they both just let the virus spread, thinking that only red states would be the ones that get infected the most.   Now that sounds likes like a nazi to me.
Fundamentally it comes down to whether people think Trump (and his Supreme Court picks) is worse than Biden (and his picks).  Clearly some people think they're equally bad.  It's fine, we disagree, and I don't think our minds are going to be changed on that.
A lot of People know what Joe Biden means  but they purposely skew his comment to make it look monolithic or of malicious intent. I knew exactly what he meant when I watched the video and I think a lot of people do but we need to keep pushing the rhetoric that Joe is outta touch
Trump aides frustrated by his ‚Äònonsensical‚Äô Biden attacks in Ohio: AP reporter #SmartNews
I don't know, man.  I look at Biden as the GWB of the Dem Party.  Unexciting and gaffe-prone, but not sinister.  Not to mention, you kind of have to pick a lane between "look at all the bad things he says and means" vs. "he's senile and can't think straight".
I think Biden is actually more racist than Trump. Trump just says somewhat racist things because he thinks that‚Äôs what his base wants to hear.
It‚Äôs a gaffe because in the very statement he disses Biden, he uses the phrase ‚Äúthe black vote.‚Äù Which is doing  the very thing he is accusing Biden of.
A man that for decades refused to rent to Blacks &amp; created a corporate culture that made sure no one working for him would rent a Trump property to a Black person is? How are you, a person that had to be forced by the federal government to stop this practice, better then Biden?
Only Joe Biden has that power
Biden wants to do that? Biden? üò≥. Where are you getting your news from?
Wait!! Are you now realizing that racist ran this country?üò≥. The founding fathers ran this country. Most had slaves. It‚Äôs why we have BLM. And Biden supports it. Trump supports the worship of confederate monuments.
Joe Biden hates the blacks! Picking Fake Black Kamala will prove it. She‚Äôs Indian-Canadian!
The Fake News Media is more dangerous than the China Virus! They love Oriental Biden!!!
Ask Obama about Biden. He picked him as his VP. We trust Michelle and Barry over any confederate flag supporters.
Biden is so senile he probably forgot he is a Catholic.
I believe Joe Biden‚Äôs probable dementia will limit his capability to handle complex situations.
So...where‚Äôs Trump‚Äôs statement of faith then? Perhaps too written by his staff? Even if it was written by his staff (which I doubt), the fact that Biden CARES enough about his faith to actually have his staff write &amp; approve this document is proof of where his values lie.
Not Joe Biden. Joe would have said month not monolith. He had a hard time reading the note cards now.
Humble Obama. Gotta love him. Unlike what we have now. üòïAlways know that he has still more work to do. Like the inequality. Biden will build on his work.
Way to divert attention from Biden's  continued insults against the black community.
Biden isn't writing this people. His cognitive decline appears at a point that he may have trouble even comprehending the tweet. That he is the Dem nominee is an abomination and an indictment of a political system thoroughly corrupt and broken.
In any given debate, Joe Biden doesn‚Äôt have to say a word.  He just needs to stand there looking presidential while Trump opens his mouth, puts both feet in and confirms what an ignoramus he is!!
Things I learned during the 2020 election... - Biden is a worse candidate than Hillary - Trump is a worse candidate than Biden - A Biden vote is immoral - Trump wins if he follows Covid doctors  - It's the worst election ever. We lose no matter who wins.
Things the candidates for President should do to win... - Trump: Stop tweeting. Stop talking. Just stop. Put up pictures of the American flag. - Biden: Do nothing. Say nothing. Just stop. Put up pictures of you smiling.
Things all American citizens should do, regardless of party affiliation... - Call out Trump foolishness - Call out Biden for not campaigning openly - Refuse to let bias in the media determine political views - Demand an open and honest election
I actually pity poor Joe Biden.  He can't even pander to his misled sheeple right.
Media things that should happen... - Press Trump on Epstein link - Call out Biden for hiding his mental issues by avoiding live interviews - Cover late-night violent "protests" live - Admit that you are not doing your job and do better
By this point, if Joe Biden ate a baby, the media would praise his "VERY traditional low-cal paleo-diet." #just_the_facks_maam
Non-partisan point - politicians are way too old. I broke down the following ages for a piece today: Joe Biden (77), Nancy Pelosi (80), Mitch McConnell (78), Bernie Sanders (78), Donald Trump (spring chicken at 74). I'm just 37...and can't touch the rim anymore. What gives?
Is there a church near by for Trump to go to? If he thinks Biden is hurting God then he should offer his prayers to ‚Äòhelp‚Äô God.
This epitomizes the GOP in the era of Trump. Trump, speaking of Biden, "He's against God. He's against guns." Only now would those two sentences be conjoined in this way.
Every time Joe Biden opens his mouth, at least 1,000 new Trump voters are created.
The same people who were like "Dick Cheney is the real President" instead of W, are you just as concerned for who is going to run this country instead of Biden? It's clear he's not all there. It's worrisome.
BIDEN HATES THE BLACKS. PROBABLY BECAUSE HE IS OWNED BY THE ORIENTALS.

JOE BIDEN SWALLOWS TWO HANDFULS OF PILLS A DAY, JUST TO KEEP HIS DEMENTIA IN CHECK
It was 58% of white people in 2016. 50% is an improvement, and it tracks with Biden doing 8% better than Hillary
He is not obvious with his intentions. That's just delusion right there. If you think he was ever honest about anything, you need to get your head out of his ass.   and no, I dont support Biden. I also think he is a racist puppet. but he isn't as damaging as Donald.
It was a dementia test! We only give those to patients that we suspect may have dementia. The vast majority of my patients never receive a test for dementia, because they show no signs of dementia-just like Joe Biden.
You would think the Christians who reject everything Jesus taught would understand how this works...  Just because Biden doesn't agree with the Vatican doesn't mean he's not Catholic. By that standard, most Catholics aren't "real" Catholic. If you believe that, just say that.
Trump Campaign Busted For Deceptively Manipulating Biden Photos In New Ad #SmartNews
Biden is going to ‚Äòhurt God‚Äô, like the omnipotent ruler of creation? Is there a wrestling match I don‚Äôt know about?
I also assume that any politician that has been in the public eye has baggage. Part of Biden‚Äôs decision process is to determine which baggage is manageable and which is an automatic knockout (I‚Äôm looking at you Church of Scientology)
Go by the poles and you will lose by the corrupt poles, no way Trump is behind Biden.  Maybe his dementia has influenced his followers minds
Biden is not well. I‚Äôm concerned about his well being. It‚Äôs obvious he won‚Äôt serve a full term as president. He‚Äôll be lucky to serve a day, if elected. The question is why hasn‚Äôt the left found a candidate to replace this sick man?
Biden is apparently metal as fuck
ThTs for sure. The best candidates are never just one party or the other. Who would have thought the Republicans would become the Freedom Cacus party. Biden is the best choice this election.
Ozzy Osbourne hired to interpret Joe Biden‚Äôs speeches
I read the piece and I understand her reasoning. I think that acknowledging that Trump is a danger to our way of life *but* withholding support for Biden, regardless of the reason, is a selfish act and I resent anyone talking about doing it.
A Lying Trump Says Biden Will ‚ÄúHurt the Bible, Hurt God‚Äù if He Wins the Election

Imagining a world where Biden wins and Democrats retake the Senate and hold the House. RBG and Breyer retire on Jan. 20. Multiple Senate and House investigations are opened into the Trump admin. Ok, that was nice. Back to reality.
Apparently Donald believes that Joe Biden can hurt God.
Does Donald think Joe Biden can hurt God?
"We all know Biden is the lesser evil"  Hoo boy, I would suggest wading into some progressive anger Twitter threads and see if they feel the same way.
You don't have to, but as the only two realistic options for next POTUS are Biden or Trump, a vote for neither functions as if you prefer both of them to an equal degree, which I find hard to believe to be true for almost every voter.
So let me get this straight, S.E., if Joe Biden doesn‚Äôt pick your pick, you  will vote for.............. ? You are way too intelligent to waste your vote on an independent, Kanye, or, God forbid, Trump.

I hope Biden asks Trump to cite a bible passage that‚Äôs meaningful for him during the debate...and doesn‚Äôt allow him to sidestep by claiming it‚Äôs ‚Äúvery personal.‚Äù Trump is a gigantic fraud.

Literally to each their own. And again stop shaming voters. That‚Äôs not gonna get people to vote for Joe Biden. And it‚Äôs mainly boomers and old people not making good choices
An important difference between Joe Biden and Donald Trump... is willing to admit a slip of the tongue and generally correct it on the spot. While  doubles down trying to prove what he said is correct. I prefer a leader with a little humility.
And Illinois has voted democratic for the last 7 elections, so it‚Äôs safe to say it‚Äôs going to be blue this year again too. And if you don‚Äôt think it‚Äôll be blue then it‚Äôs Joe Biden‚Äôs fault for being a weak candidate and his supporters should be phone banking and knocking on doors.

Why is he then pushing it out so late? Biden probably won't even be your nominee

His disease in progressing fast. No one with dementia should be abused like Joe Biden.
People with dementia like Joe Biden should not travel to large gatherings.
Have YOU ever listened to Biden?
Its not good yo challenge people with dementia like Joe Biden.
This may have been missed but I'm no Biden champion.  If this was a parliamentary-style vote I'd be voting differently.  So I'm going the lesser of two evils route.  I think Trump has damaged our system and our political way in a uniquely dangerous way.
So you love all the followers of your ideal candidate?  Hell, a lot of Bernie fans (if you don't want the "bros") aren't even listening to him when he's saying to vote for Biden.
Genuine question -- what's the play by voting Green Party?  What do you hope to achieve?  As a comparison point, what I hope to achieve by voting for Biden is to make Donald Trump no longer be president.
Biden would be a sucker to debate or campaign. We get in front of the burning Hindenburg?
I cannot believe how stupid and ignorant Trump is!!  Can‚Äôt imagine someone as intelligent as Obama ever having a conversation with him!!  Think Joe Biden will chew him up and spit him out in a debate!!
Lol. Yes we know where your wacky conspiracy theories come from. But heh...  Elect the man who trashed America after he inherited a steady stable rising economy to ‚Äúmake America great again‚Äù. ü•¥  Because that‚Äôs what Biden supporters are doing... Getting America back.
The relationship between the Green Party and Dems is closer than Green Party and GOP.  If someone was 0% likely to vote for Trump and 1% likely to vote for Biden/whatever Dem, the Green Party vote costs the Dem, not Trump.
If the reverse was true we‚Äôd be subject to endless committee hearings on it in the Senate
Yep.  Note that we're not sitting here championing Biden or this system.  We're just saying he sucks less and sometimes that's important, especially right now.  And yes, Trump is way worse than GWB or any of the others.
Biden is running on the most progressive platform for a nominee in some time, certainly moreso than Hillary's campaign.  Think that all just comes from within him?
Its hard to pile on Joe Biden. It feels like elder abuse picking on an individual with dementia. How could his loved ones let this continue.
Joe Biden is fucking insane!!! He gets so defensive and lashes out on everybody that interviews him! How are people genuinely excited to vote for this man is beyond me
I voted for Bernie in the primary.  He lost, I accepted it, and I'm voting for the best remaining option.  I don't know why all the Bernie Bros feel the need to keep crying on Twitter.  Vote a progressive into office in your district to influence Biden.  This isn't hard.
I'm being dumb and letting myself get Mad Online about "Biden and Trump are the same" people.  COVID management.  Supreme Court nomination.  Even at least fathoming a public health care option.  If none of this convinces you then vote progressive for Congress and Biden for POTUS.
WE MUST REMOVE Moscow Mitch. Biden won't be able to do much if he remains.
The actions and in-actions of your father #worthlessandweakpresident has put us in our present situation. That is why we are voting for Biden. By the way, I used to vote republican.
OMG.  This is absurd.  Look at what's happened with freaking COVID.  Americans aren't allowed to travel to 95% of the world because our pandemic has been so mismanaged.  No one is claiming that Biden is amazing.  But the "same as Trump" stuff is willful ignorance at best.
Genuine question -- what's your opinion of the Supreme Court in all of this?  Are you indifferent as to whether Joe Biden or Donald Trump nominates the next Supreme Court justice to very likely replace RBG?
Biden snaps at question on cognitive test, likens it to asking reporter if he‚Äôs ‚Äòa junkie‚Äô
And the Trump campaign, especially tries to say Joe Biden has dementia?? Biden may be old, look old, but when he speaks he is strong, alert and memes incredible sense. He gives off an aura of being powerful and in charge! Trump looks like the village idiot!!
Let me school you. Black women in SC carried Biden to the nomination. To say that dems ‚Äútook the left overs‚Äù is to not even count blacks especially black women as part of the voting community. Not human. Not valued. Not counted. Not seen. Not noticed. Not appreciated....pick one.
Yeah. Because the ‚Äúprogressive left has been running Biden for year‚Äù ü•¥. Get informed.

America watched the Jonathon Swan/Axios interview. If you think that babbling parent of yours, with his pathetic stack of charts, would be any match for Joe Biden in a moderated debate you are as deluded as he is. All Biden has to do is sit back, wait, &amp; watch trump implode.
It's BIDEN!  (Kidding, kidding, bidets rule.)
Biden isn‚Äôt a narcissist and his voters don‚Äôt care a lick about Biden merch. We just want to vote for him and get the current trash out of the WH. Trump needs all the hats and tshirts to cover for the fact that he has NO PLATFORM.
Why isn‚Äôt BIDEN giving any interviews?
No way, this is rope-a-dope move to go up until first debate date and then Biden will pull out the rug like Lucy with the football.
let face it this has been a failure of government at the federal level which you and Biden have been part of for too long.  anything over 2 terms for senators is way too long.

I wonder what the Vegas odds would be on Biden actually debating Trump?
Yo-Semite  If I see another "Biden is in cognitive decline!" ad from Team Trump I'm going to punch my TV.  Of course, it's equally likely he's never heard of Yosemite. A president* never having heard of one of our most famous national parks.  I'm not sure which is worse.
CrazyTown - Extended Joe Biden Edition  via
I've honestly been wildly unimpressed by Trump's recent interviews - but, gotta say, HE'S DOING INTERVIEWS.   Joe Biden is running for President, in the "contender" role. When are we going to see the standard 2-3 hour sit-down with HIM, on  or even NBC?
Yes I like the red meat they all yhrow at us, but I know that as soon as Joe Biden is inaugurated they are jumping right back to the other side acting like 2016 to 2021 never happened, just like the Bush years never happened
My thought was to retweet this to Eric &amp; Junior. They are hell bent on having Biden debate this quivering blob of stupid. Joe would eviscerate him.
I'm inclined to call this a Biden gaffe.
Economic success? Thanks to him, Biden‚Äôs going to inherit a country in the midst of the worst recession since George Bush passed his on to Obama. But like Obama, Biden will bring the economy back to life so the next Republican can take the credit like Trump did.
Biden wants Americans to die.
Have you seen/heard Biden recently?
Right to "bare arms"?  Watch out 'murica, Joe Biden is coming for your tank tops!
The Presidency is not a pubescent little girl - I doubt Joe Biden could handle it.
Biden's moral compass is not as bad as Donald's.  Both puppets, but Donald stomps his feet because he wants the illusion of power and the illusion of acceptance. Hence why his core family now works in the house. and the Reps take advantage.  Biden just works for the Dems.
The problem is that Biden still has a moral compass.  Both old guys that really shouldn't be handling the top office of a country. But one has had their moral compass expired due to their lifestyle.
Trump campaign accuses Biden campaign of leaving 'trap door' open for ex-VP to avoid debates

ok we know at Biden is not up this late, but this is just POTUS brand rebranded.  go check the Obama Biden administration record one buying from China when US manufacturers had the same product for a penny more.  sure it was one  million pennies more, but the US worker had none
I completely agree with her though. We need someone who isn‚Äôt afraid to do what needs to be done. She has already moved Biden left, imagine what she can do as VP!! üóΩüóΩ
Without being crude, it's worth keeping in mind that Biden's VP pick - as the second to a 77-78 year old guy in the era of COVID-19 - will almost certainly spend some time as President.   Who would you actually like to see in that role?
It is sad that Joe Biden has dementia. The left has to stop using a disabled man as a substitute for the real candidate to be named later. Stop the abuse, its shameful.
Biden's social media team might be the easiest job on the planet.
While President Trump has shown ALL AMERICANS &amp; politicians how to do American business RIGHT, Democrats believe Joe Biden is the perfect man for..."You know...the THING"  What, exactly, IS "The THING", Joe?  Were you created MORE EQUAL than others?

I really despise Trump. But has anyone else noticed the sheer incoherence of Joe Biden? If he were a republican the media would crucify him.   The next president will be Dumb or Dumber. Can we get a pass? Maybe do the "autonomous collective" thing?
And he wants to attack Biden on eloquence
I don't know what Trump is talking about. Make America great again. America was always great! It's the people that make America, America. It's the blacks, whites, Latinos, Asians everyone. When Biden wins he even said his cabinet will look like America.
Sanders refused to deliver a career-ending blow to Biden. Sanders is so obsessed about defeating Trump, that calling out a pathological liar on Team Blue was out of the question.

So when do Biden and the Democrats start talking about policies that, you know, encourage people to vote?
Yeah, but neither Trump or Biden will be doing that now or in the future.
But Trump would use his time to falsely accused Biden of outrageous made up things.  Biden would spend the night denying etc.  And Trump would make a chunk of watchers believe the lies.
No offense intended on the age factor, as Biden is pushing 80. Just want to get No. 2 younger and viable for the future. I like Harris, but fear her attack on Biden re his past and race gives too much ammo to GOP. Kamla for AG üëçüèº, VP worries me. Trump‚Äôs gotta lose!

Candidates always announce near the convention for a momentum boost &amp; to dominate the news cycle. Great example is McCain‚Äôs Palin announcement. Totally stole the thunder from Obama‚Äôs convention. This is campaigning 101! Announcing earlier could have cost Biden these advantages.
The entire time would be spent with Biden being accused of being a child molester etc.  I see no point to Biden trying to defend himself against a new pack of lies
Duckworth has a lot of positives without the negatives. She‚Äôs likeable and is hard to campaign against. She also won‚Äôt overshadow Biden.
No way Biden picks Karen Bass as VP after the last 48 hours. Kamala Harris also seems like a liability, as is Susan Rice to an even greater degree. I still think it‚Äôll be Tammy Duckworth.
The people who today say that Joe Biden is crushing President Trump are the same people that said #HillaryClinton was on her way to a historic landslide in 2016 (even on Election Day).   Joe Biden is not winning!

I would love to see Biden go at Trump in a real debate. It would be something to see
Let me be honest with you, to begin with, they're not debates at all. They are nothing more than Q and A's. They scrapped debates a long time ago, and replace them with these BS Q&amp;A sessions. I don't see those as being useful for Biden
No it wouldn't damage Biden's chances at all. Nobody expects Trump to stand there and give a truthful answer to anything, so why even have a debate?
Former Clinton Press Secretary Joe Lockhart says Biden should skip debates because of Trump's lying. But would that damage his chances?  Biden shouldn't dignify a liar. He should do some town halls.  They go low, we ignore them.
I think if you had a better grasp of economics our GDP wouldn't have contracted by 33% in the last 3 months. How many of your unemployed MAGATs have 401k accounts? You can't predict a market crash. You're not that smart. I think they will soar when Biden takes over.
It is totally unreasonable of Joe Biden to select a female running mate.   There is no way Mother is going to let Mike Pence talk to another woman for an hour.

If "Latinos are Black (AOC)" and "If you don't vote for me, you ain't Black (Biden)," do Hispanics ALSO have to vote for Uncle Joe in 2020 or risk becoming white? #questions_remain #if_all_Snarks_are_also_Snooks
Scenario:  You are in the living room and you‚Äôre alerted that Biden is choking in the other room.  You can save him.  Question:  Do you administer aid yourself or call 911, regardless of your political beliefs because you‚Äôre a decent human being?
Nice try. No true Republican would put in Biden, he is a a Trojan Horse for the far left and is a danger to our democracy.
So are the advisers around Biden's brain stem.

Robert Jeffress: Evangelical Biden Voters Have ‚ÄúSold Their Soul to the Devil‚Äù
We were greeted this morning by a more that life-sized cut out of Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot, wearing a mask, bungeed to a tree next to our Biden sign in our front lawn. So many questions ...any answers?
One nice thing about delaying this year‚Äôs election is it would force Joe Biden to declare a side in the War on Christmas.
It‚Äôs true. Biden plans to build an extensive subway network throughout the Midwest. And then fill it with dangerous thugs.
Lol only if Biden wins otherwise Dems and MSM media will continue to hold America hostage
Why must you increase the tension and continuously make things worse?  Stop spreading your hate and fueling the fire!  Biden 2020
With that in mind, you would be demanding that Donald should resign as he clearly is suffering exactly what the republicans say Biden has.
There goes the 18-30 vote. Joe Biden really should write Trump a thank you letter.

We are now? 150,000 people died in 4 months doesn‚Äôt sound safe to me. This a Republican is voting BLUE BIDEN ALL THE WAY.
The Focus on the Family founder warned the country about the HORRORS of an Obama presidency in 2008. His concerns didn't pan out.   Now he's saying the same things about Biden.
How does this undermine our national security interest?  Seems the total plan would be in our best interest.  troops get spread out and maybe those other countries will step up and do their fair share.  BTW  the big WRONG message was sent by the Obama  Biden administration.
Well, who the hell else are you gonna vote for? Biden? Sanders? One guy will molest your daughter, the other will molest your wallet.
A reminder: Whenever Joe Biden announces his VP, liberals will be furious it wasn't their first choice, and conservatives will say "Democrats in disarray!" while exaggerating every¬†past blemish on her record.   IGNORE IT. None of it changes how Trump must be defeated.
Your logic is weird, because then Kamala lost to pretty much every candidate, who all lost to Sanders, who only lost because it took everyone dropping out and supporting Biden for him to win  üòÜ Sanders lost and there is no disputing that, but he lost to the DNC not to Biden
Democrat Talking Pts 1. We care about you! 2. Biden‚Äòs not hidin‚Äô 3. COLLUSION! 4. BELIEVE THE MEDIA 5. There‚Äôs no fraud w/ Mail Ballots! 6. Durham Report isn‚Äôt necessary 7. Crime‚Äôs Up? Must be Trump! 8. Riots! Where? 9. COPS BAD, ANTIFA GOOD 10. Protesters can‚Äôt get/spread Covid!

Trump never debated Clinton. He just abused the truth and her. He does not deserve to ‚Äúdebate‚Äù Biden given his lies and corruption. No need to debate a criminal, impeached and convicted and conflicted.

Must we pretend there's an invisible barrier that will protect us? I mean, if I have to I'll play along, but it's not fun.  Say Biden wins by a lot. Does anyone think Trump/Barr can't send uniformed guys to Biden's house before the inauguration to arrest &amp; send him to Guantanamo?
Don‚Äôt stoop. I got the finger at a stoplight from a trumper because of my Biden sticker. I shrugged. It felt right.

Awesome point, Ryan. Question: when your house is on fire do you insist on distilled water and fire fighters who pass your purity tests? Asking for a country that‚Äôs on fucking fire and Biden and the Democrats are the only fire fighters who can douse this inferno. Grow up.
‚ÄúBut it's also possible Trump, intentionally or not, is setting a trap by shifting more of his own vote to Election Day while Biden's ballots face a higher risk of rejection, legal limbo and lengthy counting delays‚Äù
‚ÄúBiden calls for 100 percent clean electricity by 2035. Here‚Äôs how far we have to go.‚Äù

Yeah. Not hot about Biden but I‚Äôm excited about getting Trump out. Also, not hot for far left either. Looking forward to his VP. Maybe someone to run in 4 years.  Don‚Äôt think he would want to run again.
It's gonna look real bad on the Too Senile crowd when Biden functions normally, essentially hurdling over the low bar they've set for him.
Isn't attacking someone for their opinion imposing a different purity test?  I'll be voting for Biden, pandering and all.  I hope he does a great job.
Went out the window a long time ago
Do you mean like ANTIFA is A myth?   Mr. Nadler requires a cognitive health examination.... Quite clear that his mental health is declining and he may well be worse off than Biden.

Susan Rice has probably been thrown around the most outside of the two that were presidential nominees. Do you think her experience would make her qualified for stepping in if she had to? That‚Äôs my only concern, especially if Biden is 1 term.

They better come out before the elections. Otherwise, if Biden wins, gets impeached. Now we have Harris as President.Oh No, Is Joe Biden Going To Spank The Lord Right On The Bottom?!
My opinion from the very beginning. I think Biden, if elected and gets to take office, should appoint her as AG and then sick her ass on the whole Trump cadre.

AG James of NY, going after the NRA, is probably not great for Biden.
Imagine Biden being the one who let one of his families handle the pandemic plan and they both just let the virus spread, thinking that only red states would be the ones that get infected the most.   Now that sounds likes like a nazi to me.
Fundamentally it comes down to whether people think Trump (and his Supreme Court picks) is worse than Biden (and his picks).  Clearly some people think they're equally bad.  It's fine, we disagree, and I don't think our minds are going to be changed on that.
A lot of People know what Joe Biden means  but they purposely skew his comment to make it look monolithic or of malicious intent. I knew exactly what he meant when I watched the video and I think a lot of people do but we need to keep pushing the rhetoric that Joe is outta touch

Trump aides frustrated by his ‚Äònonsensical‚Äô Biden attacks in Ohio: AP reporter #SmartNews
I don't know, man.  I look at Biden as the GWB of the Dem Party.  Unexciting and gaffe-prone, but not sinister.  Not to mention, you kind of have to pick a lane between "look at all the bad things he says and means" vs. "he's senile and can't think straight".
Ha ha ha ha you think white people are smart... (yes, I'm voting for Biden; I try NOT to be a flippin' idiot. And no, I'm not concerned about who his running-mate will be).
I think Biden is actually more racist than Trump. Trump just says somewhat racist things because he thinks that‚Äôs what his base wants to hear.
Your kidding, right? Biden hasn‚Äôt had anybody ‚Äùrecovery‚Äù because he hasn‚Äôt been president! And, as others have pointed out, these are just people returning to jobs they already had. And let‚Äôs not forget the 1.2 million new unemployment claims over the last week. Bunch of idiots
It‚Äôs a gaffe because in the very statement he disses Biden, he uses the phrase ‚Äúthe black vote.‚Äù Which is doing  the very thing he is accusing Biden of.
Biden won't even commit to correcting cannabis prohibition which has ruined hundreds of thousand of lives and has 80% support from his party.  Simply not being trump isn't good enough.
These tweets didn't age very well, Donnie.  2020 isn't going so well. And we'll both know what that means...  A landslide win for Joe Biden!  Lots of people will vote for him. You should too!
A man that for decades refused to rent to Blacks &amp; created a corporate culture that made sure no one working for him would rent a Trump property to a Black person is? How are you, a person that had to be forced by the federal government to stop this practice, better then Biden?

Thank you!! This is not being  discussed  enough. When he projects his mental decline on Biden, just throw it right back at him. He can barely stand straight or walk at times
Biden isn't writing this people. His cognitive decline appears at a point that he may have trouble even comprehending the tweet. That he is the Dem nominee is an abomination and an indictment of a political system thoroughly corrupt and broken.
In any given debate, Joe Biden doesn‚Äôt have to say a word.  He just needs to stand there looking presidential while Trump opens his mouth, puts both feet in and confirms what an ignoramus he is!!
By this point, if Joe Biden ate a baby, the media would praise his "VERY traditional low-cal paleo-diet." #just_the_facks_maam

If you don‚Äôt recognize Biden is in the latter stages of Alzheimer‚Äôs you may need to take a cognitive test.
Donald Trump said Joe Biden wants to: "Hurt the bible, hurt God. He's against God..."  A guy who gassed protestors to use the bible and a church as props in a photo op said this.  Am I missing something?
Non-partisan point - politicians are way too old. I broke down the following ages for a piece today: Joe Biden (77), Nancy Pelosi (80), Mitch McConnell (78), Bernie Sanders (78), Donald Trump (spring chicken at 74). I'm just 37...and can't touch the rim anymore. What gives?
Is there a church near by for Trump to go to? If he thinks Biden is hurting God then he should offer his prayers to ‚Äòhelp‚Äô God.
This epitomizes the GOP in the era of Trump. Trump, speaking of Biden, "He's against God. He's against guns." Only now would those two sentences be conjoined in this way.
Keep up with your faith President Biden, God is still in control.
You mean Biden‚Äôs handlers didn‚Äôt apologize...Biden was busy drooling on pillow
Why lie about it. Our 2 amendment rights not going anywhere.  Joe Biden just want assault guns to go away along with you. We all want you to go away! NRA are thieves like you. They just need to give up the non profit status. They are stealing &amp; not pay their fair share of taxes
Just had that conversation today with my Financial advisor. He and his wife were conflicted in 2016. We talked about what President Trump has accomplished and they are more comfortable voting for Trump. Played him the latest Biden statements
Once again, Trump is calling himself God!
Biden signs are in his basement where he misplaced them. May never see him or the signs. But polls will show him ahead assuring no Democrats go to the polls.
Dems are Godless, and they like it that way.  They relish in it.  Biden will stand in front of The Man very soon and be judged for his lifetime of baby killing, lying, and coveting $ over morality.  Pretty easy to see, if your eyes are open.
The Republican Party...  Does not care if doctors and nurses die.  Does not care if essential workers die.  Does not care if old people die.  Does not care if teachers die.  Does not care if your children die.  And does not care about you.  Vote them out.  89 days to go.  #Biden

It was 58% of white people in 2016. 50% is an improvement, and it tracks with Biden doing 8% better than Hillary
He is not obvious with his intentions. That's just delusion right there. If you think he was ever honest about anything, you need to get your head out of his ass.   and no, I dont support Biden. I also think he is a racist puppet. but he isn't as damaging as Donald.
In light of Biden's stutter, I was going to give him a break, but then I remembered that he mocked a disabled reporter, so no. Shitheads who live in glass houses, etc.
It was a dementia test! We only give those to patients that we suspect may have dementia. The vast majority of my patients never receive a test for dementia, because they show no signs of dementia-just like Joe Biden.
You would think the Christians who reject everything Jesus taught would understand how this works...  Just because Biden doesn't agree with the Vatican doesn't mean he's not Catholic. By that standard, most Catholics aren't "real" Catholic. If you believe that, just say that.

Oh.  My.  Biden....  Joe's gonna hurt god?  And destroy religion?  A feeble moron may have almost crippled the nation, but it takes a seriously powerful candidate to do all that.  He's got my vote.  #VoteBlueToEndThisNightmare
A Lying Trump Says Biden Will ‚ÄúHurt the Bible, Hurt God‚Äù if He Wins the Election
Does Biden golf? If not, it‚Äôs already like getting a president on sale!
Yes, I think he means to say that Biden stands with all the weenies and fruitcakes who care about stupid stuff like sustainability and clean energy. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Biden didn't destroy the NRA when he was Vice President for 8 years, Donnie.  Neither did Obama. In other, far more accurate words,        STOP GASLIGHTING!
Apparently Donald believes that Joe Biden can hurt God.
Does Donald think Joe Biden can hurt God?
"We all know Biden is the lesser evil"  Hoo boy, I would suggest wading into some progressive anger Twitter threads and see if they feel the same way.
You don't have to, but as the only two realistic options for next POTUS are Biden or Trump, a vote for neither functions as if you prefer both of them to an equal degree, which I find hard to believe to be true for almost every voter.
So let me get this straight, S.E., if Joe Biden doesn‚Äôt pick your pick, you  will vote for.............. ? You are way too intelligent to waste your vote on an independent, Kanye, or, God forbid, Trump.
Another delusional post. Congrats.  Biden 2020
Bozo could have lead us better through this pandemic then that clown sitting in 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. Yes, I have far more trust in Mr. Biden
How many times is Joe Biden gonna shit talk my people and still get our unquestionable loyalty?: /

Biden stands with the godless socialists burning The Bible on the streets of Portland.
Train wreck? You‚Äôre talking about Biden asking a black man if he was tested for cocaine.
Omg! Jesus! The polls right now are in Biden‚Äôs favor, but once he starts debating Trump, America is going to see how senile Joe is üòì Everything that comes out of his mouth is problematic! Trump is unfortunately going to out debate him
If history is any clue, it'll be "how much better it would have been if Biden had picked _______ for VP."
Joe Biden is a racist    Pass it on...
Holy crap! They‚Äôre really making *Joe Biden‚Äôs* mental acuity a campaign issue?? LMAO! Have they even seen Trump‚Äôs last 2 interviews?
Biden is prone to horrible lapses in judgment, but Trump has lowered the bar so much it probably won't matter.
Noted author accuses Jared Kushner of ‚Äòplanning last ditch try at disqualifying Biden ballots on election night‚Äô with Barr‚Äôs blessing #SmartNews
YOU. Are. The. Swamp.  Biden in 2020!
No, don‚Äôt vote for Kanye.  Voting for Kanye is exactly what Trump wants you to do, as it takes votes away from Biden.
Lol... please. Easiest way to beat trump will be to keep putting him on the air.  Literally the biggest horse‚Äôs ass ever elected. Dude, YOU‚ÄôRE probably smarter than he is.  Biden is up 8% in most polls.  Debates are only going to help him.  Your boy is done.
It needs to be made public. Voters need to know BEFORE they election. They have the right to that information when they cast their votes. Why can‚Äôt we know if Biden or others were involved or looked the other way?
I hope Biden asks Trump to cite a bible passage that‚Äôs meaningful for him during the debate...and doesn‚Äôt allow him to sidestep by claiming it‚Äôs ‚Äúvery personal.‚Äù Trump is a gigantic fraud.
Do people realize it‚Äôs a waste of energy to speculate on who Biden‚Äôs VP pick will be?
Person. Woman. Man. Camera. TV. but...sure, Joe Biden.
I hope it is the first thing to come down when Biden takes office. To me this act at the White house set the tone for much of what is going on. It is SHAMEFUL!
I am looking into early voting also. My dad voted for tRump on 2016 he is voting Biden but still is afraid of mail in voting. He has always voted at the polls (some things I can't changeüôÑ) so my friend and I thought of early voting make a day of it lunch ect...think it will fly
Peek a Boo! We know why you‚Äôre hidden Biden. ‚ÄúSleepy Joe, come out to plaaaaay!‚Äù
Literally to each their own. And again stop shaming voters. That‚Äôs not gonna get people to vote for Joe Biden. And it‚Äôs mainly boomers and old people not making good choices
And Illinois has voted democratic for the last 7 elections, so it‚Äôs safe to say it‚Äôs going to be blue this year again too. And if you don‚Äôt think it‚Äôll be blue then it‚Äôs Joe Biden‚Äôs fault for being a weak candidate and his supporters should be phone banking and knocking on doors.
Neither does Biden or any politician they all lie, question is why is Trump the only one censored or called out while the other side defends their candidates regardless?ü§î
Rumors are that Michelle Obama will be Biden‚Äôs VP choice. She announced today she is suffering a mild case of depression. Ticket could use a head case since Biden has none.
Biden will never debate
RESIGN effective immediately!!!!!  Biden 2020
That‚Äôs ridiculous, but whatever. You just hate dems. How could you possibly know what a Joe Biden presidency would have been?
Biden literally, LITERALLY, can‚Äôt talk for more than two straight sentences without almost mentally collapsing.
That Joe Biden??? üòÇ
Not sure if that polling from late May still holds up, but it doesn't seem like that would be the case.
Jokes on Biden since you‚Äôre too young to vote ü§£ü§£ü§£
Know do Biden hiding in his basement..
Remember how we weren't supposed to know that Donald was making some deals with Russia in his buildings.  Or how he was trying to blackmail countries to dig up dirt on Biden,  or he had Epstein die and now wants to pretend it might be suicide?
Absolutely. We have been around the block &amp; can see what a total disaster Biden will be. He is hostage to the left. Schools need to be open. This is another hostage situation. Parents should be outraged. Grandparents may have to step in to a caretaker role so parents can work
When Biden starts wearing a bib with his mask will the public suspect he‚Äôs in the advanced stages of Alzheimer‚Äôs?
Why is he then pushing it out so late? Biden probably won't even be your nominee
That is funny.  Yates said "in the meeting"  she did not and can not say there was no influence by Obama or Biden.   Comey first one to be thrown under the bus.  who will be next??
Biden has had a slight stuttering problem his whole life. Has absolutely nothing to do with his intelligence. Come up with something new Jr.
If we don‚Äôt, it won‚Äôt be because Biden canceled.
Big Orange takes more heat for this, but I'd put Joe Biden's racial gaffes ("You ain't Black (!)," "Did YOU take a test fer COCAINE (?)," "Black kids are just as smart as white kids," "Segregationists...but got things DONE") up against anyone this side of Julius Malema. #facks
What about this, Donnie? Is this Biden's fault too?  Pfft.
I think the danger is the unhinged left which will be the puppet master behind Biden. They were burning Bibles, like the Nazis they claim to hate. People who burn books often burn people attached to them.
Biden asked a black reporter if he took a test for cocaine. Biden is sadly suffering some kind of intellectual decline or he‚Äôs a racist. Either way, I‚Äôm voting #Trump2020
It's not a stupid question because I think Biden is in cognitive decline and this proves even more.
you know, i hear biden has some bad experience with dogs
Floriduh also apparently welcomed COVID-19 to Floriduh. Faith in Trump/Pence has been virtually eliminated.  Vote for Joe Biden on November 3.
This may have been missed but I'm no Biden champion.  If this was a parliamentary-style vote I'd be voting differently.  So I'm going the lesser of two evils route.  I think Trump has damaged our system and our political way in a uniquely dangerous way.
So you love all the followers of your ideal candidate?  Hell, a lot of Bernie fans (if you don't want the "bros") aren't even listening to him when he's saying to vote for Biden.
Joe Biden's basement strategy will backfire: Goodwin
Genuine question -- what's the play by voting Green Party?  What do you hope to achieve?  As a comparison point, what I hope to achieve by voting for Biden is to make Donald Trump no longer be president.
Biden would be a sucker to debate or campaign. We get in front of the burning Hindenburg?
I cannot believe how stupid and ignorant Trump is!!  Can‚Äôt imagine someone as intelligent as Obama ever having a conversation with him!!  Think Joe Biden will chew him up and spit him out in a debate!!
You lie so easily, I see why you would like to be Biden's running mate.
The relationship between the Green Party and Dems is closer than Green Party and GOP.  If someone was 0% likely to vote for Trump and 1% likely to vote for Biden/whatever Dem, the Green Party vote costs the Dem, not Trump.
I plan on it!  Thanks why I'm voting for Joe Biden. You should too, Donnie!  Make America Great Again - Vote for Biden!
If the reverse was true we‚Äôd be subject to endless committee hearings on it in the Senate
Yep.  Note that we're not sitting here championing Biden or this system.  We're just saying he sucks less and sometimes that's important, especially right now.  And yes, Trump is way worse than GWB or any of the others.
Biden is running on the most progressive platform for a nominee in some time, certainly moreso than Hillary's campaign.  Think that all just comes from within him?
Joe Biden is fucking insane!!! He gets so defensive and lashes out on everybody that interviews him! How are people genuinely excited to vote for this man is beyond me
I voted for Bernie in the primary.  He lost, I accepted it, and I'm voting for the best remaining option.  I don't know why all the Bernie Bros feel the need to keep crying on Twitter.  Vote a progressive into office in your district to influence Biden.  This isn't hard.
I'm being dumb and letting myself get Mad Online about "Biden and Trump are the same" people.  COVID management.  Supreme Court nomination.  Even at least fathoming a public health care option.  If none of this convinces you then vote progressive for Congress and Biden for POTUS.
OMG.  This is absurd.  Look at what's happened with freaking COVID.  Americans aren't allowed to travel to 95% of the world because our pandemic has been so mismanaged.  No one is claiming that Biden is amazing.  But the "same as Trump" stuff is willful ignorance at best.
Genuine question -- what's your opinion of the Supreme Court in all of this?  Are you indifferent as to whether Joe Biden or Donald Trump nominates the next Supreme Court justice to very likely replace RBG?
Trump's campaign knocks on a million doors a week. Biden's knocks on zero.
And he wants to portray Biden as too old or confused?  He can‚Äôt even pronounce Yosemite!
I think Biden has already committed to a black woman as running mate.
And the Trump campaign, especially tries to say Joe Biden has dementia?? Biden may be old, look old, but when he speaks he is strong, alert and memes incredible sense. He gives off an aura of being powerful and in charge! Trump looks like the village idiot!!
Biden a Marxist? Where do you get that view? I cannot think of one policy position he holds that even slightly hints of Marxism. Can you point to even one?
Trump doesn't need to pander to POC, he just hires one to steal votes from biden. Didn't Kanye say slavery was a choice?
Of course Biden‚Äôs health etc., should be examined as should Trump‚Äôs. Biden is older than I‚Äôd like him, but Trump is just a few years back of him.
Everything Biden has done he takes responsibility for. A lot of good but also some bad.   As for Trump....
I can‚Äôt speak on things I haven‚Äôt seen, but I‚Äôve have noticed Fox using footage of Biden consoling his grandchildren at his son‚Äôs funeral and describing it as ‚Äúgroping‚Äù. But that‚Äôs Fox for you.

There‚Äôs nothing wrong with Biden. His issue is on occasion is the stutter he‚Äôs had since childhood comes up. This is what Republicans cruelly and deliberately say is dementia. Meanwhile Trump slurs his words and reads at a second grade level.

A lot of people on the left have said this~ that  doesn‚Äôt care about me. It‚Äôs weird. I don‚Äôt expect him to care about me personally. I expect him to care about America. Do leftists think Nancy or Biden or AOC care about them? No. They just care about power.
If California votes for Biden by 70% I don‚Äôt see anyway Trump can improve his 2016 popular vote.
Actually, Joe Biden is pretty straight forward with the American Peiple.  is the sham and people are beginning to see that he is ‚Äúthe Emperor who has no clothes!‚Äù STFU, Eric!!
America watched the Jonathon Swan/Axios interview. If you think that babbling parent of yours, with his pathetic stack of charts, would be any match for Joe Biden in a moderated debate you are as deluded as he is. All Biden has to do is sit back, wait, &amp; watch trump implode.
It's BIDEN!  (Kidding, kidding, bidets rule.)
As a 55 year old former Republican, I‚Äôm doing the exact thing. Joe Biden must win or our Country will be gone!!!ü§òüèº
Bernie Sanders would be a FDR Democrat in 1936. Truman and LBJ (without Vietnam) were more progressive than Biden.
Biden isn‚Äôt a narcissist and his voters don‚Äôt care a lick about Biden merch. We just want to vote for him and get the current trash out of the WH. Trump needs all the hats and tshirts to cover for the fact that he has NO PLATFORM.
What are the odds Joe Biden will do these debates??
let face it this has been a failure of government at the federal level which you and Biden have been part of for too long.  anything over 2 terms for senators is way too long.
Biden beat you too it. Based on the good grammer, doubt you even typed it.
LOL Even better, 1/20/2021 when Donnie is dragged from the White House and Joe Biden arrives.
Yo-Semite  If I see another "Biden is in cognitive decline!" ad from Team Trump I'm going to punch my TV.  Of course, it's equally likely he's never heard of Yosemite. A president* never having heard of one of our most famous national parks.  I'm not sure which is worse.
On New Voter Registration in Key States, Trump is Blowing Biden Out of the Water
CrazyTown - Extended Joe Biden Edition  via
I've honestly been wildly unimpressed by Trump's recent interviews - but, gotta say, HE'S DOING INTERVIEWS.   Joe Biden is running for President, in the "contender" role. When are we going to see the standard 2-3 hour sit-down with HIM, on  or even NBC?
Just listening to Trump makes me wonder how any person following the news would lose a debate to him. All Biden needs to do is paraphrase himself: Every time Trump speaks, ‚Äúit‚Äôs a noun, a verb, and lie, lie, lie.‚Äù
These numbers are not accurate. We have not released them yet. Please take down this tweet.
Biden is
Only Biden has been wrong more than Fauci. It took Biden 51 years to reach that number- Fauci did it in 6 months.
My thought was to retweet this to Eric &amp; Junior. They are hell bent on having Biden debate this quivering blob of stupid. Joe would eviscerate him.
I'm inclined to call this a Biden gaffe.
Let me see... do those letters stand for "asshole" and "Biden" by any chance?
Economic success? Thanks to him, Biden‚Äôs going to inherit a country in the midst of the worst recession since George Bush passed his on to Obama. But like Obama, Biden will bring the economy back to life so the next Republican can take the credit like Trump did.
Mr. Biden is under no obligation to debate someone who has no compunction about lying.
A lot of people are saying that it would be worth it!
Biden will improve health care
One of the most important immediate tasks facing Joe Biden will be remedying our gigantic healthcare nightmare.
Looking like Biden will not be alive on Election Day. Not eating . Sign of late stage dementia as body shuts down.
Right to "bare arms"?  Watch out 'murica, Joe Biden is coming for your tank tops!
Biden's moral compass is not as bad as Donald's.  Both puppets, but Donald stomps his feet because he wants the illusion of power and the illusion of acceptance. Hence why his core family now works in the house. and the Reps take advantage.  Biden just works for the Dems.
The problem is that Biden still has a moral compass.  Both old guys that really shouldn't be handling the top office of a country. But one has had their moral compass expired due to their lifestyle.
ok we know at Biden is not up this late, but this is just POTUS brand rebranded.  go check the Obama Biden administration record one buying from China when US manufacturers had the same product for a penny more.  sure it was one  million pennies more, but the US worker had none
Without being crude, it's worth keeping in mind that Biden's VP pick - as the second to a 77-78 year old guy in the era of COVID-19 - will almost certainly spend some time as President.   Who would you actually like to see in that role?

Thank you again for another insightful interview on CNN, informative. I as well will go to the polls in November 3rd and vote for Joe Biden. ‚úåÔ∏èüôå‚úäÔ∏è
I really despise Trump. But has anyone else noticed the sheer incoherence of Joe Biden? If he were a republican the media would crucify him.   The next president will be Dumb or Dumber. Can we get a pass? Maybe do the "autonomous collective" thing?
And he wants to attack Biden on eloquence
Biden doesn't need to debate that your daddy is a failure. Your daddy is a failure, Junior.  You of all people should know that.  Bless your heart.
Moot point for me. I will vote for President Trump. If any candidate refuses to debate I will not vote for them. So yes if President Trump canceled the debate then I won‚Äôt vote for him. Never gonna happen. Would love to see President Trump show up, Biden no show Perfect contrast
Junior, your father is the worst president in American history. The Trump name will be forever remembered as the name of grifters, liars and cheats. It already means "fart" in England.   The sooner the SDNY gets a hold of your family the better.   Biden will win in a landslide.
Who is this Biden you speak of i never heard of him
Sanders refused to deliver a career-ending blow to Biden. Sanders is so obsessed about defeating Trump, that calling out a pathological liar on Team Blue was out of the question.
Quite a few of you owe me $50.

We have to keep up work &amp; highlight the dangers of a Biden win. They want us to believe that Biden has an insurmountable lead. It‚Äôs not true.

Hot damn!!  I just got to participate in a poll and was able to proudly say that I M a somewhat liberal independent who is voting for JOE BIDEN!!!
Has it occurred to anyone that if Joe Biden knew who he is and what he claims to stand for, Joe Biden might actually endorse Trump?
Yeah, but neither Trump or Biden will be doing that now or in the future.
Sure thing, Donnie. How's the golf game?  How many more rounds before Biden trounces you in November? Quick, how many Americans died from COVID-19 yesterday? Do you even care?
But Trump would use his time to falsely accused Biden of outrageous made up things.  Biden would spend the night denying etc.  And Trump would make a chunk of watchers believe the lies.
Gal fr my hi schl (Jill WineBanks an IL Biden delegate ;)
Candidates always announce near the convention for a momentum boost &amp; to dominate the news cycle. Great example is McCain‚Äôs Palin announcement. Totally stole the thunder from Obama‚Äôs convention. This is campaigning 101! Announcing earlier could have cost Biden these advantages.
Get your senile candidate out of the basement! üòÅ If you are voting Biden, I would suggest you have your own cognitive skills tested.
The entire time would be spent with Biden being accused of being a child molester etc.  I see no point to Biden trying to defend himself against a new pack of lies
Good. Name her DNC. Biden isn‚Äôt making any decisions these days. He can‚Äôt request catsup with his fries.
Ohh yes that Skunk Biden too, he is part of this whole sweeping theft of Trillions too.
The people who today say that Joe Biden is crushing President Trump are the same people that said #HillaryClinton was on her way to a historic landslide in 2016 (even on Election Day).   Joe Biden is not winning!

I would love to see Biden go at Trump in a real debate. It would be something to see
Let me be honest with you, to begin with, they're not debates at all. They are nothing more than Q and A's. They scrapped debates a long time ago, and replace them with these BS Q&amp;A sessions. I don't see those as being useful for Biden
There's no reason to try to convince people in blue states to vote Biden. And post November, the Democrats will give you something else to work towards instead of what they are doing wrong or how to hold them more accountable. Education not elections.

Almost every option is better than Trump and the Republicans. But the only viable option is Biden and the Democrats. But we need better climate policy, M4A and an end to our endless wars, NSA spying etc. Dems aren't offering that. And they won't till something forces them to.
No it wouldn't damage Biden's chances at all. Nobody expects Trump to stand there and give a truthful answer to anything, so why even have a debate?
50% of eligible voters don't. We actually deserve a dictatorship. Yes, Biden is better than Trump. But please do more to make this democracy work well than beg people to vote blue over red every election.
Former Clinton Press Secretary Joe Lockhart says Biden should skip debates because of Trump's lying. But would that damage his chances?  Biden shouldn't dignify a liar. He should do some town halls.  They go low, we ignore them.
I think if you had a better grasp of economics our GDP wouldn't have contracted by 33% in the last 3 months. How many of your unemployed MAGATs have 401k accounts? You can't predict a market crash. You're not that smart. I think they will soar when Biden takes over.
IIRC, nowhere is it explicitly stated that the Pres Pro Tem must be a Senator. If true, the remaining seated Senators could chose whomever... President Biden? Madame President Clinton? Madame President Obama? That would clear out another seat when Ted Cruz's head explodes.

They have to pick Susan Rice because she has a simple name. Biden will never be able to say ‚ÄúKamala‚Äù right. It will cause too many gaffes.
A reminder: Whenever Joe Biden announces his VP, liberals will be furious it wasn't their first choice, and conservatives will say "Democrats in disarray!" while exaggerating every¬†past blemish on her record.   IGNORE IT. None of it changes how Trump must be defeated.
Your logic is weird, because then Kamala lost to pretty much every candidate, who all lost to Sanders, who only lost because it took everyone dropping out and supporting Biden for him to win  üòÜ Sanders lost and there is no disputing that, but he lost to the DNC not to Biden

Meanwhile your former campaign staffers are begging your followers to not vote Biden on social media.
You have been focused. Focused on Russia. Focused on impeachment. Focused on not having the early travel ban from China. Focused on open borders to let Coronavirus come in from the south. Focused on one thing only. Getting rid of my President. Biden‚Äôs hair plugs look better.
He'll resign with an objective excuse that will protect his ego and hurt Biden.  Something along the lines of "Both Biden and I too old to be running for president in 2020." It would be the perfect opening for Nikki Haley.
He'll resign by stating that both he and Biden are both too old to be running for president.  With no formal convention at this point, the nomination process will have a lot fewer openings for drama.

All that does is concern me who actually is. Who is pulling the strings on the Biden puppet
Why wouldn‚Äôt anyone mention the fact the Joe Biden is named in a criminal investigation in the Ukraine. Why wouldn‚Äôt the Senate want to look into that?and screaming about Biden wanting to hurt the Bible and God.  Ridiculous.
That‚Äôs stupid. Biden and an iguana would work for me.
Donald Trump should not hold his breath waiting for African American voters to swing over to his side.  A recent NBC News/Wall Street Journal Poll showed that Joe Biden has 80% of the African American vote to Donald Trump's 6%.
To anyone that truly thinks Joe Biden is a racist you are an idiot. His comments were misguided and perhaps misspoken. No man cares more about the minority population of this country than Joe Biden. I think we should give him a pass on this one.
GOP will cheat in any way, now they‚Äôre using a mentally ill Kanye West? Why aren‚Äôt the Kardashians protecting him? This is absolutely nuts.
Donald Trump is a desperate, cowardly man. Claiming that Joe Biden would "hurt God" if elected is yet another incendiary statement by Trump. If anyone fits the modern-day definition of Tartuffe, it's Donald Trump.

I agree. Trump who believes in space alien cures and Biden who believes in real science. Trump is a racist pig and Biden is a very decent person.
Biden being close in Kansas means that JoCo is probably close to being a 20 point win for him!  Tell that to a Kansas politico in like 2008 or 2012 and they would be blown away.
This Trump+8/Walz+3 district in the Moorhead area is a pretty good example of a district that Biden probably outperforms Clinton in. A good margin here for Collin Peterson is also key to his re-election.  As for Eken, he should be fine in his re-election bid.
and will vote Biden
I will make sure to use a mask and face shield  and go out and vote for Biden. I am telling everyone I know not to use mail in ballots and use a double mask and take hand sanitizer.  will get away with 150,000 death.

PolitiFact - No, Joe Biden isn‚Äôt 'on board with defunding police'
It is quite obvious that the Left is now trying to garner the religious votes. Today, they claimed that when Trump attacked Biden for being "against God" it was specifically an attack on Catholics. Atheists are against God. So are all attacks against atheism now anti-Catholic?üôÑ
I've personally decided that I'm going to grit my teeth and vote for biden in november specifically because of the threat Trump poses. But I've made videos about this topic in the past.

One good reason for Joe Biden to choose Kamala, is for her to advise Joe, on how to better debate. She can help understand reactions from a woman's point of view, from an African American's point of view
Anyone who has seen Joe Biden in action knows he can't be President, so Trump must win to save this country.
Trump will come up with something worse to say shortly - that‚Äôs what the Biden team is banking on.

I‚Äôm not a Biden fan at all, but I do think it‚Äôs very sad what is happening to him, and that they put it on display like this. This man is obviously declining. His wife should be ashamed for not standing up for him and putting a stop to this. Give the man some dignity.

I honestly do not know why Trump wants to debate Biden What does Trump have to stand on The economy? No His handling of Covid 19 No Trump is hoping to make Biden look stupid It's his ego that's the only reason he wants to debate He really lives in an alternate universe
"Well, if he can't figure out the difference between an elephant and a lion, I don't know what the hell he's talking about," Biden said about Trump.

The historic Democrats are gun owning working class. They are the Trump base. Curious to see how the working class dependent upon hourly jobs will vote since Biden supports keeping them unemployed. As those financial pressures crush this group the votes will shift to Republicans.Your giving Biden too much credit here sir.
How can he get away with this? Its always the same. Biden does not the the Black community can think.. So when does the R word come into play? He does not respIct. (Al) the back people.

Obama would have picked a VP that was a racists? Obama vetted Joe Biden, Barack Obama knew Biden would have been a much needed added value to Obamas legacy. Barack is very smart. He would of never picked a man who lacks integrity with any community.
People say Biden is a racist after yesterday's comments. Well let's put this to rest. Who said black lives matter? Biden. Who has always fought for African American communities? Biden. Who supports peaceful protests? Biden. Biden served with Barack for 8 years do you really think
Did Biden just say that " Black Americans are all the same and have no diversity, unlike Hispanics " who do?   Wholly shit!!! If our president said this, he would be crucified.

Joe Biden is telling the truth about his experience. When he hears someone is from Venezuela or Costa Rica, he sees difference there. He meets a Black person from Dallas or Savannah and he thinks, at most, "Black South." Maybe just "Black." He is admitting to having no depth.

....And came up with her own plan.. Warren cosigned too... and came up with her own plan.  The ACA kicked both their asses via Biden.  Your point is??

i saw a biden sticker on a camry at addison and kimball.  other than that, no.
Only Nancy Pelosi and Joe Biden matters when it comes to plans.. the same way only Obama and Pelosi mattered in 2009.  Biden's plans beat out Sanders and Warren with black voters. It is what it is.
So Mr Biden is going to act like there isn‚Äôt a whole entire African diaspora with diversity a huge diversity of viewpoints!
Kamala and cory knew better. They wasn't expecting Biden to run... they were protecting against Sanders when they didn't need to.
it‚Äôs them being ideologically similar and Biden having a *longer* track record on the wrong side of history for me. they are both terrible options and i‚Äôm unable to pinpoint how the material conditions for Black people will improve under a Biden presidency.
See...Biden is nominee because of stupid shit like this.   That's why Looney left progressive  shit won seven states this time.

Let‚Äôs be clear  comes from a dying era, he‚Äôs 77. It‚Äôs an era of the old Democratic South.   He believes in the inferiority of Black people &amp; the superiority of White people.   Liberals like Biden have retooled this superiority complex &amp; they call it ‚Äúwhite privilege‚Äù.
I think 90% of America is voting for president Trump. But if you turn on your liberal Democratic satanic TV news they're claiming that Joe Biden's doing amazing and beating president Trump. Yeah they're right on one thing he's winning in the dumbest old man on Earth.
He must not be watching Joe Biden. Biden doesn‚Äôt seem to be the least bit mentally compromised. Trump on the other hand.........
Joe Biden has become just another white man on the internet causing a scene for no problem
Biden has the upper hand. He can call the shots when it comes to the debates!

What is the purpose of loweeing the bar?  Except to throw the election to Biden
Biden been taking bs since the beginning
1. Is Joe going to pick a car as his VP  2. Why would you make an electric car go 200mph  3. If you did, why would you let Joe Biden anywhere near it  4. Who is impressed by watching him peel out down a private drive  5. Is this appealing to anyone not already voting for him
Ummm.......  If Biden can see 1976 1996 and 2008 white support in a electorate more diverse than those three I'm happy.  48, 44, and 43 were dems white share in those three wins.
Trump campaign would love that.  The audits were just an excuse years ago &amp; they can continue the lie that their hands are tied. Now they can also say it‚Äôs Biden refusing to debate.
‚ÄúUnless debates are moved before early voting, we won‚Äôt know who these guys are!‚Äù  Biden was only a Senator for 36 years &amp; VP for 8. Not sure who he is.  And Trump hasn‚Äôt released his taxes.  We don‚Äôt know either of these guys!  /s

The cuba and communist stuff is my only concerns with her as that plays BADLY with Brown voters and in Florida.   Other than that no issues with Bass.  If Biden's internals say take a chance, what ever... not my campaign or concerns.  If he loses it won't be because of a VP.
Nothing I mean Nothing you have to say will change my vote for Biden! You need to go now! Right to prison!
He tom Nichols Bret Stephens all used that same line of attack post debate  all republicans.  It was fascinating to watch real time.  The never Trumpers are planning for 2024  (a 81 year old Biden likely loses or doesn't run again) so VP matters to them more than it does to me.
Well he led the charge calling Miami a racial smear on Biden's record the day after the debate.
Yep. They didn't hit Biden nearly as hard as they could have.
Barack Obama rolled Biden out in my state talking about the CRIME BILL.   It didn't hurt him with black voters.
Joe Biden is nominee.  He wrote the crime Bill.  BLACK. PEOPLE.  ARENT. ANTI. POLICE.  WE ARE ANTI  BLANKET POLICING.  We want the same prompt professional policing white people take for granted.  Dems running away from law enforcement is a MISTAKE.   Listen to him.
Joe Biden WINS! üéâ
As long as Biden is above 40 with that bloc that's fine.  1964 was the last time a dem won white voters. We don't NEED to win them... just run better than 2016 with them.
1. Presidential debates a 20th century phenomenon (Nixon-Kennedy first 1960, not consistent til Ford-Carter -1976)  2. Biden could say Trump doesn‚Äôt take virus seriously &amp; not debate in person (Zoom)  3. A debate favors Trump b/c it gives a fallen leader  legitimacy again #AskEx
Independents are not independent. A significant majority have a persistent partisan lean, and the young people who like Sanders and don't like Biden are likely that kind of independent.
They're trying to make this election about Obama, because no matter how much MAGA dislikes Joe Biden, it pales in comparison to their hatred of the Black man who dared be President.

More debates? Biden is winning so hard right now; he doesn‚Äôt have to agree to ANY debates. Biden is the one holding all the cards for the debates right now. All he has to do is sit back and watch Trump humiliate himself.
Guess what? This is all going to be gone when joe Biden gets elected. No more virus wake up people
Good faith Dems who make fun of Mr. Trump's incoherence, irritability, &amp; lack of cognitive function clearly have as little grasp on reality as any Trump true-believer or do not listen to Mr. Biden speak.
Funny, isn't that exactly what #45 was saying the Radical Left is doing with Joe Biden?
Unfortunately for America we have absolutely no way of putting this Virus behind us until the New POTUS ‚ÄúJoe Biden‚Äù is swore into office in 2021. The ‚ÄúJOKER AND THIEF‚Äù that currently holds that job has failed miserably. #‚Äôs will continue to go up and down
Biden should just straight up start saying ‚ÄúMake America great again‚Äù and using the hashtag and not address it in any way
White women voting Republican will be more of a issue.  Black voters are not here to save America from itself.  What white coters need to do is give Biden 40 percent or more support and stop worrying about  Kanye west.

Joe Biden saying we're going to change China's behavior by trading with them. Same pathetic, failed strategy they tried for 35 years. I'm voting Trump.
The left is so disgusting that they are now letting rioting happen just to destabilize the USA. And dementia Joe Biden just said he would take our guns away.

Your kidding, right? Biden hasn‚Äôt had anybody ‚Äùrecovery‚Äù because he hasn‚Äôt been president! And, as others have pointed out, these are just people returning to jobs they already had. And let‚Äôs not forget the 1.2 million new unemployment claims over the last week. Bunch of idiots
Biden won't even commit to correcting cannabis prohibition which has ruined hundreds of thousand of lives and has 80% support from his party.  Simply not being trump isn't good enough.
And Joe Biden is  a lesbian so we all have to pay the price !
I commended the guy, but I literally started out on my first comment by saying Biden has issues and was unsure if he could do the job.  What more do you want?  Why is it so hard for people to be critical of their own parties‚Äô candidate when they have major flaws?
This is a very valid point in that Biden actually apologized , whether it was necessary or not. Biden has tons of issues himself, and I have doubts of his ability to do the job. but humility is important when you‚Äôre a leader. Trump has zero humility.
The Republican Party...  Does not care if doctors and nurses die.  Does not care if essential workers die.  Does not care if old people die.  Does not care if teachers die.  Does not care if your children die.  And does not care about you.  Vote them out.  89 days to go.  #Biden
I have decided that Covid restrictions were all designed to keep Biden away from the public as much as possible.  When restrictions started to ease, Trump did a couple speeches. Biden, I don't think, can stand up to scrutiny,  so we're all back in jail. üôÑ
Oh.  My.  Biden....  Joe's gonna hurt god?  And destroy religion?  A feeble moron may have almost crippled the nation, but it takes a seriously powerful candidate to do all that.  He's got my vote.  #VoteBlueToEndThisNightmare
They're going to pull a bait and switch.  They're using Biden for election, but if, God forbid he got elected,  his DNC picked running mate would be pres. All the more reason to keep President Trump in office.
Peek a Boo! We know why you‚Äôre hidden Biden. ‚ÄúSleepy Joe, come out to plaaaaay!‚Äù
Why is he then pushing it out so late? Biden probably won't even be your nominee

Per the U.S. Constitution, he cannot delay the election! #DicatorTrump is trying to defer and distract the American people from his epic failure of a response to the pandemic with his deployment of federal paramilitary forces into Democratic run cities, and blame Biden and Obama.
How many points do you think Biden's VP choice could swing his current lead over Trump in either direction?  Is 5 % points in play here, given this will likely be the defacto Dem nominee in 2024? #ithinkthatsrightI no longer buy the mental illness angle they are pushing. This is all a marketing ploy from a family of hucksters.
But then by Biden‚Äôs own definition he‚Äôs a racist. Don‚Äôt give him a pass just to be nice.
That Trump believes that Biden could "hurt God" exposes the shallowness, the superficiality, of Trump's own beliefs. Believers in God know that God is stronger than either Biden or Trump.
Biden is portrayed as a familiar face and reliable statesman in contrast with the volatile Trump. In reality, he promises to be the most liberal president in history, writes

We have a big voice to make:  - Biden who may be showing signs of mental decline  OR  - ‚ÄúThighland‚Äù Trump who has proven to be very very dumb   Not an easy choice.....
I'm voting for Biden even if he picks me for VP.
I think Rubio is right and the hearing showed that (outside of Murphy who appears to be allied with the "mesita") but I certainly hope that Guaido and Borges are lobbying Biden's team for repudiation of the December 6th farces.
Evers did a point better in 2018 against Walker. He was able to win the Town of Vienna in northern Dane County. This is a Town that Biden will want to win come November as it would show improvement over Clinton in the rural areas around Madison. 4/5
The sixth region in my Wisconsin breakdown series is my home region, Dane County. There is probably room for Biden to grow here compared to 2016. While not the most Democratic region in the state, this is the most liberal region in the state.  1/5
Bull. He was on track to win the nomination.He swept the early primaries and the DNC panicked &amp; brought out the Big guns (Hillary, etc) to trash him.Biden‚Äôs campaign was broke and in the toilet before Clybourn and SC. Arm twisting to get Amy &amp; Pete to dropout and endorse Joe.
Yeah, there just isn't anyway a black joe biden voter would be enthused about kanye entering the race. Any black vote that kanye gets wasn't voting for Joe anyway.
Well the people who are running his campaign are Republican consultants. If he would just play music and shut up he might poach a few votes from Joe. But he wants to open his mouth so I don't expect him to do well at all. Black joe biden voters are not pivoting to kanye.
People for whom their vote hinges on the VP pick were never serious about voting for Biden anyways. It's a lame excuse. These Republicans in sheep's clothing.

Can Joe Biden make a boulder so heavy that even God can't lift it?
Trump really has a way of making Biden sound like he's a way better candidate than he actually is
Venezuela is still a priority.  And it is Guaido's job to ensure that it is a similar priority if Biden wins.  It is a marathon, not a sprint.

. really needs to know the VP pick though before voting for Biden over Trump.
What Biden said earlier was this: "Oooooooooh. Latino lives matter more than Black lives because there are more of them, just so you know."  My god, we have two racists running for president...
Did Trump and Biden have an in-depth religious discussion where they gave their viewpoints on God and Jesus? It seems one lives the life Jesus preached; the other is the antithesis of anything Jesus stood for.
Biden holds his Bible right-side-up.
Oh yeah, and I think Kamala scares the ever-loving shit out of men. (Which I'm ok with)
Stacey Abrams has NO federal governing/foreign policy experience. To put her in line behind an aged (probably 1 term) Biden doesn't seem like the best choice.   Kamala - is a solid choice now. But has some issues with black vote.
Trump: "Biden is against God." Biden: "Sorry I didn't immediately respond to our lying, misleading Tweet.  I just returned from Church." Trump: "Hush, this is an important putt!"
Ideally Biden and his team will come up with a better strategy to help pressure Maduro for a negotiated electoral solution.  But the concern is that they listen to false opposition influencers and support Fal$on and other Maduro pawns to help shore up Maduro's dictatorship.
Dude check my feed. Look at how people is upset at what Biden said but was like fuck it compare to trump. Feel free to she how the 98% live
Why do you post these inane headlines? This is not news. You are spreading falsehoods. Have you covered whether Trump has ever been known to be a church member or church-goer during his adult life? Biden has been a devout Catholic his entire life.
Biden is ‚Äúagainst God‚Äù and he is going to ‚Äúhurt The Bible.‚Äù This from a guy who broke 78 of the 10 Commandments.
So what do you want to do, burn the state?  At least President Trump can find Ohio.  Where's O'biden?  Obama speaks for Biden, Jill speaks for Biden, but Biden never speaks?  Takes no candid questions, only responds to specific journalists, when he knows the question &amp; answer.
Biden is objectively better than Trump. Biden can pick a toaster as his running-mate and I‚Äôd still vote for him. #LincolnVoter
True.  Guaido should spend his time lobbying Biden now on Venezuela.
Kevin McCarthy? Devin Nunes? And prop 187 fucked them. Then Arnold came and he didn't do them any favors. But luckily people like me have a love of old white dudes like Jerry brown and Joe Biden.
As for Bolton, I do not care as I think Biden will likely win.  This is why I am interested in Biden's advisor's thoughts on the subject and hope he will repudiate farce elections and the mesita and reaffirm support for Guaido.
What you fail to forget republicans are given a chance every year. Shit there was an entire group willing to vote for him. But he kept being racist and he lost them. And they hate Biden too.
Watch what happened at 0:28 in ‚Å¶ broadcast: "Biden Racism, DNC Secret Weapon? Jobs Report, ObamaGate and more!" w/ Author Brenden Dilley #TheDilleyShow
Oh Biden is a white moderate. But I find it funny trumpkins pointing out when racist runs deep in their little crew.
The part where you won't say that you'll vote for Biden, as opposed to not voting at all or voting for Kanye.
No, not illegal at all. Completely disengenuous. From a racist mind set. And motivated by a desire to pull voters in key states from Biden.  It's gonna fail just like everything else Trump and his people try. But, we gotta fight like they are gonna win to make sure.
And what do you mean by creative?  Surely you do not think that Biden should throw Guaido under the bus and endorse fake parliamentary elections with the mesita.  Because that seems to be what you are insinuating.
A true election could be used by Guaido, LeLo, etc. to generate political change.  But to get that right now diplomacy and sanctions are needed.  And outright condemnation of any farce elections and sanctions against the mesita.  It is crucial that Biden support the last point.
Banned yet from Twitter today? Doctor any pictures of Biden yet today?  Play any golf today yet? Mislead Americans today yet about the seriousness of the pandemic? Wait, I guess it‚Äôs still early to do all four yet. I will give you a couple hours to comment about TV ratings.
Biden knows how to interpret pandemic charts without help from journalists. Trump‚Äôs constant, chronic lying and rambling, incoherent statements shows that he has no brain capacity.
Biden would have saved over 160,000 American lives.

trump is manipulating and burying things and classifying things and hiding things so he can cheat his way to the very end of his term.  Then... we're gonna get him.  Cannot wait.  And Biden will NOT pardon him.

If a reporter asking Joe Biden about taking a cognitive test is not telling enough, Biden‚Äôs angry and inappropriate response appears to validate the concern about his deteriorating cognitive function. Sad but his diehard followers will remain in denial.
The article wasn't "Biden faces crowd during public speech," it was refuting frequently-shared misinformation. Especially after the 2016 election and all the misinformation leading up to it, that actually seems kind of important.
The Onion character is great.  I want the Onion Biden as President.
I agree.  You have to be naive to think that Maduro will give up power.  He did not after the elections that Biden insisted on in 2015.  I certainly hope that Biden supports Guaido fully rather than the mesita and Fal$on.
Does Biden even have values besides orange man bad and beat trump? Nope
Personalities matter when it comes to elections.  Sorry WOLA, Murphy, and sadly the Biden campaign..  but Venezuela is not going to vote for the crap the mesita shovels out.  Also, why can't Biden firmly endorse Guaido, reject fake elections, and reject the mesita.
Perhaps Biden could come out and repudiate the farces in December and also reject the mesita and ask for sanctions against them.
Biden speaks coherently. Trump flails his hands, rocks back and forth and babbles and rambles. Not only does he lie, he makes up crazy, illogical nonsense. He can't read either. An intelligent President is a good thing.
Biden is not trying to kill us- or take our health insurance away.
Biden may be the majority choice in America, but Trump and his thugs are trying every possible corrupt tactic from cutting off the census, re-drawing district lines, stifling  the US Mail and intimidating voters. Trump wants total autocracy and he‚Äôll cheat to get it.
Unfortunately some on the left, namely WOLA and a few US Senators (cough: Murphy: cough) are using Guaido as a pawn for their political/ ideology fights in the same way they accuse Trump of doing.  Which is why Biden should ignore them at all costs.
Robin Williams summarizes perfectly Joe Biden‚Äôs character in this clip.
He‚Äôs ok. He‚Äôs Joe Biden. Lol
Then why say he must be defeated? You defeat by voting for the viable contender. Not voting or writing in is a vote for the orange shit gibbon. Steele is a repugnicon enabler that resulted in the election of the shit gibbon. He needs to own it and back Biden.

They all went rogue!  Obama, Biden, Yates, Clapper, Brennan, Comey, Rosenstein, McCabe &amp; Stroyk.  This is the darkest period in American history, a single party corrupted our justice dept &amp; our election system. Sally Yates just testified, Trump was undercutting Obama policies?
Jill Biden appeared on Fox.  She wanted us to know, that "Joe is still the most moderate Democrat, but that's not to say, he's not Progressive?"  Dah!  She can't tell the difference.  Why are Jill &amp; Obama speaking for Joe?  Don't let this cadaver get away w/o debate!  #Hollowman
Exactly. I'm tired of hearing about it. The DNC are really ticking me off lately. Biden can't pick anybody that doesn't have "baggage." If not, &amp; the perfect running mate is out there, Trump's goons will just make something up anyway.
If Biden does not say that, how can Trump hear it?? Unless, of course, he's lying. Again.
Die-hard Democrats I know are fed up about the prospect of Biden, and holding their nose; they must feel at least a little like the 2016 GOP felt: "We had 15 legitimate candidates with at least as much to offer as the next, and...THIS is who we're rallying behind?"
Does Joe Biden‚Äôs wife hate him? How do you let your spouse who‚Äôs clearly suffering from dementia continue to go out and do this?
Biden's lone selling point: "He's not Trump."  Meanwhile, the Dems have failed to #OwnTheNarrative around anything related to policy, in no small part because their candidate seems to be locked in a basement 24/7, only to come up for air and yell "Come on, man!"
Neat.  So Trump can arrest Biden and outlaw the Democratic party and claim popular mandate.  Because that is how Maduro "won" in 2018.  And I'm not sure when we recognized Guaido before any election.  He was recognized in 2019.
Great.  So what is Biden going to do to get rid of Maduro?  We cannot even get Biden to condemn the fake "elections" in December.
üëÄ at the Biden number
Could you tell me how Biden would do or could have done better?? Or is anyone better?? In this case could we vote for my aunt Betty for president??? Thank you
Both candidates will use that as a campaign vid:  In Trump's America, this is what happens. In Biden's America, this is what happens.  #kang2020
They won‚Äôt make sense when Biden starts to speak.
It only matters because JG needs to somehow ensure continued support both from Biden and the EU.
Revolutionary Communist Party USA leader endorses Biden, warns followers against 'protest vote'  #FoxNews
Is this the new Biden campaign slogan?
Your are confusing Joe Biden with Donald Trump.  ü§£ü§£
It is as childish as Trump's outbursts for Murphy to have foreign policy views based on hating foreign leaders/ oppositions like Guaido just because they are currently allied with Trump.  Hopefully, Biden is more mature than this.
We will because Biden will be President.  üòÅ
No.  What you need is to stick with what Guaido has done so far and the support he has, pressure Biden and the EU to reject any "elections," and see if a savvier US administration headed by realpolitik 1990s/ 2000s Biden, not Obama flunkie Biden, can get a negotiated solution.
No...  Guaido should continue fighting this year and into next year.  He should be working to get continued recognition from Biden/ EU in 2021.  The only way is a negotiated solution and a transitional government.  There will be no more elections in Venezuela.
This election is between trump and Biden. Not Hillary, Obamam or Pelosi.   We've seen what Biden did as VP for eight years. We've seen what trump has NOT done in the past nearly 4 years. Before this country is destroyed, we must make a choice.  I've made mine.
Still trying to figure out what Joe Biden would actually DO to stop the virus, and why we haven't heard about it til now.  I mean, aside from the things that would be shot down by the Supreme Court, like a national mask mandate.
They couldn't participate with their parties or candidates.  That is why they boycotted.  But I guess you would consider it free and fair if Trump ordered Biden arrested...
The most important issue facing the world in coming years is the rapidly deteriorating relationship between China and the U.S., yet it gets little campaign attention.
No one in the US would accept Trump "winning" an election after arresting Biden, ordering Roberts to steal the Democratic Party, and selecting Ted Cruz as the "opposition candidate."  Yet, the same people are okay with this happening in Venezuela because..  Che cosplay revolution
That is why Eli Lake suggested that Biden reject the farce elections now and endorse Guaido firmly.  This would put any doubts to rest.  Murphy's mesita aligned views are concerning given that he is supposedly an "establishment Democrat."
No they couldn't.  The puppet electoral committee barred the main parties AD, PJ, UNT, and VP from participating in 2018.  AD is basically the "Democratic Party" of Venezuela, so this would be like the FEC banning Biden from getting on the ballot.
Biden and the Democrats should be encouraged wholeheartedly to ignore anything that comes out of Murphy's mouth on Venezuela.  The latest of which appears to be lobbying for the US (aka Biden) to recognize the farce elections in December.
She just admitted they are moving his platform. I hope all you middle of the road dems are listening. Biden is not in control of this . #Trump2020Landslide
The parties couldn't participate in the election - the four main ones AD, PJ, VP, and UNT - nor could the strongest candidates who were either in prison (Lopez) or barred from running for office (Capriles.)  But I guess you'd be okay with Trump arresting Biden.
So in the not too distant future (Friday) I get to interview the author of this piece --  -- for a "show" (podcast? interview? YouTube thing?) that will be posted (hopefully) over the weekend.  CC
Biden backer.
We're not totally splitting hairs here:  said that Joe Biden's quest to find a female running mate is "illegal."  And it probably is.
I believe that despite these ‚Äògood‚Äô polls for Biden, 95% of folks are VERY wary and cautious and will absolutely  vote.  People realize we are fighting a malevolent and evil man that needs to be defeated  with an overwhelming landslide.
#AxiosOnHBO interview is shocking but this is worse. Like #coronavirus, #Trump will not just go away! We have to #VOTE. Doesn‚Äôt matter how many polls you pick #Biden in, you can‚Äôt vote if don‚Äôt #RegisterToVote2020, and we won‚Äôt win with fewer voters. #VoteBlueToEndThisNightmare
What‚Äôs funny is that his campaign right now is actively setting expectations for Biden so incredibly low and for him incredibly high for the debates. And when they actually look like... this? ooof
R U N! Now her and Biden does not govern their own ship..... üò±You don‚Äôt get that high in life not unless you have broken some eggs,ü§î killed, stabbed,molested  oh and need a few politicians to get the okey! Zoning! üëÅüëÅ
At no point during the campaign did Biden -- or any other Democratic leader -- pick up the phone (or send a tweet), call Trump and ask "Mr. President, how can I help stop the virus?"  It was -- and still is -- about playing politics. There was no silver bullet. Scott's right.
Whatever you think of Biden, even if you think he's senile, he's 100% not actively maliciously senile, and frankly I prefer to live the next four years of my life without being ruled by active, actual malice.
Karen Bass is basically Sarah Palin 2.0, isn't she?  The dumb thing is that McCain needed a Hail Mary pass in 2008; I'm not sure what Biden who is way ahead thinks he is gaining with having this controversy.
How did I miss this...
I'd vote for kanyes big toe over Biden.
I continues to astound me that you can critique Biden on gaffes that just actually pale in comparison to your Feckless Leader‚Äôs daily verbal garbage spew. It‚Äôs like you‚Äôre completely unaware. Willful ignorance or blind adoration... you‚Äôre in a cult.
This is how Biden loses Wisconsin.

Biden is Glinda. Bernie is probably Elphaba.
Here it is.
Not sure if you saw Eli Lake's editorial encouraging Biden to reject the AN "elections."  That may have an effect.
Yep.  Biden policy advisors constantly r/t WOLA.  Although I don't know why it doesn't happen to be honest, all that is being asked of him is to condemn fake elections that the opposition cannot participate in.
And they talk about Hunter Biden? Trump‚Äôs team are all insider traders- including their families.
This is good news, even though it should have been done months ago. While Trump tries to drag Biden and his son through the mud, this would be a really good time to have some hearing about Pompeo and his wife using the State Department for his own political benefit.  Let's do it!
No.  Lake is saying that Biden should condemn the fake parliamentary elections.
Excellent opinion piece by Eli Lake and I agree with the sentiment 100%.  A statement by Biden rejecting any "fake parliamentary elections" even as a candidate will do a lot to help Guaido and the opposition.  I'd also add that he should condemn the "mesita."
This election cycle is very weird. We don't even know who Biden's vp is. Will there be any debates? I think biden should hold out for no taxes no debates. The Republican convention is closed to press. Just a very odd presidential election.
Bill Clinton is not running‚Äîit should have NO BEARING ON BIDEN WHATSOEVER. If he is guilty of sleeping with Epstein‚Äôs young girls then he should pay.
Yeah, don't want a senile old man on stage. On the lying part, Biden could hold his own with Trump
But we have clear basis to know how Biden will treat his VP. Just look at his role with Obama. It‚Äôs clear he wants a rock-solid partner as VP. That‚Äôs Harris.
This is a good theory and I certainly hope that this is right.  It's baffling that Biden would keep someone as far left as Bass on his short list.  The Cuba stuff alone should be a disqualifier.  Maybe it is a bone to the Bernie base.
That seems weird given that Biden has a perfectly boring and normal choice - Kamala Harris - who won't raise that much controversy IMO and checks the dumb diversity boxes that he put himself into.
Bass is so far left that it is baffling that she is getting any additional ink from the Biden campaign.  They probably signed away Florida if Biden picks her based on the Castro stuff (as well as the Venezuela stuff that hasn't been picked up yet by the media.)
Democrats are in the grip of Socialist/Marxists.  Democrats nominated Biden, but they are getting Bernie Sanders. AOC, Obama, &amp; Beto.   This is bait &amp; switch.  America would never vote for Marxism or Socialism, so they are riding into office in a Trojan Horse; Joe!
Same to you. Trump actually is doing great campaign for Biden. üòÇ
Biden is incapable and incapacitated.
I do not like Trump but I am mostly concerned about policy to Venezuela.  Right now, there are tough sanctions on Venezuela, which I fear will be removed and Maduro allowed to execute Guaido and the opposition by Biden.
Totally misleading statement from a diehard Democrats. Anyone supporting and voting for an old demented fart, Joe Biden for president should have his head examined. Furthermore, the Democrats have turned communists.
Nobody can really hate Joe Biden.

Black people know. Why do you think we pushed so hard for Biden? I love him and he's palatable to white vote.
Do you have any thoughts on the subject?  Because I know people who have friends in Venezuela who may be tortured to death if Biden wins and sells out Guaido, so this concerns me personally.
If we elect Joe Biden, we‚Äôll have an actual normal person running the country, not an insane clown and his insane walking colostomy bag offspring and their crap spouses who don‚Äôt even qualify for security clearance. Thank you for playing. Sit down. (In prison, where you belong.)
But, that is exactly the democratic appeal. We often act in unexpected circumstances that we should act with what has changed. But, the truth is Biden won, because he is the safe choice. His current appeal is normalcy, and the ability to bring normal back. That is his story.

Have we seen Biden‚Äôs?
I‚Äôm waiting on the Biden pics lmao
Honestly isn't the only viable strategy for Biden for him to stay out of the public and not be heard saying anything?
I'd say a 1.2% margin is pretty close.  Again, before you enter the "but 2016" retort, my argument wasn't about the accuracy of the polls, it was simply saying that if the margin in Iowa IS that close, those other states are easily carried by Biden.
That's like saying in 2016-ish that Virginia wasn't a blue state, since Bush won it twice.  Iowa is extremely red demographically.  But I'll clarify.  Iowa is definitely on the red side of the tipping point state.  If Iowa is close, PA/WI/MI will easily be carried by Biden.
Do you honestly think black lives matter to Biden? If so how come the 8 years he was in office, he did nothing.He thinks blacks owe him, for what? Just compare facts &amp; actions, you will see Trump has done more in 3years than Biden in 40.
Iowa is a red state.  If this state is this close in November Biden is easily carrying WI/MI/PA and maybe OH too.

Well the people who are running his campaign are Republican consultants. If he would just play music and shut up he might poach a few votes from Joe. But he wants to open his mouth so I don't expect him to do well at all. Black joe biden voters are not pivoting to kanye.

These tweets didn't age very well, Donnie.  2020 isn't going so well. And we'll both know what that means...  A landslide win for Joe Biden!  Lots of people will vote for him. You should too!
A man that for decades refused to rent to Blacks &amp; created a corporate culture that made sure no one working for him would rent a Trump property to a Black person is? How are you, a person that had to be forced by the federal government to stop this practice, better then Biden?
Only Joe Biden has that power
Biden is not apologizing. He‚Äôs countering the accusations made by Trump. It‚Äôs Trump who should apologize for his remarks toward Biden. Shameful and disgusting.
Biden‚Äôs campaign advertising war chest is $100 billion of free ‚ÄúTrump is responsible for Coronavirus‚Äù every day until Nov. 3 by MSM. You but it you are one dumb ass:
If you elect Biden you will have $10 gasoline and won‚Äôt be able to blame the oil companies this time. You did it.
Biden trashes blacks. Media says it's OK, its just because he has Alzheimer's.  Give him the nuclear keys.
You got all that out of a tweet? Wow..all he was doing is pointing out Biden‚Äôs racism. The MSM won‚Äôt even cover these things.
Biden has mastered the art of culling his voting block.  #BidenIsARacist  #Biden2020
Thank you!! This is not being  discussed  enough. When he projects his mental decline on Biden, just throw it right back at him. He can barely stand straight or walk at times
So...where‚Äôs Trump‚Äôs statement of faith then? Perhaps too written by his staff? Even if it was written by his staff (which I doubt), the fact that Biden CARES enough about his faith to actually have his staff write &amp; approve this document is proof of where his values lie.
Not Joe Biden. Joe would have said month not monolith. He had a hard time reading the note cards now.
Biden announced that he looks forward to debating Trump - I'd like to see the follow through on that.
In any given debate, Joe Biden doesn‚Äôt have to say a word.  He just needs to stand there looking presidential while Trump opens his mouth, puts both feet in and confirms what an ignoramus he is!!
If you don‚Äôt recognize Biden is in the latter stages of Alzheimer‚Äôs you may need to take a cognitive test.
And that Biden....a gifted orator right there right?
Donald Trump said Joe Biden wants to: "Hurt the bible, hurt God. He's against God..."  A guy who gassed protestors to use the bible and a church as props in a photo op said this.  Am I missing something?
Is there a church near by for Trump to go to? If he thinks Biden is hurting God then he should offer his prayers to ‚Äòhelp‚Äô God.
This epitomizes the GOP in the era of Trump. Trump, speaking of Biden, "He's against God. He's against guns." Only now would those two sentences be conjoined in this way.
Keep up with your faith President Biden, God is still in control.
You mean Biden‚Äôs handlers didn‚Äôt apologize...Biden was busy drooling on pillow
Why lie about it. Our 2 amendment rights not going anywhere.  Joe Biden just want assault guns to go away along with you. We all want you to go away! NRA are thieves like you. They just need to give up the non profit status. They are stealing &amp; not pay their fair share of taxes
Once again, Trump is calling himself God!
Biden signs are in his basement where he misplaced them. May never see him or the signs. But polls will show him ahead assuring no Democrats go to the polls.

It was 58% of white people in 2016. 50% is an improvement, and it tracks with Biden doing 8% better than Hillary
In light of Biden's stutter, I was going to give him a break, but then I remembered that he mocked a disabled reporter, so no. Shitheads who live in glass houses, etc.
It was a dementia test! We only give those to patients that we suspect may have dementia. The vast majority of my patients never receive a test for dementia, because they show no signs of dementia-just like Joe Biden.
You would think the Christians who reject everything Jesus taught would understand how this works...  Just because Biden doesn't agree with the Vatican doesn't mean he's not Catholic. By that standard, most Catholics aren't "real" Catholic. If you believe that, just say that.
Trump Campaign Busted For Deceptively Manipulating Biden Photos In New Ad #SmartNews
Biden could BE a kitchen blender and he'd have my vote
I also assume that any politician that has been in the public eye has baggage. Part of Biden‚Äôs decision process is to determine which baggage is manageable and which is an automatic knockout (I‚Äôm looking at you Church of Scientology)
Go by the poles and you will lose by the corrupt poles, no way Trump is behind Biden.  Maybe his dementia has influenced his followers minds
Anti-Trump Republicans who cannot bring themselves to vote for Biden always sound like idiots.  ‚ÄúLike yeah Trump is a racist wannabe dictator but Joe Biden supports a different tax bracket then me so these issues are equally bad for me.‚Äù

Biden didn't destroy the NRA when he was Vice President for 8 years, Donnie.  Neither did Obama. In other, far more accurate words,        STOP GASLIGHTING!
Apparently Donald believes that Joe Biden can hurt God.
Does Donald think Joe Biden can hurt God?
"We all know Biden is the lesser evil"  Hoo boy, I would suggest wading into some progressive anger Twitter threads and see if they feel the same way.
You don't have to, but as the only two realistic options for next POTUS are Biden or Trump, a vote for neither functions as if you prefer both of them to an equal degree, which I find hard to believe to be true for almost every voter.
When Biden speaks, stupid comes out.

No, don‚Äôt vote for Kanye.  Voting for Kanye is exactly what Trump wants you to do, as it takes votes away from Biden.
Lol... please. Easiest way to beat trump will be to keep putting him on the air.  Literally the biggest horse‚Äôs ass ever elected. Dude, YOU‚ÄôRE probably smarter than he is.  Biden is up 8% in most polls.  Debates are only going to help him.  Your boy is done.
I hope Biden asks Trump to cite a bible passage that‚Äôs meaningful for him during the debate...and doesn‚Äôt allow him to sidestep by claiming it‚Äôs ‚Äúvery personal.‚Äù Trump is a gigantic fraud.
Person. Woman. Man. Camera. TV. but...sure, Joe Biden.
I hope it is the first thing to come down when Biden takes office. To me this act at the White house set the tone for much of what is going on. It is SHAMEFUL!
I am looking into early voting also. My dad voted for tRump on 2016 he is voting Biden but still is afraid of mail in voting. He has always voted at the polls (some things I can't changeüôÑ) so my friend and I thought of early voting make a day of it lunch ect...think it will fly

Rumors are that Michelle Obama will be Biden‚Äôs VP choice. She announced today she is suffering a mild case of depression. Ticket could use a head case since Biden has none.

Biden literally, LITERALLY, can‚Äôt talk for more than two straight sentences without almost mentally collapsing.
That Joe Biden??? üòÇ
Not sure if that polling from late May still holds up, but it doesn't seem like that would be the case.
This is why he‚Äôs not going to Milwaukee. He can‚Äôt handle live events - If he doesn‚Äôt go, his nomination acceptance can be pre-recorded, rehearsed and edited to make him look cognitively intact. Trump is going to destroy him in a debate without even trying. Biden fails after 5 min

Biden has had a slight stuttering problem his whole life. Has absolutely nothing to do with his intelligence. Come up with something new Jr.
What about this, Donnie? Is this Biden's fault too?  Pfft.
I think the danger is the unhinged left which will be the puppet master behind Biden. They were burning Bibles, like the Nazis they claim to hate. People who burn books often burn people attached to them.
Biden asked a black reporter if he took a test for cocaine. Biden is sadly suffering some kind of intellectual decline or he‚Äôs a racist. Either way, I‚Äôm voting #Trump2020
Biden‚Äôs supporters are peppered with anti-semites, fascists and communists bent on destroying this country. Quit pretending otherwise
It's not a stupid question because I think Biden is in cognitive decline and this proves even more.
you know, i hear biden has some bad experience with dogs
Floriduh also apparently welcomed COVID-19 to Floriduh. Faith in Trump/Pence has been virtually eliminated.  Vote for Joe Biden on November 3.
This may have been missed but I'm no Biden champion.  If this was a parliamentary-style vote I'd be voting differently.  So I'm going the lesser of two evils route.  I think Trump has damaged our system and our political way in a uniquely dangerous way.
So you love all the followers of your ideal candidate?  Hell, a lot of Bernie fans (if you don't want the "bros") aren't even listening to him when he's saying to vote for Biden.
Genuine question -- what's the play by voting Green Party?  What do you hope to achieve?  As a comparison point, what I hope to achieve by voting for Biden is to make Donald Trump no longer be president.
Biden would be a sucker to debate or campaign. We get in front of the burning Hindenburg?
I cannot believe how stupid and ignorant Trump is!!  Can‚Äôt imagine someone as intelligent as Obama ever having a conversation with him!!  Think Joe Biden will chew him up and spit him out in a debate!!
The relationship between the Green Party and Dems is closer than Green Party and GOP.  If someone was 0% likely to vote for Trump and 1% likely to vote for Biden/whatever Dem, the Green Party vote costs the Dem, not Trump.
I plan on it!  Thanks why I'm voting for Joe Biden. You should too, Donnie!  Make America Great Again - Vote for Biden!
Yep.  Note that we're not sitting here championing Biden or this system.  We're just saying he sucks less and sometimes that's important, especially right now.  And yes, Trump is way worse than GWB or any of the others.
Biden is running on the most progressive platform for a nominee in some time, certainly moreso than Hillary's campaign.  Think that all just comes from within him?
DNC has some work to do . Renounce Joe Biden .
I voted for Bernie in the primary.  He lost, I accepted it, and I'm voting for the best remaining option.  I don't know why all the Bernie Bros feel the need to keep crying on Twitter.  Vote a progressive into office in your district to influence Biden.  This isn't hard.
I'm being dumb and letting myself get Mad Online about "Biden and Trump are the same" people.  COVID management.  Supreme Court nomination.  Even at least fathoming a public health care option.  If none of this convinces you then vote progressive for Congress and Biden for POTUS.
OMG.  This is absurd.  Look at what's happened with freaking COVID.  Americans aren't allowed to travel to 95% of the world because our pandemic has been so mismanaged.  No one is claiming that Biden is amazing.  But the "same as Trump" stuff is willful ignorance at best.
Genuine question -- what's your opinion of the Supreme Court in all of this?  Are you indifferent as to whether Joe Biden or Donald Trump nominates the next Supreme Court justice to very likely replace RBG?
I think Biden has already committed to a black woman as running mate.
And the Trump campaign, especially tries to say Joe Biden has dementia?? Biden may be old, look old, but when he speaks he is strong, alert and memes incredible sense. He gives off an aura of being powerful and in charge! Trump looks like the village idiot!!
Biden a Marxist? Where do you get that view? I cannot think of one policy position he holds that even slightly hints of Marxism. Can you point to even one?
Of course Biden‚Äôs health etc., should be examined as should Trump‚Äôs. Biden is older than I‚Äôd like him, but Trump is just a few years back of him.
Everything Biden has done he takes responsibility for. A lot of good but also some bad.   As for Trump....
I can‚Äôt speak on things I haven‚Äôt seen, but I‚Äôve have noticed Fox using footage of Biden consoling his grandchildren at his son‚Äôs funeral and describing it as ‚Äúgroping‚Äù. But that‚Äôs Fox for you.
There‚Äôs nothing wrong with Biden. His issue is on occasion is the stutter he‚Äôs had since childhood comes up. This is what Republicans cruelly and deliberately say is dementia. Meanwhile Trump slurs his words and reads at a second grade level.
You are a sell out! Biden will finish the distruction Barry started! It will be Obama 2.0

Actually, Joe Biden is pretty straight forward with the American Peiple.  is the sham and people are beginning to see that he is ‚Äúthe Emperor who has no clothes!‚Äù STFU, Eric!!
America watched the Jonathon Swan/Axios interview. If you think that babbling parent of yours, with his pathetic stack of charts, would be any match for Joe Biden in a moderated debate you are as deluded as he is. All Biden has to do is sit back, wait, &amp; watch trump implode.

Let me see... do those letters stand for "asshole" and "Biden" by any chance?
Economic success? Thanks to him, Biden‚Äôs going to inherit a country in the midst of the worst recession since George Bush passed his on to Obama. But like Obama, Biden will bring the economy back to life so the next Republican can take the credit like Trump did.
Mr. Biden is under no obligation to debate someone who has no compunction about lying.

Biden doesn't need to debate that your daddy is a failure. Your daddy is a failure, Junior.  You of all people should know that.  Bless your heart.
Junior, your father is the worst president in American history. The Trump name will be forever remembered as the name of grifters, liars and cheats. It already means "fart" in England.   The sooner the SDNY gets a hold of your family the better.   Biden will win in a landslide.
Biden would have a better chance then.

One thing both parties have in common is this same argument about 3rd parties. If the amount of people that dislike Trump and Biden were to vote 3rd party, there would be history made.
Hi! Did you know Biden had 2 big surgeries for aneurisms?? To get to the aneurism you have to amplify the brain, which has residual effects. Thus the reason for the deer in the headlights look. Do you have his medical records??
Ok Biden will not win...not even close
We need a Joe Biden presidency!
White voters need to be responsible and deliver at least 45%. A lot easier than convincing African Americans that an old white guy is the solution. African Americans have legitimate reasons to not like Biden.
Playing electoral defense, Trump claims Biden opposes God
And honestly there are better parties to push to that 3rd slot than the Green Party. We shouldn‚Äôt coalesce around a party just because it isn‚Äôt Rep/Dem. it‚Äôs the same logic of voting for Biden by virtue of not being Trump 2/2
Had been wanting a debate prior to early voting.
No..Trump in artful as usual.  You can say that Biden absolutely does not support policies that are in alignment with Evangelical  Christians.  He is absolutely a finger in the wind guy.
We'll be careful... Republicans say the same thing when they only get 8% of the Black vote.  Maybe Biden is right on this...he is the beneficiary of the group think.

Trump, Who Once Declined to Name His Favorite Bible Verse, Accuses Biden of Being ‚ÄòAgainst God‚Äô  via
Don't put words in VP Biden's mouth, Ken.  He said that "If you're confused about who to vote for, you ain't black."  That's not an insult. It says blacks aren't fooled, or confused. They're decisive. It says NOTHING about who they'll vote for.  Are you claiming they're confused?
Be careful of what you ask for, Biden has a brain and he‚Äôs not afraid to use, also he can pronounce big words like Yosemite!
Which is why so many of us who were born are voting for Joe Biden.  As are the women who aren't buying this pack of lies. White megachurch Evangelicals have been duped by the sanctimonious GOP since Pat Robertson called President Eisenhower a "communist".
Another Republican Never-Trumper decides to waste her vote in defiance of the inevitable.  This is no longer about right versus left.  Let's hope others see her position for the abdication of civic duty that it is.

Mr. Kass.  Your column should go national.  Other than Kim Strassel and a few other WSJ writers, the press is all aboard the Joe Biden election train, even though he is hiding in the caboose somewhere.
After Trump loses, do you turn the machine around and attack Biden? Just curious.
Biden already released his tax returns I heard. Trump needs to release his but we know he won't.

Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden will not travel to Milwaukee to accept his party's White House nomination because of concerns over the coronavirus.
WASHINGTON (AP) - AP source: Biden will not travel to Milwaukee to accept Democratic presidential nomination.
None of that will happen, but thanks, we will vote for Joe Biden.
There are a lot of trolls whining about Biden, even though no matter how bad he is as president, it's impossible for him to be as reckless, stupid, dangerous and criminal as POUTS.  The Kremlin pays a lot of them.
Apart from the appalling lack of awareness that 7 Trump cronies have been convicted or pleaded guilty, Stepien doesn't know Biden shepherded the Affordable Care Act proposal through Congress. Pretending he's an "empty vessel" is naive, bordering on stupid.
He just doesn't get being President.  But, I will have to vote for him over the Biden, Pelosi, Schumer leftist mob.
Oh they will gear up to be major dicks complaining and outraged about everything Biden will do
If Israel's accusations are true, this looks like Biden vs. Trump.  Two horrible choices.  Israel proved his incompetence in the school shooting case...before and during.  He should not be reelected.
If true, not only sad for Biden but what about all those democratic puppet masters behind the scenes with personal agendas that would be taking control!
Mr. mass incarceration himself.  Mr. eternal student loans.  Mr. more-billionaires-support-him-than-Trump.  I mean Biden, of course.  The only difference between Biden and Trump is that Trump is a little more forthright in his desire to immiserate as many people as possible.
Ms. Harris had a single black mother arrested and perp-walked in front of the media for missing too many days of school due to sickle cell.  This is not sexism, it's the truth. And I will not vote if Biden chooses her....PERIOD!

Just saw 16 Shots, and DEMOCRATS aided in the year long coverup of the slaughter of Laquon McDonald. They did this to cover for Rahm Emanuel.  I can't vote for a Republican and now that this came to my attention I with NOT vote for Biden!
Put them in sound booths with mics that can be turned off when it's not their turn to speak, and turned down when they shout.  That shuts down any silly shenanigans by POUTS, like onstage stalking, shouting, and interruptions.  Also deduct points for lies.
That's cute you think anything would get BETTER with Biden in office.  There's no difference between Biden and Trump.
That said, if she did end up being Biden's VP pick, it wouldn't be a bad idea.  But I seriously think she doesn't have time what with Jason Mamoa being married to her.  Just saying.  Which would you choose?
At this point come November, the only question will be is how big of a margin will Biden will have won by?
I saw Lisa Bonet was trending and wondered why.   For a second I thought she'd been picked to be Biden's VP.  Turns out it's just because she class above and beyond nearly everything walking on two or four legs.  So, you know.... Saturday.
I have a prediction I will vote for a dead cat in a dress before I vote for Biden... Fck the DNC
Couldn't agree less.  Bernie Sanders fans allowed Trump to win the presidency with their protest votes and abdication of responsibility.  If they're foolish enough to be willing to let him stay there, it doesn't matter what Biden says or does.
Biden was not my first choice either. But the extreme left was not chosen in Biden as the extreme right was chosen with trump. The electoral college was setup to keep people like trump from becoming president. The framers of the Constitution foresaw this  type of situation.

I am looking at the silver lining today is that Warren is not looking like the pick. But on this story, I agree that all this flack on Kamala may be a good sign as the anti forces are not convincing Biden directly.
Just in time for the weekend talk shows to line up the strongest guests, and for both sides to prepare their most cogent arguments. Expect a Republican 5-Jordan circus.  Plus more tweeted threats, a hoax about Biden and a gift to Putin.
Better to die free than live under the democrat killing machine, I wish to go out like Herman instead of living in a  Biden/AOC/Soros controlled future.
They‚Äôre always trying to move goal posts. Biden was a Vice President who‚Äôs running for President and they don‚Äôt see or care about how they‚Äôre framing the discussion

The news here is that POUTS is conserving campaign funds to defend Nevada and Iowa, normally stalwart Republican states.  His campaign is in deep, deep trouble, and he knows it.  (He's also planning to embezzle as much of the campaign money as he can.)Debating tRUMP is a joke. Here's how that will go tRUMP: a bunch of bullshit and lies Biden: thats false and a bunch of lies. And so on and so on.
A candidate‚Äôs faith should have no impact on their electability. It certainly is not a relevant indicator of their ability to be a good/moral/ethical leader.  Who cares if Biden is more religious? He can‚Äôt govern based on his religion, so this is useless.
I would stand, sit, kneel, handstand if I could, headstand, lie on the concrete or in mud while swarms of hungry beetles chewed on my skin.  Rats could chew out my eyes, but I would find a way to vote for Biden.
Americans is not stupid.. they made a mistake 2016 , They are smart now.  Voting other Stupid to other stupid . can not win anymore! Biden for President!

America please lets saved our family friends and loved ones and livelihood and future of our kids and our country  ! Biden for President!
To be fair, Biden hates Blacks.
You got all that out of a tweet? Wow..all he was doing is pointing out Biden‚Äôs racism. The MSM won‚Äôt even cover these things.
Have you come to your senses finally, Mr. Trump? This statement was straight truth and Biden should not of said what he did. Doesn‚Äôt give you their vote either though!  #blacklivesmatter
O look someone who hates Trump's perceived racism but will actually vote for actually racist Biden. Imagine my shock. A hypocritical leftist.
Biden announced that he looks forward to debating Trump - I'd like to see the follow through on that.
Biden is patriotic Americans. And you sabotage our life.. from economy and healthcare and now 160 k died and 5 millions got sick.
For anyone who texted the number Biden sent last night can you tell me who the running mate is please?
Saw a tweet from Jon Cooper that said several sources close to Biden say he chose his running mate if this is true and if it's Kamala Harris then I  am dancing like crazy and a potential dance party
And that Biden....a gifted orator right there right?
Well if Biden decides to run for a 2nd term then yeah but there is a chance he may not run for re election in 2024
Voting for you President Biden is also a privilege....
We know and it is a distraction and Kayne will never be president majority of voters aren't suddenly going to switch from Biden to Kayne
He hates strong women i wouldn't mind if she got reappointed AG in a Biden administration she has some unfinished business to do and things that should have been done if Hillary won.
The NRA will be dissolved in 2021 once Biden becomes president and if Beto O Rouke becomes part of the Biden administration it would be amazing they fear him and know he is a threat to their existence.
He is one sick, pathetic, human scumbag...Biden has always been openly religious, and proud of it.
Hahaha! Maybe deep faith but not deep thought.  Biden can‚Äôt find his way from the bedroom to the bathroom,  then spends 30‚Äô trying to find matching socks.
So people believe that every Covid death in the US is Trump‚Äôs fault.  Why not just blame him for every death in the world? That‚Äôs the height of stupidity. Jobs are coming back, stock market is near all time high. Biden should be in assisted living.
Trump says that Biden will hurt the Bible and God. Biden is a catholic that goes to church more times than Trump and his family ever will. The Trump's are fake Christians in reality they worship white supremacy.
Hold on a sec.  This means that, at least to this swing voter, Harris is a better choice for VP. I'm voting for Biden no matter what, but I agree about Rice not being a good choice.
"There is, for example, a massive difference between Kamala Harris and Susan Rice. For me, it‚Äôs likely the difference between Biden getting my vote and writing someone else in. Harris would have my vote. Rice would not." -Republican S.E. Cupp

Biden is too compromised to even figure out how to hide his now.
So Mr Biden is going to act like there isn‚Äôt a whole entire African diaspora with diversity a huge diversity of viewpoints!

This is why he‚Äôs not going to Milwaukee. He can‚Äôt handle live events - If he doesn‚Äôt go, his nomination acceptance can be pre-recorded, rehearsed and edited to make him look cognitively intact. Trump is going to destroy him in a debate without even trying. Biden fails after 5 min

Michiganders you still have time to vote i recommend voting for Brenda Jones since she is an ally of Biden where her opponent has refused to endorse Biden and booed Hillary during 1 of her rallies.
Yes Florida and 1 more swing state gives Biden the presidency if Biden wins Texas that alone ends Trump's chances of getting re elected
obama and biden expanded concentration camps, which are filled with 47% black haitians, you're a fucking nazi of an organization to support that btw, you need to die
what's mind-boggling is that Americans don't want Joe Biden office they want President Trump backing for four more years. then after that we got a whole slew of great Republicans even you can run for president. You're better than Joe Biden right now.
Gm everyone Happy Tuesday everyone today is primary day in several states like Michigan please vote today whether that's in person or mail in voting. Today we must elect people like Brenda Jones and replace democrats who refuse to endorse Biden and replace them.
President Trump looses the endorsement of the Revolutionary Communist Party USA. The communist party has given their endorsement to Joe (Mr. Magoo) Biden.

How does a candidate not debate? Biden deserves to lose!
Biden took the lead in Texas according to fivethirtyeight on polling data at July 28th it has been 6 days since Biden has taken the lead there and it hasn't shrunk or grown and he hasn't lost the lead which is a very good sign for us. If Biden wins Texas he wins the election
Tomorrow we must elect Brenda Jones and replace Rashida Tlaib for refusing to endorse Joe Biden and for booing Hillary Clinton in one of her speeches. If democrats want to oust Trump they must have every vote if people refuse to endorse Biden and vote 3rd party they not democrats
Possibly. Brown lost it by about 5% while winning statewide by 7%, but Biden may do worse than Brown in some Ancestral D counties and will have to make up that strength in suburban areas. I'd rate it Lean R for president.

Riding with Biden!
Biden's lead in Texas is still holding according to fivethirtyeight he's had the lead on average polling data for 4 days now longer than last time let's hope his lead holds and expands on election day. If Biden wins Texas Trump's hopes of getting reelected are gone
Don't worry about it just like 2016 President Trump's going to win again. Joe Biden doesn't even know what the hell he's running for.. He's a sick demented old man who needs an earpiece and handlers that's why he doesn't want to do a debate cuz he would be destroyed just like you

Trump has ridiculed the health of Hillary Clinton &amp; Biden. No sympathy from me if he had a stroke
A VP depending on where there from can offer a regional advantage like Kamala Harris can help Biden do better in Arizona Val Demmings can help Biden do better in Florida and Georgia
IDC who he picks am voting for Biden though i do agree that a person in color is best choice
Vote for Biden no matter who he picks
Biden is probably going to win. His presidency is going to be a disaster, and in 2024 America is going to elect someone many times worse than Trump. You aren't averting any kind of catastrophe by supporting Biden. He's the wetnurse of fascism.
Biden is too stupid to know what that is.
That I call BS Biden doesn't need Bernie's approval for anything he is his own person he chooses whoever he wants and anyone who has a problem with that can 86 me now

Oh I‚Äôve seen blacks that are in support of BLM call Conservative Blacks those words on Twitter. It does happen. Those last two sentences sound very Biden like and I‚Äòm concerned.
But but but the polls say otherwise.  I‚Äôm waiting for the Hiden Biden VP PICK
He really can‚Äôt. Not before the election. It would be red meat for Biden and the libs. But he can try other ways to shut his ass down.
We need you president Biden
Voting for corrupt officials like Clinton and Biden? Runs in the family which is foolish.
Do it, now the youth will get out to vote even more strongly for Biden.
I agree. Biden cannot afford to lose any ground in South Florida- it's a big deal.
We have your back like you have ours! Biden will have you back in a heart beat!
Cuomo I believe signed a law doing that where newborns can be aborted after being birthed. I don‚Äôt know why Biden is the solution because even you told me you had some doubts on him.
So where did Biden caress you to win your support for him?
so you‚Äôre expecting a sell off? Funny stat, 85% of the time when market falls into elections, the incumbent loses the election. Hello Biden my old friend
If Biden wins, Barry is in charge
No one loves you for anything except maybe pedophiles that need help staying out of jail. Don't worry you and the rest of the freaks and criminals are going to jail once we have a real president. His name is Biden. Are your internal polls written in crayon?  FAILURE
IDC am voting for Biden no matter who he picks i endorsed Harris for VP but i ain't toxic
A Biden administration would not ban flights from China as he is in their pocket. Plus your economy is 1/500 the US economy and 35x less people.
How original!! I love it! That describes Hiden Biden to a T
They creating too much excuses.. in fact they are the one doing fraud scheme. Old tricks! They want to create other Wikileaks but sorry.. President Biden 2020!
They are the ones doing this. Biden 2020

I hope President Biden pick you Secretary of State..  .

Thank you Trump's tweet is nothing but a distraction why do people have to fall for this? Come on we need to stop giving Trump anything what he wants is a distraction cause he knows he losing states like Texas and if Biden wins Texas Trump has no path to reelection
Are unicorns sprouting out of Biden‚Äôs ass? OF COURSE they won‚Äôt
Biden didn't do that
Um no. Affordable care act. Biden was part of that. Obama got it done.
Biden for President!
Moms are for Biden. Sit down.
#EvictTrump is trending he is bringing down the value of Mar A Lago and the WH. The value of Trump Tower is also going down the drain if we want to bring back value in the WH we vote for Biden no matter how he does in debate stage.
You are the dad of the coronavirus!  Sick! We found the vaccine.President. Biden on Nov.3!
I will proudly vote for Biden no matter what happens am with you 100%
Most of the things under that trend are about Obama and/or Biden.
Finally some good NH polling. Biden leads 53-40. I‚Äôll say Likely D.
delusional human beings. here's a guy that was the worst president in the history of America and destroyed our country in 8 years. brought it to its knees and the economy. what a failure. along with that mental case old man Joe Biden who's not even fit to run Burger King üñïüèæ
Joe Biden's running mate - none will satisfy all sections of the party | US elections 2020 | The Guardian
A vote for biden is a vote for whoever he picks as a running mate basically. God Help Us if he wins-Heaven forbid.
Joe Biden supported the war in Iraq, which killed at least 500,000 people directly and many more indirectly. That's about 20,000 Bundys
Well since Rachel Maddow is off this week i hope she enjoys the time off and gets plenty of rest she will need it for January when they indictments come and news stories of Trumpers being charged breaks news if Biden wins
"I don't want my kids growing up in a jungle, a racial jungle" -Joe Biden, 1977, talking about desegregation
I understand your pitch, but you're not going to convince me that Biden isn't a white supremacist.
I‚Äôm watching Tucker Carlson now playing some clips of Biden.  For God‚Äôs sake the man is not in control of his faculties.  He‚Äôs not remotely qualified to be president
I would not worry about NATO. A President Biden will undo the harm. In February 2021, we need a full investigation into the Trump/Putin disaster. Thanks Anthony for standing up to Trump. Maybe you can help rebuild the Republican party.
üòÇ Biden can‚Äôt form a sentence let alone have interviews and Mr. ‚ÄúDictator of Disney‚Äù thinks he‚Äôs what‚Äôs needed?
Biden leading in Texas now if that lead holds on election day Biden becomes the president no matter what happens now we need to vote like our lives depend on it to make it happenI heard on the  today the great one call Biden a Trojan horse for antifa/blm/Marxists. What if he's a Trojan horse and Thats one head of the hydra. If the Dems get nation
I can‚Äôt wait for you to throw a fit in November when your buddy Biden doesn‚Äôt win, just like Hilary was ‚Äúleading the polls‚Äù how that end up for you, better just get use to it the trump train will be chugging for 4 more years bud
Who will you be voting for, Joe??   ‚ÄúWe can only re-elect President Trump!‚Äù- Joe Biden.
There is a chance of that cus it‚Äôs being reported across the country so Chris Wallace you are biased cus that is more a fact than him afraid of Biden cus in a fair election with VOTER ID AN NO MAIL IN BALLOTS this will landslide to Trump again but you protect the left! Yep
Chris you say your not for one or the other but what you said about Trump being afraid wants more debates He wants more debates to open the eyes of America and get all 330million. For you to openly say He‚Äôs scared cus of Biden. Nope but there is a very good chance
What happens if Biden gets the nomination and people begin sending in their votes via mail for him. Then it is determined he is not mentally capable and is replaced by someone else. Do the early votes for him stand? I presume so but....... Keep up the good fight!
I heard an indirect theory on the election, its not trump vs biden, its trump vs pelosi, because if there's no clear winner by Jan 20, Pelosi assumes the presidency until there is a winner, so if every couple days a new batch of ballots is found, we end up with president pelosi
üòÇ you really think Biden has a chance
Debates are not going to change the fact that it‚Äôs Biden in a landslide.  You are losing, you are a loser. Done.
#NoComradesUnder1k   Lol...you mean the ones you have to repeatedly tell them ....  ‚ÄúI am NOT f^*king voting for Drumpf  I am NOT f^*king voting for Biden I AM voting #Green ‚Äú  Yeah...I‚Äôm not one of those. üòÜ
I like the thought... The only idea that has ever tempted me to consider a Biden vote. LOL...if Biden wins I will happily agitate.
So...there‚Äôs a flaw...  Boomers are leaving Drumpf in droves &amp; will garner Biden a win.  They are mad at Drumpf for handling of C19... But...mostly retired...therefore on Medicare...financially stable...own their homes.  How do you wake them?
I have no idea... According to VBNMW I‚Äôm voting for Drumpf...but MAGAs say I‚Äôm voting for Biden.  #GoGreen
So many things that Biden is responsible for...  My favorite is the Patriot Act...  ...the author of the document that undermines the rights of Americans. While I served, thinking I was protecting American rights...with the flick of a pen, he threw them away.  F$&amp;k him!
You‚Äôre done, big loser.  Biden landslide.
He‚Äôs a danger to this country by trying to unconstitutionally delay an election, which hasn‚Äôt been done EVER through wars, depressions, or epidemics. Unless you count Roosevelt‚Äôs 4 Terms. He‚Äôs scared he‚Äôs going to lose as evident by Biden‚Äôs numbers in the polls.
Bet he calls for a bs review on the ballots after Biden wins. Yes let‚Äôs investigate the meaning of why I LOST, but the reason I won 2016? Russian Propaganda? Lets just forget about it bc im a narcissist who likes to grab em by the pussy and can‚Äôt accept my losses; right Trump? :)
Your reply indicates you agree Biden will weaken our democracy, end protections. He‚Äôll be a good guy &amp; not use that power (Bull$hit). Will Drumpf2.0 refuse to use it?  &amp; if Dems are ‚Äúresisting‚Äù why did they give üçë ü§° more powers?  Dems/GOP sold outüá∫üá∏ a long ago &amp; yeah, I miss it
The Republican-controlled Senate approved his budget. The same GOP-led Senate has allowed children to be treated like animals. As for a tax break, I didn't qualify, but if I did, it would have went to the Biden campaign. COVID repsonse.? He waited over 2 months to respond.
Biden 2020 eat my assBiden apparently thinks there‚Äôs only one black vote, because ‚Äòthose people‚Äô are all the same, unlike the gloriously diverse hispanic crowd.
Trump vs Biden Twitter war.
Combine this with the "you ain't black" if you don't vote for him and Joe Biden is looking pretty racist right now
West said ‚¨á   ‚ùå slavery was a choice &amp; Harriet Tubman didn't help slaves  ‚ùå he wears a MAGA hat and Confederate flag  ‚ùå he has a mental illness which seems to be inconsistently treated  These factors appeal more to Trump's base than Biden's
Right? I don't care if Biden picks a cactus!! Vote them all out!  And fill out your census! üòÄ
People camp on the sidewalk to get Black Friday deals, I'd line for 8 hours to vote for Biden.
Trump was literally sued for racial decriminalization over his Trump apartments.  Biden has received multiple civil rights awards and recognitions.
American voters deserve the truth about your tax returns  ! Jerk!
As funny as it is to think that Biden could hurt god,
This is also how Joe Biden sees the future of America's immigration policy so just keep that in mind when you see people not engaged with voting in a few months
It's time to cancel
Thanks for not covering Biden‚Äôs racist comment.  Your #FakeNews  reputation is intact
Lol, really? I don‚Äôt know if I can vote for Biden if he picks a VP candidate I don‚Äôt like... He could pick a corn cob &amp; I‚Äôll still vote for him. Get over yourself, ma‚Äôam.
I do not want Biden I don‚Äôt want trump. Shit fucking sucks and I don‚Äôt think either can make it 4 years into a presidency. Just focus on your local elections people.
As a white male American  &amp; Donald Trump are not only embarrassing; they‚Äôre also criminals and racial bigots!!! This is the USA not 1930‚Äôs Germany.  #Biden2020ToSaveAmerica #IamAnEmbarrasedWhiteAmerican #Biden #AmericansAreOne
I'm not feeding into the Joe Biden gaffe mess. I HOPE yall know what to do on November 3rd. Thats ALL I care about. FRFR
We need to attack and dethrone God but all Joe Biden wants to do is "hurt" God üò†üò†üò°üò§üò†
Just like how Biden said YOU AINT BLACK if we don‚Äôt vote for him right??? ü§°ü§°ü§°
They are both racist old White men lol Sorry. Did you not just hear what Biden said in an interview the other day. He said the Black community isn‚Äôt as diverse as the hispanic community. Basically dogging us. The whole government is corrupt, I can‚Äôt believe you are falling for it
45 just said Biden is ‚Äúagainst guns.... against god.‚Äù The truly crazy part? This is all most of his base needs to hear. The Idiocracy is strong with the uneducated right.
How is it desperate? Biden LITERALLY said this. Watch the video ü§°ü§°ü§°
Jill Biden is guilty of elder abuse.  There‚Äôs no excuse for her to be putting Joe through this because she‚Äôs desperate to be First Lady.  Jill has to do the right thing if she loves her husband.  #SaveJoe
Tucker Carlson did an EPIC TAKEDOWN of Susan Rice the other night.  If you‚Äôre at all fuzzy on what a seditious freak she is, watch this 8 min of truth to power.
Shows you how much Biden despises black people totally disrespects black reporter why would any black person ever vote for him
So Biden called black reporter a junky because he dared to ask about his mental state and also says he wasn‚Äôt texted but in previous state said he was and was tested all the time which is it and could you imagine if Trump called a black reporter a junky which he would never do
Biden did vote for the bill that stripped student loans out of BKO protection in '05, but has acknowledged it was a mistake and has vowed to fix that after he's elected.
"carceral genocide" was begun in '68 in response to Black Activism, further exacerbated in 1980, under the pretext of Reagan's war on drugs. Biden's crime bill didn't hit the books til '94, so I don't know wtf you're referring to here.
Biden was in the Senate from '73 to '09. The State of DE tax laws that made it a tax haven for corporations was enacted in the late '70's, by Delaware's Legislature, not the US Senate.
The move is the latest example of the pandemic's sweeping effects on the 2020 presidential election and the latest blow to traditional party nominating conventions.
Biden won‚Äôt travel to Milwaukee to accept Democratic nomination amid coronavirus concerns
Legit kinda sad Biden won the primary because he's just so depressing and boring. Where's the Klob getting actually mad
Open schools so 4 million 17 year olds due to turn 18 before Nov 3 can get too sick (or die) to vote.  Evict 1000s of people so they lose a valid address &amp; then their right to vote  Put West on the ticket to scatter the vote away from Biden  Cheating to win again
Biden continues to lose it.
I will support Biden regardless, though my preference is Harris. Harris has the necessary personality and national experience to be a boon to the ticket. The others are not inspirational, Harris is very inspirational.
I mean, how many vows to god can someone break before you start to doubt their word? By the way, Joe Biden hasn‚Äôt divorced or repeatedly and publicly cheated on his wives.
Thank you, President Biden
:-/ is that the one Rudy approached for dirt on Biden. Yeah.. it was. I wonder if Lev has anything to do with this raid?
Depends on where in DE you are. Of you're in the southern part of the state (and/or near the beaches), you're gonna see more Twitler signs. Sussex County is our South. The farther north you are the more Biden signs you'll see. It's a sad truth.
Did you get ‚Äúhoax‚Äù from ‚ÄòMississippi Burning‚Äô? You racist POS! #Biden
Yes, Trump has severe cognitive deficits regarding his executive functioning.  Biden on the other hand is just fine.
Did postal union endorsed Biden?  Is postal union corrupt too?  Is the nefarious plan to create #ElectionNightChaos and attempt to install Spkr Botox?  We may need #MoreWalls  #NoBallotHarvesting #NoMassMailBallots
It‚Äôs what happens when Donald Trump, Hilary Clinton, and Joe Biden are the best the Republicans‚Äô &amp; Democrats‚Äô nomination processes give us for Presidential candidates. These are the best 3 out of the 328 million US population? üò©üò©
It lays out like this.  He continues to do nothing.  We work HARD to get Biden elected.  In January we have a president that isn't a self-centered fuck and we start what the rest or the sane world did one year previous, and we finally START to get back on track.
I agree. Biden could just sit back, let Trump spew his nonsense and make himself look like the idiot he is.
Biden will be too busy figuring out how to tie his shoelaces to notice he lost.  Pelosi, Schumer and the rest of the commie squad would start a civil war.  Or try to!
maybe you should call Joe Biden.  You should certainly vote for him.
Rude girl!  I wouldn‚Äôt say ‚ÄòFuck Biden‚Äô because there‚Äôs just nothing there to fuck.  Just....nothin‚Äô.
Biden could pick the squirrel l that torments  dog and I'm still voting that ticket.
Raise your hand if What if Biden picks _______? Thoughts?  Redundancy, I hear you
Keeping my eyes open for pictures of Gnarly Jerk, Joe Biden, and iirc Bean Sharpie like this too
I think the fact that he's way behind Biden in the polls, and that he can't handle any negative feedback yet gets a lot of it is just freaking him out so badly that he can't function.
oh a ‚Äúkaren‚Äù then would be a better fit!! Get over your feminist ridiculousness!! Maybe Biden‚Äôs plan fits you better, let antifa take your neighborhood, you probably raised an antifa child anyway!!
I can't wait until President Biden uses this precedent to take down Fox News.

Is Joe Biden obligated to debate Donald Trump?  The purpose of debate is to learn where the candidate stands on issues.  After the Clinton/Trump debates I don't wish to see Mr. T. photo bomb and stalk his opponent again. It was just plain creepy!
Biden has a communist on his short list, Karen Bass.  She wants to eliminate anti-discrimination laws to legalize discrimination against those w/ a #WhiteStory, #RedStory, etc.  Their plan, sacrifice you the individual for the ‚ÄúAltruistic Goals‚Äù of the State.  #twill
DUH???  What planet is Trump on?  Does Biden know where he is?  Someone please stop this LEFT/RIGHT MADNESS!!!
But you are supporting a Biden one
Damn right! I'd *also* like Dems to state--for the record--that any move to fill a Supreme Court vacancy between now and 1/20/21 will lead to TWO new Supreme Court seats being created (and filled) by President Biden.
Can you imagine the absolute shit fit  Hannity, Rush Dipshit and all the other fucks would have had if either Clinton, Obama, or Biden even loosely hinted at delaying an election?
This will definitely get Bernie voters to flock to Biden if she's picked
Biden has the greater intellect &amp; emotional intelligence. Voting third party is not my choice as there is not a viable candidate.
Remember when you said this was just some conspiracy bullshit? Is it bad your opponent knows you better than yourself?
Where‚Äôs your apology to Joe Biden?
Gosh Bernie, it means we‚Äôll vote for Biden for sure.  Freebies mean everything to us.  We‚Äôll do anything for the Big Brother who takes care of us.
Biden‚Äôs got voters in Erie, PA!
Come on over. Do you really think Biden will be making the decisions? They will kick him out within 6 months with the 25th. Then a possibility that Pelosi would be VP. Do you really want that?
I can only hope that The Lincoln Project does an ad titled ‚ÄúTrump‚Äôs AmeriKKKa ‚Äú with highlights from Lafayette Sq., Portland, Seattle and anywhere his gestapo thugs have been. The violence is now, caused by him not Biden.
Biden is a useful idiot and it shows.
If Biden chooses a good VP candidate like Tammy Duckworth, Trump wouldn't stand a chance.SHAME ON YOU FOR AMIFYING RUSSIAN PROPAGANDA AGAINST BIDEN!
Joe Biden is dumber than a bag of doughnuts how do you guys not see it. He can‚Äôt even talk properly.. flubs his words all the time and loses my interest immediately
People are brainwashed to think nothing can be worse than trump. Even if trump is as bad as some people think, Biden is inherently worse.
Dear biden supporters. Your candidate is incompetent.
Joe Biden says if you vote for trump you ain't black. Joe also says if your white you are racist? Hes white therefore racist. Also blacks are not diverse compared to latinos.
We were talking about Trump but sure let‚Äôs bring up Biden since y‚Äôall know Trump is awful. No the 1994 bill was awful and unlike Trump supporters we accept what Biden has done wrong. Want to talk about the Obama administration and it‚Äôs accomplishments.
She's looking for cover for either voting for Trump again or for not voting for Biden, but for someone else.
Did you see who Biden brought along with him?  Who elected him?  Let's have a bigger tent than the Republicans do so that when we make them irrelevant, we will have the philosophical diversity in the Democratic Party necessary to consider all perspectives while they govern.
Nope. False. If Trump wins, everybody loses except his supporters. If Biden wins, not everybody automatically wins, but at least people of color like me have a shot.
Exclusive: Kanye West Indicates That His Spoiler Campaign Is Indeed Designed To Hurt Biden
Biden supports the second amendment idiot üòÇ he‚Äôs outlined a VOLUNTARY buyback program for high capacity assault weapons, which means it‚Äôs not mandatory. Try again
Kind of Biden's thinking ü§î
President Biden will be your President too. He will do much more for you than Trump but you won‚Äôt admit it. Just sit back and enjoy.
You are a true leader Tulsi and I wish Joe Biden would choose as his running mate.
Joe Biden is a disaster candidate for the Democrats! He is a quarter of Joe Biden from ten, twenty years ago! Joe Biden belongs to the nursing home not to the White House! And that's sad but true.  That's impossible that more than half country is blind and will vote for him.
Now you know why Biden is kept in the basement..
asked me to take a survey about Joe Biden‚Äôs cognitive state. I responded. #Biden2020 #TrumpIsNotWell #personwomanmancameratv
You know he will do it eventually:  will mock  for mental capacity or cognitive abilityüôÑ b/c Biden stumbles over words occasionally.   What you may not know is Biden is +still+ fighting a stutter he's had his whole life.
The democrats are in trouble with Joe Biden leading the ticket. They selected poorly
Wow would love to watch Biden bumble another debate
Let‚Äôs do a fact check on this video. trump manipulated images of Biden.
Biden will not be the Democratic Socialist Party candidate for the election. He‚Äôs deteriorating more quickly than they thought.
If the Dems sweep, Federal taxes will go way up. Biden already promised it. Your money is going to be used to bail out the  Dem cities and states whose economies have been destroyed by Dems.
So Biden knows already all the questions, no doubt.  Because he needs a lot of time to learn.
I thought that Hunter Biden should know first ü§î  Maybe you don't like each other? Hahahahahahahahahahahaha... It doesn't matter, you will be never the President!
The thing is it's always orange man bad. Where is Biden what are his polices. ITS FUCKING AUGUST AND THERE IS NO VP Where is China concentration camps How is Clinton not in the news after a witness seen him with people on pedo island
Joe Biden's Campaign Staff Is "Freaking Out!"
I really don‚Äôt like Biden but Trump is a huge threat. As a queer person there is always an uncertainty that if things go sour we will be one of the first groups targeted. It‚Äôs a crappy situation and I don‚Äôt think you should be so judgmental. Yes I don‚Äôt like Biden.
When you are in the Biden administration, all will be right with the world.
Biden would veto Medicare for All....Why even call Biden a Democrat when his policies are right of center?
The desperation keeps getting worse.  You certainly can't run on your record so all you can do is try to paint Biden as a villain.  Is this the same Obamagate that you were  unable to explain in your press briefing or a new one?
I voted green 2016 but this year I‚Äôm reluctantly voting for Biden. Next presidential election after this I‚Äôm voting for progressives only
Please Kanye fans, don't vote for him. Votes for Kanye will only help keep Trump in office. Kanye can't possibly win. He can't get on the ballot in all states. This is only ploy to take votes from Biden.
Biden has won
Sure they have to sneak those votes in, who will vote for Biden after he gets creamed in first debate
Donald Trump beat Hillary Clinton so badly and the left will never get over it. They tried to destroy him with the all costs, it never worked out for them, never will.  And this November he will do the same for Joe Biden...oh boy!
'Daily Show' releases video mocking Trump for stumbling over his words  via   Gee. Isn't that the subject of one of trump's ads against Biden?
No way, no how will Biden debate Trump. It doesn't matter what Biden is, he won't be running anything, the party will be running the country, right over the cliff.
Always Remember Joe Biden Misled Everyone About Wife&amp;#8217;s Death, Blamed Innocent Man for Years . Biden  have an issue with telling the truth  !!!!
Biden Bottoms 2020 was a personal favorite I hope still happens
In Dec of 2019 Trump was saying he would probably not attend any debates for 2020. Now that he is losing big time he is willing to,take any chance to get an extra vote. I say, Biden should just skip the debate.
Good, but If I were Biden I would demand that Trump reveal his tax returns or NO debates!
#SusanRice would be a bad pick for vp. I have a hard time justifying my vote for Biden and Susan Rice makes that vote twice as hard...Trump needs to be stopped but if he isn‚Äôt it would be a perfect time for a revolution.
#RisingQs  What happened to Bloomberg and will he make an appearance soon or will he wear a wig and become the VP of Biden
Biden will crush trump in a debate.
If Biden wins all your taxes will be raised to bail out cities destroyed by incompetent power hungry Dems
You are a real danger to the Americans health and democracy! Lying daily ! Biden was in a basement, but Trump was in a bunker hiding like bones spear spanky he is !
I wish every President had a failure like President Trump.  Except Joe Biden, because he never will be the President.
"...text 8802 for Prez Trump--" and lo, now allegedly President Trump emails the faithful with THIS?!: "Patriots wear face masks"????! If that's true, Mr. President, why don't we want dirty ole Mr./s Biden next term, eh?

oh man I wanna say it was Andrew Yang vs Joe Biden. but Yang had said that biden was a strong debater. I have no doubts that he will beat Trump.
But how would democrats get them to get fake dead people ids to vote for Biden?
That‚Äôs why a vote for Biden is actually a vote for whomever he chooses as VP
Maybe more!  Because the Democrats will send the votes until Biden will have more than Trump. That's their point of the voting by mail!
If you ask me, Joe Biden should automatically be excluded from public office for participating in an attempted coup.
Be ready at their convention when they replace Biden for whatever reason they come up with.
Even worse. Biden is the Left mob puppet.
I'm sure that after Biden's win (never it will happen), the left would have the schools opened immediately! Democrats Hypocrites!
Better than Biden. No doubt about it.
Everyone should know that the Democrats will send the votes by mail until Biden will have the votes to win.   Hahahahahahahahahahahaha...
Because of my job I drive all over the country all year round.  Judging by only the signs, i don't remember Biden's signs in any state. Listening to the local radio stations and talking with some people, my impression is: people want the security and prosperity.  But with Trump!
Biden‚Äôs health seems to deteriorating fast. Part of the democrat plan. I would say they would have to replace him soon, probably at their convention. Has anything like this ever happen before?
Thats bc Biden supporters are abiding by the COVID implementations while your supporters are causing more cases around the nation trying to cheer 0 feet apart with no masks.
Biden urged not to debate Trump so president doesn't have another platform to 'lie'   I'm not so sure it matters, cause trump will lie about everything any time, anywhere at any opportunity.
Wall Street just reported the worst quarter in history. Biden literally couldn‚Äôt do worse!
You mean, Biden in the Nursing home in November?
They just sent us vote by mail forms didn't even request them. Early voting 10 minute walk from home so we're voting Biden in person here in Schaumburg Illinois.
Unlike Trump, Biden will hire the very best staff.
They are only Anti Trump supporters. Doesnt mean they like Biden
Sure, Biden has been in politics for 51 years. That‚Äôs more than enough time to fix things, instead of napping
I hope Biden pick you #thewomanwhodidnotforgetwhereshecamefrom
You mean the same right that went ballistic over Obama‚Äôs suite and salute? I will say this much, there will be worse protest if Biden: 1) Use foreign policy for personal benefit 2) Have family members working in WH and using that to enrich themselves 3) Use fed against protest /1
There is 0 chance Biden will win in Dixie.
Hey dummy, what about these stats? Trump got no chance.  Chance of winning the electoral college: Biden 91% Trump 8%  Chance of winning the most votes: Biden 99% Trump 1%  Estimated electoral college votes: Biden 347 Trump 191
If trump wins again it‚Äôll be worse. Biden will at least give us some normalcy with the government and the world. And start a road to recovery. It won‚Äôt be overnight though. Those that don‚Äôt vote either way just gave up our children‚Äôs future.
Yet another example of something Trump had nothing to do with and is a result of Obama/Biden work.
Trump Warns That 'Jobs Will Disappear' If Biden Is Elected. Jaws Drop.   Funny, jobs have already disappeared in the millions on president dung's watch, and it's getting worse. He's getting more and more despite and getting worse!
Time for Trump has expired. If he doesn‚Äôt resign and have Biden pardon him he will be in prison next year.
There are more Trump haters than any other group in the country. Biden should be happy to have them. Bye Bye Trump!
Having Biden in control of the codes is far less scary than having someone with Alzheimer‚Äôs like Trump.
I am on work comp for a back injury. Its been a year. I gave to Bernie every single month, sometimes more than once a month. Whatever I had, I gave. I have given 0 to Biden.
Karen Bass #TheUmbrellaAcademy  I hope Biden picks her.
Biden had a STROKE. Biden had a STROKE!
He already served two termzzz ur running against Biden sweetheart
#karenBassthe woman who did not forget where she came from. After reading your bio, I hope Joe Biden picks you.
Bernie has been cancelled in my eyes since he endorsed Biden they can both grow old together in the nursing home now it‚Äôs over lol
How could jobs disappear more or the market crash more (we just dropped the most in 1 qtr in history)? Trump has killed both 152,000 people and our economy. Biden will stop the killing and job loss.
#YesWeCanAgain Let‚Äôs be honest with ourselves! We are voting for Biden not because he is going to be a great president... We are voting for him because trump is literally the worst.
What Happened to Stacey Abrams Will Happen to Joe Biden
Being the President of the USA is a tough job.  Joe Biden can be only the President of the nursing home.  Sad but true.
Joe Biden? Is that you?
Next January when Joe Biden is inaugurated you will officially go down in history as the absolute worst most disgusting president in history.
How about impeaching Trump, so that Pence can become president.  Will have a better chance vs Biden in November.  Is this possible?
TikTok was bad enough for Biden to ban it amongst his campaign staffers.

Biden will convert it to a ski lift
Even the most left leaning polls say that Trump has 25% of the black vote. Biden is making the same mistake Clinton made 4 yrs ago. He's alienating voters faster than Trump is.
It's all about control, influence, power. The DNC doesn't support Biden because they believe in his agenda (if he has any). They push the narrative. And they use naive people to do so.

Well the people who are running his campaign are Republican consultants. If he would just play music and shut up he might poach a few votes from Joe. But he wants to open his mouth so I don't expect him to do well at all. Black joe biden voters are not pivoting to kanye.
People for whom their vote hinges on the VP pick were never serious about voting for Biden anyways. It's a lame excuse. These Republicans in sheep's clothing.

Another way to interpret Trump's response is that he believes Biden to have monumental power beyond the comprehension of mere mortals.
So what do you want to do, burn the state?  At least President Trump can find Ohio.  Where's O'biden?  Obama speaks for Biden, Jill speaks for Biden, but Biden never speaks?  Takes no candid questions, only responds to specific journalists, when he knows the question &amp; answer.

Biden should demand Trump  release his taxes or no debate...
If Harris is the VP, then Schiff could be appointed to the Senate and the Senate Intelligence Committee. That would get him media coverage in the campaign and with Biden getting much less coverage than trump, Schiff getting air time would be a big plus
And yet, almost certainly the election of Trump will result in more death than Biden. You know this. Why deny reality?
Yep. It's honestly a shame she didn't run this time around; that, on its own, would have provided sufficient cover for Biden to make that pick.
You are correct. Democrats picked Biden to play it safe. Well, Susan Rice is Awesome but way too easy to connect her to Hillary and Benghazi.  The Trump Nuts would feed on this and distract from the real issues like, 1000 Americans a day dying. The 4 Benghazi deaths would "trump"

This pisses me off. I am the first to say she has baggage and should not be the VP. But for the word fuck? The president can grab people by the pusssy and use the word pussy but a woman using the word fuck is a bridge to fucking far.
He will NEVER resign. It would mean admitting failure or weakness and he is far too sick to do that. Also if he stepped down, then what? Would Biden stand a chance against any other Republican? I would rather he stay and lose.

That looks like Trump mocking someone in a debate.  If he and Biden end up debating (and I think it's doubtful) then we'll probably get to see much more of this when Biden stumbles all over himself.

Biden is an elderly man who had two brain aneurysms in 1988. One on the left side, one on the right side. Long-term affects of aneurysms include mental confusion and trouble articulating words. Maybe it‚Äôs not dementia, but the result of a ‚Äúsilent stroke(s)‚Äù
I mean to be fair I‚Äôd have a similar stance of opinion on what I said if it were Biden, or Sanders, or Elizabeth Warren, getting interviewed in such a disrespectful and badgering manner. It‚Äôs just plain bad journalism.

It seems likely that the Republicans are trying to draw Biden out by making it seem like he‚Äôs in a basement. The truth is they don‚Äôt have enough B-roll footage they can use to demonize him, so they need him to be out in public more
So Biden gets to ask a black man if he is a cocaine using junkie and the Left pretends it is nothing.  Hypocrisy at its finest.

I'm going to hold my nose and vote for Biden except if he picks Warren or Harris. Then I'll write in Bernie on my Iowa Ballot.
Mostly KHive people were cutting down Scientology because they're jealous Karen Bass is being seriously considered by Biden too.  Picking on candidate because She's even trying to get Scientologist to vote for her is GROSS! If she excluded them she lose her seat.
I am a Dem Socialist &amp; I am NOT Antifa. I DONT EVEN GO TO PROTESTS. I am a healthcare worker. I love Bernie. Hated Hillary so much I voted Trump. Now I hate Trump more than I dislike Biden....so I'll vote for JB as long as he doesn't pick Elizabeth Warren or Kamala Harris as VP.
Isn‚Äôt Biden supposed to announce his running mate today?
Karen Bass is a better person  than Kamala Harris will EVER be. She is an excellent choice as VP for Joe Biden. Harris is a back-stabber and a Hillary Clinton clone. She would stab Biden in back just to be President.

I‚Äôve typed this many times to many ppl in the thread. This type of overconfidence in an election win is dangerous. Especially with a candidate like Joe Biden as your Best In Show. Hillary was expected and projected to beat trump in 2016 and it didn‚Äôt happen. We‚Äôll see tho.
Allies say Karen Bass's reputation as a bridge-builder would make her a strong partner to presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden.

So, we‚Äôre all going to go vote in November right? I know I am, and I‚Äôm really trying not to have an impeached Trump get a second term but I also genuinely despise Joe Biden. üôÉ I‚Äôve done my research on  and  I definitely endorse him, I cannot endorse the other two.

Voting for Biden in one election doesn‚Äôt absolve you of all the really shitty decisions that have made this country weaker in so many ways. You have used the #LGBTQ community as a bogeyman. You have used #Black folks as a bogeyman. Your party is divisive and mendacious.
Ah see now I‚Äôm more knowledgeable on electoral landslides thank you. Regardless i stand by my words in saying it‚Äôs going to happen. And the cockiness I‚Äôm seeing from the left is a very dangerous mindset. No election is a guaranteed victory. Especially with a candidate like Biden.
To be fair I feel like people are even less confident about the democratic nominee in 2020 than they were in 2016 so yes you‚Äôre right it‚Äôs not 2016. It‚Äôs an even worse situation where most people don‚Äôt even want Biden. That‚Äôs a strange situation to be so confident in a trump loss
Because Biden didn‚Äôt run.
I reckon Joe Biden would be harder, dude would probably forget why he even stopped by within a minute.

Will Joe Biden be Kamala Harris‚Äôs new sugar daddy?  VP Nod?
OMG! You're a HillBot. I am so glad she lost a Trump. Kamala is a Hillary clone and I HATE her for that.   I'll be grudgingly vote for Biden as long as he doesn't pick Harris as VP.
Yes! I was going to go along with the Biden thing because I want to get rid of Trump. But if he picks Kamala Harris, I'm writing Bernie Sander's name in. F that crap, I'm not voting for that bi%ch.
My doctor told me this morning that I am diabetic. Not only that, but she sent prescriptions to my pharmacy for glucose testing and such. $100, I can‚Äôt afford it. My Medicare advantage doesn‚Äôt cover them. I only hope I live long enough to see Biden elected.
That is ridiculous. There are plenty other women of color who aren't willing to Flip-flop on policies or walk over the top with someone just to be VP or president. Joe Biden needs a Tim Kaine kind of VP.
She is too ambitious. She will overshadow Biden. She's the type that would have no problem declaring him incompetent and she the next President. She's a Hillary clone and should never be trusted or be the vice president let alone president. #NeverKamala
We‚Äôve been on the scary path the last 4 years... Biden‚Äôs already been in the White House, thus we already know how he will act.
I am going to have a hard time voting for Joe Biden as it is. With Kamala as VP, I may not be able to bring myself low enough to vote for Biden with Hillary's clone on the ticket.
I joked that the DNC was going to "Weekend At Bernie's" Biden to the White House, but they are really committing to the bit nowA person cannot be judged as a person of faith because he/she can recite "The Lord's Prayer." You, and Joe Biden are outstanding "LOSERS!"
What a Jackass!  This goof doesn't think a debate is necessary?  He thinks you all should vote for Joe Biden, a drooling  cadaver?  Reality is, 16 states will early vote, before they have an opportunity to hear Joe speak. That's what Socialist/Marxist/Democrats want you to do.

Yeah, there just isn't anyway a black joe biden voter would be enthused about kanye entering the race. Any black vote that kanye gets wasn't voting for Joe anyway.
Well the people who are running his campaign are Republican consultants. If he would just play music and shut up he might poach a few votes from Joe. But he wants to open his mouth so I don't expect him to do well at all. Black joe biden voters are not pivoting to kanye.
People for whom their vote hinges on the VP pick were never serious about voting for Biden anyways. It's a lame excuse. These Republicans in sheep's clothing.

They all back him, defend him &amp; turn a blind eye to the havoc he's causing. So yes, never trump IS never Republican. A non-vote for Biden, is a vote for trump.
I can't wait for the GOP and the Trump campaign to imply that Hunter Biden was at the bottom of this scandal... it's coming soon!
Trump really has a way of making Biden sound like he's a way better candidate than he actually is
Joe Biden is like... A hundred times more racist than Donald Trump. And he keeps showing it.
If Harris becomes the VP, Schiff can be considered for her replacement in the Senate Intelligence Committee and that would get him media coverage and a double addition to Biden's campaign
What Biden said earlier was this: "Oooooooooh. Latino lives matter more than Black lives because there are more of them, just so you know."  My god, we have two racists running for president...
So what do you want to do, burn the state?  At least President Trump can find Ohio.  Where's O'biden?  Obama speaks for Biden, Jill speaks for Biden, but Biden never speaks?  Takes no candid questions, only responds to specific journalists, when he knows the question &amp; answer.
What that means idiot is that there are many different Hispanic cultures. Like Mexico and South American Countries, as well as Cuba, and Puerto Rico. They are all Hispanic and they are all diverse. The BLM that support Biden and who will bury you are not as diverse. WTF!! SMH!
Biden is objectively better than Trump. Biden can pick a toaster as his running-mate and I‚Äôd still vote for him. #LincolnVoter
Kevin McCarthy? Devin Nunes? And prop 187 fucked them. Then Arnold came and he didn't do them any favors. But luckily people like me have a love of old white dudes like Jerry brown and Joe Biden.

They all went rogue!  Obama, Biden, Yates, Clapper, Brennan, Comey, Rosenstein, McCabe &amp; Stroyk.  This is the darkest period in American history, a single party corrupted our justice dept &amp; our election system. Sally Yates just testified, Trump was undercutting Obama policies?
Jill Biden appeared on Fox.  She wanted us to know, that "Joe is still the most moderate Democrat, but that's not to say, he's not Progressive?"  Dah!  She can't tell the difference.  Why are Jill &amp; Obama speaking for Joe?  Don't let this cadaver get away w/o debate!  #Hollowman
Exactly. I'm tired of hearing about it. The DNC are really ticking me off lately. Biden can't pick anybody that doesn't have "baggage." If not, &amp; the perfect running mate is out there, Trump's goons will just make something up anyway.
If Biden does not say that, how can Trump hear it?? Unless, of course, he's lying. Again.

If Harris is the VP, then Schiff could be appointed to the Senate and the Senate Intelligence Committee. That would get him media coverage in the campaign and with Biden getting much less coverage than trump, Schiff getting air time would be a big plus
This election is between trump and Biden. Not Hillary, Obamam or Pelosi.   We've seen what Biden did as VP for eight years. We've seen what trump has NOT done in the past nearly 4 years. Before this country is destroyed, we must make a choice.  I've made mine.
obama and biden expanded concentration camps, which are filled with 47% black haitians, you're a fucking nazi of an organization to support that btw, you need to die
You are correct. Democrats picked Biden to play it safe. Well, Susan Rice is Awesome but way too easy to connect her to Hillary and Benghazi.  The Trump Nuts would feed on this and distract from the real issues like, 1000 Americans a day dying. The 4 Benghazi deaths would "trump"

Biden is Glinda. Bernie is probably Elphaba.
This is good news, even though it should have been done months ago. While Trump tries to drag Biden and his son through the mud, this would be a really good time to have some hearing about Pompeo and his wife using the State Department for his own political benefit.  Let's do it!
This election cycle is very weird. We don't even know who Biden's vp is. Will there be any debates? I think biden should hold out for no taxes no debates. The Republican convention is closed to press. Just a very odd presidential election.
Just because Trump is Evil Personified doesn't mean Biden is the Devil.
Democrats are in the grip of Socialist/Marxists.  Democrats nominated Biden, but they are getting Bernie Sanders. AOC, Obama, &amp; Beto.   This is bait &amp; switch.  America would never vote for Marxism or Socialism, so they are riding into office in a Trojan Horse; Joe!
So what you‚Äôre saying is if Warren resigns 3 months before the election she can be replaced by a Democrat. But what if Biden loses? Then she‚Äôs out.
Politics should work the way Biden asks the governor of California for a favor, and if the intention to appoint Schiff is made public with the Harris for VP announcement, that would put Schiff back into main media play during Biden's campaign
Totally misleading statement from a diehard Democrats. Anyone supporting and voting for an old demented fart, Joe Biden for president should have his head examined. Furthermore, the Democrats have turned communists.
Probably, because if they‚Äôre not, why push mail-in voting if Biden can actually debate Trump?
Um joe biden is Old White Male.
Black people know. Why do you think we pushed so hard for Biden? I love him and he's palatable to white vote.

This pisses me off. I am the first to say she has baggage and should not be the VP. But for the word fuck? The president can grab people by the pusssy and use the word pussy but a woman using the word fuck is a bridge to fucking far.
I share Biden's Faith. Pope Francis sent a memo to American Cardinal's &amp; Bishop's as a reminder that all social justice concerns must be taken into consideration in this election, not just abortion &amp; gay marriage. Separation of Church &amp; State? Anyone? JFK did, Biden should too.
These Sanders supporters want to destroy the democratic party. They claim to want to reform it but they have twice been rejected by rank and file dem voters. And now they want to prevent us from receiving PAC money. Join the DSA and fuck off.
Hopefully all this idiocy will cost him the election. I can‚Äôt stand Biden either, but even Biden is FDR compared to Trump.
Bernie's tweets were better than Biden's.

When talking about Biden‚Äôs VP nothing was mentioned why Biden cannot choose Warren. Warren a great talent but can cause the Democrats to lose the Senate in November. If Biden chooses Warren , the Republican Governor of Mass. will replace her with a new Republican Senator.
Because trump has to get twenty times more airtime than Biden
I'm voting for Biden regardless of his VP choice.  However, given the campaigning restrictions necessary because of COVID, selecting someone with a certain degree of name recognition would be helpful. It's the whole "a heartbeat away from the presidency" thing.
Seriously, the ‚Äútoo ambitious to be VP‚Äù stuff is mind boggling. Biden is going to be 78. Never said anything about a second term. Age is a huge factor for the VP. Whoever he chooses is the odds on favorite to be the front runner in 2024.
It will be the party to end all parties. Living in Chicago, I remember how excited I was and the feelings of pride I had when President Obama won in 2008, it'll be rivaled by the feeling I'll have when we have President Biden!!
I know that Biden used big words and you hate that so if you want to talk about cognitive decline I am just going to say 5 words: Person. Woman. Man. Camera. TV. Is that more your speed?
I'm arguing that defeating trump should come first and people shouldn't support trump, just because Biden doesn't rise to their extreme progressive agenda
This is really sad. I don‚Äôt like Biden for a number of reasons but his handlers allowing him to make a fool of himself and make it worse with a failed attempt at humor is verging on elderly abuse. Snarky comments to obviate from his dementia made it more pathetic.
It doesn't bother me. Can't fix stupid, Herman Cain for instance. I will say, when I put out my Biden sign &amp; flag, 2 neighbors quit speaking to &amp; even waving at me.
Biden better get a carville (not a carvel, tim)
You‚Äôre right Joe Biden will try to get out of having any debate with Donald Trump. We the people want to have these debates move forward so we can make a choice based on what we hear
Corruption is open and visible, but Democrat voters do't seem to catch on?  Hunter Biden made 411 trips to 29 foreign countries, during Biden's 1st five yrs as VP?  Five of those trips to China.  No trips to Ukraine Energy Co. who paid him 1M a yr, to "not show up?"
Where do Biden‚Äôs top VP candidates stand on Israel?
Most of the things under that trend are about Obama and/or Biden.
Biden looking Presidential and prescient today.
Same here, I hope her early confrontation with Biden isn't held against her, all the other candidates eventually piled on in their attacks against Biden, didn't they?
Yes. If we had competency at the federal level we wouldn‚Äôt be banned from traveling to the majority of the world. 150,000 people are dead. Mitch and CO and giving money to companies and military while people are being evicted and dying. So yes. Biden will 100% be better.
And the CBC love them some Joe Biden. He was always my first choice.
Agreed. He'll need something like a separate commission because Congress will be too busy. Every Republican is complicit in every crime committed by Trump.   Makes me nervous even talking about Biden definitively winning. The GOP will cheat, lie, suppress the vote, etc.Is it possible to start a direct action to remove Biden and put Warren and Turner in?

Even the most left leaning polls say that Trump has 25% of the black vote. Biden is making the same mistake Clinton made 4 yrs ago. He's alienating voters faster than Trump is.

Another way to interpret Trump's response is that he believes Biden to have monumental power beyond the comprehension of mere mortals.
Arrogance and ignorance. Everything he says is a lie. He just said that Joe Biden is against God and hates the Bible.  What an idiot and a global embarrassment.  The Orange Stain is the worst ever.

And yet, almost certainly the election of Trump will result in more death than Biden. You know this. Why deny reality?
Yep. It's honestly a shame she didn't run this time around; that, on its own, would have provided sufficient cover for Biden to make that pick.
But how would democrats get them to get fake dead people ids to vote for Biden?
Maybe more!  Because the Democrats will send the votes until Biden will have more than Trump. That's their point of the voting by mail!
Be ready at their convention when they replace Biden for whatever reason they come up with.
Even worse. Biden is the Left mob puppet.
That's funny!! If Biden were president, the numbers would be double just from not closing the border as Trump did. Maybe you should look into what Trump has done instead of listening to what he hasn't. üêë

I know he‚Äôs competent, intelligent and thoroughly decent, and that he‚Äôs a patriot as opposed to a criminal and a grifter. He‚Äôs been a public servant for 40+ years, 8 of them as VP. If you don‚Äôt know enough about Joe Biden at this point, that‚Äôs on you.
How could jobs disappear more or the market crash more (we just dropped the most in 1 qtr in history)? Trump has killed both 152,000 people and our economy. Biden will stop the killing and job loss.
What Happened to Stacey Abrams Will Happen to Joe Biden
Being the President of the USA is a tough job.  Joe Biden can be only the President of the nursing home.  Sad but true.
Joe Biden? Is that you?
TikTok was bad enough for Biden to ban it amongst his campaign staffers.
I'm done listening/reading VP chatter. Biden will make his choice and that will be that. Enough with the noise.
Had a dream last night that Ayo was raising the National Championship trophy and while on the court he got a call from President Biden. He told him his story inspired millions of kids especially in Illinois. ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èseems plausible, right? #Illini

More than half of them don't want him reelected, and he loses more support in congress and in the senate each day. There's no surprise that the Lincoln project is doing so well and gaining so much revenue and turning moderate Republicans over to Biden.
I thought there was 1 Trump channel and 2 Biden channels on cable.
Joe Biden knew all along. We have under 100 days left to ensure he wins and restores the soul of America. What will you do today to help?
a Biden/Harris ticket would be detrimental to all the progress made on criminal justice reform
Told you, they will pick a far left vice president and if Biden wins he will be declared incompetant and the Vice Pres will take over where Vp had zero chance if running as pres
Joe Biden? Is that you???
It‚Äôs nice to see that you are settling on Biden. A completely incompetent candidate. Scary actually. Not only do u support killing unborn children, you also want to see the demise of the US under failed democratic policies. Must be nice to watch from the sidelines in Spain.
Just saw a commercial for  where that #idiot  was making fun of Trump for stumbling over his words... just wondering if you've ever heard Biden talk? #Trump2020
Joe Biden is going to be the President of the nursing home... no doubt.
Yes. If we had competency at the federal level we wouldn‚Äôt be banned from traveling to the majority of the world. 150,000 people are dead. Mitch and CO and giving money to companies and military while people are being evicted and dying. So yes. Biden will 100% be better.

Joe Biden is dumber than a bag of doughnuts how do you guys not see it. He can‚Äôt even talk properly.. flubs his words all the time and loses my interest immediately

Donald Trump can't win an election facing Biden head to head.  He needed Jill Stein in 2016 and Krazy Kanye now.  Plus all the Russian help then and now.
Nope. False. If Trump wins, everybody loses except his supporters. If Biden wins, not everybody automatically wins, but at least people of color like me have a shot.
Illinois is likely Biden?  They must have run out of dark blue ink.
He worked so hard bashing Biden...
Biden is trying to triangulate but keeps drawing a straight line.

Joe Biden is like... A hundred times more racist than Donald Trump. And he keeps showing it.

President Biden will be your President too. He will do much more for you than Trump but you won‚Äôt admit it. Just sit back and enjoy.
Joe Biden is a disaster candidate for the Democrats! He is a quarter of Joe Biden from ten, twenty years ago! Joe Biden belongs to the nursing home not to the White House! And that's sad but true.  That's impossible that more than half country is blind and will vote for him.

Wow would love to watch Biden bumble another debate
Let‚Äôs do a fact check on this video. trump manipulated images of Biden.
Biden will not be the Democratic Socialist Party candidate for the election. He‚Äôs deteriorating more quickly than they thought.
First, you don‚Äôt get to tell citizens when they can make their voting decisions. Second, if these debates are so important to you, what haven‚Äôt you agreed to actually participate? VP Biden has...
If the Dems sweep, Federal taxes will go way up. Biden already promised it. Your money is going to be used to bail out the  Dem cities and states whose economies have been destroyed by Dems.
So Biden knows already all the questions, no doubt.  Because he needs a lot of time to learn.

Trump campaign ad against Joe Biden contains a number of doctored images, CNN and WaPo report   - Trump will cheat, lie and steal too get his way. He must be stopped in November. #AmericaIsStrongerWithBiden #BlackLivesMatter
Absolutely!!  Biden is giving Trump enough rope to hang himself.  And Trump can't help but do that!
The desperation keeps getting worse.  You certainly can't run on your record so all you can do is try to paint Biden as a villain.  Is this the same Obamagate that you were  unable to explain in your press briefing or a new one?
Please Kanye fans, don't vote for him. Votes for Kanye will only help keep Trump in office. Kanye can't possibly win. He can't get on the ballot in all states. This is only ploy to take votes from Biden.
Your chance is gone Bernie, Biden has enough problems, he doesn‚Äôt need you to come in and scare the crap out of all the moderates and those teetering between parties.  This just fits into the narrative that America as we know it will be overrun by far reaching left extremists.
Biden has won
Sure they have to sneak those votes in, who will vote for Biden after he gets creamed in first debate
Donald Trump beat Hillary Clinton so badly and the left will never get over it. They tried to destroy him with the all costs, it never worked out for them, never will.  And this November he will do the same for Joe Biden...oh boy!

In Dec of 2019 Trump was saying he would probably not attend any debates for 2020. Now that he is losing big time he is willing to,take any chance to get an extra vote. I say, Biden should just skip the debate.

That‚Äôs why a vote for Biden is actually a vote for whomever he chooses as VP
How can this guy accuse Biden of not knowing where he is when this guy can‚Äôt read off a sheet of paper??
Maybe more!  Because the Democrats will send the votes until Biden will have more than Trump. That's their point of the voting by mail!
Be ready at their convention when they replace Biden for whatever reason they come up with.
Even worse. Biden is the Left mob puppet.
I'm sure that after Biden's win (never it will happen), the left would have the schools opened immediately! Democrats Hypocrites!
Better than Biden. No doubt about it.
Everyone should know that the Democrats will send the votes by mail until Biden will have the votes to win.   Hahahahahahahahahahahaha...
Because of my job I drive all over the country all year round.  Judging by only the signs, i don't remember Biden's signs in any state. Listening to the local radio stations and talking with some people, my impression is: people want the security and prosperity.  But with Trump!
Biden‚Äôs health seems to deteriorating fast. Part of the democrat plan. I would say they would have to replace him soon, probably at their convention. Has anything like this ever happen before?
Biden urged not to debate Trump so president doesn't have another platform to 'lie'   I'm not so sure it matters, cause trump will lie about everything any time, anywhere at any opportunity.
Reminder that Biden doesn‚Äôt feel many people are needed for him to win, so he‚Äôs chosen a campaign platform that won‚Äôt win over those voters. It‚Äôs Biden‚Äôs failure not individuals who don‚Äôt vote for him.
We call them customers Biden chose not to appeal to. Failure by the Biden campaign.
Wall Street just reported the worst quarter in history. Biden literally couldn‚Äôt do worse!
You mean, Biden in the Nursing home in November?

American evangelicalism is predicated on white supremacy. That's the foundation of the faith tradition. So when Trump says Biden is going to "hurt God," he's poorly articulating a firmly held belief that whiteness is a blessing and embracing diversity is an attack on God's plan.

Well, from the Obama years, we have to realize it‚Äôs not about what THEY bring.  It‚Äôs about what WE bring.  WE need to give Biden a Democratic Congress (which we didn‚Äôt do for 6 of Obama‚Äôs yrs)  WE need to stay active &amp; engaged &amp; MAKE our Democrats be better Democrats.
'You know you‚Äôre going down for the third time when you claim your opponent has the power to hurt God'  who knew that biden is so powerful!
Here‚Äôs one. He would‚Äôve followed Biden‚Äôs advice on the China travel ban and wouldn‚Äôt have implemented until two months later than he did.

This is such a joke. The ODNI released a statement equating China with Russia. ONLY Russia has an active operation to help Trump and defeat Biden, but they make it sound like China is trying to help Biden.  This is all to help Trump say ‚ÄúChina is helping Biden‚Äù when it‚Äôs a lie.

Here‚Äôs the truth Joe Biden has dementia and doesn‚Äôt think very highly of black people.
‚ÄúTrump says the only way he can lose is through election fraud. In fact, it seems more likely that the only way he can win is through fraud.‚Äù
Can you really hurt God?   If Biden really can he's got my vote - think what he'll do to Putin and Xi Jinping.
I agree.  Biden is not my man, but we have no other choice under the current conditions.  Unbelievable how bad things have become with the divisiveness at play.  But one thing is for sure... Donald Trump helped to expose some of America's deepest flaws, hypocrisies, &amp; horrors.

NEW (AP) - US intelligence says Russia is using a range of measures to denigrate Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden.
Oh my god! I‚Äôve been saying it for a year that he will refuse to leave! All those jerks who scoffed at Biden‚Äôs statement about that. ‚ÄúDid you hear what Biden said??‚Äù from Tucker. Not so farfetched now, huh?!! I KNOW he‚Äôll pull something. WE know it!
no Biden and the democrats are doing that to themselves. Sorry, we already spent 4 years playing this game with democrats.
The ODNI is attempting to help Trump by equating China with Russia‚Äôs anti-Biden pro-Trump active operation. It‚Äôs a joke.

I like to think that whoever is VEEP, she will be but one element of President Biden‚Äôs COMPETENT CABINET.
Would like to disagree with you just for this one time Jeff. But I can't, I don't like or care for Trump's rhetoric on Vaccines especially. Plus his allegiance to GAVI is most troubling. He's still our only choice for President. Joe Biden is a New World Order ally &amp; Globalist!!

Yet you provided no evidence. Biden is a racist and Trump has helped black people plenty in his tenure thus far.
Don't fret, you have my Biden vote. Doesn't change the fact the two party system is broken.
Seems clear that only Russia has an active campaign working to go after Biden and help Trump.
That Trump believes that Biden could "hurt God" exposes the shallowness, the superficiality, of Trump's own beliefs. Believers in God know that God is stronger than either Biden or Trump.
Joe Biden is a Russian asset sent to destroy Joe Biden
How and why is this still legal? Individuals have very modest limits on campaign contributions. Groups should also be limited. This is an in-kind contribution to Biden.  Bloomberg's gun control group spends $15M on campaigns in eight swing states | TheHill
Either Joe Biden is omnipotent or Trump has a seriously impoverished conception of God.

Good to know: what the US intelligence agencies think about Russia, China and Iran's efforts to meddle in our elections (Russia is anti-Biden, China and Iran are anti-Trump).
Ick. A vote for Trump is akin to a vote for a grapefruit. Get your facts straight about Biden too.
So now what?  We just let it slide like we did in 2016?  The media needs to step it up and focus on what is important, like our election integrity.  They spent all morning talking about some vague comment Biden made about Hispanics.  Come ON.  Our democracy is at stake.
Fact: Joe Biden is pro abortion. Showing up with the wrong agenda doesn‚Äôt make you a catholic, which joe is not. Gassing rioters is just a part of 2020. But you keep spinning.
Trump is totally right. Biden is against God and religion.

While many may want to stop and focus on this one single moment in time on what Biden said,  as a black man I was and am in no way offended or threatened by his statement , unlike the clear and present dog whistling that Trump has and continues to press across the nation.

Guys, relax, a fortune teller from the American University says Trump will lose.
How come no one ever talks about the same blue suit every male politician seems to wear? Whomever is picked needs to have a thick skin. And frankly, Biden needs a superstar with heavy political chops who‚Äôs media savvy because he‚Äôs light on charisma.
When was the last time Joe Biden advocated for policy on abortion (and/or many other issues) that was consistent with a traditional Christian worldview? Joe‚Äôs party wants to deconstruct/dismantle norms that are viewed as essential by Christian theology and philosophy.

87% of Democrats support "Medicare for All," though Joe Biden doesn't
Neither Trump or Biden are model Christians.
I can't believe no one has publicly connected the dots. Dot 1: GOP refuses to make a deal Dot 2: Trump announces unilateral action to give people money (and hopes it's blocked by courts) Dot 3: Campaigns on "I tried to help when Biden democrats didn't."
Gotta' love Gretchen Whitmer. Actually, she 'should' be Biden's VP pick. She would get back the white female vote that fled from Hillary and would energize the moderate suburban voters. Unfortunately, a black female running mate is being forced on Joe by black female voters.

More like a Biden rally with him still in the basement
Why would Joe Biden move one inch to the left today, after he wouldn't back in March when he was one primary loss away from dropping out of the race altogether, and after all these liberals, progressives, and other left organizations already committed their votes to him?
He will . Been a student of politics for my entire adult life. Biden is destroying himself by simply opening his mouth. He‚Äôs not capable of doing the job. I think the senate will flip. But ultimately the president will prevail.
WHY didn't you bring up ALL the policies that  has done for  Churches? Remember how --- God was under attack under the Obama/Biden admin? Merry Christmas was no longer acceptable? Unreal.
I hear Biden‚Äôs workin with those two Corinthians to take God out.
Biden‚Äôs decline is stunning. I was a big fan of Biden during the Obama admin, but he‚Äôs simply not fit to serve as president right now.
If Biden wins get ready for months and months of people from other countries condescendingly "congratulating" us on cleaning up our mess
I keep seeing posts about Kanye admitting to sabotaging the Biden campaign. Every single article I click references his quote that he is "Walking for President, not running".   Does anyone have a better source on this? The headline is everywhere but nobody actually has the quote.
During the debates, Biden‚Äôs energy plan seemed to focus on electrifying cars without talking about urban planning and reducing reliance on cars in favor of walking, biking, and trains. Does this plan address that?

S.E. Cupp is not well. She's insulted that Trump criticized Biden's faith, but was eerily silent during the months Biden criticized Trump's. Or Biden's stated desire to close more churches. What a shock. Two fake Christians banding together.

Biden didn't say what is being attributed to him. Listen to the whole statement.
They're trying to raise Biden's gaffes to a level of seriousness, so they can work it in with discussing Trump. Trump is a historical fuck-up &amp; there's nothing Biden can do to compare to the Death Clown in a meaningful way. It's stupid sh*t! Biden needs to make the best choice!
Ana.... unless Kanye pulls white and Brown voters from  Biden (the reasons dems lost in 00 04 and 16) he won't be a threat.   Getting Biden to Obama's 08 or 12 white support in FL or Hillary's 2016 Hispanic support there is more important.  A rapper won't be why Biden loses.

few catholics have ever opened a bible but BIDEN is a man of GOD
To me, that's unlikely. Conservative Catholics are a significant part of social conservatism in the US today - take a look at the Supreme Court. The split is that Biden is pro-choice &amp; wants to reinforce separation of church and state; Trump's supporters want the opposite.
They see they might lose the White House, so they have to lay the groundwork to suddenly care about the deficit, and derail Biden‚Äôs agenda if he becomes President.
... again they‚Äôre doing this independently of Biden who prefers to hire right wingers
One. Shes not being authoritarian. Two. Weve had these discussions countless times since he dropped out. And three youre not living jn reality if yiu think biden will drop out and bernie gets the nom. We live in the worst timeline. Bernie will not get the nom.

I liked Val Demmings but Biden needs more assertion and help. He'll need Harris and a shot of something medicinal.
Remember when Trump said he‚Äôd have sex with his daughter? Or when he bragged about peeping at 13 yo girls in a dressing room? Or when he said he admired Epstein for have lots of ‚Äúyoung‚Äù girlfriends? But yea, Biden ‚Äúlooks‚Äù like a ....
Here you go buddy.  I hope you don‚Äôt mind but he said he REJECTED the KKK which for someone that supports Racist Joe Biden pretty much means he wants nothing to do with them.
I'm not a Biden supporter, and I do believe he's a creep, potentially a rapist, and quite likely does have one of those mental ailments coming on.  What I'm saying is that all of those same things are true of Trump, and that Biden still speaks quite well most of the time.
He's just mad cuz there's no nude photos of Dr. Biden on the internet.
If you look at the best-managed countries in the world, most of them have a woman at the helm.... Biden has a wealth of talented, qualified women to choose from. I'm happy with any one of them. (I'm sure there are some talented, qualified men, but no names come to mind...)

This is an unfortunate idea that's going around, but only works if you only ever hear Biden in snippets on right-leaning news sites. There are identical videos of Trump stumbling over his words.  Unfortunately people have learned to ignore anything that refutes their narrative.
The pres also thinks Biden is a radical leftist, so I pretty much just ignore whatever he says these days.
The Democratic Convention must somehow replace Biden. Shame on them for promoting a guy with mental issues.
Can you think of a single leftist thing Biden has ever championed in his entire life?  I can't recall any.  Given that democracy is a leftist system of govt (built of leftist policies/destroyed by rightist policies), it's a pretty big deal if he hasn't supported anything leftist.
okay ü§° its insane how out of touch Democrips are sometimes. Biden's VP will likely be President by 2024 but also Nancy is one of the few people in the Party older than Joe Biden.

Never Forget  "Unlike the African Americans community, the Latino community is incredibly diverse"  "If you have a problem figuring out whether you're voting for me or Trump, then you ain't black"   - Joe Biden's racist comments have nothing to do with dementia.  He's racist!

#TRUMP2020 AT LEAST BIDEN'S THOUGHTS ARE CONSISTENT!
Exactly. Joe Biden is another symptom of the same disease that brought us Donald Trump. The era of nothing changing is over.
Jes protective of his brand. Perks of being the first black prez.  He didn't want a Biden run messing up his legacy or brand. So loyalty to his VP and brand isn't really much of a big deal.
For those of us who don't associate having a moral compass with religion: Trump is a pussy grabbing racist &amp; is letting people die because he doesn't care to solve Covid. BIden is a good man who will bridge the divide and surround himself with experts to advise him. that is all.
Pathetic reply, team Biden.   What exactly did Joe mean by...   "unlike the African American community, with notable exceptions, the Latino community is an incredibly diverse community,"  A blatant generalization?!  Where are the, snowflakes uniting in outrage!?
Democrats support known racists and incompetent politicians . Media ignore joe Biden‚Äôs racist comments and Chicago‚Äôs democrat bankruptcy of Chicago but nice try Eric
Why don't you ask the black people voting for Biden troll. I guess 90+% of the vote don't matter to y'all.  He's not actively working to let them die like the murderer in chief.
Finally saw a Biden sign in my town. Right along side a BLM sign. What news are they listening to?
BIDEN IS NOT SLEEPING  BUT TRUMP WILL NOT WAKE UP
Anything on joe Biden‚Äôs racist remarks the last few days ?
My point is that we're expecting Biden to be a race man after 40+ years in politics having never been a real race man. I give him credit for at least trying, but he needs to have someone who can speak to these issues for him because he's just not that guy.
The sad part about this election is that Joe Biden can keep having slip ups and say some stupid shit, and we still have no choice but to vote for him üòì
And I think that makes sense. From a timing-wise, I'm not questioning that. BUT Hillary had way less time to make a decision and STILL made it earlier than Biden. My personal opinion, 4 1/2 months to make a VP selection is entirely too long.
Also.... no one was 77 years old at the top when those VP with statewide wins was picked.  Rice would be Henry Wallace if Biden picked  Wallace was pushed aside for Truman in four years.  Our primary in 2024 May be wild if Joe or Susan doesn't Run.
They keep lowering the bar for Biden... all he has to do to exceed Republicans' expectations is remain upright

To think this could be Hillary Clinton's reelection campaign instead of Trump vs Biden.
To Joe Biden can you please don't say anything controversial and win the presidency. You have enough time to embarrass Trump when you debate him.
Biden did not write that message. One of his handlers did.
So true and sad that this is not being hammered... My respect for the left would go from 0% to 1% if they pushed Biden out saying enough is enough!!!

You're not worthy to shine Biden's shoes.
My question is this: what kind of weak, pathetic god does Trump have if Joe Biden is capable of hurting that god?
Your giving Biden too much credit here sir.
So is Joe Biden, at least Trumps policies reflect Christian values, unlike Biden‚Äôs. Christians didn‚Äôt vote for Trump to be their pastor, their husband, or their moral compass. They voted for Trumlnto do exactly what he‚Äôs been doing and they‚Äôll do it again.
Its pretty obvious that Biden is a terrible candidate
Republicans do not think black people are going to vote for a rapper over Joe Biden or Trump so please stop with the silly shit lol that‚Äôs not what‚Äôs going on AT ALL.
Ditto for Biden
Thanks Bernie. I voted for you twice and this is why I am NOT voting for Biden. Republican and Democratic establishment elites are on the same team. Don't be fooled by the charade. Biden is one of "them" not one of "us".
So you would rather vote for Biden, how in the world can you explain this, and do not use the argument of Trump. Support your vote by what Biden has done in his 44 yrs, and don't back door it
I'm simply outlining political strategy and WHY it doesn't help trump to talk about it, you're apparently triggered over me calling Biden.. scrappy. Be less emotional and more on topic.
I believe it's obciously one-sided Patriot. You look at Mr. Jack Dorsey profile. This dude is as far-left &amp; Radical as they come. And now Facebook's getting real bad with their Censorship. This is all meant to depress the Conservative side &amp; make sure Biden wins!!
Trump, love him or hate him, simply doesn't have an...impressive backstory, THAT is y the campaign doesn't focus on that. IT just isn't a winning arguement to talk about money and making money when it comes to biden vs trump. Trump's silver spoon is a negative politically
Biden i will raise taxes on small business owners and the grass oh look a butterfly ü¶ã
I mean, hilarious that you think this conversation is taking place in now. Biden‚Äôs 74 and is talking about his father. Have you ever driven a stick made in the 40‚Äôs, 50‚Äôs? It‚Äôs different than an automatic 2019 Civic, FFS. Also, context why Dad‚Äôs driving is emotionally triggering;
joe biden, politician or not, worked from middle class beginnings, speech impediments, etc.. to go t law school, get elected and work his way into politics, Trump inherited a bunch of money and a real estate biz that he bankrupted a bunch of times
Joe Biden could pick a booger out of his nose and declare it his running mate. I‚Äôm all in. Also, fuck right off. No one is undecided at this point. Don‚Äôt try to cloud your obvious trump support with this ridiculous take
Joe Biden won't get to vote on the 2nd Amendment. That's what senators do. Maybe read the Constitution vs. Wipe your ass with it, SIR!
I don't give a shit about either candidates childhood I care about policy BUT again.. not sure why my comment is flying over your head. IF the Trump campaign makes it about Biden vs Trump personal finances, its a losing argument.
lol It's why I stressed what he actually is.  It's not about him, he's passive unless he's pushed or in proxy to the limelight.  People will speak thru him, and that's what I would focus on    Biden is nothing but a puppet, and the less unscripted words he speaks, the better.
What a Jackass!  This goof doesn't think a debate is necessary?  He thinks you all should vote for Joe Biden, a drooling  cadaver?  Reality is, 16 states will early vote, before they have an opportunity to hear Joe speak. That's what Socialist/Marxist/Democrats want you to do.
Amen to that Patriot. If Biden gets in there; it will be like a 4 year never-ending nightmare!!
Your daily dose of depressing.
Joe Biden has disrespected black people on multiple occasions.   TRUMP GAVE A BLACK HOMELESS WOMAN A HOUSE AND A $60K JOB  You‚Äôre misinformed
Me: Well, I'm not happy about it, but I've finally set aside my own distaste for him, and am ready to vote for Biden in Nov for the greater good.  Biden: ... unlike African Americans, Latinos are very diverse...  Me:
But would you vote for him without a line? I think the question is aimed at people that are planning to vote for Biden.
Nobody said anything about hunter or that "biden is still middle class" I simply said, Trump's childhood as rich kid of NY real estate... isn't as relatable as Biden's middle class scranton PA background...why are you trying to argue? It makes you sound dumb
We can‚Äôt possibly be still voting for Biden. We just gonna ignore everything he says?
Any debate about their past, and upbrining simply highlights trump as a rich kid, vs biden as a middle class  guy from scranton PA.. that's just reality. How have we as a nation gotten to the point where basic facts like this, require 20 twets in explanation?
Your ability to not process what I'm saying is getting annoying. I'm saying what Biden said when there wasn't a pandemic doesn't apply when there is a pandemic. Of course travel is restricted
I keep saying that if Joe Biden kept his mouth closed, we‚Äôd have no problems.  Just don‚Äôt speak, Joe. #Biden2020 #BidenWarren2020 #BidenHarris2020
no im refering to joe..the person running... again biden's background, as in where he was born, what he's overcome is simply more "relatable" than Trumps. Why is this so hard for you to understand?
Never really paid attention to Joe Biden, he was always riding Obama‚Äôs coattails. Obama picking Biden as VP with his well documented roots in racism is disturbing to me &amp; speaks volumes about Obama. Maybe Biden was picked 4 him? It shows Obama never related to Black Americans
I should have said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not just voting for Biden‚Äù but couldn‚Äôt edit and the sentiment is stronger the way I put it so I let it ride. Twitter with the no edit button wins again!
From the leftist perspective they're not electing a president, they're electing the opposition they'll have to force to make concessions. Like that scene in ghostbusters, "choose and be destroyed."  Biden has been resisting progressivism for a long, long time.

I outlined how the narritve would be, I didn't claim biden was "poor today" I said the narrative would be, here is his background (middle class) vs here's trump (rich kid who inherited $) stop trying to argue if you aren't smart enough to follow the covno...

Biden isn't Trump-lite by any stretch.  He's a puppet, and I'm only okay with it because at least he's relatively leaned Left, in the vague ballpark of being potentially progressive with a focus on infrastructure.  Necessary grief, a place to build off of.
Anybody else starting to think bringing up Biden's faith is going to backfire big for the idiot-in-chief?
Joe Biden will complete the sellout of America.  100%
For some reason, I thought of you  when I thought of this:  Trump is Suge. Biden is Diddy, and this is late 1997.
That‚Äôs weird, Teddy. I must have missed your tweet about Biden‚Äôs racist remarks yesterday.
The amount of hypocrisy there is in questioning the mental acuity of Joe Biden when the alternative is Donald Trump is astounding.
Nothing if that what you believe Biden is ... I don‚Äôt.
The polls suggest almost 100 percent of Bernie supporters will vote for Biden.
According to Andrea Mitchell, Biden doesn‚Äôt even have a team. She referred to his campaign as ‚ÄúTeam Obama‚Äù.
Rice will be just fine.... imo. Yes I think Harris three statewide wins matter but these cats don't want Harris brand building as VP. They want LOYALTY to Obama Biden and the brand.   For that reason I give Rice a slight edge.
While many may want to stop and focus on this one single moment in time on what Biden said,  as a black man I was and am in no way offended or threatened by his statement , unlike the clear and present dog whistling that Trump has and continues to press across the nation.
The goal is to help your friend trump. And to take away votes from Biden.

Actually, you can't prove that Biden wouldn't have handled COVID well, because he and his administration aren't in office (yet)

Huh? Biden has made at least his second stupid comment about the black community in just months. Trump understands that segment better than him, hopefully they wake up to this
PS Biden lost that right when he publicly proclaimed abortion to be something he supports. Perhaps you know the spiritual works of mercy where it is every Catholic's duty to admonish the sinner and the sin of supporting baby killing is worse than defamation.
Sigh...  Again. It was context. His posts suggests that the DNC gave us Biden over a wildly popular policy. An important one at that.   My comment was about the context.
I think too much is being made of both Biden and Trump‚Äôs slip ups.  Biden is getting old, but I doubt they would‚Äôve green lit his candidacy if there were legitimate concerns.  Trump‚Äôs never been the sharpest tool in the shed, but the GOP chose charisma over intelligence.
If elected in 2020, if Biden isn't healthy in 2023, he is not going to run again. If he is healthy, he will run again.   If Biden gets a second term, he could die in office...
anybody that is voting for Biden isn't a republican or conservative don't piss on my leg and tell me it's raining.
Without a doubt.  Biden isn't healthy and shouldn't be running for President, nor should he be used as a puppet for the Democrats to rule over.  Do you disagree  ?

I think the "Biden will hurt God" problem is not about *Trump's* bad theology (it fits with his worldview in terms of the power of fame and social capital) but the fact that undoubtedly this has been affirmed and solidified time and time again by the Evangelicals around him.
Both have consistently polled Biden +10.
It's right in front of Biden Obama and his orbit......  It's on them to get over their loyal to the brand insecurities.
AND while 40% have heard messages about the importance of voting, protesting and other forms of political engagement, almost nobody has heard President Donald Trump or his challenger, former Vice President Joe Biden, called out by name.  Read on!
Every single VP since 2008 has been announced on a Friday or Saturday....I swear to Christ, if Biden makes us wait until next weekend......
These attacks will only get crazier as Trump realizes he's going to lose in November, and lose big. Trump has no bottom, no morals, no ethics and no "red line" he won't cross while making up attacks on Biden.   ---&gt; Hang on to your hats, turbulence ahead!

You cannot expect any less. The ‚Äúwell spoken Negro‚Äù  Obama (per Joe Biden) used the John Lewis funeral itself as a campaign venue.
No disrespect intended #HidenBiden but details matter more than you seem to think &amp; you &amp; Obama locked children in cages at the border.               Colbert Questions Biden About Being a "Gaffe Machine"  via

Hope so - maybe the morning of November 4 as we watch Biden retreat to his basement sobbing into his oatmeal!

Maybe some of us should stay home on election day.  If the Democratic Party won't court us and Republicans are morally bankrupt, this might be a good option.         via
Just a reminder, joe Biden is on video bragging about his 1 billion dollar quid pro quo with Ukraine as democrats accused Trump of Quid pro quo. üòÇüòÇüòÇ just one example
The conspiracies never end! Obviously Obama is behind all this even though he didn‚Äôt endorse Biden until he was the clear winner.
Is that law to protect Joe Biden?
Joe Biden has lost the black vote after he is forced to apologize for suggesting Latino community is more diverse than African American¬† via
i'm guessing, like biden, he supports benefits for ALL illegal immigrants.
Well, I guess if anybody is going to have some credibility to call someone racist it would be Trump.  Also, Joe Biden is not a racistü§£ üòÇ ü§£
In fact, I had to check to make certain the avi wasn‚Äôt already the Biden 2020 logo before I wrote this.
Nope.  You‚Äôre just an idiot.  Biden wasn‚Äôt in my top 7 candidates running. I‚Äôm more progressive than that. But he‚Äôs not a bad man and he‚Äôs who we have left. I‚Äôm not going to spend my time tearing him down because my feelings are hurt.
Biden saying African Americans have no diversity of thought is a much bigger problem than pronunciation...stay focused
Because Obama told you personally, right?  Obama chose Biden as his running mate. He was the candidate and made the decision- whatever the reasons.
I‚Äôm not voting for Biden!!! I‚Äôm voting for a new Secretary of Education. Our education budget decreased by almost 7 billion dollars which specifically targeted programs in the inner city and programs for special needs. I‚Äôm voting for another left of center Supreme Court Justice.
it's a testament to the difference between Biden and Trump that conservatives are trying to milk this story for two or three days.  Biden simply provides less ammunition than Trump because he's not insane.
Agreed! Biden's voting record as a senator reveals that he doesn't believe there should be consumer financial protections as well as equitable access to healthcare.
Trump is also racist. We have two horrible candidates but I‚Äôm not voting for Biden.
Racist, huh?
I wish we had a real media though. Because you can actually report how Obama-Biden enacted illegal housing laws forcing housing high rise projects into suburbs at the suburbs own dime ! Otherwise they would receive no monies and. E shed by the government.  The war on suburbia
The fact that people want Joe Biden to 'go back to the basement' (Hide Joe Biden strategy) until after the election is what's wrong with our political system.  #StopBeingAnEnabledOfOurCorruptedSystem
I‚Äôm November 3 I will wake up from this nightmare when Joe Biden is elected president
That is f**king hysterical!
I DON'T THINK BIDEN IS WRITING HIS TWEETS. HE KNOCKS PRESIDENT TRUMP ABOUT TWEETING LOOK AT HIM. THATS WHY I CALL HIM BULLSHIT BIDEN.
Yes, nothing says bully more than criticizing Biden for his fake adherence to Christianity - because last time I checked, Christianity is against abortion, gay marriage, &amp; forcing nuns to give abortion medicine.  Guess Biden is also a bully for calling Trump names too!
I‚Äôm so over 2020 üòî
Really?  Can you give me the link that shows that Biden voters DON‚ÄôT know what his policies are? I‚Äôd love to see that. I‚Äôll wait.
I hope that helps you sleep at night as Republicans turn our country from its current state of corrupt and unlivable to feudal dystopia.   Pelosi, Schumer, Biden could use a number of tools to punish republicans for their norm breaking, but eh, they‚Äôre sleeping just fine.
Did you notice creepy Biden does not sniff on little black girls ?
Fox News: Joe Biden takes the wheel of his 1967 Chevrolet Corvette Stingray in new campaign ad.
If Biden was president we be down 1.8 million jobs. And the crazy thing is people will still vote for Biden not knowing a single policy of his! It‚Äôs all about the economy folks. That‚Äôs the #1 priority. Try and look past trumps hateful racist ignorant narrative.
Let's take a look at cable news right now, shall we?  CNN: Covid-19 cases could reach 300,000 by Dec 1st MSNBC: Although unemployment dropped, it is holding steady at a record high of 10.2% Fox News: JOE BIDEN IS A RACIST!!!!  #FakeNews #FakePresident
I wasn‚Äôt pretending. I stated a fact.  If Democratic voters were that passionate about M4A Sanders would have won. He didn‚Äôt. Black people voted for Biden in SC and subsequent states.   I get that you ‚Äúneed healthcare‚Äù but attacking Biden and helping Trump won‚Äôt get it for you.
Thank you for your remote intelligence assessment and your obvious expertise. Quick question for you:  where do you have biden on the intelligence scale? I have him slightly below a chimpanzee
Did you notice creepy Biden does not sniff on little black girls ?
Well........  Hillary lost because she was at 32 percent white support compared to Obama's 42 and 37 in 08 and 12.  Sorry guys!  The last 80 plus days this is where my focus is.  Biden gotta run better with white voters.
BIDEN MAKING UP SHIT.  EVERYONE THATS A UNITED STATES CITIZEN HAS THE RIGHT TO VOTE. I WOULD LOVE BIDEN TO CHALLENGE ME ON THIS. REDICOLUS.

hot take: Biden isn't wrong  2008: 31% of latin voters chose McCain over Obama vs 4% of black voters  2012: 27% of latin voters chose Romney over Obama vs 6% of black voters  2016: 28% of latin voters chose Trump over Clinton vs 6% of black voters

Also, they polled Biden voters on if they could name Biden‚Äôs policies? That‚Äôs seems oddly specific.
Probably. Still better than Biden I think
#Biden could pick a can of Spaghetti-Os as his running mate and I‚Äôd be all in on "Joe/Spaghetti-Os 2020"
There's plenty of progressive Latinas to choose from but of course Biden picks the conservative Contra from Florida. What's her qualifications you ask: she hates Trump.
You mean the clip where Joe Biden makes the obvious point that a person of Cuban background is different that a person of Mexican background on a number of cultural fronts, but that they all should join together to vote for Biden?  Yeah, so what?
It is entirely possible ‚Äì perhaps not plausible, but possible ‚Äì that on January 21 there‚Äôs a President Biden and a Democratic House and Senate that nuked the filibuster, with a fire hose of GND/stimulus cash pointed at transit.  If that happens, what‚Äôs Metra‚Äôs plan?
I believe reports that Biden already made a decision, he said he would make decision this week. Quite frankly, Biden needs to look through all the vetting materials, but Biden probably has a good idea whom he wants to pick before then, or at least a few names.
Politics is chess you open the door of money and background and money the obvious next move is "ny real estate heir (who sat on his riches as you lost your job) vs scrappy blue collar Biden.
That's where I am keeping the focus.   Older black voters assigned Biden to win more white voters.  That's his top priority.

Joe biden damn a sentence away from dimensia. Dude too old for this job
Kanye is a publicity seeking whatever. Taking votes from Biden is just the worst thing anyone can do
I'm glad you see more signs on issues then people. #BLM signs and #PRIDE2020 flags and other human rights issues that need to be addressed more then an election. To mentally stable people it's obvious who supports human rights more #Biden2020 #Biden
the identity politics people didn't pick Biden because he was woke, they picked him because they think he is what center right america wants. the identity politics they push is just placate certain segments of the left. different base management strategies at hand here
They are only synonyms in Biden and the Democrats‚Äô minds.
Too late....gaffs are forever üòú. Biden is a racist

America please lets saved our family friends and loved ones and livelihood and future of our kids and our country  ! Biden for President!
Yes.   He apologized, got suspended, took a lesser profiled job for what 3/4 years now and from the responses to this tweet many have forgiven him and moved on. He has redeemed himself.
Was your account hacked? The name is Ana not Anna. It's Team Biden not Team Obama. Hope this is your online stand in Andrea Mitchell, if not maybe it's time for you to retire.

I don't give 2 flying balloons who it is. I'm still voting for Biden. I haven't forgotten Sarah Palin.
Is anyone else getting Joe Biden mail that's been ripped open already?
In case you didn‚Äôt realize, Biden‚Äôs a little nutty too.
NRA gone: So if Biden is going to apparently assumptively take away our guns but also there's no police, who's going to take away our guns? The military won't do it. Why not? Because they swore oath to defend the Constitution. Then again, so do police...hmmm.
They certainly do have problematic histories and I‚Äôd argue Biden more so than HRC. All politicians do especially when you‚Äôve been around for quite some time. The world is simply more progressive and Hillary didn‚Äôt have room to atone, Biden has been given a pass. That is misogyny.
Everyone:  Literally anyone but Trump!  DNC: Here's our guy Joe Biden!  Everyone: Dude, really?
Biden has the common sense to understand how a virus spreads, and what it logically takes to contain it. He also won‚Äôt risk children and the ppl around them just because supposedly they‚Äôre ‚Äúalmost immune‚Äù smh
Huh? Andrea Mitchell calls hiring of NeverTrumper Ana Navarro by Biden camp a "big get" for Team Obama in Tweet  #AndreaMitchell #JoeBiden #Election2020
I am voting like Joe Biden is losing because the skeevy Republicans will absolutely cheat.
Taps mic...if Biden really wants to make FDR scale economic reforms...there is really only one VP candidate who has the unique skills and boldness to help him do that and make the case for it...hint she says "big structural change" a lot.
Joe Biden leaving his basement for the first time
White people: Biden is here for your comfort. Do not fuck this up.
Joe Biden? never mind
Certainly you're right. But my point moreso was excitement isn't always people's deciding factor. Believe me, I would like  a once in a lifetime pol like Obama - but he's once in a lifetime. I think we are lucky in that Biden doesn't have Hillary's high negatives and well, Trump.
Not soon enough.   Meanwhile dumbass Kanye is running in just some states where black voters who would vote for Biden will now vote for him.   How is that legal? Run in all 50 ... OR DONT RUN.
Let Biden tell it, we're feeling the same as yo non diverse ass! All of us are just feeling the same!
By Biden annoucing vague prequalifications for VP based on race and gender, he sets up any woman of color that he may place into the role for failure.
It's not "identity politics" it's calling out the false statement that the DNC is some boogie man that makes these decisions. It is not, real voters make these decisions - in the case of the Democratic party, Biden owes his nomination to black voters. That is fact.
People are shocked over Joe Biden being racist again? Lol nothing new.
Kanye just admitted he is a TOOL for drawing the black vote away from Biden.
Where does it say on that image that ‚ÄúBiden has a ____ chance of winning‚Äù?
It is, but it could well work.  True w/ 160k dead &amp; economy falling apart, its not clear any play of theirs will work. But if you are team Biden , why in god's name would you voluntarily give the other side the chance to scream emails and Bengazi for the last 3 months to Nov.
Obama is not an American Descendent of Slavery (#ADOS) which is what is traditionally considered an "African American" and he did nothing for us.  Biden was mentored by Dixiecrats.  No points gained.
Biden must‚Äôve dropped that bag üí∞ off in queens lol üòÇ
This absolute nonsense. Bernie overwhelmingly won Latinos with a strong progressive message, so Biden's answer is to tap a conservative for outreach to our community.
I think so, it doesn‚Äôt fit comfortably in the narrative that sells ads on news networks and won‚Äôt help Biden get elected.
Good morning, respectfully following up on your kind offer: current thoughts on Biden's selection for VP running mate?
Rapper #KanyeWest indicates that his spoiler campaign is indeed designed to hurt  in  exclusive.  Is anybody surprised?
I hate Trump but since when is an accusation a verdict of guilty? Because if you're gonna do that then you're literally about to vote for a sexual predator In Joe Biden. But I see you have zero problems with that.
Joe Biden doesn‚Äôt need any help from Kanye with splitting votes lol he‚Äôs already doing a great job with that.
I'm gonna be honest...neither of you are worthy any votes from anyone. We are literally voting for whoever will do less damage to this country. I'm voting Biden not because he is worthy but because he is the only option to get you out.
I mean Biden keeps saying racist stuff casually because he is a racist pedophile. Why y‚Äôall act surprised lmao #biden
Joe Biden is A has been
Explain how Biden winning is Obama having an unconstitutional 3rd term. Be sure to use small words so even you can see how stupid you sound.
So a smaller percentage of Black people should vote Democrat so we can show Biden how diverse we are. Gotcha. #downballot

Watching Trump with Axios and Biden on Yahoo this week has been...not great. We need a do-over
I don‚Äôt talk about my Catholicism. My faith works for me. Who am I to judge how or if someone worships?  But this is vile.  Biden has buried a wife &amp; two children. He leaned on his faith. He uses his faith to help others grieve. He is guided by faith.  Trump‚Äôs attack is repugnant

This thread was really helpful, and insightful. And it was nice to see someone call out RCP on their nonsensical poll selections/exclusions. Confirms a lot of what I'd figured about the recent hand-wringing about the race tightening. If I had to guess we're Biden +~8.5 rn
Biden isn't Trump.   I think it's best not to gaslight people. Folks are under a lot of mental strain.   Gas lighting  is always bad.  I don't think it's good for people to try to make them ignore the obvious. It's unhealthy &amp; damaging.
1) Kayne is an increasingly pathetic lost soul who needs personal help, not a campaign.  2) With #RankedChoiceVoting, he wouldn't be able to hurt Biden at all.  Yet another reason we need RCV.
Voting for Biden and Trump is a waste of a vote
That‚Äôs stupid. Biden and an iguana would work for me.
Biden has great mental fittttt, fitlllll, fittmmmm, er fitness.ü§£
Voting for Trump and Biden is a waste of a vote. I'm tired of voting for the lesser up to evils like we always have and I'm damn sure not going to vote for pedo, pro police, pro war, racist Biden because "orange man bad " so I might either withhold my vote or vote third party.
and...Joe Biden doesn't even know he's Anti-God &amp; Anti-Gun.
As a matter of fact, I think this would make a fun game on a long car trip. We can all play now:  Trump                    /                  Biden  dementia               /                 dementia            ‚úÖ  elderly                   /                  elderly     ‚úÖ
I'm not "Black" either, but I know if I were, I wouldn't want Joe Biden telling me I "ain't black" if I don't vote for him.
If Trump wanted Biden to look pitiful, he has lots of material to work with. Any audio clip of him forgetting where he is, who his wife is, racist behavior/comments and sniffing girls and grabbing them to name 5%
It ain‚Äôt comin today. They gotta print the Biden/Harris signs first.
Are you kidding? BLM are NOT voting for you, Biden didn‚Äôt explain it correctly &amp; he apologized.  (something you have NO idea about)
the biden campaign really fucking sucks??
While Trump lies low, Biden is out there disparaging black people.  While Trump's work continues, Biden make sense another "gaffe" that makes people question his mental faculties.  And it's believable because he's been working on this since at least 2009.
The problem there is that the wife would likely have not been in a meeting of top democratic operatives.  Then there is Joe Biden himself.  Game this out that he knew what he was doing for a long time now. He had a ton of time to prove his loyalty to the DNC.
The thing with top AIDES is that they can be replaced, especially if the political party feels they are screwing with the party overall. Biden could just be convinced to let the aide go.  The next one is his wife. Close enough to feed him things but can't be gotten rid of easily
Because this person would have  had trusted access to everything Obama did during the eight years they were in office.  That leaves me with three potentials:   A top aide of Joe Biden who knows he's going through cognitive decline and fed him wrong information.
So I have a crazy theory  &amp;  .  Joe Biden is Donald Trump's ultimate Judas goat.  No one would believe that, which is why it makes him the perfect one to do it.  I want you to logically consider something:
It will be president trump. Biden too dumb. I could do better.
They both are.  They are literally making us choose between nearly identical men.  You can literally draw side by side comparisons for Trump and Biden on nearly everything. In many cases, Biden is actually worse. He's just more charming and has a better smile.  Neither is good.
When is a President not a President? When he's Joe Biden.
If democrats still push Biden, they will lose. The convention needs to have an uprising because he just isn‚Äôt it
Entering the job market in 2008, watching the ‚Äúcollateral murder‚Äù video that was leaked, reading extensively about the prison industrial complex, being a part of the occupy movement &amp; seeing how it failed, &amp; watching Bernie filibuster the senate for 8 hours live on CSPAN in 2011.
Twitter, CNN, MSNBC, The New York Times, Washington Post etc etc are all racist organizations keeping minorities in the dark about Joe Biden‚Äôs offensive comments. Willful gross negligence for political manipulation of our country. What a Disgrace ! Kayleigh sick em!
I'm voting for Biden even if he picks me for VP.
I‚Äôm glad Biden spoke up about this
üö® BREAKING!!!  BIDEN IS NOT WORTHY OF JACK BLACK‚ÄôS VOTE
Will be playing sound bites today of trumpy mispronouncing Yo Se Mite (said it wrong twice, so you know he has no clue) and Thighland?  Yet you‚Äôre worried about Biden‚Äôs brain.
Joe Biden's statement on faith
Also, Biden has mostly been quiet over the past several months, for several reasons: 1. Limit personal gaffes 2. Let Trump dig his own grave. 3. Prepare for debates. What has Trump been doing? Playing golf and stoking fear. Again‚Ä¶interesting strategy.
Anyone who defeats Trump and his racist band of dumbfucks are okay with me. Sign, a Black American.  P.S. I was NOT offended by Biden‚Äôs comment. I have my eyes wide open. He‚Äôs not nearly as offensive as that Racist in the White House and the Trump followers. #Trump #Biden
Look at the signatures he turned in, I think this is Wisconsin.  is committing malpractice for not challenging his paperwork.   Now that Kanye has admitted it is his plan to foil Biden. I hope he goes to jail for election fraud.
I would make an addendum to this article with all the talk about making Elizabeth Warren "Czar of Something" so her outstanding work product can be used without giving her any real recognition or power.
wow - it's amazing how the news tried to twist the facts on this and make it sound not bad for Biden
More Fake News bulls**t...        ABC, NBC, and CBS Run Defense for Biden, Edit His Racist Gaffe out of Their Reports
So Biden will keep busy once he‚Äôs in office? Sure makes you wonder why his parents let him exist.
There are a ton of evidence of election fraud with Kanye‚Äôs paperwork. I‚Äôm shocked that Biden / DNC lawyers aren‚Äôt challenging them to get him thrown off the ballot in a few of those states.
Bernie is 78 and Biden is 77...
People often acquire jobs for thier abilities in driving vehicles. In Biden Sr.s time this was only more true. Think a little harder on this.
I don‚Äôt understand the Trump camp‚Äôs strategy over the past few months against Biden. They‚Äôre trying to convince us he‚Äôs mentally slow, has signs of dementia, in hiding, doesn‚Äôt want to debate, is sleepy, etc. When he seems presidential and competent, it‚Äôs going to backfire.
People still defending biden by attacking trump it‚Äôs pathetic!
Just bcoz Joe Biden was the VP of a Black American President in the past that doesn't mean he truly cares about the Black Americans communities.the facts that his been a politician for so many Year's.I have not see or heared anything he does for Black folks all those year's!

There is no way we are going to be able to get this virus under control unless Joe Biden gets in office.  We are going to hit over 200,000 dead by the election.
I really love that the Trump campaign is hyping up the debates and suggesting Biden doesn‚Äôt want to show and asking to add another. I think there‚Äôs nothing but upside‚ÄîBiden beat Bernie at their main debate and it likely will be much better for Biden come September.
#nuclear power generates 60% of the nation's zero carbon electricity. That's why we need emissions free nuclear, along with renewables, to achieve our clean energy goals and fight climate change.

Seems like Biden's refusal to sit down for an interview with so may major publications/journalists is a story worthy of more coverage in itself.  (I know you've talked about this publicly, I'm not criticizing you)
Look at the the left‚Äôs zombies still defending biden by attacking trump y‚Äôall are so ignorant.
Joe Biden obviously doesn't support Medicare for all and he says it numerous times, I don't want to hear it.
Sick of refreshing the latest Biden/Trump polls and want to understand what's really going to happen in November? State legislative races are a great heatmap of political activation &amp; this report from  is essential
Well done,
In the 2022 Midterms, the Lincoln Project will take your $5 and challenge the heck out the Democratic Party, everywhere.   I would be surprised if members of the Lincoln Project were voting Joe Biden &amp; then straight Republican on their ballots, to re-elect Trump enablers
Atleast Biden recognizes absurdity of his statements and not double down like the toxic orange monster.
The Democrats have made it crystal-clear there is NO room at the national level for anyone who opposes abortion (hence AOC's backing of pro-life Catholic Rep. Dan Lipinski's opponent in the primary, even though Lipinski voted with Pelosi 90% of the time).
WHO WANTS TO GO TO WWIII!? MAGATS (Make America Great Again Trump Simpathizers)?! Let‚Äôs sum up how great USA is today. NO MORE: special olymipics,AIDS &amp; critical health care prevention/funding, farmers,LGBTQ...military,health safety accross USA,FDA,WHO,CDC,USPS,etc. VOTE BIDEN!
That‚Äôs because Biden insulted the Black community.
Not in my case. I voted for Bernie in 2016 and 2020, phone banked for him too. I am supporting Biden now.
You don‚Äôt believe your own eyes and ears? Your President seizes EVERY opportunity to point out EVERY time Joe Biden doesn‚Äôt say something perfectly. He is a malignant narcissist, who does NOT care about you or any of us. He is a liar, conman and cheat. PERIOD.
Well they said Obama was the Antichrist, so how much worse can Biden do?
shoutout to my boys  sending me this article. Shit beyond messed up.
I'm a wonderful person.  I don't hate like you.  Even now, I don't  have Biden.  I feel sorry for him because he waited too long to run.
‚Äúunlike the African American community with notable exceptions, the Latino community is an incredibly diverse community with incredibly different attitudes about different things‚Äù Biden actually said this yesterday
We the people need to realize we don't have to allow presidents or Congress memebers to keep their seats. Biden the option to remove trump. once that's done those who don't like Biden can then vote against him next election. Stop letting undeserving people hold office just cause
To anyone that truly thinks Joe Biden is a racist you are an idiot. His comments were misguided and perhaps misspoken. No man cares more about the minority population of this country than Joe Biden. I think we should give him a pass on this one.
I think Rubio is right and the hearing showed that (outside of Murphy who appears to be allied with the "mesita") but I certainly hope that Guaido and Borges are lobbying Biden's team for repudiation of the December 6th farces.
I don‚Äôt understand. I‚Äôm talking about Kanye and how I feel about Kanye. I don‚Äôt support Biden. He‚Äôs an idiot. I support Bernie. Or supported Bernie. What is that you need here sir, this is a Wendy‚Äôs.
- interesting that those who claim others r racist are ,in fact--the racists themselves--Projection, the tried&amp;true tool of the Democrat Party--sadly the whole lot is not smart enough 2 c that.  Keep talking Mr Biden--you're proving this out
We should be done.  If Biden does a bunch of harmful neoliberal shit, we should be just as ready to take to the streets against his ass as we would Trump.
More hope?  Look at what we have now? Future with Trump is dismal &amp; painful... when you‚Äôre down &amp; been kicked all you have is hope, to get back up &amp; fight back... that‚Äôs ‚ÄúBiden 2020‚Äù

i dont think im mentally prepared for liberal twitter to act like racism and bigotry has been defeated if biden wins in november
Evers did a point better in 2018 against Walker. He was able to win the Town of Vienna in northern Dane County. This is a Town that Biden will want to win come November as it would show improvement over Clinton in the rural areas around Madison. 4/5
The sixth region in my Wisconsin breakdown series is my home region, Dane County. There is probably room for Biden to grow here compared to 2016. While not the most Democratic region in the state, this is the most liberal region in the state.  1/5
Same here! I‚Äôm just wondering what the Democrats are really up to!  I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs hidin‚Äô Biden.  Do you Feisty?
You know what would help the Biden campaign? A statement that Biden doesn't like golf.

Thank you for saying this.  A certain faction of the dem party (you know who I mean) keep criticizing Biden now about his foreign policy team.  They say he needs more of them (you know who I mean).  Hell they think Nina Turner should be considered for VP (NOW you know who I mean)
Biden is partially correct - Black Americans are a single ethnic group but so are Afro-Brazilians, Afro-Cubans, Afro-Dominicans, Afro-Puerto Ricans. We‚Äôre all Black, but each ethnic group has unique culture. The problem with Biden is that he shouldn‚Äôt have brought Black people up
More energy is being directed at Biden‚Äôs response, you know the guy who lost a wife, a daughter and a son early, than on the idiocy and craven charge of the guy who makes the false ‚Äúallegation.‚Äù M‚Äôkay.
Biden understands that there are a lot of misconceptions about where he stands on this and would like to assure everyone that he believes in opportunity and hard-working teachers and first responders and doesn't think there's much diversity among black people in America.
Yea cause biden is so respectful to the black community
you're not worthy of ANY votes and every day they are getting fewer and fewer resulting in your complete mental breakdown yesterday. biden is going to hurt god? wtf donald?
That‚Äôs what you‚Äôll basically be doing. Joe Biden is terrible and it‚Äôs plain as day to see. Almost 4 years of nonstop scrutiny and outrage over every word uttered by Trump...and you pick Biden? It simply makes you a phony hypocrite.
Nothing to see here; Jim Crow Joe Biden is a white supremacist. I'll argue, he's been one for decades. His words and life's work prove it. üóë
I hear you but I know Biden will stop Republicans from stacking the courts. I know Biden is reachable. Trump ain‚Äôt shit ever in this life time. No redemption
Chrissy Teigen is in a close second to Biden in who is the most brain dead!
Poor sad Biden.  Hi dementia shows more each day.  I truly feel sorry for him
Let me be clear....Joe Biden did not write this tweet. He put his foot in his mouth, yet again, in the national spotlight. This is not an apology. Not even admitting what was said was wrong. Just his handlers trying to patch up what he broke.
Sure hope the Bible and g-d aren‚Äôt mad at me for sharing this . video about how Trump is a #Biblicalidiot.  Did he say Biden would hurt g-d???
Joe Biden picking a black woman as his VP will be a fatal wound to Trump‚Äôs re-election bid.
It means Joe Biden is racist.
All black people think the same because if you don‚Äôt support Biden you aint black
the fact that tr*mp is calling joe Biden ‚Äúsleepy joe Biden‚Äù is fucking hysterical to me...
BIDEN  ASKED BLACK MAN  TV HOST...ARE YOU A JUNKIE????  SOUNDS LIKE YOU ARE VERY VERY RACIST, JOE!!!!!üò±üò±üò±üòàüòàüòàüòàüòàüòàüòàüòàüòàüòàüòà
Oh, you gonna ride that one into today? Unlike you, Biden clarified his comment and continues the dialogue with the America people. You have no class and are unwilling to take responsibility for anything you say or do. I get how it would be hard for you to understand this.
Then why are democrats backing a completely senile Joe Biden?
Bull. He was on track to win the nomination.He swept the early primaries and the DNC panicked &amp; brought out the Big guns (Hillary, etc) to trash him.Biden‚Äôs campaign was broke and in the toilet before Clybourn and SC. Arm twisting to get Amy &amp; Pete to dropout and endorse Joe.
you have to say something we can‚Äôt let‚Äôs Biden speak like that the media don‚Äôt care about it !! You are the only one
The part where Biden is wrong isn‚Äôt to suggest that the Latinx community is incredibly diverse in political thought, the part where he‚Äôs wrong is to say Black people aren‚Äôt. There‚Äôs a long racist history of erasing black people‚Äôs politics, especially of the radical left kind.
If any never Trumper remains in the throes of moral turpitude about finding a reason to vote for Biden, remember that voting for #Trump's best opponent is by definition the best way to actualize the "Never  Trump" mission.  Step up to the Damn Plate and swing on 11/03!
well, Biden seemingly believes in slavery which is a-ok in the bible.
Biden won the primary because most white suburban libs are too polite to bring up racist crime statistics but too embarrassed to vote for a republican.Debating tRUMP is a joke. Here's how that will go tRUMP: a bunch of bullshit and lies Biden: thats false and a bunch of lies. And so on and so on.
Biden is portrayed as a familiar face and reliable statesman in contrast with the volatile Trump. In reality, he promises to be the most liberal president in history, writes
A candidate‚Äôs faith should have no impact on their electability. It certainly is not a relevant indicator of their ability to be a good/moral/ethical leader.  Who cares if Biden is more religious? He can‚Äôt govern based on his religion, so this is useless.
I would stand, sit, kneel, handstand if I could, headstand, lie on the concrete or in mud while swarms of hungry beetles chewed on my skin.  Rats could chew out my eyes, but I would find a way to vote for Biden.
Americans is not stupid.. they made a mistake 2016 , They are smart now.  Voting other Stupid to other stupid . can not win anymore! Biden for President!
You mean Dumb Donald or Joe Biden?
Kanye West Indicates That His Spoiler Campaign Is Indeed Designed To Hurt Biden
#Biden Yard Sign arrived today - YES - 88 Days till #2020Election
Ha ha ha ha you think white people are smart... (yes, I'm voting for Biden; I try NOT to be a flippin' idiot. And no, I'm not concerned about who his running-mate will be).
America please lets saved our family friends and loved ones and livelihood and future of our kids and our country  ! Biden for President!
To be fair, Biden hates Blacks.
Biden is not apologizing. He‚Äôs countering the accusations made by Trump. It‚Äôs Trump who should apologize for his remarks toward Biden. Shameful and disgusting.
Biden‚Äôs campaign advertising war chest is $100 billion of free ‚ÄúTrump is responsible for Coronavirus‚Äù every day until Nov. 3 by MSM. You but it you are one dumb ass:
If you elect Biden you will have $10 gasoline and won‚Äôt be able to blame the oil companies this time. You did it.
Biden trashes blacks. Media says it's OK, its just because he has Alzheimer's.  Give him the nuclear keys.
You got all that out of a tweet? Wow..all he was doing is pointing out Biden‚Äôs racism. The MSM won‚Äôt even cover these things.
Biden has mastered the art of culling his voting block.  #BidenIsARacist  #Biden2020
O look someone who hates Trump's perceived racism but will actually vote for actually racist Biden. Imagine my shock. A hypocritical leftist.
Biden announced that he looks forward to debating Trump - I'd like to see the follow through on that.
Biden is patriotic Americans. And you sabotage our life.. from economy and healthcare and now 160 k died and 5 millions got sick.
For anyone who texted the number Biden sent last night can you tell me who the running mate is please?
Saw a tweet from Jon Cooper that said several sources close to Biden say he chose his running mate if this is true and if it's Kamala Harris then I  am dancing like crazy and a potential dance party
If you don‚Äôt recognize Biden is in the latter stages of Alzheimer‚Äôs you may need to take a cognitive test.
And that Biden....a gifted orator right there right?
Donald Trump said Joe Biden wants to: "Hurt the bible, hurt God. He's against God..."  A guy who gassed protestors to use the bible and a church as props in a photo op said this.  Am I missing something?
Well if Biden decides to run for a 2nd term then yeah but there is a chance he may not run for re election in 2024
Voting for you President Biden is also a privilege....
Just had that conversation today with my Financial advisor. He and his wife were conflicted in 2016. We talked about what President Trump has accomplished and they are more comfortable voting for Trump. Played him the latest Biden statements
Biden signs are in his basement where he misplaced them. May never see him or the signs. But polls will show him ahead assuring no Democrats go to the polls.
Dems are Godless, and they like it that way.  They relish in it.  Biden will stand in front of The Man very soon and be judged for his lifetime of baby killing, lying, and coveting $ over morality.  Pretty easy to see, if your eyes are open.
The Biden charade May be ending as the MSM thought ‚Äúare you a junkie‚Äù was a little demented.
Biden also lied about the circumstances of the death of his first wife &amp; child. Talk about walking over the grave of loved ones.
We know and it is a distraction and Kayne will never be president majority of voters aren't suddenly going to switch from Biden to Kayne
He hates strong women i wouldn't mind if she got reappointed AG in a Biden administration she has some unfinished business to do and things that should have been done if Hillary won.
I don't think you want to debate Biden. It will not end pretty for you. Biden can still form and articulate a coherent thought.
Hoping to join the webinar town hall meeting w/ Dr Jill Biden... and we're waiting, we're waiting....
The NRA will be dissolved in 2021 once Biden becomes president and if Beto O Rouke becomes part of the Biden administration it would be amazing they fear him and know he is a threat to their existence.
He is one sick, pathetic, human scumbag...Biden has always been openly religious, and proud of it.
In light of Biden's stutter, I was going to give him a break, but then I remembered that he mocked a disabled reporter, so no. Shitheads who live in glass houses, etc.
Hahaha! Maybe deep faith but not deep thought.  Biden can‚Äôt find his way from the bedroom to the bathroom,  then spends 30‚Äô trying to find matching socks.
So people believe that every Covid death in the US is Trump‚Äôs fault.  Why not just blame him for every death in the world? That‚Äôs the height of stupidity. Jobs are coming back, stock market is near all time high. Biden should be in assisted living.
Trump says that Biden will hurt the Bible and God. Biden is a catholic that goes to church more times than Trump and his family ever will. The Trump's are fake Christians in reality they worship white supremacy.
Hold on a sec.  This means that, at least to this swing voter, Harris is a better choice for VP. I'm voting for Biden no matter what, but I agree about Rice not being a good choice.
"There is, for example, a massive difference between Kamala Harris and Susan Rice. For me, it‚Äôs likely the difference between Biden getting my vote and writing someone else in. Harris would have my vote. Rice would not." -Republican S.E. Cupp
Not a good internal at all. Safe R. I do think she could overperform Biden slightly.
When Biden speaks, stupid comes out.
Bozo could have lead us better through this pandemic then that clown sitting in 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. Yes, I have far more trust in Mr. Biden
Biden is too compromised to even figure out how to hide his now.
If history is any clue, it'll be "how much better it would have been if Biden had picked _______ for VP."
How insulting!! Where‚Äôs BLM in all this?! No response from them to Joe Biden?
Joe Biden launches new national ad aimed at Black Americans Joe Biden‚Äôs Democratic presidential campaign has launched a new national ad focused on Black Americans, urging them to stand up to
No, don‚Äôt vote for Kanye.  Voting for Kanye is exactly what Trump wants you to do, as it takes votes away from Biden.
It needs to be made public. Voters need to know BEFORE they election. They have the right to that information when they cast their votes. Why can‚Äôt we know if Biden or others were involved or looked the other way?
I hate that term. TRUMP makes me ill. We need you President Biden
Love your car President Biden
I propose that if neither Biden or Trump win decisively and fairly,  has to be the obvious interim president, no?
I hope it is the first thing to come down when Biden takes office. To me this act at the White house set the tone for much of what is going on. It is SHAMEFUL!
I am looking into early voting also. My dad voted for tRump on 2016 he is voting Biden but still is afraid of mail in voting. He has always voted at the polls (some things I can't changeüôÑ) so my friend and I thought of early voting make a day of it lunch ect...think it will fly
Must focus on who is actually gonna be the Dem nominee. I don‚Äôt believe for a second it‚Äôll really be Biden. How will the Dems pull it off? Get your popcorn.
Rumors are that Michelle Obama will be Biden‚Äôs VP choice. She announced today she is suffering a mild case of depression. Ticket could use a head case since Biden has none.
Biden will never debate
That Joe Biden??? üòÇ
Is there any chance that he would take votes away from Trump? Two delusional candidates, voters considering Biden would not be swayed by Kanye West.
We will be defending Biden and his VP for 4 years
This is why he‚Äôs not going to Milwaukee. He can‚Äôt handle live events - If he doesn‚Äôt go, his nomination acceptance can be pre-recorded, rehearsed and edited to make him look cognitively intact. Trump is going to destroy him in a debate without even trying. Biden fails after 5 min
Well i ain't dancing til Kamala Harris is Biden's VP running mate Trump's account is suspended and til Trump loses
Absolutely. We have been around the block &amp; can see what a total disaster Biden will be. He is hostage to the left. Schools need to be open. This is another hostage situation. Parents should be outraged. Grandparents may have to step in to a caretaker role so parents can work
When Biden starts wearing a bib with his mask will the public suspect he‚Äôs in the advanced stages of Alzheimer‚Äôs?
Biden will no longer travel to DNC to accept Democratic nomination amid pandemic Former Vice President Joe Biden and all convention speakers will not travel to Wisconsin
Biden‚Äôs supporters are peppered with anti-semites, fascists and communists bent on destroying this country. Quit pretending otherwise
It's not a stupid question because I think Biden is in cognitive decline and this proves even more.
Joe Biden's basement strategy will backfire: Goodwin
You lie so easily, I see why you would like to be Biden's running mate.
DNC has some work to do . Renounce Joe Biden .
According to fivethirtyeight the polling averages for the south like Texas and Florida are narrowing Biden is very close to losing his lead in Texas again and Florida has swung 1% in Trump's favor this isn't good news but polling data in rust belt is looking better for Biden.
We will vote for Biden for President.  Thank you Madam  . nobody believed on you 2016 .. now economy crashed and 150 k died and. 4 M sick . Very sad!  Biden for President!!
Trump's campaign knocks on a million doors a week. Biden's knocks on zero.
I think Biden has already committed to a black woman as running mate.
Of course Biden‚Äôs health etc., should be examined as should Trump‚Äôs. Biden is older than I‚Äôd like him, but Trump is just a few years back of him.
Everything Biden has done he takes responsibility for. A lot of good but also some bad.   As for Trump....
I can‚Äôt speak on things I haven‚Äôt seen, but I‚Äôve have noticed Fox using footage of Biden consoling his grandchildren at his son‚Äôs funeral and describing it as ‚Äúgroping‚Äù. But that‚Äôs Fox for you.
Our brand new poll #'s:  MICHIGAN Trump: 40.3% Biden: 51.3% Change from June: Trump +6.5 percentage points  WISCONSIN Trump: 37.9% Biden: 50.3% Change from June: Trump +4.2 percentage points  PENNSYLVANIA Trump: 44.3% Biden: 49.7% Change from June: Trump +6.3 percentage points
There‚Äôs nothing wrong with Biden. His issue is on occasion is the stutter he‚Äôs had since childhood comes up. This is what Republicans cruelly and deliberately say is dementia. Meanwhile Trump slurs his words and reads at a second grade level.

Revolutionary Communist Party USA Leader Endorses Biden for President
commercial idea. Use an empty chair for Biden, then debate it with Biden clips as his answers.
Susan Rice, on Biden‚Äôs VP shortlist, was Obama‚Äôs national security advisor
Arizona now likely democratic pickup same goes with Colorado and Maine those 3 give us control if Biden wins if Biden loses we will need 4 seats
If she is named I am going to be dancing like crazy then the dancing will get crazier and more frequent after Biden wins

Biden committed to picking a women for VP nice try
That's a very good sign the polling average have Biden up by 6 points and if there are really this many Biden signs in Trump County then those polls will be spot on
Little does he realize that if Florida flips and Biden wins 1 more swing state that's the end of Trump's chances of reelection forever

Michiganders you still have time to vote i recommend voting for Brenda Jones since she is an ally of Biden where her opponent has refused to endorse Biden and booed Hillary during 1 of her rallies.
Yes Florida and 1 more swing state gives Biden the presidency if Biden wins Texas that alone ends Trump's chances of getting re elected
On New Voter Registration in Key States, Trump is Blowing Biden Out of the Water
These numbers are not accurate. We have not released them yet. Please take down this tweet.
Biden is
Only Biden has been wrong more than Fauci. It took Biden 51 years to reach that number- Fauci did it in 6 months.
Let me see... do those letters stand for "asshole" and "Biden" by any chance?
Mr. Biden is under no obligation to debate someone who has no compunction about lying.
Gm everyone Happy Tuesday everyone today is primary day in several states like Michigan please vote today whether that's in person or mail in voting. Today we must elect people like Brenda Jones and replace democrats who refuse to endorse Biden and replace them.
President Trump looses the endorsement of the Revolutionary Communist Party USA. The communist party has given their endorsement to Joe (Mr. Magoo) Biden.
Looking like Biden will not be alive on Election Day. Not eating . Sign of late stage dementia as body shuts down.
you‚Äôre acting like we like Biden?? üòÉ
How does a candidate not debate? Biden deserves to lose!
Biden took the lead in Texas according to fivethirtyeight on polling data at July 28th it has been 6 days since Biden has taken the lead there and it hasn't shrunk or grown and he hasn't lost the lead which is a very good sign for us. If Biden wins Texas he wins the election
Tomorrow we must elect Brenda Jones and replace Rashida Tlaib for refusing to endorse Joe Biden and for booing Hillary Clinton in one of her speeches. If democrats want to oust Trump they must have every vote if people refuse to endorse Biden and vote 3rd party they not democrats
Possibly. Brown lost it by about 5% while winning statewide by 7%, but Biden may do worse than Brown in some Ancestral D counties and will have to make up that strength in suburban areas. I'd rate it Lean R for president.
Moot point for me. I will vote for President Trump. If any candidate refuses to debate I will not vote for them. So yes if President Trump canceled the debate then I won‚Äôt vote for him. Never gonna happen. Would love to see President Trump show up, Biden no show Perfect contrast
Biden would have a better chance then.
Biden is a BABY MURDERER. Trump is a BABY RESCUER. Sorry, but it‚Äôs true. If you support Biden, you are as bad as him.
Good news for Biden, especially if the Libertarians do indeed qualify.
I don‚Äôt see any Biden signs in my Western suburbs. Chicago would have been a Bernie win. The Senate race will be interesting. Wille Wilson could be a spoiler &amp; divert votes from Durbin in Chicago.
Why would Biden supporters come to see you? Huh? We can‚Äôt wait for the time when you exit WH and go directly first to federal and then state prisons.
SD may be a better choice for "Likely R in massive Biden landslide scenario"
Things the media wants me to believe:  Bill Clinton was scuba diving on Epstine‚Äôs Island   Joe Biden isn‚Äôt deep into Alzheimer‚Äôs.  Dr. Fauci is a scientist.   Nadler was actually elected somewhere
If you like kneelers you will probably love Biden‚Äôs likely VP choice.
representation of voting for biden or trump
Biden will bring this to your doorstep.
We have to keep up work &amp; highlight the dangers of a Biden win. They want us to believe that Biden has an insurmountable lead. It‚Äôs not true.
Michigan and 1 more swing state and Biden is president
Once Biden picks his female running mate, can people please refer to her by her last name; unless they‚Äôve been calling him Joe, which they haven‚Äôt.
Mr. Biden is under no obligation to debate someone who has no compunction about lying.
Biden in the IL primary, when it was just Sanders v Biden at that point.
Biden for President!  Full stop!
He fixed the shit Obama and Biden didn‚Äôt or did.
No offense to Sen. Warren, but Biden/Dead Dog Carcass would still get my vote. No, I don't have a problem with Warren in the #2 slot, although I think she will do more good in the Senate.
‚ÄòHating Joe Biden doesn‚Äôt juice up their base‚Äô: Key swing state slips away from Trump ‚Äî POLITICO ‚ÄúJoe Biden ‚Äî his party is not in power ‚Äî so just by definition, he‚Äôs the candidate of change. That‚Äôs a huge advantage,‚Äù said Democratic Sen. Bob...
I am with Biden on most everything
Yes with God's grace president Biden's administration will save our nation.
We need you president Biden
A few months of Biden in charge and people will be begging for Trump.  He will destroy the economy, our way of life.  An unmitigated disaster
Biden calls for 100 percent clean electricity by 2035. Here‚Äôs how far we have to go.
Biden's lead in Texas is still holding according to fivethirtyeight he's had the lead on average polling data for 4 days now longer than last time let's hope his lead holds and expands on election day. If Biden wins Texas Trump's hopes of getting reelected are gone
üíØ everyone needs to put their differences to the side and vote for Biden IDC if Bernie lost the primary he will never be president he unfit to be president just like Trump

Biden is probably going to win. His presidency is going to be a disaster, and in 2024 America is going to elect someone many times worse than Trump. You aren't averting any kind of catastrophe by supporting Biden. He's the wetnurse of fascism.
Biden is too stupid to know what that is.
I haven‚Äôt seen that.  But I have seen plenty of hatred directed at Warren, AOC, Harris, Biden.  I‚Äôve also seen things like this:  Frazier, 29, got out of his truck and repeatedly punched a 61-year-old anti-Trump protester in the head outside a Trump rally in Cincinnati, Ohio.
IIRC, nowhere is it explicitly stated that the Pres Pro Tem must be a Senator. If true, the remaining seated Senators could chose whomever... President Biden? Madame President Clinton? Madame President Obama? That would clear out another seat when Ted Cruz's head explodes.

William Evanina, director of the National Counterintelligence and Security Center. Evanina ultimately acknowledged that Russia is again trying to boost President Donald Trump‚Äôs reelection and denigrate his opponent, the presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden. #NotAgain #BLM
These Sanders supporters want to destroy the democratic party. They claim to want to reform it but they have twice been rejected by rank and file dem voters. And now they want to prevent us from receiving PAC money. Join the DSA and fuck off.
Hopefully all this idiocy will cost him the election. I can‚Äôt stand Biden either, but even Biden is FDR compared to Trump.
I know he‚Äôs competent, intelligent and thoroughly decent, and that he‚Äôs a patriot as opposed to a criminal and a grifter. He‚Äôs been a public servant for 40+ years, 8 of them as VP. If you don‚Äôt know enough about Joe Biden at this point, that‚Äôs on you.
How could jobs disappear more or the market crash more (we just dropped the most in 1 qtr in history)? Trump has killed both 152,000 people and our economy. Biden will stop the killing and job loss.
Yeah, all those Trump Chinese trademarks will really irk President Biden
What Happened to Stacey Abrams Will Happen to Joe Biden
Being the President of the USA is a tough job.  Joe Biden can be only the President of the nursing home.  Sad but true.
Every single person that is backing Biden has to be mentally insane. This man doesn‚Äôt even know what he‚Äôs doing, what day it is, what his agenda is, and y‚Äôall want him as commander in chief? Pretty scary if you ask me....
Joe Biden? Is that you?
Trying to guess Joe Biden's vp pick like
TikTok was bad enough for Biden to ban it amongst his campaign staffers.
I'm done listening/reading VP chatter. Biden will make his choice and that will be that. Enough with the noise.
Had a dream last night that Ayo was raising the National Championship trophy and while on the court he got a call from President Biden. He told him his story inspired millions of kids especially in Illinois. ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èseems plausible, right? #Illini
When talking about Biden‚Äôs VP nothing was mentioned why Biden cannot choose Warren. Warren a great talent but can cause the Democrats to lose the Senate in November. If Biden chooses Warren , the Republican Governor of Mass. will replace her with a new Republican Senator.
Most Americans Are Buying Into President Trump's False Arguments About Crime   Crime IS a problem, but here's trump saying Biden will make it worse, when our current situation is completely on HIS watch.
Because trump has to get twenty times more airtime than Biden
I'm voting for Biden regardless of his VP choice.  However, given the campaigning restrictions necessary because of COVID, selecting someone with a certain degree of name recognition would be helpful. It's the whole "a heartbeat away from the presidency" thing.

What funeral? The divisive Obama Biden political rally?!
Corruption is open and visible, but Democrat voters do't seem to catch on?  Hunter Biden made 411 trips to 29 foreign countries, during Biden's 1st five yrs as VP?  Five of those trips to China.  No trips to Ukraine Energy Co. who paid him 1M a yr, to "not show up?"
More than half of them don't want him reelected, and he loses more support in congress and in the senate each day. There's no surprise that the Lincoln project is doing so well and gaining so much revenue and turning moderate Republicans over to Biden.
I thought there was 1 Trump channel and 2 Biden channels on cable.
Joe Biden knew all along. We have under 100 days left to ensure he wins and restores the soul of America. What will you do today to help?
Told you, they will pick a far left vice president and if Biden wins he will be declared incompetant and the Vice Pres will take over where Vp had zero chance if running as pres
Joe Biden? Is that you???
Same here, I hope her early confrontation with Biden isn't held against her, all the other candidates eventually piled on in their attacks against Biden, didn't they?
It‚Äôs nice to see that you are settling on Biden. A completely incompetent candidate. Scary actually. Not only do u support killing unborn children, you also want to see the demise of the US under failed democratic policies. Must be nice to watch from the sidelines in Spain.
Just saw a commercial for  where that #idiot  was making fun of Trump for stumbling over his words... just wondering if you've ever heard Biden talk? #Trump2020
Joe Biden is going to be the President of the nursing home... no doubt.
Yes. If we had competency at the federal level we wouldn‚Äôt be banned from traveling to the majority of the world. 150,000 people are dead. Mitch and CO and giving money to companies and military while people are being evicted and dying. So yes. Biden will 100% be better.
And the CBC love them some Joe Biden. He was always my first choice.

And Biden is the answer? That is absolutely ridiculous. America needs Trump more than ever. Biden can‚Äôt even put coherent sentences together.
Agreed. He'll need something like a separate commission because Congress will be too busy. Every Republican is complicit in every crime committed by Trump.   Makes me nervous even talking about Biden definitively winning. The GOP will cheat, lie, suppress the vote, etc.

BIDEN RUNNING MATE: 23 News Weekend Anchor Courtney Sisk spoke with local politicians and experts to break down Biden's VP selection.
I hope Biden picks  as his running mate.
WHO WILL HE CHOOSE? Elections are just three months away, and Biden is set to announce his running mate. Local experts break it down. Who do you think he will pick? Let us know in the comments.
What if Joe Biden is nothing?
Biden needs a little more than 1 day. üëç
True, but it has noting to do with his current decline in verbal fluency. Biden was much more eloquent in the past and has lost quite a bit in recent years.
Where is Biden's family ? Do they not see he needs help. Obama has him programmed for major failure. So sad.
It‚Äôs Americans that can‚Äôt travel. Any civilized nation should keep us out until Biden starts to heal us physically and emotionally
Does Joe Biden know where he is?
WATCH: President Donald Trump accused former Vice President Joe Biden of wanting to "hurt God" during a stop in Ohio on Thursday.
Harris was a distraction. Rice is Obama's choice. Biden never had a vote. Left is as left goes.
Exactly,  trump wants Kanye to take black votes away from Biden so trump wins. QUESTION how can Kanye be able to enter the presidential race 3 months to voting. Is this not illegal?
I was never a Biden fan, but he‚Äôs now suffering from dementia.  It‚Äôs horrible to see the Dems using him in their political game.
Stop telling false things about Biden, when trump is finally removed from the W.H. what's gonna happen to some of you. Joe Biden is a good and honest man, what is trump?
Kanye West did not break from trump, he is being allowed to jump right in the presidential race to help trump beat Joe Biden. This should not be allowed 3 months before the election. He he asking Key States to sign him up so he can help trum Someone should check on this #illegal
Kanye West should not be able to jump in the 2020 presidential race 3 months before Voting just to help trump steal black Votes from Joe Biden. This should not be allowed to happen. What else has trump planned to cheat at, he just can't do anything the right way. Lie &amp; Cheat!!!
WATCH: Biden Says He Wouldn't Stand In The Way Of A Trump Prosecution  #p2 #tcot #TrumpVirus üëç
Can the Dems please bring in   already. What they are doing to Joe Biden is cruel!
Kanye West is not stable enough to be president, trump is using Kanye to try and steal enough black votes from Biden so trump will win. 3 months before an election Kanye decides to jump in. How can that be because trump is the republican runner up. This is an Illegal Set Up.
If Kanye really wanted to seriously run for President he would of had to go against trump to see which one got the nomination. Kanye is only out to take black votes from Biden so trump would win That's how they are thinking. #VoteBlueToEndThisNightmare
Since Kanye decided to jump in the Presidential Race 3 months before Voting on Nov 3rd this is why trump is complaining about Mail In Voting. It sounds like trump &amp; west have a thing going on West wants to take black votes from Biden so Biden won't win
So the republicans just want Kanye so he can take black votes from Biden. If Kanye West really wanted to run for President he would of been in the race from the beginning, this is just a set up between trump and kanye to do just that.

Joe Biden grabs kids inappropriately, smells their hair, asked a little girl her age and  was shocked to hear the girl is 6 and not 17. He also also been caught saying the n word, many derogatory comments.  He is homophobic, openly admits doesn‚Äôt like gay marriage.
So we got this fucking dumbass and we got the other fucking dumbass. Fuck Donald Trump and fuck Joe Biden. I can't wait for the debate so I can laugh when someone else tells me to vote for either of them. üôÑ

Biden is portrayed as a familiar face and reliable statesman in contrast with the volatile Trump. In reality, he promises to be the most liberal president in history, writes
A candidate‚Äôs faith should have no impact on their electability. It certainly is not a relevant indicator of their ability to be a good/moral/ethical leader.  Who cares if Biden is more religious? He can‚Äôt govern based on his religion, so this is useless.
I would stand, sit, kneel, handstand if I could, headstand, lie on the concrete or in mud while swarms of hungry beetles chewed on my skin.  Rats could chew out my eyes, but I would find a way to vote for Biden.

You got all that out of a tweet? Wow..all he was doing is pointing out Biden‚Äôs racism. The MSM won‚Äôt even cover these things.

O look someone who hates Trump's perceived racism but will actually vote for actually racist Biden. Imagine my shock. A hypocritical leftist.
Biden announced that he looks forward to debating Trump - I'd like to see the follow through on that.
Biden is patriotic Americans. And you sabotage our life.. from economy and healthcare and now 160 k died and 5 millions got sick.
If only Biden would leave his basement!
And that Biden....a gifted orator right there right?
Keep up with your faith President Biden, God is still in control.
Why lie about it. Our 2 amendment rights not going anywhere.  Joe Biden just want assault guns to go away along with you. We all want you to go away! NRA are thieves like you. They just need to give up the non profit status. They are stealing &amp; not pay their fair share of taxes
Just had that conversation today with my Financial advisor. He and his wife were conflicted in 2016. We talked about what President Trump has accomplished and they are more comfortable voting for Trump. Played him the latest Biden statements
Once again, Trump is calling himself God!
Dems are Godless, and they like it that way.  They relish in it.  Biden will stand in front of The Man very soon and be judged for his lifetime of baby killing, lying, and coveting $ over morality.  Pretty easy to see, if your eyes are open.
The Republican Party...  Does not care if doctors and nurses die.  Does not care if essential workers die.  Does not care if old people die.  Does not care if teachers die.  Does not care if your children die.  And does not care about you.  Vote them out.  89 days to go.  #Biden
Biden also lied about the circumstances of the death of his first wife &amp; child. Talk about walking over the grave of loved ones.
I don't think you want to debate Biden. It will not end pretty for you. Biden can still form and articulate a coherent thought.

Oh I think 45 just made a mistake here. Joe Biden is a REAL Catholic. Trump may have just alienated more than a few voters.
I have decided that Covid restrictions were all designed to keep Biden away from the public as much as possible.  When restrictions started to ease, Trump did a couple speeches. Biden, I don't think, can stand up to scrutiny,  so we're all back in jail. üôÑ
Trump attacks Biden's Catholic faith: 'He is against the Bible'
Hahaha! Maybe deep faith but not deep thought.  Biden can‚Äôt find his way from the bedroom to the bathroom,  then spends 30‚Äô trying to find matching socks.
So people believe that every Covid death in the US is Trump‚Äôs fault.  Why not just blame him for every death in the world? That‚Äôs the height of stupidity. Jobs are coming back, stock market is near all time high. Biden should be in assisted living.
Given trump‚Äôs proclivity towards Norway, I think he (trump) means Odin.  Am guessing Biden‚Äôs response would be, if said in public, ‚Äòwut?‚Äô

Biden didn't destroy the NRA when he was Vice President for 8 years, Donnie.  Neither did Obama. In other, far more accurate words,        STOP GASLIGHTING!
He doesnt mind it because West is trying to pull votes from Biden. Kanye West needs to be indicted and imprisoned on the charge Impersonating a human being
Normally during debates each candidate gets a general topic list so they have an idea  of what to prepare. Just ask Biden &amp; Trump to recite their favorite passage and say where its from. Trump would fail even with prep work
Another delusional post. Congrats.  Biden 2020
Bozo could have lead us better through this pandemic then that clown sitting in 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. Yes, I have far more trust in Mr. Biden
Biden is too compromised to even figure out how to hide his now.
They're going to pull a bait and switch.  They're using Biden for election, but if, God forbid he got elected,  his DNC picked running mate would be pres. All the more reason to keep President Trump in office.
How insulting!! Where‚Äôs BLM in all this?! No response from them to Joe Biden?
YOU. Are. The. Swamp.  Biden in 2020!
It needs to be made public. Voters need to know BEFORE they election. They have the right to that information when they cast their votes. Why can‚Äôt we know if Biden or others were involved or looked the other way?
I propose that if neither Biden or Trump win decisively and fairly,  has to be the obvious interim president, no?
As President Trump has made mental health a campaign topic, former Vice President Joe Biden appeared to scoff when a CBS correspondent asked if he has taken a cognitive test. CBS News' Errol Barnett, who asked Biden the question, explains.
This is why he‚Äôs not going to Milwaukee. He can‚Äôt handle live events - If he doesn‚Äôt go, his nomination acceptance can be pre-recorded, rehearsed and edited to make him look cognitively intact. Trump is going to destroy him in a debate without even trying. Biden fails after 5 min
Absolutely. We have been around the block &amp; can see what a total disaster Biden will be. He is hostage to the left. Schools need to be open. This is another hostage situation. Parents should be outraged. Grandparents may have to step in to a caretaker role so parents can work
Biden has had a slight stuttering problem his whole life. Has absolutely nothing to do with his intelligence. Come up with something new Jr.
What about this, Donnie? Is this Biden's fault too?  Pfft.
Whether debates between trump and Biden are advisable depends very much on the moderators.

On New Voter Registration in Key States, Trump is Blowing Biden Out of the Water
These numbers are not accurate. We have not released them yet. Please take down this tweet.
A lot of people are saying that it would be worth it!
Biden will improve health care
One of the most important immediate tasks facing Joe Biden will be remedying our gigantic healthcare nightmare.
BIDEN  NEEDS  TO BE IN  A NURSING  HOME  DUHHHHHH  HEY  DUMBACRATS  WHAT IS YOUR GAME  HERE??????  THATS  RIGHT  FEMALE BLACK VP  THEN  BIDEN TO A NURSING  HOME?  NEVER  HAPPEN  CAUSE  HE  WILL NOT  GET  ELECTED  BYE BYE  DUMMIES.....
President Trump looses the endorsement of the Revolutionary Communist Party USA. The communist party has given their endorsement to Joe (Mr. Magoo) Biden.
you‚Äôre acting like we like Biden?? üòÉ
That commercial is the stupidest political commercial in the history of political commercials. Biden should use it!
He's Russia's "useful idiot". Be careful, they'll soon start up an internet campaign of bots and misinformation to create doubt about Biden and the election process. They'll coach Trump on what to say to parallel that process. It will be much worse than what they did in 2016.
Biden doesn't need to debate that your daddy is a failure. Your daddy is a failure, Junior.  You of all people should know that.  Bless your heart.
Moot point for me. I will vote for President Trump. If any candidate refuses to debate I will not vote for them. So yes if President Trump canceled the debate then I won‚Äôt vote for him. Never gonna happen. Would love to see President Trump show up, Biden no show Perfect contrast
Junior, your father is the worst president in American history. The Trump name will be forever remembered as the name of grifters, liars and cheats. It already means "fart" in England.   The sooner the SDNY gets a hold of your family the better.   Biden will win in a landslide.
Biden would have a better chance then.
Biden is a BABY MURDERER. Trump is a BABY RESCUER. Sorry, but it‚Äôs true. If you support Biden, you are as bad as him.
I don‚Äôt see any Biden signs in my Western suburbs. Chicago would have been a Bernie win. The Senate race will be interesting. Wille Wilson could be a spoiler &amp; divert votes from Durbin in Chicago.
Why would Biden supporters come to see you? Huh? We can‚Äôt wait for the time when you exit WH and go directly first to federal and then state prisons.
representation of voting for biden or trump
Biden and his campaign know that all they need to do to win the election is let Trump talk.
We have to keep up work &amp; highlight the dangers of a Biden win. They want us to believe that Biden has an insurmountable lead. It‚Äôs not true.
Once Biden picks his female running mate, can people please refer to her by her last name; unless they‚Äôve been calling him Joe, which they haven‚Äôt.
Biden for President!  Full stop!
Our. Best. Days. Are. Yet. To. Come.   Vote for Joe Biden on November 3.  (and yes, I endorse this message)
‚ÄòHating Joe Biden doesn‚Äôt juice up their base‚Äô: Key swing state slips away from Trump ‚Äî POLITICO ‚ÄúJoe Biden ‚Äî his party is not in power ‚Äî so just by definition, he‚Äôs the candidate of change. That‚Äôs a huge advantage,‚Äù said Democratic Sen. Bob...
Yeah, I‚Äôm not sure what that means??? Was he calling Trump a pedophile or Biden?
A few months of Biden in charge and people will be begging for Trump.  He will destroy the economy, our way of life.  An unmitigated disaster
Biden calls for 100 percent clean electricity by 2035. Here‚Äôs how far we have to go.
Has it occurred to anyone that if Joe Biden knew who he is and what he claims to stand for, Joe Biden might actually endorse Trump?
Dudes statement is just as nonsensical as Biden talking about Trump is America's first racist president. Stop lying about history
Bill‚Äôs hunkering down with Biden trying to hash out a plan to redirect the public‚Äôs attention.
Sure thing, Donnie. How's the golf game?  How many more rounds before Biden trounces you in November? Quick, how many Americans died from COVID-19 yesterday? Do you even care?
Get your senile candidate out of the basement! üòÅ If you are voting Biden, I would suggest you have your own cognitive skills tested.
Ohh yes that Skunk Biden too, he is part of this whole sweeping theft of Trillions too.
Make America great by voting for Joe Biden unfortunately not Bernie Sanders
LOL We've got a deadly global pandemic that Trump utterly failed at, racial equality protests all over the nation and an economy in the toilet with 11% unemployment, but sure, blame Biden. LOL
Ohh Biden too, the skunk is nothing but your bro.
Unlike tRump, Biden would prefer to NOT choose someone who is a potential FELON...
Being led around by a nurse isn't helping.  I see his yard signs have changed from Biden to ByeDon. Is this their way of opening the nomination?
You mean Trumps downfall. Biden actually thinks about his answers. Trump just keeps throwing adjectives at the question until he forgets the question
Biden will
There's no reason to try to convince people in blue states to vote Biden. And post November, the Democrats will give you something else to work towards instead of what they are doing wrong or how to hold them more accountable. Education not elections.
Almost every option is better than Trump and the Republicans. But the only viable option is Biden and the Democrats. But we need better climate policy, M4A and an end to our endless wars, NSA spying etc. Dems aren't offering that. And they won't till something forces them to.
50% of eligible voters don't. We actually deserve a dictatorship. Yes, Biden is better than Trump. But please do more to make this democracy work well than beg people to vote blue over red every election.
Trump has ridiculed the health of Hillary Clinton &amp; Biden. No sympathy from me if he had a stroke
Biden is probably going to win. His presidency is going to be a disaster, and in 2024 America is going to elect someone many times worse than Trump. You aren't averting any kind of catastrophe by supporting Biden. He's the wetnurse of fascism.
I haven‚Äôt seen that.  But I have seen plenty of hatred directed at Warren, AOC, Harris, Biden.  I‚Äôve also seen things like this:  Frazier, 29, got out of his truck and repeatedly punched a 61-year-old anti-Trump protester in the head outside a Trump rally in Cincinnati, Ohio.
You do that. Biden 2020
Joe Biden has proposed tax increases of more than $3 trillion over a decade. Here‚Äôs a look at the unfine print. Biden is coming for everything you own.
He really can‚Äôt. Not before the election. It would be red meat for Biden and the libs. But he can try other ways to shut his ass down.
If you honestly think voting in Biden is going to change things and not be more of the exact same shit, please tell me why.
I would literally crawl over a mile of broken glass to vote for Joe Biden. There's nothing anyone could say or do to change my mind!
Probably around February if Biden wins.
Under Trump the US has never been safe!

No one loves you for anything except maybe pedophiles that need help staying out of jail. Don't worry you and the rest of the freaks and criminals are going to jail once we have a real president. His name is Biden. Are your internal polls written in crayon?  FAILURE
They creating too much excuses.. in fact they are the one doing fraud scheme. Old tricks! They want to create other Wikileaks but sorry.. President Biden 2020!

Moms are for Biden. Sit down.
It was always going to be one. John Lewis hated Trump. He probably gave instructions, however, Biden can‚Äôt speak so they had bring in the ???? team.
Joe Biden is not currently in government. Why don't you write a crime bill?
You are the dad of the coronavirus!  Sick! We found the vaccine.President. Biden on Nov.3!
Meanwhile your former campaign staffers are begging your followers to not vote Biden on social media.
That‚Äôs true, but open borders are considered a more left wing thing and opening schools at this point is a right wing thing, so in trying to promote Trump they are just making him look like an idiot while Joe Biden looks at least fine by comparison. But yeah it‚Äôs a total strawman
Cain didn‚Äôt die in vain.  His death sends a loud and clear message to Americans to vote Biden.
Gonna be a landslide, Donnie. Biden is going to trounce you. Be prepared for a YUGE republican loss in November.
You are terrified. Biden can‚Äôt even walk out of an event without a caretaker.
Where Does Joe Biden Go to Get His Apology? - The Bulwark
Hey Ari, are you going to post a follow-up, apologizing to Joe Biden?  That's what an honest man would do. Just saying.
A vote for biden is a vote for whoever he picks as a running mate basically. God Help Us if he wins-Heaven forbid.
What year is it in the mind of Joe Biden? 2041?
Joe Biden supported the war in Iraq, which killed at least 500,000 people directly and many more indirectly. That's about 20,000 Bundys
Joe Biden for President 2020. In my opinion, Trump's all ready lost. He is losing big time in the general election. Trump needs to resign.
Biden for President 2020. Let's see who will win in November. Trump's all ready lost based on how he's handled everything recently. Trump is currently losing in the general election. Deal with that.
"I don't want my kids growing up in a jungle, a racial jungle" -Joe Biden, 1977, talking about desegregation
I understand your pitch, but you're not going to convince me that Biden isn't a white supremacist.
I‚Äôm watching Tucker Carlson now playing some clips of Biden.  For God‚Äôs sake the man is not in control of his faculties.  He‚Äôs not remotely qualified to be president
Why wouldn‚Äôt anyone mention the fact the Joe Biden is named in a criminal investigation in the Ukraine. Why wouldn‚Äôt the Senate want to look into that?
I would not worry about NATO. A President Biden will undo the harm. In February 2021, we need a full investigation into the Trump/Putin disaster. Thanks Anthony for standing up to Trump. Maybe you can help rebuild the Republican party.
The fact that Team Biden has been unabashedly citing ‚Äúthat girl was me‚Äù as a serious reason why they don‚Äôt want Kamala should tell you a lot about the petty clowns running the show.
It originates with this  article. So many of these outlandish claims could be dealt with early on if we had a norm of discourse, that we expected extreme claims to subject themselves to the public dialogue of experts before either side spread them.
How many points do you think Biden's VP choice could swing his current lead over Trump in either direction?  Is 5 % points in play here, given this will likely be the defacto Dem nominee in 2024? #ithinkthatsright
If Kamala is the VP choice, imagine her vs Pence‚Äôldick‚Äô in a debate?   Forget about Biden v Trump...that‚Äôs the undercard.That's exactly why I am not watching that crap. I have no desire to see Kamala Harris and Elizabeth Warren or even Joe Biden and his VP speak.   I don't give a fock about the convention.
Yes I agree, but how can we convince people to get out and vote? Russia is working on tRump‚Äôs behalf by denigrating Biden and sowing seeds of doubt about the election.
It will be Susan Rice who has a really good working relationship with Joe. Kamala Harris attacked Biden. She's too ambitious And will try to overshadow Joe, which won't be hard. Harris would be willing declare Joe incompetent just to be president. #NeverKamala
Joe Biden is the obvious presidential candidate to lead our country!!!!!
I don‚Äôt have a problem with honest criticism, but so much of the attacks on Biden seem utterly contrived and propagandistic.
I am with you but Biden will make it even harder for me to vote for him if he picks Kamala Harris or Elizabeth Warren. I might have to get drunk and stoned before I fill out my ballot if they are on it.
just because biden says he will DOESNT MEAN HE'LL DO IT
Obama fucked up by not endorsing AOC. I don't think I can vote for Biden now. I am totally over these neo-lib corporate class Democrats.
Get caught up with the morning's top headlines, the national weather forecast, today's celebrity birthdays and more.

Joe Biden has a big heart and an addled brain.
Aw crap. I didn't even know this was possible. If Biden stops talking in public, he's going to get elected, and then we're screwed. I'll miss God and the Bible. And guns... wait, does this count airsoft?
I will hold my nose and vote for Joe Biden as long as his VP isn't Kamala Harris or Elizabeth Warren. I don't care what anyone thinks of me because of my refusal to vote for Biden if he picks either of those two women.
I'm in the same mind set. I will hold my nose and vote for Joe Biden as long as the VP isn't Kamala Harris or Elizabeth Warren. And I don't care what anyone thinks of me because of my refusal to vote for Biden if he picks either of those two women.
Oh trust me... I have never said any candidate is non flawed!! But if any other politician had said what Biden has over the last few days .. it would be headlines ... but it‚Äôs crickets
Oh and I am sure that Biden personally wrote the tweet or even told someone what to write!! Really? You heard this interview didn‚Äôt you? You heard his tone ? And how he spoke to the reporter ? We have a President who speaks for himself and owns it!! #CheckItOut
Ummmm you actually believe that Biden copped to this ??? Now that‚Äôs funny!! And because you believe it... you are part the problem!! SMH
If Biden is faking his dementia. how does he get his eyes to appear dead, zombie-like?  Are you saying he faked his two brain aneurysms also?
So, according to Mr Bunder Biden, ALL BLACK PEOPLE ARE THE SAME! No diversity exists among them? It wasn‚Äôt long ago he touted this insult:‚ÄùIf you ain‚Äôt black you ain‚Äôt voting Democrat‚Äù.
Where does he go after this with his smears? What‚Äôs worse than God hates Biden?
How does he escalate this? Biden can blow up the planet with just one look?
But don‚Äôt tell us what Biden said about Blacks this morning.  Probably not important to you but maybe to a lot of blacks
The dead people that will vote for Biden won‚Äôt care what happens in the debate
From CNN: Fact check: Trump ad edits out microphone and trees from Biden photo to make him seem alone in basement Fact check: Trump ad edits out microphone and trees from Biden photo to make him seem alone in basement (Trump tries everything )
Today, if you can't decide between Joe Biden and Pres. Trump, stay home on Nov 3.
You‚Äôre not concerned about Biden at all? Like not even a percent? Have you seen... anything he said? Let‚Äôs go back years upon years ago when his brain was fine and he said ‚ÄúWe already have a nigger mayor, we don‚Äôt need another nigger big shot‚Äù. Why on earth is that okay with u??
All the things you just mentioned will definitely happen when Biden's radical woke progressive leftist female PoC VP becomes President the first week after Biden is sworn into office.
He's the best the Dems could nominate in order to secure the Black vote.  Because if you don't vote for Biden then "you ain't Black!"
That looks like Trump mocking someone in a debate.  If he and Biden end up debating (and I think it's doubtful) then we'll probably get to see much more of this when Biden stumbles all over himself.
I apologize if I sound angry, but I'm so tired of people picking on Bernie. I'm disappointed that they conspired against him and crushed His campaign. But I in no way blame him for anything. I am sick and tired of people trashing Bernie for Trying to work with Biden.
I don't give a crap about either Biden or Trump.
This has been the only sign I‚Äôve see supporting trump but it‚Äôs spelt trunp.  Quad cities not looking great.   #Trump #trunp #Biden
Biden is an elderly man who had two brain aneurysms in 1988. One on the left side, one on the right side. Long-term affects of aneurysms include mental confusion and trouble articulating words. Maybe it‚Äôs not dementia, but the result of a ‚Äúsilent stroke(s)‚Äù
I mean to be fair I‚Äôd have a similar stance of opinion on what I said if it were Biden, or Sanders, or Elizabeth Warren, getting interviewed in such a disrespectful and badgering manner. It‚Äôs just plain bad journalism.
Biden leads by 40 points ü§°ü§°ü§°
It seems likely that the Republicans are trying to draw Biden out by making it seem like he‚Äôs in a basement. The truth is they don‚Äôt have enough B-roll footage they can use to demonize him, so they need him to be out in public more
So Biden gets to ask a black man if he is a cocaine using junkie and the Left pretends it is nothing.  Hypocrisy at its finest.
We would get to see Trump's thoughts without the chain link fence filter that precedes his tweets and Biden would forget what's going on after 10 minutes   It would be such great content
(I don‚Äôt think Biden gets the nomination, citing Cognitive decline, which is honestly a smart move)
Biden isn‚Äôt going to Milwaukee to accept the DNC nomination due to COVID (You know the surging COVID numbers in Milwaukee) and will instead accept it at a speech in Deleware later   Sounds like the DNC is buying time to me
Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden will not travel to Milwaukee to accept his party's White House nomination because of concerns over the coronavirus.
Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden will not travel to Milwaukee to accept his party's White House nomination because of concerns over the coronavirus.
Oh, you all forgot that Joe Biden is actually not very good at running for President?
Because him running is gonna draw people that would otherwise Vote for biden not Trump supporters
And Biden has lost touch with everything going  on around him...great choices we have!
Biden has pledged to select a woman and is facing calls to choose the first Black woman to compete on a presidential ticket.
Our Hispanic farmers work hard to grow their businesses and help put food on America's table. It's time they got a level playing field.    will build on the progress made under the Obama-Biden Administration, and will work to #BuildBackBetter for our Hispanic community.

Biden is the absolute biggest buffoon and bully (remember how he challenged the poor fat farmer to a push up contest?) to ever run for president. Trump should be ashamed of himself for mishandling the Corona Crisis and letting that dope get ahead of him. John C. Anderson
You give me January Biden/DNC, and it‚Äôs whatever   I don‚Äôt want to think about what the DNC looks like come November with how far they have moved in the last few months (I‚Äôm talking DECADES of sliding in a few weeks at a time)
You didn't beat Obama. I think you have dementia not biden
Yes! If they debate, Trump will just spew more lies. I‚Äôve already heard enough to make my head explode. Biden all the way, debate or no debate!
Show me a video of Joe Biden peeing on a bunch of prostitutes and all I'll ask is, "but will he order secret police to kidnap protestors?"
I will as long as Biden's VP isn't Harris or Warren.   I hate Trump but I can't for vote those two women. I am in Iowa I will write Bernie's name in if it's them and then move to Canada or NZ where my daughter's father is a citizen.   #NeverKamala  #NeverWarren
Joe Biden to announce that Luka Garza will be his VP running mate!
I'm going to hold my nose and vote for Biden except if he picks Warren or Harris. Then I'll write in Bernie on my Iowa Ballot.
Mostly KHive people were cutting down Scientology because they're jealous Karen Bass is being seriously considered by Biden too.  Picking on candidate because She's even trying to get Scientologist to vote for her is GROSS! If she excluded them she lose her seat.
I am a Dem Socialist &amp; I am NOT Antifa. I DONT EVEN GO TO PROTESTS. I am a healthcare worker. I love Bernie. Hated Hillary so much I voted Trump. Now I hate Trump more than I dislike Biden....so I'll vote for JB as long as he doesn't pick Elizabeth Warren or Kamala Harris as VP.
Isn‚Äôt Biden supposed to announce his running mate today?
Karen Bass is a better person  than Kamala Harris will EVER be. She is an excellent choice as VP for Joe Biden. Harris is a back-stabber and a Hillary Clinton clone. She would stab Biden in back just to be President.
YOUR DOING THE SAME THING WITH BIDEN SSKSSKSHSHSKS
Three people charged in Twitter hack that hit Biden and Obama
I‚Äôve typed this many times to many ppl in the thread. This type of overconfidence in an election win is dangerous. Especially with a candidate like Joe Biden as your Best In Show. Hillary was expected and projected to beat trump in 2016 and it didn‚Äôt happen. We‚Äôll see tho.
Allies say Karen Bass's reputation as a bridge-builder would make her a strong partner to presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden.
Allies say Karen Bass's reputation as a bridge-builder would make her a strong partner to presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden.
Mainstream media can‚Äôt promote Bill or Hillary endorsing Biden for President if they bring it up. Especially with Creepy Uncle Joes history.
trump is our national embarrassment. VOTE JOE BIDEN!!!!
So, we‚Äôre all going to go vote in November right? I know I am, and I‚Äôm really trying not to have an impeached Trump get a second term but I also genuinely despise Joe Biden. üôÉ I‚Äôve done my research on  and  I definitely endorse him, I cannot endorse the other two.
I am an Iowan for Biden but good luck!
Voting for Biden in one election doesn‚Äôt absolve you of all the really shitty decisions that have made this country weaker in so many ways. You have used the #LGBTQ community as a bogeyman. You have used #Black folks as a bogeyman. Your party is divisive and mendacious.
Ah see now I‚Äôm more knowledgeable on electoral landslides thank you. Regardless i stand by my words in saying it‚Äôs going to happen. And the cockiness I‚Äôm seeing from the left is a very dangerous mindset. No election is a guaranteed victory. Especially with a candidate like Biden.
To be fair I feel like people are even less confident about the democratic nominee in 2020 than they were in 2016 so yes you‚Äôre right it‚Äôs not 2016. It‚Äôs an even worse situation where most people don‚Äôt even want Biden. That‚Äôs a strange situation to be so confident in a trump loss
Because Biden didn‚Äôt run.
I reckon Joe Biden would be harder, dude would probably forget why he even stopped by within a minute.
Joe Biden? More like McDoesn't know where the fuck he is half the time.
Will Joe Biden be Kamala Harris‚Äôs new sugar daddy?  VP Nod?
OMG! You're a HillBot. I am so glad she lost a Trump. Kamala is a Hillary clone and I HATE her for that.   I'll be grudgingly vote for Biden as long as he doesn't pick Harris as VP.
Yes! I was going to go along with the Biden thing because I want to get rid of Trump. But if he picks Kamala Harris, I'm writing Bernie Sander's name in. F that crap, I'm not voting for that bi%ch.
The proverity level where we live.  You have done many hurtful things to me personally. I have taken it personal. I don‚Äôt love Biden but the hate you have showed to me gives me more motivation than I have ever had to vote. I went from being a strong Republican to now
My doctor told me this morning that I am diabetic. Not only that, but she sent prescriptions to my pharmacy for glucose testing and such. $100, I can‚Äôt afford it. My Medicare advantage doesn‚Äôt cover them. I only hope I live long enough to see Biden elected.
That is ridiculous. There are plenty other women of color who aren't willing to Flip-flop on policies or walk over the top with someone just to be VP or president. Joe Biden needs a Tim Kaine kind of VP.
She is too ambitious. She will overshadow Biden. She's the type that would have no problem declaring him incompetent and she the next President. She's a Hillary clone and should never be trusted or be the vice president let alone president. #NeverKamala
We‚Äôve been on the scary path the last 4 years... Biden‚Äôs already been in the White House, thus we already know how he will act.
I am going to have a hard time voting for Joe Biden as it is. With Kamala as VP, I may not be able to bring myself low enough to vote for Biden with Hillary's clone on the ticket.
I joked that the DNC was going to "Weekend At Bernie's" Biden to the White House, but they are really committing to the bit nowYou mean Dumb Donald or Joe Biden?
Broken record Joe.  I don't know who is dumber, you or Biden.
Trust me, Biden is not tweeting. His staff is
Joe Biden is dumber than a bag of doughnuts how do you guys not see it. He can‚Äôt even talk properly.. flubs his words all the time and loses my interest immediately
Ha ha ha ha you think white people are smart... (yes, I'm voting for Biden; I try NOT to be a flippin' idiot. And no, I'm not concerned about who his running-mate will be).
Donald Trump says Joe Biden is but he can also destroy God
Biden is not apologizing. He‚Äôs countering the accusations made by Trump. It‚Äôs Trump who should apologize for his remarks toward Biden. Shameful and disgusting.
Biden‚Äôs campaign advertising war chest is $100 billion of free ‚ÄúTrump is responsible for Coronavirus‚Äù every day until Nov. 3 by MSM. You but it you are one dumb ass:
If you elect Biden you will have $10 gasoline and won‚Äôt be able to blame the oil companies this time. You did it.
Biden trashes blacks. Media says it's OK, its just because he has Alzheimer's.  Give him the nuclear keys.
Biden has mastered the art of culling his voting block.  #BidenIsARacist  #Biden2020
Thank you!! This is not being  discussed  enough. When he projects his mental decline on Biden, just throw it right back at him. He can barely stand straight or walk at times
So...where‚Äôs Trump‚Äôs statement of faith then? Perhaps too written by his staff? Even if it was written by his staff (which I doubt), the fact that Biden CARES enough about his faith to actually have his staff write &amp; approve this document is proof of where his values lie.
Not Joe Biden. Joe would have said month not monolith. He had a hard time reading the note cards now.
If you don‚Äôt recognize Biden is in the latter stages of Alzheimer‚Äôs you may need to take a cognitive test.
Donald Trump said Joe Biden wants to: "Hurt the bible, hurt God. He's against God..."  A guy who gassed protestors to use the bible and a church as props in a photo op said this.  Am I missing something?
Biden signs are in his basement where he misplaced them. May never see him or the signs. But polls will show him ahead assuring no Democrats go to the polls.
The Biden charade May be ending as the MSM thought ‚Äúare you a junkie‚Äù was a little demented.
Hoping to join the webinar town hall meeting w/ Dr Jill Biden... and we're waiting, we're waiting....
In light of Biden's stutter, I was going to give him a break, but then I remembered that he mocked a disabled reporter, so no. Shitheads who live in glass houses, etc.
Biden could BE a kitchen blender and he'd have my vote
Anti-Trump Republicans who cannot bring themselves to vote for Biden always sound like idiots.  ‚ÄúLike yeah Trump is a racist wannabe dictator but Joe Biden supports a different tax bracket then me so these issues are equally bad for me.‚Äù
Biden isn't under foreign control.
When Biden speaks, stupid comes out.
#SettleForBiden Chip in to elect Joe Biden and other Democrats on the ballot
Biden stands with the godless socialists burning The Bible on the streets of Portland.
Train wreck? You‚Äôre talking about Biden asking a black man if he was tested for cocaine.
If history is any clue, it'll be "how much better it would have been if Biden had picked _______ for VP."
No, don‚Äôt vote for Kanye.  Voting for Kanye is exactly what Trump wants you to do, as it takes votes away from Biden.
I hope it is the first thing to come down when Biden takes office. To me this act at the White house set the tone for much of what is going on. It is SHAMEFUL!
I am looking into early voting also. My dad voted for tRump on 2016 he is voting Biden but still is afraid of mail in voting. He has always voted at the polls (some things I can't changeüôÑ) so my friend and I thought of early voting make a day of it lunch ect...think it will fly
Rumors are that Michelle Obama will be Biden‚Äôs VP choice. She announced today she is suffering a mild case of depression. Ticket could use a head case since Biden has none.
Biden will never debate
That Joe Biden??? üòÇ
When Biden starts wearing a bib with his mask will the public suspect he‚Äôs in the advanced stages of Alzheimer‚Äôs?
I think the danger is the unhinged left which will be the puppet master behind Biden. They were burning Bibles, like the Nazis they claim to hate. People who burn books often burn people attached to them.
Biden asked a black reporter if he took a test for cocaine. Biden is sadly suffering some kind of intellectual decline or he‚Äôs a racist. Either way, I‚Äôm voting #Trump2020
It's not a stupid question because I think Biden is in cognitive decline and this proves even more.
DNC has some work to do . Renounce Joe Biden .
I think Biden has already committed to a black woman as running mate.
Of course Biden‚Äôs health etc., should be examined as should Trump‚Äôs. Biden is older than I‚Äôd like him, but Trump is just a few years back of him.
Everything Biden has done he takes responsibility for. A lot of good but also some bad.   As for Trump....
I can‚Äôt speak on things I haven‚Äôt seen, but I‚Äôve have noticed Fox using footage of Biden consoling his grandchildren at his son‚Äôs funeral and describing it as ‚Äúgroping‚Äù. But that‚Äôs Fox for you.
There‚Äôs nothing wrong with Biden. His issue is on occasion is the stutter he‚Äôs had since childhood comes up. This is what Republicans cruelly and deliberately say is dementia. Meanwhile Trump slurs his words and reads at a second grade level.
Revolutionary Communist Party USA Leader Endorses Biden for President
commercial idea. Use an empty chair for Biden, then debate it with Biden clips as his answers.
Keep Biden in the basement they said.
A lot of people on the left have said this~ that  doesn‚Äôt care about me. It‚Äôs weird. I don‚Äôt expect him to care about me personally. I expect him to care about America. Do leftists think Nancy or Biden or AOC care about them? No. They just care about power.
Biden beat you too it. Based on the good grammer, doubt you even typed it.
biden doing it all without an convention bump ‚ú®
Yes I like the red meat they all yhrow at us, but I know that as soon as Joe Biden is inaugurated they are jumping right back to the other side acting like 2016 to 2021 never happened, just like the Bush years never happened
how kanye release his VP before biden...
Biden is
Only Biden has been wrong more than Fauci. It took Biden 51 years to reach that number- Fauci did it in 6 months.
people really will look at me crazy when i say texas is going to biden ü§£
Let me see... do those letters stand for "asshole" and "Biden" by any chance?
Mr. Biden is under no obligation to debate someone who has no compunction about lying.
I wouldn‚Äôt say anything until Biden picks her and then go rampant about this
Biden wants Americans to die.
If you believe that what does that say for Joe Biden. Sadly we're all doomed...every politician from both parties has betrayed the American people. No one qualified wants the job. Regardless of what you believe to be right...the opposition will never accept it and attack you.
Looking like Biden will not be alive on Election Day. Not eating . Sign of late stage dementia as body shuts down.
The Democrats cover for Biden's decline by making the case for him to dr...  via
Biden would have a better chance then.
Why would Biden supporters come to see you? Huh? We can‚Äôt wait for the time when you exit WH and go directly first to federal and then state prisons.
Things the media wants me to believe:  Bill Clinton was scuba diving on Epstine‚Äôs Island   Joe Biden isn‚Äôt deep into Alzheimer‚Äôs.  Dr. Fauci is a scientist.   Nadler was actually elected somewhere
This is why people love Joe Biden.
If you like kneelers you will probably love Biden‚Äôs likely VP choice.
representation of voting for biden or trump
Biden will bring this to your doorstep.
Mr. Biden is under no obligation to debate someone who has no compunction about lying.
Do you realize everything you say about  Biden is true of trump?
He fixed the shit Obama and Biden didn‚Äôt or did.
No offense to Sen. Warren, but Biden/Dead Dog Carcass would still get my vote. No, I don't have a problem with Warren in the #2 slot, although I think she will do more good in the Senate.
Hillary announced Tim Kaine on July 23rd and the convention started on July 25th.  John McCain announced Palin on August 29th and the convention started Sept. 1st.  Obama announced Biden on August 23rd and the convention began on Aug. 28th.  Joe‚Äôs timeline is normal. Calm. Down.
even if the polls are as wrong as they were in 2016 biden still wins NC.
Duckworth has a lot of positives without the negatives. She‚Äôs likeable and is hard to campaign against. She also won‚Äôt overshadow Biden.
No way Biden picks Karen Bass as VP after the last 48 hours. Kamala Harris also seems like a liability, as is Susan Rice to an even greater degree. I still think it‚Äôll be Tammy Duckworth.
Good. Name her DNC. Biden isn‚Äôt making any decisions these days. He can‚Äôt request catsup with his fries.
post convention bump. biden‚Äôs been relatively steady for the past 6 weeks.
By the way, it‚Äôs interesting that  basically implies that evangelical Trump supporters need ‚Äúsafe spaces‚Äù because they‚Äôre called racist for supporting Trump, while at the same time he says that evangelicals who support Biden have sold their souls to the devil.
Being led around by a nurse isn't helping.  I see his yard signs have changed from Biden to ByeDon. Is this their way of opening the nomination?
Chicago Gun Violence: 6 Dead, at Least 15 Wounded in Weekend Shootings Across City ‚Äì NBC Chicago  Democrat led, Democrat proud.   Biden can bring this to America.
one of the replies I really vibe with; I hope Biden wins the election and dies the first day
I haven‚Äôt seen that.  But I have seen plenty of hatred directed at Warren, AOC, Harris, Biden.  I‚Äôve also seen things like this:  Frazier, 29, got out of his truck and repeatedly punched a 61-year-old anti-Trump protester in the head outside a Trump rally in Cincinnati, Ohio.
IIRC, nowhere is it explicitly stated that the Pres Pro Tem must be a Senator. If true, the remaining seated Senators could chose whomever... President Biden? Madame President Clinton? Madame President Obama? That would clear out another seat when Ted Cruz's head explodes.
If you are a leftist or liberal and you‚Äôre NOT voting for Joe Biden, you are putting your integrity as a voter above the betterment of humanity and the world.
If there are two cable news shows and three late night talk shows 100 % dedicated to trashing Trump why are there none 100% dedicated to trashing Biden?  Lot‚Äôs more to work with.
Been there for months.  Biden/Dead Dog Carcass would still get my vote. No worries.
Also, complains about Trump-supporters being called racists while suggesting that Biden-supporters have sold their souls to the devil. Ah... okay Robert.
But Biden wants to ban raves so -2million gen z votes lmao
Biden‚Äôs accomplishments in 47 years in DC:  Crickets Crickets
If I'm being honest, I will vote for Biden even if he names Thomas the Tank Engine as his running-mate.
Is he in Biden‚Äôs basement? Does the church know he‚Äôs drinking?
If you believe Biden isn‚Äôt deep into Alzheimer‚Äôs you won‚Äôt pass a cognitive test.
Obama didn‚Äôt name Biden VP until August 28th
Obama didn‚Äôt pick Biden until August 28th. Twitter just made this search toxic. His timeline is normal
*I open my email the morning after Biden is elected*  "Joe Biden: Hi Samuel, I'd Like to Be Added to Your Professional Network."
I didn't even notice he wasn't there, guess that is what a Biden presidency will look like.
They have to pick Susan Rice because she has a simple name. Biden will never be able to say ‚ÄúKamala‚Äù right. It will cause too many gaffes.
Inside HigherEd: Biden Links Loan Forgiveness to Racial Equity
You have been focused. Focused on Russia. Focused on impeachment. Focused on not having the early travel ban from China. Focused on open borders to let Coronavirus come in from the south. Focused on one thing only. Getting rid of my President. Biden‚Äôs hair plugs look better.
He'll resign with an objective excuse that will protect his ego and hurt Biden.  Something along the lines of "Both Biden and I too old to be running for president in 2020." It would be the perfect opening for Nikki Haley.
He'll resign by stating that both he and Biden are both too old to be running for president.  With no formal convention at this point, the nomination process will have a lot fewer openings for drama.
aren‚Äôt y‚Äôall the reason elizabeth warren stayed in and didn‚Äôt endorse biden leading the the end of bernies campaign all because you wanted to be bullies?
You know Biden tweets all the time so maybe you can go there and tell him how‚Äôs his mental capacity is going
I‚Äôm voting #Trump2020 because Biden is just a puppet for the lunatic left.
I hate that people talk like this. If Donald Trump loses John Roberts will swear Joe Biden in on January 20th and then Trump is a private citizen with no power. The idea that he will stay is ridiculous.
neither of them hit 50%. Biden has hit 50% with 5/7 most recent polls.
Maybe (her re-election is safely assumed). She could resign as Speaker, and the House choose someone else -- who need not be a member -- as Speaker, who would then become President Clinton... er, Biden...  At least that's how I understand it.

Joe Biden for President 2020. In my opinion, Trump's all ready lost. He is losing big time in the general election. Trump needs to resign.
Biden for President 2020. Let's see who will win in November. Trump's all ready lost based on how he's handled everything recently. Trump is currently losing in the general election. Deal with that.
There are some blue check accounts who are now saying Joe Biden made this comment. Do better media!
Hey Media! The person who you claim is an ‚Äúally‚Äù to Joe Biden is someone who has probably donated to the Campaign once! You are really stretching on this story because some of you are acting like this guy is apart of his inner circle.
Obama didn‚Äôt pick Joe Biden until August 23rd. The reason why it seems like this taking long is because people especially on this app are making the process incredibly toxic. Like very very toxic.
Well I'd hope Biden's running mate focuses on being president, considering the state of his health
another double digit lead for biden from an A pollster, adding it to the collection.
I can‚Äôt believe CNBC actually ran that story saying its a Biden ally. Please don‚Äôt fall for this crap.
Oh I can not wait for the day you become our next President! My father is still waiting for results of his covid test day 13 at this point results will be useless!  There are so many issues on different levels that need attention but I am confident in you President Biden!
"Too ambitious" is when your Veep is actively trying to poison you.  Other than that, no.  Biden's 77; anyone who accepts that slot has got to be prepared to step up. Senator Harris would suit me just fine.
My guess is Biden will be a one term President (due to age). Keep a close eye on who the VP choice is.
Biden wouldn‚Äôt destroy the environment. Biden would restore our allies faith in our country. Biden would restore the economy (as Clinton and Obama did before him) Biden wouldnt allow the Russians to get away with bounties on American soldiers. I didn‚Äôt even say the T word.
"We used to push Biden to put forward a vision beyond beating Trump, but since he won't try, I guess we won't either!"Would it be hilarious to see KW with votes that were taken from Trump. 'BIDEN WINS. TRUMP AND YEEZ SPLIT GOP VOTES.' DISGUSTED TRUMP SUPPORTERS...VOTE WEST.
If you think Trump has outsmarted all of them, then you're in for a surprise when Biden does beat him.  You've no clue how Hillary, Barack, Nancy, &amp; Chuck just took Donald to the woodshed.
Can y‚Äôall start wearing your damn masks so I can finally get the fuck out of this broken ass country, please? Thx bbs. üòò
Is Trump‚Äôs attack on Biden anti-Catholic rhetoric? We‚Äôll be fine. Kennedy was good.
Agreed except on the Sanders part.  But it shouldn't have been Biden...
What keeps Biden up when he's listening to a sermon? The altar boys.
Your kidding, right? Biden hasn‚Äôt had anybody ‚Äùrecovery‚Äù because he hasn‚Äôt been president! And, as others have pointed out, these are just people returning to jobs they already had. And let‚Äôs not forget the 1.2 million new unemployment claims over the last week. Bunch of idiots
Typical Biden Blackjack. Always doubles down, but won't hit over 13.
Joe Biden did not write this message...

Why does Biden love Jeopardy? Because you get to answer everything with a question

VP Biden, I am a Vet, spent 20yrs in the US Army, I am very glad I am glad you running and no how the Military needs a good Commander and Chief. Trump has no idea how to run the Military. We need to get them codes out of Trumps hands. I got your back Joe. üòÄ
Duhduhduhduh Joe Biden dose not give a shit about the black community or the crime in the neighborhood. He only tells you he cares about you the same as his Puppet Master Obama he did absolutely nothing and Sleepy Joe will do exactly the same. Fools
This man Jason Miller is a trump/putin licker. He hates America and loves Russia. Vote Joe Biden to Save America from Putin. Biden will destroy Putin, Saudis, N. Korea, and every other fascist, dictator in any country. Jason Miller go live in Russia where you belong.
You either vote for Biden or Putin. Trump works for Putin dumb ass.
You lying SOB Biden is a devout Catholic. Trump is an atheist he is now and has always been nothing but an atheist. Trump believes he is God and believes in nothing else.
Joe Biden did not dodge the draft he served his son's served. Trump is a 4x draft dodger. Biden does not steal from us for himself. He has worked for America his whole life to protect and defend our freedoms. Trump steals, commits Treason, allows Putin to kill our Veterans.
Joe Biden knows and respects our constitution he respects all people no matter what age, color or religion. Ins Co. can no longer deny people with illnesses. Our allies know and respect him. Our Allies hate that trump is in bed with Putin and the Taliban.
Feds seizing allegedly laundered assets from Ukrainian oligarch Giuliani asked for Biden dirt -
Joe Biden is a devout Catholic. Trump is a russian liar that hates God.
Your not a true American. Biden is a true American and is always loyal to his country and it's citizens. Trump is a criminal that works for Vlad Putin. Either your an American or your not. If not get out of America you belong in Russia with Putin.
What did Biden eat for lunch? Forgettio's
Money older then joe Biden
You won't commit to voting for Joe Biden until the debates are over?  Really?  Like you think trump will do a 360 and say something intelligent?
Trump says Biden is going to ‚Äúhurt god, hurt the Bible.‚Äù How do you hurt an imaginary fairy in the sky or a book?
Have you ever listened to trump?  He can't even speak in whole sentences!  He babbles on, lying and making no sense. You have a lot of nerve, trying to call out Joe Biden!
Biden is a complete idiot.
If that happens, which I highly doubt, Joe Biden will get the wake up call of a lifetime.  How can Joe lay a hand on our guns, then he'd have to take them off of the children and women for a second. Impossible for him.
Biden won‚Äôt have to drive once he is elected.....Secret Service will drive him anywhere he needs to be.
Really? See before it was I'd rather vote for a traffic cone then Donald Trump. Now, we have to wait to see who Joe Biden's VP pick is before we can vote for him.  No SE, no. We vote for Biden so we can get rid of Trump. Doesn't matter who he picks.
I think he is going to be a major disruption on purpose, cutting in and not allowing the moderators and Biden from talking.
If Biden wins the left will go after EVERYONE who supported
Holy shit could you imagine if even hf this sentence was uttered by Trump or Ted Cruz? Thered be hell. But its Biden so meh right? Bullshit bullshit bullshit.
I know all i need to know about you. You‚Äôve shown your incompetence very clearly. I‚Äôll be voting for Mr. Biden.
I mean the AG already is the POTUS wingman. Show me proof Joe Biden plans to do any of that. Because I can show you 160k dead Americans and millions out of work and that‚Äôs trumps America rn
Again. I don‚Äôt like Joe Biden but I think he‚Äôs a lot more stable than trump
We can do this all day. Biden is bad. But trump is worse IMO.
Not what the polls say, unless they illegally block Americans from voting to try to keep from losing, Riding with Biden, LOSER
Just imagine what he'd have to say about your entire family.  And Biden could laugh at himself. Your daddy couldn't even show his face at the next press dinner because he can't laugh at himself.
Peek a Boo! We know why you‚Äôre hidden Biden. ‚ÄúSleepy Joe, come out to plaaaaay!‚Äù
How about a couple of days before Election day or right after Biden takes the oath social media blocks him.
Biden will inherit a mess, but not as bad as the mess Obama had to undo.
Joe Biden won't travel to Milwaukee to accept Democratic nomination, will accept virtually from Delaware
How about u two donate the 600+ million and just have your 3 debates and let us pick...   Trump tops Biden as both tout large July fundraising hauls
Rice at this point is still dangerous to add to Biden list.
Thank you President Biden for your great leadership.
I predict he will not attend Inauguration, create a fuss at the White House and leave just as Pres Biden is close after parade just for the publicity. He will also use his cult to disrupt.
This is a giant lie. The black man is a paid for loyal trump fraud. Joe Biden is extremely intelligent and he is not a junkie. Trump and this ass wipe black man are junkies tripping their brains out.
There is absolutely no reason Biden should agree to even one debate with this cockwomble. Just stay the course, Mr. VP, and let Trump continue to destroy himself.
Exactly, if Biden wins in November we need to do something about right wing media. They can say that they are entertainment and can lie about everything. Facts are not part of their world which harms a functioning working democracy which we had at some point.
Joe Biden won't travel to Milwaukee to accept Democratic nomination, will accept virtually from Delaware
And considering how awful Trump has been I‚Äôm still sore about Nate‚Äôs missed call. That pollster failure makes one doubt these polls with Biden so far ahead.

Wasn't his question in regards to Biden though? Do you know what whataboutism is, or did you just see the word trending and start throwing out handfuls of it?
A real FLOTUS. Dr. Biden will be a great first lady. She is extremely intelligent and she loves her husband and her country. She is a Doctor not a pd by the hour hooker, or a nude magazine model with naked pictures all over the world to laugh at her. I can't wait.
Facebook removes pro-Trump ad aimed at Joe Biden, claiming false information  #LeanIn
It's the only location Biden still recognizes.
I haven't even seen a bumper sticker for Biden yet.
Exactly. I can‚Äôt even wrap my mind around the kind of repairing Biden will have to do. I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised at all if Trump refuses to concede and has to be dragged out of office. There‚Äôs no low he won‚Äôt sink to.
I feel 100% confident in calling it: Texas, barring any humongous October surprise, will go to Joe Biden this November.
Hey  tell us more about how Biden can't speak.
Staying out of prison is Clinton. Sniffing children is Biden
Are you a juvenile? If so, don't respond to me. I'm Joe, but not Joe Biden.
If Biden wins, then the V.P. and then Pelosi~ Many people know this already.. This V.P. could be a "stooge" once they rid themselves of    This is why he must pick someone like Kirsten Gillibrand? So Pelosi doesn't have a chance of pushing aside a V.P.?
I know~ But this is such an important election! Pres Trump cannot be defeated by a "Joe Biden?" Pa-leeeeeze!

When asked how he feels about euthenasia, Biden said: usually in circles, near a camera, and in front of everyone.
Thank you again for another insightful interview on CNN, informative. I as well will go to the polls in November 3rd and vote for Joe Biden. ‚úåÔ∏èüôå‚úäÔ∏è
I know for a fact Joe Biden loves America and all it's citizens. Biden is not owned by anybody especially all of our enemies such as Putin, Un, Saudis, Taliban shall I go on.
Who is this Biden you speak of i never heard of him
Yes, I know. But if "illegals" are VOTING~ Why shouldn't the President get in on this?? Biden will receive MANY of these illegal votes, President should be able to get some too!!
So I heard from Carl down in St Pete~ He's a staunch Democrat who will be voting for YOU   He states that many illegals are NOT happy with Joe Biden and that they are willing to VOTE for YOU if you speak to THEM? THEY want to hear from YOU?  Tricky situation..
Because Biden still hasn't figured out who he is?
No money for the remodeling the White House. This is a waste of our money trump has gross taste the white house will look like Kremlin and will have to be destroyed and redone by President Biden.
‚ÄòHating Joe Biden doesn‚Äôt juice up their base‚Äô: Key swing state slips away from Trump
Well this is effectively the point I wanted to make. The narrative is all people care about, and the Obama link combined with "who's most likely to get the most votes against specifically Trump" led us to Biden. Otherwise I liked a handful of others to get the nominee.
China just gave Biden $3.3 billion a few years ago~ Why would YOU believe he'd be softer? China would run rampant again in our country if Biden's elected!!

I really do not care who he picks for his VP I'm with Biden no matter who.
President Joe Biden will do just that and much more. Bye bye criminal trump Putin's personal slave.
America was Great, strong, and respected. You tried to kill America and you made America look weak to all our enemies. Now we know you are Americas worst enemy. Joe Biden will return America to its proper world status and Putin and all our enemies will be properly punished.
Again, you have to like the Tweets of the only people telling the truth about this.  Joe Biden is a husk candidate, has no idea what hell is going on.  Just as predicted Trump is gonna ride the "rigged election" idea,  Biden's people are going to try to get him out of debates.
From my viewpoint not voting for Biden Is a vote for Trump. It's that simple and that's what 2016 voters that didn't want Trump in office but also didn't want to vote for Hillary did by voting Green or other.
Where did you hear Biden doesn't want to debate? I thought Trump would be the chump.
From an article re:  The Lincoln Project. Right now you‚Äôve got to kill the alligator closest to the boat, the one that‚Äôs going to kill you, and that is Donald Trump,‚Äù says Tyler. ‚ÄúNow, we can all view Joe Biden as another alligator or Nancy Pelosi as an alligator.

Pompeo &amp; Nunes are collecting fake attack materials on Biden from Giuliani‚Äôs Ukrainian pals &amp; Russia and we can‚Äôt do anything about it, and Rose Twitter is going to share it.  Meanwhile, the Trump admin committed genocide because they thought COVID would kill mainly bluestaters.
A Prayer for Joe Biden by Comedienne Rita Brent  via
Agreed‚ÄîMy father has it and much more acts like Biden. There‚Äôs no way that Trump could do what he does if he had it. But he alluded to something at the Tulsa rally that made me wonder if there isn‚Äôt something up with people trying to spread this rumor.
The fact that Nadler only mentions POTUS using the footage in ad campaigns and nothing about Biden‚Äôs ability to do the same thing makes me wonder if this wasn‚Äôt an admission of guilt?
The Right makes Biden out to be a lot cooler than he is.
and it was so glad to see 45 go to the Capitol and pay his respects to John Lewis. oh, wait, that was Mr. and Mrs. Biden. 45 was hiding in his bunker.

Well then on Nov 4th,welcome President Biden to the  White House! If no one does anything or explains anything Biden will be thumbing his way around the White House in late January 2021!
So what Pastor John and I have learned about the Democrats during the past couple of months~ Is that THEY will rid America of "FRACKING" in Ohio and western Pennsylvania (and many other states) if Biden is elected President?  Get ready people~ NO gasoline vehicles by 2023!!!
Looks like the Democrats have a slight edge on the Prez? This must change before November 3rd? Or we will be saying President Slippery, Slimy, Cheatin' Joe Biden?   Health Care Plan, #PPSV23 for adults/teachers and our military guarding the ballots is the TICKET!!!
So we‚Äôre going to forget that Biden has done less in 40 years as a politician than trump in 4? üíÄ

Nope. They just could never get that big of an audience for just Biden without tricking people to attend.What better excuse than a funeral. Leave it to the douchebag Democrats to ride the coattails of a funeral .
Funny how they're allowed to turn a funeral into a stump speech but if trump mentions Biden during any news conference hes lambasted. It's a joke.
Correction: down in Janusry. He will need it up for those 78 days between losing the election and President Biden's inauguration.
Kinda do, cause Joe Biden isn't writing them...
The people voting for Joe Biden are only doing so because of those old Joe Biden memes that were good for like a month and are still riding that high.
no, we can't wait to see u trumpsters cry when he gets demolished by Biden! ü§£ü§£ü§£
I guess this proves that Biden/Harris is the blue ticket.
Sorry my girl  got it wrong Silver Alert:Joe Biden
I hate that we have to vote for Biden cause there‚Äôs nobody better
And that's a rap for this day~ I will be very busy tomorrow, morning and afternoon!!  Then I'm off Saturday and will be heading out to a family dinner..  ta! ta! Later...   Memory isn't as bad as Biden's!
I want Harris to have Barr's job. She'll kick ass in that position and then she will be ready to run for president after Biden retires.
Biden thought process
This would be just desserts for Republicans. Dropping out so late in the game would basically let Biden walk in with the Presidency unopposed.  Not in a million years. Trump is going to grift all the way to the end.
Obama and Biden made Putin shit in his pants scared not trump he is owned by putin. Putin has no fear of this coward no matter what he does.
They worked together. They were a team.  always had  back. ALWAYS!!! And for that he deserves our support. He‚Äôs Biden is NOT a traitor to our country or an evil vile bigot and Biden listens to the professionals and experts around him.
She‚Äôs Dead!!! funeral in January if Biden wins
Nothing against Biden but at this point, vote for a barstool, a blade of grass, a street sign or even an ex-con.....Hey! Barstool, grass, sign, criminal...TV. I‚Äôm cognitively there!
Once he is convicted of his crimes he shouldn't be allowed to hold on to the former President title. Oh, Trump, Biden will not pardon you ala Nixon.
I wonder if all the Dems who were ok with Trump‚Äôs campaign being spied on would be ok if he were to do the same to Biden.
Biden: love thy children
I‚Äôm definitely a suburban Black woman for Biden because Trump has got to exit stage left immediately!
The Joe Biden thought process...
Did they check the Biden residents
Joe Biden is running to save America from trumps disastrously illegal running of America. Trump sold America to Putin. Biden is taking it back and Putin is not going to like it. We will silence Putin if he forces us to remove his voice from the earth.2k in 1973 (when Biden entered politics) has a 12k value today. How many people do you know of that can sock away 12k a month?
A potato sack is a better choice then Trump. Biden will start healing our country...
get on discord or you support the Biden campaign
Yeah, and Biden would have let more Chinese in at the beginning. Our president is doing a great job based on Fauci‚Äôs constant changing direction. That‚Äôs how science is... you have to change with the data. Thank God for President Trump!
You‚Äôre kidding me right? You have one quote from Trump? Hby you accurately display the information. Go look at interviews With Pelosi in February, Fauci in in early March, Biden in... well nvm Biden nothing he says makes sense. Point being, they were all wrong.
Also, she's never been elected to anything. I don't like that in a VP candidate, esp. with Biden possibly being a one-termer due to age.  We need a VP candidate who could run at the top of the ticket in 2024 if needed.
Are you a Biden supporter, or are you voting for him because he‚Äôs not Trump? My guess is Biden wasn‚Äôt your first pick, but you‚Äôre going to vote for him because he‚Äôs promising everyone the world. Grow up.
Joe Biden narrows down his VP list, with Karen Bass emerging as one of several key contenders
Seriously?? Joe Biden is at the very least, A HUMAN BEING!!  The current occupant in the White House is lacking any kind of capacity that one would associate with a human. Stupidity, racism, denial of the science in front of him, and what is the worst? He is a fucking TRAITOR!!
Biden is not a Socialist, and you would know that if you researched what Socialism is. Enjoy your Socialist police and fire departments; because yeah, that's what they are.
P.S. I know there is a decent amount of Kamala hype for VP from people, but my guess is Biden will pick Susan Rice. I have no basis for this guess but look forward to being right and will return to this tweet when the decision is made to spike the football or look foolish.
Also, it‚Äôs especially rich that people around Biden are making this argument since *Joe Biden* was a Vice President.... who now wants to be President.
Apparently some people around Biden are holding a grudge against her for not apologizing for going after him in that first debate (üôÑ) and are claiming that she is ‚Äútoo ambitious‚Äù or ‚Äújust wants to be President.‚Äù Typically you don‚Äôt hear those charges about men in politics.
Misogyny in politics, a short thread: If you are like me and pay too close attention to politics (üò™) you may know that we are apparently very close to finding out Joe Biden‚Äôs VP pick. There is speculation that it could be Kamala Harris.

Nope. False. If Trump wins, everybody loses except his supporters. If Biden wins, not everybody automatically wins, but at least people of color like me have a shot.

Kind of Biden's thinking ü§î
President Biden will be your President too. He will do much more for you than Trump but you won‚Äôt admit it. Just sit back and enjoy.
Joe Biden is a disaster candidate for the Democrats! He is a quarter of Joe Biden from ten, twenty years ago! Joe Biden belongs to the nursing home not to the White House! And that's sad but true.  That's impossible that more than half country is blind and will vote for him.
In the words of Joe Biden, come on man! I‚Äôll be taking Mayor De Blasio and Garcetti to task for their Soviet Union like draconian steps to try to reel in the coronavirus in NYC and LA with Fox News today at 1:20 pm

You know he will do it eventually:  will mock  for mental capacity or cognitive abilityüôÑ b/c Biden stumbles over words occasionally.   What you may not know is Biden is +still+ fighting a stutter he's had his whole life.
Sharp-eyed critics found the real photos -- and they tell a different story.
Wow would love to watch Biden bumble another debate
Let‚Äôs do a fact check on this video. trump manipulated images of Biden.
Biden will not be the Democratic Socialist Party candidate for the election. He‚Äôs deteriorating more quickly than they thought.
If the Dems sweep, Federal taxes will go way up. Biden already promised it. Your money is going to be used to bail out the  Dem cities and states whose economies have been destroyed by Dems.
So Biden knows already all the questions, no doubt.  Because he needs a lot of time to learn.
I thought that Hunter Biden should know first ü§î  Maybe you don't like each other? Hahahahahahahahahahahaha... It doesn't matter, you will be never the President!

Joe Biden's Campaign Staff Is "Freaking Out!"
Absolutely!!  Biden is giving Trump enough rope to hang himself.  And Trump can't help but do that!
The desperation keeps getting worse.  You certainly can't run on your record so all you can do is try to paint Biden as a villain.  Is this the same Obamagate that you were  unable to explain in your press briefing or a new one?
Please Kanye fans, don't vote for him. Votes for Kanye will only help keep Trump in office. Kanye can't possibly win. He can't get on the ballot in all states. This is only ploy to take votes from Biden.
Your chance is gone Bernie, Biden has enough problems, he doesn‚Äôt need you to come in and scare the crap out of all the moderates and those teetering between parties.  This just fits into the narrative that America as we know it will be overrun by far reaching left extremists.
Biden has won
Sure they have to sneak those votes in, who will vote for Biden after he gets creamed in first debate
Donald Trump beat Hillary Clinton so badly and the left will never get over it. They tried to destroy him with the all costs, it never worked out for them, never will.  And this November he will do the same for Joe Biden...oh boy!
'Daily Show' releases video mocking Trump for stumbling over his words  via   Gee. Isn't that the subject of one of trump's ads against Biden?

Republicans are so worried about their election chances that they're actively supporting Kanye West for president hoping it will take votes away from Biden.  This is what desperation looks like.
Are you guys capable of making, like, positive Trump ads instead of negative Biden ads? Or are you only able to lean on (manipulated) negativity because you know that Trump has done nothing positive?
In Dec of 2019 Trump was saying he would probably not attend any debates for 2020. Now that he is losing big time he is willing to,take any chance to get an extra vote. I say, Biden should just skip the debate.
Good, but If I were Biden I would demand that Trump reveal his tax returns or NO debates!
Biden will crush trump in a debate.
I‚Äôm honored to be insulted by you! Nobody‚Äôs a bigger Trump Democrat than Hillary! Possibly Biden.
If Biden wins all your taxes will be raised to bail out cities destroyed by incompetent power hungry Dems
You are a real danger to the Americans health and democracy! Lying daily ! Biden was in a basement, but Trump was in a bunker hiding like bones spear spanky he is !
I wish every President had a failure like President Trump.  Except Joe Biden, because he never will be the President.
I uhhhhhh gotta click just for whatever that Trojan Horse Biden ad is going to be.
But how would democrats get them to get fake dead people ids to vote for Biden?
That‚Äôs why a vote for Biden is actually a vote for whomever he chooses as VP
Maybe more!  Because the Democrats will send the votes until Biden will have more than Trump. That's their point of the voting by mail!
Be ready at their convention when they replace Biden for whatever reason they come up with.
Even worse. Biden is the Left mob puppet.
I'm sure that after Biden's win (never it will happen), the left would have the schools opened immediately! Democrats Hypocrites!
Better than Biden. No doubt about it.
Everyone should know that the Democrats will send the votes by mail until Biden will have the votes to win.   Hahahahahahahahahahahaha...
Because of my job I drive all over the country all year round.  Judging by only the signs, i don't remember Biden's signs in any state. Listening to the local radio stations and talking with some people, my impression is: people want the security and prosperity.  But with Trump!
Biden‚Äôs health seems to deteriorating fast. Part of the democrat plan. I would say they would have to replace him soon, probably at their convention. Has anything like this ever happen before?
Biden urged not to debate Trump so president doesn't have another platform to 'lie'   I'm not so sure it matters, cause trump will lie about everything any time, anywhere at any opportunity.
Reminder that Biden doesn‚Äôt feel many people are needed for him to win, so he‚Äôs chosen a campaign platform that won‚Äôt win over those voters. It‚Äôs Biden‚Äôs failure not individuals who don‚Äôt vote for him.
We call them customers Biden chose not to appeal to. Failure by the Biden campaign.
Wall Street just reported the worst quarter in history. Biden literally couldn‚Äôt do worse!
You mean, Biden in the Nursing home in November?

If trump wins again it‚Äôll be worse. Biden will at least give us some normalcy with the government and the world. And start a road to recovery. It won‚Äôt be overnight though. Those that don‚Äôt vote either way just gave up our children‚Äôs future.
Yet another example of something Trump had nothing to do with and is a result of Obama/Biden work.
Trump Warns That 'Jobs Will Disappear' If Biden Is Elected. Jaws Drop.   Funny, jobs have already disappeared in the millions on president dung's watch, and it's getting worse. He's getting more and more despite and getting worse!
Time for Trump has expired. If he doesn‚Äôt resign and have Biden pardon him he will be in prison next year.
There are more Trump haters than any other group in the country. Biden should be happy to have them. Bye Bye Trump!

How could jobs disappear more or the market crash more (we just dropped the most in 1 qtr in history)? Trump has killed both 152,000 people and our economy. Biden will stop the killing and job loss.

As big tech CEO's testify -  Democrats: "we love capitalism" Also democrats: "except when it works"  Republican Jim Jordan (snorts line) : "WiLl GoOglE usE thEiR priVatE iNfO to MakE JoE BidEn wiN?"  Just create regulation independently from what these clowns have to say
McConnell won't ever pick it up, but if we can get H.R. 1 passed in a Biden admin, it would do a lot of work to expand voting access, including a national holiday.

Will you still go to protest if Biden is elected
But you got to understand is that it doesn't matter if Trump wins or Biden, wins we all lose in the end. Both are basically the same except one is a fascist. I'm not going to vote for the lesser up to evils again because "orange man bad".
Kanye  implies he is running to hurt
He's just mad cuz there's no nude photos of Dr. Biden on the internet.
okay ü§° its insane how out of touch Democrips are sometimes. Biden's VP will likely be President by 2024 but also Nancy is one of the few people in the Party older than Joe Biden.

Oh you‚Äôre voting Biden? You must really hate America.
The polls suggest almost 100 percent of Bernie supporters will vote for Biden.
all they'll just say he's just typical Joe. It's just old Joe having some locker room banter no harm no big deal. move on from this this is ridiculous he's a great guy Great character. the say anything campaign Democrats. Old Dumb Biden.

Stop apologizing, man. Even the most eloquent get it wrong. It's time to start throwing punches, real ones. No way a guy grows up in Scranton and doesn't know how to punch a motherf*cker in the face... figuratively AND literally, should you have the opportunity. #Biden
What has Biden done for the black community?????
Joe Biden has said nothing negative about African Americans. I stand with Joe Biden. He‚Äôs not perfect in how he expresses himself. I have faith in his leadership - Joe Biden for the President of the USA #DumpTrump2020
You do not understand the complexity of American election. Trump and West are both Republicans. But some Black Democrats will vote for West thereby reducing Biden votes.
I'm gonna be honest...neither of you are worthy any votes from anyone. We are literally voting for whoever will do less damage to this country. I'm voting Biden not because he is worthy but because he is the only option to get you out.
Voting for Biden and Trump is a waste of a vote
Voting for Trump and Biden is a waste of a vote. I'm tired of voting for the lesser up to evils like we always have and I'm damn sure not going to vote for pedo, pro police, pro war, racist Biden because "orange man bad " so I might either withhold my vote or vote third party.
Joe Biden obviously doesn't support Medicare for all and he says it numerous times, I don't want to hear it.
Joe Biden picking a black woman as his VP will be a fatal wound to Trump‚Äôs re-election bid.
‚ÄúAfter yesterday‚Äôs statement, Sleepy Joe Biden is no longer worthy of the Black Vote!‚Äù - Donald Trump tweet - I said this 4 years ago about Trump dismissing Joe Biden and Democratic leadership and the Black vote on Fox News TO THEIR FACE, it‚Äôs still true of Trump‚Äôs tweet today
Obama would have picked a VP that was a racists? Obama vetted Joe Biden, Barack Obama knew Biden would have been a much needed added value to Obamas legacy. Barack is very smart. He would of never picked a man who lacks integrity with any community.
People say Biden is a racist after yesterday's comments. Well let's put this to rest. Who said black lives matter? Biden. Who has always fought for African American communities? Biden. Who supports peaceful protests? Biden. Biden served with Barack for 8 years do you really think
Did Biden just say that " Black Americans are all the same and have no diversity, unlike Hispanics " who do?   Wholly shit!!! If our president said this, he would be crucified.
Exactly, when has anyone ever heard of and apology or a clarification from Trump? Never Biden may fault on his words at least he has the courage and heart to change the tone and admit his mistakes. #Election2020 #Biden2020 #COVID19 #VoteBlue #VetsResistSquadron

Your publushed musing about wasting your vote on a write-in for president is irresponsible, and you know it. We have a two-party system. A vote not cast for Biden is a vote cast for Trump, whose re-election is unacceptable.
Joe Biden addresses African American 'diversity' gaffe  via
Yeah but Biden is very familiar with both of the Corinthians. So keep that in mind.
That controversy makes us less informed. There were a litany of topics on #NABJNAHJ20 asked by some amazing Black and Hispanic journalists important to voters on so many issues important to them. Those are the most important things Black people should taking about Joe Biden on
What Joe Biden said was wack AF and he lowkey meant it but in a political way explaining percentages of Black vs Hispanic voting blocs. I watched that entire #NABJNAHJ20 plenary &amp; he‚Äôs just an old white dude that can‚Äôt properly frame keepin üíØ rifts
I replied that any vote for anyone other than Biden is effectively a vote for 45 &amp; that he should have the guts to at least own his decision.
I wouldn‚Äôt wait that for Biden either.

ANYONE WHO DOESN‚ÄôT VOTE FOR BIDEN, DOESN‚ÄôT VOTE AT ALL, OR WRITES IN ANOTHER NAME, IS VOTING FOR TRUMP EVEN IF YOU DON‚ÄôT ACTUALLY VOTE FOR HIM!! IT IS OF UTMOST IMPORTANCE TO VOTE FOR BIDEN IF YOU DON‚ÄôT WANT TRUMP TO TURN AMERICA INTO ‚ÄúAMERUSSIA!‚Äù

Joe Biden is telling the truth about his experience. When he hears someone is from Venezuela or Costa Rica, he sees difference there. He meets a Black person from Dallas or Savannah and he thinks, at most, "Black South." Maybe just "Black." He is admitting to having no depth.
As long as Trump is president, saying anything about Biden losing his cognitive abilities is a completely moot point. ‚ÄúPerson Woman Man Camera TV‚Äù. Either call it both ways or don‚Äôt call it at all.

I don't know how any African American person can support Joe Biden or Donald Trump. They're both racist old white men. There is absolutely no defending the stupid shit that comes out of his mouth
Can someone who doesn‚Äôt plan on voting for Biden explain their logic to me? Because I don‚Äôt get it. If Trump is re-elected, that‚Äôs four more years of neglecting climate change and guarantees a conservative majority on the Supreme Court for decades. Is that not enough?
Joe Biden actually said:  ‚Äúunlike the African American community, with notable exceptions, the Latino community is an incredibly diverse community with incredibly different attitudes about different things."  Idk how y'all support him or Trump

Biden really said that.
This mentality will fuck the black community even more. It fucks over ALL minorities. No one likes BIDEN. But jesus, use your damn vote so we can get more democrats who DO support the black community, appointed to office.
I find myself excited that Biden will likely hire competent staff and knows how to delegate authority.
Boy, they are really trying their hardest to deligitimize Biden. It's not working. Black voters know Joe Biden. The propaganda machine is in full swing.
Unless Kanye west pulls WHITE VOTERS from Biden he's harmless.  White voters is WHY Hillary Clinton lost.   Period. She won the lowest share in 32 fucking years. Her black support was higher than Jimmy Carter's 83-16 and her husband's 83-10 And 84-12. With Higher Turnout.

Nope. That was literally dementia Joe Biden who told black Americans that they ain't Black unless they vote for him.   I suggested who to vote for.... Pretty sure I didn't say "you ain't black unless you vote for Trump!". üòÇ

Only Nancy Pelosi and Joe Biden matters when it comes to plans.. the same way only Obama and Pelosi mattered in 2009.  Biden's plans beat out Sanders and Warren with black voters. It is what it is.
So Mr Biden is going to act like there isn‚Äôt a whole entire African diaspora with diversity a huge diversity of viewpoints!
Kamala and cory knew better. They wasn't expecting Biden to run... they were protecting against Sanders when they didn't need to.
it‚Äôs them being ideologically similar and Biden having a *longer* track record on the wrong side of history for me. they are both terrible options and i‚Äôm unable to pinpoint how the material conditions for Black people will improve under a Biden presidency.
See...Biden is nominee because of stupid shit like this.   That's why Looney left progressive  shit won seven states this time.

I think 90% of America is voting for president Trump. But if you turn on your liberal Democratic satanic TV news they're claiming that Joe Biden's doing amazing and beating president Trump. Yeah they're right on one thing he's winning in the dumbest old man on Earth.
He must not be watching Joe Biden. Biden doesn‚Äôt seem to be the least bit mentally compromised. Trump on the other hand.........

Ummm.......  If Biden can see 1976 1996 and 2008 white support in a electorate more diverse than those three I'm happy.  48, 44, and 43 were dems white share in those three wins.
Trump campaign would love that.  The audits were just an excuse years ago &amp; they can continue the lie that their hands are tied. Now they can also say it‚Äôs Biden refusing to debate.
‚ÄúUnless debates are moved before early voting, we won‚Äôt know who these guys are!‚Äù  Biden was only a Senator for 36 years &amp; VP for 8. Not sure who he is.  And Trump hasn‚Äôt released his taxes.  We don‚Äôt know either of these guys!  /s

Nothing I mean Nothing you have to say will change my vote for Biden! You need to go now! Right to prison!
He tom Nichols Bret Stephens all used that same line of attack post debate  all republicans.  It was fascinating to watch real time.  The never Trumpers are planning for 2024  (a 81 year old Biden likely loses or doesn't run again) so VP matters to them more than it does to me.
Well he led the charge calling Miami a racial smear on Biden's record the day after the debate.
Yep. They didn't hit Biden nearly as hard as they could have.
Barack Obama rolled Biden out in my state talking about the CRIME BILL.   It didn't hurt him with black voters.
Joe Biden is nominee.  He wrote the crime Bill.  BLACK. PEOPLE.  ARENT. ANTI. POLICE.  WE ARE ANTI  BLANKET POLICING.  We want the same prompt professional policing white people take for granted.  Dems running away from law enforcement is a MISTAKE.   Listen to him.

As long as Biden is above 40 with that bloc that's fine.  1964 was the last time a dem won white voters. We don't NEED to win them... just run better than 2016 with them.
1. Presidential debates a 20th century phenomenon (Nixon-Kennedy first 1960, not consistent til Ford-Carter -1976)  2. Biden could say Trump doesn‚Äôt take virus seriously &amp; not debate in person (Zoom)  3. A debate favors Trump b/c it gives a fallen leader  legitimacy again #AskEx
Independents are not independent. A significant majority have a persistent partisan lean, and the young people who like Sanders and don't like Biden are likely that kind of independent.
They're trying to make this election about Obama, because no matter how much MAGA dislikes Joe Biden, it pales in comparison to their hatred of the Black man who dared be President.

Good faith Dems who make fun of Mr. Trump's incoherence, irritability, &amp; lack of cognitive function clearly have as little grasp on reality as any Trump true-believer or do not listen to Mr. Biden speak.

NO Covid (and other causes) have killed these people. Thanks to Biden, Gates &amp; Obama funding the lab that created the virus! Trump is stopping it all... not to mention saving thousands of kids! Get you‚Äôre head straight and do your homework! Voting Dem is electing Killary Clinton!

My dad is Biden's age.  I wouldn't want him as President.
People are brainwashed to think nothing can be worse than trump. Even if trump is as bad as some people think, Biden is inherently worse.
Dear biden supporters. Your candidate is incompetent.
Joe Biden says if you vote for trump you ain't black. Joe also says if your white you are racist? Hes white therefore racist. Also blacks are not diverse compared to latinos.
We were talking about Trump but sure let‚Äôs bring up Biden since y‚Äôall know Trump is awful. No the 1994 bill was awful and unlike Trump supporters we accept what Biden has done wrong. Want to talk about the Obama administration and it‚Äôs accomplishments.
She's looking for cover for either voting for Trump again or for not voting for Biden, but for someone else.
Did you see who Biden brought along with him?  Who elected him?  Let's have a bigger tent than the Republicans do so that when we make them irrelevant, we will have the philosophical diversity in the Democratic Party necessary to consider all perspectives while they govern.

You're hallucinating, Biden is obviously  suffering from dementia.
The democrats are in trouble with Joe Biden leading the ticket. They selected poorly
Let‚Äôs do a fact check on this video. trump manipulated images of Biden.
I agree. A lot of people are underestimating Biden.
That will happen under whoever is telling Biden what to do .
The thing is it's always orange man bad. Where is Biden what are his polices. ITS FUCKING AUGUST AND THERE IS NO VP Where is China concentration camps How is Clinton not in the news after a witness seen him with people on pedo island
I really don‚Äôt like Biden but Trump is a huge threat. As a queer person there is always an uncertainty that if things go sour we will be one of the first groups targeted. It‚Äôs a crappy situation and I don‚Äôt think you should be so judgmental. Yes I don‚Äôt like Biden.
When you are in the Biden administration, all will be right with the world.
Biden would veto Medicare for All....Why even call Biden a Democrat when his policies are right of center?
The desperation keeps getting worse.  You certainly can't run on your record so all you can do is try to paint Biden as a villain.  Is this the same Obamagate that you were  unable to explain in your press briefing or a new one?
I voted green 2016 but this year I‚Äôm reluctantly voting for Biden. Next presidential election after this I‚Äôm voting for progressives only
Please Kanye fans, don't vote for him. Votes for Kanye will only help keep Trump in office. Kanye can't possibly win. He can't get on the ballot in all states. This is only ploy to take votes from Biden.
No way, no how will Biden debate Trump. It doesn't matter what Biden is, he won't be running anything, the party will be running the country, right over the cliff.
Biden Bottoms 2020 was a personal favorite I hope still happens
Let me guess, the Washington Post lies too? Lmao 90 days until you will owe me $1200 because Biden will destroy Trump in the election. Haha can‚Äôt wait.
Good, but If I were Biden I would demand that Trump reveal his tax returns or NO debates!

I thought Trump built the greatest economy the world ever has seen? (Not even close but you believe it). And now Trump has self destructed. He is awful and you won‚Äôt change my mind. Stop trying. You won‚Äôt change my mind about Biden. Stop trying. You‚Äôre a loser. Fact. 91 days. üòò
Biden was for gay marriage before President Obama was. Fact check me. Trump was in politics long before 2015 with his Birtherism crap and all his crazy comments before. You righties forget all that Trump has done wrong. You‚Äôre idiots. 91 days üòò
People make mistakes and Biden has learned from his. Trump was a pro-choice democrat until 2015 so spare me the righteous Biden nonsense. And the YouTube video was not what you say it is you pervert.

oh man I wanna say it was Andrew Yang vs Joe Biden. but Yang had said that biden was a strong debater. I have no doubts that he will beat Trump.
There isn‚Äôt a silent majority anymore. The independents and women have left Trump. While I don‚Äôt believe this poll, I do believe Biden will win back WI, MI, and PA which will hand Trump a much deserved loss. #BetMe
That‚Äôs why a vote for Biden is actually a vote for whomever he chooses as VP
If you ask me, Joe Biden should automatically be excluded from public office for participating in an attempted coup.
Thats bc Biden supporters are abiding by the COVID implementations while your supporters are causing more cases around the nation trying to cheer 0 feet apart with no masks.
Unlike Trump, Biden will hire the very best staff.
Sure, Biden has been in politics for 51 years. That‚Äôs more than enough time to fix things, instead of napping
I hope Biden pick you #thewomanwhodidnotforgetwhereshecamefrom
If trump wins again it‚Äôll be worse. Biden will at least give us some normalcy with the government and the world. And start a road to recovery. It won‚Äôt be overnight though. Those that don‚Äôt vote either way just gave up our children‚Äôs future.

Next January when Joe Biden is inaugurated you will officially go down in history as the absolute worst most disgusting president in history.
How about impeaching Trump, so that Pence can become president.  Will have a better chance vs Biden in November.  Is this possible?
Like they did during the Obama / Biden administration

Whatever I might be asked to do.  You have my vote for Biden, any Democrat I can vote for, and when my work at the USPS seems more secure, I will donate to battleground Republicans. I might even travel to Michigan to help out or right over the border in SE Wisconsin.

The population of the USA is approximately 328 million, how will they explain 400 million mail-in votes for Biden.
This presidential election is probably the best example I have seen so far. Trump vs Biden. A lot of people don't like either choice. The idea of protesting/activism doesn't even occur to them. What can people accomplish with both?
They're going 2b a prob once Biden is pres. Biden didn't win fairly the DNC's corruption propped him, rigged the election, forced ppl to vote in person.  They will not undo anything the Repubs have done.  How can we trust a party that has clearly failed us repeatedly during DT.

They'll be Biden's treasure to exploit Right now,we have a few important probs
I am a mid aged white man. I believe in 2A and BLM and being responsible with my tax money and helping every part of society. Trump is not anyone‚Äôs president. He is an illusion. Don‚Äôt fall for it! I want a candidate who is like me, until then I‚Äôm voting Biden
Trump is Foxifying VOA. Remember the normal people who ran the VOA and quit mid June, only to be replaced by Trumpsters? 6 weeks later...
The military will not follow his orders. Just swear Biden in, take the nuke suitcase away and govern at camp David. trump will find that an empty White House will become boring and he‚Äôll eventually move out. The secret service for Biden can remove trump also.
We are so weak in the worlds eyes now. Biden will have to MAGA
Trump is doing an AWESOME job of defining himself in terms favorable to Biden. Please proceed.
I cannot believe I am going to have to vote for Joe fucking Biden this year. You win, universe.
Gonna be interesting when he refuses to cede power to Biden if Biden wins.
You can take that picture of me and put a ‚ÄúBiden Will Win 2020‚Äù as a heading to remind you that you‚Äôll be paying me $1200 since you are creeping on me. It‚Äôs one way to rationalize your stalking of me I guess. 96 days.....
Now you‚Äôre creeping on my new picture of me and my disceased mom from 2016? Are you really fucking that sick or do you get off from creeping on people? I know you are mentally ill being a Trump supporter and having those Biden videos, but creeping on me is really sick.
Is this when President Biden announces a real plan to deal with COVID-19 in 2021!
And I may be trash to you, but at least I don‚Äôt support, defend, and vote for trash. You can say all you want about what Biden might of done, but he cares about America unlike Trump who you support and that‚Äôs what makes you even worse than trash in this world. 97 days...
Idiot. There are gun control laws that prohibit the unlawful possession of guns. Only a mentally ill person could believe a new law will stop illegal gun ownership. She needs to be Biden's running mate. Both clueless.

Wat for it this is only just getting started, he reaching for straws to find something to stick to Biden ,won't happen we are all smarter than he and the repubs know.
Where's the Bible that Biden  hurted? Or is it under audit?
you have seen the horror of this administration and still it will come down to who biden picks as VP". you are the white woman we were warned about.
I prefer science over gods, but respect Biden for supporting science while following his god.

Well we disagree. I don‚Äôt think democracy is under threat from the left or the right. It‚Äôs under threat by a reckless, incompetent administration and its enablers. It‚Äôs absurd to suggest that Biden is equal to Trump in this regard.
I‚Äôve fully prepared myself to be disappointed by Biden‚Äôs pick (I want it to be Warren but I know it won‚Äôt be), but what I don‚Äôt understand is all the fighting between Dems over this. We all have one goal and that goal is to defeat 45.

Ah so like...Clinton in 2016? I don't understand how this is supposed to work beyond being an admirable aspiration. My guess is Biden thinks - probably correctly - that his objective is not to give people the excuses they're looking for to not vote for him/vote for Trump.

So I have a question: if Biden gets 40,000,000 more votes than Yam Tits, could the Electoral College still hand the presidency to Mango Mussolini?
This is Biden's plan, the Democrats are engaging in Genocide. From Planned Parenthood to this curriculum, you've never seem people blk people so represented than when their talking about this stuff. They even made sure they added brn and blk to the flag to show our participation.
Pretty sure he was talking to Biden, there, right?
That's one small piece of the puzzle. Biden was also articulating a sensible plan for response while Trump was still claiming that it was just going to go away and we didn't need to do anything.

That Trump believes that Biden could "hurt God" exposes the shallowness, the superficiality, of Trump's own beliefs. Believers in God know that God is stronger than either Biden or Trump.
Biden is portrayed as a familiar face and reliable statesman in contrast with the volatile Trump. In reality, he promises to be the most liberal president in history, writes

I'm voting for Biden even if he picks me for VP.
I think Rubio is right and the hearing showed that (outside of Murphy who appears to be allied with the "mesita") but I certainly hope that Guaido and Borges are lobbying Biden's team for repudiation of the December 6th farces.
Evers did a point better in 2018 against Walker. He was able to win the Town of Vienna in northern Dane County. This is a Town that Biden will want to win come November as it would show improvement over Clinton in the rural areas around Madison. 4/5
The sixth region in my Wisconsin breakdown series is my home region, Dane County. There is probably room for Biden to grow here compared to 2016. While not the most Democratic region in the state, this is the most liberal region in the state.  1/5
Bull. He was on track to win the nomination.He swept the early primaries and the DNC panicked &amp; brought out the Big guns (Hillary, etc) to trash him.Biden‚Äôs campaign was broke and in the toilet before Clybourn and SC. Arm twisting to get Amy &amp; Pete to dropout and endorse Joe.

Just when I think  can‚Äôt be crueler than he already is, he attacks a devout Catholic saying Biden will hurt g-d. Trump is beyond contempt but I still feel he will hijack the election.
I didn't know Joe Biden was that powerful.üòÅ
I can't wait for the GOP and the Trump campaign to imply that Hunter Biden was at the bottom of this scandal... it's coming soon!
Really? This babbling nonsense is probably HELPING Joe Biden
Can Joe Biden make a boulder so heavy that even God can't lift it?
Venezuela is still a priority.  And it is Guaido's job to ensure that it is a similar priority if Biden wins.  It is a marathon, not a sprint.
Yeah I‚Äôve been getting the secret Biden emails sent to me. All about no energy, no God, no more APPLE PIE FUCK IT ALLLLL MMMWWWWWWHhahahhahahahahahahhhahahahahhaha üòà
Did they also rip off Joe Biden‚Äôs logo?
. really needs to know the VP pick though before voting for Biden over Trump.
What Biden said earlier was this: "Oooooooooh. Latino lives matter more than Black lives because there are more of them, just so you know."  My god, we have two racists running for president...
Did Trump and Biden have an in-depth religious discussion where they gave their viewpoints on God and Jesus? It seems one lives the life Jesus preached; the other is the antithesis of anything Jesus stood for.
Biden holds his Bible right-side-up.
Oh yeah, and I think Kamala scares the ever-loving shit out of men. (Which I'm ok with)
Stacey Abrams has NO federal governing/foreign policy experience. To put her in line behind an aged (probably 1 term) Biden doesn't seem like the best choice.   Kamala - is a solid choice now. But has some issues with black vote.
Trump: "Biden is against God." Biden: "Sorry I didn't immediately respond to our lying, misleading Tweet.  I just returned from Church." Trump: "Hush, this is an important putt!"
Ideally Biden and his team will come up with a better strategy to help pressure Maduro for a negotiated electoral solution.  But the concern is that they listen to false opposition influencers and support Fal$on and other Maduro pawns to help shore up Maduro's dictatorship.
Dude check my feed. Look at how people is upset at what Biden said but was like fuck it compare to trump. Feel free to she how the 98% live
Why do you post these inane headlines? This is not news. You are spreading falsehoods. Have you covered whether Trump has ever been known to be a church member or church-goer during his adult life? Biden has been a devout Catholic his entire life.
Biden is ‚Äúagainst God‚Äù and he is going to ‚Äúhurt The Bible.‚Äù This from a guy who broke 78 of the 10 Commandments.
True.  Guaido should spend his time lobbying Biden now on Venezuela.
As for Bolton, I do not care as I think Biden will likely win.  This is why I am interested in Biden's advisor's thoughts on the subject and hope he will repudiate farce elections and the mesita and reaffirm support for Guaido.
What you fail to forget republicans are given a chance every year. Shit there was an entire group willing to vote for him. But he kept being racist and he lost them. And they hate Biden too.
Watch what happened at 0:28 in ‚Å¶ broadcast: "Biden Racism, DNC Secret Weapon? Jobs Report, ObamaGate and more!" w/ Author Brenden Dilley #TheDilleyShow
Oh Biden is a white moderate. But I find it funny trumpkins pointing out when racist runs deep in their little crew.
The part where you won't say that you'll vote for Biden, as opposed to not voting at all or voting for Kanye.
No, not illegal at all. Completely disengenuous. From a racist mind set. And motivated by a desire to pull voters in key states from Biden.  It's gonna fail just like everything else Trump and his people try. But, we gotta fight like they are gonna win to make sure.
And what do you mean by creative?  Surely you do not think that Biden should throw Guaido under the bus and endorse fake parliamentary elections with the mesita.  Because that seems to be what you are insinuating.
A true election could be used by Guaido, LeLo, etc. to generate political change.  But to get that right now diplomacy and sanctions are needed.  And outright condemnation of any farce elections and sanctions against the mesita.  It is crucial that Biden support the last point.
Banned yet from Twitter today? Doctor any pictures of Biden yet today?  Play any golf today yet? Mislead Americans today yet about the seriousness of the pandemic? Wait, I guess it‚Äôs still early to do all four yet. I will give you a couple hours to comment about TV ratings.
Biden knows how to interpret pandemic charts without help from journalists. Trump‚Äôs constant, chronic lying and rambling, incoherent statements shows that he has no brain capacity.
Too busy covering up his other crimes, dreaming up ways to hurt Biden, and prepping for the horrors to come.
trump is manipulating and burying things and classifying things and hiding things so he can cheat his way to the very end of his term.  Then... we're gonna get him.  Cannot wait.  And Biden will NOT pardon him.
It will be hilarious if Trump come in 3rd behind Kanye West and Joe Biden. üòÑ
Not originally my idea, but I like it: Trump has to release his tax returns as a condition for Biden to debate him.
If a reporter asking Joe Biden about taking a cognitive test is not telling enough, Biden‚Äôs angry and inappropriate response appears to validate the concern about his deteriorating cognitive function. Sad but his diehard followers will remain in denial.
The article wasn't "Biden faces crowd during public speech," it was refuting frequently-shared misinformation. Especially after the 2016 election and all the misinformation leading up to it, that actually seems kind of important.
The Onion character is great.  I want the Onion Biden as President.
I agree.  You have to be naive to think that Maduro will give up power.  He did not after the elections that Biden insisted on in 2015.  I certainly hope that Biden supports Guaido fully rather than the mesita and Fal$on.
Does Biden even have values besides orange man bad and beat trump? Nope
Personalities matter when it comes to elections.  Sorry WOLA, Murphy, and sadly the Biden campaign..  but Venezuela is not going to vote for the crap the mesita shovels out.  Also, why can't Biden firmly endorse Guaido, reject fake elections, and reject the mesita.
Perhaps Biden could come out and repudiate the farces in December and also reject the mesita and ask for sanctions against them.
Biden speaks coherently. Trump flails his hands, rocks back and forth and babbles and rambles. Not only does he lie, he makes up crazy, illogical nonsense. He can't read either. An intelligent President is a good thing.
Biden is not trying to kill us- or take our health insurance away.
Biden may be the majority choice in America, but Trump and his thugs are trying every possible corrupt tactic from cutting off the census, re-drawing district lines, stifling  the US Mail and intimidating voters. Trump wants total autocracy and he‚Äôll cheat to get it.
I remember hearing something that this would require a rules change. I do feel sorry for Biden. It's terrible what is happening to him, but the time to get him out is long gone. If they were to find a way, they'd have to give it to Bernie. He's the runner up.
Unfortunately some on the left, namely WOLA and a few US Senators (cough: Murphy: cough) are using Guaido as a pawn for their political/ ideology fights in the same way they accuse Trump of doing.  Which is why Biden should ignore them at all costs.
Robin Williams summarizes perfectly Joe Biden‚Äôs character in this clip.
He‚Äôs ok. He‚Äôs Joe Biden. Lol
Then why say he must be defeated? You defeat by voting for the viable contender. Not voting or writing in is a vote for the orange shit gibbon. Steele is a repugnicon enabler that resulted in the election of the shit gibbon. He needs to own it and back Biden.
I‚Äôve said it before with past Dilley Shows, but this might be his BEST!  Watch ‚Å¶ broadcast: "President Trump VS Joe Biden, Walls Closing in and Special Musical Guest Miguelifornja!" w/ Author Brenden Dilley #TheDilleyShow
The US has strong institutions that will prevent it, especially the courts.  Even the GOP wasn't down with Trump trying to delay the election.  However, if you are concerned about the elections, I'd encourage you to organize so Florida goes to Biden by a good margin
But the POS isn't voting for Biden so tell me how that helps?
If Biden does not say that, how can Trump hear it?? Unless, of course, he's lying. Again.
Die-hard Democrats I know are fed up about the prospect of Biden, and holding their nose; they must feel at least a little like the 2016 GOP felt: "We had 15 legitimate candidates with at least as much to offer as the next, and...THIS is who we're rallying behind?"
Does Joe Biden‚Äôs wife hate him? How do you let your spouse who‚Äôs clearly suffering from dementia continue to go out and do this?
Biden's lone selling point: "He's not Trump."  Meanwhile, the Dems have failed to #OwnTheNarrative around anything related to policy, in no small part because their candidate seems to be locked in a basement 24/7, only to come up for air and yell "Come on, man!"
Neat.  So Trump can arrest Biden and outlaw the Democratic party and claim popular mandate.  Because that is how Maduro "won" in 2018.  And I'm not sure when we recognized Guaido before any election.  He was recognized in 2019.
Great.  So what is Biden going to do to get rid of Maduro?  We cannot even get Biden to condemn the fake "elections" in December.

They won‚Äôt make sense when Biden starts to speak.
It only matters because JG needs to somehow ensure continued support both from Biden and the EU.
Is this the new Biden campaign slogan?
Your are confusing Joe Biden with Donald Trump.  ü§£ü§£
It is as childish as Trump's outbursts for Murphy to have foreign policy views based on hating foreign leaders/ oppositions like Guaido just because they are currently allied with Trump.  Hopefully, Biden is more mature than this.
We will because Biden will be President.  üòÅ
No.  What you need is to stick with what Guaido has done so far and the support he has, pressure Biden and the EU to reject any "elections," and see if a savvier US administration headed by realpolitik 1990s/ 2000s Biden, not Obama flunkie Biden, can get a negotiated solution.
No...  Guaido should continue fighting this year and into next year.  He should be working to get continued recognition from Biden/ EU in 2021.  The only way is a negotiated solution and a transitional government.  There will be no more elections in Venezuela.
This election is between trump and Biden. Not Hillary, Obamam or Pelosi.   We've seen what Biden did as VP for eight years. We've seen what trump has NOT done in the past nearly 4 years. Before this country is destroyed, we must make a choice.  I've made mine.
Still trying to figure out what Joe Biden would actually DO to stop the virus, and why we haven't heard about it til now.  I mean, aside from the things that would be shot down by the Supreme Court, like a national mask mandate.
They couldn't participate with their parties or candidates.  That is why they boycotted.  But I guess you would consider it free and fair if Trump ordered Biden arrested...
The most important issue facing the world in coming years is the rapidly deteriorating relationship between China and the U.S., yet it gets little campaign attention.
No one in the US would accept Trump "winning" an election after arresting Biden, ordering Roberts to steal the Democratic Party, and selecting Ted Cruz as the "opposition candidate."  Yet, the same people are okay with this happening in Venezuela because..  Che cosplay revolution
That is why Eli Lake suggested that Biden reject the farce elections now and endorse Guaido firmly.  This would put any doubts to rest.  Murphy's mesita aligned views are concerning given that he is supposedly an "establishment Democrat."
No they couldn't.  The puppet electoral committee barred the main parties AD, PJ, UNT, and VP from participating in 2018.  AD is basically the "Democratic Party" of Venezuela, so this would be like the FEC banning Biden from getting on the ballot.
Biden and the Democrats should be encouraged wholeheartedly to ignore anything that comes out of Murphy's mouth on Venezuela.  The latest of which appears to be lobbying for the US (aka Biden) to recognize the farce elections in December.
She just admitted they are moving his platform. I hope all you middle of the road dems are listening. Biden is not in control of this . #Trump2020Landslide
The parties couldn't participate in the election - the four main ones AD, PJ, VP, and UNT - nor could the strongest candidates who were either in prison (Lopez) or barred from running for office (Capriles.)  But I guess you'd be okay with Trump arresting Biden.
So in the not too distant future (Friday) I get to interview the author of this piece --  -- for a "show" (podcast? interview? YouTube thing?) that will be posted (hopefully) over the weekend.  CC
Biden backer.
We're not totally splitting hairs here:  said that Joe Biden's quest to find a female running mate is "illegal."  And it probably is.
I believe that despite these ‚Äògood‚Äô polls for Biden, 95% of folks are VERY wary and cautious and will absolutely  vote.  People realize we are fighting a malevolent and evil man that needs to be defeated  with an overwhelming landslide.
What‚Äôs funny is that his campaign right now is actively setting expectations for Biden so incredibly low and for him incredibly high for the debates. And when they actually look like... this? ooof
R U N! Now her and Biden does not govern their own ship..... üò±You don‚Äôt get that high in life not unless you have broken some eggs,ü§î killed, stabbed,molested  oh and need a few politicians to get the okey! Zoning! üëÅüëÅ
At no point during the campaign did Biden -- or any other Democratic leader -- pick up the phone (or send a tweet), call Trump and ask "Mr. President, how can I help stop the virus?"  It was -- and still is -- about playing politics. There was no silver bullet. Scott's right.
Whatever you think of Biden, even if you think he's senile, he's 100% not actively maliciously senile, and frankly I prefer to live the next four years of my life without being ruled by active, actual malice.
Karen Bass is basically Sarah Palin 2.0, isn't she?  The dumb thing is that McCain needed a Hail Mary pass in 2008; I'm not sure what Biden who is way ahead thinks he is gaining with having this controversy.
How did I miss this...
Trump and Biden, fucking and sucking their way across America. That's a show I'd watch
I'd vote for kanyes big toe over Biden.
I continues to astound me that you can critique Biden on gaffes that just actually pale in comparison to your Feckless Leader‚Äôs daily verbal garbage spew. It‚Äôs like you‚Äôre completely unaware. Willful ignorance or blind adoration... you‚Äôre in a cult.
This is how Biden loses Wisconsin.
Joe Biden has dementia April, haven‚Äôt you noticed? TDS blinding you?
That is why Biden repudiating the farce election now would be very helpful.
Biden has dementia and is going to lose
Here it is.
Not sure if you saw Eli Lake's editorial encouraging Biden to reject the AN "elections."  That may have an effect.
Yep.  Biden policy advisors constantly r/t WOLA.  Although I don't know why it doesn't happen to be honest, all that is being asked of him is to condemn fake elections that the opposition cannot participate in.
And they talk about Hunter Biden? Trump‚Äôs team are all insider traders- including their families.
This is good news, even though it should have been done months ago. While Trump tries to drag Biden and his son through the mud, this would be a really good time to have some hearing about Pompeo and his wife using the State Department for his own political benefit.  Let's do it!
No.  Lake is saying that Biden should condemn the fake parliamentary elections.
Excellent opinion piece by Eli Lake and I agree with the sentiment 100%.  A statement by Biden rejecting any "fake parliamentary elections" even as a candidate will do a lot to help Guaido and the opposition.  I'd also add that he should condemn the "mesita."
Yeah, don't want a senile old man on stage. On the lying part, Biden could hold his own with Trump
But we have clear basis to know how Biden will treat his VP. Just look at his role with Obama. It‚Äôs clear he wants a rock-solid partner as VP. That‚Äôs Harris.
This is a good theory and I certainly hope that this is right.  It's baffling that Biden would keep someone as far left as Bass on his short list.  The Cuba stuff alone should be a disqualifier.  Maybe it is a bone to the Bernie base.
That seems weird given that Biden has a perfectly boring and normal choice - Kamala Harris - who won't raise that much controversy IMO and checks the dumb diversity boxes that he put himself into.
Bass is so far left that it is baffling that she is getting any additional ink from the Biden campaign.  They probably signed away Florida if Biden picks her based on the Castro stuff (as well as the Venezuela stuff that hasn't been picked up yet by the media.)
Same to you. Trump actually is doing great campaign for Biden. üòÇ
Biden is incapable and incapacitated.
I do not like Trump but I am mostly concerned about policy to Venezuela.  Right now, there are tough sanctions on Venezuela, which I fear will be removed and Maduro allowed to execute Guaido and the opposition by Biden.
Totally misleading statement from a diehard Democrats. Anyone supporting and voting for an old demented fart, Joe Biden for president should have his head examined. Furthermore, the Democrats have turned communists.

How cute. The article makes it look like Biden actually has any input on who the VP candidate will be.   Joe Biden expected to announce running mate week of August 10 -
If we elect Joe Biden, we‚Äôll have an actual normal person running the country, not an insane clown and his insane walking colostomy bag offspring and their crap spouses who don‚Äôt even qualify for security clearance. Thank you for playing. Sit down. (In prison, where you belong.)
But, that is exactly the democratic appeal. We often act in unexpected circumstances that we should act with what has changed. But, the truth is Biden won, because he is the safe choice. His current appeal is normalcy, and the ability to bring normal back. That is his story.
But today you‚Äôre calling Biden indecisive??
Biden supporter if you need it.
160,000 dead Americans .... and I can't vote for Joe Biden because I'm pro-life.   Uh-huh
Joe Biden has dementia and CNN lies about it
Biden is a puppet‚Äîhas been since he entered politics.  #PoliticalHack
This is the Potted Plant Election. Ie most of the people opposed to Trump despise him so much they‚Äôd vote for a potted plant against him. Really we WON‚ÄôT stay home. We are desperate to vote him out no matter how we feel about Biden. It‚Äôs why Biden leads in every poll, state or US
I don't think those leaks are genuine. All it does is make Biden look better when he does the easy, expected thing all along.
You mean Biden's AG? (or is Kamala so perfect she can do both?) I haven't seen much serious discussion about criminal charges, but I'm not sure it should be ruled out preemptively. I see the downside in opportunity cost to other structural reform more than norm violation.
Biden will create a better police force that serves all people. Trump will bring in his untrained thugs.
Unfortunately Biden has not articulated a strategy that would get rid of Maduro.  I keep asking and get nothing.  And Karen Bass's name being on the VP list is really concerning when it comes to Venezuela and Cuba.
If not for MN/Floyd  would be the most helpful &amp; hardest for Trump to hit. Hard to tag defund police/socialism on her. If you buy that Biden runs as well as or better than HRC with non-whites then Klobuchar type candidate further helps with college educated whites
Actually Trump has been an absolute boon to the left and has destroyed his own party. Thanks to Trump the left is now the country‚Äôs most potent political force. That‚Äôs why DNC consolidated behind Biden as they hate and fear the left and see it as a threat. Trump fuels opposition
We all knew the Biden play was rigged. Clinton now publicly acknowledges they conspired to stop Bernie, and the will of the people stuck in this two party system to vote for a candidate that actually puts humans over profit. We are all just puppets- they are the masters.
Biden's running mate matters so much to quite a few people I've spoken with.
I keep reading about how Biden is "screwing up" the VP pick because he hasn't announced yet.   Sorry he's not working on your schedule, folks.
It's over. Biden doesn't win shit.
Biden is unlikely to be a turd, and No Turds For VP!!   And emphatically I agree with the "Tired of GOP" sentiment.
Hi Rashida, question, I just saw a post that said you haven‚Äôt endorsed Biden, is this true?
Literally, about the only thing that could lead me to withhold my vote from the Biden ticket. Wouldn‚Äôt matter in Illinois, anyway.  #KarenBass #Scientology
Biden has no choice but to pick Kamala. Make the decision Joe, damn it, this is starting to damage everyone involved.
Remember when Capriles went running to Elliot Abrams with the proposal that the Americans appoint him President of Venezuela and then Abrams said no.  Maybe his buddy Leo Martinez told him that he'd have better luck under Biden which is why he won't STFU.
She fights the good fight everyday!! Vote Biden so she can walk away when she wants to.  #VoteBlueForRBG
You make a good point, but only if we survive the next 6 months as a country.  50/50?  This is gonna get ugly, folks.  Barr is going to arrest Susan Rice (which is why she can't be VP). Possibly Biden. Trump still hasn't used a nuke.  Shit's gonna get dark. Not hyperbole, either.
Biden can kiss Florida goodbye if he picks Karen Bass.
It will be the party to end all parties. Living in Chicago, I remember how excited I was and the feelings of pride I had when President Obama won in 2008, it'll be rivaled by the feeling I'll have when we have President Biden!!
It's artificial. They're only making these leaks to the media to make Biden look like he's not the same old white guy Dem when he does what the establishment wants in selecting Harris. It's sleazier than good ole fashioned crotchety misogyny.
These leaks feel like they're designed to make Biden seem more independent and "with the times" when he makes the trashy establishment choice in Harris. Seems very artificial.
Biden and his allies should really drop the whole he'll never meet with Maduro line if he chooses tankie, Karen Bass, as VP.  Or is he just being literal with this because he'll just send VP Bass down to Caracas for a "We Love Maduro" pep rally.
It's interesting because it seems like Trump is going hard after the south Florida Latinos, who do appreciate his tough line on Cuba/ Venezuela and don't particularly trust Biden.
I don't think Biden can really be pushed left that much, if his response to COVID is to shoot down M4A. He's signalling a hard line, which he should pay for on the 'left' edge. Otherwise he'll keep moving right thinking that the left won't fall off as he moves fulcrum rightwards
I agree that voting is about harm reduction. Where I don't agree is that Biden winning actually represents harm reduction over the 10-20 yr horizon
Clearly Biden better than Trump, so if your 'ethical time horizon' is 4 years its' a no brainer. If it's longer than that, some-brainer.
I have no problem with Settle for Biden. If anything it reveals what voting is--minor effort thing, relatively important. I'm still not voting for the guy tho
Karen Bass?  Really?  Biden is trying to actively lose Florida if he picks Castro-lover for VP.  At least he has some pictures of himself with Liliana Tintori which he can hide behind when it comes to Maduro/ Castro.  Not sure what he can do with Tankie Lady on the ticket.
Believe me that the Cuban and Venezuelan communities in Florida hate Susan Rice as well because she is way more connected to the Obama policies on Cuba/ Venezuela that they despise than Biden who can at least point to advocating for important political prisoners in Venezuela.
Heaven forbid a VP run for president....  I'd hate Joe Biden to win.
I think that Biden is going to win and also think that it would benefit Cubans/ Venezuelans to pressure him to go tough on both.  Also, DMP is one of the few Democrats who is very good on Vzla/ Cuba.  It'd be tough to lose her and let the tankies run wild.
Interesting dynamic that has a whole lot to do with foreign policy..  Hint, Biden needs to go way more aggressive on Venezuela than the generic fluff he's put out.
I think that it is the dynamics of Cuba/ Venezuela and appreciation of Trump's tough stance against the dictators in both country.  Biden has to do more than just offer TPS.  He really has to assure these people because they felt burned by Obama.
Yeah he fucks porn stars. Let's see what Joe Biden fucks.
Ever heard of hunter Biden??
Nobody falls for concern trolling from Republicans sharing Biden's past support for certain Republican initiatives as if the guys they'd rather have don't want to triple down on every last one of these things.  You aren't good at diminishing support.
Going to suck when Biden gives Trump and his senior administration blanket pardons after Trump refuses to concede.
I know that Biden used big words and you hate that so if you want to talk about cognitive decline I am just going to say 5 words: Person. Woman. Man. Camera. TV. Is that more your speed?
I have always said the problem with progressives is the people they like are the people America hates. It is never the policies. It is the salesman. Unfortunately a lot of white progressives are very focused on their people. Biden is the best salesman for middle America.
That's not a surprise, wait till they find out what Biden has done.
They put up Biden of course it isn't going to work. Nobody likes that child molester
"I think I'll do well with Bernie supporters" and "Biden is completely controlled by AOC and the radical left" never seemed like a winning combination. Just let us leftists remain depressed about Biden. Why tease us with hope?
Understandable, but I think we need African American voters more than Cubans. Cubans tend to lean republican heavily still, so I wouldn‚Äôt be to focused on just that group of voters. I get the voting power in Florida, but I believe that power is part of the RNC coalition.
Yeah, I am not seeing it here. The Fidel boogeyman thing is out of the trump playbook. The one great thing about trump is he sucks all the oxygen up, even when it hurts him.
This is really sad. I don‚Äôt like Biden for a number of reasons but his handlers allowing him to make a fool of himself and make it worse with a failed attempt at humor is verging on elderly abuse. Snarky comments to obviate from his dementia made it more pathetic.
This is failure on many levels including failure to recognize China as a threat. Mr. Biden, China must be held accountable. An investigation is a must! China must pay, what‚Äôs your policy?
Oh dear, Joe Biden wrong for moms?  I don‚Äôt think so. Most moms teach their kids to be honest and kind, listen to experts, be of service to others and respect women and people of color...like Joe does. Not like our liar-in-chief.
I‚Äôm wearing my Tweet less, Listen More Biden for President tee shirt.
Biden better get a carville (not a carvel, tim)
Well said, Annette! I got a Twitter account as a blood pressure lowering device. With Trump out of office, I‚Äôm not worried about national safety, mass death and starvation. I‚Äôll drop it when Biden wins.
Biden is beyond tweeting. He can actually speak in real, understandable, words
Joe Biden doesn‚Äôt need to stay up all night incoherently tweeting. He‚Äôd rather sleep so he can READ HIS BRIEFINGS in the morning and keep America safe and informed.
You‚Äôre right Joe Biden will try to get out of having any debate with Donald Trump. We the people want to have these debates move forward so we can make a choice based on what we hear
Is Biden allowed to run for president still?  Then, we are not Venezuela.
Can Biden still run for president?  Great!  Then we do not live in a dictatorship unlike Venezuela where the opposition cannot run in elections.
Following all too! Thank you Patiüëèüèæüí™üèæ
Awesome group of resisters, followed all that were new to me. Thank you. Please follow back
That‚Äôs true, your right and I like your pony. but Biden is still a disappointment. And he looks like a puppet out of some weird political si-fi movie. You can‚Äôt disagree with that.
Yes, that's why the four polls showing Biden's leads increasing are in one tweet, and the two polls showing his leads decreasing are in the other. They do this every time, too -- look back.  I'm right, silly. :-)
It had better specifically call Trump all the things that you said Biden was calling him.  I look forward to you applying to the President the phrases "disloyal wannabe dictator," "evil and intent on destroying America," "un-American," and "traitorous intent."
This is a brilliant take. I bet this is where the VP search lands -- the candidate who would be best-positioned to insulate Biden (and Obama).
I wish republicans believed what leftist believe about Joe Biden and I wish leftists believed what republicans believe about Joe Biden.
Looking forward to "I once again vastly overestimated the President. I apologize and now acknowledge that the man is a fascist lunatic, and that Mr. Biden's prediction was not in fact "over the line," but tremendously prescient."  That's what you're writing, yes?
We seem to forget that Trump is a few cards short of a deck. Biden could win a debate by staying on script while Trump goes off about how he's the stablest of geniuses and fittest and the best doctor and best truck driver and whatever he invents for the day.
Biden's team has wisely positioned Joe as the "Not Trump" candidate and done its level best to keep him out of the spotlight and put all of the attention on Trump.   With a big lead, there's not much incentive for Biden to agree to a debate: all risk, no reward.
Time for a new revolution.
Biden looking Presidential and prescient today.
Fun Fact: Joe Biden appeared in several debates for the Democratic Primary. This year. Was he 'great'? No. But is Trump good at debates? LOL, no. Trump would have to answer questions on everything he's done wrong and LOL it's a really long list.
Ohio elected Sherrod Brown. With the right message, Biden can win it.
Enough about Biden, let's talk Kanye.
I think Barr will try to arrest Susan Rice in September when "Dunham Report" (sp?) for unmasking Carter Page comes out; Barr will allege illegal spying. It will be a circus. Susan looks too depressed to me. Resting sad face. Biden has to pick Kamala.

100% ABSOLUTELY. Yang made it clear.  1. Biden is one term. So 2024 is an open election. 2. Biden will put Yang in his Cabinet.  This will help Andrew overcome his greatest weakness. Executive experience in DC. He'll see, How the sausage is made." 3. Yang will build connections.
If she was 7 years old he would be a Biden voter.
So you mean that we are going to get support for the "mesita" under Biden and support for fake parliamentary elections where the real opposition cannot run.
I don't know.  I think Maduro thinks Biden wins and is waiting for that.  Although he is humoring the EU because the fake opposition has been a bust (I'm not sure if you saw the story about the lack of candidates), he cannot promote some sort of rebellion among the "base."Translation: Democrats maintaining control of the House is a FAR higher likelihood than Biden winning the presidency
What about Pete Buttigieg, shining star, future of the Democratic Party, "no limits," highly praised by VP Biden, exquisite speaker, very hard-working &amp; successful surrogate/fundraiser for   ? This is a real snub. And yet there are Kasich, Sanders, the Clintons.
"wants to improve our country" and "has nothing negative to say about joe biden" are two positions I can't understand how anyone could have. The cognitive dissonance üò¢
It blows my mind that the same people who think that picture of Biden kissing his granddaughter on the head at a funeral is totally the creeper‚Äîwhile the guy who kisses his daughter on the lips and said she's "hot," a "piece of ass," and he'd date her... He cool.
yeah why wont more people understand that america sucks at doing good things which is why we need biden
This is shameful. And a big reason why the left will never truly trust Joe Biden, even if we pragmatically support his election this November.

Wait, so this isn't Biden v. Trump but China v. Russia? This is why addressing election interference should be a top priority for everyone, not just one party. Fair and free elections is in everyone's interest.
Echoing on what I just Retweeted. I DON'T GIVE A FUCK about what comment Biden has said. It's nothing compared to what Trump has said and DONE for last 4 years. Those that obsess and over-amplify small comments by Biden needs to STFU!!!  Tired of certain folks being distracted
That was my guess re Bloomberg's intentions. That and Biden getting replaced with Buttigieg at the convention. Tho that assumed a live convention where Biden sundowned mid-speech.  But the smoky room could still swap in Buttigieg and VP Michelle. They'd be a neolib dream team.
Let's see...  China wants Trump to lose while Russia wants to hurt Biden's campaign. Dueling bots ahead, perhaps. Brace yourselves, voters.    via
I think Biden should just call his black voters moon crickets. I want to see something

Good luck. Biden is being hidden by the Dems to protect his mental state. He‚Äôs gonna drop out soon. Watch.
The time for this argument was the primaries. Now the Democrats have made their bed and they‚Äôre gonna have to fucking lay in it. Biden is probably gonna win anyway.
No more than you do about Biden. What makes him a leader
of course I‚Äôm voting for the guy, but I promise you that Biden doesn‚Äôt need Russia‚Äôs help to denigrate him.

American evangelicalism is predicated on white supremacy. That's the foundation of the faith tradition. So when Trump says Biden is going to "hurt God," he's poorly articulating a firmly held belief that whiteness is a blessing and embracing diversity is an attack on God's plan.
Well, coming from Mr. Two Corinthians, Biden probably considered it a win.

Good to know: what the US intelligence agencies think about Russia, China and Iran's efforts to meddle in our elections (Russia is anti-Biden, China and Iran are anti-Trump).
Ick. A vote for Trump is akin to a vote for a grapefruit. Get your facts straight about Biden too.
So now what?  We just let it slide like we did in 2016?  The media needs to step it up and focus on what is important, like our election integrity.  They spent all morning talking about some vague comment Biden made about Hispanics.  Come ON.  Our democracy is at stake.
Trump is totally right. Biden is against God and religion.
US intelligence says Russia is using a range of measures to denigrate Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden. -AP
That‚Äôs too funny. We have a zillion BLM signs here. So far one Biden that I know of.
This guy looks like one of those Biden pedophiles
While many may want to stop and focus on this one single moment in time on what Biden said,  as a black man I was and am in no way offended or threatened by his statement , unlike the clear and present dog whistling that Trump has and continues to press across the nation.
All you people who don't find Biden "exciting" need to grow up and read this üëáüèæ
Seems clear that only Russia has an active campaign working to go after Biden and help Trump.
#Biden REGARDING LOVE FOR/FAITH IN GOD &amp; POLICIES REFLECTING THAT, DID ANY OF U STOP BLACK GENOCIDE, DECIMATING THIS RACE SINCE DR. KING'S KILLING? USING SATAN'S, "..steal..kill..destroy" (John 10:10) WEAPONS: LETHAL DRUGS; ASSAULT WEAPONS; GANGSTA RAP; IMMORALITY; ILLITERACY..?
I like her, but Florida is such a key state, and we don't want to throw fire on the Florida GOP fire. I'd love to see her in the Biden admin.

How do you think it compared with the racism, sexism and general contemptible horribleness from Bros to Hive, Warren, Amy, Biden and Pete supporters?
The kind that will be voted out on November 3rd trumps acts of ignorance are not being overlooked trust me the American voters with intelligence see what he is doing that is why trump and his ignorant supporters will piss and moan when he loses to to the great Joe Biden

Seems clear that only Russia has an active campaign working to go after Biden and helping Trump.
If Biden really wanted to win the election he would totally set up a secret back channel to Russia, promise to drop sanctions, and pull our troops out of Germany. Right,  You fucking traitor.
Seems clear from this letter that only Russia has an active campaign working to go after Biden and help Trump.
Seems clear that only Russia has an active campaign working to go after Biden and help Trump.
Trump needs Putin? At least present evidence to support your crazy theories! For example if I said Biden‚Äôs needs Americans to be dumbed down to be elected, I would offer the move of a IL State Rep to end history classes as evidence! Among other things!

Let‚Äôs just hope Biden doesn‚Äôt pardon the turkey too.
Guys, relax, a fortune teller from the American University says Trump will lose.
How come no one ever talks about the same blue suit every male politician seems to wear? Whomever is picked needs to have a thick skin. And frankly, Biden needs a superstar with heavy political chops who‚Äôs media savvy because he‚Äôs light on charisma.
When was the last time Joe Biden advocated for policy on abortion (and/or many other issues) that was consistent with a traditional Christian worldview? Joe‚Äôs party wants to deconstruct/dismantle norms that are viewed as essential by Christian theology and philosophy.
Bet not since voting for Biden in New York does absolutely nothing, and he just called out the DNC for stopping Bernie.
87% of Democrats support "Medicare for All," though Joe Biden doesn't
Neither Trump or Biden are model Christians.
I can't believe no one has publicly connected the dots. Dot 1: GOP refuses to make a deal Dot 2: Trump announces unilateral action to give people money (and hopes it's blocked by courts) Dot 3: Campaigns on "I tried to help when Biden democrats didn't."
Gotta' love Gretchen Whitmer. Actually, she 'should' be Biden's VP pick. She would get back the white female vote that fled from Hillary and would energize the moderate suburban voters. Unfortunately, a black female running mate is being forced on Joe by black female voters.
I knew Sam was getting in on some action when he started doing Biden apologetics. Congrats dude
Yup. I am instructing you to vote for Biden. That is exactly the point of my post and this entire thread that, at best, you misunderstood and, at worst, you just ignored so you could be a dick üôÑ
I think we‚Äôre gonna have a tie but instead of voting on it Congress, we‚Äôll just have Trump and Biden get married and rule together.

More like a Biden rally with him still in the basement
Why would Joe Biden move one inch to the left today, after he wouldn't back in March when he was one primary loss away from dropping out of the race altogether, and after all these liberals, progressives, and other left organizations already committed their votes to him?
He will . Been a student of politics for my entire adult life. Biden is destroying himself by simply opening his mouth. He‚Äôs not capable of doing the job. I think the senate will flip. But ultimately the president will prevail.
WHY didn't you bring up ALL the policies that  has done for  Churches? Remember how --- God was under attack under the Obama/Biden admin? Merry Christmas was no longer acceptable? Unreal.
I hear Biden‚Äôs workin with those two Corinthians to take God out.
Biden‚Äôs decline is stunning. I was a big fan of Biden during the Obama admin, but he‚Äôs simply not fit to serve as president right now.
If Biden wins get ready for months and months of people from other countries condescendingly "congratulating" us on cleaning up our mess
I keep seeing posts about Kanye admitting to sabotaging the Biden campaign. Every single article I click references his quote that he is "Walking for President, not running".   Does anyone have a better source on this? The headline is everywhere but nobody actually has the quote.
During the debates, Biden‚Äôs energy plan seemed to focus on electrifying cars without talking about urban planning and reducing reliance on cars in favor of walking, biking, and trains. Does this plan address that?

Biden ain‚Äôt do nothing wrong.
all the white people I regularly interact with now are voting for Biden but I can't say that about my friends and family back home in rural MN.  scared to even ask them what they think about Biden
If you can watch Immigration Nation and tell me Trump and Biden are the same and you're voting 3rd party. The world would be a better place without you. No exceptions.
I find it amusing the media is protecting Joe Biden. His daily gibberish nonsense is getting increasingly bizarre. Half the time I cant even follow WTHeck he‚Äôs trying to sputter our. It makes no sense. Something is wrong. Media doesn‚Äôt care.
Someone please ask Trump why Biden‚Äôs statement was offensive, I guarantee the answer would be amazing

Wait - how did Biden do the same thing?
Biden didn't say what is being attributed to him. Listen to the whole statement.
They're trying to raise Biden's gaffes to a level of seriousness, so they can work it in with discussing Trump. Trump is a historical fuck-up &amp; there's nothing Biden can do to compare to the Death Clown in a meaningful way. It's stupid sh*t! Biden needs to make the best choice!
Ana.... unless Kanye pulls white and Brown voters from  Biden (the reasons dems lost in 00 04 and 16) he won't be a threat.   Getting Biden to Obama's 08 or 12 white support in FL or Hillary's 2016 Hispanic support there is more important.  A rapper won't be why Biden loses.
Authority feels opressive. And if I‚Äôm going to vote for my leader I‚Äôm not voting for someone who thinks like Trump or Biden. They are too old and too stupid and it‚Äôs OBVIOUS
No one will be disappointed when Biden ends up picking Chris Dodd, right? üòé
But you got to understand is that it doesn't matter if Trump wins or Biden, wins we all lose in the end. Both are basically the same except one is a fascist. I'm not going to vote for the lesser up to evils again because "orange man bad".
Joe Biden and Kamala Harris the ultimate cop duo. They been locking niggas up since the early 90s. And like sheep niggas are gonna herd

Trump‚Äôs statements reveal just how secretly racist he is:  -Telling people that they aren‚Äôt really black if they don‚Äôt vote Republican. -Saying that poor children are as smart as white kids. -Saying blacks are not diverse, unlike Latinos.  Oh wait, that was Biden.
Also my face with their fake outrage when they claim Biden is racist, while simultaneously &amp; whole heartedly embrace Trump's racist and bigoted behavior and verbiage!

Yeah, there just isn't anyway a black joe biden voter would be enthused about kanye entering the race. Any black vote that kanye gets wasn't voting for Joe anyway.
Well the people who are running his campaign are Republican consultants. If he would just play music and shut up he might poach a few votes from Joe. But he wants to open his mouth so I don't expect him to do well at all. Black joe biden voters are not pivoting to kanye.
People for whom their vote hinges on the VP pick were never serious about voting for Biden anyways. It's a lame excuse. These Republicans in sheep's clothing.

I can't wait for the GOP and the Trump campaign to imply that Hunter Biden was at the bottom of this scandal... it's coming soon!
Trump really has a way of making Biden sound like he's a way better candidate than he actually is
If Harris becomes the VP, Schiff can be considered for her replacement in the Senate Intelligence Committee and that would get him media coverage and a double addition to Biden's campaign
Did they also rip off Joe Biden‚Äôs logo?
What Biden said earlier was this: "Oooooooooh. Latino lives matter more than Black lives because there are more of them, just so you know."  My god, we have two racists running for president...
So what do you want to do, burn the state?  At least President Trump can find Ohio.  Where's O'biden?  Obama speaks for Biden, Jill speaks for Biden, but Biden never speaks?  Takes no candid questions, only responds to specific journalists, when he knows the question &amp; answer.

Jill Biden appeared on Fox.  She wanted us to know, that "Joe is still the most moderate Democrat, but that's not to say, he's not Progressive?"  Dah!  She can't tell the difference.  Why are Jill &amp; Obama speaking for Joe?  Don't let this cadaver get away w/o debate!  #Hollowman
Exactly. I'm tired of hearing about it. The DNC are really ticking me off lately. Biden can't pick anybody that doesn't have "baggage." If not, &amp; the perfect running mate is out there, Trump's goons will just make something up anyway.
If Biden does not say that, how can Trump hear it?? Unless, of course, he's lying. Again.

If Harris is the VP, then Schiff could be appointed to the Senate and the Senate Intelligence Committee. That would get him media coverage in the campaign and with Biden getting much less coverage than trump, Schiff getting air time would be a big plus
This election is between trump and Biden. Not Hillary, Obamam or Pelosi.   We've seen what Biden did as VP for eight years. We've seen what trump has NOT done in the past nearly 4 years. Before this country is destroyed, we must make a choice.  I've made mine.
obama and biden expanded concentration camps, which are filled with 47% black haitians, you're a fucking nazi of an organization to support that btw, you need to die
You are correct. Democrats picked Biden to play it safe. Well, Susan Rice is Awesome but way too easy to connect her to Hillary and Benghazi.  The Trump Nuts would feed on this and distract from the real issues like, 1000 Americans a day dying. The 4 Benghazi deaths would "trump"

This election cycle is very weird. We don't even know who Biden's vp is. Will there be any debates? I think biden should hold out for no taxes no debates. The Republican convention is closed to press. Just a very odd presidential election.
Just because Trump is Evil Personified doesn't mean Biden is the Devil.
Democrats are in the grip of Socialist/Marxists.  Democrats nominated Biden, but they are getting Bernie Sanders. AOC, Obama, &amp; Beto.   This is bait &amp; switch.  America would never vote for Marxism or Socialism, so they are riding into office in a Trojan Horse; Joe!
Politics should work the way Biden asks the governor of California for a favor, and if the intention to appoint Schiff is made public with the Harris for VP announcement, that would put Schiff back into main media play during Biden's campaign
Totally misleading statement from a diehard Democrats. Anyone supporting and voting for an old demented fart, Joe Biden for president should have his head examined. Furthermore, the Democrats have turned communists.
Probably, because if they‚Äôre not, why push mail-in voting if Biden can actually debate Trump?

I share Biden's Faith. Pope Francis sent a memo to American Cardinal's &amp; Bishop's as a reminder that all social justice concerns must be taken into consideration in this election, not just abortion &amp; gay marriage. Separation of Church &amp; State? Anyone? JFK did, Biden should too.
These Sanders supporters want to destroy the democratic party. They claim to want to reform it but they have twice been rejected by rank and file dem voters. And now they want to prevent us from receiving PAC money. Join the DSA and fuck off.

Because trump has to get twenty times more airtime than Biden
I'm voting for Biden regardless of his VP choice.  However, given the campaigning restrictions necessary because of COVID, selecting someone with a certain degree of name recognition would be helpful. It's the whole "a heartbeat away from the presidency" thing.
Seriously, the ‚Äútoo ambitious to be VP‚Äù stuff is mind boggling. Biden is going to be 78. Never said anything about a second term. Age is a huge factor for the VP. Whoever he chooses is the odds on favorite to be the front runner in 2024.
It will be the party to end all parties. Living in Chicago, I remember how excited I was and the feelings of pride I had when President Obama won in 2008, it'll be rivaled by the feeling I'll have when we have President Biden!!
I know that Biden used big words and you hate that so if you want to talk about cognitive decline I am just going to say 5 words: Person. Woman. Man. Camera. TV. Is that more your speed?
That's not a surprise, wait till they find out what Biden has done.
They put up Biden of course it isn't going to work. Nobody likes that child molester
I'm arguing that defeating trump should come first and people shouldn't support trump, just because Biden doesn't rise to their extreme progressive agenda
This is really sad. I don‚Äôt like Biden for a number of reasons but his handlers allowing him to make a fool of himself and make it worse with a failed attempt at humor is verging on elderly abuse. Snarky comments to obviate from his dementia made it more pathetic.
It doesn't bother me. Can't fix stupid, Herman Cain for instance. I will say, when I put out my Biden sign &amp; flag, 2 neighbors quit speaking to &amp; even waving at me.

Agreed. He'll need something like a separate commission because Congress will be too busy. Every Republican is complicit in every crime committed by Trump.   Makes me nervous even talking about Biden definitively winning. The GOP will cheat, lie, suppress the vote, etc.Joe Biden is dumber than a bag of doughnuts how do you guys not see it. He can‚Äôt even talk properly.. flubs his words all the time and loses my interest immediately
People are brainwashed to think nothing can be worse than trump. Even if trump is as bad as some people think, Biden is inherently worse.
We were talking about Trump but sure let‚Äôs bring up Biden since y‚Äôall know Trump is awful. No the 1994 bill was awful and unlike Trump supporters we accept what Biden has done wrong. Want to talk about the Obama administration and it‚Äôs accomplishments.

If the Dems sweep, Federal taxes will go way up. Biden already promised it. Your money is going to be used to bail out the  Dem cities and states whose economies have been destroyed by Dems.

Donald Trump beat Hillary Clinton so badly and the left will never get over it. They tried to destroy him with the all costs, it never worked out for them, never will.  And this November he will do the same for Joe Biden...oh boy!
'Daily Show' releases video mocking Trump for stumbling over his words  via   Gee. Isn't that the subject of one of trump's ads against Biden?
Always Remember Joe Biden Misled Everyone About Wife&amp;#8217;s Death, Blamed Innocent Man for Years . Biden  have an issue with telling the truth  !!!!
Are you guys capable of making, like, positive Trump ads instead of negative Biden ads? Or are you only able to lean on (manipulated) negativity because you know that Trump has done nothing positive?
In Dec of 2019 Trump was saying he would probably not attend any debates for 2020. Now that he is losing big time he is willing to,take any chance to get an extra vote. I say, Biden should just skip the debate.
Good, but If I were Biden I would demand that Trump reveal his tax returns or NO debates!
Biden will crush trump in a debate.
If Biden wins all your taxes will be raised to bail out cities destroyed by incompetent power hungry Dems
You are a real danger to the Americans health and democracy! Lying daily ! Biden was in a basement, but Trump was in a bunker hiding like bones spear spanky he is !
I wish every President had a failure like President Trump.  Except Joe Biden, because he never will be the President.
I uhhhhhh gotta click just for whatever that Trojan Horse Biden ad is going to be.
But how would democrats get them to get fake dead people ids to vote for Biden?
That‚Äôs why a vote for Biden is actually a vote for whomever he chooses as VP
Maybe more!  Because the Democrats will send the votes until Biden will have more than Trump. That's their point of the voting by mail!
Be ready at their convention when they replace Biden for whatever reason they come up with.
Even worse. Biden is the Left mob puppet.
I'm sure that after Biden's win (never it will happen), the left would have the schools opened immediately! Democrats Hypocrites!
Better than Biden. No doubt about it.
Everyone should know that the Democrats will send the votes by mail until Biden will have the votes to win.   Hahahahahahahahahahahaha...
Because of my job I drive all over the country all year round.  Judging by only the signs, i don't remember Biden's signs in any state. Listening to the local radio stations and talking with some people, my impression is: people want the security and prosperity.  But with Trump!
Biden‚Äôs health seems to deteriorating fast. Part of the democrat plan. I would say they would have to replace him soon, probably at their convention. Has anything like this ever happen before?
Biden urged not to debate Trump so president doesn't have another platform to 'lie'   I'm not so sure it matters, cause trump will lie about everything any time, anywhere at any opportunity.
Wall Street just reported the worst quarter in history. Biden literally couldn‚Äôt do worse!
You mean, Biden in the Nursing home in November?
They just sent us vote by mail forms didn't even request them. Early voting 10 minute walk from home so we're voting Biden in person here in Schaumburg Illinois.
Unlike Trump, Biden will hire the very best staff.
They are only Anti Trump supporters. Doesnt mean they like Biden
You mean the same right that went ballistic over Obama‚Äôs suite and salute? I will say this much, there will be worse protest if Biden: 1) Use foreign policy for personal benefit 2) Have family members working in WH and using that to enrich themselves 3) Use fed against protest /1
There is 0 chance Biden will win in Dixie.
Hey dummy, what about these stats? Trump got no chance.  Chance of winning the electoral college: Biden 91% Trump 8%  Chance of winning the most votes: Biden 99% Trump 1%  Estimated electoral college votes: Biden 347 Trump 191
If trump wins again it‚Äôll be worse. Biden will at least give us some normalcy with the government and the world. And start a road to recovery. It won‚Äôt be overnight though. Those that don‚Äôt vote either way just gave up our children‚Äôs future.
Yet another example of something Trump had nothing to do with and is a result of Obama/Biden work.
Trump Warns That 'Jobs Will Disappear' If Biden Is Elected. Jaws Drop.   Funny, jobs have already disappeared in the millions on president dung's watch, and it's getting worse. He's getting more and more despite and getting worse!
Time for Trump has expired. If he doesn‚Äôt resign and have Biden pardon him he will be in prison next year.
There are more Trump haters than any other group in the country. Biden should be happy to have them. Bye Bye Trump!
Having Biden in control of the codes is far less scary than having someone with Alzheimer‚Äôs like Trump.
Biden had a STROKE. Biden had a STROKE!
He already served two termzzz ur running against Biden sweetheart
Bernie has been cancelled in my eyes since he endorsed Biden they can both grow old together in the nursing home now it‚Äôs over lol
How could jobs disappear more or the market crash more (we just dropped the most in 1 qtr in history)? Trump has killed both 152,000 people and our economy. Biden will stop the killing and job loss.

We are so weak in the worlds eyes now. Biden will have to MAGA
More than half of them don't want him reelected, and he loses more support in congress and in the senate each day. There's no surprise that the Lincoln project is doing so well and gaining so much revenue and turning moderate Republicans over to Biden.
a Biden/Harris ticket would be detrimental to all the progress made on criminal justice reform
Told you, they will pick a far left vice president and if Biden wins he will be declared incompetant and the Vice Pres will take over where Vp had zero chance if running as pres

I no longer buy the mental illness angle they are pushing. This is all a marketing ploy from a family of hucksters.
That Trump believes that Biden could "hurt God" exposes the shallowness, the superficiality, of Trump's own beliefs. Believers in God know that God is stronger than either Biden or Trump.
Biden is portrayed as a familiar face and reliable statesman in contrast with the volatile Trump. In reality, he promises to be the most liberal president in history, writes

These attacks will only get crazier as Trump realizes he's going to lose in November, and lose big. Trump has no bottom, no morals, no ethics and no "red line" he won't cross while making up attacks on Biden.   ---&gt; Hang on to your hats, turbulence ahead!
I'm voting for Biden even if he picks me for VP.
I think Rubio is right and the hearing showed that (outside of Murphy who appears to be allied with the "mesita") but I certainly hope that Guaido and Borges are lobbying Biden's team for repudiation of the December 6th farces.
Evers did a point better in 2018 against Walker. He was able to win the Town of Vienna in northern Dane County. This is a Town that Biden will want to win come November as it would show improvement over Clinton in the rural areas around Madison. 4/5
The sixth region in my Wisconsin breakdown series is my home region, Dane County. There is probably room for Biden to grow here compared to 2016. While not the most Democratic region in the state, this is the most liberal region in the state.  1/5
Bull. He was on track to win the nomination.He swept the early primaries and the DNC panicked &amp; brought out the Big guns (Hillary, etc) to trash him.Biden‚Äôs campaign was broke and in the toilet before Clybourn and SC. Arm twisting to get Amy &amp; Pete to dropout and endorse Joe.

They all back him, defend him &amp; turn a blind eye to the havoc he's causing. So yes, never trump IS never Republican. A non-vote for Biden, is a vote for trump.
Just when I think  can‚Äôt be crueler than he already is, he attacks a devout Catholic saying Biden will hurt g-d. Trump is beyond contempt but I still feel he will hijack the election.
I didn't know Joe Biden was that powerful.üòÅ
I can't wait for the GOP and the Trump campaign to imply that Hunter Biden was at the bottom of this scandal... it's coming soon!
Really? This babbling nonsense is probably HELPING Joe Biden
Can Joe Biden make a boulder so heavy that even God can't lift it?
Venezuela is still a priority.  And it is Guaido's job to ensure that it is a similar priority if Biden wins.  It is a marathon, not a sprint.
Yeah I‚Äôve been getting the secret Biden emails sent to me. All about no energy, no God, no more APPLE PIE FUCK IT ALLLLL MMMWWWWWWHhahahhahahahahahahhhahahahahhaha üòà
Did they also rip off Joe Biden‚Äôs logo?
. really needs to know the VP pick though before voting for Biden over Trump.
What Biden said earlier was this: "Oooooooooh. Latino lives matter more than Black lives because there are more of them, just so you know."  My god, we have two racists running for president...
Did Trump and Biden have an in-depth religious discussion where they gave their viewpoints on God and Jesus? It seems one lives the life Jesus preached; the other is the antithesis of anything Jesus stood for.
Biden holds his Bible right-side-up.
Oh yeah, and I think Kamala scares the ever-loving shit out of men. (Which I'm ok with)
Stacey Abrams has NO federal governing/foreign policy experience. To put her in line behind an aged (probably 1 term) Biden doesn't seem like the best choice.   Kamala - is a solid choice now. But has some issues with black vote.
Trump: "Biden is against God." Biden: "Sorry I didn't immediately respond to our lying, misleading Tweet.  I just returned from Church." Trump: "Hush, this is an important putt!"
Ideally Biden and his team will come up with a better strategy to help pressure Maduro for a negotiated electoral solution.  But the concern is that they listen to false opposition influencers and support Fal$on and other Maduro pawns to help shore up Maduro's dictatorship.
Dude check my feed. Look at how people is upset at what Biden said but was like fuck it compare to trump. Feel free to she how the 98% live
Why do you post these inane headlines? This is not news. You are spreading falsehoods. Have you covered whether Trump has ever been known to be a church member or church-goer during his adult life? Biden has been a devout Catholic his entire life.
Biden is ‚Äúagainst God‚Äù and he is going to ‚Äúhurt The Bible.‚Äù This from a guy who broke 78 of the 10 Commandments.
Biden is objectively better than Trump. Biden can pick a toaster as his running-mate and I‚Äôd still vote for him. #LincolnVoter
True.  Guaido should spend his time lobbying Biden now on Venezuela.
As for Bolton, I do not care as I think Biden will likely win.  This is why I am interested in Biden's advisor's thoughts on the subject and hope he will repudiate farce elections and the mesita and reaffirm support for Guaido.
What you fail to forget republicans are given a chance every year. Shit there was an entire group willing to vote for him. But he kept being racist and he lost them. And they hate Biden too.
Watch what happened at 0:28 in ‚Å¶ broadcast: "Biden Racism, DNC Secret Weapon? Jobs Report, ObamaGate and more!" w/ Author Brenden Dilley #TheDilleyShow
Oh Biden is a white moderate. But I find it funny trumpkins pointing out when racist runs deep in their little crew.
The part where you won't say that you'll vote for Biden, as opposed to not voting at all or voting for Kanye.
No, not illegal at all. Completely disengenuous. From a racist mind set. And motivated by a desire to pull voters in key states from Biden.  It's gonna fail just like everything else Trump and his people try. But, we gotta fight like they are gonna win to make sure.
And what do you mean by creative?  Surely you do not think that Biden should throw Guaido under the bus and endorse fake parliamentary elections with the mesita.  Because that seems to be what you are insinuating.
A true election could be used by Guaido, LeLo, etc. to generate political change.  But to get that right now diplomacy and sanctions are needed.  And outright condemnation of any farce elections and sanctions against the mesita.  It is crucial that Biden support the last point.
Banned yet from Twitter today? Doctor any pictures of Biden yet today?  Play any golf today yet? Mislead Americans today yet about the seriousness of the pandemic? Wait, I guess it‚Äôs still early to do all four yet. I will give you a couple hours to comment about TV ratings.
Biden knows how to interpret pandemic charts without help from journalists. Trump‚Äôs constant, chronic lying and rambling, incoherent statements shows that he has no brain capacity.
Biden would have saved over 160,000 American lives.
Too busy covering up his other crimes, dreaming up ways to hurt Biden, and prepping for the horrors to come.
trump is manipulating and burying things and classifying things and hiding things so he can cheat his way to the very end of his term.  Then... we're gonna get him.  Cannot wait.  And Biden will NOT pardon him.
It will be hilarious if Trump come in 3rd behind Kanye West and Joe Biden. üòÑ
Not originally my idea, but I like it: Trump has to release his tax returns as a condition for Biden to debate him.
If a reporter asking Joe Biden about taking a cognitive test is not telling enough, Biden‚Äôs angry and inappropriate response appears to validate the concern about his deteriorating cognitive function. Sad but his diehard followers will remain in denial.
The article wasn't "Biden faces crowd during public speech," it was refuting frequently-shared misinformation. Especially after the 2016 election and all the misinformation leading up to it, that actually seems kind of important.
The Onion character is great.  I want the Onion Biden as President.
I agree.  You have to be naive to think that Maduro will give up power.  He did not after the elections that Biden insisted on in 2015.  I certainly hope that Biden supports Guaido fully rather than the mesita and Fal$on.
Does Biden even have values besides orange man bad and beat trump? Nope
Personalities matter when it comes to elections.  Sorry WOLA, Murphy, and sadly the Biden campaign..  but Venezuela is not going to vote for the crap the mesita shovels out.  Also, why can't Biden firmly endorse Guaido, reject fake elections, and reject the mesita.
Perhaps Biden could come out and repudiate the farces in December and also reject the mesita and ask for sanctions against them.
Biden speaks coherently. Trump flails his hands, rocks back and forth and babbles and rambles. Not only does he lie, he makes up crazy, illogical nonsense. He can't read either. An intelligent President is a good thing.
Biden is not trying to kill us- or take our health insurance away.
Biden may be the majority choice in America, but Trump and his thugs are trying every possible corrupt tactic from cutting off the census, re-drawing district lines, stifling  the US Mail and intimidating voters. Trump wants total autocracy and he‚Äôll cheat to get it.
I remember hearing something that this would require a rules change. I do feel sorry for Biden. It's terrible what is happening to him, but the time to get him out is long gone. If they were to find a way, they'd have to give it to Bernie. He's the runner up.
Unfortunately some on the left, namely WOLA and a few US Senators (cough: Murphy: cough) are using Guaido as a pawn for their political/ ideology fights in the same way they accuse Trump of doing.  Which is why Biden should ignore them at all costs.
Robin Williams summarizes perfectly Joe Biden‚Äôs character in this clip.
He‚Äôs ok. He‚Äôs Joe Biden. Lol
Then why say he must be defeated? You defeat by voting for the viable contender. Not voting or writing in is a vote for the orange shit gibbon. Steele is a repugnicon enabler that resulted in the election of the shit gibbon. He needs to own it and back Biden.
I‚Äôve said it before with past Dilley Shows, but this might be his BEST!  Watch ‚Å¶ broadcast: "President Trump VS Joe Biden, Walls Closing in and Special Musical Guest Miguelifornja!" w/ Author Brenden Dilley #TheDilleyShow
The US has strong institutions that will prevent it, especially the courts.  Even the GOP wasn't down with Trump trying to delay the election.  However, if you are concerned about the elections, I'd encourage you to organize so Florida goes to Biden by a good margin
But the POS isn't voting for Biden so tell me how that helps?
Exactly. I'm tired of hearing about it. The DNC are really ticking me off lately. Biden can't pick anybody that doesn't have "baggage." If not, &amp; the perfect running mate is out there, Trump's goons will just make something up anyway.
If Biden does not say that, how can Trump hear it?? Unless, of course, he's lying. Again.
Die-hard Democrats I know are fed up about the prospect of Biden, and holding their nose; they must feel at least a little like the 2016 GOP felt: "We had 15 legitimate candidates with at least as much to offer as the next, and...THIS is who we're rallying behind?"
Does Joe Biden‚Äôs wife hate him? How do you let your spouse who‚Äôs clearly suffering from dementia continue to go out and do this?
Biden's lone selling point: "He's not Trump."  Meanwhile, the Dems have failed to #OwnTheNarrative around anything related to policy, in no small part because their candidate seems to be locked in a basement 24/7, only to come up for air and yell "Come on, man!"
Neat.  So Trump can arrest Biden and outlaw the Democratic party and claim popular mandate.  Because that is how Maduro "won" in 2018.  And I'm not sure when we recognized Guaido before any election.  He was recognized in 2019.
Great.  So what is Biden going to do to get rid of Maduro?  We cannot even get Biden to condemn the fake "elections" in December.

Your are confusing Joe Biden with Donald Trump.  ü§£ü§£
It is as childish as Trump's outbursts for Murphy to have foreign policy views based on hating foreign leaders/ oppositions like Guaido just because they are currently allied with Trump.  Hopefully, Biden is more mature than this.
We will because Biden will be President.  üòÅ
No.  What you need is to stick with what Guaido has done so far and the support he has, pressure Biden and the EU to reject any "elections," and see if a savvier US administration headed by realpolitik 1990s/ 2000s Biden, not Obama flunkie Biden, can get a negotiated solution.
No...  Guaido should continue fighting this year and into next year.  He should be working to get continued recognition from Biden/ EU in 2021.  The only way is a negotiated solution and a transitional government.  There will be no more elections in Venezuela.
This election is between trump and Biden. Not Hillary, Obamam or Pelosi.   We've seen what Biden did as VP for eight years. We've seen what trump has NOT done in the past nearly 4 years. Before this country is destroyed, we must make a choice.  I've made mine.
Still trying to figure out what Joe Biden would actually DO to stop the virus, and why we haven't heard about it til now.  I mean, aside from the things that would be shot down by the Supreme Court, like a national mask mandate.
They couldn't participate with their parties or candidates.  That is why they boycotted.  But I guess you would consider it free and fair if Trump ordered Biden arrested...
The most important issue facing the world in coming years is the rapidly deteriorating relationship between China and the U.S., yet it gets little campaign attention.
No one in the US would accept Trump "winning" an election after arresting Biden, ordering Roberts to steal the Democratic Party, and selecting Ted Cruz as the "opposition candidate."  Yet, the same people are okay with this happening in Venezuela because..  Che cosplay revolution
That is why Eli Lake suggested that Biden reject the farce elections now and endorse Guaido firmly.  This would put any doubts to rest.  Murphy's mesita aligned views are concerning given that he is supposedly an "establishment Democrat."
No they couldn't.  The puppet electoral committee barred the main parties AD, PJ, UNT, and VP from participating in 2018.  AD is basically the "Democratic Party" of Venezuela, so this would be like the FEC banning Biden from getting on the ballot.
Biden and the Democrats should be encouraged wholeheartedly to ignore anything that comes out of Murphy's mouth on Venezuela.  The latest of which appears to be lobbying for the US (aka Biden) to recognize the farce elections in December.
She just admitted they are moving his platform. I hope all you middle of the road dems are listening. Biden is not in control of this . #Trump2020Landslide
The parties couldn't participate in the election - the four main ones AD, PJ, VP, and UNT - nor could the strongest candidates who were either in prison (Lopez) or barred from running for office (Capriles.)  But I guess you'd be okay with Trump arresting Biden.
So in the not too distant future (Friday) I get to interview the author of this piece --  -- for a "show" (podcast? interview? YouTube thing?) that will be posted (hopefully) over the weekend.  CC
Biden backer.
We're not totally splitting hairs here:  said that Joe Biden's quest to find a female running mate is "illegal."  And it probably is.
I believe that despite these ‚Äògood‚Äô polls for Biden, 95% of folks are VERY wary and cautious and will absolutely  vote.  People realize we are fighting a malevolent and evil man that needs to be defeated  with an overwhelming landslide.
What‚Äôs funny is that his campaign right now is actively setting expectations for Biden so incredibly low and for him incredibly high for the debates. And when they actually look like... this? ooof
R U N! Now her and Biden does not govern their own ship..... üò±You don‚Äôt get that high in life not unless you have broken some eggs,ü§î killed, stabbed,molested  oh and need a few politicians to get the okey! Zoning! üëÅüëÅ
At no point during the campaign did Biden -- or any other Democratic leader -- pick up the phone (or send a tweet), call Trump and ask "Mr. President, how can I help stop the virus?"  It was -- and still is -- about playing politics. There was no silver bullet. Scott's right.
Whatever you think of Biden, even if you think he's senile, he's 100% not actively maliciously senile, and frankly I prefer to live the next four years of my life without being ruled by active, actual malice.
Karen Bass is basically Sarah Palin 2.0, isn't she?  The dumb thing is that McCain needed a Hail Mary pass in 2008; I'm not sure what Biden who is way ahead thinks he is gaining with having this controversy.
How did I miss this...
Trump and Biden, fucking and sucking their way across America. That's a show I'd watch
I'd vote for kanyes big toe over Biden.
I continues to astound me that you can critique Biden on gaffes that just actually pale in comparison to your Feckless Leader‚Äôs daily verbal garbage spew. It‚Äôs like you‚Äôre completely unaware. Willful ignorance or blind adoration... you‚Äôre in a cult.
This is how Biden loses Wisconsin.
Joe Biden has dementia April, haven‚Äôt you noticed? TDS blinding you?
That is why Biden repudiating the farce election now would be very helpful.
Biden has dementia and is going to lose
Here it is.
Not sure if you saw Eli Lake's editorial encouraging Biden to reject the AN "elections."  That may have an effect.
Yep.  Biden policy advisors constantly r/t WOLA.  Although I don't know why it doesn't happen to be honest, all that is being asked of him is to condemn fake elections that the opposition cannot participate in.
And they talk about Hunter Biden? Trump‚Äôs team are all insider traders- including their families.
This is good news, even though it should have been done months ago. While Trump tries to drag Biden and his son through the mud, this would be a really good time to have some hearing about Pompeo and his wife using the State Department for his own political benefit.  Let's do it!
No.  Lake is saying that Biden should condemn the fake parliamentary elections.
Excellent opinion piece by Eli Lake and I agree with the sentiment 100%.  A statement by Biden rejecting any "fake parliamentary elections" even as a candidate will do a lot to help Guaido and the opposition.  I'd also add that he should condemn the "mesita."
Yeah, don't want a senile old man on stage. On the lying part, Biden could hold his own with Trump
But we have clear basis to know how Biden will treat his VP. Just look at his role with Obama. It‚Äôs clear he wants a rock-solid partner as VP. That‚Äôs Harris.
This is a good theory and I certainly hope that this is right.  It's baffling that Biden would keep someone as far left as Bass on his short list.  The Cuba stuff alone should be a disqualifier.  Maybe it is a bone to the Bernie base.
That seems weird given that Biden has a perfectly boring and normal choice - Kamala Harris - who won't raise that much controversy IMO and checks the dumb diversity boxes that he put himself into.
Bass is so far left that it is baffling that she is getting any additional ink from the Biden campaign.  They probably signed away Florida if Biden picks her based on the Castro stuff (as well as the Venezuela stuff that hasn't been picked up yet by the media.)
Same to you. Trump actually is doing great campaign for Biden. üòÇ
Biden is incapable and incapacitated.
I do not like Trump but I am mostly concerned about policy to Venezuela.  Right now, there are tough sanctions on Venezuela, which I fear will be removed and Maduro allowed to execute Guaido and the opposition by Biden.
Totally misleading statement from a diehard Democrats. Anyone supporting and voting for an old demented fart, Joe Biden for president should have his head examined. Furthermore, the Democrats have turned communists.

Do you have any thoughts on the subject?  Because I know people who have friends in Venezuela who may be tortured to death if Biden wins and sells out Guaido, so this concerns me personally.
How cute. The article makes it look like Biden actually has any input on who the VP candidate will be.   Joe Biden expected to announce running mate week of August 10 -
If we elect Joe Biden, we‚Äôll have an actual normal person running the country, not an insane clown and his insane walking colostomy bag offspring and their crap spouses who don‚Äôt even qualify for security clearance. Thank you for playing. Sit down. (In prison, where you belong.)
But, that is exactly the democratic appeal. We often act in unexpected circumstances that we should act with what has changed. But, the truth is Biden won, because he is the safe choice. His current appeal is normalcy, and the ability to bring normal back. That is his story.
But today you‚Äôre calling Biden indecisive??

This is the Potted Plant Election. Ie most of the people opposed to Trump despise him so much they‚Äôd vote for a potted plant against him. Really we WON‚ÄôT stay home. We are desperate to vote him out no matter how we feel about Biden. It‚Äôs why Biden leads in every poll, state or US
I share Biden's Faith. Pope Francis sent a memo to American Cardinal's &amp; Bishop's as a reminder that all social justice concerns must be taken into consideration in this election, not just abortion &amp; gay marriage. Separation of Church &amp; State? Anyone? JFK did, Biden should too.
I don't think those leaks are genuine. All it does is make Biden look better when he does the easy, expected thing all along.
You mean Biden's AG? (or is Kamala so perfect she can do both?) I haven't seen much serious discussion about criminal charges, but I'm not sure it should be ruled out preemptively. I see the downside in opportunity cost to other structural reform more than norm violation.
Biden will create a better police force that serves all people. Trump will bring in his untrained thugs.
Unfortunately Biden has not articulated a strategy that would get rid of Maduro.  I keep asking and get nothing.  And Karen Bass's name being on the VP list is really concerning when it comes to Venezuela and Cuba.
If not for MN/Floyd  would be the most helpful &amp; hardest for Trump to hit. Hard to tag defund police/socialism on her. If you buy that Biden runs as well as or better than HRC with non-whites then Klobuchar type candidate further helps with college educated whites
Actually Trump has been an absolute boon to the left and has destroyed his own party. Thanks to Trump the left is now the country‚Äôs most potent political force. That‚Äôs why DNC consolidated behind Biden as they hate and fear the left and see it as a threat. Trump fuels opposition
We all knew the Biden play was rigged. Clinton now publicly acknowledges they conspired to stop Bernie, and the will of the people stuck in this two party system to vote for a candidate that actually puts humans over profit. We are all just puppets- they are the masters.
Biden's running mate matters so much to quite a few people I've spoken with.
I keep reading about how Biden is "screwing up" the VP pick because he hasn't announced yet.   Sorry he's not working on your schedule, folks.
It's over. Biden doesn't win shit.
Biden is unlikely to be a turd, and No Turds For VP!!   And emphatically I agree with the "Tired of GOP" sentiment.
Hi Rashida, question, I just saw a post that said you haven‚Äôt endorsed Biden, is this true?
Literally, about the only thing that could lead me to withhold my vote from the Biden ticket. Wouldn‚Äôt matter in Illinois, anyway.  #KarenBass #Scientology
Biden has no choice but to pick Kamala. Make the decision Joe, damn it, this is starting to damage everyone involved.
Remember when Capriles went running to Elliot Abrams with the proposal that the Americans appoint him President of Venezuela and then Abrams said no.  Maybe his buddy Leo Martinez told him that he'd have better luck under Biden which is why he won't STFU.
She fights the good fight everyday!! Vote Biden so she can walk away when she wants to.  #VoteBlueForRBG
Seriously, the ‚Äútoo ambitious to be VP‚Äù stuff is mind boggling. Biden is going to be 78. Never said anything about a second term. Age is a huge factor for the VP. Whoever he chooses is the odds on favorite to be the front runner in 2024.
You make a good point, but only if we survive the next 6 months as a country.  50/50?  This is gonna get ugly, folks.  Barr is going to arrest Susan Rice (which is why she can't be VP). Possibly Biden. Trump still hasn't used a nuke.  Shit's gonna get dark. Not hyperbole, either.
Biden can kiss Florida goodbye if he picks Karen Bass.
It will be the party to end all parties. Living in Chicago, I remember how excited I was and the feelings of pride I had when President Obama won in 2008, it'll be rivaled by the feeling I'll have when we have President Biden!!
It's artificial. They're only making these leaks to the media to make Biden look like he's not the same old white guy Dem when he does what the establishment wants in selecting Harris. It's sleazier than good ole fashioned crotchety misogyny.
These leaks feel like they're designed to make Biden seem more independent and "with the times" when he makes the trashy establishment choice in Harris. Seems very artificial.
Biden and his allies should really drop the whole he'll never meet with Maduro line if he chooses tankie, Karen Bass, as VP.  Or is he just being literal with this because he'll just send VP Bass down to Caracas for a "We Love Maduro" pep rally.
It's interesting because it seems like Trump is going hard after the south Florida Latinos, who do appreciate his tough line on Cuba/ Venezuela and don't particularly trust Biden.
I don't think Biden can really be pushed left that much, if his response to COVID is to shoot down M4A. He's signalling a hard line, which he should pay for on the 'left' edge. Otherwise he'll keep moving right thinking that the left won't fall off as he moves fulcrum rightwards
I agree that voting is about harm reduction. Where I don't agree is that Biden winning actually represents harm reduction over the 10-20 yr horizon
Clearly Biden better than Trump, so if your 'ethical time horizon' is 4 years its' a no brainer. If it's longer than that, some-brainer.
I have no problem with Settle for Biden. If anything it reveals what voting is--minor effort thing, relatively important. I'm still not voting for the guy tho
Karen Bass?  Really?  Biden is trying to actively lose Florida if he picks Castro-lover for VP.  At least he has some pictures of himself with Liliana Tintori which he can hide behind when it comes to Maduro/ Castro.  Not sure what he can do with Tankie Lady on the ticket.
Believe me that the Cuban and Venezuelan communities in Florida hate Susan Rice as well because she is way more connected to the Obama policies on Cuba/ Venezuela that they despise than Biden who can at least point to advocating for important political prisoners in Venezuela.
Heaven forbid a VP run for president....  I'd hate Joe Biden to win.
I think that Biden is going to win and also think that it would benefit Cubans/ Venezuelans to pressure him to go tough on both.  Also, DMP is one of the few Democrats who is very good on Vzla/ Cuba.  It'd be tough to lose her and let the tankies run wild.
Interesting dynamic that has a whole lot to do with foreign policy..  Hint, Biden needs to go way more aggressive on Venezuela than the generic fluff he's put out.
I think that it is the dynamics of Cuba/ Venezuela and appreciation of Trump's tough stance against the dictators in both country.  Biden has to do more than just offer TPS.  He really has to assure these people because they felt burned by Obama.
Yeah he fucks porn stars. Let's see what Joe Biden fucks.
Ever heard of hunter Biden??
Nobody falls for concern trolling from Republicans sharing Biden's past support for certain Republican initiatives as if the guys they'd rather have don't want to triple down on every last one of these things.  You aren't good at diminishing support.
Going to suck when Biden gives Trump and his senior administration blanket pardons after Trump refuses to concede.
I know that Biden used big words and you hate that so if you want to talk about cognitive decline I am just going to say 5 words: Person. Woman. Man. Camera. TV. Is that more your speed?
I have always said the problem with progressives is the people they like are the people America hates. It is never the policies. It is the salesman. Unfortunately a lot of white progressives are very focused on their people. Biden is the best salesman for middle America.
That's not a surprise, wait till they find out what Biden has done.
They put up Biden of course it isn't going to work. Nobody likes that child molester
"I think I'll do well with Bernie supporters" and "Biden is completely controlled by AOC and the radical left" never seemed like a winning combination. Just let us leftists remain depressed about Biden. Why tease us with hope?
Understandable, but I think we need African American voters more than Cubans. Cubans tend to lean republican heavily still, so I wouldn‚Äôt be to focused on just that group of voters. I get the voting power in Florida, but I believe that power is part of the RNC coalition.
Yeah, I am not seeing it here. The Fidel boogeyman thing is out of the trump playbook. The one great thing about trump is he sucks all the oxygen up, even when it hurts him.
This is really sad. I don‚Äôt like Biden for a number of reasons but his handlers allowing him to make a fool of himself and make it worse with a failed attempt at humor is verging on elderly abuse. Snarky comments to obviate from his dementia made it more pathetic.
This is failure on many levels including failure to recognize China as a threat. Mr. Biden, China must be held accountable. An investigation is a must! China must pay, what‚Äôs your policy?
It doesn't bother me. Can't fix stupid, Herman Cain for instance. I will say, when I put out my Biden sign &amp; flag, 2 neighbors quit speaking to &amp; even waving at me.
Oh dear, Joe Biden wrong for moms?  I don‚Äôt think so. Most moms teach their kids to be honest and kind, listen to experts, be of service to others and respect women and people of color...like Joe does. Not like our liar-in-chief.Sad the Democrats cheer because people are unemployed they want to keep America closed, they fear monger and spread political propaganda. Worst run states and cities, are run by Democrats. They support basement dweller Biden,ü§£ü§£ #Trump2020Victory #WalkAwayFromDemocratsForever
Twerp
Dumb ass
DONT BE COMPLACENT, PEOPLE‚Ä¶ as this video explains, Biden might be up 9 points, but when taking into account the margin of error, he may only be up 2.4 points.  Clinton won the popular vote by 2.1 but still lost the electoral college
92% of African-Americans support Biden over Trump.  89% voted for Hillary in 2016.  Seems like he‚Äôs talking to the majority already...
I'm Joe Biden and I forgot where I am again. Can you call me a cab?
Trump hasnt said anything racist. Biden is up to 7 now.
Seriously. Trump makes more gaffes in a day than Biden has made in his whole campaign ( Thighland?)
Have you ever actually listened to your guy? Joe Biden is going to hurt God? Says the guy who doesn‚Äôt go to church about a practicing Catholic. PS nice mental gymnastics talking about the NRA. I guess you don‚Äôt care that rich people steal your money as long as they like guns.
I think Gov. Whitmer is top talent.  She has all the traits needed in national leadership.  I was happy to see she is still being considered for the VP slot.  She would be a huge asset to Biden's campaign.
That is awful. Let us blame the Chinese. Move manufacturing back to the US and cut them deeply as punishment. Trump will make them pay for their crimes Biden will give them a party.
the perv puts his foot in his mouth yet again-smh

So, what they‚Äôre saying is, Biden is leading without even trying.
I watch him almost every night, he is not my favorite, he‚Äôs too much of a Bernie Bro and I can‚Äôt tolerate Michael Moore. Ugh. The Tara Reid crap with Biden infuriated me, I stopped watching for a while. Usually he‚Äôs just background noise while I‚Äôm cooking dinner.
They‚Äôre too busy speculating on Joe Biden‚Äôs running mate.
Biden has made the Equal Rights Amendment part of his campaign platform. #ERANow #Equality #EqualMeansEqual #Biden2020
Never!  Barr is preoccupied with trying to find a nugget of negative information about Biden that he can balloon into a Hindenburg size scandal on conservative media.
in case still had any doubt
Seriously Biden, you wouldn‚Äôt be doing anything because you won‚Äôt be President, you‚Äôre just a basement dweller
Why should Biden have to try to logically argue against a habitual liar. Go away.

Why would you vote for puppet Biden, the radial left are pulling the strings,  The man doesn‚Äôt have any thoughts of his own #Trump2020LandslideVictory
That‚Äôs a no brained, it will be a civil was, both sides will claim victory. That just common sense. Unless we can find a way before nov. to put Biden in jail or something on that level. Buckle up it‚Äôs going to be a rough ride
NO Covid (and other causes) have killed these people. Thanks to Biden, Gates &amp; Obama funding the lab that created the virus! Trump is stopping it all... not to mention saving thousands of kids! Get you‚Äôre head straight and do your homework! Voting Dem is electing Killary Clinton!
Those who vote Demo can‚Äôt see that it WON‚ÄôT be Biden, it‚Äôll be the Clinton Administration... God help us all if this happens! We‚Äôll all end up in concentration camps being tortured for our blood! It‚Äôd become an evil world! üëøüëé
That's a no for me on basement Biden
Hold ur breath until biden makes a lucid statement
Seriously, I don‚Äôt give a crap who he chooses! I have my preferences, sure, but bottom line, I‚Äôm voting for Biden! The Grifter in the White House HAS to go!
A) Vote Biden in. B) Then work on legitimate third party, but delete tRump first.   2 party had worked better when constituents came before party and voting wasn‚Äôt straight party line in congress. Both sides of the aisle worked together and compromised. Though too much pork.
Even moves like travel bans on China were immediately criticized. Specially by Biden. I would love one liberal to fess up and acknowledge that‚Äôs true. The outcome would have been much worse.
So what he works over 20 hours a day and donates his salary, maybe Biden should try it, he‚Äôs looking pretty pale
Nope.
Biden Supporters don‚Äôt want him to debate our President, what‚Äôs the matter are they afraid it will show how weak &amp; unprepared Biden. Biden can‚Äôt speak without a teleprompter.President Trump will destroy Biden in a debate, it will be a beautiful sight to see, Biden is puppet
Suck it Biden #Trump2020Landslide
Wow! I thought I said something of sentiment, but this is so much stronger! I do NOT care who he chooses for VP, I will crawl across broken glass infected w whatever disease to make sure the I vote for Joe Biden!
Dumbo ears and Biden one is worse than the other
It‚Äôs not us (well, most of us), it‚Äôs the media and their frickin‚Äô horse races. They‚Äôre ones pushing that as always. Since there isn‚Äôt one between Trump and Biden, they have to manufacture one somewhere.  üôÑ
I think any of them would be fantastic but I‚Äôm leaning toward Val Demings. I see her as sympatico with Biden and her experience in law enforcement may be what‚Äôs needed right now.
Given Biden is picking a woman of color as his VP why not pick the most qualified who fits the description in Condaleeza Rice?
The ‚Äútalking heads‚Äù played a huge part in destroying our country. Can you imagine if Yang was our candidate instead of Biden?
What positions held makes Biden a socialist? If the dems wanted a socialist, would they not have picked the truly socialist candidate?

Please explain this Biden corruption. He never said any such thing. It‚Äôs been proven and it‚Äôs what Trump was impeached for was trying to dig up dirt on Biden. Go back to watching Fox trying to push HDQ and ‚ÄúDr.‚Äù Immanuel on you.

Joe Biden lives in an alternative universe, his basementDebating tRUMP is a joke. Here's how that will go tRUMP: a bunch of bullshit and lies Biden: thats false and a bunch of lies. And so on and so on.
A candidate‚Äôs faith should have no impact on their electability. It certainly is not a relevant indicator of their ability to be a good/moral/ethical leader.  Who cares if Biden is more religious? He can‚Äôt govern based on his religion, so this is useless.
I would stand, sit, kneel, handstand if I could, headstand, lie on the concrete or in mud while swarms of hungry beetles chewed on my skin.  Rats could chew out my eyes, but I would find a way to vote for Biden.

O look someone who hates Trump's perceived racism but will actually vote for actually racist Biden. Imagine my shock. A hypocritical leftist.
Biden announced that he looks forward to debating Trump - I'd like to see the follow through on that.
For anyone who texted the number Biden sent last night can you tell me who the running mate is please?
Saw a tweet from Jon Cooper that said several sources close to Biden say he chose his running mate if this is true and if it's Kamala Harris then I  am dancing like crazy and a potential dance party
And that Biden....a gifted orator right there right?
Well if Biden decides to run for a 2nd term then yeah but there is a chance he may not run for re election in 2024
Voting for you President Biden is also a privilege....
He worked so hard bashing Biden...
We know and it is a distraction and Kayne will never be president majority of voters aren't suddenly going to switch from Biden to Kayne
He hates strong women i wouldn't mind if she got reappointed AG in a Biden administration she has some unfinished business to do and things that should have been done if Hillary won.

Trump says that Biden will hurt the Bible and God. Biden is a catholic that goes to church more times than Trump and his family ever will. The Trump's are fake Christians in reality they worship white supremacy.
Biden is Catholic...  this is a lie he is ‚Äúagainst God‚Äù!!
Hold on a sec.  This means that, at least to this swing voter, Harris is a better choice for VP. I'm voting for Biden no matter what, but I agree about Rice not being a good choice.

This is why he‚Äôs not going to Milwaukee. He can‚Äôt handle live events - If he doesn‚Äôt go, his nomination acceptance can be pre-recorded, rehearsed and edited to make him look cognitively intact. Trump is going to destroy him in a debate without even trying. Biden fails after 5 min

Michiganders you still have time to vote i recommend voting for Brenda Jones since she is an ally of Biden where her opponent has refused to endorse Biden and booed Hillary during 1 of her rallies.
Yes Florida and 1 more swing state gives Biden the presidency if Biden wins Texas that alone ends Trump's chances of getting re elected
How can this guy accuse Biden of not knowing where he is when this guy can‚Äôt read off a sheet of paper??
Gm everyone Happy Tuesday everyone today is primary day in several states like Michigan please vote today whether that's in person or mail in voting. Today we must elect people like Brenda Jones and replace democrats who refuse to endorse Biden and replace them.
President Trump looses the endorsement of the Revolutionary Communist Party USA. The communist party has given their endorsement to Joe (Mr. Magoo) Biden.
you‚Äôre acting like we like Biden?? üòÉ
How does a candidate not debate? Biden deserves to lose!
Biden took the lead in Texas according to fivethirtyeight on polling data at July 28th it has been 6 days since Biden has taken the lead there and it hasn't shrunk or grown and he hasn't lost the lead which is a very good sign for us. If Biden wins Texas he wins the election
Tomorrow we must elect Brenda Jones and replace Rashida Tlaib for refusing to endorse Joe Biden and for booing Hillary Clinton in one of her speeches. If democrats want to oust Trump they must have every vote if people refuse to endorse Biden and vote 3rd party they not democrats
Possibly. Brown lost it by about 5% while winning statewide by 7%, but Biden may do worse than Brown in some Ancestral D counties and will have to make up that strength in suburban areas. I'd rate it Lean R for president.
That‚Äôs the plan as Biden sucks
Biden would have a better chance then.
Good news for Biden, especially if the Libertarians do indeed qualify.
SD may be a better choice for "Likely R in massive Biden landslide scenario"
Michigan and 1 more swing state and Biden is president
Biden in the IL primary, when it was just Sanders v Biden at that point.
I am with Biden on most everything
Yes with God's grace president Biden's administration will save our nation.
We need you president Biden
Biden's lead in Texas is still holding according to fivethirtyeight he's had the lead on average polling data for 4 days now longer than last time let's hope his lead holds and expands on election day. If Biden wins Texas Trump's hopes of getting reelected are gone
üíØ everyone needs to put their differences to the side and vote for Biden IDC if Bernie lost the primary he will never be president he unfit to be president just like Trump
Being led around by a nurse isn't helping.  I see his yard signs have changed from Biden to ByeDon. Is this their way of opening the nomination?
A VP depending on where there from can offer a regional advantage like Kamala Harris can help Biden do better in Arizona Val Demmings can help Biden do better in Florida and Georgia
IDC who he picks am voting for Biden though i do agree that a person in color is best choice
Vote for Biden no matter who he picks
Biden is probably going to win. His presidency is going to be a disaster, and in 2024 America is going to elect someone many times worse than Trump. You aren't averting any kind of catastrophe by supporting Biden. He's the wetnurse of fascism.
Biden is too stupid to know what that is.
I haven‚Äôt seen that.  But I have seen plenty of hatred directed at Warren, AOC, Harris, Biden.  I‚Äôve also seen things like this:  Frazier, 29, got out of his truck and repeatedly punched a 61-year-old anti-Trump protester in the head outside a Trump rally in Cincinnati, Ohio.
That I call BS Biden doesn't need Bernie's approval for anything he is his own person he chooses whoever he wants and anyone who has a problem with that can 86 me now
Bernie's tweets were better than Biden's.
Even more bespoke: Biden winning Livingston Parish üòÇ
If you are a leftist or liberal and you‚Äôre NOT voting for Joe Biden, you are putting your integrity as a voter above the betterment of humanity and the world.
Oh I‚Äôve seen blacks that are in support of BLM call Conservative Blacks those words on Twitter. It does happen. Those last two sentences sound very Biden like and I‚Äòm concerned.
But but but the polls say otherwise.  I‚Äôm waiting for the Hiden Biden VP PICK
He really can‚Äôt. Not before the election. It would be red meat for Biden and the libs. But he can try other ways to shut his ass down.
We need you president Biden
Voting for corrupt officials like Clinton and Biden? Runs in the family which is foolish.
Do it, now the youth will get out to vote even more strongly for Biden.
I agree. Biden cannot afford to lose any ground in South Florida- it's a big deal.
When talking about Biden‚Äôs VP nothing was mentioned why Biden cannot choose Warren. Warren a great talent but can cause the Democrats to lose the Senate in November. If Biden chooses Warren , the Republican Governor of Mass. will replace her with a new Republican Senator.
Cuomo I believe signed a law doing that where newborns can be aborted after being birthed. I don‚Äôt know why Biden is the solution because even you told me you had some doubts on him.
So where did Biden caress you to win your support for him?
so you‚Äôre expecting a sell off? Funny stat, 85% of the time when market falls into elections, the incumbent loses the election. Hello Biden my old friend
If Biden wins, Barry is in charge
No one loves you for anything except maybe pedophiles that need help staying out of jail. Don't worry you and the rest of the freaks and criminals are going to jail once we have a real president. His name is Biden. Are your internal polls written in crayon?  FAILURE
IDC am voting for Biden no matter who he picks i endorsed Harris for VP but i ain't toxic
A Biden administration would not ban flights from China as he is in their pocket. Plus your economy is 1/500 the US economy and 35x less people.
How original!! I love it! That describes Hiden Biden to a T
like elements on your page but disagree about Biden. He is a good guy..
Thank you Trump's tweet is nothing but a distraction why do people have to fall for this? Come on we need to stop giving Trump anything what he wants is a distraction cause he knows he losing states like Texas and if Biden wins Texas Trump has no path to reelection
Are unicorns sprouting out of Biden‚Äôs ass? OF COURSE they won‚Äôt
Biden didn't do that
Um no. Affordable care act. Biden was part of that. Obama got it done.
Biden will reform the police, Jot defund alike the want to be dictator who is bypassing the police and sending in a private goon squad to hurt people!  The GOP is sick and enabling this guy to hand out country over to Putin!
I will wait until Biden is Oresident before I consider a vaccine!!
#EvictTrump is trending he is bringing down the value of Mar A Lago and the WH. The value of Trump Tower is also going down the drain if we want to bring back value in the WH we vote for Biden no matter how he does in debate stage.
I will proudly vote for Biden no matter what happens am with you 100%
Most of the things under that trend are about Obama and/or Biden.
Finally some good NH polling. Biden leads 53-40. I‚Äôll say Likely D.
A vote for biden is a vote for whoever he picks as a running mate basically. God Help Us if he wins-Heaven forbid.
This has been talked about for months... Biden accused him of this months ago.  There are no provisions to delay ...so we shouldn‚Äôt expect anything less from Comrad Trump.
Biden can pronounce ‚ÄòMinneapolis‚Äô
Joe Biden supported the war in Iraq, which killed at least 500,000 people directly and many more indirectly. That's about 20,000 Bundys
Joe Biden for President 2020. In my opinion, Trump's all ready lost. He is losing big time in the general election. Trump needs to resign.
Biden for President 2020. Let's see who will win in November. Trump's all ready lost based on how he's handled everything recently. Trump is currently losing in the general election. Deal with that.
Well since Rachel Maddow is off this week i hope she enjoys the time off and gets plenty of rest she will need it for January when they indictments come and news stories of Trumpers being charged breaks news if Biden wins
It won‚Äôt be needed ...when Biden takes over, he won‚Äôt need that and all the other useless spending trump and his wife in name only want!   We are in the middle of an economic crisis and this jackass is trying to cash grab on his way out!
"I don't want my kids growing up in a jungle, a racial jungle" -Joe Biden, 1977, talking about desegregation
I understand your pitch, but you're not going to convince me that Biden isn't a white supremacist.
I would not worry about NATO. A President Biden will undo the harm. In February 2021, we need a full investigation into the Trump/Putin disaster. Thanks Anthony for standing up to Trump. Maybe you can help rebuild the Republican party.

Biden leading in Texas now if that lead holds on election day Biden becomes the president no matter what happens now we need to vote like our lives depend on it to make it happen
"We used to push Biden to put forward a vision beyond beating Trump, but since he won't try, I guess we won't either!"Biden apparently thinks there‚Äôs only one black vote, because ‚Äòthose people‚Äô are all the same, unlike the gloriously diverse hispanic crowd.
Trump vs Biden Twitter war.
Combine this with the "you ain't black" if you don't vote for him and Joe Biden is looking pretty racist right now
West said ‚¨á   ‚ùå slavery was a choice &amp; Harriet Tubman didn't help slaves  ‚ùå he wears a MAGA hat and Confederate flag  ‚ùå he has a mental illness which seems to be inconsistently treated  These factors appeal more to Trump's base than Biden's
Right? I don't care if Biden picks a cactus!! Vote them all out!  And fill out your census! üòÄ
People camp on the sidewalk to get Black Friday deals, I'd line for 8 hours to vote for Biden.
Trump was literally sued for racial decriminalization over his Trump apartments.  Biden has received multiple civil rights awards and recognitions.
American voters deserve the truth about your tax returns  ! Jerk!
As funny as it is to think that Biden could hurt god,
This is also how Joe Biden sees the future of America's immigration policy so just keep that in mind when you see people not engaged with voting in a few months
It's time to cancel
Thanks for not covering Biden‚Äôs racist comment.  Your #FakeNews  reputation is intact
Lol, really? I don‚Äôt know if I can vote for Biden if he picks a VP candidate I don‚Äôt like... He could pick a corn cob &amp; I‚Äôll still vote for him. Get over yourself, ma‚Äôam.
I do not want Biden I don‚Äôt want trump. Shit fucking sucks and I don‚Äôt think either can make it 4 years into a presidency. Just focus on your local elections people.
As a white male American  &amp; Donald Trump are not only embarrassing; they‚Äôre also criminals and racial bigots!!! This is the USA not 1930‚Äôs Germany.  #Biden2020ToSaveAmerica #IamAnEmbarrasedWhiteAmerican #Biden #AmericansAreOne
I'm not feeding into the Joe Biden gaffe mess. I HOPE yall know what to do on November 3rd. Thats ALL I care about. FRFR
We need to attack and dethrone God but all Joe Biden wants to do is "hurt" God üò†üò†üò°üò§üò†
Just like how Biden said YOU AINT BLACK if we don‚Äôt vote for him right??? ü§°ü§°ü§°
They are both racist old White men lol Sorry. Did you not just hear what Biden said in an interview the other day. He said the Black community isn‚Äôt as diverse as the hispanic community. Basically dogging us. The whole government is corrupt, I can‚Äôt believe you are falling for it
45 just said Biden is ‚Äúagainst guns.... against god.‚Äù The truly crazy part? This is all most of his base needs to hear. The Idiocracy is strong with the uneducated right.
How is it desperate? Biden LITERALLY said this. Watch the video ü§°ü§°ü§°
Jill Biden is guilty of elder abuse.  There‚Äôs no excuse for her to be putting Joe through this because she‚Äôs desperate to be First Lady.  Jill has to do the right thing if she loves her husband.  #SaveJoe
Tucker Carlson did an EPIC TAKEDOWN of Susan Rice the other night.  If you‚Äôre at all fuzzy on what a seditious freak she is, watch this 8 min of truth to power.
Shows you how much Biden despises black people totally disrespects black reporter why would any black person ever vote for him
So Biden called black reporter a junky because he dared to ask about his mental state and also says he wasn‚Äôt texted but in previous state said he was and was tested all the time which is it and could you imagine if Trump called a black reporter a junky which he would never do
Biden did vote for the bill that stripped student loans out of BKO protection in '05, but has acknowledged it was a mistake and has vowed to fix that after he's elected.
"carceral genocide" was begun in '68 in response to Black Activism, further exacerbated in 1980, under the pretext of Reagan's war on drugs. Biden's crime bill didn't hit the books til '94, so I don't know wtf you're referring to here.
Biden was in the Senate from '73 to '09. The State of DE tax laws that made it a tax haven for corporations was enacted in the late '70's, by Delaware's Legislature, not the US Senate.
The move is the latest example of the pandemic's sweeping effects on the 2020 presidential election and the latest blow to traditional party nominating conventions.
Biden won‚Äôt travel to Milwaukee to accept Democratic nomination amid coronavirus concerns
Legit kinda sad Biden won the primary because he's just so depressing and boring. Where's the Klob getting actually mad
Open schools so 4 million 17 year olds due to turn 18 before Nov 3 can get too sick (or die) to vote.  Evict 1000s of people so they lose a valid address &amp; then their right to vote  Put West on the ticket to scatter the vote away from Biden  Cheating to win again
Biden continues to lose it.
I will support Biden regardless, though my preference is Harris. Harris has the necessary personality and national experience to be a boon to the ticket. The others are not inspirational, Harris is very inspirational.
I mean, how many vows to god can someone break before you start to doubt their word? By the way, Joe Biden hasn‚Äôt divorced or repeatedly and publicly cheated on his wives.
Thank you, President Biden
:-/ is that the one Rudy approached for dirt on Biden. Yeah.. it was. I wonder if Lev has anything to do with this raid?
Depends on where in DE you are. Of you're in the southern part of the state (and/or near the beaches), you're gonna see more Twitler signs. Sussex County is our South. The farther north you are the more Biden signs you'll see. It's a sad truth.
Did you get ‚Äúhoax‚Äù from ‚ÄòMississippi Burning‚Äô? You racist POS! #Biden
Yes, Trump has severe cognitive deficits regarding his executive functioning.  Biden on the other hand is just fine.

It‚Äôs what happens when Donald Trump, Hilary Clinton, and Joe Biden are the best the Republicans‚Äô &amp; Democrats‚Äô nomination processes give us for Presidential candidates. These are the best 3 out of the 328 million US population? üò©üò©
It lays out like this.  He continues to do nothing.  We work HARD to get Biden elected.  In January we have a president that isn't a self-centered fuck and we start what the rest or the sane world did one year previous, and we finally START to get back on track.
I agree. Biden could just sit back, let Trump spew his nonsense and make himself look like the idiot he is.
Biden will be too busy figuring out how to tie his shoelaces to notice he lost.  Pelosi, Schumer and the rest of the commie squad would start a civil war.  Or try to!
maybe you should call Joe Biden.  You should certainly vote for him.
Rude girl!  I wouldn‚Äôt say ‚ÄòFuck Biden‚Äô because there‚Äôs just nothing there to fuck.  Just....nothin‚Äô.
Biden could pick the squirrel l that torments  dog and I'm still voting that ticket.
Raise your hand if What if Biden picks _______? Thoughts?  Redundancy, I hear you
Keeping my eyes open for pictures of Gnarly Jerk, Joe Biden, and iirc Bean Sharpie like this too
I think the fact that he's way behind Biden in the polls, and that he can't handle any negative feedback yet gets a lot of it is just freaking him out so badly that he can't function.
oh a ‚Äúkaren‚Äù then would be a better fit!! Get over your feminist ridiculousness!! Maybe Biden‚Äôs plan fits you better, let antifa take your neighborhood, you probably raised an antifa child anyway!!
I can't wait until President Biden uses this precedent to take down Fox News.

Is Joe Biden obligated to debate Donald Trump?  The purpose of debate is to learn where the candidate stands on issues.  After the Clinton/Trump debates I don't wish to see Mr. T. photo bomb and stalk his opponent again. It was just plain creepy!
Biden has a communist on his short list, Karen Bass.  She wants to eliminate anti-discrimination laws to legalize discrimination against those w/ a #WhiteStory, #RedStory, etc.  Their plan, sacrifice you the individual for the ‚ÄúAltruistic Goals‚Äù of the State.  #twill
DUH???  What planet is Trump on?  Does Biden know where he is?  Someone please stop this LEFT/RIGHT MADNESS!!!
LOL. . .mask NAZI, probably a Biden athletic supporter
But you are supporting a Biden one
Damn right! I'd *also* like Dems to state--for the record--that any move to fill a Supreme Court vacancy between now and 1/20/21 will lead to TWO new Supreme Court seats being created (and filled) by President Biden.
Can you imagine the absolute shit fit  Hannity, Rush Dipshit and all the other fucks would have had if either Clinton, Obama, or Biden even loosely hinted at delaying an election?
This will definitely get Bernie voters to flock to Biden if she's picked
Biden has the greater intellect &amp; emotional intelligence. Voting third party is not my choice as there is not a viable candidate.
Remember when you said this was just some conspiracy bullshit? Is it bad your opponent knows you better than yourself?
Where‚Äôs your apology to Joe Biden?
Gosh Bernie, it means we‚Äôll vote for Biden for sure.  Freebies mean everything to us.  We‚Äôll do anything for the Big Brother who takes care of us.
Biden‚Äôs got voters in Erie, PA!
Come on over. Do you really think Biden will be making the decisions? They will kick him out within 6 months with the 25th. Then a possibility that Pelosi would be VP. Do you really want that?
I can only hope that The Lincoln Project does an ad titled ‚ÄúTrump‚Äôs AmeriKKKa ‚Äú with highlights from Lafayette Sq., Portland, Seattle and anywhere his gestapo thugs have been. The violence is now, caused by him not Biden.
Biden is a useful idiot and it shows.
If Biden chooses a good VP candidate like Tammy Duckworth, Trump wouldn't stand a chance.Your kidding, right? Biden hasn‚Äôt had anybody ‚Äùrecovery‚Äù because he hasn‚Äôt been president! And, as others have pointed out, these are just people returning to jobs they already had. And let‚Äôs not forget the 1.2 million new unemployment claims over the last week. Bunch of idiots
Biden won't even commit to correcting cannabis prohibition which has ruined hundreds of thousand of lives and has 80% support from his party.  Simply not being trump isn't good enough.
VP Biden, I am a Vet, spent 20yrs in the US Army, I am very glad I am glad you running and no how the Military needs a good Commander and Chief. Trump has no idea how to run the Military. We need to get them codes out of Trumps hands. I got your back Joe. üòÄ
And Joe Biden is  a lesbian so we all have to pay the price !
I commended the guy, but I literally started out on my first comment by saying Biden has issues and was unsure if he could do the job.  What more do you want?  Why is it so hard for people to be critical of their own parties‚Äô candidate when they have major flaws?
This is a very valid point in that Biden actually apologized , whether it was necessary or not. Biden has tons of issues himself, and I have doubts of his ability to do the job. but humility is important when you‚Äôre a leader. Trump has zero humility.
If Biden wins the left will go after EVERYONE who supported
I know all i need to know about you. You‚Äôve shown your incompetence very clearly. I‚Äôll be voting for Mr. Biden.
Peek a Boo! We know why you‚Äôre hidden Biden. ‚ÄúSleepy Joe, come out to plaaaaay!‚Äù

Bernie Sanders would be a FDR Democrat in 1936. Truman and LBJ (without Vietnam) were more progressive than Biden.
Just listening to Trump makes me wonder how any person following the news would lose a debate to him. All Biden needs to do is paraphrase himself: Every time Trump speaks, ‚Äúit‚Äôs a noun, a verb, and lie, lie, lie.‚Äù
Staying out of prison is Clinton. Sniffing children is Biden

I wonder if all the Dems who were ok with Trump‚Äôs campaign being spied on would be ok if he were to do the same to Biden.
Per the U.S. Constitution, he cannot delay the election! #DicatorTrump is trying to defer and distract the American people from his epic failure of a response to the pandemic with his deployment of federal paramilitary forces into Democratic run cities, and blame Biden and Obama.
Biden: love thy children

The electoral college numbers have to be absolutely solid in terms of Biden, it has to be an absolute rout.
I justified Obama's pick of Biden to fellow upset lefties by saying that picking a racist as running mate might quell the racists in the Dem party (of which there are still many). The fact that he is becoming an addled shell of himself might be a plus to the owners.
I don't care whatever any-something host on PSA has to say. Biden is a racist, corrupt, compulsive liar with dementia issues and a credible sexual assault charge... the  owners further pushing the overton window sharply to the right. A perfect tool.
Well, lot of us from the US east coast call Joe Biden "Uncle Joe" because we're pretty informal, but I've never heard anyone call Sanders that. Mix up?
Just to add to this list of ages, next Inauguration Day Kamala Harris will be 56 and Mike Pence will be 61.  As a reminder, J. Biden will be 78 and D. Trump will be 74.

If you do not collect payroll taxes, which is how social security is funded, you‚Äôre effectively killing social security. Biden did not lie. He understands math, which Trump obviously does not based on all the bankruptcies he‚Äôs been through.

Trump stopped travel to China at the  end of January and was promptly called a racist by Biden and the rest of the dems.
BTW, when Biden's brain stem fumbles, the Dem leadership will NOT turn to progressives - they are getting paid by their owners to crush progressives, for which they will be paid whether they win or lose. We are more likely to get a WORSE Trump - one that isn't a buffoon.
Trump is the symptom. Biden/Harris is part of the good cop/bad cop charade, funded by the SAME donors, that give the illusion of democracy, but is the vehicle for the owners of this country to screw the rest of us over. Nina Turner 2024.

None of these political gotchas matter. Do you think Harris calling Biden a racist and a rapist will matter? Not in the slightest.
Can only hope. But name recognition will siphon off some votes at the ballot. In 2016, there were 3 states that had only a 80k(?) Margin of winning in total. Thays a very small percentage. And west said he was doing this to hurt biden and help trump. Very unethical.

Joe Biden didn‚Äôt choose anyone. The Democratic Party chose her.
A vote for Biden in the primaries was a vote for Trump. It is getting harder for the Biden camp to hide his dementia, and trying to get Kamala Harris, the HRC camp's choice as the inter-regnum candidate is gross and won't work.
Many us feel free to vote for someone other than Trump or Biden.
Joe Biden decides Kamala Harris smells the most qualified. Then there is the fact that she likes to spend time on her knees to get what she wants from men. So overall, GOOD CHOICE FOR A TOKEN.

You and Joe Biden are cut from the same corrupt fabric. Frankly, it's insulting to me why any sane black person would vote for either of you.

It isn't, but it's also not a new problem.  Putting in all on the shoulders of Biden and Harris is emotionally appealing I guess but it lets far too many people off of the hook.  How many politicians have you voted for that have actually made a real impact on this?

How annoying. I‚Äôm not turning on my tv. It should have been Warren..and if she just found out today that she wasn‚Äôt the pick, she deserved way better. Biden should stop using Warren for fundraising now. I will get over this, but I‚Äôm pissed rn.
I raised my hand. I‚Äôm voting for Biden
Biden/Harris 2020.   OK. Let's get to work.
Guess what Pence in many ways Biden is correct.
Let‚Äôs put it this way, if the ticket had been Biden/Klobuchar or Biden/Whitmer (or gasp, Biden/Buttigieg) I would have recognized the justification in being upset. Harris is a safe pick who has the potential to be a good VP and maybe helps set the stage for the next phase
biden is a throw away candidate like  romney was in 2012..... the DNC is setting up  for 2024.. 2028...... # totalcontrol
I don‚Äôt mind Harris, and I understand why the campaign thinks it‚Äôs the right choice. Harris is youngish, she has a resume and she‚Äôs not dumb. It‚Äôs not a horrible ticket. It‚Äôs not the choice I would of made, but then again Biden was not my initial choice for top of ticket either

This is the worst possible choice Biden could have made for VP (right next to Stacy Abrams).Bad criminal justice record and bad policy positions.Can‚Äôt wait to see Harris acknowledge that she‚Äôs half- Indian for once in her political career at the DNC so she can score some points.
Way to go Joe! Biden/ Harris.
YES!!!! Biden/Harris 2020 #2020Election #BidenHarris2020
I would have preferred Warren. Strategically, Harris was the safest choice. The only people this will upset are on the left and they‚Äôve already decided whether they are voting for Biden or staying home.
As I said, I'll vote for Biden &amp; whoever. No need to snipe free thinkers or falsely elevate would be heroes. We're rooting for the same team, that shouldn't mean giving up individual opinions. My opinion wasn't veiled - Harris is ok (to me) &amp; still is.
Joe Biden could pick the superfecta at Churchill Downs, unless he says, "Rioting and looting are never acceptable and in a free society must be felt with swiftly and harshly.", he will lose, probably in spectacular fashion.
Pete Buttigieg. While I think he would be a fantastic choice, it is pretty clear, the DNC wants Biden to pick a women as his VP.

Mr Biden, my son &amp; daughter-in-law are working for minimal hours- less than pre- Covid, but had to go back &amp; have no assistance making up lost income! Unemployment supplement does not help them - so please remember this group as well !
I hope they don't change the LTCG tax rate but do you think there will be a dip in the market if Biden wins the election?
Joe Biden is cheering against the American people.

Stop calling each other names and blocking those you disagree with.  I was blocked because I had said Biden could not tell his sister and wife apart. I am not saying that because I am making fun of Biden. I said it because I think he has dementia.

Biden argued for intergration through federal and state action and was against integration through busing.   Byrd WAS kkk and denounce to become a strong advocate for civil rights.   We trust John, Barry, and Michelle to tell us about Biden. Not Trumpers
Let me give you a FACT. Bernie is far far left. A socialist.   Democrats are democrats.   Biden overwhelmingly got the MOST votes. Democrats picked  a centralist by A LOT!!!   Just numbers. Just fact. üíØ
Lol. Look at the mission of almost all far right groups.   A race war.   And it‚Äôs a narrative for folks who get their info from memes to use to gen up support for Trump. The narrative of ‚Äúlaw and order‚Äù. ‚ÄúI can fix it‚Äù ‚Äúblacks are coming for you‚Äù ‚ÄúBiden is hurting the suburbs‚Äù.

He is riding his bike without a helmet. I guess we are not really voting for Biden, but for his running mate. Whoever he/she is.
Oh guaranteed, not to mention he‚Äôs inheriting the worst clusterf**k ever. It‚Äôs going to be a huge undertaking. I know Biden is capable and up to the job, but he will be blamed for the morons inaction.
While they're at it, they might want to deny Biden a speaking slot at the convention.  Just to be on the safe side.

Biden is a horrible canidate. We ALL know that. Gaffe machine we call him.   But we know he would be a good leader. A ‚Äúboss man‚Äù. He will so-round himself with the right smart people. Listen to his experts.  And we know his heart. We know he‚Äôs ‚Äúmiddle class joe‚Äù.

AG James of NY, going after the NRA, is probably not great for Biden.
Imagine Biden being the one who let one of his families handle the pandemic plan and they both just let the virus spread, thinking that only red states would be the ones that get infected the most.   Now that sounds likes like a nazi to me.
Fundamentally it comes down to whether people think Trump (and his Supreme Court picks) is worse than Biden (and his picks).  Clearly some people think they're equally bad.  It's fine, we disagree, and I don't think our minds are going to be changed on that.
A lot of People know what Joe Biden means  but they purposely skew his comment to make it look monolithic or of malicious intent. I knew exactly what he meant when I watched the video and I think a lot of people do but we need to keep pushing the rhetoric that Joe is outta touch
Trump aides frustrated by his ‚Äònonsensical‚Äô Biden attacks in Ohio: AP reporter #SmartNews
I don't know, man.  I look at Biden as the GWB of the Dem Party.  Unexciting and gaffe-prone, but not sinister.  Not to mention, you kind of have to pick a lane between "look at all the bad things he says and means" vs. "he's senile and can't think straight".
I think Biden is actually more racist than Trump. Trump just says somewhat racist things because he thinks that‚Äôs what his base wants to hear.
It‚Äôs a gaffe because in the very statement he disses Biden, he uses the phrase ‚Äúthe black vote.‚Äù Which is doing  the very thing he is accusing Biden of.
A man that for decades refused to rent to Blacks &amp; created a corporate culture that made sure no one working for him would rent a Trump property to a Black person is? How are you, a person that had to be forced by the federal government to stop this practice, better then Biden?
Only Joe Biden has that power
Biden wants to do that? Biden? üò≥. Where are you getting your news from?
Wait!! Are you now realizing that racist ran this country?üò≥. The founding fathers ran this country. Most had slaves. It‚Äôs why we have BLM. And Biden supports it. Trump supports the worship of confederate monuments.
Ask Obama about Biden. He picked him as his VP. We trust Michelle and Barry over any confederate flag supporters.
Biden is so senile he probably forgot he is a Catholic.
I believe Joe Biden‚Äôs probable dementia will limit his capability to handle complex situations.
So...where‚Äôs Trump‚Äôs statement of faith then? Perhaps too written by his staff? Even if it was written by his staff (which I doubt), the fact that Biden CARES enough about his faith to actually have his staff write &amp; approve this document is proof of where his values lie.
Not Joe Biden. Joe would have said month not monolith. He had a hard time reading the note cards now.
Humble Obama. Gotta love him. Unlike what we have now. üòïAlways know that he has still more work to do. Like the inequality. Biden will build on his work.
Way to divert attention from Biden's  continued insults against the black community.
Biden isn't writing this people. His cognitive decline appears at a point that he may have trouble even comprehending the tweet. That he is the Dem nominee is an abomination and an indictment of a political system thoroughly corrupt and broken.
In any given debate, Joe Biden doesn‚Äôt have to say a word.  He just needs to stand there looking presidential while Trump opens his mouth, puts both feet in and confirms what an ignoramus he is!!
Things I learned during the 2020 election... - Biden is a worse candidate than Hillary - Trump is a worse candidate than Biden - A Biden vote is immoral - Trump wins if he follows Covid doctors  - It's the worst election ever. We lose no matter who wins.
Things the candidates for President should do to win... - Trump: Stop tweeting. Stop talking. Just stop. Put up pictures of the American flag. - Biden: Do nothing. Say nothing. Just stop. Put up pictures of you smiling.
Things all American citizens should do, regardless of party affiliation... - Call out Trump foolishness - Call out Biden for not campaigning openly - Refuse to let bias in the media determine political views - Demand an open and honest election
I actually pity poor Joe Biden.  He can't even pander to his misled sheeple right.
Media things that should happen... - Press Trump on Epstein link - Call out Biden for hiding his mental issues by avoiding live interviews - Cover late-night violent "protests" live - Admit that you are not doing your job and do better
By this point, if Joe Biden ate a baby, the media would praise his "VERY traditional low-cal paleo-diet." #just_the_facks_maam
Non-partisan point - politicians are way too old. I broke down the following ages for a piece today: Joe Biden (77), Nancy Pelosi (80), Mitch McConnell (78), Bernie Sanders (78), Donald Trump (spring chicken at 74). I'm just 37...and can't touch the rim anymore. What gives?
Is there a church near by for Trump to go to? If he thinks Biden is hurting God then he should offer his prayers to ‚Äòhelp‚Äô God.
This epitomizes the GOP in the era of Trump. Trump, speaking of Biden, "He's against God. He's against guns." Only now would those two sentences be conjoined in this way.
Every time Joe Biden opens his mouth, at least 1,000 new Trump voters are created.
The same people who were like "Dick Cheney is the real President" instead of W, are you just as concerned for who is going to run this country instead of Biden? It's clear he's not all there. It's worrisome.

He is not obvious with his intentions. That's just delusion right there. If you think he was ever honest about anything, you need to get your head out of his ass.   and no, I dont support Biden. I also think he is a racist puppet. but he isn't as damaging as Donald.
It was a dementia test! We only give those to patients that we suspect may have dementia. The vast majority of my patients never receive a test for dementia, because they show no signs of dementia-just like Joe Biden.
You would think the Christians who reject everything Jesus taught would understand how this works...  Just because Biden doesn't agree with the Vatican doesn't mean he's not Catholic. By that standard, most Catholics aren't "real" Catholic. If you believe that, just say that.

Biden is going to ‚Äòhurt God‚Äô, like the omnipotent ruler of creation? Is there a wrestling match I don‚Äôt know about?
I also assume that any politician that has been in the public eye has baggage. Part of Biden‚Äôs decision process is to determine which baggage is manageable and which is an automatic knockout (I‚Äôm looking at you Church of Scientology)

I'm talking about the DNC nomination. It was stolen from Bernie in 16. This election it was obvious that the chosen one was handed the nomination.  Seriously,  Biden? How the fuck did this happen? Yang or Gabbard were the top quality players. I would have taken them seriously.
Maybe the strategy is to make Trump look like a good leader, with that $400..?  But it seems crazy to me that Mitch wants to make that gamble, when Biden is so likely to be the benefactor of this new precedent. It's just... Dumb.
2/12 Birtherism 2.0 apparently began as an insidious suggestion circulating in the cesspool that is Facebook.   These were making the rounds before Biden's announcement, but moved from a dull roar to an angry rumble to a Trump train whistle afterwards.

Warren is Native American and Harris is African American. Joe Biden is a sexy woman. Donald Trump is my president.

I hope you find yourself in the Biden Cabinet.
Remember they project constantly.  Trump didn't pick Pence, Manafort did so of course they're going to say Biden didn't pick his own running mate. They'll try to turn it into he wasn't mentally capable of picking I bet.

Their dreams? Number one on their list of most important dreams is the compete and total landslide for Joe Biden and the DemocratIC party on November 3. Start packing, Pu$$ygrabber-in-Chief.
I saw a post that said they wished we were voting for the version of Biden that trump tweets about and I feel it applies to this too
What does this have to do with Biden ducking interviews and questions? Why Does the left always want to change the subject and not answer questions?
The electoral college numbers have to be absolutely solid in terms of Biden, it has to be an absolute rout.
Warning to Kamala Harris and Joe Biden:  Never eat a corn dog on the campaign trail. That photo will follow you on social media like a plague.
I justified Obama's pick of Biden to fellow upset lefties by saying that picking a racist as running mate might quell the racists in the Dem party (of which there are still many). The fact that he is becoming an addled shell of himself might be a plus to the owners.
I don't care whatever any-something host on PSA has to say. Biden is a racist, corrupt, compulsive liar with dementia issues and a credible sexual assault charge... the  owners further pushing the overton window sharply to the right. A perfect tool.
Well, lot of us from the US east coast call Joe Biden "Uncle Joe" because we're pretty informal, but I've never heard anyone call Sanders that. Mix up?

If you do not collect payroll taxes, which is how social security is funded, you‚Äôre effectively killing social security. Biden did not lie. He understands math, which Trump obviously does not based on all the bankruptcies he‚Äôs been through.
I actually feel bad, in a "salute an honorable enemy" sort of way, for genuine  progressives - who fiiiinnnnallly agreed to back Biden and were then sort of handed a crap sandwich. TWO amoral millionaires who used to be prosecutors? #ayup
To swing left for a second: is there any Biden VP pick that the right WOULDN'T have condemned as a "secret radical?" I've heard this about Colin Powell and Jeb Bush: isn't it just the default conservative-guy equivalent of SJWs crying "Racist?!"
Kamala Harris Lies Repeatedly in First Speech as Biden's Running Mate | National Review

BTW, when Biden's brain stem fumbles, the Dem leadership will NOT turn to progressives - they are getting paid by their owners to crush progressives, for which they will be paid whether they win or lose. We are more likely to get a WORSE Trump - one that isn't a buffoon.
Trump is the symptom. Biden/Harris is part of the good cop/bad cop charade, funded by the SAME donors, that give the illusion of democracy, but is the vehicle for the owners of this country to screw the rest of us over. Nina Turner 2024.

This is dictatorship:  "Trump says he‚Äôs blocking Postal Service funding because Democrats want to expand mail-in voting during pandemic"
I find it endearing that Biden calls his spouse Jilly &amp; Harris calls her spouse Dougy. Something about those affectionate gestures seems 2 show some sort of kindred spirit. I hope they continue 2 develop trust &amp; patience &amp; respect 4 each other within the crucible of the campaign.
Not investigating and prosecuting the actions of the Bush Administration over things like firing of US Attorneys or the torture program is Obama‚Äôs biggest mistakes. Biden should not replicate it.
‚ÄúBut well short of a constitutional crisis, the Trump administration can nevertheless hobble the incoming Biden team and endanger the nation with a scuttled transition process.‚Äù
I've made a ton of jokes, but - on the "real talk" front - a Biden/Harris ticket is clearly not wildly radical. Aren't they BOTH former prosecutors? The whole point of this team, plus Kasich/the Never Trumpers at the convention, is pulling in moderates. Does it work for you guys?
A family member said  was done because of the riots. I reminded him that those are left-wing lunatics, financially attached to the Biden campaign. We can‚Äôt reward their campaign of intimidation by voting for them.

Well she called Biden a rapist in one of the debates and now is happy to team up with him.  I'd say that qualifies as being a phony for sure
I‚Äôm guessing Joe Biden doesn‚Äôt care enough....
If I unfollowed you it's probably because I caught you supporting the Biden/Harris ticket. I'm not sorry.
Donald isn't excellent at anything except spouting whatever he thinks of on the spot. I'm pretty sure Biden goes to church way more than even Donald.  and No. Biden's remark as such is simply his inner racism coming out.
So you just admitted Biden can‚Äôt handle the job. We all know that. BTW Kamala is an evil person
I believe that Biden touches people in an inappropriate manner and I also believe he‚Äôs FAR less creepy than Trump and Pence.

Someone better tell Joe Biden! He already mispronounced it!
If Kamala Harris is strong... she would have turned down the Vice Presidency based on what she accused Biden of being. She‚Äôs nothing but a weak opportunist
Kamala Harris came out saying she believes and supports Joe Biden‚Äôs alleged rape victims...now she‚Äôs his running mate. This is American politics.
There‚Äôs plenty of other angles to go at Biden with and be successful. No need to even touch the racist or sexual abuse allegations.

Biden has been in politics for 51 years, including being a vice president. Do you really think he's gonna be able to do everything that his campaign has promised just because he's president this time?
vote for Biden
Biden has been hijacked by Harris &amp; the left. The left has no tolerance for critical thinking. The leftist media is also threatening to punish anyone that dares criticize Harris. Say what you will about Trump &amp; his supporters we want various views. Trump gets it from all quarters

There might be reasons that Biden shouldn‚Äôt debate Trump, but your analogies make no sense. Joe McCarthy and Robert Welch didn‚Äôt run for President....also I‚Äôm pretty sure the first Presidential debate was Kennedy/Nixon. The next was Ford/Carter in 1976
Yep pretty obvious. They can‚Äôt pull Biden before the nomination due to his senility. He has to make it to the election. Bernie will do his utmost to deliver his bro‚Äôs. It would be too obvious if pulled him before because Bernie (who DNC hates)would show how corrupt the process is
Can only hope. But name recognition will siphon off some votes at the ballot. In 2016, there were 3 states that had only a 80k(?) Margin of winning in total. Thays a very small percentage. And west said he was doing this to hurt biden and help trump. Very unethical.
Is the shaking of your glass the DTs or your fear of the Biden/Harris ticket?

Just an innocent response. We have seen Biden over 40 years &amp; witnessed his horrible record. He should have to answer questions about it. Either he can‚Äôt defend it or he can‚Äôt remember it. Either way he must debate. You know he can‚Äôt
Biden is under no moral obligation to debate someone with no compunction about lying.

Biden is a strong leader who is respectful of others opions and take them into consideration when making a decision. A good leader will surround themselves with others that can give good information on the other side another set of eyes that may not see things the way he does.

A vote for Biden in the primaries was a vote for Trump. It is getting harder for the Biden camp to hide his dementia, and trying to get Kamala Harris, the HRC camp's choice as the inter-regnum candidate is gross and won't work.
Many us feel free to vote for someone other than Trump or Biden.
If I lived in a competitive state, I'd hold my nose and vote Biden/Harris. Ugh. I can't imagine a more perfect way to continue Biden's policies when he's deemed unable to serve etc, while also virtue signaling as the Democratic party is wont to do.

Sorry Biden‚Äôs Presidential bid.
No surprise here for anyone who's watched his shift to the right. Biden chose Harris, so the former president of American Atheists says he'll consider four more years of Christian Right rule.
College football is cancelled so the whole issue of players taking a knee is not relevant. Biden answered that with his VP pick.
I guess I'm more concerned about what does she bring to the table. She doesn't court progressives. She doesn't court black people. She doesn't bring in purple states. Unknown what she actually brings that can make biden a stronger candidate other than optics
Where are you getting that info? I think Trump is a lot closer to Biden than the polls indicate, but I wouldn't guess that's from the black vote.
Biden goes to the same Catholic Church as my grandma in Delaware.

Biden would win California without her. What other state does she help him win.
It isn't, but it's also not a new problem.  Putting in all on the shoulders of Biden and Harris is emotionally appealing I guess but it lets far too many people off of the hook.  How many politicians have you voted for that have actually made a real impact on this?

I don‚Äôt mind Harris, and I understand why the campaign thinks it‚Äôs the right choice. Harris is youngish, she has a resume and she‚Äôs not dumb. It‚Äôs not a horrible ticket. It‚Äôs not the choice I would of made, but then again Biden was not my initial choice for top of ticket either

Biden all the way!!!
Trump is giving a political speech and denigrating Joe Biden...from the WH Press Briefing Room. Again.
Biden's jaunty bike ride quip was everything Trump's not: athletic, lucid, and funny
The fact we have to chose between Biden and Trump tells me how poor of a job these politicians have done. They‚Äôre supposed to be public servants but is not, we work to serve them.
I am ha[[y for her to still have a job. However this is an all out war we are fighting to get rid of trump. Once that is done we can try to get back to normal. Just hang in there, &amp; keep up the good work. Pray that our next president is Joe Biden.
Joe Biden situation is pretty sad
Let's get Biden‚Äôs words out there‚Ä¶
Vote for Biden. Democrat politics work so well in Portland and Chicago.
Supporting? They are organizing, funding &amp; promoting it. Biden is incapable of dealing with it. Let him keep riding his bike &amp; let adults with a functional brain deal with it.
Out of sheer curiosity, I looked up the cognitive test both Trump and Biden boasted about "passing." If it's a standard 'MCA' board measuring just cognitive FUNCTION, an actual question on the thing is: "What is THIS animal?"   Feel free to answer, btw.
Not sure how.  I'm sure this will kill my chances of becoming president, but Biden will be ok.
I think Biden should give his acceptance speech either at the Lincoln Memorial or either the WWII or Viet Nam memorials.
I follow politics pretty closely and don‚Äôt believe I have read or seen Biden people ‚Äúcrowing.‚Äù This is the second time today I have wondered about your comments.
No, she's right; all you need do is look at Biden's upward-trending polling numbers.
Make it a triple endorsement by Biden, Obama, and Hillary Clinton.  Just for good measure, Nancy Pelosi, Chuck Schumer, and Adam Schiff can all approve of it after release.
Except in cases of landslide (I'll call Hawaii for Biden today, but I can't say by how much).
Because Hillary Clinton was polling ahead of Trump, and narrowly lost the Electoral College anyway (thanks, James Comey). So if Biden's ahead of her, maybe he won't lose. I don't care about polling; I'm gunning for Nixon's #18M record margin. It is unlikely, but possible.
Mr Biden, my son &amp; daughter-in-law are working for minimal hours- less than pre- Covid, but had to go back &amp; have no assistance making up lost income! Unemployment supplement does not help them - so please remember this group as well !
I hope they don't change the LTCG tax rate but do you think there will be a dip in the market if Biden wins the election?
Nah  can‚Äôt wait to go vote for that hair sniffing kiddy toucher Joe Biden
Biden‚Äôs VP pick probably
Boating around St. Pete and Anna Maria Island FL a couple weeks ago saw a lot of Trump Flags, but not one Biden flag or sign
Sleepy Joe Biden?!? Try Dummy Donald Trump. That‚Äôs more like it!
Biden is actually on record trying to significantly reduce Social Security
Biden's already signed up for 3 debates. Trump hasn't. Trump gaslights. You're the mark.
Now that Kanye is admitting to being on the ballot to steal votes from Biden, I think it would be fair if GW Bush went on record saying Kanye West doesn't care about black people.
I would bet late this week for Biden's announcement, but who knows.
Joe Biden is a fake Catholic, fake leader, fake Democrat, real socialist, real thief, real crooked politician, real child abuser. Sorry, but that is truly what he is.
She's been treated unfairly. Personally attacked w/o evidence. Now you're getting another stab in. She endorsed Biden, getting a lot of gruff from her supporters for doing so. I agree with her on that choice too but keep it up &amp; more of her antiwar Dems might stay home etc.
It‚Äôs good to know Joe Biden isn‚Äôt the only one In the Democrat party that has completely lost all cognitive abilities
She endorsed Biden. I'd really love to talk to you about all of this. If someone is not being honest, and getting paid etc by someone w/ an overriding interest in manipulating public in some direction is a good reason to suspect them, that makes sense. But that's not happening.
Isn't that litterly the same thing that Trump fanatics do whenever Biden talks? lol
Stop calling each other names and blocking those you disagree with.  I was blocked because I had said Biden could not tell his sister and wife apart. I am not saying that because I am making fun of Biden. I said it because I think he has dementia.
November 3 will be a Biden landslide due to Trump's complete and utter incompetence.  He's nothing but a (New York) City slicker with penchant for bullsh¬°t. SDNY, do your absolute best to get the Trumps off the street.
That's largely been the program for corporatist Dems like Biden.
Hey Fox News why does  Biden have to pick a black I thought it was the best qualified Just to get the black vote That's what's wrong with this country today
You can always criticize her arguments or positions. If Biden goes on FoxNews and makes his typical campaign pitch, shouldn't that be encouraged?
6/ Employers (unlike Trump) are not dumb.  They see what's happening to the economy.  They can appreciate the pressures the next Congress is going to be under with a Biden administration to put science first and get the economy back on track.

Trump or Biden? These ETFs Should Climb Either Way.  via
At this rate if Joe Biden should win, he‚Äôd spend the major part of his first term just backrolling all of Trumps harmful policies and won‚Äôt even have the time to implement his own agenda.
The COVID-19 Election    Sure Biden would have managed COVID better. Starting with not having the travel ban from China.

Tweeter is far left. Tweeter don't care that Biden is a pedo. Example if you publish on your TL the video of Biden touching and sniffing little girls, Tweeter will suspend your account.
Will you go ridin with Biden or do the Trump walk of shame in November.
Yep I feel that way about Biden too
Could care less about Hillary Joe Biden‚Äôs or Trumps taxes the best part is that has nothing to do with the original point but since you have nothing to rest ur case with you deflect with muh Trumps taxes and hate to disappoint but none of those things are gonna happen #Loon
it's happening.... ukraine and biden ...
Biden can't tell his sister from his wife. What's your point?

Podcast Ep. 334: Joe Biden‚Äôs Doing What to God?!
Why are you telling people about China and Iran supporting Biden‚Äôs election?
Heard this on the radio in the car. Someone tuning in without any context up front would assume it's the WH press corps laughing at Biden
Who the F*** cares.  That has ZERO effect on someone being fit for president.  Neither Biden or Trump is fit to be president where it actually matters. There's only 1 candidate who can actually help the people  #LetHerSpeak #JoJorgensen2020
Joe Biden named as accused perpetrator in Ukraine court complaint, Biden pressure on President Petro Poroshenko to fire chief prosecutor Victor Shokin | Citizen WElls For everyone who thinks Joe Biden has integrity
If you truly want lower taxes and want the government to leave you alone, neither Biden or Trump is the answer.  There's only 1 clear option to help the people  #JoJorgenson2020 #LetHerSpeak #ShesWithUs #VoteGold
He is. It‚Äôs current &amp; ongoing. Also Biden is on tape bragging about withholding aid to from Ukraine unless they fire the prosecutor who was investigating corruption which included Bursima the firm Hunter Biden was a board member. Man are you gullible.
Oh guaranteed, not to mention he‚Äôs inheriting the worst clusterf**k ever. It‚Äôs going to be a huge undertaking. I know Biden is capable and up to the job, but he will be blamed for the morons inaction.
Who‚Äôs this Joe Biden you speak of
Jokes are mistimed for someone who has early onset dementia. Sad.   Biden quips to Fox News he decided on VP, campaign says it's a jokeYeah because Biden and Truth do.
Joe Biden winning a 4th grade spelling bee. Camel Hairs passing an STD screening.
So you think dem congress should be more reasonable to get something done, yet you won‚Äôt vote Biden who will most certainly do exactly what your asking?
And if Biden wins , Democrat‚Äôs will remove him within 90 days . Making Harris President and pelosi vp ! If this doesn‚Äôt scare you, nothing will !
is trying to defund the USPS because he can‚Äôt get any other country to help him steal this election,they all hate him now! ‚úåÔ∏èpray for peace! #WEGOTUSA #BIDEN/HARRIS 11/3/2020!
Meanwhile, close to home....I don't think voting for Biden is going to help this guy......
I hope the media don‚Äôt take the bait. Stay focus. Voters suppression USPO and COVID ohh and Biden/Harris 2020
Biden and Harris roll out was on EVERY network including Fox state run news. Trump followed up with a briefing that was only carried on Fox fake news.
Biden and Lincoln Project should make an ad with his words and run it on all the battleground states. Hellooooooo where is Mike Bloomberg???
Biden knows his days are numbered.  Probably wishes the election wasn't until 2021.  Hillary's help is never help.
Remember in 2016 when Hillary was winning the polls and was supposed to win the election?  And then the silent majority voted.  That was awesome!  Don't listen to fake polls.  I don't believe 51% feel Biden/Harris is a winning combination.   #Trump2020
ü§¨ It's getting harder and harder to resist the temptation to use an f-bomb in describing the unfathomable things Trump and his minions are doing.
Fox had Biden in double digits last month. Didn‚Äôt the 42% see the Swan and Wallace interviews. Wtf

I think she'll do more for Biden than just stand there like a mannequin gazing at him lustily, like some "man from glad" we all know.
With Kamala Harris being picked as Biden's VP yesterday, I decided to celebrate by mapping her 2016 US Senate win by California Assembly (Left) and Senate (Right) districts! Harris easily beat Congresswoman Loretta Sanchez, who only did good in heavily Hispanic areas and Anaheim.
Why are they playing #ados Curtis mayfield at this Biden Kamala speech??? A slap in the face.
83 daze to go until #WEGOTUSA! #Biden/Harris2020!
Kamala and Biden are awkward...
Biden is incoherent. He might be adjudicated and then Kamala will become President.
I totally agree! Oh, wait... This isn't a satire account. Shit, sorry. Hard pass on bumbling Biden and morally flexible Harris...
I would much rather complain to Biden/Harris about how we need Medicare for all or debt forgiveness than to Trump about putting up a border wall or banning people from muslim countries.
Russian or not what does that have to do with her calling Biden a racist on national tv? Answer: nothing, just a classic deflection tactic used by sensitive snowflakes
#WEGOTUSA #BIDEN/HARRIS 2020!
For someone who claims to ‚Äúnot be a Trump guy,‚Äù adopting Don‚Äôs childish moniker for Biden certainly says otherwise.
Before Kamala Harris became Biden's running mate, #ShirleyChisholm and other Black women aimed for the White House via
YOU MEAN HARRIS/ BIDEN!!!!!
Sen. Kamala Harris will regret being Biden's running mate, sooner or later she will find out.
Obama, Biden, Pelosi, Schumer and Covid-19
Believe it or not Trump has done more for this country than any other President. And you Libs think Biden can do the job when half the time he doesn‚Äôt know where he is.
Biden/Harris: Medicare for some, small american flags for others!
So, is it safe to say, you believe Joe Biden would have the same influence/success?
The matter of fact she will eat biden too if he got elected üòÇ
But the thing is, we already have given away are bargaining chip when Bernie got robbed. So now why not move on and work with what we have? Not voting in a state that actually matters (if that‚Äôs you, idk where you live) and getting Trump reelected is worse imo then Biden
I just believe that great change comes from the people not the president. Trump won‚Äôt budge on these issues but I think we can get the Biden administration to listen to us. That‚Äôs why i get upset when those on the left bash biden pre-election and play into the rights plan
I think that the Dems are under the most pressure rn then they have been in a while. They know if they get into office and don‚Äôt deliver that big cities and states will flip to the right. Get Biden in and fight for change. Wishing for the perfect candidate that‚Äôll never come 1/2
You know, you‚Äôre just pissing people off with this BS Harris hate-a-thon tweeting and making people even more enthusiastic to vote Biden/Harris. You‚Äôd think you‚Äôd be cleaver enough to figure that out. Oh wait! You‚Äôre a Republican, never mind.
Seeing that Kamala Harris is Biden‚Äôs runningmate is so sad I was really rooting for my girl Stacey :(
No problem with that. I just know that there‚Äôs many who aren‚Äôt fortunate enough to risk another 4 years of Trump. Some may disagree and say Biden is just as bad but that‚Äôs all opinion I guess
Kudos to Joe Biden for choosing Senator Kamala Harris for his running mate!!!
Literally fuck kamala biden already messin shit up
Bill, normally true, but given this election cycle and the untested  performance ability of Joe Biden, I‚Äôm not so sure.
#WEGOTUSA!Biden/Harris 2020! Trend it now!
I think its the complete opposite. It‚Äôs the privileged middle class that rather ‚Äúmake a point‚Äù and not vote for Biden thus playing into Trumps re-election chances which hurts poor communities way more. You may not understand unless you experience it. Also what about the SCOTUS?
That‚Äôs an oxymoron... You want a POTUS that‚Äôs smarter than a 5th grader, but are dying to vote for Biden? Sheesh. Educate yourself.
Paying attention to my feelings (that have not typically been representative), I‚Äôm excited to campaign for Biden/Harris when my attitude about Biden was ‚Äúok I guess‚Äù
i think that undervalues the weight peoples thoughts hold. Trump is in people‚Äôs heads 24/7 and people are angrier than ever. If biden is a bandaid i rather have a bandaid then nothing. It‚Äôs always up to the people to bring about change anyways.
But that‚Äôs how it is right now that‚Äôs the thing. We play with the cards we get. It‚Äôs obviously a strong difference of opinion but I just rather have Biden/Harris over Trump for the next 4 years.
Because one republican is worse (imo) than the other. I just think getting them into office first and then coming together to push for what we want is smarter than campaigning against Biden when it‚Äôs obviously either him or Trump
As someone who is left-leaning. I think the smart thing to do is get them in office and then come together and push to get what we want. I think promoting anti-biden/harris ideals before the election is dangerous since so many are already looking for any reason not to vote biden
" is the best person to help me take this fight to Donald Trump and Mike Pence and then to lead this nation starting in January 2021,‚Äù Harris, who is 55, is a graduate of  and a member of Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority  via

Biden selects California Sen.  Harris as running mate  via
"Joe Biden selects Senator Kamala Harris to be his vice presidential running mate"
Agreed, and honestly i don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs many of them that were actually not going to vote for Biden. Harris does attract the moderates though who are truly on the fence.
Whooweee now I really REALLY hope Biden doesn‚Äôt win. I mean I don‚Äôt think he will, but I think Kamala Harris is awful.
Biden/Harris 2020! DUMPTRUMP 11/3/2020!
MSNBC, your canadate is Joe Biden, and you‚Äôre going to attack Trump on one miss statement !!  üòÇüòÇüòÇ a fair and inpartial journalist would point out dementia Joe‚Äôs miss quotes but that doesn‚Äôt fit the MSNBC/CNN/ABC/CBS/NBC/ect...narrative
Joe Biden can't remember a speech that is literally in his face, but you expect him to remember you if by some miracle he wins and the dems don't throw him out in 6 months? You have to be more delusional than Joe himself. Please come out of the basement Joe we need entertainment.
The more U pick on Biden the more Dem's will love him!  How about something meaningful? The South China Sea?  Kim?  Iran?  Sending the American People a paycheck?  Put food in R stomach, pay some bills, or do something other than pick on poor Joe!
I hope Biden name his whole cabinet. That would be a fun convention. We would dance to the ballot box Nov 3 üòÉ

NE-01 is one I've had my eye on for a while, I definitely don't think it's this close, but if Biden can hit Obama 08 numbers here (R+10), then he's doing real good.
Just to show how much politics can change in 24 years, a Biden win map this year will look almost nothing like this. Yeah he'll win the Native American areas and the Tucson area, but he'll have to win Maricopa in order to flip the state.
Didn‚Äôt the IG‚Äôs from multiple agencies investigate this at nauseam already? Sounds like a Benghazi witch hunt looking to turn up some dirt on Biden. Like a certain SOS‚Äôs emails?
He hasn't struggled to contain the virus.  Struggle means to persevere against the odds not to roll up in his pathetic cocoon and blame everyone and everything else including China,WHO, Antifa, Dems and Biden.
Anybody got footage of the Biden boat parade?
Sorry but  has had too much kool-aid.  As Biden says,  C'mon man!  Do you even believe your own words?
We need GOV Andrew Cuomo at the top of our ticket. He would put Trump in his place. Biden needs to get outgage. They are stealing the election.
Biden says Trump executive order is 'a reckless war on Social Security'
While Biden sleeps, deals with the Democrats would lead to an economic contraction in the United States of America.
Trump said Biden ‚Äòhurt God.‚Äô Biden has spent his life drawing from his Catholic faith.
I‚Äôm voting for him because I want Trump our of office. Biden is not an ideal candidate, but I look forward to the country‚Äôs leadership to go back to normal. He‚Äôs going to be a boring but competent president.
At this point I don't think it matters who Biden picks as his VP running mate.  They all have dirt that Trump is eager to dust!
We can‚Äôt keep taking from the land without giving something back. Big mining companies just want to take, them leave the devastation for future generations to worry about. Biden is right. Find other good ways for people to make a living.
Of course they are! Who didn‚Äôt think they weren‚Äôt.
Thank you.
You can see the racism behind Joe Biden with ‚ÄúYou ain‚Äôt black‚Äù and ‚ÄúAll black are the same‚Äù statements. Meanwhile Trump is praying with Black politicians in the Oval Office.

I wonder who controls Biden's Tweets... They're far too coherent to be of his own doing. And to think, if he wasn't such a socialist and racial extremist, he may have been able to further lead the blind. Sorry Joe, the American people are AWAKE! #SayNoToJoe #TrumpPence2020
and screaming about Biden wanting to hurt the Bible and God.  Ridiculous.
That‚Äôs stupid. Biden and an iguana would work for me.
Donald Trump should not hold his breath waiting for African American voters to swing over to his side.  A recent NBC News/Wall Street Journal Poll showed that Joe Biden has 80% of the African American vote to Donald Trump's 6%.
To anyone that truly thinks Joe Biden is a racist you are an idiot. His comments were misguided and perhaps misspoken. No man cares more about the minority population of this country than Joe Biden. I think we should give him a pass on this one.
GOP will cheat in any way, now they‚Äôre using a mentally ill Kanye West? Why aren‚Äôt the Kardashians protecting him? This is absolutely nuts.
Donald Trump is a desperate, cowardly man. Claiming that Joe Biden would "hurt God" if elected is yet another incendiary statement by Trump. If anyone fits the modern-day definition of Tartuffe, it's Donald Trump.
If we‚Äôre gonna be honest both trump and Biden are currently headed for the lake of fire.
There‚Äôs no room in Biden‚Äôs mouth for a another toe nail ( COME ON MAN !)
A Biden presidency?

It doesn‚Äôt matter Biden is going to lose, BIG!
Biden raises eyebrows with remark contrasting African American, Latino diversity  #FoxNewsSo me being a white male with no college degree for whom Biden is far too much a race-baiting conservative puts me in the remains 2 percent?
I'm pretty grossed about by rich liberal democrats praising Kamala and Biden.   So insanely out of touch holy hell.
Is this surprising at all? Police are trained and become masters of sniffing out bs. Everyone knows Biden is full of it...even if they do vote for him.
Just the city of Fort Wayne? I definitely think so. Obama won Fort Wayne in 2008, Romney narrowly won it in 2012, and Trump carried it 51%-44%-5% in 2016. I definitely think Biden could be poised to make big gains in Fort Wayne, and possibly Allen County overall.

We‚Äôre on the side of the workers and of democracy.  #SaveUSPS
I think you would be hard pressed to find a vulnerable group who would not be harmed more by a second Trump term than by a Biden term. That's who I'm voting to protect. I'll be relatively fine regardless of who's president. Other people are not as lucky.
And yeah, Biden's going to be very disappointing on many issues. I will be right there with you criticizing him. But even small steps towards progressive policy are still steps we should take when we can.
I'm really sorry that happened and the state party definitely needs to clean house.  I'm still voting Biden over Trump tho.   Right now in 2020 it's a binary choice.

Are Biden or Harris thrice divorced adulterers? Are they the ones going around paying for sex or sexually abusing people? Are they the ones that can't recite a Bible phrase? There's no "winning" these so called evangelicals who are already voting for Trump. Fool's errand.
WEIGH IN: Do you think a nationwide mask mandate should be issued?
Oh jeez man. Her dad's Jamaican. Shes obviously black. You see what I mean? Who gives a shit? Why are arguing over how black she is?   Trump called for a complete ban on Muslims. But Biden is the racist since Kamala isnt black enough?
Not true. He terminated it on September 5th 2017.     But tell me more how BIDEN is the racist. Thats good stuff.
Trump Encourages Racist Conspiracy Theory on Kamala Harris
Trump said he didnt want people from shithole African countries. Trump said all people from Haiti have AIDS. Trump said a judge should recuse himself since he was Mexican.   Tell me more about what Biden said. Im really interested in hearing how BIDEN is the racist.
Again, a whole new level of STUPID. You want me to believe that Biden is somehow a closet KKK racist despite serving under Obama, choosing Harris, speaking out against police brutality against black men etc etc.  But tell me more about Byrd. Its so interesting.
See what I mean? So Byrd was a KKK member, quit, spoke out against KKK the rest of his life.  Biden was friends with Byrd. Biden serves as VP to a black president. Biden chooses a black woman as HIS VP.   And you want me to believe WHAT now?
My clear hatred for Trump? I think the level of stupid is horrible for our country. Voting by mail (which weve been doing for decades) is now bad! Kamala isnt eligible! Obama and Biden spied on me! Uranium one! Hunter Biden! Seth Rich!  And it just keeps going and going..
LOL. Obama told Trump, to his face, dont hire Flynn.  Again, a whole new level of stupid. If Obama or Biden committed a crime, by all means "lock them up". Nothing happens because they didnt do anything.  Now Stone, Gates, Papadopolis, Flynn, Manafort, Cohen...
LOL. Dont make excuses for his bullshit. He wants people to believe absurdities. Kamala's not eligible. Vote by mail is fraudulent. Except in Florida.   And youre comparing this crap to anything Biden or Harris has said? Thats just today, man.
So 33 years ago, Biden said he was in top half of his law school (records indicate he was in bottom half).  Ok. How many things will Trump will make up, on the spot, during his press conference? Whats the over/under? 10?
Because I know Obama/Biden would only implement a travel ban if there was a legitimate security risk. Im not so stupid as to forget this:
Republicans for Joe Biden???   ü§£ü§£ü§£What an oxymoron! If you support Joe Biden? YOU ARE NO GODDAMN REPUBLICAN!
Not 5 minutes into Trump's press conference &amp; he started projecting his failures onto Biden Biden hasn't held a position in office since 2017üôÑ
It you follow me you know I‚Äôm not someone who cheered on Biden or Harris in primaries   But they are now the obvious choice in November   My hope is that Democrats see the rise of actual left wing candidates in their party and realize that the old party line Dems need to change
We know Biden‚Äôs history   We also see a different Trump tweet every day that pushes racist ideology   Does that matter?
No one doubts that Biden has made problematic statements and policies- the funny thing is the new line of attack is that he‚Äôs listening to outside perspectives within his party.   And as a Trump supporter are you really going to pretend incendiary racial commentary bothers you?

I‚Äôm not getting a change unless the Democratic Party changes, and the only way that will change is by pushing them to the left.  If they lose maybe they will finally realize not to take my vote for granted.  Biden isn‚Äôt late in life going to be become FDR.
If Biden wins, he should seriously consider hiring an interpreter.  Think Luther from  but for a senile, boring old white dude.
A great interview by  with Jonathan Weinzapfel, the Dem nominee for Indiana Attorney General. A lot of people have been sleeping on this race, but if Biden can get into the mid-40s in Indiana (which I think is very possible), Dems can absolutely flip the AG's office.
Just for clarification, can you please tell me those teachings about murder and abortion from Vatican? Do really Mr. Biden endorse they? You can claim he is the best option but don't elevate him to holiness.

Kamala Harris sucks, Joe Biden sucks...both are INFINITELY better than what we currently have.  Until we get ranked choice voting voting for a 3rd party is basically worthless and that also sucks.  US voting sucks. The end.
Why former Republicans back Biden over Trump ‚Äî¬†and attack Senate Republicans  If this is to be an argument about ideology and party fealty, none of these endangered senators can any longer legitimately claim the label of Republican or conservative.
Seems like conservatives who were ‚Äúoutraged‚Äù about Biden‚Äôs You ain‚Äôt Black gaffe are investing a lot of time telling people Kamala isn‚Äôt black ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Have you been living in a hole? DNC is not going to allow Biden to debate Trump. He can‚Äôt even read a teleprompter.
If the suburban housewife is truly smart she will want her social security rights protected in case the suburban husband dies or leaves her. Vote Biden/Harris.
It seems like she has more support than you do and I‚Äôm sure she would have handled this pandemic much better than the current Vice President.  So lets not get ahead of yourself about who is more popular.  Biden / Harris 2020 has a winning sound to it...
Trump perceives his presidential crown in terms of commercial value. Harris &amp; Biden are both spiritual in nature. Their spiritual crowns, channeling God's Light to inspire electorate to reach for life, liberty, happiness. Similar to Keter (crown) from Tree of Life
Not while this admin is in office and especially not one from Russia. Vote Biden/Harris.
Such one to talk about people lying. Vote Biden/Harris!
My whole family is voting for Biden and Harris
I‚Äôm very nervous about warren leaving the senate, and really any democratic senators taking cabinet positions. More potential for republicans to win more seats and derail anything the Biden admin would want to do.
She did not call Joe Biden a racist I remember the debates well I swear the GOP will say anything What's next?
Biden-Harris. Lifting us higher and higher!
Harris is Trump's Nasty The Biden/Harris team will lift us higher and higher.
Biden-Harris. Lifting us higher and higher!
The Biden/Harris team will lift us higher and higher
Biden Harris 2020 Lifting us Higher and Higher
BIDEN HARRIS 2020 Lifting us Higher and Higher
Y‚Äôall still voting for Biden ? üëÄ
President Trump said he was ‚Äúa little surprised‚Äù that Joe Biden selected Kamala Harris as his running mate.
That's a faked picture of Senator Harris Besides Biden owns guns and was a hunter But the NRA needs to be dismantled We need gun control I never want to hear of another mass shooting again
Guilt and shaming people to vote for Hillary Clinton worked so well , I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs going to work again.  Seriously, if people didn‚Äôt vote for Hillary, and won‚Äôt for Biden/Harris for the same reason, maybe the party should try to appeal to those people instead.
Like seriously, though. Who else was it going to be? Who did people actually think Biden was going to pick?
So the D ticket is Biden-Harris. Interesting.  Welp. That makes now seven straight elections Party Blue has lost - or never had - my vote. Let me know when they nominate Jim Webb and Dan Lipinski.  #SmashTheDuopoly
Biden Harris 2020... The Joe/Blow Ticket.
Does that mean she isn't voting for Biden then? ü§£ü§£üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏
Yes, joe Biden is currently locked in his basement. I‚Äôm standing in solidarity with him
The News‚Ñ¢Ô∏è: ‚ÄúBiden picks Kamala Harris as his running mate!‚Äù  Pence, realizing he has to debate one of the fiercest prosecutors in American history:
The Democratic Party fights harder against progressive than Republicans, and if Biden wins the whole party is going to be so focused on keeping any Republicans that are never Trump than ‚ÄúDemocratic‚Äù policies.
Was already bummed about voting for Biden, but now I have to vote for kamala too?...fuck this whole year
Question on a point of order...  Why the hell he care WHO Biden picks for a crawling mate?! In the immortal words of Hillary Rodham Clinton of blessedly failed campaigning... if he's so convinced he's gonna win, WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE?!
My main take away from this picture is that Joe Biden and I have the same computer.
IDK Hunter. I'm sure they're some on the left who may not be thrilled, but for the most part are supportive. I consider myself a leftist person, and I support this decision. Did I prefer Warren? Of course, but I'll take Biden/Harris over Trump/Pence in a heartbeat.
I know I almost cried when I read that Biden had picked Senator Harris It's a good day
Biden picks Kamala Harris as running mate, adding former 2020 rival to ticket  via
Gonna keep it üíØ a fully senile Joe Biden could have picked a literal dead cat as his running mate and I'm still pulling up to polls in November like:
Wow I gave it an hour before you attacked Senator Harris I'd bet you almost dropped to the floor when you heard Biden had picked her She's far more intelligent than you or Pence and younger Get ready to pack your bags You are finished in the White House
#LetHerSpeak for FUCKS SAKE. We have someone running who actually wants to fix this bullshit and we're being told we have to vote for "tough-on-crime" Biden with his VP who likes to laugh about locking up black mothers for truancy.   FUCK these guys. #VoteGold
She‚Äôs a non white candidate who can‚Äôt be painted as a radical. She‚Äôs safe for the establishment voter which is what Biden is hunting for
In Historic Pick, Joe Biden Taps Kamala Harris To Be His Running Mate
So just so we get this right   Trumps attack on Harris is that she‚Äôs willing to call out Biden and is an establishment candidate willing to hear outside perspectives?   Only in MAGA world is this a negative
Biden very insensitive to pick Kamala Harris the day after he died...

Duckworth might be the best of the ‚Äúa Democrat, but also appeals to conservatives‚Äù bunch. And that‚Äôs who Biden/the DNC are trying to attract.
Well that settles it. I won‚Äôt vote for Hunter Biden now.
I admire your optimism. But I just don‚Äôt think it‚Äôll turn around that quickly. Even if (hopefully WHEN) Biden wins, the GOP will fight him every step of the way even if he‚Äôs trying to save lives.
Discussing when to start politicizing investigations and how to relate them to Biden and his VP nominee
Perhaps Biden can initiate legislation after he comes into office...  VT Day. Victory over Trump
Okay look, do I hate Donald Trump? Yes. But do I hate Joe Biden? Also yes.

BREAKING: joe Biden announces VP pick as all the friends we made along the way
The Merchant of Trump; the Mercy of Biden. Trump is so consumed by the trappings of power, he is blocking the surge of Liberty within us. He enervates Americans to enhance his own riches. Biden's radiance lifts us higher; Trumps exploitation only weights us down.

Short timer: Half of Democrats don‚Äôt think Biden will serve all four years
Ha! Okay! Tell me about Biden and his socialism.
Not afraid of anything just funny that people who always let trump off on his statements are so concerned with Biden‚Äôs. No intellectual honesty. Killing Trump in debate will be fun to watch.
WEIGH IN: Who do you think Biden should choose as his running mate?
Urging?  You gonna give them a stern talking to as well? Don‚Äôt forget to ground them too! This is the first time I have been disappointed in your reaction to a crisis. I am high risk. I guess I will have to take a chance and vote in person for Biden now.
I believe that Mr Biden will not announce his pick for VP until shortly before the Democratic convention She is going to horribly attacked by Trump and the GOP She will have to be tough as nails I know that Senator Harris will be good but you know Trump
Oh I would definitely like to have conversation with Joe Biden.
You didn't watch Fox when Biden was riding a bike? Yea sure I'd bet your father was fuming when he found out
Biden needs to announce today so I can binge watch cable news coverage of it during quarantine
I am an entrepreneur and understand fully well the risk involved with being in business for myself. The fact that you are demonizing Obama and Biden tells me that you have allowed yourself to become ensnared in their propaganda. Open your heart, &amp; feel the pain in others
Courage, Conviction, And Commitment, All Part Of Leadership, But Biden‚Äôs Amorphous Political Positions Suggest He‚Äôs Never Really Stood For Anything
Isn‚Äôt it strange Title VII of the The Civil Rights Act of 1964 outlawed discrimination based on race and sex, yet Biden is choosing his VP based on what criteria? So can ALL employers now hire based on #raceinamerica?
Trump is heckled for supposed pandering to his base...but If it isn‚Äôt obvious at this point that Biden is pandering to literally 5% of black Americans with this tweet, then you need a gut check.

Something I‚Äôd like to see Biden do is to make a statement that he promises to only serve one term and to invite republicans to support him this one time to save the country then in four years have an election with a good democrat and a good republican.
The False Equivalence Games  Expect to see equal time for purportedly "negative" stories about both candidates ‚Äî which will mean trying to rake up muck &amp; innuendo about Biden to counterbalance truly despicable yet factually accurate conduct by Trump
One year ago, I gave Jill Biden some Biden 2020 Make America Kosher Again Kippahs, at the Detroit Debates.

Yeah, I tossed some opinions out there in a Joe Biden thread. I talked about the response we had in 2009 to swine flu - which originated in the United States.   I talked about the difference between the prior administration's H1N1 response the Trump's administration with CV19.
Probably. He's already caused a rift in the left. There are people who are actually considering voting for him over Biden.
No because at his worse Biden is a much better person than Trump will ever be
A yes, let‚Äôs throw out the classic Biden gaffes when discussing Jorgenson. Nice pivoting
Whoever he picks will work for me Biden could pick a sponge with toothpicks for eyes and I'd still vote for him However all of these women are wonderful and I will support him completely
Joe Biden's campaign song.... Tomorrow.
Just as the enlightenment era came after the dark ages, Biden shall help the sun to come up tomorrow.

Regardless of how you feel about her policies, we're never going to break away from the 2-party duopoly crisis until we allow third party candidates to participate in the election.  The fact that we got tough-on-drugs Biden as the pro-BLM candidate is why we need to #LetHerSpeak.
With all due respect, Joe Biden is one of the politicians responsible for the war on drugs &amp; mass incarceration. He has the illusion of being progressive, but this country needs real legitimate change and Jo Jorgensen is the only candidate who wants to free nonviolent prisoners.
And that should be enough to make you NOT vote for Biden!!
biden#racism I think that joe is only considering black women for his vp is extremely racist.
Biden risks alienating young Black voters after race remarks

Well, Biden isn't currently in office, so "gotten done" isn't something we can talk about with him.  But yeah the so-called president is golfing this weekend. Maybe the Libertarians will replace the Republican Party some have shown they have principles.
Pulling apart USPS to hobble mail in voting   Russians and Ukrainians working together  with Trump subordinates to attack Biden  Voter suppression   Blocking attempts to secure our elections   Trump and the  are destroying our Republic in broad daylight
Objectively speaking, both mainstream candidates are appalling, hence why 3rd party candidates are necessary in accordance with a democracy. However, the idea that Jorgenson is somehow siphoning votes away from Biden is ludicrous
As she should. Biden‚Äôs a terrible human being, while Jorgenson is a super candidate!
I'll be curious to see how ***the justices*** try to square it.  And I can't wait for the three debates with Biden.  They're going to be a laff riot.

What failure in the Obama/Biden WH? They led with dignity and class. Economy was turned around after the worse recession not prompted by a global pandemic, but greed. If politicians had the American ppl on their minds, we‚Äôd have health care that makes sense. The man n WH b/c of u

I do.  I don‚Äôt want any doubters at this time. Trump has got to go. If Biden/Harris do not do what the American people can respect, they can go too in 2024. Democracy is at stake with that guy in the WH!

Joe Biden named California Sen. Kamala Harris as his running mate on Tuesday.
The left has called every Republican from Ronald Reagan to Bush 41,43, McCain, and Romney, who was laughed at for calling Russia our geopolitical foe in 2012, a fascist. According to recent intelligence Russia wants Trump but China and Iran want Biden. Where are you from?
Trump picked a racist white dude who was a failed governor as VP. Biden picked an accomplished woman of color. I think we know who cares about America.

Idk how I'm going to vote. All choices are super terrible in regards to decency (Trump) and policy/philosophy (Biden/Harris). That's not to say I don't have disagreements with Trump but I have more disagreements with Biden/Harris. I'd be on board had it been Klobuchar
I honestly can't vote for Biden/Harris. Tbh I'm not a fan of Trump either. I don't like his conduct, his hardline stance on immigration or his overall more protectionist leanings. I'm more with Reagan/Romney/McCain on policy &amp; philosophy. Idk what to do this election.
And yet I still can't vote for Biden/Harris. I had an emotional reaction after the announcment to vote for Trump but idk. The only good GOPer on my ballot that i have more in common on policy is my great governor of Indiana  and I'll happily vote for him.
Kamala doesn‚Äôt have the trust of the black community. They crucified her during the debates for her actions as AG of California from 2011-17 and DA 2004-2011. She was a sharp enemy of Biden then and threw lots of low blows...now they‚Äôre partners? Doesn‚Äôt look good.
still cant believe out of 27 candidates we even got Joe Biden
the Internet moves extremely fast. pictured: Joe Biden and sgt. Kamala Harris arresting young activist Bernie Sanders for peacefully protesting (1964)
And she on the reecord calling Biden is a racist and a rapist. Should be fun watching her reinvent that narrative.
Sorry, I don't like Trump or his more nationalist &amp; protectionist policies but it doesn't mean I can just turn my back on conservative policy positions I've had since before him and enthusiastically endorse the far-left Biden/Harris ticket.
It's one thing to oppose Trump for his demeanor and say you'll vote Biden just to get rid of Trump but they are enthusiastically supporting policy positions opposed by the GOP even before Trump. That says something about the "principled" folks.
#KamalaHarris2020 is this country next POTUS first woman and she doesn't need to run she just going to slide into the positions because Biden not going to finish his term #TheFive
I honestly can't tell if Biden's campaign is like really dense on purpose rn
I wasn't going to vote in this election. I didn't like the choices of Trump or Biden, however, with the thought of far-left Kamala Harris a heartbeat away from the presidency I'll hold back my vomit and vote for Trump.
Trump vs Biden Pence vs Harris  I'm looking forward to the debates.
For the record a brown paper bag is better than Mike Pence as VP. Love Harris as Biden‚Äôs running mate! #KamalaHarrisForVP #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica #VoteBiden2020

No, but Jr. might run or DeSantis or Pompeo. So yes, more Trump. That's why Biden's VP pick is so important. She needs to be able to beat one of the above right-wing nuts.

Why don't  make Jill Biden his wife his vice president since she knows everything about him, then they truly would be a real first family. #FoxandFriends
Its true and its an historical accomplishment. Criticize our "system" all you like, make alterations if you can track the results but by no mean "fundamentally change" it. That's madness and that's what Biden says he wants to do.
So you're basically a hypocrite. Chastising people for wanting to vote for Biden because they hate Trump, but you're voting for Trump because of some BS lies about Biden. Makes perfect sense. What rock have you been under with all the racist shit Trump has said/done?
What keeps me up at night is wondering if our votes will count if Russia changes them. Or that mailed ballots get lost. That people will believe the fake dirt on Biden they'll kick up. That they'll actually arrest Biden. I wonder what we can do to stop it.
I‚Äôm pissed and offended at the Republican Party for thinking that we would vote for crazy ass Kayne instead of Biden in the first place...we were done with Kayne years ago
Oh God! He‚Äôs attacking Dems, Biden, mail in voting...they‚Äôre trying to steal the election.  You‚Äôre getting interference from Russia again, you slowed the mail, so, who‚Äôs stealing the election?  Babbling sack of shit.
You. Are. Lying. But guess what? I do not care what kind of fabricated bs Bill Barr or your committee releases on Biden before the election. I will vote for him anyway and declare that if Trump can do it, so can Biden. FATWO
Biden‚Äôs been the nominee for months, you can‚Äôt equate Obama and Clinton picking since they had actual competitive primaries.......
It‚Äôs not true that Joe Biden is a predator? Are you okay? ü•¥
Trump has the vote fix in on the US side by sabotaging the USPS and Russia has the fix in with hacked voting machines and fabricated dirt on Biden. This is all I think about along with COVID.
Don‚Äôt let Ye trying to take votes from Biden distract y‚Äôall from the fact that Rick Ross had a masseuse, and 2 Chainz brought ‚ÄúEssential Workers‚Äù to their Verzuz #iykyk
Legionnaires' disease is not being misdiagnosed as COVID-19, and a missile wasn't responsible for the massive explosion in Beirut. Here are the facts.
From attacking Biden saying he wants to ‚Äúhurt God‚Äù then question Joe‚Äôs faith, to constantly attacking Democrats.  Donald has been an evil, lying, hateful, unintelligent, arrogant waste of space for decades and he‚Äôs escalating so he won‚Äôt go to jail.
Your giving Biden too much credit here sir.
How can he get away with this? Its always the same. Biden does not the the Black community can think.. So when does the R word come into play? He does not respIct. (Al) the back people.
lock her up. Covering up for Biden and dumping
so Trumps the racist huh? Maybe you should be calling Biden a racist, like he is. But of course you won‚Äôt, cause you‚Äôre the fakest news ever.
Fake News! The only game you got is lying. None of that is Biden‚Äôs stance. Some day try telling the truth it will have positive effects!
Biden is doing his own damage
But you're going to vote for Joe Biden? Your logic is pointless ü§£He‚Äôs doing what he‚Äôs supposed to do based on how his state voted. Also, this is how Bernie supporters get to tell the party to keep evolving the platform. Democracy works when our voices are heard. He still needs to earn our votes.
Just imagining the Biden/Harris administration with a Democrat controlled House and Senate and all the things they won‚Äôt get done for 2 years til they lose both chambers again
Vote for Biden! This Country depends on you! BTW WELCOME‚ù§Ô∏è
are you aware Krystal Ball Rising on fb has become a vote blue no matter what - Biden site?
So because I'm a Christian that makes me an automatic Trump supporter?    Now, what if I supported Biden? Would that make me a supporter of a pedophile? I'm trying to understand your logic here.   By the way. I'm not Catholic. That priest thing is irrelevant to me.
Biden's team will make Harris better than what she is imo.
Hush money, that's interesting, apparently you haven't looked into the Ukraine curruption for Biden. Fear not Trump will remind you
No I am voting for Biden no matter what. I dont peddle in conspiracy theories. And thats all you have.
Question is why aren't they following Biden?
Biden and his crew dissing Hillary after she lost was a clue to how he felt.
A vote for Biden isn‚Äôt just a vote for him. It‚Äôs a vote for the rest of the administration and ppl who hold high rank in varies offices. We CANNOT afford to have another four years of folks who are on the far right in those seats. Remember, it‚Äôs more then Biden.
In the end it's on Joe Biden to beat Donald Trump.   He was nominated to win back Wisconsin Michigan and Pennsylvania at the minimum.... that means white voters.  Harris is an insurance policy with Brown voters. If she can boost black and Asian voter intensity, great.
Huh? He Said libtards mad because Trump stopped them from locking up Black Americans.... Which is true. Trump's First step act went against Biden's 94 crime bill to lock up non violent drug criminals.
Thank you president Biden
The federal mask mandate suggested in Biden‚Äôs BS is just another symptom of his blatantly apparent dementia. His handlers really got this wrong. #MAGA2020
Checked my wife's registration and she was ok. So neither one of us voted since we cancelled we others vote. The idea is to trim the vote so Biden does not gain a vote.
Biden is a southern dem.... and folks underestimated him... I'll be the first to admit I did.  Locking SC down defending the ACA is why he's nominee.   Black older voters liked the loyalty to Obama.
They don't have that power. You're giving them too much credit. Their main play this week is Birtherism against a woman from Oakland when they had better things to hit Biden/Harris with.
I think that Biden is a flawed candidate but that Trump is an amoral, sociopathic narcissist whose Administration is anti-life and white supremacist, if not in explicit creed then in implemented policies.
had to admit, the Liberals owners of   dictates what they talk about.  And  is feeding suggestions to Harf to bolster Joe Biden  mask mandate. Weird, she told Trump he couldn't mandate states to do anything. What changed Dana?
Stephen Colbert compares political ideology of Biden, Harris to 'Rockefeller Republicans'    Colbert you don‚Äôt know üí© from shinola!
If it wasn't for Floyd I think Klobuchar is VP.   Look she knew what the climate was took her self out and Took A clipboard to Warren's VP chances as well.  JOE BIDEN OWES HER... For all we  know Amy and  kamala talks. Not everything has to be public.
Biden Harris 2020: very sad to have to vote for you
Me: (composing epic Biden meme)  Freaking wife: Dammit, all you do is post all day!  Me: What? I just finished taking away the kids‚Äô devices.  6 yo based gamer daughter: Mommy, you should be nicer to daddy. He works hard on Twitter all day.   Me: Here Eloise, take some Robux
I hope that when Biden/Harris walk into the White House Kamala kicks that front door open!!!
Here‚Äôs hoping Biden/Harris can execute this plan
Nah I‚Äôm not I got 25 on the ACT . That‚Äôs the sad part . I‚Äôm not smarter than many who simply refuse to see how this system works . Again if you think Biden will win put money on it
Thinking about how cool it would be if hunter Biden replaced Joe Biden and Kamalas dad replaced kamala
As a Black American I‚Äôve watched  do more for the Black community than Obama &amp; Biden (who did nothing)!  - School Choice   - Opportunity Zones   - First Step Act (criminal justice reform)   - Economic Opportunity &amp; Growth   - HBCU Funding (permanent)
PSA: I understand once again that Biden/Harris AREN‚ÄôT the dream team we need- but now isn‚Äôt the time to create viral tweets pointing those flaws out. Same reason as why third party voting this November is a vote for 45. We need to encourage all voters to elect Biden y‚Äôall.
Don't worry everyone I heard Joe Biden is the most electible Democrat so we should be fine
when I hear joe biden speak
Anyway, you can lampoon Biden all you want (and God knows I have and will continue to!), but the notion that Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama are somehow more politically skilled than him is not the slam-dunk case their doofus aides might think it is.
whites *who were really never in any danger of ever receiving a college degree*: trump: 64%, Biden 34% - Fixed it.
It use to be. Biden-Harris want to take away your freedoms
On the other hand, the Obama and Clinton teams‚Äô dismissiveness of Biden‚Äôs natural political skills is fairly typical of how dumb, insular and naval-gazing a lot of these people are.
It‚Äôs extremely easy in hindsight to criticize Obamaworld for hitching their wagon to Clinton instead of his own VP in 2016. But it wasn‚Äôt obvious at the time how serious Biden was about running, and she seemed like a natural successor.
üòÆHow Trump could lose the popular vote by 5M and still win
‚Äúexcuse me sir i need to hold you accountable for your problematic actions‚Äù i scream as Joe Biden‚Äôs jackbooted thugs toss me into an unmarked minivan for the Crime of having a bag of oregano on my person after leaving whole foods market
Idk what ur talking about cuz we‚Äôve always been allowed to........in fact she actively (!!) encourages it.................like ppl collectively dragged her when she said she‚Äôll be voting for Biden months ago
Just not pretending that my concerns aren't just him not being my "first choice" I feel like too many people love to gaslight the "Bernie bros"  It's annoying. Trump is the one we should blame. Not the people who actively work against him AND Biden
And sure maybe we'll all reluctantly vote for him when the time comes, but the problem is, it's not a matter of not being my first choice-- it's a matter of I, and others, are legitimately terrified of Biden as well. So I'm fine with people giving me reasons to vote for him,
HERE Comes The Bullshit. #FridayThoughts
What bothers me is people minimizing my concerns with Biden. I 1000% agree it's probably worth it, because yeah Trump is THAT dangerous. But I just feel like no one's listening to my concerns about how legitimately scared a lot of us are if Biden as well
For these very reasons (these issues being ignored) I'm also voting -against- Trump, but I can't bring myself to vote -for- Biden either.
I would never expose you üíñ And youre completely right. Your points are all valid. I don't mind people convincing me to vote for Biden. When it comes down to it I might do that. I agree with all your points
Forgive me if I'm not all excited about Kamala Harris being named as Biden's pick for VP. She's still a politician and how many politicians have you known that were genuinely for the people?
‚ÄúShe was mean to me and not nice like all women should be, and also she probably wasn‚Äôt born in the US cuz I‚Äôm racist and a baby and I can‚Äôt stand losing‚Äù ‚Äî Pres. Tr*mp on Kamala as Biden‚Äôs VP
It is privileged AF to not be planning to vote for Biden and Harris.
. . .and I always suspected Biden was a dick - but I'm not including a picture. . . .
YOU ALREADY COLLAPSED OUR COUNTRY TRUMP! BIDEN IS GOING TO FIX YOUR MESS. YOU ARE THE WORST POTUS EVER!
Hmm funny when Joe Biden mispronounces it though isnt it?
Biden/Harris 2020 "Our secret police will wear badges and maybe not misgender you".
That should be too hard to do since million have lost the only income they had and do not have any money to buy anything. We are faced with the most grievous condition as we sit on the cliff over a long fall and there is one way off of it, vote Biden/Harris on Nov3.
It's gonna be a while. Even if Joe Biden wins, the crazy runs deep here.
Not voting for you  because your not doing your job. So get out of my office #YourFired  via
I don‚Äôt protect someone because of the level of melanin in their skin.   You need to have values. Morals. Convictions.   Don‚Äôt sellout the moment you‚Äôre offered a seat of power.

Joe Biden wants to increase police funding. He is NOT advocating for police reform.   How is better again?
I wonder why   &amp; the other race-baiting grifters don‚Äôt call #Biden out on it.   Yet, President  the guy y‚Äôall irrationally hate, has championed the First Step Act undoing much of this inqeuality.   So tell me who‚Äôs the true ‚Äúracist‚Äù?!
In Biden‚Äôs 1994 Crime Bill he literally prohibited grants &amp; funding to anyone who is held in prison. This disproportionately hurt Black Americans.  So you want to talk about inequality?  is responsible for much of it.   Instead of promising to reform such he defends it.
Vote Biden Harris because literally we are living in an absolutely failed state right now.
Next person who says  "Joe Biden wasn't my first choice either, but--" is getting put in my next expose video

As born overseas while of if US State department parents  this paragraph makes me ill "Tammy Duckworth¬†of Illinois powerfully impressed Mr. Biden‚Äôs search team, but his lawyers feared she would face challenges to her eligibility because of the circumstances of her birth overseas
The idiot ass president is trying to illegally defund the United States Post Office because he doesn‚Äôt want Americans to mail-in vote (during a pandemic we are still in) and people are actually sitting up here saying they ‚Äúdon‚Äôt feel like‚Äù voting for Biden/Harris.
It will be spun that Biden isn‚Äôt Alpha Male enough to get pissed on by hookers.
I want sitcom Prez Biden &amp; Veep Beto, it would be so zany. Beto would bring his rock &amp; roll friends and borrow Jill‚Äôs dress and Biden would shimmy to Mars Volta good times would be had by all
Foreign relations are going to be so important and yet Biden is going to need to focus on Covid and the economy so he will need the absolute best at the UN
Gaza strip was getting bombed, Biden didn't say shit That's why I ain't vote for him, next one either I'ma part of the problem, my problem is I'm peaceful And I believe in the people
The debate on Kamala‚Äôs blackness, Biden‚Äôs age, their prison and crime backgrounds.. these are worthless discussions in August. What‚Äôs the point of making sure people dislike or like the candidates that are the only viable options? Just vote.
I believe in Heaven and in Hell.  This will be Biden‚Äôs eternity.  Confused and forever thinking he‚Äôs President.  And never being able to sniff hair or be touchy feely.
Are we seriously doing this bullsh*t AGAIN?
One Biden for Jill, one Biden for the campaign trail and one Biden to putter the Vette around the Dover Intdenational Speedway
absolutely not following your logic here.  What happens in 2024? I dunno, you try to elect AOC or someone? Biden won‚Äôt run again. guarantee you‚Äôll do better with that without four years of GOP voting-rights murder.

Kanya, you are being used to take away black votes from Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. Do you not see that? If you're the genius you say you want to be, you would recognize that. Write music and stay in your lane that you own.
that‚Äôs my point. the ad is made by them for trump and yet the symbolism supports their opposition and makes Biden look better when clearly they want trump to look stronger here
What these folks don't realize is that the focus right now needs to be on excising the tumor. Refusing to vote for Biden won't do anything but hand #45 another 4 years.
Unlike  Biden cares about you and everyone else. #BidenHarris2020
. agreed to be VP for a man she called a BIGOT just a few months ago!  - Biden endorsed the Crime Bill  - Kamala Harris Enforced it - Trump Championed the #FirstStepAct  Actions speak louder than words! Do your research!  &amp; they call us Black conservatives SELLOUTS?
Kamala, you are a hammerhead shark. Intelligent, adept and you come in packs. I'm so proud and waiting for your new ideas for this America. Biden/Harris 2020! You go girl
half my tweets get fifty quote tweets that all say ‚Äúwell what do you suppose we do instead?‚Äù and if that‚Äôs really your only line of rhetoric when someone questions Biden or Harris then it‚Äôs no wonder liberals are so nervous right now
my guy said racists are going to lose as if Joe Biden wasn‚Äôt a whole ass segregationist. whew.
Trump doesn‚Äôt want to test because then people will have coronavirus; he doesn‚Äôt want to fund the post office because then people will vote for Joe Biden. He is a spoiled child, not a president, and he is destroying our country. ü§¨
Agreed.
The Biden campaign, Democrats and all Americans should raising hell over this. Trump is admitting he wants to rig this election.
Biden wants a national mask mandate? Looks like I'll be breaking federal laws in November.
He‚Äôs definitely going to jail. President Biden will make sure of it
Not sure what the plan is when they run a handsome guy against Biden in 4 years and he gets smoked
Biden just asked for everyone to wear a face mask. Wentso  far as asked all governors to mandate there use. Said it will save 40 000 lives.   As a side note if you do wear  a mask until the vaccine arrives you automatic know you can wait to see if it is real.
Biden already got Illinois on lock . I‚Äôm just getting my popcorn, drone camera and body vest ready . in 2016 said you would focus on electoral college and money as speech . 0 progress on either instead media had people focused on Russia üòÇ Bernie endorsed Biden. Trump won

My one single white ‚Äúlibertarian‚Äù friend aka coworker respects Kamala. I believe he‚Äôs voting Biden for sure at this point.

Literally this. Also, the election is in 2.5 months. Are all these ‚Äúfighters‚Äù going to stage a coup in that time or just be angry from their keyboards. Real activists and organizers understand all of this which is why they‚Äôre holding their noses to vote for Biden
You've convinced yourself that you're doing such a GREAT and TREMENDOUS job! Those are two of your only vocabulary words right? You have single-handledly torn the U.S. to shreds and you think Biden-Harris will do worse than you? Spoken like a true narcissist.
I checked it yesterday and I couldn't believe it when I write the Joe Biden's campaign. I even posted it on his Twitter and ask what the hell is this old man. Now it says it's unavailable you got to be kidding me right boy they think we're stupid don't they.

13 million BLACK people opposed  1994 crime bill.  Why? Because it disproportionately HURT the Black community.  In context, 16 Million Black people voted in the 2016 election.  Let‚Äôs see how turnout goes!  Only those who are ignorant to the facts will vote for Biden.
You know ain't nobody big or important. at least I am to myself but Twitter blocks me because I'm responding on Joe Biden's page or Kamala Harris's page it's amazing that they can block you for 12 hours. Like that's going to make a difference or change my view üñïüñïüñïüñïüñïüñï
Nov we will have and continue to have a real man in the White House president Trump. He's the only one that can help America. 50 years of guys like Joe Biden just talking and mumbling get nothing done. And now I'm left satanic socialist is going to help.
I'll do do a virus started by China which is in the pockets with Joe Biden. You must be mentally Disturbed or just delusional to think that this old metal case man in this left-wing socialist is going to do anything good for America. Where do you come up with this satanic banter.

Just think of the next 20 years that can be as these progressive, pro-human players fall into place. AOC will have her place (she is already huge). Warren will have a place in his administration. She‚Äôs crucial. Biden is not forever, but he sees potential in incredible people.
Don‚Äôt pick apart Biden and Harris. Vote for them and talk trash later.     Another 4 years of the Dump Administration could literally end the world.
I can't stand Trump, I can't stand Biden, I can't stand Harris.  Obama was horrible, so was Bush, Clinton, other Bush, Reagan,  Carter and Ford,  and that's all of em in my lifetime.  You realize that 60% of eligible voters don't vote, right?  Why do you think that is?

This statement should be a Biden-Harris ad all by itself.
I also think Candace Owens is a piece of shit, does that make me a racist/sexist?  What if Trump dumps Pence and puts Diamond or Silk on the ticket?  Who am I supposed to vote for then?  I don't owe you, Biden or Harris a damn thing.
Of course they will run another Wall Steet Big Tech crony show, Biden &amp; Harris will not suddenly have different backers in Nov than they do, now, or become different people. And if we all believe they still "must win" &amp; give them unconditional support, we can't move them. (1)

Umm Biden/Harris would toss minorities in jail for years for non violent offenses
Pretty cool that if Biden loses we can blame toxic KHive Twitter users and if he wins we can prove toxic Twitter supporters aren't a real detriment
Neither Biden nor Harris have ever said that. You have nothing to contribute to a meaningful debate. Crawl back to your hole and prepare yourself for decades in the political wilderness.

Honestly, this really made me wanna vote for Biden instantly. Liked seeing those elbow in action üëçüèΩ
Well you know what Joe Biden said.
You can hate the two party system. You can hate that the presidential candidate isn‚Äôt more progressive. But Biden isn‚Äôt even in the same zip code as Trump when it comes to tearing down the democratic process here. No progressive ideas will see the light of day in Trump‚Äôs America.
I keep hearing from people that they aren‚Äôt enthused or that they hate the idea of settling. Look, I get it. So few people at the start of this had Biden as their candidate (I know I didn‚Äôt). So we‚Äôre all dealing with some disappointment. But every liberal cause is now at stake.

Sorry, but you're wrong.  Big picture it doesn't make a bit of difference who Biden picked for VP, or even who wins the election.  If you don't think Biden/Harris is pulling out the Gestapo first chance they get you're naive af.
Voting for Democrats is voting for future Marxism. Even if it's voting for "moderate" candidates such as Joe Biden..
I mean whatever you think of Harris and Biden there's zero moral argument to vote for Trump
She‚Äôs talk more in one day then Biden has in six months!  Who is going to be Kamala‚Äôs running mate? Biden won‚Äôt make it past the Democratic convention
Let me ask you: what kind of volunteer work have you done in black communities to help recently?  Racism and sexism are both very real, and Kamala Harris can also still be a cop that helped the systems we should rebel against.   I can vote for Biden/Harris and hate the ticket.

You go your way, I'll go mine.  But I'm never voting for Biden/Harris, and I'm going to spend the next three months winning as many people to that view as I can.
By March next yr if Biden wins the virus will show sign of slowing down. We need to remember Obama and Joe got the CDC  setup to handle pandemic by focusing on testing and separating the sick in the population.

you convict a black Trump supporter for real I‚Äôm with you not for Biden but you. So if that means he must be #1 then fuck it. I‚Äôm with you. I been talking about you since you been elected as a Republican that was brought in through Trump.
"[Trump] inherited the longest economic expansion in history from Barack Obama and Joe Biden. And then, like everything else he inherited, he ran it straight into the ground,"  said.  I can‚Äôt wait for her to just be brutal as hell for 3 months
Stfu bitch. I‚Äôm a republican who voted for Trump in 16‚Äô but I promise you I will vote for Biden because Kamala is in the most respectful way a black woman because she not for bs and don‚Äôt go against right.
I have been saying this since the primaries ended. It‚Äôs not as far left as I‚Äôd like but it‚Äôs moving. And that‚Äôs hopeful.
Boy Biden a clown wtf this bitch not it !
Reason 2,345,768 there is no way in hell I'm voting for Biden/Harris
The tweets I'm seeing pleading people to vote for Biden anyways are a guarantee Trump will win again.
so I‚Äôm watching trump talk and he‚Äôs reacting to Sen. Harris. Saying that she talked all this crap about Biden n that she did this, that and the other. He‚Äôs desperate
you must've haven't heard biden speak either. it needs to be an age limit on presidency 60 or younger
I thought early on Trump would refuse to debate any Democratic nominee, with the possible exception of Biden. He thinks Biden can‚Äôt hurt him in a debate. Joe is the quintessential hail fellow well met back slapping bro. He doesn‚Äôt know how to go for the jugular. Trump knows this.
Sure. I preferred other candidates, too. Doesn‚Äôt mean I‚Äôm gonna sit around and just complain about Biden‚Äôs flaws. There is plenty in his plans that I endorse. Much more than Trumps, to be sure.
I‚Äôm probably in the top 90th percentile of being good at people and Biden is in the 99th and let me tell you that is a fucking skill set that takes time and years to hone and acquire. Diplomacy saves financial/social capital too, but I‚Äôm sure I don‚Äôt need to tell Biden that

#ChrisWallace: #Trump Wishes #Biden Had Picked Anyone But #KamalaHarris"
She is a good politian. She and Biden is what this country desperately need. It's time cancel the failed reality TV show that has been going on for the last 4 years.
This is a great message of hope being delivered by Biden and Harris.
I‚Äôm not denying any of what you said. Strategic &amp; pragmatic as in: more left than Biden but not as left as Warren; robust Senate experience; ran a presidential campaign; brings a lot of diversity; will still get the youth vote (despite lack of enthusiasm for her)Can I suggest to my wish list that when Biden is president that Adam Schaffer‚Äôs is made Attorney General.
Another asinine tweet from a moron.  We have the worst president of my lifetime and arguably of our nation‚Äôs history  seated right now.  A Biden Harris administration will bring down our republic?  Please
I am voting for Biden/Harris in 2020 for obvious reasons. Trump has committed impeachable offenses, including dereliction of duty during a pandemic. In my heart, I know that Biden/Harris will restore and unite America, and undo all of Trump's heinous actions! #BidenHarris2020
My life does depend on it. That‚Äôs why I am voting BIDEN and hope Trump spends next 4 years in jail or courtrooms.
Agreed. I guess I‚Äôm just surprised because with a lot of mail in ballots coming in soon... this very much affects Biden. Especially if ‚Äúblue‚Äù areas are targeted by this nonsense.
80 percent of dems and a majority of Republicans support ending cannabis prohibition.  If biden cant even get on board with this common sense policy,  well hes obviously corrupt and only interested in his big money donors.
Biden should update his policies to reflect what his voters want then shouldn't he? After all politicians are supposed to be public servants.
What does this have to do with Biden ducking interviews and questions? Why Does the left always want to change the subject and not answer questions?
PSA calls it as they see it.  I'm a huge fan.  Biden clearly takes nothing political said about him personally.  So my response is a huge "So What?"
Some Republicans. That doesnt tell us anything. Biden is more popular with some Republicans.
These WH Press conferences always end up being China‚Äôs fault, everyday with Trump. Joe Biden‚Äôs right, Whiny!
1. You‚Äôre racist, or 2. Mysogynist, or 3. Weren‚Äôt going to vote for Biden anyway
This is what Biden/Harris want!!!!
Wow a huuuuuuuggggggee crowd must be employees of Biden and Harris
LIAR! Actually, more jobs are lost in 2020 than Obama and Biden created in the last 8 years. The unemployment rate in the US is  now at 10.2%.  When Obama left office, it was at 4.7%.
She is the real nominee. Not Biden
I can get over with a gradual improvement to our healthcare system. Partially because I am a realist and no fucking way that single payer will happen in the next decade and not because of Biden, because of US citizens and because of SCOTUS.
Of course she was, cause Biden is racist.
I just saw a tweet that said that Biden is like prince zuko and Kamala is like katara first of all, watch ya mouth
Even FDR needed to be forced left. Thing is voters actually did it. They didn't vote him in then check out. In 2010 and 2014 voters said we voted for Obama in 2008 and 2012 so we can take the election off. U want progressive change u vote Biden and progressives and in 2023
Of course it‚Äôs Biden/Harris.

There might be reasons that Biden shouldn‚Äôt debate Trump, but your analogies make no sense. Joe McCarthy and Robert Welch didn‚Äôt run for President....also I‚Äôm pretty sure the first Presidential debate was Kennedy/Nixon. The next was Ford/Carter in 1976
Biden DIDN‚ÄôT make the pick. The DNC and his handlers made the pick . Biden was just as surprised as the rest of us. He was like a kid getting a surprise birthday party ü•≥ üòé
Why do any Libertarians care?  We were not voting for Biden anyway, right?
Joe Biden's dementia isn't the path any country should take, his mental capacity, short-term memory issue and his global cognitive awareness is-rapidly deteriorating, it's sad yet clear
Interesting. I‚Äôve never seen any group so scared to have their nominee debate as I have so much with Biden. What is the fear?
Kamala Harris, Biden's V.P. Pick, Is First Woman of Color on Major Party Ticket
They would only be satisfied with Biden/Sanders. Wait let me correct. Sanders/Biden.  It isnt about progress it is a cult of personality.  I voted for Bernie in 2016, but not a member of the cult.
I am thrilled that Biden has chosen Kamala Harris as his Vice President mate.  I was hoping it would be her.  This is a very strong Democratic team for the 2020 race.
Biden selects California Sen. Kamala Harris as running mate  via
Biden and Harris - An incapable idiot and a radical leftist.  #KAG2020
Polar opposite personalities on that front. Pence provides the older/calmer demeanor while Harris will be far more vocal. I think this pick is awful on multiple fronts but how Biden thought it was a good choice is beyond me. It is free ads for trump
Biden actually chose a VP candidate who accused him of being a racist just a year ago on the democrat nominee debates. Our country is so f*cked lmao
Wait Biden picked her?
Yeah with or without Biden a rock is better than Trump
Biden: the pick is in!
Joe Biden nears conclusion of his vice presidential selection, but when will he announce?  via
Even better....Biden cut to Hillary, who then cuts to  who then introduces VP.
Interesting. I was in the UP over the weekend and literally saw no Biden signs, multiple Trump signs and some interesting wordsmithing involving Gov Whitmer.....
Do it Biden. Put a black woman on the ticket.
Yup.  I‚Äôm #RidinWithBiden2020!
Boating around St. Pete and Anna Maria Island FL a couple weeks ago saw a lot of Trump Flags, but not one Biden flag or sign
I dont know about that. The whole world, besides Russia, prefers Joe Biden. That includes the United States.
Hey Fox News why does  Biden have to pick a black I thought it was the best qualified Just to get the black vote That's what's wrong with this country today

Kanye is splitting...well TRYING TO split votes from biden... HE'S NOT SERIOUS
The #KanyeConJob is a deliberate attempt to take away critical African American and millennial votes away from Joe Biden. I urge my friends and mutuals in America, who are over 18, to vote for  American Democracy is at stake in this election.
Sorry Biden is not gonna win ladies and gents #KanyeConJob
Oh guaranteed, not to mention he‚Äôs inheriting the worst clusterf**k ever. It‚Äôs going to be a huge undertaking. I know Biden is capable and up to the job, but he will be blamed for the morons inaction.
Who‚Äôs this Joe Biden you speak of
I honestly believe when Biden gives his acceptance speech he should walk down ramp holding a massive water bottle. Then take a sip out of it before he starts speaking.
I can't wait until Biden list Trump's top 10 atrocities with the caption.. 'It Is What It Is'
President is only the leader in lies, crimes, golf, days vacation per year and fast food.   Amazing he gets 40% in polls and got elected with those qualifications.   Vote Biden.
The fact you think Biden will return normalcy is frightening.  Anyway I am trying to help mama jo debate, I don‚Äôt have to debate for her. So I‚Äôm only going to respond with memes from now on and of course #LetHerSpeak

Russia Working to Damage Biden's White House Bid, Spy Agencies Say  THey love President Trump.
Read my lips...Biden never said he was for defunding police
Your kidding, right? Biden hasn‚Äôt had anybody ‚Äùrecovery‚Äù because he hasn‚Äôt been president! And, as others have pointed out, these are just people returning to jobs they already had. And let‚Äôs not forget the 1.2 million new unemployment claims over the last week. Bunch of idiots
Biden won't even commit to correcting cannabis prohibition which has ruined hundreds of thousand of lives and has 80% support from his party.  Simply not being trump isn't good enough.
And Joe Biden is  a lesbian so we all have to pay the price !
I commended the guy, but I literally started out on my first comment by saying Biden has issues and was unsure if he could do the job.  What more do you want?  Why is it so hard for people to be critical of their own parties‚Äô candidate when they have major flaws?
This is a very valid point in that Biden actually apologized , whether it was necessary or not. Biden has tons of issues himself, and I have doubts of his ability to do the job. but humility is important when you‚Äôre a leader. Trump has zero humility.
The Republican Party...  Does not care if doctors and nurses die.  Does not care if essential workers die.  Does not care if old people die.  Does not care if teachers die.  Does not care if your children die.  And does not care about you.  Vote them out.  89 days to go.  #Biden
I have decided that Covid restrictions were all designed to keep Biden away from the public as much as possible.  When restrictions started to ease, Trump did a couple speeches. Biden, I don't think, can stand up to scrutiny,  so we're all back in jail. üôÑ
Oh.  My.  Biden....  Joe's gonna hurt god?  And destroy religion?  A feeble moron may have almost crippled the nation, but it takes a seriously powerful candidate to do all that.  He's got my vote.  #VoteBlueToEndThisNightmare
They're going to pull a bait and switch.  They're using Biden for election, but if, God forbid he got elected,  his DNC picked running mate would be pres. All the more reason to keep President Trump in office.The Obama people are jerks and didn't believe in Biden in 2020.  Obama was rooting for Sanders.
Been nightmares every night since Trump got elected. Our cities are burning and people are dying from a pandemic that he mishandled. I‚Äôll take my chances on Biden rather than certain disaster with Trump.

Wondering why Biden didn't do whay you claim in the 8 yrs in the Whitehouse or 30 yrs in Congress. Kamala ,you called Joe a racist during Debates.Were we to believe you then or now? You will truely come to know the power of God our Creator. And Great will be your fall
I blocked her and Joe Biden so their tweets don't show up on my timeline.
The 30-something liberal snowflakes whining about this could go to the polls and vote in person.  Exposure to a disease that likely won't kill you for a few minutes to vote early in an election and make sure Biden wins big on election night isn't the end of the world.

You were front &amp; center for Kavanaugh hanging. Used your celebrity, to get into the Capital.  You cheered on a unfounded, evidence free, hanging. Joe Biden accuser is dismissed?  If it were not for double standards, you wouldn't have any!
Hey, Molly... Biden wasn't my first choice, but he's certainly not "the lesser of two evils" !!
Unlike most potential presidents, no one knows what Biden stands for. He‚Äôs the figurehead for a shaky coalition that harbors radical views, writes
What happens if Biden wins?  Guaido might not be able to get lobbying and diplomatic pressure from a Biden administration if he campaigns for Trump.  Not to mention that Guaido needs Biden right now to unlock the game by throwing cold water on the fake elections.
You don't like the choice between trump and Biden?  Then how about choosing a decent person  Novel idea, I know, but boy do I miss decent.  So does the entire world.

Everyone who can't see a difference between Trump and Biden should just keep talking to each other on Twitter. Absolute buffoons.
"two point shift"? that's usually within the margin of error, and IMO doesn't justify an explanation. What's more interesting is the sheer size of the Trump-Biden gap, though we're still ~3 months out
The issue is the opposition descending into backbiting like they always do and the international community growing bored.  I haven't heard a lot from Biden's team or his campaign surrogates about Venezuela strategy, which concerns me that he might be open to fake elections.
Yes absolutely. AND after Biden wins we should accept nothing less than a full prosecution of Trump &amp; his cabinet. Do not fall asleep!
There is a difference. Voting for Trump in 2016 caused this entire mess we‚Äôre in. Appreciate the Biden vote now
As long as Mitch is feeling good about things, the rest of the county does not matter.  However, great campaign fodder for Biden, McConnell sends the Senate home for vacation during this mess.  --&gt; Dereliction of duty by the GOP, again.
The Pod Bros are tools and I would totally promise to vote for Biden if he disses Ben Rhodes and the rest of them.
I can‚Äôt wait for Biden to go on Cumtown next month.
Ralph Nader didn't put W in the White House. Kerry had a busted story - war hero/anti-war veteran/war hero to fight terror. So he got Swiftboated because when your story's broke your enemy defines you. Thank God Biden's got a tight narrative - decent man in time of indecency.
That is literally what Biden said.  Outside means outside.  Also, what does "alone" constitute in your mind?  If I am walking on a sidewalk in a shopping area should I wear a mask?
Jogging with a mask on or walking a dog outside with a mask on is exactly what Biden just said...  That is what wearing a mask outside means.  And that is ridiculous.
I don't like Biden all that much either but right now in America the only choices are bad or worse. In the end, when no other choice is presented, I will always take the lesser of the bad.
This is about the debates. Notice that he says 3 months. When the debates begin (September) Biden will say that Trump is responsible for 10,000 deaths because he ignored Biden‚Äôs mask advice in August. In October he‚Äôll say 20,000. This is all debate positioning.
yeah, I think I'm hearing you say biden gives us some breathing room... which I'm definitely sympathetic to
Hi.  I'm religious.  I'm OK with Biden-Harris.  Who were you talking about exactly?  Oh, I'm a liberal Jew.  You didn't mean me, right?  Because leftists who self-identify as religious don't count?
ok, I was confused before. now I know *why* I'm not voting for biden.
Misogyny and a 25 year campaign against HRC was a big player last time. They saw two equally awful evils. Hoping there is more clarity and less misogyny (Biden‚Äôs a dude) this time.
Plus, it‚Äôs all just so....tawdry and sad.  Who needs to even know this anymore?  Let‚Äôs just elect Biden, chalk it up to experience, and move the F on.
Correction: Our country IS collapsing now. We must elect Joe Biden.
If you disagree with someone, fine. But I am irritated with this trope about anyone who is not wild about Biden is a Russian agent. That's so dopey 50's-McCarthyite. Come on.
At this point both are correct.  Very difficult to understand Biden, just jiberish.

Hey, is it clear yet that if you don't vote for Biden, there's a good chance you won't ever have a chance to vote again?
They weren't going to vote for Biden under any circumstances. This is just a convenient cop out.
Well, you come out of the gate lying!! Donald Trump has done more for this country in his 3.5 years than the 3 previous Presidents combined. You are a fool's fool who knows nothing, ZIP, about how an economy runs and Biden knows less than you! Shameful!
The messaging I am seeing from the Trump campaign is stunningly bad/unprofessional. Trying to paint Biden-Harris as wild-eyed radicals?? That dog won‚Äôt hunt.
This is a Republican pollster and a 4 point improvement for Biden from June with them.
Of course DOJ should but Biden shouldn't go anywhere near that decision.

Next week  is speaking at the  Read his message about why  was the right person to join  on the ticket.
Silly man Biden did not pronounce her name correctly
There you go again commenting about meaningless drivel rather than about Biden selecting Harris and their socialist agenda for America. Unbelievable!
Is this supposed to be consistent with the Fox commentator predicting that Biden won't be on the ticket come November?
The fact that y‚Äôall really think you can pull the race card on Biden/Harris like Trump/Pence isn‚Äôt overtly racist is dumbfounding
Yeah, it's not. And believe me, I am not a big Biden fan. But I'm like understand you will not be able to achieve any reform under a second Trump term. Understand healthcare and abortion is on the chopping block. Criminal justice? He'll throw us all in jail.
Biden couldn't build a Lego tower in his current state. gtfo
This attack would be borderline cute but for the fact that Trump has stonewalled funding to modernize the northeast corridor‚Äòs transportation infrastructure ‚Äî one of the few areas of broad bipartisan concern ‚Äî and Biden is likely going to win 99% of the Amtrak employee vote.
I mean everybody starts somewhere but I think it's true that Americans in general don't prefer career politicians. Compare to Biden who was a Senator for 36 years or Hillary who had been around for decades before running.

I‚Äôm gonna be real honest with you here, ain‚Äôt shit gonna change when Biden and Harris win. They have no incentive to answer to us, the people. They only answer to their rich ass donors and themselves.
Sorry, no one was watching!! There was more interesting news on MSNBC! BIDEN/HARRIS!!!
Yeah, I kind of agree.  Or just have one so the Repubs can‚Äôt accuse Biden of being scared of debating.

Ambassador Neumann, these are all good things but I think that more is needed from Biden.  Will you agree with me that Biden should declare against the fake parliamentary elections in December and also repudiate the "mesita"?
Venezuelans would have a lot more power if they demanded things from Biden as well as Trump...  Like demanded that Biden declares against the fake parliamentary elections.
That is why she was selected. Not because she is simpatico to Biden
She was not my first choice, but I now see my error.  She is the right choice.   One clue to her value to Biden is that the Trump campaign team's responses were confused and contradictory.   They have no effective counter message to Kamala, and she takes media time from Trump.
People do realize that Kanye West joined BLM in June and donated $2 million. Since then, he announced he is running to pull votes away from Biden to help Trump. It's not a far leap to think he is using his new BLM $$ influence to trigger new unrest which also helps Trump.
Yep. I‚Äôm eligible in October. And voting for Biden/Harris the next month.
Worthwhile reflection on the type of man  is: a Mensch [Verified by  as authentic, FYI] I Know Joe Biden: Rabbi Michael Beals

Joe Biden thinks you can throw Kamala  out there
But Joe Biden thinks you can throw a Democrat out there
Someone else came up with it, but I like it. The condition for Biden to debate Trump is that Trump has to release his tax returns to the public.
5 Things to Know About Biden‚Äôs VP Pick, Kamala Harris ‚Äì Her Skeletons Have Skeletons
The GOP will become very concerned about this when Joe Biden is inaugurated.

It will also feel good when you are sworn in as part of the Biden administration.
As usual, think how the GOP would react if Biden (or any other Dem) stood up a fake campaign for a GOP candidate!  They would raise holy hell and impeach everyone. But it's okay for Jared to run this stupid operation, which he'll botch anyway.

Pennsylvania is Biden. Not going red. The conman has caught up to Trump there with enough people.
I guess the lesson is that Biden is not a narcissistic psychopath like Trump. He doesn't believe he has all of the answers to every question.
Sen. Kamala Harris wasn't on my radar somehow for this election, but having looked into things now, I feel a lot better voting for her than for Biden, and her history as a lawyer bodes well for,  y'know... not committing crimes in office. #BidenHarris2020
Both Kamala &amp; Biden have a history of signing bills that only serve to continue to imprison, separate &amp; oppress us. Niggas haven‚Äôt had a chance to vote for someone decent since I turned 18 so far be it from me to be the one to tell anyone where there loyalties should lie
I love this! ‚ù§üá∫üá≤  Watch "Joe Biden releases first ad with Kamala Harris as his running mate" on YouTube
Burn all this shit to the ground   Idk g, but it‚Äôs definitely not as simple as ‚Äúa vote against Biden is a vote for trump‚Äù or any of the other colloquialisms used lately.
Stop telling black people that voting for Biden/Kamala is the MORAL choice, those who harm our communities will continue to keep doing so in positions of power
I agree with this but also struggle. Many of Trump and Biden's policies are both life and death where a Green party candidate has actual plans to fix. This is a shit time for everyone
Kamala is a cop. Race and gender do not matter. Let's stop acting like the Biden/Harris ticket is exciting UNTIL they support M4A and Defunding the police
With apologies to The Wire and to Omar, ‚ÄúBiden don‚Äôt scare.‚Äù   Biden is a mature, confident person, comfortable in his own skin. It‚Äôs never been about Biden, it‚Äôs always about people and the country.   Not saying he‚Äôs perfect. We don‚Äôt need perfect. We just need good. Or better.
Although born &amp; raised in the city, I am now a "suburban white woman." I can't wait to, not only vote against *45 but throw my entire support behind "Biden/Harris 2020"
How long til after Biden gets elected he resigns due to some medical condition? Place your bets now :P
Though a better strategy would be for Biden to show up out of respect, but send a flood of messaging beforehand calling out Trump for his delusions, disrespect, demagoguery, and cognitive decline, then let him prove Biden right on the debate stage. Joe won‚Äôt even have to talk.
Translation: The privileged racist white stay at home mom will be voting for me. They want their neighborhoods to stay exclusively white and keep minorities out. Biden would reinstall it, in a bigger form, with Cory Booker in charge!
Agree. How can Biden ask or expect Trump to show respect for the democratic process when he‚Äôs never demonstrated the capability? In fact Trump continues do everything possible to undermine it. This can only called for in the most extreme of circumstances, but here we are.
"This is a winning pick for the Biden campaign in every way imaginable."  Joe Biden's pick of U.S. Senator Kamala Harris as his VP running mate may boost enthusiasm for him among Black voters, says Prof.
Trump would single out Booker because: 1) Trump is a lying idiot 2) Booker will be a powerful campaigner for Biden/Harris 3) Trump is completely ignorant 4) Maybe Trump got Booker and Ben ("Dr. HUD") Carson confused?
we are anti-all US presidents. the US empire shouldn‚Äôt exist + all US presidents have been evil war criminals, capitalists, white supremacists, and cops. trump is no diffferent than biden or obama at the end of the day, so we don‚Äôt see anything good abt identifying as anti-trump.
I‚Äôm certain Biden and the DNC had to heavily consider the best candidate based on SNL performances also.
I really hope they keep pushing this. Maybe it‚Äôll accidentally convince some of the ‚Äúbern it all down‚Äù crowd to get out and vote for the ‚Äúradical leftists‚Äù Biden/Harris.
I think that all Venezuelans, especially the US diaspora and  should lobby Biden and his advisers to come out against the December 6th farce elections in Venezuela.  This could help Guaido pressure Maduro into granting a delay and gaining conditions.
Believe me that single-payer isn't mainstream Democratic policy.  Free college for all isn't mainstream Democratic policy.  Biden won the Democratic primary while being against those things.
Yep If elected Harris would be president within one year due to Biden dementia issue
While voters don't pick their candidate based on their VP ,  can give the campaign just a little bit more mobility and range on left of center issues, and will help on messaging.  ( last night on #ChicagoTonight
LOL you're only making some of your racist base go vote for Biden instead with this ad!! üòÜüòÜüòÜ
I'd love to know what Biden's plan is (seriously).  I am legit afraid that he'd throw Guaido and the G4 under the bus in favor of the misfit toys in the "mesita" and endorse fake parliamentary elections like Chris Murphy seems to want to do.
Biden may be against sanctions, support fake elections, support the mesita, and throw Guaido under the bus.  That is the legitimate concern.
Do you think we will see Prince Harry campaigning for Joe Biden this year or is that a leap too far?
Biden is the top of the ticket. So it‚Äôs Trump or Biden? Pretty simple. Stop the nonsense
I have an aunt who lives in Hockessin, Delaware and every time I've seen my cousin he's like "I've been on Biden's property."  Yeah, honey, I've done my share of trespassing too.
This is really more of a Delaware joke than a Biden joke.
Kind of want to have an election night party.   "For Kamala we have Jamaican jerk chicken and Indian tikka masala. And for Biden, to represent Delaware we have...um...scrapple?"
Okay, but I'm excited to see who Biden picks for his Cabinet!
Biden/Harris 2020. I‚Äôm all in! #BidenHarris2020 #BidenHarris #Biden #Harris
Nobody in America should legitimately support Kamala Harris or be happy about Biden‚Äôs selection of her to be his running mate.
I think a lot the problem with politics is Republicans think Joe Biden and Kamala Harris are the radical left, and the actual left thinks Joe Biden and Kamala Harris are Republicans.
Sometimes the obvious needs to be pointed out.   The "racism" is on Laura Ingraham.  Kamala Harris is a proven vote getter in the the most populous state in the nation.  Joe Biden picked the candidate that would most help him get elected President.
Actually, Bill, that choice for VP actually hurts Biden and the Democrats. This is a woman who called Biden a sexist and racist and now they‚Äôre supposed to run together? Seriously? Do you think Harris is ready to run the country? I don‚Äôt. But that‚Äôs what will happen.
Finally some good news! Nearly a 20pt margin. Intraparty war is unavoidable with Biden's self-proclamation that he's just a bridge to the future.
Nothing against Maya Rudolph but I don't give a fuck that she may be getting more airtime because of Biden's VP pick.
He wants Nikki, he‚Äôll look weak doing it. He will be copying Biden, and will look small. But Trump will do it anyway out of desperation, plus because he IS small. He‚Äôll kick Pence to the curb if it helps him.
Yes but the Harris Biden 2020 platform is a plank on the Titanic
Doesn‚Äôt matter Harris Biden 2020 are going to loose
My takeaway: it looks I have the same laptop as Biden. Wonder if he also has keyboard issue with his, and how he deals with it.
Great for POTUS within a smaller and shrinking group of people.  Great for Biden in a larger and expanding group of people.
"All the White Guys"??   Some of us White Guys are fine with Biden's choice.  Oh, I almost forgot, Biden is a White Guy.
Go Kamala !! The winning ticket.
Can you guys please lobby Biden's advisors to come out with a statement against the December 6th Parliamentary Elections?  I think that Biden could do a lot of good with a statement like that.  He could give Guaido leverage to get the farces postponed and get conditions.
I am delighted there is a Biden/Harris Ticket! Made my day.

If you‚Äôre considering shaming people for not voting for BIDEN AND HARRIS, consider not doing that and instead helping the communities they‚Äôve helped ruin.  Y‚Äôall are too old to keep pretending Trump‚Äôs evil is responsible for everything wrong in the US or that it‚Äôs an anomaly.
Them: you picked  Biden: I told you it needed to be a woman, not dead fat wrestler!!! #toofar? #sorrynotsorry #icouldntresist #RIPKamalaWWE
Pretty soon I‚Äôm gonna read ‚Äúif you don‚Äôt vote out Trump by voting for Biden/Harris you‚Äôll be personally responsible for leaving those kids in cages!‚Äù and I‚Äôm gonna spontaneously combust
I think she was a great choice for Biden and one of the most qualified . Let the games begin !!!
With all due respect: when was Joe Biden excommunicated? When he mourned his son? When he spoke up for women‚Äôs agency? Spoke against Barr, the Catholic who orders executions in high speed? Could you please expand so that we can all read it, and hear what you really mean to say?
#Kamala Honors to the strong women in Biden‚Äôs possible picks for VP. Their collective support of Kamala is honorable. Women in solidarity of each other. Trump‚Äôs stoogie remarks show how scared he is.
Biden is Catholic...
Report: Harris Wasn't Biden's First Choice
Biden‚Äôs base is very excited. #Trump2020  #KamalaHarrisForVP
I would love to know Biden's position on the parliamentary "elections."  I think that both the EU and a potential Biden admin not throwing Maduro the lifeline he wants would be helpful.
I am a lifelong Democrat and would vote blue whoever &amp; I like Joe Biden, BUT VERY DISAPPOINTED IN HIS CHOICE OF KAMALA HARRIS. He wanted a "woman of color", which is fine, just thought there were others who would have been a better choice. Harris' record as prosecutor not good.
Not this white woman. Biden-Harris all the way
Saying I'm not voting means I'm not voting at all...not Trump and not Biden.
Nasty Women for Biden/Harris 2020 !!
Trump: If Biden wins, Americans will have to learn Chinese  via  if you win we‚Äôll have to learn Russian
Listen if Hamilton could endorse Jefferson then I can do my best to support Biden/Harris!
Biden taps Kamala Harris as running mate: Where does she stand on economic issues? More
Two fake people running for President and V.P. , BIDEN"S been cloned and KAMALA replaced by a look alike.
I was until my mom politely asked me to stop screaming biden/harris over and over. She is still mad about Joe biden üòÇ.
NOW WE HAVE A CLONED JOE BIDEN WITH DEMENTIA AND A REPLACEMENT KAMALA HARRIS.  SHOULD BE INTERESTING!
Joe Biden picks Kamala Harris as running mate - National |
Buzzing: Joe Biden selects Kamala Harris as his running mate
And a sign that he is someone who is willing to listen and learn and grow. And also shows that Biden knows this isn't just about him. It's about all of us. Way different than Trump's approach and in the best possible way. He had my vote, and now he has even more of my respect.
Aside from everything else that is being said now by the "pundits," it shows that Biden is the anti-narcissist, without ego problems.   Here he picks someone who very personally attacked him during a debate! Can you even imagine Trump doing that?
#TRUMP2020 biggest landslide in Presidential Election history? Who, besides the careerless ‚Äúoppressed‚Äù, is going to vote for Joe fucking Biden??
Joe Biden did the dumbest move ever and now Trump is going to win again lmao
Day One Biden/Harris: Boot this bozo!
. Congratulations! We are excited to do what it takes to get you and  into the White House! You are going to be a great #VP #VPHarris #BidenHarris #BidenHarris2020 #BidenHarris2020Landslide #Biden #TeamJoe #TeamKamala #MadamVicePresident #MadameVP #VoteBlue
Chuck Todd keeps comparing Biden/Harris to Reagan/Bush and I'm just like shut up.
not ridin with biden LMAO
It‚Äôll be a bigger beat down than Biden/Ryan 2012
Biden/Harris is the best possible ticket. There will be nit-picking and criticism, but nothing is ever said about trump/Pence, and they are a total disaster. I'll take Biden/Harris any day of the week.She'll eat Pence alive in debates.... plastic man and the prosecutor... yeh!
Captain Biden: Welcome aboard the Titanic
Great choice. Biden-Harris!They treated Isreal like crap, what A joke. Biden wants Islam taught in school, not Christianity or Judaism. That shows were his loyalty, not to mention his grasp on the whole Church &amp; State separation thing. #Trump2020NowMoreThanEver #VoterIDNow #IStandWithIsrael #tcot #Trump
BLM said Defund the Police while pushing their donation money to Joe Biden &amp; Kamala ‚ÄòTop Cop‚Äô Harris campaign. The irony LOL.
This girl just said ‚Äúyou said you‚Äôre not voting for Biden, so regardless of who u vote for ur vote is going to Trump.‚Äù Man 2020 has revved up the stupidity amongst Americans.
You still need metal parts. Expect a Biden-Harris admin to require matching serial numbers on multiple gun parts.
Trusting Kamala Harris to do right by Black people is like trusting Joe Biden around your children.
Now look at BidenüòÇ
Dr. Siegel tells Tucker Carlson there is 'no science' behind Biden's mask mandate  #FoxNews
My husband and I are white older Americans, no college education; however, our knuckles don‚Äôt hit the ground, so we are Biden voters.
Trump is also terrible and incompetent. Biden is colonialist. Trump is a white supremacist. Biden is also racist, but not a xenophibic nationalist.   We need a left party, but that isn't happening this time.   Let Dems lose to show 'em? That's what we did in 2016. It didn't work.
It's so difficult. I did not vote for Hillary, and I do not believe I was responsible for Trump. However, this time I feel like if I would be. I have been voting third party in the GE for over 30 yrs. For the same reasons you just changed. Biden is terrible and incompetent.
Biden calls for mandate requiring all Americans to wear masks
People think they have a moral high ground with Biden
Kamala Harris Lies Repeatedly in First Speech as Biden‚Äôs Running Mate
STOP LYING ü§• OBAMA/BIDEN WAS THE WORST ADMIN EVER! #OBAMAGATE
Joe Biden is a liar and a plagiarist.   He is the candidate of division and racial politics.
Interesting that Kamala Harris deep-sixed an ongoing investigation regarding allegations against Catholic clergy following her election to AG.  Suggesting the book, Profiles in Corruption by Peter Schweitzer. Chapter on Joe Biden as well.
Regarding military actions, Biden has no idea what‚Äôs going on so he‚Äôll be conveying it to Kamala. I honestly don‚Äôt think she‚Äôll be able to handle that correctly.
Anybody with a brain knows Biden isn‚Äôt mentally competent enough to hold the presidential office for four years.
Kamala called Biden racist because it was a debate so now we just calling people racist for a political tug. Sounds fishy now how that word is being used in the political realmüßê
Have to admit I teared up when you were talking about Beau Biden and his dad.
He can be whatever but I‚Äôm not saying he helped necessarily. I‚Äôm just saying with all that he has done I would just feed everybody to wolves aka Joe Biden and Kamala Harris.
I believe there is some kinda deviant behavior going on in the Democrat party. Biden can't debate #DonaldTrump. They are up to something. #Trump2020 #PatriotsAwakened #WalkAwayFromDemocratSocialistsc #VoterIDNow #FreedomOfSpeech #BuildTheWall
Watch all the other agenda come pulling through with the Dems and Biden
I've long wondered about those elusive likely voters, out there somewhere in the cosmos, who this week said to themselves "I was going to vote for Biden, but now that Kanye is in I'm on board with him".
Joe Biden for Black people?
Joe Biden picked a ‚Äúwoman of color‚Äù to be progressive instead of picking the best person available. Clown sh*tü§°
So Biden was Catholic when he ran for VP but not now?
Biden choosing Kamala Harris as his VP is a dog whistle for Black America‚Äôs matriarchal society.
So Biden said #YouAintBlack he was talking about Kamala. I completely get it now.
That did. I'm also happy. I think who ever makes Biden's decisions for him, made a mistake. We have on record saying she believes his accusers, how do you walk away from that? #Trump2020 #MAGA #PatriotsAwakened #tcot #VoterIDNow #FreedomOfSpeech #BuildTheWall
The New Blacks loving this Kamala/Biden combo
Trump signed the First Step Act, said Black Americans built this country, had the lowest Black unemployment rate in history, and did school of choice. I honestly would back out if I was him and feed y‚Äôall to Biden and Harris lmao.
Remember how Obama and Biden beat each other up trying for the nomination? Then became the best of buds.
I'm shocked that Kamala Harris has been picked as Biden's VP candidate.  Especially after she inadvertently called the entire Democrat party racist &amp; sexist.  TWICE!
Bet Biden steps down. Kamala moves up. Hillary is the VP.
If Biden wins he‚Äôll pass the Equality Act which will turn pedophilia from a crime to a sexuality. But aye what do I knowü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è #BidenHarris2020
So Black America says they‚Äôre tired of getting involved with the police yet are putting their faith in Biden and Harris. Make it make sense...
They said the country will go up in flames if Trump wins again and Biden is the lesser of two evils. The political ignorance is real folks!
Joe Biden could touch on little kids and people would still vote for him.   Oh wait...
BREAKING: Joe Biden and Kamala Harris criminal justice reform strategy.
The sad thing is, is that most Black people will be walking to that poll wiping their tears to vote for Bidenüò≠
Damn not ‚Äúif Biden dies‚Äù wowüò≠
The Boondocks would‚Äôve shattered an episode with this Biden/Harris presidential stuffüòÇ
Kamala Harris is not a natural born citizen. If senile hidin' Biden has to step down, guess who's next in line? Dumpster fire Pelosi. That's their plan.
Biden should‚Äôve just chose the best candidate. Why pander that hard just to be set up for failure...
Warren, Biden, and Harris democrats are all equally useless (democrats are all equally useless)
Joe Biden really wanted to lock up the Black vote...literallyüíÄ
I'm no fan of a Biden/Harris ticket.  But damn. The lowest ends of the opposition wasted no time getting to Wikipedia.
Kamala Harris is smarter than Biden, Trump and Pence combined. Today is a good day for our country.
My mom sitting over here sick with Joe Biden‚Äôs pick lmao
Illinois' own  not Joe Biden's pick as his running mate
Sniffing bigot Joe Biden
Hunter Biden left his wife for his deceased brother's widow. Then he cheated on her with a stripper, Lunden Roberts, got her pregnant, denied the child, &amp; dodged court dates to establish paternity {now confirmed}. If this was one of the Trump kids, the media would be all over it.
I trust Biden's pick, no matter who it is.  I don't, however, trust the media to not sow doubt into whomever it is by hashing over and over every little possible negative.    need to just accept and STFU.  ‚ù§Ô∏è
Joe sniffer bigot Biden
More than likely, Joe &amp; Hunter Biden will wind up there real soon.
From what I understand, if Biden is elected, we will. If Trump is elected he wants to make this windfall a gift. #Trump2020 has always kept his promises. #Trump2020NowMoreThanEver #MAGA #WalkAway #TrumpTrain #follo4follo #KAG #FreedomOfSpeech #BuildTheWall #VoterIDNow #Freedom
The Democrats are up to something, they damn well know Biden is not fit to be president. You can't lead  our nation from the basement. They are using this man for something deviant. #Trump2020NowMoreThanEver #MAGA #WalkAwayFromDemocratSocialists #MAGA #Trump
If the Democrats are willing to use a "friend" Joe Biden the way they are, then using the American people is nothing. They want POWER, they know Biden is a shell of his former self. #Trump2020NowMoreThanEver #MAGA #WalkAwayFromDemocratSocialists #MAGA #Trump #RedWaveRising2020
Joe Biden should pick Maxine Waters for V.P. She could really articulate with that loud mouth.
Joe Biden has been in the senate or WH longer than I have been alive. He says he can change everything for the better if we give him just a little more power. What has he changed in the last 40 years? Well he put a whole lot of POC in prison with the crime bill he's so proud of..
Black people complain about ‚Äúwhite supremacy‚Äù then forgive Joe Biden everytime he says something crazy but won‚Äôt forgive Kanye. Make it make sense...
idk if im getting old or this is a token year, but i am REALLY excited to see the presidential debates between Trump and Biden
Biden and Trump locked in. Ye sketching out a solid plan, ppl don‚Äôt like his comments about slavery and Harriet so I don‚Äôt see it gaining real tractionüò≠
‚ÄúI can beat Biden off write-in‚Äôs‚Äù -
I can‚Äôt imagine not one person voting for #crookedjoe, most #Americans see right through the #Biden campaign and unless he #debates  he will lose any sensible #American s vote! All #biden does is continuously insult the black &amp; Latino community , #BidenIsRacist
Never trump gives us a Biden presidency.
Just released ‚Äî   Preliminaries for the Trump v. Biden Debate:  1. Bill Walton v. Lou Holtz 2. Gary Busey v. Jose Canseco 3. Dick Vitale v. Tim McCarver
They have no where else to run to. Biden is like that abusive husband to them. Stockholm syndrome basically.
I have never agreed with any of Biden's policies, but it's very disturbing &amp; upsetting to see Biden decline before are very eyes. When the Democrats are willing to use &amp; belittle a man to gain power, what else will they do. Cheat,lie, and steal an election. #Trump2020 #voterID
This election is against candidate #DonaldTrump and the radical left. Joe Biden is a mere shell of a man being used by the Democrats to GAIN POWER. They don't care about nothing else, they are willing to embarrass Biden. No human decency. #Trump2020NowMoreThanEver #MAGA #KAG
If Joe Biden's family cared about him, they wouldn't let the Democrats use him. My God love your father/husband more than you hate Trump. #Trump2020NowMoreThanEver #MAGA #WalkAway #TrumpTrain #follo4follo #KAG #FreedomOfSpeech #BuildTheWall #VoterIDNow
The Black community has no diversity according To Joe Biden. WTF? What do they have? Hopefully not your vote. #Trump2020LetsSaveAmerica #MAGAROLLERCOASTER  #VoterIDNow #FreedomOfSpeech #BuildTheWall
Clearly you don't know how our voting system works.  A vote for anyone other than Biden is just helping Trump.

‚ÄúWhen Joe Biden is president he‚Äôll listen to the facts. He‚Äôll embrace science. And we will all be better for it.‚Äù Wait, that's Kamala, so it still doesn't count.
You are literally cheering over 10 million unemployed. No one is should be happy about where we are. No one including you or the don or future president Biden.
real leadership is what Trump announced this morning . Biden also said the travel ban was bad.
Trump supports law abiding hard working people. Biden/Harris support arrest for no mask and looters robbers murders arsonist destroying our cities.

You are playing right into the hands of China.  The same hands that pull the strings on senile old joe Biden.
I dispute that.  Not the thing about Biden, no.  I dispute her claim to have the power of thought.
If you think joe Biden getting a hold of an executive office is gonna lead to a Marxist revolution I‚Äôm really sorry. Nothing will change, Democrats don‚Äôt want it to.
This tweet of yours is racist, Joe Biden! Smell the coffin now, before it gets too late for you.
You have him confused with Biden
Wow!! What is this? A phone!?! Biden hides in his basement because they don‚Äôt want you to know it‚Äôs really a memory care unit.
Biden said the China travel ban was racist and Nancy told us to go have dinner in China town.  How soon we conveniently forget.
This is greatüéâ probably not far from the truth with the upcoming debate. We can only hope Biden comes locked in his TV!
Not worse than Biden who doesn‚Äôt know the state he‚Äôs in isn‚Äôt a city and the office he‚Äôs running for isn‚Äôt the Senate. As well as letting the party hide him in the basement for fear of what he‚Äôll say üòÇ
I‚Äôm grateful for the Biden/Harris ticket. Not ready to get too excited b/c after 2016, I‚Äôm realistic. A lot of BS is going to happen between now &amp; then &amp; I refuse to take anything for granted. I will vote, my husband will vote and my children will vote. BLUE!

5 Things to Know About Biden‚Äôs VP Pick, Kamala Harris ‚Äì Her Skeletons Have Skeletons
Racist PoS Donald Trump has less idea about what policies Joe Biden will or will not implement than he does about what colors human skin can achieve naturally.....
So, not an African American female as promised?  Another Joe Biden lie.
Though a better strategy would be for Biden to show up out of respect, but send a flood of messaging beforehand calling out Trump for his delusions, disrespect, demagoguery, and cognitive decline, then let him prove Biden right on the debate stage. Joe won‚Äôt even have to talk.
Agree. How can Biden ask or expect Trump to show respect for the democratic process when he‚Äôs never demonstrated the capability? In fact Trump continues do everything possible to undermine it. This can only called for in the most extreme of circumstances, but here we are.
Only just seen that Donald trump is 74 and Joe Biden is 77. Either of these two could die of old age whilst in office? Surely there are two better people for the job.
She is the biggest cop in California, she failed to prosecute Steve mnuchin, and she was arresting parents and their children for truancy. You couldn‚Äôt have made a worse choice Biden. Kamala Harris doesn‚Äôt fight for the working class and neither do you.
I had no hopes in Biden, but will vote for him for his VP pick  #KamalaHarris
If you see me liking any moderate Democrat posts it‚Äôs because my leftist ass is trying to deal with the fact that Biden/Harris are our only hope üòî
Kamala Harris is the perfect embodiment of America; she is American, Black, Asian, Indian, and she is a woman. She is so strong that the present man and his cronies in the white house fear her. By her selection as the VP pick, Joe Biden has proved America will rise from her shame
Biden/Harris 2020. I‚Äôm all in! #BidenHarris2020 #BidenHarris #Biden #Harris
I really want to go all in w/excitement for Biden/Harris but after 2016, I‚Äôm afraid to get my hopes up. I was soooo crushed. I don‚Äôt know if I can take that again. Especially this time. #VotingBlue
Hence these are called the swing states . Went to trump in ‚Äò16.Most likely will be the same this time around . AZ needs to be blue for Biden to win , was Red by a margin last time . Educated states like NY, CA, WA, IL all are blue.
Joe Biden when it‚Äôs time to draw the clock
Nobody in America should legitimately support Kamala Harris or be happy about Biden‚Äôs selection of her to be his running mate.
imagining an alt timeline where everything was exactly the same until today when Biden picked Chuck Schumer as his running mate
Biden is Catholic.
Joe Biden May be 77 now, but on November 3, he‚Äôll be 46. #BidenHarris2020 #BLM
She wasn‚Äôt my top choice but I do love her as the pick!! She is the right choice! I was voting Biden no matter what, even though he isn‚Äôt my fave pick. Anything but the d√©b√¢cle we have ‚Äúrunningl the country right now!
Report: Harris Wasn't Biden's First Choice
Most people understand what his schtick is now. He lies. About everything; in however it will help him in the moment. I personally know many R‚Äôs that voted for him but will not again.They‚Äôre voting for Biden.They want to reboot their party, but for now we fight together.
Agreed with all you said!!! Probably waaaay more excited about her as VP than Biden as P!!
I highly doubt this.  Biden insists he‚Äôs coming after your guns.
When Trump debates Biden.  Game over.  Biden shredded and walking in circles like he doesn‚Äôt know where he is.

2 years of politicing (if that word exists) and you have a choice of Trump or Biden.... is that the best the US has?
Seriously fuck this country. It's bad enough Trump is president but the  couldnt possibly pick THE ONE PERSON THAT WOULD BEAT HIM.. so we get stuck with fucking Joe Biden and now fucking Kamila "Cop" Harris as his VP in the height of BLM  Are you fucking kidding me

Trump claims "some say" that men are offended by Biden choosing a woman as his VP.  It's true, what we need is more men in politics.  "Some say" our president is out of his damn mind.

Vote Biden and no worry about SS.  He‚Äôll get $3 trillion for ya!  Trump won‚Äôt let Social Security go. He‚Äôs to smart for that.  He‚Äôll just change the way it‚Äôs funded.
I know my son who lost his job appreciates the $400.  We can fund social security by getting rid of some of the washington wreckless spending.  But hey,  if Biden‚Äôs elected, no worries.  He‚Äôs raising taxes $3 TRILLION.
I think what she meant was  a guy picking a girl as in Biden picking a VP not a girl meaning you HRC picking a guy! Got it!!

Even the most left leaning polls say that Trump has 25% of the black vote. Biden is making the same mistake Clinton made 4 yrs ago. He's alienating voters faster than Trump is.
It's all about control, influence, power. The DNC doesn't support Biden because they believe in his agenda (if he has any). They push the narrative. And they use naive people to do so.
We have a big voice to make:  - Biden who may be showing signs of mental decline  OR  - ‚ÄúThighland‚Äù Trump who has proven to be very very dumb   Not an easy choice.....
Joe Biden did nothing wrong.
Until the debates when Biden forgets where he is..
Yeah, there just isn't anyway a black joe biden voter would be enthused about kanye entering the race. Any black vote that kanye gets wasn't voting for Joe anyway.
Well the people who are running his campaign are Republican consultants. If he would just play music and shut up he might poach a few votes from Joe. But he wants to open his mouth so I don't expect him to do well at all. Black joe biden voters are not pivoting to kanye.
Biden Fucked Up, but at least he apologized.
Kanye can kick all the rocks. Your mental illness is not an excuse for you to sow chaos.
You should want to vote for Biden at all costs SE. A ‚Äòprotest‚Äô vote does not make sense here. We all have to band together to cut out the orange cancer.

Jeff Flake states he will vote for Joe Biden in November. Sort of. Maybe. #Newsnight
This is why Biden was never invited to the White House when Obama had foreign leaders visiting...
Biden doesn‚Äôt go around holding Bibles up that he‚Äôs never read!!!
Another way to interpret Trump's response is that he believes Biden to have monumental power beyond the comprehension of mere mortals.
Arrogance and ignorance. Everything he says is a lie. He just said that Joe Biden is against God and hates the Bible.  What an idiot and a global embarrassment.  The Orange Stain is the worst ever.
Biden should...Lol who cares doesn‚Äôt mean the PEOPLE in these unions will vote for Biden
You should absolutely vote before you see Biden debate. Everything is fine. Nothing to see here.
The polls that show the majority of Americans support wearing masks outside all the time.   Same polls that show Biden with a 7 point lead.  When is the last time you saw a neighbor mowing grass with a mask.

I find it very interesting that neither Joe Biden nor Kamala Harris find it necessary to call Trump and associates names!!  They get their point across without stooping to Trump‚Äôs low-life level.  I believe that is called CLASS!!!!
Atheists rank second to Black Protestants in support for Biden.
Real patriots at the USPS - Thank you. National Association of Letter Carriers Endorses Joe Biden
Remember not voting at all is a vote for Trump too. Vote for democracy, vote for Biden.

Their dreams? Number one on their list of most important dreams is the compete and total landslide for Joe Biden and the DemocratIC party on November 3. Start packing, Pu$$ygrabber-in-Chief.
Well, lot of us from the US east coast call Joe Biden "Uncle Joe" because we're pretty informal, but I've never heard anyone call Sanders that. Mix up?
The world has been laughing and taking adavantage of the United States since Trump stole the election! Vote Biden and make America great again!
If you do not collect payroll taxes, which is how social security is funded, you‚Äôre effectively killing social security. Biden did not lie. He understands math, which Trump obviously does not based on all the bankruptcies he‚Äôs been through.

Never going to. Biden is running on this. There go 50 million votes.
I just hope that before Biden/Harris go in the WH that they have the place bleached, exercised &amp; prayed over in every language!
I think the Biden campaign should convince Blake Shelton to run for President as a Democrat to steal away the rural Republican vote.  #BidenHarris2020
Thank God that Biden/Harris are on the scene to save our country.  As a senior, I have seen some shit in my day, but Trump is a dire threat to our democracy. Vote BLUE
Biden won't debate. Trump-Kanye debates every Saturday night until election day. I'll make the popcorn.
You are scared shitless &amp; you should be. We BIDEN/HARRIS supporters are coming for you &amp; Pence. You can try stopping us with your fake voter fraud claims, but we are making it to the polls &amp; on November 3rd you‚Äôre lying ass is gone.Stay nervous.Stay veeeeery nervous
In other news Joe Biden is trying his hardest to lose
Well if Trump loses, yes it will disappear but we‚Äôll have to endure Biden/Kamala for 4 years. If Trump wins, Covid will continue in retaliation. Yay for catch-22s!
So why is Biden your presidential candidate instead of Harris or Warren?  You apparently don‚Äôt practice what you preach!üê≠
I think its a shame that Beto, Stacey Abrams, and Lauren Underwood weren‚Äôt invited to speak at the convention but someone who constantly trashes the DNC and Biden and Kamala is allowed to speak.

ANTIFA was there and Trump said there was blame on both sides. Now we know who ANTIFA is. An arm of the Democrat Party.  Mr. Biden you are a blatant liar.
Just leave it at this. The United States cannot survive $3 trillion in tax increases for political favors. Hence, Biden can‚Äôt be elected.
He‚Äôs hoping for a Biden win in November and then for the feds to bail us out with the billions he‚Äôs at really requested from Trump who told him no. Locking down one more time may ensure he gets the money he wants
What was Joe Biden‚Äôs plan to stop COVID back in February or March?  I‚Äôm honestly asking.  I don‚Äôt remember.
Joe Biden  presser stating masks must be mandatory 4 all of Americans yet neither he nor Kamala are wearing a mask. He is inside with people present and that is far worse than being outside. Please Joe explain why you are not wearing a mask 100% of the time. Wating ??
Hope you are watching Joe Biden on TV right now! THIS is what a REAL President looks like!! Have a nice day!  Nearly 170,000 dead because of you!! #WearAMask #FAKEPresident
You must mean Biden, Bill Clinton, Anthony Weiner &amp; many more Dems! It‚Äôs all coming out and people will be shocked! It won‚Äôt be Trump going down, except for being the first President who truly stopped child sex trafficking, he has already beat other POTUS in arrests for it BIGLY!

Liberal here-I take the virus seriously, but I will wear a hazmat suit and stand in line for 8-10 hours in blazing hot sun just to make sure my vote for Biden-Harris counts
She‚Äôs right. He‚Äôs not going to make it to November 3. They will have to pull him from the ticket.
Why don‚Äôt they each (and Biden) take the Constitution test and compare scores?
I can hear her say that the deal began with the Obama-Biden administration
Jumping ahead, let's assume Biden wins.  Will Nancy Pelosi be Speaker again?
Have Biden and Harris issued a position on "Merry Christmas" yet?  I'm not getting in line at Walmart until I know what I can and can't say.
You directly contradicted yourself, first saying "to keep it to the here &amp; now" and then asking what Biden did 47 years ago. You really aren't very good at this.
Why is the big baby calling Biden a racist? Dump hates black ppl. That‚Äôs why him or his father didn‚Äôt rent to them back in the day. Or did crazy dump forget that? I think dump needs his moms teet again with all his crying!!
When Obama was President, we didn't have to use a mask. The country was never shut down. It wasn't always about him like Trump makes it out to be. When Obama and Biden were in office we were in a much better place as a country.
I'm pretty sure that's the plan... Biden is the one they believe has the best chance of winning. The more interesting bet is the reason they give for him stepping down....
So something will happen to Joe Biden according to Jeannine Piro. Do not let her get away with this.
The best is yet to come!   Vote Biden/Harris on  November 3!  ***Make All of America Great Again***
joe biden did the same in 08 and now he‚Äôs the nominee and is favored to win the presidency. people don‚Äôt care if you dropped out.
She is the real nominee. Not Biden
That‚Äôs part of why I love that she‚Äôs Joe Biden‚Äôs pick.
Rudy Giuliani‚Äôs daughter announces her support for Biden/Harris #SmartNews
Check out Biden outworking the President!
This is dictatorship:  "Trump says he‚Äôs blocking Postal Service funding because Democrats want to expand mail-in voting during pandemic"
I find it endearing that Biden calls his spouse Jilly &amp; Harris calls her spouse Dougy. Something about those affectionate gestures seems 2 show some sort of kindred spirit. I hope they continue 2 develop trust &amp; patience &amp; respect 4 each other within the crucible of the campaign.
I‚Äôm voting for Biden
No he won't, people want change. The only way he can win at this point is if he cheats. Biden is winning all ready according to some of (many) polls.
A family member said  was done because of the riots. I reminded him that those are left-wing lunatics, financially attached to the Biden campaign. We can‚Äôt reward their campaign of intimidation by voting for them.
Well she called Biden a rapist in one of the debates and now is happy to team up with him.  I'd say that qualifies as being a phony for sure
I‚Äôm guessing Joe Biden doesn‚Äôt care enough....
welp that‚Äôs it folks. looks like biden is winning in a landslide.
If I unfollowed you it's probably because I caught you supporting the Biden/Harris ticket. I'm not sorry.
I believe that Biden touches people in an inappropriate manner and I also believe he‚Äôs FAR less creepy than Trump and Pence.
What‚Äôs he so afraid of???                Biden/Harris 2020üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏
But now that we have CNN as an unofficial campaign channel of the Biden-Harris ticket, we can be rest assured that we can get 24/7 coverage of nothing but free Biden-Harris campaign ads
I‚Äôm telling you, I can‚Äôt believe  hasn‚Äôt made an ad blaming the sports chaos on trump. Imagine cfb fans voting for Biden just for no cfb season
Someone better tell Joe Biden! He already mispronounced it!
If Kamala Harris is strong... she would have turned down the Vice Presidency based on what she accused Biden of being. She‚Äôs nothing but a weak opportunist
Kamala Harris came out saying she believes and supports Joe Biden‚Äôs alleged rape victims...now she‚Äôs his running mate. This is American politics.
There‚Äôs plenty of other angles to go at Biden with and be successful. No need to even touch the racist or sexual abuse allegations.
He can't read  Keep that hole 5 inches above your bow ties shut about Biden's acuity.
The joke of the day: Conservatives for Biden!
Help send Joe Biden and Kamala Harris to the White House
READ THE THREAD.   We‚Äôre not just voting for Biden/Harris. We‚Äôre voting for so much more than that. And getting Trump out of office is just an extra added bonus.
I am not watching either! I am celebrating Biden/Harris then watching the Grassroots rally at 630. It's a Great Day!
Trump hasn't mention Biden or Harris. You guys haven't mentioned Cannon Hinnant.
You guys are the best!!!hard to watch him after Biden/Harris it was so refreshing!
I just can't believe a word Biden or Harris say. Friends, family, and strangers I find vote for them lose all my respect. Don't expect me to give a üí© if you are in trouble and need help. I will look you in the eye and laugh as you take your last breath. üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
I won‚Äôt lie.... Biden‚Äôs speech was the most Presidential speech we‚Äôve gotten since Trumps been in office.... Because he cannot even articulate what‚Äôs going on in the world.
biden is tearing trump a new one.
ABC News  interrupts Jeopardy to provide an unpaid campaign plug for Harris/Biden the highway to Venezuela. News staff was experiencing orgasmic quivers.
The madness stops with a Biden/Harris ticket? I‚Äôm equally scared for a Biden presidency, the same policies will be passed and the same bills will be signed. Only difference is the country will fall back asleep believing that we‚Äôre back to some sense of normalcy.
If Trump doesn‚Äôt attend the inauguration of Joe Biden, should he win, what happens to the football?  The guy quietly moves from one president to the next at 12pm on January 20th.

Right-Wing Bishop Dismisses Joe Biden‚Äôs Catholic Faith in Pathetic Attack

Biden is trying to give Harris the phone because he doesn‚Äôt understand she‚Äôs not in the room.
Your "logic" is absurd, since no one but the winner qualifies in your mind and Biden can't nominate himself. It's the case of your comment being ridiculous. Bless your heart.
You are nuts! You liberals always project! Biden is the one who can‚Äôt come out of his basement because he has dementia!
peters is constantly performing the same if not better than biden on average. lol.
Is the shaking of your glass the DTs or your fear of the Biden/Harris ticket?
Oh this is funny. Trump actually thinks Biden could possibly be a bigger racist than him. Hilarious.
That is so sick!   I believe the black/Asian/white communities will vote for Biden/Harris before Trump!!  We need a REAL President!!!
You are so sneaky Bill. A real genius. Since Joe says he's running against Joe Biden, let's have Kamala debate Joe Biden.  #BidenHarris2020  #MAGA2020LandslideVictory

Something Biden should definitely think about!  I do think that Biden is much tougher than Trump and his team think and definitely more cognitively fit.  Trump is the one who needs to beware! Remember ‚Äúcovfefe‚Äù?
Amazing,yet he, Comey, Strzuk, Clinton, Obama, Schiff, Pelosi, and so many more, all walk freely,no swat raid at gun point at their homes, nada. Now- Biden/Harris?Why?Please, action where your mouths are and indict these monsters, please!They‚Äôre literally destroying our country!
Biden is under no moral obligation to debate someone with no compunction about lying.

Biden vs. Trump: Where do the candidates stand on Social Security?  #FoxBusiness
any choice biden picked would be immensely better than pence.  whatever he has done if anything during his term.
I think this headline is sexist.  Could you imagine "Biden Embraces Durbin" or Biden Embraces Buttigieg" or "Trump Embraces Pence"? Uh-uh. It would have been "selects" or "announces." Do better, Chicago Tribune. #WeHaveHerBack #ChicagoTribune
Biden shot himself in the foot and gave Trump the election. He should have picked Tulsi Gabbard. A smart, articulate, young woman. Ex-military, dedicated to her religion of peace and kindness...she would have balanced the ticket. I support Trump, but I would have voted for them.
Biden is a strong leader who is respectful of others opions and take them into consideration when making a decision. A good leader will surround themselves with others that can give good information on the other side another set of eyes that may not see things the way he does.
Does  support this attempt by Democrats to destroy suburbs &amp; local control? If you have a ‚ÄúSave Main‚Äù sign in your yard in Glen Ellyn this is leaps &amp; bounds worse than anything you can imagine happening to your neighborhood #twill #AFFH
Morning everyone. I wanted to say something about reactions from last night. So, I know most of y'all are upset with Biden/Harris, I'm not happy either but let's really sit and think for a moment. Do we honestly really want another 4 years of Trump?
Why do any Libertarians care?  We were not voting for Biden anyway, right?
In Historic Pick, Joe Biden Taps Kamala Harris To Be His Running Mate
Biden waited to announce, now the news cycle is so far removed from where it was when Kamala was running that most boomers have probably forgotten all the bullshit that went down
In case you need more atheists to be disappointed by, here's Ayaan Hirsi Ali insanely claiming Biden wants Sharia Law.
Fundraising for Harrison has been through the roof recently and with biden closing the gap in this state, Harrison is out performing biden in multiple demographics.
In order to gain the minority vote the Democrats add Kamala Harris as the VP, Harris called Joe Biden a rapist and a racist during the primaries and is a firm supporter of legislation that is killing major cities in the US (like Chicago). Hypocrites!
Second historic ticket for future President Biden!
Today, the Biden-Harris campaign officially kicked off. 84 Days remain until we beat Donald Trump. And I advise you to use every last one of them to ensure we get Joe Biden and Kamala Harris into office.

Don't see what new voters she brings to Biden that he didn't already have. And he wins California anyway.
All those characteristics Donald Trump and his worthless kids lack!!   Joe Biden and Kamala Harris bring decency back to the White House and bring us back to a position of power in the world!!üóΩ
Biden taps Kamala Harris as running mate.  Someone at Fox 9 has a sense of humor.
üó≥ I am!! Biden/Harris all the way!!
Reporter: Mr. Biden, any comments on your selection of Kamala Harris as your running mate? Biden: Who's Biden?
Biden should have picked Tulsi Gabbard. She is smart, articulate, a veteran (the last veteran picked by the Dems war JFK), she is committed to her faith of peace and respect and a young attractive woman. She would bring balance to the Biden team, but Joe shot himself in the foot.
Imagine his excitement when Biden hears who he chose.
I think that a Biden Harris ticket will appeal to cross over voters. The least ‚Äòscary‚Äô ticket the Dems could have put up. RVAT will be on board. Just need the left of the Left to vote too.
Obama: ‚ÄúNailed it‚Äù  Biden: ‚ÄúUh.......nailed her......or its‚Äù
Remember when Kamala Harris called Joe Biden a Racist?
When Biden heard he picked Kamala Harris as his running made,  he responded, "darn, I wish he would've picked me".
Biden is Catholic. Harris is Baptist.   Republicans will still pretend they're godless.
No surprise here for anyone who's watched his shift to the right. Biden chose Harris, so the former president of American Atheists says he'll consider four more years of Christian Right rule.
College football is cancelled so the whole issue of players taking a knee is not relevant. Biden answered that with his VP pick.
I guess I'm more concerned about what does she bring to the table. She doesn't court progressives. She doesn't court black people. She doesn't bring in purple states. Unknown what she actually brings that can make biden a stronger candidate other than optics
Biden goes to the same Catholic Church as my grandma in Delaware.
I know that is why I said Joe Biden is the President not Kamala.
Lets hope that need will not arise. please. I just want Joe Biden to have his turn. without putting him one foot in the grave!
Yes! I'm am beyond thrilled!!! Can't wait to send in my check, get my sign, and get to work to elect the Biden-Harris ticket!
I am thrilled that Biden has chosen Kamala Harris as his Vice President mate.  I was hoping it would be her.  This is a very strong Democratic team for the 2020 race.
I am sooo EXCITED and looking forward to a landslide WIN in November as future VP Kamala described as ‚Äúa fearless fighter for the little guy and one of the country‚Äôs finest servants,‚Äù joins future President Biden in the November race. Every vote counts!!!
You‚Äôre babbling and running scare!! Biden/Harris 2020
Biden‚Äôs VP pick is the first hopeful thing that‚Äôs happened in this country in a long time,
I disagree but we will see how she will work for everyone. I will pray for her &amp; her family to help us to regain our dignity across the world. I promise to support her as she moves forward. I hope she will support Joe Biden as he did Obama!  Remember Joe Biden is the President!
I wouldnt worry. From her latest tweet. ‚ÄúI allow myself to get roped into arguments with Star Trek Trolls because it allows me to argue about something *abstract* instead of something that matters. Such as: Sweet Jesus if Biden doesn't pick a VP who is at least marginally...‚Äù
In case anyone on the Biden/Harris campaign in listening I'll debase myself for $100, heck, I'll talk myself down to $50 for you
Biden selects California Sen. Kamala Harris as running mate #SmartNews.It is most welcome and appropriate decision
Congratulations  ! Now we need all DuPage Dems to unite behind the Biden/Harris ticket and get intelligence, integrity, and a taste for justice back into the White House!
Biden would win California without her. What other state does she help him win.
Going to pass busy celebrating Biden/Harris announcement! Actually you can count me out for any of your briefings which I don't listen to anyway?
I raised my hand. I‚Äôm voting for Biden
Guess what Pence in many ways Biden is correct.
biden is a throw away candidate like  romney was in 2012..... the DNC is setting up  for 2024.. 2028...... # totalcontrol
A great pick. I was a Harris fan from the beginning and very happy Biden chose her.
Biden is a class act. This doesn‚Äôt surprise me one bit.
I am just so excited at the news!! Congratulations to Kamala Harris!! She will be great with Joe Biden!! There truly is a light at the end of the tunnel!!  My only disappointment: was looking forward to her being AG and going after Trump and family!!!

YES!!!! Biden/Harris 2020 #2020Election #BidenHarris2020
Maybe Biden is picking baby yoda
Biden: the pick is in!
As I said, I'll vote for Biden &amp; whoever. No need to snipe free thinkers or falsely elevate would be heroes. We're rooting for the same team, that shouldn't mean giving up individual opinions. My opinion wasn't veiled - Harris is ok (to me) &amp; still is.
Mikey, this is the Trump/Pence America!!!  The American people want competence. The American people want Joe Biden. The American people will speak on 11/3. Start packing.
Joe Biden could pick the superfecta at Churchill Downs, unless he says, "Rioting and looting are never acceptable and in a free society must be felt with swiftly and harshly.", he will lose, probably in spectacular fashion.
I wonder what roll he‚Äôs gonna play in the Biden admin. I miss hearing from him.
Believe Joe Biden? Hell no.
If the FBI looted the Trump Campaign headquarters and got away with it under the direction and approval of Obama and Biden is it no surprise looters can loot with impunity in Chicago?
If Joe Biden picks a black female VP he may get 20% of the 12% of the black population to vote for him.   Trump got far more than that good jobs.Stop trying to snatch defeat before the election. This is counterproductive. This could have been written while Obama and Biden were in office years ago.
Major US postal workers union endorses Biden for president
The National Association of Letter Carriers represents 300,000 current and retired workers.
I'm voting for Biden. It's fun trolling the president.
Just to be clear, me voting for #HawkinsWalker2020  is not helping trump, cause I would not be voting for Biden either way. If there was truly only two choices, I wouldn't choose either Biden or trump. Because neither of them or thier parties give a dam about the workers.
‚ÄòJoe doesn‚Äôt know too much‚Äô: #Trump slams #Biden‚Äôs call for a nationwide mask mandate, Democrat irony detected ‚Äì
I bet John Lewis was pretty fucking tired too.  I bet the rise of Trump was devastating to him.  So what do you want to do?  Give up?  What‚Äôs the point of this tweet?  Nevertheless, we persist.  You remember that?  Vote Biden/Harris.
This 7-second clip of Kamala Harris, from before her being named as Biden's running mate, has been viewed 6 million times.  The Democratic VP candidate is popular in a way Mike Pence can never be.
Biden and vice presidential running mate Sen. Kamala Harris spoke briefly Thursday after being briefed by public health and economic experts on the coronavirus pandemic. What are your thoughts on a national face mask requirement?
I feel some confidence that Biden can be pushed to the left, but also little confidence that he'll do anything about income inequality or foreign intervention.
I pay more attention to the ratings. The more people that watch Fox, it tells me who the viewers will vote for. Biden and Trump know that. That is why they are spending almost double the ad revenue with Fox than CNN and MSNBC combined.
Fifteen lies that POUTS keeps repeating in the propaganzas he pretends are "press briefings" or "news conferences".  [They're neither; there is little new, they are rife with false claims, and he rarely gives an honest, straight answer to a question.]
Also POUTS: "If Biden and Harris are elected, they will steer the Earth into the Sun!"
I agree with the folks talking about courting centrist/moderate Republican and Independent voters. If those people see a prominent, nationally recognized Republican talking about why they should vote for Biden they might actually think about it.
Feel free to criticize Biden all you want when he is in a position to "hurt" you. Right now, trump is the danger.
Forgive  man. He get delusional like Biden
Watching Obama and Biden together was extraordinary and wonderful. Kind of like watching a father play ball with his son before little league.
Why are you boosting Biden-Harris with tweets like this?
It does when you consider the very real possibility that Biden could die in office. They needed someone that would play puppet for the DNC if Biden does kick that bucket. Fucked up.
She talked like physically something is going to happen to Biden, the the other guy kind of rescued her out of that conversation! She should be removed for her statement, plus is she planting ideas in a deranged Trump supporters mind? Sick lady!
After 51 Years in DC ,If you think Joe Biden  is suddenly going to bring change. You are an Idiot!
Clearly, Pirro has a direct channel to QAnon.  Her prediction of Biden's demise is as certain as QAnon's prediction of Hillary Clinton's arrest and deportation in 2017.
The fact that Republicans are indoctrinated is not news, let alone newsworthy.  What matters now is how Independent voters view the Biden-Harris ticket vs the Trump-Haley - sorry, "Trump-Pence" ticket.
Yea for sure. I‚Äôm not saying it is. I am saying the fact of the matter is we will either have Biden or Trump as our piece of shit president.
The Q Cucks Clan is out in FORCE attacking Kamala Harris and Joe Biden. They can ALL go to hell.  While I'm at it, ANYONE who is OK with taking ANY risk of giving tRump and his Nazi fife 4 more years, can go fuck themselves, too.  If THAT is your thing, unfollow me immediately.
No I actually know about it, was just hoping you might be able to link me to something more creditable than ‚Äúsupposedly‚Äù. I fucking hate Biden, &amp; if I had to guess, I‚Äôd say he totally assaulted her, but I‚Äôm not about to make judgements without any proof.
Biden‚Äôs a rapist?
So you genuinely prefer the Green Party over Biden?
The responses I‚Äôm getting to this prove the point I‚Äôm making. I see A LOT of rude criticism of people who are settling for Biden, yet so many of you clearly have settled for the Green Party. If you want Bernie, vote Bernie. It‚Äôs equally as productive as voting Green.
I cringe at the idea of having to vote for Biden/Harris but to put it simply -I am not a trump supporter, so I will be contributing to the alternative. This does not correct much, but it‚Äôs a start to undoing the hate that has unraveled since 2016
Neither Biden or Harris mentioned George Floyd or Breonna Taylor. Think about that!
When the field of dems was in double digits Biden was of the last preferences for me. Our 2 party system is horrid but abjecting is support for trump. There‚Äôs no way around that. He is pure hate and I cannot support him in any way. Biden‚Äôs bad, but 45 is in another league.
Biden has a terrible history and so does Harris but it‚Äôs nothing near the incumbent. I hate having 2 bad choices but I can be sensible enough to not pout &amp; throw a self righteous hissy fit about it.  I‚Äôm voting for Biden who I hate slightly less than 45

I don‚Äôt use my xfinity Comcast email address for anything. What are the chances they sold it to the Red and Blue? First Trump emails and now Biden‚Äôs joined the party. #comcast #xfinity #democrats #republican #spam
It‚Äôs always been on us to force change. Whoever is in office is just the barrier. With Biden, the barrier is not as staggering, though he is undoubtedly a barrier.
The two appeared for the first time together as the Democratic presidential ticket.
Maybe the reason CNN is covering Biden live and not Trump is that Biden is credible and presents new, reliable information.  And POUTS just doesn't. #NoMoreFreePropaganzas

I agree. I was just pointing out that the same people complaining about Biden/Harris are the same people that voted for Biden, for the most part. Like we did this to ourselves. Shut up and go vote for him on 11/3. Your time to change the nomination was 2-3 months ago.
The issue is, there were better candidates. It is the voters fault we have Biden. Still better than Trump. Until people are willing to vote for a forward thinking politician ( we will continue to have more of the same, which sucks.

So with Biden‚Äôs VP pick does this means she will do all the speaking or just some????
Donnie,   Did you notice sleepy Joe Biden, picked Kamala? That means you will lose in the biggest defeat EVER!!!! BYE BYE DONNIE
The end result is that the DNC/Biden campaign is, again, counting on both flipping Republican votes, and people on the left-wing of the Democrats voting out of fear of a second Trump term, because nobody on the left is buying Biden/Harris as close to progressive. (5)
This ignores that Biden is basically loathed by leftists both in and out of the party, due to his essentially center-right track record, and a campaign that's essentially "lets just go back to the disappointing Obama years." (4/)
The other strategy is trying to portray Biden as the "left-winger" and Harris as his balance, in theory to try to appeal to a broader base. This was similar to the Obama/Biden ticket, with Obama at least advocating some left policies in his campaign, with Biden as a moderate.(3/)
The Dems are hoping to run the same play as 2016, now that you have organized groups of anti-Trump Republicans endorsing Biden. However, HRC partly lost big states in the rust belt by not actively campaigning in them, and given the realities of 2020, Biden may not be able to.(2/)
My guess is, they're trying to spin Biden as the "left" candidate while using Harris to appeal to the "law &amp; order" crowd. Similar to Obama/Biden. Its a common strategy, even if the candidates don't fall into those categories at all in reality
The first-term U.S. Senator from Illinois was on Biden's list as a possible running mate.
The icing on the cake of the Biden-Harris ticket?  When they win, right-wing extremists can't contemplate agitating some nut job to try to take out Biden, because it would leave a black woman in the Oval Office.  Heh.
congratulations on being selected as joe Biden running mate. Frankly i was hoping you would've got the nomination.... But its good to see you'll be part of the administration.
Joe Biden &amp; Kamala Harris being the focus of today's new cycle has absolutely flipped Trumps crazy switch. He's going off on Hannity tonight. Just a rambling idiot.
Don't worry, Brie.  Senator Sanders has already endorsed the Biden-Harris ticket.  Now we're just waiting for the Sanders campaign laggards to catch up.
Don‚Äôt fall into the Democrats big trap that takes the focus off of Joe Biden and puts focus on his VP choice. No doubt that sleepy Joe will go deeper into hiding and VP Harris will be at the Democratic forefront üí•

Looking at Biden, he has a terrible record from his past- when it comes to race, for women, for rights. And it‚Äôs terrible, we all wanted Bernie. But what we can do is vote for the policies he has on the table right now, they aren‚Äôt the best- but tolerable compared to Trump.

Keep brown people out of the suburbs is all this is. I can't wait until.Biden wins and puts this country back on track and improves the lives of all the people not just the rich of white ones.
Biden looks like he's moving a lot because he's making up for twenty years of Democrats failing to keep up with American society‚Äîwhich they go away with (until 2016) because the Republicans are so far off center that Democrats didn't feel the usual pressure to keep pace.
If anything, Obama and Clinton were the outliers here. Both were well to the right of mainstream. Obama got away with it, but Clinton did not. Biden is trying not to repeat Clinton's mistake.
Democrats are supposed to be the majority party. Majority parties have to track with majority opinion or they stop being the majority party.  Biden is doing what every Democrat has done since 1930, and yet people like you act surprised when they do it.

Gm everyone today could be it Biden could announce his VP pick today and i hope he does the patience is wearing off
Biden who??üò´üòÇü§£
Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, on Biden‚Äôs VP shortlist, created ‚Äúeviction diversion‚Äù program
You are essentially voting for trump and that will be on you when trump DESTROYS Our country...Decency obviously means nothing to you if you can‚Äôt get your own way. Biden will take us in the right direction, trump will take us backwards.
This is not helpful if Biden picks Whitmer i would be cool with that she would make a great VP but she is needed in Michigan right now so it is unlikely that Biden will pick her
I would rather wait for Biden to announce it then to text and get my hopes up too high
I didn‚Äôt vote for Trump. I read the article. Biden doesn‚Äôt get to win simply because one person at CNN thinks he should. He has to earn it. I suspect the Dems wish he didn‚Äôt have to. The media should not be protecting a candidate. They wouldn‚Äôt if they believed in him.
Lol trump say if Biden win China and Russia will own us (economy wise) and 401k and stocks will go down üßê
all Biden gotta say is he bringing back back page
There should be an ad of Biden repeatedly saying ‚ÄúPerson, woman, man, camera, tv. ‚Äú
:32 on Biden and 1:07 on Trump but yeah you just focus on the Biden stuff., keep living in that fantasy world like your father is......#DumpTrump2020 #UnfitForOffice #UnfitToBePresident
If he does Biden wins the election period there will be nothing Trump can do to win if that happens. No Republican has ever won without Texas if the GOP won Texas in 1976 Carter most likely wouldn't be president
If they are united, try to sow dissension among them. -Sun Tzu.  No mention of electing a Biden puppet.

Opinion: Joe Biden just destroyed one of Trump‚Äôs biggest attack lines ‚Äî CNN
Since Biden will announce his VP pick soon we don't know how soon it's time to get #BidenHarris2020 trending and make some noise. Who's with me?
that's hilarious I just wrote a post on Joe Biden's page and they just temporary block me for 23 hours who cares oh my God these idiots are dumb people in America are still going to vote for Donald Trump no matter what.
makes a great point- Biden has improved in polling from 2016 by over 10% in the Midwest with white voters.
Joe Biden supports the murder of unborn children. A million a year. Have fun with that guy Mr moral.
drunk Pelosi stumbling out her words again, of course China would rather have Joe Biden. anyone like Iran and China would love to see a puppet like Joe Biden give away the whole United States why he's smiling. can't wait to President Trump wins again the swamp will be revealed.
Have you seen the latest pictures of Biden‚Äôs rally?  Shoulder to shoulder, no masks!  Maybe they‚Äôve decided to commit suicide without wasting campaign funds on Koolaid!  üòπ

Good morning everyone i can't wait for Biden to make his VP announcement am running out of patience
Some advice for Biden
Try looking for FACTS instead of political lies. Trump isn‚Äôt the one who plans on ending social security and Medicare. That‚Äôs Bernie errrr...I mean Biden as his puppet.
We have a lot more proof that Trump has mentally lost a step than Biden.

You mean the pro Biden commercials?
You don't need to pick between apologizing for Trump and apologizing for Biden.
Joe Biden is the architect of the War on Drugs. He's been trying to cut social security for decades. He's a segregationist. He's overseen half a dozen genocides.
Of course 4 years of Trump is going to do irreparable harm to our country. So will 4 years of Biden. The harm is non-negotiable.
Liberals are too racist to comprehend that Joe Biden would do the same thing to the US that he did to South America
Change is not more likely through Biden. He's going to revoke more rights and hurt more public programs. He's not the best we can do right now, he's not even better than nothing.
Voting for Joe Biden isn't saving anyone from strife. You're latching onto voting to convince yourself that you have some ability to do anything to help, but you don't. At least not individuallyyour democratic candidate joe biden can blackmail the president of ukraine, but trump asking about it is an impeachable offense? got it.

DECISION 2020: Joe Biden and Kamala Harris delivered an aggressive one-two attack on the character and performance of President Donald Trump on Wednesday as they made their election case for the first time as running mates.
Definitely.  But will it be less, bc they‚Äôll have to hide/gaslight?  And...we get another chance at a progressive in 2024.  Biden wins &amp; it will be neoliberals for another 8-12 years.

It‚Äôs win/win for them.  If Drumpf wins they make more money fear monger ing for another 4 years....  If Biden wins, corps consolidate power while further disenfranchising progressives &amp; progressive policies.  Workers are the only losers, no matter how the election goes.
Trump last month had said she would be ‚Äúa fine choice.‚Äù
üòÇüòÇüòÇin your dreams!!! Biden/Harris will be getting my vote!!!
Defunding the police is one of the stupidest ideas ever.... Antifa is a joke...last and not least JOE BIDEN is a PEDOPHILE... Have a good night everybody... ANARCHY IS LIFE
I really think the Dems are trying to lose.  Kasich as a speaker? Dem platform? Kamala? Anytime Biden comes out if the basement?  Yeah...they make more money &amp; have plausible deniability if they lose. It‚Äôs on purpose.

‚ÄúWhy do I need to name a VP? I‚Äôm the VP!‚Äî-Joe Biden
Have you noticed that both Drumpf &amp; Biden need someone to explain what the hell they‚Äôre talking about?  They both supposedly speak English, yet we need translators....  #GoGreen
Lol, hiden Biden. #SleepyJoe
I‚Äôm sad for Biden, but angry at his wife and the Democrats for allowing this travesty and senior abuse to take place.
I heard on the  today the great one call Biden a Trojan horse for antifa/blm/Marxists. What if he's a Trojan horse and Thats one head of the hydra. If the Dems get nation
I can‚Äôt wait for you to throw a fit in November when your buddy Biden doesn‚Äôt win, just like Hilary was ‚Äúleading the polls‚Äù how that end up for you, better just get use to it the trump train will be chugging for 4 more years bud
Who will you be voting for, Joe??   ‚ÄúWe can only re-elect President Trump!‚Äù- Joe Biden.
There is a chance of that cus it‚Äôs being reported across the country so Chris Wallace you are biased cus that is more a fact than him afraid of Biden cus in a fair election with VOTER ID AN NO MAIL IN BALLOTS this will landslide to Trump again but you protect the left! Yep
Chris you say your not for one or the other but what you said about Trump being afraid wants more debates He wants more debates to open the eyes of America and get all 330million. For you to openly say He‚Äôs scared cus of Biden. Nope but there is a very good chance
What happens if Biden gets the nomination and people begin sending in their votes via mail for him. Then it is determined he is not mentally capable and is replaced by someone else. Do the early votes for him stand? I presume so but....... Keep up the good fight!
I heard an indirect theory on the election, its not trump vs biden, its trump vs pelosi, because if there's no clear winner by Jan 20, Pelosi assumes the presidency until there is a winner, so if every couple days a new batch of ballots is found, we end up with president pelosi
üòÇ you really think Biden has a chanceWhat if Carter or HW didn‚Äôt lose like gentlemen? Trump is trying to make USA a Belarus ‚Äúdemocracy‚Äù? We need to VOTE in mass to save our country. #FascistTrump #ItIsWhatItIs #Biden #BidenHarris
Give biden a chance
Union president Fredric Rolando said Democrat Joe Biden is a "fierce ally and defender of the United States Postal Service."
Right after they help Trump win again because Biden fails the Progressive purity test.
Vote Biden, country first!
Did Nader vote for the War or did Biden and Hillary? Pipe down
Of course you know any PowerPoint the Biden team puts together is gonna have paragraphs of text on each page and he‚Äôll end up just reading off of it
Biden took office when you could buy leaded gas. He was there for both oil shocks and both versions of CAFE.  In 4 years, you dropped oil to $0 and just made Isreal and the UAE BFFs. Going for peace in the entire Middle East and fixing CAFE in the next 4 years?
thinking ab the way someone explained voting for biden being taking a bullet to the leg while voting for trump is taking a bullet to the heart and honestly? yeah! like i‚Äôm not happy about it but at least i won‚Äôt DIE
When Biden first took office as a Senator, you could be leaded gas.
So if Biden and Harris was  to win the election she‚Äôs not a legit candidate according to the law so the president could refuse step down awesome
what are you talking about they both have said that they will vote for Biden and even if they didn't they live in Vermont and New York lol
I‚Äôll be voting in Illinois for Trump.  Maybe a miracle will happen and he‚Äôll carry the state!   Hard to imagine anyone voting for Biden on purpose.
Trump‚Äôs team is replete with excellent female talent.  Biden can only dream of having such a team.  Only a misogynist would foreclose the search for female talent by stating up front that men need not apply.  No confidence in women!
Sadly I am riding with Biden
We all now know the utter and criminal vindictiveness of Obama and his fellow Democrats, including Biden.  Should they return to power, Trump will be in mortal danger from their open corruption.  Democrats are at war with America.  Let‚Äôs defeat them.  #MAGA2020
Biden is also not in his right mind.  A presidential candidate in his condition is a complete embarassment for his party.  Trump is certainly a handful, but he‚Äôs been an amazingly effective president who keeps promises and works tirelessly for the benefit of all Americans.  #MAGA
Joe Biden is calling for a nationwide mask mandate, citing health experts' predictions that it could save 40,000 lives over the next three months. What are your thoughts on a nationwide mask requirement?
We know why the Democrats and fake news outlets like Fox CNN ABC CBS etc. are not talking about it but why are Republicans and the president not talking about the fact that Harris parents weren‚Äôt citizens when she was born therefore she can never be president when Biden stepsdown
I mean... if you weren‚Äôt invited and Biden invited Kasich and Bloomberg?
Joe Biden‚Äôs VP Pick Cements Shift to the Militant, Radically Anti-Gun Left
Hi Elizabeth! I wanted Biden to pick you, but he did the politically correct thing. Let's hope &amp; pray Ms. Harris is everything we need and more!
She does nothing but lie.    Why do you always lie? Do you still believe  accusers? Still believe he is a racist as you stated  short time ago?   Kamala Harris Lies Repeatedly in First Speech as Biden‚Äôs Running Mate
Even all around the Biden‚Äôs
Also: Joe Biden is the secret head of Antifa/BLM while *simultaneously* being a closet segregationist.
It was awful how Biden bragged about grabbing women by the pussy. Oh, wait.
Deadass all yalls reasons for why I should vote Biden are just why I shouldnt let Trump get elected. Stop pretending it's noble or patriotic to vote for him. It sucks, full stop.
I watch the president‚Äòs news conference I love the way the reporter kept saying we don‚Äôt know who‚Äôs behind it we don‚Äôt know who‚Äôs behind it when she asked about antifa Biden hook up when you type in antifa(1)
Already done after you and Biden spoke today! #VoteBidenHarris2020 #BidenHarris2020Landslide #VoteOutCorruptGOP #TrumpIsNotWell #TrumpVirusDeathToll165K
I bet Joe Biden got permission to play the song too!
Idk I mean Biden can't even say sentences correctly. Trump is terrible but I doubt Biden is the answer. Good thing there is checks and balances otherwise, whether it be Trump or Biden, America would be in worse shape then it already is.
You personally profited $300,000 dollars from PPP funds. You are a criminal and I hope the Biden administration pursues charges against all of the fraud in the PPP.
‚ÄúHe inherited the longest economic expansion in history from Barack Obama and Joe Biden. And then, like everything else he inherited, he ran it straight into the ground."
Joe Biden introduced his newly chosen running mate Kamala Harris on Wednesday, with the former vice president and California senator appearing for the first time together as the Democratic presidential ticket.
I swore during the primary I wasn't going to simp for Biden, but the amount of misinformation I see people who claim to be progressives are spewing about his policies / platforms is changing that really quickly.  Get informed. Get registered. Vote.
So the people vote for Biden and now they‚Äôre pushing them aside to replace him with Harris as always your vote means nothing in the Democratic plantation That‚Äôs what cnn is saying
I'd encourage you to read up on Biden's climate plan as well as Harris's voting record with regards to that topic before calling them evil.  They aren't as progressive as AOC / Bernie - but they have some good decisions behind them.
On yesterday‚Äôs VP podcast, your recommendation on how Biden and Harris explain the debate spat... reconciliation... perfect. Also, spot on with Harris needing work on her occasional snarky tone. Thanks.

Nah we been saying fuck the cops for months and biden done picked a fucking cop. I hate it here
The evil liars never seem to get sick with anything coming from liar45 mismanagement but it‚Äôs shameful they suck out blood of children they leave in the desert to die. Republicans will block them from being held accountable for their broken oath to America! But when Biden is in!
I definitely hope u and Biden do not win even though I don't like Trump.. sounds like u want our country in debt for grand children to have to pay the stimulus back.. 2,000 for parents plus 2,000 per kid.  That is outrageous
So it's joe biden and kamala harris, huh? ... ... ...
I'm probably going to remember Joe Biden awkwardly pawing that quadraplegic's face while telling him he's valid or whatever for the rest of my life
y‚Äôall be like ‚Äúmake sure y‚Äôall vote, but don‚Äôt vote for Biden or Trump‚Äù like huh?
Joe Biden is making his first appearance with newly chosen running mate Kamala Harris at 1 p.m. Wednesday.
I use to claim progressive until Dem primary. Bernie supporters/progressives became hostile to reality. Black people overwhelmingly VOTED for Biden and that was and still is ignored. Dont agree on policy, that's fine but the votes dont lie.
Kamala/Biden really? dems May have just lost California too! Kamala dropped out of the primaries right before she registered single digits in her home state! LOL
The kind that deals with Russian bounties on the heads of our soldiers, I hope! Vote for Biden-Harris!
actually, the point of the video was ‚Äújoe biden has a racism problem‚Äù. if you think that being the president of the united states for 4 years excuses the idea of having a (hypothetical) 6+ hour video proof of racist comments..... somn waaaay wrong here
It's strange here. Joe Biden was the choice population voted for, but government is Republican.
Duckworth is in her first term as Illinois' junior U.S. Senator.
Idk how to feel about Biden, like I hate him but isn‚Äôt Donald trump worse? I would literally vote for the squirrel in ice age over trump any day.
The fix is in. Harris is a long-tongued liar, a stooge, and a tool of a very dark agenda.   It started the day the 20 democrat candidates decided to drop out and make room for a dementia patient, Biden.  Now here we are.  Vote Trump 2020, GOP in all races.
I have been saying this ever since Biden got the nomination. They will use the 25th within 6 months of the Inauguration and Biden goes bye bye. Most important election in November! #Trump2020
Biden-Harris 2020! Vote for Joe! And Kamala!
Just imagine Biden and Harris in the White House most of the black community will be locked up
:45 into Reuters's video you see Kamala behind a Biden podium and not one mask or lonely person in sight.  Democrats revisiting the 90's fad of pox parties?
If there is one thing today I‚Äôm thankful for is I‚Äôm not in the Biden basement with crazy Joe and lose lips Harris
You literally said ‚ÄúWhite guys telling Black voters‚Äù on a Trump tweet. Figured you were talking about Trump. I think both canditates are trash either way but I def wont be voting for Biden just cuz he has a Black running mate lmaooooo
Biden literally said we aren‚Äôt Black if we don‚Äôt vote for him ü§°ü§°ü§°
For as stupid as no malarkey was, and it was so goddamn stupid, at least you knew it referred to biden ya know
I don‚Äôt like Kamala Harris, but I‚Äôm begrudgingly still voting for Biden
"Joe Biden selects Senator Kamala Harris to be his vice presidential running mate"
I stan the character development. RIP my morals but Biden üòî
Someone should print out all the tweets trump has posted since his election day and just have Biden and Harris lug it around to physically reference when asked what they'd do differently.
Leftists in the DNC had their change with Bernie, the dem party internally worked to shut him out and actively backed Biden and lo and behold he's the nominee. It's actively depressing and I think that's the idea after a certain point
And Biden not having enough of a policy or belief system to care that that's what his campaign is
I can't imagine this is anything other than the dem establishment thinking they get use fear of Trump to scrub the left leaning elements out of the party and use a Biden win as a sorta counter to Hillary showing that no, centrists don't beat fascists
anyway Biden is probably going to manage to lose now and i'm gonna go play more Shenmue
The whole Biden nomination process is wild because it's so directly disconnected to everything happening in the zeitgeist today. Like he doesn't back medicare for all, he doesn't support decriminalizing illegal immigration or defunding ICE, he's make a cop his VP
The progressive vote is going to be from mostly young voters I think, and young voters need inspired to vote. I don‚Äôt think Kamala or Biden are going to inspire the youth. I personally feel like Biden was the appeal to the moderate swing voters. He is the status quo.
The lady who has locked people up for weed then laughs on stage about giving tried weed herself. That along with her peak in the polls being 15% shows she isn‚Äôt super popular amongst progressives, which Biden needs to win.
Yes after Joe‚Äôs Announcement MAGA Biden/Harris 2020
Biden cannot be allowed to win, Harris is unhinged
So joe Biden picks up an ex cop and the biggest prosecutor of black men? Ok chief
With fewer than 100 days until the presidential election, presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden announced Tuesday that Kamala Harris will be his running mate.
BREAKING: Joe Biden has chosen California Sen. Kamala Harris as his running mate.
There are still plenty of folks who voted Trump in 2016 because they believed he was a "lesser of two evils"  If you think the VP selection doesn't matter, you're wrong.   Biden can't just look "less evil"; he has to look good.
Joe Biden is on the cusp of announcing the biggest, and possibly most consequential, decision of his political career with the unveiling of his running mate.
Thank you!! Thats how I feel. Someone suggested Biden should present his cabinet now. I think it's a good idea
If I‚Äôm doing Twitter correctly Biden‚Äôs running mate is...Bindi Irwin. #Biden2020 #biden #Veepstakes #runningmate

If Biden wins, Ron Johnson will find himself in extra deep doodoo.
Biden bought him a pizza and that's how he got his endorsement without supporting UBI
Good, because when Biden is president, he will need the revenue from the financial transaction tax to fill in the huge crater your incompetence has made in the federal deficit.
From your lips to Biden's ears, my friend. üôÇ
All talk no action Graham worthless in congress and never forget his bff‚Äôs Biden and McCain
Sweet. Biden / Imminent 2020. Works for me.

No, I'm not voting for Trump.  I despise pedophiles so I'll be voting Biden
Biden 2020! Fuck the rube MAGA Cult
Dr. Jill Biden speaking to us!
Biden said it himself. Open your eyes. Push through the TDS
As if voting for Biden isn't wasting a vote. Your statement is utterly irresponsible and disgusting. If ANY presidential candidate were to shoot someone on 5th Ave, they should be eliminated immediately. And to express approval of such an act PROVES what is wrong in this country!
They don‚Äôt understand fully what‚Äôs about to happen.  Then when April comes along and Trump is not in office they‚Äôll blame Biden.
The name Andriy Derkach sounds familiar Ron?  It should since the Kremlin linked Ukrainian admitted he is passing you and Grassley info. He betrayed you Ronnie. Doesn‚Äôt sound like you have a problem with Russia after all.
RUN FOR THE HILLS!!! Biden called for raising levies on taxpayers with incomes exceeding $400k ü•±
djt is a soulless swamp monster that has sucked the morality out of everyone around him with his mental instability and mental incompetency. Biden is Einstein in comparison.
Rep. Kathy Castor wants Florida Congresswoman Val Demings to be the next vice president, other congresswomen including Congresswoman Karen Bass (D-CA), Senators Tammy Duckworth (D-IL), and Kamala Harris (D-CA) also made the shortlist.
Saw progressives doing this a lot with Biden clips during the primary season too.  This is an example of the media playing you.   They don't want you informed, they want you angry, because angry generates engagement and on social media engagement is profit.
I‚Äôve seen one press conference where Biden took scripted questions. Let‚Äôs not play just one side of the equation here.
Show us on the doll where Biden hurt God.  I have no interest in whatever you say about the ‚ÄúChina Virus.‚Äù  You‚Äôve already failed us.
Biden apparently thinks there‚Äôs only one black vote, because ‚Äòthose people‚Äô are all the same, unlike the gloriously diverse hispanic crowd.
Trump vs Biden Twitter war.
Combine this with the "you ain't black" if you don't vote for him and Joe Biden is looking pretty racist right now
West said ‚¨á   ‚ùå slavery was a choice &amp; Harriet Tubman didn't help slaves  ‚ùå he wears a MAGA hat and Confederate flag  ‚ùå he has a mental illness which seems to be inconsistently treated  These factors appeal more to Trump's base than Biden's
Right? I don't care if Biden picks a cactus!! Vote them all out!  And fill out your census! üòÄ
People camp on the sidewalk to get Black Friday deals, I'd line for 8 hours to vote for Biden.
Trump was literally sued for racial decriminalization over his Trump apartments.  Biden has received multiple civil rights awards and recognitions.
American voters deserve the truth about your tax returns  ! Jerk!
As funny as it is to think that Biden could hurt god,
This is also how Joe Biden sees the future of America's immigration policy so just keep that in mind when you see people not engaged with voting in a few months
It's time to cancel
Thanks for not covering Biden‚Äôs racist comment.  Your #FakeNews  reputation is intact
Lol, really? I don‚Äôt know if I can vote for Biden if he picks a VP candidate I don‚Äôt like... He could pick a corn cob &amp; I‚Äôll still vote for him. Get over yourself, ma‚Äôam.
I do not want Biden I don‚Äôt want trump. Shit fucking sucks and I don‚Äôt think either can make it 4 years into a presidency. Just focus on your local elections people.
As a white male American  &amp; Donald Trump are not only embarrassing; they‚Äôre also criminals and racial bigots!!! This is the USA not 1930‚Äôs Germany.  #Biden2020ToSaveAmerica #IamAnEmbarrasedWhiteAmerican #Biden #AmericansAreOne

Just like how Biden said YOU AINT BLACK if we don‚Äôt vote for him right??? ü§°ü§°ü§°
They are both racist old White men lol Sorry. Did you not just hear what Biden said in an interview the other day. He said the Black community isn‚Äôt as diverse as the hispanic community. Basically dogging us. The whole government is corrupt, I can‚Äôt believe you are falling for it
45 just said Biden is ‚Äúagainst guns.... against god.‚Äù The truly crazy part? This is all most of his base needs to hear. The Idiocracy is strong with the uneducated right.Is he freaking joking?  "Nothing will change",  "I will veto Medicare for all" now badly needs progressives?  Well this progressive does not need you:
I haven‚Äôt seen anything about President Trump playing golf since COVID 19 began Joe Biden and Kamala Harris day nothing but lies!!!
The Democrat version of free speech. It will completely disappear under Biden
Vote for Biden who doesn't want to be a DICTATOR!
Do the Democrats think the world is as gullible as they are? They would think the VP choice is the greatest even if Biden picked Minnie Mouse
Go in the basement with Biden where there is no internet please
When you revealed your true feelings about Joe Biden it brought tears to my eyes.  My question is, are you ignoring those feelings and memories in exchange for sycophancy, money, and power? I hope not.
#faceoftyranny #poserjoe  Joe Biden And Kamala Harris Call For Mask Mandates Nationwide To Prevent Coronavirus  via
They found a way to trash Trump and try to steal credit for Trump's success and cover their own FAILED policies. Biden and Obama despised Israel and supported Iran. Who are they kidding? Very little coverage from the left. But they had #poserpresbiden press conference.
Poser 'President' Biden told them to mandate mask wearing outside. It's not about your rights.
Biden is trying to take credit of this semi-non deal you refer to.
Dolly is the exception rather than the rule in the country music arena. She must have the same problems Biden has once you hit your 70s!
When I watched your press conference with Joe Biden I realized that Joe made a brilliant choice.  I was proud and excited that you and Joe will be representing me in November. I can hardly wait until our incompetent narcissistic president is thrown out of office.
Eric Trump: Don‚Äôt know why Harris will ‚Äòmagically become this unicorn to rejuvenate Biden‚Äô  via   This could have been said in less words: "Eric Trump doesn't know jack"
It is, and  says this for why they need to vote: It raises the sea level.  The less Biden loses by in any GOP stronghold, the less votes he needs to pull out of Democratic strongholds.  Or, the more he wins by and the more we repudiate Trumpism.
To all the Americans who have any doubts whether Joe Biden and Kamala Harris are up to the job, I implore you to watch this video.

Unbelievable. Biden failed and now claims credit for Trump success.
Fuck Biden and Harris but we desperately need to win this
I think Trump would flip if all of a sudden Biden and Harris start leading the country, proposing and Congress start approving and passing things that can be passed without exec ordersüòÜ
Fuck Biden and Harris but we desperately need this. Vote, for God's sake vote.
Scott, civil public discussion is a thing of the past.  If you are a vocal Trump supporter, you are a Nazi.  If you are a vocal  Biden supporter, you want to ‚Äúgive away the country.‚Äù  There‚Äôs no discussion, just denigration.
Have you read -  Jill Biden and Douglas Emhoff are building a beautiful virtual friendship  #JoeBiden #KamalaHarris - your thoughts?
Will anyone actually keep count?  Kamala Harris Lies Repeatedly in First Speech as Biden‚Äôs Running Mate
I agree. On day one Biden's gonna have all his picks ready to go!
I am already noticing lie-based attack ads against Biden and Harris.put out by your campaign.  One thing that is no lie is your abysmal performance as president.  Your influence is disappearing every day before our eyes, Donny.
It's amazing how the black people like Kamala Harris support the racist Joe Biden, she claimed he is, so strongly in the Democrats primaries.
I would trust most used car salespeople before Biden/Harris
That's Biden.
Hahahahahahahahahahahaha... Seems like Harris and Biden.  But that's actually sad.
Harris will destroy this country if Biden wins. It is bad enough that incompetant Biden might win
Fox is getting hard for me to watch anymore. Too many MyPillow comercials and it makes me sick to watch so much of Biden and Harris
But your main premise is not true. Biden did not propose that we ban fracking.
Great to see Obama in this and not Biden. Biden is too demented to fight anyone lol
pro slavery, I realize I have to put all the bs asside and vote for the side that doesn't have someone trying to bring back slavery, because lets face it if Biden wins, his vp is the real president. Seriously please don't support her, don't support slavery.
Biden is a corrupt senile old man and Harris kept valuable information that would have proven without a doubt that a man was innocent, she was in favor of making marijuana illegal and laughed about jailing people even though she herself has smoked it, she-
See even if trump loses he wins because ppl despise him so much they will vote him out only to vote in a passive-aggressive form trump which is what joe Biden is
Some ppl don‚Äôt care all they see is black...look at the response from black celebs when Biden pick a ‚Äúblack women‚Äù as his VP they all loved it even tho she is the worst
I'm not afraid to say that Kamala Harris is a bitch.  She has her personal goals to achieve and nothing or nobody else matters for her. She doesn't care about Biden at all! She sniffs a chance for her! The left mob will love her. But this is not enough to help to win for Biden.
Trump completely screwed up a thriving economy Obama/Biden created. Trump had a guideline for battling any new virus and discarded it well in advance of the Trump Corona Virus.
Damn they found all 50 Biden supporters!
I don't think so  - do VP picks really mean that much to people? Not enough to sway anyone to vote or not vote for one of the two illustrious choices we have for POTUS. I would think if anything, Ms. Harris brings some respectability to the Biden ticket.
Be realistic, do you want trump? Because no one else but Biden stands a chance. And have you seen immigration nation? Those cages weren‚Äôt for children. The Obama administration wanted immigrants who were criminals out, not everyone who came here illegally. It‚Äôs trump or Biden.
And Biden promotes China.
Pelosi is an old person just like biden. Time for both to go out to pastures
Dream on, Don. Your actual opponent is Joe Biden. Pay attention.
It‚Äôs between trump and Biden and they both have allegations. But at least Biden doesn‚Äôt lock up children and separate them from their families
Next President of the United States Joe Biden and the next Vice President Kamala Harris.
She‚Äôs NOT black.  She bashed Biden, what changed.  Oh she maybe President!! Think twice!!
Great Biden gets the white house. We take everything else. Let's get all our friends to join direct groups. üòè
Idk if it's PBS or the DNC but whoever is doing the pre-speech music for this biden/harris ordeal is slaying.
This Kamala Harris, even in a deceased state, is a far better choice than the one Creepy Joe Biden chose.
Yeah in terms of environment Trump is honestly the worst, although with the Biden's mental decline, Kamala will be the real presidential candidate and with what she has done to people and her authoritarian ideals, I don't feel like she's better than Trump.
Although Biden is further to the right than Trump, so how is that going to help the left?
Would you REALLY be expressing those kinds of concerns if the VP were a man? You said "she's VP, not President. People were concerned that she is....blah blah blah....." Check your reality as it relates to having a woman capable of leading the country with Biden.
It says so much about our beautiful country that a major party ticket now includes a Black and South Asian American woman. Congratulations, Kamala #MVP
I'm sorry but I have to disagree with being able to be able get much more done with Biden and Harris. They are both far more to the right than Trump and have been shown to be far more authoritarian and a genuine threat to African Americans.
You know Donny, I found the extremely cruel words you spoke questioning Joe Biden's belief in God, offensive and something a Christian would never say.

Have you read -  Trevor Noah has thoughts on Joe Biden picking Kamala Harris as his running mate  #JoeBiden #TheDailyShow - your thoughts?
It's funny how hypocritical Trump is calling Joe Biden "sleepy Joe" when Mike Pence constantly  sleeps on the job, Kamala Harris is gonna make him her bitch in their debate.
If you look at the past 2-3 decades we are given George W, war criminal, then insane Palin, and now this turd.  It keeps getting worse.  I think that electing "Nothing will change" Biden will mean that in 4 years we brace ourselves for something even worse than Trump.
You have to look at the pattern here Rocky.  People like Biden, both Clintons, Kerry whose sole purpose in life is allowing corporatist to prevent populist on left to rise are the sole reason of the other party going to extreme right, fascism.  There is no counterbalance.

We have the human and industrial capital in the so-called "Rust Belt" to challenge - if not overtake! - China as the prime producer of renewable energy in the world. The Biden/Harris administration /must/ make that a key plank in its platform for the rest of this decade.
How does Joe Biden know that?!?! He doesn't even remember his own name... Stop making falsified claims you can't back up. #Trump2020 If you have even a single brain cell remaining you will vote for the RIGHT choice. Trump for another 4!!!

She doesn't remember much of Biden but very clear on Comey memories. These hearings have become such a joke. It's been 3 years!
You have mistaken this with the Democrats and the MSM.  They will do ANYTHING to win the elections. President Trump has behind him the silent majority.  Biden has behind him the violent, screaming minority.  That's the difference. President Trump will be reelected.
seriously, i really fucked with him heavy but then he let us all down by supporting biden
Having Biden and kamala harris on the democratic ticket is the biggest middle finger to progressive criminal and prison reform
I'm riding with Biden until the end.  Period.
I‚Äôm not sure if Biden will beat Trump, Kamala Harris is definitely a fucking cop, and Pence is going to get fucking WORKED during those debates with her. If he wasn‚Äôt such a ghoul I‚Äôd kinda feel bad for him but watching that bastard get dog walked is gonna rule.
Poor guy,  he doesn't know how to speak and he always sound like the first speech he ever gave.  I know Biden has his issues, but at least he's not self-centered like Trump is.
Who has confidence in Biden? He can't even remember Obama's name.
I mean with Kamala as VP, she is essentially the president due to Biden's mental deterioration. Considering she's pro slavery and anti pot, are you sure?
They will as long as Biden listens and obeys
Woman get shit done.   So so happy and hopeful.    Biden/Harris.   Yes.
biden &amp; harris?? i already wasn‚Äôt voting but that just makes it much easier lol

You are going to try to paint her as  radical left but the Democratic ticket of Biden and Harris is clear indication that the party has rejected it, so good luck with that.

Biden is handing Trump the election. The Democratic Party should be sick for letting these two be the ones running
Let's get our 2020 election on, folks! Biden Harris for the win!
It is great for the President, but horrible for Joe Biden.  Kamala Harris is very unlikable, vicious person.
There is no better Democrat to be manipulated than Joe Biden! That's why he is the ideal candidate for the left mob who wants the revolution (read: pathological destruction of the Country). Joe Biden is just a puppet for the left mob and MSM (the same).
If Biden selects Kamala Harris he will be toast. Very vulnerable VP pick
Have you heard the guy that predicted the winner for president since 1984 correctly even Trump in 2016 said Biden will win in 2020. God save us!
Hahahahahahahahahahahaha... That's the normal mistakes all the people make sometimes.  Biden is totally lost and he needs to be guided by his staff (the left mob) all the time.  Huge difference!
I love how the Biden campaign view the VP selection as the ‚Äúleast risky‚Äù and not helpful or advantageous

Joe Biden is dumber than a bag of doughnuts how do you guys not see it. He can‚Äôt even talk properly.. flubs his words all the time and loses my interest immediately
People are brainwashed to think nothing can be worse than trump. Even if trump is as bad as some people think, Biden is inherently worse.
Dear biden supporters. Your candidate is incompetent.
Joe Biden says if you vote for trump you ain't black. Joe also says if your white you are racist? Hes white therefore racist. Also blacks are not diverse compared to latinos.
We were talking about Trump but sure let‚Äôs bring up Biden since y‚Äôall know Trump is awful. No the 1994 bill was awful and unlike Trump supporters we accept what Biden has done wrong. Want to talk about the Obama administration and it‚Äôs accomplishments.
She's looking for cover for either voting for Trump again or for not voting for Biden, but for someone else.
Did you see who Biden brought along with him?  Who elected him?  Let's have a bigger tent than the Republicans do so that when we make them irrelevant, we will have the philosophical diversity in the Democratic Party necessary to consider all perspectives while they govern.
Nope. False. If Trump wins, everybody loses except his supporters. If Biden wins, not everybody automatically wins, but at least people of color like me have a shot.

Joe Biden is a disaster candidate for the Democrats! He is a quarter of Joe Biden from ten, twenty years ago! Joe Biden belongs to the nursing home not to the White House! And that's sad but true.  That's impossible that more than half country is blind and will vote for him.
The democrats are in trouble with Joe Biden leading the ticket. They selected poorly
Biden will not be the Democratic Socialist Party candidate for the election. He‚Äôs deteriorating more quickly than they thought.
If the Dems sweep, Federal taxes will go way up. Biden already promised it. Your money is going to be used to bail out the  Dem cities and states whose economies have been destroyed by Dems.Biden can‚Äôt even spell UAE.
I have no love 4 Trump but I am not against him either. I believe he has done everything he can 4 this country while being blocked at every turn by the Dems but I don't think he should b re-elected either. I don't think Biden should b elected either. The Best choice imo was Yang

I will say that. That is something I like about Trump. He may not always make the right decisions, but he sticks to what he believes. He is not easily manipulated. To be quite honest, if Biden wins, I think it will be Kamala running the show. I would rather someone who knows

You need to pressure the Biden campaign to appeal to the center and left. It‚Äôs on you if he doesn‚Äôt like Hillary didn‚Äôt. Biden will give us Trump again because of his refusal to unite the party.
Hillary &amp; Kerry said the same thing instead of trying to unite the party. That turned out great for their campaigns. If Biden was that worried he‚Äôd make serious policy concessions, like at least 1 of the lefts platform policy‚Äôs into his campaign.

It‚Äôs on Biden to win the left. I have a third option of not voting or Howie Hawkins. Biden‚Äôs repeating the Hillary 16 campaign and isn‚Äôt going to even offer policy to the left to unite with him.
Doesn't matter who Biden picked. Trump will win in a landslide.
Racist PoS Donald Trump has less idea about what policies Joe Biden will or will not implement than he does about what colors human skin can achieve naturally.....
The GOP will become very concerned about this when Joe Biden is inaugurated.
It will also feel good when you are sworn in as part of the Biden administration.
Y‚Äôall really happy about Kamala Harris as Biden‚Äôs VP...? üßê
We saw 23 million fracking jobs created under the Obama &amp; Biden administration. We‚Äôve seen 4 million of those jobs lost under the Trump administration.
If I lived in Arizona I would vote for the Democratic candidate but I will vote for my congresswoman Underwood so I will vote. Biden was my fourth choice. He is not a fan of the middle class
Im from Illinois so my vote won‚Äôt make much of a difference. Illinois will go more than 60% for Biden. Biden has played the popular side of politics.  He was against bussing until it was popular. Biden was Obama‚Äôs vice to appease the white southern voters.
I agree with this but also struggle. Many of Trump and Biden's policies are both life and death where a Green party candidate has actual plans to fix. This is a shit time for everyone
How Kamala Harris outflanked her skeptics to become Biden‚Äôs VP pick  via
How long til after Biden gets elected he resigns due to some medical condition? Place your bets now :P
So, not an African American female as promised?  Another Joe Biden lie.
She is the biggest cop in California, she failed to prosecute Steve mnuchin, and she was arresting parents and their children for truancy. You couldn‚Äôt have made a worse choice Biden. Kamala Harris doesn‚Äôt fight for the working class and neither do you.
The ticket is really: Biden, Harris and the Constitition
Vote for Biden, Harris and the Constitution
Actually, isn't the ticket really: Biden, Harris and the Constitution ?
The Constitution is on the ballot. The democratic ticket is Biden, Harris and the Constitution
I had no hopes in Biden, but will vote for him for his VP pick  #KamalaHarris

Kamala Harris Is Biden's VP Pick -- Here's What It Means For The Election And Beyond
Yep If elected Harris would be president within one year due to Biden dementia issue
If you see me liking any moderate Democrat posts it‚Äôs because my leftist ass is trying to deal with the fact that Biden/Harris are our only hope üòî
Kamala Harris is the perfect embodiment of America; she is American, Black, Asian, Indian, and she is a woman. She is so strong that the present man and his cronies in the white house fear her. By her selection as the VP pick, Joe Biden has proved America will rise from her shame
LOL you're only making some of your racist base go vote for Biden instead with this ad!! üòÜüòÜüòÜ
No vote for Trump is a vote for Biden!
I have an aunt who lives in Hockessin, Delaware and every time I've seen my cousin he's like "I've been on Biden's property."  Yeah, honey, I've done my share of trespassing too.
This is really more of a Delaware joke than a Biden joke.
Kind of want to have an election night party.   "For Kamala we have Jamaican jerk chicken and Indian tikka masala. And for Biden, to represent Delaware we have...um...scrapple?"
Okay, but I'm excited to see who Biden picks for his Cabinet!
Again her entire record is testimony to her being a conservative. I‚Äôm not even sure why you‚Äôre not embracing that. Biden‚Äôs trying to love the party to pack right leaning voters. Harris will distance him from the idea he picked a progressive, leftist, communist.
I really want to go all in w/excitement for Biden/Harris but after 2016, I‚Äôm afraid to get my hopes up. I was soooo crushed. I don‚Äôt know if I can take that again. Especially this time. #VotingBlue
Hence these are called the swing states . Went to trump in ‚Äò16.Most likely will be the same this time around . AZ needs to be blue for Biden to win , was Red by a margin last time . Educated states like NY, CA, WA, IL all are blue.
Joe Biden when it‚Äôs time to draw the clock
I think a lot the problem with politics is Republicans think Joe Biden and Kamala Harris are the radical left, and the actual left thinks Joe Biden and Kamala Harris are Republicans.

Biden rejecting party unity will do more to elect trump than anything of the left. I‚Äôm not even a leftist, I‚Äôm a centrist.
Most people understand what his schtick is now. He lies. About everything; in however it will help him in the moment. I personally know many R‚Äôs that voted for him but will not again.They‚Äôre voting for Biden.They want to reboot their party, but for now we fight together.
Agreed with all you said!!! Probably waaaay more excited about her as VP than Biden as P!!
I highly doubt this.  Biden insists he‚Äôs coming after your guns.
When Trump debates Biden.  Game over.  Biden shredded and walking in circles like he doesn‚Äôt know where he is.
I was until my mom politely asked me to stop screaming biden/harris over and over. She is still mad about Joe biden üòÇ.
Awesome! "Joe Biden selects Senator Kamala Harris to be his vice presidential running mate"
Kamala, Congratulations on your selection as the VP candidate with Joe Biden to be the next President and Vice president of the United States. My entire family and I wish the ticket every success and hope that by the teams election on November 3, we can bring law and order.
Seriously fuck this country. It's bad enough Trump is president but the  couldnt possibly pick THE ONE PERSON THAT WOULD BEAT HIM.. so we get stuck with fucking Joe Biden and now fucking Kamila "Cop" Harris as his VP in the height of BLM  Are you fucking kidding me
Chuck Todd keeps comparing Biden/Harris to Reagan/Bush and I'm just like shut up.
She represents a total rejection of party unity by the Biden campaign.
A sign that the Biden campaign rejected party unity
Kanaka Harris was a very poor choice for a Vice President.Her time as a prosecutor proved she is someone that does what is popular instead of what‚Äôs right. Elizabeth Warren and Susan Rice were much better choices. Trump is not going to get my vote but neither will Biden.
Captain Biden: Welcome aboard the Titanic
LMFAO Joe Biden really picked the woman who accused him of being racist?  Who locked up more black people than anyone in the state of California that rivaled Jim Crow states?  Should've been without doubt that Trump would be ousted this election. Yet the Democrats are bottling it
She‚Äôs represents the Biden campaign rejecting party unity. A repeat of the Hillary 2016 campaign.
Joe Biden has chosen Kamala Harris, the prominent senator from California whose political career has included many barrier-breaking moments, as his running mate, his campaign announced on Tuesday.#KamalaHarrisForVP #montysaiyed
Pretty much sums it up. The Biden campaign adopting the Hillary 2016 campaign of rejecting party unity with the VP pick. Such a shame. Biden and the conservatives just handed Trump the 2020 election.
A total waste. Why did the Biden campaign reject party unity? This is a repeat of Hillary picking Tim Kaine in 2016.
Biden picks Kamala Harris as VP nominee
A total rejection of party unity by thr Biden campaign. This is a repeat of 2016.
Biden is repeating the Hillary 2016 campaign when the candidate Hillary rejected party unity by picking a life long conservative Tim Kaine.
Biden not my 1st Choice for President. Harris not my 1st choice for VP. But I trust both to fight for ALL people and to bring much needed change in regards to many facets of American life. Time to step up and make it America the Beautiful again!! #BidenHarris2020
Biden rejected unity...that‚Äôs why he picked a conservative cop.
Pamela Harris gets the nod from Biden. I wrote white papers for Biden when he worked for Obama
Biden and Harris.  Vote Blue!!
If Biden wins we can all pretend things are hunky-dory.
It looks like Joe Biden has chosen his co-loser.   Who will lose the election with him? We're waiting with bated breath... &lt;yawn&gt;

Perhaps you can tell me, how to say this in Chinese?  Hunter Biden made 411 trips to 29 foreign countries in the 1st 5 yrs of Joe's VP.  Five of those trips were to China, none were to Ukraine, where Hunter gets 1m a yr from Bursima energy?  A job, he never has to visit?
Not so sure I‚Äôm into the clone thing. If they can clone, why not clone Biden with a healthy brain
If Biden picks a woman and if trump wants to save his daughter for his 3rd term as president, he could pick Sarah Palin to be his VP pick
Trump claims "some say" that men are offended by Biden choosing a woman as his VP.  It's true, what we need is more men in politics.  "Some say" our president is out of his damn mind.
Well we can't compare Biden's VP campaign pick to trump's VP because Sarah Palin is so much smarter than him
I'm sure trump had his speech writers make up a whole assortment of new nasty nicknames for each possible pick to be Biden's VP
I have a feeling that Barr will charge, indite and arrest Obama, Biden, Rice and others on trumped-up charges as an October surprise. What are your thoughts?
To me, the Biden and Trump ads were pathetic.  The Schumer/Abrams ads are downright creepy.
thank you joe biden shit i mean donald trump sorry wrong person
It will take a while before trump attacks Biden's VP pick. They have to find the right file in their dirt pile. I say 12 seconds
We may have to wait until Biden is in office before their is any serious effort to do what other countries have been doing to contain the virus
Biden will be 82 at the end of his term. I think he can make it. 2? Maybe not.
Russia, same as the Chinese Communist Party, supports Biden. Between that and mail fraud, you people are looking at some massively serious jail time. And I thought you HATED orange!
Just think. We're days away from somebody superimposing Biden's running mate in the WAP video.  Please, quit while you're ahead.
Should we look critically at the choices and their records? Of course. We should hold them to a high standard (something Biden is aware of I'm sure). But I see a lot of preemptive what feels like character assassination from the left as well as the right.
He called her a nasty woman. He said she should be in jail. They insinuated she was a pedophile. We are not prepared for the kinds of attacks that will be endured by Biden's running mate.
Time for a hot take:  If (god forbid) Biden loses, it won't be bc of his running mate.  Each contender has their pros and cons but let's be honest, she won't be in an enviable position. She'll face an onslaught of sexist criticism unseen before in American electoral politics.
You're comparing that history lesson with Biden or Bush W. ?
I'd vote for Biden if he picked Charles Manson.
The only thing Biden is picking is his left nostril.  He will be assigned a running/limping mate.
Nightmare would be Biden!!! At least Trump is against vaccines and the new world order that some assholes think it‚Äôs a good idea!!

This is why your arguments about not voting for Biden or against the GOP as a whole are so hollow ultimately. You aren‚Äôt going to save any lives with the GOP in power, born, unborn, or otherwise. Why support the cult?
I almost like Rice in a number of ways, she is a genius,  but she is also too close to Biden's expertise .
April 14th sorry not sorry podcast  they quote Biden saying ‚Äú this callous decision....‚Äù which he tweeted on April 1 on Biden twitter account.    So recorded between April 1 and April 14.
Vote Biden and no worry about SS.  He‚Äôll get $3 trillion for ya!  Trump won‚Äôt let Social Security go. He‚Äôs to smart for that.  He‚Äôll just change the way it‚Äôs funded.
I know my son who lost his job appreciates the $400.  We can fund social security by getting rid of some of the washington wreckless spending.  But hey,  if Biden‚Äôs elected, no worries.  He‚Äôs raising taxes $3 TRILLION.

Don‚Äôt mock Biden dude.
Definitely not, 6% of black people said they will vote for trump. 80% will vote for Biden. The republicans are hoping Kanye takes votes away from BidenJoe Biden is a good and decent man &amp; has many other qualities needed in a POTUS. trump is everything we never want to see again in a POTUS.

Uhmmmm no Kanye. Joe Biden should not be take seriously and claud Anderson probably taking financial advice from Trump
This still does not solve the fact some states do not count the absentee ballots until the next day and allow votes to trickle in.  If he goes to bed thinking he won bc fox tells him he did, yet the actaul vote is Biden due to absentee, he will not accept it. YOU KNOW THIS.
honestly i just think biden andvtrump are crazy

So is the left wing going to sit it out or write-in Bernie or Warren just to ensure Biden Harris don‚Äôt win and prove a point?  Progressives stand a better chance in 2024 then if tRump is re-elected bcz more rt-wing policies / judges will be in place.  Better to work with Dem

It's not like you made some great assumption or inferred something. The words came straight from Biden's mouth. He is not being unclear about his intentions.

Harris talking about Biden's deceased son is kinda hard to watch
Joe Biden's VP pick of Kamala Harris is all about Obama's legacy &amp; less about beating Trump. What it ignores, Harris is not liked by young black voters &amp; MOST Latino voters.    Why is this an issue? Latinos are the largest minority voting group in America.

You aren't the base. You were never the base. You're a shit stirring interloper who works for losers.  You have a choice in November. Trump or Biden. If you can't figure that out then as far as I'm concerned you're fully behind Trump and are an enemy to progressives everywhere.

someone came less than 24 hours after they announced the vp and wanted a biden harris sign   i love the enthusiasm
I agree.  VP Biden does not need the debates.   Demand he released his taxes,  an on site fact checker,  &amp; if he interrupts,  he loses his response time.

It should be clear to all that this country is beyond repair and will need to be rebuilt from the ashes.. A Biden presidency is simply delaying the inevitable.. I know that‚Äôs a tough pill to swallow.. but hey.

You should be in that Biden spot.  You should be our next President, but I guess I will just have to look forward to 2028.
Stop saying she's progressive. Hillary tried to pull that shit and we destroyed her argument and exposed her for the filthy Neolib she is. Kamala is a Hillary clone and is as neoliberal as they come. Joe Biden is worse. He is a Conservative Dem. Progressives are Dem Socialists.

Don't tell me I'm being a dick after you say I'm being dense. If you can accept Biden for as flawed and awful a candidate as he is then you shouldn't have any issues with Kamala.
I would like to believe he is smiling down at Biden/Harris.

Biden/Harris over here serving that election erection.
I don‚Äôt think they gain any votes on the ticket with this move The kids that hear ‚Äúfree college‚Äù were already going to vote for Biden, and this move doesn‚Äôt do anything to gain the middle aged that actually understand what it takes to give free college, and Kamala doesn‚Äôt do that
Obama / Biden were in office for 8 years, and your organization continued to make it possible for disturbed teen-agers and abusive men to get guns and shoot innocent people.

Biden choosing Kamala for VP means two things: 1. He‚Äôs targeting the woman vote b/c he knows the rape allegations against him will soon come to fruition.  2. He‚Äôs targeting minority vote because he‚Äôs a liberal &amp; CAREER liberals take marginalized communities &amp; further marginalize.

Harris,¬†a 55-year-old first-term senator, will be the first Black woman to compete on a major party's presidential ticket.
UPDATE: Joe Biden has decided on his running mate: Sen. Kamala Harris.
Biden/Harris... lets gooooooooo
Joe Biden's Vice President will be Kamala Harris not Susan Rice. Here's how I responded.
Democrats close to the campaign say an announcement is imminent, and could come as early as Tuesday.
Monday: Biden is not Trump Tuesday: Biden is not Trump Wednesday: Biden is not Trump Thursday: Joe Biden is not Trump, oh, I'm Joe Biden, ice cream   "Best convention ever"
It is NOT The vice presidential nominee will be speaking right before Barack Obama. Who has the best relationship with Barack Obama and Joe Biden because she worked with them in the Obama White House, Susan Rice.
Val is not a person friend of Obama and Biden's Rice is. She was always a top two pick.
Wrong! They would never leave Susan Rice off. She is a HUGE friend of Obama and Biden. This is the schedule and Rice is the VP.
If Kamala Harris was a VP she would not be speaking twice. I don't see Susan Rice there.   It's obvious she's Biden's pick. Sorry KHive your Queen will never be VP or President
OVER MY DEAD BODY!   I'm only voting for Biden to get rid of Trump.  Biden and his VP will be defeated by a progressive in 2024. Biden better focking not all of a sudden be declared incompetent in middle of his term. If he is, they knew about it before and it was a cover up.
How about we say we disagree with her policies and would never vote for her or Biden if it wasn't for the fact Trump is so dangerous.
He's covering for her. She'll be mad if he doesn't pick her and KHive will be Swarming and ready to mass sting anyone who comments that Biden made the right choice not picking her.
Are you insane? They are the only reason I'm still on Twitter. Silence them and I won't vote for Joe Biden.
Laughable... how convenient to say that when Biden has lost his marbles
Pandering is Biden‚Äôs mantra...
Joe Biden's campaign seems to be going well
Go riden with Biden!
Donald Fucking Trump, I will be glad when you are dead and gone! You are a worthless piece of shit! Joe Biden is going to kick your worthless ass!!!!  You are a sorry excuse for a human being!!!!!   When you die I will piss on your grave, maybe shit on your tombstoneüòÇüòÖü§£üï∑‚ò†Ô∏èüíÄ

Biden: Biggest. Idiot. Democrats. Ever. Nominated.
Hillary was a dumpster fire. Biden‚Äôs better but my post was more or less saying that Polls don‚Äôt matter. At all really. It‚Äôs happened before and overconfidence is a dangerous game.

It has come to my attention that the Biden campaign is using the slogan ‚ÄúBuild Back Better.‚Äù As a person who over-relies on alliteration in my own article titles, I generally like it, but I feel sad that they didn‚Äôt use what I consider to be his signature word: Malarkey.
Do you want to know what Biden stands for?? Biggest. Idiot. Democrats. Ever. Nominated.

I just about had enough of the DNC. Can't wait to keep on destroying them by helping to fund progressive primary challenges of Neolib incumbents.   Special note: My anger doesn't mean I won't vote for Dementia Joe Biden because Trump is an insane maniac that needs to be in prison
Yes he needs help not social media posts calling him a con man. Just another reason why I can't stand resistors.  Just a bunch of freaking Biden bullies.
Trump obviously doesn't want to get elected. He just garrenteed that Biden will win. My Social Security benefits in eight years mean everything to me and I'm Ready to fight a Civil War to keep it and have it increased.
Don't use voter shaming on me.  I don't believe in 3rd parties in GE. I would never criticize your right to vote 4 them.  Who said I was voting for Trump or Biden? It is perfectly acceptable to refuse to vote for either of them. In Iowa u can mark on ballot a no vote for POTUS.
I vote the way I want, you vote yours. I either vote for Biden, Trump or refuse to pick and log a no vote for President. Option 3 is a protest vote.  I don't support 3rd party runs for President. Nothing or no one can EVER make me do that.
It‚Äôs insane that Biden‚Äôs bike ride excited me. The simplicity of every second of it spoke volumes.
Harris is using the opposition research she gathered. She is a very evil woman. I will never vote for Biden if he picks her. I don't like eat-mongering Susan Rice, but she's better than Kamala.   Karen Bass is the best and safest choice.
Thats why I said alone, sadly. We are not getting a much more selfless candidate like a Bernie, and we may never in this country. But I will take Biden over that orange slime any day.
And did you also see that Instagram, owned by FB, was suppressing suppressing negative Trump hashtags but not Biden ones. None of it is accidental.
Rates have nothing to do with the ACA. Republicans refuse to cap premiums.   Trump cannot get rid of the ACA and then Rename it as Trumpcare. He is such a total insecure loser.  FYI - I'm not a fan of Barack Obama, Joe Biden or any Repub or Dem. I don't like either party.
Joe Biden should pick Lori Lightfoot as his VP so she can just yell at us and shame us into making better decisions.

Joe Biden's dangerous liberal agenda would upset god and bring a plague upon the earth. And you are helping it CNN so shame on you.
That's exactly why I am not watching that crap. I have no desire to see Kamala Harris and Elizabeth Warren or even Joe Biden and his VP speak.   I don't give a fock about the convention.
Yes I agree, but how can we convince people to get out and vote? Russia is working on tRump‚Äôs behalf by denigrating Biden and sowing seeds of doubt about the election.
It will be Susan Rice who has a really good working relationship with Joe. Kamala Harris attacked Biden. She's too ambitious And will try to overshadow Joe, which won't be hard. Harris would be willing declare Joe incompetent just to be president. #NeverKamala
When Joe Biden loses in a landside and the Black vote for Trump is 90%, I wonder what their excuse will be

just because biden says he will DOESNT MEAN HE'LL DO IT
Obama fucked up by not endorsing AOC. I don't think I can vote for Biden now. I am totally over these neo-lib corporate class Democrats.

Aw crap. I didn't even know this was possible. If Biden stops talking in public, he's going to get elected, and then we're screwed. I'll miss God and the Bible. And guns... wait, does this count airsoft?
I will hold my nose and vote for Joe Biden as long as his VP isn't Kamala Harris or Elizabeth Warren. I don't care what anyone thinks of me because of my refusal to vote for Biden if he picks either of those two women.

Oh trust me... I have never said any candidate is non flawed!! But if any other politician had said what Biden has over the last few days .. it would be headlines ... but it‚Äôs crickets
Oh and I am sure that Biden personally wrote the tweet or even told someone what to write!! Really? You heard this interview didn‚Äôt you? You heard his tone ? And how he spoke to the reporter ? We have a President who speaks for himself and owns it!! #CheckItOut
Ummmm you actually believe that Biden copped to this ??? Now that‚Äôs funny!! And because you believe it... you are part the problem!! SMH

He's the best the Dems could nominate in order to secure the Black vote.

Well, you come out of the gate lying!! Donald Trump has done more for this country in his 3.5 years than the 3 previous Presidents combined. You are a fool's fool who knows nothing, ZIP, about how an economy runs and Biden knows less than you! Shameful!
I only know that YOU, trump, have done nothing for anyone but yourself and your rich friends, so don't tell me what Biden is going to do. He is a decent man. Can you say that about yourself?

If you think joe Biden getting a hold of an executive office is gonna lead to a Marxist revolution I‚Äôm really sorry. Nothing will change, Democrats don‚Äôt want it to.

the u.s. has had an average of 9 cases of ebola since 1900, her speech doesn't even make sense. obama made the health care crisis worse with obama care, not better. this same circumstance would have happened under an obama/biden presidency
Does this mean those "scared housewives" will be more likely to vote Biden/Harris ???
Doesn't matter who Biden picked. Trump will win in a landslide.
Joe Biden thinks you can throw Kamala  out there

The GOP will become very concerned about this when Joe Biden is inaugurated.
It will also feel good when you are sworn in as part of the Biden administration.

I guess the lesson is that Biden is not a narcissistic psychopath like Trump. He doesn't believe he has all of the answers to every question.

Actually, Bill, that choice for VP actually hurts Biden and the Democrats. This is a woman who called Biden a sexist and racist and now they‚Äôre supposed to run together? Seriously? Do you think Harris is ready to run the country? I don‚Äôt. But that‚Äôs what will happen.
biden and obama expanded ice to the problem that it is today. biden and harris will expand policing. all we have representation for here is more systemic racism and control of capital by the wealthy elite. that's not my kinda leadership or representation, it's just more fascism

Should we look critically at the choices and their records? Of course. We should hold them to a high standard (something Biden is aware of I'm sure). But I see a lot of preemptive what feels like character assassination from the left as well as the right.
He called her a nasty woman. He said she should be in jail. They insinuated she was a pedophile. We are not prepared for the kinds of attacks that will be endured by Biden's running mate.
Time for a hot take:  If (god forbid) Biden loses, it won't be bc of his running mate.  Each contender has their pros and cons but let's be honest, she won't be in an enviable position. She'll face an onslaught of sexist criticism unseen before in American electoral politics.

Biden said: "wearing a mask isn't about your rights it's about your responsibility."  Says it all....Biden doesn't care about our rights. Mandating masks nationwide. This guy is a disaster. We will have no economy left. #DementiaJoe #hidinbiden
Scott, civil public discussion is a thing of the past.  If you are a vocal Trump supporter, you are a Nazi.  If you are a vocal  Biden supporter, you want to ‚Äúgive away the country.‚Äù  There‚Äôs no discussion, just denigration.
I think she's referring to Biden looking very old and fragile lately. Maybe they should let him out of the basement.ü§î Elderly decline pretty fast without stimulation.
The Biden/Harris event yesterday was so low energy and boring. The so called "crowd" was as big of a joke as Joe and Kamalas matching suits and masks. #SleepyJoe #HeelsUpHarris

Harris will destroy this country if Biden wins. It is bad enough that incompetant Biden might win

Can‚Äôt wait. Hope someone kept a master list so Biden can start his executive orders on Day 1
You have him confused with Biden
See even if trump loses he wins because ppl despise him so much they will vote him out only to vote in a passive-aggressive form trump which is what joe Biden is

Wow!! What is this? A phone!?! Biden hides in his basement because they don‚Äôt want you to know it‚Äôs really a memory care unit.
I'm not afraid to say that Kamala Harris is a bitch.  She has her personal goals to achieve and nothing or nobody else matters for her. She doesn't care about Biden at all! She sniffs a chance for her! The left mob will love her. But this is not enough to help to win for Biden.
Biden said the China travel ban was racist and Nancy told us to go have dinner in China town.  How soon we conveniently forget.
This is greatüéâ probably not far from the truth with the upcoming debate. We can only hope Biden comes locked in his TV!
Trump completely screwed up a thriving economy Obama/Biden created. Trump had a guideline for battling any new virus and discarded it well in advance of the Trump Corona Virus.
Not worse than Biden who doesn‚Äôt know the state he‚Äôs in isn‚Äôt a city and the office he‚Äôs running for isn‚Äôt the Senate. As well as letting the party hide him in the basement for fear of what he‚Äôll say üòÇ
I‚Äôm grateful for the Biden/Harris ticket. Not ready to get too excited b/c after 2016, I‚Äôm realistic. A lot of BS is going to happen between now &amp; then &amp; I refuse to take anything for granted. I will vote, my husband will vote and my children will vote. BLUE!
I don't think so  - do VP picks really mean that much to people? Not enough to sway anyone to vote or not vote for one of the two illustrious choices we have for POTUS. I would think if anything, Ms. Harris brings some respectability to the Biden ticket.
Pelosi is an old person just like biden. Time for both to go out to pastures
Dream on, Don. Your actual opponent is Joe Biden. Pay attention.
I will vote for all the other people I want. I won‚Äôt vote for anyone but I have that option in Illinois. Biden will win Illinois  Jill Stein was a Russian operative to bleed votes from Clinton just as Kanye West is doing now to get black vote
You need to pressure the Biden campaign to appeal to the center and left. It‚Äôs on you if he doesn‚Äôt like Hillary didn‚Äôt. Biden will give us Trump again because of his refusal to unite the party.
Hillary &amp; Kerry said the same thing instead of trying to unite the party. That turned out great for their campaigns. If Biden was that worried he‚Äôd make serious policy concessions, like at least 1 of the lefts platform policy‚Äôs into his campaign.
Uh............DUH!!!  That's why we're voting for Biden!!  #BlueTsunami
It‚Äôs on Biden to win the left. I have a third option of not voting or Howie Hawkins. Biden‚Äôs repeating the Hillary 16 campaign and isn‚Äôt going to even offer policy to the left to unite with him.
Idk if it's PBS or the DNC but whoever is doing the pre-speech music for this biden/harris ordeal is slaying.

It says so much about our beautiful country that a major party ticket now includes a Black and South Asian American woman. Congratulations, Kamala #MVP
Racist PoS Donald Trump has less idea about what policies Joe Biden will or will not implement than he does about what colors human skin can achieve naturally.....
Y‚Äôall really happy about Kamala Harris as Biden‚Äôs VP...? üßê
We saw 23 million fracking jobs created under the Obama &amp; Biden administration. We‚Äôve seen 4 million of those jobs lost under the Trump administration.
If I lived in Arizona I would vote for the Democratic candidate but I will vote for my congresswoman Underwood so I will vote. Biden was my fourth choice. He is not a fan of the middle class
Im from Illinois so my vote won‚Äôt make much of a difference. Illinois will go more than 60% for Biden. Biden has played the popular side of politics.  He was against bussing until it was popular. Biden was Obama‚Äôs vice to appease the white southern voters.
Oh FFS, can we at least agree that the liklihood of Biden/Harris continuing to dismantle the post office, ignore experts on disease, collude to make Russia a super power again, and continue to try to take away health care is minimal? Comparatively?
How Kamala Harris outflanked her skeptics to become Biden‚Äôs VP pick  via
It's funny how hypocritical Trump is calling Joe Biden "sleepy Joe" when Mike Pence constantly  sleeps on the job, Kamala Harris is gonna make him her bitch in their debate.
So, not an African American female as promised?  Another Joe Biden lie.
She is the biggest cop in California, she failed to prosecute Steve mnuchin, and she was arresting parents and their children for truancy. You couldn‚Äôt have made a worse choice Biden. Kamala Harris doesn‚Äôt fight for the working class and neither do you.

Kamala Harris is the perfect embodiment of America; she is American, Black, Asian, Indian, and she is a woman. She is so strong that the present man and his cronies in the white house fear her. By her selection as the VP pick, Joe Biden has proved America will rise from her shame
No vote for Trump is a vote for Biden!
Again her entire record is testimony to her being a conservative. I‚Äôm not even sure why you‚Äôre not embracing that. Biden‚Äôs trying to love the party to pack right leaning voters. Harris will distance him from the idea he picked a progressive, leftist, communist.
You have mistaken this with the Democrats and the MSM.  They will do ANYTHING to win the elections. President Trump has behind him the silent majority.  Biden has behind him the violent, screaming minority.  That's the difference. President Trump will be reelected.
I really want to go all in w/excitement for Biden/Harris but after 2016, I‚Äôm afraid to get my hopes up. I was soooo crushed. I don‚Äôt know if I can take that again. Especially this time. #VotingBlue
Hence these are called the swing states . Went to trump in ‚Äò16.Most likely will be the same this time around . AZ needs to be blue for Biden to win , was Red by a margin last time . Educated states like NY, CA, WA, IL all are blue.

Agreed with all you said!!! Probably waaaay more excited about her as VP than Biden as P!!
I highly doubt this.  Biden insists he‚Äôs coming after your guns.

Kamala, Congratulations on your selection as the VP candidate with Joe Biden to be the next President and Vice president of the United States. My entire family and I wish the ticket every success and hope that by the teams election on November 3, we can bring law and order.
I just heard that Dr Jill Biden not happy with VP pick. Sounds like it wasn't #DementiaJoe's call. If he is qualified to be President, why wasn't he allowed to pick his own running mate.
Seriously fuck this country. It's bad enough Trump is president but the  couldnt possibly pick THE ONE PERSON THAT WOULD BEAT HIM.. so we get stuck with fucking Joe Biden and now fucking Kamila "Cop" Harris as his VP in the height of BLM  Are you fucking kidding me
Not a fan of her, but then, I am not fan of Biden. That being said, I am voting Blue, no matter what. The stakes are way too high.
She represents a total rejection of party unity by the Biden campaign.
A sign that the Biden campaign rejected party unity
Kanaka Harris was a very poor choice for a Vice President.Her time as a prosecutor proved she is someone that does what is popular instead of what‚Äôs right. Elizabeth Warren and Susan Rice were much better choices. Trump is not going to get my vote but neither will Biden.
She‚Äôs represents the Biden campaign rejecting party unity. A repeat of the Hillary 2016 campaign.
Joe Biden has chosen Kamala Harris, the prominent senator from California whose political career has included many barrier-breaking moments, as his running mate, his campaign announced on Tuesday.#KamalaHarrisForVP #montysaiyed
Pretty much sums it up. The Biden campaign adopting the Hillary 2016 campaign of rejecting party unity with the VP pick. Such a shame. Biden and the conservatives just handed Trump the 2020 election.
A total waste. Why did the Biden campaign reject party unity? This is a repeat of Hillary picking Tim Kaine in 2016.
Biden picks Kamala Harris as VP nominee
A total rejection of party unity by thr Biden campaign. This is a repeat of 2016.

It is great for the President, but horrible for Joe Biden.  Kamala Harris is very unlikable, vicious person.
Biden rejected unity...that‚Äôs why he picked a conservative cop.
Pamela Harris gets the nod from Biden. I wrote white papers for Biden when he worked for Obama
There is no better Democrat to be manipulated than Joe Biden! That's why he is the ideal candidate for the left mob who wants the revolution (read: pathological destruction of the Country). Joe Biden is just a puppet for the left mob and MSM (the same).

Watching Tom Steyer on Fox - total buffoon! He doesn't think Joe Biden's racist remarks reflect his feelings about the black community because like today, his campaign clarified what Joe meant. How disturbing. I do not want this senile old racist to get the nuclear codes.
I think he has always been a racist but has also been able to keep it hidden. As his dementia progresses his filter is gone and the American people are getting a look at the "real" Joe Biden. #JimCrowJoe
Nope. False. If Trump wins, everybody loses except his supporters. If Biden wins, not everybody automatically wins, but at least people of color like me have a shot.

Another way to interpret Trump's response is that he believes Biden to have monumental power beyond the comprehension of mere mortals.
Arrogance and ignorance. Everything he says is a lie. He just said that Joe Biden is against God and hates the Bible.  What an idiot and a global embarrassment.  The Orange Stain is the worst ever.
Joe Biden is a disaster candidate for the Democrats! He is a quarter of Joe Biden from ten, twenty years ago! Joe Biden belongs to the nursing home not to the White House! And that's sad but true.  That's impossible that more than half country is blind and will vote for him.

Not worse than Biden who doesn‚Äôt know the state he‚Äôs in isn‚Äôt a city and the office he‚Äôs running for isn‚Äôt the Senate. As well as letting the party hide him in the basement for fear of what he‚Äôll say üòÇ
I‚Äôm grateful for the Biden/Harris ticket. Not ready to get too excited b/c after 2016, I‚Äôm realistic. A lot of BS is going to happen between now &amp; then &amp; I refuse to take anything for granted. I will vote, my husband will vote and my children will vote. BLUE!
Damn they found all 50 Biden supporters!
I don't think so  - do VP picks really mean that much to people? Not enough to sway anyone to vote or not vote for one of the two illustrious choices we have for POTUS. I would think if anything, Ms. Harris brings some respectability to the Biden ticket.
Be realistic, do you want trump? Because no one else but Biden stands a chance. And have you seen immigration nation? Those cages weren‚Äôt for children. The Obama administration wanted immigrants who were criminals out, not everyone who came here illegally. It‚Äôs trump or Biden.
Pelosi is an old person just like biden. Time for both to go out to pastures
Biden not so Creepy anymore she'll be watching üôÇüëç
Dream on, Don. Your actual opponent is Joe Biden. Pay attention.
I will vote for all the other people I want. I won‚Äôt vote for anyone but I have that option in Illinois. Biden will win Illinois  Jill Stein was a Russian operative to bleed votes from Clinton just as Kanye West is doing now to get black vote
I don't understand why this message is targeting me, I want the person to vote no matter what. However, I personally hate the pressure messaging of "vote Biden or else", even though I personally believe it myself. You're just going to turn away potential voters talking like that.
You need to pressure the Biden campaign to appeal to the center and left. It‚Äôs on you if he doesn‚Äôt like Hillary didn‚Äôt. Biden will give us Trump again because of his refusal to unite the party.
Hillary &amp; Kerry said the same thing instead of trying to unite the party. That turned out great for their campaigns. If Biden was that worried he‚Äôd make serious policy concessions, like at least 1 of the lefts platform policy‚Äôs into his campaign.
It‚Äôs between trump and Biden and they both have allegations. But at least Biden doesn‚Äôt lock up children and separate them from their families
I‚Äôve been telling people for like half a year now that the time to be complacent for any leadership is over. I‚Äôm voting Biden but I‚Äôm gonna be constantly critical of him and demanding more.
Grandpa ranty airing his grievances with name calling ..  While Biden &amp; Harris use complete sentences and tell the truth, exposing the fraud (Trump) behind the curtain!!
Next President of the United States Joe Biden and the next Vice President Kamala Harris.
Uh............DUH!!!  That's why we're voting for Biden!!  #BlueTsunami
Go play with your fidget spinner....  I‚Äôm listing to President Biden and Vice President Harris speak in complete sentences!!!
She‚Äôs NOT black.  She bashed Biden, what changed.  Oh she maybe President!! Think twice!!
Harris is the first Dem to be on the top of the ticket west of the Rocky Mountains. Biden/Harris are the first candidates in decades to have not gone to an Ivy School.
It‚Äôs on Biden to win the left. I have a third option of not voting or Howie Hawkins. Biden‚Äôs repeating the Hillary 16 campaign and isn‚Äôt going to even offer policy to the left to unite with him.
Idk if it's PBS or the DNC but whoever is doing the pre-speech music for this biden/harris ordeal is slaying.
Isn‚Äôt Biden supposed to lead on day one?
Yeah in terms of environment Trump is honestly the worst, although with the Biden's mental decline, Kamala will be the real presidential candidate and with what she has done to people and her authoritarian ideals, I don't feel like she's better than Trump.
Although Biden is further to the right than Trump, so how is that going to help the left?
It says so much about our beautiful country that a major party ticket now includes a Black and South Asian American woman. Congratulations, Kamala #MVP
I'm sorry but I have to disagree with being able to be able get much more done with Biden and Harris. They are both far more to the right than Trump and have been shown to be far more authoritarian and a genuine threat to African Americans.
Y‚Äôall really happy about Kamala Harris as Biden‚Äôs VP...? üßê
We saw 23 million fracking jobs created under the Obama &amp; Biden administration. We‚Äôve seen 4 million of those jobs lost under the Trump administration.
If I lived in Arizona I would vote for the Democratic candidate but I will vote for my congresswoman Underwood so I will vote. Biden was my fourth choice. He is not a fan of the middle class
Im from Illinois so my vote won‚Äôt make much of a difference. Illinois will go more than 60% for Biden. Biden has played the popular side of politics.  He was against bussing until it was popular. Biden was Obama‚Äôs vice to appease the white southern voters.
Oh FFS, can we at least agree that the liklihood of Biden/Harris continuing to dismantle the post office, ignore experts on disease, collude to make Russia a super power again, and continue to try to take away health care is minimal? Comparatively?
How Kamala Harris outflanked her skeptics to become Biden‚Äôs VP pick  via
It's funny how hypocritical Trump is calling Joe Biden "sleepy Joe" when Mike Pence constantly  sleeps on the job, Kamala Harris is gonna make him her bitch in their debate.
And Biden will refer to her as "the first mainstream(whatever ethnicityTrump chooses) who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice-looking broad who is fun to sniff" No ill wishes to Biden, but I hope she takes over quick.

We have the human and industrial capital in the so-called "Rust Belt" to challenge - if not overtake! - China as the prime producer of renewable energy in the world. The Biden/Harris administration /must/ make that a key plank in its platform for the rest of this decade.
How does Joe Biden know that?!?! He doesn't even remember his own name... Stop making falsified claims you can't back up. #Trump2020 If you have even a single brain cell remaining you will vote for the RIGHT choice. Trump for another 4!!!
I don‚Äôt know why it would be this time, Biden would likely pick a cabinet that‚Äôs as optimal and expert-filled as possible
How many stones do you need?  Those without sin throw the first one.  REALLY!  Biden?  Evil will always prevail!

Biden is Catholic
Good is evil and evil is good!! Crazy and people are blind.  I had a classmate say if he had Mickey Mouse running she would still vote for Biden.  So much Hate out there.  It‚Äôs a war between God and Satan.  If we know the end of the ‚ÄúBook‚Äù we know who wins. üòá
No vote for Trump is a vote for Biden!
Again her entire record is testimony to her being a conservative. I‚Äôm not even sure why you‚Äôre not embracing that. Biden‚Äôs trying to love the party to pack right leaning voters. Harris will distance him from the idea he picked a progressive, leftist, communist.
You have mistaken this with the Democrats and the MSM.  They will do ANYTHING to win the elections. President Trump has behind him the silent majority.  Biden has behind him the violent, screaming minority.  That's the difference. President Trump will be reelected.
I really want to go all in w/excitement for Biden/Harris but after 2016, I‚Äôm afraid to get my hopes up. I was soooo crushed. I don‚Äôt know if I can take that again. Especially this time. #VotingBlue
seriously, i really fucked with him heavy but then he let us all down by supporting biden

She wasn‚Äôt my top choice but I do love her as the pick!! She is the right choice! I was voting Biden no matter what, even though he isn‚Äôt my fave pick. Anything but the d√©b√¢cle we have ‚Äúrunningl the country right now!
Talk about a disaster...it‚Äôs the dumpster fire shit show we‚Äôve lived in fo thr past 3.75 years!!  So ready for Biden/Harris!!
Who has confidence in Biden? He can't even remember Obama's name.
I mean with Kamala as VP, she is essentially the president due to Biden's mental deterioration. Considering she's pro slavery and anti pot, are you sure?
They will as long as Biden listens and obeys
Obama and Biden left a pandemic plan behind in case something happened, which was then ignored when a pandemic happened. ACA isn't really to blame for this.
Biden rejecting party unity will do more to elect trump than anything of the left. I‚Äôm not even a leftist, I‚Äôm a centrist.
Most people understand what his schtick is now. He lies. About everything; in however it will help him in the moment. I personally know many R‚Äôs that voted for him but will not again.They‚Äôre voting for Biden.They want to reboot their party, but for now we fight together.
Agreed with all you said!!! Probably waaaay more excited about her as VP than Biden as P!!
I highly doubt this.  Biden insists he‚Äôs coming after your guns.
When Trump debates Biden.  Game over.  Biden shredded and walking in circles like he doesn‚Äôt know where he is.
Woman get shit done.   So so happy and hopeful.    Biden/Harris.   Yes.
#teamKamala all the way. I am glad Joe Biden is comfortable with a strong, ambitious woman by his side. Godspeed.
biden &amp; harris?? i already wasn‚Äôt voting but that just makes it much easier lol
You‚Äôre babbling and running scare!! Biden/Harris 2020
I've been saying ever since it was clear that Bernie was probably gonna lose that I would vote for Biden just because he'll at least be capable of listening to criticism and will fill his administration with experts.  We gotta just pour on the pressure even harder if Biden wins.
Nah, that's a bad take. If you're not feeling Biden then you don't HAVE to vote Biden. Heck, even Biden has said the same thing when talking about the Tara Reade allegations.   You're just alienating people who are on the fence if you say they HAVE to vote Biden.
That's fair. I generally only really push people to really consider voting Biden if they're in battleground states, since their vote might actually make a direct impact on the results.  I want 3rd parties to be a viable option but we gotta get election reform first sadly.
He did not say that he would veto M4A, here is the direct quote of his response to the question of if he'd veto M4A.  "I would veto anything that delays providing the security and the certainty of health care being available now."
Seriously fuck this country. It's bad enough Trump is president but the  couldnt possibly pick THE ONE PERSON THAT WOULD BEAT HIM.. so we get stuck with fucking Joe Biden and now fucking Kamila "Cop" Harris as his VP in the height of BLM  Are you fucking kidding me
Not a fan of her, but then, I am not fan of Biden. That being said, I am voting Blue, no matter what. The stakes are way too high.
She represents a total rejection of party unity by the Biden campaign.
A sign that the Biden campaign rejected party unity
Biden has nothing to do with either 160k+ dead or the recession, and Kamala's healthcare plan would've covered everyone and forced private healthcare to follow stricter regulation.
Of course he did, it's Trump. The man is maximum pettiness personified.  I'd vote for a moldy lemon and stale bread before I voted for Trump, and Biden/Harris at least have some real interesting history and a lot of progressive policy writers pushing the campaign along.
Kanaka Harris was a very poor choice for a Vice President.Her time as a prosecutor proved she is someone that does what is popular instead of what‚Äôs right. Elizabeth Warren and Susan Rice were much better choices. Trump is not going to get my vote but neither will Biden.
LMFAO Joe Biden really picked the woman who accused him of being racist?  Who locked up more black people than anyone in the state of California that rivaled Jim Crow states?  Should've been without doubt that Trump would be ousted this election. Yet the Democrats are bottling it
She‚Äôs represents the Biden campaign rejecting party unity. A repeat of the Hillary 2016 campaign.
Joe Biden has chosen Kamala Harris, the prominent senator from California whose political career has included many barrier-breaking moments, as his running mate, his campaign announced on Tuesday.#KamalaHarrisForVP #montysaiyed
Pretty much sums it up. The Biden campaign adopting the Hillary 2016 campaign of rejecting party unity with the VP pick. Such a shame. Biden and the conservatives just handed Trump the 2020 election.
A total waste. Why did the Biden campaign reject party unity? This is a repeat of Hillary picking Tim Kaine in 2016.
Biden picks Kamala Harris as VP nominee
A total rejection of party unity by thr Biden campaign. This is a repeat of 2016.
Warren would've been my vote in the primary had the writing not already been on the wall that she was not going to be competitive enough in the primary, so I shifted to Bernie.  If it makes you feel any better, Warren has been a *major* policy adviser for Biden in recent months.
Biden is repeating the Hillary 2016 campaign when the candidate Hillary rejected party unity by picking a life long conservative Tim Kaine.
Didn‚Äôt kamala trash Biden in the debates?
Yay! And the next president after Biden.
I don't know who he could've picked that would've pulled in more progressive and younger voters. Elizabeth Warren is amazing, but people didn't show up for her, and she's just as old as Biden is.
Biden is handing Trump the election. The Democratic Party should be sick for letting these two be the ones running
Let's get our 2020 election on, folks! Biden Harris for the win!
Biden not my 1st Choice for President. Harris not my 1st choice for VP. But I trust both to fight for ALL people and to bring much needed change in regards to many facets of American life. Time to step up and make it America the Beautiful again!! #BidenHarris2020
Kamala Harris was honestly probably my top pick for VP (her, Warren, and Susan Rice top 3), she'll be a great choice, assuming that Biden continues to work with Sanders and Warren with his policies.
She's not really polarizing, and especially neither her nor Biden are as divisive as Trump. That's a false equivalence. Listening to Harris interrogate someone is the most exciting thing out there, she's a great speaker.
It is great for the President, but horrible for Joe Biden.  Kamala Harris is very unlikable, vicious person.
I LOVE THIS!!!  BIDEN/HARRIS 2020
Biden rejected unity...that‚Äôs why he picked a conservative cop.
Pamela Harris gets the nod from Biden. I wrote white papers for Biden when he worked for Obama
Biden and Harris.  Vote Blue!!
Biden Harris LFG
There is no better Democrat to be manipulated than Joe Biden! That's why he is the ideal candidate for the left mob who wants the revolution (read: pathological destruction of the Country). Joe Biden is just a puppet for the left mob and MSM (the same).
If Biden wins we can all pretend things are hunky-dory.
It looks like Joe Biden has chosen his co-loser.   Who will lose the election with him? We're waiting with bated breath... &lt;yawn&gt;

Trump claims "some say" that men are offended by Biden choosing a woman as his VP.  It's true, what we need is more men in politics.  "Some say" our president is out of his damn mind.
Have you heard the guy that predicted the winner for president since 1984 correctly even Trump in 2016 said Biden will win in 2020. God save us!
I have a feeling that Barr will charge, indite and arrest Obama, Biden, Rice and others on trumped-up charges as an October surprise. What are your thoughts?
To me, the Biden and Trump ads were pathetic.  The Schumer/Abrams ads are downright creepy.
Hahahahahahahahahahahaha... That's the normal mistakes all the people make sometimes.  Biden is totally lost and he needs to be guided by his staff (the left mob) all the time.  Huge difference!
I love how the Biden campaign view the VP selection as the ‚Äúleast risky‚Äù and not helpful or advantageous
DC Swamp Lizards. They have sold out and probably promised much money if Biden gets in. DemocRATS in Republican clothing.
They are not much a friends of the USA so is Joe Biden! #Trump2020LetsSaveAmerica
I would say 2 and 3 are pretty close. But a friend of mine knows his Doctore Biden had a stroke and he is declining fast!
And yet unlike Trump, Biden will pick an administration and work with qualified experts because he knows that it‚Äôs not really about him as an individual at all. That‚Äôs the draw for Biden in this case, he‚Äôs very good at knowing when to seek expert opinion.
Russia, same as the Chinese Communist Party, supports Biden. Between that and mail fraud, you people are looking at some massively serious jail time. And I thought you HATED orange!
I'd vote Biden if his pick was was snoopy the dog!

Biden and Harris deserve criticism.  We also need to stop the hemorrhaging though of judicial appointments.  I'm not sure what path progressives would have after 4 more years of lifetime extremist right wing judges.

As an indisputably public figure, the bar is very high for slander/libel.  And if any of these authors are on the wrong side of it, Trump likely is to with what he has said about Obama, Biden, Pelosi and many others.  The NDA approach is really his only remaining threat.

I just don‚Äôt want to lose that California seat if Biden doesn‚Äôt choose duckworth for a cabinet position.  There needs to be a Black woman in the Senate.
He is Having to do things to save the integrity of this country after the democrats want to destroy it. They tried to remove him from office to avoid running against him and that failed, next is rigging elections to get him out. Biden? Really?
According to the chart, it appears that Biden ends up winning the popular vote by 4%. Am I correct that the final results would be Biden winning the two party vote 52 to 48?

Yes as long as the DNC sends out your monthly stipend (as thanks for ruining the economy), you should be fine.  I hear if Biden wins, we all get bonus stipends too. Between that and being a SJW crisis actor, I will be in the 1% in no time.

Actually the contention of cyber bullying was the death threats that both her and her daughter have received, the publishing of her hotel address, podcast episodes created specifically to harass her etc.

I‚Äôve seen Joe Biden outside doing things on my television more in the last four months than I‚Äôve seen you doing anything on my television the last ten years. Find a new talking point, maybe one that‚Äôs actually true next time.
Sorry, this story is dead, she has already been caught lying about her school, the bar exam and many other personal details, she was also discredited by her own friends and people who knew her, Biden was vetted heavily before he became VP, but go ahead keep beating the dead horse
Biden is literally named in a criminal investigation in Ukraine. Everyone you said applies to Biden.
Joe Biden lives here....
It's probably too late, but Biden/Harris need to make it plain that they support law enforcement officers. Do you know how many cops and families of cops there are in this country? Whoever came up with "defund" the police needs to be horsewhipped.
He should start doing press conferences with Biden and acting as if the last four years are already in the rear view mirror (like so many of us are trying to do...)

We have two choices and one is clearly better. Period. Making noise about Biden‚Äôs shortcomings does nothing but improve Trump‚Äôs chance at four more years to turn the US into an authoritarian state. So don‚Äôt share your hot takes on Biden unless you‚Äôre in favor of Trump winning.
It was literally just there.   It's cause they endorsed biden/harris. Lol that just makes it even more obvious that harris is trying to cover it up.
You lost 59% to 37% in New York in 2016 and you're losing 59% to 34% to Biden right now.   Keep on dreaming, its the only place you're actually good at your job.
Gotta vote for Biden cuz of being an ex Maga, you know Trump is a racist and arrogant liar. You want that to run your country?
Enough with the ‚ÄúTrump and Biden are the same‚Äù bullshit. Is Biden gonna end DACA? Does Biden amplify Nazi and white supremecist ideologies? Does Biden praise dictators and want to suspend elections and police the press? Has Biden gassed peaceful protestors? Is Biden a bully?
Just so it‚Äôs clear and everyone knows- I regretfully voted for Trump in 2016. I don‚Äôt know how I feel about Hillary, but seeing as I‚Äôm probably going to vote Biden in 2020, I‚Äôd probably vote for her given a redo. Btw- I live in Illinois so it really didn‚Äôt matter.
You‚Äôre really begging for a spot in Biden administration.
Do it AS SOON as you‚Äôre allowed to. Keep following Harris, Biden and other trustworthy accounts as they‚Äôll likely keep you way more informed than anyone else.
Repeated 3rd grade ? GTFOH . Republicans  will counter that trump‚Äôs higher education has been questioned, but that is only after his idiotic boasts of being an excellent student. I am sure, if asked, Biden would cop to not being the best student.
Hardcore parkour Biden Harris supporter. To get back to ‚Äònormal‚Äô.
Yeah because Biden and Truth do.
Well I would just urge you to seriously contemplate that Twitter's progressive space is very small, less than 1% of voters.   At the end of the day, Bernie will have one of the most powerful positions in a Biden era. Yes he was screwed over, but not entirely. Trump cannot win.
Well I‚Äôm glad you acknowledge that Biden is left wing.
No...he really doesn‚Äôt. In fact, the more Biden/Harris works to marginalize these voices, the more he will expand his electoral base and his legislative opportunity platform.
Wondering why Biden didn't do whay you claim in the 8 yrs in the Whitehouse or 30 yrs in Congress. Kamala ,you called Joe a racist during Debates.Were we to believe you then or now? You will truely come to know the power of God our Creator. And Great will be your fall
Yes, he'd hold that position.   That position has more power in the Senate than the vice president herself, assuming Biden and Kamala win.
Progressives now hold over 12 seats in Congress and if Joe Biden gets elected Bernie Sanders becomes the chairman of the Senate Budget committee, meaning he will have control of the purse.  He will not change his climate stance.
Vote for him and be the first republican to wear an official Biden mask where ever you go.
Third party is a vote for Trump. They complain a lot about Biden but hesitate to recommend an alternative. Like they don‚Äôt want to give away the motive yet. Feels manipulative and I have no time for that. Not interested in any third party at this time whatsoever.
What is neoliberal about Joe Biden's $2 trillion climate legislation policies?  What is neoliberal about his public healthcare option?  What is neoliberal about his college debt relief?  You're actively voting against your own interests.
Recognize that the path to truth and final decisions rately involves clearly demarcated winners and losers, right and wrong.  We all reach conclusions, with reservations. Then we travel that path and don't look back. Vote Biden/Harris with confidence,  and don't look back.

I like President a Biden best!
One person's "big structural changes" is another persons "You are ruining America".  If biden loses ?  Will the democrats go quietly ?  No fricken way.  Just like Hillary is still bitching almost 4 years later.  Dems are exactly what the same as Republicans.  BS artists
I personally feel we‚Äôre going to overcome all this corruption and although it probably will be a fight, we‚Äôll ultimately be fine and Biden will be sworn in in January. You?
every time I see someone say "I don't want to hear any more criticism of Biden or Kamala" it confirms that what they really want is the atrocities to get quieter, not go away

Carl I think you can answer this in good faith --  First time in my life I think voting Dem is fine... to remove the fascist escalation. But I worry the long game of that means complacent liberals won't oppose the proto-fascist custodian (biden) or his successor. Thoughts?
tbh I was wavering on my pledge not to vote for Biden, because it‚Äôs a safe blue state, easy to vote, and it makes it harder for people to yell at me if he loses, but ‚Äúprogressives‚Äù tripping over themselves to praise the ticket have given me the strength I need to stand firm

Biden's team will make Harris better than what she is imo.
Keep in mind, these are his own self reported numbers. I'm sure if an independent group ever studies his plan they'll come up with a number of uninsured people greater than 10 million, but even when we take Biden at his word, these numbers aren't even close to a universal system.

Biden's website states that his healthcare plan will not be universal, and will only cover 97% of Americans, leaving 10 million people uninsured.  You on the other hand are claiming that his plan is universal, so please explain how you know more about Biden's plan than he does.
This video isn't looping, Joe Biden just forgets that he's seen this trick that fast
We do need society to systemically change for things to improve. That's objective fact.  But another 4 years of Trump doesn't bring $2 trillion of climate legislation, or a public healthcare option, or college debt relief.   Unequivocally these things have a higher chance w/Biden
This is not me supporting Biden. It's me supporting the activists working tirelessly to shift the party left. Support 4 real politics.  The left position is not to support anyone. You vote against the worst.   These policies wouldn't be debated under Trump, let alone implemented.
Biden's climate positions is far superior to Trump's, and to the left of Obama by far.   $2 trillion commitment to dealing with the environmental catastrophe. It's a policy largely written by the Sunrise movement &amp; endorsed by leading climate activists -- the same pishing for GND
Biden is father to the left than any Democratic candidate in memory, especially on climate issues. Far better than anything since the 70s.  This isn't because Biden had a personal awakening. It's because activists have been beating away at him &amp; will continue to do so
So if Biden wins, I can destroy/burn all kinds of shit I ballpark disagree with, right?
Right.  Just 5 months ago the economy was strong because of Obama/Biden.  Now that it's weak it's because of Trump.  Both times they were wrong!

They will have to drag him out of the Oval Office. At the very least, he won't have the decency to show up for a Biden inauguration.
Activism can push pieces of shit like Biden and Harris to participate in more leftist politics. It will take constant pressure. But Trump winning will not result in some imagined revolution. It will just result in more dead and disenfranchised people who deserve better.

Did Biden already take credit for this?
It's been ~ 35-40 range basically forever. We're extremely polarized, and I wouldn't expect Trump support to drop below 30%. However, polarization may = stability, in the polls. Not many "undecideds" left at this point. It's not over yet, but it's looking food for Biden/Harris

wat if i told u... biden has done more to harm ppl than trump has? wat if i told u... the dem ‚Äúopposition‚Äù has worked because it‚Äôs not meant to? it‚Äôs easier to b fool ppl than it is to convince them theyve been fooled.

Democrat Harris rebukes Trump in historic campaign-trail debut with Biden
Checked my wife's registration and she was ok. So neither one of us voted since we cancelled we others vote. The idea is to trim the vote so Biden does not gain a vote.
Biden, you ain't shit! How's that?
Send me my ballot today, it‚Äôll be turned in by tomorrow.
"Pretty similar" even though the situation for Clinton in the polls was much more tenuous for Clinton than it is now for Biden. Didn‚Äôt you do a whole write up in 2012 about how people doubting Obama‚Äôs re-election were ignoring the stability of the polls w/Obama 50%+?
F**k Biden‚Äôs campaign.  If they were to treat black people right, they wouldn‚Äôt have this problem
Unlike most potential presidents, no one knows what Biden stands for. He‚Äôs the figurehead for a shaky coalition that harbors radical views, writes
And Hillary‚Äôs &lt;50% polling average even during her post-convention bounce period, general lead instability, and running for a 3rd term would imply at least to me intuitively that her win probability should be less - not greater - than Biden‚Äôs at this same point...
Interesting to note just how many people in the "I will no longer support  because I disagree with their stance on punishment for looters" camp are also firmly in the "vote for Biden/Harris even if you disagree with their stances on criminal punishment" camp.
But don‚Äôt you see the issue there? Biden should be project to do a bit better than she was projected to do, since this isn‚Äôt a post-convention bounce for him and his lead has been more stable and above 50% in the polls...
There's just no other way to say it: Kamala Harris is a thug, promoting the killing of unborn babies. She and Biden MUST NOT be elected in November. Kamala should probably even be deported. We need to stop that female supremacist bigot in her tracks!

The peace deal was a publicity stunt, Trump didnt do shit  And RBG will retire...the second Biden is sworn in. üòÇüòÇ
Hillary‚Äôs lead then was similar to Biden‚Äôs now, except that she never breached 50. The 2016 model implies that a lead like this should be getting to 80-90% probabilities (like you had for WI, MI, etc at Hillary‚Äôs high points - although this seems overconfident).
Trump and his reelection present an opportunity for key players to fulfill their dream of privatizing #USPostalService This is an opportunity to amass consensus (his base) for a scheme that otherwise 90+% of Americans would reject. This is bigger than Trump v Biden.
...now is unprecedented in the modern era. Blacks have never done WELL in the country, but if the country slides how do you not think that we'll do disproportionately worse? Biden Harris gives a chance against the pandemic and full authoritarian rule. We'll need to agitate 4 more

Biden is a southern dem.... and folks underestimated him... I'll be the first to admit I did.  Locking SC down defending the ACA is why he's nominee.   Black older voters liked the loyalty to Obama.
What is means is that she's not really a Progressive.  What it means is that she is a DINO just like Biden is and the hell with it going to vote for them anyway.
Nope all those donations went straight to Biden/Harris2020. Damn shame. Imagine if those millions actually went to the community.
Let me show you an application of the principle of charity against my interests: I think Biden was saying that while the American blacks constitute roughly one cultural group in the US, the so-called Hispanics comprise several: Puerto Rican, Cuban, Mexican, and so on.

Opinion: If Joe Biden loses, the constant backlash, griping, whining, looting, rioting and violence that we‚Äôve seen since November, 2016 will get much worse and the media will support it at every step. Especially the Washington Post and their ‚ÄúMerry Impeachmas‚Äù staff.

Strong disagree. Hillary Clinton had been subject to 25 years of right wing fear-mongering and there was a strong percentage of the electorate who just wanted to vote against her. Biden doesn't have that problem, he's a known commodity, and he's a white male. It ain't the same.

"President Trump requests mail-in ballot even as he assails voting-by-mail." Somehow, after three-plus years of this, I still find myself astonished by the brazenness and duplicity of this president... probably shouldn't be at this point.
If this were simply a war of words, I'd agree with you that it undermines the integrity of our elections. But I'm less concerned about a far-fetched Biden scenario than I am about actual actions Trump is taking to undermine the integrity of the election.

This is probably an admission Biden is not winning Texas, which is common sense. Trump should still win the state by a 6-8 point margin as  said. That perfectly aligns with a ~4-6 point popular vote margin, which means a super tight EC margin

No it's simply not stepping into a pile of horse shit. The same people who were shepherded into overwhelmingly voting for Hillary and Biden in two straight primaries, are the ones you think wouldn't by msm smears over Nader. It's a childish, black and white view of politics.
The 2008 campaign was 5 years long, which made people too tired to care when Obama‚Äôs first action was letting the Bush administration‚Äôs crimes slide.   Cant wait to hear ‚Äúwe need to look forward not back‚Äù when biden lets trump skate
I mean I think at this point very few politicians are going to be liked by the majority of people, but it's better to give Biden a chance than give Trump 4 more years
coincidentally, this is the face i make when someone brings up joe biden

I'm not a socialist, and I'm not happy about the Biden/Kamala ticket.  However, this vid is something that I hope both rose twitter and #YangGang can get behind (in principle).  We need to figure out how to unite if we are going to beat the establishment.
You want this guy? Tbh I‚Äôm not even a Biden supporter I wanted Andrew Yang
I‚Äôm Skeeter Millz and I‚Äôm ridin with Biden. Full blooded Democrat.
So you think dem congress should be more reasonable to get something done, yet you won‚Äôt vote Biden who will most certainly do exactly what your asking?
I don't know how that really works. I think they can boot him out of the postoffice. I'm not sure. Like you, once Biden is sworn into office, I hope our Democrats have enough dirt on 'the lot' of them &amp; investigations begin.
Funny, if President Trump is doing such a terrible job why does Obama try to take credit for his economy &amp; Biden for his foreign Affairs.üòÄ #TrumpsMagicWand
You responded to me buddy. Must be a Joe Biden. Dementia!
I know y‚Äôall racist trump supporters hate research but...
Lmao you absolutely cannot call Biden a racist if you don‚Äôt think Trump is one.

Do they still make those rap battles?  I'd love to see Trump v Biden.
I disagree with this! The Biden campaign was never on life support--it just had two incredibly white states go first in the order of primaries. He led the polls the entire time.
Nah I‚Äôm not I got 25 on the ACT . That‚Äôs the sad part . I‚Äôm not smarter than many who simply refuse to see how this system works . Again if you think Biden will win put money on it
Does Jeanine Pirro (who?) know anything that the Secret Service and the FBI should be made aware of - that something is going to happen and Joe Biden won‚Äôt be on the ballot! Have they brought her in yet to ‚Äúhelp with inquiries‚Äù? Sure hope so...
The language around this is classist and ableist as fuck. Plenty of very smart people do not thrive in rigid academic environments and I can only imagine how much worse it was in Biden‚Äôs era. There is plenty of legitimate fodder for criticism without resorting to this

Biden was Obama's VP, so his record is on trial just like Obama's. What was Biden doing while what little wealth was in Black communities was being destroyed?
NEW:  digs into records on Illinois' former Countering Violent Extremism program.  Leading Dems, including Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, have supported the controversial counterterrorism approach now being included in calls to defund police.
I wonder if anyone has stats comparing social media between Biden and Trump. I know Trump has about 10x the Twitter followers, but would be interested to see other areas like that (livestreams, other platforms, etc.). I bet it is pretty huge difference everywhere!
Joe Biden picking and presenting Kamala Harris as his running just shows how much they really pay attention to black issues. She a whole duck
Nice 3rd grade response...literally...  I havent heard that in 35 years. üòÇüòÇ  Grab a binky, go down for a nap, and dream about YOUR next President, Joe Biden. ü§£
Thinking about how cool it would be if hunter Biden replaced Joe Biden and Kamalas dad replaced kamala
Down ballot is what matters the most anyway. For the left movement, President is mostly a just about influencing the public opinion, helping move the country left, getting the endorsements, and doing executive orders... most progressive policies won't even reach Biden's desk
Trump is currently dismantling the constitutionally mandated Postal Service and these muthafuckas think that some hurt feelings on Twitter is what's going to sour people on voting for Joe Biden. But notice how this account changed its whole tune since Harris was tapped as VP.
We absolutely need Biden to have the lead in both of those states at the end of Election Night if we want ANY chance that Trump and his supporters consider the election legitimate.
Trump Accuses Biden Of Playing Politics On Coronavirus | Morning Joe | M...  via
My two cents: if elected the Biden team should recruit as many current or former Mayors and Governors from solidly blue states and cities into the cabinet, ensuring those emptied posts are filled with Democrats and that democrats on the hill can not worry about losing seats.
marge is going to drive her canyonero to the polling place and vote for joe biden
like yeah, i‚Äôm gonna vote for her and biden but i‚Äôm not going to like it.
Biden and Obama put kids in cages first. Vote green party if you truly care about that. Bernie was the compromise. If we were a cult we'd quickly fall in line and have some 'witty' slogan like #VoteBlueNoMatterWho.
Well the thing too is money and power in the process. Warren and inslee would have been acceptable harm-reduction nominees. But Joe Biden is a republican and a strongly corporate one. Period. He is literally like having Bush in the white house.
Release your videos on YouTube one at a time starting in Late September. Save the big one for mid October. Break the internet, send Trump and Barr to prison. Negotiate deal with Biden, save America.

Biden Has Sizable National Lead In New Polling | Morning Joe | MSNBC  via
Vote for Biden because this in no longer a race for red or blue.   This is a race to save each other from a man that has yet to give condolences for those that we have lost during a pandemic.
Every bit of criticism Biden gets is fair. He's earned it. I just wish we'd galvanize around down ballot progressives. I know it's not an either/or, but down ballot progressives are the best way to shift everything. Pissing on Biden is fun, I just wish it felt more productive.
The FBI altered evidence so they could get court approval to spy on the Trump campaign  And an official just pled guilty to it -    and Biden was part of the spying. :)
Is this normal  ?  why is biden afraid to take  ANY questions? will the media allow him to do this his whole campaign?
For those of you anti-Biden/Harris: could you at least vote to assist in flipping the Senate (if applicable)? You know they‚Äôve adjourned until September, with no deal on a stimulus or anything else to help Americans currently, right? It‚Äôs the least you could do ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
If you've decided to let hundreds of thousands of additional American die because someone was an asshole on Twitter, that's all on you. "The left" doesn't even claim Biden, let alone speak for him.
trump shuttering the post office to curb voting by mail while biden talks about how proud he is to be on the ticket with an amalgam of tim kaine and lori lightfoot isn't as important as follower counts to the "democracy dies in darkness" crew
USPS dismantling has been a bipartisan effort over years and "do-nothings" are just as complacent in the current administration in regards to letting people suffer and die through their inaction and in Biden's case stated refusals to alter the course, just make it sound nicer
If you were on the fence between Trump and Biden, you were never on the fence in the first place. These are all voters who see Trump's clear unfitness, incompetence, and racism, but they're okay with it and just needed an excuse to vote for him without looking like an asshole.
12 would be bigger than Biden picking a VP, not as big as Trump trying to kill the post office
Comparing apples and oranges. Trump's have a long history of being an international business family  Compared to hunter Biden who with no business experience was specifically placed in positions as a conduit for access to the vice president. This is the definition of corruption.
*2022 under the Biden administration*: Starting January 1 2023 anyone in a migrant camp that can show earned income in excess of 35k a year for 3 out of the last 5 years and has at least one us citizen in their extended family will be released within six months.
crazy that biden announced his VP pick just in time for her to have a paid month off from her job to focus on the campaign
They may well have reason for their hysteria.  If a Biden figurehead admin with a  complicit Senate does pack the Supreme Court and get rid of the Electoral College the Flight 93ers will ultimately be proven right.  What would it take for you to consider this?

Game theory is actually great cause we made a credible threat about not voting for Biden under any circumstance back in January and now you chose him and you have to live with the consequences of your actions. A vote for Biden was a vote for Trump, and you did it anyways
If you want to be able to cast another ballot in 2024, vote for Biden.
I'm sorry game theory actually means *you* assisted Trump by electing Biden because we all said we weren't gonna vote for him no matter what back in January. You can't just say "fuck the trans people they'll have to follow our lead", that's not how game theory works
What if we say some shit like  not voting for trump is one vote for biden  &amp; voting for biden is two votes for biden but biden hasnt earned my second vote yet I wont make his or trumps pile of votes bigger   and make these people foam at the mouth
Polls: Joe Biden winning female voters by historic margin - CNNPolitics
Pretty weird how you read all of that into a response that had nothing whatsoever to do with having issues with Biden (I have my own) and everything to do with the dangerous mischaracterization of the issue in this election as the same old "lesser of two evils' discussion.
Hillary's lead on this date in 2016 was virtually identical.   But 2016 was much more volatile. Lots of ups and down.   Biden's lead has been steadily rising since March.
You're looking at this the wrong way. If not being Trump is the biggest reason to vote for Biden, then how could Biden disappoint? Unless you think he could become Trump (unlikely). This gives him tremendous freedom to chart his own course rather than be locked in by expectations
The only two unions that support Trump are police unions. Biden has the support of 35 labor unions, including the AFL-CIO, American Federation of Teachers, National Nurses United, and the Postal Service union. That tells you everything you need to know about this election.
Privileged people will not gain more. They will lose if the working class have power. Biden is exactly what they want, and it's their way or the highway - platitudes without change.
I know beginning under federal right wing fascism is a different starting point but feels like there are paralells in Nixon v Humphrey /trump v Biden &amp; in Chicago how much Lightfoot‚Äôs organized repression built around criminality discourse mirrors things I‚Äôve read about Richard J
Democrat Joe Biden now leads President Trump 53% to 42%, an NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll finds ‚Äî up from an 8-point advantage at the end of June.
In the article, Obama stated Pence could be out becuz of Trumps low numbers. I've said that before. I wouldn't be surprised if he did put Haley in. That could backfire on him, since Pence is an Evangelical. Biden chose Kamala, T might try to up that in order to win. He'll lose.
If Biden had chosen Duckworth, I would have been 100% decided.   This is not about Trump vs Biden. I don‚Äôt feel either will complete a term. Too old. This is really about Pence vs Harris and who will complete the term.

I‚Äôm so excited for Joe to put us back in the Paris agreement so that we have to vow to reduce emissions by 1.5% 45 years after he leaves office, or at least until the next republican takes office and pulls us out again. Very effective, very up to the task
‚ÄúPresgraves, 77, added that it does not reflect what is in his heart.‚Äù Actually, what‚Äôs in this racist knuckledragger‚Äôs heart is much worse.
Biden-Harris supporting media don't believe lying to a federal court as wrongdoing. Very telling. Deeply disturbing.
Strom Thurmond n Joe Biden were bffs too.
Kamala Harris is a unicorn, and the Republicans have no way or plan as to attack her. I think that‚Äôs one of the reasons why Biden selected her. She is tough enough to withstand the attacks the GOP are throwing at her. #BidenHarris2020
Absolutely amazing that he has used these daily so called COVID19 press conferences for nothing more than campaign speeches selling his goods. Can‚Äôt do rallies so he just uses COVID19 time to tout his accomplishments (?) &amp; bad mouth Biden. So tired of this horrible man!
Please vote for Biden especially if you‚Äôre in a swing state. We have to do everything we can to get rid of the cancer currently in the White House.
Joe Biden has been actively on the wrong side of all those issues throughout his career.

Madam Vice President this election is a flight for America's democracy. Thank you for joining the ticket.  Let's fight! People President Liar &amp; #Cult45 is trying to steal the election. Please don't allow this to happen The Biden-Harris ticket must win by an undoubtedly landslide.
Then tell me about how different Biden is  because people are always like ‚Äúoh, it‚Äôs so obvious‚Äù and then when asked ‚Äúok, so in what way is Biden substantively different‚Äù they say ‚Äúcome on! He just IS!‚Äù
Even with Biden‚Äôs big lead in the polls and the Covid crisis sabotaging Trump, I still think it will be close because the GOP is suppressing the vote as hard as they can and the Democrats are meekly letting them.
except she didn't, now, did she?
The obvious answer is vote for Biden/Harris ...... what do you have to lose other than your or your famililh and friends life?
I'll get it if Biden's administration tells me it's safe. I don't trust anyone in this administration, but Dr. Fauci. Everyone else are a bunch of idiots. #IdiotInChief
Naw, I'm voting with my conscience, Bill Clinton, Joe Biden, Larry Summers, Chris Dodd - all sex offenders who used their power to get away with it.
See a lot of people trying to correct Ryan, but I think none of you understand Ryan's trying to make sure Vice stays on good terms with the Biden White House.  It's low key gross you'd try and get between a reporter and their access :-/

I leave it up to Biden but why not give Lauren Underwood a spot? Competitive race, and a NURSE who has been out in front of coronavirus policy since the start
8 out of 10 chance Biden forget her name during presidential win speech. Even if he's reading on paper.üòã
You took the question seriously rather than just taking it as an opportunity to poke fun at Biden. I thank you for that, but I don't think that's what they're interested in . . . Unfortunately.
We know it‚Äôs one of the two, but if Biden loses we don‚Äôt want to hear the same bs after Hillary lost, that it was Bernie supporters or third party voters.  If Biden loses, like Hillary did, it‚Äôs on him and the DNC for not working hard enough, or
Id honestly be surprised if Joe Biden DIDNT pardon Trump the moment hes in office.
That's my idea for why not voting for Biden is justifiable. You want the Dems to move left so you make them work for your vote.
Nah, it's a big improvement on 2016. Biden/Harris do better by 9 points with this demo, compared to Hilary. Not that there isn't a long way to go.
Is anyone else feeling a little insulted that Biden seems to have just started his actual campaign for President this week? As in like, today?
Woah who said anything about Biden?
This was framed as a hit piece but plainly showed that Joe Biden has very good political instincts and lots of powerful people still don‚Äôt
Hey, an endorsement that matters.
"There will be, however, periodic, unavoidable issues related to religious liberty. And it is not too much to ask for Biden to provide assurance that he respects the rights of religious institutions and individuals, even when he strongly disagrees with them on divisive matters."
I‚Äôm not saying Biden is good, I was full Bernie before and I‚Äôm really pissed that it‚Äôs come down to this. Both are bad, but Trump has committed treason w Russia, and has pretty much killed thousands w COVID, which is why I‚Äôm voting for Biden. But fuck the 2 party system
Yep...Joe Biden as YOUR President cupcake.  Enjoy!  ü§£ü§£

go phone bank for biden instead of bothering people.
So to black folk, you tell them you learned about roaches as if black folks only have roaches. Yeah Trump gotta go, I just don‚Äôt like that Biden is all that‚Äôs left. Sad voting day. Where‚Äôs a powerful independent at!

Biden leads Trump by 11 points nationally  via
But could you elaborate though because in Joe Biden we basically have someone who substantively believes in all the same conservative things Trump does, he just doesn‚Äôt tweet and act so distastefully
Does the  #RussianRon/ and Barr realize that even if they try to throw Biden in JAIL, we STILL, STILL, STILL, STILL will not vote for President COVID. #NeverTrump isn't just a hashtag.
Poll dodging or punching the ticket of any candidate not named Biden come November 3rd only enhances the probability of an incumbent president who ranks among the very worse this nation has ever had continuing to make HIS version of America great again.

Trump has done so much for women that he trails Biden by 12 points among women in the Fox poll, 24 in the Marist poll, and 29 points in the Monmouth poll.
But Trump is instituting more of a police state? I‚Äôm not saying Biden is a good person, but police brutality is actively getting worse under Trump. We need at least a chance to turn it around

Democrats should try the same thing with Biden. . . .nevermind.
. and I talked about Joe Biden's pick of Kamala Harris for VP for the Jacobin podcast.
PSA: I understand once again that Biden/Harris AREN‚ÄôT the dream team we need- but now isn‚Äôt the time to create viral tweets pointing those flaws out. Same reason as why third party voting this November is a vote for 45. We need to encourage all voters to elect Biden y‚Äôall.
As this news hits, the USPS union just endorses Joe Biden.
That is not even remotely true.
Now, I'm not one of those "facts &gt; emotions every time" people, and I still don't know how I'll vote.   But in the trolley car, I always pull the lever and safe the net life. Here, that seems to be a Biden vote. Idk. Just try to keep an open mind as the situation changes
Doesn‚Äôt matter I‚Äôm going in early to vote and make sure that my vote is counted. I voted for you, Hillary, and I‚Äôm going to vote for Biden.
I disagree with your premise. But the more I think of it, the more a Biden vote can make sense.  To extract all of our emotion from the problem, let's convert it to the Trolley car. Do you do nothing and let more people die (trump winning), or kill by acting, yet a net life-save?

can‚Äôt wait to hear joe biden say voting is very poggers
of not being able to win with an all Black or all woman ballot, and so in that sense Joe Biden and Tim Kaine were also picked precisely because they were white men. Basically Biden is the only one who has had the privilege of being able to pick a Black woman in over a decade
I'll be voting for Biden/Harris, and I actively campaign for democrats. I respond to questions with compassion and nuance. And I expect that those responses will be met with good faith and charity. This is clearly not the case here.
is he talking about joe biden circumcising america
I'm 31. I didn't vote for Clinton lol. Biden doesn't tout his supposed Christian beliefs so yes I hold the self proclaimed Christian to Christlike standards, as we all should. If the Reps had put up someone besides trump I'd conisider voting Rep again. But they didn't so I'm not
That the statistic is framed as ‚Äúw/o‚Äù suggests  the more productive question might be what lived experiences have they *not* had that leads them to prefer Trump over Biden. I can think of maybe a few things.
The Biden campaign should do a rosy video explaining how Kamala got into politics.
I could see Biden making Romney Secretary of State. He ran the Olympics and was a governor. He knows how to run a big, demoralized organization. State is going to need a great CEO in order to start the rebuilding process.
keep Syracuse law‚Äôs name out of your mouth and leave Joe Biden alone. Ridiculous.
Don't worry everyone I heard Joe Biden is the most electible Democrat so we should be fine
when I hear joe biden speak
Yeah Biden saw it and said he look a guy with my names running for president! Wow
Are you...trying to get me to vote for them? Alright then.   It seems like half of these "anti-Biden" tweets are showing off a cool policy of theirs I didn't know.
I‚Äôm tubing on the Platte River on the Leelanau Peninsula and this house, w/ prime real estate + tons of foot traffic, has the most amazing signs: ‚ÄúThanks Big Gretch,‚Äù ‚ÄúBlack Lives Matter,‚Äù Biden, and the Census link. I love you,   #puremichigan
Anyway, you can lampoon Biden all you want (and God knows I have and will continue to!), but the notion that Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama are somehow more politically skilled than him is not the slam-dunk case their doofus aides might think it is.
Biden is not even remotely cognitively fit to be president.  How stupid does his campaign think the American people are?
It‚Äôs strange when someone tries to pressure me into voting for #Biden by saying ‚ÄúWe won‚Äôt survive 4 more years of #DonaldTrump!‚Äù    I survived 4 years with him and we would survive 4 more.  Let‚Äôs focus on policies and stop being so damn dramatic.
And, in an alternative world, the culinary union endorses Biden and Bernie eeks out a narrow win in NV. Does SC roar back with, ‚ÄòHell NO, Bernie!!‚Äô so strongly? Clyburn is powerful, but there was a of ‚ÄòNot Bernie‚Äô votes too
And there in lies the brute reality of America. That Black and Brown Americans NEED Trump gone because it is detrimental.  Yet they also are being forced to vote for a racist &amp; told you have to or else you‚Äôve caused harm..when it‚Äôs White America that gave us both Trump &amp; Biden.
We wouldn‚Äôt let anyone on Twitter dsy half the racists things Biden has in recent months.  Yet we let Biden say them and say eh but Trump. We decided Black Lives Matter and we decided you cant logic around anything but that.  But now logic trumps racism?
You‚Äôre reminding me why I‚Äôm so disappointed that Joe Biden was annointed as our candidate by the DNC.  So many young and exciting politicians out there who have a firmer grasp on the issues and the sentiment of the people today, especially Castro.
You support Bush and Biden. It's literally your fault.
I believe they‚Äôre gonna flip Biden for a huge name (like Michelle) before the election. Idk, this ticket, with the addition of Kamala (who does not inspire anyone) - seems suicidal. Just feel like they can‚Äôt be this stupid.
Lesser of 2 evils imo, I‚Äôm only going for Biden because im Muslim and he was the one of the first  Americans to recognize what Serbia was doing is genocide and he‚Äôs not trump. I wanted Andrew Yang to be president though
I'm reasonably confident that more Americans will attempt to cast a ballot for Joe Biden than will attempt to cast a ballot for Donald Trump. I'm not at all confident that Joe Biden will be inaugurated on January 20.
Pence is very good and loyal Harris she owes 1 millions $ and she sack Biden by the past she no gonna be loyal it‚Äôs will be a MESSSSSS !!!!
John Podesta Plays Biden In ‚ÄòDoomsday‚Äô Plan If Trump Is Re-Elected  #Technocracy #StopTechnocracy #TheyDontCareAboutYou
Biden didn‚Äôt pick anyone. Obama and the dnc picked Harris. I bet Biden doesn‚Äôt even make it to November. 1 debate should be all it takes
By contrast, Biden has actually been on the national ballot twice and won twice.
whites *who were really never in any danger of ever receiving a college degree*: trump: 64%, Biden 34% - Fixed it.
For me - I hear the words and then I consider you dead to me.  That also goes for the folks who write in folks because Joe Biden doesn't work for them either.
I‚Äôm fully convinced that Kamala is maybe the worst VP pick by Biden. The left focuses on her shit policy and the right focuses on her identity. It‚Äôs a lose-lose especially with Biden at the head of the ticket.
By you saying that Kamala embraces the radical democrats. Just proves how incredibly stupid your are. I am a far left democrat who‚Äôs going to proudly vote the middle of the road ticket,Biden/Harris.
It‚Äôs not like Biden was head and shoulders above the field and they NEED him, either. Really is remarkable.
How about the fact HRC would have destroyed Biden in the primary.  It‚Äôs nobody party. All are leaders and statesman including HRC and Obama.  And they will work together to clean up the trump mess.
The polling on people who plan to vote by mail is overwhelmingly pro Biden and the reverse is true of people who say they are willing to risk COVID to vote in person.
I think it represents cases where Biden wins Texas.
From the column: "Joe Biden even pronounced it two different ways in a single speech this week."
and I are miles apart politically. But this is a pretty factual report on the NEA RA online held last week. A no surprise Biden endorsement and a no surprise NEA president election. Same as it ever was.
Everyone who can't see a difference between Trump and Biden should just keep talking to each other on Twitter. Absolute buffoons.
Everywhere I go people are wearing masks. The only people who aren‚Äôt are the BLM and Antifa rioters whom Biden/Harris and the dems support.
Look at Biden taking notes!!! LOL
Hey!!!  Taxi!?!?!?  Joe Biden, congressional Democrats back disastrous California law destroying the gig economy
I‚Äôm a victim of Joe Biden..  #JoeBidenSniffedMe #sniffand blow

Because you sound like the other whiners who can't accept the fact that there are voters who don't trust Biden/Harris.
These conversations happened when Biden/Harris first announced their individual candidacy. And the conversations are may be feeling more visible for folks now because of them as running mates but the conversations are always happening. We‚Äôre still feeling the effects of it today.
It‚Äôs extremely easy in hindsight to criticize Obamaworld for hitching their wagon to Clinton instead of his own VP in 2016. But it wasn‚Äôt obvious at the time how serious Biden was about running, and she seemed like a natural successor.

Because Joe Biden is reading everything other people have written for him
People were saying they wouldn't vote for a Biden ticket and literally nobody voted for Kamala, so maybe the problem is that Democrats don't understand game theory or what a credible threat is.   It would actually be illogical to vote for Biden at this point

Biden cares about regular Americans he will bring us jobs end hatred and bring change decency respect and dignity to the WH and to the world stage. The age of sexism will end and everyone saying sexist things about Harris will be held accountable and will lose their jobs.
Biden doesn't tolerate sexist attacks against Kamala Harris and i don't either and i will end any friendship with people who say sexist things about Kamala. I am tired of the sexism we should've had a female president in 2016 and we will have a female VP.#BidenHarris2020Landslide

Hillary &amp; Kerry said the same thing instead of trying to unite the party. That turned out great for their campaigns. If Biden was that worried he‚Äôd make serious policy concessions, like at least 1 of the lefts platform policy‚Äôs into his campaign.

Y‚Äôall really happy about Kamala Harris as Biden‚Äôs VP...? üßê
This suburban housewife is anxiously awaiting the day she can vote for Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. So excited to vote for them.
We saw 23 million fracking jobs created under the Obama &amp; Biden administration. We‚Äôve seen 4 million of those jobs lost under the Trump administration.
If I lived in Arizona I would vote for the Democratic candidate but I will vote for my congresswoman Underwood so I will vote. Biden was my fourth choice. He is not a fan of the middle class
Im from Illinois so my vote won‚Äôt make much of a difference. Illinois will go more than 60% for Biden. Biden has played the popular side of politics.  He was against bussing until it was popular. Biden was Obama‚Äôs vice to appease the white southern voters.
Oh FFS, can we at least agree that the liklihood of Biden/Harris continuing to dismantle the post office, ignore experts on disease, collude to make Russia a super power again, and continue to try to take away health care is minimal? Comparatively?

Kamala Harris Is Biden's VP Pick -- Here's What It Means For The Election And Beyond
If you see me liking any moderate Democrat posts it‚Äôs because my leftist ass is trying to deal with the fact that Biden/Harris are our only hope üòî
Kamala Harris is the perfect embodiment of America; she is American, Black, Asian, Indian, and she is a woman. She is so strong that the present man and his cronies in the white house fear her. By her selection as the VP pick, Joe Biden has proved America will rise from her shame
No vote for Trump is a vote for Biden!
She was my hero then and she‚Äôs our hero now. Kamala Harris was actually my first choice to be the presidential nominee. But I‚Äôm very happy with this Biden/Harris ticket.
Again her entire record is testimony to her being a conservative. I‚Äôm not even sure why you‚Äôre not embracing that. Biden‚Äôs trying to love the party to pack right leaning voters. Harris will distance him from the idea he picked a progressive, leftist, communist.
I really want to go all in w/excitement for Biden/Harris but after 2016, I‚Äôm afraid to get my hopes up. I was soooo crushed. I don‚Äôt know if I can take that again. Especially this time. #VotingBlue
Hence these are called the swing states . Went to trump in ‚Äò16.Most likely will be the same this time around . AZ needs to be blue for Biden to win , was Red by a margin last time . Educated states like NY, CA, WA, IL all are blue.

Bill, I don‚Äôt agree with you politically, but you are extremely likeable and cool. This choice for Biden is ridiculous. Admit it.
Biden rejecting party unity will do more to elect trump than anything of the left. I‚Äôm not even a leftist, I‚Äôm a centrist.
Most people understand what his schtick is now. He lies. About everything; in however it will help him in the moment. I personally know many R‚Äôs that voted for him but will not again.They‚Äôre voting for Biden.They want to reboot their party, but for now we fight together.
Agreed with all you said!!! Probably waaaay more excited about her as VP than Biden as P!!
I highly doubt this.  Biden insists he‚Äôs coming after your guns.
When Trump debates Biden.  Game over.  Biden shredded and walking in circles like he doesn‚Äôt know where he is.
Kamala, Congratulations on your selection as the VP candidate with Joe Biden to be the next President and Vice president of the United States. My entire family and I wish the ticket every success and hope that by the teams election on November 3, we can bring law and order.
2 years of politicing (if that word exists) and you have a choice of Trump or Biden.... is that the best the US has?
Seriously fuck this country. It's bad enough Trump is president but the  couldnt possibly pick THE ONE PERSON THAT WOULD BEAT HIM.. so we get stuck with fucking Joe Biden and now fucking Kamila "Cop" Harris as his VP in the height of BLM  Are you fucking kidding me
Now that Biden has picked Kamala Harris, I predict trump will dump Pence and put a woman on the ticket.  You heard it here first!  #POtuS
She represents a total rejection of party unity by the Biden campaign.
A sign that the Biden campaign rejected party unity
Kanaka Harris was a very poor choice for a Vice President.Her time as a prosecutor proved she is someone that does what is popular instead of what‚Äôs right. Elizabeth Warren and Susan Rice were much better choices. Trump is not going to get my vote but neither will Biden.

She‚Äôs represents the Biden campaign rejecting party unity. A repeat of the Hillary 2016 campaign.
Good move by Biden though. She‚Äôs a good choice.
Pretty much sums it up. The Biden campaign adopting the Hillary 2016 campaign of rejecting party unity with the VP pick. Such a shame. Biden and the conservatives just handed Trump the 2020 election.
A total waste. Why did the Biden campaign reject party unity? This is a repeat of Hillary picking Tim Kaine in 2016.
A total rejection of party unity by thr Biden campaign. This is a repeat of 2016.
Biden is repeating the Hillary 2016 campaign when the candidate Hillary rejected party unity by picking a life long conservative Tim Kaine.
Biden not my 1st Choice for President. Harris not my 1st choice for VP. But I trust both to fight for ALL people and to bring much needed change in regards to many facets of American life. Time to step up and make it America the Beautiful again!! #BidenHarris2020

Yes, donated again today. This is going to be a great fundraiser for the Biden Harris ticket!
They will as long as Biden listens and obeys
Biden is Catholic...
Biden rejecting party unity will do more to elect trump than anything of the left. I‚Äôm not even a leftist, I‚Äôm a centrist.
Most people understand what his schtick is now. He lies. About everything; in however it will help him in the moment. I personally know many R‚Äôs that voted for him but will not again.They‚Äôre voting for Biden.They want to reboot their party, but for now we fight together.
Agreed with all you said!!! Probably waaaay more excited about her as VP than Biden as P!!
I highly doubt this.  Biden insists he‚Äôs coming after your guns.
When Trump debates Biden.  Game over.  Biden shredded and walking in circles like he doesn‚Äôt know where he is.
Woman get shit done.   So so happy and hopeful.    Biden/Harris.   Yes.
biden &amp; harris?? i already wasn‚Äôt voting but that just makes it much easier lol
I was until my mom politely asked me to stop screaming biden/harris over and over. She is still mad about Joe biden üòÇ.
Kamala, Congratulations on your selection as the VP candidate with Joe Biden to be the next President and Vice president of the United States. My entire family and I wish the ticket every success and hope that by the teams election on November 3, we can bring law and order.
Seriously fuck this country. It's bad enough Trump is president but the  couldnt possibly pick THE ONE PERSON THAT WOULD BEAT HIM.. so we get stuck with fucking Joe Biden and now fucking Kamila "Cop" Harris as his VP in the height of BLM  Are you fucking kidding me
Not a fan of her, but then, I am not fan of Biden. That being said, I am voting Blue, no matter what. The stakes are way too high.
Chuck Todd keeps comparing Biden/Harris to Reagan/Bush and I'm just like shut up.
She represents a total rejection of party unity by the Biden campaign.
A sign that the Biden campaign rejected party unity
Kanaka Harris was a very poor choice for a Vice President.Her time as a prosecutor proved she is someone that does what is popular instead of what‚Äôs right. Elizabeth Warren and Susan Rice were much better choices. Trump is not going to get my vote but neither will Biden.
LMFAO Joe Biden really picked the woman who accused him of being racist?  Who locked up more black people than anyone in the state of California that rivaled Jim Crow states?  Should've been without doubt that Trump would be ousted this election. Yet the Democrats are bottling it
She‚Äôs represents the Biden campaign rejecting party unity. A repeat of the Hillary 2016 campaign.
Joe Biden has chosen Kamala Harris, the prominent senator from California whose political career has included many barrier-breaking moments, as his running mate, his campaign announced on Tuesday.#KamalaHarrisForVP #montysaiyed
Pretty much sums it up. The Biden campaign adopting the Hillary 2016 campaign of rejecting party unity with the VP pick. Such a shame. Biden and the conservatives just handed Trump the 2020 election.
A total waste. Why did the Biden campaign reject party unity? This is a repeat of Hillary picking Tim Kaine in 2016.
Biden picks Kamala Harris as VP nominee
A total rejection of party unity by thr Biden campaign. This is a repeat of 2016.
Biden is repeating the Hillary 2016 campaign when the candidate Hillary rejected party unity by picking a life long conservative Tim Kaine.
Didn‚Äôt kamala trash Biden in the debates?
Biden is handing Trump the election. The Democratic Party should be sick for letting these two be the ones running
Let's get our 2020 election on, folks! Biden Harris for the win!
Biden not my 1st Choice for President. Harris not my 1st choice for VP. But I trust both to fight for ALL people and to bring much needed change in regards to many facets of American life. Time to step up and make it America the Beautiful again!! #BidenHarris2020
It is great for the President, but horrible for Joe Biden.  Kamala Harris is very unlikable, vicious person.
Biden rejected unity...that‚Äôs why he picked a conservative cop.
Pamela Harris gets the nod from Biden. I wrote white papers for Biden when he worked for Obama
Biden and Harris.  Vote Blue!!
There is no better Democrat to be manipulated than Joe Biden! That's why he is the ideal candidate for the left mob who wants the revolution (read: pathological destruction of the Country). Joe Biden is just a puppet for the left mob and MSM (the same).
If Biden wins we can all pretend things are hunky-dory.
It looks like Joe Biden has chosen his co-loser.   Who will lose the election with him? We're waiting with bated breath... &lt;yawn&gt;
Analysis | A new poll spotlights a key reason Biden is the 2020 favorite
Perhaps you can tell me, how to say this in Chinese?  Hunter Biden made 411 trips to 29 foreign countries in the 1st 5 yrs of Joe's VP.  Five of those trips were to China, none were to Ukraine, where Hunter gets 1m a yr from Bursima energy?  A job, he never has to visit?
Not so sure I‚Äôm into the clone thing. If they can clone, why not clone Biden with a healthy brain
If Biden picks a woman and if trump wants to save his daughter for his 3rd term as president, he could pick Sarah Palin to be his VP pick
Trump claims "some say" that men are offended by Biden choosing a woman as his VP.  It's true, what we need is more men in politics.  "Some say" our president is out of his damn mind.
Have you heard the guy that predicted the winner for president since 1984 correctly even Trump in 2016 said Biden will win in 2020. God save us!
Well we can't compare Biden's VP campaign pick to trump's VP because Sarah Palin is so much smarter than him
I'm sure trump had his speech writers make up a whole assortment of new nasty nicknames for each possible pick to be Biden's VP
I have a feeling that Barr will charge, indite and arrest Obama, Biden, Rice and others on trumped-up charges as an October surprise. What are your thoughts?
To me, the Biden and Trump ads were pathetic.  The Schumer/Abrams ads are downright creepy.
thank you joe biden shit i mean donald trump sorry wrong person
Hahahahahahahahahahahaha... That's the normal mistakes all the people make sometimes.  Biden is totally lost and he needs to be guided by his staff (the left mob) all the time.  Huge difference!
DC Swamp Lizards. They have sold out and probably promised much money if Biden gets in. DemocRATS in Republican clothing.
It will take a while before trump attacks Biden's VP pick. They have to find the right file in their dirt pile. I say 12 seconds
We may have to wait until Biden is in office before their is any serious effort to do what other countries have been doing to contain the virus
They are not much a friends of the USA so is Joe Biden! #Trump2020LetsSaveAmerica
I would say 2 and 3 are pretty close. But a friend of mine knows his Doctore Biden had a stroke and he is declining fast!
Biden will be 82 at the end of his term. I think he can make it. 2? Maybe not.
Russia, same as the Chinese Communist Party, supports Biden. Between that and mail fraud, you people are looking at some massively serious jail time. And I thought you HATED orange!
Just think. We're days away from somebody superimposing Biden's running mate in the WAP video.  Please, quit while you're ahead.
Should we look critically at the choices and their records? Of course. We should hold them to a high standard (something Biden is aware of I'm sure). But I see a lot of preemptive what feels like character assassination from the left as well as the right.
He called her a nasty woman. He said she should be in jail. They insinuated she was a pedophile. We are not prepared for the kinds of attacks that will be endured by Biden's running mate.
Time for a hot take:  If (god forbid) Biden loses, it won't be bc of his running mate.  Each contender has their pros and cons but let's be honest, she won't be in an enviable position. She'll face an onslaught of sexist criticism unseen before in American electoral politics.
You're comparing that history lesson with Biden or Bush W. ?
I'd vote for Biden if he picked Charles Manson.
The only thing Biden is picking is his left nostril.  He will be assigned a running/limping mate.

Why don‚Äôt they each (and Biden) take the Constitution test and compare scores?

1) The entire world is already laughing at us &amp; shaking their collective heads. You‚Äôve turned us into a joke.  2) What she‚Äôs saying is, Joe Biden, unlike you, is open to ideas that aren‚Äôt his own. That‚Äôs how you serve the greater good, by not acting like the only smart person.

What Trump really said: "The suburban housewife will be voting for me because they are thrilled I will protect them from blackie blackman! Biden will let blackie blackman move next door!"
Bernie is being a smart person and sowing unity rather than divisiveness.  Donald Trump is the singular biggest threat to our country. Biden is not a perfect candidate, but he‚Äôs leaps and bounds better than what we‚Äôve got. Sometimes progress is gradual.
I just can't believe a word Biden or Harris say. Friends, family, and strangers I find vote for them lose all my respect. Don't expect me to give a üí© if you are in trouble and need help. I will look you in the eye and laugh as you take your last breath. üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
Biden has been in politics for 51 years, including being a vice president. Do you really think he's gonna be able to do everything that his campaign has promised just because he's president this time?
Biden has been hijacked by Harris &amp; the left. The left has no tolerance for critical thinking. The leftist media is also threatening to punish anyone that dares criticize Harris. Say what you will about Trump &amp; his supporters we want various views. Trump gets it from all quarters
I won‚Äôt lie.... Biden‚Äôs speech was the most Presidential speech we‚Äôve gotten since Trumps been in office.... Because he cannot even articulate what‚Äôs going on in the world.

Kamala Harris is not emotional, weak or technically unqualified.  She is an unrepentant leftist who would do incredible damage to our country after the dementia-plagued Joe Biden is shoved aside.
I was raised Catholic, not currently a practicing Catholic, but I am amazed that Biden is not challenged because of his stance on abortion! You can‚Äôt be a devout Catholic &amp; support abortion.

Fear is all you have. Please. Biden &amp; Harris are going to clean up Trump‚Äôs messes and restore dignity to this country. They‚Äôre going to GOVERN on behalf of ALL Americans best interests, not just ignorant racists.
Read through the toxic Biden Bros in this thread threatening people for criticizing Biden.
Joe Biden has more American blood on his hands than just about anyone you could name, including terrorist leaders. That's not some small thing for you to condescend over.
Do you see how out of touch you seem dismissing peoples' problems with Biden as being "a ticket I 'dont like'"? Like that's psychotic
Biden is also not going to help with the environment or student debt. People with power do not willingly reduce their own power for the benefit of the powerless.
When did the DNC nominate Biden?
Or they could just nominate Kamala Harris since Joe Biden hasn‚Äôt been Nominated yet
Unbelievable.. Super exciting to see Kamala Harris to be our next Vice President!! Biden / Harris !

It would be President Biden's call on that issue. God that sounds so good to say. But seriously Biden most likely would be escorted to the oval office by a military attache' and if Former president trump refused to leave, he would be escorted out.

All the people complaining about Harris also hate Joe Biden. I get that it's hard for a centrist to imagine someone having a self-consistent and honest worldview, but most people actually just don't like establishment politicians.
If you can point to someone who likes Chuck Schumer but hates Nancy Pelosi, loves Biden but hates Hillary, is a fan of Bloomberg and Elliot Engel but hates Amy Klobuchar, then sure. But that's not actually the kind of person you're going after, is it?
Where are you getting that info? I think Trump is a lot closer to Biden than the polls indicate, but I wouldn't guess that's from the black vote.
"Anarchists should be prosecuted" -Joe Biden, July 2020

What exactly is it you're claiming? Are you denying all of the horrific violence I'm referring to happened? Are you claiming Biden somehow wasn't involved in any of it? Or are you saying that it doesn't matter because they mostly happened in the third world?
I know that is why I said Joe Biden is the President not Kamala.
Lets hope that need will not arise. please. I just want Joe Biden to have his turn. without putting him one foot in the grave!
Yes, I am so awash in privilege that I'm familiar with the role Joe Biden has played in war crimes committed by the US since the early 1970s and think that those crimes actually matter
Biden supported Pinochet throughout his politicide. That's just a fact. I'm sorry if it offends you.
I am thrilled that Biden has chosen Kamala Harris as his Vice President mate.  I was hoping it would be her.  This is a very strong Democratic team for the 2020 race.
Joe Biden is the guy who throws leftists out of helicopters, not the guy who could be convinced to move left and enact meaningful change if we all just play ball
Biden‚Äôs VP pick is the first hopeful thing that‚Äôs happened in this country in a long time,
I disagree but we will see how she will work for everyone. I will pray for her &amp; her family to help us to regain our dignity across the world. I promise to support her as she moves forward. I hope she will support Joe Biden as he did Obama!  Remember Joe Biden is the President!

I don't get it. I'm voting for Biden.  Same with all my friends men and women.
Even better....Biden cut to Hillary, who then cuts to  who then introduces VP.
I totally believe they will try to indict Pres.Obama,V.P. Biden, Mueller, Brenner, and FBI employees.Charges of treason are likely.(Because there is no bottom to their criminality)They think that will energize trump‚Äôs racist base.Barr is the one who will do the dirty work again.

She's been treated unfairly. Personally attacked w/o evidence. Now you're getting another stab in. She endorsed Biden, getting a lot of gruff from her supporters for doing so. I agree with her on that choice too but keep it up &amp; more of her antiwar Dems might stay home etc.
She endorsed Biden. I'd really love to talk to you about all of this. If someone is not being honest, and getting paid etc by someone w/ an overriding interest in manipulating public in some direction is a good reason to suspect them, that makes sense. But that's not happening.

Liberals are too racist to comprehend that Joe Biden would do the same thing to the US that he did to South America

I'm so happy biden picked harris im ordering my biden harris 2020 sign asap
Didn‚Äôt  call Biden a racist and say she believes his rape accusers??? Interesting choice
Joe Biden had a number of Midwest options for VP. Ultimately he chose a liberal career politician from California. Who‚Äôs standing up for our Midwest values? The #GOP team is committed to protecting what‚Äôs most important to maintaining our quality of life in America‚Äôs heartland.
Senator Kamala Harris is Joe Biden‚Äôs VP nominee. Let‚Äôs get to work!
Only in the fucked up politics of the US are Biden and Harris considered left. In every other democracy of the world they are CENTER RIGHT politicians. Try expanding your knowledge a little bit and stop swallowing what a fascist party wants you to believe.
Biden is a TURRIBLE pick.  But Better than Trump

Honestly, i am a bigger fan of future VP Harris than I am of Biden.
Breaking News:  Sen. Kamala Harris will be Joe Biden's running mate in the 2020 Presidential Election
Harris,¬†a 55-year-old first-term senator, will be the first Black woman to compete on a major party's presidential ticket.
Harris,¬†a 55-year-old first-term senator, will be the first Black woman to compete on a major party's presidential ticket.
UPDATE: Joe Biden has decided on his running mate: Sen. Kamala Harris.
Biden/Harris... lets gooooooooo
Joe Biden's Vice President will be Kamala Harris not Susan Rice. Here's how I responded.
Democrats close to the campaign say an announcement is imminent, and could come as early as Tuesday.
Monday: Biden is not Trump Tuesday: Biden is not Trump Wednesday: Biden is not Trump Thursday: Joe Biden is not Trump, oh, I'm Joe Biden, ice cream   "Best convention ever"
It is NOT The vice presidential nominee will be speaking right before Barack Obama. Who has the best relationship with Barack Obama and Joe Biden because she worked with them in the Obama White House, Susan Rice.
Val is not a person friend of Obama and Biden's Rice is. She was always a top two pick.
Wrong! They would never leave Susan Rice off. She is a HUGE friend of Obama and Biden. This is the schedule and Rice is the VP.
If Kamala Harris was a VP she would not be speaking twice. I don't see Susan Rice there.   It's obvious she's Biden's pick. Sorry KHive your Queen will never be VP or President
OVER MY DEAD BODY!   I'm only voting for Biden to get rid of Trump.  Biden and his VP will be defeated by a progressive in 2024. Biden better focking not all of a sudden be declared incompetent in middle of his term. If he is, they knew about it before and it was a cover up.
How about we say we disagree with her policies and would never vote for her or Biden if it wasn't for the fact Trump is so dangerous.
He's covering for her. She'll be mad if he doesn't pick her and KHive will be Swarming and ready to mass sting anyone who comments that Biden made the right choice not picking her.
Are you insane? They are the only reason I'm still on Twitter. Silence them and I won't vote for Joe Biden.
Laughable... how convenient to say that when Biden has lost his marbles
Pandering is Biden‚Äôs mantra...
Joe Biden's campaign seems to be going well
Go riden with Biden!
Donald Fucking Trump, I will be glad when you are dead and gone! You are a worthless piece of shit! Joe Biden is going to kick your worthless ass!!!!  You are a sorry excuse for a human being!!!!!   When you die I will piss on your grave, maybe shit on your tombstoneüòÇüòÖü§£üï∑‚ò†Ô∏èüíÄ
Anyone trying to tie cognitive decline to Biden while ignoring Trumps obvious deficits doesn‚Äôt deserve original anything.
The Democratic Party has an embarassment of riches. I will vote for Joe Biden no matter what. All of the women floated as potential VP picks are outstanding. ‚ù§Ô∏è
Shapiro did a whole show on Covid, shreds Trump regularly, and says Biden should keep doing what he‚Äôs doing. Questioning his competence is out of line? This is a lie just like everything else said about Shapiro.
Biden: Biggest. Idiot. Democrats. Ever. Nominated.
I'm not voting against donald. I am voting for Joe Biden because I value all life. I value the rule of law.  I value our constitution and I value myself.  Btw, there are no Republicans in congress.  There are no Republicans in the White House either.
Hillary was a dumpster fire. Biden‚Äôs better but my post was more or less saying that Polls don‚Äôt matter. At all really. It‚Äôs happened before and overconfidence is a dangerous game.
People like her turn a blind eye to Biden‚Äôs racist past and his inappropriateness with little girls. Orange man bad!! Love to know how Trump supports racism...I‚Äôll wait.
Gonna be real weird when Kamala starts trending and everyone thinks Biden‚Äôs chosen his running mate.

It has come to my attention that the Biden campaign is using the slogan ‚ÄúBuild Back Better.‚Äù As a person who over-relies on alliteration in my own article titles, I generally like it, but I feel sad that they didn‚Äôt use what I consider to be his signature word: Malarkey.
Do you want to know what Biden stands for?? Biggest. Idiot. Democrats. Ever. Nominated.

But Rice could be tasked with dealing with international front (foreign policy) will Biden deals with the domestic front!
I just about had enough of the DNC. Can't wait to keep on destroying them by helping to fund progressive primary challenges of Neolib incumbents.   Special note: My anger doesn't mean I won't vote for Dementia Joe Biden because Trump is an insane maniac that needs to be in prison
Yes he needs help not social media posts calling him a con man. Just another reason why I can't stand resistors.  Just a bunch of freaking Biden bullies.
Trump obviously doesn't want to get elected. He just garrenteed that Biden will win. My Social Security benefits in eight years mean everything to me and I'm Ready to fight a Civil War to keep it and have it increased.
Don't use voter shaming on me.  I don't believe in 3rd parties in GE. I would never criticize your right to vote 4 them.  Who said I was voting for Trump or Biden? It is perfectly acceptable to refuse to vote for either of them. In Iowa u can mark on ballot a no vote for POTUS.
I vote the way I want, you vote yours. I either vote for Biden, Trump or refuse to pick and log a no vote for President. Option 3 is a protest vote.  I don't support 3rd party runs for President. Nothing or no one can EVER make me do that.
It‚Äôs insane that Biden‚Äôs bike ride excited me. The simplicity of every second of it spoke volumes.
Harris is using the opposition research she gathered. She is a very evil woman. I will never vote for Biden if he picks her. I don't like eat-mongering Susan Rice, but she's better than Kamala.   Karen Bass is the best and safest choice.
Thats why I said alone, sadly. We are not getting a much more selfless candidate like a Bernie, and we may never in this country. But I will take Biden over that orange slime any day.
And did you also see that Instagram, owned by FB, was suppressing suppressing negative Trump hashtags but not Biden ones. None of it is accidental.
JOE  BIDEN  needs your help. The United States Needs Your Help.
Rates have nothing to do with the ACA. Republicans refuse to cap premiums.   Trump cannot get rid of the ACA and then Rename it as Trumpcare. He is such a total insecure loser.  FYI - I'm not a fan of Barack Obama, Joe Biden or any Repub or Dem. I don't like either party.
Joe Biden should pick Lori Lightfoot as his VP so she can just yell at us and shame us into making better decisions.

Joe Biden hates black people. Donald Trump loves black people. Yet blacks will still vote for biden
Joe Biden's dangerous liberal agenda would upset god and bring a plague upon the earth. And you are helping it CNN so shame on you.
That's exactly why I am not watching that crap. I have no desire to see Kamala Harris and Elizabeth Warren or even Joe Biden and his VP speak.   I don't give a fock about the convention.
Yes I agree, but how can we convince people to get out and vote? Russia is working on tRump‚Äôs behalf by denigrating Biden and sowing seeds of doubt about the election.
It will be Susan Rice who has a really good working relationship with Joe. Kamala Harris attacked Biden. She's too ambitious And will try to overshadow Joe, which won't be hard. Harris would be willing declare Joe incompetent just to be president. #NeverKamala
When Joe Biden loses in a landside and the Black vote for Trump is 90%, I wonder what their excuse will be
Joe Biden is the obvious presidential candidate to lead our country!!!!!
I don‚Äôt have a problem with honest criticism, but so much of the attacks on Biden seem utterly contrived and propagandistic.
I am with you but Biden will make it even harder for me to vote for him if he picks Kamala Harris or Elizabeth Warren. I might have to get drunk and stoned before I fill out my ballot if they are on it.
just because biden says he will DOESNT MEAN HE'LL DO IT
Obama fucked up by not endorsing AOC. I don't think I can vote for Biden now. I am totally over these neo-lib corporate class Democrats.

Joe Biden has a big heart and an addled brain.
Aw crap. I didn't even know this was possible. If Biden stops talking in public, he's going to get elected, and then we're screwed. I'll miss God and the Bible. And guns... wait, does this count airsoft?
I will hold my nose and vote for Joe Biden as long as his VP isn't Kamala Harris or Elizabeth Warren. I don't care what anyone thinks of me because of my refusal to vote for Biden if he picks either of those two women.
I'm in the same mind set. I will hold my nose and vote for Joe Biden as long as the VP isn't Kamala Harris or Elizabeth Warren. And I don't care what anyone thinks of me because of my refusal to vote for Biden if he picks either of those two women.
Oh trust me... I have never said any candidate is non flawed!! But if any other politician had said what Biden has over the last few days .. it would be headlines ... but it‚Äôs crickets
Oh and I am sure that Biden personally wrote the tweet or even told someone what to write!! Really? You heard this interview didn‚Äôt you? You heard his tone ? And how he spoke to the reporter ? We have a President who speaks for himself and owns it!! #CheckItOut
Ummmm you actually believe that Biden copped to this ??? Now that‚Äôs funny!! And because you believe it... you are part the problem!! SMH
If Biden is faking his dementia. how does he get his eyes to appear dead, zombie-like?  Are you saying he faked his two brain aneurysms also?
So, according to Mr Bunder Biden, ALL BLACK PEOPLE ARE THE SAME! No diversity exists among them? It wasn‚Äôt long ago he touted this insult:‚ÄùIf you ain‚Äôt black you ain‚Äôt voting Democrat‚Äù.
Where does he go after this with his smears? What‚Äôs worse than God hates Biden?
How does he escalate this? Biden can blow up the planet with just one look?
But don‚Äôt tell us what Biden said about Blacks this morning.  Probably not important to you but maybe to a lot of blacks
From CNN: Fact check: Trump ad edits out microphone and trees from Biden photo to make him seem alone in basement Fact check: Trump ad edits out microphone and trees from Biden photo to make him seem alone in basement (Trump tries everything )
You‚Äôre not concerned about Biden at all? Like not even a percent? Have you seen... anything he said? Let‚Äôs go back years upon years ago when his brain was fine and he said ‚ÄúWe already have a nigger mayor, we don‚Äôt need another nigger big shot‚Äù. Why on earth is that okay with u??
He's the best the Dems could nominate in order to secure the Black vote.  Because if you don't vote for Biden then "you ain't Black!"You should absolutely vote before you see Biden debate. Everything is fine. Nothing to see here.
The polls that show the majority of Americans support wearing masks outside all the time.   Same polls that show Biden with a 7 point lead.  When is the last time you saw a neighbor mowing grass with a mask.
Remember not voting at all is a vote for Trump too. Vote for democracy, vote for Biden.

Never going to. Biden is running on this. There go 50 million votes.

Biden won't debate. Trump-Kanye debates every Saturday night until election day. I'll make the popcorn.

I think its a shame that Beto, Stacey Abrams, and Lauren Underwood weren‚Äôt invited to speak at the convention but someone who constantly trashes the DNC and Biden and Kamala is allowed to speak.
We have moved all of our planned theater performances into 2021. Update this week, stay tuned and stay healthy... and vote Biden/Harris!
ANTIFA was there and Trump said there was blame on both sides. Now we know who ANTIFA is. An arm of the Democrat Party.  Mr. Biden you are a blatant liar.
Just leave it at this. The United States cannot survive $3 trillion in tax increases for political favors. Hence, Biden can‚Äôt be elected.
What was Joe Biden‚Äôs plan to stop COVID back in February or March?  I‚Äôm honestly asking.  I don‚Äôt remember.
Joe Biden  presser stating masks must be mandatory 4 all of Americans yet neither he nor Kamala are wearing a mask. He is inside with people present and that is far worse than being outside. Please Joe explain why you are not wearing a mask 100% of the time. Wating ??
You must mean Biden, Bill Clinton, Anthony Weiner &amp; many more Dems! It‚Äôs all coming out and people will be shocked! It won‚Äôt be Trump going down, except for being the first President who truly stopped child sex trafficking, he has already beat other POTUS in arrests for it BIGLY!

She‚Äôs right. He‚Äôs not going to make it to November 3. They will have to pull him from the ticket.
Why don‚Äôt they each (and Biden) take the Constitution test and compare scores?
When Obama was President, we didn't have to use a mask. The country was never shut down. It wasn't always about him like Trump makes it out to be. When Obama and Biden were in office we were in a much better place as a country.
joe biden did the same in 08 and now he‚Äôs the nominee and is favored to win the presidency. people don‚Äôt care if you dropped out.
I find it endearing that Biden calls his spouse Jilly &amp; Harris calls her spouse Dougy. Something about those affectionate gestures seems 2 show some sort of kindred spirit. I hope they continue 2 develop trust &amp; patience &amp; respect 4 each other within the crucible of the campaign.
No he won't, people want change. The only way he can win at this point is if he cheats. Biden is winning all ready according to some of (many) polls.
A family member said  was done because of the riots. I reminded him that those are left-wing lunatics, financially attached to the Biden campaign. We can‚Äôt reward their campaign of intimidation by voting for them.
welp that‚Äôs it folks. looks like biden is winning in a landslide.
If I unfollowed you it's probably because I caught you supporting the Biden/Harris ticket. I'm not sorry.

Biden is under no moral obligation to debate someone with no compunction about lying.
I think this headline is sexist.  Could you imagine "Biden Embraces Durbin" or Biden Embraces Buttigieg" or "Trump Embraces Pence"? Uh-uh. It would have been "selects" or "announces." Do better, Chicago Tribune. #WeHaveHerBack #ChicagoTribune
Biden shot himself in the foot and gave Trump the election. He should have picked Tulsi Gabbard. A smart, articulate, young woman. Ex-military, dedicated to her religion of peace and kindness...she would have balanced the ticket. I support Trump, but I would have voted for them.
Biden is a strong leader who is respectful of others opions and take them into consideration when making a decision. A good leader will surround themselves with others that can give good information on the other side another set of eyes that may not see things the way he does.

Biden waited to announce, now the news cycle is so far removed from where it was when Kamala was running that most boomers have probably forgotten all the bullshit that went down
Fundraising for Harrison has been through the roof recently and with biden closing the gap in this state, Harrison is out performing biden in multiple demographics.
Today, the Biden-Harris campaign officially kicked off. 84 Days remain until we beat Donald Trump. And I advise you to use every last one of them to ensure we get Joe Biden and Kamala Harris into office.
Don't see what new voters she brings to Biden that he didn't already have. And he wins California anyway.
Biden should have picked Tulsi Gabbard. She is smart, articulate, a veteran (the last veteran picked by the Dems war JFK), she is committed to her faith of peace and respect and a young attractive woman. She would bring balance to the Biden team, but Joe shot himself in the foot.
College football is cancelled so the whole issue of players taking a knee is not relevant. Biden answered that with his VP pick.
#teamKamala all the way. I am glad Joe Biden is comfortable with a strong, ambitious woman by his side. Godspeed.
Yes! I'm am beyond thrilled!!! Can't wait to send in my check, get my sign, and get to work to elect the Biden-Harris ticket!

In case anyone on the Biden/Harris campaign in listening I'll debase myself for $100, heck, I'll talk myself down to $50 for you
Biden would win California without her. What other state does she help him win.
Going to pass busy celebrating Biden/Harris announcement! Actually you can count me out for any of your briefings which I don't listen to anyway?
A great pick. I was a Harris fan from the beginning and very happy Biden chose her.

If Joe Biden picks a black female VP he may get 20% of the 12% of the black population to vote for him.   Trump got far more than that good jobs.
Does Joe Biden lie? His entire career:
I have no idea why the "Biden VP Pick" thing is giving me so much anxiety. I already know I'm voting for him no matter what. I guess I'm just sick of the discourse and I want this nightmare over so we can at least start making progress as a nation (even a tiny bit).
Agreed this is not a good thing to do during a Pandemic I am glad to see others feel the same! I would like to wake up one day and just have a little bit of good news like JOE BIDEN IS ANNOUNCING HOS VP!
Agreed I am now getting very irritated as most I know and losing momentum. I contribute Everytime and support Biden but not happy about what feels like a tease day in and day out!
Whoever Joe Biden picks I‚Äôm willing to bet there will be an article out within five minutes about if his pick is likable bc sexism.
I believe she was banned by her bank, Uber &amp; food delivery companies too. She faces now what we will face in a Biden presidency: persecution for speaking out and supporting  I pray she wins.

No, she's right; all you need do is look at Biden's upward-trending polling numbers.
Joe Biden ignored Twitter throughout the primary so why do some people think he should pick on VP on their deadline? I can guarantee Biden knows how to deal with this process than people on Twitter
Make it a triple endorsement by Biden, Obama, and Hillary Clinton.  Just for good measure, Nancy Pelosi, Chuck Schumer, and Adam Schiff can all approve of it after release.
Except in cases of landslide (I'll call Hawaii for Biden today, but I can't say by how much).
Because Hillary Clinton was polling ahead of Trump, and narrowly lost the Electoral College anyway (thanks, James Comey). So if Biden's ahead of her, maybe he won't lose. I don't care about polling; I'm gunning for Nixon's #18M record margin. It is unlikely, but possible.

So...where‚Äôs Trump‚Äôs statement of faith then? Perhaps too written by his staff? Even if it was written by his staff (which I doubt), the fact that Biden CARES enough about his faith to actually have his staff write &amp; approve this document is proof of where his values lie.

I didn't see proof of that and didn't find his "bragging" credible. Biden on the other hand, blatantly molests children in broad daylight and on camera over and over again.
Oh my goodness! You ARE joking, right? This administration supports all the hare-brained ideas that the person in the WH tosses out! Good gracious, but I hate to tell you that no one believes the  anymore. That ship has long since sailed. Biden does invest in the science!
I know you aren't voting Trump. Didn't say you were. If you like watching children you are clearly a Biden fan.
Kamala Harris and Joe Biden don't #BelieveWomen - remember not that long ago the radical left was pushing the idea that even if you are innocent of such charges you are guilty anyway and should step down from whatever position you hold? I guess they changed their minds.
After the election Trump will begin his revenge march. Congress, afraid of the damage will finally get the 25th going. Too dangerous to let him stay in office until Biden is sworn in.
While neither Harris or Biden are wearing their masks. After calling for a national mandate.  Seen enough yet ?

PSA calls it as they see it.  I'm a huge fan.  Biden clearly takes nothing political said about him personally.  So my response is a huge "So What?"
Second, the leftists are ridiculously painted, apparently based on your relatively limited experience &amp; the propaganda we've been inundated with. Of course they (&amp; ALL thinkers who aren't directly benefiting from his awful agendas) will have problems w/ Biden, we have all along.
AOC also is a progressive but has to claim democrat because of our flawed 2 party system. People like Hilary, Obama, and Biden are centralists who don't have the best interests for the American people like AOC and Bernie.

Joe Biden is speaking live now about Kamala Harris üëçüôåüëè‚úäÔ∏è#BidenHarris2020
From what I read from 5 days ago from the New York Times, she is being allowed to go ahead with her suit. So, if turns out to be true, I‚Äôm not going to ignore his behaviour either. But certainly not going to watch the US go to hell in a hand basket with Biden.
Fuck Biden. I support the second amendment.
Voting for Joe Biden won't end racism.
Is in Joe Biden still the presumptively  Nominee?
Trump, however, has been a spotlight on some of our biggest, long standing problems as a Nation. He empowered the white nationalists to come out of the woodwork... These people didn't just start existing, they've been here, and now, we can all see them. Biden would hide all that.
Then, also, there's how Biden has been frighteningly effective, despite his power-grab attempts, right-of-Reagan positions, and love of the Patriot Acts. He not only bragged he'd written most of their content years before, but was one of the primary pushers for them on Congress.
Not to pick nits, but, it's "intents and purposes."   There are a lot of people who would disagree, whose lives are deeply affected by surface differences. Particularly Muslim refugees, and those who fight the pandemic in Blue States. Biden might also listen to Fauci &amp; such...
Shut up and have another beer, Matt Gaetz!  Do you ever listen to trump's briefings?  Joe Biden is a genius compared to trump's disjointed rants, lies and babbling!  Do what you're best at Matt...getting bailed out of DUI's!

You lost in 2016 because black folks weren't jazzed about Hillary and Trump stole blue collar workers.  What's changed?    Biden excites nobody (even when lucid) and Harris is an authoritarian who prosecuted drug cases against minorities while herself a casual user.   Enjoy.
???? You clown, Biden is a lifelong committed Catholic.
I have a friend That has a better 10 then me he said if Biden takes Harris he will not be voting for  Biden
Oof! I'm not a fan if Biden and disappointed with Harris, but in no way are they T/P part 2. You can be salty and still realistic.
But Biden‚Äôs climate plan avoids that part of the equation entirely. Good article
To meet the IPCC timeline, it‚Äôs not enough only to focus on transitioning to clean energy; it‚Äôs also necessary to drive down fossil fuel extraction &amp; production. Global oil &amp; gas production needs to fall 37% &amp; 25% to avert planetary warming of &gt;1.5‚Ä¢C.
I will not vote Joe Biden, Donald Trump, or any political candidate.....not old enough üòé
In the short term, immediate picture, Trump/Pence is indeed worse... However, Biden is a shockingly effective spin-doc for evil (like his push FOR the Patriot Acts), and far more effective all around. T/P will push us to FINALLY revolt, where B/H will hide much of what T spotlit.
What, cops supporting Trump....nooooo way lol! Obviously they believe he's their best choice at giving them the right to rape your first amendment. To keep the police unions to continue being the enemy of the people. #Pence #Trump

Eric don't you really understand how ignorant you appear and that thd world laughs at you not Joe Biden
As someone who was wrongly detained I just don't understand how you can gloss over this.  This ticket should have been so much better.  The two gentlemen advocating for the wrongfully imprisoned are Biden supporters, but the see the clear problem here.
Did he call a briefing just to be nasty to Kamala Harris?  Proves what a petty, little, vindictive human being trump is!  The Biden/Harris ticket has what it will take to restore America and trump knows it. You can be sure it's scaring the crap out of him. I expected this!
As long as we have some confidence Biden/Harris will win, let Trump be Trump until election. The country will repair.

If any politician assumed I'd vote for someone because they were a certain race I'd be insulted. To hear them say the only way biden gets the black vote is if he picks a black woman vp sounds like they're assuming an entire group of people vote solely by race. #Trump2020
Only way biden wins is if he picks Michelle Obama or oprah Winfrey.  #trump2020
Did I say anything that a rational person could possibly misconstrue as that?   That's opposition politics. Look at my "tweets and replies," or, better, WHAT I ACTUALLY SAID.   Are you cool with Mr "Patriot Acts ROCK" Biden in charge of this new SS? He's poised to win, you know.
Interesting. I was in the UP over the weekend and literally saw no Biden signs, multiple Trump signs and some interesting wordsmithing involving Gov Whitmer.....
Do it Biden. Put a black woman on the ticket.
Too bad the reporters at the briefing didn't stand up and question that "fact" he blew out of his ample ass right then!  I'm so sick of his lies and ignorant comments.  Joe Biden is an Einstein compared to trump!

No payroll tax is just his way to kill Social Security. Also you must get on this USPS he placed yesterday he's placed in the job to kill the election. They will hold all ballots and change them to be for Trump not for Biden. Count of that. This is something Putin wants.
This is so true and it all has to do with the USPS. No person should use mail in vote it's all a scam to kill the Biden votes and transfer them to trump. This is Putins plan so he will then be seated as President not trump he'll be done and putin will take his new job in America.
Well your a very young very stupid little boy. If you take time to study Biden you would understand Biden is not a criminal while Trump is now and has always been a criminal. Grow up.

You won't commit to voting for Joe Biden until the debates are over?  Really?  Like you think trump will do a 360 and say something intelligent?

Have you ever listened to trump?  He can't even speak in whole sentences!  He babbles on, lying and making no sense. You have a lot of nerve, trying to call out Joe Biden!
Biden is a complete idiot.
If that happens, which I highly doubt, Joe Biden will get the wake up call of a lifetime.  How can Joe lay a hand on our guns, then he'd have to take them off of the children and women for a second. Impossible for him.
Biden won‚Äôt have to drive once he is elected.....Secret Service will drive him anywhere he needs to be.

Again, this goes without saying that the caveat is if Biden continues to hold an 8 point lead in November, the forecast jumps into the 90s. All about time decay and the math.
Yeah, it sucks. A potential positive is if Kamala is a 2024 candidate (assuming Biden wins and doesn‚Äôt run again) there is another primary process that can shift the candidate to someone different. It‚Äôs not necessarily an incumbent situation where the party is tied to her.
Warren voters were pretty mutually split between Bernie and Biden as a second choice. It wasn‚Äôt enough of a swing to give Bernie any momentum. Those voters went to Biden
I‚Äôm disappointed as well, but party infighting is what lead to Trump. Hillary alienated progressives. Biden‚Äôs playform has moved to the left since the final debate. Don‚Äôt blame the candidate when progressive voters didn‚Äôt show up like they never do.
Not to mention her Senate seat is about as safe as you'd get. That can't be said about some of the other candidates he could have chosen.  Biden's favorability took a significant jump after selecting Kamala, so this is a net positive.
Eh, of the options Biden had, she's not bad. Warren is much more suited to be in a place where she can craft policy. She's (Harris) voted in agreement with Sanders on something like 93% of legislation. If progressives can't get with this ticket, they're not truly progressive.

Oh explains everything ! Thanks for elaborating and making sense of this all. Bottom line you are insane if you think Kamala Harris is going to look after the people. And Biden well he‚Äôs a racist according to Harris so we will see how that turns out..
Just not for Biden !
I'm fucking pissed that we are going to have another 4 years of trump like fucking christ we are so screwed choosing Harris as his VP I think Biden just yeeted the election away
someone better tell them that Biden didn‚Äôt pick them for his running mate
Didn't she say she believed Biden's accusers? So how is that going to work?
Oh yes! But you guys will always talk bad about her or anyone else who would be a running mate with Biden.

It is significant though that this particular sample of voters split 46-39 for Hillary, and now say they'll be 53-40 for Biden. That's a useful data point.
The telling sign in this dataset is the difference in margin of those in the sample who voted in 2016 versus their intentions for 2020. There's a 7 point swing to Biden. So even without education weighting, there IS a statistically significant difference and advantage for Biden.
Seriously? Have you not been watching Biden in the last year or so?
I don‚Äôt remember trump saying he would cure cancer. Not that I don‚Äôt believe you, but I saw the video of Biden declaring it.
And yet he gets a pass. If Trump made 1 comment even close to what Plugs Biden said he would have been charged with a hate crime.
Jr how‚Äôs about Trumps campaign picks one moderator and Biden‚Äôs side picks one moderator. Let‚Äôs make this fun to watch.
I believe Biden says things that definitely come off offensive. However I believ he is sincere in his efforts to correct himself as he has acknowledged every single questionable comment. I would absolutely give Trump the benefit if he ever took responsibility for a single comment

Be realistic, do you want trump? Because no one else but Biden stands a chance. And have you seen immigration nation? Those cages weren‚Äôt for children. The Obama administration wanted immigrants who were criminals out, not everyone who came here illegally. It‚Äôs trump or Biden.

Dream on, Don. Your actual opponent is Joe Biden. Pay attention.
I will vote for all the other people I want. I won‚Äôt vote for anyone but I have that option in Illinois. Biden will win Illinois  Jill Stein was a Russian operative to bleed votes from Clinton just as Kanye West is doing now to get black vote
I don't understand why this message is targeting me, I want the person to vote no matter what. However, I personally hate the pressure messaging of "vote Biden or else", even though I personally believe it myself. You're just going to turn away potential voters talking like that.
You need to pressure the Biden campaign to appeal to the center and left. It‚Äôs on you if he doesn‚Äôt like Hillary didn‚Äôt. Biden will give us Trump again because of his refusal to unite the party.
Hillary &amp; Kerry said the same thing instead of trying to unite the party. That turned out great for their campaigns. If Biden was that worried he‚Äôd make serious policy concessions, like at least 1 of the lefts platform policy‚Äôs into his campaign.
It‚Äôs between trump and Biden and they both have allegations. But at least Biden doesn‚Äôt lock up children and separate them from their families
I‚Äôve been telling people for like half a year now that the time to be complacent for any leadership is over. I‚Äôm voting Biden but I‚Äôm gonna be constantly critical of him and demanding more.
Next President of the United States Joe Biden and the next Vice President Kamala Harris.
Uh............DUH!!!  That's why we're voting for Biden!!  #BlueTsunami
She‚Äôs NOT black.  She bashed Biden, what changed.  Oh she maybe President!! Think twice!!
Harris is the first Dem to be on the top of the ticket west of the Rocky Mountains. Biden/Harris are the first candidates in decades to have not gone to an Ivy School.
It‚Äôs on Biden to win the left. I have a third option of not voting or Howie Hawkins. Biden‚Äôs repeating the Hillary 16 campaign and isn‚Äôt going to even offer policy to the left to unite with him.
Idk if it's PBS or the DNC but whoever is doing the pre-speech music for this biden/harris ordeal is slaying.
Isn‚Äôt Biden supposed to lead on day one?
Yeah in terms of environment Trump is honestly the worst, although with the Biden's mental decline, Kamala will be the real presidential candidate and with what she has done to people and her authoritarian ideals, I don't feel like she's better than Trump.
Although Biden is further to the right than Trump, so how is that going to help the left?
It says so much about our beautiful country that a major party ticket now includes a Black and South Asian American woman. Congratulations, Kamala #MVP
I'm sorry but I have to disagree with being able to be able get much more done with Biden and Harris. They are both far more to the right than Trump and have been shown to be far more authoritarian and a genuine threat to African Americans.
Y‚Äôall really happy about Kamala Harris as Biden‚Äôs VP...? üßê
We saw 23 million fracking jobs created under the Obama &amp; Biden administration. We‚Äôve seen 4 million of those jobs lost under the Trump administration.
If I lived in Arizona I would vote for the Democratic candidate but I will vote for my congresswoman Underwood so I will vote. Biden was my fourth choice. He is not a fan of the middle class
Im from Illinois so my vote won‚Äôt make much of a difference. Illinois will go more than 60% for Biden. Biden has played the popular side of politics.  He was against bussing until it was popular. Biden was Obama‚Äôs vice to appease the white southern voters.
Oh FFS, can we at least agree that the liklihood of Biden/Harris continuing to dismantle the post office, ignore experts on disease, collude to make Russia a super power again, and continue to try to take away health care is minimal? Comparatively?
How Kamala Harris outflanked her skeptics to become Biden‚Äôs VP pick  via
It's funny how hypocritical Trump is calling Joe Biden "sleepy Joe" when Mike Pence constantly  sleeps on the job, Kamala Harris is gonna make him her bitch in their debate.
And Biden will refer to her as "the first mainstream(whatever ethnicityTrump chooses) who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice-looking broad who is fun to sniff" No ill wishes to Biden, but I hope she takes over quick.

We have the human and industrial capital in the so-called "Rust Belt" to challenge - if not overtake! - China as the prime producer of renewable energy in the world. The Biden/Harris administration /must/ make that a key plank in its platform for the rest of this decade.
How does Joe Biden know that?!?! He doesn't even remember his own name... Stop making falsified claims you can't back up. #Trump2020 If you have even a single brain cell remaining you will vote for the RIGHT choice. Trump for another 4!!!
I don‚Äôt know why it would be this time, Biden would likely pick a cabinet that‚Äôs as optimal and expert-filled as possible
How many stones do you need?  Those without sin throw the first one.  REALLY!  Biden?  Evil will always prevail!

Kamala Harris Is Biden's VP Pick -- Here's What It Means For The Election And Beyond
Biden is Catholic
Good is evil and evil is good!! Crazy and people are blind.  I had a classmate say if he had Mickey Mouse running she would still vote for Biden.  So much Hate out there.  It‚Äôs a war between God and Satan.  If we know the end of the ‚ÄúBook‚Äù we know who wins. üòá
No vote for Trump is a vote for Biden!
Again her entire record is testimony to her being a conservative. I‚Äôm not even sure why you‚Äôre not embracing that. Biden‚Äôs trying to love the party to pack right leaning voters. Harris will distance him from the idea he picked a progressive, leftist, communist.
You have mistaken this with the Democrats and the MSM.  They will do ANYTHING to win the elections. President Trump has behind him the silent majority.  Biden has behind him the violent, screaming minority.  That's the difference. President Trump will be reelected.
seriously, i really fucked with him heavy but then he let us all down by supporting biden

Who has confidence in Biden? He can't even remember Obama's name.
I mean with Kamala as VP, she is essentially the president due to Biden's mental deterioration. Considering she's pro slavery and anti pot, are you sure?
They will as long as Biden listens and obeys
Obama and Biden left a pandemic plan behind in case something happened, which was then ignored when a pandemic happened. ACA isn't really to blame for this.
Biden rejecting party unity will do more to elect trump than anything of the left. I‚Äôm not even a leftist, I‚Äôm a centrist.
Woman get shit done.   So so happy and hopeful.    Biden/Harris.   Yes.
biden &amp; harris?? i already wasn‚Äôt voting but that just makes it much easier lol
I've been saying ever since it was clear that Bernie was probably gonna lose that I would vote for Biden just because he'll at least be capable of listening to criticism and will fill his administration with experts.  We gotta just pour on the pressure even harder if Biden wins.
Nah, that's a bad take. If you're not feeling Biden then you don't HAVE to vote Biden. Heck, even Biden has said the same thing when talking about the Tara Reade allegations.   You're just alienating people who are on the fence if you say they HAVE to vote Biden.
That's fair. I generally only really push people to really consider voting Biden if they're in battleground states, since their vote might actually make a direct impact on the results.  I want 3rd parties to be a viable option but we gotta get election reform first sadly.
He did not say that he would veto M4A, here is the direct quote of his response to the question of if he'd veto M4A.  "I would veto anything that delays providing the security and the certainty of health care being available now."
Not a fan of her, but then, I am not fan of Biden. That being said, I am voting Blue, no matter what. The stakes are way too high.
She represents a total rejection of party unity by the Biden campaign.
A sign that the Biden campaign rejected party unity
Biden has nothing to do with either 160k+ dead or the recession, and Kamala's healthcare plan would've covered everyone and forced private healthcare to follow stricter regulation.
Of course he did, it's Trump. The man is maximum pettiness personified.  I'd vote for a moldy lemon and stale bread before I voted for Trump, and Biden/Harris at least have some real interesting history and a lot of progressive policy writers pushing the campaign along.
Kanaka Harris was a very poor choice for a Vice President.Her time as a prosecutor proved she is someone that does what is popular instead of what‚Äôs right. Elizabeth Warren and Susan Rice were much better choices. Trump is not going to get my vote but neither will Biden.
She‚Äôs represents the Biden campaign rejecting party unity. A repeat of the Hillary 2016 campaign.
Joe Biden has chosen Kamala Harris, the prominent senator from California whose political career has included many barrier-breaking moments, as his running mate, his campaign announced on Tuesday.#KamalaHarrisForVP #montysaiyed
Pretty much sums it up. The Biden campaign adopting the Hillary 2016 campaign of rejecting party unity with the VP pick. Such a shame. Biden and the conservatives just handed Trump the 2020 election.
A total waste. Why did the Biden campaign reject party unity? This is a repeat of Hillary picking Tim Kaine in 2016.
Biden picks Kamala Harris as VP nominee
A total rejection of party unity by thr Biden campaign. This is a repeat of 2016.
Warren would've been my vote in the primary had the writing not already been on the wall that she was not going to be competitive enough in the primary, so I shifted to Bernie.  If it makes you feel any better, Warren has been a *major* policy adviser for Biden in recent months.
Biden is repeating the Hillary 2016 campaign when the candidate Hillary rejected party unity by picking a life long conservative Tim Kaine.
Didn‚Äôt kamala trash Biden in the debates?
Yay! And the next president after Biden.
I don't know who he could've picked that would've pulled in more progressive and younger voters. Elizabeth Warren is amazing, but people didn't show up for her, and she's just as old as Biden is.
Biden is handing Trump the election. The Democratic Party should be sick for letting these two be the ones running
Let's get our 2020 election on, folks! Biden Harris for the win!
Kamala Harris was honestly probably my top pick for VP (her, Warren, and Susan Rice top 3), she'll be a great choice, assuming that Biden continues to work with Sanders and Warren with his policies.
She's not really polarizing, and especially neither her nor Biden are as divisive as Trump. That's a false equivalence. Listening to Harris interrogate someone is the most exciting thing out there, she's a great speaker.
It is great for the President, but horrible for Joe Biden.  Kamala Harris is very unlikable, vicious person.
Biden rejected unity...that‚Äôs why he picked a conservative cop.
Pamela Harris gets the nod from Biden. I wrote white papers for Biden when he worked for Obama
Biden Harris LFG
There is no better Democrat to be manipulated than Joe Biden! That's why he is the ideal candidate for the left mob who wants the revolution (read: pathological destruction of the Country). Joe Biden is just a puppet for the left mob and MSM (the same).

To me, the Biden and Trump ads were pathetic.  The Schumer/Abrams ads are downright creepy.
Hahahahahahahahahahahaha... That's the normal mistakes all the people make sometimes.  Biden is totally lost and he needs to be guided by his staff (the left mob) all the time.  Huge difference!

I would say 2 and 3 are pretty close. But a friend of mine knows his Doctore Biden had a stroke and he is declining fast!
And yet unlike Trump, Biden will pick an administration and work with qualified experts because he knows that it‚Äôs not really about him as an individual at all. That‚Äôs the draw for Biden in this case, he‚Äôs very good at knowing when to seek expert opinion.

First of all, I think trump is very ignorant and prejudice.  He calls Joe Biden sleepy Biden, how immature.  When he speaks, 85% he is always looking down, not looking at his audience.  He a poor speaker.  Congress is afraid of him.   trump should be IMPEACHED!
In so many words i think Nancy is trying to become President without running. Biden os 75 he can take ill any day, they shouldn't be allowed to run that old. But, if Biden is out ,it will make Kamala President and Nancy vice.. Then we become Sweden...
Good prediction, attempts to justify it as "not controversial at the time" began last year, as though that's a good excuse
My concern was her constant stance against police reform and prison reform and pairing that with Joe Biden who was one of the main heads of the bill that helped create the mass incarceration system that we suffer from. But I could be wrong
45 will not win legitimately. We all know this. He has done too much to the election process for his win to be legitimate in any way.   If Biden doesn‚Äôt win then we must march on the capital. Otherwise America is gone forever.
Whats even more deeply hilarious is that youd expect progressives to vote for him, since in the primary biden said he doesnt need us to win. The 88% of his own party that wants mfa that he straight up said in his frail demented shell of a voice, that hed veto.
You should want both biden and trump to lose.
‚ÄúI asked Kamala to be the last voice in the room. To always tell me the truth, which she will. Challenge my assumptions if she disagrees. Ask the hard questions. Because that‚Äôs the way we make the best decisions for the American people.‚Äù             ‚Äî Joe Biden
Yeah, this is not a good look, DNC.    This is the perfect moment to test  influence with Biden. Have a few quiet words with Joe about this.  These machinations reek of old Democratic party hierarchy. Most of us have tossed such things into the dustbin of history.
If you can't see the writing on the wall you'll fall first... Biden is not going to be sitting President, hes 75, hes gonna succeed to Kamala. Making Nancy vice... Their gonna kill Trump kicking of the civil war. You herd it here first!!

Today's paper. Curious that the cover pic changed the blue fields to purple. Harris' suit; Biden's and THE FLAG. WSJ signals "no threat here" with injection of red into the print. I have mixed feelings about this.
To be fair, Obama is a really gifted speaker and had a slant/style especially suited to the times.   The Squad's recent results in primaries reinforce the idea that Biden is a transitional candidate - as he's said himself. Like AOC, I'm willing to accept the win.

Okay, fair enough. At least you're consistent. There are too many people who, without any apparent awareness of the irony, call Biden "Creepy Joe" while enthusiastically lining up to vote for the Donald.
Biden and Harris have exactly one job for the next 82 days: Win. We have one job: Help them.
Biden isn't accused of rape. He's accused of sexual harassment/assault. He's not "definitely a rapist."   Trump, on the other hand, has been sued for forcible rape of a 13 year old.

Finally!  made one decent decision by having  as the VP. My sidelined vote is finally shifting to democrats. Mrs Harris is smart, logical! She would destroy anyone in debates. Hell! She destroyed Biden in presidential debates! Exciting!!
Thank you for stating your stance. I disagree w/your opinion of Biden. Even with ethics concerns, he isn't a war criminal, will not encourage physical attacks on his fellow Americans or side w/racists. We can't have 4 more years of Trump. A Biden victory is the only hope we have.
Warren really simped to Biden for this lmao
I mean, it's a shit sandwich or a shit sundae.  Obviously I will vote for a Biden / Harris ticket, but I sure as fuck ain't happy about it.
McCain needed to swing for the fences. Biden just needed to not die before Election Day.
Of course Biden, who pioneered the 1994 Crime Bill, picked a cop to be his VP. It's all coming full circle...
Let‚Äôs get together and make demands Or they lose our vote. While Biden is not a great option he presents a somewhat reasonable future for us to actually be able to fix. We have to use the rights we fought for to gain the rights we deserve!
More women prison guards! Lets vote in sarah palin too!!! My brain is warped to ignore that biden wrote the crime bill qnd kamala is a cop. During the middle of the riots.
Well then ‚Äústatistically‚Äù Biden has already won the election...
If Biden/Harris lose then the haters will be like: ‚Äúsee, I told you they‚Äôre not electable‚Äù or ‚Äúomg! How did they lose?‚Äù  If they win, it burnish their ‚Äúleft creds‚Äù by complaining about it for the next 4 years and say, ‚Äúhey I was criticizing them from BEFORE they were elected!‚Äù

Any Democrat, or person who would normally vote for Biden, but now instead will vote "Green party" because of Kamala Harris being picked as VP, I just say this to you:  Donald Trump thanks you for your support.
For the record, I'll vote for Biden / Harris in November.  I'm very depressed by that, but I've decided that if Trump &amp; the GOP win - it's 100% game-over for the planet &amp; a triumph for ruthless white power authoritarianism. #Election2020 #GOP #FascistTrump #ClimateChange #MAGAts
I say we work to put Biden/Harris in the White House and also take back the Senate. Then we strong arm Schumer and put Warren in as Senate Majority Leader.
Biden: "I will pick a woman!"  Chris: "I wonder what that means for my chances?"
He takes the exact opposite lesson he should here. The endorser of biden. Got you nowhere did it.

Kamala Harris, a former Champaign-Urbana resident, chosen to be Joe Biden's running mate
Alright Biden, I‚Äôll give it to you that Kamala Harris is a great choice for VP! Makes me more enthusiastic about my vote than I might otherwise have been!
I said for months it was gonna be Harris he made the logical choice She will be Biden‚Äôs bulldog against Trump
Biden and Kampala LMAO I want trump another 4 honestly
OK Biden pic Harris you think Trump will get desperate Don pants and try and take on Nikki Haley as VP?
Let‚Äôs hope Biden and Harris appoint Warren to a cabinet position after they win in November. The country needs her leadership, courage, and experience üòé
and  are winning team! They‚Äôve got my vote!
and  are a winning team! They‚Äôve got my vote!
Joe Biden picks Sen. Kamala Harris to be his vice presidential running mate
Biden. Harris. Let‚Äôs go!
Biden and Harris will square off against Trump and Pence for the Presidency.
Joe Biden will team with California Senator Kamala Harris.
Biden/Harris vs Trump/Pence. We have our candidates.
Joe Biden has picked his running mate.
‚ÄúJoe Biden here. Big news: I've chosen Kamala Harris as my running mate.‚Äù #BidenVP
Drop that VP name Biden....I‚Äôm ready to see who it is going to be
I feel like the conventional wisdom is (was?) that the VP narrative had become toxic for Biden (e.g., he's "late" because he's "not happy") but meanwhile nobody on twitter dot com can stop talking about how excited they are to hear his pick and talk about his pick and...
OK Joe Biden has picked his running mate now either shit or get off the pot quit dragging it out tell us already
. is the youngest  delegate in #Illinois. He talked to  about casting his vote remotely, as the Democratic National Convention approaches.
So unless the Biden campaign is going to throw a fast one on everyone, looks like it'll be Susan Rice or Val Demmings for the VP pick.
I expect Harris will be the Attorney General in a Biden Administration
So the list of speakers at this year‚Äôs Democratic National Convention have been announced and it includes slots for the running mate &amp; for Whitmer, Warren, Harris, Bottoms, and Duckworth. So, my guess is Biden is picking Susan Rice
who on the Biden team thought it was smart to send this tweet out?
He is actively working with Republicans in swings states to steal votes from Biden.  I take offense to that.  If Trump wins it's to his benefit.  He's a millionaire, he'll bask in the tax breaks. Don't be fooled into thinking he cares about you or this country.   Cancel this man.
But Trump‚Äôs deferral of employee payroll tax, for workers making less than $104,000 does real damage. It takes away hundreds of billions of dollars from Social Security. It helps precisely no one who is unemployed, since you have to be employed.
Perspective | With Biden likely to pick a Black woman as VP, here‚Äôs how the media can avoid playing into sexist and racist tropes
I want Joe Biden to win. I‚Äôll vote for him regardless of who he chooses as his VP. This is a make or break election. Ejection of the current occupant is paramount. There are other critical spots to fill, as well. We need sisters on the Supreme Court and Cabinet.
This is the DNC list of speakers, not necessarily knowing who Biden has picked.
Yet his handlers call Biden's faculties into question. Sad.
I mean unless Biden chooses Satan I don't - well...no even then still the better choice.
He probably has a slam for all of them ready to go soon as they announce Biden‚Äôs running mate
Saw my first ‚ÄúRepublicans for #biden‚Äù yard sign today.  Hope springs eternal.
Doubling down on a comm strategy that contestably but systemically fell short in 2016, when Biden's relative polling 2020 against Trump is not much better than where Hillary was in 2016, is inadvisable. There are alternatives, such as solidarity in action with struggling people.
I'm there.  Can't wait to have a cocktail out in public with those who helped Biden win and then kicked the virus in the ass.  I'm in the retribution camp.  I want Kamala as VP because I think she'll want to set an example and not 'heal' or 'move on', and push Joe to do so.
It‚Äôs not a zero-sum choice for everyone in terms of effect. This isn‚Äôt to say that anyone who doesn‚Äôt want to vote for Biden should vote for Biden (not voting for gross sex offending dudes is a pretty good moral line IMHO), but don‚Äôt act like there aren‚Äôt consequences to that.
(Cont from previous thread) I‚Äôm going to say Trump benefits. And I‚Äôm probably going to lose an absolute shitload of follows (and that‚Äôs fine), but‚Ä¶I mean, fuck Biden, I wanted Sanders or further left, but, as a trans person? Who‚Äôs in office actually matters some to me.
...without printing money? Yes. Does that mean we shouldn't do it? Of course not, those people need help and it's not their fault. We're prosperous enough to take this on the chin if we have good, smart leadership. Is that a good reason to vote Biden &gt; Trump? Yep. The idea...
Worse, that we leave ourselves open to manipulation. We create a space that amplifies the message ‚Äúfuck the current system, fuck Trump, fuck Biden, R &amp; D are the same‚Äù really, really loudly and consistently, but we also close ourselves off from the local‚Ä¶
And this isn‚Äôt me saying that I want TERFs in my timeline or conservatives or a shitload of conciliatory liberals or Never Trump Republicans. But my timeline went from, for example, a mix of people who will and won‚Äôt vote for Biden to basically no one who will vote for Biden.

Yet even while admitting that Russia is once again mounting a covert campaign to help Trump, William Evanina felt compelled to balance this inconvenient reality by also saying what Trump wants to hear: that China and Iran favor Biden‚Äôs election.
At this point, Biden could name the Loch Ness Monster as a running mate, and I'd be all like "Nessie 2020."
Didn't he just have an ad that highlighted how bad it was that Biden was going to cut Social Security? This guy has no strategy
That best be false. You think true Americans like the squad and Biden are worth the time harrassing. Their mindset is mine. The only difference is that your bullshit whining doesn't get the coverage when you address me. You are attention whores. Just calling you out on that.
If Biden wins it will literally be Nov. 4th when they clutch their pearls about debt and the deficit.
Kamala Harris could be Joe Biden's VP pick. Here's what you need to know.

A Biden Presidency is bad for Russia
Didn't George Will write an entire column why Biden should pick Bass?   I don't know a lot about her. But that endorsement meant a lot to me.
No....because then the Rethuglicans could nominate someone that could actually beat Biden. Biden is very beatable now, but he's got the "anyone but Trump" vibe going for him. If Trump is out of the picture, then Biden can be beaten.
*who Biden's campaign picked as his running mate
‚ÄúWhitmer, who has been ‚Äúfully vetted‚Äù as a possible vice-presidential pick by Joe Biden, is fully implicated in the big business drive to return to work.‚Äù
He just wants to get beyond November, and if that leaves a giant dookie on the doorstep of the next administration, that's "future Trump's" or "future Biden's" problem.
Brittany Cooper gets on my last nerve. She hates Biden and takes every opportunity to go off on him whenever she can. #TheBest

Even if Biden picks Susan Rice and all the idiots start yelling about it again, I will continue to refuse to learn what Benghazi is
Joe Biden is not able to finish a sentence on his own sentence unless he is saying some racist shit. You cannot be serious.
You can‚Äôt be President if you have FELONIES on your record. Nor can you hold ANY public office.  I‚Äôm sure the whole family will each have FELONY convictions on their records. And I‚Äôm pretty damn sure President Biden won‚Äôt be commuting their sentences or pardoning them...

I hate to tell Christians this, but if Joe Biden can hurt God, he‚Äôs not much of a God to begin with.
They did that back in 2016 pretended to be Black lives matter. They will also pretend to be Sanders supporters and Biden supporters to play both sides against each other. I was a troll hunter back in 2015 and since then. I can tell some things the most of you do not know.
Wat for it this is only just getting started, he reaching for straws to find something to stick to Biden ,won't happen we are all smarter than he and the repubs know.
Where's the Bible that Biden  hurted? Or is it under audit?
you have seen the horror of this administration and still it will come down to who biden picks as VP". you are the white woman we were warned about.
I prefer science over gods, but respect Biden for supporting science while following his god.
Waiting for the Biden account to just tweet ‚ÄúHAIL SATAN‚Äù
Hahahahaha! I‚Äôm surprised that Humpty Trumpty hasn‚Äôt accused ‚ÄúPresident‚Äù Biden of eating babies! üë∂He‚Äôs doing what he‚Äôs supposed to do based on how his state voted. Also, this is how Bernie supporters get to tell the party to keep evolving the platform. Democracy works when our voices are heard. He still needs to earn our votes.
Just imagining the Biden/Harris administration with a Democrat controlled House and Senate and all the things they won‚Äôt get done for 2 years til they lose both chambers again
Vote for Biden! This Country depends on you! BTW WELCOME‚ù§Ô∏è
are you aware Krystal Ball Rising on fb has become a vote blue no matter what - Biden site?
So because I'm a Christian that makes me an automatic Trump supporter?    Now, what if I supported Biden? Would that make me a supporter of a pedophile? I'm trying to understand your logic here.   By the way. I'm not Catholic. That priest thing is irrelevant to me.
Biden's team will make Harris better than what she is imo.
Hush money, that's interesting, apparently you haven't looked into the Ukraine curruption for Biden. Fear not Trump will remind you
No I am voting for Biden no matter what. I dont peddle in conspiracy theories. And thats all you have.
Question is why aren't they following Biden?
Biden and his crew dissing Hillary after she lost was a clue to how he felt.
A vote for Biden isn‚Äôt just a vote for him. It‚Äôs a vote for the rest of the administration and ppl who hold high rank in varies offices. We CANNOT afford to have another four years of folks who are on the far right in those seats. Remember, it‚Äôs more then Biden.
In the end it's on Joe Biden to beat Donald Trump.   He was nominated to win back Wisconsin Michigan and Pennsylvania at the minimum.... that means white voters.  Harris is an insurance policy with Brown voters. If she can boost black and Asian voter intensity, great.
Joe Biden winning a 4th grade spelling bee. Camel Hairs passing an STD screening.
Huh? He Said libtards mad because Trump stopped them from locking up Black Americans.... Which is true. Trump's First step act went against Biden's 94 crime bill to lock up non violent drug criminals.
Thank you president Biden
The federal mask mandate suggested in Biden‚Äôs BS is just another symptom of his blatantly apparent dementia. His handlers really got this wrong. #MAGA2020
Checked my wife's registration and she was ok. So neither one of us voted since we cancelled we others vote. The idea is to trim the vote so Biden does not gain a vote.
Biden is a southern dem.... and folks underestimated him... I'll be the first to admit I did.  Locking SC down defending the ACA is why he's nominee.   Black older voters liked the loyalty to Obama.
They don't have that power. You're giving them too much credit. Their main play this week is Birtherism against a woman from Oakland when they had better things to hit Biden/Harris with.
I think that Biden is a flawed candidate but that Trump is an amoral, sociopathic narcissist whose Administration is anti-life and white supremacist, if not in explicit creed then in implemented policies.
had to admit, the Liberals owners of   dictates what they talk about.  And  is feeding suggestions to Harf to bolster Joe Biden  mask mandate. Weird, she told Trump he couldn't mandate states to do anything. What changed Dana?
Stephen Colbert compares political ideology of Biden, Harris to 'Rockefeller Republicans'    Colbert you don‚Äôt know üí© from shinola!
If it wasn't for Floyd I think Klobuchar is VP.   Look she knew what the climate was took her self out and Took A clipboard to Warren's VP chances as well.  JOE BIDEN OWES HER... For all we  know Amy and  kamala talks. Not everything has to be public.
Biden Harris 2020: very sad to have to vote for you

I hope that when Biden/Harris walk into the White House Kamala kicks that front door open!!!
Here‚Äôs hoping Biden/Harris can execute this plan
Nah I‚Äôm not I got 25 on the ACT . That‚Äôs the sad part . I‚Äôm not smarter than many who simply refuse to see how this system works . Again if you think Biden will win put money on it
Thinking about how cool it would be if hunter Biden replaced Joe Biden and Kamalas dad replaced kamala
As a Black American I‚Äôve watched  do more for the Black community than Obama &amp; Biden (who did nothing)!  - School Choice   - Opportunity Zones   - First Step Act (criminal justice reform)   - Economic Opportunity &amp; Growth   - HBCU Funding (permanent)
PSA: I understand once again that Biden/Harris AREN‚ÄôT the dream team we need- but now isn‚Äôt the time to create viral tweets pointing those flaws out. Same reason as why third party voting this November is a vote for 45. We need to encourage all voters to elect Biden y‚Äôall.
Don't worry everyone I heard Joe Biden is the most electible Democrat so we should be fine
when I hear joe biden speak
Anyway, you can lampoon Biden all you want (and God knows I have and will continue to!), but the notion that Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama are somehow more politically skilled than him is not the slam-dunk case their doofus aides might think it is.
whites *who were really never in any danger of ever receiving a college degree*: trump: 64%, Biden 34% - Fixed it.
It use to be. Biden-Harris want to take away your freedoms
On the other hand, the Obama and Clinton teams‚Äô dismissiveness of Biden‚Äôs natural political skills is fairly typical of how dumb, insular and naval-gazing a lot of these people are.
It‚Äôs extremely easy in hindsight to criticize Obamaworld for hitching their wagon to Clinton instead of his own VP in 2016. But it wasn‚Äôt obvious at the time how serious Biden was about running, and she seemed like a natural successor.
üòÆHow Trump could lose the popular vote by 5M and still win
‚Äúexcuse me sir i need to hold you accountable for your problematic actions‚Äù i scream as Joe Biden‚Äôs jackbooted thugs toss me into an unmarked minivan for the Crime of having a bag of oregano on my person after leaving whole foods market
Idk what ur talking about cuz we‚Äôve always been allowed to........in fact she actively (!!) encourages it.................like ppl collectively dragged her when she said she‚Äôll be voting for Biden months ago
Just not pretending that my concerns aren't just him not being my "first choice" I feel like too many people love to gaslight the "Bernie bros"  It's annoying. Trump is the one we should blame. Not the people who actively work against him AND Biden
And sure maybe we'll all reluctantly vote for him when the time comes, but the problem is, it's not a matter of not being my first choice-- it's a matter of I, and others, are legitimately terrified of Biden as well. So I'm fine with people giving me reasons to vote for him,
HERE Comes The Bullshit. #FridayThoughts
What bothers me is people minimizing my concerns with Biden. I 1000% agree it's probably worth it, because yeah Trump is THAT dangerous. But I just feel like no one's listening to my concerns about how legitimately scared a lot of us are if Biden as well
For these very reasons (these issues being ignored) I'm also voting -against- Trump, but I can't bring myself to vote -for- Biden either.
I would never expose you üíñ And youre completely right. Your points are all valid. I don't mind people convincing me to vote for Biden. When it comes down to it I might do that. I agree with all your points
Forgive me if I'm not all excited about Kamala Harris being named as Biden's pick for VP. She's still a politician and how many politicians have you known that were genuinely for the people?
‚ÄúShe was mean to me and not nice like all women should be, and also she probably wasn‚Äôt born in the US cuz I‚Äôm racist and a baby and I can‚Äôt stand losing‚Äù ‚Äî Pres. Tr*mp on Kamala as Biden‚Äôs VP
It is privileged AF to not be planning to vote for Biden and Harris.
. . .and I always suspected Biden was a dick - but I'm not including a picture. . . .
YOU ALREADY COLLAPSED OUR COUNTRY TRUMP! BIDEN IS GOING TO FIX YOUR MESS. YOU ARE THE WORST POTUS EVER!
Hmm funny when Joe Biden mispronounces it though isnt it?
That should be too hard to do since million have lost the only income they had and do not have any money to buy anything. We are faced with the most grievous condition as we sit on the cliff over a long fall and there is one way off of it, vote Biden/Harris on Nov3.
It's gonna be a while. Even if Joe Biden wins, the crazy runs deep here.

Joe Biden wants to increase police funding. He is NOT advocating for police reform.   How is better again?
I wonder why   &amp; the other race-baiting grifters don‚Äôt call #Biden out on it.   Yet, President  the guy y‚Äôall irrationally hate, has championed the First Step Act undoing much of this inqeuality.   So tell me who‚Äôs the true ‚Äúracist‚Äù?!
In Biden‚Äôs 1994 Crime Bill he literally prohibited grants &amp; funding to anyone who is held in prison. This disproportionately hurt Black Americans.  So you want to talk about inequality?  is responsible for much of it.   Instead of promising to reform such he defends it.
Vote Biden Harris because literally we are living in an absolutely failed state right now.

that‚Äôs my point. the ad is made by them for trump and yet the symbolism supports their opposition and makes Biden look better when clearly they want trump to look stronger here
What these folks don't realize is that the focus right now needs to be on excising the tumor. Refusing to vote for Biden won't do anything but hand #45 another 4 years.

Trump doesn‚Äôt want to test because then people will have coronavirus; he doesn‚Äôt want to fund the post office because then people will vote for Joe Biden. He is a spoiled child, not a president, and he is destroying our country. ü§¨
Agreed.
The Biden campaign, Democrats and all Americans should raising hell over this. Trump is admitting he wants to rig this election.

Not sure what the plan is when they run a handsome guy against Biden in 4 years and he gets smoked
Biden just asked for everyone to wear a face mask. Wentso  far as asked all governors to mandate there use. Said it will save 40 000 lives.   As a side note if you do wear  a mask until the vaccine arrives you automatic know you can wait to see if it is real.

Pretty cool that if Biden loses we can blame toxic KHive Twitter users and if he wins we can prove toxic Twitter supporters aren't a real detriment
Neither Biden nor Harris have ever said that. You have nothing to contribute to a meaningful debate. Crawl back to your hole and prepare yourself for decades in the political wilderness.
100% with you there, I knocked enough ‚Äúliberal‚Äù doors for Bernie to know how your average working class voter felt about Obama and Biden once the platitudes wore off. Spoiler: they felt abandoned.
Biden/Kamala reveal their "Crime Diversity Bill" which aims to close racial gap in prison populations by just arresting more white people
BABY, IT‚ÄôS YOU VOTING FOR BIDEN IN NOVEMBER!
Honestly, this really made me wanna vote for Biden instantly. Liked seeing those elbow in action üëçüèΩ
Well you know what Joe Biden said.
You can hate the two party system. You can hate that the presidential candidate isn‚Äôt more progressive. But Biden isn‚Äôt even in the same zip code as Trump when it comes to tearing down the democratic process here. No progressive ideas will see the light of day in Trump‚Äôs America.
I keep hearing from people that they aren‚Äôt enthused or that they hate the idea of settling. Look, I get it. So few people at the start of this had Biden as their candidate (I know I didn‚Äôt). So we‚Äôre all dealing with some disappointment. But every liberal cause is now at stake.

This new Pixar movie likes wild. Tom Hanks voices Biden and Trump?
All in on Biden/Harris and pretty excited about it too!  #SuburbsForBiden #momala
Fun fact: real American trains&amp;railroads are actually more alike to the handcar driven by Biden.
Ask yourself, ‚ÄúHow much is America worth?‚Äù Then donate to Biden/Harris 2020. America deserves it.
I‚Äôm tired of y‚Äôall saying Kamala Harris is this and that and did this to black community.  We don‚Äôt have a 3rd choice/party.   It‚Äôs either Biden/Harris or Trump/Pence. So just go out and vote when it‚Äôs time and stop complaining. Arrghh!
Slept on it and still not feeling this Joe Biden and Kamala Harris ticket #KamalaHarrisVP
‚ÄúBut Biden‚Äù
Joe Biden: Trash Kamala: Trash Trump: Trash Kanye: Trash  Y‚Äôall: it‚Äôs so important that we go out and vote.   Me:
Voting for Democrats is voting for future Marxism. Even if it's voting for "moderate" candidates such as Joe Biden..
I mean whatever you think of Harris and Biden there's zero moral argument to vote for Trump
She‚Äôs talk more in one day then Biden has in six months!  Who is going to be Kamala‚Äôs running mate? Biden won‚Äôt make it past the Democratic convention
Let me ask you: what kind of volunteer work have you done in black communities to help recently?  Racism and sexism are both very real, and Kamala Harris can also still be a cop that helped the systems we should rebel against.   I can vote for Biden/Harris and hate the ticket.
(2/2) d Kamala Harris  *three minutes later*  (1/2) We are happy to announce the 2020 Democratic Party ticket of Joe Biden an
By March next yr if Biden wins the virus will show sign of slowing down. We need to remember Obama and Joe got the CDC  setup to handle pandemic by focusing on testing and separating the sick in the population.
*whisper* Biden wants to cut SS too
you convict a black Trump supporter for real I‚Äôm with you not for Biden but you. So if that means he must be #1 then fuck it. I‚Äôm with you. I been talking about you since you been elected as a Republican that was brought in through Trump.
"[Trump] inherited the longest economic expansion in history from Barack Obama and Joe Biden. And then, like everything else he inherited, he ran it straight into the ground,"  said.  I can‚Äôt wait for her to just be brutal as hell for 3 months
Stfu bitch. I‚Äôm a republican who voted for Trump in 16‚Äô but I promise you I will vote for Biden because Kamala is in the most respectful way a black woman because she not for bs and don‚Äôt go against right.
I have been saying this since the primaries ended. It‚Äôs not as far left as I‚Äôd like but it‚Äôs moving. And that‚Äôs hopeful.
Boy Biden a clown wtf this bitch not it !
so I‚Äôm watching trump talk and he‚Äôs reacting to Sen. Harris. Saying that she talked all this crap about Biden n that she did this, that and the other. He‚Äôs desperate
you must've haven't heard biden speak either. it needs to be an age limit on presidency 60 or younger
I thought early on Trump would refuse to debate any Democratic nominee, with the possible exception of Biden. He thinks Biden can‚Äôt hurt him in a debate. Joe is the quintessential hail fellow well met back slapping bro. He doesn‚Äôt know how to go for the jugular. Trump knows this.
Sure. I preferred other candidates, too. Doesn‚Äôt mean I‚Äôm gonna sit around and just complain about Biden‚Äôs flaws. There is plenty in his plans that I endorse. Much more than Trumps, to be sure.
I‚Äôm probably in the top 90th percentile of being good at people and Biden is in the 99th and let me tell you that is a fucking skill set that takes time and years to hone and acquire. Diplomacy saves financial/social capital too, but I‚Äôm sure I don‚Äôt need to tell Biden that
Joe Biden is üí° just not Twitter üí°
Arguments for Biden: Trump is Bad Supreme Court needs dems Representation? ü•¥
Done! Are these people who were never voting for Biden? If not, I don‚Äôt get how Kamala makes the ticket worse.
Don‚Äôt get on here and wax lyrical about communism comrade if you voting Biden/Harris like literally do not.
Literally if you‚Äôre voting Biden/Harris just stfu and do it because even *you* know your arguments are not being made for the right reasons
Missed the Biden/Harris speeches since I was busy watching the best 6 year old on his bike! (My nephew) Eager to see them, sounds like we won‚Äôt have to worry about senile or basement crap
#ChrisWallace: #Trump Wishes #Biden Had Picked Anyone But #KamalaHarris"
She is a good politian. She and Biden is what this country desperately need. It's time cancel the failed reality TV show that has been going on for the last 4 years.
This is a great message of hope being delivered by Biden and Harris.
I‚Äôm not denying any of what you said. Strategic &amp; pragmatic as in: more left than Biden but not as left as Warren; robust Senate experience; ran a presidential campaign; brings a lot of diversity; will still get the youth vote (despite lack of enthusiasm for her)
‚Äúhe inherited the longest economic expansion in history from barack obama and joe biden. and then, like everything else he inherited, he ran it straight into the ground‚Äù ‚Äî has entered the chat
PLEASE pay attention to the mistakes of our past. And those mistakes include sleeping at the wheel when a Dem is in office!! Let‚Äôs turn Washington blue, fight like hell for change at the local level on shit like police reform, and hold Biden more accountable than we did Obama.
Biden and Kamala have some gross shit in their past, but they can‚Äôt change that, and we can‚Äôt change who is on the ballot. And the harder we push the ‚Äúboth parties are bad, the system is broken‚Äù line, the less fired up people are gonna be. Fewer votes ALWAYS fucks the Dems.
I started watching the press conference,  listening to Biden and Harris and the uncontrollable smile came accross my face.
Live look in at the White House where Trump is watching Biden/Harris torch him:
Besides Klobuchar, I think Harris was the most pragmatic and strategic VP pick for Biden
Please vote Biden /Harris on Nov 3.
Biden Harris vs Trump Pence. Love vs hate Hope vs despair Possibilities vs impossiblities Progressive vs just about him Forward vs backwords All of us vs only about me  Which one speaks for you?  Biden/Harris will work for ALL Americans, not just the ones who voted for him.
Yesterday‚Äôs VP announcement has some of y‚Äôall wilding. So you aren‚Äôt going to vote for Biden/Harris because you don‚Äôt like them, but you hate Trump and think he needs removed from office? Maybe I‚Äôm confused....AN option was given, and you won‚Äôt take it?
Joe Biden is ripping Trump to shreds and the fact FOX is carrying it live has to be driving 45 crazy. His briefer will be one to watch.
Biden just said ‚Äú closed your eyes and remember the Neo Nazis from 3 years ago in Charlottesville‚Äù
I love the sound of the Biden/Harris Administration. Listening to Joe now. I feel hopeful again.
As the old saying goes ‚Äú give me a break ‚Äú - Joe Biden
Every time I say ‚ÄúSo we voting for Biden right!?‚Äù People look down at they feet and look sad...üòîüò≠So is Cocoa Puff going to vote for Biden or are they sworn enemies?
Yea Joe Biden did so well with H1N1 virus they told states to quit testing, nobody wore mask, so basement Joe &amp; #HeelsUpHarris can g to hell #outnumbered
Absolutely not, I wear it when it is justified, Biden is an idiot
Correction, when Hills tried to ‚ÄúRIG it‚Äù so she‚Äôd win and it backfired in her face! What a cheater! She‚Äôs so corrupt it‚Äôs sick. Killary is the puppet masterüëø behind Biden. Go against her and ya die. Biden couldn‚Äôt win Uno for God sakes!
Literally only voting for Biden to get Trump out. Of all the options, he was like, fourth on my list. Maybe, MAYBE third.
Most realistically joe Biden would get run over by the train after becoming confused and stepping on tracks.
So true, let‚Äôs not forget Obama &amp; Gates funded the lab in China to intentionally cause this mess during Trumps term! It‚Äôs not a question of right vs. left, it‚Äôs right vs. wrong! Funny how Biden owns an island next to Epstein‚Äôs. Wtf?
The level of pure corruption and incompetence within the DNC makes this Biden-Harris Presidential pairing hilariously unsurprising.
Telling how you hide the fact your a Biden supporter and hate Trump.
#HeelsUpHarris is a phony, and her laugh is annoying as hell, between Biden‚Äôs gaffes and her phoniness they make the perfect dumb and dumber
I expected more from Biden's speech. Yawn!!
Another Biden ooops.  He is really full of himself now as he was then, so what change?  Nothing, still full of Sh**
The same 6 in 10 think Biden is going to be President.  Donald J. Trump will be the President after the next election!!
Wasn't Biden the Catholic on the Obama/Biden ticket?
Willie Brown was Biden's chance?
Biden spent his life stealing from us and getting pay offs for him and his family You on the other had slept your way to were you are today
This about sums it up. I will be voting for Biden/Harris.
She also called Biden a racist. Do you purposely not mention that?
Way to go Biden #HeelsUpHarris
Just a reminder that Biden still technically doesn't have enough delegates
After watching that clip of Joe Biden riding his bike, I have come to the conclusion that he missed the all-time best setup for a "jo mamma" joke.   I will no longer be voting for him.
Biden hasn‚Äôt got any brain cells... everyone can see that. It‚Äôs so frustrating how people can‚Äôt see the evil George Soros started. So many fell for it and we‚Äôve gone backwards 100 years.
Black male leaders warn Biden ‚Äòwill lose‚Äô election if he doesn't name Black female running mate   I thought you‚Äôre suppose to pick the most qualified not what color their skin is, identity politics by the Democrats typical
Everyone thinks Joe Biden is the saviour, but he keeps telling us who he really is when he says he'll veto Med4all, tells his donors and super PACs nothing will change, cut SS which he's tried again&amp;again &amp; continue w constant war &amp; overthrow other countries president.
Just like you did with the H1N1 virus, where you stopped testing, ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ Biden the basement dweller
I really hope so. I'm disabled and now I'm forced to find a new place to live and my sister said she would get a place with me, but we just fall short of the income we need and my disability hardly gets me by. I'm praying for you Joe Biden. üòéüôèüèº
HOW Fake Fox News discredits talking point of right wing radio. Establishment stopped talking abt Covid 19 to spread lies abt Biden. All right wing media focusing on Biden. Distraction is being used to avoid talking abt the pandemic &amp; trumps failures.
Happy colonoscopy prep day to me.   Still better than a Biden speech.
Where‚Äôs  suspending your account for lying, oh that right twitter only attack conservatives. You‚Äôre a a liar and Marxist, Biden the basement dweller will never be President and America will never a socialist country.
The corp Dems and Republicans don‚Äôt care that DT passed an executive order  bec they both wanted to end soc security &amp; now they don‚Äôt have to deal with the stimulus for the American ppl, if DT doesn‚Äôt do it Biden will surely do it.
Like Trump‚Äôs list of infractions doesn‚Äôt include Biden‚Äôs list and more not to mention he‚Äôll tell whatever he thinks you want to hear - i.e., hes a two-faced liar.
Not! I don‚Äôt like to be mean however why did he get rid of the pandemic team we didn‚Äôt need? Seemed Biden and Obama knew we needed one!
Sad the Democrats cheer because people are unemployed they want to keep America closed, they fear monger and spread political propaganda. Worst run states and cities, are run by Democrats. They support basement dweller Biden,ü§£ü§£ #Trump2020Victory #WalkAwayFromDemocratsForever
I'm Joe Biden and I forgot where I am again. Can you call me a cab?
You can use my phrase, Biden B Hiding.
Best person for the job President Trump, basement dwellers like Biden won‚Äôt do it.
U can see it in his eyes that their is something wrong w Biden. For the Corp Dems 2use him 2secure the status quo is grossly disgusting. That's why they're looking 4a right winger VP 2 make all the decisions. This is similar 2Ronald Reagan who had alzheimers &amp; was protected by WHIs he freaking joking?  "Nothing will change",  "I will veto Medicare for all" now badly needs progressives?  Well this progressive does not need you:
Kamala was born in Oakland, California. California jokes and un-naturally born jokes aside, she's a natural-born citizen. There are a vast number of far more important issues with Kamala than this, and going Birther 2.0 would be playing into her and Biden's hand.
I haven‚Äôt seen anything about President Trump playing golf since COVID 19 began Joe Biden and Kamala Harris day nothing but lies!!!
Vote for Biden who doesn't want to be a DICTATOR!
#KamalaHarris is another #metoo hypocrite #BelieveAllWomen Biden assaulted #TaraReade
Do the Democrats think the world is as gullible as they are? They would think the VP choice is the greatest even if Biden picked Minnie Mouse
has done more Greenstuff through private enterprise than Biden ever did in his entire career as a Senator.  #PatHeads #PutThatInYourPipe
When you revealed your true feelings about Joe Biden it brought tears to my eyes.  My question is, are you ignoring those feelings and memories in exchange for sycophancy, money, and power? I hope not.
#faceoftyranny #poserjoe  Joe Biden And Kamala Harris Call For Mask Mandates Nationwide To Prevent Coronavirus  via
They found a way to trash Trump and try to steal credit for Trump's success and cover their own FAILED policies. Biden and Obama despised Israel and supported Iran. Who are they kidding? Very little coverage from the left. But they had #poserpresbiden press conference.
Poser 'President' Biden told them to mandate mask wearing outside. It's not about your rights.
Biden is trying to take credit of this semi-non deal you refer to.
When I watched your press conference with Joe Biden I realized that Joe made a brilliant choice.  I was proud and excited that you and Joe will be representing me in November. I can hardly wait until our incompetent narcissistic president is thrown out of office.
It is, and  says this for why they need to vote: It raises the sea level.  The less Biden loses by in any GOP stronghold, the less votes he needs to pull out of Democratic strongholds.  Or, the more he wins by and the more we repudiate Trumpism.
I predict it helps Biden squeak out a victory in Illinois
To all the Americans who have any doubts whether Joe Biden and Kamala Harris are up to the job, I implore you to watch this video.

Fuck Biden and Harris but we desperately need this. Vote, for God's sake vote.

Will anyone actually keep count?  Kamala Harris Lies Repeatedly in First Speech as Biden‚Äôs Running Mate
I agree. On day one Biden's gonna have all his picks ready to go!
I am already noticing lie-based attack ads against Biden and Harris.put out by your campaign.  One thing that is no lie is your abysmal performance as president.  Your influence is disappearing every day before our eyes, Donny.
The level of pure corruption and incompetence within the DNC makes this Biden-Harris Presidential pairing hilariously unsurprising.
But your main premise is not true. Biden did not propose that we ban fracking.
Great to see Obama in this and not Biden. Biden is too demented to fight anyone lol
pro slavery, I realize I have to put all the bs asside and vote for the side that doesn't have someone trying to bring back slavery, because lets face it if Biden wins, his vp is the real president. Seriously please don't support her, don't support slavery.
Biden is a corrupt senile old man and Harris kept valuable information that would have proven without a doubt that a man was innocent, she was in favor of making marijuana illegal and laughed about jailing people even though she herself has smoked it, she-
Damn they found all 50 Biden supporters!
Be realistic, do you want trump? Because no one else but Biden stands a chance. And have you seen immigration nation? Those cages weren‚Äôt for children. The Obama administration wanted immigrants who were criminals out, not everyone who came here illegally. It‚Äôs trump or Biden.
Workers of those companies come up with the ideas and you think their money trickles down to the middle class. We it doesn‚Äôt moron. The Trump tax cut didn‚Äôt do anything for me. It only helped rich people. Biden will change that. 83 days üòò ‚ÄúI work when I want to‚Äù. Lmao.
And Biden promotes China.
83 days. Biden-Harris is easily going to win me $1200. Thanks for betting me Stinky. üòòüòò
Telling how you hide the fact your a Biden supporter and hate Trump.
First of all, who‚Äôs the idiot reporter that just asked Trump about Antifa and the Biden/Harris campaign.  Second of all, can reports just start saying ‚Äúreclaiming my time‚Äù when he goes on these tangents. I just had to mute my TV again. November can‚Äôt come quick enough for me.
It‚Äôs between trump and Biden and they both have allegations. But at least Biden doesn‚Äôt lock up children and separate them from their families
Next President of the United States Joe Biden and the next Vice President Kamala Harris.
She‚Äôs NOT black.  She bashed Biden, what changed.  Oh she maybe President!! Think twice!!
Great Biden gets the white house. We take everything else. Let's get all our friends to join direct groups. üòè
This Kamala Harris, even in a deceased state, is a far better choice than the one Creepy Joe Biden chose.
Yeah in terms of environment Trump is honestly the worst, although with the Biden's mental decline, Kamala will be the real presidential candidate and with what she has done to people and her authoritarian ideals, I don't feel like she's better than Trump.
Although Biden is further to the right than Trump, so how is that going to help the left?
Would you REALLY be expressing those kinds of concerns if the VP were a man? You said "she's VP, not President. People were concerned that she is....blah blah blah....." Check your reality as it relates to having a woman capable of leading the country with Biden.
I'm sorry but I have to disagree with being able to be able get much more done with Biden and Harris. They are both far more to the right than Trump and have been shown to be far more authoritarian and a genuine threat to African Americans.
You know Donny, I found the extremely cruel words you spoke questioning Joe Biden's belief in God, offensive and something a Christian would never say.
Stop watching CNN progressives hate Kamala and Joe Biden. Wake up

How.. Biden supports the Green New Deal..
If you look at the past 2-3 decades we are given George W, war criminal, then insane Palin, and now this turd.  It keeps getting worse.  I think that electing "Nothing will change" Biden will mean that in 4 years we brace ourselves for something even worse than Trump.
You have to look at the pattern here Rocky.  People like Biden, both Clintons, Kerry whose sole purpose in life is allowing corporatist to prevent populist on left to rise are the sole reason of the other party going to extreme right, fascism.  There is no counterbalance.

We have the human and industrial capital in the so-called "Rust Belt" to challenge - if not overtake! - China as the prime producer of renewable energy in the world. The Biden/Harris administration /must/ make that a key plank in its platform for the rest of this decade.
How does Joe Biden know that?!?! He doesn't even remember his own name... Stop making falsified claims you can't back up. #Trump2020 If you have even a single brain cell remaining you will vote for the RIGHT choice. Trump for another 4!!!

Wasn't Biden the Catholic on the Obama/Biden ticket?
She doesn't remember much of Biden but very clear on Comey memories. These hearings have become such a joke. It's been 3 years!
You know Biden debating Trump (or even a fifth grader) would be a train wreck. Biden does not have the mental capacity to become dog catcher.  What a sham.
Biden picked a strong, brave woman of color. A woman of integrity who is not afraid to take a knee to get the job done. Well done, Joe. This is what success smells like.
I'm riding with Biden until the end.  Period.
I‚Äôm not sure if Biden will beat Trump, Kamala Harris is definitely a fucking cop, and Pence is going to get fucking WORKED during those debates with her. If he wasn‚Äôt such a ghoul I‚Äôd kinda feel bad for him but watching that bastard get dog walked is gonna rule.
All the pundits shown on this video are left of center, so you can‚Äôt say some right winger is lying to make Biden look bad.
Poor guy,  he doesn't know how to speak and he always sound like the first speech he ever gave.  I know Biden has his issues, but at least he's not self-centered like Trump is.
Who has confidence in Biden? He can't even remember Obama's name.
I mean with Kamala as VP, she is essentially the president due to Biden's mental deterioration. Considering she's pro slavery and anti pot, are you sure?
Willie Brown was Biden's chance?
Biden spent his life stealing from us and getting pay offs for him and his family You on the other had slept your way to were you are today
Can‚Äôt wait for  and  to play Harris and Biden on  in the coming months
You are going to try to paint her as  radical left but the Democratic ticket of Biden and Harris is clear indication that the party has rejected it, so good luck with that.
Joe Biden didn't fight for anybody but himself and family.
She also called Biden a racist. Do you purposely not mention that?

This is ridiculous.  It was a slip. God I hate defending Trump, but if Biden misspoke in that manner, and Jr, Sean, and the gang jumped on him for it I would be pissed.

Look around what is happening at this moment! Biden will do 1000 times better.
Your father was a great comedian, but also an outstanding actor. He is missed. Political figures are pubic figures. His piece on Biden, like other politicians in his act are fair game. It was also hilarious. Let‚Äôs just leave it at that and not make it political.

Dear biden supporters. Your candidate is incompetent.
Joe Biden says if you vote for trump you ain't black. Joe also says if your white you are racist? Hes white therefore racist. Also blacks are not diverse compared to latinos.
We were talking about Trump but sure let‚Äôs bring up Biden since y‚Äôall know Trump is awful. No the 1994 bill was awful and unlike Trump supporters we accept what Biden has done wrong. Want to talk about the Obama administration and it‚Äôs accomplishments.

She's looking for cover for either voting for Trump again or for not voting for Biden, but for someone else.

Birtherizum is back. GOP really has no imagination. It didn‚Äôt stop Obama and it won‚Äôt stop Biden/Harris
has done more Greenstuff through private enterprise than Biden ever did in his entire career as a Senator.  #PatHeads #PutThatInYourPipe
If elected, Biden would be the first president who graduated from a public university since LBJ.
I don't know what your point is here. Neither of them have any power over how voting works in states, both would've preferred mail-in. Bernie dropped out because Bernie didn't have a path to victory anymore. I voted Bernie, so it's not like I'm super ecstatic that Biden won.
I agree. On day one Biden's gonna have all his picks ready to go!
What is Biden supposed to do to change how voting works? He's had no power in government for 3 years now. That's not his decision.
Great to see Obama in this and not Biden. Biden is too demented to fight anyone lol
pro slavery, I realize I have to put all the bs asside and vote for the side that doesn't have someone trying to bring back slavery, because lets face it if Biden wins, his vp is the real president. Seriously please don't support her, don't support slavery.
Biden is a corrupt senile old man and Harris kept valuable information that would have proven without a doubt that a man was innocent, she was in favor of making marijuana illegal and laughed about jailing people even though she herself has smoked it, she-
Decide. Biden Harris 2020!
Damn they found all 50 Biden supporters!
Be realistic, do you want trump? Because no one else but Biden stands a chance. And have you seen immigration nation? Those cages weren‚Äôt for children. The Obama administration wanted immigrants who were criminals out, not everyone who came here illegally. It‚Äôs trump or Biden.
First of all, who‚Äôs the idiot reporter that just asked Trump about Antifa and the Biden/Harris campaign.  Second of all, can reports just start saying ‚Äúreclaiming my time‚Äù when he goes on these tangents. I just had to mute my TV again. November can‚Äôt come quick enough for me.
I don't understand why this message is targeting me, I want the person to vote no matter what. However, I personally hate the pressure messaging of "vote Biden or else", even though I personally believe it myself. You're just going to turn away potential voters talking like that.
It‚Äôs between trump and Biden and they both have allegations. But at least Biden doesn‚Äôt lock up children and separate them from their families
I‚Äôve been telling people for like half a year now that the time to be complacent for any leadership is over. I‚Äôm voting Biden but I‚Äôm gonna be constantly critical of him and demanding more.
Next President of the United States Joe Biden and the next Vice President Kamala Harris.
She‚Äôs NOT black.  She bashed Biden, what changed.  Oh she maybe President!! Think twice!!
Harris is the first Dem to be on the top of the ticket west of the Rocky Mountains. Biden/Harris are the first candidates in decades to have not gone to an Ivy School.
Yeah in terms of environment Trump is honestly the worst, although with the Biden's mental decline, Kamala will be the real presidential candidate and with what she has done to people and her authoritarian ideals, I don't feel like she's better than Trump.
Although Biden is further to the right than Trump, so how is that going to help the left?
I'm sorry but I have to disagree with being able to be able get much more done with Biden and Harris. They are both far more to the right than Trump and have been shown to be far more authoritarian and a genuine threat to African Americans.
Biden could be a better leader than Trump from his basement.
How.. Biden supports the Green New Deal..
And Biden will refer to her as "the first mainstream(whatever ethnicityTrump chooses) who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice-looking broad who is fun to sniff" No ill wishes to Biden, but I hope she takes over quick.

We have the human and industrial capital in the so-called "Rust Belt" to challenge - if not overtake! - China as the prime producer of renewable energy in the world. The Biden/Harris administration /must/ make that a key plank in its platform for the rest of this decade.
How does Joe Biden know that?!?! He doesn't even remember his own name... Stop making falsified claims you can't back up. #Trump2020 If you have even a single brain cell remaining you will vote for the RIGHT choice. Trump for another 4!!!
I don‚Äôt know why it would be this time, Biden would likely pick a cabinet that‚Äôs as optimal and expert-filled as possible
How many stones do you need?  Those without sin throw the first one.  REALLY!  Biden?  Evil will always prevail!
Biden is Catholic
Good is evil and evil is good!! Crazy and people are blind.  I had a classmate say if he had Mickey Mouse running she would still vote for Biden.  So much Hate out there.  It‚Äôs a war between God and Satan.  If we know the end of the ‚ÄúBook‚Äù we know who wins. üòá
You know Biden debating Trump (or even a fifth grader) would be a train wreck. Biden does not have the mental capacity to become dog catcher.  What a sham.
Biden picked a strong, brave woman of color. A woman of integrity who is not afraid to take a knee to get the job done. Well done, Joe. This is what success smells like.
Who has confidence in Biden? He can't even remember Obama's name.
I mean with Kamala as VP, she is essentially the president due to Biden's mental deterioration. Considering she's pro slavery and anti pot, are you sure?
Obama and Biden left a pandemic plan behind in case something happened, which was then ignored when a pandemic happened. ACA isn't really to blame for this.
#teamKamala all the way. I am glad Joe Biden is comfortable with a strong, ambitious woman by his side. Godspeed.
You are going to try to paint her as  radical left but the Democratic ticket of Biden and Harris is clear indication that the party has rejected it, so good luck with that.
You‚Äôre babbling and running scare!! Biden/Harris 2020
I've been saying ever since it was clear that Bernie was probably gonna lose that I would vote for Biden just because he'll at least be capable of listening to criticism and will fill his administration with experts.  We gotta just pour on the pressure even harder if Biden wins.
Nah, that's a bad take. If you're not feeling Biden then you don't HAVE to vote Biden. Heck, even Biden has said the same thing when talking about the Tara Reade allegations.   You're just alienating people who are on the fence if you say they HAVE to vote Biden.
That's fair. I generally only really push people to really consider voting Biden if they're in battleground states, since their vote might actually make a direct impact on the results.  I want 3rd parties to be a viable option but we gotta get election reform first sadly.
Joe Biden will not only be remembered as a President of the United States but the man who introduced us to our first black female Presidentüá∫üá∏ This is one party I can‚Äôt wait to get started üëç
He did not say that he would veto M4A, here is the direct quote of his response to the question of if he'd veto M4A.  "I would veto anything that delays providing the security and the certainty of health care being available now."
Biden has nothing to do with either 160k+ dead or the recession, and Kamala's healthcare plan would've covered everyone and forced private healthcare to follow stricter regulation.
Of course he did, it's Trump. The man is maximum pettiness personified.  I'd vote for a moldy lemon and stale bread before I voted for Trump, and Biden/Harris at least have some real interesting history and a lot of progressive policy writers pushing the campaign along.
Warren would've been my vote in the primary had the writing not already been on the wall that she was not going to be competitive enough in the primary, so I shifted to Bernie.  If it makes you feel any better, Warren has been a *major* policy adviser for Biden in recent months.
Yall saying you're no longer voting for biden might as well vote for trump
Yay! And the next president after Biden.
I don't know who he could've picked that would've pulled in more progressive and younger voters. Elizabeth Warren is amazing, but people didn't show up for her, and she's just as old as Biden is.
Kamala Harris was honestly probably my top pick for VP (her, Warren, and Susan Rice top 3), she'll be a great choice, assuming that Biden continues to work with Sanders and Warren with his policies.
She's not really polarizing, and especially neither her nor Biden are as divisive as Trump. That's a false equivalence. Listening to Harris interrogate someone is the most exciting thing out there, she's a great speaker.
Biden Harris LFG
If Biden selects Kamala Harris he will be toast. Very vulnerable VP pick
I love how the Biden campaign view the VP selection as the ‚Äúleast risky‚Äù and not helpful or advantageous
So so true ! Like night &amp; day ! Please vote for  Biden to save America ! To God be the Glory !
And yet unlike Trump, Biden will pick an administration and work with qualified experts because he knows that it‚Äôs not really about him as an individual at all. That‚Äôs the draw for Biden in this case, he‚Äôs very good at knowing when to seek expert opinion.
Big step Governor.  Thank you.  I appreciate your integrity, your decency and your willingness to own and act on your convictions.  I hope you end up in Pres. Biden‚Äôs cabinet.
This is ridiculous.  It was a slip. God I hate defending Trump, but if Biden misspoke in that manner, and Jr, Sean, and the gang jumped on him for it I would be pissed.
Look around what is happening at this moment! Biden will do 1000 times better.

Are we sure about that? I know that's the narrative I just don't know a single reason to think it's true. She doesn't do well with the groups Biden needs more of (youth, Latinos), and couldn't even make it to Iowa in the primaries. Sorry to sound like such a naysayer.

Obama's strange outlook on the political situation. A political opportunist just like he was. Harris entered politics thru means most Americans would find disgusting. DO NOT allow her to back/door her way into the presidency.  Biden will be found mentally deficient withing a year

First of all, I think trump is very ignorant and prejudice.  He calls Joe Biden sleepy Biden, how immature.  When he speaks, 85% he is always looking down, not looking at his audience.  He a poor speaker.  Congress is afraid of him.   trump should be IMPEACHED!
In so many words i think Nancy is trying to become President without running. Biden os 75 he can take ill any day, they shouldn't be allowed to run that old. But, if Biden is out ,it will make Kamala President and Nancy vice.. Then we become Sweden...
Good prediction, attempts to justify it as "not controversial at the time" began last year, as though that's a good excuse
My concern was her constant stance against police reform and prison reform and pairing that with Joe Biden who was one of the main heads of the bill that helped create the mass incarceration system that we suffer from. But I could be wrong
45 will not win legitimately. We all know this. He has done too much to the election process for his win to be legitimate in any way.   If Biden doesn‚Äôt win then we must march on the capital. Otherwise America is gone forever.
Whats even more deeply hilarious is that youd expect progressives to vote for him, since in the primary biden said he doesnt need us to win. The 88% of his own party that wants mfa that he straight up said in his frail demented shell of a voice, that hed veto.
You should want both biden and trump to lose.

To be fair, Obama is a really gifted speaker and had a slant/style especially suited to the times.   The Squad's recent results in primaries reinforce the idea that Biden is a transitional candidate - as he's said himself. Like AOC, I'm willing to accept the win.

Biden isn't accused of rape. He's accused of sexual harassment/assault. He's not "definitely a rapist."   Trump, on the other hand, has been sued for forcible rape of a 13 year old.
...evidence standard rather than beyond a reasonable doubt. Regardless of all of that, if the sexual harassment and abuse of the candidate were guiding my decision, it's abundantly clear that Biden would get my vote over Trump, who has COUNTLESS accusers.

Goodness.   Biden campaign just had more humanity in these 2 minutes than the current administration has had in 3.5 years.
Will Joe Biden be the first person to be Vice President in two administrations?  Watching history.
Biden is giving a great speech today....Kamala is that battery in his back! They are looking focused today #BidenHarris2020
If we want to hang on to our democracy, it has to be Biden. Only through democracy can we eventually get to be truly progressive. I‚Äôm 72 years old and don‚Äôt relish the idea of watching my country die ‚Äî which it will under the üçäüí©ü§°
Yes, I do hear what you are saying, but we have just two choices before us. Voting 3rd party gets us tRump again. Maybe it will make you feel righteous when you do it, but it won‚Äôt help the country. And tRump is more dangerous than Biden.
You are being 100% unrealistic. tRump guarantees destruction. Biden gives us a chance to move in the opposite direction. We need that chance or we are utterly doomed. We cannot survive more years of HairHitler. I want to live; I‚Äôm voting blue.
I‚Äôm getting flak from idiots who say we must vote 3rd party because Twitler and Biden are identical. Not sure how people can be that stupid and still function.
Scheduled for 2:50 PM Central, Democrats Joe Biden &amp; Kamela Harris to give first joint remarks as running mates; watch at
Twitler remaining in the White House will spell the complete destruction of American democracy. He MUST be stopped. Biden may not be ideal but he is a step toward what we desperately need. We are on the brink of complete evil.
The point is to prqgmatism, fuck elon musk as a person, you need to hold two thoughts in your head and look at your own infighting. Next thing youl tell me is to vote for neoliberal Biden.
Hey  - how did you get that cool Biden/Harris badge for your Twitter pic?
I also like Yang. I was just confused about your criticism of Bernie when Yang endorsed Biden way before Bernie. That's why I asked.
The significance of this decision for Black women, the loyal members of the Democratic Party, cannot be overstated. Black women‚Äôs commitment to the party has gone unacknowledged, but they have been tirelessly loyal to the Democratic Party for generations.
When people criticize Biden/Harris for things they have absolutely done to harm others, there is no fucking reason to say "well, it's all we got, so we don't have a choice".  THAT IS WHY WE ARE COMPLAINING!    We should never have to be in a position like this.
Ha - you think our country is ready for a president and first lady who truly love each other and want to be together?
Trump says it is an insult to men for Biden to pick a woman running mate
5 Takeaways On The New Biden-Harris Presidential Ticket
The first sentence threw me off - sounded like Biden was saying it would be a waste of time to get the virus under control. Then the second sentence made me think he was saying he would delegate the problem so he doesn‚Äôt have to waste his own time on it. Now I get what he meant.
‚ÄúBiden‚Äôs choice of VP surprises Trump.‚Äù
I have a Biden/Harris yard sign and face mask headed my way! #merch
Finally!  made one decent decision by having  as the VP. My sidelined vote is finally shifting to democrats. Mrs Harris is smart, logical! She would destroy anyone in debates. Hell! She destroyed Biden in presidential debates! Exciting!!
Thank you for stating your stance. I disagree w/your opinion of Biden. Even with ethics concerns, he isn't a war criminal, will not encourage physical attacks on his fellow Americans or side w/racists. We can't have 4 more years of Trump. A Biden victory is the only hope we have.
Warren really simped to Biden for this lmao
I mean, it's a shit sandwich or a shit sundae.  Obviously I will vote for a Biden / Harris ticket, but I sure as fuck ain't happy about it.
McCain needed to swing for the fences. Biden just needed to not die before Election Day.
Of course Biden, who pioneered the 1994 Crime Bill, picked a cop to be his VP. It's all coming full circle...
Let‚Äôs get together and make demands Or they lose our vote. While Biden is not a great option he presents a somewhat reasonable future for us to actually be able to fix. We have to use the rights we fought for to gain the rights we deserve!
More women prison guards! Lets vote in sarah palin too!!! My brain is warped to ignore that biden wrote the crime bill qnd kamala is a cop. During the middle of the riots.
Well then ‚Äústatistically‚Äù Biden has already won the election...
If Biden/Harris lose then the haters will be like: ‚Äúsee, I told you they‚Äôre not electable‚Äù or ‚Äúomg! How did they lose?‚Äù  If they win, it burnish their ‚Äúleft creds‚Äù by complaining about it for the next 4 years and say, ‚Äúhey I was criticizing them from BEFORE they were elected!‚Äù
I‚Äôm upset. To think it couldn‚Äôt get worse than just Biden was a mistakeü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
I wish she could debate 45 instead of Biden!
Any Democrat, or person who would normally vote for Biden, but now instead will vote "Green party" because of Kamala Harris being picked as VP, I just say this to you:  Donald Trump thanks you for your support.
For the record, I'll vote for Biden / Harris in November.  I'm very depressed by that, but I've decided that if Trump &amp; the GOP win - it's 100% game-over for the planet &amp; a triumph for ruthless white power authoritarianism. #Election2020 #GOP #FascistTrump #ClimateChange #MAGAts
I say we work to put Biden/Harris in the White House and also take back the Senate. Then we strong arm Schumer and put Warren in as Senate Majority Leader.
Biden: "I will pick a woman!"  Chris: "I wonder what that means for my chances?"
He takes the exact opposite lesson he should here. The endorser of biden. Got you nowhere did it.
Reasonable and unsurprising choice.
So I guess the Biden / Harris campaign will be  Back the Blue ... ... ... ... wave.  #BidenHarris2020 #bidenvp #crimebill #topcop #KamalaIsaCop #sad #Democrats #Election2020
When can I get my Biden/Harris lawn sign and car magnet?
Kamala Harris, a former Champaign-Urbana resident, chosen to be Joe Biden's running mate
Alright Biden, I‚Äôll give it to you that Kamala Harris is a great choice for VP! Makes me more enthusiastic about my vote than I might otherwise have been!
I said for months it was gonna be Harris he made the logical choice She will be Biden‚Äôs bulldog against Trump
Biden and Kampala LMAO I want trump another 4 honestly
OK Biden pic Harris you think Trump will get desperate Don pants and try and take on Nikki Haley as VP?
Let‚Äôs hope Biden and Harris appoint Warren to a cabinet position after they win in November. The country needs her leadership, courage, and experience üòé
and  are winning team! They‚Äôve got my vote!
and  are a winning team! They‚Äôve got my vote!

Joe Biden has picked his running mate.
‚ÄúJoe Biden here. Big news: I've chosen Kamala Harris as my running mate.‚Äù #BidenVP
Drop that VP name Biden....I‚Äôm ready to see who it is going to be
I feel like the conventional wisdom is (was?) that the VP narrative had become toxic for Biden (e.g., he's "late" because he's "not happy") but meanwhile nobody on twitter dot com can stop talking about how excited they are to hear his pick and talk about his pick and...
OK Joe Biden has picked his running mate now either shit or get off the pot quit dragging it out tell us already
. is the youngest  delegate in #Illinois. He talked to  about casting his vote remotely, as the Democratic National Convention approaches.
So unless the Biden campaign is going to throw a fast one on everyone, looks like it'll be Susan Rice or Val Demmings for the VP pick.
I expect Harris will be the Attorney General in a Biden Administration
So the list of speakers at this year‚Äôs Democratic National Convention have been announced and it includes slots for the running mate &amp; for Whitmer, Warren, Harris, Bottoms, and Duckworth. So, my guess is Biden is picking Susan Rice
who on the Biden team thought it was smart to send this tweet out?
He is actively working with Republicans in swings states to steal votes from Biden.  I take offense to that.  If Trump wins it's to his benefit.  He's a millionaire, he'll bask in the tax breaks. Don't be fooled into thinking he cares about you or this country.   Cancel this man.
But Trump‚Äôs deferral of employee payroll tax, for workers making less than $104,000 does real damage. It takes away hundreds of billions of dollars from Social Security. It helps precisely no one who is unemployed, since you have to be employed.
Perspective | With Biden likely to pick a Black woman as VP, here‚Äôs how the media can avoid playing into sexist and racist tropes
I want Joe Biden to win. I‚Äôll vote for him regardless of who he chooses as his VP. This is a make or break election. Ejection of the current occupant is paramount. There are other critical spots to fill, as well. We need sisters on the Supreme Court and Cabinet.
This is the DNC list of speakers, not necessarily knowing who Biden has picked.
Yet his handlers call Biden's faculties into question. Sad.
I mean unless Biden chooses Satan I don't - well...no even then still the better choice.
He probably has a slam for all of them ready to go soon as they announce Biden‚Äôs running mate
Saw my first ‚ÄúRepublicans for #biden‚Äù yard sign today.  Hope springs eternal.
Doubling down on a comm strategy that contestably but systemically fell short in 2016, when Biden's relative polling 2020 against Trump is not much better than where Hillary was in 2016, is inadvisable. There are alternatives, such as solidarity in action with struggling people.
I'm there.  Can't wait to have a cocktail out in public with those who helped Biden win and then kicked the virus in the ass.  I'm in the retribution camp.  I want Kamala as VP because I think she'll want to set an example and not 'heal' or 'move on', and push Joe to do so.
It‚Äôs not a zero-sum choice for everyone in terms of effect. This isn‚Äôt to say that anyone who doesn‚Äôt want to vote for Biden should vote for Biden (not voting for gross sex offending dudes is a pretty good moral line IMHO), but don‚Äôt act like there aren‚Äôt consequences to that.
(Cont from previous thread) I‚Äôm going to say Trump benefits. And I‚Äôm probably going to lose an absolute shitload of follows (and that‚Äôs fine), but‚Ä¶I mean, fuck Biden, I wanted Sanders or further left, but, as a trans person? Who‚Äôs in office actually matters some to me.
...without printing money? Yes. Does that mean we shouldn't do it? Of course not, those people need help and it's not their fault. We're prosperous enough to take this on the chin if we have good, smart leadership. Is that a good reason to vote Biden &gt; Trump? Yep. The idea...
Worse, that we leave ourselves open to manipulation. We create a space that amplifies the message ‚Äúfuck the current system, fuck Trump, fuck Biden, R &amp; D are the same‚Äù really, really loudly and consistently, but we also close ourselves off from the local‚Ä¶
And this isn‚Äôt me saying that I want TERFs in my timeline or conservatives or a shitload of conciliatory liberals or Never Trump Republicans. But my timeline went from, for example, a mix of people who will and won‚Äôt vote for Biden to basically no one who will vote for Biden.

Yet even while admitting that Russia is once again mounting a covert campaign to help Trump, William Evanina felt compelled to balance this inconvenient reality by also saying what Trump wants to hear: that China and Iran favor Biden‚Äôs election.
At this point, Biden could name the Loch Ness Monster as a running mate, and I'd be all like "Nessie 2020."
Didn't he just have an ad that highlighted how bad it was that Biden was going to cut Social Security? This guy has no strategy
That best be false. You think true Americans like the squad and Biden are worth the time harrassing. Their mindset is mine. The only difference is that your bullshit whining doesn't get the coverage when you address me. You are attention whores. Just calling you out on that.
If Biden wins it will literally be Nov. 4th when they clutch their pearls about debt and the deficit.
Kamala Harris could be Joe Biden's VP pick. Here's what you need to know.

A Biden Presidency is bad for Russia
Didn't George Will write an entire column why Biden should pick Bass?   I don't know a lot about her. But that endorsement meant a lot to me.
No....because then the Rethuglicans could nominate someone that could actually beat Biden. Biden is very beatable now, but he's got the "anyone but Trump" vibe going for him. If Trump is out of the picture, then Biden can be beaten.
*who Biden's campaign picked as his running mate
‚ÄúWhitmer, who has been ‚Äúfully vetted‚Äù as a possible vice-presidential pick by Joe Biden, is fully implicated in the big business drive to return to work.‚Äù
He just wants to get beyond November, and if that leaves a giant dookie on the doorstep of the next administration, that's "future Trump's" or "future Biden's" problem.

Joe Biden is not able to finish a sentence on his own sentence unless he is saying some racist shit. You cannot be serious.

I hate to tell Christians this, but if Joe Biden can hurt God, he‚Äôs not much of a God to begin with.
They did that back in 2016 pretended to be Black lives matter. They will also pretend to be Sanders supporters and Biden supporters to play both sides against each other. I was a troll hunter back in 2015 and since then. I can tell some things the most of you do not know.
Wat for it this is only just getting started, he reaching for straws to find something to stick to Biden ,won't happen we are all smarter than he and the repubs know.
Where's the Bible that Biden  hurted? Or is it under audit?
you have seen the horror of this administration and still it will come down to who biden picks as VP". you are the white woman we were warned about.
I prefer science over gods, but respect Biden for supporting science while following his god.

After Team Biden earlier warned journalists not to cover the Biden family‚Äôs Ukraine woes, media of course obeyed. Biden campaign is at it again, spinning any news that might emerge from Ukraine investigations on Capitol Hill, DOJ, or conservative media:
Thank you Leo, you‚Äôre a true patriot.. it‚Äôs unbelievable that Biden is trying to take credit for the peace deal between Israel &amp; UAE!! And Biden is also saying that Trump destroyed the economy he &amp; Obama built because he didn‚Äôt act soon enough with the China Virus! Lying scumbag

No, the point is, he is trying to scare people that if Biden/Harris win, they'll send even more scary minorities to destroy their neighborhoods. The exact, word for word, quote doesn't alter the gist in any way.
Tonight on Hannity Leo you you hit the nail on the head Biden better watch his back.
I don‚Äôt care what Trump comes up with or says through Election Day, I‚Äôm voting for Biden/Harris.
The best thing I can think of is she can be the "attack dog" and let Biden stay positive. I think she and Duckworth were the only two that could have filled that role.
Are we sure about that? I know that's the narrative I just don't know a single reason to think it's true. She doesn't do well with the groups Biden needs more of (youth, Latinos), and couldn't even make it to Iowa in the primaries. Sorry to sound like such a naysayer.

I think she was the correct choice in some sense, I think it gives Biden the best chance to win. I find her record as a DA very troubling, both who she chose to prosecute and who she didn't. I found her ideology to be "fuzzy" at best. She said she believed Biden's accusers and
I‚Äôm here for it!   Joe Biden selects Senator Kamala Harris to be his vice presidential running mate
Obama's strange outlook on the political situation. A political opportunist just like he was. Harris entered politics thru means most Americans would find disgusting. DO NOT allow her to back/door her way into the presidency.  Biden will be found mentally deficient withing a year
Bill, normally true, but given this election cycle and the untested  performance ability of Joe Biden, I‚Äôm not so sure.

Guys I found Biden‚Äôs boat parade:
Trump said Biden ‚Äòhurt God.‚Äô Biden has spent his life drawing from his Catholic faith.
Just like impeachment was a way to deflect attention from Biden-Burisma, this lame statement from an Obama/Clapper holdover reeks of political obfuscation, an attempt to discredit Senate GOP investigation into Biden‚Äôs extensive dealings in Ukraine
The more you read this, the worse it gets. It sounds a lot like the dossier‚Äîpolicy and political disagreements portrayed as ‚Äúelection interference.‚Äù The bit about Russia is intended to make Biden appear tough on the Kremlin, and the citation about Derkach raises red flags:
Hay Kamala, NewsFlash, that‚Äôs what President Trump has been sooo g for the last 31/2 years!  sent the jobs to China! China OWNS Biden, all of the Biden‚Äôs!
This guy is just a idiot! Everyone time he opens his mouth he shows everyone how dumb he is! Just like last night, claiming Biden was going to take your guns and God from you. How stupid! Now he is going to force insurance companies to cover, what Obamacare already covers! Dumba‚Äî
We can‚Äôt keep taking from the land without giving something back. Big mining companies just want to take, them leave the devastation for future generations to worry about. Biden is right. Find other good ways for people to make a living.
If Trump gets his groove back‚Äîhis resiliency is remarkable and undoubtedly infuriates his foes‚Äîcalls to replace Biden will begin. It‚Äôs one thing for Biden to ‚Äúcampaign‚Äù against a president on the ropes from corona/crash/race war. It‚Äôs another to take on a reinvigorated Trump.

After a WSJ article on Biden, readers called Biden a Marxist, talk about him veering Left to win Bernie voters, they even believe he stands for #MedicareForAll. This is what happens when you have a candidate who has no campaign.
Donald Trump is a desperate, cowardly man. Claiming that Joe Biden would "hurt God" if elected is yet another incendiary statement by Trump. If anyone fits the modern-day definition of Tartuffe, it's Donald Trump.

The 30-something liberal snowflakes whining about this could go to the polls and vote in person.  Exposure to a disease that likely won't kill you for a few minutes to vote early in an election and make sure Biden wins big on election night isn't the end of the world.

If you want to be able to cast another ballot in 2024, vote for Biden.
That's my idea for why not voting for Biden is justifiable. You want the Dems to move left so you make them work for your vote.
Everyone who can't see a difference between Trump and Biden should just keep talking to each other on Twitter. Absolute buffoons.
"two point shift"? that's usually within the margin of error, and IMO doesn't justify an explanation. What's more interesting is the sheer size of the Trump-Biden gap, though we're still ~3 months out
The issue is the opposition descending into backbiting like they always do and the international community growing bored.  I haven't heard a lot from Biden's team or his campaign surrogates about Venezuela strategy, which concerns me that he might be open to fake elections.
There is a difference. Voting for Trump in 2016 caused this entire mess we‚Äôre in. Appreciate the Biden vote now
As long as Mitch is feeling good about things, the rest of the county does not matter.  However, great campaign fodder for Biden, McConnell sends the Senate home for vacation during this mess.  --&gt; Dereliction of duty by the GOP, again.
The Pod Bros are tools and I would totally promise to vote for Biden if he disses Ben Rhodes and the rest of them.
I can‚Äôt wait for Biden to go on Cumtown next month.
Ralph Nader didn't put W in the White House. Kerry had a busted story - war hero/anti-war veteran/war hero to fight terror. So he got Swiftboated because when your story's broke your enemy defines you. Thank God Biden's got a tight narrative - decent man in time of indecency.
That is literally what Biden said.  Outside means outside.  Also, what does "alone" constitute in your mind?  If I am walking on a sidewalk in a shopping area should I wear a mask?
Jogging with a mask on or walking a dog outside with a mask on is exactly what Biden just said...  That is what wearing a mask outside means.  And that is ridiculous.
I don't like Biden all that much either but right now in America the only choices are bad or worse. In the end, when no other choice is presented, I will always take the lesser of the bad.
This is about the debates. Notice that he says 3 months. When the debates begin (September) Biden will say that Trump is responsible for 10,000 deaths because he ignored Biden‚Äôs mask advice in August. In October he‚Äôll say 20,000. This is all debate positioning.
yeah, I think I'm hearing you say biden gives us some breathing room... which I'm definitely sympathetic to
Hi.  I'm religious.  I'm OK with Biden-Harris.  Who were you talking about exactly?  Oh, I'm a liberal Jew.  You didn't mean me, right?  Because leftists who self-identify as religious don't count?
ok, I was confused before. now I know *why* I'm not voting for biden.
Misogyny and a 25 year campaign against HRC was a big player last time. They saw two equally awful evils. Hoping there is more clarity and less misogyny (Biden‚Äôs a dude) this time.
Plus, it‚Äôs all just so....tawdry and sad.  Who needs to even know this anymore?  Let‚Äôs just elect Biden, chalk it up to experience, and move the F on.
Correction: Our country IS collapsing now. We must elect Joe Biden.
If you disagree with someone, fine. But I am irritated with this trope about anyone who is not wild about Biden is a Russian agent. That's so dopey 50's-McCarthyite. Come on.

I used to be critical of Kamala Harris. Now I am going to defend her at every turn
Hey, is it clear yet that if you don't vote for Biden, there's a good chance you won't ever have a chance to vote again?
Those bishops who are OK with Biden receiving the Eucharist are guilty of scandal and demeaning the Eucharist.
The messaging I am seeing from the Trump campaign is stunningly bad/unprofessional. Trying to paint Biden-Harris as wild-eyed radicals?? That dog won‚Äôt hunt.
This is a Republican pollster and a 4 point improvement for Biden from June with them.
Of course DOJ should but Biden shouldn't go anywhere near that decision.
Biden shouldn't be anywhere near that decision.
So USA üá∫üá∏ should elect Biden,To solve your issues?
I only know that YOU, trump, have done nothing for anyone but yourself and your rich friends, so don't tell me what Biden is going to do. He is a decent man. Can you say that about yourself?
Next week  is speaking at the  Read his message about why  was the right person to join  on the ticket.
Voting non Dem is a Trump vote Voting non GOP is a Biden vote  So it cancels out  See how easy this is? You fucking goons
Silly man Biden did not pronounce her name correctly
Is this supposed to be consistent with the Fox commentator predicting that Biden won't be on the ticket come November?
The fact that y‚Äôall really think you can pull the race card on Biden/Harris like Trump/Pence isn‚Äôt overtly racist is dumbfounding
Biden couldn't build a Lego tower in his current state. gtfo
This attack would be borderline cute but for the fact that Trump has stonewalled funding to modernize the northeast corridor‚Äòs transportation infrastructure ‚Äî one of the few areas of broad bipartisan concern ‚Äî and Biden is likely going to win 99% of the Amtrak employee vote.
2 means to me &amp; my wife, and what it will mean to our grown children when they reach retirement age.  Biden/Harris 2020
This ticket! ü•∞ #BidenHarris
Biden derangement syndrom smh.
Sorry, no one was watching!! There was more interesting news on MSNBC! BIDEN/HARRIS!!!
Yeah, I kind of agree.  Or just have one so the Repubs can‚Äôt accuse Biden of being scared of debating.
Ambassador Neumann, these are all good things but I think that more is needed from Biden.  Will you agree with me that Biden should declare against the fake parliamentary elections in December and also repudiate the "mesita"?
Venezuelans would have a lot more power if they demanded things from Biden as well as Trump...  Like demanded that Biden declares against the fake parliamentary elections.
That is why she was selected. Not because she is simpatico to Biden
She was not my first choice, but I now see my error.  She is the right choice.   One clue to her value to Biden is that the Trump campaign team's responses were confused and contradictory.   They have no effective counter message to Kamala, and she takes media time from Trump.
People do realize that Kanye West joined BLM in June and donated $2 million. Since then, he announced he is running to pull votes away from Biden to help Trump. It's not a far leap to think he is using his new BLM $$ influence to trigger new unrest which also helps Trump.
Vote for Joe Biden bc you have seen him, right in front of your face, on TV for 8 years.

The eighth region in my Wisconsin breakdown series is Southwest Wisconsin. This was another frustrating region for Hillary Clinton in 2016 and one where Joe Biden will need to improve in 2020 if he's to win the state of Wisconsin. 1/4
Joe Biden thinks you can throw Kamala  out there
But Joe Biden thinks you can throw a Democrat out there
Someone else came up with it, but I like it. The condition for Biden to debate Trump is that Trump has to release his tax returns to the public.
Vote for Biden. Trump will continue to do nothing while Americans die. America will eventually become a developing country- we are already headed there.
‚Äúunder control‚Äù man u guys really dont want any of us voting biden lol
I wonder if Biden will make Kamala watch when he goes skinnydipping like he used to make his female Secret Service agents do.
As usual, think how the GOP would react if Biden (or any other Dem) stood up a fake campaign for a GOP candidate!  They would raise holy hell and impeach everyone. But it's okay for Jared to run this stupid operation, which he'll botch anyway.
Oh yes! Let‚Äôs see, I volunteer Fauci, Gates, Cuomo, Lightfoot, Pelosi, Newsome, Harris, Biden, Clinton family, Soros family, Rockefeller family, Rothschilds family and the rest of the zionists they work for, &amp; whoever actors aren‚Äôt killed off. criminals.

We‚Äôve been screaming abolish the police for the last two months and Joe Biden picked a fucking cop ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Pennsylvania is Biden. Not going red. The conman has caught up to Trump there with enough people.
I guess the lesson is that Biden is not a narcissistic psychopath like Trump. He doesn't believe he has all of the answers to every question.
Sen. Kamala Harris wasn't on my radar somehow for this election, but having looked into things now, I feel a lot better voting for her than for Biden, and her history as a lawyer bodes well for,  y'know... not committing crimes in office. #BidenHarris2020
Both Kamala &amp; Biden have a history of signing bills that only serve to continue to imprison, separate &amp; oppress us. Niggas haven‚Äôt had a chance to vote for someone decent since I turned 18 so far be it from me to be the one to tell anyone where there loyalties should lie
I love this! ‚ù§üá∫üá≤  Watch "Joe Biden releases first ad with Kamala Harris as his running mate" on YouTube
Burn all this shit to the ground   Idk g, but it‚Äôs definitely not as simple as ‚Äúa vote against Biden is a vote for trump‚Äù or any of the other colloquialisms used lately.
Stop telling black people that voting for Biden/Kamala is the MORAL choice, those who harm our communities will continue to keep doing so in positions of power
Kamala is a cop. Race and gender do not matter. Let's stop acting like the Biden/Harris ticket is exciting UNTIL they support M4A and Defunding the police
With apologies to The Wire and to Omar, ‚ÄúBiden don‚Äôt scare.‚Äù   Biden is a mature, confident person, comfortable in his own skin. It‚Äôs never been about Biden, it‚Äôs always about people and the country.   Not saying he‚Äôs perfect. We don‚Äôt need perfect. We just need good. Or better.
Translation: The privileged racist white stay at home mom will be voting for me. They want their neighborhoods to stay exclusively white and keep minorities out. Biden would reinstall it, in a bigger form, with Cory Booker in charge!
"This is a winning pick for the Biden campaign in every way imaginable."  Joe Biden's pick of U.S. Senator Kamala Harris as his VP running mate may boost enthusiasm for him among Black voters, says Prof.
Trump would single out Booker because: 1) Trump is a lying idiot 2) Booker will be a powerful campaigner for Biden/Harris 3) Trump is completely ignorant 4) Maybe Trump got Booker and Ben ("Dr. HUD") Carson confused?
we are anti-all US presidents. the US empire shouldn‚Äôt exist + all US presidents have been evil war criminals, capitalists, white supremacists, and cops. trump is no diffferent than biden or obama at the end of the day, so we don‚Äôt see anything good abt identifying as anti-trump.
I‚Äôm certain Biden and the DNC had to heavily consider the best candidate based on SNL performances also.
I really hope they keep pushing this. Maybe it‚Äôll accidentally convince some of the ‚Äúbern it all down‚Äù crowd to get out and vote for the ‚Äúradical leftists‚Äù Biden/Harris.
I think that all Venezuelans, especially the US diaspora and  should lobby Biden and his advisers to come out against the December 6th farce elections in Venezuela.  This could help Guaido pressure Maduro into granting a delay and gaining conditions.
Believe me that single-payer isn't mainstream Democratic policy.  Free college for all isn't mainstream Democratic policy.  Biden won the Democratic primary while being against those things.
While voters don't pick their candidate based on their VP ,  can give the campaign just a little bit more mobility and range on left of center issues, and will help on messaging.  ( last night on #ChicagoTonight
I'd love to know what Biden's plan is (seriously).  I am legit afraid that he'd throw Guaido and the G4 under the bus in favor of the misfit toys in the "mesita" and endorse fake parliamentary elections like Chris Murphy seems to want to do.
Biden may be against sanctions, support fake elections, support the mesita, and throw Guaido under the bus.  That is the legitimate concern.
Do you think we will see Prince Harry campaigning for Joe Biden this year or is that a leap too far?
Biden is the top of the ticket. So it‚Äôs Trump or Biden? Pretty simple. Stop the nonsense
Sometimes the obvious needs to be pointed out.   The "racism" is on Laura Ingraham.  Kamala Harris is a proven vote getter in the the most populous state in the nation.  Joe Biden picked the candidate that would most help him get elected President.
Actually, Bill, that choice for VP actually hurts Biden and the Democrats. This is a woman who called Biden a sexist and racist and now they‚Äôre supposed to run together? Seriously? Do you think Harris is ready to run the country? I don‚Äôt. But that‚Äôs what will happen.
Finally some good news! Nearly a 20pt margin. Intraparty war is unavoidable with Biden's self-proclamation that he's just a bridge to the future.
Nothing against Maya Rudolph but I don't give a fuck that she may be getting more airtime because of Biden's VP pick.
My takeaway: it looks I have the same laptop as Biden. Wonder if he also has keyboard issue with his, and how he deals with it.
Great for POTUS within a smaller and shrinking group of people.  Great for Biden in a larger and expanding group of people.
"All the White Guys"??   Some of us White Guys are fine with Biden's choice.  Oh, I almost forgot, Biden is a White Guy.
Can you guys please lobby Biden's advisors to come out with a statement against the December 6th Parliamentary Elections?  I think that Biden could do a lot of good with a statement like that.  He could give Guaido leverage to get the farces postponed and get conditions.
I am delighted there is a Biden/Harris Ticket! Made my day.
Great! With Harris on the ticket, Biden will be easily defeated...
If you‚Äôre considering shaming people for not voting for BIDEN AND HARRIS, consider not doing that and instead helping the communities they‚Äôve helped ruin.  Y‚Äôall are too old to keep pretending Trump‚Äôs evil is responsible for everything wrong in the US or that it‚Äôs an anomaly.
Them: you picked  Biden: I told you it needed to be a woman, not dead fat wrestler!!! #toofar? #sorrynotsorry #icouldntresist #RIPKamalaWWE
Pretty soon I‚Äôm gonna read ‚Äúif you don‚Äôt vote out Trump by voting for Biden/Harris you‚Äôll be personally responsible for leaving those kids in cages!‚Äù and I‚Äôm gonna spontaneously combust
With all due respect: when was Joe Biden excommunicated? When he mourned his son? When he spoke up for women‚Äôs agency? Spoke against Barr, the Catholic who orders executions in high speed? Could you please expand so that we can all read it, and hear what you really mean to say?
#Kamala Honors to the strong women in Biden‚Äôs possible picks for VP. Their collective support of Kamala is honorable. Women in solidarity of each other. Trump‚Äôs stoogie remarks show how scared he is.
I would love to know Biden's position on the parliamentary "elections."  I think that both the EU and a potential Biden admin not throwing Maduro the lifeline he wants would be helpful.
I am a lifelong Democrat and would vote blue whoever &amp; I like Joe Biden, BUT VERY DISAPPOINTED IN HIS CHOICE OF KAMALA HARRIS. He wanted a "woman of color", which is fine, just thought there were others who would have been a better choice. Harris' record as prosecutor not good.
Not this white woman. Biden-Harris all the way
Nasty Women for Biden/Harris 2020 !!
Trump: If Biden wins, Americans will have to learn Chinese  via  if you win we‚Äôll have to learn Russian
Listen if Hamilton could endorse Jefferson then I can do my best to support Biden/Harris!
Biden taps Kamala Harris as running mate: Where does she stand on economic issues? More
Two fake people running for President and V.P. , BIDEN"S been cloned and KAMALA replaced by a look alike.
NOW WE HAVE A CLONED JOE BIDEN WITH DEMENTIA AND A REPLACEMENT KAMALA HARRIS.  SHOULD BE INTERESTING!
And a sign that he is someone who is willing to listen and learn and grow. And also shows that Biden knows this isn't just about him. It's about all of us. Way different than Trump's approach and in the best possible way. He had my vote, and now he has even more of my respect.
Aside from everything else that is being said now by the "pundits," it shows that Biden is the anti-narcissist, without ego problems.   Here he picks someone who very personally attacked him during a debate! Can you even imagine Trump doing that?
#TRUMP2020 biggest landslide in Presidential Election history? Who, besides the careerless ‚Äúoppressed‚Äù, is going to vote for Joe fucking Biden??
Joe Biden did the dumbest move ever and now Trump is going to win again lmao
Day One Biden/Harris: Boot this bozo!

not ridin with biden LMAO
Biden/Harris is the best possible ticket. There will be nit-picking and criticism, but nothing is ever said about trump/Pence, and they are a total disaster. I'll take Biden/Harris any day of the week.She'll eat Pence alive in debates.... plastic man and the prosecutor... yeh!
Great choice. Biden-Harris!
boy Joe Biden really just helped out the big ten didn‚Äôt he
During the largest BLM movement and amid global riots and protests that haven't stopped for 3 MONTHS... Biden picks a cop for VP. Man Dems can fuck allllllllllll the way off
I think the odds are high that Biden will give Harris a lot to do since he was a VP and he‚Äôll have his hands full rebuilding our image abroad. But I don‚Äôt think she‚Äôll be a shoe-in for pres in 2024 as some suggest.
i for one imagine a world where biden sent AOC an invite to play ARAM and by ARAM i mean the presidency
Why are so many of us reporting we‚Äôre sitting around weeping with joy at Biden‚Äôs pick? God, we needed this at the end of this summer!!
Around this time of year reality sets in. In the spring you still have your ideals. By Sept. it‚Äôs clear there will be one person  victorious on 11/4: You wasn‚Äôt Trump or Biden? Given that‚Äôs the choice, what else can we do?
Easy for me to say, but in hearing what is going on inside postal service, its veterans need at every location to quietly hold meetings. Everyone should agree: whatever deJoy says, nod "Yes," &amp; do what must be done to maintain service. Biden will take care of you.
Not Joe Biden picking the devil Kamala
Not a surprising choice but I can't stand her for how she treated Kavanaugh.   So no way I vote Biden.
Biden/Harris - can't wait for my yard sign!!!
This tells me several surprising things about Biden--all of them good. 1. Unlike trump he doesn't hold grudges. 2. He can take criticism gracefully 3. He knows a kickass running mate when he sees one! #Kamala
Kamala Harris is Biden‚Äôs choice for VP.
BIDEN PICKS HIMSELF FOR VP #JoeJoe2020

Joe Biden isn't looking so good
Umm I'm Joe Biden
BREAKING Biden selects New Zealand president Jacinda Ahern as his running mate
Whoever Biden chooses, the media gauntlet of misogynist tropes and biases will be a given. Last week a slew of influential women wrote a letter to news orgs and  points out that it‚Äôs actually a BFD.
Isn't he a bit late to the party? Didn't Biden pledge to nominate a woman six months ago?
Will Biden condemn the Venezuelan "fake elections" in December and publicly support Guaido's strategy?  Because the fact that WOLA and other left leaning think tanks staffed by Obama alums keep demanding that Guaido support the "mesita's candidates" in them is worrying.
Why not have a transvestite as a V.P. for biden. We had a Transvestite as a first Lady (Michelle).
... He's speaking Thursday before Biden.
I really can't imagine why Trump thinks he'll do well debating Biden... Biden isn't the most eloquent speaker - we know that - but at least he can string together a sentence or two that are intelligible, unlike Trump.
So impressed that America's religious community has taken the Allman Bros response to Trump's attack on Biden's Catholicism I ain't here a wond'rin' why But I'll live on and I'll be strong 'Cause it just ain't my cross to bear
congratulations to Biden Veep pick Baby Nut
If you all can't wait for Biden to pick a VP, how are you going to wait for mail-in ballots to be counted? Do a jigsaw puzzle, for God's sake.
From experience: be very careful what jokes you make about Biden‚Äôs potential VP pick. What you do today will haunt you annually in your facebook memories.
Despite my best intentions -- visiting the CNN website to see if Biden has officially announced Susan Rice yet -- I need to make sure I don't visit CNN's website again.
Not quite the same. Biden isn't killing Americans and golfing while we die.
What he posted isn't complete (Buttigieg is speaking Thursday) and if Biden picks a VP who is scheduled for a different night, they'll just change the schedule. Organizers have no idea who the pick is so they schedule everyone.
Not that my opinion matters, but Biden can take as long as he wants. They're not choosing drapes. They can take their time and get it right.
#AGBarr wants the law to be his guide not politics.That's why he is so slow? I guess he wants to do indictments after November 3, to show how apolitical he is. Let me guess how long he will be AG after that day? Biden will kick his ass out AFAP back to retirement #realDonaldTrump
it makes me sick to think that the nu students who vocally supported Biden from the outset are getting the last laugh
Evers performed better than Clinton almost everywhere in this region. Biden would like to match Evers' margin here or even get closer to Baldwin's 22 point win in this region. Trump would be thrilled to match his 2016 margin. 4/4
The seventh region in my Wisconsin breakdown series is the Madison Exurbs. This was one of the most disappointing regions for Hillary Clinton in 2018 and one where Joe Biden must improve the most in 2020 if he's to win the state of Wisconsin. 1/4
LOL.  I think that the Lincoln Project thinks that if Biden wins he is going to hand over the GOP to them like this is Venezuela.  Sorry about that guys.  How about form your own party, although bitter ex Jeb! advisors, doesn't seem to have much appeal?
Anybody who doesn't plan on using it to gain an advantage towards being the nominee in 2024. That primary should be won on its own merits, not the whims of Biden's selection committee.
It's here, fans of  - my interview with the inimitable   We talk: - the value of moving to the sticks  - politics - messaging - how feminism and conservatism can co-exist - Biden, Trump, RBG and ACB.    #OwnTheNarrative
He will be an important voice in a Biden Cabinet...
So far... Joe hasn't taken the bait. Instead he hit from the flank... pointing out Trump is killing Social Security!  Trump tries to set a tax trap for Biden
Rebel? Then Trump wins... it ain't about Biden.
These are Joe Biden voters.
I am voting for Biden. I will be extremely happy if Andrew Yang can get a high cabinet position.
Is Bides the casual way of referring to Biden for people who are the sons of men who say thigh land?
I believe Joe Biden is right. Provide the DOJ is headed by right person.  Someone like Karmal Harris.
But is iruth?  It is truth! Biden doesn't deserve then be president! And I do not support him!
I disliked Hillary more than I disliked Trump but now I'm just hoping our Union survives this idiot so we can start repairing the Political and Social divide that he widened. I don't want Biden but I want Trump less. What a state for our country huh? Sad.
You should have been on Biden‚Äôs shortlist.
If the ventriloquist puppet doesn't have Trump‚Äôs knee to sit on, he won't know what words to parrot-except fake Bible passages. Biden will rise to the occasion.
On which of these do you agree with your  Carving his face on Mt. Rushmore Selling Puerto Rico Biden can hurt God
Trump's Delusions.   --He wanted to buy Greenland --He wanted to sell Puerto Rico --Biden will hurt God --He wants his face carved on Mt. Rushmore Has there ever been a president so delusional?
Do the Dems offer a language course on Biden-speak?
Demanding people vote for Biden despite not agreeing w/ him on many issues is your own version of a purity test. If people aren't willing to go with the party, then they don't pass. People are individuals making decisions based on what they value. Respect the process.
What? Did joe Biden tweet this way off base comment that holds no truth what so ever? seriously when u just randomly scream shit on the internet, it usually doesn‚Äôt get air time, However factual, rationale with concise thoughts helps! Good luck, we hope u all wake up!
Any normal person would quit.  But Biden is koo koo. What about RNC? They r  koo koo too  O, yeah they r going to cheat, actually they are cheating already But this is not cheating in elementary school this is very serious. Dems playing with fire!
Trump: Biden will destroy God with anarchist lightning from his electric guitar! Biden the next day: Now kids, ya gotta stay off the devil's lettuce!
Empty promises. All Biden.
Statement by Vice President Joe Biden on President Trump‚Äôs Executive Orders to Sow More Chaos and‚Ä¶ by
Sally Yates can‚Äôt remember what Joe Biden said about the Logan Act and Michael Flynn in 2017
So yeah, people need to go ahead and vote for Biden immediately.
Trump vs. Biden is old vs. older. There is nothing about new times in there. Fossil wars.
Wanna bet Biden reveals his VP choice before Trump gives us his tax returns? üòâ
Biden can ride #TrumpCantRideABike
There is an upside. Biden will never come out of his basement fortress, even if he wins. Thanks for taking one for America, Jo.
Fine with me.  I see Biden as mainly a placeholder until 2024.
Right.  That means Biden who is more hawkish and less likely to be fooled by dictators like Rice was on Iran and Cuba would be solely in charge of foreign policy.  It suggests a better foreign policy than a return to the bad policy under Obama.
They let Biden out of the basement?
I'm old enough to remember when Trump was so rich, he was financing it himself. Now, he's skimming so much, Biden is outspending him.
Interesting report but from what I've read, it was the EU, not the opposition, that wants to restart the Oslo-Barbados talks.  The opposition has given their blessing although they are wary.  And I think that Maduro is waiting for a Biden win in November.
Right.  I don't get whining about the opposition or the US for this one given that the regime refuses to negotiate real elections.  I'm not sure how to exert pressure to get them to a real deal.  I believe that the key is the Europeans and Biden not handing Maduro a lifeline.
Anyone who thinks Biden is a communist is mentally ill or challenged. Please look communism up in the dictionary.
Senator Klobuchar, I would spend your time getting people more comfortable that Biden can handle the job, your waisting time knocking trump. I get the argument that anyone is better than trump, but Biden is making people nervous. Thank you
Anyone who votes for a mentally challenged Joe Biden with his history of quid pro quo deals in Ukraine and also China, needs to have his own cognitive function tested.
Biden wants to make the worst VP choice imaginable, doesn't he?
Please send copies of your book to Joe Biden and his campaign staff !!
I no longer buy the mental illness angle they are pushing. This is all a marketing ploy from a family of hucksters.
That Trump believes that Biden could "hurt God" exposes the shallowness, the superficiality, of Trump's own beliefs. Believers in God know that God is stronger than either Biden or Trump.
Biden is portrayed as a familiar face and reliable statesman in contrast with the volatile Trump. In reality, he promises to be the most liberal president in history, writes
Who built Black Wall Street and then whites burned it down.Then Biden! Where in the hell did they get blacks from?Cage the black man took the fathers away from their homes. Some one need to kick his ass.This is the joke Hispanic has a country next door. ‚òπÔ∏è
Speaking of not well, oh hi there Joe Biden.
These attacks will only get crazier as Trump realizes he's going to lose in November, and lose big. Trump has no bottom, no morals, no ethics and no "red line" he won't cross while making up attacks on Biden.   ---&gt; Hang on to your hats, turbulence ahead!
I'm voting for Biden even if he picks me for VP.
I think Rubio is right and the hearing showed that (outside of Murphy who appears to be allied with the "mesita") but I certainly hope that Guaido and Borges are lobbying Biden's team for repudiation of the December 6th farces.
Evers did a point better in 2018 against Walker. He was able to win the Town of Vienna in northern Dane County. This is a Town that Biden will want to win come November as it would show improvement over Clinton in the rural areas around Madison. 4/5
The sixth region in my Wisconsin breakdown series is my home region, Dane County. There is probably room for Biden to grow here compared to 2016. While not the most Democratic region in the state, this is the most liberal region in the state.  1/5
Bull. He was on track to win the nomination.He swept the early primaries and the DNC panicked &amp; brought out the Big guns (Hillary, etc) to trash him.Biden‚Äôs campaign was broke and in the toilet before Clybourn and SC. Arm twisting to get Amy &amp; Pete to dropout and endorse Joe.
My faith teaches me to walk humbly, while President Trump teargassed peaceful protestors so he could walk over to a church for a photo op. by Joe Biden | Aug, 2020 | Mediumit is incredible the similar that are Biden/Harris Campaing with the one of  on 2013.  what do you have to say about it?
So ya mean, Ms Harris and Joe Biden‚Äôs‚Äô ancestors? Make them pay reparations from their respective states. In full. One payment. Game over.
I mean it‚Äôs a union made up of ~200,000 past and present postal wokers, USPS has over 600,000 current employees so it‚Äôs not like USPS came out and said they endorse Biden.
It‚Äôs because Biden is senile

The Trump campaign announced Friday that Trump will host events aimed at attacking his Democratic challenger, Joe Biden, on Monday in Wisconsin and Minnesota and on Tuesday in Arizona.‚Äã

Joe Biden Kamala Harris President 2020 Election T-Shirts  via
Biden isn‚Äôt toxic, just a bit of a non-entity these days. A very peculiar candidate to foist of the public.. from the minds that brought you Hillary and refused to read the room..
Biden is going to lose and it‚Äôll be no ones fault but the establishment. Democrats nationwide are going to screech in dismay and then go back to enjoying their brunch.  Which is why none of this even matters. Poor people will suffer under Biden or Trump. And brunch will go on.
Trump: sexually assaulting and raping underage girls Biden: sniffing hair, sometimes
Except to do what I'm planning to do, mask up and vote in person. I'm willing to risk my life to vote for Biden/Harris.
I predict, Biden/Harris will win, when they are sworn in, there will be a ton of Investigations &amp; I hope the Democrats are stocking up on what they will charge Trump with once he is out of office. Once he's out of office, Pence can't pardon him at all on any Federal Charges.
Biden and Harris deserve criticism.  We also need to stop the hemorrhaging though of judicial appointments.  I'm not sure what path progressives would have after 4 more years of lifetime extremist right wing judges.

Sorry, this story is dead, she has already been caught lying about her school, the bar exam and many other personal details, she was also discredited by her own friends and people who knew her, Biden was vetted heavily before he became VP, but go ahead keep beating the dead horse
Biden is literally named in a criminal investigation in Ukraine. Everyone you said applies to Biden.
Joe Biden lives here....
It's probably too late, but Biden/Harris need to make it plain that they support law enforcement officers. Do you know how many cops and families of cops there are in this country? Whoever came up with "defund" the police needs to be horsewhipped.
He should start doing press conferences with Biden and acting as if the last four years are already in the rear view mirror (like so many of us are trying to do...)

Enough with the ‚ÄúTrump and Biden are the same‚Äù bullshit. Is Biden gonna end DACA? Does Biden amplify Nazi and white supremecist ideologies? Does Biden praise dictators and want to suspend elections and police the press? Has Biden gassed peaceful protestors? Is Biden a bully?
Just so it‚Äôs clear and everyone knows- I regretfully voted for Trump in 2016. I don‚Äôt know how I feel about Hillary, but seeing as I‚Äôm probably going to vote Biden in 2020, I‚Äôd probably vote for her given a redo. Btw- I live in Illinois so it really didn‚Äôt matter.
You‚Äôre really begging for a spot in Biden administration.
Do it AS SOON as you‚Äôre allowed to. Keep following Harris, Biden and other trustworthy accounts as they‚Äôll likely keep you way more informed than anyone else.
Repeated 3rd grade ? GTFOH . Republicans  will counter that trump‚Äôs higher education has been questioned, but that is only after his idiotic boasts of being an excellent student. I am sure, if asked, Biden would cop to not being the best student.
Hardcore parkour Biden Harris supporter. To get back to ‚Äònormal‚Äô.
Well I would just urge you to seriously contemplate that Twitter's progressive space is very small, less than 1% of voters.   At the end of the day, Bernie will have one of the most powerful positions in a Biden era. Yes he was screwed over, but not entirely. Trump cannot win.
Well I‚Äôm glad you acknowledge that Biden is left wing.
No...he really doesn‚Äôt. In fact, the more Biden/Harris works to marginalize these voices, the more he will expand his electoral base and his legislative opportunity platform.
Yes, he'd hold that position.   That position has more power in the Senate than the vice president herself, assuming Biden and Kamala win.
Progressives now hold over 12 seats in Congress and if Joe Biden gets elected Bernie Sanders becomes the chairman of the Senate Budget committee, meaning he will have control of the purse.  He will not change his climate stance.
Vote for him and be the first republican to wear an official Biden mask where ever you go.
Third party is a vote for Trump. They complain a lot about Biden but hesitate to recommend an alternative. Like they don‚Äôt want to give away the motive yet. Feels manipulative and I have no time for that. Not interested in any third party at this time whatsoever.
What is neoliberal about Joe Biden's $2 trillion climate legislation policies?  What is neoliberal about his public healthcare option?  What is neoliberal about his college debt relief?  You're actively voting against your own interests.

I personally feel we‚Äôre going to overcome all this corruption and although it probably will be a fight, we‚Äôll ultimately be fine and Biden will be sworn in in January. You?

Keep in mind, these are his own self reported numbers. I'm sure if an independent group ever studies his plan they'll come up with a number of uninsured people greater than 10 million, but even when we take Biden at his word, these numbers aren't even close to a universal system.

This video isn't looping, Joe Biden just forgets that he's seen this trick that fast
We do need society to systemically change for things to improve. That's objective fact.  But another 4 years of Trump doesn't bring $2 trillion of climate legislation, or a public healthcare option, or college debt relief.   Unequivocally these things have a higher chance w/Biden
This is not me supporting Biden. It's me supporting the activists working tirelessly to shift the party left. Support 4 real politics.  The left position is not to support anyone. You vote against the worst.   These policies wouldn't be debated under Trump, let alone implemented.
Biden's climate positions is far superior to Trump's, and to the left of Obama by far.   $2 trillion commitment to dealing with the environmental catastrophe. It's a policy largely written by the Sunrise movement &amp; endorsed by leading climate activists -- the same pishing for GND
Biden is father to the left than any Democratic candidate in memory, especially on climate issues. Far better than anything since the 70s.  This isn't because Biden had a personal awakening. It's because activists have been beating away at him &amp; will continue to do so
So if Biden wins, I can destroy/burn all kinds of shit I ballpark disagree with, right?
Right.  Just 5 months ago the economy was strong because of Obama/Biden.  Now that it's weak it's because of Trump.  Both times they were wrong!

lrt: i really do not trust biden or trump, people are failing to see how dangerous both of them are, biden is going to set the stage for an even worse trump just like how he set the stage for trump
At this point both are correct.  Very difficult to understand Biden, just jiberish.

Joe Biden. What a joke. Mumbling, fumbling best option Democrat on the ticket today folks. The best the Democrats can do. Can‚Äôt wait to see him implode on national TV when he debates Trump.
Well, you come out of the gate lying!! Donald Trump has done more for this country in his 3.5 years than the 3 previous Presidents combined. You are a fool's fool who knows nothing, ZIP, about how an economy runs and Biden knows less than you! Shameful!
I only know that YOU, trump, have done nothing for anyone but yourself and your rich friends, so don't tell me what Biden is going to do. He is a decent man. Can you say that about yourself?
Silly man Biden did not pronounce her name correctly
There you go again commenting about meaningless drivel rather than about Biden selecting Harris and their socialist agenda for America. Unbelievable!
Is she trying to get someone to assassinate Biden ?
Wasn't Obama building the economy up after Bush W's "free fall economy? which partially resulted from W's ploy of reducing interest rates to stimulate the economy during his reelection campaign? Now Biden will have to do it all over again
He won't be a lame duck if Biden wins, trump will be a lame f__k
. . . during the campaign and thus help Biden win.
Yeah, it's not. And believe me, I am not a big Biden fan. But I'm like understand you will not be able to achieve any reform under a second Trump term. Understand healthcare and abortion is on the chopping block. Criminal justice? He'll throw us all in jail.
I mean everybody starts somewhere but I think it's true that Americans in general don't prefer career politicians. Compare to Biden who was a Senator for 36 years or Hillary who had been around for decades before running.
2 means to me &amp; my wife, and what it will mean to our grown children when they reach retirement age.  Biden/Harris 2020

I‚Äôm gonna be real honest with you here, ain‚Äôt shit gonna change when Biden and Harris win. They have no incentive to answer to us, the people. They only answer to their rich ass donors and themselves.

Yep. I‚Äôm eligible in October. And voting for Biden/Harris the next month.
the u.s. has had an average of 9 cases of ebola since 1900, her speech doesn't even make sense. obama made the health care crisis worse with obama care, not better. this same circumstance would have happened under an obama/biden presidency
Does this mean those "scared housewives" will be more likely to vote Biden/Harris ???
Doesn't matter who Biden picked. Trump will win in a landslide.
Joe Biden thinks you can throw Kamala  out there
But Joe Biden thinks you can throw a Democrat out there
The GOP will become very concerned about this when Joe Biden is inaugurated.
It will also feel good when you are sworn in as part of the Biden administration.
As usual, think how the GOP would react if Biden (or any other Dem) stood up a fake campaign for a GOP candidate!  They would raise holy hell and impeach everyone. But it's okay for Jared to run this stupid operation, which he'll botch anyway.
Oh yes! Let‚Äôs see, I volunteer Fauci, Gates, Cuomo, Lightfoot, Pelosi, Newsome, Harris, Biden, Clinton family, Soros family, Rockefeller family, Rothschilds family and the rest of the zionists they work for, &amp; whoever actors aren‚Äôt killed off. criminals.

I guess the lesson is that Biden is not a narcissistic psychopath like Trump. He doesn't believe he has all of the answers to every question.
I agree with this but also struggle. Many of Trump and Biden's policies are both life and death where a Green party candidate has actual plans to fix. This is a shit time for everyone

Trump would single out Booker because: 1) Trump is a lying idiot 2) Booker will be a powerful campaigner for Biden/Harris 3) Trump is completely ignorant 4) Maybe Trump got Booker and Ben ("Dr. HUD") Carson confused?

Kind of want to have an election night party.   "For Kamala we have Jamaican jerk chicken and Indian tikka masala. And for Biden, to represent Delaware we have...um...scrapple?"
Okay, but I'm excited to see who Biden picks for his Cabinet!
I think a lot the problem with politics is Republicans think Joe Biden and Kamala Harris are the radical left, and the actual left thinks Joe Biden and Kamala Harris are Republicans.
Actually, Bill, that choice for VP actually hurts Biden and the Democrats. This is a woman who called Biden a sexist and racist and now they‚Äôre supposed to run together? Seriously? Do you think Harris is ready to run the country? I don‚Äôt. But that‚Äôs what will happen.
biden and obama expanded ice to the problem that it is today. biden and harris will expand policing. all we have representation for here is more systemic racism and control of capital by the wealthy elite. that's not my kinda leadership or representation, it's just more fascism

Well we can't compare Biden's VP campaign pick to trump's VP because Sarah Palin is so much smarter than him
I'm sure trump had his speech writers make up a whole assortment of new nasty nicknames for each possible pick to be Biden's VP
I really can't imagine why Trump thinks he'll do well debating Biden... Biden isn't the most eloquent speaker - we know that - but at least he can string together a sentence or two that are intelligible, unlike Trump.
It will take a while before trump attacks Biden's VP pick. They have to find the right file in their dirt pile. I say 12 seconds

Should we look critically at the choices and their records? Of course. We should hold them to a high standard (something Biden is aware of I'm sure). But I see a lot of preemptive what feels like character assassination from the left as well as the right.
He called her a nasty woman. He said she should be in jail. They insinuated she was a pedophile. We are not prepared for the kinds of attacks that will be endured by Biden's running mate.
Time for a hot take:  If (god forbid) Biden loses, it won't be bc of his running mate.  Each contender has their pros and cons but let's be honest, she won't be in an enviable position. She'll face an onslaught of sexist criticism unseen before in American electoral politics.
You're comparing that history lesson with Biden or Bush W. ?
Her memory will be so bad she‚Äôll make Biden look like Einstein.

Trump completely screwed up a thriving economy Obama/Biden created. Trump had a guideline for battling any new virus and discarded it well in advance of the Trump Corona Virus.

I don't think so  - do VP picks really mean that much to people? Not enough to sway anyone to vote or not vote for one of the two illustrious choices we have for POTUS. I would think if anything, Ms. Harris brings some respectability to the Biden ticket.
Be realistic, do you want trump? Because no one else but Biden stands a chance. And have you seen immigration nation? Those cages weren‚Äôt for children. The Obama administration wanted immigrants who were criminals out, not everyone who came here illegally. It‚Äôs trump or Biden.

Yeah in terms of environment Trump is honestly the worst, although with the Biden's mental decline, Kamala will be the real presidential candidate and with what she has done to people and her authoritarian ideals, I don't feel like she's better than Trump.
Although Biden is further to the right than Trump, so how is that going to help the left?
It says so much about our beautiful country that a major party ticket now includes a Black and South Asian American woman. Congratulations, Kamala #MVP

It's funny how hypocritical Trump is calling Joe Biden "sleepy Joe" when Mike Pence constantly  sleeps on the job, Kamala Harris is gonna make him her bitch in their debate.

Having Biden and kamala harris on the democratic ticket is the biggest middle finger to progressive criminal and prison reform
Who has confidence in Biden? He can't even remember Obama's name.
I mean with Kamala as VP, she is essentially the president due to Biden's mental deterioration. Considering she's pro slavery and anti pot, are you sure?
They will as long as Biden listens and obeys
Obama and Biden left a pandemic plan behind in case something happened, which was then ignored when a pandemic happened. ACA isn't really to blame for this.

You are going to try to paint her as  radical left but the Democratic ticket of Biden and Harris is clear indication that the party has rejected it, so good luck with that.
You‚Äôre babbling and running scare!! Biden/Harris 2020
I've been saying ever since it was clear that Bernie was probably gonna lose that I would vote for Biden just because he'll at least be capable of listening to criticism and will fill his administration with experts.  We gotta just pour on the pressure even harder if Biden wins.
Nah, that's a bad take. If you're not feeling Biden then you don't HAVE to vote Biden. Heck, even Biden has said the same thing when talking about the Tara Reade allegations.   You're just alienating people who are on the fence if you say they HAVE to vote Biden.
That's fair. I generally only really push people to really consider voting Biden if they're in battleground states, since their vote might actually make a direct impact on the results.  I want 3rd parties to be a viable option but we gotta get election reform first sadly.

He did not say that he would veto M4A, here is the direct quote of his response to the question of if he'd veto M4A.  "I would veto anything that delays providing the security and the certainty of health care being available now."
Not a fan of her, but then, I am not fan of Biden. That being said, I am voting Blue, no matter what. The stakes are way too high.
Biden has nothing to do with either 160k+ dead or the recession, and Kamala's healthcare plan would've covered everyone and forced private healthcare to follow stricter regulation.
Of course he did, it's Trump. The man is maximum pettiness personified.  I'd vote for a moldy lemon and stale bread before I voted for Trump, and Biden/Harris at least have some real interesting history and a lot of progressive policy writers pushing the campaign along.
Warren would've been my vote in the primary had the writing not already been on the wall that she was not going to be competitive enough in the primary, so I shifted to Bernie.  If it makes you feel any better, Warren has been a *major* policy adviser for Biden in recent months.
Yall saying you're no longer voting for biden might as well vote for trump
Didn‚Äôt kamala trash Biden in the debates?
Yay! And the next president after Biden.
I don't know who he could've picked that would've pulled in more progressive and younger voters. Elizabeth Warren is amazing, but people didn't show up for her, and she's just as old as Biden is.
Biden is handing Trump the election. The Democratic Party should be sick for letting these two be the ones running
Let's get our 2020 election on, folks! Biden Harris for the win!
Kamala Harris was honestly probably my top pick for VP (her, Warren, and Susan Rice top 3), she'll be a great choice, assuming that Biden continues to work with Sanders and Warren with his policies.
She's not really polarizing, and especially neither her nor Biden are as divisive as Trump. That's a false equivalence. Listening to Harris interrogate someone is the most exciting thing out there, she's a great speaker.
It is great for the President, but horrible for Joe Biden.  Kamala Harris is very unlikable, vicious person.
Biden Harris LFG
There is no better Democrat to be manipulated than Joe Biden! That's why he is the ideal candidate for the left mob who wants the revolution (read: pathological destruction of the Country). Joe Biden is just a puppet for the left mob and MSM (the same).
If Biden selects Kamala Harris he will be toast. Very vulnerable VP pick
Have you heard the guy that predicted the winner for president since 1984 correctly even Trump in 2016 said Biden will win in 2020. God save us!
Hahahahahahahahahahahaha... That's the normal mistakes all the people make sometimes.  Biden is totally lost and he needs to be guided by his staff (the left mob) all the time.  Huge difference!
I love how the Biden campaign view the VP selection as the ‚Äúleast risky‚Äù and not helpful or advantageous
DC Swamp Lizards. They have sold out and probably promised much money if Biden gets in. DemocRATS in Republican clothing.

I would say 2 and 3 are pretty close. But a friend of mine knows his Doctore Biden had a stroke and he is declining fast!
And yet unlike Trump, Biden will pick an administration and work with qualified experts because he knows that it‚Äôs not really about him as an individual at all. That‚Äôs the draw for Biden in this case, he‚Äôs very good at knowing when to seek expert opinion.
I'd vote Biden if his pick was was snoopy the dog!
This is ridiculous.  It was a slip. God I hate defending Trump, but if Biden misspoke in that manner, and Jr, Sean, and the gang jumped on him for it I would be pissed.

Of course! But I think that Joe Biden is more experienced especially as a golfer. Hahahahahahahahahahahaha... #Trump2020NowMoreThanEver
Look around what is happening at this moment! Biden will do 1000 times better.
Can you ride a bike üö≤ Rudy Giuliani! The difference here is insurmountable.Trump holding hands and Biden on a long bike ride! Yep you will not be heard off after early next year Rudy &amp; if you are indicted for corruption trump can‚Äôt save you from the justice system! Good luck üçÄ!
Not only can Joe Biden ride a bike but he can say Yosemite!
Your father was a great comedian, but also an outstanding actor. He is missed. Political figures are pubic figures. His piece on Biden, like other politicians in his act are fair game. It was also hilarious. Let‚Äôs just leave it at that and not make it political.
So, Biden (in the reality the left mob who wants to govern) is more pro life than Trump??? That question is not even a subject to discussion. It's obvious.  #Trump2020NowMoreThanEver  Without any doubt!
Tell pops He needs to call Biden and go together on a bike ride for Exercise! Biden wow at 78 killing it on his bike ride and pips needs to hold hands down the Ramp  with a General ! That‚Äôs not how a commander in Chief suppose to look like ! Silly üòú!

Imo if Biden wins we might as well all buy some lube now for when we bend over and get ass fucked
FDR....Sounds more like Biden than trump. Jfc. Like that statement holds any water.
Joe Biden is dumber than a bag of doughnuts how do you guys not see it. He can‚Äôt even talk properly.. flubs his words all the time and loses my interest immediately
People are brainwashed to think nothing can be worse than trump. Even if trump is as bad as some people think, Biden is inherently worse.
We were talking about Trump but sure let‚Äôs bring up Biden since y‚Äôall know Trump is awful. No the 1994 bill was awful and unlike Trump supporters we accept what Biden has done wrong. Want to talk about the Obama administration and it‚Äôs accomplishments.
Nope. False. If Trump wins, everybody loses except his supporters. If Biden wins, not everybody automatically wins, but at least people of color like me have a shot.
Biden supports the second amendment idiot üòÇ he‚Äôs outlined a VOLUNTARY buyback program for high capacity assault weapons, which means it‚Äôs not mandatory. Try again
Kind of Biden's thinking ü§î
President Biden will be your President too. He will do much more for you than Trump but you won‚Äôt admit it. Just sit back and enjoy.
Joe Biden is a disaster candidate for the Democrats! He is a quarter of Joe Biden from ten, twenty years ago! Joe Biden belongs to the nursing home not to the White House! And that's sad but true.  That's impossible that more than half country is blind and will vote for him.
The democrats are in trouble with Joe Biden leading the ticket. They selected poorly
If the Dems sweep, Federal taxes will go way up. Biden already promised it. Your money is going to be used to bail out the  Dem cities and states whose economies have been destroyed by Dems.The Obama people are jerks and didn't believe in Biden in 2020.  Obama was rooting for Sanders.
Been nightmares every night since Trump got elected. Our cities are burning and people are dying from a pandemic that he mishandled. I‚Äôll take my chances on Biden rather than certain disaster with Trump.

Biden is 3 years older than Donald. Where do Donald, and his minions, get off accusing Biden of being too old?  The SKelly cartoon is despicable, and I demand the Tribune own up to that now!
Yes, but then back to the UFO's after Biden victory!
Wondering why Biden didn't do whay you claim in the 8 yrs in the Whitehouse or 30 yrs in Congress. Kamala ,you called Joe a racist during Debates.Were we to believe you then or now? You will truely come to know the power of God our Creator. And Great will be your fall
I blocked her and Joe Biden so their tweets don't show up on my timeline.
The 30-something liberal snowflakes whining about this could go to the polls and vote in person.  Exposure to a disease that likely won't kill you for a few minutes to vote early in an election and make sure Biden wins big on election night isn't the end of the world.
If the "day of" vote count is a landslide for Biden, it should be game over.
Hey, Molly... Biden wasn't my first choice, but he's certainly not "the lesser of two evils" !!
Unlike most potential presidents, no one knows what Biden stands for. He‚Äôs the figurehead for a shaky coalition that harbors radical views, writes
What happens if Biden wins?  Guaido might not be able to get lobbying and diplomatic pressure from a Biden administration if he campaigns for Trump.  Not to mention that Guaido needs Biden right now to unlock the game by throwing cold water on the fake elections.
You don't like the choice between trump and Biden?  Then how about choosing a decent person  Novel idea, I know, but boy do I miss decent.  So does the entire world.
Barack Obama: I've been to 57 states and I have one more to go.  Joe Biden: I've been to one state and have 57 to go.
If you want to be able to cast another ballot in 2024, vote for Biden.
That's my idea for why not voting for Biden is justifiable. You want the Dems to move left so you make them work for your vote.
Everyone who can't see a difference between Trump and Biden should just keep talking to each other on Twitter. Absolute buffoons.
"two point shift"? that's usually within the margin of error, and IMO doesn't justify an explanation. What's more interesting is the sheer size of the Trump-Biden gap, though we're still ~3 months out
The issue is the opposition descending into backbiting like they always do and the international community growing bored.  I haven't heard a lot from Biden's team or his campaign surrogates about Venezuela strategy, which concerns me that he might be open to fake elections.
There is a difference. Voting for Trump in 2016 caused this entire mess we‚Äôre in. Appreciate the Biden vote now
As long as Mitch is feeling good about things, the rest of the county does not matter.  However, great campaign fodder for Biden, McConnell sends the Senate home for vacation during this mess.  --&gt; Dereliction of duty by the GOP, again.
The Pod Bros are tools and I would totally promise to vote for Biden if he disses Ben Rhodes and the rest of them.
I can‚Äôt wait for Biden to go on Cumtown next month.
Ralph Nader didn't put W in the White House. Kerry had a busted story - war hero/anti-war veteran/war hero to fight terror. So he got Swiftboated because when your story's broke your enemy defines you. Thank God Biden's got a tight narrative - decent man in time of indecency.
That is literally what Biden said.  Outside means outside.  Also, what does "alone" constitute in your mind?  If I am walking on a sidewalk in a shopping area should I wear a mask?
Jogging with a mask on or walking a dog outside with a mask on is exactly what Biden just said...  That is what wearing a mask outside means.  And that is ridiculous.
I don't like Biden all that much either but right now in America the only choices are bad or worse. In the end, when no other choice is presented, I will always take the lesser of the bad.
This is about the debates. Notice that he says 3 months. When the debates begin (September) Biden will say that Trump is responsible for 10,000 deaths because he ignored Biden‚Äôs mask advice in August. In October he‚Äôll say 20,000. This is all debate positioning.
yeah, I think I'm hearing you say biden gives us some breathing room... which I'm definitely sympathetic to
Hi.  I'm religious.  I'm OK with Biden-Harris.  Who were you talking about exactly?  Oh, I'm a liberal Jew.  You didn't mean me, right?  Because leftists who self-identify as religious don't count?
ok, I was confused before. now I know *why* I'm not voting for biden.
Misogyny and a 25 year campaign against HRC was a big player last time. They saw two equally awful evils. Hoping there is more clarity and less misogyny (Biden‚Äôs a dude) this time.
Plus, it‚Äôs all just so....tawdry and sad.  Who needs to even know this anymore?  Let‚Äôs just elect Biden, chalk it up to experience, and move the F on.
Correction: Our country IS collapsing now. We must elect Joe Biden.
If you disagree with someone, fine. But I am irritated with this trope about anyone who is not wild about Biden is a Russian agent. That's so dopey 50's-McCarthyite. Come on.

This is a Republican pollster and a 4 point improvement for Biden from June with them.
Of course DOJ should but Biden shouldn't go anywhere near that decision.

Silly man Biden did not pronounce her name correctly
Is this supposed to be consistent with the Fox commentator predicting that Biden won't be on the ticket come November?
The fact that y‚Äôall really think you can pull the race card on Biden/Harris like Trump/Pence isn‚Äôt overtly racist is dumbfounding
Biden couldn't build a Lego tower in his current state. gtfo

Sorry, no one was watching!! There was more interesting news on MSNBC! BIDEN/HARRIS!!!
Yeah, I kind of agree.  Or just have one so the Repubs can‚Äôt accuse Biden of being scared of debating.
Ambassador Neumann, these are all good things but I think that more is needed from Biden.  Will you agree with me that Biden should declare against the fake parliamentary elections in December and also repudiate the "mesita"?
Venezuelans would have a lot more power if they demanded things from Biden as well as Trump...  Like demanded that Biden declares against the fake parliamentary elections.
That is why she was selected. Not because she is simpatico to Biden
She was not my first choice, but I now see my error.  She is the right choice.   One clue to her value to Biden is that the Trump campaign team's responses were confused and contradictory.   They have no effective counter message to Kamala, and she takes media time from Trump.
People do realize that Kanye West joined BLM in June and donated $2 million. Since then, he announced he is running to pull votes away from Biden to help Trump. It's not a far leap to think he is using his new BLM $$ influence to trigger new unrest which also helps Trump.
Vote for Joe Biden bc you have seen him, right in front of your face, on TV for 8 years.

Joe Biden thinks you can throw Kamala  out there
But Joe Biden thinks you can throw a Democrat out there
Someone else came up with it, but I like it. The condition for Biden to debate Trump is that Trump has to release his tax returns to the public.
Vote for Biden. Trump will continue to do nothing while Americans die. America will eventually become a developing country- we are already headed there.
‚Äúunder control‚Äù man u guys really dont want any of us voting biden lol
I wonder if Biden will make Kamala watch when he goes skinnydipping like he used to make his female Secret Service agents do.
As usual, think how the GOP would react if Biden (or any other Dem) stood up a fake campaign for a GOP candidate!  They would raise holy hell and impeach everyone. But it's okay for Jared to run this stupid operation, which he'll botch anyway.
Oh yes! Let‚Äôs see, I volunteer Fauci, Gates, Cuomo, Lightfoot, Pelosi, Newsome, Harris, Biden, Clinton family, Soros family, Rockefeller family, Rothschilds family and the rest of the zionists they work for, &amp; whoever actors aren‚Äôt killed off. criminals.

Pennsylvania is Biden. Not going red. The conman has caught up to Trump there with enough people.
I guess the lesson is that Biden is not a narcissistic psychopath like Trump. He doesn't believe he has all of the answers to every question.
Sen. Kamala Harris wasn't on my radar somehow for this election, but having looked into things now, I feel a lot better voting for her than for Biden, and her history as a lawyer bodes well for,  y'know... not committing crimes in office. #BidenHarris2020
Both Kamala &amp; Biden have a history of signing bills that only serve to continue to imprison, separate &amp; oppress us. Niggas haven‚Äôt had a chance to vote for someone decent since I turned 18 so far be it from me to be the one to tell anyone where there loyalties should lie
I love this! ‚ù§üá∫üá≤  Watch "Joe Biden releases first ad with Kamala Harris as his running mate" on YouTube
Burn all this shit to the ground   Idk g, but it‚Äôs definitely not as simple as ‚Äúa vote against Biden is a vote for trump‚Äù or any of the other colloquialisms used lately.
Stop telling black people that voting for Biden/Kamala is the MORAL choice, those who harm our communities will continue to keep doing so in positions of power
I agree with this but also struggle. Many of Trump and Biden's policies are both life and death where a Green party candidate has actual plans to fix. This is a shit time for everyone
Kamala is a cop. Race and gender do not matter. Let's stop acting like the Biden/Harris ticket is exciting UNTIL they support M4A and Defunding the police
With apologies to The Wire and to Omar, ‚ÄúBiden don‚Äôt scare.‚Äù   Biden is a mature, confident person, comfortable in his own skin. It‚Äôs never been about Biden, it‚Äôs always about people and the country.   Not saying he‚Äôs perfect. We don‚Äôt need perfect. We just need good. Or better.
Although born &amp; raised in the city, I am now a "suburban white woman." I can't wait to, not only vote against *45 but throw my entire support behind "Biden/Harris 2020"
Translation: The privileged racist white stay at home mom will be voting for me. They want their neighborhoods to stay exclusively white and keep minorities out. Biden would reinstall it, in a bigger form, with Cory Booker in charge!
"This is a winning pick for the Biden campaign in every way imaginable."  Joe Biden's pick of U.S. Senator Kamala Harris as his VP running mate may boost enthusiasm for him among Black voters, says Prof.
Trump would single out Booker because: 1) Trump is a lying idiot 2) Booker will be a powerful campaigner for Biden/Harris 3) Trump is completely ignorant 4) Maybe Trump got Booker and Ben ("Dr. HUD") Carson confused?
we are anti-all US presidents. the US empire shouldn‚Äôt exist + all US presidents have been evil war criminals, capitalists, white supremacists, and cops. trump is no diffferent than biden or obama at the end of the day, so we don‚Äôt see anything good abt identifying as anti-trump.
I‚Äôm certain Biden and the DNC had to heavily consider the best candidate based on SNL performances also.
I really hope they keep pushing this. Maybe it‚Äôll accidentally convince some of the ‚Äúbern it all down‚Äù crowd to get out and vote for the ‚Äúradical leftists‚Äù Biden/Harris.
I think that all Venezuelans, especially the US diaspora and  should lobby Biden and his advisers to come out against the December 6th farce elections in Venezuela.  This could help Guaido pressure Maduro into granting a delay and gaining conditions.
Believe me that single-payer isn't mainstream Democratic policy.  Free college for all isn't mainstream Democratic policy.  Biden won the Democratic primary while being against those things.
Yep If elected Harris would be president within one year due to Biden dementia issue
While voters don't pick their candidate based on their VP ,  can give the campaign just a little bit more mobility and range on left of center issues, and will help on messaging.  ( last night on #ChicagoTonight
I'd love to know what Biden's plan is (seriously).  I am legit afraid that he'd throw Guaido and the G4 under the bus in favor of the misfit toys in the "mesita" and endorse fake parliamentary elections like Chris Murphy seems to want to do.
Biden may be against sanctions, support fake elections, support the mesita, and throw Guaido under the bus.  That is the legitimate concern.
Do you think we will see Prince Harry campaigning for Joe Biden this year or is that a leap too far?
Biden is the top of the ticket. So it‚Äôs Trump or Biden? Pretty simple. Stop the nonsense
Sometimes the obvious needs to be pointed out.   The "racism" is on Laura Ingraham.  Kamala Harris is a proven vote getter in the the most populous state in the nation.  Joe Biden picked the candidate that would most help him get elected President.
Actually, Bill, that choice for VP actually hurts Biden and the Democrats. This is a woman who called Biden a sexist and racist and now they‚Äôre supposed to run together? Seriously? Do you think Harris is ready to run the country? I don‚Äôt. But that‚Äôs what will happen.
Finally some good news! Nearly a 20pt margin. Intraparty war is unavoidable with Biden's self-proclamation that he's just a bridge to the future.
Nothing against Maya Rudolph but I don't give a fuck that she may be getting more airtime because of Biden's VP pick.
Yes but the Harris Biden 2020 platform is a plank on the Titanic
Doesn‚Äôt matter Harris Biden 2020 are going to loose
My takeaway: it looks I have the same laptop as Biden. Wonder if he also has keyboard issue with his, and how he deals with it.
Great for POTUS within a smaller and shrinking group of people.  Great for Biden in a larger and expanding group of people.
"All the White Guys"??   Some of us White Guys are fine with Biden's choice.  Oh, I almost forgot, Biden is a White Guy.
Can you guys please lobby Biden's advisors to come out with a statement against the December 6th Parliamentary Elections?  I think that Biden could do a lot of good with a statement like that.  He could give Guaido leverage to get the farces postponed and get conditions.
I am delighted there is a Biden/Harris Ticket! Made my day.
Great! With Harris on the ticket, Biden will be easily defeated...
If you‚Äôre considering shaming people for not voting for BIDEN AND HARRIS, consider not doing that and instead helping the communities they‚Äôve helped ruin.  Y‚Äôall are too old to keep pretending Trump‚Äôs evil is responsible for everything wrong in the US or that it‚Äôs an anomaly.
Them: you picked  Biden: I told you it needed to be a woman, not dead fat wrestler!!! #toofar? #sorrynotsorry #icouldntresist #RIPKamalaWWE
Pretty soon I‚Äôm gonna read ‚Äúif you don‚Äôt vote out Trump by voting for Biden/Harris you‚Äôll be personally responsible for leaving those kids in cages!‚Äù and I‚Äôm gonna spontaneously combust
With all due respect: when was Joe Biden excommunicated? When he mourned his son? When he spoke up for women‚Äôs agency? Spoke against Barr, the Catholic who orders executions in high speed? Could you please expand so that we can all read it, and hear what you really mean to say?
#Kamala Honors to the strong women in Biden‚Äôs possible picks for VP. Their collective support of Kamala is honorable. Women in solidarity of each other. Trump‚Äôs stoogie remarks show how scared he is.
Biden‚Äôs base is very excited. #Trump2020  #KamalaHarrisForVP
I would love to know Biden's position on the parliamentary "elections."  I think that both the EU and a potential Biden admin not throwing Maduro the lifeline he wants would be helpful.
I am a lifelong Democrat and would vote blue whoever &amp; I like Joe Biden, BUT VERY DISAPPOINTED IN HIS CHOICE OF KAMALA HARRIS. He wanted a "woman of color", which is fine, just thought there were others who would have been a better choice. Harris' record as prosecutor not good.
Not this white woman. Biden-Harris all the way
Saying I'm not voting means I'm not voting at all...not Trump and not Biden.
Nasty Women for Biden/Harris 2020 !!

And a sign that he is someone who is willing to listen and learn and grow. And also shows that Biden knows this isn't just about him. It's about all of us. Way different than Trump's approach and in the best possible way. He had my vote, and now he has even more of my respect.
Aside from everything else that is being said now by the "pundits," it shows that Biden is the anti-narcissist, without ego problems.   Here he picks someone who very personally attacked him during a debate! Can you even imagine Trump doing that?

I think the odds are high that Biden will give Harris a lot to do since he was a VP and he‚Äôll have his hands full rebuilding our image abroad. But I don‚Äôt think she‚Äôll be a shoe-in for pres in 2024 as some suggest.
i for one imagine a world where biden sent AOC an invite to play ARAM and by ARAM i mean the presidency
Why are so many of us reporting we‚Äôre sitting around weeping with joy at Biden‚Äôs pick? God, we needed this at the end of this summer!!
Around this time of year reality sets in. In the spring you still have your ideals. By Sept. it‚Äôs clear there will be one person  victorious on 11/4: You wasn‚Äôt Trump or Biden? Given that‚Äôs the choice, what else can we do?
Easy for me to say, but in hearing what is going on inside postal service, its veterans need at every location to quietly hold meetings. Everyone should agree: whatever deJoy says, nod "Yes," &amp; do what must be done to maintain service. Biden will take care of you.
Not Joe Biden picking the devil Kamala
Not a surprising choice but I can't stand her for how she treated Kavanaugh.   So no way I vote Biden.
Biden/Harris - can't wait for my yard sign!!!
This tells me several surprising things about Biden--all of them good. 1. Unlike trump he doesn't hold grudges. 2. He can take criticism gracefully 3. He knows a kickass running mate when he sees one! #Kamala

Isn't he a bit late to the party? Didn't Biden pledge to nominate a woman six months ago?
Will Biden condemn the Venezuelan "fake elections" in December and publicly support Guaido's strategy?  Because the fact that WOLA and other left leaning think tanks staffed by Obama alums keep demanding that Guaido support the "mesita's candidates" in them is worrying.

If you all can't wait for Biden to pick a VP, how are you going to wait for mail-in ballots to be counted? Do a jigsaw puzzle, for God's sake.
From experience: be very careful what jokes you make about Biden‚Äôs potential VP pick. What you do today will haunt you annually in your facebook memories.
Despite my best intentions -- visiting the CNN website to see if Biden has officially announced Susan Rice yet -- I need to make sure I don't visit CNN's website again.
Not quite the same. Biden isn't killing Americans and golfing while we die.
What he posted isn't complete (Buttigieg is speaking Thursday) and if Biden picks a VP who is scheduled for a different night, they'll just change the schedule. Organizers have no idea who the pick is so they schedule everyone.
Not that my opinion matters, but Biden can take as long as he wants. They're not choosing drapes. They can take their time and get it right.

Biden has a script fir everything he says. After he reads it - he walks off stage.  In a Debate there are no notes. Bye- Bye- Joey
So is Cocoa Puff going to vote for Biden or are they sworn enemies?
Those against voting for the lesser of two evils, please read this.  Noam Chomsky is a philosopher, linguist, and left-wing advocate.  He‚Äôs finally on the same page as me and he understands that Biden isn‚Äôt Bernie, but he‚Äôll be able to push the country in that direction.
Multiple redundant protections need to be put in place to protect America from Trump's (and Putin's) plans to both 1) "cheat to win", 2) "discredit a Biden win as fraudulent". Multiple actors EACH need to add their own INDEPENDENT protections: Congress, EACH state, EACH township.
Yea Joe Biden did so well with H1N1 virus they told states to quit testing, nobody wore mask, so basement Joe &amp; #HeelsUpHarris can g to hell #outnumbered
Joe Biden is a plaegeriser and has lost 2 previous presidential bids because of it. An inconvenient truth.
"if you don't vote for biden you cannot complain about trump if he wins" well i'm not voting for trump either and i'm gonna complain about biden all i want
You forget the only suburban housewives any more are in rich, white homes.... most suburban homes require two full-time incomes to support and that‚Äôs just a scrape by Till the next paycheck, especially in this economy. My vote is for Biden
Absolutely not, I wear it when it is justified, Biden is an idiot
Correction, when Hills tried to ‚ÄúRIG it‚Äù so she‚Äôd win and it backfired in her face! What a cheater! She‚Äôs so corrupt it‚Äôs sick. Killary is the puppet masterüëø behind Biden. Go against her and ya die. Biden couldn‚Äôt win Uno for God sakes!
Liar, Liar Liar. You tv ads are blantanly false. Joe Biden said he would raise taxes on people making $400 thousand and above.  He has never said most of what your shills have said. This worries me, you as an Impeached President can‚Äôt be trusted. Bad for the USA
Literally only voting for Biden to get Trump out. Of all the options, he was like, fourth on my list. Maybe, MAYBE third.
The President used the term ‚Äúfederal decree‚Äù with regard to a suggestion made by former VP Biden about a national mask mandate. I just prefer that everyone sticks to the common language so waters don‚Äôt get muddied.
Most realistically joe Biden would get run over by the train after becoming confused and stepping on tracks.
Trump wasn‚Äôt propelling that thing Biden was Trump was on the Trump train
Biden REALLY shouldn't use the "trump is a racist" strategy, as it is gonig to backfire.  Biden is the actual racist.
Biden's entire campaign is based on orange man bad, which is what Hillary did and lost with. if that's all he's got, he's going to lose also. Though, if he will also lose if he tries to campaign on policy change.
Overall, with everything going on in the world,  I think she is the best candidate and will help Biden
ALL Trump's evil is brazen &amp; flaunted, including the hypocrisy of trying to get every government in the world, friend or foe, foreign or domestic, to make announcements of investigations or charges that will hurt  including FALSELY claiming Obama/Biden did this to HIM!
I wonder if she still believes Biden‚Äôs accuser
So true, let‚Äôs not forget Obama &amp; Gates funded the lab in China to intentionally cause this mess during Trumps term! It‚Äôs not a question of right vs. left, it‚Äôs right vs. wrong! Funny how Biden owns an island next to Epstein‚Äôs. Wtf?
Biden with tiddies is traumatic
Is Kamala Harris a Nauseating Political Opportunist?  Harris either believes the charges against Biden or she doesn't. Either way, she has problems.
Biden isn‚Äôt strong enough to propel that thing.
I‚Äôm a suburban white woman and I‚Äôm voting for Biden/Harris! Never felt better about a vote!!!!
Lie after lie in your commercials. Do you take the people in this country as stupid?  No we see the lengths you will go to slander Joe Biden.  Voters will turn away from you this fall. Step down, it‚Äôs time.
Hey  did you notice  out of his basement today? That warm sensation your daddy feels in his backside is Biden and  foot in his ass. Start packing and don‚Äôt steal anything. You‚Äôre done.
While I recognize the intent to be "folksy" and show a familiarity with Senator Harris, referring to her as Kamala is sexist. Please, Vice President Biden, when you reference your running mate, refer to her as Senator Harris or use her full name.
#HeelsUpHarris is a phony, and her laugh is annoying as hell, between Biden‚Äôs gaffes and her phoniness they make the perfect dumb and dumber
The over/under on  Beau Biden references today was three. We are over. Way over.
I expected more from Biden's speech. Yawn!!
Biden is a Huge Favorite to Win the Election  538 has odds of 71-29. I was 70-30. 538 ran 40,000 simulations. I ran zero. I just looked at the polls.
Biden really rode the grey area with Kamala. She is s woman of color-except NOT AFRICAN AMERICAN.  She is Jamaican - Indian. Nice try Joe - this will be an issue.
Another Biden ooops.  He is really full of himself now as he was then, so what change?  Nothing, still full of Sh**
3 VERY IMPORTANT THINGS about this photo of Joe Biden calling Kamala to offer her VP spot: 1. Biden has to read from a script that is clearly visible 2. Biden does not know how to hold an iPhone (it‚Äôs upside down) 3. The cartoon on Biden‚Äôs desk is a man screaming ‚ÄúWHY ME?!‚Äù
The same 6 in 10 think Biden is going to be President.  Donald J. Trump will be the President after the next election!!
A tremendous disservice to America. And you all what another 4 years of this crap?  No thanks.  Biden/Harris...Let‚Äôs go!!!
And yet you can truly not come up with one Biden accomplishment in almost half a century of public service.
So you agree the Biden is a political nothing?
I look at policy only. It is indisputable that Biden is and always has been a political failure. His peeps can‚Äôt ever come up with a notable accomplishment.
Neither Trump or Pence will have to say a word during the 2020 Debates, just give Biden and Harris the microphone.
Nauseating But Predicted: Biden Selects Kamala Harris as His VP Running Mate
Fact. Joe Biden says he won't raise taxes on anyone making under $400,000. Once again you lie in your commercial.  Every commercial you have run is a Big lie.  I can‚Äôt trust you on anything.  It‚Äôs time to give up your lies.
NARRATOR: Biden is Catholic.
This about sums it up. I will be voting for Biden/Harris.
#APGov220 If you‚Äôre following along with news about  choosing  for his VP running mate, this has the Biden and Trump responses.
Joe Biden named California Sen. Kamala Harris as his running mate on Tuesday, making history by selecting the first Black woman to compete on a major party‚Äôs presidential ticket.
Way to go Biden #HeelsUpHarris
Just remember when all these GOP people say anything about her comments in the primary against Biden, they were hurled personal insults from Frump against their  family members, their own personalities, etc. now they line up to kiss his ass and don‚Äôt say a word
Joe Biden named California Sen. Kamala Harris as his running mate on Tuesday, making history by selecting the first Black woman to compete on a major party‚Äôs presidential ticket.
We are all waiting for Biden to be told who his running mate is.  Odds in Vegas say he will say the wrong name when he makes the announcement
Yes I know Gabe personally. We are hanging out Saturday. Come join us. He does say questionable things, as do I. But perhaps I need to see blatant racism to see something as racist. Like the things Biden says.
Whoever Biden's VP Pick, it's not about him or the woman he picks. It's about the people they are running for, the people they want to serve. The presidency is no place for an evil, narcissistic sociopath who thinks everything in the universe is about himself.
Biden hasn‚Äôt got any brain cells... everyone can see that. It‚Äôs so frustrating how people can‚Äôt see the evil George Soros started. So many fell for it and we‚Äôve gone backwards 100 years.
Trump saying to a reporter, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll tell you who‚Äôs meddling in our elections: the Democrats!‚Äù, is as ridiculous as when Biden answered a reporter, "You!", when asked his running mate. But, TRUMP's ridiculous answer was a SERIOUS LIE.  KNOWS Trump is a literal traitor.
Biden would have been screaming.
So as someone who teaches history - it‚Äôs normal for people to make mistakes. The briefing was interrupted earlier and that can throw people off.  However, the Trump team has been hammering that Biden is in some kind of cognitive decline.   Glass houses and stones come to mind.
Black male leaders warn Biden ‚Äòwill lose‚Äô election if he doesn't name Black female running mate   I thought you‚Äôre suppose to pick the most qualified not what color their skin is, identity politics by the Democrats typical
Just like you did with the H1N1 virus, where you stopped testing, ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ Biden the basement dweller
It does not mean Biden will lose.  This is a ridiculous threat.
I'm voting Biden
I really hope so. I'm disabled and now I'm forced to find a new place to live and my sister said she would get a place with me, but we just fall short of the income we need and my disability hardly gets me by. I'm praying for you Joe Biden. üòéüôèüèº
Trump is the one trying to tell America that a Biden presidency will lead to this when it's happening during his term. Either the president isn't responsible (and Trump's argument is BS) or he is (in which case this is on Trump, and his argument is BS).
Is that the same Joe Biden that Trump says hates religion and God?
If his tax deferral is implemented, Biden can campaign on the promise once he is elected, the debt will be forgiven.
Brilliant? It's easily countered by Biden coming out and saying the same exact proposal.  Id disagree with him as well.
Question why don‚Äôt you see biden signs or bumper stickers anywhere? I see Trump everywhere
Happy colonoscopy prep day to me.   Still better than a Biden speech.
Where‚Äôs  suspending your account for lying, oh that right twitter only attack conservatives. You‚Äôre a a liar and Marxist, Biden the basement dweller will never be President and America will never a socialist country.
I‚Äôm in Illinois too. There is only 1 candidate I was willing to knock on doors for, put up a sign in my yard, bumper stickers on my car, drive to Iowa to campaign for. And it isn‚Äôt Biden or Trump. I may write his name on the ballot. Still undecided. #ShouldaHadYang
I‚Äôm sure the Trump campaign will somehow turn it into a video of Biden riding his bike around his basement.
Not! I don‚Äôt like to be mean however why did he get rid of the pandemic team we didn‚Äôt need? Seemed Biden and Obama knew we needed one!
I‚Äôve seen 1 Biden sign I‚Äôve seen  1 ‚ÄúAnyone But Trump‚Äù sign And I‚Äôve seen 2 Trump signs That‚Äôs all, folks Zero enthusiasm for our next President during these unprecedented times Sad
Sad the Democrats cheer because people are unemployed they want to keep America closed, they fear monger and spread political propaganda. Worst run states and cities, are run by Democrats. They support basement dweller Biden,ü§£ü§£ #Trump2020Victory #WalkAwayFromDemocratsForever
Twerp
Dumb ass
DONT BE COMPLACENT, PEOPLE‚Ä¶ as this video explains, Biden might be up 9 points, but when taking into account the margin of error, he may only be up 2.4 points.  Clinton won the popular vote by 2.1 but still lost the electoral college
92% of African-Americans support Biden over Trump.  89% voted for Hillary in 2016.  Seems like he‚Äôs talking to the majority already...
I'm Joe Biden and I forgot where I am again. Can you call me a cab?
Trump hasnt said anything racist. Biden is up to 7 now.
Seriously. Trump makes more gaffes in a day than Biden has made in his whole campaign ( Thighland?)
Have you ever actually listened to your guy? Joe Biden is going to hurt God? Says the guy who doesn‚Äôt go to church about a practicing Catholic. PS nice mental gymnastics talking about the NRA. I guess you don‚Äôt care that rich people steal your money as long as they like guns.
I think Gov. Whitmer is top talent.  She has all the traits needed in national leadership.  I was happy to see she is still being considered for the VP slot.  She would be a huge asset to Biden's campaign.
That is awful. Let us blame the Chinese. Move manufacturing back to the US and cut them deeply as punishment. Trump will make them pay for their crimes Biden will give them a party.
the perv puts his foot in his mouth yet again-smh
the perv puts his foot in his mouth yet again-smh
Best person for the job President Trump, basement dwellers like Biden won‚Äôt do it.
Biden: "I..." *Hannity cuts off clip* Hannity: "Why is it always about you, Joe?"But how can you pre-write a tweet about something in the future you don‚Äôt know about yet? He died before Biden picked Kamala. It wasn‚Äôt prewritten. The whites got his account. That‚Äôs trumps only black friend now he dead
Major US postal workers union endorses Biden for president A major union representing U.S. postal workers endorsed Democrat Joe Biden, a move that comes after President Donald Trump acknowled
The state races maybe narrowing but there is 1 state that is showing improvement for us and that is Trump's new home state of Florida. Biden has maintained his lead there since April and Trump only led there for 1 day then after that Biden continued to lead. #VoteBidenHarris2020

üíØ but they don't care about working people they only care about Putin and Russia if Trumpers really cared they would be voting for Biden and if they cared about the postal service they would be demanding funding. Trumpers until they start caring should stop buying things online
Thank God that Biden/Harris are on the scene to save our country.  As a senior, I have seen some shit in my day, but Trump is a dire threat to our democracy. Vote BLUE
You are scared shitless &amp; you should be. We BIDEN/HARRIS supporters are coming for you &amp; Pence. You can try stopping us with your fake voter fraud claims, but we are making it to the polls &amp; on November 3rd you‚Äôre lying ass is gone.Stay nervous.Stay veeeeery nervous
How can you alienate your own voters by attacking the postal service if people really care about the postal service then they should be voting for Biden if people don't care about the postal service they should do 2 things move out of the country and stop ordering things online.
So why is Biden your presidential candidate instead of Harris or Warren?  You apparently don‚Äôt practice what you preach!üê≠
Joe Biden is not going to close the concentration camps, any more than Obama closed Guantanamo Bay. He's going to give them a bipartisan stamp of approval and you're going to forget they even exist.

We have moved all of our planned theater performances into 2021. Update this week, stay tuned and stay healthy... and vote Biden/Harris!

Why is the big baby calling Biden a racist? Dump hates black ppl. That‚Äôs why him or his father didn‚Äôt rent to them back in the day. Or did crazy dump forget that? I think dump needs his moms teet again with all his crying!!
When Obama was President, we didn't have to use a mask. The country was never shut down. It wasn't always about him like Trump makes it out to be. When Obama and Biden were in office we were in a much better place as a country.
They willl send more stimulus , the market will crash, the dollar will die , and joe Biden picked another idiot. Can we go to September now

I‚Äôm voting for Biden
No he won't, people want change. The only way he can win at this point is if he cheats. Biden is winning all ready according to some of (many) polls.
Does he not know he will be debating Biden not Harris Pence will be debating Harris and he will get whopped
whenever Biden is in trouble, he reaches out to the redbone community
READ THE THREAD.   We‚Äôre not just voting for Biden/Harris. We‚Äôre voting for so much more than that. And getting Trump out of office is just an extra added bonus.
Agreed. Trump has a strategy that will work with his base but he already has them. He doesn't seem to have one that will win over anyone outside his base. His best hope is to disaffect borderline Biden-Harris voters so they stay home instead.

I know a lot of people in  that really approve of what you're doing, but aren't thrilled with your charisma. PLEASE do whatever you can to win. This country is doomed if biden wins.  On November 4th you say whatever and however you want.  This country needs you and Pence .
Looking at Biden, he has a terrible record from his past- when it comes to race, for women, for rights. And it‚Äôs terrible, we all wanted Bernie. But what we can do is vote for the policies he has on the table right now, they aren‚Äôt the best- but tolerable compared to Trump.
Also, Warren's Senate seat could easily go to a Republican. No way Harris's seat flips.  Biden ain't that dumb. If he was on the fence, it wasn't between Warren and Harris.
Biden ain't that dumb. If it's down to Harris or Warren, Harris is the obvious choice. I was all in for Warren for President, but she's almost as old as Biden and would not be a good choice to succeed him. Harris is a good choice to be his successor.
I just can't believe a word Biden or Harris say. Friends, family, and strangers I find vote for them lose all my respect. Don't expect me to give a üí© if you are in trouble and need help. I will look you in the eye and laugh as you take your last breath. üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ

I won‚Äôt lie.... Biden‚Äôs speech was the most Presidential speech we‚Äôve gotten since Trumps been in office.... Because he cannot even articulate what‚Äôs going on in the world.
Does he mean better than Obama-Biden did for eight years when they threw $4 trillion at it.
Biden cares about regular Americans he will bring us jobs end hatred and bring change decency respect and dignity to the WH and to the world stage. The age of sexism will end and everyone saying sexist things about Harris will be held accountable and will lose their jobs.
Biden/Harris in TV.  You have got to win this election!  Our sanity and health depend on a win.  PLEASE
Biden doesn't tolerate sexist attacks against Kamala Harris and i don't either and i will end any friendship with people who say sexist things about Kamala. I am tired of the sexism we should've had a female president in 2016 and we will have a female VP.#BidenHarris2020Landslide

i won‚Äôt take Ye seriously until I see him debating on the stage with Biden and Trump, in that moment my head will explode
Keep brown people out of the suburbs is all this is. I can't wait until.Biden wins and puts this country back on track and improves the lives of all the people not just the rich of white ones.
Biden looks like he's moving a lot because he's making up for twenty years of Democrats failing to keep up with American society‚Äîwhich they go away with (until 2016) because the Republicans are so far off center that Democrats didn't feel the usual pressure to keep pace.
If anything, Obama and Clinton were the outliers here. Both were well to the right of mainstream. Obama got away with it, but Clinton did not. Biden is trying not to repeat Clinton's mistake.
Democrats are supposed to be the majority party. Majority parties have to track with majority opinion or they stop being the majority party.  Biden is doing what every Democrat has done since 1930, and yet people like you act surprised when they do it.
You are so sneaky Bill. A real genius. Since Joe says he's running against Joe Biden, let's have Kamala debate Joe Biden.  #BidenHarris2020  #MAGA2020LandslideVictory
This thread perfectly articulates how I‚Äôve been feeling since Biden announced Kamala. Thanks for sharing  !
Read through the toxic Biden Bros in this thread threatening people for criticizing Biden.
Joe Biden has more American blood on his hands than just about anyone you could name, including terrorist leaders. That's not some small thing for you to condescend over.
Do you see how out of touch you seem dismissing peoples' problems with Biden as being "a ticket I 'dont like'"? Like that's psychotic
Biden is also not going to help with the environment or student debt. People with power do not willingly reduce their own power for the benefit of the powerless.
When will liberal Proggressives take ownership of what they‚Äôve created in this country! Division, censorship, hate of cops, hate if the US! Biden/Harris you are  #(D) evilAwakens

Republicans attacked Biden for fumbling but this time he's the one struggling Karma in the works. Now we have the last word
Biden waited to announce, now the news cycle is so far removed from where it was when Kamala was running that most boomers have probably forgotten all the bullshit that went down
In order to gain the minority vote the Democrats add Kamala Harris as the VP, Harris called Joe Biden a rapist and a racist during the primaries and is a firm supporter of legislation that is killing major cities in the US (like Chicago). Hypocrites!

All the people complaining about Harris also hate Joe Biden. I get that it's hard for a centrist to imagine someone having a self-consistent and honest worldview, but most people actually just don't like establishment politicians.
If you can point to someone who likes Chuck Schumer but hates Nancy Pelosi, loves Biden but hates Hillary, is a fan of Bloomberg and Elliot Engel but hates Amy Klobuchar, then sure. But that's not actually the kind of person you're going after, is it?

Joe Biden was meant to be a megachurch pastor but hes been lead astray. He hates doing this stuff, I want to save him
What exactly is it you're claiming? Are you denying all of the horrific violence I'm referring to happened? Are you claiming Biden somehow wasn't involved in any of it? Or are you saying that it doesn't matter because they mostly happened in the third world?
Yes, I am so awash in privilege that I'm familiar with the role Joe Biden has played in war crimes committed by the US since the early 1970s and think that those crimes actually matter
Biden supported Pinochet throughout his politicide. That's just a fact. I'm sorry if it offends you.

I didn‚Äôt vote for Trump. I read the article. Biden doesn‚Äôt get to win simply because one person at CNN thinks he should. He has to earn it. I suspect the Dems wish he didn‚Äôt have to. The media should not be protecting a candidate. They wouldn‚Äôt if they believed in him.
I'd vote Biden if his pick was was snoopy the dog!

If he does Biden wins the election period there will be nothing Trump can do to win if that happens. No Republican has ever won without Texas if the GOP won Texas in 1976 Carter most likely wouldn't be president

Gm everyone i hope Biden announces his VP pick today my patience is running out
Joe, you didn't write that. Come on man!  #Biden
on Fox: The Republican Party is being destroyed by the president. Therefore, he wants Retarded Joe Biden as President as a remedy. What a POS.
Since Biden will announce his VP pick soon we don't know how soon it's time to get #BidenHarris2020 trending and make some noise. Who's with me?
makes a great point- Biden has improved in polling from 2016 by over 10% in the Midwest with white voters.
Brian, Biden is so sick they'll have to prop him up to inaugurate him if he wins. I'm sure you think of FDR. But FDR had his wits about him. #Biden2020  #MAGA2020LandslideVictory
Joe Biden supports the murder of unborn children. A million a year. Have fun with that guy Mr moral.
Have you seen the latest pictures of Biden‚Äôs rally?  Shoulder to shoulder, no masks!  Maybe they‚Äôve decided to commit suicide without wasting campaign funds on Koolaid!  üòπ
Good morning everyone i can't wait for Biden to make his VP announcement am running out of patience
Try looking for FACTS instead of political lies. Trump isn‚Äôt the one who plans on ending social security and Medicare. That‚Äôs Bernie errrr...I mean Biden as his puppet.
We have a lot more proof that Trump has mentally lost a step than Biden.

You mean the pro Biden commercials?
You don't need to pick between apologizing for Trump and apologizing for Biden.
Joe Biden is the architect of the War on Drugs. He's been trying to cut social security for decades. He's a segregationist. He's overseen half a dozen genocides.
Of course 4 years of Trump is going to do irreparable harm to our country. So will 4 years of Biden. The harm is non-negotiable.
Liberals are too racist to comprehend that Joe Biden would do the same thing to the US that he did to South America
Change is not more likely through Biden. He's going to revoke more rights and hurt more public programs. He's not the best we can do right now, he's not even better than nothing.
Voting for Joe Biden isn't saving anyone from strife. You're latching onto voting to convince yourself that you have some ability to do anything to help, but you don't. At least not individually
The race maybe narrowing down but it's the state races that matter and Biden still has strong leads in the rust belt he still has a strong lead in Florida even if results swing 2% to the right Biden still wins that's strong his lead is but we need to make sure it stays this way.
Biden hasn't chosen a running mate yet everyone
Sorry, Biden's not president yet. Maybe if he wins he'll smell your hair too.
Yeah absolutely. Imagine someone going after Joe Biden for this same thing
This message goes to Dr. Jill Biden if you love your husband please tell him to drop out of the Presidential race.I know he really wanted this but JILL he is someone who is not well and you are aware of this. PLEASE do the right thing.
We know you will president Biden..
The GOP let him get away with everything else...  Hope they remember if they don‚Äôt call out trump, Biden can do it too!!What if Carter or HW didn‚Äôt lose like gentlemen? Trump is trying to make USA a Belarus ‚Äúdemocracy‚Äù? We need to VOTE in mass to save our country. #FascistTrump #ItIsWhatItIs #Biden #BidenHarris
Give biden a chance
Union president Fredric Rolando said Democrat Joe Biden is a "fierce ally and defender of the United States Postal Service."
Right after they help Trump win again because Biden fails the Progressive purity test.
Vote Biden, country first!
Did Nader vote for the War or did Biden and Hillary? Pipe down
Of course you know any PowerPoint the Biden team puts together is gonna have paragraphs of text on each page and he‚Äôll end up just reading off of it
Biden took office when you could buy leaded gas. He was there for both oil shocks and both versions of CAFE.  In 4 years, you dropped oil to $0 and just made Isreal and the UAE BFFs. Going for peace in the entire Middle East and fixing CAFE in the next 4 years?
thinking ab the way someone explained voting for biden being taking a bullet to the leg while voting for trump is taking a bullet to the heart and honestly? yeah! like i‚Äôm not happy about it but at least i won‚Äôt DIE
When Biden first took office as a Senator, you could be leaded gas.
So if Biden and Harris was  to win the election she‚Äôs not a legit candidate according to the law so the president could refuse step down awesome
what are you talking about they both have said that they will vote for Biden and even if they didn't they live in Vermont and New York lol
I‚Äôll be voting in Illinois for Trump.  Maybe a miracle will happen and he‚Äôll carry the state!   Hard to imagine anyone voting for Biden on purpose.
Trump‚Äôs team is replete with excellent female talent.  Biden can only dream of having such a team.  Only a misogynist would foreclose the search for female talent by stating up front that men need not apply.  No confidence in women!
Sadly I am riding with Biden
We all now know the utter and criminal vindictiveness of Obama and his fellow Democrats, including Biden.  Should they return to power, Trump will be in mortal danger from their open corruption.  Democrats are at war with America.  Let‚Äôs defeat them.  #MAGA2020
Biden is also not in his right mind.  A presidential candidate in his condition is a complete embarassment for his party.  Trump is certainly a handful, but he‚Äôs been an amazingly effective president who keeps promises and works tirelessly for the benefit of all Americans.  #MAGA
Joe Biden is calling for a nationwide mask mandate, citing health experts' predictions that it could save 40,000 lives over the next three months. What are your thoughts on a nationwide mask requirement?
We know why the Democrats and fake news outlets like Fox CNN ABC CBS etc. are not talking about it but why are Republicans and the president not talking about the fact that Harris parents weren‚Äôt citizens when she was born therefore she can never be president when Biden stepsdown
I mean... if you weren‚Äôt invited and Biden invited Kasich and Bloomberg?
Joe Biden‚Äôs VP Pick Cements Shift to the Militant, Radically Anti-Gun Left
Hi Elizabeth! I wanted Biden to pick you, but he did the politically correct thing. Let's hope &amp; pray Ms. Harris is everything we need and more!
She does nothing but lie.    Why do you always lie? Do you still believe  accusers? Still believe he is a racist as you stated  short time ago?   Kamala Harris Lies Repeatedly in First Speech as Biden‚Äôs Running Mate
Even all around the Biden‚Äôs
Also: Joe Biden is the secret head of Antifa/BLM while *simultaneously* being a closet segregationist.
It was awful how Biden bragged about grabbing women by the pussy. Oh, wait.
Deadass all yalls reasons for why I should vote Biden are just why I shouldnt let Trump get elected. Stop pretending it's noble or patriotic to vote for him. It sucks, full stop.
I watch the president‚Äòs news conference I love the way the reporter kept saying we don‚Äôt know who‚Äôs behind it we don‚Äôt know who‚Äôs behind it when she asked about antifa Biden hook up when you type in antifa(1)

I bet Joe Biden got permission to play the song too!
Idk I mean Biden can't even say sentences correctly. Trump is terrible but I doubt Biden is the answer. Good thing there is checks and balances otherwise, whether it be Trump or Biden, America would be in worse shape then it already is.
You personally profited $300,000 dollars from PPP funds. You are a criminal and I hope the Biden administration pursues charges against all of the fraud in the PPP.

Joe Biden introduced his newly chosen running mate Kamala Harris on Wednesday, with the former vice president and California senator appearing for the first time together as the Democratic presidential ticket.
I swore during the primary I wasn't going to simp for Biden, but the amount of misinformation I see people who claim to be progressives are spewing about his policies / platforms is changing that really quickly.  Get informed. Get registered. Vote.
So the people vote for Biden and now they‚Äôre pushing them aside to replace him with Harris as always your vote means nothing in the Democratic plantation That‚Äôs what cnn is saying
I'd encourage you to read up on Biden's climate plan as well as Harris's voting record with regards to that topic before calling them evil.  They aren't as progressive as AOC / Bernie - but they have some good decisions behind them.
On yesterday‚Äôs VP podcast, your recommendation on how Biden and Harris explain the debate spat... reconciliation... perfect. Also, spot on with Harris needing work on her occasional snarky tone. Thanks.

Nah we been saying fuck the cops for months and biden done picked a fucking cop. I hate it here
The evil liars never seem to get sick with anything coming from liar45 mismanagement but it‚Äôs shameful they suck out blood of children they leave in the desert to die. Republicans will block them from being held accountable for their broken oath to America! But when Biden is in!
I definitely hope u and Biden do not win even though I don't like Trump.. sounds like u want our country in debt for grand children to have to pay the stimulus back.. 2,000 for parents plus 2,000 per kid.  That is outrageous
So it's joe biden and kamala harris, huh? ... ... ...
I'm probably going to remember Joe Biden awkwardly pawing that quadraplegic's face while telling him he's valid or whatever for the rest of my life
y‚Äôall be like ‚Äúmake sure y‚Äôall vote, but don‚Äôt vote for Biden or Trump‚Äù like huh?
Joe Biden is making his first appearance with newly chosen running mate Kamala Harris at 1 p.m. Wednesday.
I use to claim progressive until Dem primary. Bernie supporters/progressives became hostile to reality. Black people overwhelmingly VOTED for Biden and that was and still is ignored. Dont agree on policy, that's fine but the votes dont lie.
Kamala/Biden really? dems May have just lost California too! Kamala dropped out of the primaries right before she registered single digits in her home state! LOL
The kind that deals with Russian bounties on the heads of our soldiers, I hope! Vote for Biden-Harris!
actually, the point of the video was ‚Äújoe biden has a racism problem‚Äù. if you think that being the president of the united states for 4 years excuses the idea of having a (hypothetical) 6+ hour video proof of racist comments..... somn waaaay wrong here
It's strange here. Joe Biden was the choice population voted for, but government is Republican.
Duckworth is in her first term as Illinois' junior U.S. Senator.
Idk how to feel about Biden, like I hate him but isn‚Äôt Donald trump worse? I would literally vote for the squirrel in ice age over trump any day.
The fix is in. Harris is a long-tongued liar, a stooge, and a tool of a very dark agenda.   It started the day the 20 democrat candidates decided to drop out and make room for a dementia patient, Biden.  Now here we are.  Vote Trump 2020, GOP in all races.
I have been saying this ever since Biden got the nomination. They will use the 25th within 6 months of the Inauguration and Biden goes bye bye. Most important election in November! #Trump2020
Biden-Harris 2020! Vote for Joe! And Kamala!
Just imagine Biden and Harris in the White House most of the black community will be locked up
:45 into Reuters's video you see Kamala behind a Biden podium and not one mask or lonely person in sight.  Democrats revisiting the 90's fad of pox parties?
If there is one thing today I‚Äôm thankful for is I‚Äôm not in the Biden basement with crazy Joe and lose lips Harris
You literally said ‚ÄúWhite guys telling Black voters‚Äù on a Trump tweet. Figured you were talking about Trump. I think both canditates are trash either way but I def wont be voting for Biden just cuz he has a Black running mate lmaooooo
Biden literally said we aren‚Äôt Black if we don‚Äôt vote for him ü§°ü§°ü§°
For as stupid as no malarkey was, and it was so goddamn stupid, at least you knew it referred to biden ya know
I don‚Äôt like Kamala Harris, but I‚Äôm begrudgingly still voting for Biden
"Joe Biden selects Senator Kamala Harris to be his vice presidential running mate"
I stan the character development. RIP my morals but Biden üòî
Someone should print out all the tweets trump has posted since his election day and just have Biden and Harris lug it around to physically reference when asked what they'd do differently.
Leftists in the DNC had their change with Bernie, the dem party internally worked to shut him out and actively backed Biden and lo and behold he's the nominee. It's actively depressing and I think that's the idea after a certain point
And Biden not having enough of a policy or belief system to care that that's what his campaign is
I can't imagine this is anything other than the dem establishment thinking they get use fear of Trump to scrub the left leaning elements out of the party and use a Biden win as a sorta counter to Hillary showing that no, centrists don't beat fascists
anyway Biden is probably going to manage to lose now and i'm gonna go play more Shenmue
The whole Biden nomination process is wild because it's so directly disconnected to everything happening in the zeitgeist today. Like he doesn't back medicare for all, he doesn't support decriminalizing illegal immigration or defunding ICE, he's make a cop his VP
The progressive vote is going to be from mostly young voters I think, and young voters need inspired to vote. I don‚Äôt think Kamala or Biden are going to inspire the youth. I personally feel like Biden was the appeal to the moderate swing voters. He is the status quo.
The lady who has locked people up for weed then laughs on stage about giving tried weed herself. That along with her peak in the polls being 15% shows she isn‚Äôt super popular amongst progressives, which Biden needs to win.
Yes after Joe‚Äôs Announcement MAGA Biden/Harris 2020
Biden cannot be allowed to win, Harris is unhinged
So joe Biden picks up an ex cop and the biggest prosecutor of black men? Ok chief
With fewer than 100 days until the presidential election, presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden announced Tuesday that Kamala Harris will be his running mate.
BREAKING: Joe Biden has chosen California Sen. Kamala Harris as his running mate.
There are still plenty of folks who voted Trump in 2016 because they believed he was a "lesser of two evils"  If you think the VP selection doesn't matter, you're wrong.   Biden can't just look "less evil"; he has to look good.
Joe Biden is on the cusp of announcing the biggest, and possibly most consequential, decision of his political career with the unveiling of his running mate.
Thank you!! Thats how I feel. Someone suggested Biden should present his cabinet now. I think it's a good idea
If I‚Äôm doing Twitter correctly Biden‚Äôs running mate is...Bindi Irwin. #Biden2020 #biden #Veepstakes #runningmate

If Biden wins, Ron Johnson will find himself in extra deep doodoo.
Biden bought him a pizza and that's how he got his endorsement without supporting UBI
Good, because when Biden is president, he will need the revenue from the financial transaction tax to fill in the huge crater your incompetence has made in the federal deficit.
From your lips to Biden's ears, my friend. üôÇ
All talk no action Graham worthless in congress and never forget his bff‚Äôs Biden and McCain

No, I'm not voting for Trump.  I despise pedophiles so I'll be voting Biden
Biden 2020! Fuck the rube MAGA Cult
Dr. Jill Biden speaking to us!
Biden said it himself. Open your eyes. Push through the TDS
As if voting for Biden isn't wasting a vote. Your statement is utterly irresponsible and disgusting. If ANY presidential candidate were to shoot someone on 5th Ave, they should be eliminated immediately. And to express approval of such an act PROVES what is wrong in this country!
They don‚Äôt understand fully what‚Äôs about to happen.  Then when April comes along and Trump is not in office they‚Äôll blame Biden.
The name Andriy Derkach sounds familiar Ron?  It should since the Kremlin linked Ukrainian admitted he is passing you and Grassley info. He betrayed you Ronnie. Doesn‚Äôt sound like you have a problem with Russia after all.
RUN FOR THE HILLS!!! Biden called for raising levies on taxpayers with incomes exceeding $400k ü•±
djt is a soulless swamp monster that has sucked the morality out of everyone around him with his mental instability and mental incompetency. Biden is Einstein in comparison.
Rep. Kathy Castor wants Florida Congresswoman Val Demings to be the next vice president, other congresswomen including Congresswoman Karen Bass (D-CA), Senators Tammy Duckworth (D-IL), and Kamala Harris (D-CA) also made the shortlist.
Saw progressives doing this a lot with Biden clips during the primary season too.  This is an example of the media playing you.   They don't want you informed, they want you angry, because angry generates engagement and on social media engagement is profit.
I‚Äôve seen one press conference where Biden took scripted questions. Let‚Äôs not play just one side of the equation here.
Show us on the doll where Biden hurt God.  I have no interest in whatever you say about the ‚ÄúChina Virus.‚Äù  You‚Äôve already failed us.
Biden apparently thinks there‚Äôs only one black vote, because ‚Äòthose people‚Äô are all the same, unlike the gloriously diverse hispanic crowd.
Trump vs Biden Twitter war.
Combine this with the "you ain't black" if you don't vote for him and Joe Biden is looking pretty racist right now
West said ‚¨á   ‚ùå slavery was a choice &amp; Harriet Tubman didn't help slaves  ‚ùå he wears a MAGA hat and Confederate flag  ‚ùå he has a mental illness which seems to be inconsistently treated  These factors appeal more to Trump's base than Biden's
Right? I don't care if Biden picks a cactus!! Vote them all out!  And fill out your census! üòÄ
People camp on the sidewalk to get Black Friday deals, I'd line for 8 hours to vote for Biden.
Trump was literally sued for racial decriminalization over his Trump apartments.  Biden has received multiple civil rights awards and recognitions.
American voters deserve the truth about your tax returns  ! Jerk!
As funny as it is to think that Biden could hurt god,
This is also how Joe Biden sees the future of America's immigration policy so just keep that in mind when you see people not engaged with voting in a few months
It's time to cancel
Thanks for not covering Biden‚Äôs racist comment.  Your #FakeNews  reputation is intact
Lol, really? I don‚Äôt know if I can vote for Biden if he picks a VP candidate I don‚Äôt like... He could pick a corn cob &amp; I‚Äôll still vote for him. Get over yourself, ma‚Äôam.
I do not want Biden I don‚Äôt want trump. Shit fucking sucks and I don‚Äôt think either can make it 4 years into a presidency. Just focus on your local elections people.
As a white male American  &amp; Donald Trump are not only embarrassing; they‚Äôre also criminals and racial bigots!!! This is the USA not 1930‚Äôs Germany.  #Biden2020ToSaveAmerica #IamAnEmbarrasedWhiteAmerican #Biden #AmericansAreOne

We need to attack and dethrone God but all Joe Biden wants to do is "hurt" God üò†üò†üò°üò§üò†
Just like how Biden said YOU AINT BLACK if we don‚Äôt vote for him right??? ü§°ü§°ü§°
They are both racist old White men lol Sorry. Did you not just hear what Biden said in an interview the other day. He said the Black community isn‚Äôt as diverse as the hispanic community. Basically dogging us. The whole government is corrupt, I can‚Äôt believe you are falling for it
45 just said Biden is ‚Äúagainst guns.... against god.‚Äù The truly crazy part? This is all most of his base needs to hear. The Idiocracy is strong with the uneducated right.Can I suggest to my wish list that when Biden is president that Adam Schaffer‚Äôs is made Attorney General.
I am voting for Biden/Harris in 2020 for obvious reasons. Trump has committed impeachable offenses, including dereliction of duty during a pandemic. In my heart, I know that Biden/Harris will restore and unite America, and undo all of Trump's heinous actions! #BidenHarris2020
Agreed. I guess I‚Äôm just surprised because with a lot of mail in ballots coming in soon... this very much affects Biden. Especially if ‚Äúblue‚Äù areas are targeted by this nonsense.
80 percent of dems and a majority of Republicans support ending cannabis prohibition.  If biden cant even get on board with this common sense policy,  well hes obviously corrupt and only interested in his big money donors.
Biden should update his policies to reflect what his voters want then shouldn't he? After all politicians are supposed to be public servants.
What does this have to do with Biden ducking interviews and questions? Why Does the left always want to change the subject and not answer questions?
PSA calls it as they see it.  I'm a huge fan.  Biden clearly takes nothing political said about him personally.  So my response is a huge "So What?"
Some Republicans. That doesnt tell us anything. Biden is more popular with some Republicans.
These WH Press conferences always end up being China‚Äôs fault, everyday with Trump. Joe Biden‚Äôs right, Whiny!
Wow a huuuuuuuggggggee crowd must be employees of Biden and Harris
I can get over with a gradual improvement to our healthcare system. Partially because I am a realist and no fucking way that single payer will happen in the next decade and not because of Biden, because of US citizens and because of SCOTUS.
Even FDR needed to be forced left. Thing is voters actually did it. They didn't vote him in then check out. In 2010 and 2014 voters said we voted for Obama in 2008 and 2012 so we can take the election off. U want progressive change u vote Biden and progressives and in 2023

There might be reasons that Biden shouldn‚Äôt debate Trump, but your analogies make no sense. Joe McCarthy and Robert Welch didn‚Äôt run for President....also I‚Äôm pretty sure the first Presidential debate was Kennedy/Nixon. The next was Ford/Carter in 1976
Interesting. I‚Äôve never seen any group so scared to have their nominee debate as I have so much with Biden. What is the fear?
Kamala Harris, Biden's V.P. Pick, Is First Woman of Color on Major Party Ticket
They would only be satisfied with Biden/Sanders. Wait let me correct. Sanders/Biden.  It isnt about progress it is a cult of personality.  I voted for Bernie in 2016, but not a member of the cult.

Donald Trump wants to Defend the police. Unlike your side that yells Defund or Abolish the Police. Biden‚Äôs media team is just lying now
I dont know about that. The whole world, besides Russia, prefers Joe Biden. That includes the United States.
Hey Fox News why does  Biden have to pick a black I thought it was the best qualified Just to get the black vote That's what's wrong with this country today
The #KanyeConJob is a deliberate attempt to take away critical African American and millennial votes away from Joe Biden. I urge my friends and mutuals in America, who are over 18, to vote for  American Democracy is at stake in this election.
Who‚Äôs this Joe Biden you speak of
I honestly believe when Biden gives his acceptance speech he should walk down ramp holding a massive water bottle. Then take a sip out of it before he starts speaking.

Your kidding, right? Biden hasn‚Äôt had anybody ‚Äùrecovery‚Äù because he hasn‚Äôt been president! And, as others have pointed out, these are just people returning to jobs they already had. And let‚Äôs not forget the 1.2 million new unemployment claims over the last week. Bunch of idiots
Biden won't even commit to correcting cannabis prohibition which has ruined hundreds of thousand of lives and has 80% support from his party.  Simply not being trump isn't good enough.
VP Biden, I am a Vet, spent 20yrs in the US Army, I am very glad I am glad you running and no how the Military needs a good Commander and Chief. Trump has no idea how to run the Military. We need to get them codes out of Trumps hands. I got your back Joe. üòÄ
And Joe Biden is  a lesbian so we all have to pay the price !
I commended the guy, but I literally started out on my first comment by saying Biden has issues and was unsure if he could do the job.  What more do you want?  Why is it so hard for people to be critical of their own parties‚Äô candidate when they have major flaws?
This is a very valid point in that Biden actually apologized , whether it was necessary or not. Biden has tons of issues himself, and I have doubts of his ability to do the job. but humility is important when you‚Äôre a leader. Trump has zero humility.Tensions linger between Biden and Obama camps throughout 2020 primary campaign: report
I hope Biden is already picking people to head this up!  It has to happen!
So many Biden supporters on this thread. If he wins, this is the future of America. Vile, cartoon characters spewing hate.
Sigh. You stop scaring people.
I do. But we have those republicans for biden fellas like   etc. doing an AMAZING job picking up the slack.

Was thinking the same thing, it also exposes Biden for what he really is, a Trojan horse carrying all the leftist ideologies from third parties. He‚Äôs not capable of tying his shoes at this point, he bowed to BLM pressure to get a black woman as incompetent as she may be!
They have tried to throw everything at Biden and it hasn‚Äôt stuck. They really wanted either Sanders and/or Warren. They have just cut and pasted Biden/Harris into all their prepared notes.
Future Future News: Trump criticizes Biden for selecting wrestler James "Kamala" Harris as running mate. "All the video tributes about his recent death give him an unfair advantage in the polls" the incumbent president said.

Is there anyone who actually believes Biden himself had ANY say whatsoever in the selection?
Damn! Biden‚Äôs VP choice was *just* announced, and Pence is already looking for a way out of debating Harris.üòÇ

Biden could pick a tomato as the #BidenVP . I am still going to vote for him. I just want to know who it is because I am over the news constantly speculating over it.
Biden's statements are so transparently vapid and predictable, it's like they come from an assembly line.
Now the whole NBA is voting for Biden thanks to you. Keep talking you are helping elect Biden!!
That is just hilarious...More people to vote for Biden
The press‚Äôs obsession with Biden‚Äôs VP pick just shows how bad American political journalism is.  The running mate is almost never a game-changer. And candidates who try picking ‚Äúgame-changers‚Äù are running from behind.

You see I just can‚Äôt comprehend the logic, the reasoning, the grounds on which someone might say this man is better than Biden. Well aware neither is a saint but is HE the lesser of two evils? Really? Are you absolutely sure? Ok
