god  biden when he got hurted
How would you explain a non-racist being pro-segregation, like Biden was?
All of that is under the Blood. You obviously know nothing of the Lord Jesus who forgives all of our iniquity and cleans the slate when we receive Him. His sins are under the Blood! Are yours? He has plenty of fruit to show for his repentance. Biden meanwhile still lives the lie!
Is this the future you want? Then vote for Hiden Biden. Just despicable. #flattenantifa #alaska #riots2020
Yeah that‚Äôs pretty bad but he -said- that, Biden -did- sniff and touch those kids....
Oh I agree fully. I intend on voting for biden but ugh I hope he picks someone for AG that has intent to go after him and not let him off the hook.
What's Biden going to do to hurt God? Nuke heaven?
My question is the same one I have for all those who say Biden is a Christian? How do you know? Where is the fruit of that?
Biden‚Äôs dumb ass remarks about prosecuting trump is exactly why Bernie should have the nomination but I do like that he said that he wouldn‚Äôt interfere if they do. The issue is we have a repeat of Nixon and his dirty tricks. They‚Äôll make excuses to let trump off as good for
Biden on the path of Marxism TRUMP on the path of Liberty! # #WWG1WGA
There won‚Äôt be any. I don‚Äôt believe there will be presidential debates. When Biden doesn‚Äôt show up the Pres should just use the time to talk to America. Or answer the questions from the panel. It would be a great use of the time.
It‚Äôs just as insulting that whoever writes these tweets thinks we‚Äôre so stupid that we believe Biden wrote them. So condescending. Democrats think people are too stupid to make their own decisions. It‚Äôs the core of who they are. #NotableException #Deplorables

No fisticuffs God v Biden?
I‚Äôm non stop giggling over the very Catholic Biden, in fisticuffs with God.  ‚ÄúOh, you‚Äôre going down Mr. Omnipotent!‚Äù
Um. I guess it won‚Äôt be a landslide. I don‚Äôt see Biden winning Alaska no matter what Trump does. Side note‚Äî I am an Alaskan, born and raised.
just as confused as you are about why folks want Biden?!!!
IS TOM STEYER REALLY NUTS BY HOW HE PRAISED CRAZY biden???
DON'T UNDERSTAND Y biden ISN'T PICKING THE RIGHT PERSON FOR VICE PRESIDENT BUT JUST LOOKING FOR A BLACK WOMAN. W T F
At this point trumps just a deranged carnival barker who knows all he has to do is mention God or guns and it will energize his base. He‚Äôs got nothing. In one sentence he says Biden is weak and in the very next strong enough to hurt God. He can‚Äôt keep track of his own nonsense.
LETS B HONEST biden IS NOT FIT TO REPRESENT PEOPLE OR AMERICA
Kanye West's unlikely White House bid is getting help qualifying for presidential ballots in key states from Republicans around the country.
Useful idiots can never sense irony, eh? Because thinking Biden is in cognitive decline and supporting Trump couldn't possibly be not mutually exclusive.
Totally not a random staffer apologizing for Biden here.
Biden couldn‚Äôt find his way out of a paper bag with both ends open. But he would definitely be able to insult it. Come on, Man, that‚Äôs some malarkey you dog faced pony soldier. Maybe if you heated the pillow your canoe would cross the highway. ü§°ü§°ü§°üòÇ
Now do Joe Biden....
Garbage take on this election. Not supporting Biden means supporting Trump. #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica2020  #VoteBlueToEndThisNightmare
Apart from seeing President Trump sweep the floor with Biden, no.  Although Beijing Biden would be exposed for the fraud that he is!
Joe Biden says that once elected President he will not stand in the way of the Justice Department pursuing criminal charges against President Trump.
Pfft. They jump on him even though he quickly corrected himself. Yet Biden trips over the same word three times in a row and still can‚Äôt get it right.
Meant to say biden will have no need for us*
It‚Äôs like they‚Äôre all ‚Äúlook in my eyes only in my eyes. You are happy and Joe Biden is the savior‚Äù. I honestly don‚Äôt get it.
Well, that's not going to wash.  There's plenty of pictures of Biden in church!  And plenty of witnesses to him attending church.  What else you got?
Apparently I am supposed to post my bad photoshop requests. #Corypheus and #biden I guess? Or is it #dragonage?
Trump signs everywhere in Ohio farm country. Though I did see a couple Biden signs yesterday.
Like I said, their chances of winning are higher than Biden's chances of actually governing to the left of trump.  And not only do you know this, it's specifically why you support him
Biden says it's bad for democracy to try ex presidents.  We may have to settle for a plea deal: (1) we want the money back from crooked or smelly deals; for no ability to run for office again; only indemnity for  him for 2016 on...
This is insane. Trump says Biden will hurt God.
If we wait like Bernie Sanders says. We will have absolutely no leverage. Joe Biden will already be elected an will have need for us anymore.
It funny the take that the polls are not accurate &amp; rigged against republicans, yet behind the scenes they are pulling out every stop (ie.  helping/hoping  siphons votes off Biden, wanting another debate).  I think  &amp;  are worried as fuck.
Trump says, if Biden is elected, he will "hurt God." If Biden is that powerful, we should do what he says.
Thigh Land. Yo Semites.  He's like a child figuring out "Hooked on Phonics" from his teleprompter.   Hoping for a brilliant mashup of the latest idiocies to drop in front of those who say Joe Biden can't finish a sentence.
President Donald Trump accused former Vice President Joe Biden of wanting to 'hurt God' during a stop in Ohio on Thursday.
Joe Biden can apparently hurt God
The numbnuts running the WSJ opinion page let over-the-hill political hack Karl Rove "analyze" the Biden campaign. Pretty sure they couldn't be more intellectually dishonest. #FuckingMurdoch
If Joe Biden has the power to hurt God we should probably vote for him and not piss him off before he unleashes this ultimate power.
If Biden is able to actually "HURT GOD", I might actually be happy to vote for him. Still a racist. Still an ass. But hey, he can at least help me accomplish my goals of ATTACKING AND DETHRONING GOD.
EXACTLY what Trump did, favoring a trade deal over COVID response. You guys literally ignore all reality. Like mad lib political ads. Just take what  did and change the name to Joe Biden to scare white women.
Shoot Biden and then shoot myself.
"Joe Biden will bring about the heat death of the universe on inauguration day 2021."
Imagine Trump, Mitch McConnell, Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio, Lindsey Graham, Sean Hannity or some Fox and Friend saying all Blacks, except for a few exceptions, are all the same.  Yes, Biden Suoporters! You‚Äôre a bunch of Racist Cucks!
So you're saying that Biden would kill his own campaign if he were allowed to speak, but Good News For Dems, he isn't!  And in more Good News, now Trump can't rely on Biden self-destructing, which was his only hope (besides, of course, his extremely motivated base).
Dems: "Biden's not perfect, but you should vote for him anyway because at the very least, he won't do X or Y"  *1 day later*  Biden: "I can't WAIT to do X&amp;Y. I'm proud of all the X&amp;Y I've done in the past &amp; now I'm gonna do even more. Trump wishes he could get X&amp;Y done like me"
Really? Biden has no intent on transforming anything.   Where did the real Bernie go? Or were you just lying all along, taking People‚Äôs hard earned money?
Ironically enough, Biden might be one of the better choices for avoiding this, since he lived through 2009-10 and saw the consequences.
Will Biden Be The First Nominee In 80 Years To Refuse A Debate?
Biden‚Äôs going to kick your ass!! I can‚Äôt wait, since name calling is all you have!!
Reminder that racism like this isn't just something white liberals are "willing to forgive."  It's specifically *why* they like Biden
Look up I sniffed a girl an I liked it.  Joe Biden is a creep. If you support a pedophile , you people make me sick to my stomach.  #savethechildren #Trump2020
Look up I sniffed a girl an I liked it.  Joe Biden is a pedophile.  I can not in good conscious pick him.  Trumps not perfect but he told us about JFK , UFOs, and Pedophiles.  Thats why they are trying to silence him.  If Covid hadn't happened our economy was going so strong.

my immediate thought was joe ro/gan but now i see you probably meant biden lmao
INCREDIBLE!  All u whiny kiddies have proven is Biden's been out even less than we thought! The gutless wonder is terrified of the undefeatable Trump. today when a black reporter asked if he'd take the brain test DT took? JB lost it..said NO WAY 2 test. called reporter  a junkie!

The crowds favorite: #Biden #Biden2020Landslide #riots2020 üòÇ
This is so sad he‚Äôs sick man is running he has dementia and they‚Äôre using him as a pawn with the chosen president behind him whoever is chosen as vice president for Biden then they were already to hire him as challenged what‚Äôs wrong America I see it
Trump or Biden doesn‚Äôt matter. #RandomThoughts
But who will they vote for? Hopefully not Biden.
Just wondering if congress man Clyburn os a crazy as biden is. Just a thought
Biden could choose George Costanza and I‚Äôd be first in line to vote For him.
That's exactly right.  I dont know how some folks have come up with Kanye taking votes away from Biden. No he won't. He'll be taking votes away from Trump  because there are some republican voters who won't vote for Trump or Biden.
Biden will.
I understand they want to trash Biden but can‚Äôt do it by claiming Trump doesn‚Äôt do the same stuff. Try again.
And you guys are losing. #WeThePeople are sick of you and your kind. You will be going away soon, (not soon enough) then we won't have to listen to your lying, condensation any more. Thank GOD for  He is undoing all the DAMAGE you, Obama, Biden have done.
Joe Biden will not be traveling to Milwaukee to accept the Democratic nomination in person.
Why did we go with Biden?!? Arrrrrgh!!!
Ugh.....I absolutely hate trump. He is the worst and is going to continue to tear apart our country for the gain of the very few if left in office. But Biden is the best we could come up with to go against him?!?! Just so disappointed in our country since Obama left.
Biden is actually really really cool, corvette owner who tricked out his basement to be a man cave he doesn't leave. plus he has a lot of followers
Will that mean Biden won‚Äôt have to go to his funeral?
I think President Biden should let the DOJ do its thing on its own.  Biden shouldn‚Äôt touch the DOJ except for choosing who to head it.
Nope. My Dad &amp; I were talking about Biden's VP &amp; he suggested that Biden might pick Condoleezza Rice. I replied "Hmm, idk, but that might be smart. It could sway a lot of Trump-skeptical GOPers." He then clarified that he meant *Susan* Rice, to which I replied, "oh, yeah...yuck."
Biden is probably praying for Trump as it is. Because as far as the election go impeached failure 45th president Donald J Trump doesn‚Äôt have a prayer!
If you vote for Biden, he will ACTUALLY NOT be our president. #PUPPET #MAGA #TRUMP2020
Biden woos labor with job-killing policies? COVID game-changing test from¬†mining!
The strategy is obvious, the GOP is hoping that Kanye is able to syphon votes from Biden. Especially in states they predict will be close in November. It‚Äôs dishonest and a clear manipulation of the election process.
when Bernie dropped out and immediately started capping for biden is when I knew then and there electoralism will never work. should‚Äôve learned this in 2016 üò£
I think the election is going to be a lot closer than people think it is. A lot of people are going to vote for Biden simply because he‚Äôs not Trump, similarly to 2016. But the economy is not doing well. That alone could sink Trump.
Trump suffers from a narcissism so intense it‚Äôs almost debilitating , and Biden is frequently given to bizarre bouts of verbal diarrhea. And both of them frequently tell obvious demonstrable lies to make them sound better.
I don‚Äôt think Biden is a closeted White supremacist. I don‚Äôt know him, I didn‚Äôt watch the debates. I just wish ppl would stop fighting. I‚Äôd honestly feel safer with VP Pence in charge right now, than Trump, even assuming he is a closeted White Supremacist. At least his not a..
He's off his meds bipolar and an orange trump shill. #Biden
Biden got a lot of stuff done with Obama, but there‚Äôs nothing stopping him from doing an about face the second he‚Äôs in office.
The whole point of Biden was to appeal to *closet white Supremacists. How can he do that if he has a person of color as VP? Logically I get it. Cerebrally I get it. I doubt Biden will be the change Dems want to see.
That‚Äôs why is suspect Joe Biden will pick Amy Klobachar 1. Their personalities jive 2. White people, and all people really only have so much they can do, and so much bs they can handle, I prob wouldn‚Äôt want to juggle racial stuff while trying to run a country either
Joe Biden will not travel to Milwaukee to accept the Democratic presidential nomination because of concerns over the coronavirus, party officials said Wednesday.
Yes, the crazy connections of BS.  Read a couple articles, none mention Clinton or Biden.  Still waiting on the link you can share that says Biden will be indicted or heck, even charged.
The former vice president, who is 77, also tried to turn the matter back around on the 74-year-old president in the latest jousting over the two men's fitness for office.
And the Democratic Party should be ashamed of themselves for using this man as a pon they don‚Äôt even care about him if they get in it won‚Äôt be Biden as president it will be his Vice President and the whole Democratic Party Pelosi and shimmer running our country
Sorry it took me so long to react to this message but I had to let it repeat itself over and over and over again so that my happy smiley face was bigger and bigger and bigger may he rot in hell along with Joe Biden
The way Klobachar was smiling yesterday, I thought Biden was back to chasing Amy.   Just a Costco smattering/ sampling of an ideally an all white ticket seem to put a smile on her face. A little taste of betrayal from Biden. Harris looked sad the other day as the talks started
Biden accuses black reported of being cocaine junkies for asking if he has taken a covid test.  #BLM
My God you fucking lie so much!! It was Obama‚Äôs and Biden‚Äôs economy, not yours! What did you do to have a great economy?? Explain it Trump!!
It is what it is. I don't care do you? Safer with Biden.
Kanye take votes from Biden?  We‚Äôve had enough  of batshit crazy.  Instead of the Whitehouse it‚Äôs become the clown house.  WTF?
I‚Äôm sure this is going to bode well. Nothing to see here.
Literally your solution is Biden... BIDEN. Trump says and does beyond stupid shit, but the guy at least has a spine. Democrat party needs to die and something that actually represents the poverty class needs to take its place.
I actually feel sorry for Hiden Biden
I'm going to vote for Biden and Al Gross, but I don't want Al Gross just blindly agreeing to everything Biden pushes. There's a reason we have a Senate.
In my very red state, I‚Äôm afraid to put a Biden sign in my yard because Trump supporters will burn it down.
Here is Biden‚Äôs VP pick.
No way she can be in serious consideration for Biden VP. That would be unbelievably stupid.
Joe Biden has embraced the policies of the far-Left Joe Biden will RAISE your taxes Joe Biden will grant amnesty to 11 MILLION illegal immigrants And, Joe Biden will KILL American jobs
Not me, sorry.
Read Biden‚Äôs Lips: New Taxes; Historic Designation for Kenai LNG¬†Plant.
Biden does not support defunding police. Maybe a tax increase is needed to counteract the massive debt trump has built. The green new deal will create new jobs replacing coal. GOP traffics in fear not the future. Trump is anti future.
Let‚Äôs Biden in office first!! Then talk about what he is or isn‚Äôt willing to do!
I hope Biden does debate Trump! Just like Hillary did and kicked his ass!
Biden doesn‚Äôt have to debate because he can sit back and watch  the trump train wreck all the way to  Nov 3rd.
Obama / Biden set Trump up with everything they would need for the next pandemic! Trump through it away! When this pandemic hit Trump denied certain states the needed equipment to fight it. Democratic states!!
So Biden will build the United States up again from the ruins if Donald Trump
Anyone going fire Biden, has lost their minds.   #2amendmentmatters baby. #laws #reallivesmatter #stayasleep #woke
Part of the plan to have slow election returns that are highly contested.  Pelosi getting a little excited and reveals it a bit in this video.  The next President won‚Äôt be Biden or Trump.
Biden stands a chance in hell !!! #Trump2020Landslide
Honestly Joe Biden would be my ideal candidate if he became so mentally incompetent he forgot how to sign his name so nothing could be done. But then he‚Äôd probably be impeached by his own cabinet so there‚Äôs that.
Trump will destroy Bumbling Biden in a debate
After watching that interview, it wholeheartedly solidifies my vote for Biden.
Biden is not of sound mind.  People need to know what they are voting for.
Like Biden has an appropriate debate strategy?
We will get some information on November 3, even if it's just a "needle" pointing to an 80% chance of Biden win.
You should say something like "No, no; you misunderstood: I'm *NOT* voting for Biden"
Should be the No. 1 priority. If it isn‚Äôt done, illegitimate court will stop Biden at every turn. Won‚Äôt matter what Biden‚Äôs policies are.
I‚Äôm a Bernie girl but I am still voting for biden because hell no. This is not an election to fuck with!
Today's #FederalBudget Note| We have big deficits. There will be taxes. Here's one set of proposals. ‚ÄúBiden has put forward a plan that would substantially increase revenue. New tax increases would be borne almost entirely by very high-income households.‚Äù
I find it Incredibly IRONIC that tRUMP supporters think Biden has dementia, when their Leerless Feeder cannot form a cohesive sentence, despite the teleprompter in his face.  There are literally Thousands of verbal gaffs and mistakes made by the Leader of   It's SAD... REALLY
He needs to ask President Biden if it's OK.
No one? Kamala Harris is good but I think Elizabeth Warren could do an epic job. The problem I'm having is that now Biden is under pressure to pick Kamala Harris to prove he's not sexist. Can't we all try to remain objective?
This from the dopey Joe Biden, who spends his Monday mornings insulting Trump on Twitter.
Trump surrogates have been saying biden will be a disaster. Hysterical if it wasn't so bad. Millions unemployed, pandemic raging with no national leadership,  international relations in the toilet. Pretty sure most Americans are not better off than 4 years ago, except the rich.
Oooo my god. Just seen a biden ad what B.S
I just wonder if she would confront Biden like she did before bc she has something to prove.   We don't need that.  It's not her ambition that's worrisome.
Hope rises fur the change our country desperately needs: Poll vindictive in Ohio shows Biden leads Trump by 4 points in Ohio  #Biden #AmericaOrTrump
He can‚Äôt do it!! It was Obama‚Äôs and Biden‚Äôs economy not Trumps! Financial bankruptcy is Trumps gig. And Obama did it with Trumps attacks for 8 years!
why tf would you see Biden supporters for events about you
Just in time to VOTE FOR BIDEN!
I was pro-Bernie all the way. But he‚Äôs not a god. Anyone who tells me to Vote for Biden can piss off.
Biden has no plans to do that. We need a Revolution.
‚Ä¢ Former Alaska Rep. Kay Brown - Joe Biden 2020 Presidential Campaign
Biden can go fuck himself! He needs to go to a Retirement Home!
The World is coming to a close and People are dying from lack of medical care. Fuck Biden! Fuck Trump!  It‚Äôs a strong no, Bernie!
Btw I will be putting a Biden sticker, a Mexican flag, and a Nicaraguan flag on my door, just so these hoes know.
why is Biden advertising in California
Channel Denny Crane, he would know what Biden would do.
All of our best days are ahead with a vote for Joe Biden and every Dem or Independent running against Trump sycophants in the House and Senate.
No the Democrats still racist. The Democrats do not care about blacks, Latinos or any other race only if you are useful till they get that vote then kick em to the curb. There is Biden with the Grand PUH BA KKK.
The fact that the new cycle has been mainly about Biden picking a black woman, &amp; Warren isn't.  Man, it really isn't that hard.  Colored was a poor choice of words, &amp; I've apologized to those offended.
I've never voted for a Democrat in my life...but I'm voting for Biden.  via
Trump wasn‚Äôt going to get much of the under 25 crowd to vote for him anyway, but banning TikTok is going to bring Gen Z to the polls in droves for Biden
You still didn‚Äôt answer the question.  Facts are facts.  The truth is inspire of all that, black people still support Biden 90% over Trump.  Explain that.
We will....when Joe Biden steps into the Oval Office as President of the United States of America and restores American Democracy.  #JoeBiden  #Biden2020
You literally pulled out a mass of racist stereotypes as your argument.  If what you say is the case, why are 90% of black Americans backing Biden and other dems? Why are there so few black republicans and even fewer black republican elected officials? Your bias is showing.
I hope Biden doesn‚Äôt come up with excuses to skip debates.  Seems the plan is to be an invisible candidate and push mail in voting.  Strangest plan to become President ever...  people should wonder why a bit more.
It's broadly speaking correct, but I don't think modern political parties reflect the words they claim. For instance, Biden is a spectacularly conservative pick out of the choices we had. I wouldn't classify American Republicans as conservative in anything but the loosest sense.
Ignorance is bliss. Hiden Biden may pick a Marxist
The  have the vice ticket  and Rice.  They call the Vice ticket.   Susan Rice's 'Benghazi baggage,' F-bombs would make her 'lightning rod' as Biden VP pick, writer claims
The irony is that it‚Äôs People like Biden and Hillary that would have us at War on behalf of the Military Industrial Complex as an extension of all the horrible Wars that Obama had us in, which is an extension of both Bushes and Reagan‚Äôs Wars, and so on.
5} B.O./Biden hav 4th WORST GDP record in history, 2-3 IG reports will prove the low, despicable, unconstitutional level u folks have sunk 2. ive much more..not opinions, but verifiable facts. Can no longer vote Dem even if they ran against M Poppins. most shameful time my life.
You‚Äôre either with evil or against evil. We have to make a choice. And Biden/Trump ain‚Äôt it!
Not voting for slimy creepy uncle Jim Crow Joey Biden ever.
Trump ran up $3.3 trillion in pre-Covid debt. With his mishandling of the virus he is on track to beat Obama in money spent over both terms. Obama and Joe Biden left a strong healthy economy. Trump is leaving the economy descimated.   Trump has failed us all. #Biden2020
Can‚Äôt. You fucked it up so bad we have to wait for Biden to clean up the mess.
could just say that Biden's handlers are too chicken to let him debate.
Hiden Biden is staying in his basement, conserving his energy--all 3 watts of it
Exactly!  This is not the time for petty indifference. I trust Biden...whoever he chooses, I'm there.   Him &amp; his VP (whoever that might be) will need our support.  #RidinWithBiden2020
Featured candidates include Carl Johnson, Lynette Hinz; Janice Park, Calvin Shrage; Andy Holleman; Lyn Franks &amp; Rick Phillips.  Al Gross will be a guest speaker, along with speakers representing the Alyse Galvin &amp; Joe Biden campaigns.
All Republicans are going to be voted out in November.   Republicans have failed at their jobs &amp; won‚Äôt be re-hired.   Just like America‚Äôs 1st Great Depression under Hoover, it will take a Democratic President‚ÄîJoe Biden‚Äîto restore our country‚Äôs economy and ethical values.  #Biden
Most Trump voters say they will not accept the results of election if Joe Biden wins. Naming mail-in ballots as reason.
Maybe People should wake up and realize that these People only support Biden for one reason, and it‚Äôs a horrible one.  They haven‚Äôt changed. They just know where the real evil is. Think Imperialism and stewardship of the Military Industrial Complex.
Joe Biden is a Republican. And the only ones passing laws based on their Scriptures are Christ-O-Fascists such as yourself.
Oh, so Biden is plagiarizing Bernie's platform, even though we already know raising taxes on billionaires won't pay for universal health care or a $15 minimum wage
Joe Biden supporters are so fucking stupid it hurts  ‚ÄúANYONE BUT TRUMP!‚Äù NO DEMAND BETTER YOU FUCKING SHEEP
Yes because it‚Äôs not decided by the electoral college  Hillary beat him last time but he still won I can‚Äôt stand him either but come on  Also Biden is just as bad if not worse
Biden can sit in his easy chair until Nov 3 and I‚Äôll vote for him. Trump is insane and incredibly dangerous.
Yes. Can Biden best Pence? Not sure. Repubs disillusioned with a trump   Would be more likely to vote for Oence than Biden, no?
I agree with Nina Turner, Joe Biden is like half a bowl of shit, he isn't worth our vote.  We need a new political party, or we need to vote for the Green Party, the D's &amp; R's have failed America.
As Joe Biden nears the announcement of his vice presidential choice, the top contenders and their advocates are making final appeals...
?? So, you, the ACLU, 90% of the media, DNC leaders, Nazi sympathizer Soros, all socialist/Marxist ideologs, teachers against charter schools, most of Hollywood, HRC, Obama/Biden R ALL leaving? Is Vlad gonna pay for ALL the travel &amp;  U ALL free homes to thank u ALL 4 serving HIM?
Somebody posted Biden could boil babies and eat them and I would still vote for him.
Wait... if there‚Äôs Obama care... I know what‚Äôs next Biden care... boom! AMERICA WILL NOT PROSPER ! WE NEED TRUMP!!!
Oh yeah , I forgot ... Biden tapes
As Joe Biden nears the announcement of his vice presidential choice, the top contenders and their advocates are making final appeals.
What? You never beat Obama there jenius! And if you were to go up against him you would of lost because he is a better president than you ever will be. You suck as president and as a human being. Joe Biden is going to beat you unless you cheat and do illegal things which you will
And if nothing substantive happens, we will keep being told to Vote for Biden and other Bourgeoisie Candidates. Thus, Our future will consist of being slut shamed until the day we die. Those are just the facts.
Nina Turner is awesome. But let‚Äôs keep it real. She has about the same chance of being Biden‚Äôs VP as Cornel West has of being Donald Trump‚Äôs VP.
His EO that no ballot counts if postmarked after Election Day helps. But I wonder how hard it would be for a Chyna to print a ton of fake ballots to get Biden in.
I won‚Äôt thank Biden ever, unless he walks in front of a Bus.
My mother had Alzheimer‚Äôs and she had more wits about her at her death then Biden does now.  My mother was confused a lot but she never forgot who we were or where she was.
That's true.  But I believe more people should be talking about Biden's policy proposals instead of arguing with each other who his running mate should be. Its Dems once again shooting themselves in the foot.
If you are 100% about the issues (M4A, no to ICE, GND, etc...) then I am in.  If you consider Biden and Pelosi Progressives, then I am out.
Biden doesn‚Äôt have a left.
The world is on fire  And the hero we are hoping for is Joe Biden?  We are so fucked
Here‚Äôs Bill Clinton thanking  for using his Biden endorsement to destroy the Green New Deal and all that a  presidency could have wrought.
Yep, Democrats really f‚Äôed up nominating Biden.
üò≥...   CANNOT choose her for VP on this alone.
IDK. Cancelling tv ads...Those ads are pricey. Whatever he doesn't spend now he gets to pocket; no questions asked, no repercussions.The ad time is now open for Biden to book - and only 90 days to go This could be the long slow dive.
I saw today  is not recommended for VP. I suspect that is Russian propaganda, &amp; now I see why. Putin definitely wants Biden to not investigate Trump Russia. Biden is naive if he thinks he can make a deal to let them off the hook. Putin wants to keep the US on leash
Gotta poke biden with a stick wake him up lol.  Love to see trump bring all his biden donation receipts and ask for a refund for poor service
Every metric will be abused. Liking someone as a person  doesn't mean you think they, or the policies they represent, will be good for an important job. (In long run perspective, Hillary's was in the stratosphere. Biden's is merely awfully high, as is Trump's.)
Devin Nunes refuses to admit that he received a package from Ukraine designed to smear Joe Biden.
Apparently, Biden locking up record numbers of POC with his crime bill was "for their own good" according to Karen here
I was going to make up my mind on who to vote for in October but as a single-issue email voter, I'm going to have to go Biden.
I have a similar situation, but I'd say I had far more friends on the left than right. But, I've seen a lot of those on the left (particularly 2016 Bernie fans) turn into big Trump supporters. Nobody talks about Biden unless they are making a sniffing joke.
Trying to re-elect Babyhands, of course. Biden is the guy who needs to worry about Russian interference.
I would gladly move up inauguration date. The way to achieve this is for Pence to resign after the election, he names Biden VP, and then he resigns.
lol   There she is folks...she's yelling,  'look ay me, Joe Biden!  Over here!  Over here, Joe!  Me! Me! Pick me, Joe!   meeeeeeeeee! waaaaaaaaa! waaaaaa!   lol  What a piece of work  lol
VP Biden is CORRECT: You have FAILED MISERABLY! #trumpresignnow
because China inprisoning people killing them for organs to sell around the world especially here in the United States all brought to you by the Democratic Party and Joe Biden wake up America the Democratic Party coruption is nobodies friend all they care about is money and power
You are right! President Trump is terrified of the damage Joe Biden (Obama really) will do if elected. Quite frankly, so am I and a majority of Americans! What is even more scary is whom ever he chooses as VP running mate. Whom ever it is will take this country extremely far left
Funny! Joe Hiden Biden probably thinks tweet(y) is a bird!
I‚Äôll take every cent and still vote for Biden.
There is no tweeting allowed for Moneypockets Joe Biden in his BLM prison.  Joe's mummy will be seeking re-election in 2024 from his BLM grave.  Hillary as V-P.
Hmm. I guess maybe Biden and the media know tRump better than you.
She has the two most important qualifications I'm looking for in the next president: #1: Not Trump. #2 Not Biden.   So, yeah. I'm in. (But I'd vote for you over her).
For the record, Joe Biden could choose a kumquat as his running mate, and it wouldn‚Äôt affect my vote in the slightest.
Better talk to Biden! He's your guy!
No you‚Äôre not unless you cheat like you did in 2016. Polls show that Joe Biden is way ahead of you. Is this why you keep calling your puppet master Putin and cry to him. You‚Äôre extremely nuts and a total tool bag and you have screwed this country that people hate you. RESIGN!!!!!
When's the last time you heard anyone say Biden 2020?
To ALL MSM &amp; cable 'news' : assuming Biden wins &amp; somehow 'THING' escapes prison afterward, Ah don't think any of us that are interested in watching real news, and actually buy products from advertisers will want to see &amp; hear a FUCKING THING that the 'THING' has to 'say'. SHUN.
Do they think? ... The left don't.
Jill Biden
Sadly, I don‚Äôt see it happening. I wouldn‚Äôt put it past Biden to forgive Trump all his transgressions ‚Äúin the interest of unity‚Äù ala President Ford and Nixon
No mining? No renewable energy. The impact of a Biden win on oil &amp;¬†gas.
When Moscow Mitch rejects Trump's nonsense, you know it's some next-level nonsense!
President Donald Trump and his Democratic challenger, Joe Biden, both promise sweeping progress over the next four years ‚Äî via starkly different paths.
Democrats and the Republicans have been sitting on their hands to long supporting the rich now the tables have turned dont think for a minute the country will heed to Joe Biden because he is Elected Remember what is really going on with the Protestors
Via the extra $600 UI, our US govt is printing more money daily and distributing  it to Biden voters who are burning and looting their way to the November election  #UBI
Hey Putin, Biden is not going to put up with your shit!
I will support whoever Biden picks. Kamala Harris has many good qualities. But personally, I'd like Karen Bass or Elizabeth Warren more. And Elizabeth Warren has seen her share of sexist treatment during the presidential primary.
Just because some of Biden's supporters don't favor Kamala Harris doesn't mean they are anti-female. What about choosing Elizabeth Warren, Susan Rice, Karen Bass, Stacey Abrams, etc.? You shouldn't propagate strawmen arguments.
That's not the issue. Joe Biden is committed to choosing a woman VP. There are a large number of potentially good choices. Some people are acting like it's Kamala Harris or nothing. What about Elizabeth Warren? Susan Rice? Karen Bass?
They are just preparing for when Biden wins and they have to pretend to care about the national debt again
I've worked in my husband's neurology practice and saw *many times* the same behaviors in his patients who had dementia. My MIL has alzheimers. When you see it in people you know, it's recognizable in other situations. Biden surely has the onset of dementia.
Joe Biden?  Did you mean the president?
How is Joe Biden picking court nominees for
Letters to the Editor: If Joe Biden picks Karen Bass as his VP, L.A.'s major loss would be America's gain
Those aren't Karens. They're your momma. There are thousands of different women named Karen. Your memes are stupid. Hopefully, this Karen will be our next VP.
This is up there with "how come Biden only wears a mask in public, not when he's filming a speech in his house?" in terms of coherent arguments.
I'll take lackluster Biden over shrill, cuckoo Trump any day: Trump's shortcomings make weak opponent Biden look strong  #Biden #Election2020
Joe Biden equals death, when it comes to the Environment. We need to use force if we are going to make lasting change. The 1% don‚Äôt seem to give a shit about melting the Earth. So, stop advocating for supporting the 1%//Biden.
Putting your hope in Joe Biden is foolish, Brother West. We‚Äôre not going to make any headway by kissing Corporate Ass. ü§®
Still trying to get me to vote for Biden. Nope, not happening.
I identify as center-left leaning, to your surprise. I strongly believe Biden is what America needs.   Though, I am extremely disappointed with the far left and many so called 'progressives.' The actions I've seen will no doubt move many centrists further right.
Trump 2020 and beyond only trump and the American citizens in November will say and it won‚Äôt be your Biden it will be a true American and that is our president trump win in a landslide
You sold out conservatives to big tech for a new house you‚Äôre no different than Biden or Bernie Sanders.
We‚Äôll get four out for the vote of Biden in November.  #effecient
This man is a terrorist using his money to cause division in this country.  He has bought Biden &amp; Harris.  Harris has let it slip that if elected she will do an executive order to take our guns.  I did not know vp‚Äôs can do that only presidents,
Absolutely!All our energy should be on voting for Biden.  Then we can dump him off to the side or go after him.  If Biden is elected, so much goes in to fixing the mess he made for the American people and with our allies. It will keep him and us busy for  the first four years.
Wow! Together, we can Fight the Power as we enter a Brave New World. Joe Biden is the Scarecrow in the Wizard of Oz, and Trump in the Tinman. Amerikkka is the Evil Empire from Star Wars.  We need to be all new Characters!!
Do you know if there is a backup plan for when Donald Trump refuses to leave office if we had a legitimate election where Joe Biden is the clear winner? Is there a plan for if Trump refuses to leave? What if he uses direct force, and murders congressmen to retain the White House?
Is that you SMH? campaining for Joe Biden? Be careful what you wish for.....
Inappropriate, unconstitutional, treasonous... Alaskans, let‚Äôs vote Biden. I know the GOP likes to scare us that 2A is in danger, but it‚Äôs not. 2A will be fine. It always is. Plus nothing is worse than this unpatriotic traitor.
Biden a racist? I will refrain from additional remarks. Are you a Russian bot? A trump supporter?
Insurance Industry Front Group to Bombard Democratic Convention With Ads Attacking Biden-Backed Public Option -  via  I hate big insurance n big pharma.  They have # cheated working Americans out of billions and they exclude and murder people
Don't care who stops it. Trump now or Biden in 2021, but that thing needs to die - finally and forever. Find another mine in another place. #NoPebbleMine
Today's #FederalBudget Note| Even before COVID, federal deficits were on track to &gt; $1T/yr. Trump proposes to reduce revenues even further (w/o offsetting spending cuts); Biden proposes to raise revenues (but w/ spending increases). NEITHER is helpful.
Many people see Biden suffers cognitive issues and media is trying to cover for him. Neither will take questions from reporters at events. He makes racist remarks. She culturally appropriates as African-American when she isn‚Äôt. Dems continue to be the party of racism and hate.
LOL.  Right along the lines of "Biden is not capable of debating" to "Biden is a stellar debater".   HAHAHA     Trump is like a pane of glass.
Trump and Biden the same mf. USA u are f****d.
The National Association of Letter Carriers represents 300,000 people. It said Trump has long been hostile to the Post Office, calling for an end to collective bargaining rights, proposing service cuts and eyeing the possibility of privatizing the agency.
Well, here we go #Fraud Preventing people from voting.  ‚Å¶ I know you support a stand-alone bill that won‚Äôt likely pass. Will you push for a fix to this in the Coronavirus bill the Senate is blocking?
We were already going to vote for Biden!  I refer you to the Women's March that occurred when this administration began!  We haven't forgotten.
Michael Cohen has no credibility. But even Kamala Harris believes the most recent sexual assault victims of Joe Biden.
Joe Biden‚Äôs hypocrisy exposed
Dear NRI community in USA. Stay away from Joe Biden and Kamla. üôè
Are you doing endorsement ads for Biden/Harris now? Seems off-brand.
If you are in the middle of a disaster, are you going to be picky about who rescues you?  We picked Biden to offer a middle road alternative to people like you.  We are trying here, meet us in the middle.
So he said Mandatory for three months because of the election Joe Biden is already starting to be a dictator he has no authority to do so and I‚Äôm telling you don‚Äôt do it you wear your mask inside only an outside no he wants more people to die
President Donald Trump on Thursday attacked Joe Biden for calling on governors to mandate that all Americans wear masks for the next three months.
Biden‚Äôs Busing Blues.   ‚ÄòIt was just a bus‚Äô
YouTube is desperately trying to help elect Joe Biden president
They lead by example &amp; I hope that shows people the difference between Biden &amp; Trump.  Y do we still have an electoral college?Hilary would have been our President since she won by popular vote, but lost to Trump due to the electoral college.I hope history does not repeat itself.
The debate over masks has moved to the presidential race.
Kamala Harris was selected by Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden to serve as his running mate
My vote will go to the most conservative of the candidates.  My vote will go to the devout catholic.  My vote will go to the gun owner.  My vote is for a science based approach to the pandemic. My vote is for racial &amp; gender equality.  My vote is for Biden/Harris. #BidenHarris
Thank you team Biden Harris #BidenHarrisAdministration
Tweeting is nice, but more important:  VOLUNTEER.  This is how we get a Biden/Harris win!  #BidenHarris
This is why high voter turnout is KEY.  We HAVE to outnumber these voters. We all need to volunteer  the local level for get out the vote help. Local volunteering, all across the U.S., will ensure a Biden/Harris win!!  #BidenHarris2020
If Progressives continue with the Establishment in the Democratic Party, the Movement could be squashed till 2032.  It‚Äôs time for us to try a different Route and use force if necessary.  Biden/Harris is a travesty.
I‚Äôm surprised that Biden is still alive. I think he‚Äôs had a stroke or something. There‚Äôs at least a 50% chance he dies in Office.  The GOP will implode Post Trump. The Free Traders are gone, and it‚Äôs like Pat Buchanan somehow took over the Party with his views.   Who knows?
i want to support biden but i can‚Äôt get over those vids of him grabbing young girls and sniffing their hair! #CreepyJoeBiden
There is nothing left to talk about. Progressives speaking on behalf of Biden make me sick. It‚Äôs time to fight the System with force. Talk is cheap. I‚Äôm done asking nicely! Fight the Powers that Be!
Same place they make Biden. Some machine made by the KKK.
All the Bushies are with Biden now, so piss off Fascist Clown!
Better than being in the George W Bush fan club with Bill Kristol, David Frum, Carl Rove and the rest of your Genocidal Friends who now are in love with Biden.
I think Biden &amp; Harris have been wearing their masks 24/7.  Breathing their own carbon monoxide has damaged their brain &amp; their way of thinking. The Democrats keep pushing &amp; we will have a Civil War.
Stand for something or we are all moving on. Many of us are Voting 3rd Party because the Democrats are pointless. I like the few real Progressives, like you, who are fighting with all their might against the Corruption.  But We will NOT tolerate Biden or Cuck 1% Demon Dems!
I was so moved when She showed us that Biden is a Racist Asshole.
Bad take Brother West. I doubt Malcolm-X would find any hope in a Biden Presidency, whatsoever. Place wake up!!
Biggest load of crap I ever heard.  Biden said MOST votes &amp; voices in America matter, he is pos, a crook, liar, racist &amp; has abused power of his office.  Who does he pick as his vp another pos, crook, liar, racist, has abused power of her office
BIDEN ISNT A SCIENTIST! BIDEN ISNT A PRESIDENT! Trump is. Now eat üí©
Joe Biden calls for national mask mandate. Because that's what leaders do.
needs to put together a video of Biden and Harris walking up and down ramps. #TrumpIsUnwell
And it only took a couple of minutes for Lyin-Biden to come out and try to take credit for the corrupt Obama administration!
Ever watch one of the many videos of racist Biden sniffing or  grabbing children? How about Biden‚Äôs most recent accusers of sexual assault. Kamala said she believed those women.
I just watched Joe Biden on camera being asked the question and he said that everybody should be mandated to wear a mask outside everybody should be mandated to wear a mask outside
She is a liar a smear of innocent people she hates everybody that is not her she spews hatred out of her mouth every time she opens it if people vote for her and Joe Biden I don‚Äôt know what this country is going to look like because it won‚Äôt look like America our freedoms gone
Because President Trump only speaks the truth he‚Äôs never told anybody a lot about anybody and Carmella Harris is a pothead lying liberal left Democrat Joe Biden poor man has dementia
These people of You want to call him that are cahooyinh with China Pelosi said it herself in an interview she said China would prefer Biden if that isn‚Äôt colluding I don‚Äôt know what it is
Biden isn‚Äôt the fucking president!!
At least they've finally stopped railing on Biden for never having had a boat parade. That was devastating, let me tell you.
Make America great again.  Vote Biden?
They are really threatened by this woman!! That tells me how good she really is! I‚Äôm voting Biden /Harris!
I will never forget how she decididly and unequivocally knocked his dick into the dirt.  That is why I am happy she is Biden‚Äôs running mate.
Joe Biden is calling for a nationwide protective mask mandate, citing health experts‚Äô predictions that it could save 40,000 lives from coronavirus over the next three months.
They‚Äôre cracking the whip as the Plantation Owners defending the Interests of the 1%.  And anyone who defends Biden has Stockholm Syndrome.
if you believe you can bully Biden to the left I‚Äôm gonna bully you until you‚Äôre a ML
Your brain is made of absolute mush if you think you‚Äôll be able to bully Biden to the left like you truly should get out of politics if you think that‚Äôs a real strategy. that is toddler thinking. Please read state and rev
Don‚Äôt be fooled by AIPAC loving Biden either! All these Crackers are evil!
I'll try my best to vote as soon as I can for Joe Biden. I'm still waiting on my ballot to come in the mail at my old address.
Lmao Harris called Biden a racist at a dnc, now look at em.
Franklin Graham warns Biden-Harris ticket ‚Äòshould be a great concern to all Christians‚Äô  #FoxNews   These are the same 'Christians'   that claim to be 'Pro-Life'.
As long as the Republican Party has the Senate Majority, Biden (or any Democrat) will be basically powerless. We saw it with Obama and the Affordable Care Act.
I bet most of the people saying they‚Äôre voting for Biden so they can ‚Äúhold him accountable‚Äù don‚Äôt even know what Senate seats are up for grabs in November. Or how important it is to flip the Senate.
Impeached failure 45th president Donald J Trump was beaten in a landslide victory by the Biden Harris administration. It was a landslide defeat like no other election has seen in the history of the electoral college. #Bye-byeDumbAssTrump
The Senate has the real power not the president and y‚Äôall can‚Äôt even hold your senators accountable now so what makes you think you‚Äôll be able to hold Biden accountable later?
Why don‚Äôt y‚Äôall hold your elected officials accountable and make them stay in session until they reach a deal? Or do y‚Äôall just plan on holding Biden accountable once he‚Äôs president?
I second this opinion please get out n vote. That‚Äôs why they make the polls looks like Biden has it by a landslide . So people will just give up
I first read that as "Biden uses PUNS as an inspirational example..."  Almost had me there.
I'm depressed about this. What good is voting for Joe Biden if Donald Trump steals the election anyway? It would feel like a pointless exercise in democracy rather than the real thing.
Biden-Harris ticket will save our country from this MAD man, and right wing conspiracy theory media people like yourself.  #TrumpFailedAmerica  #Covid_19
Every single American should be wearing a mask when they‚Äôre outside for the next three months at a minimum.'
Joe Biden can say whatever he wants- until Joe's in the White House, his words have no weight and are therefore meaningless.  Remove. Trump. to. save. democracy. NOW.  #ImpeachHimAgain #CensureTrump
Supports Joe Biden‚Äôs sexual assault of Tara Reade!
Anyone who says Biden has done more harm than Trump is a damned fool.
Trump: If Biden gets elected, he's gonna crash the economy  The economy:
You and Biden just asked for a national mask mandate. This gives citizens an idea of how your first response is to step to over-reaching Control of the people.
Biden and Harris if ever was voted in would be the hypocritical xenophobic bigoted corrupt traitors in chiefs in the Demonrats country were laws are none existent if you break any nothing happens because: ‚ÄúNo laws for me but for the.‚Äù
So someone in Russia created an "Antifa" website and linked it to Joe Biden's campaign. Weird.
Fuck joe Biden
Next line of attack:   Joe Biden would just be a puppet of the Trump agenda. Is he actually Trump? Where's his birth certificate showing that he's not Donald Trump? Shouldn't we stay the course rather than risk electing Donald Trump?
How can GOP question Joe Biden's faith when they support a faux Christian ammoral dictator for president
Biden was involved in extrotion from Ukraine and Obamogate.
The next Biden-Harris campaign ad.
If Biden puts out nothing but reviews of sick cars for the rest of this election run up I‚Äôll vote for him.
It feels like Kamala is running for President not Biden
Not a single drug company sponsored ad supporting Biden/Harris has aired in Alaska or Chicago.
They all need to be rallying people to vote every single day, and to support not just the Biden/Harris presidency but also to denounce Trumpism and vote out every Trump sycophant enabler in every election.   #BidenHarris  #TrumpIsANationalDisgrace
Does this mean that the model says that Biden has a 3% chance of getting 470+ electors?
Kamala Harris Lies Repeatedly in First Speech as Biden‚Äôs Running Mate
And when Biden &amp; Harris continue to allow police to run rampant, continue to limit us to ineffective half-measures against the pandemic because full measures are "too expensive", &amp; refuse to bail out anyone who isn't a billionaire, guess who they'll want in 2024?  Someone else.
Biden will likely win not because people appreciate the Democratic party's "restraint" in avoiding "too much" responsibility to the population, but rather because the pandemic, police brutality, &amp; economic collapse are causing people to simply want "someone else" in charge
Joe Biden raised $26 million in the 24 hours after he named Kamala Harris as his running mate.
Thank you, Dr. Biden. Social Security is vital to retired and disabled Americans.  But why not expand Social Security for all? We can give everyone a monthly income, irregardless if they have a disability or have advanced in age.  #SocialSecurityForAll #UBI #UniversalBasicIncome
The Government is the people. The White House is just a building. Trump won‚Äôt leave? So what? Turn the power off. Turn the water off. Biden can live somewhere else and govern just fine. For that matter we can blow it up and build anew. Trump has tainted that house anyway.
Yes ma‚Äôam ... very thrilled with his choice and I think they will make a great team !! Go Biden
If you when, this nation will be divided even more than it is now!!  You are just a puppet on the string.  Hidin‚Äô Biden!!
Kamala Harris Is Perfect  - REEEeeeee Stream  via  More black peoples killed by #blm than cops this year. No Biden! These racists, bad #communists #Marxism #racist #front #wolfsinsheepswool
watching my friends go from "WOO FUUUUCK YEAH BERNIE" to "ugh fine i'll vote biden" has been fun to watch
So his long will it take to get the Biden Harris year I just ordered?  #USPSisEssential
With Kamala on the ticket I feel good. Biden's experience and her energy and new ideas, I'm finally excited.  In 2016 I wanted to stop Trump. This one is so much more than that. This is about stopping Trumpism and sending a message to the world.  We're back!! #BidenHarris2020
I want biden to lose just to see the Khive meltdown and also the Democrats really deserve it
I don't think we have to back burner it at all, if anything we need to push for progress harder. Biden was the wrong pick imo, but all over the country progressives are winning, and pollijg indicates the majority of voters are on that side of policy.
I thought Biden was at least a smarter politician than that. Of all the years to put in a cop as VP, this was probably not the year.
I assume you‚Äôre taking Biden where a cognitive decline is concerned.
Amen to that! Biden isn‚Äôt  my choice but it is THE choice I will go with to save America. To save children stolen from their parents at the border and thrown into cages. The choice I will pick to hopefully save millions of lives from death by covid. For OUR FUTURE as a republic.
Sure shows Biden in great shape!  Unlike an obese person!
I thought it was a parody. But Biden and Harris are promoting this. Not a great look for either of them.
She was nasty towards Biden she was very nasty and he told the true that she was very nasty towards biden they are evil and vile towards trump and they tell lies as they do so but trump told the truth I watched it she was nasty towards biden
Fear, violence and trauma is what the Democrats are unleashing where they govern. Biden/Harris is bad for business, bad for freedom, bad for security and safety.
Now that it's official and Biden has picked Kamala Harris as his VP, I'm wondering how  is feeling. If she could turn back time, do you think she would have claimed she was 1/1064th African American if it would help her secure a nomination?
You can‚Äôt starve a nation of decency for so long and expect us to listen to your toxic drivel. Especially not after getting what we need from Biden and Harris.
Elizabeth is keeping her promise through Joe Biden‚Äôs choice of Kamala.
Can Kamala Harris and Joe Biden Defeat Trump?
Oh please. Who has gone to the Supreme Court to overturn the ACA. It's not Biden. Trump wants to do away with healthcare, social security and medicare. Desparation makes you kue more
And if you‚Äôre not abstaining from voting or voting third party, then what is ripping Kamala apart accomplishing other than advancing a conservative agenda? Once elected, we can demand better from Biden/Harris, but criticizing them now only helps Trump.
To clarify, Biden is absolutely not remotely my number one choice and I recognize Kamala‚Äôs controversial past. It‚Äôs just baffling to me that we‚Äôre debating their backgrounds with civil rights given who they‚Äôre up against...it should be a no brainer
The fact that they're attacking Biden for being a Muslim/Sharia law-bringer makes me feel 5% less bad about them attacking Obama for it.
So if biden were president,  there'd be no deaths? How can you be so ignorant?
In  First speach with Biden. Close to quoting as I can: [Trump] inherited one of the strongest economies in history. Like everything else he‚Äôs inherited, he‚Äôs driven it into the ground. #burn #truth
Watching Joe Biden and Kamala Harris and i'm not gonna lie, it's giving me a feeling of hope for our country that I haven't felt in a LONG time. #VoteBidenHarris2020
Trump had the HIGHEST EMPLOYMENT RATE of EVERY RACE in US HISTORY!! We had a thriving economy until the pandemic. You‚Äôre delusional. Biden said as soon as he‚Äôs president he going to get busy undoing everything Trump did. As a Mexican woman &amp; small business owner, this scares me.
Watching this Biden/Harris event. Kinda forgot what coherent, articulate leadership sounds like.
I‚Äôm working from home, listening to Biden and Harris give hope back to an emotionally threadbare nation.  It is a good day.
President Biden and Vice President Harris.üá∫üá∏
America already knows...that you will not find a jacket with "I really don't care" written on the back...hanging in Dr. Jill Biden's closet. #FirstLady  #BidenHarris2020
Biden is still the lead. You didn't make America great again. You made it worse!
Can we have a tee-shirt made for Kamala that reads "Thx Donald &amp; Ivanka for the campaign donation"...and then have her wear it on the night (fingers crossed) she and Biden win? üòõ #BidenHarris2020
Donald Trump dislikes Joe Biden's new running mate so much that he donated more than once to her campaigns.
both trump and biden suck ass, but biden is the lesser of the two evils. he‚Äôs the one who will most likely listen to us and do what we, as a country, ask him too. both of them are absolutely horrendous, but we have to get trump out before he does more damage.
Good thing it‚Äôs Biden.. how would you have impersonated anyone else? üòÇ
We don't. we're concentrating on putting criminals like Comey, Strozk/Page, Mueller, Schiff, HRC, H. Biden, 3-4 RINOS, 12+ libelous news folk, et al, in jail. Then expose Obama, Biden, Rice et AL 4 illegal acts against mR Trump &amp; Gen Flynn! Wha?? you're not laughin' now, Bob???
You see Biden‚Äôs cognitive decline as your opportunity to become President.
President Trump was asked about Joe Biden's VP pick, Sen. Kamala Harris at Tuesday evening's coronavirus press briefing. The president said, "...we‚Äôll see how she works out. She did very, very poorly in the primaries..." and that he was "a little surprised that he picked her."
A Biden presidency is not objectively good; it does literally nothing to solve any of the problems we‚Äôre currently trying solve in America; that‚Äôs all I‚Äôm saying; obviously I‚Äôm voting Biden Sam I‚Äôm not an idiot, but it‚Äôs not a revolutionary act
Yes but the people who are specifically oppressed under Trump won‚Äôt stop getting oppressed under Biden, so it doesn‚Äôt matter; the only actions that matter are ones that will actually work against systemic oppression
And it will be effectively the same under Trump again or Biden; that‚Äôs our privilege
#Biden choosing #Harris as his running mate is a wink to white capitalists that he doesn't give a fuck about police brutality
Happy to have  in Alaska visiting our beautiful state! He went on record with  discussing how the #BidenHarris ticket could be disastrous for #energy workers here and across the US. Biden would end leasing on federal lands - goodbye #ANWR!  Fight on, Ted!
Russia doesn‚Äôt want Joe Biden and Kamala Harris to win in November. They should be elected on this issue alone.
I can understand voting for Biden over Trump all day long, but I cannot abide voter shaming. Its a form of abuse.  Appeal to nonvoters. Reason with nonvoters.
This past weekend I was riding bikes over on the Campbell creek trails and saw a person standing in the middle of the woods with 24x36 United for Biden sign.
The big one being corporate sellout. Biden is also clearly a classist who Isn't willing to listen to the working class which you can see in many interviews he's done where he'd rather insult someone than answer a question/concern that is brought up. Yes I know trump does the same
If y'all need to tell yourselves that Biden/Harris is a great ticket to make what we have to do in November less distasteful then go for it, but trying to chill speech about how they are not utter trash is really wierd imo
Not a good pic. Harris looks engaged. Biden looks lost. Looks like he‚Äôs smiling but with an expression like he‚Äôs not sure what he‚Äôs smiling about.
Biden is Trump...but with more Wars coming.:.. And if you‚Äôre looking for etiquette....please!!! Every other day is a Racist Tweet worthy of a David Duke....
Listen, Sellout Yuppie Takei. If You think Biden is the answer to anything, you‚Äôre a pathetic Clown. Biden is a Mother Fracker, a Prison Industrial Complex Master in Chief for Private Prisons, an ICE Maker, a Warmonger, and he doesn‚Äôt have a brain left.
Ok but also don‚Äôt you dare tell me to think about the bigger picture vis a vis Biden/Harris when all of these protests have been not just about police brutality, but that incarceration in this country is just the new face of slavery, and in America rn there is no bigger picture
I totally love Biden‚Äôs shirt ‚ÄúYou won‚Äôt have to worry about my tweets when I‚Äôm President.‚Äù  They have my vote!
I fully get it. The center left picked Biden &amp; Harris so the Right can‚Äôt play the ‚Äòsocilaism &amp; defund the police‚Äô angle against the left.  It‚Äôs gonn work, if the far left will come over and vote for a centrist law and order ticket like Biden Harris.
Today is my goal to get rid of as many fucking false democrats as I can. And by false democrats, I mean everybody who does not support Biden/Harris. Everybody else who has a weird gripe can go to hell.
Im voting for Biden but betting on Trump.
I'm going to vote for Joe Biden because his economic and environmental policies are more to my liking than Trump's but I'm not going to kid myself that either Biden or Harris care about me or my caste of society. These fucking people are delusional.
How considerate of Rs and why not spruce it up for Biden and Harris?
Sounds like you are suggesting a way to hide Biden‚Äôs cognitive challenges.
I still feel sorry for Hiden Biden. At least he can read so he must have gone to a private school! Joe Biden Reads from Script While Talking to Kamala Harris on Zoom  via
Biden got over it. It‚Äôs a good quality.
Definitely! Within MINUTES of Biden‚Äôs announcement..Trump posted his first lie-filled tweet !
I believe Biden/Harris will do more for marginalized people in one week than Trump has done in 4 years. If you want to bring about change, start on 11.4.20 after you help elect the ticket endorsed by Bernie Sanders.
Like someone said, having Trump as president is like being in a room with a 2-year old holding an automatic weapon. I‚Äôm voting for Biden/Harris because they‚Äôre adults. We can look at the fine print after we disarm Trump.
Bernie supported the NRA. For years. He voted YES for the 1994 Crime Bill. To equate Trump and Biden is ignorant, at best. As David Sedaris said, it‚Äôs like being unable to decide between a chicken sandwich and a shit and ground glass sandwich.
Well thats not entirely true, but I get the point. I honestly don't like any options they're all bad candidates, but I'd rather see a biden win than trump
What would be dumb is for anyone with even 1/2 a progressive brain to throw shade on Biden/Harris.
2 choices. Trump or Biden. What‚Äôs it going to be?
Fuck Joe Biden
Trying to deflect negative attention from Bernie while trying to smear Biden/Harris? Give it up. Bernie went the way of the buffalo. You‚Äôre helping Trump now. Knock it off.
most significant movement against police brutality and racial injustice in decades: exists  joe biden: makes a cop his vp ü§°
My Favorite part about Rumpty's Rant is his accusation that Kamala Harris was 'very disrespectful' to Joe Biden, right after he refers to Senator Warren as 'Pocahontas'! üòÇü§£üòÇü§£üòÇ
Joe Biden was 52 years old in 1994 so anybody that thinks he made an honest mistake is just being naive.
I figured Biden would pick Harris.  I didn't predict it would feel this good. Hopeful.
Only a combination of Joe Biden and Hillary Clinton could have upstaged Trump.... Trust Trump to give her a nicknameüòÄ
Lmao Kamala???? What a joke. More Prisons, less Schools. She has a good chance of being the 1st Woman ever to be VP. So sad and pathetic...just like Rapist Biden.
She's a high dollar prostitute. Called out Biden as a racist and now joins his team.
Former Republican vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin is congratulating Kamala Harris on the historic nature of being selected as Joe Biden's running mate ‚Äî and offering some advice on how best to fill the role.
Calling a  Biden/Harris ticket extreme and radical is like calling wine coolers the hardest alcohol you can drink #JoeBidenForPresident2020 #Trump2020 #KamalaHarris #BidenHarris2020
Nice meme even though Biden has been on record saying he doesn‚Äôt support defunding the police. This should‚Äôve surprised no one.
Disagree...Trump's no angel but he's not intimidated by anyone; Dems or Reps...he's arrogant and abrasive at times, but we need someone like that to fix this country. He's been true to his word on most of his promises.  Biden changes his mind with the prevailing political winds.
I got your previous comment about partisanship...bad assumption on my behalf. I wouldn't disagree with your comment about the parties. So, it's really about who is right for this country at this time...not Biden-Harris.
Biden was in office for 8 yrs as VP.  I wonder why he didn't do that...
It came out of her mouth....also said she believed Biden's accusers. I've seen Trump do more for this country in 3 yrs than I saw out of Obama in 8 yrs. I was a former Obama voter. Don't drink the Dem's kool-aid, they are liars &amp; thieves. Join the MAGA train, it's not too late.
liberals who think that racism is defined by simply things that white people do black people are the same people who think Kamala Harris is gonna save the Biden campaign in Novemberü§°
Guaranteed, decision was made FOR Biden, not From Biden. üôàüôäüôâüá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏
Wow the left is so desperate for Trump to have the tiniest slip up mean while Biden can‚Äôt even make a full sentence
Even if Biden had the answers he still couldn‚Äôt get them correct.
In choosing Harris, Biden is embracing a former rival from the Democratic primary who is familiar with the unique rigor of a national campaign.  Story:
Yes, Harris losing to Pence would be better than Biden absolutely obliterating himself - if you, like Bill Kristol, are a progressive.
I 100% agree. She would have give Biden a chance and would have been the only hope the Dems had for a viable candidate.
You must know, You are NOT voting for Biden, you will actually be Voting for his VP, so Left agenda can be fulfilled in the destruction of the American people and Country as a whole
Democrats backing Harris and Biden proves how wishy washy they are  If it‚Äôs a cop or rapist who‚Äôs a republican it‚Äôs evil and cruel, but if it‚Äôs democrats it‚Äôs fine You know as shitty as Republicans are at least they are consistently shitty
I may be crazy but today‚Äôs revelation of Biden/Harris ticket reminds me of 2 movies: Dumb &amp; Dumber, and Liar Liar.
It‚Äôs interesting, Trump says something wrong the media has a field day with it.  Biden does it and the media doesn‚Äôt care.
Yeah I only know her from her sus DA work and from everyone clowning her so thought I‚Äôd ask. I think Biden wins with this VP pick
I had not seen Biden's profile before now
I want real change and I know we‚Äôre going to have to fight for it. Bowing down to the Biden/Harris ticket is actually sending the opposite message, one that says we‚Äôre complacent enough with the bullshit that we‚Äôll allow it to happen for four more years.
Biden is not in control. They picked her FOR him.
Smart, tough and a great choice for Biden! I‚Äôm very glad he chose her..total class !!
SO LOOKING FORWARD TP DEBATE BETWEEN TRUMP N biden THAN THE ONE BETWEEN OUR VP N LYING kamala
Hopefully Biden can bail her out to put his name on the bus with hers now.
WOW JUST SEEN. biden AD ON TV. THREW UP IN MY MOUTH OT WAS SO FILL OF B.S.
Other things I won‚Äôt forget  is that you whored your way up in politics, kept innocent black men in jail &amp; stated you believe Biden‚Äôs multiple accusers. You have the exact same warmth as Hillary, that of a reptile. Can‚Äôt wait to see what else America finds out.
Biden should be in jail not running for president.
I personally think a vote for Biden is saying that the poor children that he took advantage of don‚Äôt matter. We‚Äôve all seen the videos of him touching girls inappropriately with cameras rolling. Imagine what he does when there‚Äôs no cameras around. It makes me sick to my stomach.
She may or may not be a lot of things. I would hardly label her or Biden as progressives - but they aren't fascists, and they are the best choice we have right now. Not sure how there can be any debate on the matter unless one digs what's going on right getting even worse.
In my opinion you can‚Äôt be down with BLM and vote for Biden. It‚Äôs hypocrisy.
Everybody that is down with the Black Lives Matter movement but  voting for Biden, who is/was a HUGE part of the problem we‚Äôre fighting to fix, needs to do their research. Watch 13th on Netflix. Something.
I am still baffled by the the trumpers saying they are a big tent, but reject any moderates as RINOs.  They have seriously abandoned them and forced the rep mods to vote for Biden.
Joe Biden‚Äôs pick can‚Äôt be disappointing at this point because he‚Äôs such a failure himeself  Having said that it‚Äôs disappointing lol
‚ÄòVice President Kamala Harris‚Äô has SUCH a Beautiful sound to it!!  ü§óü§óü§ó  #Kamala #Kamala #KamalaHarrisForVP  #Biden  #BidenHarris2020Landslide
Any good Biden/Harris gear? Preferably where the profits go to the campaign? The Biden site just has boring stuff for now.
Nobody cares.  #Biden  #KamalaHarrisForVP  #Kamala #Kamala #BidenHarris2020
Yeah, it's Biden/Harris!
the Biden/Harris ticket IS in favor of police reform, actually. if they win, the cops will be dual-weilding
This dynamic is perplexing.  Team #MAGA is all about supporting Police, yet their strategy is to paint Biden/Harris as tough on crime?  HUH?  I'm no Democrat, but this really seems disingenuous.  (Sarcasm)  LOL
Disrespectful women!   I love them I am one.  I‚Äôm so glad Biden picked Sen Harris.  This makes my day
Lowering expectations for Trump already?  I thought it was going to be Biden Gaffe City?
I wish Biden was the monster your think he is.
Again vote for Biden if that‚Äôs what you decide, but don‚Äôt try and guilt other people who are grappling with this difficult decision, just because need to pretend you‚Äôre not voting for a shitty person
I‚Äôm not saying you shouldn‚Äôt vote for Biden, but you can‚Äôt present him as a morally/mentally superior option to Trump, because he simply is not; if you really need to vote for ‚Äòthe right person‚Äô to make you feel like you‚Äôre doing the right thing:
Ok but for real, for a lot of people a Biden presidency and a Trump presidency are functionally equivalent; so if you‚Äôre about to make a post about how imperative it is to vote for Biden to oust Trump, just take a second and think about who in America needs help right now and who
Wow Kamala Harris as VP? Wow that‚Äôs a Top choice by Biden üëèüèªüëèüèª
Neither are my 1st choice. But we get no real progress in America until unlimited corporate spending on elections &amp; policy issues stops polluting outcomes. That requires a Supreme Court change. That requires we get Biden in and Trump out #KamalaHarris
Biden the ultimate clout chaser üòÖ
I don‚Äôt know what to say other than this. Neither are my 1st choice. But we get no real progress in America  until unlimited corporate spending on elections &amp; policy issues stop polluting outcomes. That requires a Supreme Court change. That requires we get Biden in and Trump out
I hope people that want to vote for Biden do. I don‚Äôt want Trump in office either. But forcing people to vote against their best interests is not how the DNC should‚Äôve handled things again. If Trump wins it‚Äôs bc the DNC failed to pick the right candidate to go up against Trump.
At this point almost anything is better than Trump/Pence and I'm going to try and focus on the positives of the Biden/Harris ticket, we all need to come together and get the current admin OUT. It does make me feel good to be witnessing such an important moment in history, though.
Joe Biden picks Kamala Harris as his running mate!
This is what Biden's Army will look like...
It doesn‚Äôt. Some states always vote a certain way. That‚Äôs why presidential candidates spend their time and campaign money in swing states. That‚Äôs also why you don‚Äôt see Biden ads in Alaska.
I just want normalcy again (well as much as politics had ever been). Biden is, at the very least, an actual politician so that's a come up from what we got now.
Kamala had to drop out the race because she couldn‚Äôt get the black vote what made Biden think that picking her would magically change that.
That‚Äôs nuts.  I haven‚Äôt been this happy about a VP choice since Obama chose Biden.  Honestly, I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôm MORE happy with this.  She‚Äôs incredible, and just what we need.  I can‚Äôt wait to support her for President eventually.  She‚Äôs a force of nature, exactly what we need!
No sarcasm here, btw. I support making Joe Biden into "Someone Else" as much as possible.
And also why you don‚Äôt see Biden campaign ads in Alaska. It would be a waste of campaign money.
I‚Äôll admitit, I shed a tear or thirty when  announced  as his running mate. I haven‚Äôt been this encouraged by a political ticket in many years. I‚Äôve been Team Kamala for Vice President since it became clear Biden would be nominated. It‚Äôs a great day! üíôüá∫üá∏üíô
Killary......ü§î Girl stop..... We know you're going to remove Hiden Biden. So you can fulfill your dream of being a 3X  Loser again.  She knew  she would lose  and she did it anyway. #SaveTheChildren
I‚Äôm glad I live in a Republican state because I‚Äôm for sure not voting for a Biden-Harris ticket
Gee Kamala, what changed your mind?  Hypocrite!
Does this mean Jill Biden is relieved of her duties as spokesperson for the person who can‚Äôt speak for himself?
Killary/Killmala 2020 ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£  Going to move Hiden Biden out the way. Memes gonna eat those Dems alive. Can't wait to see them.
DARK TO LIGHT NOTHING Can Stop What's Coming Clinton takes Hiden Biden place.  Welcome the Killary/Killmala Ticket
you bastards think I don‚Äôt see ur game here...take away eyes from the whole biden/kamala situation by doing a lil photograph follow-up, huh? COINCIDENCE?!?! foh I‚Äôm awake
Right!?  Who damaged the little girl who had to get bossed to school and it was all Biden‚Äôs fault. She‚Äôs a bigger liar than Biden.
I‚Äôm not surprised that Biden, the man who drafted the 1994 Crime Bill, picked this bitch as his running mate smh...
Joe Biden named Sen. Kamala Harris as his running mate, making history by selecting the first Black woman to compete on a major party‚Äôs presidential ticket and acknowledging the vital role Black voters will play in his bid to defeat President Donald Trump.
Biden is a man of his word ~ Unlike our current 'president'.
Trump says: If Biden wins, we‚Äôll have to learn to speak Chinese.  I say: It‚Äôll be worth it.
President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris!!  Finally!!  Our long national nightmare is about to be OVER!!  #KamalaHarris  #Biden2020Landslide  #JoeBiden2020  #KamalaHarrisForVP
during an unprecedented backlash against mass incarceration and police brutality, the Dems are running a Biden/Harris ticket. they know we know they don't care about winning, so they're just embracing it now. it's beyond parody.
Fucc Biden
Joe Biden selects Kamala Harris as his running mate  via  Yahoo!
Joe Biden selects California Sen. Kamala Harris as running mate
You indicated Biden was intentionally racist (which he is) and supported racist and divisive policies (which he does. And so does the Democrat party).
Joe Biden and Kamala Harris need to appear on The Breakfast Club right meow!
This only shows Joe Biden is not scared of a smart aggressive woman. Kamala will Rip Mike Pence Apart. Mark my words.
Just a reminder that Biden‚Äôs VP pick, Kamala Harris, previously said that she believes Biden‚Äôs accusers. #BidenHarris2020 #Trump2020LandslideVictory üá∫üá∏
Cue the video of Kamala attacking &amp; destroying Biden in the primary debates. Gonna see that a lot in the next few monthsüôÑ
Listening in to an "Alaska Women for Biden" town hall when they announced Kamala Harris as the VP seems like a very appropriate place to have been. And folks were thrilled!
It's official. Biden selects California Sen. Kamala Harris as running mate.
I am A MESS. As soon as I heard the news that KAMALA HARRIS is officially Biden‚Äôs VP, I called my partner and we literally just screamed at each other like little girls and then hung up. Not even exaggerating.  I am so happy I get to vote for her.  #BidenHarris2020 LETS GOOOO
Lol, Biden trying to win back some of those black votes.
Joe Biden has decided on his running mate: Sen. Kamala Harris.
Who will Biden pick as his running mate? A poll posted too late. . .
JUST IN: Joe Biden has picked Kamala Harris as his running mate. She'll be the first African American nominated for VP by a major party.
Joe Biden has selected Kamala Harris as his running mate
Kamila Harris named as Biden‚Äôs running mate
Kamala Harris is Biden's pick! üíôüéâ

Yes, good practice for when Joe Biden is on the lawn, thinking he's showing up for work
Awesome! So you are definitely voting for Biden?
This is the most annoying VP rollout ever, and I‚Äôm actually fired up about the contenders. Why is he dragging this out? Suspense doesn‚Äôt work this way, now I‚Äôm just mad lol. At this point Biden‚Äôs VP could be a tap dancing ham sandwich and I‚Äôd be like ‚Äúy‚Äôall hear somethin‚Äù
The suspense is only killing the media and team trump. The rest of us know better days are ahead regardless Biden‚Äôs pick.
Susan Rice, aka how to make Trump-skeptical GOPers and people interested in sound foreign policy (not necessarily the same demographic) much, much less willing to support the Biden campaign...
Sarah Palin was a popular Governor.  She's more qualified than any of the Dem VP frontrunners  Hell, she was more qualified than Biden in 2008, who didn't understand the role the VP plays in the Legislative branch *as a sitting senator*
Thankfully, disgruntled Bernie fans such as yourself WILL be FAR out-numbered at the polls.  Joe Biden WILL be our next awesome President of the United States of America! ü§óü§ó  Go Joe!!  #Biden2020  #JoeBiden #Biden2020 #JoeBiden2020 #Biden2020ToSaveAmerica
As someone who was raped and lost their home because of Scientology, I will hunger strike outside  home if Karen is Biden's VP pick until he picks someone else.  Scientology is a cult and a scam- it is NOT a "harmless" religion. üò°  Don't be apathetic and complicit!üíî
NO.  Karen Bass is disqualified to be Joe Biden's VP nominee because she praised and promoted the propaganda that  is a religion, when Scientology is in fact a cult guilty of rape, blackmail and murder.   Karen Bass should resign!   #DefundScientology #KarenBassRESIGN
My general view of this is that Biden has like a rock-solid base, locked in by Trump's awfulness. We're not going to see the race tighten beyond a certain point.
I suspect that this is about as tight as the race will get, and Biden has some running room as Trump continues to bungle things.
did anyone look at Michelle Obama's wiki page? I tried but I don't know how to look up edits, it was edited yesterday. I know she's just listed as a speaker at the DNC but the first thing that popped in my head was  "Biden/Obama 2020"
Totally gonna vote Biden even though he is NOT my man at all! AND you are not alone. Many have been down this trail and survived for decadesüíïüíïyou can do it!
"As President, I will do what President Trump has failed to do: listen to the scientists and experts to protect Bristol Bay ‚Äî and all it offers to Alaska, our country, and the world."
On the left is Greater St James &amp; Little St James. They both belong to Jeffery Epstien. Little St James was pedophile island. On the right is Water Island, Joe Biden &amp; Biden family own it. If you don't believe me research it yourself. I do  mean this as a political point.

It‚Äôs finally happened. I had a dream last night that Harris was announced as Biden‚Äôs VP
Sorry ass having the lack of any supplies is all on Obama and Biden they sold our factories to China and Obama didn‚Äôt have any stock piles the only thing he stockpiled was the Koran he stockpiled us the American citizens in the war in the Middle East to break our military down
Oh, you think me posting this is my way of advocating for Biden? Hilarious.
Nobody actually thinks Biden is socialist, nor has his centerist politics in the last 40 years suggested as much. In fact, Biden is more conservative than Trump.  Biden has spent a career opposing Russia while Trump licks Putin‚Äôs boots and Putin pays bounties on our troops.
Open my recent searches and who do I find? Joe Biden. I have never searched for Biden, and all my previous searches are gone. You suck
No.  Biden only wrote the bill that has lead hundreds of thousands to be incarcerated.  That's all.
President Donald Trump has never said that..... but you Joe Biden have said it... but you probably don‚Äôt remember!!
Add it to the Presidential debate. I‚Äôd love to hear Trump and Biden‚Äôs platform on the female orgasm.üòÇ
Biden is going to ask us for 6 weeks of lockdown in exchange for the $ help we need and to be as united as we can be for the duration to save lives.
I‚Äôm generally an optimist, but unless Biden wins and a whole lot of these crooks do serious jail time, 2021 will make 2020 seem good.
tRUMP doesn't represent All Americans. His Administration openly admits that $$ will flow to 'Red' states and neglect 'Blue' States.  Joe Biden won't divide America by Red and Blue.
When Biden chooses Whitmer you will look stupid for making fun of him
Yes! Joe Biden and his Vice Presidential candidate are ready to Lead Americans in a National Pandemic Response Plan and a way OUT of this COVID crisis created by  and
I cannot shake the impression that Pelosi, Biden, and Nadler are just actors in some demonic theatre.  Blackmail? Extreme cognitive dissonance? Anti-peace nihilism?
As noted previously, there won‚Äôt be a national testing strategy before Jan. 21st, and THEN only if we elect Joe Biden. So,  I‚Äôd rather see you tweeting about electing Biden than wasting time tweeting about Trump‚Äôs FAILURES. Get out the VOTE!
Quick send Joe Biden to defend the USPS!
What?  Beijing Biden is changing the narrative...again? Or did you simply forget the script?  Obviously, these words are in response to OUR Presidents comments this afternoon.
NO.   Fck Karen Bass for praising and defending the cult of Scientology. If Joe Biden picks Karen Bass, I WILL go on a hunger strike outside his home in Delaware until he picks someone else!
such a deep bench of talent, the best you could come up with was Biden
We have an #IdiotInChief  Yet  jabs at Biden's verbal gaffs!
Dues Biden even know how to tell the truth? He lies like it's second nature!
And people talk about Biden. ü§£ü§£ü§£
I can promise you that Biden knows when the NINETEEN EIGHTEEN Spanish Flu happened and when one of the two biggest wars happened/ended.   This guy was it for some of you? THIS guy? Seriously. This is getting ridiculous.

New Standards for Tailings Storage; Biden vows to sidestep law on¬†permitting.
Biden is so full of it. They don‚Äôt care about Alaska. They are just talking to get Alaskans to vote for him.
There is nothing prominent about any of these ‚Äúmen‚Äù. Since when do ‚Äúprominent‚Äù men determine the outcome or decide an election? They are power broking manipulators and are not America First. No matter who Biden picks, he will be trounced by #Trump2020 #WWG1WGAWORLDWIDE
Joe Hiden Biden would close Alaska to any and all resource development except for Seattle fishing businesses. Alaska's economy would be decimated. #alaska #ResourceBasedEconomy
Joe Biden would shut Alaska down. You think the Chinese Flu is bad. TAPS would be shut down, no mining, no coal, nothing but Seattle fishing. Joe Biden would #flattenalaska

Biden won't spend this much time Primping... Let alone have a Professional do MAKEUP! ü§£üòÇ It's past time for Americans to have a Real President, not a poor Actor.
Exactly!  Yet many have voted already for Biden, without knowing who they are voting for as his running mate....pure lunacy!  We must ensure that President Trump wins 4 more years!
Spot On, Cheri!  Biden has gained his wealth after being in office.  Amen, the dems are morally, and intellectually bankrupt!
My vote is for Biden! I trust him to pick the person he will work the best with. Those not chosen will be used to fill some very critical positions in his administration. ‚ù§Ô∏è
So you‚Äôre voting for Biden then. Awesome!
DT is NOT republican, or aligned with any party other than himself. Trumpies are willing to avoid Biden and cling to this psycho in the name of what?? I still don‚Äôt get it. Their other option is Kayne üòÇü§≠
Why do people keep saying Susan Rice? I'm sorry but that would be the most boring ticket since Gore/Lieberman. Biden isn't a dynamic candidate. He needs to pick someone to get people excited about.  That would be Harris or Warren.
Vote for Biden!üôèüôèüôè
Biden does have alzheimer‚Äôs and you need to watch a different channel trump has done more for the Americans then any other president your just used to being lied to to get your vote then they do nothing that they said  a vote for Biden is death to us
There‚Äôs people out there that are really going to vote for Joe BidenüòÇ
Jill Biden could run for VP as a woman of color, I'm sure she's dyes her hair regularly enough.
And suddenly media is real concerned about how progressive Biden.
Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden said on Sunday that if he‚Äôs elected, his administration would stop a proposed copper and gold mine in Alaska‚Äôs Bristol Bay region.
A vote for Biden means there won't be freedom for any future generations. Vote TRUMP 2020!!! üá∫üá∏üá∫üá≤üá∫üá∏

China Biden collusion
Biden could reasonably win by 10 points even
It‚Äôs 68% minority. It‚Äôs voting for Biden
i'm a bit underwhelm with Biden yet i would rather have him than 4 more years of gop
Notice how SOME from the news media are trying to get SOME democrats to reveal Biden's VP choice...before he's ready to announce? Stop...just stop.
79% Americans said that they would vote for President Trump instead of Biden and this still is not the silent majority
Shut everything down, give everyone Basic Income monthly checks, ramp up testing, keep schools closed, etc. UNTIL a vaccine is developed and enough PPE is provided to everyone who needs them to stay safe on the front lines of this out of control pandemic.  In the words of Biden-
At this point, it‚Äôs pretty easy I figure. I can‚Äôt stomach Biden. He‚Äôs a Reagan republican light, but I‚Äôd crawl over broken glass to fight anyone who tried to keep me from voting for him right now.
I'm meta-predicting that if 538 comes out with a model in the next week, it puts Biden's "nowcast" odds at 95%, and election-day odds around 75%.
Biden approval? ROTFLMFAO He will be dead before it‚Äôs ever approved.
That‚Äôs Right that‚Äôs about all Joe Biden knows how to do is ride a bike because he can‚Äôt think he can‚Äôt speak I‚Äôm pretty sure he doesn‚Äôt even know where he‚Äôs at even riding his bike that‚Äôs why he‚Äôs got a follow so many people while doing it

She‚Äôs panicking because less than 3 months until the election, Trump did the unexpected with his new EOs yesterday that made him look like a leader once again, and Biden‚Äôs numbers are slipping fast. Trump has the upper hand now and Pelosi knows it. üòÅ
You‚Äôre the Sucker if you‚Äôre voting for Joe Biden....

President Trump.  Please tell the people clearly that the goal of Mail in voting it to have issues (any issues work) that cause counts to be indeterminable.  That‚Äôs why no one cares about Biden, or even you winning.  The plan is Pelosi given vote count impossible.
Of course not.  The goal of mail in voting is to have issues that cause the count to be ‚Äúindeterminable‚Äù.  That‚Äôs why no one cares about Biden, not hearing much about the election.  If a count cannot be resolved, Pelosi becomes President.  ANY counting problem works.
Shut up Racist!  Whoever supports Biden is a loathsome Racist!
there‚Äôs something to be said about nobody really knowing what a Joe Biden sounds like pre 2020 and now everyone knows EXACTLY what his old dying brain sounds like and he might be PRESIDENT. dumb country
The Russian government is actively seeking to undermine Joe Biden's campaign in order to help Donald Trump win reelection. Sound familiar?
That will be a fun thing for Biden to deal with in his first couple of months in office
that's all ya got joe? "Hidin' Joe, Biden', aka 'bunker Biden'...only have attack dog politics, weaponizing the deaths of thousands, using covid19 2 justify hiding. u know your brain cant handle a debate. u r sick, joe. go home to your family, joe.
Hope everyone is prepared for an ‚Äúindeterminable‚Äù outcome of the election.  Neither Biden or Trump will be President because of irregularities that will not be able to be resolved.  This is why there‚Äôs no need for Biden to face voters.  Prepare for Pelosi as President.
Wonder if he is waiting for Obamagate indictments, cat and mouse between Trump and ‚ÄúBiden‚Äù.
Just look a Biden‚Äôs history. His actions speak volumes about his policies..  His support of the crime bill resulted in the incarceration of a lot of people of color.  His support of the patriot act lead to the militarization of our police. But heyü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
To be honest, most people considering voting for her weren‚Äôt voting for Biden anyway.
The fact that Biden is a cyclist (like me!) makes me like him so much more
So you don‚Äôt like what you have been doing to trump but are mad because your loser Biden got all that he had coming poor baby‚Äôs lie in your bed and you have to lay in your bed
One is pancreatic cancer, the other is brain cancer.. Both ore terrible..  Look at Biden‚Äôs record.  His history cannot be ignored.
China wants me to vote for Biden.  Russia wants me to vote for Trump. I want $20million. DM me. Serious bidders only.
Basically if Biden wins it‚Äôs simply because more people disliked Trump. We‚Äôre also voting for whoever Biden‚Äôs running mate is because there is no way he‚Äôs getting through a 4 year term with his mental state the way it is.
Y‚Äôall think they support Biden?
trump actually takes them serious as a threat. biden is too dead to be a threat to them
Joe Biden is gonna totally #JoeBiden this #VicePresident pick.
Agree.  The plan is for neither Trump or Biden to be President.  Mail in voting is key and Pelosi will be President to an unresolvable count.  They don‚Äôt care what the issues are, just as long as there are lots of them.

To make matters even more confusing, there are Scientologists pretending to be old fashioned Democrats and make a big show of publically supporting Joe Biden- but they're really trying to lure naive victims into their trap to gain trust- to get blackmail they can use against you.

NO.üëé  Karen Bass is disqualified to be Joe Biden's VP nominee because she praised and promoted the propaganda that  is a religion, when Scientology is in fact a cult guilty of rape, blackmail and murder.   Karen Bass should resign immediately!   #DefundScientology‚úä

god  biden when he got hurted
How would you explain a non-racist being pro-segregation, like Biden was?
All of that is under the Blood. You obviously know nothing of the Lord Jesus who forgives all of our iniquity and cleans the slate when we receive Him. His sins are under the Blood! Are yours? He has plenty of fruit to show for his repentance. Biden meanwhile still lives the lie!
Is this the future you want? Then vote for Hiden Biden. Just despicable. #flattenantifa #alaska #riots2020
Yeah that‚Äôs pretty bad but he -said- that, Biden -did- sniff and touch those kids....
Oh I agree fully. I intend on voting for biden but ugh I hope he picks someone for AG that has intent to go after him and not let him off the hook.
What's Biden going to do to hurt God? Nuke heaven?
My question is the same one I have for all those who say Biden is a Christian? How do you know? Where is the fruit of that?
Biden‚Äôs dumb ass remarks about prosecuting trump is exactly why Bernie should have the nomination but I do like that he said that he wouldn‚Äôt interfere if they do. The issue is we have a repeat of Nixon and his dirty tricks. They‚Äôll make excuses to let trump off as good for
Biden on the path of Marxism TRUMP on the path of Liberty! # #WWG1WGA
There won‚Äôt be any. I don‚Äôt believe there will be presidential debates. When Biden doesn‚Äôt show up the Pres should just use the time to talk to America. Or answer the questions from the panel. It would be a great use of the time.
It‚Äôs just as insulting that whoever writes these tweets thinks we‚Äôre so stupid that we believe Biden wrote them. So condescending. Democrats think people are too stupid to make their own decisions. It‚Äôs the core of who they are. #NotableException #Deplorables

No fisticuffs God v Biden?
I‚Äôm non stop giggling over the very Catholic Biden, in fisticuffs with God.  ‚ÄúOh, you‚Äôre going down Mr. Omnipotent!‚Äù
Um. I guess it won‚Äôt be a landslide. I don‚Äôt see Biden winning Alaska no matter what Trump does. Side note‚Äî I am an Alaskan, born and raised.
just as confused as you are about why folks want Biden?!!!
IS TOM STEYER REALLY NUTS BY HOW HE PRAISED CRAZY biden???
DON'T UNDERSTAND Y biden ISN'T PICKING THE RIGHT PERSON FOR VICE PRESIDENT BUT JUST LOOKING FOR A BLACK WOMAN. W T F
At this point trumps just a deranged carnival barker who knows all he has to do is mention God or guns and it will energize his base. He‚Äôs got nothing. In one sentence he says Biden is weak and in the very next strong enough to hurt God. He can‚Äôt keep track of his own nonsense.
LETS B HONEST biden IS NOT FIT TO REPRESENT PEOPLE OR AMERICA
Kanye West's unlikely White House bid is getting help qualifying for presidential ballots in key states from Republicans around the country.
Useful idiots can never sense irony, eh? Because thinking Biden is in cognitive decline and supporting Trump couldn't possibly be not mutually exclusive.
Totally not a random staffer apologizing for Biden here.
Biden couldn‚Äôt find his way out of a paper bag with both ends open. But he would definitely be able to insult it. Come on, Man, that‚Äôs some malarkey you dog faced pony soldier. Maybe if you heated the pillow your canoe would cross the highway. ü§°ü§°ü§°üòÇ
Now do Joe Biden....
Garbage take on this election. Not supporting Biden means supporting Trump. #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica2020  #VoteBlueToEndThisNightmare
Apart from seeing President Trump sweep the floor with Biden, no.  Although Beijing Biden would be exposed for the fraud that he is!
Joe Biden says that once elected President he will not stand in the way of the Justice Department pursuing criminal charges against President Trump.
Pfft. They jump on him even though he quickly corrected himself. Yet Biden trips over the same word three times in a row and still can‚Äôt get it right.
Meant to say biden will have no need for us*
It‚Äôs like they‚Äôre all ‚Äúlook in my eyes only in my eyes. You are happy and Joe Biden is the savior‚Äù. I honestly don‚Äôt get it.
Well, that's not going to wash.  There's plenty of pictures of Biden in church!  And plenty of witnesses to him attending church.  What else you got?
Apparently I am supposed to post my bad photoshop requests. #Corypheus and #biden I guess? Or is it #dragonage?
Trump signs everywhere in Ohio farm country. Though I did see a couple Biden signs yesterday.
Like I said, their chances of winning are higher than Biden's chances of actually governing to the left of trump.  And not only do you know this, it's specifically why you support him
Biden says it's bad for democracy to try ex presidents.  We may have to settle for a plea deal: (1) we want the money back from crooked or smelly deals; for no ability to run for office again; only indemnity for  him for 2016 on...
This is insane. Trump says Biden will hurt God.
If we wait like Bernie Sanders says. We will have absolutely no leverage. Joe Biden will already be elected an will have need for us anymore.
It funny the take that the polls are not accurate &amp; rigged against republicans, yet behind the scenes they are pulling out every stop (ie.  helping/hoping  siphons votes off Biden, wanting another debate).  I think  &amp;  are worried as fuck.
I want to point out- I have donated around $50 to Joe Biden's campaign despite everything. YET, donating $50 to Joe's campaign didn't prevent the cult of Scientology from stalking/harassing/gaslighting me into losing another home and becoming homeless.   Dems must do MORE...üò°üíî
Trump says, if Biden is elected, he will "hurt God." If Biden is that powerful, we should do what he says.
Thigh Land. Yo Semites.  He's like a child figuring out "Hooked on Phonics" from his teleprompter.   Hoping for a brilliant mashup of the latest idiocies to drop in front of those who say Joe Biden can't finish a sentence.
President Donald Trump accused former Vice President Joe Biden of wanting to 'hurt God' during a stop in Ohio on Thursday.
Joe Biden can apparently hurt God
The numbnuts running the WSJ opinion page let over-the-hill political hack Karl Rove "analyze" the Biden campaign. Pretty sure they couldn't be more intellectually dishonest. #FuckingMurdoch
If Biden is able to actually "HURT GOD", I might actually be happy to vote for him. Still a racist. Still an ass. But hey, he can at least help me accomplish my goals of ATTACKING AND DETHRONING GOD.
EXACTLY what Trump did, favoring a trade deal over COVID response. You guys literally ignore all reality. Like mad lib political ads. Just take what  did and change the name to Joe Biden to scare white women.
Shoot Biden and then shoot myself.
"Joe Biden will bring about the heat death of the universe on inauguration day 2021."
Imagine Trump, Mitch McConnell, Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio, Lindsey Graham, Sean Hannity or some Fox and Friend saying all Blacks, except for a few exceptions, are all the same.  Yes, Biden Suoporters! You‚Äôre a bunch of Racist Cucks!
So you're saying that Biden would kill his own campaign if he were allowed to speak, but Good News For Dems, he isn't!  And in more Good News, now Trump can't rely on Biden self-destructing, which was his only hope (besides, of course, his extremely motivated base).
Joe Biden can pick anyone OTHER than Karen Bass. Karen promoted propaganda for  and tried to normalize them, so she's OUT. The truth is Scientology is a cult masquerading as a religion to scam, lure, blackmail, and terrorize people for profit&amp;pleasure. They're evil.‚ò†Ô∏è
Dems: "Biden's not perfect, but you should vote for him anyway because at the very least, he won't do X or Y"  *1 day later*  Biden: "I can't WAIT to do X&amp;Y. I'm proud of all the X&amp;Y I've done in the past &amp; now I'm gonna do even more. Trump wishes he could get X&amp;Y done like me"
Really? Biden has no intent on transforming anything.   Where did the real Bernie go? Or were you just lying all along, taking People‚Äôs hard earned money?
Ironically enough, Biden might be one of the better choices for avoiding this, since he lived through 2009-10 and saw the consequences.
Will Biden Be The First Nominee In 80 Years To Refuse A Debate?
Biden‚Äôs going to kick your ass!! I can‚Äôt wait, since name calling is all you have!!
Reminder that racism like this isn't just something white liberals are "willing to forgive."  It's specifically *why* they like Biden
Joe Biden is innocent, you moron. Joe is guilty of giving awkward hugs and pats on the back, nothing more.  Why don't you tell people about what happened to me? Why not tell people I was harassed by Scientologists in Tennessee, and then raped at a hospital?
Look up I sniffed a girl an I liked it.  Joe Biden is a creep. If you support a pedophile , you people make me sick to my stomach.  #savethechildren #Trump2020
Look up I sniffed a girl an I liked it.  Joe Biden is a pedophile.  I can not in good conscious pick him.  Trumps not perfect but he told us about JFK , UFOs, and Pedophiles.  Thats why they are trying to silence him.  If Covid hadn't happened our economy was going so strong.
