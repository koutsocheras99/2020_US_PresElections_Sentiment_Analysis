Trump can't stop lawsuit by E. Jean Carroll, who accused him of rape: Judge
An executive order for something that already exists? How many times do we have to tell him we already have it? Trump is a pathetic waste of time.
Another example of why Trump‚Äôs unfit. How many times has he talked about requiring insurance companies to cover pre-existing conditions and been told they already cover them and have for years? Just lies &amp; bullshit from a demented scumbag.
Here to follow President Trump and fellow patriots. I follow back all patriots.  #MAGA #KAG2020
No quarter should find Trump's racism acceptable.  Those that do will be sidelined for decades.  But a Trump will rise again, when another candidate champions ignorance.  We must not fear ignorance. We must engineer it out of our republic.
I knew that Trump was an Idiot BEFORE he was President.
Very surprised Trump hasn't started using this defense yet. Only a matter of time before claims of "fake news" become "fake deaths".
The definition of progress. üëÄ ü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è ***Trump says he plans on making insurers cover pre-existing conditions ‚Äî a protection which already exists under Obamacare
Sure Russia wants Trump, especially after we completely humiliated Putin on Feb 7, 2017 in a battle at Deir al-Zor,  Syria with 600 casualties including at least 300 dead Russian soldiers.  Too bad Russia initially claimed they were mercenaries. They were Russian soldiers.
This is outstanding work.  This will move many reasonable souls.  This is dangerous for Trump.  Crank...it...up.   And let's keep it there.
We are actually dealing with militant fascists when it comes to Trump's core constituancy.  This needs to be addressed. Need to decompress these people.
Are you for real? The BEST of protections in the Affordable Care Act, which was signed into law by President Obama, the same US health system you, Mr Trump, have petitioned the SCOTUS to strike down..!? This is desperate ploy for a desperate candidate
Ok.  Norman Vincent Peale comes up in a political discussion   #WashWeekPBS full episode: President Trump defends his administration‚Äôs ...  via
Trump is helping no one. Not us. Not you. Not America. Maybe Putin.  On this point - I say very respectfully - we disagree.  I am not anti conservative at all. I have many conservative friends.  Im anti Trump.   His relations with Russia are unique and questionable at best.
That's an expensive cast of extras at Trump's club in NJ. I'm betting most of his supporters don't have that kind of cash to be a member. #BillionairesClub #NoMiddleClassNeedApply
The comments here of Trump supporters praising Trump for doing EXACTLY what Obamacare does (its been law for 10years) make me fear for their mental well being and connection with reality.
You know, we may not appreciate the magnitude of the threat to our republic right now...   If Trump loses, he goes to jail.  If Trump loses, Putin faces extreme sanctions.  Trump cannot lose.   No matter what.
88 days until the U.S. presidential elections. Why Donald Trump doesn‚Äôt deserve to be re-elected? Reason #88: Because he refuses to wear a mask.

Wow Donald Trump just invented something called Obamacare That Already Exists Trump‚Äôs incoherent new Affordable Care Act stunt is whacked out even for him!!! #TrumpHasNoPlan
Why didn't Trump pretend to invent Obamacare 4 years ago???
Not in the slightest. These are the ramblings of yet another uninformed Trump hater.
He's also not - LITERALLY - a Fascist. Those words misdirect people. The awfulness of Donald Trump and his brand of repugnance isn't particularly ideological. His ideology is me. And if some capable ultra-far-right Authoritarian comes along, he may not fit in a historical box
HUGE NEWS: Donald Trump wants you to believe that he invented "Obamacare"
Heaven help Trump if this airs prime time.   He deserves all the damage this can do.  Let...It...Rip.
TRUMP'S MAGAts will believe anything.  AMERICA IS SICK OF TRUMP'S SAME OLD SCHTIK.  WE ARE NOT SUSCEPTIBLE TO YOUR PROPAGANDA.
AMERICANS ALREADY HAVE COVERAGE. IT'S CALLED OBAMACARE.  TRUMP &amp; GOP ARE IN COURT TO HAVE IT OVERTURNED.  If Trump was serious, he'd STOP THE LAWSUIT.  You can't cover people with pre-existing conditions if THEY DON'T HAVE HEALTHCARE.
This shit has got to stop. And by shit I mean Trump.
I don't think you can dismiss Trump as an aberration, especially since the infrastructure in question was inherited from the Bush and Obama years. /1
Trump's EO is FAKE! Obamacare already protects pre-existing conditions. Trump &amp; GOP are in court RIGHT NOW to have it OVERTURNED.
FAKE!!   Americans already have coverage for pre-existing conditions.   TRUMP &amp; GOP ARE IN COURT TO TAKE IT AWAY!!  You can't cover pre-existing conditions if you DON'T HAVE HEALTH INSURANCE.

Less people working = less money going into SS and Medicare to fund those programs. Now he is suspending the tax...so even less going into it. This was his plan to get what he wanted. GOP was never going to negotiate. Trump is purposely underfunding those programs.

Idk how Trump is connected to pedo rings?  I can see that he tends to favor corporations more than mom-&amp;-pop small business. But he's against some corps who shit on Americans &amp; move employment overseas. He's taken on social media tech co.'s. But skepticism is usually wise.

That‚Äôs funny, our Democratic governor imposed truck tolls on out of state shippers that brought lots of money to our infrastructure budget and created my husband‚Äôs job. Trump signed a federal budget that cut infrastructure spending
Also, Trump in 2016 said, ‚ÄúThis is the United States government, first of all, you never have to default because you print the money, I hate to tell you, OK?‚Äù  By the way, I predicted Trump was going to win the day he announced his run, ask my in-laws...
I'm voting Biden and am a proud American. üá∫üá≤  Patriots, our enemies want Trump.
Trump is a thug, he paid someone to take his SAT, he declared bankruptcy 5 times &amp; has very questionable DB loans, he has the social, political and cultural horizon of a guy from Queens who watched Bonanza avidly. Without Fred's bread he'd be a used car salesman on Northern Blvd.

No. Not another dime to that evil charlatan. Trump has stolen enough already. Obama needs nothing from us that he hasn't already earned. And COVID relief is a bottomless pit we need to fill as a nation.
Are you blind? Do you read? Or have you let Trump poison your mind. So many have no access just due to race. There are so many rural areas that have to travel miles, often by foot only to be turned away. Wake up!

Donald Trump is the President of the United States. New York is part of America. Seattle is part of America. Portland is part of America. Can you imagine President Obama waiting for mayors in red states to tell him what to do while the country is going down in FLAMES! NO WAY!

Worse. The first attempted Coup d'Etat in American history.Nobody is in jail. And President Trump is all over fox news telling us: " I don't want to get involved. I want to stay out of it." Folks! Republicans don't care a damn about what we think! Pathetic. Tragic. Sickening.

I think in addition to handheld, the fact that the interviewer's interjections are at the same volume as DT and he peppers them throughout as Trump rolls on with his monologue is very powerful.
It‚Äôs one of the best interviews that show how shallow Trump really is and that he really is t a very well educated person. He may have graduated but did nothing to improve upon that education since college

The Trump-McConnell government has condemned us to a world where we put our families at risk every time we go to the grocery store, and people are seriously discussing how many kids, families, and teachers they're willing to let die so we can go back to pretending things are fine
I think your asking me.  What I ment is that the last time trump didn't like what someone said, he had them "clean up" what they said.  To make it sound more in line of what Trump wanted.
Or make her make a statement back tracking what she said.  That seems to be the line of action when Trump doesn't like what the person said.

Trump gives Chinese owner 45 days to sell TikTok
I don‚Äôt care what anyone says.. Donald Trump is banning Tik Tok because a bunch of kids made him look foolish in Tulsa üòÇüòÇ
President  has ordered an unspecified ban on "transactions" with the Chinese owners of the consumer apps TikTok and WeChat.

Does Tencent have any shares in Hasbro? That would make the micro transactions of  and  illegal under the new Trump executive order.  #mtg #boardgamesTrump can't stop lawsuit by E. Jean Carroll, who accused him of rape: Judge
An executive order for something that already exists? How many times do we have to tell him we already have it? Trump is a pathetic waste of time.
Another example of why Trump‚Äôs unfit. How many times has he talked about requiring insurance companies to cover pre-existing conditions and been told they already cover them and have for years? Just lies &amp; bullshit from a demented scumbag.
No quarter should find Trump's racism acceptable.  Those that do will be sidelined for decades.  But a Trump will rise again, when another candidate champions ignorance.  We must not fear ignorance. We must engineer it out of our republic.
I knew that Trump was an Idiot BEFORE he was President.
Very surprised Trump hasn't started using this defense yet. Only a matter of time before claims of "fake news" become "fake deaths".
The definition of progress. üëÄ ü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è ***Trump says he plans on making insurers cover pre-existing conditions ‚Äî a protection which already exists under Obamacare
Sure Russia wants Trump, especially after we completely humiliated Putin on Feb 7, 2017 in a battle at Deir al-Zor,  Syria with 600 casualties including at least 300 dead Russian soldiers.  Too bad Russia initially claimed they were mercenaries. They were Russian soldiers.
This is outstanding work.  This will move many reasonable souls.  This is dangerous for Trump.  Crank...it...up.   And let's keep it there.
We are actually dealing with militant fascists when it comes to Trump's core constituancy.  This needs to be addressed. Need to decompress these people.
Ok.  Norman Vincent Peale comes up in a political discussion   #WashWeekPBS full episode: President Trump defends his administration‚Äôs ...  via
Trump is helping no one. Not us. Not you. Not America. Maybe Putin.  On this point - I say very respectfully - we disagree.  I am not anti conservative at all. I have many conservative friends.  Im anti Trump.   His relations with Russia are unique and questionable at best.
That's an expensive cast of extras at Trump's club in NJ. I'm betting most of his supporters don't have that kind of cash to be a member. #BillionairesClub #NoMiddleClassNeedApply
The comments here of Trump supporters praising Trump for doing EXACTLY what Obamacare does (its been law for 10years) make me fear for their mental well being and connection with reality.
You know, we may not appreciate the magnitude of the threat to our republic right now...   If Trump loses, he goes to jail.  If Trump loses, Putin faces extreme sanctions.  Trump cannot lose.   No matter what.
88 days until the U.S. presidential elections. Why Donald Trump doesn‚Äôt deserve to be re-elected? Reason #88: Because he refuses to wear a mask.
Trump's postmaster general just fired two dozen executives!

I can‚Äôt tell you how many people think this is not a big deal. I get so much BS from family members who think this is overhyped, the media exaggerating, and that It‚Äôs Democrats trying to ruin Trump and the economy. It‚Äôs exhausting.
There are many reprehensible characteristics if Donald Trump, but his racism should bear no tolerance in any quarter.  Retweet this until he's gone.
Wow Donald Trump just invented something called Obamacare That Already Exists Trump‚Äôs incoherent new Affordable Care Act stunt is whacked out even for him!!! #TrumpHasNoPlan
Why didn't Trump pretend to invent Obamacare 4 years ago???
Not in the slightest. These are the ramblings of yet another uninformed Trump hater.
He's also not - LITERALLY - a Fascist. Those words misdirect people. The awfulness of Donald Trump and his brand of repugnance isn't particularly ideological. His ideology is me. And if some capable ultra-far-right Authoritarian comes along, he may not fit in a historical box
HUGE NEWS: Donald Trump wants you to believe that he invented "Obamacare"
Heaven help Trump if this airs prime time.   He deserves all the damage this can do.  Let...It...Rip.
TRUMP'S MAGAts will believe anything.  AMERICA IS SICK OF TRUMP'S SAME OLD SCHTIK.  WE ARE NOT SUSCEPTIBLE TO YOUR PROPAGANDA.
AMERICANS ALREADY HAVE COVERAGE. IT'S CALLED OBAMACARE.  TRUMP &amp; GOP ARE IN COURT TO HAVE IT OVERTURNED.  If Trump was serious, he'd STOP THE LAWSUIT.  You can't cover people with pre-existing conditions if THEY DON'T HAVE HEALTHCARE.
I don't think you can dismiss Trump as an aberration, especially since the infrastructure in question was inherited from the Bush and Obama years. /1
Trump's EO is FAKE! Obamacare already protects pre-existing conditions. Trump &amp; GOP are in court RIGHT NOW to have it OVERTURNED.
FAKE!!   Americans already have coverage for pre-existing conditions.   TRUMP &amp; GOP ARE IN COURT TO TAKE IT AWAY!!  You can't cover pre-existing conditions if you DON'T HAVE HEALTH INSURANCE.
And #Trump got the nerve to say we have the best economy in U.S. history. #FakePresident
The "boos" from the country club crowd about not wearing masks... wow. They're paying 350k dollars a year to be members of Trump's Death Cult.
Trump must have lost at golf this afternoon because he seems particularly testy and angry.
TRUMP IS IN COURT TO TAKE AWAY YOUR HEALTHCARE.  HIS EO IS FAKE!!  IF HE MEANT WHAT HE SAID HE'D STOP THE LAWSUIT.
Less people working = less money going into SS and Medicare to fund those programs. Now he is suspending the tax...so even less going into it. This was his plan to get what he wanted. GOP was never going to negotiate. Trump is purposely underfunding those programs.

Idk how Trump is connected to pedo rings?  I can see that he tends to favor corporations more than mom-&amp;-pop small business. But he's against some corps who shit on Americans &amp; move employment overseas. He's taken on social media tech co.'s. But skepticism is usually wise.

No deal after another week of negotiations between Democrats and Trump administration officials over a second stimulus package.

TRUMP DOESN'T CARE AMERICANS ARE DYING.  TRUMP ONLY CARES ABOUT HIS RE-ELECTION.  TO KEEP HIM FROM PRISON.
EXPECTATIONS EXCEEDED ALRIGHT.  TRUMP WANTS AMERICANS TO FORGET WE ARE DYING BECAUSE OF HIS CONTINUED LACK OF LEADERSHIP.
TRUMP WANTS TO DEFUND SCHOOLS WHO DON'T FEEL IT'S SAFE TO REOPEN.
That is such a stupid take on both governing and the stuff that Trump gets ‚Äúdone‚Äù that it has numbed a section of my brain. I hope it recovers.
LINDSEY GRAHAM THINKS TRUMP DOING NOTHING TO SOLVE THE COVID-19 CRISIS IS GOOD.
TRUMP &amp; LINDSEY THINK THIS IS GREAT.

Anti abortion does not equal pro life. Trump neglects the poor, the mentally ill, the stranger, the migrant, and worst of all will continue to leverage war against other countries for financial gain. But go ahead and judge me for not voting for your anti abortion candidate.

Anyone who votes for Trump should move to Russia after this election is over. Maybe they‚Äôll like it there better.
That‚Äôs funny, our Democratic governor imposed truck tolls on out of state shippers that brought lots of money to our infrastructure budget and created my husband‚Äôs job. Trump signed a federal budget that cut infrastructure spending
Also, Trump in 2016 said, ‚ÄúThis is the United States government, first of all, you never have to default because you print the money, I hate to tell you, OK?‚Äù  By the way, I predicted Trump was going to win the day he announced his run, ask my in-laws...
I'm voting Biden and am a proud American. üá∫üá≤  Patriots, our enemies want Trump.
Trump is a thug, he paid someone to take his SAT, he declared bankruptcy 5 times &amp; has very questionable DB loans, he has the social, political and cultural horizon of a guy from Queens who watched Bonanza avidly. Without Fred's bread he'd be a used car salesman on Northern Blvd.

To be fair, I am too. But I'm not an old, rich, white male who has been in political office for the past 30+ years and is now saying in only the past 4 years has it gone horribly wrong. He is held to a very low standard which bodes well for someone who is scrutinized like Trump

Trump accidentally banning League of Legends, Fortnite, World of Warcraft, and quite possibly other games may be the only thing that convinces 18-29 year-olds to get out and vote equal to their share of the electorate.

Are you for real? The BEST of protections in the Affordable Care Act, which was signed into law by President Obama, the same US health system you, Mr Trump, have petitioned the SCOTUS to strike down..!? This is desperate ploy for a desperate candidate

Trump is helping no one. Not us. Not you. Not America. Maybe Putin.  On this point - I say very respectfully - we disagree.  I am not anti conservative at all. I have many conservative friends.  Im anti Trump.   His relations with Russia are unique and questionable at best.
That's an expensive cast of extras at Trump's club in NJ. I'm betting most of his supporters don't have that kind of cash to be a member. #BillionairesClub #NoMiddleClassNeedApply
The comments here of Trump supporters praising Trump for doing EXACTLY what Obamacare does (its been law for 10years) make me fear for their mental well being and connection with reality.
You know, we may not appreciate the magnitude of the threat to our republic right now...   If Trump loses, he goes to jail.  If Trump loses, Putin faces extreme sanctions.  Trump cannot lose.   No matter what.
88 days until the U.S. presidential elections. Why Donald Trump doesn‚Äôt deserve to be re-elected? Reason #88: Because he refuses to wear a mask.

Wow Donald Trump just invented something called Obamacare That Already Exists Trump‚Äôs incoherent new Affordable Care Act stunt is whacked out even for him!!! #TrumpHasNoPlan
Why didn't Trump pretend to invent Obamacare 4 years ago???
Not in the slightest. These are the ramblings of yet another uninformed Trump hater.
He's also not - LITERALLY - a Fascist. Those words misdirect people. The awfulness of Donald Trump and his brand of repugnance isn't particularly ideological. His ideology is me. And if some capable ultra-far-right Authoritarian comes along, he may not fit in a historical box

TRUMP'S MAGAts will believe anything.  AMERICA IS SICK OF TRUMP'S SAME OLD SCHTIK.  WE ARE NOT SUSCEPTIBLE TO YOUR PROPAGANDA.
AMERICANS ALREADY HAVE COVERAGE. IT'S CALLED OBAMACARE.  TRUMP &amp; GOP ARE IN COURT TO HAVE IT OVERTURNED.  If Trump was serious, he'd STOP THE LAWSUIT.  You can't cover people with pre-existing conditions if THEY DON'T HAVE HEALTHCARE.
This shit has got to stop. And by shit I mean Trump.
I don't think you can dismiss Trump as an aberration, especially since the infrastructure in question was inherited from the Bush and Obama years. /1
Selfish Trump supporters ignore the law putting Americans at risk of death . . . again.
Trump's EO is FAKE! Obamacare already protects pre-existing conditions. Trump &amp; GOP are in court RIGHT NOW to have it OVERTURNED.
FAKE!!   Americans already have coverage for pre-existing conditions.   TRUMP &amp; GOP ARE IN COURT TO TAKE IT AWAY!!  You can't cover pre-existing conditions if you DON'T HAVE HEALTH INSURANCE.

Less people working = less money going into SS and Medicare to fund those programs. Now he is suspending the tax...so even less going into it. This was his plan to get what he wanted. GOP was never going to negotiate. Trump is purposely underfunding those programs.

Trump Hoaxed America  via
At the age of (almost) 27, I shouldn‚Äôt be as sad about this as I am
We can respect that Bush ‚â† Trump, but can we please not pretend he was a good President, or that he didn't also have really odious policies?
Biden vs. Trump... pretty big one you're missing there bud
woweee having a moment mourning the people i used to think were cool in high school but have just been revealed to be trump supporters
All you care about Angela Stanton King are the awful, racist and corrupt values that the once respectable Republican Party has decided to adopt under Trump and  loss all respect because of Trump's racist, corrupt and pro- Putin values
ACLU files nearly 400 cases versus Trump
They‚Äôre holding the livelihood of Americans hostage. No more jobs, fun, or socializing until Trump loses.
Relax dude. I‚Äôm a Trump guy 100%.
Hurt God? Impossible  Very clear what Trump meant is that Biden, &amp; more importantly, the extreme-Left for which Biden is a tool, are not good news for people of faith &amp; lawful policies that are in-line with G-D's moral law.  Hard to argue against. Meanwhile Seattle burns Bibles.
That would be my fault for telling God, "I don't care what the cost, please make it so Donald Trump is not President in 2021". He may be a vengeful God, but he does keep his deals
No, he's POTUS until January 20th when his term ends. If he loses, he pardons all his stooges, resigns, &amp; Pence pardons him. That's always been the plan.  You seriously didn't think he was leaving office w/o a pardon  He's #Individual1. Cohen did time for crimes committed w/Trump
If you can muster your way thru "The Trump Prophecy" on Netflix, you will have context to this question and many future sleepless nights.
Sorry, NOPE!  DONALD TRUMP'S DAY SO FAR:  - Thinks Thailand is "Thighland" - Thinks clothes dryers use water - Trump claims Joe Biden will "Hurt God" - That sound you hear is desperation - New York dismantling NRA - Trump Organization is next - Trump is going to prison
Supporting tRump
No it doesnt BECAUSE ID LITERALLY RATHER VOTE TRUMP THAN BIDEN. Fucking take the W when I decided to vote third party, YOURE WELCOME.
Can someone clarify something for me, is Joe Biden the Antichrist or not because trump said that Biden will destroy Godü§∑üèΩü§∑üèΩü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£
Trump was the first to ban flights from China, and the Democrats  called him Xenphopic for ding that, and saved lives ! Hypocrite Nancy , down in her District saying come down to China Town,  absolutely no problem here , Hypocrisy at its worst !
Trump is virus you have to agree to catch.
Also convicted spies
you are missing the point. You say you don‚Äôt want 4 more years of Trump so the choice is obvious. A write in vote gets trump a vote closer to fulfilling your fear. Biden promised his cabinet will ‚Äòlook like America‚Äô I trust that. VP pick is important he has many great choices.
The only reason it would matter is if Biden picked Trump as his VP.
The Eva Braun to America‚Äôs first furhrer - Donald Trump.
I‚Äôm just saying, we need to have a Trump vs. Biden Thunderdome match for the Presidency in November. I‚Äôll even sing, ‚ÄúWe Don‚Äôt Need Another Hero,‚Äù to sweeten the deal.
Biden won‚Äôt hurt God but Trump might hurt Jesus‚Äôs fist.
MORE FAILED TRUMP &amp; GOP POLICIES.
WHAT ABOUT TRUMP BANKRUPTING OUR FARMERS?
WHAT ABOUT TRUMP'S FAILED TARIFFS?
supports Trump, who's in OH talking about "Thighland" &amp; how Biden's going to hurt the Bible, hurt God &amp; that there will be NO MORE WINDOWS! Oh! And a vaccine available on ELECTION DAY!  GOP HAS AGAIN RUINED OUR ECONOMY &amp; DO NOTHING ABOUT THE PANDEMIC  VOTE THEM OUT!
Trump Campaign is spending time posting articles from a SATIRE WEBSITE because the PANDEMIC IS SO FUNNY.
I love so much about the South and Southerners, and it saddens me greatly that the South has become ‚ÄúTrump Country.‚Äù I hope there are a lot of Eddies out there.

Pence knows too much and Trump's going to need a pardon. If Trump brings Haley on board she'll have to agree to pardon him when he loses and Pence will need to keep his mouth shut. That's a lot of "ifs"
No. He should not be on tv, asked for his opinion, anything. He chose to work and lie for Trump. Zero fucks is what I have for him.
PolitiFact | Yes, a Trump lawyer helped Kanye West try to get on Wisconsin‚Äôs ballot
No, they did last week. Trump RV, +1LV high turnout, even low turnout.
speaking of Rampgate ... did you see this amazing musical version of Trump‚Äôs explanation?
He was talking about the economy in general. NOBODY BEATS TRUMP AT TANKING THE ECONOMY. 33% drop in GDP.  Never in 240 years!
Vote for Trump, because otherwise it means you hate God. You don't... hate God, do you?
The lack of vocal opposition is due to choosing to live life without being attacked for supporting Trump.
I agree.  Trump will have at least 62% of the vote...at least.
It sure does for most decent Republicans who've left the party. The GOP is DEAD. They've forgotten their values. They stand for NOTHING. They stand for Trump.  You're just a spoiled little princess who thinks everything she has to say is important.
Atheist implies a non belief in deities. Trump constantly references god. Constantly.
DONALD TRUMP IS WEAK ON CHINA.
And we KNOW you and Trump certainly don't.  If you're getting suspended from social media for POSTING FALSE INFORMATION ABOUT A PANDEMIC or defending someone that posts FALSE INFO that could GET PEOPLE KILLED, you should sit down.
Wth is trump going to debate, how to kill thousands of people??? Lol get real

Trump is gross
Hate to tell ya, Matt, but like Dorothy in the "Wizard of Oz", we've had the power to silence Trump all along. Unfollow! Unfriend! Life is so much better without listening to that jackass bray, and he makes less sense by the day. #Presidementia
Trump has us On Our Knees and grieving for our country‚Äôs current state of chaos and deaths. We need Biden who knows how to grieve and knows personally the ways out of grieves depressions...  Biden a decent man to ‚Äúget us thru‚Äù.
joining Peter on today's panel are two paid operatives of the Trump campaign, famous General Michael Flynn's son, and, as always, our dear friend and iconoclast Van Jones.  Today's topic:  why is Joe Biden so unlikeable?
He was denied by one priest because Father did not like his pro-life stance. I cannot support Trump - he is much worse.
There are several influential conservatives I follow who criticize Trump plenty...are most likely not voting for him...but NEVER spew lib propaganda or take up the socialist cause. A true conservative knows the nature of our ideological opponent.
maybe what Trump called Epstein Island?
I‚Äôm not concerned about black voters, I‚Äôm concerned about that group who don‚Äôt necessarily like trump but they love to piss off liberals. This is a group i don‚Äôt think we talk about enough
LOOK WHAT TRUMP DID TO OUR ECONOMY! Never before in 240 years have we EVER had a 33% drop in GDP.
This is what Obama and Biden did. TRUMP HAS RUINED OUR ECONOMY.
TRUMP HAS FAILED FARMERS. MORE FARMS HAVE GONE BANKRUPT OVER THE PAST 4 YEARS THAN AT ANY TIME IN U.S. HISTORY.
TRUMP HAS WRECKED A THRIVING ECONOMY THAT OBAMA AND BIDEN HANDED HIM.  In 240 years the U.S. has NEVER had a 33% DROP IN GDP.  #TrumpVirus  #TrumpDepression
Not voting for Biden is a vote for Trump but you know that Meggie. You‚Äôve always known that. NO ONE IS SURPRISED BY YOU EVER.
TRUMP's "payroll tax cut" is a way to TAKE AWAY YOUR SOCIAL SECURITY.
TRUMP &amp; GOP are in court to take away OBAMACARE DURING A PANDEMIC!
So is 100,000 other famous mfs y‚Äôall refuse to acknowledge you doing more bad than good if the goal is getting trump out
TRUMP BANKRUPTED OUR FARMERS
TRUMP FAILED TARIFFS!
Trump has overseen the worst stock drops in US history and the biggest GDP drop in 240 YEARS!   Barack Obama and Joe Biden took the economy out of freefall from GWB Admin and handed you a THRIVING economy which YOU WRECKED!
This coming from a lifelong lib. A conservative could possibly not vote for Trump...but would never vote for what Biden and the rest of the socialists are promising.
There are so few differences between Trump and Biden that I literally covered them ALL in that thread so I've summed it up. I'm not voting for Trump, that's ALL YOU GET FROM ME. Dont think you have ANY flexibility to persuade me.
With OUR tax $$ GOPigs want to cut unemployment by $1,600/mo, seek a release of corporate liability for their donors so they can put workers in harm's way, NO stimulus for Americans, nothing for USPS or schools, but Trump wants to remodel the West Wing, prop up his hotel andüëáüí©
Remember...Trump doesn‚Äôt kid. He outright told them to slow down testing.
I see what you're sayin here Meghan...but you gotta admit that many who carry the "Never Trump" mantle...are proving that they are not conservative. No conservative would ever say some of the things coming from their mouths. (not talking about criticisms of Trump)
I'm not confirming ANYTHING, because I'm not supporting either so it doesnt even matter, but if you think my vote for Green Party is a vote for trump, you are sorely mistaken in thinking that I'm deciding between green party and biden, rather than green party biden and trump.
THE ONLY FAILED LEADER IS DONALD TRUMP.
WTF are you even talking about?  Fox Spews doesn't even show what's really happening in the REAL world.   Donald Trump is FAKE NEWS.
Everything Trump says is a gaffe. Come on, do better.
If you don‚Äôt vote for Biden regardless of his vp pick you‚Äôre voting for trump
He did no such thing. Americans recognize Trump needs to go. They're sick of his lies and bullshit.
Are they goading people to get out and vote for Trump? I like it.
I don‚Äôt support Trump.
is a brilliant resister at some polling outfit confirming for Trump &amp; Co. that ranting about when he uses a toilet he needs to flush 10-15 times ... polls well?    if so, i love it, especially later in the summer.
Trump will donate funds straight from his charity.
But that's the thing: Trump and Republican are currently synonymous, short
Jonathan Swan is never going to be more widely recognized for anything he does, for the rest of his life, than he will be for looking down at a paper and then looking up in abject, dismayed disbelief at Trump's nonsense.
It would mean the end of America as we know it If  's handlers get elected 2 run this country Joe is a literal mess with no spine that has been seen in years America needs Trump now if it is 2 survive as an individual nation, Not part of some Globalist experiment
Well Trump will magically win NC, and split tickets invite attention  That was the whole of my calculus
Kamala Harris as VP pick, the #SettleForBiden  crowd will vote for her when Biden steps out of the race at the last minute despite all of her glaring issues. When Trump wins, the Left will blame it on racism and sexism. I hope I'm wrong.
probably shortlist for Pence's VP after the big announcement that Trump has done it--we are great again!-- here's a pardon for the whole clan ...
What always infuriated me about this was a lot of white liberals in particular finger-pointing at the white working class as if their middle class or wealthier parents, grandparents, cousins, aunties, etc. didn't vote for Trump.
Honestly happy to see employees raise these very legit concerns. I keep getting Trump ads and by no means am I their target audience. They can‚Äôt even use data to market well.
Anyone dare me to put a TRUMP flag on my motorcycle...in communist Massachusetts  !?
The NRA, televangelists, Trump are just some of the bottom feeders who have discovered just how easy it is to con poor, angry white people into giving them money.   The result? They end up poorer and angrier and perfect targets for more conning!

Hold on and fasten your seat belt! We are in for the most horrific months prior to Nov election with Foreign interference Trump welcomes. Attacking our postal system during a pandemic requiring the safety of mail-in ballots. GOP senators investigating Biden and son using Russia.
Yeah. The evidence this week is really hard to ignore: GOP backing.  In 2016, it took a lot of luck and underhanded tactics to sneak Trump in. They lined up and got the deed done. We have to keep an eye on every tactic.  I'm with you, hope and all.

A nice vision with nobody at all to lead it. Trump is only the symptom. McConnell and a party of quislings are the disease. There are no conservatives in the Republican Party anymore. Just traitors.
They're all liars, especially Trump. Twitter took down his campaign page, because of all the COVID misinformation
Frank, a simple direct unencumbered ‚Äúno‚Äù would have been an answer. Wallace didn‚Äôt ask Miller about 2016. He didn‚Äôt ask about democrats. He asked about Trump‚Äôs 2020 campaign and Miller couldn‚Äôt or wouldn‚Äôt simply utter ‚Äúno.‚Äù
Another excuse found months after your comments.. we all heard your reactions or lack of reactions sending tens of thousands to die...  Trump is a morally corrupt man.

OMG!!! After the Allie's Donuts thing (ding in Bidondi/Trump), he should have "Bionic Dan Bidondi's Italian Donut Shop" but OMG... just researching local Democratic State Senators here in Warwick pulls up those blasts from past that make me laugh so hard!
Donald Trump does not know right from wrong and has no class whatsoever! He must leave his residence as soon as possible! If need be, BY THE SEAT OF HIS PANTS!!!
It‚Äôs mind boggling.  This sums up how I feel about Trump
It is important for the media to put Biden on the spot about what Trump era horrors he will overturn. The scope of unlegislated damage is vast, deep and a Biden presidency needs to be specific as to what they will get rid of and what they will quietly keep.
What are you on?  Same as tRump?
This is the Trump effect... he goes by Ted, but his name is really Rafael, but to appease those White folx, he goes by Ted. He's Latino, take all of his achievements away, he's Latino, just like a black Democrat or Republican.
Mike Murphy is smart, funny BUT dead wrong here. Burn, sink and drown the feckless GOP Senate with Moscow Mitch lashed to the mast. The Bulwark and Lincoln Project boys and girls gotta fight a two-front war v. Libs &amp; Trump‚Äôs GOP Tories. Earn anew the voters‚Äô trust in ‚Äò22 &amp; ‚Äò24.
Everyone's mad that Trump did nothing to prevent outbreak of Covid-19 in New York but if he had banned travel altogether you'd all be bitching about your rights. Nobody is listening to the guidelines anyway so really you're all just looking for someone else to blame. How typical.
Really hits the sweet spot between anti-vaxxer nonsense &amp; sensible skepticism of Trump.
Do you think there's a single person- who would otherwise vote for Biden - that would switch to Trump because of the Benghazi boogeymanning that Rice will be subjected to?  Nah - that's strictly right wing meat.
Your fixation on Trump‚Äôs family while turning a blind eye to Biden‚Äôs is amusing but sad.
... meanwhile your buddy Biden has his dope addict son working no show jobs in Ukraine and China but that‚Äôs okay too? How about the Iran nuke deal? How about the Ibama DOJ spying on Trump? How about the CCP virus?
Lou, you know that Trump is more delusional than even you. And you‚Äôre out with the chickens.
I‚Äôm not dodging anything, that‚Äôs what you are doing with this constent stream of questions. The jist is; You are fixated on Trump‚Äôs family but D. Feinstein can have a Chinese spy for her driver while her husband make millions of of Chinese deals and that‚Äôs okay?
Unlike President Trump, Joe Biden has spent his career backing trade deals that have killed U.S. jobs and hollowed out American manufacturing.

I totally agree. There is a time &amp; place for criticism but during condolences isn‚Äôt it. No matter what the man does, there‚Äôs a certain sector that will always criticize his actions.
To this day, I cannot believe Ben Carson is really a Dr.  I think he is a paid actor on Trump‚Äôs payroll and a token Black.  No Dr could be that stupid. Science is based on theory. Not rumor.

Putin seems to be influencing Trump.
True.  Trump doesn‚Äôt want anyone to know he is vastly uneducated.
OPEN THE SCHOOLS. But maybe delay the elections?  Does this guy even hear what he‚Äôs saying. Schools don‚Äôt impact him directly. The election obviously will. Trump cares nothing for the people. Just remember his word on pandemic death ‚Äúit is what it is‚Äù
It is all about the money.  The postmaster general will shut down the post office so we are without the most reliable institution of our lifetime.  Then he will contribute 20 million to Trump‚Äôs re-election.  This is not in our best interest.
Gee.  This sounds like Trump ignoring Putin paying bounties on Americans in Afghanistan.  Why is he wearing ignoring this?  Is he the Commandee in Chief ?
Trump is a bully.   He wants his faulty assessments publicized by experts to qualify them.  It is his modus opererandi.
How do you know he was not directed by his infamous boss to say that ?  Trump is a bully.
Dr Birx is obviously afraid of Trump who will punish anyone who doesn‚Äôt deliver a message that makes him look strong or wise.  She is a coward.
Trump pretends he did not know John Lewis.  Fact is, he did not support any of John Lewis‚Äô philosophies on human rights.
I  have never heard anything more irrational than Trump saying less testing = less Covid.  If the virus is active, it must be identified and isolated.  If not, it will spread.  And kill.
And he listened and conversed, rather looking for opportunities to spring planned traps.  Be a journalist without an agenda. Trump may do great (unlikely) or  act like a bag of rabid squirrels.  A journalist shouldn't be overly invested in either outcome.

Honestly I don't even care what Biden thinks at this point, Harris is the presumptive president, she is the one who's policies and choices actually matter to me.
That you would likely serve in a Biden admin is one reason I would never vote for Biden.  And this is one of many reasons I'm proudly voting for Howie Hawkins:    #HawkinsWalker2020
1. Obama and Biden didn't spy on anyone.   2. Carter Page is not Trump.   3. Trump's Campaign had over ONE HUNDRED illegal contacts with Russians and LIED about ALL OF THEM when approached by the FBI.  4. There was VALID RUSSIAN INTERFERENCE in our election.
Yea this is the most perplexing thing when I hear people promoting biden

Where would foreign policy be right now if Clinton were President? Would some form of the TPP have been enacted, giving U.S. based multinational corporations even more power? Did Trump simply delay what a Biden administration will carry out in the next 4-8 years?

Their desperation has turned the flu season into the end of the world. People will start believing that if Biden is elected the main stream media will start reporting on it as just the flu and the anxiety, hysteria and fear will dissipate.  Join my army or die.
What's going on Donnie is that it's impossible and unnecessary to dispute Biden's truthful statements while your lies invite challenge.
The black vote for Democrats is not a given. Which is the point I'm trying to make, which you skipped right over and went to 99%. Biden has already made it clear that he thinks we're stupid, Kamala has already made it clear she'll play any card for votes. She tried to come off as

The Q: was any part of latest rumor true, which encompassed: was she interviewed by Biden and/or his team? Did she fly out of state for the interview on specific date last week? "No." Amended Friday to: "I know she has not left the state. I don‚Äôt have any information beyond that"
Funny, I always say that Biden is racist and that I can't find any difference between him and Trump. Your powers of deduction are lacking as well as your comprehension and overall cognitive abilities to begin with. And you try to speak for blacks constantly. Do you know any?
. outperformance in the veepstakes raises the odds she'll be a serious contender for a position in the cabinet should Biden win
As recently as last week, we asked again if any part of rumor that  had been interviewed by Biden or his team was true.  The answer from her spox was: ‚Äúno.‚Äù Only AFTER ‚Å¶ piece did same spox clarify: she did not go out of state.
Well seeing how it's a video of only Joe Biden speaking unedited, you're right don't watch if you're offended by liars
Biden himself might be a little cringeworthy.  Harris tho? She'll go the 12 rounds, and then some.  Honestly, the ticket should be flipped.
Why isn‚Äôt she speaking at the convention? The  has abandoned the whole ‚ÄúBiden is the bridge to the future‚Äù before his nomination.
What are you going to do on the chance that Trump is re-elected? There's always a possibility since he wasn't "supposed" to be elected this past election cycle. What if Biden losses and you get Trump for 4 more years? Then what?

I would argue that genocidal dictators are not actually leftists because authoritarianism is a fascist ideology. That being said, for context, the person writing that tweet above was comparing being rude to a Biden canvasser to being an asshole in the alt-right lol

can you try for a minute looking at the situation a different way?    your vote belongs to no one but you.    but there is one candidate who is a significant danger to all of us, especially those already in need.  a vote for anyone but Biden does not help get rid of Trump.

Yes. He was talking to Charlamagne Tha God.
He's not the impeached, treasonous, utter moron who's squatting in the White House right now.  In reality, Mr. Biden has a laundry list of qualifications for this job, but at the end of the day he's the anti-Trump, and THAT is what is going to win him this election.
The world has been laughing, excluding, and moving on without the US with Treasonous Trump, the impeached idiot, squatting in the White House.   President Biden will restore dignity and respect to the US, and to his office.
you can't assume the "leading candidate" would otherwise get the votes the "spoiler" candidate gets. I for one would never vote for an imperialist hawk like Biden. you're wasting time berating people for their convictions that you don't even seem interested in understanding.

Tia please give it up. You I have no problem with me not voting for Trump but my reasoning for voting for Biden is that he is racist, has voted against minority interest for years including seeking out segregationist to work with him against busing. Those little gaffes you speak
WATCH: Here's what  told  two weeks ago about being vetted by the Biden campaign.
I tried to give these people the benefit of the doubt but I gave up on that months ago. I had a few people cussing me out because I don't want to vote for Biden. It's okay that I'm not voting for Trump but I'm a selfish egotistical person for not voting for Biden even though I've
Electing them at all is the opposite of holding them accountable. Biden opposes busing and writes the crime bill and his reward is he gets to be president? Kamala uses her power to keep prisoners because they‚Äôre valuable labor and she gets to be VP?
RI has one of the highest rates of Covid-19 infections among Black residents, per this  map
If they were an adult then I legitimately don‚Äôt see what would be inappropriate about responding the way she did. If I was a victim of sexual assault I‚Äôd be pretty snappy too if someone tried to get me to make calls for Joe Biden.
I agree it‚Äôs their fault! I‚Äôm not trying to trap you into saying anything, as someone who wants trump out so badly that I‚Äôd settle for Biden even though I don‚Äôt agree with him on alot, and as a fellow progressive, I‚Äôm curious to understand your point of view.
According to the   had a "standout" interview with Biden's search team and left the team "dazzled."
It‚Äôs not bad faith! Like I supported Warren but when she dropped out,I supported Bernie bc he champions many of the same progressive causes that are important to me. I didn‚Äôt want Biden or any moderate, and I‚Äôm not thrilled about it but I sure as hell will vote for him over trump
Ok yay! I think you answered my question. Bernie is the only candidate you would support. It‚Äôs not just Biden, you wouldn‚Äôt have voted for anyone but Bernie, regardless of how closely policy aligns. Thank you!
'Antifa' website cited in conservative media attack on Biden is linked to ‚Äî wait for it ‚Äî Russia
You mean the mfg jobs that Obama said were never coming back?  The ones that we lost due to NAFTA. Which Biden promoted
Someone needs to put out a challenge to post any Biden flags if they see them.
Great read. The final four in serious contention for the job were Harris, Rice, Warren and Whitmer.
It's either Carte Goodwin or Joe Biden, and I think it might be the latter.
If I had to show people two clips to sum up the 2020 primary, it would be this (ending the Bloomberg run), and the always awesome clip of  meeting Joe Biden in the NYT elevator.
Is that how you going to answer Biden during the debates ?  " Ahhhh...".   Lol
I'm not going to vote for the lesser of 2 racists. If you can tell me what Biden is going to do for minorities that's going to improve things, let me know. Biden has voted AGAINST minority interest his whole career. WHY should I trust him NOW? Obviously YOU have LESS to lose.
This does of course depend entirely on Biden diverging from the Obama Doctrine of "looking forward not backward"   i.e. overlooking the crimes of powerful people because they happened in the past, while overseeing the world's largest ever prison state for nonviolent offenders.
I guess at least if Biden is president he probably won't attempt to block  from delivering ballots in an effort to steal an election
Okay, since I dislike both Trump and Biden but I hate Biden's aw shucks form of racism more, you just talked me into voting for Trump. Since I can't have an opinion unless I vote. Nice job!
And the sad thing is that you would hesitate to vote for Biden.
How Biden Chose Harris: A Search That Forged New Stars, Friends and Rivalries
Well you seem very confident about November. I am considerably less so. Biden has to make it through 3 debates.
‚ÄúNothing will fundamentally change‚Äù joe Biden
Don‚Äôt you support Joe Biden?
How Biden Chose Harris: A Search That Forged New Stars, Friends and Rivalries
. reports  aced her interview to be the VP pick - but Biden team worried about ‚Äúher limited national profile and adversarial relationship with influential labor unions‚Äù
Some of these are certainly compelling arguments but I‚Äôm not fully convinced on all the points. Regardless this is a far more convincing argument than ‚Äúget over it‚Äù or ‚Äúanything other than a vote Biden is a vote for Trump‚Äù.
Then why are you demanding loyalty and a vote rather than fighting for better policies. Biden‚Äôs still hasn‚Äôt been named as the nominee till the convention. Why would you stop making demands? Especially now? It‚Äôs a pandemic depression. Millions are losing their healthcare
I‚Äôm not voting for trump. I hear that‚Äôs a vote for Biden
Biden and Harris are fascists too bro
Mozilla is like Biden for me. I‚Äôm not always crazy about it/him, but in comparison to the alternative it‚Äôs no contest and I must support 100%
Satan Bill Gates Satan Fauci Best friends and 2 hands in either deadly Comm virus makers Satan China Bioweapin Genocide Lab Killers! Millions of Dollars to the deadly Wuhan Lab ! Satan Gates and Satan Fauci were evil roommates in College! Satan Biden‚Äôs Son mullion dollar loan
I get that entirely and I usually agree. Let's talk about the Presidential race, though. America needs Trump to lose. Trump is fascist, Biden isn't. I mean, at this level, that's all that matters to me right now. I should have worded the original tweet better.
Extremely fucked up that Joe Biden has plagiarized all of his speeches from Molloy. We should‚Äôve known after his 15 minute bit at the Iowa State Fair about sucking on pebbles.
I‚Äôm garbage because?... I said yelling at people and name calling doesn‚Äôt recruit voters. Ok.   How many calls have you made phone banking for Biden today?
All I hear all day long is how great Biden is at this or how wonderful Biden did that. Biden, Biden, Biden!
Guys some people are constantly bullying me over Biden choice they say I am progressive deep state agent
I'm getting a kick out of everyone that lambasted Ted Cruz for backing Trump after he got eviscerated by him during the debates only to go "YAAAASSS" at Biden picking the woman who called him a racist and said she believed the women that accused him of misconduct.
Not when Joe Biden is president The world is already laughing at us because of you because of your ignorance and stupidity world leaders laughing at us you‚Äôre worried about UAE  we have lines of Americans trying to get a box of food you are the worst president ever
Another way that the DEMS can try to cast the   ticket as one that reflects 21st century America.  Going forwards, not backwards. Biden's age may get in the way of that messaging, but this is why Harris' background helps.  #Election2020
Honestly, if I am the Biden campaign, I am putting Kamala on television every day. Trump will lose his mind. (If there's anymore of it left to go.)
By the way, have you ever wondered why Kamala Harris is good enough to be for VP but NOT president? How come 2nd best? There was so much diversity in the Democrat candidate pool, young, gay, Asian, female, whatever Liz Warren was that day. How'd you get old, white, racist Biden?
The world is currently laughing at Trump because of his botched handling of COVID-19 amongst other things including his fanning the flames of racial tensions. A Biden and Harris will restore honor and respectability to the U.S. #BidenandHarris2020
To anyone who may have purchased a baseball cap from the Biden online store, how is the fit?
I‚Äôm quite jealous of the folks excited for the Biden/Harris ticket. Like wouldn‚Äôt that be nice?
Biden ought to make this an issue, particularly with seniors and veterans. This president is taking away your mail delivery because he's afraid he might lose an election. Seriously.
Add THIS to bribing the Ukraine to go after Biden with false charges.

Nobody is sweating like Judgey Jeanine today after her death "premonition" about Joe Biden last night. She'll be getting a visit from the FBI. Perhaps another suspension from Fox Spews.

Biden can't manage his own sentence structure or thought processes and she thinks he can manage the virus recovery. I'd love to hear his answer to why the virus suddenly spiked in the south and west and what he would have done to stop it?

Trump really needs to stop talking about Biden when he really is talking about himself!

TECHNOLOGY IS A POWERFUL WEAPON. DEMOCRAT VOTERS USE TWITTER TO PUT PRESSURE ON THEIR LEADERS IN THE DEMOCRAT PARTY-DRIVE-BY MEDIA. IT WORKS! WE, REPUBLICAN VOTERS, SHOULD AND MUST DEMAND THAT THE BARR DOJ QUESTIONS BIDEN AND OBAMA! THIS IS WAR, DAMN IT! WHERE ARE THE FBI RAIDS?
They mean the FIRST ATTEMPTED COUP D'ETAT in American history. Apparently. For Durahm and William Barr. Obama and Biden, the LEADERS OF THE ATTEMPTED COUP, are above the law. It's not too late for the VICTIM, President Trump, to appoint a SPECIAL PROSECUTOR. THIS IS WAR, DAMN IT!
And people think Biden is the one with cognitive issues?

A month off and I know people who are going to lose there apartments and have no food, some are Trump supporters who vote and when they lose their shit will vote Biden, thanks to the Turtle, the pain he is inflicting will actually help Biden and hurt Trump
Biden didn‚Äôt pick her just like Obama was groomed &amp; released so was she!
This is absurd and offensive.  You are actively shaming people into not using their God given agency to express opinions and critique a presidential ticket.  Are parents upset about the Biden/Harris K12 agenda "doing the work of Trump" if they say so out loud?  Good grief.
You can mock their attacks without defending Biden &amp; Harris.
In general I‚Äôm not a Sarah Palin fan. However given the right wing media‚Äôs recent attempt to eviscerate Biden/Harris, I have to say this is a very classy response. Kudos to Sarah!!
Text TRUMP to 88022! I stand with
If you seriously are voting for joe Biden with the things he has said about black people. And his incoherent statements. I question your own intelligence and ability to think independently. I was going to vote blue. But it‚Äôs embarrassing
I can hear it now in the debate with Biden and Trump.  Trump is going to keep repeating the question "Where's Hunter"
You do understand that Harris is as poor a choice strategically as Biden is, right?
What's especially weird about the argument is that it's almost always used against politicians who are examples of what we're trying to change from. Biden isn't a sign that the Left has changed: he's a reminder that he need to keep up the fight.
Biden and Harris are an awful pick, but Trump and Pence are much worse.
Yes!!  Please!!!  I wish them well!!
Yes First Lady Biden!!  Let's do this people!!
Twenty Things You Probably Didn‚Äôt Know about Kamala Harris  With Biden promising to end single family zoning and Harris having backed forced busing in the primary this ticket is a declaration of war on the suburbs. #Battlefortheburbs.

Well you got your wish.  Biden picked her!!
Is there Trump campaign rally/shit show on today?? Wouldn't be great if Biden announced his pick for VP during it!
Why is Biden announcing now and not waiting for the virtual conversation?  What‚Äôs the upside of doing this?
I have a Majic 8 Ball that is more predictable than what is being said in the news about Biden‚Äôs Choice, but enough already make the choice and announce it, stop dragging it on, it‚Äôs actually starting to aggravate me

Everyone who has a brain, knows that Biden picked Kamala to kill the BLM movement. Cuz now all the boomers in the movement will slink away and vote for a segregationist and a prison labor profiteer. ü§° country
Yep Biden picked Kamala to crush the BLM movement. Expect to see a lot more "leftists" like  and other boomers heading the movement to buckle and fall in line like good little ü§°
actually this works and makes me like biden slightly more.
via  via   complaining that Kamala Harris doesn‚Äôt make him cryüò≥. When will men stop wanting women to act in a way that makes men feel good? It‚Äôs exhausting.
Honestly I don't even care what Biden thinks at this point, Harris is the presumptive president, she is the one who's policies and choices actually matter to me.
That you would likely serve in a Biden admin is one reason I would never vote for Biden.  And this is one of many reasons I'm proudly voting for Howie Hawkins:    #HawkinsWalker2020
1. Obama and Biden didn't spy on anyone.   2. Carter Page is not Trump.   3. Trump's Campaign had over ONE HUNDRED illegal contacts with Russians and LIED about ALL OF THEM when approached by the FBI.  4. There was VALID RUSSIAN INTERFERENCE in our election.
Yea this is the most perplexing thing when I hear people promoting biden

Unexpected choices, I‚Äôd say, for the lead in to Joe Biden on Thurs night.
I think our only hopes in this respect are: 1. Mail-in balloting is effectively prevented but Biden wins anyway or 2.  Mail-in balloting is common but Trump wins anyway.  It will be the way the vote is conducted, not the size of the margin.

It‚Äôs weird how important it is to some of you that I make it clear that, yes, Obama didn‚Äôt slaughter as many innocent civilians as Trump is. BUT HE STILL SLAUGHTERED INNOCENT CIVILIANS! So will Biden! Vote for the lesser evil, sure, but stop pretending lesser evil = not evil.

Mr. President, the media is in the tank for Mr. Biden!
Okay so if ANY of my followers support Trump, unfollow me now. After what he has done these last 4 years, I don‚Äôt understand how anyone can support him. As a person of the lgbtq+ community a vote for Trump or ANY OTHER candidate other than Biden is a vote against me personally.
No no no no the city girls support Biden and Harris... this is it
im still amazed that settle for biden is a legitimate organization
That‚Äôs what I take away from this pick.  And of course the super left views.   Not gonna change any votes for Biden.
Where would foreign policy be right now if Clinton were President? Would some form of the TPP have been enacted, giving U.S. based multinational corporations even more power? Did Trump simply delay what a Biden administration will carry out in the next 4-8 years?
"Mr. Biden had been emphatic that the process should unfold in a dignified manner that would leave all the participants better off." Joe is everything that tRump is not. #BidenHarrisLandslide2020

ICE will start disappearing any Latino person they see, and soon they'll be used to help round up "Antifa" plotters (aka anyone they want).  Biden, Harris, Sanders, AOC, many others will be imprisoned.  Trump will hold victory rallies, his hordes will cheer the violence.
Their desperation has turned the flu season into the end of the world. People will start believing that if Biden is elected the main stream media will start reporting on it as just the flu and the anxiety, hysteria and fear will dissipate.  Join my army or die.
The black vote for Democrats is not a given. Which is the point I'm trying to make, which you skipped right over and went to 99%. Biden has already made it clear that he thinks we're stupid, Kamala has already made it clear she'll play any card for votes. She tried to come off as
PLZZZZZZZZ do what you need to do Biden doesn‚Äôt win....I‚Äôm not the biggest fan of the fact that a lot of your supporters are racists BUT if iden wins we are all FUCKED
To maintain credibility with the press and Rhode Islanders, shouldn't Governor Raimondo have been honest 2 weeks ago &amp; said simply - yes, being vetted by the Biden campaign &amp; that's good for RI.
Four corners offense and prevent defense have their own risks.  Hillary spent Aug 2016 in the Hamptons. Biden seems to be blowing his lead.
The Q: was any part of latest rumor true, which encompassed: was she interviewed by Biden and/or his team? Did she fly out of state for the interview on specific date last week? "No." Amended Friday to: "I know she has not left the state. I don‚Äôt have any information beyond that"
Funny, I always say that Biden is racist and that I can't find any difference between him and Trump. Your powers of deduction are lacking as well as your comprehension and overall cognitive abilities to begin with. And you try to speak for blacks constantly. Do you know any?
. outperformance in the veepstakes raises the odds she'll be a serious contender for a position in the cabinet should Biden win
As recently as last week, we asked again if any part of rumor that  had been interviewed by Biden or his team was true.  The answer from her spox was: ‚Äúno.‚Äù Only AFTER ‚Å¶ piece did same spox clarify: she did not go out of state.
Well seeing how it's a video of only Joe Biden speaking unedited, you're right don't watch if you're offended by liars
Biden himself might be a little cringeworthy.  Harris tho? She'll go the 12 rounds, and then some.  Honestly, the ticket should be flipped.
Why isn‚Äôt she speaking at the convention? The  has abandoned the whole ‚ÄúBiden is the bridge to the future‚Äù before his nomination.
What are you going to do on the chance that Trump is re-elected? There's always a possibility since he wasn't "supposed" to be elected this past election cycle. What if Biden losses and you get Trump for 4 more years? Then what?
How long can Harris-Biden not have to deal w/ the pesky press for? Hmmm.... We could ask Obama.
Polling Tip: Be Accurate in your Qs. Try asking "Are you going to vote for Harris - Biden?" Maybe you'll get the 'blowout' you were looking for.

Yes am all in on Sen. Harris because she is qualified  and of the many women Biden considered she is the only one I could imagine as President of in 4 years or 8.  She makes me feel optimistic.  It is a fleeting thought but she is the only one that prompts. All in for B/H
They have asked for those funds... 2 months ago when they passed the HEROS BILL YOU MORON! YOU ARE THE PROBLEM NOT THE SOLUTION.... BIDEN AND HARRIS ARE GOING TO STEP UP AND SHUT YOU DOWN... VOTE BLUE!

4 years of Biden doing absolutely nothing to slow or reverse the continuing rightward slide of America followed by an even more dimwitted populist ideologue, rinse, repeat, until we have moved so far right that Reagan and Thatcher's graves can be pissed on simultaneously
lol at these lunatics acting like Joe Biden is anything other than the most boring uninspiring centrist.
right now reporting on Trump pushing Barr to be the best AG ever if he does his bidding with Sen Johnson‚Äôs disinformation about Biden. Can you imagine that they are normalizing this? Done with them, the media really needs to step it up or we will end up like Belarus.
I would argue that genocidal dictators are not actually leftists because authoritarianism is a fascist ideology. That being said, for context, the person writing that tweet above was comparing being rude to a Biden canvasser to being an asshole in the alt-right lol

Biden should have paid another kid to repeat it for him.
One of my neighbors has a LGBTQ+ flag sandwiched by two Biden flags. Seeing less and less political signs, too obvious that it's a waste of resources and just adding to the trash heap.
I hope the answer is obvious.  You may not like Joe Biden.  But he won‚Äôt destroy this country.  It really is that simple.  A vote for Biden is a vote to save America.
Had anyone in the administration had it.. It could have saved America.     We'll just wait for Biden and Harris.   I read a new hashtag today.. #cousinfucker.
what are you even talking about?  I'm voting to get a fascist out of office before American democracy is extinguished.  the end.  this is an existential crisis for our country, and you're babbling about brunch.  so, yes, some of us didn't want Biden, but we're adults about it.

Now that Wokeness has become profitable, they can ride economy surge under Trump while blaming him for the misogyny and bigotry of the Americans voting for Kamala who will likely step in for Biden. More of the same if she gets in. For the record, I'm not a Trumper by any measure
says the guy who won't cast a meaningful vote against Trump.  listen to yourself!  it's on Biden if you choose to vote for Mickey Mouse?
The kind gentle questioning of Harris and Biden, compare that to the Trump scrum that he does on a daily basis? Notice not screaming??
can you try for a minute looking at the situation a different way?    your vote belongs to no one but you.    but there is one candidate who is a significant danger to all of us, especially those already in need.  a vote for anyone but Biden does not help get rid of Trump.
I know...You're not gonna let Joe Biden cut America's meat!
"Biden voters mostly say they plan to cast their vote by mail, 62% to 36%.  Trump supporters, though, plan to physically go to the polls ‚Äî 72% to 24%."  Any surprise why Republicans want to kill USPS in a pandemic?   Fucking cowards.

Or I guess the correct thing to say would be from pat the berner "If sharing Biden &amp; Kamala's records helps Trump, then Biden &amp; Kamala's records help Trump."
lol Biden has done nothing in his 40 plus years... he won‚Äôt start now if he wins!
I'll stop now, but the idea that labor is "meh" on Biden is absurd.  You don't speak for the labor movement, it speaks for itself and enthusiastically endorses Joe Biden.
labor does support biden.  he has endorsements from the AFL‚ÄìCIO, Amalgamated Transit Union, American Federation of Government Employees, American Federation of Musicians, American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees, American Federation of Teachers  /1
I called it, hard to believe I was right. Only person we've seen try to lose this hard in our country was Trump 2016. Biden's not in this to win it, I'm pretty sure he's hoping this final spit on POC will get him safely back in his basement the next four years
I'm saying don't try to make *me* or *all democrats* responsible for some guy blocking you.  that's his decision, not mine, not Biden's, and not the Democratic party's.

My favorite thing about the Biden/Harris ticket is Ruth Bader Ginsburg.
Why he said it would take months, if ever, to count votes!  He is DETERMINED not to leave the Whitehouse. We need a landslide for BIDEN!   VOTE!  ENOUGH votes WILL be counted to WIN! DON'T STAY HOME!
is selling Biden masks for $20.00 each.... no wonder he wants them to be mandatory. üò∑
He's going to ask moderate Republicans and Republican leaning ind to vote for biden instead a 3rd party or staying home. Good enough for me. I also believe aoc should be given just as much if not more time as kasich
Yes. He was talking to Charlamagne Tha God.
He's not the impeached, treasonous, utter moron who's squatting in the White House right now.  In reality, Mr. Biden has a laundry list of qualifications for this job, but at the end of the day he's the anti-Trump, and THAT is what is going to win him this election.
The world has been laughing, excluding, and moving on without the US with Treasonous Trump, the impeached idiot, squatting in the White House.   President Biden will restore dignity and respect to the US, and to his office.
you can't assume the "leading candidate" would otherwise get the votes the "spoiler" candidate gets. I for one would never vote for an imperialist hawk like Biden. you're wasting time berating people for their convictions that you don't even seem interested in understanding.
naomi lachance was texted by a Biden volunteer who said they were 12 when asked, and at 9am the next morning texted the kid "baby did i say something wrong" which is the most grooming-ass creepy shit to pull on a 12 year old, after asking them to explain rape the night before.
lmao they de-checkmarked the "journalist" who was creeping on the 12 year old Biden text volunteer
about I still worrisome for a POC such as myself and given his history you please tell me why, being a POC, I should vote for him when he views us as unintelligent, inferior and just a means to get votes? Do you read the articles I post detailing this?
Tia please give it up. You I have no problem with me not voting for Trump but my reasoning for voting for Biden is that he is racist, has voted against minority interest for years including seeking out segregationist to work with him against busing. Those little gaffes you speak
WATCH: Here's what  told  two weeks ago about being vetted by the Biden campaign.
I tried to give these people the benefit of the doubt but I gave up on that months ago. I had a few people cussing me out because I don't want to vote for Biden. It's okay that I'm not voting for Trump but I'm a selfish egotistical person for not voting for Biden even though I've
Would it be best if those of us willing to vote for Biden stay out of this? I don't mean fail to strike--I'm asking if the voices leading this need to be a subset (people like you) or a coalition (people like me, center-right people like most of the Dem party, etc.)?
Electing them at all is the opposite of holding them accountable. Biden opposes busing and writes the crime bill and his reward is he gets to be president? Kamala uses her power to keep prisoners because they‚Äôre valuable labor and she gets to be VP?

If they were an adult then I legitimately don‚Äôt see what would be inappropriate about responding the way she did. If I was a victim of sexual assault I‚Äôd be pretty snappy too if someone tried to get me to make calls for Joe Biden.
Between Biden and Harris - will raise taxes, police are like the KKK, cops are the enemy, take away guns, open boarders and BOTH said Trumps economic policies would cripple America
I agree it‚Äôs their fault! I‚Äôm not trying to trap you into saying anything, as someone who wants trump out so badly that I‚Äôd settle for Biden even though I don‚Äôt agree with him on alot, and as a fellow progressive, I‚Äôm curious to understand your point of view.
According to the   had a "standout" interview with Biden's search team and left the team "dazzled."
It‚Äôs not bad faith! Like I supported Warren but when she dropped out,I supported Bernie bc he champions many of the same progressive causes that are important to me. I didn‚Äôt want Biden or any moderate, and I‚Äôm not thrilled about it but I sure as hell will vote for him over trump
Ok yay! I think you answered my question. Bernie is the only candidate you would support. It‚Äôs not just Biden, you wouldn‚Äôt have voted for anyone but Bernie, regardless of how closely policy aligns. Thank you!
'Antifa' website cited in conservative media attack on Biden is linked to ‚Äî wait for it ‚Äî Russia
Let‚Äôs recap the desperate lies we‚Äôve heard from Trump/Pence so far. They‚Äôve claimed a Biden/Harris administration will mean: ‚ÄîNo more cows ‚ÄîNo more meat ‚ÄîNo more hamburgers ‚ÄîNo more 2nd Amendment ‚ÄîNo more guns ‚ÄîTrillions in taxes on the middle class
Biden is racist Harris is fake the two of them are puppets of Pelosi I‚Äôm voting red in November
You mean the mfg jobs that Obama said were never coming back?  The ones that we lost due to NAFTA. Which Biden promoted
Great read. The final four in serious contention for the job were Harris, Rice, Warren and Whitmer.
It's either Carte Goodwin or Joe Biden, and I think it might be the latter.
If I had to show people two clips to sum up the 2020 primary, it would be this (ending the Bloomberg run), and the always awesome clip of  meeting Joe Biden in the NYT elevator.
Is that how you going to answer Biden during the debates ?  " Ahhhh...".   Lol
I'm not going to vote for the lesser of 2 racists. If you can tell me what Biden is going to do for minorities that's going to improve things, let me know. Biden has voted AGAINST minority interest his whole career. WHY should I trust him NOW? Obviously YOU have LESS to lose.
This does of course depend entirely on Biden diverging from the Obama Doctrine of "looking forward not backward"   i.e. overlooking the crimes of powerful people because they happened in the past, while overseeing the world's largest ever prison state for nonviolent offenders.
I guess at least if Biden is president he probably won't attempt to block  from delivering ballots in an effort to steal an election
Okay, since I dislike both Trump and Biden but I hate Biden's aw shucks form of racism more, you just talked me into voting for Trump. Since I can't have an opinion unless I vote. Nice job!
And the sad thing is that you would hesitate to vote for Biden.
How Biden Chose Harris: A Search That Forged New Stars, Friends and Rivalries
Well you seem very confident about November. I am considerably less so. Biden has to make it through 3 debates.

How Biden Chose Harris: A Search That Forged New Stars, Friends and Rivalries
. reports  aced her interview to be the VP pick - but Biden team worried about ‚Äúher limited national profile and adversarial relationship with influential labor unions‚Äù
But Biden said today that "Trump Coddled Terrorist" lol.
Some of these are certainly compelling arguments but I‚Äôm not fully convinced on all the points. Regardless this is a far more convincing argument than ‚Äúget over it‚Äù or ‚Äúanything other than a vote Biden is a vote for Trump‚Äù.
Then why are you demanding loyalty and a vote rather than fighting for better policies. Biden‚Äôs still hasn‚Äôt been named as the nominee till the convention. Why would you stop making demands? Especially now? It‚Äôs a pandemic depression. Millions are losing their healthcare
I‚Äôm not voting for trump. I hear that‚Äôs a vote for Biden
Biden and Harris are fascists too bro
Mozilla is like Biden for me. I‚Äôm not always crazy about it/him, but in comparison to the alternative it‚Äôs no contest and I must support 100%
I get that entirely and I usually agree. Let's talk about the Presidential race, though. America needs Trump to lose. Trump is fascist, Biden isn't. I mean, at this level, that's all that matters to me right now. I should have worded the original tweet better.
He's too busy doing Putin's bidding to smear Biden to undertake necessary work.
Biden/CNN and Trump/FOX NEWS. What else is new.
Extremely fucked up that Joe Biden has plagiarized all of his speeches from Molloy. We should‚Äôve known after his 15 minute bit at the Iowa State Fair about sucking on pebbles.
I‚Äôm garbage because?... I said yelling at people and name calling doesn‚Äôt recruit voters. Ok.   How many calls have you made phone banking for Biden today?
Guys some people are constantly bullying me over Biden choice they say I am progressive deep state agent
I'm getting a kick out of everyone that lambasted Ted Cruz for backing Trump after he got eviscerated by him during the debates only to go "YAAAASSS" at Biden picking the woman who called him a racist and said she believed the women that accused him of misconduct.
Not when Joe Biden is president The world is already laughing at us because of you because of your ignorance and stupidity world leaders laughing at us you‚Äôre worried about UAE  we have lines of Americans trying to get a box of food you are the worst president ever

Another way that the DEMS can try to cast the   ticket as one that reflects 21st century America.  Going forwards, not backwards. Biden's age may get in the way of that messaging, but this is why Harris' background helps.  #Election2020
Honestly, if I am the Biden campaign, I am putting Kamala on television every day. Trump will lose his mind. (If there's anymore of it left to go.)
By the way, have you ever wondered why Kamala Harris is good enough to be for VP but NOT president? How come 2nd best? There was so much diversity in the Democrat candidate pool, young, gay, Asian, female, whatever Liz Warren was that day. How'd you get old, white, racist Biden?
BIDEN IS A CLINTON CARTEL CRIMINAL. ALL DEMORATS ALWAYS ABOVE ALL USA LAW'S.
Maybe Biden should get behind the People.
The world is currently laughing at Trump because of his botched handling of COVID-19 amongst other things including his fanning the flames of racial tensions. A Biden and Harris will restore honor and respectability to the U.S. #BidenandHarris2020
To anyone who may have purchased a baseball cap from the Biden online store, how is the fit?
Yeah, Right.  I mean Obama/Biden brokered a peace agreement with them too...  Oh no, that's right, they destabilized Libya &amp; Syria instead, causing 600,000-1,000,000 dead.
I‚Äôm quite jealous of the folks excited for the Biden/Harris ticket. Like wouldn‚Äôt that be nice?
Biden ought to make this an issue, particularly with seniors and veterans. This president is taking away your mail delivery because he's afraid he might lose an election. Seriously.
Add THIS to bribing the Ukraine to go after Biden with false charges.

She's a rockstar. So proud.
Talking and doing are 2 different things!  Agian, no proof just people saying this or saying that. Just because it‚Äôs said does not make it true! So again, where‚Äôs the proof!! Biden‚Äôs been accused by multiple women I guess nit about there either! Hypocrisy!
Nobody is sweating like Judgey Jeanine today after her death "premonition" about Joe Biden last night. She'll be getting a visit from the FBI. Perhaps another suspension from Fox Spews.
Its funny bc I read the investment strat reports on Biden‚Äôs admin and its like nobody bothers to read the policies he has up on his website. Its pretty amazing
Jill Biden should be charged with elderly abuse for allowing this to happen.
If Trump wins, then it‚Äôs four years of the liberal blame game.   If Biden wins, I can guarantee it‚Äôs four years of liberal complacency.
But that means not voting for Trump IS a vote for Biden. Man what a paradox...
Only 82 days left for the ‚Äúif you don‚Äôt vote/if you don‚Äôt vote Biden, you‚Äôre voting for trump‚Äù folks
and he is the same person he was 50 years ago. Yet Biden can change even though he said many racist things the last year &amp; his 40 years in politics has not been stellar when it comes to minorities or women if you throw Anita Hill into the mix. How is he different? He's NOT.
Yup. If it‚Äôs close he‚Äôs gonna demand six recounts, if Biden thwomps him, he‚Äôs gonna cry fraud.
Why is it all of the things they accuse Trump of they are willing to accept when it comes to Biden. I had one tell me 1977 and the busing issue would Biden was before he was born, happened in the past and people can change. But all I heard the last 3 years how Trump is racist
160,000 dead Americans didn‚Äôt change Trump‚Äôs popularity. Remember that as you read coverage about the election and whether Biden‚Äôs message is working or whatever armchair campaign quarterbacking narrative gets a lot of play. Most votes are just not up for grabs.
The point I'm trying to make is how phony the left is in regard to diversity &amp; tolerance when they could have had a more divers candidate yet shows Biden. Harris's is to shut everyone up &amp; to pander to certain groups. I doubt it was Biden's ACTUAL choice given his racist history.
A reminder of Trump's vast accomplishments:     A reminder of Biden accomplishments: üîé üòï
I believe this is overthinking it. Cooking and family are often part of her public persona. But calculation is part of every politician's public speech, male or female. Biden talks about family all the time - genuine or calculated? On the other hand, Trump never does.
Good Morning to the 93% of black people who aren‚Äôt categorically unintelligent and are voting for Biden in November.  I love you all, so deeply, with all of my mind and spirit.
How come Kamala Harris is good enough to run for vice president for but NOT for president? Why is Joe Biden a BETTER choice for president than she is given she is female AND biracial to boot? Why is the diversity you lefties CLAIM to embrace only good enough for SECOND BEST?ü§î
Pelosi Schumer Schiff Nadler Biden probably hold the world record for the longest time on public assistance. The have been living high on the hog at the taxpayers expense for far too long. It‚Äôs time we found genuine people that love America to represent us.
No he launched his career working with segregationists against busing so his children wouldn't have to grow up in a racial jungle.üòè
How? I've already shown you how he's racist. Why is it you have an issue with Trump because he's racist according to you &amp; you are supposed to be so woke intolerant &amp; non-racist but you can accept racism from Biden? Racism is racism. No such thing as being just a "little" racist.
I‚Äôm sorry.. but these Bernie die hards shitting on Biden are gonna make me blow a fucking gasket. Do you understand what is at stake here?! Put away your ego and do the right thing. ü§¨
Am. Electoral politics has rarely been the place of radical change. That lives elsewhere in Am. political life. But what I think we get in a Biden-Harris is a team that is closer to the deepest concerns of the vast maj. of Americans. And that is something important!!
46 days ago,  nearly choked up on the debate stage, attacking  for his racist policies ‚Äî noting the personal impact they had on her childhood.  But the door to power swung open, and Biden‚Äôs racist actions were thrown out the window...  WAKE UP AMERICA‚ÄºÔ∏è
While President Biden may decide on a pardon, Cyrus Vance is not bound by it.  A NY state prison might become Trump‚Äôs new home.  With the benefit of years, I think Ford was right to pardon Nixon.  Not as simple this time.
You are petrified at Biden debating Trump.  You have every reason to be.  Trump is clearly sharp and on the ball.  People need to see for themselves just how unqualified Biden is.  Bring on the debates. #Trump2020Victory

Everyone who has a brain, knows that Biden picked Kamala to kill the BLM movement. Cuz now all the boomers in the movement will slink away and vote for a segregationist and a prison labor profiteer. ü§° country
Yep Biden picked Kamala to crush the BLM movement. Expect to see a lot more "leftists" like  and other boomers heading the movement to buckle and fall in line like good little ü§°
actually this works and makes me like biden slightly more.
via  via   complaining that Kamala Harris doesn‚Äôt make him cryüò≥. When will men stop wanting women to act in a way that makes men feel good? It‚Äôs exhausting.
Honestly I don't even care what Biden thinks at this point, Harris is the presumptive president, she is the one who's policies and choices actually matter to me.
That you would likely serve in a Biden admin is one reason I would never vote for Biden.  And this is one of many reasons I'm proudly voting for Howie Hawkins:    #HawkinsWalker2020
1. Obama and Biden didn't spy on anyone.   2. Carter Page is not Trump.   3. Trump's Campaign had over ONE HUNDRED illegal contacts with Russians and LIED about ALL OF THEM when approached by the FBI.  4. There was VALID RUSSIAN INTERFERENCE in our election.
Yea this is the most perplexing thing when I hear people promoting biden

That‚Äôs what I take away from this pick.  And of course the super left views.   Not gonna change any votes for Biden.
Where would foreign policy be right now if Clinton were President? Would some form of the TPP have been enacted, giving U.S. based multinational corporations even more power? Did Trump simply delay what a Biden administration will carry out in the next 4-8 years?
"Mr. Biden had been emphatic that the process should unfold in a dignified manner that would leave all the participants better off." Joe is everything that tRump is not. #BidenHarrisLandslide2020

ICE will start disappearing any Latino person they see, and soon they'll be used to help round up "Antifa" plotters (aka anyone they want).  Biden, Harris, Sanders, AOC, many others will be imprisoned.  Trump will hold victory rallies, his hordes will cheer the violence.
What's going on Donnie is that it's impossible and unnecessary to dispute Biden's truthful statements while your lies invite challenge.
The black vote for Democrats is not a given. Which is the point I'm trying to make, which you skipped right over and went to 99%. Biden has already made it clear that he thinks we're stupid, Kamala has already made it clear she'll play any card for votes. She tried to come off as

To maintain credibility with the press and Rhode Islanders, shouldn't Governor Raimondo have been honest 2 weeks ago &amp; said simply - yes, being vetted by the Biden campaign &amp; that's good for RI.
Four corners offense and prevent defense have their own risks.  Hillary spent Aug 2016 in the Hamptons. Biden seems to be blowing his lead.
The Q: was any part of latest rumor true, which encompassed: was she interviewed by Biden and/or his team? Did she fly out of state for the interview on specific date last week? "No." Amended Friday to: "I know she has not left the state. I don‚Äôt have any information beyond that"
Funny, I always say that Biden is racist and that I can't find any difference between him and Trump. Your powers of deduction are lacking as well as your comprehension and overall cognitive abilities to begin with. And you try to speak for blacks constantly. Do you know any?
. outperformance in the veepstakes raises the odds she'll be a serious contender for a position in the cabinet should Biden win
As recently as last week, we asked again if any part of rumor that  had been interviewed by Biden or his team was true.  The answer from her spox was: ‚Äúno.‚Äù Only AFTER ‚Å¶ piece did same spox clarify: she did not go out of state.
Well seeing how it's a video of only Joe Biden speaking unedited, you're right don't watch if you're offended by liars
Biden himself might be a little cringeworthy.  Harris tho? She'll go the 12 rounds, and then some.  Honestly, the ticket should be flipped.
Why isn‚Äôt she speaking at the convention? The  has abandoned the whole ‚ÄúBiden is the bridge to the future‚Äù before his nomination.
What are you going to do on the chance that Trump is re-elected? There's always a possibility since he wasn't "supposed" to be elected this past election cycle. What if Biden losses and you get Trump for 4 more years? Then what?
Shows the priorities of the Dems. He rails on Joe Biden for clear corruption, blackmailing Ukraine millions to fire the prosecutor who was investigating his son. They lose their minds, call for impeachment, go into Russiagate hysterics.

4 years of Biden doing absolutely nothing to slow or reverse the continuing rightward slide of America followed by an even more dimwitted populist ideologue, rinse, repeat, until we have moved so far right that Reagan and Thatcher's graves can be pissed on simultaneously
lol at these lunatics acting like Joe Biden is anything other than the most boring uninspiring centrist.
right now reporting on Trump pushing Barr to be the best AG ever if he does his bidding with Sen Johnson‚Äôs disinformation about Biden. Can you imagine that they are normalizing this? Done with them, the media really needs to step it up or we will end up like Belarus.
WTF thousands and thousands of countries,there is only 195 countries in the world. And Trump has the audacity to say Joe Biden is slow in his fake ads. lol
I would argue that genocidal dictators are not actually leftists because authoritarianism is a fascist ideology. That being said, for context, the person writing that tweet above was comparing being rude to a Biden canvasser to being an asshole in the alt-right lol
Biden should have paid another kid to repeat it for him.
One of my neighbors has a LGBTQ+ flag sandwiched by two Biden flags. Seeing less and less political signs, too obvious that it's a waste of resources and just adding to the trash heap.
I hope the answer is obvious.  You may not like Joe Biden.  But he won‚Äôt destroy this country.  It really is that simple.  A vote for Biden is a vote to save America.
Had anyone in the administration had it.. It could have saved America.     We'll just wait for Biden and Harris.   I read a new hashtag today.. #cousinfucker.
what are you even talking about?  I'm voting to get a fascist out of office before American democracy is extinguished.  the end.  this is an existential crisis for our country, and you're babbling about brunch.  so, yes, some of us didn't want Biden, but we're adults about it.
Biden‚Äôs been in office 50 years how is that new leadership
you can't just waive at multiple people and say "they're all the same, all bad" and then when someone points out the very idea of degrees, say it's ridiculous.  on every issue you care about, Biden is better than Trump, but "they're all the same, all bad"

Now that Wokeness has become profitable, they can ride economy surge under Trump while blaming him for the misogyny and bigotry of the Americans voting for Kamala who will likely step in for Biden. More of the same if she gets in. For the record, I'm not a Trumper by any measure
says the guy who won't cast a meaningful vote against Trump.  listen to yourself!  it's on Biden if you choose to vote for Mickey Mouse?
The kind gentle questioning of Harris and Biden, compare that to the Trump scrum that he does on a daily basis? Notice not screaming??
can you try for a minute looking at the situation a different way?    your vote belongs to no one but you.    but there is one candidate who is a significant danger to all of us, especially those already in need.  a vote for anyone but Biden does not help get rid of Trump.
I know...You're not gonna let Joe Biden cut America's meat!
"Biden voters mostly say they plan to cast their vote by mail, 62% to 36%.  Trump supporters, though, plan to physically go to the polls ‚Äî 72% to 24%."  Any surprise why Republicans want to kill USPS in a pandemic?   Fucking cowards.

Don Pesci: The old, tired and reclusive Joe Biden
Gov. Raimondo impressed Joe Biden's team when interviewing for VP pick but had some drawbacks, per
another great example of the differences between R and D votes.  do you think Biden/Harris are going to dismantle the post office?
Or I guess the correct thing to say would be from pat the berner "If sharing Biden &amp; Kamala's records helps Trump, then Biden &amp; Kamala's records help Trump."
lol Biden has done nothing in his 40 plus years... he won‚Äôt start now if he wins!
I'll stop now, but the idea that labor is "meh" on Biden is absurd.  You don't speak for the labor movement, it speaks for itself and enthusiastically endorses Joe Biden.
labor does support biden.  he has endorsements from the AFL‚ÄìCIO, Amalgamated Transit Union, American Federation of Government Employees, American Federation of Musicians, American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees, American Federation of Teachers  /1
I called it, hard to believe I was right. Only person we've seen try to lose this hard in our country was Trump 2016. Biden's not in this to win it, I'm pretty sure he's hoping this final spit on POC will get him safely back in his basement the next four years
I'm saying don't try to make *me* or *all democrats* responsible for some guy blocking you.  that's his decision, not mine, not Biden's, and not the Democratic party's.

He's going to ask moderate Republicans and Republican leaning ind to vote for biden instead a 3rd party or staying home. Good enough for me. I also believe aoc should be given just as much if not more time as kasich
Yes. He was talking to Charlamagne Tha God.
He's not the impeached, treasonous, utter moron who's squatting in the White House right now.  In reality, Mr. Biden has a laundry list of qualifications for this job, but at the end of the day he's the anti-Trump, and THAT is what is going to win him this election.
The world has been laughing, excluding, and moving on without the US with Treasonous Trump, the impeached idiot, squatting in the White House.   President Biden will restore dignity and respect to the US, and to his office.
you can't assume the "leading candidate" would otherwise get the votes the "spoiler" candidate gets. I for one would never vote for an imperialist hawk like Biden. you're wasting time berating people for their convictions that you don't even seem interested in understanding.
naomi lachance was texted by a Biden volunteer who said they were 12 when asked, and at 9am the next morning texted the kid "baby did i say something wrong" which is the most grooming-ass creepy shit to pull on a 12 year old, after asking them to explain rape the night before.
lmao they de-checkmarked the "journalist" who was creeping on the 12 year old Biden text volunteer
about I still worrisome for a POC such as myself and given his history you please tell me why, being a POC, I should vote for him when he views us as unintelligent, inferior and just a means to get votes? Do you read the articles I post detailing this?
Tia please give it up. You I have no problem with me not voting for Trump but my reasoning for voting for Biden is that he is racist, has voted against minority interest for years including seeking out segregationist to work with him against busing. Those little gaffes you speak
WATCH: Here's what  told  two weeks ago about being vetted by the Biden campaign.
I tried to give these people the benefit of the doubt but I gave up on that months ago. I had a few people cussing me out because I don't want to vote for Biden. It's okay that I'm not voting for Trump but I'm a selfish egotistical person for not voting for Biden even though I've
Electing them at all is the opposite of holding them accountable. Biden opposes busing and writes the crime bill and his reward is he gets to be president? Kamala uses her power to keep prisoners because they‚Äôre valuable labor and she gets to be VP?

If they were an adult then I legitimately don‚Äôt see what would be inappropriate about responding the way she did. If I was a victim of sexual assault I‚Äôd be pretty snappy too if someone tried to get me to make calls for Joe Biden.
I agree it‚Äôs their fault! I‚Äôm not trying to trap you into saying anything, as someone who wants trump out so badly that I‚Äôd settle for Biden even though I don‚Äôt agree with him on alot, and as a fellow progressive, I‚Äôm curious to understand your point of view.
According to the   had a "standout" interview with Biden's search team and left the team "dazzled."
It‚Äôs not bad faith! Like I supported Warren but when she dropped out,I supported Bernie bc he champions many of the same progressive causes that are important to me. I didn‚Äôt want Biden or any moderate, and I‚Äôm not thrilled about it but I sure as hell will vote for him over trump
Ok yay! I think you answered my question. Bernie is the only candidate you would support. It‚Äôs not just Biden, you wouldn‚Äôt have voted for anyone but Bernie, regardless of how closely policy aligns. Thank you!

You mean the mfg jobs that Obama said were never coming back?  The ones that we lost due to NAFTA. Which Biden promoted
Someone needs to put out a challenge to post any Biden flags if they see them.
Great read. The final four in serious contention for the job were Harris, Rice, Warren and Whitmer.
It's either Carte Goodwin or Joe Biden, and I think it might be the latter.
If I had to show people two clips to sum up the 2020 primary, it would be this (ending the Bloomberg run), and the always awesome clip of  meeting Joe Biden in the NYT elevator.
Is that how you going to answer Biden during the debates ?  " Ahhhh...".   Lol
I'm not going to vote for the lesser of 2 racists. If you can tell me what Biden is going to do for minorities that's going to improve things, let me know. Biden has voted AGAINST minority interest his whole career. WHY should I trust him NOW? Obviously YOU have LESS to lose.
This does of course depend entirely on Biden diverging from the Obama Doctrine of "looking forward not backward"   i.e. overlooking the crimes of powerful people because they happened in the past, while overseeing the world's largest ever prison state for nonviolent offenders.
I guess at least if Biden is president he probably won't attempt to block  from delivering ballots in an effort to steal an election
Okay, since I dislike both Trump and Biden but I hate Biden's aw shucks form of racism more, you just talked me into voting for Trump. Since I can't have an opinion unless I vote. Nice job!
And the sad thing is that you would hesitate to vote for Biden.

How Biden Chose Harris: A Search That Forged New Stars, Friends and Rivalries
. reports  aced her interview to be the VP pick - but Biden team worried about ‚Äúher limited national profile and adversarial relationship with influential labor unions‚Äù
Some of these are certainly compelling arguments but I‚Äôm not fully convinced on all the points. Regardless this is a far more convincing argument than ‚Äúget over it‚Äù or ‚Äúanything other than a vote Biden is a vote for Trump‚Äù.
Then why are you demanding loyalty and a vote rather than fighting for better policies. Biden‚Äôs still hasn‚Äôt been named as the nominee till the convention. Why would you stop making demands? Especially now? It‚Äôs a pandemic depression. Millions are losing their healthcare
I‚Äôm not voting for trump. I hear that‚Äôs a vote for Biden
Biden and Harris are fascists too bro
Mozilla is like Biden for me. I‚Äôm not always crazy about it/him, but in comparison to the alternative it‚Äôs no contest and I must support 100%

I get that entirely and I usually agree. Let's talk about the Presidential race, though. America needs Trump to lose. Trump is fascist, Biden isn't. I mean, at this level, that's all that matters to me right now. I should have worded the original tweet better.
Extremely fucked up that Joe Biden has plagiarized all of his speeches from Molloy. We should‚Äôve known after his 15 minute bit at the Iowa State Fair about sucking on pebbles.
I‚Äôm garbage because?... I said yelling at people and name calling doesn‚Äôt recruit voters. Ok.   How many calls have you made phone banking for Biden today?
All I hear all day long is how great Biden is at this or how wonderful Biden did that. Biden, Biden, Biden!
Guys some people are constantly bullying me over Biden choice they say I am progressive deep state agent
Another way that the DEMS can try to cast the   ticket as one that reflects 21st century America.  Going forwards, not backwards. Biden's age may get in the way of that messaging, but this is why Harris' background helps.  #Election2020
Honestly, if I am the Biden campaign, I am putting Kamala on television every day. Trump will lose his mind. (If there's anymore of it left to go.)
By the way, have you ever wondered why Kamala Harris is good enough to be for VP but NOT president? How come 2nd best? There was so much diversity in the Democrat candidate pool, young, gay, Asian, female, whatever Liz Warren was that day. How'd you get old, white, racist Biden?
The world is currently laughing at Trump because of his botched handling of COVID-19 amongst other things including his fanning the flames of racial tensions. A Biden and Harris will restore honor and respectability to the U.S. #BidenandHarris2020
To anyone who may have purchased a baseball cap from the Biden online store, how is the fit?

Add THIS to bribing the Ukraine to go after Biden with false charges.

She's a rockstar. So proud.
Talking and doing are 2 different things!  Agian, no proof just people saying this or saying that. Just because it‚Äôs said does not make it true! So again, where‚Äôs the proof!! Biden‚Äôs been accused by multiple women I guess nit about there either! Hypocrisy!
Nobody is sweating like Judgey Jeanine today after her death "premonition" about Joe Biden last night. She'll be getting a visit from the FBI. Perhaps another suspension from Fox Spews.
Its funny bc I read the investment strat reports on Biden‚Äôs admin and its like nobody bothers to read the policies he has up on his website. Its pretty amazing
But that means not voting for Trump IS a vote for Biden. Man what a paradox...
and he is the same person he was 50 years ago. Yet Biden can change even though he said many racist things the last year &amp; his 40 years in politics has not been stellar when it comes to minorities or women if you throw Anita Hill into the mix. How is he different? He's NOT.
Why is it all of the things they accuse Trump of they are willing to accept when it comes to Biden. I had one tell me 1977 and the busing issue would Biden was before he was born, happened in the past and people can change. But all I heard the last 3 years how Trump is racist
160,000 dead Americans didn‚Äôt change Trump‚Äôs popularity. Remember that as you read coverage about the election and whether Biden‚Äôs message is working or whatever armchair campaign quarterbacking narrative gets a lot of play. Most votes are just not up for grabs.
The point I'm trying to make is how phony the left is in regard to diversity &amp; tolerance when they could have had a more divers candidate yet shows Biden. Harris's is to shut everyone up &amp; to pander to certain groups. I doubt it was Biden's ACTUAL choice given his racist history.
A reminder of Trump's vast accomplishments:     A reminder of Biden accomplishments: üîé üòï
I believe this is overthinking it. Cooking and family are often part of her public persona. But calculation is part of every politician's public speech, male or female. Biden talks about family all the time - genuine or calculated? On the other hand, Trump never does.
Good Morning to the 93% of black people who aren‚Äôt categorically unintelligent and are voting for Biden in November.  I love you all, so deeply, with all of my mind and spirit.
How come Kamala Harris is good enough to run for vice president for but NOT for president? Why is Joe Biden a BETTER choice for president than she is given she is female AND biracial to boot? Why is the diversity you lefties CLAIM to embrace only good enough for SECOND BEST?ü§î
No he launched his career working with segregationists against busing so his children wouldn't have to grow up in a racial jungle.üòè
How? I've already shown you how he's racist. Why is it you have an issue with Trump because he's racist according to you &amp; you are supposed to be so woke intolerant &amp; non-racist but you can accept racism from Biden? Racism is racism. No such thing as being just a "little" racist.
I‚Äôm sorry.. but these Bernie die hards shitting on Biden are gonna make me blow a fucking gasket. Do you understand what is at stake here?! Put away your ego and do the right thing. ü§¨
Am. Electoral politics has rarely been the place of radical change. That lives elsewhere in Am. political life. But what I think we get in a Biden-Harris is a team that is closer to the deepest concerns of the vast maj. of Americans. And that is something important!!
While President Biden may decide on a pardon, Cyrus Vance is not bound by it.  A NY state prison might become Trump‚Äôs new home.  With the benefit of years, I think Ford was right to pardon Nixon.  Not as simple this time.
You are petrified at Biden debating Trump.  You have every reason to be.  Trump is clearly sharp and on the ball.  People need to see for themselves just how unqualified Biden is.  Bring on the debates. #Trump2020Victory

Forget political agendas. Last year she said she believed the women who accused Biden of inappropriate behavior. She did forget? Now it‚Äôs ok? That alone proves to me she is very untrustworthy
Lmao you can't call him bunker Biden. Bunker baby is already trump. Biden never hid in a bunker because of  protestors
Biden isn‚Äôt your savior. His sheep‚Äôs clothing is just more convincing
Biden realllly just wants to spend more time with his grandkids holding them underwater making th suck his toes or whatever weird shit he's into. He's trying to lose.
Fuck Joe Biden!!
I like how Biden supporters are straight up telling me that these days. That's what it means when you say "it's not as bad as it could have been"
#KamalaHarris was a bad choice for VP but a worse choice was #Biden for president is pretty much the vibe I'm getting
They got me with Bass because that suggestion came out of the left of the party. But Rice only makes sense if you think like a DC insider (imo): technocratic liberal with no domestic policy chops who will never overshadow Biden. In a way, it seems perfect for his low-key strat.
Rice made no sense to us in the electorate, but she made sense to people who think Biden only wants to replicate 2009-2017. And the GOP thinks Dems are arrogant enough to just ignore Benghazi (which while stupid was in fact a big-ish deal).
For the first time in history, I think a headfake worked. I am utterly convinced Rice was a fake-out designed to get the GOP ready to re-litigate Benghazi, and the media bought into the fake for precisely the amount of time Biden needed them to for it to penetrate GOP circles.
apparently each hateful idiot in America is going to require an immediate family member to go on a ventilator ... and then they‚Äôll potentially be open to denying this is a different way, perhaps something involving Biden or maybe child abduction.
I'm not one to defend pundits, but they may mean safe as far as ideology. She is far less radical than some of the other contenders. Like Biden, she is an establishment Democrat.
Funny how folks like you never said that about the even flimsier allegations The Intercept (and Intercept alone by the end) pushed about Biden.  How did Bernie Sanders, a good man, end up surrounding himself with the utter dregs of political organizing?
Biden is a racist twit. Read some of these articles and some of the things that he has said and done not only in the far past but recently and then you tell me in good faith how as a black woman I can honestly support him. You can have him if you're that naive and blind.
Fuck Joe Biden.
Biden is pro-life. He wears a mask.
When VP Harris said "open and... shut," Trump and Pence exhailed and buckled like they'd been kicked in the croch.  Biden/Harris 2020.
It's not about Kamala or Biden.ü§î It's about weeding out the people who are pretending to be on a certain agenda while literally on the other side. I would prefer facts rather than interpretations and whether any of her new work has progressed in a new direction.
Biden picks a San Francisco Dem loved by big tech.  And Cicilline wants to blow smoke?   And Nesi is rolling them apparently

Ambassador Rice makes a very cool point about people in Biden's camp: Fidelity. It is important They can be trusted.  This is an AWESOME clip.  Goes to respect for the candidate - and reflects the value of high quality people in management.  So cool....So Susan Rice.
If Joe Biden is inaugurated and the Senate flips I‚Äôll have the emotional bandwidth to contemplate the whole Virtual Youtuber thing. Until then I‚Äôm going for pure Patrick O‚ÄôBrian mode where I don‚Äôt know whether computers exist and only know about frigates, sloops, staysails etc
why did you give Joe Biden better music than you? Also Trains are socialism.
Susan Rice is truly just a class act right now on Maddow. Speaking glowingly about Kamala and the thoroughness of the vetting process. 100% in a Biden / Harris administration if they win. My guess would be Secretary of State.Yo the media played people saying Bernie was too old to be president lmaooo  Bernie is only a year older than Biden
Not that Biden also didn't get at least two of his mansions payed for by prison labor industry, SEEING THAT HE WROTE THE CRIME BILL, arresting more African Americans than there are prisoners in CHINA

Yep Biden picked Kamala to crush the BLM movement. Expect to see a lot more "leftists" like  and other boomers heading the movement to buckle and fall in line like good little ü§°
actually this works and makes me like biden slightly more.
via  via   complaining that Kamala Harris doesn‚Äôt make him cryüò≥. When will men stop wanting women to act in a way that makes men feel good? It‚Äôs exhausting.
Honestly I don't even care what Biden thinks at this point, Harris is the presumptive president, she is the one who's policies and choices actually matter to me.
That you would likely serve in a Biden admin is one reason I would never vote for Biden.  And this is one of many reasons I'm proudly voting for Howie Hawkins:    #HawkinsWalker2020

1. Obama and Biden didn't spy on anyone.   2. Carter Page is not Trump.   3. Trump's Campaign had over ONE HUNDRED illegal contacts with Russians and LIED about ALL OF THEM when approached by the FBI.  4. There was VALID RUSSIAN INTERFERENCE in our election.
Yea this is the most perplexing thing when I hear people promoting biden

Unexpected choices, I‚Äôd say, for the lead in to Joe Biden on Thurs night.
I think our only hopes in this respect are: 1. Mail-in balloting is effectively prevented but Biden wins anyway or 2.  Mail-in balloting is common but Trump wins anyway.  It will be the way the vote is conducted, not the size of the margin.
Imagine I listen to Trump. The logic goes then, that:  I believe that Dems believe the MSM.  MSM says Biden will win in a landslide.  Therefore, I believe... That Dems will try to rig the election using mail-in voting?  ??? If they already think they're winning, for what purpose?

Okay so if ANY of my followers support Trump, unfollow me now. After what he has done these last 4 years, I don‚Äôt understand how anyone can support him. As a person of the lgbtq+ community a vote for Trump or ANY OTHER candidate other than Biden is a vote against me personally.
No no no no the city girls support Biden and Harris... this is it
im still amazed that settle for biden is a legitimate organization
That‚Äôs what I take away from this pick.  And of course the super left views.   Not gonna change any votes for Biden.
Where would foreign policy be right now if Clinton were President? Would some form of the TPP have been enacted, giving U.S. based multinational corporations even more power? Did Trump simply delay what a Biden administration will carry out in the next 4-8 years?

The black vote for Democrats is not a given. Which is the point I'm trying to make, which you skipped right over and went to 99%. Biden has already made it clear that he thinks we're stupid, Kamala has already made it clear she'll play any card for votes. She tried to come off as

To maintain credibility with the press and Rhode Islanders, shouldn't Governor Raimondo have been honest 2 weeks ago &amp; said simply - yes, being vetted by the Biden campaign &amp; that's good for RI.
Four corners offense and prevent defense have their own risks.  Hillary spent Aug 2016 in the Hamptons. Biden seems to be blowing his lead.
The Q: was any part of latest rumor true, which encompassed: was she interviewed by Biden and/or his team? Did she fly out of state for the interview on specific date last week? "No." Amended Friday to: "I know she has not left the state. I don‚Äôt have any information beyond that"
Funny, I always say that Biden is racist and that I can't find any difference between him and Trump. Your powers of deduction are lacking as well as your comprehension and overall cognitive abilities to begin with. And you try to speak for blacks constantly. Do you know any?
. outperformance in the veepstakes raises the odds she'll be a serious contender for a position in the cabinet should Biden win
As recently as last week, we asked again if any part of rumor that  had been interviewed by Biden or his team was true.  The answer from her spox was: ‚Äúno.‚Äù Only AFTER ‚Å¶ piece did same spox clarify: she did not go out of state.
Well seeing how it's a video of only Joe Biden speaking unedited, you're right don't watch if you're offended by liars
Biden himself might be a little cringeworthy.  Harris tho? She'll go the 12 rounds, and then some.  Honestly, the ticket should be flipped.
Why isn‚Äôt she speaking at the convention? The  has abandoned the whole ‚ÄúBiden is the bridge to the future‚Äù before his nomination.
Trump may have received 24,000 NYPD pig votes but BIDEN/HARRIS got 300,000 Postal Workers!
What are you going to do on the chance that Trump is re-elected? There's always a possibility since he wasn't "supposed" to be elected this past election cycle. What if Biden losses and you get Trump for 4 more years? Then what?
How long can Harris-Biden not have to deal w/ the pesky press for? Hmmm.... We could ask Obama.
Polling Tip: Be Accurate in your Qs. Try asking "Are you going to vote for Harris - Biden?" Maybe you'll get the 'blowout' you were looking for.

maybe you missed the entire point of what you‚Äôre responding to, so i‚Äôll try again. it‚Äôs not that i ‚Äúlike‚Äù biden or think he‚Äôs ‚Äúbetter‚Äù than trump or the ‚Äúlesser evil‚Äù  this is it. the only way to save our democracy is to defeat trump. biden‚Äôs the opponent. that‚Äôs it.
Weird how they endorse Biden when they have no other choice. Who did they endorse in the primary? Oh, apparently the guy you think ruined their jobs
And I just gave the Biden/Harris campaign $50. All in.
Major US postal workers union endorses Biden for president
4 years of Biden doing absolutely nothing to slow or reverse the continuing rightward slide of America followed by an even more dimwitted populist ideologue, rinse, repeat, until we have moved so far right that Reagan and Thatcher's graves can be pissed on simultaneously
lol at these lunatics acting like Joe Biden is anything other than the most boring uninspiring centrist.
right now reporting on Trump pushing Barr to be the best AG ever if he does his bidding with Sen Johnson‚Äôs disinformation about Biden. Can you imagine that they are normalizing this? Done with them, the media really needs to step it up or we will end up like Belarus.
WTF thousands and thousands of countries,there is only 195 countries in the world. And Trump has the audacity to say Joe Biden is slow in his fake ads. lol
I would argue that genocidal dictators are not actually leftists because authoritarianism is a fascist ideology. That being said, for context, the person writing that tweet above was comparing being rude to a Biden canvasser to being an asshole in the alt-right lol
Why am I sad? Let me tell you!  NO excitement on Twitter for our AWESOME CANDIDATES: JOE BIDEN AND KAMALA HARRIS!  NO EXCITEMENT from the  for our AWESOME CANDIDATES! Perez should resign!  NO EXCITEMENT from our DEMOCRATIC Congress!  LETS GET GOING. VOTE.
Biden should have paid another kid to repeat it for him.
One of my neighbors has a LGBTQ+ flag sandwiched by two Biden flags. Seeing less and less political signs, too obvious that it's a waste of resources and just adding to the trash heap.
I hope the answer is obvious.  You may not like Joe Biden.  But he won‚Äôt destroy this country.  It really is that simple.  A vote for Biden is a vote to save America.
Had anyone in the administration had it.. It could have saved America.     We'll just wait for Biden and Harris.   I read a new hashtag today.. #cousinfucker.
what are you even talking about?  I'm voting to get a fascist out of office before American democracy is extinguished.  the end.  this is an existential crisis for our country, and you're babbling about brunch.  so, yes, some of us didn't want Biden, but we're adults about it.
Biden‚Äôs been in office 50 years how is that new leadership
It took a worldwide pandemic, hundreds of thousands of deaths and massive unemployment to bring the economy back to the Obama /Biden HIGH mark üòÇ
you can't just waive at multiple people and say "they're all the same, all bad" and then when someone points out the very idea of degrees, say it's ridiculous.  on every issue you care about, Biden is better than Trump, but "they're all the same, all bad"

a vote for a 3P candidate is a vote the 3P candidate.  why is this hard to understand?    they aren't "Clinton's votes" unless they vote for Clinton.  full stop.  but i want to GET TRUMP OUT, not "elect Biden."  and the only vote that GETS TRUMP OUT is Biden.
Now that Wokeness has become profitable, they can ride economy surge under Trump while blaming him for the misogyny and bigotry of the Americans voting for Kamala who will likely step in for Biden. More of the same if she gets in. For the record, I'm not a Trumper by any measure
says the guy who won't cast a meaningful vote against Trump.  listen to yourself!  it's on Biden if you choose to vote for Mickey Mouse?
The kind gentle questioning of Harris and Biden, compare that to the Trump scrum that he does on a daily basis? Notice not screaming??
can you try for a minute looking at the situation a different way?    your vote belongs to no one but you.    but there is one candidate who is a significant danger to all of us, especially those already in need.  a vote for anyone but Biden does not help get rid of Trump.
I know...You're not gonna let Joe Biden cut America's meat!
"Biden voters mostly say they plan to cast their vote by mail, 62% to 36%.  Trump supporters, though, plan to physically go to the polls ‚Äî 72% to 24%."  Any surprise why Republicans want to kill USPS in a pandemic?   Fucking cowards.

Don Pesci: The old, tired and reclusive Joe Biden
Gov. Raimondo impressed Joe Biden's team when interviewing for VP pick but had some drawbacks, per

Or I guess the correct thing to say would be from pat the berner "If sharing Biden &amp; Kamala's records helps Trump, then Biden &amp; Kamala's records help Trump."
lol Biden has done nothing in his 40 plus years... he won‚Äôt start now if he wins!
I'll stop now, but the idea that labor is "meh" on Biden is absurd.  You don't speak for the labor movement, it speaks for itself and enthusiastically endorses Joe Biden.
labor does support biden.  he has endorsements from the AFL‚ÄìCIO, Amalgamated Transit Union, American Federation of Government Employees, American Federation of Musicians, American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees, American Federation of Teachers  /1
I called it, hard to believe I was right. Only person we've seen try to lose this hard in our country was Trump 2016. Biden's not in this to win it, I'm pretty sure he's hoping this final spit on POC will get him safely back in his basement the next four years
I'm saying don't try to make *me* or *all democrats* responsible for some guy blocking you.  that's his decision, not mine, not Biden's, and not the Democratic party's.

My favorite thing about the Biden/Harris ticket is Ruth Bader Ginsburg.
Why he said it would take months, if ever, to count votes!  He is DETERMINED not to leave the Whitehouse. We need a landslide for BIDEN!   VOTE!  ENOUGH votes WILL be counted to WIN! DON'T STAY HOME!
is selling Biden masks for $20.00 each.... no wonder he wants them to be mandatory. üò∑
He's going to ask moderate Republicans and Republican leaning ind to vote for biden instead a 3rd party or staying home. Good enough for me. I also believe aoc should be given just as much if not more time as kasich
Yes. He was talking to Charlamagne Tha God.
He's not the impeached, treasonous, utter moron who's squatting in the White House right now.  In reality, Mr. Biden has a laundry list of qualifications for this job, but at the end of the day he's the anti-Trump, and THAT is what is going to win him this election.
The world has been laughing, excluding, and moving on without the US with Treasonous Trump, the impeached idiot, squatting in the White House.   President Biden will restore dignity and respect to the US, and to his office.
you can't assume the "leading candidate" would otherwise get the votes the "spoiler" candidate gets. I for one would never vote for an imperialist hawk like Biden. you're wasting time berating people for their convictions that you don't even seem interested in understanding.
naomi lachance was texted by a Biden volunteer who said they were 12 when asked, and at 9am the next morning texted the kid "baby did i say something wrong" which is the most grooming-ass creepy shit to pull on a 12 year old, after asking them to explain rape the night before.
lmao they de-checkmarked the "journalist" who was creeping on the 12 year old Biden text volunteer
about I still worrisome for a POC such as myself and given his history you please tell me why, being a POC, I should vote for him when he views us as unintelligent, inferior and just a means to get votes? Do you read the articles I post detailing this?
Tia please give it up. You I have no problem with me not voting for Trump but my reasoning for voting for Biden is that he is racist, has voted against minority interest for years including seeking out segregationist to work with him against busing. Those little gaffes you speak
WATCH: Here's what  told  two weeks ago about being vetted by the Biden campaign.
I tried to give these people the benefit of the doubt but I gave up on that months ago. I had a few people cussing me out because I don't want to vote for Biden. It's okay that I'm not voting for Trump but I'm a selfish egotistical person for not voting for Biden even though I've
Would it be best if those of us willing to vote for Biden stay out of this? I don't mean fail to strike--I'm asking if the voices leading this need to be a subset (people like you) or a coalition (people like me, center-right people like most of the Dem party, etc.)?
Electing them at all is the opposite of holding them accountable. Biden opposes busing and writes the crime bill and his reward is he gets to be president? Kamala uses her power to keep prisoners because they‚Äôre valuable labor and she gets to be VP?

If they were an adult then I legitimately don‚Äôt see what would be inappropriate about responding the way she did. If I was a victim of sexual assault I‚Äôd be pretty snappy too if someone tried to get me to make calls for Joe Biden.
Between Biden and Harris - will raise taxes, police are like the KKK, cops are the enemy, take away guns, open boarders and BOTH said Trumps economic policies would cripple America
I agree it‚Äôs their fault! I‚Äôm not trying to trap you into saying anything, as someone who wants trump out so badly that I‚Äôd settle for Biden even though I don‚Äôt agree with him on alot, and as a fellow progressive, I‚Äôm curious to understand your point of view.
According to the   had a "standout" interview with Biden's search team and left the team "dazzled."
It‚Äôs not bad faith! Like I supported Warren but when she dropped out,I supported Bernie bc he champions many of the same progressive causes that are important to me. I didn‚Äôt want Biden or any moderate, and I‚Äôm not thrilled about it but I sure as hell will vote for him over trump
Ok yay! I think you answered my question. Bernie is the only candidate you would support. It‚Äôs not just Biden, you wouldn‚Äôt have voted for anyone but Bernie, regardless of how closely policy aligns. Thank you!

The game plan is Biden steps down, Republicans make a stink about kamala not being constitutionally acceptable as president, she steps aside and the drunk Pelosi becomes president
Biden is racist Harris is fake the two of them are puppets of Pelosi I‚Äôm voting red in November
You mean the mfg jobs that Obama said were never coming back?  The ones that we lost due to NAFTA. Which Biden promoted
Someone needs to put out a challenge to post any Biden flags if they see them.
Great read. The final four in serious contention for the job were Harris, Rice, Warren and Whitmer.
It's either Carte Goodwin or Joe Biden, and I think it might be the latter.
If I had to show people two clips to sum up the 2020 primary, it would be this (ending the Bloomberg run), and the always awesome clip of  meeting Joe Biden in the NYT elevator.
Is that how you going to answer Biden during the debates ?  " Ahhhh...".   Lol
I'm not going to vote for the lesser of 2 racists. If you can tell me what Biden is going to do for minorities that's going to improve things, let me know. Biden has voted AGAINST minority interest his whole career. WHY should I trust him NOW? Obviously YOU have LESS to lose.
This does of course depend entirely on Biden diverging from the Obama Doctrine of "looking forward not backward"   i.e. overlooking the crimes of powerful people because they happened in the past, while overseeing the world's largest ever prison state for nonviolent offenders.
I guess at least if Biden is president he probably won't attempt to block  from delivering ballots in an effort to steal an election
Okay, since I dislike both Trump and Biden but I hate Biden's aw shucks form of racism more, you just talked me into voting for Trump. Since I can't have an opinion unless I vote. Nice job!
And the sad thing is that you would hesitate to vote for Biden.

But Biden said today that "Trump Coddled Terrorist" lol.
Some of these are certainly compelling arguments but I‚Äôm not fully convinced on all the points. Regardless this is a far more convincing argument than ‚Äúget over it‚Äù or ‚Äúanything other than a vote Biden is a vote for Trump‚Äù.
It‚Äôs very close, on financial issues and domestic health, Biden is further right, but Boris worse on immigration. They are about the same on energy and foreign policy I feel.
Then why are you demanding loyalty and a vote rather than fighting for better policies. Biden‚Äôs still hasn‚Äôt been named as the nominee till the convention. Why would you stop making demands? Especially now? It‚Äôs a pandemic depression. Millions are losing their healthcare
I‚Äôm not voting for trump. I hear that‚Äôs a vote for Biden
Biden and Harris are fascists too bro

He's too busy doing Putin's bidding to smear Biden to undertake necessary work.
Biden/CNN and Trump/FOX NEWS. What else is new.
Extremely fucked up that Joe Biden has plagiarized all of his speeches from Molloy. We should‚Äôve known after his 15 minute bit at the Iowa State Fair about sucking on pebbles.
I‚Äôm garbage because?... I said yelling at people and name calling doesn‚Äôt recruit voters. Ok.   How many calls have you made phone banking for Biden today?
All I hear all day long is how great Biden is at this or how wonderful Biden did that. Biden, Biden, Biden!
Guys some people are constantly bullying me over Biden choice they say I am progressive deep state agent
I'm getting a kick out of everyone that lambasted Ted Cruz for backing Trump after he got eviscerated by him during the debates only to go "YAAAASSS" at Biden picking the woman who called him a racist and said she believed the women that accused him of misconduct.
Not when Joe Biden is president The world is already laughing at us because of you because of your ignorance and stupidity world leaders laughing at us you‚Äôre worried about UAE  we have lines of Americans trying to get a box of food you are the worst president ever

Another way that the DEMS can try to cast the   ticket as one that reflects 21st century America.  Going forwards, not backwards. Biden's age may get in the way of that messaging, but this is why Harris' background helps.  #Election2020
Honestly, if I am the Biden campaign, I am putting Kamala on television every day. Trump will lose his mind. (If there's anymore of it left to go.)
By the way, have you ever wondered why Kamala Harris is good enough to be for VP but NOT president? How come 2nd best? There was so much diversity in the Democrat candidate pool, young, gay, Asian, female, whatever Liz Warren was that day. How'd you get old, white, racist Biden?
BIDEN IS A CLINTON CARTEL CRIMINAL. ALL DEMORATS ALWAYS ABOVE ALL USA LAW'S.
Maybe Biden should get behind the People.
The world is currently laughing at Trump because of his botched handling of COVID-19 amongst other things including his fanning the flames of racial tensions. A Biden and Harris will restore honor and respectability to the U.S. #BidenandHarris2020
To anyone who may have purchased a baseball cap from the Biden online store, how is the fit?
Yeah, Right.  I mean Obama/Biden brokered a peace agreement with them too...  Oh no, that's right, they destabilized Libya &amp; Syria instead, causing 600,000-1,000,000 dead.
I‚Äôm quite jealous of the folks excited for the Biden/Harris ticket. Like wouldn‚Äôt that be nice?
Biden ought to make this an issue, particularly with seniors and veterans. This president is taking away your mail delivery because he's afraid he might lose an election. Seriously.

Nobody is sweating like Judgey Jeanine today after her death "premonition" about Joe Biden last night. She'll be getting a visit from the FBI. Perhaps another suspension from Fox Spews.
Its funny bc I read the investment strat reports on Biden‚Äôs admin and its like nobody bothers to read the policies he has up on his website. Its pretty amazing
Jill Biden should be charged with elderly abuse for allowing this to happen.
And guess who gets to be prez when Biden steps down? The dema will say Kamala isn't going to fight this....Oh, how convenient, Nancy Pelosi is next in line.
One might think that political reporters for the  *might* be interested in questions like whether or not Harris still thinks Joe Biden is a serial sexual harasser, or an old school busing bigot, or even ask about her recent, awkward looking plastic surgery.  Nope.
If Trump wins, then it‚Äôs four years of the liberal blame game.   If Biden wins, I can guarantee it‚Äôs four years of liberal complacency.
But that means not voting for Trump IS a vote for Biden. Man what a paradox...
Only 82 days left for the ‚Äúif you don‚Äôt vote/if you don‚Äôt vote Biden, you‚Äôre voting for trump‚Äù folks
and he is the same person he was 50 years ago. Yet Biden can change even though he said many racist things the last year &amp; his 40 years in politics has not been stellar when it comes to minorities or women if you throw Anita Hill into the mix. How is he different? He's NOT.
Yup. If it‚Äôs close he‚Äôs gonna demand six recounts, if Biden thwomps him, he‚Äôs gonna cry fraud.
Why is it all of the things they accuse Trump of they are willing to accept when it comes to Biden. I had one tell me 1977 and the busing issue would Biden was before he was born, happened in the past and people can change. But all I heard the last 3 years how Trump is racist
160,000 dead Americans didn‚Äôt change Trump‚Äôs popularity. Remember that as you read coverage about the election and whether Biden‚Äôs message is working or whatever armchair campaign quarterbacking narrative gets a lot of play. Most votes are just not up for grabs.
The point I'm trying to make is how phony the left is in regard to diversity &amp; tolerance when they could have had a more divers candidate yet shows Biden. Harris's is to shut everyone up &amp; to pander to certain groups. I doubt it was Biden's ACTUAL choice given his racist history.

I believe this is overthinking it. Cooking and family are often part of her public persona. But calculation is part of every politician's public speech, male or female. Biden talks about family all the time - genuine or calculated? On the other hand, Trump never does.
Good Morning to the 93% of black people who aren‚Äôt categorically unintelligent and are voting for Biden in November.  I love you all, so deeply, with all of my mind and spirit.

Pelosi Schumer Schiff Nadler Biden probably hold the world record for the longest time on public assistance. The have been living high on the hog at the taxpayers expense for far too long. It‚Äôs time we found genuine people that love America to represent us.
No he launched his career working with segregationists against busing so his children wouldn't have to grow up in a racial jungle.üòè
How? I've already shown you how he's racist. Why is it you have an issue with Trump because he's racist according to you &amp; you are supposed to be so woke intolerant &amp; non-racist but you can accept racism from Biden? Racism is racism. No such thing as being just a "little" racist.
I‚Äôm sorry.. but these Bernie die hards shitting on Biden are gonna make me blow a fucking gasket. Do you understand what is at stake here?! Put away your ego and do the right thing. ü§¨
Am. Electoral politics has rarely been the place of radical change. That lives elsewhere in Am. political life. But what I think we get in a Biden-Harris is a team that is closer to the deepest concerns of the vast maj. of Americans. And that is something important!!

While President Biden may decide on a pardon, Cyrus Vance is not bound by it.  A NY state prison might become Trump‚Äôs new home.  With the benefit of years, I think Ford was right to pardon Nixon.  Not as simple this time.

I like how Biden supporters are straight up telling me that these days. That's what it means when you say "it's not as bad as it could have been"
#KamalaHarris was a bad choice for VP but a worse choice was #Biden for president is pretty much the vibe I'm getting
They got me with Bass because that suggestion came out of the left of the party. But Rice only makes sense if you think like a DC insider (imo): technocratic liberal with no domestic policy chops who will never overshadow Biden. In a way, it seems perfect for his low-key strat.
Rice made no sense to us in the electorate, but she made sense to people who think Biden only wants to replicate 2009-2017. And the GOP thinks Dems are arrogant enough to just ignore Benghazi (which while stupid was in fact a big-ish deal).
For the first time in history, I think a headfake worked. I am utterly convinced Rice was a fake-out designed to get the GOP ready to re-litigate Benghazi, and the media bought into the fake for precisely the amount of time Biden needed them to for it to penetrate GOP circles.
apparently each hateful idiot in America is going to require an immediate family member to go on a ventilator ... and then they‚Äôll potentially be open to denying this is a different way, perhaps something involving Biden or maybe child abduction.
I'm not one to defend pundits, but they may mean safe as far as ideology. She is far less radical than some of the other contenders. Like Biden, she is an establishment Democrat.
Funny how folks like you never said that about the even flimsier allegations The Intercept (and Intercept alone by the end) pushed about Biden.  How did Bernie Sanders, a good man, end up surrounding himself with the utter dregs of political organizing?
Biden is a racist twit. Read some of these articles and some of the things that he has said and done not only in the far past but recently and then you tell me in good faith how as a black woman I can honestly support him. You can have him if you're that naive and blind.
Fuck Joe Biden.
Biden is pro-life. He wears a mask.
When VP Harris said "open and... shut," Trump and Pence exhailed and buckled like they'd been kicked in the croch.  Biden/Harris 2020.
I don't trust mail in ballots with what's going on. I'm going to wear my mask, social distance, and proudly go vote for Biden /Harris. If rather risk going than to not have my vote count. I fucking hate this Administration. Pure corruption.
It's not about Kamala or Biden.ü§î It's about weeding out the people who are pretending to be on a certain agenda while literally on the other side. I would prefer facts rather than interpretations and whether any of her new work has progressed in a new direction.

Ambassador Rice makes a very cool point about people in Biden's camp: Fidelity. It is important They can be trusted.  This is an AWESOME clip.  Goes to respect for the candidate - and reflects the value of high quality people in management.  So cool....So Susan Rice.
If Joe Biden is inaugurated and the Senate flips I‚Äôll have the emotional bandwidth to contemplate the whole Virtual Youtuber thing. Until then I‚Äôm going for pure Patrick O‚ÄôBrian mode where I don‚Äôt know whether computers exist and only know about frigates, sloops, staysails etc
Is Biden my first choice? No of course not. But am I gonna vote for someone who literally said they would date their own daughter? ABSOLUTELY THE FUCK NOT.
why did you give Joe Biden better music than you? Also Trains are socialism.
Susan Rice is truly just a class act right now on Maddow. Speaking glowingly about Kamala and the thoroughness of the vetting process. 100% in a Biden / Harris administration if they win. My guess would be Secretary of State.
Do you consider "supporting Biden over Trump" involves calling everyone to Biden's left the equivalent of a Trump Nazi? Because insulting people for disagreeing with your candidate isnt providing support to your candidate
(Before anyone misinterprets me I‚Äôm not encouraging you to not vote for Biden. What I am saying is that in this case the lesser evil will still lead to the literal end of the world unless we all start acting like climate change is the colossal and immediate threat that it is.)
Joe Biden make your campaign song "Is This Thing On?" by the Promise Ring challenge
If y‚Äôall really think Biden worse than trump y‚Äôall got another thing coming lol, they both trash but for sure one if worse than the other
If Trump underwent a health evaluation, Biden must, too! He looks unhealthy and shows many signs of cognitive decline. His refusal proves he's hiding something!
Biden's pick was racist and sexist. Blindly caving to subjugated persons isn't the same as being free from prejudice, it's just reverse-prejudice.
By the way Chris Dodd (criminal who received kickbacks from Countrywide) is now a Sr. Advisor to Joe Biden...
He's too dumb to hurt Biden.
The condescension when she talks about crime, as if criminal reform activists want to stop violent criminals from going to jail. This is the vp I have to vote for, on top of Biden for president. This is my nightmare ticket.
I‚Äôd glad backtrack if his entire speech is pro-life propaganda but I have a funny feeling that the topic won‚Äôt come up beyond maybe some vague allusion to ‚Äúnot agreeing with Biden on everything but Trump needs to be removed‚Äù type point.
Biden might have that inclination because isn‚Äôt he basically asking that of us, too? I‚Äôm still working on letting go of how he treated Anita Hill.
Biden might have that inclination because isn‚Äôt he asking that of us, too? I‚Äôm still working on letting go of how he treated Anita Hill.
They've been telling us that since the most recent primary rigging. I mean, Biden himself has explicitly told me on several occasions not to vote for him.
I cant believe ya let Biden beat my boy Bernie sanders. Bernie could beat trump. Smh. Fuck this election ü§£ü§£ü§£ #BernieSanders2020 üëåüôèüèºüôèüèº
What is up with that? Tyt is supporting Biden! They are rats thoughüôâüôâüôâ
My first book was on the politics of the Social Security Trust Fund. I may need to write a new edition that discusses President Trump's pledge to terminate the payroll tax--and how he gave an unexpected political gift to Joe Biden. 1/2
I live on Massachusetts and in the last week, I have witnessed 2 Trump rallies on street corners...I haven't even seen a Biden yard sign...that has to say something(not that Mass will go republican, but there is a deep groundswell of Trump support)
Biden has basically been calling blacks unintelligent for years. Don't forget he thought his running mate was an exception to the rule.
All I have heard for the last three years is Trump's history with minorities and the fact that he can't change and will never change. I'm going to hold Biden to that same standard. What's good for one is good for both or for neither. They're both old white men from the same time.
Joe Biden didn't screw up his words and to me that says all of his video flubs have been faked because he intended to claim Dementia as a defense when he is prosecuted. His Dementia is fake. As far as Harris, she's trash.
From what you told me about Trump these last 3 years. I don't support either one. And if you think Biden has changed oh, you obviously haven't been paying attention to anything he has said concerning the black community the last year. Not that you care, I do. Not voting for him.
Biden didn't singlehandedly bring Healthcare to a generation of Black children in the South the way Clinton did (CHIP). So I very much buy this.
Trump is accused of 26 rapes and sexual assaults. And trump is still a legit racist. Biden was misguided by the tough on crime bullshit but he's capable of change and growth. Learned from his mistakes. Trump was is and will always be racist.
I‚Äôm willing to defend Kamala against any and all sexist, racist, mysogonist bullshit. She should be ambitious. She should show no remorse for calling out Biden‚Äôs racist political history  But I‚Äôll also call out her disgusting prosecurorial record. Her hypocrisy and opportunism...
What evidence do you have of Trump that you don‚Äôt have of Biden?
Except a communist would advocate for the end of the state and communal living. Biden is literally a corpratist and centrist. Y'all just call anyone left of center a communist
The entire Biden Campaign would be burning to the ground right now if he made the wrong choice, omg.
Joe Biden announces since the announcement of Kamala Harris as VP, the campaign raised $26 million including 150,000 first time donors.
Seriously this is one of the things I respect most about  Trump's narcissism demands absolute loyalty - Biden decided that someone who challenged him was best suited for the job. #BidenHarris
It‚Äôs hard for me to watch Biden. I‚Äôm holding my breath the entire time.
It's more like you don't get to rally around Defund / Abolish Police only to support Biden and Harris considering who the fuck they are.
Joe Biden And Kamala Harris Host First Joint Campaign Event
You seem to have entirely different criticisms for the left than Joe Biden when we call for wildly popular and *practical* policies, but Joe claims hes gonna cure a collection of loosely connected diseases that have eluded scientists for centuries.
Biden gives me hope bc no one is under the delusion that Biden is going to do anything substantial of his own volition but can be forced into things. His base is malleable. Trump's base is a death cult. Th solution is to work on multiple fronts at once; th streets &amp; th ballot box
Yeah, longtime centrist Joe Biden just screams "Sharia Law"
advice to Biden: "Pick someone who will help you win". Biden listened and did just that.
Joe Biden And Kamala Harris Host First Joint Campaign Event
I haven't mentioned Obama. I gave you all Joe. Past Joe and present Joe. All of the same qualities you complain about in Trump, you accept in Biden. Which is why I won't be voting again in 2020 just like I didn't in 2016. Good luck to you.üëãüèΩüëãüèΩüëãüèΩ
Biden and Harris make 1st appearance as historic Democratic ticket
Right, abortion is 1 issue of thousands . He‚Äôs dead wrong on it. A lot of people are.  It sucks.  You can pretty much guarantee it won‚Äôt be a part of his speech and it certainly has no bearing on Biden‚Äôs platform.
Where do liars go bishop? Biden is a devout catholic.
do you still believe Joe Biden‚Äôs accusers and still think he‚Äôs a racist??? Just wondering
Is the current gov terrible? Yes Will a Biden/Harris win make it less terrible? Eh, possibly. Politicians are human and I'm not putting all my "progressive" eggs in this election basket.
Neither. But no choice is a choice, I guess. Biden 2020.
Really? What what are the five words I said just before I said I'm not a Biden supporter? You may view the video again as many times as you need to as well as peruse my timeline for the answer. I can't deal.üòè
Should we try to imagine what is going on in Biden‚Äôs head?
when they screech that known-quantity, staid, moderate Joe Biden, who's been a public figure for 4 decades, is part of a radical socialist plot to do ... anything, they sound ridiculous to most Americans.  Joe Biden is many things, but a socialist is not one of them.
Anyone besides me notice the huge difference between Biden/Harris and tRUMPs crowds? MASKS!! Really, we‚Äôre the smart party, it‚Äôs clear!!!üò∑
Joe Biden and Kamala Harris introduce their presidential ticket in Delaware
RIGHT NOW: Joe Biden and his VP pick Kamala Harris in their first joint appearance
SICK OF SCANDALS YET??!!!!!!!
Y‚Äôall steady dunkin on Shaun King for his Kamala flip flop (fuck Shaun King btw), instead of what Biden‚Äôs agenda is.  Here you go fyi -&gt;
Wait, Kamela Harris as VP AND 007? Kind of like Jack Ryan, only really cool? Would Biden be like hanging back in his shades saying, no, just wait a minute, Kam's got this. I am so up for this show.
Trump doesn't need me to attack Biden, Biden makes it perfectly easy for Trump all on his own.  Maybe you should give Biden more credit
Biden's choice was not about choosing to make the right candidate, but is about  making history by having a female VP. the dnc are repeating the same mistakes like they did trying to make Hillary  president...it backfired.
Trump apparently knocked a million doors last week. Wouldn't put faith in polls too much cuz polls don't turnout voters and Biden being in the basement and inspiring no one makes him the default pick until Trump does something to actually help people (like unemployment benefits)
Streaming now: Joe Biden and Kamala Harris make their first joint appearance.
Watch #Live: Joe Biden, Kamala Harris set to make campaign debut in Delaware:
Select Biden and get his ass out
So many people I used to know and like, they‚Äôve all been saying they‚Äôre going to vote for Biden. And if that was not disappointing enough, they‚Äôre now shouting to the heavens with full throated rejoicing over the Kamala Harris pick. Seriously, I need to get new friends.
Would you like to speculate more about my emotions or continue accusing me of doing a fascism?  Every minute you spend talking to me instead of phonebanking for Joe Biden is a minute phonebanking for Donald Trump. I dont make the rules.
Obama and Biden took this economy out of FREEFALL and handed Trump &amp; GOPigs a THRIVING economy which Trump TRASHED out of sheer incompetence.  10 YEARS OF RECOVERY UNDER OBAMA &amp; BIDEN GONE!
Biden's worked on ALL of this before!  THE LAST GOPig that was in office crashed the economy too!
Biden's an old dealmaker with no convictions who could be convinced to delegate power to lefties to gain their support (similar to a parliamentary coalition system).   Harris will probably try to pack the team with loyalists and outmaneuver any actual leftists
the main takeaway for the Left from Biden's announcement is that any chance of pushing the ticket left is gone now that Harris is on board
So Kamala Harris And Joe Biden are more dangerous to black folks than Trump and Pence .   That‚Äôs what y‚Äôall tryna tell me . Okay cool .
if you're considering not voting, or voting for anyone other than Biden, read this response the President gave to a softball question from a friendly interviewer.  The man is NOT well.  If someone in your family spoke like this, you'd have hushed conversations about "what to do"
This is Biden‚Äôs VP, asking people to bail out those who looted, burned, and rioted in Minnesota! Great pick, Joe!
And the thing is - Biden already has. He has consistently been pivoting left throughout his career to remain the center of the Democratic Party itself. And will likely continue to do so. Also, historically, candidates who campaigned as moderates have had a higher success rate.
That Biden-Bass alliteration would‚Äôve really hit
Free ponies for all!!! Screw Trump! Smell kids hair Biden!
Joe Biden is so slow and confused, if he‚Äôd been alive in 1917, he would‚Äôve delayed the pandemic to 1918, and world war 2 never would‚Äôve ended.
I believe Biden is a catholic. I‚Äôm not sure where he got his facts from.  is a sad horrible human being with no regard for humans.
They're not going to be like the Benghazi committee. I think Biden w/b best to appoint a special commission like after 9/11.
Mindy Kaling is 'filled with hope' over Kamala Harris becoming Joe Biden's running mate  via
How do you feel about all the black peoples that have been locked up due to the 1994 crime bill that Joe Biden drafted?
Mr. Biden We want Bernie and Yang also by your side!
As for progressives, I think most will get on board and vote for Biden and against Trump, but there will be an energy/ enthusiasm gap particularly among young people who are currently so energized in the policing/ race social movement and who are way to the left of Biden/Harris.
I would think that many voters will see through Trump's attempt to smear Biden/ Harris as socialist anarchist radicals, but on the other hand for many on the right Dems in general represent these things. Nevertheless, its an odd choice of messaging for these specific individuals.
Biden Really "has his finger on the pulse of the nation" right? Lol clown vs clown in 2020. I can't believe I used to respect him
The way I‚Äôve been feeling lately Kamala could stand in the middle of 5th Ave, shoot somebody and I‚Äôd still be happy to vote Team Biden/Harris.
Dude you got your Biden/Harris ticket, they're literally conservative carceral Democrats
It fits both republican and democrat narrative because if Biden/Harris find a way to fuck this up then democrats can blame it on a radical left platform and pull even harder right next time
Are you for real? Do you think Biden is any better? How much research have you done on him? Or is it just vote blue no matter who?
Keen observers point out unusual elements of Biden‚Äôs Instagram post with Harris
Biden and Harris are complicit. That will always matter, and will not always simplistically answer every choice.
There are ways in which voting for someone like Biden is mutually exclusive with progressive causes. A completely black-and-white, facile application of that fact to everything in all cases doesn't make sense. It's not right.
Personally, I'm not a "change from within" person. I have voted for non-establishment and third party candidates many times, including in presidential primaries and elections. I'm going to vote for Biden AND continue to advocate for the creation of a truly progressive party.
When I was supporting Elizabeth Warren, a lot of Kamala Harris supporters blocked me for refuting bad faith arguments against her. Now I'm supporting the Biden/Harris ticket and expect the same from Warren supporters.  We can support women without pitting them against each other.
Biden and Harris aren't the only ones who win. They don't get appointed to the Supreme Court, where they can defend marginalized people. A judge does. Obama wasn't all that progressive, and we still made him help with the supreme Court and trans issues.
It absolutely is a literal threat. I'm voting for Biden because I'm threatened. More importantly I'm voting for Biden because of who else is threatened. A lot more Black and Brown people are going to die in 2021 if a federally coordinated response is not put in place.
Biden gives Trump a gift: All of Kamala's baggage
trust me I know biden and trump both are terrible candidates too, but shit i‚Äôd rather have a qualified mf in the office then ye, all respect to ye but homie just ain‚Äôt it
They want him to siphon votes from Biden and he's going to siphon votes from Trump!ü§£
Read this re: Biden/Harris - It‚Äôs not exactly how I feel but it‚Äôs pretty close:
Can‚Äôt wait let‚Äôs go Biden Harris 2020
Dear Bishop Tobin: I have been a professor at a Catholic college in your diocese for 25 years. I am not Catholic (I'm Episcopalian), but have dozens of close Catholic friends who also are not Catholic if Joe Biden isn't. You are litmus-testing your flock into non-existence.
Is there some mistake? Joe Biden is a baptized Roman Catholic.
You all call Donald Trump a fascist (he is!) but I just saw someone tweet that anyone who criticizes the Biden/Harris ticket is responsible for Trump getting elected again and folks, that‚Äôs fascism too. This is a democracy. Hold them all accountable.
Such a head spinner to get an email from the Trump campaign referring to Biden and Harris as "two of our nation's most RADICAL democrats who LOVE anarchy" while progressives on Twitter lament that once again Dems have left behind the left base of the party.
i‚Äôll say this once. if you vote for biden/kamala and your reaction is anything but this, you need to reevaluate yourself, ESPECIALLY if you‚Äôre a white liberal.  if you vote for them as a ‚Äúneccesary evil,‚Äù i get it. but the same ACAB libs somehow ‚Äúcelebrating‚Äù this combo... man.
(3/3) vote.‚Äù We need to get rid of the electoral college, we need ranked voting, we need valid third party candidates but right now we‚Äôre stuck working within this shit institution. I‚Äôll vote for Biden and Copmala but I can‚Äôt fault anyone who decides they can‚Äôt.
I'd put my money on Pompeo  Biden won't win, the polls are very clear on thisYeah but can anyone else say they have been a Joe Biden supporter since day one üòé
Here‚Äôs how to finish the thoughts of your ‚Äúprogressive ‚Äúfriends who want to vote for Biden/Harris but: ‚ÄîPart of me enjoys good old school racism ‚ÄîHe didn‚Äôt put ALL the kids in cages ‚ÄîIt‚Äôd be cool if we got along w/ Russia ‚Äî165K deaths sounds like a lot but I mean, shit happens
And if you win? What then? Is it still still fraud? Should Biden Contest/demand recount?
The benefit of a Biden/Harris administration is the end of a fascist administration, so if Harris becomes President, America can continue as a democratic republic.
Remember when women all around the world marched in protest of Trump's inauguration?  Too bad you didn't stand with us.  McCain would vomit on you if he were still alive, particularly hearing the Biden attacks.
Imagine I listen to Trump. The logic goes then, that:  I believe that Dems believe the MSM.  MSM says Biden will win in a landslide.  Therefore, I believe... That Dems will try to rig the election using mail-in voting?  ??? If they already think they're winning, for what purpose?
I had the exact same thought a day after he mentioned Kamala. They haven't wanted Joe out of the basement.  Fox's Baier pushes back after Pirro says Biden might not be on Democratic ticket
Oh no! Donald is having a briefing later!  Hensi trying to get Time in before convention next week!  Hopefully  will give Joe Biden and Kamala Harris their time WITHOUT interuption from trump!  He'll do something to screw it up!
Mr. President, the media is in the tank for Mr. Biden!
Okay so if ANY of my followers support Trump, unfollow me now. After what he has done these last 4 years, I don‚Äôt understand how anyone can support him. As a person of the lgbtq+ community a vote for Trump or ANY OTHER candidate other than Biden is a vote against me personally.
Their desperation has turned the flu season into the end of the world. People will start believing that if Biden is elected the main stream media will start reporting on it as just the flu and the anxiety, hysteria and fear will dissipate.  Join my army or die.
Trump may have received 24,000 NYPD pig votes but BIDEN/HARRIS got 300,000 Postal Workers!
How long can Harris-Biden not have to deal w/ the pesky press for? Hmmm.... We could ask Obama.
Polling Tip: Be Accurate in your Qs. Try asking "Are you going to vote for Harris - Biden?" Maybe you'll get the 'blowout' you were looking for.
They have asked for those funds... 2 months ago when they passed the HEROS BILL YOU MORON! YOU ARE THE PROBLEM NOT THE SOLUTION.... BIDEN AND HARRIS ARE GOING TO STEP UP AND SHUT YOU DOWN... VOTE BLUE!
81 days and we can say goodbye to the national nightmare we call Joe Biden &amp; Kamala Harris. #Trump2020
I‚Äôm sure Obama/Biden had no knowledge of this????
Why am I sad? Let me tell you!  NO excitement on Twitter for our AWESOME CANDIDATES: JOE BIDEN AND KAMALA HARRIS!  NO EXCITEMENT from the  for our AWESOME CANDIDATES! Perez should resign!  NO EXCITEMENT from our DEMOCRATIC Congress!  LETS GET GOING. VOTE.
It took a worldwide pandemic, hundreds of thousands of deaths and massive unemployment to bring the economy back to the Obama /Biden HIGH mark üòÇ
Amen on that James Woods this country is hard to recognize now imagine what would happen with Biden and Harris God help us all they‚Äôll be no more United States of America it will cease to exist nice going Democrats
It‚Äôs actually a gift for Biden, as more women insults from the morally bankrupt one are on the way!
It scares me to death that Biden/Harris could be put into the office of the highest office in the land. IF it happens, prepare for the worse...........
If Biden is elected I bet Hydracloraquin will be acceptable for use.
Virginia mayor faces calls to resign after saying Joe Biden picked ‚ÄòAunt Jemima as his VP‚Äô in Facebook post. We must render people like this extinct from public life. And I don‚Äôt accept your apology. Just quit and go home where can do no harm.
Pence says "I've   got red meat and Biden and Harris are not going to cut it"
Why he said it would take months, if ever, to count votes!  He is DETERMINED not to leave the Whitehouse. We need a landslide for BIDEN!   VOTE!  ENOUGH votes WILL be counted to WIN! DON'T STAY HOME!
Would it be best if those of us willing to vote for Biden stay out of this? I don't mean fail to strike--I'm asking if the voices leading this need to be a subset (people like you) or a coalition (people like me, center-right people like most of the Dem party, etc.)?
Between Biden and Harris - will raise taxes, police are like the KKK, cops are the enemy, take away guns, open boarders and BOTH said Trumps economic policies would cripple America
Let‚Äôs recap the desperate lies we‚Äôve heard from Trump/Pence so far. They‚Äôve claimed a Biden/Harris administration will mean: ‚ÄîNo more cows ‚ÄîNo more meat ‚ÄîNo more hamburgers ‚ÄîNo more 2nd Amendment ‚ÄîNo more guns ‚ÄîTrillions in taxes on the middle class
Biden is racist Harris is fake the two of them are puppets of Pelosi I‚Äôm voting red in November
. had a ‚Äústandout interview‚Äù and ‚Äúleft the search committee dazzled‚Äù but had a ‚Äúlimited national profile and adversarial relationship with influential labor unions.‚Äù ‚Äî Biden Chose Harris: A Search That Forged New Stars, Friends and Rivalries
But Biden said today that "Trump Coddled Terrorist" lol.
He's too busy doing Putin's bidding to smear Biden to undertake necessary work.
Biden/CNN and Trump/FOX NEWS. What else is new.
I'm getting a kick out of everyone that lambasted Ted Cruz for backing Trump after he got eviscerated by him during the debates only to go "YAAAASSS" at Biden picking the woman who called him a racist and said she believed the women that accused him of misconduct.
Not when Joe Biden is president The world is already laughing at us because of you because of your ignorance and stupidity world leaders laughing at us you‚Äôre worried about UAE  we have lines of Americans trying to get a box of food you are the worst president ever
BIDEN BEEN TAKING CASH DONATIONS FROM SEX AND DRUG TRAFFICKING CRIMINALS SINCE PABLO ESCOBAR
BIDEN BEEN TAKING CASH DONATIONS FROM SEX AND DRUG TRAFFICKING CRIMINALS SINCE PABLO ESCOBAR WAS THE CARTEL LEADERüëøüëøüëø
So I can assume you are voting for Biden/Harris then  since you are apparently so against nepotism?  Or is nepotism ok only if rich white people do it?
BIDEN IS A CLINTON CARTEL CRIMINAL. ALL DEMORATS ALWAYS ABOVE ALL USA LAW'S.
Maybe Biden should get behind the People.
He‚Äôd run circles around Trump or Biden
Yeah, Right.  I mean Obama/Biden brokered a peace agreement with them too...  Oh no, that's right, they destabilized Libya &amp; Syria instead, causing 600,000-1,000,000 dead.
Adding the extra ‚Äúa‚Äù made me give Biden a Super Mario voice in my head. ‚ÄúWe are not a dictators‚Äù
Jill Biden should be charged with elderly abuse for allowing this to happen.
If Trump wins, then it‚Äôs four years of the liberal blame game.   If Biden wins, I can guarantee it‚Äôs four years of liberal complacency.
Only 82 days left for the ‚Äúif you don‚Äôt vote/if you don‚Äôt vote Biden, you‚Äôre voting for trump‚Äù folks
Yup. If it‚Äôs close he‚Äôs gonna demand six recounts, if Biden thwomps him, he‚Äôs gonna cry fraud.
Pelosi Schumer Schiff Nadler Biden probably hold the world record for the longest time on public assistance. The have been living high on the hog at the taxpayers expense for far too long. It‚Äôs time we found genuine people that love America to represent us.
46 days ago,  nearly choked up on the debate stage, attacking  for his racist policies ‚Äî noting the personal impact they had on her childhood.  But the door to power swung open, and Biden‚Äôs racist actions were thrown out the window...  WAKE UP AMERICA‚ÄºÔ∏è
I actually liked Biden‚Äôs speech yesterday for a change
Biden/Harris 2020: Let's Get to Work  Trump/Pence 2020: My Hair's Shiny
They MUST debate! Biden can show just how STUPID donald is!
Mark your calendar!   You going? Your home state is hosting. Lots of republicans there serving in congress. You all screwed up. Biden and Harris are who WE AREüá∫üá∏
I think many, if not all of the women, will be in Biden's cabinet
I don't trust mail in ballots with what's going on. I'm going to wear my mask, social distance, and proudly go vote for Biden /Harris. If rather risk going than to not have my vote count. I fucking hate this Administration. Pure corruption.
Is Biden my first choice? No of course not. But am I gonna vote for someone who literally said they would date their own daughter? ABSOLUTELY THE FUCK NOT.
I did my best to defend Joe Biden‚Äôs Catholic faith today. But the real proof is Joe Biden himself and his life.
I love  he is a wonderful man.... I still remember watching President Obama award him the metal of freedom with tear running down my face ..... Biden/Harris = Hope that we will remember who we are #VOTE
What is up with that? Tyt is supporting Biden! They are rats thoughüôâüôâüôâ
Kamala and Biden: we ain‚Äôt hidin‚Äô!  Biden and Kamala: make you wanna holla!  Pence and Trump: for when you can‚Äôt take a dump.  Trump and Pence: like getting your dick hurt climbing over a barbwire fence.
It's more like you don't get to rally around Defund / Abolish Police only to support Biden and Harris considering who the fuck they are.
do you still believe Joe Biden‚Äôs accusers and still think he‚Äôs a racist??? Just wondering
Biden's choice was not about choosing to make the right candidate, but is about  making history by having a female VP. the dnc are repeating the same mistakes like they did trying to make Hillary  president...it backfired.
I live in New England - the whole region is navy blue and voting for Biden - I guess I‚Äôm insulated.
Back to the start - my husband worked for (Sen.) Biden for a few years before med school - found Joe Biden to be one of the most sincere and thoughtful persons to grace the chambers - loved by both Reps and Dems to this day. His faith is strong and evident. Say what u will.
Joe Biden is so slow and confused, if he‚Äôd been alive in 1917, he would‚Äôve delayed the pandemic to 1918, and world war 2 never would‚Äôve ended.

Sweetie, as a typical burbmom, I have a absurdly large FB friend/relative posse - and THOSE burbmoms, from FL, RI, TX, CA, AZ, GA, MD, PA, NY, SC r ALL voting Biden/Harris too :)! But that‚Äôs cute how u thought I was only talking about my neighborhood ;).
BIDEN ALWAYS RUN BY CLINTON CARTEL CRIMINALS
If it looks like a windmill and sounds like a windmill ... it‚Äôs a WIND TURBINE... hey Trump just grab ‚Äòem by the windmills...
First thing I saw this morning, Trump calling NBA players very stupid. Then I saw he posted about Biden freeing black prisoners. Now this. But he‚Äôs the least racist. Ignorant and hateful.
Suburban , white, married,mid-50‚Äôs, mom of 3 ya‚Äôs, Catholic, CCD teacher who doesn‚Äôt know a single woman of her friends/neighbors who‚Äôs voting for DJT - the ‚Äòburbs r ridin‚Äô with Biden!
Horrible pick. Probably the worst choice Biden could have made. He could have chosen Tulsi.
Corey Booker... is he one of the missing Coreys? Like Corey Feldman, or Corey Haim?   BTW: My wife is a suburban housewife now. She's voting for Biden and Harris, and totally excited. Sorry Donnie!
I‚Äôm a suburban woman, I live in Bucks County, PA and guess what I‚Äôm voting for Biden! The homes here have Biden signs on their lawns. We are going blue!
It‚Äôs going to be fun to watch  kick  ‚Äòs ass in the debates. In fact, here‚Äôs a fun thought: why doesn‚Äôt Trump/Pence debate Biden/Harris in a Fourth Presidential Debate? Nah, it won‚Äôt happen, you‚Äôre all talk/no walk.
I was wondering when the next time you would gain traction for something so blatantly ignorant would be. I‚Äôm not sure about Kamala Harris, but Joe Biden is Catholic (not that this should impact who you vote for in any significant way).
And here I was figuring the same racist and sexist strategy with the Biden pick of the Indian Jamaican.
No, we are voting for Joe Biden. Every ‚Äúsuburban housewife‚ÄùI know is voting  Biden/Harris. Take this ‚Äúhousewife‚Äôs‚Äù advice and start collecting boxes for your move-out in January. Because it‚Äôs coming.
I‚Äôm voting for Biden and Harris obviously but it‚Äôs crazy for me to look at all these blue check marks who absolutely Shat on Biden and Harris both suddenly talking about them like the greatest thing ever. Tons of instances of this, that‚Äôs politics for you though
His statement digs deeper than just Catholicism. Tobin and Biden are both  Irish Catholics (as am I). To infer Biden is not Catholic is a slur - an insult.  It is rooted in the subjugation, suffering and death of Irish Catholic ancestry because of their religion.
Ever notice that Trump's campaign ads always feature Biden and now Harris?  Yet, Biden talks only about solutions and bringing the country together. Never mentions the Clown in the White House.... CLASS ACT #BidenHarris2020
MORE votes for Biden. Harris! Trump keeps hitting,his own voter groups!
was sn  patsy.  Biden VP pick: Susan Rice, the diplomat and lightning rod
Biden is in a state of grave public sin and he‚Äôs unrepentant. I encourage you to ask him to repent as well. We want to be consistent don‚Äôt we?
I have done and will continue to do quite a lot to forward my radical leftist agenda, and voting for Biden/Harris won‚Äôt be one of them. But I‚Äôm still gonna vote for ‚Äòem.
Because Biden may not make it four years and then she‚Äôs President? Seems like a good decision by her.
Omg the desperation of MAGA with their nonsense. If you really cared or had any issue with abuses of power, you‚Äôd be actively working to elect Biden/Harris and get this traitorous mass murdering lunatic out of office:
Y‚Äôalllllllll Taylor is excited about Kamala as the running mate because guess what, it‚Äôs better than Trump. Is Biden/Kamala are NOT the ideal candidates but let me tell you, it has to be better than what we‚Äôre dealing with. Plus, the first WOMAN VP, and a POC, this is exciting.
This statement digs deeper than just Catholicism. Tobin and Biden are both  Irish Catholics (as am I). To infer Biden is not Catholic is a slur - an insult.  It is rooted in the subjugation, suffering and death of Irish Catholic ancestry because of their religion.
If they did, I definitely wouldn't be voting for Biden, I'd be voting for Howie, or Jesse (though he would definitely need to apologize to the LGBT+ community for Predator)
The best part of Biden‚Äôs VP pick is that we get the brilliant  back on  this fall. I‚Äôll vote for that!
Joe Biden is Catholic. What even is this tweet?
Quite frankly it‚Äôs the most racist thing he‚Äôs done.....oh wait ....no him telling people they are black if they don‚Äôt vote for him was .... he‚Äôs a disgrace.....did anyone tell Biden who his VP running mate is.... he will forget by the morning üôÑ
There's something hilarious about Biden's VP pick saying she believes the women that say he sexually assaulted them.
Totally understand that. No one's perfect. I hope I have to reconcile my picks for a Biden administration but we're not there yet.
Yes thank you I would like to order a Biden/Harris baby please?   #BidenHarris2020
Yeah he pretty much had that demo locked up...  Back up though, Democrats picked BIDEN for the black vote.  Sanders or Warren are too progressive and don't connect with black voters.
James ‚ÄúKamala‚Äù Harris formerly of the WWE recently past...Kamala Harris is now running as VP with Joe Biden days later....2020....can‚Äôt make this up ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§£ #KamalaHarris #kamala #wwe
Joe Biden/Kamala Harris President/Vice President ticket is formidable. Let's hope and work for a free and fair election. Election cheating is un-American and anti-Democratic. We have an opportunity to clean up the American virus that is the Trump presidency...with Clorox Bleach
Is it racist and sexist to choose a VP based on race and sex?
I want one with Biden Harris on it
Won't be surprised if DJT drops Pence for Haley. Won't make any difference. Biden-Harris for the win!
It took 20 minutes for Trump to respond to the announcement of  as Biden‚Äôs VP with a racist propaganda video of complete lies. Obviously they had this ready to go. They are going to lose and they know it. #BidenHarris2020
You can already feel the excitement building for the Biden-Harris ticket. Finally hope arrives!
Joe Biden picks Kamala Harris as President!!
So it‚Äôs Biden/Harris against Trump/Pence  So nothing‚Äôs changing. Got it.
Joe Biden sandbagging the election
YES JOE YES DAMMIT YESSSS #RidinWithBiden
i knew Joe Biden would pick Kamala Harris. üåö
Kamala Harris? Biden really didn‚Äôt have much of a choice. Is he going to get the Progressive vote with this pick? #2020Election #Trump2020Landslide
Boy biden thinks because he picks a black woman that now he will get all of the black people to vote for him well he is going to be very disappointed trump in a landslide.
Oh I see biden is thinking because Harris is black he will get all the black peoples votes wrong!!! Haha trump is going to demolish them.
So proud of u Kamala Harris Is Biden‚Äôs Choice for Vice President
Biden/ Harris to the finish line
Honestly, I realize the media need drama, and the campaign itself tried to inject mystery into the process, but I DON'T CARE. Any of them. Harris, Rice, Demings, etc. All good. The important thing is: vote for Biden and get that miscreant out of there. ASAP.
I have a feeling Biden's VP will be Warren ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
I'm so not joking that I don't see how it could be meant to be funny. Biden, Harris, and HRC are right-of-center.
Jillian the new idiot on fox outnumbered I think her two parents were astronauts maybe she‚Äôs from Mars because she‚Äôs absolutely clueless Bernie said that Biden was the most progressive which means left-wing nominee whoever run for president Jillian the new idiot on fox outnumbere
Joe Biden is no more senile than Trump(age 74).   Trump already slurs his words. Physically is very bad shape, diet is Wendy‚Äôs. Father had Alz.
And how can Mr. Biden claim to protect Medicare and ObamaCare when he avoided more than $500,000 in taxes that fund the two programs?
As long as   CONTINUE to show his fucking "new" rallies every day, there will be believers!  WHEN DO THEY PUT A BIDEN CLIP ON?  I GET  BUT NOT  !  Shut him OFF!
Yes. Biden is fit to be President in every way. Trump is unfit to be President in every way. And mass murdering your constituents for your own misconceived political gain is just about the most disqualifying thing in the fucking universe. We will not mourn the loss of the
Hot seat: Joe Biden
Well, future President Biden: Let‚Äôs give some serious consideration to eliminating the WEP provision to help a retired teacher like myself live with dignity.  Governor Raimondo of RI dropped our cost of living increases 11 years ago and we are hurting.  We earned SS but get 30% .
The only purpose of  and  is to have Trump push his debunked conspiracy theories about Obama and Biden. He can say they were ‚Äúcaught red handed spying on his campaign‚Äù a million times and it will never be true. This is Russian propaganda
Trump continues to accuse Biden of staying in his basement.  Lies about health care which he has never introduced.  Bypasses Congress on unemployment checks, lies about virus getting less invasive, lies about the polls going down for him with his typical glib tongue.
Did you really ask ON TV if there is a media outlet dedicated to attacking Trump the way media outfits are attacking Biden?  what are you on, cause I need some of that! Media has been attacking Trump for the past 4years relentlessly including YOUR CNN.
Listened to some clips that make  look like a simple minded critter w/ a pea sized brain today.  has some great one liners. Did you know Joe Biden is now mentally fit because he rode a bycicle this weekend, doesn‚Äôt make sense?  any reply?
He‚Äôs too smart of a business person to invest in Biden.
DEMORAT POLITICIANS NEED TO BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE. OBAMA CLINTON AND BIDEN SHOULD ALL BE IN PRISONüëøüëøüëøüëøüëø
JOE BIDEN BEEN IN GOVERNMENT FOR 40 YEAR'S NANCY PELOSI BEEN TAKING CASH DONATIONS FROM DRUG CARTELS SINCE PABLO ESCOBARüëøüëøüëøüëø
JOE BIDEN SHOULD BE IN PRISON WITH HIS SON.  HUNTER IS A DRUG ADDICT
JOE BIDEN YOU HAVE BEEN IN POLITICS FOR 44 YEAR'S WHY HAVE YOU NEVER GONE TO PRISON?  BIDEN OBAMA CLINTON AND BUSH ARE ALL CRIMINALSüëøüëøüëø
OBAMA AND BIDEN ARE BOTH CLINTON CARTEL CRIMINALS THEY BELIEVE THEMSELVES ABOVE ALL USA LAW'S
BIDEN WHY DO YOU HATE USA CITIZENS THAT WORK AND SUPPORT THEIR FAMILIES???
JOE BIDEN DO YOU BELIEVE USA TAX DOLLARS SHOULD PAY FOR LINCOLN CENTER?  IS IT BECAUSE NANCY PELOSI'S NEICE HAS A BIG SALARY FROM LINCOLN CENTER?
Mr BIDEN YOU have been in government for 40 year's. To me you and OBAMA sold USA to DRUG AND SEX TRAFFICKING CRIMINALS from China.
100% projection.  ‚ÄúMany of Hunter Biden's loudest critics owe their own careers to their own familial connections.‚Äù
I hope Biden picks Susan Rice. She left the boys in Benghazi for dead and then lied about it on every major network. She‚Äôs up to her neck in the unmasking scandal. It would be too good to be true. Even Joe isn‚Äôt foolish enough to pick her.
Biden should channel this guy.   Who was he again?
Got a great nickname for Biden, Mr Magoo. Only problem is it might be endearing
During Biden's time in office, he allowed China to steal America's intellectual property, our innovations, and our manufacturing jobs. And now he and the left are excusing China's worldwide spread of the coronavirus. Of course, they want him: they liked a sleeping America.
I have to agree with you we spend our entire camping season in Connecticut and do drive around a lot and I have only seen 2 Biden yard signs and only 1 flag everything else I have see are trump flags they are everywhere in the upper part of the state
Took. Three courses, at Syracuse Law graduated Rutgers Law. Totally pissed off with way Biden played Senator Harris. Will be voting for Trump.
Yes they want Biden because they know they can get away with more. Trump makes them pay equally for the things they want the US to provide them
It only took a worldwide pandemic, hundreds of thousands of deaths and massive unemployment to bring the economy back to the Obama Biden high mark. üòÇ
At least give Biden equal time.
It all a the Democratic Party playing they endorsed Biden knowing he can‚Äôt do the job but they are pushing for his VP they intern will become president if they win all so they can continue to control us
Question: ImPOTUS 45 claims Obama/Biden admin so bad at handling Ebola. Can we compare US death counts?
Cold warriors Nixon and Reagan would be stunned that their party has, in just a few short decades, become an ally to the Russian intelligence apparatus.
I am not a Biden fan in the slightest. I voted for Warren with Sanders as my second choice. Other Democrats voted differently.
So u r gonna support Biden the Racist????
Joe Biden needs to denounce this behavior ASAP before he accepts the democratic nomination for president. Protect the constitution of the United States from all foreign and domestic forces.
‚ÄúNeither snow nor rain nor heat nor gloom of night -NOR ASSHOLE APPOINTEES-stays these couriers from the swift completion of their appointed rounds". VOTE BIG, VOTE BLUE

Nah. Trump- a fringe actor by any reasonable metric - is the leader and standard bearer of the right. Biden on protests: "there is no place for violence and destruction of property. Peaceful protestors should be protected and arsonists and anarchists should be prosecuted" 7/30/20
Small correction.  WHEN Biden winsüòÑ
I DON'T think it will work!! People of color see right thru this shit! Give them CREDIT! They WILL VOTE BIDEN!
