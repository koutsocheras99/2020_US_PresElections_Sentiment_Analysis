Nope. His *supporters* are poorer and less educated. Education skews left, even you must know this. Trump is not cosmopolitan in the slightest — he’s blue collar New York trying desperately to be seen as upper class, but constantly betraying his gaucherie and lack of education.
What if all the people turned in happened to be Trump supporters...
I love how trump thinks most Americans are dumb enough to believe he’s the last person Russia wants in office. #TrumpConsAmerica

Trump propaganda ads really wasting my time. You got the audacity to shove propaganda in my face, I got time to troll and be political. Smh
This sounds wrong (I posted it) even if your not American. Every human being deserves life, equality, liberty and freedom to live your best life.  I don’t get were this president feels like if your not Orange your not worthy. F Trump.
His supporters probably think we are the ones mispronouncing Thailand and trump’s “Thighland” is correct. Too bad #TrumpHasNoPlan and 160,000 people are dead.

U.S. Intelligence: GOP Is Accepting Russian Help for Trump.   What a headline
Since when did Donald Trump feel obligated to follow the law.  Clearly those other rich people do not either.  PRetty sad.  I would like to have their names and companies on a mug shot. Maybe some people will avoid them because they endanger others and break the law as they want.
I’m really curious, why the reluctance by president Trump to talk about hydroxychloroquine? Front line doctors swear by it! I think it’s the antidote to this lockdown. Let’s get back to life!

Well, Trump is perturbed by the Lincoln Project.
What a buffoon Trump is. He just does not believe that rules apply to him &amp; has NEVER thought that. What a difficult time this has been. He is so dismissive. He allowed those people in NJ to be at risk for COVID while breaking the law. If a political activity, NO taxpayer $$$.

Kanye West is going to end up in legal jeopardy self dealing with trump and no one will care or save him.
No - and if Trump tries to push one out early, well, I don't trust anything that Trump does.  I'm only going to trust in a vaccine where all the testing data is available for analysis and an independent group of scientific and medical experts approves of it.

We know, I don’t even listen to Donald Trump speak live, news media give it to us enough daily. He’s an abhorrent and despicable human being.
also, the trump supporters are “sign waving” outside the cap rn and I totally understand free speech but signwaving the day before the primary w/o social distancing in a state that Biden is going to win in a landslide just seems like a poor health decision
And it's very clear to me that the hatred for Trump is hatred for anyone who has the temerity to support his policies.

Hey Big Guy (Trump).  Looking in the mirror again?
He’s a touchy feelie sort of guy by all accounts. Demands constant adoration to be heard. Sort of like trump. No wonder evangelicals like him.
King of Water: Idiot #Trump brags ‘a lot of people’ thanked him for fixing showers so they have enough water - #TrumpThreatensAmerica #VoteOutTheGOP
Gen Z uses tiktok to organize and troll trump’s rally and he bans it ASAP.    Conronavirus kills thousands of Americans, and he’s continued to ignore it for about 6 months now.   His priorities are very clear; he does not care about the people of this county
A Evangelical for Trump rally makes me laugh and nauseated. Thats just a delusional and sanctioned cult of hypocrites.
Not even the trump organization.

World shares falter after Trump takes aim at China tech firms
to bypass Trump's (and GOP) bs about mail-in-voting, their best bet would be to put in the next stimulus for all states to approve "no excuse absentee voting". Trump says absentee ballots are good so they should focus on that instead of saying "mail-in-voting" all the time.
I do hope to make it to Hawaii's 9th island someday to see your show live and take a picture with you and Teller afterwards and will really be excited when it happens. While you might not believe it, President Trump has offered Federalism instead of Authoritarianism.
after listening to your last few podcasts, you seem to have become really bitter.   wrote a book called Win Bigly that talks about persuasion and the Trump election. I'd like to suggest reading it to get ideas that the NYT will not cover.
I new our shows that non-White minorities are physiologically more vulnerable to contracting the COVID-19 virus. (Not just for socioeconomic reasons.) Trump has every incentive to let the pandemic rage.
They criticized that picture of Biden praying because the Trump folks do not KNOW what praying looks like nor what it means to bow your head in quiet prayer.  Pity, all of the Trump staff who thought themselves so smart.
Wanna start a guessing game as to how many abortions Trump has paid for over the years?
A LOT of Veterans get medication thru the mail &amp; the military overseas vote absentee. This needs to be fixed ASAP. How can the GOP (Trump) say they support Veterans &amp; the military and at the same time do everything in their power to hurt them. aka #PutinsBounties #USPSsabotage

Shamefully rather than building a relationship with the Trump Administration - Hawaii's Congressional Delegation has spent the entirety of their terms running to Cable News to antagonize for attention.  Mazie even recently called Trump supporters "white supremacists".
Tyler your party decided that it would upend the nation and Impeach President Trump on a false and contrived pretext. If Democrats are worried about phone calls to Ukraine, they should probably be very concerned about Hunter Biden and his relationship to Bursima.
Tyler lead off with the unemployment claims, for someone who likes to talk infrastructure - it would be helpful to remind Hawaii that the Unemployment Claims were being run from an ancient computer system.  We'll wait for the "But Trump" spin on that.
Of course the  would print a President Trump Bashing puff piece from the newly elected Democratic Chair.  Tyler of course doesn't mention the failures of the Ige Administration and the Legislature lead by the Democratic Party.
Bungled pandemic response? CDC forecasted 2.2M deaths. Trump kept it down to 150K.  Trump is doing a spectacular job on COVID.
I can't imagine Trump in his present dilapidated state debating anyone without swearing and jeering. Mocking a stutter, possibly. Will the moderators allow this playground-bully discourse?

I think it is in really bad taste, but I think the misguided aim was to get trump to mindlessly retweet it.  I like the idea but the implementation (using Jon Benet) was REALLY bad.
In my wildest dreams  I cannot imagine a voter saying, “Wow! That Kanye West will be my choice instead of Biden!” The opposite might happen, they might leave trump and switch to KW.
Please step aside so a healthy candidate can beat Trump. Please retire with dignity. Are you aware of how many major policies  are supported by a majority of Voters but YOU oppose? #MedicareForAll #GND #LivingWage #publiclyfinancedelections #GetMoneyOutOfPolitics #Bernie2020
We may not all like Joe Biden, or would have preferred to see someone else like Bernie take the democratic nomination, but because he is our only option we need to vote for him. Don't let your voice be silent even when Trump tries to slow down or criticize mail in voting. VOTE.
I don’t think trump cares or guves it any thought outside his own inner circle.

Vote for Trump if you want to keep 2A.
can’t agree more. Absolutely vitriolic garbage. But focusing on this mispronunciation at all is stupid given everything going on &amp; all the many many criticisms Trump deserves. Is this the level of discussion for next 3 months? Let’s focus on the record, ideas and rhetoric instead
Is it me, or does somethin smelly fishy here...?🤨 There aren’t enough police  to keep up with all of the crimes being committed by trump and his ass kissing boot lickers 😕
If you are pro 2A, you need to get to the polls and vote for Trump.
biden has to avoid trump and west they're both mental. tell them they can talk to a potted support plant that his staff has just so they can debate something that has a comparable mental ability.
That's another reason we must make sure we get to the polls and vote for Trump.
No, Trump doesn't want to buy "thighland." He knows it's part of Greenland. 🙃

Captivating is indeed the wrong word.  It is wrong on many fronts. America and democracy is not a game.  And to take advantage of someone not well (Already have Trump running) to try to pull away the vote.  NOT ok.
Yes, and there are Hawaiians involved with MAGA.  I am low key horrorified at how many Hawaiians are pro-Trump.  I am also horrorified that those same people don't think Trump is racist.

You may well be right. But unfortunately, we have a two-party system (that masquerades as democracy, but that’s another story). So we have two choices. Looks like one choice will be President Trump and the other choice will be former VP Biden. Roll up and choose your poison.
I would say that the Evangelicals changed their beliefs to accept Trump as their Messiah. Nothing about the Evangelicals relationship with Trump can be considered Christian as far as I'm concerned. They have allowed the ignorant and unstable person that is Trump to deceive.

It's more likely that the words:  "Low water pressure"  are easy for Trump to say.   Those words are not as difficult as "Yo-Semite."    So, expect him to keep talking about the exciting topic of water pressure. 🙂

Not really, AMLO has always been a coward. When he didn’t concede losing the presidency the first time, and declared himself President of Mexico, it was very clear that this man is all gimmicks and theatrics. He’s cut from the same cloth as Trump; no substance, awful leadership.

Did Trump just say he is God, did he just refer to himself as God. In his mind Joe is hurting him and by doing so like he Trump said he is the chosen one, he thinks he is God going by that reference.
A good time to retweet this.  Trump, *Mr. Religious* himself! ⬇️
I think the God he Trump is talk about is trump the God but not the God we believe in. So when he says Joe is hurting God, in his mind he saying Joe is hurting him and that should worry any normal person.

you're either voting for biden or trump. write-ins, &amp; "votes of conscience" are votes for 4 more years of trump, 1 or 2 of which will still be a global pandemic. "principled" votes get the country more Trump &amp; more dead Americans. that alone is moral reasoning to vote

It’s August 6th a once again Suzy is the most uninformed person next to the president as more republicans vote by mail then Democrats , according to trump it’s OK in red states I like when his son-in-law Kushner cut cove it to blue states because they don’t support the president
So you identify with the Trump type of Republican. That's a whole other issue McCain.your father didn't even identify with a Trump type of Republican, he did not see Trump as a republican he saw Trump as trouble.
trump is the consummate con man. Its human nature.  He promised quick, easy fixes for everything and they fell for it  I applaud them for waking up and hope they will vote for #Biden so we can fix this latest disaster created by the  (remember the mess Bush left?)
Trump and sycophant #republicans seemingly will show more outrage for pro life initiatives #gunrights than worrying about millions of Americans unemployed, those not receiving extended assistance or benefits, being tested for COVID19 or more seriously dying from the pandemic.
I can only assume he got the nom due to all the ex GOP that fled that party after Trump. Between them and the Dem dinosaurs that can only imagine cis men as president this is what we got.

A Question That Won’t Go Away:   Why Does Trump Love Putin So Much?   #PutinsPuppet
"The president hasn’t admitted publicly that he’s losing, of course. That sort of honesty—acknowledging that he might be anything other than a winner or a 'killer'—is too much of a humiliation for him,"  and  write:
What if Trump was still in office when this Covid hit?  He would've had his CDC in place in the US and around the world.  Bet he would've handled it so much better than Trump has.
Obama served 2 full terms.  If he could've served 3, Trump wouldn't even have a chance.  Imagine how much better Obama would've handled Covid compared to DumpTrump
If that’s early on-set, Trump appearances must look like a daily exhibition of Lewy bodies...

So act like it. You and Trump have been ignoring it and the plan has been to hope it "magically" disappears.

Want to guarantee a Biden win? Have him debate trump, but the rules say that if one interrupts the other, their time starts over from the beginning. Trump could never, ever shut up long enough for Joe to make a statement. It would turn into a two hour Biden rally.
Every incumbent, except for maybe Trump, plans in case they win re-election. The topic of convo is missile defense. Both Russian and US has election years that year. What’s being conveyed is a truism, that the tense issue would be easier to navigate politically after election.
I think one strategic debate will cement anyone on the fence as long as Biden allows trump to ramble on in his typical stupid fashion. He just needs to stand there shaking his head &amp; smiling, then give a powerful statement on his own beliefs and policies. trump buries himself.

Trump hasn't significantly changed our foreign policy but he did totally screw up the COVID response.
Captures the Trump presidency in a nutshell...
The Trump family is a family of heroes. 💕💕💕👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
By the time he (hopefully) leaves office in January of 2021 there will be approximately 1/4 million Americans dead by COVID-19. Trump not only ignored the problem but actively made it worse for political gain. Trump is guilty of crimes against humanity.
Cc all those people still making excuses for Trump’s COVID record on testing...
So let trump try that anyway &amp; then NY state AG or Manhattan DA take him down.
the trump administration is not deporting children...it is instead expelling them — without a judge’s ruling and after only a cursory government screening and no access to social workers or lawyers, sometimes not even their family, while in U.S. custody.
Trump recklessly makes things up because his brain does that.  Trump is a danger to this nation.
The vast majority of first-generation immigrants are far more loyal to the people of America than fucking looters and sellouts like Trump and McConnell.
I'm pretty sure he's building his cabinet now. Unlike Trump, he has a very proactive team.  I would go so far as to say they are writing up a stack of Executive Orders for him to sign on day 1 of his presidency that will reverse every stupid Trump policy ever enacted.
A friend told me everything Trump tweets is really a code. My friend would rather believe Trump is up to something nefarious and clandestine rather than he is just needlessly repetitive, negative and inaccurate. For me, it’s a toss up

It's absolutely ridiculous that Trump has to read words like "and" "the" &amp; "is". He cannot formulate one sentence on his own and must always read a script that someone else wrote!! He is a certified idiot who cannot pronounce #yosemite Smdh... #YoSemites #TrumpIsALaughingStock
Even if Trump tries to delay the election results, we can have Acting President Nancy Pelosi take charge on January 20, 2021 so I'm good with taking all the time we need to count every ballot after the November election takes place. Delay away Trump. #20thAmendment

Intel according to Trump. I would think the humanitarian thing to do with see what kind of help that could be offered. And this time I’m not sure if there is much help when in America people are dying and can get no help Trump has made this sad state affairs.

Better that he keeps that name out of his mouth. We know he has no respect for anyone but himself so better just to be quiet. Representative Lewis was a force, we don’t need to ever mention him and trump in the same sentence again.
Imagine that, according to Dishonest DNC Bernie could not win THEIR INTERNALLY controlled and DISHONEST primaries. Yet, somehow, he and his supporters are a THREAT to loser BIDEN, go figure!
Biden acts like he missed his meds. His faculties are not fully functioning. That's why he is not allowing any interviews. He clearly is senile.
Perhaps Snowden is a whistleblowers on the Obama/Biden administration.  With Susan Rice chiming in against Snowden, more it makes me feel that way. Perhaps Obama wasn't fair to Snowden.

Safety? If people can go to Walmart people can vote in person and not have dead people voting for Biden in the Mail! If hundreds of democratic politicians including Nobama can pack a funeral people should be able to pack a CHURCH? HYPOCRATS
Where did you get the idea Biden wants anything to be like CA, ESP given he actually talks about what he wants to do, explicitly? (Harris is not a stand-in for CA, nor does a VP pick decide his policy decisions)

I really thought Biden was going to make Hillary Clinton his VP pick - maybe Trump will just really twist everyone's minds by firing Pence and hiring Clinton as his VP... that would be too 1984 for everyone.
You obviously haven’t been paying attention to the last 3.5 years (?)  Biden’s challenge will be *restoring* America’s credibility abroad, after repairing our own democracy. Four more years of Trump will see any US leadership replaced indefinitely.

Did Biden/Harris answer questions???
Well yeah, that's what politicians do. Are you suggesting Biden and Harris are not trying to score political points? Hey look, I didn't validate his opinion, but it is an opinion that should be discussed. Your claims of racism are absurd. Does Biden and Harris hate orange people?
For a good example of what I mean, look at Ed Markey’s latest campaign ad. He says that we will MAKE President Biden sign the Green New Deal over footage of mass protests.   That is an acceptable way to “Hold him accountable”. If you can’t do that. You’re not serious.
So if you are not prepared to do that. Then you are not allowed to say you will “Hold Biden accountable”.   Because you either don’t understand how far you have to take this to get results, or you don’t really mean it.   The least you can do is be honest.
People need to understand that there are only two ways to “Hold Biden accountable”.   1) Threaten to withhold your vote. Apparently we’ve ruled that one out because Trump genuinely needs to be destroyed as thoroughly as possible. Ok. I get that and mostly agree.
Save the world, vote for Biden.

So when is the Biden/Harris news conference with unbiased journalists??
proud of you!  Don't let that low-life get under your skin!  I have to chuckle a bit -- when dufus did that to Obama I laughed cause Obama's birth certificate looks just like mine!  Hawaii born!  You got this!  Hugs to you and President Biden and you guys stay safe!
as intelligent as white people. Something that Joe Biden believes and has said.
Wait! What! I can’t even like this😂. How do you put these 2 words together “strategic environment?  Can somebody tell me what this means! In 2021 when MrLiar is sitting in jail. I hope Biden signs an executive order to get rid of Space Force. 🤣😂🤣😂🤣
I believe the Bishops’ should refuse Biden communion for his positions on abortion. I support their speaking out on Trump. The only one left is the Pope who corrected Trump, &amp; now should set an example for all Catholics by call Biden out on his abortion position.
Lol joe Biden’s sleepy ass bout to tho. Lmfao y’all seriously delusional.
Support for Biden = Support for Abortion
Simple. Vote for Biden.
Honestly, I have a greater appreciation for Biden after reading the article.  The technocrats he is compared to do not have any real achievements to point to other than GDP and a great many failures.
"You libs support Biden because you hate Trump!" Your point? When you have such a shining example of how not to do something, it is only reasonable to contrast your choice of a nice used car with that of a burning highway wreck.

Voting is pretty simple this year. Either you vote to have a United States at all after 2020 or you vote for its destruction. Joe Biden and Kamala Harris aren't capable of destroying the US. Trump is already doing it.

First, that’s not what Biden said. Secondly, Kamala is abundantly qualified. It just so happens that she’s also black. Every candidate had his/her criteria for what they wanted in a VP. Trump chose Pence because of his religious ties does that mean so is he xenophobic? 🤔

So how does this work...didn’t Kamala call Biden a pedophile and racist in the debates. And now they’re working alongside each other? Idk man, idk.
No evidence Obama and Biden did anything to spy on the Trump campaign. No basis for the claim this is going to be a rigged election. Copy-paste, every night at 5:30.
Fact Check: At briefings, Trump is settling into a routine of false claims and exaggeration i.e., bullshit and pathological lies.
The right is screaming at the top of their lungs “Kamala this, Kamala that” like it really is going to swing someone. The only people agreeing to that are trumps fuckface base or an idiot. You may not have been for Kamala, but to not vote for Biden would be idiotic and dangerous.

My point, bad use of OT, was that if your church had a Biden who said your church is who I am, but on TV &amp; in action denies your church teaching. He has just lied about what you believe to everyone.  Your truth is weakened &amp;  won’t matter b/c people expect him to share the truth.
Prediction: this VP debate is never going to happen. With Trump way down in the polls close to Election Day, he’s not gonna let Pence make things worse. I also predict Trump will refuse to debate Biden.
R5, forget my last pt. It isn’t about what you believe, &amp; it only matters to me b/c the words he used were addressed to my Faith Community &amp; those words have value to us. If Biden would have said he is now a member of a Jesus based Church. I would pray that he finds peace there.
Not caving here. First we moved our issues in the Prinary as far as possible. Then we moved Biden as far as we could. Election time now. Then the real work starts. Accountability time. Don’t give up now we need you in the fight!
I predict we hear a lot of argumentation about the merits of Kamela and not much about Biden from here on out.  It will be very similar to how Palin was elevated to the top of the ticket by the Democrats.  I also predict attempts to cancel the presidential debates.

They were &amp; are not in charge, are they? Biden called it in the early days, that a pandemic was coming. Trump could have asked. Part of the problem is his CDC (Disease Control in that name) head was not prepared nor had experitse in that area. Trump is used to talking stuff away.

Obama and #Biden should have been a great President and VP to break the cycle of poverty for all #BlackLivesMatter. They had 8 years. We shouldn’t even be talking about it anymore. #BidenHarris2020ToSaveAmerica making same promises without details and hope everyone forgot 2008.
I was so glad CNN mentioned that. Mr Liar Forgot he was impeached for extorting Ukraine for dirt on Biden.
Joe Biden’s contribution site. Hahahaha
I’m not listening to Biden nor Kamala for the rest of my life. First of all they both lie —-second of all Biden doesn’t speak from his heart ,he speaks from pajama boy.
Great start to the Biden Harris campaign!
By picking #KamalaHarris, #Biden shows he will surround himself with smart and well-educated people in government, not with ignorant sychophants like the #Trump cabal now failing America in the White House.
I love the Biden/Kamala ticket!!!
Wasn’t it nice to hear people speak in full sentences without ten thousand lies and pieces of misinformation in a press conference! I am looking forward to this! Then they played Curtis Mayfield’s Move On Up.... Let’s move on up in 83 days! Biden/Harris! #TrumpMustGo
Says the lying fraud who fronts for #BunkerBoyTrump. When will your larded master challenge Joe Biden to a bicycle race, Kelly? Is it true you wear your cross out on top of your dres because it burns when it touches your fleash? You worship a false idol.
A vote for Kanye is a vote for Biden.
R5, for me, Biden says he is Catholic, it means something, &amp; when he can’t live it, it says something about his Faith. Do we have to accept &amp; accommodate his personal beliefs. Does your church, is that why you have many “former Catholics”, &amp; why we receive your seekers.
Biden-Harris = Lunatics! It's that simlpe!
Hey Fox News, what kind of graphic is this? Biden hasn’t even had an audience that big yet!??
MrLiar Forgot he was impeached for extorting Ukraine for dirt on Biden Kamala’s gonna chew Pence up and spit him out.
It would be great if Biden wins and the day after his inauguration he announces he’s retiring from politics. Can you imagine the videos of Republicans and Christians loosing their shit! Any thoughts?
Joe talks about hating Nazis and white supremacists. That is an original bold, brave, and exciting idea.   via
Why didn't Biden pick a more mainstream Democrat. Like that nice Joe Lieberman! 😭
Biden has been inDC 48 years and no accomplishments except enriching himself and his family
First time I’ve been ashamed of a candidate. Joe Biden.

That's the despair of a Neo-Con, a never Trumper.   knows that Jibbering-Joe will melt like cotton candy in the rain, if Biden steps on stage with
We don’t even need Russian “collusion” when we have the Democratic Party. If Biden/Harris get elected, illegals will overrun the country and we will lose America.
It’s depends on our organizing. Elections are a choice, and between who we are more likely to move Biden/Harris or Trump/Pence it’s clear.
So, your claim is that Biden &amp; the minority woman worked together out of 2 different states at different years against minorities? And the other choice is loudly racist &amp; inflammatory, actively trying to capture &amp; kill immigrants, sickening Americans bc he thinks it hurts Blue?
Only if Biden wins a bright future or look for 4 more years of cronism, dictatorship, dirtier air/water/you name it, bigotry, farmers getting $16 billion in welfare checks, tariff tax on America, it goes on and on.
I'll guarantee he's voting for Biden. And so my original comment comes full circle. Yes, the hypocrites need the truth pointed out to them.
Do we mean what Joe Biden means when he says that "poor kids can be just as smart as white kids"?
Btwn the suspense on Right over a potential viral gaffe and the sudden enthusiasm on the Left, Biden-Harris events might be a real ratings booster for networks. Maybe they’ll cover them like they did Trump. Media attention in 2016 was big reason why he won
Didn’t Obama/Biden seperate them first. Also it was shown that some of the kids and “parents” weren’t even from the same family.
I’m voting For Joe Biden and Kamala Harris  And get ready for 2024 Kamala will be the next president in 2024.
Aren't your models validated on the entire voting (and prior polling) patterns involved in the election?  It's still just one election, but it's a heck of a lot more data to validate the overall uncertainty and confidence intervals than just "Biden win Y/N?"
Your days a numbered. Biden/Harris will fucking body you and Pence.
how would it be impossible? He would've united the incredibly split party right now securing the election. I know so many real progressives that will not shake their principles and vote for Biden and a Sanders VP spot would've have shuffled so many over. Instead we get a cop
Voting for Trump OR Biden is the anthisis of conservative.
I don’t at all mean to disregard the trans community, but it’s not our job to come up with a better answer... We all know they’re both horrid options, but the reality is, if we can’t get behind Biden and Harris, we’re stuck w/ Trump &amp; he surely isn’t better for their community...
Democrats want a black on the ticket for shared identity &amp; shared history with descendants of former slaves &amp; victims. But Kamala Harris' ancestors were slave holders. And Biden shows a history of racist attitudes.
We'll be streaming their first appearance on our Facebook and on
the statement was hypothetical no shit he would never pick Bernie. I never suspended a single percent of my belief to think Biden would ever do something as smart as picking Bernie as VP and uniting the party
Speaking of morally reprehensible: Biden and Trump.   You should have been raised to demand better standards and that character in a president matters.
And what an INSULT to Biden.  Who is Bishop Tobin anyway?
Hillary shows such generosity and patriotism in this support. Imagine this from our Nasty Greedy Buffoon of a president? His comment that he does not understand how Biden could choose someone who "disrespected" him in the debates is such a clear view of his own narcissism.

He's terrified because VP Biden has shown that you don't have to stand in front of a camera telling lies and mocking people in order to get things done.
Not for me l not that stupid to vote for that ticket cause it sucks and knowing the Democrats they up to no good Biden will not be president cause his been used.
Get ready for petulant Trump to punish America if Biden wins
Biden wasn't fired up in his first 46 years in elected office? No wonder he hasn't accomplished anything.
You can’t honestly say Biden is gonna do any better as a president? As much as I don’t care for Trump, I reeeeeeally don’t care for Biden. I also keep thinking of those creepy videos of him and little girls that were posted everywhere. I can’t.
Beware of those who call Catholic Faith their foundation while making &amp; professing their own changes. It is now Biden’s Adjusted Catholic Faith. Not the Truth!
I couldn't love &amp; admire  more,  but those expressing disappointment at the Biden/Harris ticket aren't true progressives. They are  revealing a rather nasty implicit prejudice. She herself is all in for real change not fantasies.
Republican spoiler, apparently
I hope that won’t happen in the US: trump getting 80% and Biden 10%. We would not be able to let that go!
if I know, then you know that Joe Biden and Kamala Harris will not be the ticket you ultimately run against.
Biden and Harris both lost big in previous primary runs for president. You can't have a winning ticket composed of two losers. 😎
Good point. We have plentiful evidence of 45's inability to speak coherently. 45 should have to present his platform and be compared to Biden's though, instead of just the name-calling nonsense he is engaging in now.
Trump lobs racist — and misspelled — attack against Joe Biden and Cory Booker – Raw Story
Biden and Harris both lost big in previous primaries to run for president. How is this a winning ticket? You gotta win to win . 😎
This definitely bodes well for an FDR-like presidency, what with Biden's own support among the plutocrats. Even if they welcomed Wall Street's hatred, Wall Street is evidently unwilling to provide it.
Dems so desperate, they are blaming the China virus on Trump.  Biden needs a caretaker.
Who here said I was giving up. I’m not allowed to give up. My fellow islanders are going to be underwater within my lifetime.   Biden robbed us our last chance to save their homes. Now the best we can do is help them relocate when it happens.

It doesn't matter Biden will end up like Hillary cause Obama was the last President the democrat ever had it over for them the country is on our children money future and are broke.
I’m going to be very clear about this. Do I support Biden as president? No. Do I support Kamala? Not really. Will I be voting for them come November... Hell fucking yes I will. A NON VOTE IS A VOTE FOR TRUMP. UTILIZE YOUR FUCKING RIGHT TO VOTE.
What Republicans still don't understand about the never-Trump movement
Do you think 45 will debate Biden? Can he actually do it and not come away looking like a complete fool?
Everyone in America probably said Biden is hiding. So you say hidden Biden and you really think that’s impressive? I’m more concerned that you have been babbling with Biden in the basement too. And I’ve been one of your biggest fans since the famous commonwealth speech.
Saw a Bernie tweet criticizing the traitor. Then saw a Bernie Bro response criticizing Bernie for not saying the same thing about Biden/Harris.  Bros gonna Bro.
Inside Joe Biden’s search for a running mate
The same thing happened when Biden was running against Obama.
Just a cowardly way of admitting that Trump would destroy Biden in a debate and the world would see that Joe is unfit to hold any office! You'er pathetic! You will do anything and vote for anyone against  . Sold your soul!!!!!!
Did CNN just imply that Biden isn’t fit?
Nina, is there really no hope left for Bernie/Lee in 2020? I just hate the Biden/Harris option. I was still hanging on to hope for our revolution ❣️What are you advising Progressives do? Not vote? Vote Green? Write in Bernie/Lee? I’m asking you cuz I trust you won’t vote shame☮️
Discrediting Kamala to weaken her popularity amongst blacks. ‘B’ will be to give Trump the ‘playbook’ on how to draw blacks away from Biden’s campaign. ‘C’ will be to convince young blacks not to vote at all. Watch!
Where do you think Biden is getting all his funding? Now with Kamala in place, watch how they annihilate Trump. They’re going to go into campaign overdrive with Kamala doing most of the leg work. That and massive amts. of security for Kamala will be $$$.
Harris rivalled Biden a racist,  said she would round up Trump supporters,  go after guns,  added time to sentences for blacks as DA,  You folks would vote for Manson just to see Trump lose.  Your hatred for this country is so deep you can't even see it.

Kamala Harris will support Biden’s policies as his VP so you don’t have your facts right on her position. She is not a fringe left wing candidate so stop posting false claims about her record.
Look on the bright side. 4 years of watching the country continue its decline under Biden might poison anyone associated with the administration.
Listen, Kamala was hard on Biden in the debates, but she's a strong women who knows her sh*t and they can both put it all aside for the betterment of our country. Woman and black VP! Biden rocks for putting the people first!

Bring it on cause if Kamala Harris attacks the President on her own that only shows that Biden has a dementia problem and also that give the president every right to attack Biden when Kamala makes common cause she not running for President it B himself.
Why can't Biden run for President?
Can't Biden?
Why not the Presidential candid Biden?  What is wrong with him running for the job he wants?

all in for Harris/Biden!
I’m happy for new representation in the VP. To be honest though her policy sucks. It’s no better than Biden’s. I feel strongly about Bernie but it wasn’t meant to be, Warren was completely beaten...but endorsed centrist after slandering Bernie. Tulsi pretty much republican. (1/2)
Biden. Not cuz I like Biden, but I think he wouldn't ruin America any more further than trump would if he were to be reelected.
You know this is just an editing trick to make Biden look unprepared; each cut is done to make his answers look choppy.   That’s not the actual producer that you hear on the video! This is all done to reinforce your biases. Be smarter about what you’re hearing &amp; seeing!

What do you think Trump needs in front of him to sound coherent? It’s a teleprompter.   And even with it, he cannot pronounce words like Yosemite and statistics. Without a teleprompter, he a rambling word salad of ineptitude.   Biden’s a genius in comparison.

You realize that this isn’t a real news story, don’t you? Biden has done plenty of interviews outside of his basement; they just aren’t shown on Fox News.    Biden was bicycle riding this weekend. I doubt Trump can even ride a bike. He’s more the golf cart type.

Democrats have a moral dilemma in the General Election - Kamala Harris attacked Biden's character - said Biden was everything the Democrats stand against - now she's his VP?  Kamala only stands for personal ambition, and Biden just tried to buy cheap moral cover.
Organize with us. We aren’t cashing in all our chips in elections. Elections are simply choices, the best was Bernie, now it’s Biden. Because we can move Biden on our issues more than Trump. The point is to keep organizing and not counting on politicians as saviors
Biden said bad things about Obama during his campaign before he became VP
Scary thing is, Biden and Harris could be Dems’ best..all they’ve got?
I wonder if Biden remembers who Kamala Harris is??!!
all this talk I’m seeing about how horrendous Biden &amp; Harris are is unfortunately starting to make me strongly believe we have to deal w/ that monster for ANOTHER 4 years and it ~truly~ makes me want to die
Obama used drones considerably more than Bush. Just imagine how many drones Biden-Harris will use if the progression continues
I've wondered about this quite a bit, including how (if at all) she impacts health policy as Biden's VP. Her proposal was unique, falling somewhere between ACA expansion + public option &amp; pure M4A. Was this driven by political strategy, ideology, or some combination thereof?
Republicans are jumping for JOY!  She is Soooo narrowly focused on just one segment of our citizenry. If she and Biden should win, GOODBYE LGBTQ dignity. But she’ll never take our pride. #kamala #lgbtq #TRUMP #Biden #gay
So identify with her personal story. 😭 grateful for my own strong immigrant Asian American mom who raised us. Ecstatic that Biden chose supremely competent   #BidenHarris2020
Pro-Life Leaders Say Biden-Harris ‘Most Pro-Abortion Presidential Ticket in History’
Just goes to support the notion that the DNC would rather lose to Trump than push for a winning ticket that would be beneficial to the American people and the party. Especially likely given the anal tearing Biden &amp; Harris gave each other
No true Catholic could ever vote for Biden.
Set up a few ramps Biden can walk down while the Stupident tries to talk
When Kamala Harris attack the president he needs to address it to Biden and not her cause she not running for the president office that way it gives the president more ammo to attack Biden.
And Biden had to be stupid to pick her cause she called him Racist and he turns around and submits to her Vomit.
why does joe biden look like gold member lmao I’m too stoned for this
Biden is a war criminal. He and Obama dropped 26000 bombs on 7 countries. Have a good evening.
For the record. This is a unifying act in the #Democratic Party and by #Biden, and I appreciate that #Bernie did not hesitate to publicly congratulate this choice.
As Kamala Harris is poised to make history As Joe Biden's Vice Presidential Pick, It's a good time to go back  And read my blog piece about her at   Don't say I didn't warn you.
I’m not so good with songs or lyrics. But you are awesomely amazing. We need a happy song for Biden and Harris
While her advice was thoughtful, the two are nothing alike. The difference is McCain didn’t need her, Biden does need Kamala; also Kamala is smart, Palin is not!
God bless you and Joe Biden. As a retired career military officer (28 years), I am looking forward to the return of mature, responsible, and morally committed, global leadership. You have my vote and energy toward ensuring your victory on 3 Nov!

Resolved: The Illuminati forced Biden to choose Kamala because they want Trump to win reelection.  #BidenHarris2020
The fight is between trump and kamala. We know biden won’t last.
Here’s my post from two weeks ago.  “No matter who Biden picks for VP, the Republicans will immediately declare she is the most corrupt, incompetent, unintelligent, unqualified, ugly, foreign, sicky, crippled, deformed, mentally ill, depraved, imbecilic pick ....”.  As predicted.
trying to get left leaning / democratic voters to vote for biden harris is like manray trying time convince patrick that the wallet is his.. yall dumb!
And? When Biden and Harris inevitably deploy the police state on The oppressed peoples of this nation will you stand with us then?   Because that’s what scares me more than anything. People who just hate trump go back to sleep and leave us out to die.
I also remember how horrible she was to justice Cavanaugh. That will never be forgotten nor can it be forgiven. Joe Biden did even worse to Justice Clarence Thomas which will never be forgotten or forgiven.
Biden has a racism problem.
Biden should make ads about this:
BERNIE VP WOULDVE MADE ME BEND THE KNEE AND VOTE FOR BIDEN AND SUSPEND MY LAST BIT OF CONFIDENCE IN NEO LIBERAL CORPORORTIST DEMOCRATS
Y’all complaining about Biden/Harris, I sure hope y’all are registered to vote and make your voices are heard in November, otherwise... please take a seat
A TX GOP guy so bad that my mom, who only votes pro-life and won’t vote for Biden, loathes.
Guess what I'm going to do DonnieBoi? Vote for Biden &amp; Harris. You know why? For the simple fact that they aren't you. *kisses*
Serious question - how soon after the inauguration can Biden resign and give Presidency to Harris?
Having a VP candidate who got her start in politics on her back and a Joe Biden who has spent his adult life in politics with absolutely NO ACCOMPLISHMENTS means that this is the best the Democrats have to offer.  How pathetic is the Democrat party!!  Liberal tears by the gallon.
We are witnessing history being made with  being chosen for Biden’s VP. First black woman and first Asian American on a presidential ticket. This selection gives me faith in America.
How is the former incorrect? Biden, if elected will usher in radical leftism when Harris takes over because Biden dies, or continues his descent into dementia.
Guys if every single one of us don’t vote Biden nor trump can win
Biden/Harris. We need someone who:  - has read at least one book in their life - who can form complete sentences - who cares to educate himself when necessary - gives a damn about something other than himself  This is an existential election for America
So you got two people who were most likely never going to vote for Biden to not vote for Biden? You must be as good of a conversationalist as the President
Any word from Biden or Harris denouncing rioting, looting, and mayhem in our big Democrat run cities? I’ll wait.
So you're telling me you'd vote for joe Biden after he taken a train and eaten it piece by piece AFTER derailing it with his penis???
Speak Out After Joe Biden Outed SEAL Team 6 - Billy and Karen Vaughn  via   How can he be that stupid?!  How can he be the president?!
VP picks are typically nonentities on political ambition (e.g. Tim Kaine, Mike Pence). So Biden showed guts by picking Kamala Harris. Given the GOP has had a year for oppo research, their early responses are almost randomly unfocused. #Election2020
I'm not saddened by Bernie taking the high road in endorsing Joe Biden's campaign but I wish the majority of us didn't depend on FOX or CNN for our news so we aren't restricted to two parties in November. A lot of people have creative ideas that don't fit a corporate narrative.
Biden may be the "lesser of two evils" when it comes to the majority of America's ideals, but he and his VP have contributed to systematic racism two decades ago and I can't support that.
I reserve the right to be wrong, but I refuse to vote for Joe Biden or Donald Trump. I hope to write in my vote, knowing that the person I choose won't win but also knowing that I did not contribute to the scary America that either candidate may create.
This comes from Trump's former campaign manager, after Tulsa still inexplicably in some position, however.  Would you expect to see this sort of foul thing coming from the Biden campaign staff?  I think and sure hope the perpetrator would be fired.
So when is your Larded Master #TraitorTrump going to challenge Joe Biden to a bicycle race? He’s already beaten #PutinsPuppet in the West Point ramp run. You’ve had months to prep for this moment and this is the best you got? Weak sauce, dude.
It was Kamalaed by Uncle Joe Biden
Wow thnx I didn't know about LaRiva and there's no way I'm voting for Trump or Biden
Wow, you heard It right from Biden and you still won’t believe?
Understood. Please watch that debate before you start arguing.  Besides, Harris would be a better presidential nominee than Biden. Not sure what Dems we’re thinking when they pushed him through. Maybe 2024 will be the year 🤙🏼
Yeah, and even she has a problem Biden

The ol’ Rope a Dope is driving you all crazy isn’t it. No need to come out, just let  continue to earn Biden votes every time he opens his mouth and lets his stoned mind free to ramble! Go on, Representative, you were saying?
I'd love to hear any insights you may have gleaned during your journey of discovery, seriously.
#KamalaHarrisForVP LOLOL 😂 Truly hilarious! But, then again what does the VP really do? I don’t know anyone who wants #Biden for  let alone  I may be convinced, Jesus really is coming this time. #endoftheworld
Please share the secrets once you achieve enlightenment.😉
Harris's health plan resembled the existing Medicare program (FFS + MA), but w/ add'l reforms.   A tenable middle-ground for democrats: pragmatic &amp; ambitious. Biden-Sanders unity plan feels similar, but takes a different financing pathway to UHC.  All theoretical w/o Congress.
Kamala Harris wasn't my first choice. I was hoping for Karen Bass or Stacy Abrams. But this is still historic:  BIPOC women have often been called the backbone of the Democratic Party. It's long past time to start calling them leaders. #KamalaHarris
I think Biden tryna smash
And I thought the fact she slept her way into public office as bad - Harris, as Biden’s VP pick, likely to face renewed scrutiny about prosecutor past  #FoxNews
Moved me from “Of course I’ll vote for Biden” to “I’m THRILLED to vote for Biden/Harris.”
Why? Biden wins California  without Harris. This is a stupid decision.
I remember this from the debates. Good thing Biden didn’t pick Tulsi, she is much more likable.
Need a Kamala Wonder Woman to pair with Biden Superman...🤣🤣🤣
Honest question - how soon after inauguration can Biden resign presidency to Harris?
damn i think i dislike Joe Biden more after he announced his VP pick... smh
This IG is literally how I feel about the Biden Harris partnership 😭😭
I hate Joe Biden and I hate Kamala Harris but I’ll be damned if I’m voting for anyone either than them. Lesser of two evils.
Try search “Joe Biden has dementia” on DuckDuckGo and Google. Google removed the search suggestion 🤭
I’m supportive of Biden and Harris. This is a good choice. I love Warren and I love Harris!! Let’s do this. I’m so excited!!! I believe in you.
Google has removed the search suggestion for “Joe Biden has dementia”. See the difference between google and DuckDuckGo. Try it yourself.
Warren is still in office. She will be a valuable member the whole way. She is out star where she is. It’s going to be good. Her voice is valued and heard by Biden and Harris.
Perfect match...(a sniffer + a b_ _ _ _ _)🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
From your lips to gods ears ! BIDEN HARRIS 2020 💙💙💙
Lol of course not. Biden’s cabinet is going to be a voltron if awfulness.   All I’m hoping for right now is that Bezos doesn’t get Sec of Commerce and Buttigieg doesn’t get Sec of Defense.
NO! Pls tell me y’all not really voting for Biden. The one who said “you’re not black if you don’t vote for me” the one who has over and over again been shown harassing women and children. Nah, go write another shitty song T Swift
That sucks...
It’s the stupid theory Biden’s old white guy advisors have been spewing in their attempt to keep Kamala off the ticket. Joe Biden just provided proof of his competence by ignoring them.
You guys are twisting yourselves into pretzels trying to paint Biden and Harris as radical left Marxists... it's very amusing! #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica2020
How Joe Biden looked whe he found out she said yes.
Joe Biden has never looked better
He is making fun of Biden and Kamala
I was referring in my tweet to Rep Doug Collins who was mocking Biden and Kamala
Three Presidential debates. Let America see the 2020 Joe Biden.
I think something nefarious will happen to Biden before the election and will b blamed on a trump supporter. And kamala will b the candidate
a Biden presidency is going to be a throw back to the G.W. days of political commentary, if we’re all still alive yee haaaw
Now that Biden has made his pick for VP, I need him to stay in the basement &amp; keep that same energy he been had... silence. 🇺🇸
Harris makes me excited. Biden alone was OK. Incomparably better than the current occupant, of course, but old white guy. The addition of Kamala Harris kicks me into actual excitement. I think she’ll challenge Biden where he needs to be challenged, and I think he’ll listen.
They'd have a problem with Sheldon Adelson if Biden picked him as veep.
None of us are perfect. The defects in Biden and Harris are not unique. But Biden and Harris are sure as hell way better than Trump and all his puppets.🙂😃🤪😂
So Biden selected Kamala Harris how predictable
Now let’s see what the snakes pull out now. Biden/Harris!
Just like with Biden, the rightwing hate media, #NaziGOP and #TraitorTrump have been desperately seeking (and failing) to come up with some legit bumper sticker meme to demean Harris. So far nothing but a string of failure.
According to GovTrack, Kamala Harris was the most liberal member of the U.S. Senate in 2019.  Even more liberal than Bernie Sanders.  The takeover of Joe Biden by the extreme left is now complete.  Link:

She’s another candidate. I would never vote democrat or republican. There is no such thing as “lesser of two evils”. I’d rather vote for the person I actually believe in and I don’t believe in creepy ass Biden.
Biden has chosen Kamala Harris; Trump and his campaign is about to go after her too. She won’t take it laying down, and the brilliant thing about it is that she has a brain. Now, let’s see how our “post racial society” rears it’s ugly head. Either way Trump needs to go...
It’s clear that most Americans dislike  #Trump.  And the #Democrats should continue to build a broad anti-Trump coalition.   But selecting #KamalaHarris speaks to another thing that #Biden has to do in order to win:  Solidify his Base.    Aloha   🇺🇸🙏🏼🤙🏼  #2020Elections  4/x
It’s pretty clear who’s going to be voting for #Trump in November, so the question that #Biden and the #Democrats needed to answer is “who will be voting for Biden in November?”   And traditionally V.P. picks are designed to answer that Q.   1/x   #2020Election  #KamalaHarris
By picking Kamala Harris, Biden chose a major LGBTQ ally &amp; a formidable warrior against the GOP
I’m voting Biden-Harris but I’m going to be complaining about it every day.
Dear  When Biden/Harris wins in November, please appoint Barbara Lee as California’s next Senator. Thank you. ❤️
I bet they will go with a token repeal like the one that Obama-Biden did when they got into office. I think 94% of those cuts were made permanent by Obama.
That’s a hard one, I do think Biden wins only because he’s been in office longer
If you believe that the only way to defeat Trump is to vote Biden (or vice versa), let me just remind you that America wasn’t always a country.
#KamalaHarris is going to emasculate  Pence   Oh wait, trump already did that   Well, she’ll kick his a** in the debate   #Biden  #BidenHarris  #BidenHarris2020Landslide
Funny the the Black Life Matter movement was born untie a Black President and under Joe Biden.
you don’t have to love her. you should absolutely hold her (and biden) accountable. but i am begging you, for the sake of literal humanity, please do not let 2016 happen again.
The USS Joe Biden sunk the stock market today by firing a Kamala Harris torpedo. Where are the best and brightest in the land? Time to step up.
Just because she had an Indian mother, does not imply she represents Indian or Hindu-American interests. In fact, she has taken anti-India position (article 370, etc) like most in the democratic party has and hope that pushes indian americans to vote against Biden.
So Joe Biden couldn't find the exit to his basement and had to announce his running mate via Twitter.  Well done Joe, well done!
Kamala is about as black as suburban democrat female voters are willing to tolerate.  Kamala was selected to appease suburban progressive female voters in battleground states. The Biden campaigned polled Karens and Karens wanted Kamala.  #BidenHarris2020
Why not? She’s electrifying, smart, quick. All the things Biden needs help on.

Biden probably forgot how evil Kamela Harris is
Because Biden doesn’t know WTF he doing anyway lol.
In nearly five decades in office, what is Joe Biden's crowning achievement?  Does he have any accomplishments?  Or only campaign promises?
Someone quick, tell Biden &amp; Harris to promise Armenian Genocide recognition so they can disappoint the Armenian community again and we can fulfill the cyclical nature of the political game. Also #StopAliyev because his pubic mustache certainly hasn't succeeded
Though Biden/Harris is a better pick than the incumbents, we still have a long way to go for progress. Not sure if this has been updated with Biden's new policy changes. Emoji marks where I scored.
I wonder if they deleted this, but I don’t think they should have made Biden and Harris look like Star Wars ghosts........
Dianne Feinstein was the most natural fit for a Biden #VPPick from a personal and ideological perspective.
Great.   Maybe now you should focus your energy on phone banking/volunteering. A Biden/Harris ticket is definitely going to need all the help it can get.....
isn’t biden against cannabis?
It's going to be "The Cop Kamala" my question is Biden/Harris going to take over the daily Law and Order tweets now?
If people actually believe Biden is leading in the polls, Biden said it himself! #Trump2020
In this instance, it's a vote for Harris to be president not Biden. He'll be guided for as long as he lasts, she and her handlers will be calling all the shots.  Gross, I need to take a Clorox shower. They're both reprehensible humans.
Biden/Harris is far from a "dream ticket" from a drug policy reform or cannabis reform perspective but a Democratic House and Senate can move them forward. #BidenHarris2020 #VPPick
Yall hate trump. Yall hate Biden . Yall dont want Kamala as VP . STFU. At this point you dont have a choice. Just dont be ignorant &amp; not vote .
Mondale/Ferraro is a more apt comparison other than the fact that they were more robustly pogressive--and that Biden/Harris have a high likelihood of winning.
The greatest trick the devil ever played was convincing the right-wing that Biden wants to defund the police when in reality he’s ultra Blue Lives Matter.
Biden picks Kamala Harris as running mate, first black woman   #HNN
Just to clarify... she was my first choice. Anyone else would be my second and third choice. I am voting Biden period. Kamala is smart and tough. Let’s get this done!
I’m 100% convinced Biden trying to lose on purpose with all the shit he be sayin
Even if the prospects aren’t that bright right now, I still implore everyone to vote this presidential election. Too many ppl used the “I’m not voting bc I don’t like either candidate” excuse last time and we got Trump so pls, vote for Biden anyway lol
#Dems chose #Harris! So its Harris vs #Trump! #Biden is just a figurehead! Biden picks Kamala Harris as VP nominee  via
Joe Biden selects California Sen. Kamala Harris as running mate via
Unlike your moron dad, Biden has picked an equal partner, not a spineless boot-licking puppet like Pence. He's not afraid of having a strong, intelligent, and qualified VP. That is the hallmark of a true leader. #BidenHarris2020Landslide
Bernie supporters, please vote Biden/Harris!
Biden really just said “Fuck it! Idc if I lose!” 😐
Senator Harris is an excellent selection for vice president. She's undeniably brilliant and tenacious and will be an important part in a Biden administration
I thought his comment that Biden's deliberative selection process helped to elevate future female stars of the Demoratic party was unusually incisive...
I’m 😕 about Biden choosing Kamala Harris as his running mate. I’m not a fan of her having supported as a prosecutor, harsh punishments for drug offenses, or of her being equivocal about it later when running for President.
The Democrats aren't sending their best!  Joe Biden &amp; Kamala Harris may be the worst Democratic duo, since Walter Mondale and Ferraro.  What a disaster for the Democratic Party!
Strongest ticket since Obama/Biden... Trump better go hide in his bunker...
Must of the people celebrate of joe Biden kamala Harris
Kamala Harris “is the first Black woman and the first person of Indian descent to be nominated for national office by a major party, and only the fourth woman in history to be chosen for one of their presidential tickets.” 🇺🇸🥳
I predicted a Biden/Harris ticket last June
So its #Harris vs #Trump. #Biden is just a figurehead!
I think it just assumes Biden doesn’t run after winning, and there are many reasons that might happen
I'm okay with Biden picking Harris. I would have preferred Warren but at least he didn't pick Clinton.
If Biden wins in November, Kamala Harris will be the highest ranking female politician in American history 🇺🇸
So glad to hear. I know Trump is awful, but Biden/Kamala is a worse choice. Picking the best of the worst.
Yes, but did you expect Biden to pick Kamala Harris???
Joe Biden is still trying to understand why the Democratic Party, chose the recently deceased professional wrestler Kamala as his running mate.  Reportedly Biden's campaign staff, is creating a "scratch &amp; sniff" explanation for Joe.
People on Twitter jumping on a Trend: “ACAB!”  Same people when Biden makes a Cop his VP: “Great Choice!”
Biden Crime Bill and his need for child pedophilia and adrenachrome
Mayor Pete, you and Chastien better get ready to move to DC to be part of the Biden Administration!!!
I'm still happy...no ones perfect in politics. You see it with Biden and everyone else but I truly believe and hope for the future and I truly believe things will be better off in the hands of these two than the shit show we are dealing with now!!!
Oh boy, so excited to vote for Biden/Harris.
BIRDS OF A FEATHER...ONE SNIFFS🤣...THE OTHER? NVM🙄 (match in hell)
I can’t wait for the VP debate. I wanted Warren, but Harris isn’t afraid to keep Biden in check when he’s a dumbass.
I'm so happy to see her join the Biden ticket... tears of joy!
Sleepy Joe Biden selects California Sen. Horizontal Harris as running mate
How will BLM supporters defend voting for Biden/Kamala? Tulsi Gabbard rips Kamala Harris' record on criminal prosecutions  via
Oooh, Biden-Harris. I can definitely get on board with that.
Republican governor in Massachusetts, she’s gotta keep her seat if Biden hopes to have a Senate majority. She’s a team player, though, she can wait
Just in...
Biden is picking Kamala...Harris...as his running mate 🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️ whyyyy
Hell froze over! Joe Biden chose VP Kamala Harris! ⁦ If you think you will be elected, do you resign to hand it over? Who paid &amp; leaned on you? ⁦⁦
Fantastic news. I look forward to her commentary on #BillBarr lawlessness in the coming weeks as she is now the #Democratic #VP pick. #KamalaHarris Is #Biden’s Choice for Vice President
Y’all bitching about Biden/Harris.. I would rather have ANYONE other than Tr*mp/P*nce
Biden/Harris sounds great to me! Are we gonna cal them Kamaloe or Joemala?  #BidenHarris2020
I’m with you Biden!   Kamala is  F I E R C E!  Let’s get to work!  🇺🇸🗳🌊
Best choice Biden could have made!
Kamala Harris is Biden's VP choice.
With fewer than 100 days until the presidential election, presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden announced Tuesday that Kamala Harris will be his running mate.
Republicans for Joe biden 😂 what an oxymoron
Remember when Kamala Harris stuck it to Biden in the debates? Well he probably remembered that, but is using it to his advantage.
That's the ticket: Joe Biden picks Sen. Kamala Harris as his 2020 vice presidential running mate  via
This choice will ensure a President Trump win in a landslide!
BREAKING:  selects California Sen.  as running mate:
JUST IN:
I’m thinking Biden will appoint many of the other candidates in his Cabinet🤞
#BREAKING: Joe Biden selects Kamala Harris as his running mate #BidenVP
They gotta show pictures of Biden with Obama just to make Biden look good. This is our election of our President. Sad.
BIDEN/HARRIS!!! Yes!!!!
Biden selects Kamala Harris as VP
KAMALA!!! This is so important. I'm so delighted. Biden/Harris 2020!!

Kamala Harris is Biden's pick for veep according to the breaking news on CNN!
Senator Kamala Harris will be Joe Biden’s running mate. 🤭🤭🤭
Kamala Harris will join Joe Biden on the Democratic Party ticket as the VP nominee to defeat Donald Trump and Mike Pence in November
Could be Biden’s pick for the VP.
I don’t even give a  _____, lets get it on. Times ticking no more Hiden Joe Biden, I’m so ready to watch the debates.
1.  Also, if they they do accused Biden of a crime, ask they why they were spying on his campaign.
We'll be safer in Biden's American than we are in Trump's America.
Both Republicans and Democrats have their share of anti-trade troglodytes. Here is how and why Biden and his party should turn that around.
Everyone knows ur attempting to help our current IMPOTUS, Kanye West, so just back off. It won’t work. On second thought, the dummies who would vote for u will actually take votes away from Trump so stay in the race. It will help Biden win.
I’m afraid Joe Biden, being only human, will not choose a former rival presidential candidate for his VP.
if biden chooses harris as his vp the white house is gonna have another trump, just as vp
i swear to god if biden chooses harris as his VP we gonna have another donald trump just in a different position of power
I’m with you Biden! ✊🗳🇺🇸
This is true. And I tend to think Biden is a less exciting candidate than Hillary was.
Can we just skip to the part were Joe Biden steps down cause he’s “sick” &amp; the Vice President who is a WOMAN, becomes president &amp; then we have a our first woman president! 🙌🏽👏🏽 I’m sick of these men
My wife, no my sister, I’m Jill Biden
, I think President Biden should choose like five vice president’s African-American, Native American, white, Latino and Asian. All women. They would kick ass
Hey Matt I now believe that Joe Biden is doing an act to avoid prison time for treason.
So, what are you all gonna do when Biden tells us his VP is Hillary?
I can't believe Biden picked Ivanka Trump as his running mate. That just seems fishy.  #bidenTrump
Biden's VP, WHO GIVES A FUCK?
the margin of error is 4.3%.... Biden has a lead but it's tight.
The likely voters was actually 50-44 for Biden in June. There is a 1 point shift towards Trump.
President Trump says Americans will have to "learn Chinese" if Joe Biden wins because "China will own the United States" if he loses.  Yet, Trump himself has declined on multiple occasions to condemn some of China's most provocative actions
Too bad Biden's VP pick has to be a token female.
At first when I read this tweet I thought “Oh, really?” and let this thought pass by. Then this early morning, I thought about this tweet. The recent past and current presidents’ faces (Bush, Obama, Trump, Biden?) ought to be sculpted in another location on Mt. Rushmore. Tourists
The media "whoever Biden's VP pick is had better brace themselves for the onslaught of racist sexism". Have they even seen this country? Do they somehow think Kamala is going to say "oh wow, I have never been treated like this before."? Give your collective heads a shake.
3 point shift my man.
Biden was up 8 points in the last poll.
Biden's token woman VP pick, being a dude who thinks he's a woman would be soo sweet right now.
Biden picks “Infrastructure Week” as VP
What did Biden do in 8 yrs as VP?   Biden is running on promises. Trump os running on accomplishments.
Biden isn’t hiding, he’s riding a bike. #TraitorTrump can barely waddle his fat ass around. Why doesn’t Trump prove how fit he is on a bike?
Joe Biden.. the feeble old man won't come out of his own basement... in that situation, Biden would have soiled and wet his Depends
This Pastor letter to a Parishioner on Biden’s move away from Catholic Beliefs speaks to the heart.  please Pray, Read And Yearn for God’s Truth on Paul’s warning of Self-Seeking Teachers in Romans 16:17-18.
Biden is going to inherit an awesome amount of power thanks to do nothing Senate.  AWESOME.  Crooks, your reign is coming slowing drifting away.
Biden is not healthy enough to be a world leader.  Maga with trump who led the American economy to greatness.
A satirical congrats to Biden’s running mate - whoever she is - from ⁦ “you have, oh, about five minutes before the garbage starts raining down upon you.” But, srsly, these women are already heroes &amp; any one of them can withstand Trump.
When he mentioned that Biden choosing Susan Rice could be a "liability", this is probably telling us that Karen Bass looks like a "safer" choice. Sleepy Joe is SINKING! 😂
Well of course it’s to help Biden. Hillary has destroyed the #Democrats Party and cities and doesn’t seem bothered by it. She is psycho as are you.  It’s so obvious Hillary is choosing the VP and is pressuring mayors and governors. You two intend to fk the USA.
BREAKING NEWS: Joe Biden announces his VP will be Selina Meyer
Will Joe Biden have to join her in exile should he win our election?
If she doesn't get picked, they 100% will.   They were leaping up and down when she dunked on him in the first debate. They only like Biden because he's a short cut to get national attention and become the frontrunner in 2024.  You know... without having to do any real work -.-
A quote from a member of a discord server I'm in:  "biden the senile degenerating degenerate."  nailed it. #Trump2020Landslide #WellSaid
If biden has michelle obama as his vp i think he may coincidentally pass away while in office and the obamas will be back in charge #StayWoke
I punch Joe Biden
I think checking followers counts on twitter gives you an idea of Biden’s chances .  Hillary has 28 million followers and got slaughtered by trump .  Biden has 8 million . Trump has almost 85 million
Dr. Jill Biden explains why she won't call President Trump names: 'I won't stoop to that'
when Kanye says he’s only running to hurt Biden (help Trump) vs when Kanye says “you know how many girls I took to the titty shop”
Biden bringing the gun show !
Why would l vote for Biden! Cause Obama say so! To me Obama himself not in his right mind.
Joe Biden said that he will defeat Joe Biden in November.  Joe Biden needs to be in a home.  His supporters need to ask themselves why they are so desperate to back Joe Biden.  Look at his record and listen to his words.  Joe Biden represents dementia ..  Democrats are pathetic.
Tucker rips lack of coverage of DC mass shooting, claims media silent to help Biden campaign
Anybody who thinks Biden's mental state makes him unfit to run has to explain why this guy's doesn't: #Election2020
Is it just me or is this really creepy?
Mayor Pete is trending.  Biden isn't that stupid... is he?
Who is Biden’s running mate?
And? Bring in 10 DEBATES  with POTUS  then! That'll  test his mental health...🙄
Who believes that Biden VP pick will be Michelle Obama?
is not big on the Biden
I agree. Perhaps because Biden lost his son, I believe that his preference would be for a young man who could be a surrogate son and protege.
Biden needs to make a decision ASAP so supporters can get behind the ticket.  We need an announcement now to generate momentum!  Do it Biden!  🇺🇸
I love how he says “Biden is not all there” as if to suggest Dump is playing with a full deck. 😂😂😂😂 he must’ve gotten a good penny for this interview.
Looks like it’s Mayor Pete for Biden’s VP nominee?
My bet is something nefarious happens to Biden and it’s blamed on a trump supporter so now everyone will rally around the dems
“Joe Biden debate 2020 “”Joe Biden debate 2020”DEBATE VP “joe Biden 🙉🙊🙈🤥🤔🤥-DEBATE “ President Donald J Trump win guarantee against “sleepy Joe Biden”biden hiding inside his bunker can answer questions correctly can’t remember his wife can’t remember what state he’s in🙊🙉🙈

Idk who joe Biden going pick of his vp president
He's also claiming that one historical event (The 1918 pandemic) that preceded the other (the end of World War II in 1945) ended the second one that it had nothing to do with at all.  And Trump is questioning Joe Biden's cognitive abilities? LOL!!!!!

Bringing class and brains back to the White House. Will they remove the stripper pole when the Biden’s move in?
I don't care who the veep is (prefer Harris, though), and I will vote for Biden no matter what in order to get rid of Trump. There is nothing more important than removing Trump from office, especially since it'll keep him from killing more people through his coronavirus bungling.
They better save it for some woke/progressive Obama crooks. Minn. group that saw $$ surge, some from Biden staffers, bailed out alleged violent criminals: report  #FoxNews
No, we don't. We need an end to Trump's reign of terror and for Biden to lead us through this pandemic so that we'll have someone who enacts sound, science-based public health policy instead of a whiny orange brat who has let 163k people die because he can't deal with reality.
Nope—Biden's house is his personal residence that he bought with his own money. Trump lives at the White House, but it belongs to us and isn't supposed to be used as an election prop for a corrupt and desperate tyrant whose election hopes are tanking.
Yeah. Only way to save USPS is to ramp up ads urging everyone to vote for you. Thinking about Trump winning in November is very scary and makes me sick. Vote! Vote! Vote! FOR BIDEN!
tRump says Biden can hurt God. If 1 man can hurt my God, then I gotta start looking for another god. A god that can’t be hurt by any 1 person, place, or thing.
All Biden does is hide in his basement.
The Point: How Donald Trump has already handed Joe Biden a debate win
Here’s an issue on which Trump and Biden agree. And they are both wrong. “Buy America” policies cost taxpayers $250,000 for each job “saved”. That’s not cost effective and it takes funding away from other things our country needs.
Trump paints Biden in a picture many don't recognize - The Washington Post
I believe this is what most dems are hoping for. Everyone can see Biden is in decline.
Biden ignored SS for 8 years as VP.
Are the Democrats will help people that unaware at the end of the year that they will pay a heavy tax on that unemployment benefits under Biden high tax laws? See for Schumer play politics and could care what happens to poor minded people he could  care less for them.

Kanye. Better Than Biden.  Trump Not Running,   I Vote For Him.
Biden and his new AG will investigate Trump and family.  No way he will get away with the corruption and evil illegal deeds. The orange jumpsuit will match his face.
We want and need a "big Biden win! "
Trump lowered Black unemployment to all-time low, increased funding for HBCUs, passed School Choice, raised Black homeownership,  got millions off welfare, pardoned Jack Johnson, First Step Act.  What has Biden done for the Black community? Why are you voting for Biden?
China owns Biden. That's why China wants Biden to win.
C'mon man. Let's face it. Biden is senile. That's why he is afraid of coming out frol his nasement. Everytime he opens his mouth, he says something his handlers with he didn't say.
O￼n the day that ⁦ was at his ritzy, exclusive country club in Bedminster, New Jersey, that  has a $350,000 admission fee, Biden did what so many typical Americans do for recreation:   He rode a bike
If anyone is a racist, it's Biden. Fought against bussing Black student for desegregation of schools.  What possitive has he done in nearly 50 years in elected office?  Biden is running on promises. Trump on accomplishments in 3-1/2 years.
You know what kind of candidate you have when the communist party endorses him - Biden - a shill for the communists
I saw a ad Joe Biden saying he’s a proud military parent. Wow I think he should be a disappointed military parent because Hunter Biden was kick out for using drugs. Need to lead by example. Now Hunter, a military failure making millions. Corruption all over the board
Ginger, I like your thought, but this will never be agreed upon by either party. I know you assume Biden will pass it with ease, but one small mistake, or spelling error. Could end his chances.  Sorry, everything in politics can &amp; will be spun or lied about on both sides to win.
The main reason people like Biden is because he is running against Trump.
Love that he endorsed Biden!  Looking forward to Texas voting Blue!  😷✌️🗳🌊
Isn't that the truth. Biden will have his work cut out for him. #VoteBlueToEndThisNightmare
We need to become much better at fighting back in areas where it really counts. First priority is to elect Biden!
Joe Biden's campaign book Just got released . It's entitled   " What Did He Say? "
Biden replaced Trump.
Nobody is challenging his physical ability, they're questioning his mental acuity. Bike riding is fine but can he carry a coherent conversation? That's all people are asking, the upcoming debates should answer that question unless Biden declines, doubt will still exist then.
When Biden says he is "going to get control of the virus" he means he will never let you go to work, leave your house or send your children to school.
Ginger, you keep focusing on Trump.  I didn’t comment on Trump's failures, my comment was on your use of “no hint” about Biden. Do you see the claims of the women in Business Insider article as being valid?  If you just dismiss them, how are you better than those you oppose?
They can’t &amp; they don’t care. Let’s just move on &amp; work on GOTV of Dems-independent leaning Dems-never trumpers since the timeline is getting compressed.Let Lincoln Project &amp; other similar groups work on trying 2 peel 2-3% of Repubs off 4 Biden. 🎣 or cut bait time soon.
Presidential Hopeful Joe Biden Wants This Video Removed Of Him Speaking ...  via
And ears and brains to make sense of Biden’s  senseless
In my spare time I think about things like this: Will Trump go to Herman Cain’s funeral, is he decent enough to say kind words about him? Why is Biden taking so long to make his VP choice public? If it’s a sister, does he fear backlash at the polls? This says a lot about the USA.
A pretzel could have defeated the candidates that ran against her 2018 but I see your point.....  Her endorsement of Biden was definitely a tough pill to swallow.....
That actually is a good point......  If I was betting man, I do think Biden is going to choose Rice.
If you were betting, who do you think Biden and his team are going to pick?
Brian Stelter identifies theme in right-wing talk radio's attack on Joe Biden - CNN Video  This is the must watch of the week far as I’m concerned. RW media is not going to let up between now and Nov., so stay vigilant.
Strong support from the Bernie camp..... Along with her supporting M4A, defunding the police, etc....
My actual preference is not happening, lol..... (Turner or Lee)   But out of the Biden's short list my top 3 are:   1. Bass 2. Warren 3. Duckworth
Ginger, sounds like you didn't read the Lifesite Catholic article that started this thread? Fr Pavone was Director of Priest for Life.  Was Tara Reade’s claim a “hint" against VP Biden?  What about the other 7 claims against VP Biden?
Who will be Biden’s “TOKEN” ??????
Biden supports those policies? So, what,his advisors are forcing him to oppose them? I'm almost 70 now, and blaming first the Soviets and now the Russians for our own catastrophic flaws has been a near-constant throughout my life. It got old way before I did.
Noted woman of color, Joe Biden
Joe Biden just destroyed one of Trump's biggest attack lines
Fox News clip discredits talking point of right-wing radio
Ginger, I myself wouldn’t use “worse” to describe VP Biden. “No hint”, so how do describe VP Biden being accused by Tara Reade of sexual assault? Or the other complaints by women of inappropriate acts? Maybe Fr Pavone is correct on how to pick a POTUS.
Maxine Waters says she's confident Biden will choose a Black woman as a running mate
“Tehran’s motivation to conduct such activities (meddle to help  is, in part, driven by a perception that President Trump’s reelection would result in a continuation of U.S. pressure on Iran in an effort to foment regime change.” Hmm, Biden colluding with terrorists!
No, we're obviously going to have to pay taxes at the end of the year, or have some type of federal excise tax.  Dems are the ones ignoring SS. I've never heard of a Dem plan to save SS. Not when Biden was VP.
All I can think of is to ensure that all votes against Trump is more than votes for Trump &amp; all votes against Biden is more than votes for Biden. Also, all votes against Trump 20 is greater than all votes against Trump 16, &amp; all votes against Biden is more than against Hillary.
Marsha, clearly you haven't been listening. Joe Biden said he's picking a "woman" he did not say a woman of color. Facts matter, Marsha. Get your facts straight before you speak. It is better to remain silent and be assumed a fool, than to speak and erase all doubt. #GirlBye
Biden edges closer to VP pick: Here's who's up and who's down
Sen. Ron Johnson denies getting dirt on Biden from Ukrainian lawmaker, blasts Blumenthal for 'twisting' classified briefings  #FoxNews
I mean WE know why she's terrible but I wouldn't have thought the Biden camp would think their voters wouldn't buy it
Biden foes not have the capacity to be a world leader and we dint need Bernie Sanders and his group at he helm
Joe Biden understands? Joe don't know what state he's in half the time. He can't tell the difference between his sister and his wide. He thinks he's Joe Biden's husband.  Elect Biden and let Antifa rule Democrat cities.
Well he’s not going to urge it, insist on it &amp; has no plans to even suggest it....of course, I expect he'll just let NY State (likely others) take care of it.....&amp; Biden CANNOT stop them even if he were inclined....Biden wants desparately to just get America back on thrack‼️ 👍🏽👍🏽
I’m going to vote for Joe Biden. I honor him and love him. But sometimes his voice seems frail and faraway, like an echo from a long-ago summer evening on the porch.
So...the Postal Union makes campaign contributions to the Biden for President campaign only. Gotcha‼️
What was all that trouble in Benghazi Susan Rice claimed to be because a silly video when she was Obama/Biden's Security Advisor?? Four Americans dies in that attack and the Obama/Biden Administration tried to sweep it under the rug.
We can't let senile Joe Biden destroy our country.
Iran lives Biden as they want more pallets of taxpayers $$$$$
#JoeBidenForPresident2020 continues to lead in Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, polls indicate
China would prefer Biden,China would have preferred that COVID-19 came from somewhere else too 👹👀
Electing Trump will give us law and order.   Electing Biden will result in Portlands throughout the country. Dems can't even acknowledge what's happening in Democrat run Portland, instead of taking action to quell the violence Antifa brings, calling the violent protests a myth.
Ha ha ha ha! I needed to laugh! You lost me at Biden &amp; decency! Politics are ugly any which way with whomever! Decency &amp; poltics is oxymoronic.
Biden leads Trump in battlegrounds of Pennsylvania, Wisconsin: poll | TheHill huge if you believe polls.
The only reason any country wants Biden...is Biden can be manipulated and controlled by bribing him with money. Biden doesn’t care about Americans... he cares about himself! Like most politicians: Pelosi, Obama, etc!
A man just said if Biden is elected, he’s leaving the state!So, you’d go to another state where’s he’s still President? LOL (I’m sure he meant the country! Lots of people say they’ll move and don’t!) If Biden’s President, then say goodbye to property rights, police, jobs etc
Regarding the Biden VP choice; nothing says “token” better than choosing someone on the basis of gender or race.
Joe Biden is a puppet of Red China
Actually the intelligence report was that China and Iran were actively helping  Russia is actively working against both Biden and Trump. Russia is backing  and
The election like Groundhog Day for me. We get Trump again I’m staying in Hawaii for the next 4 years. We get Biden I’d be open to live on the mainland for a while since the majority of ppl will be civil.
How they figure Biden will win? With his health issue such as dementia, their not a lot of people will fall for this message cause they're not enough people to accept this massages.
None of them going in the White House cause Biden will end up like Hillary.

Maybe not. Maybe he’s just all in on team Biden for the potus win, but he’ll still work for MFA when he can?
That is true. It was pundits who then began saying African American female not woman of color almost immediately , seeming 2 box Biden in,
Ms. Wallace, how soon after Biden wins, do these exact same republicans start attacking him mercilessly...🙄
We don't need Russia to denigrate Biden. Biden denegrates Biden better than any state actor.
This is how the Trump/Biden debate should be done.
will gain a lot of votes if he supports Jayapal’s H1384 version of Medicare For All. #MedicareForAll
Not bitching, the enemy of my enemy is my friend... but when Biden wins, how soon does The Lincoln turn on him, and in what ways...?
Biden needs to pick a women of color, preferably black or brown.  His VP must be able to energize and excite the Dem bases. Susan Rice is as boring as Biden. He needs to pick Kamala Harris.
We love Biden here in Hawaii!
This article is a hit job designed for "both candidates are the same" BS. When Biden compared the Black &amp; Latin demographics, he was talking about voting patterns, &amp; he was right. But you'd never know it from this sloppy piece of sensationalist journalism.
Broke his heart when Gabbard endorsed Biden. Cut the foundation of his world out from under him.
And Biden will STILL win.

Here’s the real story: Since this spring, outside groups supporting Joe Biden have outspent their pro-Trump counterparts nearly 3-to-1, an influx that’s helped to erase the president’s longstanding financial advantage. #JoeBidenForPresident2020
Sounds like Joe Biden doesn't even know SS is forecasted to collapse by mid 2030s. Trump will do something about it. Biden will continue to ignore the problem like he's done for eight years as VP.

Never would I vote for elder abused Joe Biden or any democrat after watching their behavior to Trump. Standing Trump strong.
Biden doesn’t share my views on all issues. That might make him “wrong” in your book. But, Biden doesn’t lie, cheat &amp; steal his way through life. And Biden actually values life other than his own.   This is why most ppl are voting for him, not cuz they agree w/him on everything
The Trump Administration is done with corinavirus. Taking further action would be admitting their efforts up to this point have failed. Nothing will done to curb the spread until either Biden takes office or a vaccine is made. There will be over we 1/4 million dead by then.
I believe the biggest hoax now is demented Joe being foisted as a candidate capable of being POTUS. He doesn't seem capable of running the local kindergarten and you want him to be POTUS? Biden running for POTUS is the galactic hoax of the century. Never in your wildest dreams.
You hit the nail in the head! New York now, the rest of America as soon as they can get Biden to steal the election. These people are sick.
#JoeBidenForPresident owns Fox News reporter during morning bike ride.  #TrumpCantRideABike
Well, Biden was against busing, Cozied up to segregationist Senators, Sponsored a racist criminal justice bill Wouldn't not supporting him  Be considered the same thing?
Did you see Biden wearing a mask while riding a bike but not a helmet?
The only way they can win. There is no enthusiasm for Biden.  #Trump2020
In other words, vote before Trump exposes how senile Biden is in their debates? I'd be worried about that too.
Remember that pic of Obama riding that bike with the helmet looking very impotent...Biden looks worse than that every day.
Me too...
President Biden.
And Joe Biden can ride a bike!

So much for America entering a new enlightened era by electing a black president...  Trump has knocked us back into the 1950's...
Either way, Joe Biden will inherit the power to overule Congress.
You really just dig on Biden’s age? He’s only 3 years older than Trump. Does that mean that trump will be too old to be President in 3 years?
Governor Whitmer is a rock star.  I was worried that Trump's idiot supporters were going to do actual harm to her when they stormed the capitol building armed to the teeth after the orange moron tweeted LIBERATE MICHIGAN.
New level of crazy... just like Biden is going to hurt God 🤣
I don’t think we could get the current Senate to approve Obama’s image on Rushmore. Flip the Senate! Hold the House! Biden 2020!

That's the way to stay safe in this Trump pandemic.

The announcement of his VP should be voiced over on this and made into a Joe Biden ad!  Lol
#Trump2020 #SaturdayThoughts  Biden the alienator vs. Trump the unifier.
What did the Obama/Biden administration leave us?  They left us unprepared.
You mean the hand going up Biden’s puppet hole? Sure.
Failure to do this 5 years ago, gave us this president. Failure to continue to not fact check him let’s him continue his lies over and over. The reporters know they’ll probably lose their WH privilege, but who cares at this point. Go cover Biden instead.
Biden needs to wear  a bike helmet.  A general safety thing, like a mask.

I do! Great reference! Its EXACTLY what Biden and the #NAZIDemocraticSocialistPedophile. Party policy is. Turn the United States into a shithole banana republic like Venezuela and Biff looks more like Biden than Trump
Let’s face it. Joe Biden bothers me. Period
Totally agree. We need to vote this scum out in November. Unbelievable what they're getting away with.  Makes me really sad, so many patriots died to give us our freedoms. Then a scumbag like Trump comes along, shitting on the constitution. Biden 2020.
Don't let Biden ruin that expression, I love using it 😬
Didn’t Biden promise to announce his VP pick this week?   Lol what happened? Could it be that he had two very racist gaffes in the two interviews he did this week? I guess we’ll never know lol.
I’d rather it be Rice than Harris. Mostly because Biden’s foreign policy is gonna be a sh** show no matter what? So might as well pick the person without the ultra toxic fan base. I would much rather face VP Rice over VP Harris in the 2024 primary.
There are Ignorants out there that will vote for him, especially if they get a stimulus check. I don't care what he does, I would never vote for the scumbag. Biden 2020🇺🇸

Biden is doubling down on getting the anti communist Latino vote in Florida and doesnt care about anywhere else. It’s the only reason to do this. I don’t think it’s worth tapping Latin American fascists either way, but if Biden loses Florida after this, it’s just going to be sad
I’m assuming you’re gonna vote Biden, so I’m going to just say that you are a pedophile that likes to sniff children, call all black people the same (with noticeable differences) and are corrupt. 🤷‍♂️ but hey that’s just all Biden voters right?
Unlike other candidates , Biden is using an  incredibly diverse number of gaffes In order to stifle his shot at the WH
Kathy, I’m sorry you left, but I hope you still have a relationship w/Christ. Catholic Church calls me to try &amp; treat people w/dignity &amp; respect by looking at all their fruits good/bad. My Vote for POTUS, will be made in prayer w/Holy Spirit, examining both Biden/Trumps fruits.

lied about Joe Biden's comments about blacks and Latinos.  He's an ideal fact-checker for the far-left wing.  If you just don't believe ANYTHING he says, you'll probably be right.  Liberals are pathetic.
So why did Joe say that he DID SAY that?  Who's lying,  you or Joe Biden?  Since you're both far-left wing idiots - er, liberals - guess it doesn't really matter, does it?  Neither of you can be trusted or believed.

Trump says Joe Biden is “against the Bible.” But when asked what his favorite book of the Bible isTrump said “Two Corinthians” instead of “Second Corinthians,” which is how the book is known by anyone who has read and actually cares about the Bible.
Trump says that Joe Biden is “against God.” Actually, Biden is a devout Catholic. Nobody is more “against God” than somebody who is incapable of telling the truth, such as Dishonest Donald Trump.

Why does Joe Biden view Black and Hispanic voters as some  resource that belongs to the Democratic Party?  Abraham Lincoln put an end to that.  We are Americans first, and Americans' votes should be earned and not assumed or taken for granted.
Because Biden has dementia
Biden is correct, in politics/voting Latinos are more diverse than African Americans. So what? It's not an insult it's a fact based on voting statistics. In our state more Asian Americans vote democrat...it's a fact. TRUMP YOU ARE STUPID!
I saw Trump’s untutored response. He did not appear to remember what was said, much less why it was problematic. It seemed like he heard Biden had said something and he should jump on the opportunity to say “Biden Bad!” then hope others will chime in to carry the conversation
I’m thinking the Democrats are up to something. We had some really good talent before Biden decided to put his name in the ring and then they choose him over Bernie....  Something doesn’t seem right.
