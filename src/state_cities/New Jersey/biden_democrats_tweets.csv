Interesting. What national emergency will President Biden declare and divert money to?
I understand why Biden chose to wait. Unless he is floating the VP rumors, it's irresponsible for MSNBC to prime the audience and create its own narratives. I often feel like I'm watching cable news' version of The Bachelor.   I think there are other stories starving 4 attention.
Can you see Biden doing this? Walking by himself,  talking to reporters,  and then walking to the copter? I don't.
Biden and Harris win. Other combinations, not so probable.
Take a breath Ms Reid. Biden will make the right decision for him. Would it change your vote?
Yes they are aware but not of Joe Biden. They are aware of the pestulance that has invaded the Whitehouse and Senate and all will be taken care of on November 3rd.
Biden wrote that bill. Are people gonna realize Biden isnt the answer.
as far as John Lewis lets rename that Bridge  "John R. Lewis FORMERLY etc. etc. keep BOTH names but John's on top LARGER, showing the defeat of Hate ! and many of us are looking forward to your 3rd Term as Pres. with Biden as your speaker.
She attacked Biden on race in the debate--way below the belt. If she feels that way about him, she shouldn't want to his VP.  BIDEN picked Dodd to help with the search. He is giving his best advice.  And the other choices are women (some black), so Jen's claim makes no sense.
What about the debates? Trump could destroy Biden or vice versa. Either could self-destruct. 3 Presidential, 1 VP. Do you or your experts have any ideas on this?
What about the debates? Trump could destroy Biden- or himself - or Biden could destroy himself- or Trump. Sept 29 and 1 per week for 3 weeks- Oct 7 is VP
FUCK TRUMP! Don’t put all of your faith in Biden either😭💯
I’d rather see Val Demings in the role. Yes I agree. Biden already has California and the West Coast
Joe biden is dangerous.  His anti-school choice position hurts minorities.  His green new deal love of anti fracking hurts America.  His lack of a brain hurts all of us.  Obama is a political hack , too.
My heart and prayers go out to the poor misinformed viewers of CNN who are subjected daily to the attempt to manufacture news that will benefit biden and hurt Trump.  May God help them learn the truth and think for themselves.
This is the same  beyatch who said voting for Biden is like eating shit and she has the nerve to be upset.
I’ll still take him over Biden!!
Not defending Trump's twitter fubar, and his need to hone in his message. I  just realized the most important election monitor still predicts a Trump win. the market would be down 10k points if Biden waa leading.
People who say they’ve been “a lifetime republican” but are voting for Joe Biden, join the club...I’ve been a lifetime democrat and I’m voting for Joe Biden, too. Suck it up, we’re trying to save our country
It’s not immaterial, it’s actually a fairly significant issue that gets to a fundamental question about Democrats in general and Biden in particular—if it’s so important to beat Trump, why aren’t they behaving like they actually want to win by supporting wildly popular policies
How'd that work out for you Herm ?🤦‍♂️ 🚑 🏥 😷 🌊= Joe Biden 46 .
Then we can at the very least agree that the primary wasn’t any sort of referendum on policy &amp; finally put to bed this idea that Bernie lost because nobody likes any of his proposals  So if it’s that important to defeat Trump, why isn’t Biden supporting such a popular idea as M4A
There is no coalition of Bernie supporters and Biden &amp; Democrats, because Biden &amp; the Democrats haven’t made any effort to build such a coalition, and in fact are just as vocal as they were in 2016 about how they are deliberately courting Republicans instead of the left
I think this may be the ticket. Biden has to eventually bow out.
Lincoln Project co-founder says if Trump loses he’ll ditch Biden’s inauguration and regard it as ‘illegitimate’ -
How about getting Durham up to light speed so maybe Biden will be exposed as a criminal since it seems most republicans are prepared to stand by and POTUS get steamrolled the Dems and MSM?
WOW he wants to give President Biden a new West Wing ,Im sure Joe will say NO. FUCK YOU DONNIE BOY.
Oh please . . . Outside of the pandemic which couldn’t have been stopped no matter the admin, the country was doing great before hand.  And when he wins in Nov, he’ll get the economy back to where he had it prior to the pandemic.  Please no Biden.  Pleassssse.
The sad thing about Joe Biden, he doesn't even know he's being used by the party he trusted for so many years... 🇺🇸
I hope Biden donates all those hydrocychloroquine doses sitting in the stockpile to people that actually need it.
chose Biden because they believed, accurately or not, that he was the best candidate to do so, OR voters chose Biden because they saw the election as a referendum on Bernie’s policies &amp; categorically rejected them
And of course it wasn’t—people voted for Biden because party leadership paraded every prominent neoliberal Democrat out to line up behind Joe &amp; sell the public on the idea that this ancient racist in clear cognitive decline was their best shot at beating Trump
And Biden.. I mean AOC and his puppet masters are champing at the bit to shut it down. HOW THE FUCK ARE PEOPLE SUPPORTING THE INSANITY OF IT?!?!?
No Biden is just as bad as what we have now, just in a somewhat different way
You’ve spent the past eight or nine months watching in real time how shamelessly corporate media can and does reframe or outright ignore whatever information is inconvenient for the wealthy elites’ preferred narrative—why would any of that change under Biden
For 50 years Joe Biden has been a China Lapdog. He would probably sell his mother, daughter and wife to China for money.
We had decades of imbecile presidents who let the entire midwest hollow out our manufacturing base. And you put this on trump? So much derangement in u. You should question the corrupt crook china lapdog Biden. He took his useless son Hunter to china to solicit for hedge funds.
Biden does it, so... Racist!
He is on par with a Biden as per his mental status
I hope Joe Biden will be safe from the Don-Trump Flu because it is fighting like hell insude my heart.
There is nothing compelling people to protest with some wilding out in these places.   If they take the bait, it's their fault--they are enabling their oppressor.  It's easy to stay home, help slow the spread, and do what you can to stop the violence--which is to ELECT BIDEN!
Oh look who wants to import drugs from Canada now!? Taking a cue from Bernie I guess. Too bad Biden is too selfish to have added this to the platform. Now look...

Trump is a symptom of an already existing problem. Clinton, Bush, Obama and Biden all created the conditions that allowed trump to be elected.
Joe Biden: NFL, MLB seasons ’probably not going to be able to happen’ amid coronavirus pandemic
It wasn’t so much that they were scared Bernie would lose—they were terrified of another Trump term, which party leadership then exploited by parading everybody from Pete to Kamala to the Klob to Obama to fuckin Beto out to sell voters on the idea that Biden was their best shot
This is a dangerous gambit that opens the door for Trump to make a counter demand that he will only release his taxes if Biden draws a clock
Destructive attitude? Are you kidding? Democrat mayors and governors sit back and let their cities burn while reps and senators do everything possible to destroy the economy to ensure a Biden victory which will surely destroy America.
In a TV ad Trump says Biden supports police defunding.That is a lie. Quote used has Biden saying "yes absolutely" in response to the question do you believe there's systematic racism in some law enforecement? Ad is just another false accusation.  Trumpsters believe lies are OK.
You can’t be serious! Do you honestly believe that Joe Biden and his son go to China and suddenly Hunters Biden’s new investment company gets $1.4 billion and there’s no impropriety?
What about the vast sums of money paid to Biden relatives in virtually every country he has set foot in?
So if Durham report finds Biden complicit or involved in the illegal activity relating to Trump his campaign and personnel you think it should be held back and perhaps let a criminal of the highest order be elected?
Apparently Biden just called for the prosecution of “all arsonists and anarchists” and that’s the same stance that Trump has taken. Eerily similar to 1910-1990’s totalitarian anti-left movement. I have so many things to say about this but there’s not enough room to say it all...
So Trump's fear based smear campaign continues.  Biden has never endorsed de-funding the police. Trump simply drops random voice clips in to manipulate his weak minded sheep. That old woman is far more likely to succumb to covid 19 due to the administrations failed response.
Joe Biden is not the Fascist to worry about. He'll never win. It's the other fascist in the Democrat Party. TRUMP2O2O anyway.
Jerry Nadler is a megalomaniac and a delusional idiot. He also tipped democrats hand when he asked Barr to commit to not release Durham report til after election. Clearly they know they’ve been caught and hope a Biden win will allow them to continue hostile takeover of America!
Biden is talking about arresting them because of what he is
Very smart move. This may help Biden California. Lunch pale Joe must feel comfortable he's locked down the blue wall state.

These dems are nuts. Can you imagine a Biden/whoever presidency. It’s frightening.
If Joe Biden refuses to participate in a "Live" debate with the President seeking the Highest Office in the World, than the Nov. Election should be suspended until he does..
...made in the past couple days by the Biden campaign. They overwhelmingly voted down M4A during a pandemic despite a majority of the American people supporting it, voted down a 10% cut in the Pentagon budget, didn’t embrace the Green New Deal, and refused to condemn...
I'm a little bit older, but I just don't believe that anyone who actually pays attention,  would ever vote for that doddering old fool Biden.  I mean really,  he's always been a joke.
I’m going to believe those nasty ads, because you are a proven liar who promises everything and delivers nothing. Your fear-monger “Biden is going to defund the police” are also filled with complete lies. #TrumpLies #TrumpFailsAmerica
Why a president Joe Biden wouldn't send the stock market into an ugly tailspin  Well there is always one fool in the bunch!!  As put "at least there is one"Fool!!!🤡🤪😜😂😆😅😁
The far left that calls Biden a bowl of shit HAS lost the middle.
I hope it does. I flinched when Biden added Dodd to this post; I see why. Frighteningly tone deaf. This goes to an issue I’ve been raising: are any of the black faces in high places in Biden camp really calling the shots?
Mr. Biden, tear down that fence.
Mr. President, if Joe Biden refuses to participate in a "Live" debate with You seeking the Highest Office in the World, than the Nov. Election should be suspended until he does.. As President You can always do that...
Joe Biden can shoot himself on 5th Avenue and I’d still vote for him.
If Biden picks this weekend it would be a nine day difference from Hillary picking Kaine and 21 days before Obama picked Biden which was on Aug 23 2008.
The article is pretty good, I’m no fan but she dosent trash Biden and said she will work hard for him.
When will Joe Biden announce his pick for Vice President?
He doesn't have to use the war excuse--he just has to say that the traditional format is very unfair to him, and he proposed alternative terms, but Biden is afraid to debate him fairly.

Biden will win the election, but Trump will invoke Directive 51.
even though your a Biden supporter. lol.  Still happy fir you. !!
Screw the polls. Every Biden campaign staffer, volunteer, and voter needs to wake up every morning thinking about the "Chicago Way." Because we're up against a real gangster.
I completely agree. I think he will do whatever to punk out. (The same way he will do whatever to cheat election) Even T must know that Person Woman Man Camera TV won’t cut it under hot debate lights—even if it is against gaffey Biden
A nice rewriting of history there.  Do you fools know how easy it is to say what you'd do now.  Hindsight is 20/20, except with Biden is probably 20/40
Pray tell what evidence do you mean? Strzok notes, Flynn unmasked 27 times, Comey lying, FBI lawer doctoring email, Rice CYA email to self, Biden Logan act... wait that’s the actual evidence that proves it. Therefore not a theory anymore.
MSM: "guys if we all just look the other way until November, we can pretend the riots never happened and get Biden in"  Any employee: "I don't appreciate being misgendered as a guy"
Our country is going to collapse no matter who wins this election. Neither Biden nor Trump are the answers.
Its already her , why do you think she’s doing all these events, why does she have a lot of tv time and she posted a pic of her and Biden on Instagram💕😊
You should bet another 100K on Biden.
If so, why on earth would you ever in a million years insist on voting for Biden knowing what his policies will do to all those people, rather than join in solidarity with them by witholding your vote from Biden, making it contingent upon  Democrats passing Medicare for All
Biden is going to win the election, but the Supreme Court will nullify it.

Not in PA it doesn’t feel this way. All I see are Trump ads slamming Biden. On repeat. I’m sure the same is true in all of the key states he wants.  Haven’t seen anything from Joe, yet. Maybe he thinks he has PA in the bag. 😂
One of the most important differences between Biden, and Trump is that Biden has a team in which he will listen to.
And if so, and something happened to Biden, would she choose Stacey Abrams as her VP? :)
How do we #StopFacebook from stealing our election again?  You have no idea how this country will implode from another ill-gotten Trump win. Portland will be only the beginning.  Biden's path to the White House could hit a dead end on Facebook

Harris seen as Biden VP favorite as clock ticks
I have thought Texas was in play all along--I knew the virus would swallow it up to aid the shift.  Biden WILL win Texas.
Biden says "if you are black and you dont vote for him then you ain't black" do people not see he is just taking advantage of black people. If I was black I do t think I would like that. And I know my black friends dont like it.
So do I, I think Biden’s Campaign will announce their choice and to take away from Biden he will come out mins later and Pence will step down and Haley will be named as new VP for trump! If he does the press shouldn’t react! Let Biden and his pick have the limelight!
Congratulation to Trump on following Biden's lead...again.
Not a Word when Old Creepy Biden Spews his Racist rants! Demonrat Slobs!!!
Bookmark this tweet if Biden wins. There will be another tweet from him blasting them when they eventually pivot back right and attack Biden everyday.  Willing to bet the deed to my house on it. With Matty, it’s always a safe bet. 😂

The 12 most logical picks for Joe Biden’s vice president, ranked
Biden just proposed a plan to make oatmeal softer. He then stated ketchup person was not happy about the infection rate of the Han wu virus.  Mustard with potstickers.
This is really just Biden admitting what we all know because A.) it was finally safe to say it without risking any fundamental change, and B.) it was politically convenient to try and ingratiate himself with the American Left
I think it’s a bit of a stretch to say Biden “endorsed” Bernie—for a high-ranking Dem like Biden, an actual endorsement would’ve come with significant amount of campaigning on his behalf like Bernie had done for Hillary
Judging by Biden’s pandemic GOTV efforts, clearly not much
Yeah, like in the Democratic Party where Joe Biden is accused and the party does a complete(and first) 180degree turn and doubts the accuser, Tara Reade and gives Biden the benefit of the doubt followed by completely suppressing they story!
joe biden has shown his desperation in calling Trump a racist.  Typical Democrat ploy to attack one with whom they disagree as a racist.  Biden might wish to look back on his stands, comments, and practices and avoid the race comments for his own good.
So you’re not voting for Biden? It’s indisputable fact the DNC and Obama/Biden administration had more to do wth Russian election meddling and Ukraine quid pro quo than President Trump.
Biden did say we need to end shareholder capitalism so they are all very close to that sentiment... What other kind of capitalism would they like... ah yes, the crony kind.  That was like the, wanting to put an end to the bull/bear cycle... yeah OK
Why, when Biden trips up, it’s mostly about race &amp; blacks? I thought he knew black folks so well. No, Rep Clyburn?
Well we got the living carcass called Joe Biden...so.
And how yiu figure Obama and Biden didn't run
Why do you feel Bernie would have stopped those agencies? At the moment of crises when we needed him the most to forge on he quit. Couldn’t even stand up against Joe F’ing Biden. Shame on me for being fooled. Twice.
I'm not a fan of Biden but he would have handled COVID like Obama did EBOLI &amp; STOPPED IT B 4 IT KILLED THOUSANDS OF US. Rump permitted the Virus to come &amp; REFUSED TO DO THE ADULT THING, now he's FINALLY WEARING A MASK. U CAN RESEARCH HIS PAST IF U HAVE A BRAIN.
I’ll say it again.   You are really bad at your job.   Unless of course you’re secretly trying to get Biden elected. Then keep up the good work 😉
agree w/ you  We NEED to call out Biden &amp; his team NOW. If they’re taking us for granted NOW what do you expect when he gets IN office? We can still hold his feet to fire &amp; vote FOR him. He needs to give us reasons to vote FOR him &amp; that’s by pushing bold policies
The White House plans to eliminate a sweeping Obama-era fair housing regulation on Thursday and replace it with a much weaker rule amid an effort by Donald Trump to paint Joe Biden as a danger to the suburbs
joe biden has a disgraceful past,  Enriching his son Hunter with China connections, praising Sen Robt. Byrd, doing nothing to help Blacks for 47 years.   Screw him.
Biden look in the mirror !! Your no better !
Joe Biden has reached the lowest, despicable, false, disgusting level of campaigning by calling Trump a racist.. Biden has forgotten his past years calling Blacks --n%$

Allies say Karen Bass's reputation as a bridge-builder would make her a strong partner to presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden.
Amen to that! You are honest and trustworthy ♥️ cannot wait for President Biden!!!
Comming from her that mean most people are going to vote for him rather than the fool Biden but that ok he will not be the nominee Bernie is
Would you rather have Biden, who obviously pays someone to run his twitter account?   Or Trump?   Because I’d rather have
It’s not sexist at all. In fact it’s the opposite. HRC was ruled out almost immediately as a Obama Veep because of the exact same concerns. And she attacked Obama in almost the same exact way Harris attacked Biden, and missed her/their shot. There were no cries of sexism then
WOW Joe Biden being led by his handlers so he doesn’t stop to answer questions which would show he is completely incompetent and mentally unstable.  If Biden wins, radical liberal socialists will be controlling him!
Will President Biden be there?
Can we apply that rule to tax policy? Republicans pay taxes based on Trump’s policy, Dems pay taxes based on Biden’s policy. And once you vote, you’re locked in to the corresponding rate. Wonder how many people would change their votes if that was the rule?
That is who I said all along would be Biden’s pick (or rather his handlers pick) There is not much to chose from, but AT LEAST she is much better looking than Biden and you can’t say that about some of the other choices!!😂😂
I have been seeing on here that a civil war is coming. It won’t happen soon. If Biden should win, protests and rioting will stop I think—but not for long. The anarchists will not be satisfied with a Dem win. They will wait for another “trigger event”, which won’t take very long.
“Biden isn’t winning any votes from sports fans these days” from your article.  Have you looked at the polls or are you just pretending to be a reporter?  Biden is CRUSHING TRUMP.  Americans respect his commitment to science but you take the low road
That story about Biden fingering his campaign worker? That story died of corona.
He had no choice people.  He is s puppet.  A vote for Biden at this time is proof of your hatred of  this country.
I have to agree the quicker we get down to business the faster the American people will know how corrupt the Obama Biden gang was Time for handcuffs and lockup
So they faked a Biden quote then?
Good for him she should make a good mantelpiece for the Biden just like him no brains and no guts great pair
Watching you word-parse “very fine people on both sides” compared to this knee jerk reaction to a Biden statement is hilarious
the only time Biden will take questions is to take away from Bar
I Seriously don’t think he is all there!! You can tell by looking at him. He makes Biden look like Einstein!! This is the type of person who on Dec 6th, 1941 would have said “ we have nothing to fear from the Japanese “!!!

Obama chose not to endorse anybod, maybe because he wanted the presumptive candidate to get there on his/her own. He didn’t want ppl to be able to say so &amp; so won because of Obama’s endorsement! Biden got there on his own, Obama’s endorsement is helpful now!
Yes that and if you don't vote for Joe Biden you're actually helping to keep Trump in the White House
Martina - it’s a ploy to replace Pence as VP.  As soon as Biden announces a woman VP candidate Pence gets discarded.

We need a President that doesn’t need someone to wipe his ass, so I guess you are out!  I’m not ridin with Biden, I’m running away as fast as I can!
Let’s see, both you and he are the reason that someone like DJT is the POTUS. Your team couldn’t do any of those things in the 8 years of your presidency nor in the 40 years that Biden has been in government. Not to mention, you started some of this bullshit.

Postpone the Election? That Could Mean President Biden
Based Obama/Biden
This year has shown the two party system is a disaster and the country is broken and if you think Biden and the Dems will fix it you are kidding yourselves. Dems don't want to fix anything because they need to run on fixing things every four years.
Sanders, the DNC took out all of your progressive ideology from the democrat platform. They put Biden right in the middle of the road. That’s what the DNC thinks of your platform, a total sham.
Sanders, I wouldn’t count my chickens before they hatch. The polls show Biden with a lead but this race is far from being over.

Voting for biden for the sole reason that he’s not Trump
They are delusional.  They wish their candidate was “moral” I guess they missed the 4 decades of Biden’s racist remarks. He was against desegregation.  And he is a huge pervert.  One of those touchy, feely dirty old men. Also he is pandering to terrorist organizations.
You must because because you will never hear anything coherent out of Biden’s mouth.  It is really very sad, obvious and embarrassing.
Unfortunately that ship has sailed. But Biden next best thing!!! Maybe a Supreme Court position in his future tho!

Why Electing Joe Biden Will Make The Culture War Even Worse
The more damage he does, the more he puts his family at risk. Once the electoral college certifies Biden as the next POTUS, Drumof will try to burn every document regarding his time in the WH but Biden will have his A-Team in place to thwart that process.
I might be wrong about this, but if and when Biden clearly has 270+ EVs after vote-counts with no valid disputes, won't Republican leaders like McConnell give public statements acknowledging that Biden is the President-Elect, and they look forward to working with him or whatnot?

WHOOPS! Politico Accidentally Publishes Article Revealing Who Biden Picked As His VP
Can’t wait for Biden to choke on a grape and have trump respond by deepthroating a watermelon then watch him be crowned king of the milky way
would like to hear an updated opinion regarding this article:
Not only can liberals not imagine a much better world. They can't imagine a much worse world. Even if they succeed at electing Biden, Trump can escalate far right terrorism just by claiming the election was rigged. Libs won't prep for that bc they can't imagine it's possible.
LMAO. Joe Biden has 247 people watching his broadcast today.   The polls are GARBAGE.
Joe Biden should pick whoever he feels most comfortable with. The person that feels like a trusted partner, to him &amp; American people.

Indeed.   And why does Biden?   If the question were, Why does Sanders, I think there's actually a good answer!
It’s really time the government steps in and stops you posting these Chinese slogans. The Chinese want Biden to win the election because they can’t push around or buy Trump.
Sanders, your really confident of the outcome of the election. With CORRUPT Biden as your nominee, I wouldn’t start opening the champagne just yet.
Nadler, you liberal democrats have a way to twist the truth to further their own agenda. You have CORRUPT Biden as your nominee he may win the election and maybe he will lose. Stop spreading lies to help Biden with the election.

US coronavirus: Pompeo to face Senate as new economic figures show Covid-19 impact – live updates
The best I've been able to do with this uncomfortable conundrum is, figure I'd vote for Biden if I were in a swing state (I'm not), and be deeply grateful for those in swing states who refuse to do so. Someone needs to have the nerve to hang in for a less corrupt future.
So to be perfectly clear, Joe Biden is quoted saying the following about Trump’s despicable act of brute force against peaceful protestors and Breitbart deems it necessary to fact check only that the Bible was right side up? Got it.
To anyone who understands the threat that is Donald Trump: We have to hold it together for 97 days. Do not buy into any bs or division, stay united in this one goal. When we elect Biden we will make history for this united front; a bipartisan effort to secure the democracy.
My $0.02: If there are a bunch of Trump voters lying to pollsters, are they lying about Senate and House races too? No shame for a conservative to say he's voting for Ernst in IA. Ernst would be cruising to reelection while Trump/Biden are within 1%, but she's not.

Yesterday you made the unusual point of stating that altered images of a Jewish and a Black candidate were not anti Semitic and racist, respectively. Here your site colored the skin tone of Biden to look uncharacteristically orange. Is that also by design to emphasize your point?
This election seals it to me that the Dems and Republicans work together more than they let on. The BEST they have to offer against who they claim is the worst president ever is sleepy Joe? It don't add up. If they truly wanted a win, Joe Biden was their worst shot.
Judging by the ‘Biden works for Iowa’ signs and coats being worn, I’d say this was taken in January, well before the pandemic had hit on the US.

Kimberly is a Biden supporter! Haha!
Every time Biden speaks, the President has a press conference. Always trying to win the news cycle.
That's perfectly fine. But I think you're witnessing a President that has no sense of decorum and definitely doesn't abide by normal presidential standards. If Biden is indeed elected, I expect he will be faced with challenging questions like any president that preceded him.
Then you have just answered your own questions regarding any perceived difference. You yourself have said Trump is an "idiot". It's my contention (and maybe yours) that Biden is not. Do you treat an idiot the same way you treat a thoughtful, introspective person? I know I don't.
Let's try this a different way. Do you agree the method in which Trump conducts a press conference is different than Biden (or virtually any other elected official)? Do you agree that Trump has been subject to numerous misinformation claims when conducting interviews?
Biden and Warren have a virtual fundraiser Friday night. Many Warren peeps thought this was going to be a VP announcement. I wish.
I just watched a press conference where Biden took questions from reporters ABC, CBS, etc. Are you trying to say these are left leaning media organizations? Are you further suggesting that these reporters are not vigorous in their pursuit of a news story?

I hope Joe Biden has everything to go on day 1 as well as Pelosi’s House committees &amp; Schumer’s Senate ones. I have a feeling a whole lot of people are going to called to testify at hearings &amp; Trump won’t be able to direct them to refuse to show up or answer questions!!
A senile Joe Biden will be good for the United States. If we engage of wars of aggression, forced democracy, bully tactics, bombings of children, pedophilia of elites, and massive racism we can just say that we don't remember that stuff. 😃
you can't blame biden for anything. he's not home
Pretty conveniently placed given Biden is supposed to reveal someone by next week. Wow.
Just saw a guy in a Biden mask
I am gonna block all of the K-Hive if or when Joe Biden announces Kamala Harris will be his vice president because  they have to be on the top of the list of the most obnoxious supporters of all time on social media.
You beat Hillary 4 years ago. Probably the most unlike able candidate to run for President except for you. She still got 3 million more votes and you needed Russia’s help to win. You would get crushed by Obama just like you will by Biden. #NobodyLikesTrump
And they were trying to talk about Hunter Biden and nepotism??
Joe Biden should say something but he has strong black men &amp; women working in high level positions. Someone need to say, now, what is being said about Kamala Harris is not a reflection of the campaign and is unacceptable overall. Kamala Harris standing alone like Hillary Clinton.
Am I a bad Democrat?  I don’t care if Karen Bass went to a Scientology event in her district and said what politicians say? 🤷‍♂️ Trump said there are “fine people” who are white nationalists and locked kidnapped kids in cages. I’ll vote Biden no matter who is picked. 🤷‍♂️
A real 2020 turn would be a Karen becoming Vice President of the United States

biden told ingraham that he met with drs. 3 -or- 4 times a week...for an hr and 15 mins...wha?
I have a lot of feelings about the Biden/Warren fundraiser tonight.  Mostly it boils down to: 1. I still think Elizabeth Warren should be President. 2. Being a woman is exhausting AF.
Biden could pick my cat as VP and then shoot it on 5th Ave and I still vote for him. Still, he should choose a woman of color who is not tied to Scientology.

Kick his  Mr. Trump. It's not about race. It's about his failed leftist ideology. It is not racist to call failure...failure.  The Obama-Biden presidency was a failure. Bury it forever.
I don’t believe so.  Not yet, at least.  She’s being pushed hard to be Biden’s VP by various Foreign Policy elite in DC.  A number of senior figures in the Biden campaign don’t like her.

Odds are low. But if Biden just happens to drop that info,  you need to break the news in this thread.   Accomplished actress / political reporter.
Neither did Hillary. Warren has basically been erased from the media. Talk about misogyny. The thing is that Biden can't really do much except make a decision so it all stops and explain it so all the women understand his reasoning.  But after that its the general which is worse.

Running scared by Biden and his socialist friends, BE AFRAID,
Twitter is manipulating all traffic. We all know this. Media will hide this information like they are hiding Biden and all crimes of obamagate.
These right wing news media are trying to discredit every black woman running to be Biden's VP. They are digging up everything they can about their past even tho all of them have been a public official for years. Imagine if we actually get a black woman on the Supreme Court
They do not all donate to him where do you get your information from? You honestly think the elites would back Trump over Biden? You honestly think a career politician like Biden is on the up-and-up?

I love no malarkey Joe Biden... He won’t take no jive neither... And in November, he’s gonna tell Trump to put an egg in his shoe and beat it...
America is with Joe Biden all the way!
I like her.  There is really no one on the list that I could not get behind. I think Harris would be a great VP and personally I can see her as a competent and good Pres too. But I am good with whoever truthfully  I feel good about Biden and I just want the Trump nightmare to end
I grew up a Reagan Republican. We supported and protected our troops, and were loyal to our allies. That party is gone. Biden 2020.
What about Biden’s son? Making millions in Ukraine...
Someone literally tweeted last week that biden isnt doing anything and hes been largely out of the public eye and then someone else responded and was like nah hes been doing a lot and the person came back with “oh actually I see hes had one event a week.Its just not covered much”
What’s the huge fear?  SCOTUS is solidly right and a Senate majority of any would be slight.    Biden isn’t AOC, and I’ll gladly endure four years of policy I disagree with (and fight) to save the party.   Nothing else will send the message required to shock the conscience.
The supporters of the blacks should stop pressuring Biden to pick up a black VP. That will hurt Biden, and it's sure he will be defeated. Biden should pick up either the Michigan's Gov Gretchen Whitmer,  or New Mexico's Gov Michelle Grisham.
Under President Biden and a Dem Senate, add two justices to correct for McConnell’s dereliction of duty in 2016, which led to the appontment of Justice Gorsuch. Bring the total number of justices to eleven
I’m sure Biden will do just fine, the left don’t need to support Democrats who’ve shown their complete comtempt for us. There are enough brainwashed conservatives to help carry Blue Trump over the finish line.
Your so close   You now have even more confusion condition. Cause That's joe biden state   You Dementia Freak
Did anyone say that Biden was "too ambitious" when he was being vetted?  Seems women are always being held to a different standard.
I'm sure they'll give him a mail-in ballot, too. Ya know, so he can vote for Biden. 🙄
For everyone concerned about Jor Biden feelings, I don't give 0 fucks. Biden will be the leader of the Democratic party, a sitting congressional senator is being targeted in the most racist &amp; sexist manner. He can't remain silent especially when the Black woman is defending him.
Disqualifying. Biden has an embarrassment of riches with the other women on the short list.
Biden's pathetic attempt at pandering to Black voters.
It is mystifying why  Biden’s campaign staff does not understand that fact. You are completely right
Biden is never going to announce a VP 🤣
Obama looks older than Biden lol
nothing like biden taking all of liz's ideas and not making her VP

Yea I disagreed with them. Even though it was obvious Biden was going to win after Super Tuesday, I still think primary voters should have voted for whoever their preferred candidate was. Of course the pandemic through a monkey wrench into everything.
Vote for biden and you get this all over.
I was responding to her getting attacked by Biden supporters. Don’t know why you would think otherwise. Oh wait yes I do. You’re just looking to yell at anyone you disagree with. Have fun with that.
Well said Bill.  In reality, the only candidate running for pres. is Trump - people will either vote for him or against him.  Biden essentially is a non-entity.  Nobody decides that they're voting for Biden because they like what he brings to the table
I’m voting Biden regardless,  but with a lot less enthusiasm if he picks “praising crazy religions” person as  VP.    That’s a deal breaker right there.

Do you think the ACA didn't expand access to healthcare? Or do you think Joe Biden had nothing to do with that? Or do you think Joe Biden has no other ambitions on healthcare?  Is someone lying to you and are you believing their lies? Where do you get these ideas?
Biden got 1% in Iowa in 2008, dropped out and was perfect Veep candidate for Obama.
You're missing one obvious point ... Maybe Biden wants to focus on the domestic dumpster that's going on so having a globetrotting VP/State team is what's needed to rebuild ties with allies.  He's certainly not going to be flying the 1M miles that Hillary did.
Except that half of Florida has  #TrumpVirus and Biden is leading by several points. You are the Minority. Please be the of the Silent ones. 🙄
I guess I'll never get to find out what a defined Biden candidacy looks like
"Joe Biden lies about wanting to increase the minimum wage" "Joe Biden wants to limit access to healthcare"  How did you come to believe these sort of assertions that are so verifiably false?
She is carrying Biden. We NEED Warren. #VPWarren
Biden announced his VP. It's official, and just who we hoped for: the girl reading this.
I get that you're using the "settle for Biden" argument against Bass. But the analogy breaks down because we are essentially in the "primary" phase of the VP selection process, not the general election.
With respect, I think a Hawkins/Walker administration would be in many regards better for me and my students than a Biden/Harris administration.
Biden doesn’t. Trump is the most incompetent, narcissistic, childish imbecile this country has ever elected. My only question is why it took so long for so many to see that?
A Florida teen was arrested in connection with a hack of 130 Twitter accounts, including celebrities like Elon Musk,  Bill Gates and Joseph R. Biden Jr.

I love  but I can't believe that any interview with Dr. Jill Biden could ever be a "great" interview.   One thing is for sure... her appearance on Fox News Tuesday... means that  won't be announcing his VP pick on Tuesday.
If the Biden campaign picks anyone besides Kamala at this point, white supremacy wins.
This whisper campaign against  has to end. I want an ambitious person to be VP.   How many times did  run for Prez — isn’t  he ambitious? And we need someone who CAN and WANTS to run for Prez in 2024 if Biden doesn’t at 82 yrs old! #KamalaHarris #VPHarris
Americans know and trust Joe Biden. Joe’s also always been liked, admired and respected by his Republican colleagues across the aisle. We do want Joe Biden for President, he’ll restore honor, dignity and order to the U.S.A..

In response to Joe Biden's plan to address housing inequity, Donald Trump attempts to stoke a racial panic.

Joe Biden wants to end the era of big companies paying nothing in taxes
The details in the story are not pretty.   Demings spent her police career protecting and serving the Orlando PD as much as the people of Orlando.  The fact that it's a conflict of interest inherent to policing does not make it any less reprehensible.

Chip in to elect Joe Biden and other Democrats on the ballot
FFS Twitter. Joe Biden is not picking crazy Scientology lady, nor is he going to pick crazy demon semen dr.  This is not Trump naming ‘acting’ cabinet positions. Joe will pick somebody trusted, experienced, smart, principled.   He’s picking Kamala Harris, mark my words
Maybe they know instead that if Biden picks a Black woman as VP, all the press will talk about from here on in is busing and "reparations."   It's inevitable, and there will be a number of "gotcha" issues designed to put Biden on the spot.
I'd love it if you could point out where any of us have said that Joe Biden is affirmatively good. I think I've been very clear that he's not. We're acting like a person who wants to expand access to healthcare is better than someone who wants to limit access to healthcare.
Not one mention of Biden in the entire article but like a lemming you just throw out the new catchphrases your masters spoon feed you.  But continue on.
By jumping on this and making it trend without yet knowing all the facts, we are playing right into the hands of the Republicans.  They are just beginning their dirty oppo-research against Biden.

Actually on paper Biden has done more damage to 100s millions of Americans' lives than Trump, Then there's his poor judgement with Foreign policy.   Trump is an idiot, Biden is a good salesman, Equally as dangerous. His record proves my point.

Before Kamala Harris dropped out of the 2020 election, she held the 2nd most Black support based on statistical data, and had the most congressional Black caucus endorsements. This target on her potential nomination by Biden old white dogs is problematic just like Biden silence.
Harris took a cheap and dishonest shot at Biden about busing. It was dumb to bring the topic up as well.  You guys really want busing back for Dems to have to defend?
Both DJT and Biden are racists and fascists. Follow that syllogism when it comes to supporters.
Really? Stop trying to tell us what life in the suburbs is going to be like under Biden, when it couldn’t be worse than what it is under YOUR failed attempts at being president.  What are you doing other than spending your days tweeting and watching tv????

Oh. Now, with a potential Biden victory, you start caring about the debt again. Great.

Elizabeth Warren says 40,000 people are attending the grassroots fundraiser with Joe Biden.  It comes on the end-of-month fundraising deadline.
I've already told you I'm not a Biden voter so I'm not sure what the relevance is of that last sentence. But it's definitely not a "privilege" to expect different things from one party or the other when the parties have different platforms and do different things.
Biden will have a tough time understanding this. Its Good!
Can you read more than one headline? That same poll stated that  "Biden has lengthened his lead over President Trump in the latest Rasmussen Report. The new national survey finds Biden with 48% support among Likely U.S. Voters to Trump’s 42%."
Pole shows three million Americans think Joe Biden is slipping.  Merriam and Webster defines slipping as senile.
Biden needs Harris. She’s tough as nails and no BS.
I think the Secret Service is already working with Jill Biden to select new linen and drapery material.
12) They VOLUNTEER the most. They get others to the polls the most. They talk to their friends about the importance of voting the most. What those conversations look like from ALL women will be determined by how this situation is handled. Will it be "Joe Biden has our back!"?
the idea of picking anyone who is not a national household name seems nuts.  Biden is old.  The reaction to the pick needs to be "well that sounds like someone who could step into the job" and not "who?"
We’re not super far in to be fair but Biden seems perfectly healthy and sound, very far from the senile fading man that the GOP keeps trying to paint him as
My favorite is people who look at biden vs trump and go “ugh, these options suck.”  Like I wish I could live life just making choices between something I like and something I don’t. But alas, here we are, living and shit.

Never said perfect. Just better. Biden is a joke 😂
You should tell Biden to control who old white dogs, not me.
11) Plz help Joe Biden grasp the potential consequences of this course not being corrected. KHive/women will still support him, but it will be less a vote for him than a vote against DT. This matters in the quality of that support. Black woman don't just VOTE Democratic the most
Oy, no, I’m down here now! I need to move and fast. Though I think Florida is gonna go for Biden.
Can we acknowledge that even though neither will bring our country in the right direction, they will not both bring our country in the *same* direction, and Joe Biden's direction is clearly less awful than Donald Trump's direction? Is that not obvious for some reason?
The Biden campaign better hope these smears were some 3D chess level strategy because this shit looks really bad if they do not pick Kamala.  CC:
Their attacks are more motivated by “twitter” supporters of other candidates. The attacks on Kamala’s “ambition” reported in Politico was by “Chris Dodd” (former US Senator) and today’s attack of Biden choosing a “safer” Black woman ... was from “Ed Rendell” (former PA Gov) 🤬😡
Ok this is a bit to much for me. I would like Kamala, I will deal with anyone Biden wants. Now Ms.Bass and scientology No way!! They don't believe in medicine.

One consolation...they will have to use a chunk to rebuild the part that‘s already fallen down. Biden will be in office  before they get to use the rest.
Biden is already an accomplished politician, Good actor, undesirable legislative &amp; voting record. Anyone thinking Biden will make positive transformative changes is either naive or willfully ignorant, Then there are his obvious mental health issues.
I’ve made no public statements about Biden’s VP, this is disqualifing.
Sick and tired of the tropes bandied about by white men labeling women, especially black women, as too ambitious, disloyal and rubbing people the wrong way (code for aggressive). Democrats need to remember that Black Women are the backbone of the party
What about the part where Harris sucks the way Biden sucked in 2008?
Forget about what transpired between Biden &amp; Kamala. Why would u not have issue with a man or men telling a female shes too ambitious? That's a disgrace for a woman to see no harm in that. Tell u something else...WE NEED MORE FEMALE LEADERS. WE WOULDNT BE IN THIS MESS
Not Biden’s choice. It’s Perez.
Biden cannot choose the underhanded Harris, he needs to restore integrity of the VP role, she can’t do that. Rice, Demings, Warren work. I would love Maxine Waters, but Biden gains zero from a CA running mate.
Ultimately, whatever’s in Joe Biden’s heart when it comes to his Catholic faith is between him and the Lord and it’s not my business, but my goodness I cannot stomach this pabulum about how his politics are guided by his deep lifelong grasp of Catholic social teaching
I'm over white men deciding the fate of Black women in America. But I am happy to live during a time to see my momma  speak truth to power. Dodd, get it together and think before you publish.
I don’t think the showdown is going to be Biden vs Trump. It’s gonna be trump/Barr/pompeo &amp; the federalist society/McConnell/Republicans.
If Biden runs with Kamala stfu, stop knit picking, and cast that fucking vote for them.  This is the best we're gonna get. Y'all  have chosen trash significant others over &amp; over again &amp; hit us with "no one is perfect". I don't wanna hear the bullshit from y'all anymore.
Have fun defending this and Bass' comments on Castro. Biden can kiss Florida goodbye if he were to pick Bass.  And not like she brings nationwide name recognition to the ticket either. Little upside. Rice, Lance-Bottoms, Harris, Duckworth, Warren &amp; Demings are all better choices.
That would be a certainty if Biden gets in.  Trump has done great things.
Earlier I mentioned #Bass; she was in Students for a Democratic Society in Cuba multiple times &amp; tried to "bring back the revolution" to the US. Apparently, not a disqualifier for Veep. But #Scientology (rightfully) is! Hey, whatever gets the job done.

What will it take to end this fiction that Biden is the consummate Catholic politician? His umpteenth statement in defense of the right to abortion? Another declaration that he’ll force nuns and other religious believers to fund abortifacients?
Yeah. And if some reporter found out who the pick was like three days before Biden announced, it would be treated like a huge scoop. But who cares? We were going find out anyway.

Just curious - how stupid do you feel now about your April column?
Biden's running mate announcement pushed back, likely will not come next week
Dear Joe Biden, I’m going to take a pass on Demon Semen Karen Bass. Thanks
Joe Biden picking a woman because she is not THAT ambitious would be a mistake...
I hope one of the 1st things President Biden does is to appoint an independent committee made up of Dems. &amp; Repubs. to investigate all the graft in #TraitorTrump's administration starting w/ #TheTrumpCrimeFamily
Whoever Biden picks has to be someone who could credibly be president at any time bc none of us can count on living as long as we might wish these days.
Biden's running mate announcement pushed back, likely will not come next week
There's nothing commonsense about Joe Biden, Biden and his admin will be business as usual, You seem to think people are obligated to join Right-wingers because "Trump bad man" You sound ignorant.   Biden is a serious part of the problem.
I'm at this stage of Kamala Harris coming in 2024, because I don't see it for Biden in November.
Hey #MAGA: too fucking bad  We’re going to drag your cowardly #BunkerBitch out by his wig  You will not stop us
Word is coming out he's already conceded that he can't beat Biden.
I think before BLM Whitmer seemed like an obvious pick. But then some polls came out showing that Biden would actually do worse in Michigan with her on the ticket
Did y’all post Biden needing assistance walking out of a damn building waving like he was drunk.
Voting for Biden is like buying a Subaru: A flight to safety that’s well vetted. Bass is an unknown on the national scene except to insiders and undercuts that message bc now you have to learn something new and decide if she’s what you want from a president.
Kinda like the Ukraine thing showed how Biden extorted the Ukrainian government to NOT indict Hunter and Burisma?  Hey, maybe this  dude kinda knows what he's doing....
If Biden picks someone named Karen in 2020, he deserves to lose.
I’m starting to wonder if these all criticisms of Harris are intended to make Biden look magnanimous when he picks her for VP
James &amp; his wife just gave over a million to Biden &amp; I think it was the Dem Party . About a week ago.
Based on what? That's what people say? Is it a scare tactic to reduce the dems that want to vote for her? Why isn't it a vote for Biden? why is faith in Biden so low that people automatically assume this?   #VoteGold End the insanity cycle.
It’s really just Biden is closer to a George Bush.
spotify is the joe biden of my music career
What if the post man is for Biden and sees the ballot go to a trump house. There’s a lot of variables. And not just against trump. What if someone wants trump and really hates Biden how is that fair to him either?
Hey everyone, when Biden announces his pick and it's not the person you preferred 1) remember that you probably didn't prefer Biden as nominee either, and 2) chill out and keep your eye on the ball.
If Biden wants to go with someone other than Harris this whole horrible mess of the past two weeks have made it likely that if he now picks someone else it will cause a backlash.  I will have a very hard time with another choice because of the treatment of KDH.
8) Joe Biden needs to get a handle on this QUICKLY. He cannot wait two more weeks to deal w/it directly if he holds the VP the announcement that long. He needs to specifically denounce the misogynoir happening &amp; apologize for the fact ANY of it came from within his own circle
Biden is pure trash and I hope they don't choose that disgusting cop as VP, Signed: 7.20pm EST
If Biden wins in November, he needs to sanction the living shit out of Moscow on day one.

Harris talks ambition in women of color after personal attacks during Biden's VP search
Joe Biden does not know what he is. There are many in congress today that believe in socialism and communism including John Lewis the Civil Rights icon. Sorry, I am not ready to move in that direction.
A vote for Biden is a vote for Bernie Sanders' socialism. Don't be "woke". Be AWAKE.
Now we are getting somewhere, Thank you.    Thats fair.. And he is even defending it to this day..  But I would argue.. Even given this.. Is that worse than the state of things today?
We back!!  We discuss Meg Thee Stallion, DMX vs Snoop, I May Destroy You, Draya, Netflix buying a bunch of Black shows, and who Joe Biden should pick as a running mate. Listen, enjoy, and WEAR A MASK!!!
I think she should be the pick, because her attack on Biden showed that she has the killer instinct. That she will hit, hard, when she thinks its necessary. America needs somebody who will go straight through to the back of things.
If Biden picks Bass, I swear...

Hillary Clinton didn't need Jim Clyburn to save her campaign,  she didn't need a rallying call to get Biden to defeat Bernie Sanders but continue .....
Rendell, Dodd and Biden’s own campaign are spreading rumors on Kamala, which means Biden is in on it and really does not want to select her. His surrogates are just doing his dirty work.
I’m Biden’s pick for VP. Surprise!!!
Biden/Harris is unstoppable.
Steve, I don’t follow who is left or right. I’m neither as both suck. The narrative I hear most is that Biden is leading Trump.
This is possibly not newsworthy in the mainstream American media but Indian media is covering this with great interest !!!
Trump isn’t perfect, but he’s 1000000x better than HRC or Biden when it comes to human rights. This was one of his first acts as president.
I didn't vote for a Democrat or Republican in the 2016 presidential election and I won't vote for a Democrat or Republican this time around either. I also live in a state where my vote doesn't matter. That doesn't mean I can't look at Trump and Biden and figure out who is worse.
Remember that time when  predicted  would try to delay the election, and Trump tried to say Biden was acting paranoid, but then Trump said he wanted to move the election? #BidenWasRight
Karen Bass co-signing for Scientology cult. This is who the anonymous old male white rich dudes, the lords of misogynoir, are pushing Biden to pick as v.p. Next. Just pick Kamala Harris &amp; end this rubbish competition.
6) As this mess was allowed to continue unchecked, the VP pick will now be questioned. If it's not Harris, women will assume Joe Biden was threatened by the idea of a strong woman unafraid to challenge him. If she is chosen, pundits will doubtless claim the leaks forced his hand
Several prominent accounts, including those of Joe Biden and Elon Musk, were taken over to promote a cryptocurrency scam in the July 15 incident
Yeeeesh now I really hope she’s not Biden’s VP pick.

Where the fuck is the joy in Biden campaign? He had 20/20 vision to identify Hillary Clinton had a joyless campaign. I know what Hillary Clinton didn't do is remain quiet while a qualified woman in the Democratic party is being dragged for being ambitious. This is one big mess.

KH attacked Biden for being against busing.  Do white suburban parents who support Kamala want to bring back busing? If not, why not?  Because schools are as segregated as ever.  It was an obvious retort, but Joe wasn't sharp enough.
EXACTLY. "Biden allies", "party insiders", "sources close to the former VP" are all just stupid ways of saying ANYONE who had a prominent job as a Democrat in the past 20 years.  Surprised they aren't getting quotes from Leiberman to trash her with.
Doubt it, him and his wife donated to the Biden Victory Fund.
I can think of a talented ambitious woman
Joe Biden said he would be better than Hillary Clinton, that was one big ass lie!
They sure do. I am unfortunately related to some of them.  South Floridian upscale jews who think he’s amazing for Israel &amp; think Biden is an anti-semitic socialist!
Yep, compared to Biden obviously because he's the worst candidate I've ever seen. I'm also not serious with my original tweet but it's funny seeing everyone get mad over the logic they've been touting.
5) KHive trusted Joe Biden w/our primary support. Day-by-day, as we see Kamala Harris be falsely maligned with no response from Biden himself, it makes us question whether Biden will stand up for us as President, if he does not even stand up for his friend and dedicated surrogate

Choosing Kamala Harris has Joe Biden's Vice President is a signal to little girls around the world...that anything and everything is possible.   When little girls look to her as Joe Biden's Vice President, they'll say to themselves, "that can be me."
Yeah, i think its Kamala, my friend. Look, no one is perfect. But we need someone who is tough, modern, young, and a contrast to the boot-licking dunce, Mike Pence. A lot of suburbans are worried Biden is past it and a placeholder for the next POTUS. They wont risk far left
The depth of talent in the Dem Party is formidable. So many great women to choose from. Whomever Biden chooses as his VP will have my complete support!!   And FWIW, I’m ok with anyone in the VP spot rubbing others the “wrong way”.  Trump is a lapdog to every despot out there!
Stand up HOW? a Trade War that costs us billions+decimates farmers?Obama+Biden fixed wrecked economy from LAST GOP admin, gave healthcare to 30 million more Americans, protected pre-existing+contolled Ebola+H1N1.
I’ve been working nonstop since early 2016 to stop trump. Frankly I’m exhausted. Biden dragging out the VP choice when I really need something to inspire me through these last 90 odd days is really horrible for me.
Biden is in on it. He should leave her alone if he doesn’t there to be his VP.
Guys can we nicely try to convince this guy to vote for Biden? 😀
If Biden wins he will be a historic President before even doing anything. VP to the first Black president. President with the first Black VP. Oldest President. And the first person to become President 32 years after first running for the office.
4 more years. #Trump2020Landslide #Trump2020LandslideVictory  #Trump2020 Trump2020 Or it's going to get really ugly.  You think this is bad?  haha...if Biden gets elected, you will learn what "bad" ir "ugly" is.
i hope karen bass becomes biden's vp so the 2020 election will have scientology angle and we get project chanology 2.0.
I agree. But I’m also thinking these people you site, and many I know too, aren’t going to make this election. It’s the independents and Hillary haters from last time that tipped the scale to Trump. Biden is not as hated, especially against Trump.
Did it worked painting Obama as a socialist 2 times? What did worked is America first vs globalists. Independents don’t buy that Biden is a socialist if they do they don’t view it as the extreme version of socialism more like the European version.
"Coalesced" implies coordination.   Clyburn didn't need to coordinate with anyone or get anyone's permission. He simply supported Biden, and Biden won easily.  In this context, the usage of "destroy" is virtually hysterical, implying that something nefarious happened.
Read Joe Biden's Lips: New Taxes
4) We knew pundits would play the "not this black woman, that black woman" game to protect white male supremacy. What we did not foresee is Joe Biden quietly allowing Kamala Harris to be denigrated by any of his advisors, and that this would incur no consequences to them
You should tag  She’s the one in charge of what Biden sees
Does Joe Biden want the next 90 days to be about Benghazi, "Her E-mails," Scientology, and Fidel Castro?  I'm guessing... no.

Sick &amp; tired of white men pitting women against each other &amp; using old sexist, racist &amp; destructive tropes of Black women! They are not doing Joe Biden any favors! Stop now before Black women stay home! ⁦ should quickly pick his VP!
I care about the communities that Biden and Trump will harm, which is why I put in the modicum of effort needed to determine which of those two ghouls would be more harmful. You do know that just because two things are both bad, they are not necessarily equally bad, right?
Isn't that the phase  is also in?  I mean, Bill is probably just nervous from all the news that just came out.  Biden just doesn't know where he is or what he's doing.
White people think they going to lecture me on Biden, you must not know but Biden is only getting my vote because Trump gotta get the fuck out but don't misconstrue that for my support of Biden. I never liked him and never will. Biden was spoon feed this, he didn't earn shit.

Is voting to raise the minimum wage not good? Those are both things that Biden has done. If you truly believe that Biden is in no way good, then it would logically follow that voting to raise the minimum wage is not good.
Nice editing on Biden. Beto did go there (I don't know how much), but he's not the candidate. Biden specifically said otherwise, so, while the editor is brilliant, the ad is just propaganda.
But...you do realize Biden has to declare a running mate *before* the election, right? So we can’t actually vote Trump out before there’s a VP selection; that’s not how this works.
This person need psychiatric help ASAP. Biden will  choose a woman and President Obama will help him pick  that VP. STOP THE BS
Yeah Biden not willing to kill his supporters what a snowflake #TrumpkilledCain #TrumpLiesAmericansDie #snowflaketrunp
It would make sense if trump and Biden WERE the same but they aren’t and you know it and are responding accordingly so thanks for validating exactly what I said, I wish they had this much passion to actually go out and vote
Repubs for Biden are just closet democrats, just too afraid to admit it.
3) The campaign needs to understand if it condones racist patriarchal behavior, it will lose. KHive was riding for Biden before most, tho we understood Kamala may not be picked for the ticket. Our support wasn't contingent on that, though for some the passion of that support was.
This is not the time to start tweeting bs about Biden. VILE trump and his supporters will  pick it up and run. Stop the nonsense about who, what or it. WHY?? Do you want another 4 years of this thing?? I don't think so.
America falls for the looks mostly. If Biden becomes the president he will be the luckiest candidate in a long history...

I’m surprised Biden is only up by 9 &amp; Dems by 10. You would think dooming hundreds of thousands to death and the GOP driving the economy off a cliff &amp; forcing millions into poverty would be unpopular. 🤷🏻‍♀️
Either Donald Trump or Joe Biden will be the President on January 20, 2021. Which one do you prefer?
With each passing day this continues I become more convinced that Biden is behind it. Only one candida is being att led like this. Biden could have stopped it weeks ago. That it has not stopped means he approves of it.
Or even *want* to do that. Joe Biden is a NeoConservative; he’d be appalled at the idea.
Harris is a conversationalist. After Biden is placed in the home she will as president engage us all in conversations. We should think about this and have a conversation about it. This may be better than her implementing crackpot Dem policies🤔

Someone should tell  and Joe Biden. They intentionally divide the moderates and the progressives to keep their donors lining their own purses.
He turned a religious service into a democratic stump speech for Biden. He has no shame. That was a vicious administration for 8 years which ended with a failed coup d etat that he allowed.
I didn’t. I did not support him at all. My pick was Kamala Harris. Actually, Biden’s polling numbers with African Americans is lower than Hillary Clinton’s back in 2016. His numbers will go up by choosing a Black woman. Not a Tammy Duckworth. She’s not about diversity.
Don’t people understand that mail in voting cannot work or be accurate. What if people really want to vote for Biden but their parents put trump down instead. And he wins. It’s not fair on either end. What’s stopping me from taking my neighbors ballots and filling them out.
2) These sexist attacks continue to be put forth by old white men around Joe Biden, and their old white men news buddies happily offer multiple media outlets on which to denigrate Sen. Harris. All in the service of making sure the black woman who's *too* accomplished isn't chosen
As I said, she’s a career diplomat. She only has foreign policy experience. Yes Trump as no experience. That’s why the country is a mess. Because of Trump, he branded Susan Rice. In addition, her son is a Trump supporter. That would be bad for the Biden ticket.
How is it not true? Have you not seen Biden’s mental decay in real time?.. Better do your homework!
Rich investors will be fine if Biden hikes taxes, UBS says #CrainsNY
The fact no one in the Biden campaign is saying anything about Kamala Harris being disrespected in this manner is revealing. Even if she's not his nominee, she's a formidable Democrat who's a qualified &amp; experienced Black woman. You can't be this silent, Black women are watching.
Please consider voting for Biden. It’s not about voting for him. It’s about getting trump out. If trump wins, the Supreme Court could overturn so much stuff that’s really basic rights to cater to the far right.
Bernie supporter always and voted for Trump in 2016.  Won’t make the same mistake this year. Out of question to vote for Biden, I am deeply digusted by what he represents. So abstention thanks for asking
Biden winning lol
I like Karen Bass fine but Biden picking her would be like Hillary picking Tim Kaine all over again.  No thanks. It's Kamala Harris for VP. It better be Kamala Harris
I think your leader, Joe Biden, told you it’s “time to get real.” We’re all hostages to the 1%  in this BS 2Party system.  Time for Progressives to grow a pair &amp; break away!
No. It should be an African American female who represents the demographic that walks the walk for the Democrats, when it comes to voting consistency and voter turn-out. Biden won the Democratic primary due to Clyborn and the Black vote. Trump won because of BernieBros in 2016.
tbh i think it'd mean she'd be president in a few years, i'm like 90% whoever biden's VP is will be, because i feel he's not going to do four years
ironic that once he’s finally elected, President Biden probably won’t remember any of it
So considering that I just linked you to 8 examples of times when Joe Biden voted to increase the minimum wage, do you want to admit that you might have been wrong here?
Signed up for Biden's emails, which I'm already kinda regretting.  One interesting thing: I've got fundraising emails "from" most of the big name VP contenders.  IDK but I have a hunch they'll use that data in in the selection process as a proxy for base trust/ enthusiasm.
She was sh*tting on Biden during the entire campaign trail and his team didn’t forget
You got to the heart of it, Cindy! Biden needs to get us excited to do more than just vote with volunteering and donations- but we’re being turned off by petty attacks on a very worthy female VP pick and we have had enough of women politicians being attacked. 🇺🇸 #KHive
The media starts writing hit pieces on Kamala Harris.   The media points out Joe Biden is “souring” on Kamala Harris.   Two completely unrelated points.
The Biden campaign is getting y’all to vet his VP candidate via Social Media 😂😂😂 and y’all are doing the work. Whewww chillay
Don’t people understand that mail is voting cannot work or be accurate. What if people really want to vote for Biden but their parents put trump down instead. And he wins. It’s not fair on either end. What’s stopping me from taking my neighbors ballots and filling them out.
Hmmm, All these Biden VP leaks that victimizes Harris. Tell me, are they singing all praises and no criticism for any other on the list?
Why is the media worried about Biden when Trump won't able to answer tough questions?  Or easy ones?  Or string two words together to form a coherent sentence?  #butheremails
And there it is!!!Why he sent stormtroopers Into Portland. So he can hold show fear in US. Ironically it is on Trump’s watch, this abhorrent situation happened &amp; he forced it to happen.This won’t happen under Biden. It happened under trump! Biden will absolutely handle it better.
Thank you Tom for being awareness to this subject. Biden is FULLY responsible for this messy as process. He needs to put a muzzle on all his sloppy ass donors and much alike.
NEITHER IS PRESIDENT BIDEN. HE WILL USE THEM TO ROUND UP ALL THE THIEVES IN THE WH.💥💥💥💥💥
Biden has to do X at Y time, Biden did C wrong, so he should chose Candidate B, and so on and so on. I’ve been seeing that since March lol, I would bet that Harris is going to be the VP. Btw, I’m not trying to be mean, I get why ppl r impatient.
is a liar
Wrong-o.  Several other polls echoing the same sentiment - Warren nets the most new support overall, in every demo, and in swings with undecideds. The numbers don’t lie, GOP is terrified of her and playing down her chances...
These American voters are not "intimidated" by   Joe Biden’s 'you ain't black' comment is voter intimidation
VPs typically aren’t announced until the week before the convention, which appears to be Biden’s timeline

And u never will. These asshole pollsters know who to call. They’re slick. Trump is beating Biden hands down. America doesn’t want an old progressive president and a VP picked because the color of their skin. Skin color doesn’t qualify anyone. We saw that for 8 yrs before.
"I mean, you got the first mainstream African-American who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice-looking guy," Biden said. "I mean, that's a storybook, man

Yeah, I understand that. Hillary would of been President right now if it wasn’t. But what does criticizing Biden have to do with gossip politico articles when all the serious people in the process signed NDA’s? Remember, most people don’t care about VP, so whatever Biden has...
- There will be no change until after the election. At that point, either Biden will be president or Trump will be free to admit that he made a mistake and correct course. Even though Trump is psychologically incapable of admitting that he made a mistake, he may find a scapegoat.

Can’t understand why he would let her hang out that there like that. She’s wonderfully talented,a joyful warrior. The attacks are painting her as something else. Biden shouldn’t let that happen to anyone on his short list. Certainly not someone working as hard for him as she has.

You said, “You mock but it’s true.” Only someone who believes that would vote for someone who is mentally failing like Joe Biden. Now what does not seeing race or gender have to do with Apple’s cash?
I think the collapsed economy is Warren's calling. Biden is already strong on Foreign Policy so Rice is not necessary. She could rebuild the State Department though. That's needed.  Harris has an opportunity to rebuild the AG with actual uncorrupted justice in mind. If she wants.

ugh on #KarenBass  had to look her up, too Progressive, too pro-Castro crap. 2018 Midterms elected 39 new moderate D's to 2 new Progressives. Giving in to those yelling the loudest isn't the right thing to do. I'll still vote for Biden, but would be hugely disappointed.

Yeah in 2008, Hillary Clinton and Obama went to June.  Yeah in 2016, Hillary Clinton and Sanders went to June.   So I find it stupid for Biden who had this wrapped up in March, waited all these months to announce..  I fucking know Twitter is not real world,  ugh..smh

really? nothing wrong with Biden? the guy is totally lost. Old and barely able to articulate a simple thought without teleprompter
Ed Rendell was wrong when he advised Al Gore to concede. And he's DEAD wrong on this. The Old guard ALWAYS afraid of the new blood. Either way that's a lame excuse. Biden / Harris 2020
i don’t understand how this keeps becoming biden / trump - i’m talking in generality &amp; thinking more about what happens when protests become violent - the person who helps to de-arrest you doesn’t have to share your politics to be your ally in that moment etc etc
Had to check this. Did  praise..... Scientology?  Er.... yes, she did. Scientology and Castro. #Wining
These Kamala hit pieces seem really counter productive if you’re trying to keep her from being VP. They’re just pissing everyone off and making people want to defend her. Not to mention if Biden doesn’t pick her he’s going to seem like he’s buying into the egregious misogynoir
I’m so pissed.  If it’s not Harris, Biden + his VP gets my vote on 11/3.  My time, energy and $$ will be spent elsewhere.
A Trump supporter I know who is openly racist and anti-LGBTQ said that he's had enough of Trumps lies, doing nothing except for the wealthy and his disrespect of the military that he will be voting for Biden. I don't agree with his beliefs but I agree 💯% with his vote.

Obama's grandfather's record:   Joe's sons Beau &amp; Hunter both served (NG/Navy).   Took 2 minutes to fact check your dumb post. If you had spent 2 minutes, you'd have GOOD DIRT on Biden's son's military history, but 2 minutes is too much work for shitposting
Swerve everybody and get one with old biden instead
Biden IS the other choice.  You are right.
Yup.  Then a “bustling, heroic save of the economy by Biden” with +.1% SPX days, 1.50 rates, stagnating GDP and declining dollar
Mark this: the craziest part of Biden’s win in November won’t be the fact he won but the fact he will do virtually everything trump was already doing and regarded as a hero for it
With all respect, in 95 days we will have a chance to save our nation.  After that, you and Potus Biden will begin to heal this country.
You are co-signing on all the people that will suffer under a Biden presidency. I'm not voting for either authoritarian corporatist because both of them are shitty people and as a non shitty person I have no interest in helping them do so.
Biden has dementia &amp; you’re backing him! Enough said.
I'm not voting for Biden because he's Biden not because he isn't Bernie, and no refusing to vote for corporate authoritarians does not make me a bad person. Your plain as day voter harassment however does make you a shitty person.
Karen Bass is a double whammy. She is a Castro-sympathizer and a Scientology supporter! Hell no! Joe Biden needs to pick Kamala or Susan Rice and stop with the reality TV antics!
But think about it. Why? Why them? They want to save the gop, they know if they can purge the trumpists they can “return to normal” (loud parts quiet again) and saddle joe biden with the burden of cleaning up this mess. The party would collapse under a second trump term (1/2)
So you don't care about the people that will suffer under a Biden regime?
Thank you sir! Let's hope Biden can build on this in 2021! United we stand!
Have you forgotten the Joe Biden/Tara Reid situation already?
. Biden Rule: "No Men Need Apply!"
I mean she didn't get any traction in her home state and she didn't even make it to Iowa... seems like a perfect pick for a candidate like Biden.
Joe Biden has always said he’s announce his VP pick early August. He’s never said otherwise, just because people insist on speculation, that’s not his problem.
Is this Trump being prepped for his lobotomy?  That’s the only thing that might save our nation until Joe Biden is elected.
I listed the three primary factors depressing turnout as Biden, his party, and Democratic voters like him. I never said no one is going to be voting for Biden I explained specifically why I believe the people who won't be voting for him aren't.
"What’s strange about this recycled attack line...is that polling shows it’s not just generally failing, but failing with the very voters it’s supposed to be frightening back to Trump."
We are so blessed as a nation to have President Trump at the helm.   In these challenging times we can count on the proven leadership of President Trump!  Let's face it! Biden is a nightmare!  He's being exploited by the Democrats.  How shameful!
Facts don't care about your feelings. Have fun voting for Weekend at Biden's. He's a puppet for your communist party.
You lier the trump administration wants to give businesses millions and the people  1200 dollars come on can’t wait until november Biden all the way
Biden is within the margin of error in several swing states, no guarantee he wins.
I'm in the same boat. I think Dems win Loeffer and Ernst's seat. I just look forward to Nov 6 when McConnell asks why 'President Biden has let so many people die of Covid19 as president the American people expect more' and I turn into a nuclear blast from rage

Way down at the bottom.
Bombed Libya to point it turned into a failed state &amp; its citizens were sold into slavery. Armed terrorists to topple Assad in Syria, facilitated coup in Honduras. Among other BS, Biden has done almost nothing positive in 44 consecutive years in government.
Karen Bass will be 70 after Biden’s first term. That would put her at 78 if she wins and completes the next two terms as president. I want someone younger.
If you hate Trump- OK.. voting for Biden out of pure bias and no logic is a despicable act.
Educate yourself on Biden's 44 year record.
I hope this flies too. What I like here,  Trump's latest attacks on Biden are also the old ones that didn't work.
New Polls Show Trump Gaining Ground On Biden In Battleground States
None of the above. I prefer Hillary Rodham Clinton; she’s more qualified than any of the other possible VP candidates, and she has a long record on getting things actually done! But regardless of who becomes VP I’m voting for Biden this November! #HillaryforVP #Biden2020
I hope this flies too. What I like here, and Biden knows, that most people will see through Trump.
I hope this flies. What I like here, and Biden is aware of, voting, national crosses, from a historical perspective.
Biden is a fascist.
We are not voting for Biden or Trump.
The only people depressing turnout are Biden, the DNC, and people like you.
in all he years of being involved in politics  I have never seen such a close up on who will be VP for Biden.
Watching a piece on  and I’m Impressed. Ok no one is perfect- no matter who #Biden picks- but anyone is better than #MikePence
Here’s the thing. It’s not up to anyone but Joe Biden who he picks.
I’ve met Ed Rendell a few times. There are things I like about him. That being said, his opinion on Biden’s VP could not be much lower on the list of relevant viewpoints.
the Biden veepstakes are pretty telling I reckon. the guy is lazy and indecisive, his administration is liable to be a mess. good thing he doesn't have to deal with any big problems
My daughter in DE says her neighbor’s Trump sign is repeatedly stolen or vandalized. That’s Biden country.
I bet you feel real big retweeting that Trump is the worst President ever.  Cool bro.  Real stand up citizenry.  Enjoy another 4 more years, and I wish you the best.   Biden has become exceedingly wealthy as a lifelong politician, while accomplishing what, exactly?
I miss those Obama/Biden memes.
With Warren as VP maybe Biden can finish third in Massachusetts.
this ones FROM texas lol
Ps - one of those 3 states trump has basically ceded to buden and all 3 are being won by biden as is.
My thoughts on who Biden picks is simple...it doesn’t really matter because everyone will have a problem of some sort. He could pick the second coming and people would still find something negative to jump on.

Also young Joe Biden tank!
We love Joe Biden!🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
Must-read from  "The same distortions used in previous ads...All these attacks are the same old warmed-over nonsense. But they’re particularly off-point right now. Which again suggests the Trump campaign just doesn’t have a good argument."
Biden/Bass isn’t a winning ticket.
Joe Biden doesn't care about black lives.
Even though I will be voting for Joe Biden come hell or high water I’m staring to get annoyed that he hasn’t picked someone already. I feel like we’re getting jerked around.
I mean I’m not sure what would be a good choice at this point  Biden sucks (I’m voting for him but we can admit it here) and there isn’t necessarily a VP that would change that fact
I’m central NJ too

DENNY LIVE TELLS JOE BIDEN THE REAL TRUTH ABOUT WHY BLACK PEOPLE ARE VOTING FOR HIM!
hahahaha. do me a favor and record your face when you look up Biden's history with Presidential Primaries
A more striking fact is that drumpf and pence are White males but this ad attacks Biden for his intent to have a Black woman on his ticket... Just how stupid do they think this country is?
She’s been fantastic. I hope Biden selects her
As this video shows, Obama and Biden are war criminals who made money for billionaire-owned companies that manufacture weapons, deploy private-contract soldiers, get paid to rebuild bombed countries, and steal the oil.  They’re just like Trump!
Don’t we need an ambitious VP for Biden. This person needs to be ready to step up
the fact that a 17 year old hacked Ye, Obama, Biden, Elon is crazy
If someone said Ralph Nader can rub people the wrong way is he anti-Lebanese.  To say that Ed Rendell is a misogynist is based on one sentence.  That is certain a biased evaluation.  He was a very good mayor — I want him and Biden to reach out to Bass and Dr. Judith Rodin ASAP!
They are waiting for Biden before they push this as a treatment.  Headlines will be “Biden’s push for HCQ saves millions of lives costing virtually nothing for those needing treatment”.

Biden and the DNC
They obviously found out he is a Biden supporter.  They need his vote
Now we know of how Biden can get more than 12 people to show up to see him.
There is no chance that the DNC will replace Biden.  DSA members really need to stop supporting candidates who run as Democrats.
Karen Bass’s Long March from Communist Fringe to Biden’s VP Shortlist
So when's the Biden VP announcement coming?
Joy lied on the only person Biden wanted and now tweets this.
Word on the street is that people are trying to derail  as Biden’s pick because she’s too “ambitious” and would be “campaigning for president day one.”  If that isn’t the most sexist shit I’ve ever heard.  Im over men.  Give this queen her due. #BidenHarris2020
Ed Rendell thinks Santa Claus rubs people the wrong way so maybe Joe Biden should take his opinion with a grain of salt.
There have been several high profile dems that have said kamala is “too ambitious” amongst other things &amp; imho is getting treated unfairly by dems and press (like Hillary). Biden pushed back his vp announcement &amp; I hope he’s not taking this “too ambitious” nonsense into account.
Who should Biden pick for VP?
...Karen Bass (who they're really pushing in the trial balloons) or Susan Rice, who are both excellent but also I could see them drawing primary challenges from the Bernie/AOC left in 2024 (or '28 if Biden is feeling it). The Dems are still not "an organized political party"
I think Biden really thought he was picking Klob before the George Floyd protests blew up. Harris is the obvious choice except all the old men he listens to (and maybe his wife) think she's too "pushy." So now he's going to pick someone he's "comfortable" with, probably...
Biden is a Bubba, not Obama lite  via
I think Trump,himself, decided not to attend Lewis’s lying in State in the Capital. Biden went. Many people attended some &amp; not all. I felt the day of the funeral, Trump might decide he did not want to be left out, &amp; insinuate himself. I was extremely relieved not to see him.
I respect Ed Rendell however I 100 percent disagree with him regarding Kamala Harris. I think she would be an excellent choice for VP. Anyone who Biden picks is a better option than Mike Pence. #KamalaHarrisForVP
If that was trump and not bill it would be on every channel. Even Cartoon Network would be talking about it. Since the girl said Trump never partaked though... they don’t care. Wait til Biden shows up in the papers.
It is a really bad look to lobby against Kamala Harris because she’s “too ambitious”. I’ve been donating regularly to the Biden campaign. Only good reason to oppose a pick is if it hurts the ticket.
This SHOULD be the top criteria as this piece I edited for  illuminated:

Maybe Biden's trying to talk Michelle into running.
I mean, I've said it before, but in their election bid against Corbyn's Labour Party the Tories ran on *expanding* *socialized* *medicine* in the UK. I'd have still voted for Corbyn, but you have to given that favorable points compared to Biden &amp; the DNC.

Personally I dont give a f*ck about who is crushing who. How about we stop beating out chest and make something happen. To be honest. Polls shouldnt be close. You should not be surprised. I think Biden forgot he was running anyway. Politics cant be personal when it effects us
Biden, who was elected to 7 terms (served 36 yrs. total) as a U.S. Senator, was in his 1st term in 1976.

Can't speak for  but I'm certainly hoping that, w/ or w/o a pre-election pledge to be 1-term, Biden realizes that he's not in shape to be president from age 78-82, and so 82-86 is out of the question. Need a VP who'll be ready to run w/ minimal primary oppo in '24
Ed Rendel going to the press smells of "If Biden won't listen to me, let's see if I can make some bad press to change his mind"
I secretly wish that Biden was woke enough to blow up this #WhatsAppGate to similar proportions as Trump did with Hillary’s emails; if only just to mess with him
Lol. What is he left on? Name one leftist policy 🤣  Would you rank them: Bernie, Biden, Mao, Stalin? In that order?
hot take Biden shouldn't pick Harris or Bass he should pick Tammy Duckworth or Terri Sewell

Speaking only for myself:  The populist, identity politics of Kamala have always given me the opinion that she's the "Trump of the Left" (far more intelligent, though).  I'd want nothing to do with that, so much so that a likely vote from me for Biden would go out the window.
It’s hard to see in this drive by photo but this duplex in OCNJ had Trump flags up top and Biden flags below. We were fascinated!

To spread doubt about the election, I wouldn't be surprised if some local Republican officials in a very red county cast bogus ballots for Biden, which would be quickly discovered, but might raise support Trump's claims about voter fraud. A lot of Roger Stones still out there.

yeah but ... if they're even voting for Biden.. does it matter who VP is really?
To me this suggests she's essentially already the pick and these are last gasp efforts to force Biden's hand.
BBBBBBOOM ! AND JOE BIDEN IS DOWN HE'S DOWN THAT HIT MIGHT HAVE TAKEN HIM OUT 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Biden didn't crack 15% in Iowa. Others had to bail-out, Yang included.  DNC didn't want to risk a 1st timer losing to an incumbent, it would cripple them politically.  Mayor Pete's next primary opponent, would only need the easy line of "This guy couldn't even beat Trump".
Stop and think for a second. We are entering a national election in less than 100 days. No debates? No rally’s!  seems hunter Biden scandal is gone along with the flu. Fight for mail in voting. Where are the studies HCQ works for covid 19. Americans are being played.
I agree he was a great man who has passed,but to turn a eulogy into a political campaign is wrong,its similar to what Biden and other public officials did at George Floyd's funeral,now in no way am I comparing the life of Floyd to Lewis,as far as i'm concerned there isn't any
I just think not acknowledging she is being overly criticized is dishonest...even that Ari Melber thing...He created a whole “series” just to dig at her...he said they’d be discussing ALL contenders, Biden may be announcing tomorrow...and that’s how this whole primary has been
Why...because deciding between Yang, Biden and Trump needs 95 days of pondering?
Sean, can you guys kindly consider a return to your previous format for election comparison? This is really tough on the eyes.
Obama Biden. Hillary. Gym Jordon. Orange Dumpling.
Biden should pick someone who can be a true partner as his VP, as he was. There are a number of great candidates. That said, I think the people in his circle criticizing Harris as “too ambitious” are underestimating his personal appeal and ability to lead, and Harris’ character.Says the fkn nit wit who is all in on Biden... being humiliated is a way of life for these people
Hey Mike.  I've dropped some bucks on ByeDon2020 merch and like it.  But does any of the money go to the Biden campaign? I like the stuff, but need Biden to win.

If Biden runs with Kamala stfu, stop knit picking, and cast that fucking vote for them.  This is the best we're gonna get. Y'all  have chosen trash significant others over &amp; over again &amp; hit us with "no one is perfect". I don't wanna hear the bullshit from y'all anymore.

Assuming Biden becomes POTUS, which I know we shouldn't count on despite polling and everything, I really hope he makes for a very boring one who predicts his interests long in advance, does no stunts, and where we'd need to tune in to hear to the White House.

The attack on Biden was a necessary wake up call for him.  He should be thanking her, not expecting her to apologize.  Her prosecutorial record is strong.  Most people like prosecutors who helped lock up killers and rapists.
And your concern shouldn't be me, it should be people that are for more liberal and far more progressive, with huge platforms, like  who despise Trump and all he stands for and are still not voting for Biden and are telling there millions of subscribers that.
If you want Joe Biden’s VP, president of the US then vote for him.  He will be deemed unfit mentally within three months if he gets elected.  Let that sink in. Know who you are voting for.
This leftward pivot is amazon, how will Biden recover
🤣🤣🤣 bumper sticker
If Biden is elected, the left will turn against him in a minute once he does one thing they don’t like. He’ll pander for a while, but eventually lefties will turn against him, because they’re never satisfied. Their issues change every week.
The only time the wealthy and powerful face consequences is when they fuck with other wealthy and powerful people. That's why Bernie Madoff and that Pharma Bro a-hole are in the clink while Mnuchin holds govt office and Jamie Dimon is an advisor to Biden.
I’m voting Trump but he isn’t helping matters by saying he wants to postpone the election for some reason. Now all Biden has to do is hide in the basement and he’ll look better than Trump who is constantly making statements that piss people off. Seriously, I want Trump to win.
If Biden gets in, numbers will be reported per 1000 or 100,000 and the graph will look a lot different.  How cases and deaths are counted will actually change as well.  No more MC crash victims counted as CV or the same person testing positive more than once as multiple cases.
Bernie was my 1st choice.   I agree with many of your positions.   But, How important is it that Biden beats Trump?
Good to see he's not just mailing it in now that he's a lame duck.
Yes what Biden did with H1N1???
Sounds exactly like potus at a presser.
Then you know the signs as well. If you want to vote for Biden, then do so. But don’t be in denial about what’s happening to him or be surprised when he can’t finish his term.
Yes but the facts of what HE DID &amp; how HE RAN the entire corrupt operation &amp; how HE CONNECTS to other people’s indictments NEEDS TO BE REPEATED AD NAUSEUM.  Let joe Biden claim innocence. He’s lying. We know he was in the January 5th meeting.
Sure, and there were times with my dad where you would never know anything was wrong either. Then there were times, like with Biden; when it was very obvious.
Biden is 2-3 years away from having severe cognitive decline. That’s unfortunate. But it’s the reality. Not finding the right words and losing your train of thought so you just run off on a tangent is mild to moderate signs of dementia.
You like your own comments often?
Is this disturbing information accurate?
And by the way, saying it’s a binary choice while ignoring all other aspects of the candidate that you believe represents democracy is a very dangerous precedent to set. I don’t use my vote to vote against someone and Joe Biden won’t have the mental capacity to run the country.
That’s you. Right? You’re explaining yourself right? Because I believe all the Clinton stuff no problem but you believe every girl except the ones against trump. Why is that?
Okayy so we’re getting somewhere... you’re delusional
Did I reply to you? No I refuse to talk to annoying adult children
And uhm sir, you’re still defending a rapist right this very minute. So let’s turn this conversation to what’s wrong with you personally to support a child rapist? Are you okayy?
Republicans project so much like how are democrats hypocrites when we HAVE BEEN CALLING TO ARREST ALL THESE PEOPLE. We all just found out &amp; we want all of them arrested. But why can’t republicans say arrest trump too when he is clearly one of the most involved?
It’s all about pushing the Democratic agenda! I am sure that if Creepy Joe Biden wins they will have a vaccine or even down play Covid19. Thanks to the media &amp; Democrats for attempting to destroy the greatest nation in the world &amp; then try to blame President Trump.
While most would like Kamala Harris as Biden’s VP. Susan Rice is a better choice. Harris is more suited for the Supreme Court. In my opinion.
She is not far to left.  She is a neoliberal. She was against Bernie Sanders. She likes Joe Biden not left at all. Just neoliberal
Am I to assume anyone who supports Biden is a pehdofile?......
So you said that there will be voter fraud with this year’s election if Biden wins so I’m curious, would you still think it’s fraud if you win🤔🤔🤔
You definitely want Biden to win. In the old days you would be tarred and feathered
lol yeah, people change like how Clinton, Obama and Biden were against gay marriage &amp; illegal immigration......or they do whatever for votes
Pos never loved our country.a biden presidency is an extension of transforming America which was only to kick down the columns of law that lifted us up for 2 hundred + yrs. Designed to Ensure that americans are victims of policies they've enacted. THINK! Whose benefiting? Not us!
I am not a fan of Trump but he'll have to do until someone better comes along and Joe "im a potato, wheres my car dude, head" Biden isnt it.
I know that settle for Biden site isn't like an official site but it's still some of the most depraved shit I've ever seen
i know. but biden's selected people are war hawks and they hate russia.   china has (in my estimate) 1000+ spies in US companies. no one seems to care about that!
if Biden wins -   they plan to take back Crimea and Donbass region  need the metals to secure bolshevik influence in the area
Tell that to Joe Biden because he wants to arrest them.
Joe “I pushed Thomas forward and attacked Anita Hill” Biden Joe “I voted for Scalia and fought for segregation” Crow Biden
khive is so toxic on here.  i would have probably voted for biden if it weren’t for them.   i guess i’ll just write in hillary this year.
See this is hoW we lose converts to the cause. Bottom line HE'S NOT VOTING FOR TRUMP HE'S VOTING FOR BIDEN. STOP SHAMING AND WELCOME ANYONE WHO WILL SUPPORT JOE FOR WHATEVER THERE REASON IS. Dam man what r u trying to do make sure he doesn't vote at all???? JUST STOP.
Not Joe Biden
Joe Biden Disses Kanye West + Donald Trump: "You Won't Have To Worry About My Tweets When I'm President"
Most of this speculation is a nonsense. You underestimate the crowds marching in every City. And not 100% Republicans are idiots, many of them will vote. There is nothing in voting laws about minimum voters, or which result looks suspicious. Biden/Trump 82/15 it's fine with me.
fight like biden is still coherent
You do realize that parties clueless Democrats because you put up a man is senile ( BIDEN) and absolutely has the mind of a kindergartner ( Biden) and yet can’t hold his own weight if it was given to him (BIDEN) by a spoonful
Nunes getting dirt on Biden from a pro-Russian Ukrainian.   Sounds extremely disturbing.   Is anyone going to investigate Trump sycophant Nunes?  Or does the creep get a free pass?
Biden Goes Into Blank Stare After Forgetting Where He Is, Tries and Fails To Pass It Off as Joke
In April, Joe Biden predicted Trump would try and delay election.  You better hide in your bunker.
There’s an independent woman named jo Jorgensen. Best overall canidate, better than Biden and trump. So no, it’s not choosing trump or America by voting democrat.
Do you want to save the integrity of the 2020 election?  1.  Register to vote and make sure EVERYONE you know under 18 does the same  2.  VOTE BIDEN.  Vote EARLY.  3.  MAKE SURE TO VOTE YOUR CONSCIOUS  4.  VOTE FOR RUTH BADER GINSBERG
And what did Obama ever in his and Biden’s 8 years REALLY DO FOR BLACK PEOPLE OTHER THAN THROW FREE STUFF and lots of BS. #TRUMP2020USAWAKEUPORDIE #BLEXIT #WALKAWAY
Love party unity! Love all the concessions team Biden is making!
I’m glad Obama reared his ugly racist head. Only the dull and uninformed pay attention to his drivel but it reminds people what they get with Biden.
Biden will lose Because of Biden  PERIODT
Yes. Biden 2020
I voted for him twice but now that I know how duplicitous he is I have serious doubts. MSM, FBI, etc were all in on it and I’m a disgusted Dem. I don’t like Trump but Biden is out of it. Should I just not vote?
wants to do a zoom comedy benefit for Joe Biden! Who'd go? Who'd like to perform? Feel free to share! I'd go.
Next time try not making so many things up. I hope it's a Biden/Rice or Biden/Duckworth ticket, but I never had the slightest intent to vote for Trump. He's almost uniquely bad for the nation.
You have a very narrow notion of what these voters look like and it leads you into error. I am a technocratic socialist. I have never yet voted for a republican president, despite thinking some of their candidates were good people. It was obvious to me I'd vote for Biden long ago
like i tell my kids stop lying , your not good at it!someone needs to tell that to the democrats. They look desperate and obvious.Biden says Trump wont leave if he looses, sounds like he has a trick up his sleeve,but cant remember which sleeve.
Joe Biden is going to win BIG
That's only true if you're Joe Biden and the Democrats
I have seen this before from a lot of people who say it isn’t going to Biden and honestly when he says this they react like oh voter suppression so by this point idc haha plus every counties politics are messy
Biden can’t change his own diaper. He gets his Chinese friends to help him.
there’s no way Biden is going two terms. he should absolutely pick someone young who’s going to run for president in 2024. remember when VP’s ran for president and weren’t just... there? odd how Gore was the last one
Biden has 0 Enthusiasm! TRUMP ALL THE WAY!
If Biden wins there will be lines at the gyms and tanning solons. The next day. Like magic.
wants to do a zoom comedy benefit for Joe Biden? Who'd go? Who'd like to perform? Feel free to share! I'd go.
They won’t, and they’ll call the cops on you like Biden if you do.
Lectures a President of three and a half years?! 45 years in politics, and what has he done?? Like Joe Biden, he says that he can fix everything now!?
Biden is not a fascist authoritarian. See the diff now? Biden knows that Congress chooses the electors &amp; date &amp; time of election, only.
Thought you could barely tell the difference between Trump &amp; Biden.  A lot changed in...a day.
Trump would be funnier if only because Biden being president is the scariest thing since Al Gore
How Hunter Biden isn’t in federal prison yet is beyond belief.....BUT he will be one day for sure 100%
I’ll be proud to vote for or whomever Biden picks.
If Biden wins, then in four years he will run as the incumbent against whatever shitstain candidate the GOP digs out of its garbage pile. So we’ll have at least another four years to wait. 😕
He was for same sex marriage before Obama, so I'm willing to give him a chance. And Biden was VP for conservative voters. It was his experience in DC &amp; Obama's inexperience.
You mean the justice system which Joe Biden has had authority over for 50 years?  The justice department Obama was in control of for 8 years?  Damn how disappointed you must be in those guys
They're delusional..Biden since 😏 apologized AND walk the walk AND talk..unlike some people, I don't take responsibility for Jack 🌏🇺🇸
Obama is "clean and articulate". " Poor kids are as smart as white kids". "You ain't black" if you don't vote for me. "You can't go in a 7-11 without a slight Indian accent". Trump statements? Nope. ALL things Biden said.
Biden's supporters are violent misogynists.  needs to get his people under control.
Who's surprised at the "delay the election" bullshit?  He's getting desperate.  It's getting close and he knows he's failing miserably.  We should all ignore him as much as possible - he thrives on attention.  Make sure you're registered, make sure you vote Biden 11/3/20.
So here's the question. Does anyone realize who will be running the country if  Biden took office ??  Answer . Pelosi and company
As Biden Gutting The US Coal Industry, His Son Cashed In With China
Isn't fair it to say that Biden is a step in the right direction?  Since option #2 is a psychotic criminal, the bar is pretty low.  I agree with all of your positions.   Are you suggesting that there is an option # 3?
No he wont, Biden cant even put together a coherent sentence let alone run a country, why didnt he fix it all 12 years ago with Obama?
“I had about 95,000 positive retweets on that” -  🙃🙃🙃
Democracy will not prevail not with Biden, sorry Dad you're solely mistaken..
The media is so dumb they just guaranteed Biden can’t delay the election. Ha ha ha
if I were POTUS I wouldn't fill my diaper when the polls show me getting pummeled by the empty chamber that houses what remains of Joe Biden's life force. does it even bother you that this guy ice cream-scooped the GOP's brains and then drove it around like a bumper car?
Shucky is a dead ducky
Isn’t the deranged orange orangutan not taking it seriously enough for people? If Biden wins we’ll all be wearing full hazmat suits.
Why don't you highlight everything good that he has done. And everything that Biden failed to do with over 45 years working for the government which is significantly more than Trump.
You should of never backed Biden. The DNC should of realized they made a mistake
Like I don't know what more I have to say to these ppl, even hilary lost they blamed the Progressives for it.  You think if she would of won they would give us the credit.  No they wouldn't.  Same with biden, how is this hard to understand
Biden and any other politician from either side of the aisle, should stand firmly against even the notion of such a constitutional violation by #Chump.
He would leave, but luckily he’s going to bury Biden this time around .. popular vote and electoral vote both going Trump’s way ... then, the real party that can’t accept election results, the Dems, will come up with more excuses and lies to attempt to delegitimize the results
i used to love bernie until he told me to support the warlord pedophile Joe Biden
only if biden puts a white male on the ticket   then i think we are done
Trump is a whole bowl of shit and biden is just half a bowl of shit. I refuse to eat it, and you all are saying you'll just eat the half bowl... and trying to convince me to do so..... and trying to get others to do so as well.
Let me look into your future...I see...I see....crying...yelling at the sky...snot bubbles...And a Joe Biden tank top discarded on top of a pile of “I’m With Her!” Bumper stickers....
Trump Repeals Obama-Biden Rule: Suburbanites ‘Will No Longer Be’ ‘Hurt’ By ‘Low Income Housing’ Built In Neighborhoods
I want every person in Congress on record about this. Every, “don’t tread on me.” Every, “wearing a mask infringes on my rights.” Because if you say that or are an elected official and you condone delaying a presidential election, you stand for nothing.
MI Swing Voters Say They Are Voting for Trump, Call Biden a 'Puppet'
The Democrats/media are criminals. They have attempted to nullify my vote for four years. They cannot be allowed to cheat.  Going back to the criminality and disastrous foreign and domestic policies of Obama/Biden will be the end of the country.
also, #45 is pissed  is whooping his orange butt in the polls! if the election were today, Biden would be our next President! #VoteJoeBidenToSaveAmerica
Has Russia taken over any countries? No, He is not weak like Obama/Biden. Has he cut back any sanctions? No , Did he kill Russian mercenaries in Syria? Yes, Has Russia expanded anywhere? No
Biden's Lies for Black (and White-Privilege Guilt) Votes
Your fucking plan is not going to work. That public pressure is going to be like a gentle breeze in the summer to biden. It won't phase him at all. Your plan is like putting a square peg in a circle, its not going to happen.  My plan is to withhold my vote
and Biden's gonna turn over world power to China!  Well Hunter already got paid by them so he doesn't care!
Biden has dementia it’s obvious
Biden/Warren! Let’s go!
Chill Out pfffft Please, she clearly states that she will not endorse Biden...READ!
Dude just stop. Move on to your next conspiracy theory. How about this, Aliens from Uranus are trying to take over America and Biden is their leader. Your #MAGA cult will eat that up!
Good news! There’s one available to all of us on the ballot in November’s election...Mr. Joe Biden. 🇺🇸
Biden policies are bad for any industry. Period If you disagree live the policies. Strip your life of every offending action. Heating  coolin refrigeration travel meds. Buy yourself a horse dig a well and throw away your Iphone. Giddyup! Practice what u preach $ where mouth is
Im not settling for biden because if I do, these literally no point in being on the left. Just settle for who ever runs on the democratic ticket for the rest of your life.
That’s more than Obama did in 8 yrs and way more than Biden’s done in 50 yrs.  so I guess if this is a real issue for you, we can count on you voting Trump in November?
Biden’s been there 50 yrs, Trumps been there 3, you might want to check what trumps actually done, might surprise you
How disappointed you must be in Obama.  He had 8 yrs where he could have stopped what you describe and didn’t.  Biden’s been there 50 yrs!
Wait are you saying there’s systemic racism in Chicago?  The city with a black mayor and whose been run by liberal democrats since al Capone?  Are saying after 50 yrs in congress Biden hasn’t stopped systemic racism?
Good morning mr.joe these Republicans have no commonsense of wearing a mask plus trump is sort of a terrorist he doesn't care about the 150,000 and counting people who have died from this virus he's nothing more than a sorry soul.Biden for president 🇺🇸🙏🏻👍
I mean NOTHING!!!!! Biden could wear a dress, decide to call himself Daffy Duck, I’m STILL voting for him!!!
Chip in , even if a few weeks ago we said Biden is mentally deteriorating, We now believe he’s better . Donate to our cash grab .
Patriots we need your money . This guy even knows Biden is a mental midget and can’t win ...but wants your cash
If Biden gets voted in God Forbid then Barr would resign
How did he get this far in the election like you really can’t be serious when you say your going to vote for Biden
Please dont endorse Biden....
This is exactly right, if Biden wins the AOC Marxists run this country, what’s happening in Portland and Seattle will come to all of us, our history and Western Culture will be finished off for good. #TrumpNowMoreThanEver2020  #BLMDomesticTerrorists

I recomded Joe Biden as a Presidential candidate to d DNC Chair Bill Clinton bcz he expedited my green card n fixed problems at Newark INS.
I recomded Joe Biden as a Presidential candidate to d DNC Chair Bill Clinton bcz he expedited my green card n fixed problems at Newark INS.
Exactly. So when Biden announces his Veep, he could also announce his cabinet to mitigate that disappointment and remove some of the undue attention on the VP pick.
Madame Tussaud's Wax Museum has a Joe Biden wax figure on standby for the Democrats to use in case  Joe loses all mental acuity--the criminal, lunatic , violent Dems will vote for any lookalike-- Bernie  Sanders and other mob rule anarchist nutjobs will be in charge anyway
#WAKEUPTOBIDENUSA  OHIO PENNSYLVANIA COLORADO WICONSIN MICHIGAN BIDEN WILL ILLIMINATE FRACKING, WILL GIVE YOU HIGHER TAXES, AND LOOSE YOUR JOBS
Yep which means the MSM is doing a great job of poisoning everybody with their fake news. But there is still time left. Biden has to come out of his basement one day and speak. Then ppl will know how clueless he is.
Biden is a democratic puppet, they know he's brain dead and will do what they say .... keep America great vote TRUMP
...and this is the first time I heard of this horrific crime, if he was a Biden supporter it would be covered 24/7 by #CNNFakeNews and #MSLSD
In the West Wing, there is one phrase that stops discussion cold "The President says" Biden worked closely with her for 8 yrs, and trusts her judgment and knows if she could do it This is a "The President says" moment, and he isn't going to listen to what some hack adjunct thinks
The rioting in Portland is a myth. Bill Barr talked over the Democrats at the hearing, Biden has a record he can be proud of!
Introducing #RunningMate for #Dementia #Biden 2020........Break Up Those Damn Banks! #LMAO!
President Biden will have his hands full to rescind all your vicious treatments of poor families and minorities. We will remember what kind of POS you were.
“We choose truth over facts.”  -Joe Biden   *Crowd Cheers*
if there are 2.3 million rental evictions in August Biden loses in a landslide. his base will be displaced.   any deals for the fed to take people's rent on their balance sheets should include   1) the wall 2) remove birthright citizenship 3) bring troops home
interesting fact: if all those evictions happen Biden loses by 100+ EV  almost every Trump voter is a home owner. so...  banks cant get anyone out by nov. it takes a year or more in most states :)
Biden allies move to stop Kamala Harris from becoming vice president
I think I actually respect this viewpoint more than the typical Vote For Biden pitch I hear.
So you’re saying Biden will be his BFF?
I’d add one more thing: will the VP candidate help with particular constituencies Biden needs to secure an electoral college victory?
Looking forward to your administration bring honor, dignity, and the admiration of the other civilized countries back to the USA, Mr. Biden.
Like it or not, the USA has a binary system. A vote for anyone but Biden (or not voting and failing to do your civic duty) is a vote for Trump. It's like FDR said to Progressives when president, "Now, your job is to MAKE me have to put those policies thru. First win the office.
So you're going to put the incompetent wannabe dictator back in office? Because like it or not, the USA has a binary political system and a vote for anyone but Biden (or not voting at all and failing your civic duty) is a vote for Trump.
Biden to announce his VP candidate next week, per ABC.
Trump has $500 million dollars in loans coming due at the end of this year, who is he making a deal with to get them refinanced or paid off? China? Russia? Saudi Arabia? We don’t need to be compromised for another 4 years, we have an option and his respected name is Joe Biden.
Also, Obama (reportedly) specifically liked Biden in part because he wasn’t going to run for president afterwards.
I've become a RINO, I voted Libertarian in 2016 'cause I favor federally legal weed.  2020 I liked Bernie for that &amp; single payer healthcare.  Won't vote 3rd party this year because it's too important to stop Trump from unraveling everything good that others did. So Biden it is.
Just throwing away your vote on a fool who made a deal with Trump to get as many people to vote for Kanye so joe Biden can lose lol. A vote for Kanye is a vote for trump
Give me Biden over tRump any day of the week!
A lil late here LMFAO but yes Kanye is inadvertently trying to sway the votes to him so Biden doesn’t win. We all know Kanye was/still is associated with trump. So now we have basically 2 trumps on the stand, both of which 1/2
What else is a VP supposed to do besides break a tie in the senate? Biden is 74, this is practical
The hardest job in the world is Biden’s sign-language translator!
Really😔sad Kanye West should be working on himself&amp;his beautiful❤family.*Wouldnt put it pass Bunker Putin puppet Trump making a backroom deal with K.W.🤔K.W.probably trying 2 take votes from Joe Biden.*Hopefully Biden is way ahead of unfit in the votes.
Biden believes in SCIENCE, will be surrounded by fit, "qualified" people AND NOT friends, kin folks, cohorts he owes. Biden will NOT divide but unite AND * drumroll .. Biden's NOT CERTIFIABLE
Sir...I have just reviewed AG Barr's testimoney to  on several occasions. If you select  as your running mate and you are successful there will be no fooling around allowed with  I vote for Biden and
FACT:  Young “Republicans” have more in common with Students for Biden than they do    ALSO FACT:  on the other hand, support  and are willing to work towards major Republican victories this November.
They really think they'll be able to shame us into voting for Biden 😂  If Biden and the DNC wants me, they know where to find me. To their left.
Republicans do not support Joe Biden. You support Biden - you're not a Republican. You are a Socialist Democrat.  &amp;  are advocating to make sure the party is united against Biden, not helping him get elected.
Opinion | Biden’s election will end national nightmare 2.0
Biden's been spotting reading "White Fragility" and "How to Be an Anti-Racist"...
You tell 'em , girl!!  BIDEN FOR PRESIDENT
Particularly, the fact that  wasn’t able to give a definite yes or no answer when asked if they could promise to not favor and attempt to get joe Biden elected is incredibly concerning.
Anxiety, depression, etc are all going to skyrocket from this. And liberals like you think it would’ve been any different under Biden. The spanish fly lasted for multiple years too. More than the United States will have this issue for quite a while. Stop hating the United States
Rex if your voting Biden You are making a vote for communism. And I cannot no longer support you while you take freedom away from us and our children. ✌🏽
Hmm, just was reading a Melinda Clarke post vs Biden and poof, it's gone. Things like this only happen to me? Doubtful
What I don’t understand. Biden isn’t everything I want in a president but he is 100% closer to my views than Trump. Why risk 4 more years when Biden can get our foot in the door of the direction we want to go
As Biden vows VP choice in first week of August, here’s who he could pick - MarketWatch
Listen I could never truly understand the trials that African Americans go through in this country on a daily basis. Police brutality, force poverty, blunt racism. But not voting for Joe Biden who I'm not crazy about either will only help Trump. Who is the enemy
Biden gets dragged around by a handler like he is a blind man
Biden is on my last nerve too, welcome to the club!
I realize that Biden likely has dementia and might not recall this but he and Obama were in the White House for 8 YEARS. WHAT did they do for race relations in this country during that time? Arguably made them worse, and now HE'S the guy who's going to bring the country together?
You're a Trojan Horse for Russia  Sleepy Joe Biden is just a Trojan Horse for the Radical Left Agenda. He will do whatever they want!
The very idea that an old white man like Biden with a long history of racist remarks calls TRUMP a racist AND gets to decide who's black is almost too absurd to fathom.
Biden told people NOT to vote for him and  told people to start their own party because they were neither wanted nor needed. If you have a problem with people voting third party, take it up with them, not voters who are only doing as they asked.
The more I hear from Biden the more I like  .
He looks like the evil half of Joe Biden that escaped before the dementia kicked in
There was never gonna be a debate  Biden babbling about where he thinks he is and President Trump laughing at him along with the rest of us.
Who are all of these split ticket voters who want Biden to be president but want a GOP Senate?
Crazy that so many comments say exactly what the Democrats have been saying for years...the alternative is worse. That's not the point...when are we going to be voting FOR a candidate and not against the other one. Of course I'm voting for Biden. It still doesn't mean Iike him.
George before asking Dr. Fauci about football and basketball why didn’t you preface it by say Biden said it was obvious they can’t be playing? I am not in agreement with POTUS’ rhetoric but you asked all questions by saying, POTUS said except with the above.
As we still mourn the deaths of 4 Americans who were under attack that Obama Biden and you allowed to happen while you all went to sleep while they called all of you repeatedly for help didn't have to happen! Leadership matters November?  had 4 plus decades in DC #Failed
Long story short, Joe Biden's going to round up protesters to.
They want this guy to be President?! Yikes smh Also where’s your mask, Biden?
Jill Biden should be ashamed of herself
How are you Democrats not standing up and asking why Joe Biden is the nominee ? when you had a field of 20+ some-what decent candidates.
it’s a joke lol it’s referencing a tweet ziwe made about her voting for biden
doing my part. more people saw mob violence in the right districts in swing states this week that saw joe biden ads :)
Looks like you’ll drop your pants for Putin on any given day, so I’ll take Biden over you in a heartbeat.   #Biden2020
Biden tax plan will take cap gains to 39.6% besides increase in corporate and personal tax rate. Do we want the government to reallocate 40% of the capital?
But what’s the alternative? Also, the fight doesn’t end at the presidential ballot box. They have a lot to say about Biden but nothing about anyone at the local level because that’s what matters. That’s why Republicans winin the long run.
Then I’m happy to be a Biden supporter.
Trump could win. He might win. Here are six reasons why.  reports:  “We have to be true to ourselves and acknowledge that Biden is a mediocre, milquetoast, neoliberal centrist that we’ve been fighting against ”  Cornel West, Sanders supporter,
We can only pray that Harris is at the top of Biden's VP list. America will reject this despicable race hustling anti-American clown. Dems are so out of touch they think people will love this choice...I do!!
Sigh. I'm just so tired. I do answer every Biden and Act Blue survey with "you need to select KDH for VP"   It's just these constant, relentless waves of anti-blackness and misogynoir are wearing on me. I need a recharge.
. #NobodyLikesMe except #FakeNewsMedia with Rigged Questions Leaked by  And  😂😂
Biden praised Harvey Weinstein... Round and round we go.
if Biden wins, his left wing US Atty's will move to dismiss ALL these cases, including the 2 lawyers in NYC who burned police cars
Biden saying “crimate clisis” is as cringe pandering as when the Dem candidates spoke Spanish
the top count for throwing an improvised explosive at a federal court house should be use of a weapon of mass destruction. but no one on the left will ever face serious charges.  in fact, if biden wins ALL these cases will get dropped by leftists DA's
I had a joke about demon semen, but I keep blurting out the punchline before I finish the rest of the joke
Not for nothing, but Joe Biden wants to round up anarchists.
Joe Biden called for anarchists to be rounded up. Will you address that?
Whether or not, it'll be denied just like Biden has all his marbles.
If your a ally against anti black racism then stop reducing it to a left vs right Trump or Biden thing. Parties don’t matter, both are honestly equally as racist just the left gives itself more plausible deniability. Is that what you want to do make racism more subtle?
TRUMP 2020. U all still sound like a bunch of cry baby’s. Can’t wait for the years when he’s re-elected. U think Biden has a shot??? He doesn’t even know who he is😂😂😂
CNN telling us we can only pick Biden is pretty strange considering there were at least 3 non-pedophiles they buried in favor of him.
I CAN BEAT BIDEN OFF WRITE-INS #2020VISION
“Why should I vote for joe Biden? It’s not like he’s going to do any major changes when he’s president”   EXACTLY! the last four years have been chaotic asf! Why can’t our next just be another president who just goes to summits and give speeches 😭
Every time I watch him speak, I cant believe this is real .. you’d have to be as mentally incompetent as Joe Biden is to actually vote for Joe Biden .. you would have to want Kamala Harris to be the president to vote for Biden.. Trump will be re-elected AND win the popular vote
Yes!! You can’t ask him “why did you suggest taking disinfectants for COVID?” or “Why did you retweet a video that says masks don’t work”. You can only ask President Shit for Brains, these type of questions. It’s nice not to be stupid, that’s why Biden gets applause. He’s smart!
Message to all Republicans! Keep saying you will vote for Biden when polled! Let’s make them cry in November!
Don’t disagree but I can’t see Biden as a Savior.Scary times.
Are you referring to the Trinity tweet itself? Because yes, that is dumb to be tricked by bot accounts that Warren Dems are about to defect from Biden.
Donald Trump vs. Democracy - The Bulwark. Arizona, Florida, Michigan, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin all narrowly favored Trump in 2016; recent polls show him trailing Joe Biden in all six.
Biden literally needs notes to remind him to tell the truth and that someone is talented. How is this the Democrat candidate for President? #2020Election
During a campaign event today, Joe Biden held notes with Kamala Harris’ name scrawled across the top, followed by five talking points:  – “Do not hold grudges” – “Campaigned with me &amp; Jill” – “Talented” – “Great help to campaign” – “Great respect for her”
Imagine if Pelosi, Biden, Bernie or Schumer were leading us, the whole country would be burning to the ground just like the cities that their  puppets are leading.
Joe Biden is unfit.
Yep, from Biden too.
Everything Bad wants Biden!
Looks like we don't have long to wait before Biden's choice is known. Hoping for Rice, Duckworth would also be a good choice. I like Bottoms but she isn't clearly qualified. Meh on many of the others.
Bottom line if McConnell doesn't lose, then it doesn't matter that Joe Biden wins because he's gonna do the same shit to Biden that's he did to Obama. 8 years of NOTHING GETTING PASSED.
Multipayer with a public option is good but Biden’s canpaign said it themselves: it’s NOT UHC.

i think she blew out too early and too weak in the primaries.  in the end, i think biden will go with a white male. just my 2c
But we're not, and neither is Biden.   Anarchist is a lefty ideology? It is not. This author of the article has no clue as to what she claims to explain.
Joe Biden NEEDS to pick Val Demings for his VP. She is the only pick I am enthused about.
Former Vice President Joe Biden says he will choose his running mate in the coming days.
Just how far left is Joe Biden, really?  bhuahahaha
Joe Biden is brilliant and your next POTUS!
If anyone listened to Biden today &amp; heard trump talk afterwards about USA being independent of making products, you should know  said things so so close to what Biden stated his plan is. Now theres another trump who's plagiarizing
Joe Biden's going to round up anarchists.
My map is based on current polling - Ad Spend, Senate races - -  Ohio and GA are the most volatile - Biden will most likely not win TX /IA and I'm  close to making OH light red as well.  GA is a true toss up and FL can fall into that category
Read the responses to this Tweet Biden voters are JUST like Trump voters. Only thing that'll change is the people running down protesters will be driving Priuses.

Biden cant even explain why to vote for him 😂
looks down to answer specific questions from specific reporters. Rehearsed questions &amp; answers. Hilary admittedly was given debate questions in advance. Will Biden get the same preference?
biden didnt answer not one question, state the facts and tell the truth!

Washington Post isn't an undisclosed organization, but ok. Can't wait for November for Biden to take over and disclose EVERYTHING republicans were covering up the past 4 years
Joe Biden said you ain’t black if you don’t vote for him. And as much as I hate to say it, he’s right 😔
He bullied Bernie Sanders into quitting prematurely, effectively disenfranchising half the states that had not yet had their primaries. For that, I will never forgive him &amp; will never vote for Biden. #VoteGreen2020
Don’t be ignorant. Bernie won the first three states + the largest state in the union. His momentum was squashed by the entire DNC (save for warren) coalescing around Biden before Super Tuesday after his SC (which don’t forget was helped by Clyburn)
Most of us don't care for Biden, but still prefer him over Trump, and the polls show. Even Fox News polls show Trump getting decimated. And hmm what's worse, a couple anarchists rioting with 99% being innocent, or police actually destroying more property and beating protesters?
I support not only Biden taking the test, but also them both taking more advanced tests than just "what animal is this", along with tests to show understanding of American law, the Constitution, and history. Drug tests, physical tests, and intensive background checks too.

No collision was found.  Now, is there EVER going to be an investigation into Hunter and Joe Biden's dealings with the CCP? Or does that matter about as much as Terra Read's allegations?

I'm not going to play what aboutism with you. Between Trump and Biden, Biden is the better choice. Period.
If talking about Joe Biden’s history and begging his team to push for more progressive policies is hurting his campaign, then why bother running for president in the first place?
Hear me out: I do not believe that Biden will need 11 weeks for a transition to power. He needs to go in on Nov 4. The Jan 20 inauguration date is only tradition, best I can tell. If I'm wrong, please educate me.
Most politicians only care about votes, but at least Biden can feign empathy. Trump can't even pretend to care about people going through anything, at least not in public.
wants to raise taxes on the rich but he REFUSED to pay his fair share when he became wealthy. #Biden used a S CORP to avoid as much as 800k in taxes in 2017/18. The only reason anyone uses the S CORP loophole is to avoid a 3.8% tax.
The reality in which we exist is one in which there are way more than 2 names on the ballot for president. Biden supporters are hijacking the term "reality" to push the lie that there are only 2.

The Democrats/media are criminals. They have attempted to nullify my vote for four years. They cannot be allowed to cheat.  Going back to the criminality and disastrous foreign and domestic policies of Obama/Biden will be the end of the country.
Your fucking plan is not going to work. That public pressure is going to be like a gentle breeze in the summer to biden. It won't phase him at all. Your plan is like putting a square peg in a circle, its not going to happen.  My plan is to withhold my vote
and Biden's gonna turn over world power to China!  Well Hunter already got paid by them so he doesn't care!
Im not settling for biden because if I do, these literally no point in being on the left. Just settle for who ever runs on the democratic ticket for the rest of your life.

Yep which means the MSM is doing a great job of poisoning everybody with their fake news. But there is still time left. Biden has to come out of his basement one day and speak. Then ppl will know how clueless he is.
I’d add one more thing: will the VP candidate help with particular constituencies Biden needs to secure an electoral college victory?
Looking forward to your administration bring honor, dignity, and the admiration of the other civilized countries back to the USA, Mr. Biden.
Like it or not, the USA has a binary system. A vote for anyone but Biden (or not voting and failing to do your civic duty) is a vote for Trump. It's like FDR said to Progressives when president, "Now, your job is to MAKE me have to put those policies thru. First win the office.
So you're going to put the incompetent wannabe dictator back in office? Because like it or not, the USA has a binary political system and a vote for anyone but Biden (or not voting at all and failing your civic duty) is a vote for Trump.
Biden to announce his VP candidate next week, per ABC.
Also, Obama (reportedly) specifically liked Biden in part because he wasn’t going to run for president afterwards.
Just throwing away your vote on a fool who made a deal with Trump to get as many people to vote for Kanye so joe Biden can lose lol. A vote for Kanye is a vote for trump

Biden believes in SCIENCE, will be surrounded by fit, "qualified" people AND NOT friends, kin folks, cohorts he owes. Biden will NOT divide but unite AND * drumroll .. Biden's NOT CERTIFIABLE
Particularly, the fact that  wasn’t able to give a definite yes or no answer when asked if they could promise to not favor and attempt to get joe Biden elected is incredibly concerning.
What I don’t understand. Biden isn’t everything I want in a president but he is 100% closer to my views than Trump. Why risk 4 more years when Biden can get our foot in the door of the direction we want to go
You're a Trojan Horse for Russia  Sleepy Joe Biden is just a Trojan Horse for the Radical Left Agenda. He will do whatever they want!
As we still mourn the deaths of 4 Americans who were under attack that Obama Biden and you allowed to happen while you all went to sleep while they called all of you repeatedly for help didn't have to happen! Leadership matters November?  had 4 plus decades in DC #Failed
Biden tax plan will take cap gains to 39.6% besides increase in corporate and personal tax rate. Do we want the government to reallocate 40% of the capital?
But what’s the alternative? Also, the fight doesn’t end at the presidential ballot box. They have a lot to say about Biden but nothing about anyone at the local level because that’s what matters. That’s why Republicans winin the long run.
Then I’m happy to be a Biden supporter.
We can only pray that Harris is at the top of Biden's VP list. America will reject this despicable race hustling anti-American clown. Dems are so out of touch they think people will love this choice...I do!!

“Why should I vote for joe Biden? It’s not like he’s going to do any major changes when he’s president”   EXACTLY! the last four years have been chaotic asf! Why can’t our next just be another president who just goes to summits and give speeches 😭
Yes!! You can’t ask him “why did you suggest taking disinfectants for COVID?” or “Why did you retweet a video that says masks don’t work”. You can only ask President Shit for Brains, these type of questions. It’s nice not to be stupid, that’s why Biden gets applause. He’s smart!
Message to all Republicans! Keep saying you will vote for Biden when polled! Let’s make them cry in November!

ask Biden for advice
Ma’am these are not rumors there are countless videos of Biden sniffing and rubbing little girls. So much so their facial expressions change and they try to move away from him.
but Biden can touch little girls, a pedophiles videos remain right?
seems that they've made their vows together to the American people &amp; consolidated the Biden-Clinton Democratic Party ticket to confront the Trump-Pence administration in the 2020 elections. They might also want Pres. Carter to address the Convention.💰
Not demanding it has caused the Dems to split. The ACA was written by the hospital CEOs and insurance companies that you mention. They’re the ones funding the biden (and trump) campaigns, which is why he doesn’t support Medicare for All. The Dem *base* needs to demand now

I have to question the motives of all these people. You won't see me excited about Biden, but I'm voting for him. What's the alternative? Their words though imply to not vote for him. It's almost like they want to influence people to not vote for him, and give Trump 4 more years.
Do not let them guilt you into supporting biden
You really haven't disputed anything i have said like not one thing..... you can't see eye to eye when you have no response. Like didnt Citigroup choose each of obama's cabinet members? You think its going to be any different with biden?
I just don't understand how progressives think biden or the establishment will listen to anyone on the left. Like look at how aoc is even treated by democrats within her own party... he's not going to pass anything progressives want. It will be back to business as usual
Why in the world do you think biden is someone you think you can reason with.  He literally won with no progressive support and is literally winning right now without even trying...

At least he did the interview.Biden is a joke. Let him go on Chris Wallace an see how he does  Their afraid to put him to the test he’d be  bum ring all the way.
No you mean the Democrats created.Biden has not one idea on how to fix anything the Dems created.He’ll just have the name of President but for sure he won’t be doing a thing if he’s elected the others will be ruineing the country. Hello Venezuela. Hope you’ll like to eat garbage
Good to see Joe Biden voters having fun
I don’t know why.  Chris Wallace would ask questions like, “What’s your name?” When Biden got it wrong, there would be no follow up.
I wish all of my followers would cut and paste this and tweet it out right now:  JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
I feel like we need to just say we're voting for Biden this go round. But moving forward we should support our local leaders, that's where it starts. And is most important.
Just an awful look for Biden
nice poetry not so nice your choice of Biden ---same as Bernie Sanders
Why is it when Biden says something that seems ofd base nobody hears about it and when they do and it vomes out wrong it is a slip of the tounge but when the President says something interpreted differently he is the worst man in the world?
When is Biden supposed to formally get the nomination? The 18th? I think they are going to wait for indictments until then. Make sure the dems are represented by Biden. They’ve already shown us his “Logan Act” suggestion and unmasking. There has to be more.
Works for me All I know is the cabinet that will be part of the coming Biden administration is going to be historically amazing

I don't care if Joe Biden sleeps for four years, as long as his transition team clears the decks and puts educated, honest people back into the positions in the Executive Branch.    All of them should be confirmed, not temps.
When the DEMS start INSULTING VOTERS &amp; quoting bible verses as the election draws near, remember that they treat religious people as HATE groups. Look at the dem gov of Nevada. You can go to a casino but not go to church. LOOK AT WHAT BIDEN DID TO THE LITTLE SISTERS OF THE POOR.
Biden doesn’t support free college tuition and supports Medicaid for all who want it, not Medicaid for all. Don’t confuse Sanders with Biden. Don’t know his position on trophy hunting but I know he’s not an advocate for it as Trump is.

We disagree. As a veteran and a Roman Catholic, I understand that kneeling is a sign of respect. And Biden is a middle of the road Democrat. Trump’s rantings can’t change that.
As a United States Army veteran I respect our flag as much as anyone. I also respect our First Amendment and the Right of Free Speech. I understand athletes kneeing. It’s a sign of respect for our Constitution. And Biden’s son wasn’t a trophy hunter as are Trump’s two sons.

On second thought this could be worse than a Biden presidency. Precedents would be set in those 17 days which would do profound damage to our Republic
Any way to move up in Senate hierarchy without outright deposing Schumer?  Klobuchar is an effective legislator and would be outstanding in Senate leadership.  I agree Biden owes her big.
from the colossal galaxy brain of David Brooks, brilliant advice to Joe Biden: capitalism has failed, so embrace capitalism! make this the hill you die on, then keep dying, then everybody dies.  truly, a liberatory imagination here.
"coordinated hit job," absolutely unprecedented &amp; nothing like what you centrists spent several years doing to Bernie Sanders to ensure we'd wind up with the reactionary mediocrity of Joe Biden. nothing here is as ugly as your beloved Joy Reid's anti-Semitic body-language expert.
I think the  folks should use this song I wrote back in April as their official theme song.   It's called "I'll Fucking Joe Biden".   "This time I will vote for Joe Biden Though I am likely to gag And projectile vomit all over The American flag"
The attack on Biden was a necessary wake up call for him.  He should be thanking her, not expecting her to apologize.  Her prosecutorial record is strong.  Most people like prosecutors who helped lock up killers and rapists.
This leftward pivot is amazon, how will Biden recover
LITTLE👏PEOPLE👏DON'T👏MATTER👏  Vote for Biden.
What say you?  I don’t know who needs to hear this but 66-year-old Rep. Karen Bass as Biden’s VP will not motivate the youth vote.  Just ask them.
The only time the wealthy and powerful face consequences is when they fuck with other wealthy and powerful people. That's why Bernie Madoff and that Pharma Bro a-hole are in the clink while Mnuchin holds govt office and Jamie Dimon is an advisor to Biden.
I don’t know who needs to hear this but 66-year-old Rep. Karen Bass as Biden’s VP will not motivate the youth vote.  Just ask them.

Bernie was my 1st choice.   I agree with many of your positions.   But, How important is it that Biden beats Trump?
is the best choice for VP. She brings a vibrancy that will bring both energy and expertise to the campaign. Biden/Harris is a kick-ass team.
Good to see he's not just mailing it in now that he's a lame duck.
The alternative is Biden, he can’t even complete a coherent sentence.
Sounds exactly like potus at a presser.
When you're trying to follow a Joe Biden speech.
You like your own comments often?
Is this disturbing information accurate?
That’s you. Right? You’re explaining yourself right? Because I believe all the Clinton stuff no problem but you believe every girl except the ones against trump. Why is that?
Okayy so we’re getting somewhere... you’re delusional
Did I reply to you? No I refuse to talk to annoying adult children
And uhm sir, you’re still defending a rapist right this very minute. So let’s turn this conversation to what’s wrong with you personally to support a child rapist? Are you okayy?
Republicans project so much like how are democrats hypocrites when we HAVE BEEN CALLING TO ARREST ALL THESE PEOPLE. We all just found out &amp; we want all of them arrested. But why can’t republicans say arrest trump too when he is clearly one of the most involved?
While most would like Kamala Harris as Biden’s VP. Susan Rice is a better choice. Harris is more suited for the Supreme Court. In my opinion.
She is not far to left.  She is a neoliberal. She was against Bernie Sanders. She likes Joe Biden not left at all. Just neoliberal
Am I to assume anyone who supports Biden is a pehdofile?......
You definitely want Biden to win. In the old days you would be tarred and feathered
lol yeah, people change like how Clinton, Obama and Biden were against gay marriage &amp; illegal immigration......or they do whatever for votes
Pos never loved our country.a biden presidency is an extension of transforming America which was only to kick down the columns of law that lifted us up for 2 hundred + yrs. Designed to Ensure that americans are victims of policies they've enacted. THINK! Whose benefiting? Not us!
I am not a fan of Trump but he'll have to do until someone better comes along and Joe "im a potato, wheres my car dude, head" Biden isnt it.
I know that settle for Biden site isn't like an official site but it's still some of the most depraved shit I've ever seen
i know. but biden's selected people are war hawks and they hate russia.   china has (in my estimate) 1000+ spies in US companies. no one seems to care about that!
if Biden wins -   they plan to take back Crimea and Donbass region  need the metals to secure bolshevik influence in the area
Are we seeing “Biden would be a Nazi in Europe” takes now
Tell that to Joe Biden because he wants to arrest them.
khive is so toxic on here.  i would have probably voted for biden if it weren’t for them.   i guess i’ll just write in hillary this year.
See this is hoW we lose converts to the cause. Bottom line HE'S NOT VOTING FOR TRUMP HE'S VOTING FOR BIDEN. STOP SHAMING AND WELCOME ANYONE WHO WILL SUPPORT JOE FOR WHATEVER THERE REASON IS. Dam man what r u trying to do make sure he doesn't vote at all???? JUST STOP.
Joe Biden Disses Kanye West + Donald Trump: "You Won't Have To Worry About My Tweets When I'm President"
Most of this speculation is a nonsense. You underestimate the crowds marching in every City. And not 100% Republicans are idiots, many of them will vote. There is nothing in voting laws about minimum voters, or which result looks suspicious. Biden/Trump 82/15 it's fine with me.
fight like biden is still coherent
Nunes getting dirt on Biden from a pro-Russian Ukrainian.   Sounds extremely disturbing.   Is anyone going to investigate Trump sycophant Nunes?  Or does the creep get a free pass?
In April, Joe Biden predicted Trump would try and delay election.  You better hide in your bunker.
Love party unity! Love all the concessions team Biden is making!
I voted for him twice but now that I know how duplicitous he is I have serious doubts. MSM, FBI, etc were all in on it and I’m a disgusted Dem. I don’t like Trump but Biden is out of it. Should I just not vote?
wants to do a zoom comedy benefit for Joe Biden! Who'd go? Who'd like to perform? Feel free to share! I'd go.
Next time try not making so many things up. I hope it's a Biden/Rice or Biden/Duckworth ticket, but I never had the slightest intent to vote for Trump. He's almost uniquely bad for the nation.
#BREAKING:  Biden calls for violent and non-violent protestors to be found, arrested, and shot in the leg!
You have a very narrow notion of what these voters look like and it leads you into error. I am a technocratic socialist. I have never yet voted for a republican president, despite thinking some of their candidates were good people. It was obvious to me I'd vote for Biden long ago
I have seen this before from a lot of people who say it isn’t going to Biden and honestly when he says this they react like oh voter suppression so by this point idc haha plus every counties politics are messy
Biden can’t change his own diaper. He gets his Chinese friends to help him.
there’s no way Biden is going two terms. he should absolutely pick someone young who’s going to run for president in 2024. remember when VP’s ran for president and weren’t just... there? odd how Gore was the last one
If Biden wins there will be lines at the gyms and tanning solons. The next day. Like magic.
wants to do a zoom comedy benefit for Joe Biden? Who'd go? Who'd like to perform? Feel free to share! I'd go.
I’ll be proud to vote for or whomever Biden picks.
If Biden wins, then in four years he will run as the incumbent against whatever shitstain candidate the GOP digs out of its garbage pile. So we’ll have at least another four years to wait. 😕
They're delusional..Biden since 😏 apologized AND walk the walk AND talk..unlike some people, I don't take responsibility for Jack 🌏🇺🇸
Biden's supporters are violent misogynists.  needs to get his people under control.
Who's surprised at the "delay the election" bullshit?  He's getting desperate.  It's getting close and he knows he's failing miserably.  We should all ignore him as much as possible - he thrives on attention.  Make sure you're registered, make sure you vote Biden 11/3/20.
Isn't fair it to say that Biden is a step in the right direction?  Since option #2 is a psychotic criminal, the bar is pretty low.  I agree with all of your positions.   Are you suggesting that there is an option # 3?
No he wont, Biden cant even put together a coherent sentence let alone run a country, why didnt he fix it all 12 years ago with Obama?
“I had about 95,000 positive retweets on that” -  🙃🙃🙃
The media is so dumb they just guaranteed Biden can’t delay the election. Ha ha ha
One reason a day until election on why you should vote for Biden, a thread:  9️⃣6️⃣ day still election (reason 5): Trump offered well wishes to Ghislaine Maxwell — accused of being the center of Epstein’s international child rape ring — from the White House Briefing Room.
Now all of these same Fox ppl who said Biden was trying to scare ppl with this “insane idea” of delaying the election will be the lead supporters of this insane idea of delaying the election because their dear leader trump said so and as cultists they have no choice but to follow
Isn’t the deranged orange orangutan not taking it seriously enough for people? If Biden wins we’ll all be wearing full hazmat suits.
Why don't you highlight everything good that he has done. And everything that Biden failed to do with over 45 years working for the government which is significantly more than Trump.
You should of never backed Biden. The DNC should of realized they made a mistake
Like I don't know what more I have to say to these ppl, even hilary lost they blamed the Progressives for it.  You think if she would of won they would give us the credit.  No they wouldn't.  Same with biden, how is this hard to understand
i used to love bernie until he told me to support the warlord pedophile Joe Biden
only if biden puts a white male on the ticket   then i think we are done
Trump is a whole bowl of shit and biden is just half a bowl of shit. I refuse to eat it, and you all are saying you'll just eat the half bowl... and trying to convince me to do so..... and trying to get others to do so as well.
also, #45 is pissed  is whooping his orange butt in the polls! if the election were today, Biden would be our next President! #VoteJoeBidenToSaveAmerica
Biden's Lies for Black (and White-Privilege Guilt) Votes
Joe Biden is ass.
That would be a big ol' "HELL, YES."  And my vote is for America and decency and kindness and democracy and it is for Joe effin BIDEN.
Your fucking plan is not going to work. That public pressure is going to be like a gentle breeze in the summer to biden. It won't phase him at all. Your plan is like putting a square peg in a circle, its not going to happen.  My plan is to withhold my vote
and Biden's gonna turn over world power to China!  Well Hunter already got paid by them so he doesn't care!
Biden policies are bad for any industry. Period If you disagree live the policies. Strip your life of every offending action. Heating  coolin refrigeration travel meds. Buy yourself a horse dig a well and throw away your Iphone. Giddyup! Practice what u preach $ where mouth is
Im not settling for biden because if I do, these literally no point in being on the left. Just settle for who ever runs on the democratic ticket for the rest of your life.
Good morning mr.joe these Republicans have no commonsense of wearing a mask plus trump is sort of a terrorist he doesn't care about the 150,000 and counting people who have died from this virus he's nothing more than a sorry soul.Biden for president 🇺🇸🙏🏻👍
"Trump vs. Biden: Where They Stand on Health, Economy, More" by The Associated Press via NYT

I recomded Joe Biden as a Presidential candidate to d DNC Chair Bill Clinton bcz he expedited my green card n fixed problems at Newark INS.

In the West Wing, there is one phrase that stops discussion cold "The President says" Biden worked closely with her for 8 yrs, and trusts her judgment and knows if she could do it This is a "The President says" moment, and he isn't going to listen to what some hack adjunct thinks
Introducing #RunningMate for #Dementia #Biden 2020........Break Up Those Damn Banks! #LMAO!
President Biden will have his hands full to rescind all your vicious treatments of poor families and minorities. We will remember what kind of POS you were.
if there are 2.3 million rental evictions in August Biden loses in a landslide. his base will be displaced.   any deals for the fed to take people's rent on their balance sheets should include   1) the wall 2) remove birthright citizenship 3) bring troops home
interesting fact: if all those evictions happen Biden loses by 100+ EV  almost every Trump voter is a home owner. so...  banks cant get anyone out by nov. it takes a year or more in most states :)
Biden allies move to stop Kamala Harris from becoming vice president
I think I actually respect this viewpoint more than the typical Vote For Biden pitch I hear.
So you’re saying Biden will be his BFF?
Biden to announce his VP candidate next week, per ABC.
Also, Obama (reportedly) specifically liked Biden in part because he wasn’t going to run for president afterwards.
Just throwing away your vote on a fool who made a deal with Trump to get as many people to vote for Kanye so joe Biden can lose lol. A vote for Kanye is a vote for trump
Give me Biden over tRump any day of the week!
A lil late here LMFAO but yes Kanye is inadvertently trying to sway the votes to him so Biden doesn’t win. We all know Kanye was/still is associated with trump. So now we have basically 2 trumps on the stand, both of which 1/2
What else is a VP supposed to do besides break a tie in the senate? Biden is 74, this is practical
They hide their kids when he's around. He has no campaign.  Joe Biden - Oooh I love those kids rubbing my hairy legs in the pool.   - Pedophile  Voting in Person 100% Trump 2020
Biden believes in SCIENCE, will be surrounded by fit, "qualified" people AND NOT friends, kin folks, cohorts he owes. Biden will NOT divide but unite AND * drumroll .. Biden's NOT CERTIFIABLE
Sir...I have just reviewed AG Barr's testimoney to  on several occasions. If you select  as your running mate and you are successful there will be no fooling around allowed with  I vote for Biden and
They really think they'll be able to shame us into voting for Biden 😂  If Biden and the DNC wants me, they know where to find me. To their left.

Joe Biden - Oooh I love those kids rubbing my hairy legs in the pool.   - Pedophile  Voting in Person 100% Trump 2020
Biden's been spotting reading "White Fragility" and "How to Be an Anti-Racist"...
You tell 'em , girl!!  BIDEN FOR PRESIDENT
Listen I could never truly understand the trials that African Americans go through in this country on a daily basis. Police brutality, force poverty, blunt racism. But not voting for Joe Biden who I'm not crazy about either will only help Trump. Who is the enemy
You're a Trojan Horse for Russia  Sleepy Joe Biden is just a Trojan Horse for the Radical Left Agenda. He will do whatever they want!
Biden told people NOT to vote for him and  told people to start their own party because they were neither wanted nor needed. If you have a problem with people voting third party, take it up with them, not voters who are only doing as they asked.
The more I hear from Biden the more I like  .
He looks like the evil half of Joe Biden that escaped before the dementia kicked in
Who are all of these split ticket voters who want Biden to be president but want a GOP Senate?
As we still mourn the deaths of 4 Americans who were under attack that Obama Biden and you allowed to happen while you all went to sleep while they called all of you repeatedly for help didn't have to happen! Leadership matters November?  had 4 plus decades in DC #Failed
Long story short, Joe Biden's going to round up protesters to.
One reason a day until election on why you should vote for Biden, a thread:   9️⃣7️⃣ days till election (reason 4): Trump described a basic cognitive test as “very difficult.” Some birds couldve passed the test. Trump is bragging about having the cognitive capability of a Parrot.
doing my part. more people saw mob violence in the right districts in swing states this week that saw joe biden ads :)
Looks like you’ll drop your pants for Putin on any given day, so I’ll take Biden over you in a heartbeat.   #Biden2020
But what’s the alternative? Also, the fight doesn’t end at the presidential ballot box. They have a lot to say about Biden but nothing about anyone at the local level because that’s what matters. That’s why Republicans winin the long run.
Then I’m happy to be a Biden supporter.
They're going to want to pick a cabinet post. I've been saying it since ad number one.  "The success of the Lincoln Project in securing X% of the Republican vote for Joe Biden demonstrates that there is a place in his administration for a reasonable conservative viewpoint." etc.
We can only pray that Harris is at the top of Biden's VP list. America will reject this despicable race hustling anti-American clown. Dems are so out of touch they think people will love this choice...I do!!
Biden praised Harvey Weinstein... Round and round we go.
if Biden wins, his left wing US Atty's will move to dismiss ALL these cases, including the 2 lawyers in NYC who burned police cars
Biden saying “crimate clisis” is as cringe pandering as when the Dem candidates spoke Spanish
the top count for throwing an improvised explosive at a federal court house should be use of a weapon of mass destruction. but no one on the left will ever face serious charges.  in fact, if biden wins ALL these cases will get dropped by leftists DA's
Not for nothing, but Joe Biden wants to round up anarchists.
Joe Biden called for anarchists to be rounded up. Will you address that?
If your a ally against anti black racism then stop reducing it to a left vs right Trump or Biden thing. Parties don’t matter, both are honestly equally as racist just the left gives itself more plausible deniability. Is that what you want to do make racism more subtle?
“Why should I vote for joe Biden? It’s not like he’s going to do any major changes when he’s president”   EXACTLY! the last four years have been chaotic asf! Why can’t our next just be another president who just goes to summits and give speeches 😭
Yes!! You can’t ask him “why did you suggest taking disinfectants for COVID?” or “Why did you retweet a video that says masks don’t work”. You can only ask President Shit for Brains, these type of questions. It’s nice not to be stupid, that’s why Biden gets applause. He’s smart!
Donald Trump vs. Democracy - The Bulwark. Arizona, Florida, Michigan, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin all narrowly favored Trump in 2016; recent polls show him trailing Joe Biden in all six.
During a campaign event today, Joe Biden held notes with Kamala Harris’ name scrawled across the top, followed by five talking points:  – “Do not hold grudges” – “Campaigned with me &amp; Jill” – “Talented” – “Great help to campaign” – “Great respect for her”
Joe Biden is unfit.
Looks like we don't have long to wait before Biden's choice is known. Hoping for Rice, Duckworth would also be a good choice. I like Bottoms but she isn't clearly qualified. Meh on many of the others.
Bottom line if McConnell doesn't lose, then it doesn't matter that Joe Biden wins because he's gonna do the same shit to Biden that's he did to Obama. 8 years of NOTHING GETTING PASSED.
Multipayer with a public option is good but Biden’s canpaign said it themselves: it’s NOT UHC.
Racial wage gap in the United States
Children must suffer so Biden can win - Tucker
i think she blew out too early and too weak in the primaries.  in the end, i think biden will go with a white male. just my 2c
But we're not, and neither is Biden.   Anarchist is a lefty ideology? It is not. This author of the article has no clue as to what she claims to explain.
blah blah blah.  biden said to listen to the scientist but neglected to say which scientist and what exactly they say that we are. it doing.   Bo k
Joe Biden's going to round up anarchists.
Read the responses to this Tweet Biden voters are JUST like Trump voters. Only thing that'll change is the people running down protesters will be driving Priuses.
Nothing will fundamentally change. Joe Biden is also a fascist.

One reason a day until election on why you should vote for Biden, a thread:   9️⃣8️⃣ days till election (reason 3): 20+ women have accused Trump of sexual misconduct including rape, sexual assault, sexual harassment, and non-consensual kissing or groping.
Why would he pick someone who has never been elected? Why would he pick someone, who as as AllisonW pointed out, would drag controversy when it's been well established Biden and the DNC don't want that type of selection.
Can’t wait until Biden wins and we reclaim DOJ and the rule of law. Best be looking for a new job now.  #TrumpIsLosing
Biden was the one who said "if you don't vote for me you ain't black", "I don't want my kids to live in a jungle" and other crap
I've been pondering what it could be - surprise vaccine, Biden love child, dirt on the VP candidate, etc.
White liberals can’t wait for Joe Biden to be president so they can go back to ignoring institutional racism
biden didnt answer not one question, state the facts and tell the truth!
Rich a-holes told Biden to follow Bernie's lead, they wouldn't be in this situation.
Biden was still working for the government during 1990. Nice try
You should be asking Biden to follow Bernie's lead, guess you don't give a shit about the people who are going to die from a lack of health care.
Bernie can afford to back Biden, he and his family are guaranteed health care.
Bernie can afford to settle for Biden, he's guaranteed health care.
The silence feels pretty weird. I don't think there's even a lot of pressure on Biden to pick a veep, and there's this feeling of inevitability about the whole thing.
Trump has nothing to do with the protests. Also, Biden was in office during the 1990 L.A riot and he didn't do anything
I'm going to lose loved ones because they can't get health care. Joe Biden is literally going to kill my family. Just sayin'.
Ma’am these are not rumors there are countless videos of Biden sniffing and rubbing little girls. So much so their facial expressions change and they try to move away from him.
How Biden plans to destroy the suburbs
but Biden can touch little girls, a pedophiles videos remain right?
Not demanding it has caused the Dems to split. The ACA was written by the hospital CEOs and insurance companies that you mention. They’re the ones funding the biden (and trump) campaigns, which is why he doesn’t support Medicare for All. The Dem *base* needs to demand now
Another poll has Biden ahead in Texas. Morning Consult is usually one of Trump's better polls too.
That's a hoot. Your dad has no idea what's going on. And I'm Mr. Biden doesn't want to read your self-published book.
I don’t care about Biden’s past with criminal justice reform, I don’t care whether he was wrong about trump being the first racist president. I care about getting rid of Trump. Any criticism some dems have with Biden, Trump is worse.
Did sexism elect Trump?
‘President Trump is lost’: Former Navy SEAL in new Lincoln Project ad makes the conservative case for Biden
I have to question the motives of all these people. You won't see me excited about Biden, but I'm voting for him. What's the alternative? Their words though imply to not vote for him. It's almost like they want to influence people to not vote for him, and give Trump 4 more years.
we cant have our shows back until Joe Biden is propertly defeated in Nov
three quick theories  the feds:  1) feel biden win is inevitable, don't want to go to prison 2) agree with the left and want to id as many right wingers as possible coming out to confront the left 3) are embedded in the left themselves and looking to identify more violent left
WTAF did I just see? Joe Biden should run this as an ad. #Sad
Sort of a tacit acknowledgement that Biden does best when neither seen nor heard, and that there's a real possibility that the addle-brained Trump could crush the swiss cheese brained Biden in a televised debate.  Turn that weakness into a strength! It's actually not a bad idea.
Which means not Biden since he has been Vice president for 8 years, hasn't done anything significant. And an additional 40 years for all the work he has done in the government
I agree. I would vote Biden regardless of what woman he picks.... with 2 exceptions Jeanine Pirro 💩  Laura Ingraham 💩  I have it from a credible source that they are not mammals, they lay eggs.  The source said to me “Sir, you know they lay eggs, right?” I was like “Wow”
True. I'm no Biden apologist, BUT he supports a public option, which is a step in the right direction.
All of us who watched the Anita Hill/Clarence Thomas hearings knew that Biden was the chair of the judiciary committee.
You really haven't disputed anything i have said like not one thing..... you can't see eye to eye when you have no response. Like didnt Citigroup choose each of obama's cabinet members? You think its going to be any different with biden?
I just don't understand how progressives think biden or the establishment will listen to anyone on the left. Like look at how aoc is even treated by democrats within her own party... he's not going to pass anything progressives want. It will be back to business as usual
Why in the world do you think biden is someone you think you can reason with.  He literally won with no progressive support and is literally winning right now without even trying...

nice job everybody who joined up with Biden and said we gotta push the dems left. aced it
Her credentials and foreign policy experience make her a very compelling candidate for Biden’s #VicePresident. She had one glaring bad mistake in her years with President Obama but honestly that’s it as far as I know.
Hold your horses! We can't swear-in Biden until January. So stop nagging!
Biden would pick somebody named KarenBack when i did Indian American advocacy work, i had an hr long breakfast w Biden discussing Jammu Kashmir. He is no Islamist. India needs a strong America, so even if he's not in line w Modi, he's infinitely bttr than Trump who is weakening us globally. (Also Saudis fund Trump)
Yo, look at Biden’s background and milquetoast environmental policy. Point being that we don’t have time for his ineffectual dismissive attitude over such a pressing catastrophe. Read my original comment, register that the Lincoln project backers gave us Trump. Dems need to act
I hope Klob decides she wants to be VP again and Biden picks her.
Chip in to elect Joe Biden
Good rub, Biden/Harris 2020!
Our Country is set to fall if Biden is elected. With little to no Police and handicapping their Authority, Officers will quit and who will replace them. Patriots will band together and that will be the start of the end. Civil War will destroy us, while Foreign enemies wait.
Tulsi is by far the best. The brightest blacked out star of the Democrat Party🧐 of course, her FP would be exactly opposite from Biden’s as she is against the neocon war mongering filth which dominate our militaristic American Supremacy based FP

Watch Biden's remarks on how he's mobilizing a 21st century care and early childhood education workforce to deal with the caregiving crisis in our nation.
Watch Ron Klain, former White House Ebola Response Coordinator, break down what a Biden administration would have done differently and what we would do now to get this virus under control
It would.  But someone seems determined to screw this all up.  And it’s gonna cost Biden your state.
He's Putin's little B*tch. It's over him+jared will get prison hopefully general population, The WH now belongs to President Biden.🎉🎉🎉🎉

Karen Bass, A Potential Biden VP Pick, Praised Scientology At Church Opening In 2010
This is when we Democrats start criticizing our own and start screwing up the election. We do it every time. 🤦🏼‍♀️ I keep saying we need to FOCUS and see no negatives at all about Biden or his VP. We need to be like the MAGATS and worship blindly. Just until Nov 3.
“The president has to be part of the solution, not the problem,” Biden added.
Can I ask you why you’re voting for Biden then? Can you give me some policies you stand for
Biden on Trump floating delaying the election: “this president went so far to say what I warned he would say four months ago. He thinks maybe we should delay the election. Be prepared. Be prepared.”  Via pooler
I will actually vote for Biden if he picks Clyburn as VP out of respect for owning K-hive, warren losers, and all women in one swift blow
Help me understand this. Biden wrote the racistass Crime Bill so he could tie in his “baby VAWA” into it instead of just pushing VAWA?!?!??
I agree. Most of the people I know don't follow Twitter and when I tell them about the drama that's being generated here over Biden's selection of VP, they think it's crazy. However once they're aware of what's going on, they too have a strong opinion about the prospects.
Hey Mike.  I've dropped some bucks on ByeDon2020 merch and like it.  But does any of the money go to the Biden campaign? I like the stuff, but need Biden to win.
Imagine saying, "I'd vote for Biden over Trump, but Kamala Harris as VP is my deal-breaker!" 🤣🤣🤣 Idiot Berners. 🤣🤣🤣
“We have to tell them the truth. And some of the truth is going to be hard, because science – masks do matter," Biden said at a fundraiser this evening, via pooler    "Social distancing does matter. You've got to get the curve down and keep it going down."
Not exaggerated.  The stories are not gossip, but factual. I am stunned to have just learn about Bass only a few minutes ago.  Would not want anyone one from that group near Biden.
Biden HAS foreign policy
By the way, *this* is why Biden mirroring Trump’s use of “anarchists” to mean criminals was so bad. I’m the context of Portland protests the word very much refers to ideology as much as behavior.
I'll vote for Biden even if he chooses a goat as VP.   Having said that, I don't see as an advantage to have a scientology fan in that position. That's one of the creepiest cults in this crazy country of ours.
"This will take more than just holding our noses at the ballot box and voting for Biden," writes Zoe Fenson. "We need to make sure he wins by as close to a landslide as possible."
That's Biden's hometown.
Joe Biden is your last hope and that's not saying much. All those candidates you had to run for president and that was the best you guys could do.I can't wait for four more years so you guys could go nuts.
New Polls:  60% disapproval of racist, pathological liar, corrupt criminal #donaldtrump. Only 36% approval. #JoeBiden up by 15 in one poll &amp; 11 points in another poll.  No doubt, #TrumpIsANationalDisgrace #TransitionToBiden
I would be like "kicking him out is gonna be simple" but I just saw some shit on the person that Biden MIGHT pick for vice president and dammit he gotta make things more difficult.

100%.   An "Avengers Assemble!" strategy against Trump is the way to go.   It'll give Biden a team of strong surrogates during the campaign. It'll also calm the fears of some people who worry about Biden's age by letting them know there is a strong team that comes with him.
Joe Biden's search for a running mate enters final stretch | 1010 WINS
I know what he’s capable of. Biden is literally the devil
Faux centrist Biden thinks he can be God’s gift to all people. Minorities, moms, the rust belt, disaffected Rs—bubble states. Just hobble out of the basement and climb astride a blue donkey, carry green branches and wave them at anti orange passerby’s who drop to their knees.
I don't think she's a leading contender but that was 10 years ago and people evolve. Still, in my opinion, Biden has better choices.
These are the people who think Biden is a socialist
My list of Trump-Biden voters on The Office: Jim, Oscar, Andy, Meredith, Kevin, Phyllis, Kelly. (Remember, it’s Scranton!)
You do realize your beating yourself ! Biden is sheltering in place as you do all the heavy lifting for him!
Kamila Harris Jailed black ppl  Tammy Duckworth thinks that progressives wont win swing districts  Susan rice is a shitlib   Warren killed bernies campaign   And now Karen Bass is a fucking Scientologist!  Biden is fucking irredeemable. He’s never going to cater to the left.

This entire process has been frustrating. Frankly I’m blaming Biden. He shouldn’t have said from months ago VP was going to be a woman. These misogynistic attacks and mud throwing for months has been horrible. Enough!
You're right. Biden can keep quiet and let Trump endorse pizza places in the middle of a global pandemic.
NBA does couldn’t care less about Americans.They support China &amp; want to affect the election to Biden.They are despicable. Couldn’t care less about black lives or the lives of those in China being oppressed.The corporate cowards that hide behind the misery of others for profit
Which characters on The Office are Trump-Biden voters?
Same way Biden is leading in the poles
&gt;this is how you "love" the military. President  or any other president NEVER did, nor will do. America voting for decent honorable humane Joe Biden  You're not nor ever will be in the league of Joe Biden and President Barack Hussein Obama!
I SO agree. For Americans to know in advance who BIden will have around him to work with him to right the economy , repair international relationships, put Americans to work with federal projects, calm the distemper. -  all to look forward to.
I hope Joe Biden has everything to go on day 1 as well as Pelosi’s House committees &amp; Schumer’s Senate ones. I have a feeling a whole lot of people are going to called to testify at hearings &amp; Trump won’t be able to direct them to refuse to show up or answer questions!!
A senile Joe Biden will be good for the United States. If we engage of wars of aggression, forced democracy, bully tactics, bombings of children, pedophilia of elites, and massive racism we can just say that we don't remember that stuff. 😃
you can't blame biden for anything. he's not home
Pretty conveniently placed given Biden is supposed to reveal someone by next week. Wow.
Just saw a guy in a Biden mask
I am gonna block all of the K-Hive if or when Joe Biden announces Kamala Harris will be his vice president because  they have to be on the top of the list of the most obnoxious supporters of all time on social media.
You beat Hillary 4 years ago. Probably the most unlike able candidate to run for President except for you. She still got 3 million more votes and you needed Russia’s help to win. You would get crushed by Obama just like you will by Biden. #NobodyLikesTrump
And they were trying to talk about Hunter Biden and nepotism??
Joe Biden should say something but he has strong black men &amp; women working in high level positions. Someone need to say, now, what is being said about Kamala Harris is not a reflection of the campaign and is unacceptable overall. Kamala Harris standing alone like Hillary Clinton.
Am I a bad Democrat?  I don’t care if Karen Bass went to a Scientology event in her district and said what politicians say? 🤷‍♂️ Trump said there are “fine people” who are white nationalists and locked kidnapped kids in cages. I’ll vote Biden no matter who is picked. 🤷‍♂️
A real 2020 turn would be a Karen becoming Vice President of the United States

biden told ingraham that he met with drs. 3 -or- 4 times a week...for an hr and 15 mins...wha?
I have a lot of feelings about the Biden/Warren fundraiser tonight.  Mostly it boils down to: 1. I still think Elizabeth Warren should be President. 2. Being a woman is exhausting AF.
Biden could pick my cat as VP and then shoot it on 5th Ave and I still vote for him. Still, he should choose a woman of color who is not tied to Scientology.

I don’t believe so.  Not yet, at least.  She’s being pushed hard to be Biden’s VP by various Foreign Policy elite in DC.  A number of senior figures in the Biden campaign don’t like her.

I know. I hate Scientology.  But I only care if it hurts Biden. And anyway he hasn’t chosen her.
Let  President if you fk wth elections or  President Biden have a say, since you won't be there.
Odds are low. But if Biden just happens to drop that info,  you need to break the news in this thread.   Accomplished actress / political reporter.
Neither did Hillary. Warren has basically been erased from the media. Talk about misogyny. The thing is that Biden can't really do much except make a decision so it all stops and explain it so all the women understand his reasoning.  But after that its the general which is worse.
Joe Biden casually throwing out Kierkegaard
True but also let's not forget about Pedo Biden

If Biden does not pick one of the following three women of excellence, I will be very disappointed: Kamala Harris Elizabeth Warren Susan Rice
Running scared by Biden and his socialist friends, BE AFRAID,
Twitter is manipulating all traffic. We all know this. Media will hide this information like they are hiding Biden and all crimes of obamagate.
These right wing news media are trying to discredit every black woman running to be Biden's VP. They are digging up everything they can about their past even tho all of them have been a public official for years. Imagine if we actually get a black woman on the Supreme Court
They do not all donate to him where do you get your information from? You honestly think the elites would back Trump over Biden? You honestly think a career politician like Biden is on the up-and-up?

I love no malarkey Joe Biden... He won’t take no jive neither... And in November, he’s gonna tell Trump to put an egg in his shoe and beat it...
America is with Joe Biden all the way!
I like her.  There is really no one on the list that I could not get behind. I think Harris would be a great VP and personally I can see her as a competent and good Pres too. But I am good with whoever truthfully  I feel good about Biden and I just want the Trump nightmare to end
I grew up a Reagan Republican. We supported and protected our troops, and were loyal to our allies. That party is gone. Biden 2020.
What about Biden’s son? Making millions in Ukraine...
Someone literally tweeted last week that biden isnt doing anything and hes been largely out of the public eye and then someone else responded and was like nah hes been doing a lot and the person came back with “oh actually I see hes had one event a week.Its just not covered much”
What’s the huge fear?  SCOTUS is solidly right and a Senate majority of any would be slight.    Biden isn’t AOC, and I’ll gladly endure four years of policy I disagree with (and fight) to save the party.   Nothing else will send the message required to shock the conscience.
The supporters of the blacks should stop pressuring Biden to pick up a black VP. That will hurt Biden, and it's sure he will be defeated. Biden should pick up either the Michigan's Gov Gretchen Whitmer,  or New Mexico's Gov Michelle Grisham.
Under President Biden and a Dem Senate, add two justices to correct for McConnell’s dereliction of duty in 2016, which led to the appontment of Justice Gorsuch. Bring the total number of justices to eleven
I’m sure Biden will do just fine, the left don’t need to support Democrats who’ve shown their complete comtempt for us. There are enough brainwashed conservatives to help carry Blue Trump over the finish line.
Your so close   You now have even more confusion condition. Cause That's joe biden state   You Dementia Freak
Did anyone say that Biden was "too ambitious" when he was being vetted?  Seems women are always being held to a different standard.
I'm sure they'll give him a mail-in ballot, too. Ya know, so he can vote for Biden. 🙄
For everyone concerned about Jor Biden feelings, I don't give 0 fucks. Biden will be the leader of the Democratic party, a sitting congressional senator is being targeted in the most racist &amp; sexist manner. He can't remain silent especially when the Black woman is defending him.
Disqualifying. Biden has an embarrassment of riches with the other women on the short list.
Biden's pathetic attempt at pandering to Black voters.
It is mystifying why  Biden’s campaign staff does not understand that fact. You are completely right
Biden is never going to announce a VP 🤣

Yea I disagreed with them. Even though it was obvious Biden was going to win after Super Tuesday, I still think primary voters should have voted for whoever their preferred candidate was. Of course the pandemic through a monkey wrench into everything.
Vote for biden and you get this all over.
I was responding to her getting attacked by Biden supporters. Don’t know why you would think otherwise. Oh wait yes I do. You’re just looking to yell at anyone you disagree with. Have fun with that.
Well said Bill.  In reality, the only candidate running for pres. is Trump - people will either vote for him or against him.  Biden essentially is a non-entity.  Nobody decides that they're voting for Biden because they like what he brings to the table
I’m voting Biden regardless,  but with a lot less enthusiasm if he picks “praising crazy religions” person as  VP.    That’s a deal breaker right there.

Do you think the ACA didn't expand access to healthcare? Or do you think Joe Biden had nothing to do with that? Or do you think Joe Biden has no other ambitions on healthcare?  Is someone lying to you and are you believing their lies? Where do you get these ideas?
Biden got 1% in Iowa in 2008, dropped out and was perfect Veep candidate for Obama.
You're missing one obvious point ... Maybe Biden wants to focus on the domestic dumpster that's going on so having a globetrotting VP/State team is what's needed to rebuild ties with allies.  He's certainly not going to be flying the 1M miles that Hillary did.
Except that half of Florida has  #TrumpVirus and Biden is leading by several points. You are the Minority. Please be the of the Silent ones. 🙄
I guess I'll never get to find out what a defined Biden candidacy looks like
"Joe Biden lies about wanting to increase the minimum wage" "Joe Biden wants to limit access to healthcare"  How did you come to believe these sort of assertions that are so verifiably false?
She is carrying Biden. We NEED Warren. #VPWarren
Biden announced his VP. It's official, and just who we hoped for: the girl reading this.
I get that you're using the "settle for Biden" argument against Bass. But the analogy breaks down because we are essentially in the "primary" phase of the VP selection process, not the general election.
With respect, I think a Hawkins/Walker administration would be in many regards better for me and my students than a Biden/Harris administration.
Biden doesn’t. Trump is the most incompetent, narcissistic, childish imbecile this country has ever elected. My only question is why it took so long for so many to see that?
A Florida teen was arrested in connection with a hack of 130 Twitter accounts, including celebrities like Elon Musk,  Bill Gates and Joseph R. Biden Jr.
Is this tweet sponsored by Biden's campaign?  Keep ignoring the woman running.  Sexist much?
“Biden is shit because he won’t do X and Y.”  “Well actually he will kind of do X and will definitely do Y.”  “Hah, you believe him??”  “Yes and here is evidence.”  “...” “Biden is *actually* shit because he won’t do Z and so on and so forth.”
I love  but I can't believe that any interview with Dr. Jill Biden could ever be a "great" interview.   One thing is for sure... her appearance on Fox News Tuesday... means that  won't be announcing his VP pick on Tuesday.
If the Biden campaign picks anyone besides Kamala at this point, white supremacy wins.
This whisper campaign against  has to end. I want an ambitious person to be VP.   How many times did  run for Prez — isn’t  he ambitious? And we need someone who CAN and WANTS to run for Prez in 2024 if Biden doesn’t at 82 yrs old! #KamalaHarris #VPHarris
Americans know and trust Joe Biden. Joe’s also always been liked, admired and respected by his Republican colleagues across the aisle. We do want Joe Biden for President, he’ll restore honor, dignity and order to the U.S.A..
Gordon Hayward is worse than Trump and Biden put together
This is all so nutty. We are rarely happy with VP choice. Never universally. It’s just something to yammer about pre convention. I am horrible at reading tea leaves. I’ll be hyped if it’s Kamala and I’ll buy more merch and stuff, but Biden 2020

The details in the story are not pretty.   Demings spent her police career protecting and serving the Orlando PD as much as the people of Orlando.  The fact that it's a conflict of interest inherent to policing does not make it any less reprehensible.

Chip in to elect Joe Biden and other Democrats on the ballot
FFS Twitter. Joe Biden is not picking crazy Scientology lady, nor is he going to pick crazy demon semen dr.  This is not Trump naming ‘acting’ cabinet positions. Joe will pick somebody trusted, experienced, smart, principled.   He’s picking Kamala Harris, mark my words
Maybe they know instead that if Biden picks a Black woman as VP, all the press will talk about from here on in is busing and "reparations."   It's inevitable, and there will be a number of "gotcha" issues designed to put Biden on the spot.
I'd love it if you could point out where any of us have said that Joe Biden is affirmatively good. I think I've been very clear that he's not. We're acting like a person who wants to expand access to healthcare is better than someone who wants to limit access to healthcare.
Not one mention of Biden in the entire article but like a lemming you just throw out the new catchphrases your masters spoon feed you.  But continue on.
By jumping on this and making it trend without yet knowing all the facts, we are playing right into the hands of the Republicans.  They are just beginning their dirty oppo-research against Biden.

&gt;one of biden's VP wannabes is a scientology supporter me: honestly. nothing surprises me anymore.
Actually on paper Biden has done more damage to 100s millions of Americans' lives than Trump, Then there's his poor judgement with Foreign policy.   Trump is an idiot, Biden is a good salesman, Equally as dangerous. His record proves my point.

How could Biden not want Warren's energy and expertise on the ticket? She's the best choice.
Before Kamala Harris dropped out of the 2020 election, she held the 2nd most Black support based on statistical data, and had the most congressional Black caucus endorsements. This target on her potential nomination by Biden old white dogs is problematic just like Biden silence.
Harris took a cheap and dishonest shot at Biden about busing. It was dumb to bring the topic up as well.  You guys really want busing back for Dems to have to defend?
Both DJT and Biden are racists and fascists. Follow that syllogism when it comes to supporters.
Really? Stop trying to tell us what life in the suburbs is going to be like under Biden, when it couldn’t be worse than what it is under YOUR failed attempts at being president.  What are you doing other than spending your days tweeting and watching tv????

Biden winning is the sequel to The Irishman. Press conference on this matter to come.
Oh. Now, with a potential Biden victory, you start caring about the debt again. Great.
Interesting how the press is all but ignoring Warren-- the best and most popular choice by far, nationally -- and forcing Biden to pick a Black woman.  You trust this MSM to help Dems? After 2016?
Donald Trump has set the stage for a civil war
I'm staying home, Biden and Democrats need to get their sht together, Enough of this false illusion. Biden is going to be a disaster. Which is already proven from the platform negotiations early this week, Trading out Trump for Democrats polite version isn't changed.
Elizabeth Warren says 40,000 people are attending the grassroots fundraiser with Joe Biden.  It comes on the end-of-month fundraising deadline.
I've already told you I'm not a Biden voter so I'm not sure what the relevance is of that last sentence. But it's definitely not a "privilege" to expect different things from one party or the other when the parties have different platforms and do different things.
Biden will have a tough time understanding this. Its Good!
Can you read more than one headline? That same poll stated that  "Biden has lengthened his lead over President Trump in the latest Rasmussen Report. The new national survey finds Biden with 48% support among Likely U.S. Voters to Trump’s 42%."
Pole shows three million Americans think Joe Biden is slipping.  Merriam and Webster defines slipping as senile.
Biden needs Harris. She’s tough as nails and no BS.
I think the Secret Service is already working with Jill Biden to select new linen and drapery material.
12) They VOLUNTEER the most. They get others to the polls the most. They talk to their friends about the importance of voting the most. What those conversations look like from ALL women will be determined by how this situation is handled. Will it be "Joe Biden has our back!"?
the idea of picking anyone who is not a national household name seems nuts.  Biden is old.  The reaction to the pick needs to be "well that sounds like someone who could step into the job" and not "who?"
We’re not super far in to be fair but Biden seems perfectly healthy and sound, very far from the senile fading man that the GOP keeps trying to paint him as
My favorite is people who look at biden vs trump and go “ugh, these options suck.”  Like I wish I could live life just making choices between something I like and something I don’t. But alas, here we are, living and shit.
He's endorsing Biden?
Never said perfect. Just better. Biden is a joke 😂
You should tell Biden to control who old white dogs, not me.
11) Plz help Joe Biden grasp the potential consequences of this course not being corrected. KHive/women will still support him, but it will be less a vote for him than a vote against DT. This matters in the quality of that support. Black woman don't just VOTE Democratic the most
Oy, no, I’m down here now! I need to move and fast. Though I think Florida is gonna go for Biden.
Can we acknowledge that even though neither will bring our country in the right direction, they will not both bring our country in the *same* direction, and Joe Biden's direction is clearly less awful than Donald Trump's direction? Is that not obvious for some reason?
The Biden campaign better hope these smears were some 3D chess level strategy because this shit looks really bad if they do not pick Kamala.  CC:
Their attacks are more motivated by “twitter” supporters of other candidates. The attacks on Kamala’s “ambition” reported in Politico was by “Chris Dodd” (former US Senator) and today’s attack of Biden choosing a “safer” Black woman ... was from “Ed Rendell” (former PA Gov) 🤬😡
Ok this is a bit to much for me. I would like Kamala, I will deal with anyone Biden wants. Now Ms.Bass and scientology No way!! They don't believe in medicine.

One consolation...they will have to use a chunk to rebuild the part that‘s already fallen down. Biden will be in office  before they get to use the rest.
Biden is already an accomplished politician, Good actor, undesirable legislative &amp; voting record. Anyone thinking Biden will make positive transformative changes is either naive or willfully ignorant, Then there are his obvious mental health issues.
I’ve made no public statements about Biden’s VP, this is disqualifing.
Sick and tired of the tropes bandied about by white men labeling women, especially black women, as too ambitious, disloyal and rubbing people the wrong way (code for aggressive). Democrats need to remember that Black Women are the backbone of the party
What about the part where Harris sucks the way Biden sucked in 2008?
Forget about what transpired between Biden &amp; Kamala. Why would u not have issue with a man or men telling a female shes too ambitious? That's a disgrace for a woman to see no harm in that. Tell u something else...WE NEED MORE FEMALE LEADERS. WE WOULDNT BE IN THIS MESS
Not Biden’s choice. It’s Perez.
Biden cannot choose the underhanded Harris, he needs to restore integrity of the VP role, she can’t do that. Rice, Demings, Warren work. I would love Maxine Waters, but Biden gains zero from a CA running mate.
Ultimately, whatever’s in Joe Biden’s heart when it comes to his Catholic faith is between him and the Lord and it’s not my business, but my goodness I cannot stomach this pabulum about how his politics are guided by his deep lifelong grasp of Catholic social teaching
I'm over white men deciding the fate of Black women in America. But I am happy to live during a time to see my momma  speak truth to power. Dodd, get it together and think before you publish.
I don’t think the showdown is going to be Biden vs Trump. It’s gonna be trump/Barr/pompeo &amp; the federalist society/McConnell/Republicans.
If Biden runs with Kamala stfu, stop knit picking, and cast that fucking vote for them.  This is the best we're gonna get. Y'all  have chosen trash significant others over &amp; over again &amp; hit us with "no one is perfect". I don't wanna hear the bullshit from y'all anymore.
Have fun defending this and Bass' comments on Castro. Biden can kiss Florida goodbye if he were to pick Bass.  And not like she brings nationwide name recognition to the ticket either. Little upside. Rice, Lance-Bottoms, Harris, Duckworth, Warren &amp; Demings are all better choices.
That would be a certainty if Biden gets in.  Trump has done great things.
Earlier I mentioned #Bass; she was in Students for a Democratic Society in Cuba multiple times &amp; tried to "bring back the revolution" to the US. Apparently, not a disqualifier for Veep. But #Scientology (rightfully) is! Hey, whatever gets the job done.

9) Women/KHive feel Biden doesn't have an accurate sense of how BAD this is for energizing the base. Biden must apologize to all women &amp; vow to do better. Esp if she's not VP, he must publicly apologize to Sen. Harris for his "allies'" part in the breathtaking sexism towards her
What will it take to end this fiction that Biden is the consummate Catholic politician? His umpteenth statement in defense of the right to abortion? Another declaration that he’ll force nuns and other religious believers to fund abortifacients?
Yeah. And if some reporter found out who the pick was like three days before Biden announced, it would be treated like a huge scoop. But who cares? We were going find out anyway.

Voting for Biden is like buying a Subaru: A flight to safety that’s well vetted. Bass is an unknown on the national scene except to insiders and undercuts that message bc now you have to learn something new and decide if she’s what you want from a president.

James &amp; his wife just gave over a million to Biden &amp; I think it was the Dem Party . About a week ago.

What if the post man is for Biden and sees the ballot go to a trump house. There’s a lot of variables. And not just against trump. What if someone wants trump and really hates Biden how is that fair to him either?
Hey everyone, when Biden announces his pick and it's not the person you preferred 1) remember that you probably didn't prefer Biden as nominee either, and 2) chill out and keep your eye on the ball.
If Biden wants to go with someone other than Harris this whole horrible mess of the past two weeks have made it likely that if he now picks someone else it will cause a backlash.  I will have a very hard time with another choice because of the treatment of KDH.
8) Joe Biden needs to get a handle on this QUICKLY. He cannot wait two more weeks to deal w/it directly if he holds the VP the announcement that long. He needs to specifically denounce the misogynoir happening &amp; apologize for the fact ANY of it came from within his own circle

Steve, I don’t follow who is left or right. I’m neither as both suck. The narrative I hear most is that Biden is leading Trump.

Trump isn’t perfect, but he’s 1000000x better than HRC or Biden when it comes to human rights. This was one of his first acts as president.
I didn't vote for a Democrat or Republican in the 2016 presidential election and I won't vote for a Democrat or Republican this time around either. I also live in a state where my vote doesn't matter. That doesn't mean I can't look at Trump and Biden and figure out who is worse.
Remember that time when  predicted  would try to delay the election, and Trump tried to say Biden was acting paranoid, but then Trump said he wanted to move the election? #BidenWasRight

Yep, compared to Biden obviously because he's the worst candidate I've ever seen. I'm also not serious with my original tweet but it's funny seeing everyone get mad over the logic they've been touting.

Yeah, i think its Kamala, my friend. Look, no one is perfect. But we need someone who is tough, modern, young, and a contrast to the boot-licking dunce, Mike Pence. A lot of suburbans are worried Biden is past it and a placeholder for the next POTUS. They wont risk far left
The depth of talent in the Dem Party is formidable. So many great women to choose from. Whomever Biden chooses as his VP will have my complete support!!   And FWIW, I’m ok with anyone in the VP spot rubbing others the “wrong way”.  Trump is a lapdog to every despot out there!

Biden is in on it. He should leave her alone if he doesn’t there to be his VP.
Guys can we nicely try to convince this guy to vote for Biden? 😀
If Biden wins he will be a historic President before even doing anything. VP to the first Black president. President with the first Black VP. Oldest President. And the first person to become President 32 years after first running for the office.
4 more years. #Trump2020Landslide #Trump2020LandslideVictory  #Trump2020 Trump2020 Or it's going to get really ugly.  You think this is bad?  haha...if Biden gets elected, you will learn what "bad" ir "ugly" is.
i hope karen bass becomes biden's vp so the 2020 election will have scientology angle and we get project chanology 2.0.
I agree. But I’m also thinking these people you site, and many I know too, aren’t going to make this election. It’s the independents and Hillary haters from last time that tipped the scale to Trump. Biden is not as hated, especially against Trump.
Did it worked painting Obama as a socialist 2 times? What did worked is America first vs globalists. Independents don’t buy that Biden is a socialist if they do they don’t view it as the extreme version of socialism more like the European version.
"Coalesced" implies coordination.   Clyburn didn't need to coordinate with anyone or get anyone's permission. He simply supported Biden, and Biden won easily.  In this context, the usage of "destroy" is virtually hysterical, implying that something nefarious happened.

4) We knew pundits would play the "not this black woman, that black woman" game to protect white male supremacy. What we did not foresee is Joe Biden quietly allowing Kamala Harris to be denigrated by any of his advisors, and that this would incur no consequences to them

Sick &amp; tired of white men pitting women against each other &amp; using old sexist, racist &amp; destructive tropes of Black women! They are not doing Joe Biden any favors! Stop now before Black women stay home! ⁦ should quickly pick his VP!
I care about the communities that Biden and Trump will harm, which is why I put in the modicum of effort needed to determine which of those two ghouls would be more harmful. You do know that just because two things are both bad, they are not necessarily equally bad, right?
Isn't that the phase  is also in?  I mean, Bill is probably just nervous from all the news that just came out.  Biden just doesn't know where he is or what he's doing.
White people think they going to lecture me on Biden, you must not know but Biden is only getting my vote because Trump gotta get the fuck out but don't misconstrue that for my support of Biden. I never liked him and never will. Biden was spoon feed this, he didn't earn shit.

Nice editing on Biden. Beto did go there (I don't know how much), but he's not the candidate. Biden specifically said otherwise, so, while the editor is brilliant, the ad is just propaganda.
But...you do realize Biden has to declare a running mate *before* the election, right? So we can’t actually vote Trump out before there’s a VP selection; that’s not how this works.
This person need psychiatric help ASAP. Biden will  choose a woman and President Obama will help him pick  that VP. STOP THE BS
Yeah Biden not willing to kill his supporters what a snowflake #TrumpkilledCain #TrumpLiesAmericansDie #snowflaketrunp
It would make sense if trump and Biden WERE the same but they aren’t and you know it and are responding accordingly so thanks for validating exactly what I said, I wish they had this much passion to actually go out and vote
Repubs for Biden are just closet democrats, just too afraid to admit it.
3) The campaign needs to understand if it condones racist patriarchal behavior, it will lose. KHive was riding for Biden before most, tho we understood Kamala may not be picked for the ticket. Our support wasn't contingent on that, though for some the passion of that support was.
This is not the time to start tweeting bs about Biden. VILE trump and his supporters will  pick it up and run. Stop the nonsense about who, what or it. WHY?? Do you want another 4 years of this thing?? I don't think so.

Either Donald Trump or Joe Biden will be the President on January 20, 2021. Which one do you prefer?
With each passing day this continues I become more convinced that Biden is behind it. Only one candida is being att led like this. Biden could have stopped it weeks ago. That it has not stopped means he approves of it.
Or even *want* to do that. Joe Biden is a NeoConservative; he’d be appalled at the idea.
Harris is a conversationalist. After Biden is placed in the home she will as president engage us all in conversations. We should think about this and have a conversation about it. This may be better than her implementing crackpot Dem policies🤔
Someone should tell  and Joe Biden. They intentionally divide the moderates and the progressives to keep their donors lining their own purses.
He turned a religious service into a democratic stump speech for Biden. He has no shame. That was a vicious administration for 8 years which ended with a failed coup d etat that he allowed.
I didn’t. I did not support him at all. My pick was Kamala Harris. Actually, Biden’s polling numbers with African Americans is lower than Hillary Clinton’s back in 2016. His numbers will go up by choosing a Black woman. Not a Tammy Duckworth. She’s not about diversity.
Don’t people understand that mail in voting cannot work or be accurate. What if people really want to vote for Biden but their parents put trump down instead. And he wins. It’s not fair on either end. What’s stopping me from taking my neighbors ballots and filling them out.
2) These sexist attacks continue to be put forth by old white men around Joe Biden, and their old white men news buddies happily offer multiple media outlets on which to denigrate Sen. Harris. All in the service of making sure the black woman who's *too* accomplished isn't chosen
As I said, she’s a career diplomat. She only has foreign policy experience. Yes Trump as no experience. That’s why the country is a mess. Because of Trump, he branded Susan Rice. In addition, her son is a Trump supporter. That would be bad for the Biden ticket.
How is it not true? Have you not seen Biden’s mental decay in real time?.. Better do your homework!
Rich investors will be fine if Biden hikes taxes, UBS says #CrainsNY
The fact no one in the Biden campaign is saying anything about Kamala Harris being disrespected in this manner is revealing. Even if she's not his nominee, she's a formidable Democrat who's a qualified &amp; experienced Black woman. You can't be this silent, Black women are watching.
Please consider voting for Biden. It’s not about voting for him. It’s about getting trump out. If trump wins, the Supreme Court could overturn so much stuff that’s really basic rights to cater to the far right.
Bernie supporter always and voted for Trump in 2016.  Won’t make the same mistake this year. Out of question to vote for Biden, I am deeply digusted by what he represents. So abstention thanks for asking
Biden winning lol
I like Karen Bass fine but Biden picking her would be like Hillary picking Tim Kaine all over again.  No thanks. It's Kamala Harris for VP. It better be Kamala Harris
I think your leader, Joe Biden, told you it’s “time to get real.” We’re all hostages to the 1%  in this BS 2Party system.  Time for Progressives to grow a pair &amp; break away!
No. It should be an African American female who represents the demographic that walks the walk for the Democrats, when it comes to voting consistency and voter turn-out. Biden won the Democratic primary due to Clyborn and the Black vote. Trump won because of BernieBros in 2016.
tbh i think it'd mean she'd be president in a few years, i'm like 90% whoever biden's VP is will be, because i feel he's not going to do four years
ironic that once he’s finally elected, President Biden probably won’t remember any of it
So considering that I just linked you to 8 examples of times when Joe Biden voted to increase the minimum wage, do you want to admit that you might have been wrong here?
Signed up for Biden's emails, which I'm already kinda regretting.  One interesting thing: I've got fundraising emails "from" most of the big name VP contenders.  IDK but I have a hunch they'll use that data in in the selection process as a proxy for base trust/ enthusiasm.
She was sh*tting on Biden during the entire campaign trail and his team didn’t forget
You got to the heart of it, Cindy! Biden needs to get us excited to do more than just vote with volunteering and donations- but we’re being turned off by petty attacks on a very worthy female VP pick and we have had enough of women politicians being attacked. 🇺🇸 #KHive

Hmmm, All these Biden VP leaks that victimizes Harris. Tell me, are they singing all praises and no criticism for any other on the list?
Why is the media worried about Biden when Trump won't able to answer tough questions?  Or easy ones?  Or string two words together to form a coherent sentence?  #butheremails
And there it is!!!Why he sent stormtroopers Into Portland. So he can hold show fear in US. Ironically it is on Trump’s watch, this abhorrent situation happened &amp; he forced it to happen.This won’t happen under Biden. It happened under trump! Biden will absolutely handle it better.

Biden has to do X at Y time, Biden did C wrong, so he should chose Candidate B, and so on and so on. I’ve been seeing that since March lol, I would bet that Harris is going to be the VP. Btw, I’m not trying to be mean, I get why ppl r impatient.
is a liar
Wrong-o.  Several other polls echoing the same sentiment - Warren nets the most new support overall, in every demo, and in swings with undecideds. The numbers don’t lie, GOP is terrified of her and playing down her chances...
These American voters are not "intimidated" by   Joe Biden’s 'you ain't black' comment is voter intimidation

Yeah, I understand that. Hillary would of been President right now if it wasn’t. But what does criticizing Biden have to do with gossip politico articles when all the serious people in the process signed NDA’s? Remember, most people don’t care about VP, so whatever Biden has...
- There will be no change until after the election. At that point, either Biden will be president or Trump will be free to admit that he made a mistake and correct course. Even though Trump is psychologically incapable of admitting that he made a mistake, he may find a scapegoat.

Can’t understand why he would let her hang out that there like that. She’s wonderfully talented,a joyful warrior. The attacks are painting her as something else. Biden shouldn’t let that happen to anyone on his short list. Certainly not someone working as hard for him as she has.

I saw someone today wearing a Biden t shirt and why would anyone even by one of these t shirts?
I imagine the Biden folks have seen this
This is exactly what they are trying to do cause discension and drama so they can separate. Don't feed into it. It doesn't matter who he picks because if you don't vote for Biden you are voting for trump. PERIOD. He can pick a carrot as his running mate and I'm TEAM BIDEN 100%
If Biden can do worse than where we are right now.. That would be some accomplishment!  Google is liberal Should be a t-shirt
Hey guys, I’m very excited to be speaking on the Activism in Fashion panel with  (an Obama-Biden initiative) sign up if you want to attend next week!
Bass does check off a number of boxes as a good fit for Biden's VP, however.

Exactly. Everyone has a bias in politics, so I understand why Khive is getting impatient. But, as a OG Biden supporter, its funny to see ppl criticize him and his campaign when he won, significantly. I want Harris as VP, but Biden is the nominee, and twitter still isn’t important
Who cares? Biden could should Donald Trump on 5th Avenue and he’d still get enough votes to win.  Your orange fuck buddy is toast. 😂
Biden said on Tuesday that he’s going to make his choice for his running mate in the first week of August
not sure if i'm allowed to announce yet but joe biden picked me to be his vp
“Progressives saw his campaign’s willingness to accept the platform plank as a sign that Mr. Biden and his team were increasingly open to ... term limits for justices and judges or adding federal judgeships at the lower levels.”
You said, “You mock but it’s true.” Only someone who believes that would vote for someone who is mentally failing like Joe Biden. Now what does not seeing race or gender have to do with Apple’s cash?
I think the collapsed economy is Warren's calling. Biden is already strong on Foreign Policy so Rice is not necessary. She could rebuild the State Department though. That's needed.  Harris has an opportunity to rebuild the AG with actual uncorrupted justice in mind. If she wants.
dead in the water Joe. Snap the fuck out of it BIDEN. RIGHT NOW. OR YOUVE LOST THE ELECTION.
Ah well, its interesting to watch the #MeToo movement sink and turn into a #YouToo movement. Hey, the Dems support abortion, so its Ok. Whatever happened to that lady that laid the goods on Creepy Joe Biden??
House hearing finds US no closer to plan as coronavirus is 'raging out of control' – live | US news | The Guardian   YIKES THE TRUMP VIRUS IS KILLING AMERICANS AT AN ALARMING RATE HE ONLY CARES ABOUT HIMSELF AND HIS FAILING RE-ELECTION
I’m not gonna put to much of my thoughts into this but, a lot of people who started supporting Biden and supported Biden originally have said about progressives candidates “Twitter isn’t real life”, and “Joe won because he doesn’t listen to twitter”. What’s changed?
Smart woman.    You and  and others saw this long ago.  My happy ass wanted to be enthusiastic for Biden.  At this point the ONLY way that happens is if Kamala Harris is on the ticket.
Racist old Biden &amp; a cop, Going to save the privileged white liberal from understanding the USA has been a racist mess for 400 years 😂😂 Not one person is able to tell me how Trump damaged their lives.
ugh on #KarenBass  had to look her up, too Progressive, too pro-Castro crap. 2018 Midterms elected 39 new moderate D's to 2 new Progressives. Giving in to those yelling the loudest isn't the right thing to do. I'll still vote for Biden, but would be hugely disappointed.
Shit, is this the part where I tweet a bunch of old links about Joe Biden advocating for increased minimum wage? I think it is....
Yeah in 2008, Hillary Clinton and Obama went to June.  Yeah in 2016, Hillary Clinton and Sanders went to June.   So I find it stupid for Biden who had this wrapped up in March, waited all these months to announce..  I fucking know Twitter is not real world,  ugh..smhBack when i did Indian American advocacy work, i had an hr long breakfast w Biden discussing Jammu Kashmir. He is no Islamist. India needs a strong America, so even if he's not in line w Modi, he's infinitely bttr than Trump who is weakening us globally. (Also Saudis fund Trump)
Yo, look at Biden’s background and milquetoast environmental policy. Point being that we don’t have time for his ineffectual dismissive attitude over such a pressing catastrophe. Read my original comment, register that the Lincoln project backers gave us Trump. Dems need to act
I hope Klob decides she wants to be VP again and Biden picks her.
Chip in to elect Joe Biden
Good rub, Biden/Harris 2020!
Our Country is set to fall if Biden is elected. With little to no Police and handicapping their Authority, Officers will quit and who will replace them. Patriots will band together and that will be the start of the end. Civil War will destroy us, while Foreign enemies wait.
Tulsi is by far the best. The brightest blacked out star of the Democrat Party🧐 of course, her FP would be exactly opposite from Biden’s as she is against the neocon war mongering filth which dominate our militaristic American Supremacy based FP
Watch Biden's remarks on how he's mobilizing a 21st century care and early childhood education workforce to deal with the caregiving crisis in our nation.
Watch Ron Klain, former White House Ebola Response Coordinator, break down what a Biden administration would have done differently and what we would do now to get this virus under control
It would.  But someone seems determined to screw this all up.  And it’s gonna cost Biden your state.
He's Putin's little B*tch. It's over him+jared will get prison hopefully general population, The WH now belongs to President Biden.🎉🎉🎉🎉

Karen Bass, A Potential Biden VP Pick, Praised Scientology At Church Opening In 2010
This is when we Democrats start criticizing our own and start screwing up the election. We do it every time. 🤦🏼‍♀️ I keep saying we need to FOCUS and see no negatives at all about Biden or his VP. We need to be like the MAGATS and worship blindly. Just until Nov 3.
“The president has to be part of the solution, not the problem,” Biden added.
Can I ask you why you’re voting for Biden then? Can you give me some policies you stand for
Biden on Trump floating delaying the election: “this president went so far to say what I warned he would say four months ago. He thinks maybe we should delay the election. Be prepared. Be prepared.”  Via pooler
I will actually vote for Biden if he picks Clyburn as VP out of respect for owning K-hive, warren losers, and all women in one swift blow
I agree. Most of the people I know don't follow Twitter and when I tell them about the drama that's being generated here over Biden's selection of VP, they think it's crazy. However once they're aware of what's going on, they too have a strong opinion about the prospects.
“We have to tell them the truth. And some of the truth is going to be hard, because science – masks do matter," Biden said at a fundraiser this evening, via pooler    "Social distancing does matter. You've got to get the curve down and keep it going down."
Not exaggerated.  The stories are not gossip, but factual. I am stunned to have just learn about Bass only a few minutes ago.  Would not want anyone one from that group near Biden.
Biden HAS foreign policy
I'll vote for Biden even if he chooses a goat as VP.   Having said that, I don't see as an advantage to have a scientology fan in that position. That's one of the creepiest cults in this crazy country of ours.
"This will take more than just holding our noses at the ballot box and voting for Biden," writes Zoe Fenson. "We need to make sure he wins by as close to a landslide as possible."
That's Biden's hometown.

Florida teen charged as “mastermind” in Twitter hack hitting Biden, Bezos, and others
100%.   An "Avengers Assemble!" strategy against Trump is the way to go.   It'll give Biden a team of strong surrogates during the campaign. It'll also calm the fears of some people who worry about Biden's age by letting them know there is a strong team that comes with him.
Joe Biden's search for a running mate enters final stretch | 1010 WINS
I know what he’s capable of. Biden is literally the devil
Faux centrist Biden thinks he can be God’s gift to all people. Minorities, moms, the rust belt, disaffected Rs—bubble states. Just hobble out of the basement and climb astride a blue donkey, carry green branches and wave them at anti orange passerby’s who drop to their knees.
I don't think she's a leading contender but that was 10 years ago and people evolve. Still, in my opinion, Biden has better choices.
My list of Trump-Biden voters on The Office: Jim, Oscar, Andy, Meredith, Kevin, Phyllis, Kelly. (Remember, it’s Scranton!)
Kamila Harris Jailed black ppl  Tammy Duckworth thinks that progressives wont win swing districts  Susan rice is a shitlib   Warren killed bernies campaign   And now Karen Bass is a fucking Scientologist!  Biden is fucking irredeemable. He’s never going to cater to the left.

This entire process has been frustrating. Frankly I’m blaming Biden. He shouldn’t have said from months ago VP was going to be a woman. These misogynistic attacks and mud throwing for months has been horrible. Enough!
You're right. Biden can keep quiet and let Trump endorse pizza places in the middle of a global pandemic.
NBA does couldn’t care less about Americans.They support China &amp; want to affect the election to Biden.They are despicable. Couldn’t care less about black lives or the lives of those in China being oppressed.The corporate cowards that hide behind the misery of others for profit
Which characters on The Office are Trump-Biden voters?
Same way Biden is leading in the poles
&gt;this is how you "love" the military. President  or any other president NEVER did, nor will do. America voting for decent honorable humane Joe Biden  You're not nor ever will be in the league of Joe Biden and President Barack Hussein Obama!
I SO agree. For Americans to know in advance who BIden will have around him to work with him to right the economy , repair international relationships, put Americans to work with federal projects, calm the distemper. -  all to look forward to.
A senile Joe Biden will be good for the United States. If we engage of wars of aggression, forced democracy, bully tactics, bombings of children, pedophilia of elites, and massive racism we can just say that we don't remember that stuff. 😃
you can't blame biden for anything. he's not home
Pretty conveniently placed given Biden is supposed to reveal someone by next week. Wow.
Just saw a guy in a Biden mask
You beat Hillary 4 years ago. Probably the most unlike able candidate to run for President except for you. She still got 3 million more votes and you needed Russia’s help to win. You would get crushed by Obama just like you will by Biden. #NobodyLikesTrump
And they were trying to talk about Hunter Biden and nepotism??
Joe Biden should say something but he has strong black men &amp; women working in high level positions. Someone need to say, now, what is being said about Kamala Harris is not a reflection of the campaign and is unacceptable overall. Kamala Harris standing alone like Hillary Clinton.
Am I a bad Democrat?  I don’t care if Karen Bass went to a Scientology event in her district and said what politicians say? 🤷‍♂️ Trump said there are “fine people” who are white nationalists and locked kidnapped kids in cages. I’ll vote Biden no matter who is picked. 🤷‍♂️
A real 2020 turn would be a Karen becoming Vice President of the United States

I didn't see that post but its common sense to know the mental state of biden
Oh, this is a normal process. Do send me the notes where Tim Kaine was called “called over ambitious” and had “no remorse” or even when those articles came out re: joe Biden?
biden told ingraham that he met with drs. 3 -or- 4 times a week...for an hr and 15 mins...wha?
Biden could pick my cat as VP and then shoot it on 5th Ave and I still vote for him. Still, he should choose a woman of color who is not tied to Scientology.

I don’t believe so.  Not yet, at least.  She’s being pushed hard to be Biden’s VP by various Foreign Policy elite in DC.  A number of senior figures in the Biden campaign don’t like her.

Buckle up, everyone! We are about to see a smear campaign like we have never seen on whomever the VP choice is. GOP knows we have the better options with ANYONE BUT TRUMP/PENCE. Be vigilant! Look up for facts! We need to be as nuts about Biden &amp; VP as the Magats are for Trump!
#ChristopherDodd was right to tell #JoeBiden that #KamalaHarris would stab him in the back at the earliest opportunity; but #rapist #RacistJoeBiden is a #rightwing #Republican like #KamalaChameleon, so he deserves to be betrayed by his running mate...
Is trump gonna debate Biden? If he does debate, will it be easily apparent that he is medically impaired?
Media really honing in on any and every VP candidate not named Eizabeth Warren and I’m just curious when people decided collectively that she was no longer in the running. Biden himself is hosting a fundraiser with her today.
I was on 538 this evening and Biden's lead in some of the swing states has shrunk. In NC and OH where he had a slight lead he is now trailing slightly.
Joe Biden allies are willing to consider a Church of Scientology ally before Kamala Harris for VP because she dared challenge him in a debate.  That’s the headline of why Karen Bass is getting op-eds supporting her VP consideration.
It’s not Hunter anymore . Went to Brazil to become Heidi Biden
I know. I hate Scientology.  But I only care if it hurts Biden. And anyway he hasn’t chosen her.
Let  President if you fk wth elections or  President Biden have a say, since you won't be there.
Odds are low. But if Biden just happens to drop that info,  you need to break the news in this thread.   Accomplished actress / political reporter.
Neither did Hillary. Warren has basically been erased from the media. Talk about misogyny. The thing is that Biden can't really do much except make a decision so it all stops and explain it so all the women understand his reasoning.  But after that its the general which is worse.
True but also let's not forget about Pedo Biden
I like the idea, though I don’t see Biden going that far.
I mean, if anyone watched that and *doesn’t* think Biden/Warren has to be the ticket.. we just have nothing else to discuss. 🤷🏻‍♂️  #WarrenForVP

If Biden knew how to fix America, why didn't he tell Obama?
Interesting how misogynists like  keep claiming people in California don’t like  and yet all the folks who actually know her are saying the opposite. 🤔
Yes to the levels of the Obama/Biden years. Remember the days of 1 pct growth? #Trump2020LandslideVictory
Do you know how a public option works? Do you know the differences between Trump's and Biden's plans for healthcare? MOTHERFUCKER DO YOU KNOW WHAT THE WORD MITIGATE MEANS???
Running scared by Biden and his socialist friends, BE AFRAID,
Twitter is manipulating all traffic. We all know this. Media will hide this information like they are hiding Biden and all crimes of obamagate.
These right wing news media are trying to discredit every black woman running to be Biden's VP. They are digging up everything they can about their past even tho all of them have been a public official for years. Imagine if we actually get a black woman on the Supreme Court
They do not all donate to him where do you get your information from? You honestly think the elites would back Trump over Biden? You honestly think a career politician like Biden is on the up-and-up?
still not as bad as literally travelling to an island to fuck children.
Biden is literally the left's nomination for president lol "most on the left"

I like her.  There is really no one on the list that I could not get behind. I think Harris would be a great VP and personally I can see her as a competent and good Pres too. But I am good with whoever truthfully  I feel good about Biden and I just want the Trump nightmare to end
I grew up a Reagan Republican. We supported and protected our troops, and were loyal to our allies. That party is gone. Biden 2020.
What about Biden’s son? Making millions in Ukraine...
Someone literally tweeted last week that biden isnt doing anything and hes been largely out of the public eye and then someone else responded and was like nah hes been doing a lot and the person came back with “oh actually I see hes had one event a week.Its just not covered much”
What’s the huge fear?  SCOTUS is solidly right and a Senate majority of any would be slight.    Biden isn’t AOC, and I’ll gladly endure four years of policy I disagree with (and fight) to save the party.   Nothing else will send the message required to shock the conscience.
The supporters of the blacks should stop pressuring Biden to pick up a black VP. That will hurt Biden, and it's sure he will be defeated. Biden should pick up either the Michigan's Gov Gretchen Whitmer,  or New Mexico's Gov Michelle Grisham.
Your so close   You now have even more confusion condition. Cause That's joe biden state   You Dementia Freak
Did anyone say that Biden was "too ambitious" when he was being vetted?  Seems women are always being held to a different standard.
I'm sure they'll give him a mail-in ballot, too. Ya know, so he can vote for Biden. 🙄
For everyone concerned about Jor Biden feelings, I don't give 0 fucks. Biden will be the leader of the Democratic party, a sitting congressional senator is being targeted in the most racist &amp; sexist manner. He can't remain silent especially when the Black woman is defending him.
Disqualifying. Biden has an embarrassment of riches with the other women on the short list.
It is mystifying why  Biden’s campaign staff does not understand that fact. You are completely right
Biden is never going to announce a VP 🤣

Yea I disagreed with them. Even though it was obvious Biden was going to win after Super Tuesday, I still think primary voters should have voted for whoever their preferred candidate was. Of course the pandemic through a monkey wrench into everything.
Vote for biden and you get this all over.
I was responding to her getting attacked by Biden supporters. Don’t know why you would think otherwise. Oh wait yes I do. You’re just looking to yell at anyone you disagree with. Have fun with that.
Well said Bill.  In reality, the only candidate running for pres. is Trump - people will either vote for him or against him.  Biden essentially is a non-entity.  Nobody decides that they're voting for Biden because they like what he brings to the table
I’m voting Biden regardless,  but with a lot less enthusiasm if he picks “praising crazy religions” person as  VP.    That’s a deal breaker right there.

Do you think the ACA didn't expand access to healthcare? Or do you think Joe Biden had nothing to do with that? Or do you think Joe Biden has no other ambitions on healthcare?  Is someone lying to you and are you believing their lies? Where do you get these ideas?
Biden got 1% in Iowa in 2008, dropped out and was perfect Veep candidate for Obama.
You're missing one obvious point ... Maybe Biden wants to focus on the domestic dumpster that's going on so having a globetrotting VP/State team is what's needed to rebuild ties with allies.  He's certainly not going to be flying the 1M miles that Hillary did.
Except that half of Florida has  #TrumpVirus and Biden is leading by several points. You are the Minority. Please be the of the Silent ones. 🙄
I guess I'll never get to find out what a defined Biden candidacy looks like
"Joe Biden lies about wanting to increase the minimum wage" "Joe Biden wants to limit access to healthcare"  How did you come to believe these sort of assertions that are so verifiably false?
She is carrying Biden. We NEED Warren. #VPWarren
I get that you're using the "settle for Biden" argument against Bass. But the analogy breaks down because we are essentially in the "primary" phase of the VP selection process, not the general election.
Biden doesn’t. Trump is the most incompetent, narcissistic, childish imbecile this country has ever elected. My only question is why it took so long for so many to see that?
A Florida teen was arrested in connection with a hack of 130 Twitter accounts, including celebrities like Elon Musk,  Bill Gates and Joseph R. Biden Jr.

“Biden is shit because he won’t do X and Y.”  “Well actually he will kind of do X and will definitely do Y.”  “Hah, you believe him??”  “Yes and here is evidence.”  “...” “Biden is *actually* shit because he won’t do Z and so on and so forth.”
I love  but I can't believe that any interview with Dr. Jill Biden could ever be a "great" interview.   One thing is for sure... her appearance on Fox News Tuesday... means that  won't be announcing his VP pick on Tuesday.
If the Biden campaign picks anyone besides Kamala at this point, white supremacy wins.
This whisper campaign against  has to end. I want an ambitious person to be VP.   How many times did  run for Prez — isn’t  he ambitious? And we need someone who CAN and WANTS to run for Prez in 2024 if Biden doesn’t at 82 yrs old! #KamalaHarris #VPHarris
Americans know and trust Joe Biden. Joe’s also always been liked, admired and respected by his Republican colleagues across the aisle. We do want Joe Biden for President, he’ll restore honor, dignity and order to the U.S.A..

The details in the story are not pretty.   Demings spent her police career protecting and serving the Orlando PD as much as the people of Orlando.  The fact that it's a conflict of interest inherent to policing does not make it any less reprehensible.

FFS Twitter. Joe Biden is not picking crazy Scientology lady, nor is he going to pick crazy demon semen dr.  This is not Trump naming ‘acting’ cabinet positions. Joe will pick somebody trusted, experienced, smart, principled.   He’s picking Kamala Harris, mark my words
Maybe they know instead that if Biden picks a Black woman as VP, all the press will talk about from here on in is busing and "reparations."   It's inevitable, and there will be a number of "gotcha" issues designed to put Biden on the spot.
I'd love it if you could point out where any of us have said that Joe Biden is affirmatively good. I think I've been very clear that he's not. We're acting like a person who wants to expand access to healthcare is better than someone who wants to limit access to healthcare.
Not one mention of Biden in the entire article but like a lemming you just throw out the new catchphrases your masters spoon feed you.  But continue on.
By jumping on this and making it trend without yet knowing all the facts, we are playing right into the hands of the Republicans.  They are just beginning their dirty oppo-research against Biden.

How could Biden not want Warren's energy and expertise on the ticket? She's the best choice.
Before Kamala Harris dropped out of the 2020 election, she held the 2nd most Black support based on statistical data, and had the most congressional Black caucus endorsements. This target on her potential nomination by Biden old white dogs is problematic just like Biden silence.
Harris took a cheap and dishonest shot at Biden about busing. It was dumb to bring the topic up as well.  You guys really want busing back for Dems to have to defend?
Both DJT and Biden are racists and fascists. Follow that syllogism when it comes to supporters.
Really? Stop trying to tell us what life in the suburbs is going to be like under Biden, when it couldn’t be worse than what it is under YOUR failed attempts at being president.  What are you doing other than spending your days tweeting and watching tv????
OK I know that between Trump, Biden, and revolution, you would choose revolution. New question time. Between Donald Trump and Joe Biden, who do you prefer?
That's how a normal, sensible person would try for the policies they want, rather than voting for Jill Stein and saying Trump is better than Biden
Biden winning is the sequel to The Irishman. Press conference on this matter to come.
Oh. Now, with a potential Biden victory, you start caring about the debt again. Great.

For 3 days straight  &amp;  have wondered why Biden’s quote re Trump holding the Bible remains on twitter while their post about Doctors erroneously claiming they have the cure for the coronavirus was taken down. I’m beginning to think they’re slow learners.
Sanders, you may be able to pull the wool over Biden’s eyes but not the DNC. They got your number, you socialist politician.
I don't think someone who is serious about voting for Biden won't do it because of Susan Rice. She's a very accomplished lady.
Based Obama/Biden
This year has shown the two party system is a disaster and the country is broken and if you think Biden and the Dems will fix it you are kidding yourselves. Dems don't want to fix anything because they need to run on fixing things every four years.
Sanders, the DNC took out all of your progressive ideology from the democrat platform. They put Biden right in the middle of the road. That’s what the DNC thinks of your platform, a total sham.

so the question is would Biden be a chinese puppet???
Amazing how the Trump cult believes in the invincibility of Trump when his 2016 win was the fluke of the century and he’s the most consistently reviled president in the history of modern polling.
. says  wouldn’t reduce rioting and crime because he’s controlled by left-wing puppet masters. Unlike    understands that police officers play a vital role in keeping the peace and fighting crime.
Since it’s the Electoral College who decides...There are solidly Biden States and solidly Trump States at this point, right? Perhaps we should have extra, extra diligent oversight to ensure no fraud, suppression or meddling in the 10-12 or so swing states?
Suck?  What is this? Fifth grade? Biden isn’t perfect by a long shot, but Trump has turned our country into a shit show and he’s got to go.
Can’t wait for Biden to look at a statue funny and have trump start a civil war and nuke the northeast to own the libs then win 487-0

You must because because you will never hear anything coherent out of Biden’s mouth.  It is really very sad, obvious and embarrassing.

Why Electing Joe Biden Will Make The Culture War Even Worse
The more damage he does, the more he puts his family at risk. Once the electoral college certifies Biden as the next POTUS, Drumof will try to burn every document regarding his time in the WH but Biden will have his A-Team in place to thwart that process.
I might be wrong about this, but if and when Biden clearly has 270+ EVs after vote-counts with no valid disputes, won't Republican leaders like McConnell give public statements acknowledging that Biden is the President-Elect, and they look forward to working with him or whatnot?

Not only can liberals not imagine a much better world. They can't imagine a much worse world. Even if they succeed at electing Biden, Trump can escalate far right terrorism just by claiming the election was rigged. Libs won't prep for that bc they can't imagine it's possible.

It’s really time the government steps in and stops you posting these Chinese slogans. The Chinese want Biden to win the election because they can’t push around or buy Trump.
Sanders, your really confident of the outcome of the election. With CORRUPT Biden as your nominee, I wouldn’t start opening the champagne just yet.
I don’t think Americans want a change of leadership in the WH at this time. Too much going on. Biden doesn’t know he’s alive. So there’s a lot of value betting Trump.

Yesterday you made the unusual point of stating that altered images of a Jewish and a Black candidate were not anti Semitic and racist, respectively. Here your site colored the skin tone of Biden to look uncharacteristically orange. Is that also by design to emphasize your point?
This election seals it to me that the Dems and Republicans work together more than they let on. The BEST they have to offer against who they claim is the worst president ever is sleepy Joe? It don't add up. If they truly wanted a win, Joe Biden was their worst shot.

That's perfectly fine. But I think you're witnessing a President that has no sense of decorum and definitely doesn't abide by normal presidential standards. If Biden is indeed elected, I expect he will be faced with challenging questions like any president that preceded him.
Then you have just answered your own questions regarding any perceived difference. You yourself have said Trump is an "idiot". It's my contention (and maybe yours) that Biden is not. Do you treat an idiot the same way you treat a thoughtful, introspective person? I know I don't.
Let's try this a different way. Do you agree the method in which Trump conducts a press conference is different than Biden (or virtually any other elected official)? Do you agree that Trump has been subject to numerous misinformation claims when conducting interviews?
Biden and Warren have a virtual fundraiser Friday night. Many Warren peeps thought this was going to be a VP announcement. I wish.

My point was that the comments of the POSchiff towards b a r r we're inappropriate. Again! Do you fire current employees and hire people because of the color of their skin?  Biden has the most racist record ever. Do research on him. Black woman as VP solely for votes. 🤭
The sh!t show aka #BarrHearing is proof positive that Democrats know that it's unlikely, very unlikely that #JoeBiden2020 will win the election. If you are on the ticket the probability of a Biden win improve but not enough for a win.
please have both trump and biden address their mental health live during the debate....This is actual sociopath like behavior...trying to appear cool to the public with bartstool interview and golfing with Favre...now trying to appear “focused” on covid-19
2 Biden as VP wasn't a climber, so Obama had no worries &amp; this might be why he was chosen. eg ted cruz as VP, I'd say similar to Harris, the top of the ticket might worry about divergent agendas. so you see, the issue isn't me, its you.
Then travelled tirelessly to campaign for her. I'm sorry, was he not allowed to try and win? Stop being an idiot. Clinton wasn't a great candidate. Biden isn't either.
really fascinating that Biden leads in Michigan by more than he leads in several Clinton states
Every single individual who recognizes the destruction that Trump has done needs to get out &amp; vote this year. If that happens, Biden will win in a landslide. Trump has been the most unpopular president in history &amp; has taken so many unnecessary missteps this year. #VoteBlue2020

Don’t overthink this, Democrats. Kamala Harris has national name-recognition, proven campaigning skills and an ability to mix it up with opponents and give as good as she gets. Biden needs her on the ticket for a resounding win on Nov. 3.
Really? You know all protesters wore masks&amp; socially distanced-No screaming or sharing megaphones. If you can honestly say w a straight face Covid was not shed during 6 weeks of massive protests &amp; the spikes we are seeing has no correlation you are as demented as Biden.
Biden? I guess you haven’t seen this! He hates black people. Or as he calls black people “those” people...Just a heads up...Oh, and it’s from CNN
Why should the color of ones skin matter? Shouldn't ones qualifications matter more especially with a higher position such as Vice President.  Dimwit Biden is playing gender politics and everyone should take notice!

When did Biden prove that? Sorry missed it! Was it lying about FISA requests? Or perhaps threatening Ukraine to keep his sons cushy appt? Or maybe sniffing little children? Oh...I guess it’s reading from a teleprompter and parroting his handlers words...when he can remember them!

Why is it when Biden says something that seems ofd base nobody hears about it and when they do and it vomes out wrong it is a slip of the tounge but when the President says something interpreted differently he is the worst man in the world?
Sorry to hear-it’s a tough disease.Effects  are individual -some do act out ..do you recall Biden challenging the man inappropriately to push ups? That was an ex. End of day as Potus his buttons will be pushed (he can’t be protected in basement forever).. He is not fit to lead!

Joe Biden said you ain’t black if you don’t vote for him. And as much as I hate to say it, he’s right 😔
He bullied Bernie Sanders into quitting prematurely, effectively disenfranchising half the states that had not yet had their primaries. For that, I will never forgive him &amp; will never vote for Biden. #VoteGreen2020
Don’t be ignorant. Bernie won the first three states + the largest state in the union. His momentum was squashed by the entire DNC (save for warren) coalescing around Biden before Super Tuesday after his SC (which don’t forget was helped by Clyburn)
Most of us don't care for Biden, but still prefer him over Trump, and the polls show. Even Fox News polls show Trump getting decimated. And hmm what's worse, a couple anarchists rioting with 99% being innocent, or police actually destroying more property and beating protesters?

For 3 days straight  &amp;  have wondered why Biden’s quote re Trump holding the Bible remains on twitter while their post about Doctors erroneously claiming they have the cure for the coronavirus was taken down. I’m beginning to think they’re slow learners.
Madame Tussaud's Wax Museum has a Joe Biden wax figure on standby for the Democrats to use in case  Joe loses all mental acuity--the criminal, lunatic , lying Dems will vote for any lookalike-- Bernie  Sanders and other mob rule anarchist nutjobs will be in charge anyway
On second thought this could be worse than a Biden presidency. Precedents would be set in those 17 days which would do profound damage to our Republic
I don't think someone who is serious about voting for Biden won't do it because of Susan Rice. She's a very accomplished lady.
ANYBODY WHO BELIEVES THIS IS DULL OR UNINFORMED.  Obama/Biden was the most dangerous administration to happen to Israel.  Let’s ask Netanyahu what he thinks!!
This year has shown the two party system is a disaster and the country is broken and if you think Biden and the Dems will fix it you are kidding yourselves. Dems don't want to fix anything because they need to run on fixing things every four years.
from the colossal galaxy brain of David Brooks, brilliant advice to Joe Biden: capitalism has failed, so embrace capitalism! make this the hill you die on, then keep dying, then everybody dies.  truly, a liberatory imagination here.
"coordinated hit job," absolutely unprecedented &amp; nothing like what you centrists spent several years doing to Bernie Sanders to ensure we'd wind up with the reactionary mediocrity of Joe Biden. nothing here is as ugly as your beloved Joy Reid's anti-Semitic body-language expert.
BIDEN AT WORK
Chip in to elect Joe Biden and other Democrats on the ballot
In His Eulogy for John Lewis, Barack Obama Changed the Landscape of a Joe Biden Presidency  via
Bernie was my 1st choice.   I agree with many of your positions.   But, How important is it that Biden beats Trump?
Sounds exactly like potus at a presser.
joe biden at work
so the question is would Biden be a chinese puppet???
Yes but the facts of what HE DID &amp; how HE RAN the entire corrupt operation &amp; how HE CONNECTS to other people’s indictments NEEDS TO BE REPEATED AD NAUSEUM.  Let joe Biden claim innocence. He’s lying. We know he was in the January 5th meeting.
Amazing how the Trump cult believes in the invincibility of Trump when his 2016 win was the fluke of the century and he’s the most consistently reviled president in the history of modern polling.
Is this disturbing information accurate?
Since it’s the Electoral College who decides...There are solidly Biden States and solidly Trump States at this point, right? Perhaps we should have extra, extra diligent oversight to ensure no fraud, suppression or meddling in the 10-12 or so swing states?
Suck?  What is this? Fifth grade? Biden isn’t perfect by a long shot, but Trump has turned our country into a shit show and he’s got to go.
Can’t wait for Biden to look at a statue funny and have trump start a civil war and nuke the northeast to own the libs then win 487-0
While most would like Kamala Harris as Biden’s VP. Susan Rice is a better choice. Harris is more suited for the Supreme Court. In my opinion.
She is not far to left.  She is a neoliberal. She was against Bernie Sanders. She likes Joe Biden not left at all. Just neoliberal
Let’s resurrect Hunter Biden, lock him up, fake news and what abt Benghazi?!
Am I to assume anyone who supports Biden is a pehdofile?......
So you said that there will be voter fraud with this year’s election if Biden wins so I’m curious, would you still think it’s fraud if you win🤔🤔🤔
Biden the Manchurian candidate
You definitely want Biden to win. In the old days you would be tarred and feathered
Biden in action
I am not a fan of Trump but he'll have to do until someone better comes along and Joe "im a potato, wheres my car dude, head" Biden isnt it.
I know that settle for Biden site isn't like an official site but it's still some of the most depraved shit I've ever seen
this has to end up with obama and biden in jail
Voting for biden for the sole reason that he’s not Trump
They are delusional.  They wish their candidate was “moral” I guess they missed the 4 decades of Biden’s racist remarks. He was against desegregation.  And he is a huge pervert.  One of those touchy, feely dirty old men. Also he is pandering to terrorist organizations.
You must because because you will never hear anything coherent out of Biden’s mouth.  It is really very sad, obvious and embarrassing.
Unfortunately that ship has sailed. But Biden next best thing!!! Maybe a Supreme Court position in his future tho!
I would walk, barefoot, over glass to vote for Biden.
what did biden give china for the $1.5billion??/ just asking
Nunes getting dirt on Biden from a pro-Russian Ukrainian.   Sounds extremely disturbing.   Is anyone going to investigate Trump sycophant Nunes?  Or does the creep get a free pass?
you think Biden????
In April, Joe Biden predicted Trump would try and delay election.  You better hide in your bunker.
Do you want to save the integrity of the 2020 election?  1.  Register to vote and make sure EVERYONE you know under 18 does the same  2.  VOTE BIDEN.  Vote EARLY.  3.  MAKE SURE TO VOTE YOUR CONSCIOUS  4.  VOTE FOR RUTH BADER GINSBERG
I’m glad Obama reared his ugly racist head. Only the dull and uninformed pay attention to his drivel but it reminds people what they get with Biden.
*One week after Biden’s inauguration*
IF CHINA DECLARED WAR ON THE USA WOULD BIDEN SURRENDER????? HONEST QUESTION
IF YOUR A COMMUNIST BIDEN IS YOUR MAN
Joe Biden is going to win BIG
That's only true if you're Joe Biden and the Democrats
How Hunter Biden isn’t in federal prison yet is beyond belief.....BUT he will be one day for sure 100%
Can’t wait for Biden to choke on a grape and have trump respond by deepthroating a watermelon then watch him be crowned king of the milky way
Not only can liberals not imagine a much better world. They can't imagine a much worse world. Even if they succeed at electing Biden, Trump can escalate far right terrorism just by claiming the election was rigged. Libs won't prep for that bc they can't imagine it's possible.
He was for same sex marriage before Obama, so I'm willing to give him a chance. And Biden was VP for conservative voters. It was his experience in DC &amp; Obama's inexperience.
LMAO. Joe Biden has 247 people watching his broadcast today.   The polls are GARBAGE.
They're delusional..Biden since 😏 apologized AND walk the walk AND talk..unlike some people, I don't take responsibility for Jack 🌏🇺🇸
Joe Biden should pick whoever he feels most comfortable with. The person that feels like a trusted partner, to him &amp; American people.
Isn't fair it to say that Biden is a step in the right direction?  Since option #2 is a psychotic criminal, the bar is pretty low.  I agree with all of your positions.   Are you suggesting that there is an option # 3?
No he wont, Biden cant even put together a coherent sentence let alone run a country, why didnt he fix it all 12 years ago with Obama?
is joe biden owned by china??? a chinese asset???
Not one word about John Lewis?? Biden did just fine!! No word your boy wants to change the Election Day?? What hold does he have over you! You get lower by the hour! Pathetic!!
Shucky is a dead ducky
Lol. Good analogy. Perhaps Trump is like King Joffrey. And Biden represents the hope and promise of Rob Stark.
i used to love bernie until he told me to support the warlord pedophile Joe Biden
I want every person in Congress on record about this. Every, “don’t tread on me.” Every, “wearing a mask infringes on my rights.” Because if you say that or are an elected official and you condone delaying a presidential election, you stand for nothing.
If Biden wins it’s rigged and he will destroy the country before January or just refuse to leave office, but if he wins it was a fantastic, fair election because he stopped corruption
Lifelong Republican voting for Biden here as is everyone we know. Landslide for Biden.
I agree, but it really angers me that we have to win by a large margin.  If Joe Biden wins by 1 vote or 200 votes, it should still be a win.
The Democrats/media are criminals. They have attempted to nullify my vote for four years. They cannot be allowed to cheat.  Going back to the criminality and disastrous foreign and domestic policies of Obama/Biden will be the end of the country.
and Biden's gonna turn over world power to China!  Well Hunter already got paid by them so he doesn't care!
Texans are getting the memo on Trump’s failure. Texas is very much in play for Biden.
The reason they think you are being compensated is because in some way all the Biden pundits are being paid. Why else would any thinking human being support a man in such decline.
Good morning mr.joe these Republicans have no commonsense of wearing a mask plus trump is sort of a terrorist he doesn't care about the 150,000 and counting people who have died from this virus he's nothing more than a sorry soul.Biden for president 🇺🇸🙏🏻👍
So to be perfectly clear, Joe Biden is quoted saying the following about Trump’s despicable act of brute force against peaceful protestors and Breitbart deems it necessary to fact check only that the Bible was right side up? Got it.
To anyone who understands the threat that is Donald Trump: We have to hold it together for 97 days. Do not buy into any bs or division, stay united in this one goal. When we elect Biden we will make history for this united front; a bipartisan effort to secure the democracy.

Exactly. So when Biden announces his Veep, he could also announce his cabinet to mitigate that disappointment and remove some of the undue attention on the VP pick.
I've got mixed feelings about Harris, but Joe Biden's allies sound like racist, sexist assholes.
Madame Tussaud's Wax Museum has a Joe Biden wax figure on standby for the Democrats to use in case  Joe loses all mental acuity--the criminal, lunatic , violent Dems will vote for any lookalike-- Bernie  Sanders and other mob rule anarchist nutjobs will be in charge anyway
Settle for Biden 2020!
Yeah, but restoring the US’s credibility in the world stage is pretty much Biden’s wheelhouse, isn’t it?
Biden abused his power with his son n Obama abused his power spying on president trump
I’d add one more thing: will the VP candidate help with particular constituencies Biden needs to secure an electoral college victory?
Looking forward to your administration bring honor, dignity, and the admiration of the other civilized countries back to the USA, Mr. Biden.
Bozo the Clown lies 50 times every day and the Democrats are supposed to be worried over this? Benghazi are you kidding me? When Russia is paying bounties for killing U.S. Soldiers and no one cares?
Like it or not, the USA has a binary system. A vote for anyone but Biden (or not voting and failing to do your civic duty) is a vote for Trump. It's like FDR said to Progressives when president, "Now, your job is to MAKE me have to put those policies thru. First win the office.
So you're going to put the incompetent wannabe dictator back in office? Because like it or not, the USA has a binary political system and a vote for anyone but Biden (or not voting at all and failing your civic duty) is a vote for Trump.
With all these predictions on what Biden will do as president, it sounds kind of like you know he’s gonna win. Thank god.
Biden to announce his VP candidate next week, per ABC.
Also, Obama (reportedly) specifically liked Biden in part because he wasn’t going to run for president afterwards.
Just throwing away your vote on a fool who made a deal with Trump to get as many people to vote for Kanye so joe Biden can lose lol. A vote for Kanye is a vote for trump
Give me Biden over tRump any day of the week!
What else is a VP supposed to do besides break a tie in the senate? Biden is 74, this is practical
Most of us are appalled by this repugnant tweet, but there are plenty of suburbanites who this will resonate with, even tho they’ll never say it out loud. And that is why, no matter what, we have to vote in record numbers to save this country and vote Biden.
The hardest job in the world is Biden’s sign-language translator!
Really😔sad Kanye West should be working on himself&amp;his beautiful❤family.*Wouldnt put it pass Bunker Putin puppet Trump making a backroom deal with K.W.🤔K.W.probably trying 2 take votes from Joe Biden.*Hopefully Biden is way ahead of unfit in the votes.
Biden believes in SCIENCE, will be surrounded by fit, "qualified" people AND NOT friends, kin folks, cohorts he owes. Biden will NOT divide but unite AND * drumroll .. Biden's NOT CERTIFIABLE
Biden has never said Defend the Police. Stop lying
Particularly, the fact that  wasn’t able to give a definite yes or no answer when asked if they could promise to not favor and attempt to get joe Biden elected is incredibly concerning.
Yesterday you made the unusual point of stating that altered images of a Jewish and a Black candidate were not anti Semitic and racist, respectively. Here your site colored the skin tone of Biden to look uncharacteristically orange. Is that also by design to emphasize your point?
This election seals it to me that the Dems and Republicans work together more than they let on. The BEST they have to offer against who they claim is the worst president ever is sleepy Joe? It don't add up. If they truly wanted a win, Joe Biden was their worst shot.
I honestly don’t think Biden could do it and after he failed he would still get 90% of the black vote
Crazy that so many comments say exactly what the Democrats have been saying for years...the alternative is worse. That's not the point...when are we going to be voting FOR a candidate and not against the other one. Of course I'm voting for Biden. It still doesn't mean Iike him.
As we still mourn the deaths of 4 Americans who were under attack that Obama Biden and you allowed to happen while you all went to sleep while they called all of you repeatedly for help didn't have to happen! Leadership matters November?  had 4 plus decades in DC #Failed
This was never trumps to lose.. everyone knows trump inherited The Obama/Biden economy. Trump and the republicans are full of shit, all or them.Trump has lost his economic edge over Biden
Everything your family touches dies.  Let Jill Biden do it. We know you really don’t care anyway.
Biden has destroyed all the progress you made in maintaining political relevance.
This is laughable. Biden is a true moderate.The only extremist running is #TrumpIsACrybaby who supported the crazy woman claiming hydroxychloraquine &amp; no masks are the cure to the virus. Oh, and she believes in alien DNA as medicine and other insane ideas.
Biden tax plan will take cap gains to 39.6% besides increase in corporate and personal tax rate. Do we want the government to reallocate 40% of the capital?
We can only pray that Harris is at the top of Biden's VP list. America will reject this despicable race hustling anti-American clown. Dems are so out of touch they think people will love this choice...I do!!
He puts your father to shame. Vote Biden!!
Biden praised Harvey Weinstein... Round and round we go.
I had a joke about demon semen, but I keep blurting out the punchline before I finish the rest of the joke
“Why should I vote for joe Biden? It’s not like he’s going to do any major changes when he’s president”   EXACTLY! the last four years have been chaotic asf! Why can’t our next just be another president who just goes to summits and give speeches 😭
I really do not care who Joe Biden picks as VP. The person in the WH called COVID a hoax &amp; his actions since have cost 150k Americans, including three of my close friends, their lives. That’s 150k Families broken. That’s unforgivable &amp; no VP pick will sway me to vote otherwise.
Yes!! You can’t ask him “why did you suggest taking disinfectants for COVID?” or “Why did you retweet a video that says masks don’t work”. You can only ask President Shit for Brains, these type of questions. It’s nice not to be stupid, that’s why Biden gets applause. He’s smart!
Message to all Republicans! Keep saying you will vote for Biden when polled! Let’s make them cry in November!
I find all of these tweets about Biden's supposed demential to be hilarious. Anyone listening to the press conference today has no doubt that he is astute and well versed on the subjects asked.
Are you referring to the Trinity tweet itself? Because yes, that is dumb to be tricked by bot accounts that Warren Dems are about to defect from Biden.
Wow! It’s amazing to see how Joe Biden actually has notes on how he should feel about #KamalaHarris. Pretty obvious who he’s going to pick for his #VP. Here’s the #JoeBidenJob…  It seems like everything will just be a reminder for him and scripted. Who really want that?
Donald Trump vs. Democracy - The Bulwark. Arizona, Florida, Michigan, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin all narrowly favored Trump in 2016; recent polls show him trailing Joe Biden in all six.

Why would he pick someone who has never been elected? Why would he pick someone, who as as AllisonW pointed out, would drag controversy when it's been well established Biden and the DNC don't want that type of selection.
Que up trump and the republicans to start dragging up regurgitated falsehoods, lies, distorts and fake scandal. I hate those mother fuckers and they all must be removed in November. Biden says he will choose his running mate next week
Every time Biden speaks, the President has a press conference. Always trying to win the news cycle.
This woman's disgusting, trump has never said anything like that and he's said a lot of foul shit. Noone is asking her skanky ass for biden, stay the brick home bitch. Bernie Sanders' Campaign Co-Chair Nina Turner Compares Voting For Biden To Eating 'S**t'
That's perfectly fine. But I think you're witnessing a President that has no sense of decorum and definitely doesn't abide by normal presidential standards. If Biden is indeed elected, I expect he will be faced with challenging questions like any president that preceded him.
Then you have just answered your own questions regarding any perceived difference. You yourself have said Trump is an "idiot". It's my contention (and maybe yours) that Biden is not. Do you treat an idiot the same way you treat a thoughtful, introspective person? I know I don't.
Let's try this a different way. Do you agree the method in which Trump conducts a press conference is different than Biden (or virtually any other elected official)? Do you agree that Trump has been subject to numerous misinformation claims when conducting interviews?
Biden and Warren have a virtual fundraiser Friday night. Many Warren peeps thought this was going to be a VP announcement. I wish.

I just watched a press conference where Biden took questions from reporters ABC, CBS, etc. Are you trying to say these are left leaning media organizations? Are you further suggesting that these reporters are not vigorous in their pursuit of a news story?
Wow, what drug(s) is Biden on?  It’s scary that this unstable man is seriously being considered for President.

Clearly you are not recognizing the pugilistic and authoritarian tone of Trump with the press. Compare that to how Biden reacts to them. I don’t consider it bias that you ask a question and have the president belittle you for it.
If you don’t recognize the philosophical as well as emotional difference between Trump and Biden then you don’t understand humanity.

Liberals if Biden picks a non POC/female VP candidate: “Classic Dems, another old white man, no diversity, smh not progressive 😤”  Liberals when Biden does pick a POC/female VP candidate: “ugh not THIS one classic Dems just pandering not sincere she’s a bird smh 😤”
And yet Bolton won't vote Biden when faced with "not my guy" or what he sees as a threat to democracy.
This is a disingenuous take. Biden has made numerous public appearances and has spoken out about every major issue since he became the presumptive nominee.
ask Biden for advice
Try not using grammar and then ask who the racist is. Hillary did it. Gore did it. Biden did it.
MAKE AMERICA WELL AGAIN! VOTE BIDEN!!!
There is also a Biden fundraiser with Newsom, Katie Porter and Elizabeth August 11th.
Ma’am these are not rumors there are countless videos of Biden sniffing and rubbing little girls. So much so their facial expressions change and they try to move away from him.
but Biden can touch little girls, a pedophiles videos remain right?
seems that they've made their vows together to the American people &amp; consolidated the Biden-Clinton Democratic Party ticket to confront the Trump-Pence administration in the 2020 elections. They might also want Pres. Carter to address the Convention.💰
Not demanding it has caused the Dems to split. The ACA was written by the hospital CEOs and insurance companies that you mention. They’re the ones funding the biden (and trump) campaigns, which is why he doesn’t support Medicare for All. The Dem *base* needs to demand now
Thank you  ! Always with the verifiable facts about the patriarchy. 👏🏼👏🏼

My concern is not January 20,2021 noon can’t come soon enough if  wins, my concerns are the time  between November 4th,2020 to January 20,2021 11:59am if Joe Biden wins.
And that is where he’ll take this country. Be careful what you wish for. As much as you must hate Trump  he will take us to a better place. God help us all if Biden wins.

That’s how we know this whole thing was fraudulent - just theater. If biden really cared, he would’ve appointed a black woman to search for a black woman!!!!!!! Foh!!!! (And yes I’m voting for biden bc mama ain’t raise no fool!!!!)

Biden only looking for females... and at his age... sets up the first female President to get into office without winning an election.  Talk about insulting.
Kamala and Cory Booker always seemed drooling for a chance to get in front of a camera, but in terms of Presidential Ambition Lust, she's not off the charts.  What's damning is her record.  What's damning is Biden's decision to choose a VP solely based on their identify + gender.
you should have been an abortion
I’m sure the Biden’s will love that.
I get that with calls for defund the police and people fearing race riots, and those Trump TV ads, a black female with that kind of history is an enticing pick.  Idk. When Biden said he was only going to look at females for VP, I tuned out...
Neither will Joe Biden
I wish all my followers would cut and tweet:  JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN
Voting like hell for Joe Biden and praying that all this bullshit is over so I can sleep better at night.
now its the trump virus, the dems have been trying very hard to get trump out since he got in, now they will blame him for covid, racism, george flynn, all the confederate generals, its all his fault, joe biden is a career liar, hes a dingbat, things will be worse w/ him in w.h.
She never said Biden raped her. On the other hand, E. Jean Caroll has accused Trump of raping her and has DNA to back her claim. Trump is fighting against providing his DNA in court. Wonder why?
Is this a new reality TV show? Since it uses caps, I'm assuming it's a title. Is their show being cancelled if Biden wins?   Aside from the racist, dog whistle aspect...
My son has a pit bull that loves to talk to you. She just sits there staring at you and barks. No idea what she is trying to say. I get the same feeling when I watch Biden talk. #Trump2020Back when i did Indian American advocacy work, i had an hr long breakfast w Biden discussing Jammu Kashmir. He is no Islamist. India needs a strong America, so even if he's not in line w Modi, he's infinitely bttr than Trump who is weakening us globally. (Also Saudis fund Trump)
Yo, look at Biden’s background and milquetoast environmental policy. Point being that we don’t have time for his ineffectual dismissive attitude over such a pressing catastrophe. Read my original comment, register that the Lincoln project backers gave us Trump. Dems need to act
I hope Klob decides she wants to be VP again and Biden picks her.
Chip in to elect Joe Biden
Good rub, Biden/Harris 2020!
Our Country is set to fall if Biden is elected. With little to no Police and handicapping their Authority, Officers will quit and who will replace them. Patriots will band together and that will be the start of the end. Civil War will destroy us, while Foreign enemies wait.
Tulsi is by far the best. The brightest blacked out star of the Democrat Party🧐 of course, her FP would be exactly opposite from Biden’s as she is against the neocon war mongering filth which dominate our militaristic American Supremacy based FP

Karen Bass, A Potential Biden VP Pick, Praised Scientology At Church Opening In 2010
This is when we Democrats start criticizing our own and start screwing up the election. We do it every time. 🤦🏼‍♀️ I keep saying we need to FOCUS and see no negatives at all about Biden or his VP. We need to be like the MAGATS and worship blindly. Just until Nov 3.
“The president has to be part of the solution, not the problem,” Biden added.
Can I ask you why you’re voting for Biden then? Can you give me some policies you stand for
Biden on Trump floating delaying the election: “this president went so far to say what I warned he would say four months ago. He thinks maybe we should delay the election. Be prepared. Be prepared.”  Via pooler
I will actually vote for Biden if he picks Clyburn as VP out of respect for owning K-hive, warren losers, and all women in one swift blow
I agree. Most of the people I know don't follow Twitter and when I tell them about the drama that's being generated here over Biden's selection of VP, they think it's crazy. However once they're aware of what's going on, they too have a strong opinion about the prospects.
“We have to tell them the truth. And some of the truth is going to be hard, because science – masks do matter," Biden said at a fundraiser this evening, via pooler    "Social distancing does matter. You've got to get the curve down and keep it going down."
Not exaggerated.  The stories are not gossip, but factual. I am stunned to have just learn about Bass only a few minutes ago.  Would not want anyone one from that group near Biden.
Biden HAS foreign policy
I'll vote for Biden even if he chooses a goat as VP.   Having said that, I don't see as an advantage to have a scientology fan in that position. That's one of the creepiest cults in this crazy country of ours.
"This will take more than just holding our noses at the ballot box and voting for Biden," writes Zoe Fenson. "We need to make sure he wins by as close to a landslide as possible."
That's Biden's hometown.
New Polls:  60% disapproval of racist, pathological liar, corrupt criminal #donaldtrump. Only 36% approval. #JoeBiden up by 15 in one poll &amp; 11 points in another poll.  No doubt, #TrumpIsANationalDisgrace #TransitionToBiden
Florida teen charged as “mastermind” in Twitter hack hitting Biden, Bezos, and others
100%.   An "Avengers Assemble!" strategy against Trump is the way to go.   It'll give Biden a team of strong surrogates during the campaign. It'll also calm the fears of some people who worry about Biden's age by letting them know there is a strong team that comes with him.
Joe Biden's search for a running mate enters final stretch | 1010 WINS
I know what he’s capable of. Biden is literally the devil
Faux centrist Biden thinks he can be God’s gift to all people. Minorities, moms, the rust belt, disaffected Rs—bubble states. Just hobble out of the basement and climb astride a blue donkey, carry green branches and wave them at anti orange passerby’s who drop to their knees.
I don't think she's a leading contender but that was 10 years ago and people evolve. Still, in my opinion, Biden has better choices.
My list of Trump-Biden voters on The Office: Jim, Oscar, Andy, Meredith, Kevin, Phyllis, Kelly. (Remember, it’s Scranton!)
Kamila Harris Jailed black ppl  Tammy Duckworth thinks that progressives wont win swing districts  Susan rice is a shitlib   Warren killed bernies campaign   And now Karen Bass is a fucking Scientologist!  Biden is fucking irredeemable. He’s never going to cater to the left.
Biden/Bottoms appeals to my 12-year-old sense of humor.

This entire process has been frustrating. Frankly I’m blaming Biden. He shouldn’t have said from months ago VP was going to be a woman. These misogynistic attacks and mud throwing for months has been horrible. Enough!
You're right. Biden can keep quiet and let Trump endorse pizza places in the middle of a global pandemic.
NBA does couldn’t care less about Americans.They support China &amp; want to affect the election to Biden.They are despicable. Couldn’t care less about black lives or the lives of those in China being oppressed.The corporate cowards that hide behind the misery of others for profit
Which characters on The Office are Trump-Biden voters?
Same way Biden is leading in the poles
&gt;this is how you "love" the military. President  or any other president NEVER did, nor will do. America voting for decent honorable humane Joe Biden  You're not nor ever will be in the league of Joe Biden and President Barack Hussein Obama!
I SO agree. For Americans to know in advance who BIden will have around him to work with him to right the economy , repair international relationships, put Americans to work with federal projects, calm the distemper. -  all to look forward to.
A senile Joe Biden will be good for the United States. If we engage of wars of aggression, forced democracy, bully tactics, bombings of children, pedophilia of elites, and massive racism we can just say that we don't remember that stuff. 😃
you can't blame biden for anything. he's not home
Pretty conveniently placed given Biden is supposed to reveal someone by next week. Wow.
Just saw a guy in a Biden mask
You beat Hillary 4 years ago. Probably the most unlike able candidate to run for President except for you. She still got 3 million more votes and you needed Russia’s help to win. You would get crushed by Obama just like you will by Biden. #NobodyLikesTrump
And they were trying to talk about Hunter Biden and nepotism??
Joe Biden should say something but he has strong black men &amp; women working in high level positions. Someone need to say, now, what is being said about Kamala Harris is not a reflection of the campaign and is unacceptable overall. Kamala Harris standing alone like Hillary Clinton.
Am I a bad Democrat?  I don’t care if Karen Bass went to a Scientology event in her district and said what politicians say? 🤷‍♂️ Trump said there are “fine people” who are white nationalists and locked kidnapped kids in cages. I’ll vote Biden no matter who is picked. 🤷‍♂️
A real 2020 turn would be a Karen becoming Vice President of the United States
Wrong story   Ukraine/Biden's using Russians
I didn't see that post but its common sense to know the mental state of biden
Oh, this is a normal process. Do send me the notes where Tim Kaine was called “called over ambitious” and had “no remorse” or even when those articles came out re: joe Biden?
biden told ingraham that he met with drs. 3 -or- 4 times a week...for an hr and 15 mins...wha?
Biden could pick my cat as VP and then shoot it on 5th Ave and I still vote for him. Still, he should choose a woman of color who is not tied to Scientology.

Biden's running mate announcement pushed back, likely will not come next week
I don’t believe so.  Not yet, at least.  She’s being pushed hard to be Biden’s VP by various Foreign Policy elite in DC.  A number of senior figures in the Biden campaign don’t like her.
WHERE WAS JOE BIDEN?
Barack Obama worked for China four years ago and all the Dems are working for China now. You need to get down to the bottom of it . what does china have on Joe Biden which makes the Democrats protect him so much?

Buckle up, everyone! We are about to see a smear campaign like we have never seen on whomever the VP choice is. GOP knows we have the better options with ANYONE BUT TRUMP/PENCE. Be vigilant! Look up for facts! We need to be as nuts about Biden &amp; VP as the Magats are for Trump!
#ChristopherDodd was right to tell #JoeBiden that #KamalaHarris would stab him in the back at the earliest opportunity; but #rapist #RacistJoeBiden is a #rightwing #Republican like #KamalaChameleon, so he deserves to be betrayed by his running mate...
Is trump gonna debate Biden? If he does debate, will it be easily apparent that he is medically impaired?
Media really honing in on any and every VP candidate not named Eizabeth Warren and I’m just curious when people decided collectively that she was no longer in the running. Biden himself is hosting a fundraiser with her today.
I was on 538 this evening and Biden's lead in some of the swing states has shrunk. In NC and OH where he had a slight lead he is now trailing slightly.
Joe Biden allies are willing to consider a Church of Scientology ally before Kamala Harris for VP because she dared challenge him in a debate.  That’s the headline of why Karen Bass is getting op-eds supporting her VP consideration.
It’s not Hunter anymore . Went to Brazil to become Heidi Biden
I know. I hate Scientology.  But I only care if it hurts Biden. And anyway he hasn’t chosen her.
Let  President if you fk wth elections or  President Biden have a say, since you won't be there.
Odds are low. But if Biden just happens to drop that info,  you need to break the news in this thread.   Accomplished actress / political reporter.
Neither did Hillary. Warren has basically been erased from the media. Talk about misogyny. The thing is that Biden can't really do much except make a decision so it all stops and explain it so all the women understand his reasoning.  But after that its the general which is worse.
True but also let's not forget about Pedo Biden
I like the idea, though I don’t see Biden going that far.
I mean, if anyone watched that and *doesn’t* think Biden/Warren has to be the ticket.. we just have nothing else to discuss. 🤷🏻‍♂️  #WarrenForVP

If Biden knew how to fix America, why didn't he tell Obama?
Interesting how misogynists like  keep claiming people in California don’t like  and yet all the folks who actually know her are saying the opposite. 🤔
Yes to the levels of the Obama/Biden years. Remember the days of 1 pct growth? #Trump2020LandslideVictory
Do you know how a public option works? Do you know the differences between Trump's and Biden's plans for healthcare? MOTHERFUCKER DO YOU KNOW WHAT THE WORD MITIGATE MEANS???
If Biden does not pick one of the following three women of excellence, I will be very disappointed: Kamala Harris Elizabeth Warren Susan Rice
Running scared by Biden and his socialist friends, BE AFRAID,
Twitter is manipulating all traffic. We all know this. Media will hide this information like they are hiding Biden and all crimes of obamagate.
These right wing news media are trying to discredit every black woman running to be Biden's VP. They are digging up everything they can about their past even tho all of them have been a public official for years. Imagine if we actually get a black woman on the Supreme Court
They do not all donate to him where do you get your information from? You honestly think the elites would back Trump over Biden? You honestly think a career politician like Biden is on the up-and-up?
still not as bad as literally travelling to an island to fuck children.
Biden is literally the left's nomination for president lol "most on the left"
Please tell this to Joe Biden and send him a bill his first week as President that finally and forever ends the Federal prohibition on marijuana.

America is with Joe Biden all the way!
I like her.  There is really no one on the list that I could not get behind. I think Harris would be a great VP and personally I can see her as a competent and good Pres too. But I am good with whoever truthfully  I feel good about Biden and I just want the Trump nightmare to end
I grew up a Reagan Republican. We supported and protected our troops, and were loyal to our allies. That party is gone. Biden 2020.
What about Biden’s son? Making millions in Ukraine...
Someone literally tweeted last week that biden isnt doing anything and hes been largely out of the public eye and then someone else responded and was like nah hes been doing a lot and the person came back with “oh actually I see hes had one event a week.Its just not covered much”
What’s the huge fear?  SCOTUS is solidly right and a Senate majority of any would be slight.    Biden isn’t AOC, and I’ll gladly endure four years of policy I disagree with (and fight) to save the party.   Nothing else will send the message required to shock the conscience.
The supporters of the blacks should stop pressuring Biden to pick up a black VP. That will hurt Biden, and it's sure he will be defeated. Biden should pick up either the Michigan's Gov Gretchen Whitmer,  or New Mexico's Gov Michelle Grisham.
Under President Biden and a Dem Senate, add two justices to correct for McConnell’s dereliction of duty in 2016, which led to the appontment of Justice Gorsuch. Bring the total number of justices to eleven
Your so close   You now have even more confusion condition. Cause That's joe biden state   You Dementia Freak
Did anyone say that Biden was "too ambitious" when he was being vetted?  Seems women are always being held to a different standard.
I'm sure they'll give him a mail-in ballot, too. Ya know, so he can vote for Biden. 🙄
For everyone concerned about Jor Biden feelings, I don't give 0 fucks. Biden will be the leader of the Democratic party, a sitting congressional senator is being targeted in the most racist &amp; sexist manner. He can't remain silent especially when the Black woman is defending him.
Disqualifying. Biden has an embarrassment of riches with the other women on the short list.
It is mystifying why  Biden’s campaign staff does not understand that fact. You are completely right
Biden is never going to announce a VP 🤣
Obama looks older than Biden lol

Yea I disagreed with them. Even though it was obvious Biden was going to win after Super Tuesday, I still think primary voters should have voted for whoever their preferred candidate was. Of course the pandemic through a monkey wrench into everything.
Vote for biden and you get this all over.
I was responding to her getting attacked by Biden supporters. Don’t know why you would think otherwise. Oh wait yes I do. You’re just looking to yell at anyone you disagree with. Have fun with that.
Well said Bill.  In reality, the only candidate running for pres. is Trump - people will either vote for him or against him.  Biden essentially is a non-entity.  Nobody decides that they're voting for Biden because they like what he brings to the table
I’m voting Biden regardless,  but with a lot less enthusiasm if he picks “praising crazy religions” person as  VP.    That’s a deal breaker right there.

Do you think the ACA didn't expand access to healthcare? Or do you think Joe Biden had nothing to do with that? Or do you think Joe Biden has no other ambitions on healthcare?  Is someone lying to you and are you believing their lies? Where do you get these ideas?
Biden got 1% in Iowa in 2008, dropped out and was perfect Veep candidate for Obama.
You're missing one obvious point ... Maybe Biden wants to focus on the domestic dumpster that's going on so having a globetrotting VP/State team is what's needed to rebuild ties with allies.  He's certainly not going to be flying the 1M miles that Hillary did.
Except that half of Florida has  #TrumpVirus and Biden is leading by several points. You are the Minority. Please be the of the Silent ones. 🙄
I guess I'll never get to find out what a defined Biden candidacy looks like
"Joe Biden lies about wanting to increase the minimum wage" "Joe Biden wants to limit access to healthcare"  How did you come to believe these sort of assertions that are so verifiably false?
She is carrying Biden. We NEED Warren. #VPWarren
I get that you're using the "settle for Biden" argument against Bass. But the analogy breaks down because we are essentially in the "primary" phase of the VP selection process, not the general election.
Biden doesn’t. Trump is the most incompetent, narcissistic, childish imbecile this country has ever elected. My only question is why it took so long for so many to see that?
A Florida teen was arrested in connection with a hack of 130 Twitter accounts, including celebrities like Elon Musk,  Bill Gates and Joseph R. Biden Jr.
Is this tweet sponsored by Biden's campaign?  Keep ignoring the woman running.  Sexist much?
“Biden is shit because he won’t do X and Y.”  “Well actually he will kind of do X and will definitely do Y.”  “Hah, you believe him??”  “Yes and here is evidence.”  “...” “Biden is *actually* shit because he won’t do Z and so on and so forth.”
I love  but I can't believe that any interview with Dr. Jill Biden could ever be a "great" interview.   One thing is for sure... her appearance on Fox News Tuesday... means that  won't be announcing his VP pick on Tuesday.
If the Biden campaign picks anyone besides Kamala at this point, white supremacy wins.
This whisper campaign against  has to end. I want an ambitious person to be VP.   How many times did  run for Prez — isn’t  he ambitious? And we need someone who CAN and WANTS to run for Prez in 2024 if Biden doesn’t at 82 yrs old! #KamalaHarris #VPHarris
Americans know and trust Joe Biden. Joe’s also always been liked, admired and respected by his Republican colleagues across the aisle. We do want Joe Biden for President, he’ll restore honor, dignity and order to the U.S.A..

To every Harris supporter who latched on to Biden instead of Warren, Castro, Sanders, Booker or pretty much any of the other viable Democratic primary candidates after Harris dropped out, this is the thanks you get.
Joe Biden wants to end the era of big companies paying nothing in taxes
The details in the story are not pretty.   Demings spent her police career protecting and serving the Orlando PD as much as the people of Orlando.  The fact that it's a conflict of interest inherent to policing does not make it any less reprehensible.
Would you say you put more effort into preventing a second Trump term or more effort into advocating against Joe Biden?
Chip in to elect Joe Biden and other Democrats on the ballot
FFS Twitter. Joe Biden is not picking crazy Scientology lady, nor is he going to pick crazy demon semen dr.  This is not Trump naming ‘acting’ cabinet positions. Joe will pick somebody trusted, experienced, smart, principled.   He’s picking Kamala Harris, mark my words
Maybe they know instead that if Biden picks a Black woman as VP, all the press will talk about from here on in is busing and "reparations."   It's inevitable, and there will be a number of "gotcha" issues designed to put Biden on the spot.
I'd love it if you could point out where any of us have said that Joe Biden is affirmatively good. I think I've been very clear that he's not. We're acting like a person who wants to expand access to healthcare is better than someone who wants to limit access to healthcare.
Not one mention of Biden in the entire article but like a lemming you just throw out the new catchphrases your masters spoon feed you.  But continue on.
By jumping on this and making it trend without yet knowing all the facts, we are playing right into the hands of the Republicans.  They are just beginning their dirty oppo-research against Biden.

14) I ask you as fellow women, plz let Joe Biden know we NEED to know unequivocally where he stands. We know his record on women's issues. We need to see those beliefs in practice that when he has the chance to root out misogyny/racism in his own circle, HE DOES SO. This matters.

How could Biden not want Warren's energy and expertise on the ticket? She's the best choice.
Before Kamala Harris dropped out of the 2020 election, she held the 2nd most Black support based on statistical data, and had the most congressional Black caucus endorsements. This target on her potential nomination by Biden old white dogs is problematic just like Biden silence.
Harris took a cheap and dishonest shot at Biden about busing. It was dumb to bring the topic up as well.  You guys really want busing back for Dems to have to defend?
Both DJT and Biden are racists and fascists. Follow that syllogism when it comes to supporters.
Really? Stop trying to tell us what life in the suburbs is going to be like under Biden, when it couldn’t be worse than what it is under YOUR failed attempts at being president.  What are you doing other than spending your days tweeting and watching tv????
OK I know that between Trump, Biden, and revolution, you would choose revolution. New question time. Between Donald Trump and Joe Biden, who do you prefer?
That's how a normal, sensible person would try for the policies they want, rather than voting for Jill Stein and saying Trump is better than Biden
Biden winning is the sequel to The Irishman. Press conference on this matter to come.
Oh. Now, with a potential Biden victory, you start caring about the debt again. Great.
Interesting how the press is all but ignoring Warren-- the best and most popular choice by far, nationally -- and forcing Biden to pick a Black woman.  You trust this MSM to help Dems? After 2016?

Elizabeth Warren says 40,000 people are attending the grassroots fundraiser with Joe Biden.  It comes on the end-of-month fundraising deadline.
I've already told you I'm not a Biden voter so I'm not sure what the relevance is of that last sentence. But it's definitely not a "privilege" to expect different things from one party or the other when the parties have different platforms and do different things.
Can you read more than one headline? That same poll stated that  "Biden has lengthened his lead over President Trump in the latest Rasmussen Report. The new national survey finds Biden with 48% support among Likely U.S. Voters to Trump’s 42%."Joe Biden is your last hope and that's not saying much. All those candidates you had to run for president and that was the best you guys could do.I can't wait for four more years so you guys could go nuts.
Biden's pathetic attempt at pandering to Black voters.
Forget about what transpired between Biden &amp; Kamala. Why would u not have issue with a man or men telling a female shes too ambitious? That's a disgrace for a woman to see no harm in that. Tell u something else...WE NEED MORE FEMALE LEADERS. WE WOULDNT BE IN THIS MESS
I will vote for Biden 😏😘😚 #seducemein5words
Stop camping for Biden
Assuming Biden becomes POTUS, which I know we shouldn't count on despite polling and everything, I really hope he makes for a very boring one who predicts his interests long in advance, does no stunts, and where we'd need to tune in to hear to the White House.

Biden will lose Because of Biden  PERIODT
Next time try not making so many things up. I hope it's a Biden/Rice or Biden/Duckworth ticket, but I never had the slightest intent to vote for Trump. He's almost uniquely bad for the nation.
You have a very narrow notion of what these voters look like and it leads you into error. I am a technocratic socialist. I have never yet voted for a republican president, despite thinking some of their candidates were good people. It was obvious to me I'd vote for Biden long ago
They won’t, and they’ll call the cops on you like Biden if you do.
Biden is not a fascist authoritarian. See the diff now? Biden knows that Congress chooses the electors &amp; date &amp; time of election, only.
Thought you could barely tell the difference between Trump &amp; Biden.  A lot changed in...a day.
He was for same sex marriage before Obama, so I'm willing to give him a chance. And Biden was VP for conservative voters. It was his experience in DC &amp; Obama's inexperience.
So here's the question. Does anyone realize who will be running the country if  Biden took office ??  Answer . Pelosi and company
Democracy will not prevail not with Biden, sorry Dad you're solely mistaken..
Like I don't know what more I have to say to these ppl, even hilary lost they blamed the Progressives for it.  You think if she would of won they would give us the credit.  No they wouldn't.  Same with biden, how is this hard to understand
Biden and any other politician from either side of the aisle, should stand firmly against even the notion of such a constitutional violation by #Chump.
Trump is a whole bowl of shit and biden is just half a bowl of shit. I refuse to eat it, and you all are saying you'll just eat the half bowl... and trying to convince me to do so..... and trying to get others to do so as well.
Let me look into your future...I see...I see....crying...yelling at the sky...snot bubbles...And a Joe Biden tank top discarded on top of a pile of “I’m With Her!” Bumper stickers....
I want every person in Congress on record about this. Every, “don’t tread on me.” Every, “wearing a mask infringes on my rights.” Because if you say that or are an elected official and you condone delaying a presidential election, you stand for nothing.
Your fucking plan is not going to work. That public pressure is going to be like a gentle breeze in the summer to biden. It won't phase him at all. Your plan is like putting a square peg in a circle, its not going to happen.  My plan is to withhold my vote
Biden/Warren! Let’s go!
Chill Out pfffft Please, she clearly states that she will not endorse Biden...READ!
Im not settling for biden because if I do, these literally no point in being on the left. Just settle for who ever runs on the democratic ticket for the rest of your life.
Please dont endorse Biden....
Yep which means the MSM is doing a great job of poisoning everybody with their fake news. But there is still time left. Biden has to come out of his basement one day and speak. Then ppl will know how clueless he is.
I’d add one more thing: will the VP candidate help with particular constituencies Biden needs to secure an electoral college victory?
Looking forward to your administration bring honor, dignity, and the admiration of the other civilized countries back to the USA, Mr. Biden.
Like it or not, the USA has a binary system. A vote for anyone but Biden (or not voting and failing to do your civic duty) is a vote for Trump. It's like FDR said to Progressives when president, "Now, your job is to MAKE me have to put those policies thru. First win the office.
So you're going to put the incompetent wannabe dictator back in office? Because like it or not, the USA has a binary political system and a vote for anyone but Biden (or not voting at all and failing your civic duty) is a vote for Trump.
Give me Biden over tRump any day of the week!
The hardest job in the world is Biden’s sign-language translator!
Anxiety, depression, etc are all going to skyrocket from this. And liberals like you think it would’ve been any different under Biden. The spanish fly lasted for multiple years too. More than the United States will have this issue for quite a while. Stop hating the United States
Hmm, just was reading a Melinda Clarke post vs Biden and poof, it's gone. Things like this only happen to me? Doubtful
What I don’t understand. Biden isn’t everything I want in a president but he is 100% closer to my views than Trump. Why risk 4 more years when Biden can get our foot in the door of the direction we want to go
Biden is on my last nerve too, welcome to the club!
You're a Trojan Horse for Russia  Sleepy Joe Biden is just a Trojan Horse for the Radical Left Agenda. He will do whatever they want!
it’s a joke lol it’s referencing a tweet ziwe made about her voting for biden
But what’s the alternative? Also, the fight doesn’t end at the presidential ballot box. They have a lot to say about Biden but nothing about anyone at the local level because that’s what matters. That’s why Republicans winin the long run.
Then I’m happy to be a Biden supporter.
. #NobodyLikesMe except #FakeNewsMedia with Rigged Questions Leaked by  And  😂😂
I had a joke about demon semen, but I keep blurting out the punchline before I finish the rest of the joke
Whether or not, it'll be denied just like Biden has all his marbles.
“Why should I vote for joe Biden? It’s not like he’s going to do any major changes when he’s president”   EXACTLY! the last four years have been chaotic asf! Why can’t our next just be another president who just goes to summits and give speeches 😭
Message to all Republicans! Keep saying you will vote for Biden when polled! Let’s make them cry in November!
Yep, from Biden too.
Looks like we don't have long to wait before Biden's choice is known. Hoping for Rice, Duckworth would also be a good choice. I like Bottoms but she isn't clearly qualified. Meh on many of the others.
Joe Biden NEEDS to pick Val Demings for his VP. She is the only pick I am enthused about.
Just how far left is Joe Biden, really?  bhuahahaha
If anyone listened to Biden today &amp; heard trump talk afterwards about USA being independent of making products, you should know  said things so so close to what Biden stated his plan is. Now theres another trump who's plagiarizing
Mayor Jenny should be Biden's running mate.  They would make quite the coherent pair.
Mail in voting makes Biden a lock to win in November! Senate, house and presidency will be blue!
I know it’s a joke that joe Biden is running. I feel you on that
The silence feels pretty weird. I don't think there's even a lot of pressure on Biden to pick a veep, and there's this feeling of inevitability about the whole thing.
please have both trump and biden address their mental health live during the debate....This is actual sociopath like behavior...trying to appear cool to the public with bartstool interview and golfing with Favre...now trying to appear “focused” on covid-19
I don't like the vote shaming and I just wanted to be clear that my rabid tweets of Democrats and Biden are just that!
Just know that if you are a Bernie supporter I got nothing but love for you, even if you feel like you have to vote for Biden...my beef is with Biden and his cohorts not you!  PS just dont tell me that I should cause Trump!
Then travelled tirelessly to campaign for her. I'm sorry, was he not allowed to try and win? Stop being an idiot. Clinton wasn't a great candidate. Biden isn't either.
It sounds like close your eyes and vote Biden...😬
Do you really think Biden has no policy platform?  Or is it a critique of the DNC?  Btw, this is America...2 party system...down to 2 candidates?   If you can’t say one candidate is decidedly better but not perfect, you don’t understand the 2 party system.
Biden lies alot but I will vote for him because I believe he is not a fascist or wannabe dictator
Joe Biden the absent minded professor for president. If you don’t vote for me you ain’t black 😂😂
And Biden lock up a lot of brown and black people through is fucking crime bill
And the reason we have trump is because of obama and Biden did nothing for 8 years for the poor people
The insurance company are the one sponsoring biden that why and don't get me wrong I hate trump too and I want Biden to win I just don't think anything will change other than change of tone from the oval office
seems that they've made their vows together to the American people &amp; consolidated the Biden-Clinton Democratic Party ticket to confront the Trump-Pence administration in the 2020 elections. They might also want Pres. Carter to address the Convention.💰
That's awful. I am guilty of not keeping up with that. How sad that this Administration can treat citizens like this. Hoping Biden will fix that if hes elected. Those poor people
Biden team thinks they've already won, that's why they are serving you a half bowl of shit...
My God ....of course we dont hear about the power!!!! Wth? Is it that theres no money? I know trump is an asshole. Hopefully biden will be in ofc &amp; do something
But you're from Australia telling Americans to vote for Biden...what an odd tweet!
😱 OMG, The Systemwide antiChina Propoganda is not for MAGA but to tear down China for  Presidential Election2024⁉️ A Wise man told me Fire Pompeo &amp; Save the World from WWIII. Postpone 2020Election. Trump/Biden team up.

I have to question the motives of all these people. You won't see me excited about Biden, but I'm voting for him. What's the alternative? Their words though imply to not vote for him. It's almost like they want to influence people to not vote for him, and give Trump 4 more years.
Biden offers nothing all he is saying his am not trump
Trump is such a disgrace to this country he’s going to try to rig the election suppress voter’s we cannot let this happen we all have to vote. Biden has to win by a landslide
This is how the Biden camp is going to play not debating...corona virus concerns
You really haven't disputed anything i have said like not one thing..... you can't see eye to eye when you have no response. Like didnt Citigroup choose each of obama's cabinet members? You think its going to be any different with biden?
When will Biden be arrested in the Ukraine?
I just don't understand how progressives think biden or the establishment will listen to anyone on the left. Like look at how aoc is even treated by democrats within her own party... he's not going to pass anything progressives want. It will be back to business as usual
Why in the world do you think biden is someone you think you can reason with.  He literally won with no progressive support and is literally winning right now without even trying...
And that is where he’ll take this country. Be careful what you wish for. As much as you must hate Trump  he will take us to a better place. God help us all if Biden wins.
Are you  comparing Biden to Trump. I’ll take Trump any day. Anyone has to be blind or incompetent themselves not to see Mr. Biden is off.Early stages of Alzheimer’s.
Biden? I guess you haven’t seen this! He hates black people. Or as he calls black people “those” people...Just a heads up...Oh, and it’s from CNN
This is worse than torture!   Who are the evil doers?  That's why I be like Fuk Democrats they can Rot In Hell....Fuk You Too Biden Piece of Shit..
Ryan Knight!  Haven’t really missed ya.  More crying about the progressive agenda that you &amp; yours didn’t promote well enough.  The failure? Yours.  Now prioritize. Say ‘even tho I’m a stupid FN moron, I will minimize the damage by voting Biden’...  Ty ty
Call the Biden police counselors.
lies &amp; we die. Should you really care for worldwide peace and America’s prosperity, demand Pompeo to resign. Postpone 2020Election, urging Trump &amp; Biden work as White House Team to resolve problems that we’re facing.
🤣🤣🤣🤣 annihilate him with name calling? Biden has thicker skin than trump. He wont have a tantrum bc hes not liked. No way can trump beat Biden on domestic or foreign affairs. NO WAY! Name calling maybe, but Biden is not a child fighting in the playground. trump is!!
Biden can put pressure and he will while Trump supports trophy hunting
Joe Biden rejected being interviewed by   What’s he afraid of?  #chicken
U obviously don’t spend much time in the hoods. Or Ud see how clear Biden is not getting their vote
With Joe Biden.🤪
You are so fucken blinded by hatery to Trump you needed to twist it all. Biden is a one who abuses women and kids that get near him.
For once, thank you for having the heart to spare us all for having to look at your dictatorous, tyrant ass in the Bronx. We'd rather have Biden throw out the ceremonial pitch than you.
Are the Russians paying Biden to pick Rice? Am I in and weird bubble? How does this make sense to Joe?
Biden will face a depression and collapse of the stock market when the short-term measures are done.  Face it.  We are truly in for a bad four years.  It will be a horrible inheritance, financially.  But we will rebuild.
What VP candidate can bring the young vote &amp; Latinos? That's the candidate Biden will pick  Agree?
At least he did the interview.Biden is a joke. Let him go on Chris Wallace an see how he does  Their afraid to put him to the test he’d be  bum ring all the way.
No you mean the Democrats created.Biden has not one idea on how to fix anything the Dems created.He’ll just have the name of President but for sure he won’t be doing a thing if he’s elected the others will be ruineing the country. Hello Venezuela. Hope you’ll like to eat garbage
Mark has a story to tell how how Biden will allow poor people to live in the surburbs
You're going to hate Biden's vp
I wish all of my followers would cut and paste this and tweet it out right now:  JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
Hope Barron can tone it down without making Biden cry.
You have no clue . Just like Biden
Why is it when Biden says something that seems ofd base nobody hears about it and when they do and it vomes out wrong it is a slip of the tounge but when the President says something interpreted differently he is the worst man in the world?
Works for me All I know is the cabinet that will be part of the coming Biden administration is going to be historically amazing
Don’t get your hopes too high Biden  and Anthony
I believe WE have that hunger now. We just have to maintain it through &amp; beyond November.  This cannot be over even if Biden wins
By any means necessary. I will, if it's my last breath get to my polling place and mark that circle next to Biden, straight down blue on the ballot. No way I'm missing this vote.  #TrumpOutBidenIn
Biden should include in his campaign promotion “some who follow Trump are NAZIs”.
I bought a subscription to  because of the quality of your article.
I don't care if Joe Biden sleeps for four years, as long as his transition team clears the decks and puts educated, honest people back into the positions in the Executive Branch.    All of them should be confirmed, not temps.
Biden doesn’t support free college tuition and supports Medicaid for all who want it, not Medicaid for all. Don’t confuse Sanders with Biden. Don’t know his position on trophy hunting but I know he’s not an advocate for it as Trump is.
Let’s see how Biden does without teleprompters and answering actual  not a Trumper I’m just saying he gives scripted speeches but never takes questions..
We disagree. As a veteran and a Roman Catholic, I understand that kneeling is a sign of respect. And Biden is a middle of the road Democrat. Trump’s rantings can’t change that.
As a United States Army veteran I respect our flag as much as anyone. I also respect our First Amendment and the Right of Free Speech. I understand athletes kneeing. It’s a sign of respect for our Constitution. And Biden’s son wasn’t a trophy hunter as are Trump’s two sons.
such level of suspicion of Russia &amp; other foreign powers interference in the 2016 election that got Pres. Trump impeached on an Ukraine controversy. The Democratic ticket with Mr Joe Biden &amp; Mrs Hillary Clinton will be the best for a rematch in 2020.
Russia &amp; other foreign powers might've interfered in the 2016 election as Pres. Trump got impeached over an Ukraine's controversy. The 2020 election will have to be a rematch with Mr Joe Biden in the Democratic ticket together with Mrs Hillary Clinton.
Joe Biden with not defund the police  .Trump supports female pedophile  Maxwell and wish her well. WHAT does she hace on him
Joe Biden will not defund the police. DONALD Trump, The man that wishes pedophiles well  is lying to you.
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
That assumes that Roberts will show up to administer the oath to Biden. What if he doesn't show up?
"Tucker Carlson says he's warning America that if Joe Biden wins. Trumps version of America will no longer exist."  Great!
bruh that joe biden nigga is a whole dumbass 🤣🤣🤣
No, Joe Biden Didn&amp;#8217;t Introduce Man in Blackface at 1985 Fundraiser  via
Trump the only thing devastating is your mouth. You saw Biden campaign’s promo of Biden with Obama and you’re shaking in your boots. Trump you’re incompetent, way over your head. Get out of the race. Putin will give you Dacha near the sea. Just go.
If not  will you still vote?  was my first choice for Presidential candidate and I think she dropped out far too soon. But I've already voted in the primaries for Biden in her absence and will vote for him in Nov. no matter who the VP is
in 2008 then Gov. Sarah Palin couldn't stop Sen. Joe Biden from getting himself elected as Vice President. Now in 2020 with COVID-19 being a real heath crisis, no other woman can help unseat the Trump-Pence administration, but Mrs Hillary Clinton.⚔️
I got the first Biden sign I could and it's the only sign in my neck of the woods so far. I have yet to see a Trump sign in NJ. There were some in 2016, but not a lot.
I've already contributed because I will vote for Biden any way. Our democracy hangs in the balance.   was my first choice as Presidential candidate, but I see the bigger picture. A Biden administration will be led by a coalition of the best our country has. Vote
Love it! Welcome to the real world Democrats. Love how liberals who create all the havoc, anarchy, destruction, arson, murder assault, burning and destroying religious &amp; federal institutions don't want to watch their own work. But ya know...Peaceful protesters. Biden’s America.
Text TRUMP to 88022! I stand with
Biden has a 99.9 percent chance of winning! Cernovich said so!
Maybe with the boarders of DC. Here in the burbs I know Trump voters who are embarrassed and alarmed by him and see voting Biden; some are lifelong Republicans.
Biden is owned by China!!
But Biden wouldn’t pass it!!
I dont wanna get political or have an arguement. I just want to note that in the 1970s, Joe Biden fought for and supported segregation and wanted “these people” off the streets.   Not defending Trump, just throwing a fact out there
If you think Michael Brown was an innocent victim you’re a moron! Biden had 45 years in government to end all this so-called racism. Why didn’t he?
Obama thinks he can be the president again and Biden as his puppet.
When we insult Trump and conservatives bring up Biden or Clinton..we don’t like them either dumbass🙈
Fox News Poll: Biden tops Trump in battlegrounds Michigan, Minnesota, Pennsylvania
The new Biden look?
Did Obama just say that no Black guys are named John in that pathetic little sitdown with Biden? Somehow he thinks Jamal is a better name for a Black guy. 🤪
You forgot about Biden catching it.
Just saw the first Biden commercial during the Dodgers Giants game..Very powerful and gives Americans Hope
“but kayla you cant actually believe biden is as bad as trump” can’t i? i can. i do. who gives a shit anymore
Absolutely without a doubt voting for Biden. You're so blind, you cant see the damage trump has done &amp; is continuing to do. But be my guest, vote for him again. And if he wins again, it won't be legit,again &amp; you will live under a dictator instead of democracy.  I will pray for u
Biden vs. Trump
Thanks for your feedback.  I’m with Biden, just nervous that it’s beyond repair.
Hey Joe,  you know I am not a Trump supporter, but do you believe that Biden can fix this mess 45 put us in?  Do you think Biden will have the backbone?  Just a bit concerned.
The Right, violently attacking?  Are you high?   Show me the “Trumpers physically attacking Asians videos”.   Cause for each one you have, I have 1,000 of “Biden supporters attacking Americans”.
Now do Hunter Biden...
Jets and Biden two losing teams for 45 years!
I'm not a fan of Biden, but the Bernie train has left the station. So do you want 4 more years of Trump? I'm not going to ease up on anything he does just because he's a Democrat. We need to hold our elected officials accountable. But what are your real intentions with this?
#ChinaCommunistParty 🇨🇳 After  #CognitiveTest determined him #MadeInChina and #Senile 🔥 TRUE 🇨🇳  #NewJersey #Pennsylvania #NewYork
Good lord are you still going?? Pull the mask up a little higher, drown yourself in a little CO2 and relax. Nobody actually cares about your opinion. Sorry to break that to you. Have fun, vote for Biden’s VP and be gone.
There was no substantial civil unrest when Biden was VP.  We've seen it only under Trump.  On what basis do you predict it will happen in 2021?  Campaign rhetoric, that's all.
Biden drops and Bernie becomes NomineeSays the fkn nit wit who is all in on Biden... being humiliated is a way of life for these people
These are the people who think Biden is a socialist
New Jersey U.S. Senator Cory Booker hosts virtual campaign rally for Former Vice President Joe Biden.
Supercut Shows Fox Personalities Saying Trump Will Never Do Something. He Just Did.
Cosie is all in for Biden! And of course she purrs for Elizabeth! #WarrenforVP
If Biden runs with Kamala stfu, stop knit picking, and cast that fucking vote for them.  This is the best we're gonna get. Y'all  have chosen trash significant others over &amp; over again &amp; hit us with "no one is perfect". I don't wanna hear the bullshit from y'all anymore.
Biden's running mate announcement pushed back, likely will not come next week
Biden's running mate announcement pushed back, likely will not come next week
Biden needs someone energetic and tough!!! He should pick
it’s so disgusting what happening here. Biden needs to pick his VP NOW or he really needs to say something.
The Black women on Biden's team need to step up, NOW.    Biden needs to show leadership and rely on his better judgment, and the judgment of old white men who are intimidated by "ambitious" Black women.
Hopefully McConnell goes down with Trump.  He backed this mentally ill,incompetent narcissist instead of voting to inpeach him. I hope him and all his colleagues in the Senate get voted out of office for allowing this dictator to ruin our country. Vote Biden 2020!🇺🇸
Don’t believe the #CortesMyth that Biden is extreme. He listens to everyone, as he should and unlike #TrumpThreatensAmerica. The only person #Trump listens to are the ones only in his head. Gov’t needs to be inclusive, not exclusive and divisive like this autocratic prez
But Hunter Biden.........
Ridin’ with Biden as a single-issue TikTok voter
For 3 days straight  &amp;  have wondered why Biden’s quote re Trump holding the Bible remains on twitter while their post about Doctors erroneously claiming they have the cure for the coronavirus was taken down. I’m beginning to think they’re slow learners.
On second thought this could be worse than a Biden presidency. Precedents would be set in those 17 days which would do profound damage to our Republic
This year has shown the two party system is a disaster and the country is broken and if you think Biden and the Dems will fix it you are kidding yourselves. Dems don't want to fix anything because they need to run on fixing things every four years.
Any way to move up in Senate hierarchy without outright deposing Schumer?  Klobuchar is an effective legislator and would be outstanding in Senate leadership.  I agree Biden owes her big.
from the colossal galaxy brain of David Brooks, brilliant advice to Joe Biden: capitalism has failed, so embrace capitalism! make this the hill you die on, then keep dying, then everybody dies.  truly, a liberatory imagination here.
"coordinated hit job," absolutely unprecedented &amp; nothing like what you centrists spent several years doing to Bernie Sanders to ensure we'd wind up with the reactionary mediocrity of Joe Biden. nothing here is as ugly as your beloved Joy Reid's anti-Semitic body-language expert.
I think the  folks should use this song I wrote back in April as their official theme song.   It's called "I'll Fucking Joe Biden".   "This time I will vote for Joe Biden Though I am likely to gag And projectile vomit all over The American flag"
The attack on Biden was a necessary wake up call for him.  He should be thanking her, not expecting her to apologize.  Her prosecutorial record is strong.  Most people like prosecutors who helped lock up killers and rapists.
This leftward pivot is amazon, how will Biden recover
Chip in to elect Joe Biden and other Democrats on the ballot
In His Eulogy for John Lewis, Barack Obama Changed the Landscape of a Joe Biden Presidency  via
Bernie was my 1st choice.   I agree with many of your positions.   But, How important is it that Biden beats Trump?
Good to see he's not just mailing it in now that he's a lame duck.
Sounds exactly like potus at a presser.
Amazing how the Trump cult believes in the invincibility of Trump when his 2016 win was the fluke of the century and he’s the most consistently reviled president in the history of modern polling.
You like your own comments often?
Is this disturbing information accurate?
That’s you. Right? You’re explaining yourself right? Because I believe all the Clinton stuff no problem but you believe every girl except the ones against trump. Why is that?
Okayy so we’re getting somewhere... you’re delusional
Did I reply to you? No I refuse to talk to annoying adult children
Since it’s the Electoral College who decides...There are solidly Biden States and solidly Trump States at this point, right? Perhaps we should have extra, extra diligent oversight to ensure no fraud, suppression or meddling in the 10-12 or so swing states?
And uhm sir, you’re still defending a rapist right this very minute. So let’s turn this conversation to what’s wrong with you personally to support a child rapist? Are you okayy?
Republicans project so much like how are democrats hypocrites when we HAVE BEEN CALLING TO ARREST ALL THESE PEOPLE. We all just found out &amp; we want all of them arrested. But why can’t republicans say arrest trump too when he is clearly one of the most involved?
Suck?  What is this? Fifth grade? Biden isn’t perfect by a long shot, but Trump has turned our country into a shit show and he’s got to go.
Can’t wait for Biden to look at a statue funny and have trump start a civil war and nuke the northeast to own the libs then win 487-0
While most would like Kamala Harris as Biden’s VP. Susan Rice is a better choice. Harris is more suited for the Supreme Court. In my opinion.
She is not far to left.  She is a neoliberal. She was against Bernie Sanders. She likes Joe Biden not left at all. Just neoliberal
Let’s resurrect Hunter Biden, lock him up, fake news and what abt Benghazi?!
Am I to assume anyone who supports Biden is a pehdofile?......
So you said that there will be voter fraud with this year’s election if Biden wins so I’m curious, would you still think it’s fraud if you win🤔🤔🤔
You definitely want Biden to win. In the old days you would be tarred and feathered
Pos never loved our country.a biden presidency is an extension of transforming America which was only to kick down the columns of law that lifted us up for 2 hundred + yrs. Designed to Ensure that americans are victims of policies they've enacted. THINK! Whose benefiting? Not us!
I am not a fan of Trump but he'll have to do until someone better comes along and Joe "im a potato, wheres my car dude, head" Biden isnt it.
I know that settle for Biden site isn't like an official site but it's still some of the most depraved shit I've ever seen
i know. but biden's selected people are war hawks and they hate russia.   china has (in my estimate) 1000+ spies in US companies. no one seems to care about that!
if Biden wins -   they plan to take back Crimea and Donbass region  need the metals to secure bolshevik influence in the area
Voting for biden for the sole reason that he’s not Trump
They are delusional.  They wish their candidate was “moral” I guess they missed the 4 decades of Biden’s racist remarks. He was against desegregation.  And he is a huge pervert.  One of those touchy, feely dirty old men. Also he is pandering to terrorist organizations.
You must because because you will never hear anything coherent out of Biden’s mouth.  It is really very sad, obvious and embarrassing.
khive is so toxic on here.  i would have probably voted for biden if it weren’t for them.   i guess i’ll just write in hillary this year.
Unfortunately that ship has sailed. But Biden next best thing!!! Maybe a Supreme Court position in his future tho!
Joe Biden Disses Kanye West + Donald Trump: "You Won't Have To Worry About My Tweets When I'm President"
Most of this speculation is a nonsense. You underestimate the crowds marching in every City. And not 100% Republicans are idiots, many of them will vote. There is nothing in voting laws about minimum voters, or which result looks suspicious. Biden/Trump 82/15 it's fine with me.
I would walk, barefoot, over glass to vote for Biden.
fight like biden is still coherent
Nunes getting dirt on Biden from a pro-Russian Ukrainian.   Sounds extremely disturbing.   Is anyone going to investigate Trump sycophant Nunes?  Or does the creep get a free pass?
In April, Joe Biden predicted Trump would try and delay election.  You better hide in your bunker.
Love party unity! Love all the concessions team Biden is making!
I voted for him twice but now that I know how duplicitous he is I have serious doubts. MSM, FBI, etc were all in on it and I’m a disgusted Dem. I don’t like Trump but Biden is out of it. Should I just not vote?
wants to do a zoom comedy benefit for Joe Biden! Who'd go? Who'd like to perform? Feel free to share! I'd go.
Joe Biden is going to win BIG
That's only true if you're Joe Biden and the Democrats
I have seen this before from a lot of people who say it isn’t going to Biden and honestly when he says this they react like oh voter suppression so by this point idc haha plus every counties politics are messy
Biden can’t change his own diaper. He gets his Chinese friends to help him.
there’s no way Biden is going two terms. he should absolutely pick someone young who’s going to run for president in 2024. remember when VP’s ran for president and weren’t just... there? odd how Gore was the last one
If Biden wins there will be lines at the gyms and tanning solons. The next day. Like magic.
wants to do a zoom comedy benefit for Joe Biden? Who'd go? Who'd like to perform? Feel free to share! I'd go.
How Hunter Biden isn’t in federal prison yet is beyond belief.....BUT he will be one day for sure 100%
I’ll be proud to vote for or whomever Biden picks.
If Biden wins, then in four years he will run as the incumbent against whatever shitstain candidate the GOP digs out of its garbage pile. So we’ll have at least another four years to wait. 😕
Can’t wait for Biden to choke on a grape and have trump respond by deepthroating a watermelon then watch him be crowned king of the milky way
Not only can liberals not imagine a much better world. They can't imagine a much worse world. Even if they succeed at electing Biden, Trump can escalate far right terrorism just by claiming the election was rigged. Libs won't prep for that bc they can't imagine it's possible.
LMAO. Joe Biden has 247 people watching his broadcast today.   The polls are GARBAGE.
They're delusional..Biden since 😏 apologized AND walk the walk AND talk..unlike some people, I don't take responsibility for Jack 🌏🇺🇸
Who's surprised at the "delay the election" bullshit?  He's getting desperate.  It's getting close and he knows he's failing miserably.  We should all ignore him as much as possible - he thrives on attention.  Make sure you're registered, make sure you vote Biden 11/3/20.
Joe Biden should pick whoever he feels most comfortable with. The person that feels like a trusted partner, to him &amp; American people.
Isn't fair it to say that Biden is a step in the right direction?  Since option #2 is a psychotic criminal, the bar is pretty low.  I agree with all of your positions.   Are you suggesting that there is an option # 3?
No he wont, Biden cant even put together a coherent sentence let alone run a country, why didnt he fix it all 12 years ago with Obama?
“I had about 95,000 positive retweets on that” -  🙃🙃🙃
Not one word about John Lewis?? Biden did just fine!! No word your boy wants to change the Election Day?? What hold does he have over you! You get lower by the hour! Pathetic!!
The media is so dumb they just guaranteed Biden can’t delay the election. Ha ha ha
Isn’t the deranged orange orangutan not taking it seriously enough for people? If Biden wins we’ll all be wearing full hazmat suits.
Why don't you highlight everything good that he has done. And everything that Biden failed to do with over 45 years working for the government which is significantly more than Trump.
Lol. Good analogy. Perhaps Trump is like King Joffrey. And Biden represents the hope and promise of Rob Stark.
You should of never backed Biden. The DNC should of realized they made a mistake
i used to love bernie until he told me to support the warlord pedophile Joe Biden
only if biden puts a white male on the ticket   then i think we are done
If Biden wins it’s rigged and he will destroy the country before January or just refuse to leave office, but if he wins it was a fantastic, fair election because he stopped corruption
I agree, but it really angers me that we have to win by a large margin.  If Joe Biden wins by 1 vote or 200 votes, it should still be a win.
also, #45 is pissed  is whooping his orange butt in the polls! if the election were today, Biden would be our next President! #VoteJoeBidenToSaveAmerica
Biden's Lies for Black (and White-Privilege Guilt) Votes
This incompetent mentally ill dictator has to be kidding.  If this ever happens I think there will definitely be rioting in the streets . He has brought our country to its knees, Alienated all our allies &amp; has made our country the laughing stock of the world.  Vote Biden 2020.
and Biden's gonna turn over world power to China!  Well Hunter already got paid by them so he doesn't care!
Texans are getting the memo on Trump’s failure. Texas is very much in play for Biden.
Biden policies are bad for any industry. Period If you disagree live the policies. Strip your life of every offending action. Heating  coolin refrigeration travel meds. Buy yourself a horse dig a well and throw away your Iphone. Giddyup! Practice what u preach $ where mouth is
The reason they think you are being compensated is because in some way all the Biden pundits are being paid. Why else would any thinking human being support a man in such decline.
US coronavirus: Pompeo to face Senate as new economic figures show Covid-19 impact – live updates
Good morning mr.joe these Republicans have no commonsense of wearing a mask plus trump is sort of a terrorist he doesn't care about the 150,000 and counting people who have died from this virus he's nothing more than a sorry soul.Biden for president 🇺🇸🙏🏻👍
So to be perfectly clear, Joe Biden is quoted saying the following about Trump’s despicable act of brute force against peaceful protestors and Breitbart deems it necessary to fact check only that the Bible was right side up? Got it.
To anyone who understands the threat that is Donald Trump: We have to hold it together for 97 days. Do not buy into any bs or division, stay united in this one goal. When we elect Biden we will make history for this united front; a bipartisan effort to secure the democracy.

I've got mixed feelings about Harris, but Joe Biden's allies sound like racist, sexist assholes.
Settle for Biden 2020!
In the West Wing, there is one phrase that stops discussion cold "The President says" Biden worked closely with her for 8 yrs, and trusts her judgment and knows if she could do it This is a "The President says" moment, and he isn't going to listen to what some hack adjunct thinks
Yeah, but restoring the US’s credibility in the world stage is pretty much Biden’s wheelhouse, isn’t it?
Biden abused his power with his son n Obama abused his power spying on president trump
Introducing #RunningMate for #Dementia #Biden 2020........Break Up Those Damn Banks! #LMAO!
President Biden will have his hands full to rescind all your vicious treatments of poor families and minorities. We will remember what kind of POS you were.
if there are 2.3 million rental evictions in August Biden loses in a landslide. his base will be displaced.   any deals for the fed to take people's rent on their balance sheets should include   1) the wall 2) remove birthright citizenship 3) bring troops home
interesting fact: if all those evictions happen Biden loses by 100+ EV  almost every Trump voter is a home owner. so...  banks cant get anyone out by nov. it takes a year or more in most states :)
Biden allies move to stop Kamala Harris from becoming vice president
I think I actually respect this viewpoint more than the typical Vote For Biden pitch I hear.
So you’re saying Biden will be his BFF?
Bozo the Clown lies 50 times every day and the Democrats are supposed to be worried over this? Benghazi are you kidding me? When Russia is paying bounties for killing U.S. Soldiers and no one cares?
With all these predictions on what Biden will do as president, it sounds kind of like you know he’s gonna win. Thank god.
Biden to announce his VP candidate next week, per ABC.
Also, Obama (reportedly) specifically liked Biden in part because he wasn’t going to run for president afterwards.
Just throwing away your vote on a fool who made a deal with Trump to get as many people to vote for Kanye so joe Biden can lose lol. A vote for Kanye is a vote for trump
A lil late here LMFAO but yes Kanye is inadvertently trying to sway the votes to him so Biden doesn’t win. We all know Kanye was/still is associated with trump. So now we have basically 2 trumps on the stand, both of which 1/2
What else is a VP supposed to do besides break a tie in the senate? Biden is 74, this is practical
Most of us are appalled by this repugnant tweet, but there are plenty of suburbanites who this will resonate with, even tho they’ll never say it out loud. And that is why, no matter what, we have to vote in record numbers to save this country and vote Biden.
Really😔sad Kanye West should be working on himself&amp;his beautiful❤family.*Wouldnt put it pass Bunker Putin puppet Trump making a backroom deal with K.W.🤔K.W.probably trying 2 take votes from Joe Biden.*Hopefully Biden is way ahead of unfit in the votes.
Biden believes in SCIENCE, will be surrounded by fit, "qualified" people AND NOT friends, kin folks, cohorts he owes. Biden will NOT divide but unite AND * drumroll .. Biden's NOT CERTIFIABLE
Sir...I have just reviewed AG Barr's testimoney to  on several occasions. If you select  as your running mate and you are successful there will be no fooling around allowed with  I vote for Biden and
Biden has never said Defend the Police. Stop lying
They really think they'll be able to shame us into voting for Biden 😂  If Biden and the DNC wants me, they know where to find me. To their left.
Biden's been spotting reading "White Fragility" and "How to Be an Anti-Racist"...
You tell 'em , girl!!  BIDEN FOR PRESIDENT
Particularly, the fact that  wasn’t able to give a definite yes or no answer when asked if they could promise to not favor and attempt to get joe Biden elected is incredibly concerning.
Yesterday you made the unusual point of stating that altered images of a Jewish and a Black candidate were not anti Semitic and racist, respectively. Here your site colored the skin tone of Biden to look uncharacteristically orange. Is that also by design to emphasize your point?
Listen I could never truly understand the trials that African Americans go through in this country on a daily basis. Police brutality, force poverty, blunt racism. But not voting for Joe Biden who I'm not crazy about either will only help Trump. Who is the enemy
This election seals it to me that the Dems and Republicans work together more than they let on. The BEST they have to offer against who they claim is the worst president ever is sleepy Joe? It don't add up. If they truly wanted a win, Joe Biden was their worst shot.
The more I hear from Biden the more I like  .
I honestly don’t think Biden could do it and after he failed he would still get 90% of the black vote
He looks like the evil half of Joe Biden that escaped before the dementia kicked in
Who are all of these split ticket voters who want Biden to be president but want a GOP Senate?
Crazy that so many comments say exactly what the Democrats have been saying for years...the alternative is worse. That's not the point...when are we going to be voting FOR a candidate and not against the other one. Of course I'm voting for Biden. It still doesn't mean Iike him.
As we still mourn the deaths of 4 Americans who were under attack that Obama Biden and you allowed to happen while you all went to sleep while they called all of you repeatedly for help didn't have to happen! Leadership matters November?  had 4 plus decades in DC #Failed
This was never trumps to lose.. everyone knows trump inherited The Obama/Biden economy. Trump and the republicans are full of shit, all or them.Trump has lost his economic edge over Biden
Everything your family touches dies.  Let Jill Biden do it. We know you really don’t care anyway.
Biden has destroyed all the progress you made in maintaining political relevance.
This is laughable. Biden is a true moderate.The only extremist running is #TrumpIsACrybaby who supported the crazy woman claiming hydroxychloraquine &amp; no masks are the cure to the virus. Oh, and she believes in alien DNA as medicine and other insane ideas.
doing my part. more people saw mob violence in the right districts in swing states this week that saw joe biden ads :)
Looks like you’ll drop your pants for Putin on any given day, so I’ll take Biden over you in a heartbeat.   #Biden2020
We can only pray that Harris is at the top of Biden's VP list. America will reject this despicable race hustling anti-American clown. Dems are so out of touch they think people will love this choice...I do!!
He puts your father to shame. Vote Biden!!
Biden praised Harvey Weinstein... Round and round we go.
if Biden wins, his left wing US Atty's will move to dismiss ALL these cases, including the 2 lawyers in NYC who burned police cars
Biden saying “crimate clisis” is as cringe pandering as when the Dem candidates spoke Spanish
the top count for throwing an improvised explosive at a federal court house should be use of a weapon of mass destruction. but no one on the left will ever face serious charges.  in fact, if biden wins ALL these cases will get dropped by leftists DA's
Not sure what polls you were looking at, but Biden has routinely been even or favored vs Trump well before he was the last Dem standing. Of course his numbers got better the less candidates there were (which is obvious).
If your a ally against anti black racism then stop reducing it to a left vs right Trump or Biden thing. Parties don’t matter, both are honestly equally as racist just the left gives itself more plausible deniability. Is that what you want to do make racism more subtle?
Yes!! You can’t ask him “why did you suggest taking disinfectants for COVID?” or “Why did you retweet a video that says masks don’t work”. You can only ask President Shit for Brains, these type of questions. It’s nice not to be stupid, that’s why Biden gets applause. He’s smart!
I find all of these tweets about Biden's supposed demential to be hilarious. Anyone listening to the press conference today has no doubt that he is astute and well versed on the subjects asked.
Donald Trump vs. Democracy - The Bulwark. Arizona, Florida, Michigan, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin all narrowly favored Trump in 2016; recent polls show him trailing Joe Biden in all six.
During a campaign event today, Joe Biden held notes with Kamala Harris’ name scrawled across the top, followed by five talking points:  – “Do not hold grudges” – “Campaigned with me &amp; Jill” – “Talented” – “Great help to campaign” – “Great respect for her”

The Black women on Biden's team need to step up, NOW.    Biden needs to show leadership and rely on his better judgment, and the judgment of old white men who are intimidated by "ambitious" Black women.
Don’t believe the #CortesMyth that Biden is extreme. He listens to everyone, as he should and unlike #TrumpThreatensAmerica. The only person #Trump listens to are the ones only in his head. Gov’t needs to be inclusive, not exclusive and divisive like this autocratic prez
Yeah because Biden would have made everyone hide like him in their basements.
But Hunter Biden.........
For 3 days straight  &amp;  have wondered why Biden’s quote re Trump holding the Bible remains on twitter while their post about Doctors erroneously claiming they have the cure for the coronavirus was taken down. I’m beginning to think they’re slow learners.
Sanders, you may be able to pull the wool over Biden’s eyes but not the DNC. They got your number, you socialist politician.
Based Obama/Biden
This year has shown the two party system is a disaster and the country is broken and if you think Biden and the Dems will fix it you are kidding yourselves. Dems don't want to fix anything because they need to run on fixing things every four years.
Sanders, the DNC took out all of your progressive ideology from the democrat platform. They put Biden right in the middle of the road. That’s what the DNC thinks of your platform, a total sham.
Sanders, I wouldn’t count my chickens before they hatch. The polls show Biden with a lead but this race is far from being over.
Everyone trying to figure out who is Joe Biden running mate. Listen it can be a female dog and all a dog can do is say woof woof I'm still voting for #team Biden

Really? You think trying to connect Biden to China will make Biden look bad compared to Trump? 150,000 Americans are dead from Trump’s inaction. It no longer matters where the virus started. What matters now is Trump’s lack of response to protect Americans.
Sure. Americans are angry with Biden for how he’s worked with China in the past...But we’re fine with the absolute shitshow that is Trump.
Amazing how the Trump cult believes in the invincibility of Trump when his 2016 win was the fluke of the century and he’s the most consistently reviled president in the history of modern polling.
. says  wouldn’t reduce rioting and crime because he’s controlled by left-wing puppet masters. Unlike    understands that police officers play a vital role in keeping the peace and fighting crime.
Since it’s the Electoral College who decides...There are solidly Biden States and solidly Trump States at this point, right? Perhaps we should have extra, extra diligent oversight to ensure no fraud, suppression or meddling in the 10-12 or so swing states?
Suck?  What is this? Fifth grade? Biden isn’t perfect by a long shot, but Trump has turned our country into a shit show and he’s got to go.
Can’t wait for Biden to look at a statue funny and have trump start a civil war and nuke the northeast to own the libs then win 487-0

They are delusional.  They wish their candidate was “moral” I guess they missed the 4 decades of Biden’s racist remarks. He was against desegregation.  And he is a huge pervert.  One of those touchy, feely dirty old men. Also he is pandering to terrorist organizations.
You must because because you will never hear anything coherent out of Biden’s mouth.  It is really very sad, obvious and embarrassing.

Why Electing Joe Biden Will Make The Culture War Even Worse
The more damage he does, the more he puts his family at risk. Once the electoral college certifies Biden as the next POTUS, Drumof will try to burn every document regarding his time in the WH but Biden will have his A-Team in place to thwart that process.
One thing I noticed about the Biden campaign is on Facebook they keep showing polls that have losing, which is brilliant  Take nothing for granted... stomp Trump and the GOP into the ground
I might be wrong about this, but if and when Biden clearly has 270+ EVs after vote-counts with no valid disputes, won't Republican leaders like McConnell give public statements acknowledging that Biden is the President-Elect, and they look forward to working with him or whatnot?

Can’t wait for Biden to choke on a grape and have trump respond by deepthroating a watermelon then watch him be crowned king of the milky way
Even in his Bunker Trump is behind Biden by at least 10 points.
would like to hear an updated opinion regarding this article:
Not only can liberals not imagine a much better world. They can't imagine a much worse world. Even if they succeed at electing Biden, Trump can escalate far right terrorism just by claiming the election was rigged. Libs won't prep for that bc they can't imagine it's possible.
LMAO. Joe Biden has 247 people watching his broadcast today.   The polls are GARBAGE.
Joe Biden should pick whoever he feels most comfortable with. The person that feels like a trusted partner, to him &amp; American people.
Biden Catches A Break After Notre Dame WITHDRAWS from Hosting Presidential Debates

Indeed.   And why does Biden?   If the question were, Why does Sanders, I think there's actually a good answer!
just sold krat and waed to joe biden lol
I'm not a fan of either candidate. If Biden took a simple physical to show that he's okay ( mind and body), he would get so many votes. I swear, it would convince me that he's able to take office. That's a demanding job. I don't think that's asking for much
Not one word about John Lewis?? Biden did just fine!! No word your boy wants to change the Election Day?? What hold does he have over you! You get lower by the hour! Pathetic!!
It’s really time the government steps in and stops you posting these Chinese slogans. The Chinese want Biden to win the election because they can’t push around or buy Trump.
Sanders, your really confident of the outcome of the election. With CORRUPT Biden as your nominee, I wouldn’t start opening the champagne just yet.
I don’t think Americans want a change of leadership in the WH at this time. Too much going on. Biden doesn’t know he’s alive. So there’s a lot of value betting Trump.
Nadler, you liberal democrats have a way to twist the truth to further their own agenda. You have CORRUPT Biden as your nominee he may win the election and maybe he will lose. Stop spreading lies to help Biden with the election.
Obama and Biden fixed America from a fixer-upper to handing Trump a GREAT COUNTRY. He destroyed it singlehandedly. Now, hurry up and leave.

The best I've been able to do with this uncomfortable conundrum is, figure I'd vote for Biden if I were in a swing state (I'm not), and be deeply grateful for those in swing states who refuse to do so. Someone needs to have the nerve to hang in for a less corrupt future.
So to be perfectly clear, Joe Biden is quoted saying the following about Trump’s despicable act of brute force against peaceful protestors and Breitbart deems it necessary to fact check only that the Bible was right side up? Got it.
To anyone who understands the threat that is Donald Trump: We have to hold it together for 97 days. Do not buy into any bs or division, stay united in this one goal. When we elect Biden we will make history for this united front; a bipartisan effort to secure the democracy.

Kimberly is a Biden supporter! Haha!
Every time Biden speaks, the President has a press conference. Always trying to win the news cycle.
That's perfectly fine. But I think you're witnessing a President that has no sense of decorum and definitely doesn't abide by normal presidential standards. If Biden is indeed elected, I expect he will be faced with challenging questions like any president that preceded him.
Then you have just answered your own questions regarding any perceived difference. You yourself have said Trump is an "idiot". It's my contention (and maybe yours) that Biden is not. Do you treat an idiot the same way you treat a thoughtful, introspective person? I know I don't.
Let's try this a different way. Do you agree the method in which Trump conducts a press conference is different than Biden (or virtually any other elected official)? Do you agree that Trump has been subject to numerous misinformation claims when conducting interviews?
Biden and Warren have a virtual fundraiser Friday night. Many Warren peeps thought this was going to be a VP announcement. I wish.

A certain man is thinking 💭 good good thoughts about a truly truly  good good man: Joe  Biden.                         Go Joseph Go, Go Joseph Go               I said Go Joseph, Go Joseph,                Go Joseph Go!!!
yeah Biden doesn't have a prayer in any of those either due to Covid. not moving the needle at all as long as hes locked up in his basement.
is predicting a Biden win and Gloom &amp; Doom for America
can’t wait for Biden to mispronounce America as “americer” and then have trump hold a dictionary upsidedown in front of a flag and win 538-0
Liberals if Biden picks a non POC/female VP candidate: “Classic Dems, another old white man, no diversity, smh not progressive 😤”  Liberals when Biden does pick a POC/female VP candidate: “ugh not THIS one classic Dems just pandering not sincere she’s a bird smh 😤”
And yet Bolton won't vote Biden when faced with "not my guy" or what he sees as a threat to democracy.

2/ And the differences grow when you add more facts: the $1.5B was an investment placed with a firm that Biden owned 10% of.    Do I think it was smart for Hunter to do business like this? Absolutely not. But let’s be honest about what happened, and not claim he was given $1.5B.

Trump says he won’t go and pay respects to John Lewis at Capitol  - WOW! How low can Trump descend?
Biden doesn’t have to compete for such a low bar. It is not noteworthy to know the difference between a camel and a rhino or to remember 5 words. Sad that #TraitorTrump thinks this is something to brag about and let’s not try to figure out why he had lto take this test.
Please explain how we’d be better off under Biden
Great argument. Yea let’s let Biden win, that’ll work out well for us and our children.

GOP supports red flag laws, Merit-based  immigration is a direct attack on White collar Americans, and Trump is already open to DACA amnesty. The GOP is worse than useless. I'm not voting Biden, I'm just not voting.

I disagree with anyone voting for Trump in 2016, but I will welcome them to the Biden camp with open arms. They made a mistake, help us fix it.
Something else Trump will try to win: Secondly, he wrote, A Barr and the DOJ could announce details of a possible corruption case against Joe Biden that could lead to nowhere in an attempt to smear Biden, even more than the president has with accusations of corruption.

No Mr president if you win it means it was rigged you just see which way this election is going Joe Biden is ahead slaughtering you the only way you can win right now Joe bidden dropped out of the race
New on    As Trump and Biden battle, election officials are running out of time, money for November
I think Biden’s VP will actually be Kamala Harris.
You know a campaign is desperate when they are doctoring videos of Biden to make him look old, tired, and feeble. Thankfully Biden's campaign doesn't have to doctor anything.
You guys made fun of Trump for having 6,000 at a rally. Show me a Biden rally with 6,000 please
I think Biden will flip Ohio. Pretty good chart overall. 👍🍻 #VoteBlue2020
it is so sad that these people are trying to say they are wearing the swastika to warn our country what will happen if Biden is elected. I wish ignorant idiots would not try to represent Trump in any way. Are they nazi’s or just incredibly dumb?
Wasn’t Obama supposed to bring Sharia law if he got elected when everyone was angry at Muslims? Now China is the bad guy and if Biden is elected, China takes over the world.
Umm  , you think Biden is going to send kids back to school? Trunp is doing that, not sleepy joe.
And why is Biden so crucial to their plan?

Please, show me where Hunter Biden was given $1.5B.
Does W have that kind of pull in Texas? I mean, I'm sure he's liked, but is he liked for more than being a good Texas Republican? He'll need to be, because some folks aren't going to see him as such a good Republican once he endorses Biden.

Watch for the same message regarding debates with Biden.
Harris, Biden can’t put two sentences together, so tell me how he could be President. He couldn’t shine Trump’s shoes. I know your auditioning for the VP slot but you have a lot to learn about Joe Biden. He’s been one of the most corrupt politician in history.
Mark Kelly's lead over McSally has been consistent for over a month and it portends to an ugly outcome for her. Biden is looking solid in Arizona and I think it will be tough for Drumpf to win it in November. #VoteBlue2020
1/ And today, Trump continued to push the lie that his campaign was spied on.   Who among us hasn’t had the occasional slip of the tongue? Go ahead, ask Biden if Arizona is a state or a city. If he says “city,” I’ll vote for Trump right now.  Then, ask Trump what he’s done...
948 registered voters was a small number to poll. The polls today are a bit more advanced with a better understanding of where races lean towards. Biden's numbers have been steady so far but I do not for a second take them for granted. We have to vote on November 3rd. #Truth
TBH, if I were Biden, I wouldn’t anything.  Trump is a walking-talking Biden endorsement.

Who do you think is  likely choice for VP at this point? Oddsmakers rank them Harris, Rice and Duckworth and Bass tied for third. My money is on Rice.  #BidenVP #KamalaHarris #susanrice #KarenBass #TammyDuckworth
I have tweeted awhile ago that Michigan and Pennsylvania will go to Biden and that Wisconsin is a toss up (if voter suppression occurs). Florida and Arizona looks to be states that Biden can pick off. It will be close there. #StayVigilantAmerica #VoteBlue2020
And one who answers reporters’s questions and gets out of their basement ! Biden is a yellow coward 😡😡😡😡
He can't hijack the electoral college as the SCOTUS ruled recently that states can enforce an elector's pledge to support their party's nominee and the state voters' choice for POTUS. Basically, if the state goes to Biden, it goes to Biden. #Truth
Joe Biden won't answer any questions from reporters and when he does they have to submitted for preapproval. 40% of voters believe he has early onset of dementia.
Only if Biden supporters all get out and vote. Otherwise, 2016 all over again and there is no place to run to since #TrumpIsACompleteFailure botched things so badly that no other country wants us.
Unless Biden's vetting team found something extremely damaging to her credibility that will hurt the campaign, she is the the top choice to be on the ticket. All the other choices are immensly qualified to be VP as well but Senator Harris is at the top for me. #VoteBlue2020
Wouldn't matter to Drumpf. My hunch is that they will contest the validity of the results to the SCOTUS to have Biden's victory tossed. If that actually happens, it will be a pitchfork moment across the country demanding Drumpf's removal. Scary times lie ahead for the nation.
Drumpf knows that once the electoral college awards Biden the presidency, it's all over for him, his family and dozens of other administrative/cabinet officials. Pardons will be given and Drumpf might resign w/a pardon in hand and flee the country to avoid prosecution.
Biden pretty much guarantees a Tucker Carlson or similar presidency immediately after, and the one benefit of Trump's fascism is he's too stupid and lazy to apply it well. Better people spend the next 4 years resisting a fascist-wannabe than get comfy before a true fascist.
The only scenario where I vote Biden is if I somehow had a psychic intuition that Biden winning would prevent a US/China war. Hell, I would phone-bank for him if it meant stopping that war. But his inability to atone for Iraq and racist China ad are proof he's not safe either.
Yes, that Joe Biden, what a ‘Covfefe’ mess! Sounds like a guy who’d drink disinfectant to ‘zap’ a virus, or someone who’d try to nuke a hurricane, or one who’d continue mining coal because he thinks windmills cause cancer 🙄. Wait that’s not #JoeBiden2020, it’s #ClownPotus 🤡

Crazy Town with Joe Biden. Relax and enjoy the show.
Biden is probably a bit more ahead (possibly 5 to 7) but a 3 point lead is still going to be a tough hill for Drumpf to climb. Biden knows Pennsylvania better than Drumpf. #StayVigilantAmerica
4/ (look at what happened with AOC).  But, whether you like it or not, your choice in this moment is Trump or Biden. And if you’re really committed to progress on the ISSUES you’ve listed, and not just the narrow solutions you’ve identified, your  choice is clear: Biden.
1/ OK, so you’ve got a platform. Can you please explain your strategy for achieving ANY of your goals? Because only one of the two candidates who can win is inclined to support any of those. Biden is clearly a better choice than Trump with regard to health care, education and...
