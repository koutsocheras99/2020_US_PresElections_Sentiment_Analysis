Joe Biden Reveals What Will Become of Border Wall If He Wins
Once AGAIN Biden comes across as an idiot
Well Obama and Biden were in there for eight years and they cut the military worse than anyone in history they didn’t deserve to be in office
You don’t have to like Trump and you don’t have to vote for Trump but there is no way you vote for Biden and and say that you want what’s best for the country
Deeper than that it's a clear and deliberate attempt on behalf of GOP to use Ye to deter votes from Biden, securing a higher percentage for Trump.   Either he's in on it or they're using his mental instability for their political chess game. Both are wrong.
put this guy back in the basement until the election please
Why Joe Biden May Be Exactly What The Country Needs Right Now | Deadline...  via
Trump says Joe Biden has the power to “hurt God.”  Only a damn fool would vote against a man with that kind of power!!!
Biden will hurt God and the bible, lol.
The Only Cognitive Test Biden Needs to Take: Debate Trump
That is good and hoping to see all states are like Ohio. I believe they will be like Ohio.i don't hear anything substantial came out of Biden's mouth or written except for the million jobs he will outsource. No American will vote for that.
WCE are never going to vote for Biden, or any other progressive. It's true that Trump is making a (clumsy and inarticulate) bid for their support -- which he already has.   So really all his pandering is nothing but attempts to get more applause. Which is pathetic.
Yea the same one on a phone call with Biden on tape saying “He had no reason to believe he was corrupt but would fire him if it got him the money” Tape is out there.
So what Joe Biden is saying is that he understands the separation of powers &amp;  will honor his oath to the Constitution. #DonaldTrump has never read the Constitution and even if he tried he wouldn't comprehend it. POTUS should be loyal to America not Putin.
First we have to elect Biden. I have it on good authority that he plans to "hurt God."
I would pitch a tent &amp; camp out for days.  I am voting for Joe Biden on 11/3/2020 to Make America America Again.  💙🇺🇸💙 I am voting straight anti-Repugnantcan ⬆️ &amp; ⬇️ the ballot!
Nice ride #Biden..... #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica #RidinWithBiden2020
My friends all over the nation are voting for Trump and not Biden. I am confident Trump will be reelected.
It is a great way for the public to get to know you &amp; Biden. I think the exchange between you two will be a great way to help people to decide on whom to vote for.
Trump is the smartest I have seen in USA. He is a great communicator! Having problem with an interview? That is doubtful. If Trump could handle Hilary, Biden would be a piece of paper to crumple. I doubt your reasoning. Lot of lies circulating on internet.
Who is Biden's  running VP?
What is Obama gate anyway? Do you know about the pizza gate also? That period of time really demoralize the leaders in America. There were child sex trafficking going on as well and I am sure Biden know about it.
I don't want  a president that wants to outsource millions of Job's to other countries - that is Joe Biden.  He wants to repeat what he he and Obama during their term in USA and bankrupt the the country.
Not for long if we keep electing people like  joe biden  and those democrats senators

Can you imagine Joe Biden sitting down and carrying on a conversation with foreign leaders. My gosh, they would eat him for lunch! Wake up America, Joe Biden clearly does not have the mental facilities for the job of the Presidency
If he leaves under "normal" means (such as being voted out in Nov &amp; Biden being inaugurated in Jan), he will be legally entitled to have publicly funded Presidential library. I'm quite sure the Trump family will turn it into MAGA shrine &amp; bilk it for all they can
If  can’t go to a typical Presidential Debate with  then how can we expect him to hold up when more pressure is on to make decisions or talking to other world leaders in tough situations. Joe Biden would be a push over. #Trump2020Landslide #Trump2020
Joe Biden sure is popular with the voters. Biden is beating Trump at his game. Trump is on tv every day. Every time he gets on tv he lies, manipulates and bullies. At this point my dog could beat Trump. Little Boy for America. Dogs rights are human rights. #AreYouSmarterThanADpg
Joe Biden doesn't have to debate. Trump is handing him everything he needs. The more Trump talks &amp; rants the better it is for Biden.
Slow down there skippy.  Biden hasn’t even picked her yet.
Fuck Kanye, Trump, Biden, and Kim K! However keep yo ass outta Arkansas, we got enough problems dealing with Tom Cotton racist bitch ass!
How would Biden debate with a moron that can’t keep focus on a single subject for more than a minute or two? And the moron never cites real hard facts. Just makes things up.  Sounds like a world wide comedy about to happen.
I know why I don't like Biden, he is for abortion, killing of the unborn in the mother's womb. Biden is also interested in taking away millions of jobs away from America.
Does anyone think Joe Biden is actually going to debate Trump?    Going on record now ..... the Democrats will never let it happen.
Trump says jobs will disappear if Biden is elected. The good part is so will you.
Even with all this, I hope folks know that this will not stop white supremacists from voting for this guy! Sad part is Biden is no better. However when you vote for the lesser of two evils, you evil yo self! 🤷🏾‍♂️
I have voted Democrat nearly my entire life.  Chicago painters local 194.   I can’t do it this time. Biden is very slow and not up for challenges that lie ahead. Can’t wait for the debates! Trump 2020 .   Please unite us as a nation. If you do that ...you win

In my opinion, Joe Biden had a lot to do with the successful run for the Presidency by Obama. Joe was very popular among his colleagues from both parties  &amp; well known.

Hillary got 3 million more votes than Trump (and 90% of the black vote) and that was BEFORE Trump killed 150K+ and let unemployment skyrocket to double digits due to his incompetence. Biden has no worries about the black vote. Even southern boy Clinton got over 85% of the blacks.

Unfortunately, national polls are just indicators of how most Americans feel about Biden v. Trump. That's not how we elect a president, and Republicans are hoping against hope that they can, for the third time this century, win without actually having to persuade the most voters.
No Biden wants to debate. It’s his wife and radical left wing staff who are scared. The President has a fine line to walk. How badly can he beat Biden before people think he is a bully ,taking advantage of his pre dementia old man mind
Biden wants a debate. It’s his wife and left wing staff who are scared 😱 The problem Mr President is how you look after the debate. Did you beat him badly. Or did you beat him so bad it’ll make you look like a bully taking advantage of his old man weak mind
I guess I’m not a #LincolnVoter bc I cant vote for Biden. But as a Republican voter for 18 years, 2016 was the first time I didn’t vote for the Republican nominee. I for sure won’t be in 2020 either. As a Christian, Trump is the antithesis of everything I say I believe.

I just have some disdain, because in no way is his being there helping the moderate vote, whatever is left of it. There was such disdain for Obama, people will vote against Biden as a pseudo-FU to O. It’s irresponsible as fuck, but I’m afraid some don’t care enough.
Also, really annoyed at people who are excited to vote for Biden. Aside from ousting Trump, we’re settling - why are you excited?
The first debate is where Biden loses this election.
What is crazy... Their are those that want to shut everything down. They don't even want virtual debates. It's a win at all cost strategy. Joe Biden has dementia and Democrat don't want to put him out there.
You seem to blame Trump for everything, but you don't want debates and insult millions of people for their opposing viewpoints. Joe Biden is a racist, rapist, created bills that disproportionately incarcerated thousands of black men and he has dementia.

We can not allow people who lack basic judgement skills to “protect and serve”.  The Biden DOJ should prosecute every person who abuses their duty while wearing a badge.
Why should Joe Biden stoop to mud-wrestle in Donald Trump's pigsty?
Be careful what you wish for, Bud. Stalking around the debate stage behind Biden won't make Trump look as tough and manly, in the way Republicans admire, as stalking around behind a much shorter woman.
Of course, Biden will. He's a demented fool.

No matter how good or bad Trump may be in any interview, in the interview part of the competition it is clear he is already "dormie" in his match with Biden (for those of you who don't watch the Ryder Cup, that means Trump can only win or worst case tie at this point.)

Hilarious to imagine Kanye eviscerating Biden while Trump is off on the third podium going —&gt;
Also, throwing around the “radical” label when describing Biden is absolutely laughable when your candidate is Donald Trump and the electorate realizes that.
I can’t remember a time when the GOP didn’t have a coherent line of attack on the Dem presidential candidate. Nothing is sticking to Biden. Painting him as the “radical left” reeks of desperation.
I would like to add an important footnote. As of mid-June, 2020 Biden &amp; trump were in a statistical tie in Arkansas.

Not to get too political. But if the Democrats want a shot at winning in November, wouldn't you think Biden would choose Bernie as his running mate? Seems most folks I know on the left want Bernie over the rest of them anyways.   I'm going Libertarian on this one.

I think that is the strategy.  Dems will pull Biden at the eleventh hour and replace him with their hand-picked candidate which the citizens had no say so in.🤔
ask the right what's good about trump. All they say is SOSHUISUM, KOMUNISUM, MARKSISUM (and have NO clue what those actually mean).....no biden isn't the greatest candidate but he will do a lot better than trump. trump only cares about using the office to make money.
Then they should leave his campaign. Voice their concerns and wishes. Tell his “followers” they need to vote Biden. Courage and bravery over comfort.
Absolutely! No one wants to hear Trump go nutty well Biden tries to bring important points to the debate. It would be a waste of time we all know that Biden is the better choice!

Unfortunately, national polls are just indicators of how most Americans feel about Biden v. Trump. That's not how we elect a president, and Republicans are hoping against hope that they can, for the third time this century, win without actually having to persuade the most voters.
No Biden wants to debate. It’s his wife and radical left wing staff who are scared. The President has a fine line to walk. How badly can he beat Biden before people think he is a bully ,taking advantage of his pre dementia old man mind

If you remember, Biden was the only one to say NO.
We’ve already got one.  An illegitimate one.  And no matter how many times you say Biden has dementia, it doesn’t make it true.  Grow up.
Making the cabinet, and the Supreme Court look like America is what needs to happen, diversity encourages imagination. #BidenHarris2020 #Biden
Here’s a guy that actually knows where the money for Black Lives Matter goes. Hint: to an old white  dude named Joe Biden’s campaign for president
This is gross. Why can’t a black protect themselves but these goons can defend slavery monuments with rifles? #biden
Biden is a puppet. He has no idea what he is saying!
Everything will improve if Trump is re-elected. This country will be in the crapper if sham candidate lyin’ Joe Biden is elected.
In the homes in lockdown Biden is dominating
I've been saying on my radio show for months...Biden's handlers will never allow him to debate Trump. The great  said it here on Twitter recently. It will never happen.
Biden has been wrong on most foreign policy issues for the last 40 years.
The only person this sociopath is fighting for is himself. Hate to tell you but you're the one who's blind. His poll numbers are dropping like a stone because people are waking up. And I am no Joe Biden fan.
Joe Biden nears final decision on running mate
Joe Biden nears final decision on running mate  (from
All Biden has to do is show up and say nothing while Trump has a nuclear meltdown on live television.
Third poll shows close race, Biden 50%, Trump 46%, 53% think Trump will win
Joe Biden Taps Corrupt Ex-Senator (And Ted Kennedy Wingman) to Help Him Find a VP | National Review. ⁦ ⁦ needs to lose Chris Dodd. The message needs to be about the future, not a sordid past of corruption and misogamy.
DJT pretty good given he personally made our country in 3 years while fighting the Democrat-controlled House the entire time and after 8 years of Obama-Biden. Very smart and very driven. Here’s to 4 more years of DJT!!  #MAGA2020
, who cares who Biden  picks, he AN'T  gonna win!
Political strategy thoughts on the VP selections:   If I am Biden, he has to select from someone with more progressive credibility than he does for that part of the party.  Likely a woman as well.   If I am Trump, I think I get rid of Pence and go for new blood.
You halfwit. This 1. Has no connection to the actual Jow Biden 2. Is not intended for children 3. Is listed under politics and humor  #trumpfailedamerica #TrumpIsUnwell #trumpisfat #trumpisugly
Joe Biden nears final decision on running mate
I assume so. I guess Biden ripping off someone's lines 30+ years ago meets Democrats' standards the way Trump ripping off the desperate, running a sham charity, belittling POWs, paying off porn stars and ignoring a pandemic that has killed 150K Americans and counting meets yours.
Yes! As VP pick, she would destroy Biden’s chances!
Dodd and Rendell are not running the Biden campaign and Joe hasn’t gotten this far by listening to tired old white guys. Harris is the only candidate who’s the right age (55), has the right experience (DA,AG,Senator) and can argue any man into a puddle. Pick her  !
How about some relief aid??  Millions of citizens under your watch are going to be evicted because of your ineptitude.  They may not have homes but they will vote on November 3rd...for Joe Biden.
WHY ARE YOU BANNING TIK TOK IM VOTING FOR BIDEN NOW!!!!
The Dem Party is essentially two parties in one. The moderates (Obama, Biden, Hillary) and the farther left progressives (Sanders, Warren, AOC). Sensible Americans will find a place in between the two.
You said last time no one called to support Hillary. Is anyone supporting Biden for any reason than “he’s not Trump” ?  I never hear it.   #BoneFam
Hi guys.  If this pandemic didn’t happen Trump was winning in a HUGE landslide.  I still think he’s gonna win in Nov.   .I see Trump/Pence flags, signs &amp; banners all over the country. NEVER anything for Biden
You forgot all the queers and ancoms in Fayetteville who do mutual aid, housing defense, bail aid etc while everyone else puts up their Biden sign and calls it a day. Oh, and  and the countless folks organizing in the Latinx and Marshallese communities
We’re ridin with Biden!
WELL, WHAT GIVES YA’LL THE RIGHT TO CHOOSE FOR BIDEN? MAKING NASTY FUNKY LITTLE RACIST REMARKS ABOUT BIDEN BECAUSE HE WILL NOT CHOOSE YOUR PERSONAL PIC IS TOTALLY THROWING A WRECKING BALL INTO THE CAMPAIGN! I RECKON YA’LL WILL VOTE FOR TRUMP IF BIDEN DOESN’T PICK YOUR GIRL?
Ah, but it is. Harris doesn’t bring anything to a Biden ticket. Does take away.
Joe Biden is probably the one who offends the fewest, so his VP pick is where he can pick up voters who are more progressive than he is.
You're welcome!
Trump is nasty, he was a father of 3 children  talking about 12 yrs someone's daughter.
How pathetic of a hashbrown! 😂 What is Biden camps next "genius" hashbrown?  #SettleForSomeRights ?
I might have to pay more attention to  This compilation of Trumpservients dismissing Biden because they had such faith in their unquestioned leader's allegiance to law and Constitution is brilliant. Has a single one admitted that Biden was right?
Paris is 39 yrs old and  Ivanka is 38 yrs old. So creepy... his daughter was 11 yrs old then.
I swear to GOD, Biden better not f*ck this up. 😠
It is ELDERLY ABUSE!  has no boundaries of Evil to gain power,  Biden is ill, where is the Dr. that should be recommending this abuse and demanding medical treatment?
Well it makes sense. Like the Biden’s and Feinstein’s they want an opportunity at the trough and to be able to enrich themselves at the expense of average Americans.
Betcha don’t.   Biden Wins.               LAW &amp; ORDER
Where is your man Biden??
Please endorse Biden. Think of the future
Please don’t put all women in her class. I have never been against our POTUS and never will!! TRUMP 2020 .Biden is a joke!!!
And Biden?? Asthma kept him out, all that “running “ they have been showing of Biden, I sure hope he has his inhaler.
Hopefully..he was Democrats and I imagine Joe Biden was friends with guys like Bull Conor
MANY  TV talkers don't think it is a problem when Biden and Hillary says they need to plan for phony election... But they blame you for making warning of what the country might be force to have to endure.
Joe Biden will do whatever he’s told
The GOP must grow a set and stand up against this craziness.  This pathetic weak response to the left bullying is embarrasing. Joe  Biden is our named opponent.  He has never gotten more than 1% in a national election.  Why now?
Obama and Biden have done more for this country than your President could ever hope to do. Please take the blinders off and see trump for who and what he truly is, a Cole and corrupt man who doesn't care about anyone but himself.
The knuckleheads on TV would rather argue and go to court for weeks to determine who won the election, rather than allowing congress delay for a few weeks to either vote of take more time to vote. DEMOCRATS Biden and Hillary had already claimed that there will be fraud.
The spiciest take that I've seen is that Biden is actively trying to lose the election so he isn't left holding the bag.
I wonder if a black Biden supporter had been killed for supporting him by a black Trump supporter if the national media would have covered it? Oh you bet they would.  But make it the opposite and not a peep.  Media bias is sickening!
And u live where???  TX??Although Biden is actually beating Trump in every poll out there.  Even in FL. Even FOX NEWS polls have Trump trailing.  Trump is a failure and has not once tried to unite.  Only divide.
Fun fact: both Donald Trump (6/14/46) and Joe Biden (11/20/42) are older than former presidents George W. Bush (7/6/46) and Bill Clinton (8/19/46), who have been out of the oval office for almost 12 and 20 years, respectively.
And who started the war on drugs and mandatory sentencing? The Clintons, Biden, Pelosi, Warren, and the rest of the Democrats in 92. Who has been tearing it down for 3 1/2 years? That big bad orange man y’all love to hate.
Biden is going to be your president
I would not vote for Joe Biden if he were the last man on Earth.
Biden 2020!  Make the office respectable again!!
Him and Biden both.
I’m voting for Biden, because Trump is a Putin-loving, egomaniacal, cowardly, cretinous, dictator wanna-be who disputes science, because it doesn’t serve his self interest.
Who ever Joe Biden chooses as his VP, will absolutely be the best person imaginable.    Brilliant!  Whoever it is.  They are the best choice.    I will be devoted to that person.   AND I PRAY NO ONE SAYS ANYTHING DEROGATORY ABOUT THAT PERSON.  JUST HELP JOE AND HER WIN BIG.
Riiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiight?????   If Biden screws the pooch on this pick, there’s gonna be a lot of slow singin’ and flower bringin’ because, truth be told, I’m actually *expecting* Biden to f*ck this up. Because  ♥️ f*ckin’ up a sure thing.  #ProveMeWrong
Don't worry Germany, the troops will be back when Biden takes office.
nah see, that's Bernie's idea. Biden has a social distance from this policy...
I trust Joe Biden &amp; stand by his vp choice.  “Allies” need to shut it &amp; let the man do his work.  Not helping.
Maybe Biden can reverse it if it will take years....
She supported Obama/Biden who tore this country apart with race and identity politics. That is Oprah’s legacy. She needs to learn to live with it and accept when she passes that is how she will be remembered.
Agree. Biden will prepare his V.P. to be the next President. Given his age and experience, it’s ludicrous to believe that he will feel threatened by the strength of his running mate
Clinton’s and Biden’s have taken corruption and selling their offices to a new level.
98 days, right? Look for LOTS of information to come to light in the next 3 mo.#Biden2020 #Biden #Biden2020Landslide
Have to triage. I think Biden if in swing state. Then work to scare the bejeezus out of him when in power. With a third party that cooperates with progressive Dems.
I don’t think many people really expect biden to be any different, I think that a lot of people are going to vote for him since going nowhere is still better than going backwards
I wish I were joking.  The Democrats and Joe Biden have been practicing a more palatable brand of Fascism than the Republicans lately.Eh? Give Biden a few more days and a few more interviews. It will be a moot point.
Reagan was 69 when he took office. Biden would be 78...
What’s your point?  That wasn’t his statement.  Biden is not a good candidate.  It wasn’t about who is less likeable.  Trump is the better presidential candidate and it’s not really close.
Hating Trump doesn’t mean you have to vote for Biden. They’re both pieces of shit. Look into the independent candidates
Who’s going to vote for Trump ‘just because’ it’s not Biden?
Joe Biden doesn’t have polices. I’m confused.
A lifelong devout catholic Joe Biden is against the Bible and God and will stop at nothing to hurt them both. How? I don’t know, but it won’t be with guns or energy that’s for sure.
Is Biden gonna punch god? Is that what he’s saying?
I would say Biden has been to church more times in the last year than trump has in his entire life
Biden gets his support from Depends..😉👍
Probably the icing on the cake. This proves how far-left the Democrats have gone and why they MUST be stopped.  #Trump2020 #Trump2020NowMoreThanEver
Other leaders would chew Biden up and spit him out so easily.
If, as Joe Biden recently tweeted, 'No one should have to pay for coronavirus testing or treatment,' then why should anyone have to pay for chemotherapy? If we can afford trillions to combat COVID-19, we can afford free healthcare and a Green New Deal."
He figures if it looks, walks, sounds like a bomb then it is a bomb.  That was after 49 people told him so.  I just pulled the 49 out of my butt but you get the picture.  Biden on the other hand just called his son and the boy told him, Dad it looks like it could be a bomb.
I am not okay with anything in this regard.  Poor choice of BIden makes the whole thing unworthy of my support.
I'm smart enough to demand #Med4All before I give him my vote. Getting rid of Trump is not a good enough reason for me to vote Biden.
there is only ONE reason to vote for Biden. to get rid of Trump. if Biden was smart, he would be for #Med4All - the only reason I would vote for him.
“He” (Biden) isn’t choosing anyone.  The choice is being made FOR him and if anyone thinks otherwise, they haven’t been watching closely.
Vote him out even if Biden is not your candidate. Vote for your country not your party! Vote for your family, friends, and neighbors. Make your vote count this November!
Damn bro, crazy that you had all these reasons but not one of them was a reason to vote FOR Biden.
That's a big admission to the unviability of Biden. If he can't speak for himself, then he sure as hell can't speak for a Nation.
She should fit wright in with the democrats but it will be a challenge to tell who lies more her or biden.
He won’t debate Biden
Biden can't campaign, so here comes the great community liar to fill in for him. What Democrats won't do to protect their hold on a disenchanted base...
We could elect Biden's dog and you would still go to jail.
for me to vote for Biden, I want #Med4ALL at the very least. if he can't do that, I will not give him my vote. I would actually vote for crazy trump right now if he gave us Medicare for All.
Amen to that (not joe being old but having the right VP... one that can push the ultra progressives back).   Biden’s handlers are currently making 2 mistakes.. not announcing the VP and hiding him from all interviews.   Lots of ppl think this horse race is over.  It’s not.
In direct comparison, yes.  My concern with Biden is to what degree he lets the mega progressives drive the legislation.  Free college, loan debt relief, allowing non citizens to vote, reversing trade reform, etc will do more damage than another 4 years of Trump.  (IMHO)
Yep I see Biden jalopies all over the place...mostly at antique shows 😂😂😂😂
Biden only looks ok b/c you’re comparing him to Trump.  He’s not even remotely competent, which why his handlers won’t let him be interviewed.  Covid is NOT the reason you don’t see him campaigning.  There are/were better choices for the Dem nominee.
Joe Biden will surround himself with intelligent people qualified for their jobs. I don't want exciting, I want a good night's sleep.
Funniest tweet of the day.  No one over the age of 12 would confuse Biden with a brilliant person... but thanks for the ROFL
you want to know how to win? simple. biden won't pass Med4ALL so you should do it.
This is fantasy propaganda, No-Show Biden is mentally unfit for any office. The obvious misleading need for perpetrating lies is the campaign the Democrats have chosen. It's pathetic...
Oh I think there’s a good many arguments he could use against Biden.Why don’t you guys call up Schumer and Pelosi and let them know that if they don’t get this stimulus deal passed. Then all these ads and all the time you spent helping Biden won’t be worth a hill of beans come November.
The working-class will vote for Trump the Moochers of America will vote for Biden
Biden probably does not want to debate because there is a lack of adult diapers.
That's why they call him hiden Biden
The liberals are using the unemployed as a bargaining chip to get funding for their states. That’s the 100% truth to the matter. They aren’t negotiating. They are sticking to their position. Where is Biden? Where is anyone besides Pelosi and Schumer. They have miscalculated
We need a movement that shakes the ROOTS of AMERICA! Biden 2020!!
If you want my vote Joe Biden you got a couple hours to get a hold of Schumer and Pelosi and figure out why they refuse to make concessions to get a deal done. Figure out why they cost my family $1200 in the last 2 weeks by not accepting the UI extension. They are costing you.
The democrats cost Biden the WH and they cost themselves a majority in the senate by not passing UI extension
Biden losing votes. Why won’t the democrats negotiate? Why have they refused 2 1 week extension to the UI. Where’s Biden? Why doesn’t he tell Pelosi and Schumer to cut back the wish list and get a deal done before it cost Biden the election. Y’all know how many swing votes on UI?
Schumer and Pelosi cost a lot of struggling people $1200 the last 2 weeks because they didn’t except the UI extension. I was totally prepared to vote for Biden but I’m not anymore.
Obama took Christ out. Nancy doesn't want it back in.!! Nor does Biden.!
She’s not doing Biden any favors by handing Trump the unemployed vote when he issues executive order on UI
I’ve got to say, the Joe Biden campaign has exceeded expectations
Fact. Socialists, atheists and Marxist’s coalitions support Biden.
Says the man who stole money by from children with cancer! Your whole family is corrupt!! Your daddy can ‘t hold a candle to Joe Biden!!
Is this Biden dressed up as a woman? 😂
What???  I would vote for Kanye before I would Biden.
Biden will have to walk off in middle. Orange man will not debate, just start fifteen sentences and throw his hands around. Embarrassing.
Biden is not a crook. Not prison bound.
😂🤣😂LMAO! I have to laugh before I cry! This who the GOP chose to lead them? They are just as dumb as he is! This is just disheartening to watch him destroy our BELOVED AMERICA! Everyone that is outraged: PLEASE GO AND VOTE BIDEN ON NOVEMBER 3RD! WE HAVE TO RECLAIM OUR COUNTRY!
Gov Asa *the media wants your kids home not in school and you to be home not at work. This is all for Nov 3rd. If Biden wins the narrative will be turned to "how many have recovered not how many sick" If Trump wins it will be end of days talk as we have now but kicked up a notch
a sketch with Trump and Biden having a debate, the environment is exactly like a debate with moderators and everything but it turns out to be WWE Smackdown and the moderators provide professional commentary.
Better yet, how many people vote for Kanye because they hate trump and Biden is too sleepy to run a country? 🤔
Articulate if you will what made Obama SOOOO terrible. Use your words. Also, it’s been several months now since it was uncovered that there was no impropriety with Biden re: Ukraine.
Biden all the way no matter what but I chose Harris way way back.
It’s so funny how everything he is saying about Biden is true of his father. He never stays on point, words don’t make sense, says things that even my 10 yr old says just doesn’t make logical sense. Let’s not forget he brags about taking and passing a very simple cognitive test
So you are trying to turn people against Biden and toward Trump? And what exactly do you stand for again?
Remember that the Right thinks Obama and Biden are extreme Leftists.
Sorry, (not sorry) I don't see evil with Joe Biden and I don't think he is mediocre.
As a decision looms, the camps are jockeying for position.
If that is the Ukraine that might be Biden's son going between his whore and to pick up a million or so for last month's "consulting" fee.
The only ones that think Biden is a Leftist are Right Wingnuts, but to them, Saint Ronnie, Barry Goldwater, and Bob Dole would be Socialist hacks not even mentioning Eisenhower.
If Trump loses, let’s make him legally forced to live in the White House for all of Biden’s term. Imagine him having to remember his worst failure &amp; overhear Biden undo his laws and fix his screwups. I think that’d be torture for him, especially since we know he’ll never see jail
Seeing as you are okay being a rat!! I will try to understand your bs!! Biden is an idiot!! He can’t even remember his name half the time.!! #Trump2020 #Trump2020LandslideVictory
Pro life = Pro mask, Pro lockdown, Pro Biden
I sleep better if I listen to a Biden speech before I go to bed.
Well your Dad wrote shot like this...you think this is ok? Lower income people are worthless to your family? Take the silver spoon out of your mouth for a moment and ask them our self is it worth standing up for tainted blood. Biden is just strange but damn he had to go there.
~Biden wants Harris as his VP?!! My goodness, look at the state she represents.!!
And Biden wants Harris as his VP?!! Hell, look at the state she represents!I like how you slithered in this conversation Trump supporter. Your guy is an open White Supremacist Racist. Joe Biden is definitely better than him. Any day of the week!
Biden apparently doesn’t think so:
Communist Party endorses Joe Biden! 😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳
Yes, just not permanent unless Biden should win!
Amen to that! The only difference is we will recover from Covid, but would NEVER recover from a Biden presidency!
Surely she is not the top candidate! But, then again, Biden has changed a lot!
It won't matter. If he waits til then and Biden should win, he would have to peosecute a President. Of course that isn't going to happen.
Where are the others like Obama, Rice, Biden!
If you were watching Fox a few moments ago. I think you will agree with me that Cris Coons needs a brain check. He says Biden hasn't moved left and that he is best candidate they could put forward in this election!🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Can’t wait to hit that Biden button
Joe Biden has promised to DEFUND ICE ALONG WITH THE POLICE! No law and order anyplace in America! Is that what you CD really want???😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳
Joe Biden wants to change all that! 😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡
I think you are right! Biden doesn't even know what feacking is anyway. You can tell when he talks about it!
Biden is as much of a criminal as trump is.
This is why I hope Biden chose her. She is a looney and everybody knows it!Got a huge tip about who Joe Biden is picking as his VP and let me tell you:  you get a VP and you get a VP and you get a VP too.
Biden is better than Trump.
Can you also explain away the Biden comment: “You’ve got more questions?' Biden replied. 'Well I tell you what, if you have a problem figuring out whether you’re for me or Trump, then you ain’t black.”
‘Sit down’: Trump buried in mockery and scorn for claiming Biden ‘no longer worthy of the Black Vote’ #SmartNews that and wants to take away GOD as a practicing Catholic! This guy just gets NOTHING right
Hearing that Joe Biden is set to announce his VP at a time on a day.
Rose is red flag. Russian bots or malignant violent agitators possibly even agent provocateur. The hateful transparent lies about Biden are dead giveaway. They want Stalin, Mao or Pol Pot. Few if any grasp democratic socialism. I trust neither Trumpkins or fanatics.
The only person who has actually taken away anything weapons related in almost 30 years was your bitch ass.  Biden sucks but anyone who thinks Trump‘s pro 2A are fudd cucks who probably use .45 acp rounds as butt plugs
It doesn’t matter they would attack any qualified person who Biden picks. Susan Rice brings needed stability to our Foreign Policy.
All VP wannabes have baggage. I've never been one for purity tests, even less so this cycle. If it's Biden-Rice, I'll proudly stick in a yard sign &amp; slap on a bumper sticker. YMMV
Biden is the one w cognitive issues tho right?
Go read my original statement, I’m not a Biden fan, I just hate Trump way more. I know the DNC fucked everything up BUT I still don’t want Trump
In the basement with Biden😎
He forgot which button unlocks the door. Dr.Biden is abusing her husband? Someone call SENIOR PROTECTION AGENCY! QUID PRO QUO JOE is the Man in front of the Mask, not behind.  DIMocrat SOCIALIST Party is BEHIND THE MASK OF JOE BIDEN'S CANDIDACY! Are there keys in the ignition?
Joe Biden is literally as Catholic as any human being can be
Trump has proved he’s not it, Biden probably isn’t either but it’s his turn
Would love some Biden/Trump polling crosstabs on people who reuse plastic deli meat containers.
Biden literally doesn’t support a single thing on the list💀 I would love to get like at least 3 of these
I’m sad to say that people stick with parties and Trump is definitely not it and if Biden doesn’t win then Trump will, so take you pick if your not sold on either but me I’d rather have four years of Biden then four more years of Trump
If I hear... "C/Mon Man" one more time from Biden...
Vote Biden. I don't work for you! C'mon man!! #BidenCampaignSlogans
“Well I tell you what, If you have a problem figuring out whether you're for me or Trump, then you ain't black.”
“Well I tell you what, If you have a problem figuring out whether you're for me or Trump, then you ain't black.”
I agree. This is an election that is literally  freedom vs slavery. If Biden wins we lose everything. He basically gives away they keys to the store day one. Who does he give the keys too tho? Special interest? NGO's? Rothschild? It's the most important election ever.
Ah yes.   Devout, still practicing, Catholic Joe Biden will hurt God, not the *checks notes* thrice married billionaire (still under review) who cheated on every one of wives.   Makes sense.
Y’all watch Joe Biden disrespect black people every other week and still gonna vote for him
It means Biden should not be POTUS.
Really don't care who Biden picks for VP, only that he wins. The suburban kommunist' kidz' Klub Marxist-ME-ME-ME-MEist brigade can spare me their "demands". There are many critical issues requiring attention (a pandemic for instance) that affect everyone.
"Yes, yes," Biden responded. "And by the way, what you all know, but most people don’t know, unlike the African American community, with notable exceptions, the Latino community is an incredibly diverse community with incredibly different attitudes about different things.”
Pretty low to use a newspaper photo expressly against their wishes in a political ad.
Oops you mistakenly used Biden ‘s name where trump’s name should go.
AND  are critical of Trump.  They repeat every word to criticize.  They show him constantly saying the words.  They report on Trump, about Trump, and play him back over and over.  HOW ABOUT SLIPPING IN A WORD ABOUT BIDEN OCCASIONALLY?
President elect Biden
And you actually thing Joe Biden can lead a country with dimentia ?
If Biden’s ass pick Kamala and I’ll know he just wanna piss off the black community at that point.
A "bug" at Twitter treats Trump FAR more favorably than Biden. Election tampering in Facebook land?
It sure has sucked for last 3.5 yrs. voting for Biden
If we win the Senate AND do away with the filibuster, Biden will be able to complete the census (assuming the GOP-led SCOTUS permits it).  My guess is that if Trump cuts it short, it'll stay short.
This should let people who are on the fence about Biden know that the Trump administration thinks they are too stupid to realize a vote for Kanye is a vote for Trump
Joe Biden can’t appear, he can’t hold a conversation, or a thought.
Trump is that arrogant! He thinks his lawyer's and position of power can keep him out of trouble....And yes the attacks on Biden are unfounded.
Biden just needs to sit back and laugh at the free campaign ad Dump is giving him.
One of the obama's, they need name recognition to carry the ticket. Biden can barely stand up. So the need a name people like.
We call men who want to be President “leaders.” We call women who want to be President “ambitious.”  I hope Joe Biden picks the most ambitious Vice President in the history of the Republic.
It's funny you say this about Biden when trump has actually been accused of pedophilia and been linked to Jeffrey Epstein.
Trump’s in a tough spot. He has 2 show face 2 help his re-election chances but when he does interviews he shoot himself in the foot. Same 4 Biden but the only diff is most ppl dont like Trump &amp; lack confidence in him. it’s crazy that both candidates don’t need to talk 🤦🏾‍♂️
First  runs the #MobBoss's anti-Biden ad in their newscast (free).  Then they run the #MobBoss's campaign speech ("the virus...right!).  I guess MSNBC and  are back to 2016 trying to elect this anti-American slime.  Why?
She should fit wright in with the democrats but it will be a challenge to tell who lies more her or biden.
It is crazy there is all this talk about who should replace Ellen before she has even been announced as Biden’s running mate.
I hear Biden is leading Trump by 100% in China. Maybe you could start there. China. You Kook!
I only have one expectation. That they not be a rabid mass murderous war pig....neither Trump nor Biden make this low bar
Biden is fascist lite, war criminal extremist. They both make me sick
I know. Biden doesn’t tweet himself. He is somewhere doing something. He probably doesn't even know what he doing. You can continue to live this hyperbolic fear. But by all means, you are more than welcome to live somewhere else. I recommend Russia. It’s all Dems talk about.
In 2008 the convention started Aug 25th because they waited until the Olympics were over in Beijing.   Biden was announced on the 23rd. Palin was announced on the 29th   Paul Ryan was announced August 12th, 2012  People are only saying this is “late” because they are impatient.
Name your most urgent THREE things Biden must fix.  I'll start: 1)end family separations. 2)develop a federal COVID response. 3)tear down the wall.
Arkansan voter here: I'll vote for you maybe or maybe not. I don't really give a damn about your refusal to endorse Biden.
Biden literally said he wants a running mate who could lead the party after he’s done
Or w/anyone who might cause Biden's name to be linked to them no matter how far a stretch.
If you do this a large amount of biden votes will just not happen, we might not vote a lot but we vote overwhelmingly blue
he and Biden are working together though!!
The hot-take about Biden being too slow or indecisive with his VP choice makes no sense to me. Obama announced Biden as his VP on August 23rd.
I’m ready for Vice President Harris.
We have Biden signs, so come on up and I’ll introduce you “Big Foot” #FoukeMonster  🙄
Oh - forgot about Cuba. Bass  would be a lead anchor for Biden's ship.
The Catholic pull of Biden could put a few more parishes in play. Not to mention the state re-elected it’s Democratic Governor.
Hate to see that in anyone, but knowing this you would think he would layoff Biden's perceived issues because of karma and all.
I’m feeling great about Biden. The gop messed up America again. Democrats will it again.
If Biden picks a tomato can for VP, I'll be all about Biden/tomato can 2020.
My thoughts? I think Joe Biden isn't able to give a complete thought, you pony boy! I cha challenge you to  ah  push ups.
I'm just hoping that these "people" go back underground when Biden is elected.
And this complete and utter fool questions Biden’s cognizance?  What a complete moron!
I'm guilty of this, too.  If we put huge political pressure on Biden, they might go after all of Trump's minions.  But wouldn't that look like "jail your opponents" that Putin does and how we accuse Trump of wanting to do?  Let's just let the DOJ do its job &amp; stay quiet.
Harris the logical choice. Demings is a good choice as well. We want a successor to Biden.
If Biden adds unbanning TikTok to his platform he’ll get youth turnout that Bernie could only dream about
There has been absolutely no build up from the media regarding the “leak” from politico, if Biden was gonna pick Kamala tomorrow, we would know
Biden picks her and it’s an L. Be smart, for the love of Corn Pop, Joe, PICK KAMALA HARRIS!
No disrespect at all to Karen Bass, but if Biden doesn’t pick Kamala he’s a damned fool.
Pretty sure he was wearing a Clinton or Biden shirt, and he was also talkin smak about us attacking  and taking their land 🤣🤣
I am not even a little bit sick and tired of Biden taken his time to get a really important decision right.
This is true: “It doesn’t matter who Joe Biden picks as his running mate – somebody will be disappointed.”  BUT THIS IS TRUER: “More so than in past cycles, Democrats across the party say they just want to see Biden beat Trump.”
“People are voting for Joe Biden because he wouldn’t have allowed Putin to slaughter American soldiers the way Big Donnie did.”  While Biden was VP, he allowed Iran to pay bounties for dead Americans &amp; did nothing about it.
Joe Biden’s running mate will be an extremely qualified pick, and the Twittersphere’s dynamic of pitting one woman against another is increasingly frustrating and needs to stop.
Bunker boy? Biden is the one that has been in a basement for the last several months.  Your attacks would be more effective if they included actual facts.
Don’t you have covid? Biden is a better man, father and husband than any person named Trump.
10 yrs in this place called Twitter. The last 4 I have been more active than ever. Resist. Vote. Vote Biden. Vote Blue. In every  local, state and national election vote Democrat. Let’s take our country back and make things right for all of us.
So....is Joe Biden actually running for President?
It's almost as much fun as if Biden picked Hillary just to watch them implode knowing they can't beat him, and if they kill him they'd get president Hillary. They'd break entirely. He'd be able to just lead into every argument with "so I was considering stepping down"
FLASHBACK: Conservatives attacked Joe Biden for predicting Trump would try to delay the 2020 election #SmartNews #JoeGotThatRight
I think the only way to really know the answer is to put Biden in charge and see what happens.
Trump is now officially pushing to delay the Election. Not because it’s unsafe—he’s sending kids to school. So things, to him, aren’t that bad.  He’s pushing to delay the election because he’s f*cked his presidency up so bad that there is NO way for him to steal it from Biden.
One thing for certain, Biden has no sense, whatsoever!!!!
I think “Modern Sexism” can be overcome. But I think it is ingrained most deeply in white men and white women (particularly southern white women). I don’t even know if it will keep Biden from choosing Harris.
a campaign. I hope he recognizes that. But I think this group around Biden will not make the same accusations against a woman who didn’t run for the WH herself. Someone who looks like they have been called to public service by Biden.
Have you heard Joe Biden try and form a sentence?
I second that - it's a good, therapeutic way of handling it. From the sounds of it it's too late because of the bank's involvement.
In Arkansas I’m going to early vote on Monday October 19th for Joe Biden!
Perhaps shifting gears to 2022?  Saving for blitz this fall? Waiting to allocate to best chances to hold onto Senate? Trump has already lost 65+ (reliable!) vote which he won last time. Other crucial suburban vote now for Biden.

Joe Biden sounds like he hates blacks, and implies that they are all yellow boxes just the same. He's an old douche for putting all blacks in the same boat. Doesn't matter what race you are in, there are always ppl who have different thoughts.
In today's news, Biden said two extremely racist things 2 days in a row and no one cares, will probably still win 90% of the minority vote.

Lol, that's not how any of this works. Electoral politics is much more complicated than that. Biden will not win deep red states the only way to waste your vote in those states is to vote for Biden, only a third party vote has any chance of creating a better system in that case
Are you kidding with this BS? If Biden loses it will be because of people like Biden at the DNC who chose to run a campaign specifically opposed to progressive policies in hopes of winning over Republicans while alienating their base and ignoring the good of the nation at large
Biden is neither courageous nor competent, doubt he can tie his own shoe at this point... The DNC is great at self sabotage

Yeah it’s pretty strange Biden doesn’t have a VP yet. Right?
Aside from the Putin bit, these tropes also apply to Biden especially the serial lying, &amp; as for who he serves its clearly not the people but instead the private sector who profits from his feckless neoliberal agenda. We need a progressive party because democrats aren't one
With Biden as the nominee its actually wrong vs slightly more wrong. Imagine if we actually had a candidate worth getting behind.

Biden's ego doesn't require ridiculous arena style rallies. Democrats don't worship their candidates, so they don't feel the need to show up like Biden's some kind of rock star.
If you vote for Biden you will lose a lot more than you’re paying out now.  Please do your research on his proposed taxes plans.
So in your mind Joe Biden is the better candidate?  Are you deaf and blind or just flat out crazy?
Get ready to enjoy him for the next four years too.  You are completely contracting if you believe that Biden isn’t a pedo.  There is clear multitude of videos of him smelling young girls.  Dude is brain dead and couldn’t run a lemonade stand if he tried.

Joe Biden can choose Sarah Palin as his VP and I’ll still vote for him.
Hillary got 3 million more votes than Trump (and 90% of the black vote) and that was BEFORE Trump killed 150K+ and let unemployment skyrocket to double digits due to his incompetence. Biden has no worries about the black vote. Even southern boy Clinton got over 85% of the blacks.

I was looking at the exchange rate with China in previous years and it was treasonous. So wrong, how can USA pay so much and China were pennies. Did Biden know about that and didn't do anything about the exchange rate? Can we trust him?

CNN hasnt mentioned K Harris calling Biden a racist (because he is). Nor has CNN mentioned that Bill Clintons name is all over the Maxwell docs. CNN hasnt denounced BLM as they are a terrorist organization. CNN makes up lots kf lies. CNN is a problem.
Good choice. He was going to carry CA anyway, but she will bring energy.  Had Biden chosen a WF, he would've been doing damage control 4 weeks. Harris makes it harder to use the crime in the streets BS as the narrative. She can punch w/o seeming mean, vital for a woman candidate.
however, the chances of him being elected are slim to none. In that event it is political suicide for her to associate herself with Joe Biden
Of course it could be a shrewd move on her part if she thinks that is the only way she is likely to become president.  If Biden does get elected it’s a foregone conclusion that she will become president
Politically I think that Kamala Harris should have refused to be the VP pick. I thought she was smart enough not to allow herself to be played as Biden’s patsy simply because she is female. Guess I over estimated her intelligence.

Here's What You Need To Know About Joe Biden's Running Mate, Kamala Harris
Kamala and her stupid giggling is the best gift the Biden campaign could have given us.    Mucus gracias!  #TrumpPence2020
I do agree with you on this. My feelings are on my sleeve about this stuff as it is. Biden is extremely status quo. No shock. But he’s still my choice. For my sanity at the very least.
Oh, I'm certainly not a fan of the Biden camp at all either. CNN gave him millions of free advertising during the primary. CNN goes in hand with what the DNC wants about as much as FOX goes in hand with what the RNC wants.
I've been pretty sure that's where it was headed for a while, too. Felt pretty sure that Warren had no shot. If Biden wins and Harris leaves the Senate, she'll be replaced by another democrat (most likely a more moderate one... blech) in California. Risk is greater with Warren
All of the choices that Biden was seriously considering were black women. No matter who he chose (Warren and Whitmer were never going to be picked), this was going to be the story. I prefer Harris in that she actually has supported some legit left policies, unlike Biden
I don't think the VP sets policy, but I do feel that the likelihood that Biden is only a one term president means that his VP decision was more of a "future of the party" choice than anything else. She's the immediate 2024 front-runner
Flipped to CNN. As expected, it's nothing but "First African American woman.." "First woman of Asian descent.." It's so irritating that this is considered more important than policy at all. We're right back to the "Biden's more electable" crap. Talk about policies at some point
In May of this year Kamala Harris was asked if she would accept VP slot with Biden.      She replied, “Joe would make a good running mate for her since he knows a lot about being VP”.
Honest question: has anyone else had trouble giving money to Joe Biden? I cannot bring myself to do it.
Harris, a 55-year-old first-term senator, is also one of the party’s most prominent figures and quickly became a top contender for the No. 2 spot after her own White House campaign ended.

I completely understand not voting for him and not liking him surely you can’t consciously vote for Biden and think that dude is fit to run the country
What's to debate? The American people want Trump out! Biden doesn't have to debate. All Trump wants is the circus he would turn a debate into. He would get up and walk around in disrespect of Biden. That's all it would be. The American people now know  the real Trump.
A Biden built 'economy' wouldn't exist. As free and legal looting would become the American normal.

Put the crack pipe down and step away! Nov. 3rd will be an EPIC win for President Trump! Your Alzheimer's patient isn't going to make the 1st debate! You should be embarrassed by Biden but BC you're not, it shows your lack of intelligence. #4MoreYears  #Trump2020Landslide
You don’t have to like Trump and you don’t have to vote for Trump but there is no way you vote for Biden and and say that you want what’s best for the country
Deeper than that it's a clear and deliberate attempt on behalf of GOP to use Ye to deter votes from Biden, securing a higher percentage for Trump.   Either he's in on it or they're using his mental instability for their political chess game. Both are wrong.
put this guy back in the basement until the election please
Why Joe Biden May Be Exactly What The Country Needs Right Now | Deadline...  via
Trump says Joe Biden has the power to “hurt God.”  Only a damn fool would vote against a man with that kind of power!!!
Biden will hurt God and the bible, lol.
The Only Cognitive Test Biden Needs to Take: Debate Trump
That is good and hoping to see all states are like Ohio. I believe they will be like Ohio.i don't hear anything substantial came out of Biden's mouth or written except for the million jobs he will outsource. No American will vote for that.
WCE are never going to vote for Biden, or any other progressive. It's true that Trump is making a (clumsy and inarticulate) bid for their support -- which he already has.   So really all his pandering is nothing but attempts to get more applause. Which is pathetic.
Yea the same one on a phone call with Biden on tape saying “He had no reason to believe he was corrupt but would fire him if it got him the money” Tape is out there.
So what Joe Biden is saying is that he understands the separation of powers &amp;  will honor his oath to the Constitution. #DonaldTrump has never read the Constitution and even if he tried he wouldn't comprehend it. POTUS should be loyal to America not Putin.
First we have to elect Biden. I have it on good authority that he plans to "hurt God."
I would pitch a tent &amp; camp out for days.  I am voting for Joe Biden on 11/3/2020 to Make America America Again.  💙🇺🇸💙 I am voting straight anti-Repugnantcan ⬆️ &amp; ⬇️ the ballot!
Nice ride #Biden..... #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica #RidinWithBiden2020
My friends all over the nation are voting for Trump and not Biden. I am confident Trump will be reelected.
It is a great way for the public to get to know you &amp; Biden. I think the exchange between you two will be a great way to help people to decide on whom to vote for.
Trump is the smartest I have seen in USA. He is a great communicator! Having problem with an interview? That is doubtful. If Trump could handle Hilary, Biden would be a piece of paper to crumple. I doubt your reasoning. Lot of lies circulating on internet.Harris Biden n Obama lie more
The one thing I can not wait for when we have a Biden/Harris administration is the Trump Crime Commission run by AG Glen Kirschner!   Everyone of these criminals and their accomplices need to pay for enabling this crook!
Vote Biden. Don’t repeat your mistake
You can say that again. My stepmom is vehemently anti-Trump and will be voting for Biden and Harris this November. What an asshole. I am so glad I know the truth about  and  and
4) this nonsense, I’ll take and I did take Trump over party, he has looked out for our best interest from day one, he has always loved this country as I do, every democrat I know are dispicable liars just in it for themselves and republicans, VOTE TRUMP!!! Leave the biden trash
1)Why do you think democrats didn’t complain they wanted that knowing it would get worse before elections and hope they could blame Trump, the democrat ticket is a direct result of the corrupt party biden has no chance he admitted he is in it for one term, this all to try and
He's far from perfect. He's better than Biden and the Dems.
Of course I voted for Hillary, just like the majority of voters did. And I will vote for Biden, just like the majority of voters will. And no, unlike just an entry on a flight log, I use actual incriminating evidence (video, accusations from victims, quotes from participants).
Joe Biden pronounced it the same way....
I have loved learning from you and if you think Trump is awesome or just ok or needs to be replaced or if Biden is awesome or just ok or should have been Bernie... honestly I just want to get published. And if your work helps me do that, think/post what you want.
'Kamala will challenge my assumptions, ask the hard questions."-great message by Biden! #BidenHarris2020
I can’t understand how the people who have listened to Ku Klux word salad for the last four years have the fucking audacity to call Biden senile
Journos just making it up as they go along.  Anything to try and stay in that "Biden for Pres" lane.  Goodness.  They have no shame.  Harris isn't a small "c" conservative, that's an absolutely laughable thing to write.  She's a "Big PL", progressive liberal.  What a joke.
Ah you finally caught him!  Now listen to Biden, he is running for US senate!  You missed that didn’t u?   Your guy can’t put two coherent sentences together and Trump runs the world!
I held my nose and voted for Hillary b/c I recognize a narcissistic personality when I see one  This year I'm enthusiastically voting for Joe Biden not only because my initial judgment of Donald Trump was right, but b/c Biden is the right man to heal our country.  #LincolnVoter
My Brit buddy just passed me again and still laughing saying Harris is that all you got, I told him I have Trump the democrats have her, still he said is that all biden and harris hahahaha
Let’s be honest no one even cares about that debate. Trump will be bathing in Biden’s blood by the time it’s all over and Dems will be looking for a replacement. ( which im sure they’re actively already doing )
Biden is currently more likely to win... but it's not guaranteed.
pardon me, FIRST what we’re not gonna do is not manage to elect Biden in 2020 like some of y’all did with Hillary in 2016 just because she doesn’t check every one of your seventy set dream socialist boxes
Joe Biden is Catholic... And crap like this is one of the reasons I no longer am....
Pro-Life vs. Pro-Abortion is a clear choice for America this November. Biden has officially made clear he will not be moderate in his selection of nominees, Harris is radical about abortion.  and Pence are unquestionably the most Pro-Life pick. #Vote
It just doesn't make sense (even if it was just meant as sick burn on Biden), since there wouldn't have been a Catholic on the ticket in 08 and 12 either. And 92, 96, and 00 were also RC-free zones. Bizarre.
How Biden selected Kamala Harris as his running mate
Ummm...Joe Biden blew it for himself, he needs no help for anyone
not voting for joe biden is a vote for trump. idgaf what you say. refusing to not vote for biden bcuz he isn’t bernie is selfish. you might as well be a trump supporter. #BidenHarris2020
doesn’t report the news... therefore Chief’s of No News.  Listened them again today for nearly 2 hours. Zilch about BLM, riots, looting, Seattle, Chicago, NY, Portland, shooting  The White House...only protection of virus fear, Biden and hate of Trump. That’s it!
Biden was not my choice. I have really struggled feeling excited about the campaign until now.

I'm tired of people thinking joe biden will make things better.

just finished watching 2016 debate with Killary. Prophetic looking at your achievements the past 4 yrs. Excellence! Coaches watch game films in preparation for battle. As you prepare 4 election reflect &amp; enjoy!  We r behind you, hit Biden hard, if not harder!
Blacks for Trump. Women for Trump. Latinos for Trump. Trump is so polarizing and sexist and racist that the pro-Trump minority factions have to have labels to make it sound like they have some significant movement.  Meanwhile, it’s just People for Biden.
Everything about Biden concerns me.
Yep....anybody for Biden abortion-killing is LOST
Come on, man!  Even Biden doesn't speak Biden! 🤣
This won’t affect people already on SS -on the off chance anything even happens on this -if he messes with it permanently then people like me won’t have SS when I’m FRA. But don’t stress. My mom already called me and was freakin out.On a positive she’s voting for Biden now

Biden might be mentally declining, but he had something to start with. The current leader is declining from basically nothing. I trust Biden will also surround himself with professionals with knowledge, unlike now.

You are really commenting on Biden’s intelligence and sharpness? You bragged about performing well on a dementia screening test. Think about why you might have been given that test. It’s not standard, I assure you. Keep talking. You get dumber every day.
I never once said I was, now did I? I was commenting on this to say basically I wouldn’t trust Biden to be the best canidate. He’s not all there, it’s very clear. I’m more concerned for his health, honestly.

You don’t care that Biden plagiarizes his speeches or inappropriately touches kids? Which one? Or that Kamala lied about bumping Pac &amp; Snoop while burning one in college in 85? A lot to not care about there! 😂
FYI - The Trump Administration has added more jobs THIS YEAR than the Obama/Biden Administration did in EIGHT YEARS.  The only thing you will change is raising taxes and crashing the economy and jobs with it.
Biden is a total creep.
Hillary was up more than that at this point. Biden will lose
I said SAME thing! 😉   "It shows he's comfortable with strong younger people and strong younger women of color. He's not intimidated," she said. Together Biden and Harris will be formidable...”

Also, since this is blowing up, I have another message. If you can vote, VOTE TRUMP OUT OF OFFICE!!!! Biden's not perfect, but he's not a narcissistic, egomaniacal, authoritarian wannabe! Vote on November 3 to get him out of office!
If it was Joe Biden that said that it would be fine. But Orange man says it and oh boy is he stupid
I thought the issue was whether a politician's wife is responsible for his behavior. I don't believe Biden has dementia, and I believe he is more mentally competent than the man who thought COVID would peak at 15 cases and can't pronounce Yosemite. He doesn't need my protection.
Yes, people can learn from their mistakes. But people who seek public office should know that every mistake they’ve made will be scrutinized.  Biden is less liberal than Hillary yet he didn’t vote Clinton in ‘16. It opens a window into Dan’s unprincipled, conspiratorial thinking.
Projecting again. You were the laughing stock of the world. Now, the world grieves for the US. You have failed miserably. There is no way anyone else, including Biden, would be worse than you. A tree stump would have done better!
first hand experience shaken down by the Clinton’s (twice) my dads law firm was Nixon’s attorney in event he went to impeachment trial. They “fired” Nixon. Biden’s corruption has been documented extensively. Hope my niece never writes about me. She knows nothing about what I do.
I guess Biden for president. 😒 habiendo tanta persona inteligente, decente en este pais, &amp; we are stuck with those 2 options ni modo. But we can’t have 45 back in office. But once AOC can run, ya’ll better believe we are fundraising, donating, raising heck &amp; making her president
What about investigating Obama -Biden; Biden being one of the most corrupt in history - up there with Nixon and Clinton.
That Kamala is *ACTUALLY* Joe Biden's MOTHER!
So Barr will be some guy trump barely knows unless he prosecutes President Obama &amp; Biden? Do I have the right take on that?

I believe so. I don’t have the stats but from observation only I don’t believe there is a discrepancy in live media coverage between POTUS and VP Biden. Not sure where to find the numbers on that though.
Us normal people have no clue either and can’t wait for the election when we can put a decent man in office Joe Biden and KAMALA Harris for VP.
Biden is a career politician. She called him a racist during her run. Odd they a pair now. All I'm saying
Trump is terrified of Kamala Harris. Biden Harris equals defeat to him. They will be unstoppable! Trump, get ready for a jail cell buddy!

Since Dan recently decided to free me from Whitfield Twitter Jail, I’ll answer for him!  He “claims” he’s voting for Biden. I find that rather strange since he voted Jill Stein in 2016.
Looks like Biden's selection of Harris has totally discombobulated Trump and all his Republican cultists.
Absolutely! Go BIDEN-HARRIS 2020!!!

It’s not an assumption. Biden has been explicit that race and sex are deciding factors in his selection of a running mate.
It's hard to make his campaign against Joe Biden about "Mental Competence" when he can't pronounce common words and his greatest academic achievement to date has been the cognitive exam involving animal shapes and memorization.

Let me say this . It’s not about Biden, Trump, Democrat , Republican. It’s about this country the hatred , racism, division, etc everything is setup to divide individuals, races, whatever it may be so it’s not about political parties with me.
Yes, and I wouldn't be surprised if Biden has read it.   (Trump doesn't need to read a stinkin' book. Especially not one about Lincoln, whose accomplishments were “always questionable.” According to the  Finest.)

Why Joe Biden Picked Kamala Harris - The Atlantic
Laughable. I’m a 73 year old White woman. When I heard Kamala was Biden’s choice I felt tears of happiness streaming down my face.❤️💃☮️
The funny part about all of this is that nothing can top the carnival of stupidity we’ve had to endure these last few years. Anything they say about Biden to me sounds like “pot meet kettle” at this point. 👍👍
Joe Biden acting like he just really for black people......
Please end the nightmare! If anyone can do it, it will be Biden/Harris!
Yup agreed. My wife and I are privileged to know many black women as you described. We are voting for four of them in various statewide elections.  Definitely like the VP choice of Kamela Harris.  Joe Biden would be the first to say he had a great group of women to select from!
Could have done better. Nobody ever said the woman or any candidate is perfect but she is highly qualified and deserves a chance. Same I feel with Biden. If nothing else y’all need to be looking at what they are advocating for today
Have you kept up with anything she’s done recently? Everyone keep speaking on times when most thought the tough on crime thing was the way to go.. this was years ago same excuse y’all want to use on Biden. &amp; as AG of course there will be things she
Worse than that. Biden doesn't have the cognitive ability to do it even with a teleprompter and/or his wife by his side.

Well someone posted that Ben Shapiro thinks Kamala is going to try to kill Biden. So that must be the new thing.
I don’t know one person of color who would seriously vote for him. He’s trying to take the black from Biden apparently.
So... I think what the implication here is that Hillary killed Epstein and Kamala is going to kill Biden?
Question. Can trump really syccessfully use videos of riots on the streets that are happening under his watch and legitimatelly use that against Biden? I suppose it could work for getting his base out, but I just don't see how that could compel anyone on the fence.
Whyyyyy is everyone falling all over themselves to acknowledge that a Biden/Harris ticket is “imperfect.” Tired of lame people hedging their bets to look omniscient. No one is perfect, but Biden/Harris is perfect. Get on fucking board.

I never once said I was, now did I? I was commenting on this to say basically I wouldn’t trust Biden to be the best canidate. He’s not all there, it’s very clear. I’m more concerned for his health, honestly.

If it was Joe Biden that said that it would be fine. But Orange man says it and oh boy is he stupid
I thought the issue was whether a politician's wife is responsible for his behavior. I don't believe Biden has dementia, and I believe he is more mentally competent than the man who thought COVID would peak at 15 cases and can't pronounce Yosemite. He doesn't need my protection.
Yes, people can learn from their mistakes. But people who seek public office should know that every mistake they’ve made will be scrutinized.  Biden is less liberal than Hillary yet he didn’t vote Clinton in ‘16. It opens a window into Dan’s unprincipled, conspiratorial thinking.
Projecting again. You were the laughing stock of the world. Now, the world grieves for the US. You have failed miserably. There is no way anyone else, including Biden, would be worse than you. A tree stump would have done better!

Up early. As always. Mood: Good. I’m feeling.......... RELIEVED. Y’all do know that I thought Biden was going to f*ck it all up, LOL!!! I really did!  I am convinced that once he rolls out his cabinet picks, we are going to see THE most AWESOME group of WOMEN and MEN... SMH...
Trump CALLS OUT Biden's VP Kamala Harris for Being "Extraordinarily Nasty"  via  🇺🇸👏🏻🇺🇸👏🏻🇺🇸👏🏻🇺🇸👏🏻🇺🇸👏🏻🇺🇸
Almost 5 decades for me.  You are correct. As for Trump. “He has the right to remain silent, anything he says or does can and will be used against him in a court of law.” Also, when he talks s*** about Sen. Harris &amp; Vice-President Biden or on 11-4-2020 VPOTUS Harris &amp; POTUS Biden
I'm voting for Joe Biden just to see him hurt God.
I'm voting for Joe Biden just to see him hurt God.  That's a pretty awesome feat for such a sleepy guy!
Hypothetically speaking, if Biden/Harris win, I would love to see her Senate seat be replaced by  Setting him up for the national stage (which he is ready for) would bolster the 2024 Democratic field even more than it already is. Not to mention he’s highly qualified
What was wrong with  for VP? Being anti-war? Being under 70? Being anti-prohibition? These things are not on Biden's radar.

Uh, you’re so wrong. Biden is a Catholic.
I’m with you, Paul.  It was exactly the same pearl clutching bullshit that was going to happen no matter which of the suboptimal people was chosen. Either vote for Biden or don’t, but the concern and backbiting is fucking tiresome.

Why Joe Biden Picked Kamala Harris - The Atlantic
Laughable. I’m a 73 year old White woman. When I heard Kamala was Biden’s choice I felt tears of happiness streaming down my face.❤️💃☮️
The funny part about all of this is that nothing can top the carnival of stupidity we’ve had to endure these last few years. Anything they say about Biden to me sounds like “pot meet kettle” at this point. 👍👍
Joe Biden acting like he just really for black people......
Please end the nightmare! If anyone can do it, it will be Biden/Harris!
Yup agreed. My wife and I are privileged to know many black women as you described. We are voting for four of them in various statewide elections.  Definitely like the VP choice of Kamela Harris.  Joe Biden would be the first to say he had a great group of women to select from!
Could have done better. Nobody ever said the woman or any candidate is perfect but she is highly qualified and deserves a chance. Same I feel with Biden. If nothing else y’all need to be looking at what they are advocating for today
Have you kept up with anything she’s done recently? Everyone keep speaking on times when most thought the tough on crime thing was the way to go.. this was years ago same excuse y’all want to use on Biden. &amp; as AG of course there will be things she
Worse than that. Biden doesn't have the cognitive ability to do it even with a teleprompter and/or his wife by his side.
You’d never know Biden is going to be 78 this year! He’s in great shape! No sleepiness there!
Here's a guy who A. Realizes Biden has dementia; B. Is terrified he'll debate Trump.
You could have stopped at "Biden".
—With the introduction of  Things might really pick up. Republicans gone have a whole new bag of slurs 👎🏾🙄😆 sadly. OAN: Her kandor would be nice. I find Biden to be a little Boring 🤷🏾‍♂️🙄
She claimed Biden was Racist !
Watch Biden fall in the polls from this day forward!
Well someone posted that Ben Shapiro thinks Kamala is going to try to kill Biden. So that must be the new thing.
I don’t know one person of color who would seriously vote for him. He’s trying to take the black from Biden apparently.
So... I think what the implication here is that Hillary killed Epstein and Kamala is going to kill Biden?
Question. Can trump really syccessfully use videos of riots on the streets that are happening under his watch and legitimatelly use that against Biden? I suppose it could work for getting his base out, but I just don't see how that could compel anyone on the fence.
Whyyyyy is everyone falling all over themselves to acknowledge that a Biden/Harris ticket is “imperfect.” Tired of lame people hedging their bets to look omniscient. No one is perfect, but Biden/Harris is perfect. Get on fucking board.

Former Vice President Joe Biden's pick of Kamala Harris as his running mate proves he 'wants the person who forces him to be better.'
Trump 'surprised' Biden picked Kamala Harris as running mate
I don’t think it’s needed, anywhere. Just thought it was funny. With Biden’s VP pick you guys ready to double down on your bets?
FWIW, it strikes me as possible that both could occur simultaneously.  A Biden administration will have the worst kind of far left loonies (he's basically signed up for the Green New Deal, and forget Betsy DeVos' Title IX changes) while indulging Harris' carceral impulses.
OK. So here’s my question. When Biden and Harris win, what happens to Harris‘s seat in the Senate? I know it depends on what state we are talking about so what happens in California?
He is a real price and she and Biden are gonna beat his orange ads all over the place!
I hope you are right... She brings almost as much baggage with her as Joe Biden.
If I was Biden I would’ve picked a mother to portray a pro family view during pandemic. He picked a childless woman.
I really don't want to see #TrumpIsNotWell debate VP Biden.  Trump couldn't tell the truth if he had to. Difficult to debate such a person without truth-checking throughout the whole debate!
the best part about biden and harris is that once they win this election, biden’s senile self will eventually HAVE to give up the pr*sidency to the vp........and we’ll have the first black female president 🤫 but i didnt tell yall that!
Can you imagine Biden getting the debated “3 am phone call” that was all the fuss when Hillary was running ?
Now it’s time to draw back and think but when Joe Biden said if you don’t vote for him, you ain’t black... crickets 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Lol ion like how y’all was preaching talmbout don’t engage in the narrative of Joe Biden being a sucky candidate cuz we need Trump out and now since Kamala is his running mate all hell breaking loose lol lol????
Biden taps Kamala Harris as running mate, setting aside tensions from primary | Fox News
Kamala is alot craftier than Joe Biden. We have to start saying Single Payer so she has less wiggle room. Otherwise we're gonna end up with Medicare Advantage For All which is the same thing as Obamacare.
Seeing a LOT of republicans come out against sex trafficking? Good. Seeing the Clintons getting mentioned? Good. Seeing Biden get mentioned for being creepy? Also, good!  So, when are y’all gonna denounce this man that was a known Epstein &amp; Maxwell associate?  I’ll wait. . .

Biden Campaign Officials Donated Money to Group That Helped Bail Violent Criminals Out of Jail, Including a Serial Rapist and Accused Murderer
Why do ppl have to defend voting for Biden when people are talking about how ridiculous the Democratic Party is? U can vote against Trump &amp; still talk about how fucking stupid the Democratic party is right now. Stop acting like ur part of a cult that u cant critically evaluate.
Name-calling, insults and the racist birther lie allowed Trump to rise like cream in the party that admires and rewards that kind of thing. But I rather doubt using his go-to insult for strong women on Harris is going to cost Biden any votes.
The scars of racial tension are deeeeper than republican//democrat and a lot of whites don’t understand that. Some are just feeling guilty about the overt racism we’ve seen in this recent era. The shit ain’t just come from nowhere tho and it won’t magically go away under Biden
No problem..I didn't vote for him the first time around. I can't vote for Biden. I like a lot of the things Trump has done...ALOT.... Since this is an equality thread and not a " Who you support for President" thread...I'm open for dialogue.
New laptop merch incoming!! SO HERE FOR KAMALA AS VP Y'ALL I CAN'T EVEN!!!

Biden literally couldn’t have picked a worse VP pick if he tried

Abrams was my top choice for Biden's VP. Disappointed he picked Harris but I get it. I don't like it but I get it.

Biden won’t even take one
Agree. We can’t close our eyes 2 her past as AG incarcerating Black/Brown folx, but we have 2 do everything we can do ensure Biden/Harris are in the WH in 2021. Them winning does not mean the works stops. Work starts once they're in the WH. That's when we hold them accountable.

Biden you fucking idiot. Gahhhhhh  I mean, I hope this pulls Republicans over.
totally, i will def vote for Biden in a heartbeat, but i really, really hope we don't get complacent if Dems win
Quick read: Kamala Harris is a safe choice. Nobody who was really going to vote for Biden won't now. But she also won't flip any new blocs. It's a good veep pick for a candidate who believes he's already winning.
Is Kamala Harris who I wanted? Fuck no. She was the last on my list of potentials. But as expected, Biden picked her and it is what it is. I'm riding. #BidenHarris2020 #Democrats
My take is that it seemed that the obvious choice for Biden. No matter who gets elected, we advocate and agitate for our causes and hold power to account.
I’m so happy about the Biden/Harris Team, that I can hardly hold my peace! 💃🏻💃🏻This gives me so much hope that a change is going to come. May streams of Blue Wins, flow nationally and to the local level. #VoteBlue2020 #VoteBidenHarris

I'm the opposite about KH. She is the choice that makes me the least excited.  Out of all the names I've seen Ithink Warren would be the best bet, but I feel that it'll be Rice.  Ideally a woman of color would be great, but I can't see Biden choosing a progressive woman of color.
I don't know who these people on the list are speaking for but it certainly isn't for me. Nor do I think they will vote for Trump if their demands aren't met. I wouldn't respond well to coercion and neither should Biden. #Biden2020 #PickWhoYouWant

Knowledge is power, you need to quit looking at just headlines. If you think Joe Biden, suffering from dementia and had to take a backseat because of early mishandling of information, is better at handling this virus you are wrong. He called flight restrictions to China Racist
Close to 50,000 nursing home patients (what's reported) died because Governors sent infected patients into nursing homes. However, we keep blaming one person. Joe Biden had to take a backseat because of his muddled messaging during 2009, 60 million infected and we are fortunate
like, 'Biden rapes babies!', and hit her, mocking her for wearing a mask. Knocked down. Trumpers on Nextdoor were comparing her to Jussie Smollet, and one Karen kept saying 'that's not what happened, I have FACTS, I just can't share the source. It isn't true, FACTS. 🤬🙄 #Facts

At first I thought this was a “Biden is old” joke. Then I realized it was a Game of Thrones joke.
At this point, Joe Biden could get up on the stage at the convention and directly call me a prick and I’d still crawl thru broken glass covered in COVID on November 3 to vote for him. It’s just that important to change our country’s direction.
We all know the Dems project their intentions and beliefs on others.  In recent days both Biden and Hillary have projected the Dems desire to raid social security. This is clearly a talking point of the radical left and they should be challenged on it.
I can VOTE for that but I ain’t spendin’ on that. I’m not donating to any Biden/Pete sh*t or Biden/any old white milk, random, vaguely familiar D.C. insider career politician dude or even a Biden/Warren ticket.  I can’t donate MY hard earn money to that sh*t.
I may have to start donating to Biden’s campaign but I have to know who his VP pick is going to be, first.  My senate contributions are still in place, but, I want to get in on the POTUS race but don’t want to support some hack a$s establishment “beat Trump” ploy “just because.”

Not only would he be uniting but geographically it would help biden in the scheme of things. 43’s name carries so much weight in Texas and considering it’s already a battleground state, that could all but lock up the vote and solidify a victory for Biden.

If Biden gets in, first thing that needs to be done is eliminate the "acting" position bullshit.  If someone quits or gets fired, a nonpartisan career employee needs to be in charge until CONGRESS approves a replacement.  This acting crap to get your cronies in has to be stopped.
Of course. They already bought the Biden’s and they want their monies worth.

Biden/Obama did worse. If I told you one infected 60 million and one had 5 million infected, not discussing the deaths because over 74% happened in Democrat ran States, you would go with the 5 million. We are just fortunate that the same death rate wasn't falsely reported.
Honestly, I don't think Biden will serve 40 days...

I will vote for Biden regardless of who he picks. I just hope it's not Kamala Harris. I'm not feeling her. I think Val Demings, Stacy Abrams, or Elizabeth Warren are far better. JMHO
We had 60 million infected by H1N1... just think if Governors like Cuomo sent them into nursing homes as well. We have 5 million infected and Obama/Biden had 60 million. I guess we are fortunate that not every death was blamed on H1N1 or it would have been worse... Thanks MSM.

Democrats wanted complete lockdown, but it's  why millions of jobs haven't opened up, even though we keep getting better than expected job reports. How did Biden handle H1N1? 60 million infected within a year, glad more didn't die because of the infection.
Scaramucci is Pro-China ..he needs Biden in office to continue to get rich ripping off Americans.  canned his ass and now he is disgruntled.
Anthony Scaramucci is looking to bank on future China deals and needs Joe Biden in office. It's all about the money, he is a scumbag who couldn't make it 2 weeks at the White House. Will sale is his Country out for a quick buck. Can't be trusted, be careful who you defend Billy.

Not sure what beliefs Biden has that are admirable but, to each his own.  - My fear is that Biden is the puppet and a vote for him is really a vote for a much further left agenda than one might expect.

only makes this comment because the postal union backs him.  If the union backed Trump, Biden would want to dismantle the entire system.
Joe Biden is defending Michael Brown because he was such a fine roll model for young Black's.  Defending a criminal who attacked police tells you everything you need to know about  plans for America.
Can we swap things around an vote for Dr. Jill Biden instead of her husband. I think she’d be a better candidate.  seems better suited to the ceremonial post of first gentleman. Besides the nations with women in charge are doing better than all the rest.
Biden and whoever his VP is has got my vote 100%.   I want tRump out of there so much,   Don’t put any Dem down right now.  We have to remove the Republicans to save the country.
No because the only choice that polls well with the old white men around Biden is Generic Woman of Color. When you try to slot in a real person with a real record it becomes a woman but not that woman.

So you believe President Biden could also issue executive orders diverting FEMA funds during hurricane season to another federal aid service such as increasing foot stamps and you would be ok with that?
The Republican plot to put Kanye West on the ballot to siphon votes from Joe Biden. But Arkansas?  via
Jill Biden plans to continue to teach if she becomes first lady
Jill Biden is knocking them out of the park on CBS. She's a wonderful woman. If she is still on turn channel. Oh it's off. Well she spoke marvelouslyWhat a 💩 Biden is
Suck it up buttercup and vote for Biden.
And for half of those years Old Joe has wanted to Cut Social Security...
To hell with Biden, and Willy's hooker too...
He did not!! If things were great during their 8 years, why did Obama &amp; Biden blame Busch for everything their entire 8 years? You are as delusional as Biden.
Biden got something wrong? 🙀
And as a Patriot I will not vote for Biden / Harris for the benefit of this country
Seriously expect us to believe this? Should post the data of your poll with demographics and age ranges..I can write and post a poll showing anything without any data to reference...your poll is 💩💩
⁦ and ⁦ you call this leadership? I call it a failure to provide specifics to your mandate let alone not allowing questions...a leader is prepared to explain the 5 W’s!..this is staged political theatrics! Pathetic!
⁦ oh hell no will you mandate I wear a mask all the time!..you will never control my life or my choices..you hear me! Dumb ass fool
Neither do I. I’m not even talking about news though in my OP. It’s what people are posting and commenting in my FB feed. And there is a lot of it. My point was that while Harris/Biden’s records are not perfect, Trump supporters seem to look past his shady record.
Nate, curious about your thoughts on the Helmut Norpoth primary model and methodology. Seeing their prediction (91% trump, 9% Biden) shared quite a bit among conservative circles.
$5 he's in the Biden administration now. UN ambassador or something
Hey where is the social distancing...so she wore a mask yesterday walking side by side with Biden but now no mask and no social distancing. What bullshit  displays..just a power grab and says and does what it takes to move ahead..
No kidding!..I mean who the hell are they polling to show Biden is leading...absolute bs and lies!...just another way MSM is trying to persuade and disavow the public. You cannot tell me this is how mainstream America is voting let alone thinking.
What was that?
“Crowd” for Biden speech is equal to “Parking Lot Attendants” at Trump rallies.
You just described Biden! 😂 Trump2020
Please keep your promise to spend a billion to help elect Biden/Harris. Don't make us send Elizabeth to get it
all this pre-emptive scolding when Biden is going to capture middle aged white voters anyway
That koolaid you are drinking has gotten to you..the only nightmare has been Biden for 40 years in Federal government
Sure, wouldn't want to subject feeble minded Biden to any debate now would we? Might just show America how degraded the mental state of the Democrats candidate is..🤔
Everyone too weak of will to not be affected by liberal moral scolding about voting in November: just accept that Biden will win the white vote and nothing you say or do matters at all.
Look Spicy, none of us really give a flying fuck what you, the GOP or the New York Post thinks. Facts are that the Biden/Harris ticket is going to spank your asses all the way up and down the ballot.
The whole appeal of the Biden/Kamala ticket is that once they're elected you'll never have to care about BLM anymore.
LOLOL imagine thinking Joe Biden or Kamala Harris being even *remotely* Left. Biden is about as Radical as sex with socks on in the dark.
They're gonna pull out all the stops to keep Biden alive for the next 5 years, just so a woman will never be president.
Well ⁦ guess it goes to show you what sex does to help ones career..a great role model..thanks Democrats!..Red Wave in November 2020 is coming!
Biden is still going to win the white vote lmao
I ask White Democrats to quit attacking BIPOC who have their concerns on Biden or Harris. While most progressives will be voting for them because of what we’re up against, our feelings are valid and should not be ignored by your desires to have everyone vote Democrat.
What is today’s bigger news story?  Football decisions by Big 10 and PAC 10 or some random announcement from Biden about his VP?  I vote football!!  #wewanttowatchthemplay
I’m going to vote for Biden/Harris because of what is at stake, but it’s ok to be critical and not silent to the oppression of others.
The only way this could possibly be better is if Biden steps down on the convention floor, and they make Kamala the official nominee.
Biden already said he would VETO #Med4All
I can't believe Biden chose  as his running mate
I doubt Trump appoints Andrew to a post.  Oh wait.. you think choosing Harris helped Biden.  Nope.  Bad choice.
BREAKING: JOE BIDEN SELECTS KAMALA HARRIS AS HIS RUNNING MATE FOR THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION.   Learn more here —-&gt;
Biden’s handlers made a tactics error.
Yeah I’m going to criticize anybody that hurts people. Democrat or Republican. I’m voting for Biden obviously because Undocumented lives are at stake but I won’t ignore facts.
Explain to me   Maybe I’m missing something. How can anyone in their right mind support Biden.
Hell yea... by trying to lockdown to slow the arrival to herd immunity, there’s 10 billion in annual sales awaiting Big Pharma.. 40-50 Billion in vaccine sales for the next president.  Biden cant wait to get a piece of that money.  The DC whores are lining up to get paid.
Whoever he picks on the short list is fine. It won't change my mind. I am voting for Biden. He doesn't need to reveal the pick until it's the right time. Don't give the GOP any ammunition. ❤
We can't let Joe Biden get into the White House...🤣
Should be used as a top campaign video clip against Biden.
Seltzer is such a joke. Like he's not gone on non-stop attacking President Trump since he's been in office. Oh my, little Brian is upset that other media would point out Biden's failing mental state..😉
Democrats upset that President Trump is making emergency decisions from one of his properties? A while back Nancy was stalling aid and talking about gourmet ice cream in her Mansion. Democrats have over used the social security scare to panic older voters.
So the Biden plan is to claim it's going to do what President Trump was already doing before Democrats power tripped on pandemic and stopped it??? Can you get a little more creative? Stop making claims that Democrats can't deliver on..😉
Wow, now if they find a Biden connection it would be over for Dems...
You expect this kind of misinformation from Democrats, lying is part of their nature...🤣🤣🤣 Truth is, Trump has more support now because of Biden..😉
He must work for Biden's campaign..🤣🤣🤣
This is exactly why Biden has waited to announce his VP. Don't give them anything until you have to. #WeHaveHerBack
I’ve said this every since he said he was running.  This is a plan by trump. Get him in the ballot to pull votes from Biden.
Eh? Give Biden a few more days and a few more interviews. It will be a moot point.
Reagan was 69 when he took office. Biden would be 78...
What’s your point?  That wasn’t his statement.  Biden is not a good candidate.  It wasn’t about who is less likeable.  Trump is the better presidential candidate and it’s not really close.
Hating Trump doesn’t mean you have to vote for Biden. They’re both pieces of shit. Look into the independent candidates
Who’s going to vote for Trump ‘just because’ it’s not Biden?
Joe Biden doesn’t have polices. I’m confused.
A lifelong devout catholic Joe Biden is against the Bible and God and will stop at nothing to hurt them both. How? I don’t know, but it won’t be with guns or energy that’s for sure.
Is Biden gonna punch god? Is that what he’s saying?
I would say Biden has been to church more times in the last year than trump has in his entire lifeUsing Fauci, Gates, Biden, Obama, Kamala, Clinton’s and many, many more to use COVID as a fear monger against the American people! People have lost everything while Blasio killed the elderly cramming ventilators down their throats
The debate over masks has moved to the presidential race.
A declaration of intent is not a confirmation of results, but the point stands that I believe we can hold Biden/Kamala more accountable than Trump by far. You may to disagree, but I made my point clear.
I may not want to vote for you or creepy Joe Biden....but I do want to say sorry that your brother is in the hospital. Hoping for rapid recovery. Light and love.
Who is saying this? I plan on blasting Biden's ass in office (and Kamala!). He's shit and deserves to be held accountable; however, I do think anything is better than Trump so I will support him into office. But yeah, no, this "I know what libtards are gonna do hurr durr" is 😂😂
'Every single American should be wearing a mask when they’re outside for the next three months at a minimum,’ the presumptive Democratic nominee said Thursday. What do you think&gt;&gt;
She is like Mitt Romney. Like the Dems, that live in Seattle. Portland. Chicago. NYC. What does Biden, say come on Jedi
Get Biden and Harris elected, and then drag them to the Left kicking and screaming.
Before y’all say Biden is gross too, we know. The sad part is they’re both bad, but unfortunately he’s the lesser of two evils, and at least he doesn’t lust about his daughter.
Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden and his newly chosen running mate Kamala Harris campaigned together for the first time Wednesday. Here’s more&gt;&gt;
This Biden Harris announcement was not worth waiting 2 hours on. Total puke fest. Just a hint of things to come. Pandering racism medicare for all orange man bad. Going to be a great next 3 months.
The only ones that believe Biden and Harris are Far Left Socialists are Right Wingnuts.
All these celebrities have a lot to say about Biden &amp; kamala, but what about the elite pedophile ring? Or all the children that are going missing every single day? Where’s the concern about that? They’re just proving we have no reason to look up to them.
Vote for Biden then drag him and Harris to the Left kicking and screaming if necessary.
Let’s demand that the media tells about the pedophilia &amp; sex trafficking that happens every day Let’s demand that you &amp; other celebrities stop choosing to believe certain accusations &amp; not others How much of an uproar did Hollywood make about judge kavanaugh, but u endorse Biden
Hidin’ Joe Biden asked Phony Kamala Harris to join his failing Presidential campaign. The radical left is pushing Joe around and President Trump is standing up for America. Keep America Great!
Just when you thought the Biden campaign couldn’t possibly get any worse.
1. Biden said he wants to lock up all anarchists  2. Baby I’m an anarchist  3. Harris denied aid to trans women in prison  4. I’m a trans woman  5. Uh oh
How could anyone in their right mind think Joe Biden and Kamala Harris are fit to run our country? Mindblowing.
I love the Kamala pic but Biden could have picked potato salad with raisins in it and I’d still be excited about voting Trump out of office.
The problem with this statement is that America deserves better than Jack the Ripper. We also deserve better than Biden/Harris. Settling for less will always give us less and right now we need a whole lot.
Okay so can we agree Biden 2020 and Ocasio-Cortez 2028??
They aren’t saying Kamala shouldn’t accept they’re saying Biden shouldn’t have picked a prosecutor during the largest ever movement for police reform.
Biden selects K. Harris as running-mate. #Election2020
I’m not a fan of Joe Biden, but I AM HERE FOR KAMALA!!! 💙
BREAKING:
BREAKING: Joe Biden just lost the election 😂😂😂😂
Apparently Joe Biden still has enough of his mind left to not pick this disaster of a human being.
We NEED Joe Biden AND a Blue Senate and House to help us recover and move forward as ONE!
Joe Biden literally said that all black people are the same and think the same and that if you don't vote for him "you ain't black." Democrats think they OWN black votes...which shouldn't be surprising coming from the party that was pro-slavery.
I won’t enthusiastically vote for Biden. I will hold my nose and do so reluctantly and in protest as I believe the DNC has screwed Bernie twice now.
Where did I claim Biden was a “devout man of God”? I didn’t. The only points I raised were in response to things Trump said and did and nothing else. Trump claimed he was and his actions do not reflect this statement. He also claims to hate polls while bragging on their results.
Raise your hand if he’s better than Biden
We can't let corrupt Joe Biden destroy America.
You are absolutely insane. Your own Biden Obama administration ruled this was an assault on the officer. You again showed your lifelong racism towards black Americans this week and now at trying to stir up division again. Truly despicable.
As a republican I’m not a fan of Trump, but I’m REALLY not a fan of Biden, plus trump is funny so. Trump&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Biden
🤣🤣 Biden needs a nursing home.!
This is not white people! This is crazy Biden who has always talked down to other cultures, especially Black he, Pelosi and the Democrats HAVE NEVER done anything for any USA citizen. He’s a Pedo. You would have to be really crazy to vote Biden!
I feel like you went “all in” today with a king high flush and heard “call” and the republicans turned over the nut flush. Literally Biden hiding in a basement trying not to mess up this election. While you and Schumer got Trump re-elected this week
Well I personally try not to get to involved in politics, but from what it seems, Joe Biden is constantly rambling and doesn’t seem like he knows what he is talking about, honestly I don’t think Trump is much better at all, but he is better imo. Thank you for asking respectfully!
As a republican, I do believe Trump would run this country better than Biden, but I do not believe that either are great leaders at all
Pro-Trump bubble? 😂😂 The reality is that the government party you are applauding is the same party that sells aborted babies. Oh, my how does that work seeing as Biden is Catholic and all.  Christian? But you are okay with that.? Hypocrite much? 🤷🏻‍♀️
Why don’t you guys call up Schumer and Pelosi and let them know that if they don’t get this stimulus deal passed. Then all these ads and all the time you spent helping Biden won’t be worth a hill of beans come November.
The working-class will vote for Trump the Moochers of America will vote for Biden
Biden probably does not want to debate because there is a lack of adult diapers.
That's why they call him hiden Biden
The liberals are using the unemployed as a bargaining chip to get funding for their states. That’s the 100% truth to the matter. They aren’t negotiating. They are sticking to their position. Where is Biden? Where is anyone besides Pelosi and Schumer. They have miscalculated
We need a movement that shakes the ROOTS of AMERICA! Biden 2020!!
If you want my vote Joe Biden you got a couple hours to get a hold of Schumer and Pelosi and figure out why they refuse to make concessions to get a deal done. Figure out why they cost my family $1200 in the last 2 weeks by not accepting the UI extension. They are costing you.
The democrats cost Biden the WH and they cost themselves a majority in the senate by not passing UI extension
Biden losing votes. Why won’t the democrats negotiate? Why have they refused 2 1 week extension to the UI. Where’s Biden? Why doesn’t he tell Pelosi and Schumer to cut back the wish list and get a deal done before it cost Biden the election. Y’all know how many swing votes on UI?
Schumer and Pelosi cost a lot of struggling people $1200 the last 2 weeks because they didn’t except the UI extension. I was totally prepared to vote for Biden but I’m not anymore.
Obama took Christ out. Nancy doesn't want it back in.!! Nor does Biden.!
She’s not doing Biden any favors by handing Trump the unemployed vote when he issues executive order on UI
I’ve got to say, the Joe Biden campaign has exceeded expectations
Fact. Socialists, atheists and Marxist’s coalitions support Biden.I would never vote for Biden or Harris!
They are still saying Biden leads Trump by 7. That is so hard for me to believe! I can't imagine that there is anyone who cares that little for America, but then I know a lot of Dems who seem to hate her! TRUMP 2020! VOTE RED ON NOV 3!
Bless Biden's heart, he only knows what his puppet masters know!
She's intelligent and cares about the  people of this country.  Hope you vote Biden-Harris 2020.
YES!  Fired up, ready to go vote the liar out and put Joe Biden in the White House!
Kamala Harris you were excellent today!  I contributed yesterday and today, and will work harder to do more.  You and Joe Biden are what the U.S. needs.  Don't let haters get in your head. LAUGH!, cause you are in theirs!
Yep!! Biden-Harris 2020!
KAMALA SAID: DO SOMETHING! I say: LET'S ALL VOTE BIDEN-HARRIS 2020!
I don’t care for Biden either but I’m damn sure not letting that dumb ass orange sit in office again
Excepting re-election campaigns? I mean, Gore ‘96, Biden ‘08, etc.
I just can’t vote for a baby killer. Plus i think principle and practicality need to be observed simultaneously. The lesser of 2 evils is not always a bad thing. We all know Jo has no chance. Trump is better than Biden.
So... Khamala openly said that she believes the rape accusers of Biden. Why would she get on a ticket with someone whom she believes to be a rapist? #landslide2020
Kamala Harris. Name some things that Joe Biden has done over the last 50 years to show he is fighting for us! That is a long long time and I can't think of even one!
I thought you had lost your mind for a moment. There will be no Biden-Harris Adm.
Truth is we have super shitty choices for the top two candidates. But, everyone that is ‘for’ Biden as a candidate, is all about whataboutisms. Nobody is voting FOR Biden, they are voting against Trump. That is dangerous.
Joe Biden announces  as his pick for VP running mate.
VP Kamala. Way to go Joe!    I picked the ⁦⁦ win two years before the 2016 election.   Now I’m calling for a double digit win for him this year. (Actually predicted it back in the spring.)
I'm on board!!!! BIDEN-HARRIS 2020! AND READY TO GET THAT LIAR Trump OUT OF THE WHITE HOUSE! VOTE BIDEN-HARRIS 2020!
Biden selects California Sen. Kamala Harris as running mate
So, a tweet announces Biden's pick? I find this very strange! Is Biden not able to even announce his running mate? I am very confused!!! VOTE RED ON NOV 3! TRUMP 2020!
Nope, Kamala Harris was just announced but not by Biden. .......strange!
Joe Biden hardest hit.
I honestly can’t tell whether you’re talking about Trump or Biden. I’m guessing Trump because it sounds like you want it to continue, but everything you’re saying also applies to Biden.
I like how you slithered in this conversation Trump supporter. Your guy is an open White Supremacist Racist. Joe Biden is definitely better than him. Any day of the week!
Biden apparently doesn’t think so:"The Q &amp; A period is useless if no one ever dares to ask real questions."  True, just like all of Biden's pressers - USELESS.
Many people are saying that Judge Pirro is full of shit. Including her fake news colleagues.
More accurately it’s Harris/Jill Biden, Soros, Pelosi, AOC, Waters, Schumer, Nadler,
from  "Acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf told me in an interview for Axios on HBO that he 'would be concerned' about a President Biden."  And well he should be, because  will tell him "You're fired."
Regardless of whatever policies Biden is able to get approved
I realize. And Huckabee goes on air and questions Biden “as a man of faith” There is not a word to describe how inside out and upside down this world is
It would be nice to ask Biden to clarify. Did anyone do that or did they just nodded their head?
Fuck this election. Fuck Joe Biden. Fuck Trump.  #GeneralStrike #NewConstitution #DirectDemocracy
Fuck this election. Fuck Joe Biden. Fuck Trump.  #GeneralStrike #NewConstitution #DirectDemocracy
Does Biden wear a mask in the basement?  What an absolute joke!!!!
In general yes, but Biden is not mentally fit to lead in this instance which increases the importance of the VP choice. Biden and Harris couldn’t have been more different on the left, obviously the point for demographics...
Mike Milbury is the Joe Biden of NHL commentary.
So exactly what Biden &amp; Harris did yesterday? Prepared speeches attacking their opponents. It’s called campaigning.
What? How? When? Biden is not in charge. Where is the GOP that cared about it’s citizens and were once financial conservatives?
"Today, Israel and the United Arab Emirates have taken a historic step to bridge the deep divides of the Middle East." Joe Biden said. "The UAE's offer to publicly recognize the State of Israel is a welcome, brave, and badly-needed act of statesmanship."
Fox News host baselessly claims that 'something's going to happen' to Joe Biden, forcing her colleague to walk her comment back  via
is helping Trump all it can by reporting Trump's talks and scarcely mentioning Biden.  Congress is helping Trump by failing to pass legislation to protect national security. The Senate confirms every judge that will permit Trump to live the life of a criminal dictator.
Yeah, it's all "so confusing".  Joe Biden is calling the agreement between Israel and the United Arab Emirates “a historic step to bridge the deep divides of the Middle East.”  “a welcome, brave, and badly-needed act of statesmanship”
Joe Biden is calling the agreement between Israel and the United Arab Emirates “a historic step to bridge the deep divides of the Middle East.”  “a welcome, brave, and badly-needed act of statesmanship”
So you're saying the media &amp; Biden are all wrong about UAE?  Biden is calling the agreement between Israel &amp; the United Arab Emirates “a historic step to bridge the deep divides of the Middle East.” “a welcome, brave, &amp; badly-needed act of statesmanship”
Nothing could be worse for the stock market or the economy than Trump has been! #Fake If Biden wins, get ready for Trump to punish America #SmartNews

We need someone to take charge! This should have been mandated at the Federal level months ago.  Biden calls for mandate requiring all Americans to wear masks  #FoxNews
When the #MobBoss speaks  covers his every word.  When VP Biden speaks, they mention in passing that he has spoken, but other than a still picture, no coverage.  This is obviously one-sided coverage similar to 2016.

Pro-tip for those of you apolitical people out there: you can go to your twitter settings and mute certain words (ie Biden, Trump, Kamala, Pence) for a set duration of time and you won’t see them on your timeline! Problem mostly solved 😎
Since none of his buddies went to the funeral seems sad they are using his account. RIP Herman Cain. Twitter Account Attacks Joe Biden and Kamala Harris From Beyond the Grave #SmartNews
My guy, no matter what side you vote, this is a horrible choice for the VP... do some research on her policy ideas and tell me you want to live in a country with her policies in place. Because ultimately if Biden is elected, she is in command.
Since I oppose war pig Biden &amp; his cop sidekick, I get attacked for having "white privelege".   Biden led the murder of a million brown Iraqis.  Ignoring his imperialistic mass murder is American privilege.
Then we have this, Biden with Byrd, great friends with former KKK member!! 🤔🤔
Jan 22nd, 2021, an independent prosecutor must be appointed to investigate the Trump administration and the members of the Republican Party that enriched themselves.  Biden must stay out of it so it doesn't look like or become a political retribution investigation.
I really wish that Biden/Harris would emphasize Trump admn management of the pandemic and the tax cuts for the 1% - these 2 issues alone would get them elected!!!
Can somebody please tell sycophantic Barbie  that Joe Biden and Kamala Harris aren’t in power yet.
Love how Kamala refers to Trump as “Trump” and calls him out for his lack of leadership.   Joe Biden, Kamala Harris appear together as running mates for first time Watch live: Joe Biden, Kamala Harris appear together as running mates for first time
Everyone who thinks Joe Biden is not mentally “all there” should go watch the speech he gave this evening introducing Kamala. Powerful speech delivered flawlessly and followed with a strong, inspiring speech from  Excited to watch this election play out.
You’re telling me that we have no better options than Biden/Kamala and Trump/Pence?   Also, abolish our for profit prison and criminal justice systems.
Great line: “Kamala Harris: For the People”
I honestly don't think Biden would finish his term if elected POTUS. I believe that's one of the reasons he took longer than anyone in history to announce his VP choice: they had to vet them more than normal.  Also, he's said as much himself. 3:45 mark
So does my wife and she is 100% for Biden/Harris.  This is a really stupid argument.
Biden has substantial leads in multiple swing states Clinton lost in 2016. Nothing perfectly certain, but unless big improvement for Trump by September, he WILL lose.
Since Joe Biden or Al Gore 😑
yeah they both evil but don't even act like Biden is on the same level of evil as trump.
For years  political writer for  has assigned arrows (up or down) to political figures. He offers his latest arrows for President Trump, former Vice-President Biden and Gov.  Hutchinson.
it's ok if you don't like Biden and Harris. you can bitch with like minded people. but if they're going to win, you need to vote and you need to keep your grievances to a minimum. they get shredded by the right every day ......it's fuck trump, and they're our only way out rn.
Yeah, Biden is so damn good that he's been in Congress for over 30+ years &amp; the VP as 8yrs and we still have (according to the Left): systemic racism white supremacy police brutality illegal immigration expanded the never ending wars  Awesome!
See this shit is why I don't like her, Biden I can deal with he's going to go do old white men shit. Obvious and easy to lean into. She's too much of a contrarian republican wet dream. I really wish he'd have picked Warren, fuck the optics and obvious black-pander with this one.
The best argument I have heard for Biden is he would be better to protest against.  Imperialist oligarchy demands low standards.
It infuriates me that Biden showing empathy and humility is seen as a flaw.
I don't post political issues, however the decision to select Kamala Harris as Bidens VP pick is going to eat at Trump like a chain saw cutting through a tree! Get registered, let your voice be heard and VOTE!!! BIDEN/HARRIS 2020!
All I can say about the ‘Biden / Harris’ ticket is... #TrumpPence2020 🇺🇸  We need a #RedTsunamiAcrossAmerica🇺🇸
Anyone else’s berner friends pissed about the VP nomination and think that Biden has lost the election because of it?
Yes, I'm familiar with how hard biden has screwed poc communities, and how much of a fucking bungler Harris is. I think we need to burn a federal building for every home stolen and flip a cop car for every family forced to live in their ride thanks to her letting the Nooch slip.
Regardless of how you feel about Kamala, don’t let that keep you from voting in November. Not voting for Biden is voting for Trump.
If you love America and love your rights as a citizen of the United States of America,  you cannot allow the leftist and socialist party win this election.  God forbid!!! Biden and Harris are evil.  Destruction of America would be inevitable!🙏🏼🇺🇸
Enemy from within, just like Biden!!!
Biden/Harris ?  Seriously?  What a disaster for America!!! Wake up, America!   God bless America and not allow evil leaders to rule this country!!! 🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼
I could vote for Biden/Harris if I didn't pledge my voice to Iraq War Orphans &amp; Occupied Palestinians.
no one is saying trump is better???sure he’s worse but that’s not gonna make me pretend that kamala &amp; biden aren’t both terrible people
To be fair, the mass uprisings are against exactly the kind of policies Biden has instituted throughout his political career as well.  They twinkies, yo
People are dying, yea, and war criminal Biden led the killing of a million iraqis. So what's your point?
The words "by now" are journalistic malpractice.  War criminal Biden  has always been committed to right wing neoliberal imperialism
Broke:  staying home bc you think biden/Harris is meh or bad  Woke:  doubling down on your involvement and advocacy, getting the white nationalists out of the White House, and organizing to hold the Democratic Party accountable if it gains power
Would be nice to see the memo to see what it says.  Democratic Party sets rules for criticizing Biden’s VP pick Kamala Harris -  -
Ok, for real, aside from 'literally anyone else' why Biden?
And he has explained that this cartoon has been on his desk for decades to remind himself that other people are going through a lot worse than you are at any given moment.
Donald Trump tries to destroy women who stand up to him. Joe Biden chose one to be his Vice President.
Trump calling anyone phony is a hypocrisy of gargantuan proportions. The fraud in chief has so many fraud charges against him Twitter would have to allow 5-8 full pages just to list them.  is a fraud, phony, liar, just to name a few. He is done! Biden/Harris 2020
BTW, there are no pint glasses available in the Biden/Harris online store.

it would be a better ticket if Joe Biden were her running mate...no one votes for the "great running mate"
Hours ago, VP Biden asking Sen Harris to join the ticket. Incredible image.  Also if you zoom in Biden’s phone looks like it’s been through hell and that is *so* relatable
This is the VP choice of a confident candidate, and campaign, who believe they are winning. And who believe that Biden will be sworn in as the 46th president. Here's why Joe Biden chose Kamala Harris as his VP - CNNPolitics
Outstanding choice. Smart, intelligent, great partner for Joe Biden.

hey where is the periscope about joe biden vp pick you said you would do one immediately if it was harris. You were right as hell dude.
Joe Biden just won the election by bringing Kamala Harris on board. I absolutely love her. #KamalaHarrisForVP
I just helped plan my 30th 2 years ago done ✅ won’t do another back to Biden/Harris
If you can’t get behind Biden, get behind Harris. If you can’t get behind Harris, get behind your vulnerable neighbor.  Trump is a colossal failure. We sent among the worst of us to govern us. He must be removed in November. We are poorer, sicker, more endangered than 4 years ago

I can't imagine a ticket I'd be less excited about than a Biden/Harris ticket.
That damned Joe Biden store just ate up my allowance for the month.
Biden chose Harris cause he likes Maya Rudolf more than Kate McKinnon.
Biden picks Sen. Kamala Harris as running mate  via
This is the first time a Black woman has been selected for the position #NWArk #NWAnews
Really proud of the Biden campaign. They’re serious about winning.   Biden/Harris 2020
Geez Literally anyone could be a better option than Biden/Harris . Used to be a proud democrat now don’t even know if i can vote 🤢
Biden selects California Sen. Kamala Harris as running mate
The Joe Biden store just got my monthly allowance and I'm all for it. The way the checkout was pausing I think a lot of people had the same idea.
I just ha e to believe, she and Biden taked much during this whole process. There is a plan.  is integral to that plan.
The Harris pick tells me the Biden campaign is serious about winning.   Which is something I haven’t felt from our national party in a long time.
“I can't wait to watch Mike Pence debate Kamala Harris“  VP debates mean...nothing.  It’s the Biden-Trump debates that carry weight: POTUS  I don’t think the debates will happen. I think Democrats will back out to protect Biden’s image. I hope I’m wrong. Very wrong. We’ll see.
Same here. WHEN Biden/Harris win the election, the floodgates will open! 😭
I am officially excited about something since the last election. Biden/Harris 2020! Let’s elect them in November!
President Biden. Vice President Harris. Senate Majority Leader Warren.
Today is a win for Black women!! Congrats Senator Kamala Harris on Biden's Vice President running mate selection!!! ✊🏼✊🏽✊🏾✊🏿
‼️BREAKING:  announces  as his running mate for the #2020presidentialelection.   #NWAnews
Lol all of sudden I care again. Biden Harris 2020
i know, what a time for Joe Biden to sneak in that VP announcement…
Atp Im not even anticipating who Biden’s VP pick will be. I’ve waited too long to find out. I’ll just roll with whoever he (DNC) chooses 🤷🏾‍♂️
I’m voting For Biden so we can give this shit up
I was the same, I fully understand wanting a more progressive candidate, but if you are sick of what's happening in America then you need to be ridin with Biden.
I saw reports of Kamala unfollowed Biden on Twitter.
Everyone always asks who Biden's VP pick is. Nobody ever asks how Biden's VP pick is. 😥
How anti-climatic will it be if the US gets its first woman President because Biden wins and at some point has to resign due to health concerns? (I get that he's perfectly healthy for 78, but its a valid hypothetical)
Poll: Biden maintains 10-point national lead over Trump
About the only time  and  ever mention VP Biden is when they are reporting what nasty, lying thing Trump says about him.
And that is EXACTLY what I tell those who aren't big Biden fans: It is whom he will choose to be cabinet heads, to be advisors, to be researchers, etc. that I am voting for. So far, they seem to buy it!
A theory: Biden decided on her months ago but went through the process of meeting others because he wanted to be absolutely sure, and because the campaign wanted to misdirect everyone. She’s been too conspicuously absent from the conversation since nearly its beginning.
I have learned that Joe Biden’s pick is exactly the person you thought it would be and when it’s announced you should either be incredibly excited or neutral about it, but in no way disappointed because honestly who needs that right now?
If Biden wins Arkansas, I may run 🏃‍♀️ down the street screaming!
Y’all are actually voting for Biden? LMAOO
"the biden's vp pick" i'm so excited by the scoop i can't even type properly
I KNOW WHO THE BIDEN'S VP PICK IS  it's the girl reading this ❤️
I just searched biden______.com for most running mate combinations. No dice.
Biden will lose... by a lot. The dems destroying of America will end up destroying the chance to win. All the dems had to do was stay out of their own way...they couldn’t do it and it will cost them the election. It’s a shame
Biden will lose...by a lot. You can thank Antifa and BLM for your downfall.  Americans will not stand for Dems burning America to the ground. The hard truth is about the slap you across the forehead on Nov 3rd
The next VP must be a Black woman. Because the next president after POTUS Biden must be a Black woman.
Not a trump supporter. They are both clowns, the thought of Biden letting the convicts run and burn the country to the ground is unsettling. Democratic mayors and governors casted my vote. Unlike you, I’m able to swing either way without a bias position
Not one single thing in your left leaning article did it reference anything about race. Want to brush yourself off and take another swing at it?   Below specifically refers to race though oooooofffff! Talk about sticking your foot in your mouth 🤦
That statement doesn’t refer to race whatsoever. U want to brush yourself off and take another swing at it?  PS. Never said anything about Biden molesting children, we do however, have video/photos of Biden being very creepy around children
No way Biden wins. You gotta really hate America to vote for a joker who stands by and watches his people burn America. Oh and she says hi 👋  😂😂😂
I'll start watching them again after they institute the daily  Biden conferences.
Mask vs no mask   Fall sports vs no Fall sports   Virtual school vs traditional school  Trump vs Biden   Man everyone is assembling like this with their people or crew depending on what side your on. Going to he an epic showdown in the coming weeks and months.
We own one. Joe Biden owns the other
Do I think Biden will win if we work our asses off? yes. Do I think Trump will definitely win if we don’t? Yes. Can trump win by stealing the election, even if we work our asses off? Yes.
That really been my argument the whole time tho man. In relation to the Biden tweet. AA are disproportionately treated differently by police and I feel that is undisputable. But ya boy just got to work. Gonna have to carry this convo on later on
Joe Biden is proposing a federal Tax Credit Scholarship that would be even larger than the one championed by Donald Trump &amp; Betsy DeVos. Among other things, Biden's proposal would help lower-income families participate in education "pandemic pods" #SchoolChoiceBiddingWar
President Joe Biden, Vice President Daenerys Stormborn “Breaker of Chains, Mother of Dragons” Targaryen sounds very good to me personally
it’s absolutely hilarious that people think Joe Biden is anywhere near being a radical liberal
After Biden is inaugurated, I vote we cut bait on each &amp; every one of them. I am just sick to death of ignorance.
Obama alumni message boards buzzing with rumor that Joe Biden has inquired about whether “the gal with the dragons from the television, you know the one” was eligible to run as his VP.
Is ANYONE else even remotely bothered by the fact that Biden's VP running mate will be selected based on their sex and their skin color?   Just curious.   Sounds like the most racist &amp; sexist criteria on earth to me. 🤷   opinion
Biden is not bite, he is just a political lever to use in the long process of unfucking the things trump fucked up. Tool, not solution.
"Replacing Trump with Biden is like shitting your pants and then changing your shirt."
Is it true Joe Biden is set to name Bob Vance (Vance Refrigeration) as his running mate???
You forget Biden was VP when that administration did it. It survived
I'm thinking it was telling her not to siphon off votes from Biden.
Biden should just challenge Trump to a 3 mile walk. Honestly don't know if Trump has walked that far in years. It really requires Trumpian hubris to go after Biden as somehow being senile and infirm. Trump must be looking at himself in funhouse mirror.
Screaming the following into the void:  Trump *will* break laws to steal this election. Trump *will* drive the post office into the ground to steal this election.  Trump *is* working woth foreign powers to spread disinformation about Joe Biden.  1/x
Reporters writing their 20th headline this week about Biden's possible pick for VP.   THIS IS IT! HE'S ALMOST READY, GUYS!
Y’all need some patience, re: Joe Biden’s running mate.
The thought that any and all 45 has done thus far could be taken as precedent is enough to drive us to despair.  I'm very glad you weren't thinking Biden could be as low. Sorry for snarling!
You can bet  and  will carry every word of it then talk about it all day.  Joe Biden?  Who's he?  Very lopsided coverage, just like 2016.
What a brainwashed approach... did you not hear the interview where Biden said black people all think alike?? He represents just as much ignorance as Trump or worse because he doesn’t have the cognitive ability to lead the country. We need to expand outside of the two parties
Putin, Russia, Joe Biden, and the specific word denigrate. Been seeing these keywords in tweets a lot today. You a bit dude or just a shill?
I fuckin love your Biden artwork!  Please do the Donald too for balance &amp; to show just how shitty the 2 Corporate Imperialist "choices" truly are.  As Assange said of Hillary vs. Trump, "it's a choice between cholera &amp; malaria."
Arkansas won’t win any games this year. Won’t lose any either. Ain’t nobody playing football. Ain’t none of us having any fun until Joe Biden is the President of the United States
Is it true Joe Biden just announced that his running mate would be — and I’m quoting directly here — a “boss-ass ‘64 GTO with the Tri-Power carb”???
I don’t think trump or Biden should be running the country. Biden has been saying the whole time he needs a VP who can be POTUS day one. Obviously something is off with Joe. I don’t see him finishing a term &amp; Trump, I have a long list of reasons why I can’t get down with him. Ha
Why Joe Biden and Kamala Harris would be a disastrous duo in the year of George Floyd #SmartNews they are the #PerfectDuoInTheYearOfFloyd!!!!!! 🤬
I havent heard Biden say any of that &amp; I watch multiple news outlets every day. Biden is actually moderate &amp; doesnt push socialism like youre saying. Will he conform to the new left, thats TBD but I hope he doesnt go extreme bc he doesnt need to for success in the election.
Virginia mayor urged to resign after saying Biden picked ‘Aunt Jemima’ as his running mate  via
This straight white Democrat agrees with you. I’ll sulk if it’s not Harris but I’m still doing everything I can to get Biden in.
Our biggest #threat is Trump  ⁦ US officials: Russia denigrating Biden ahead of election #SmartNews
DON'T FALL FOR THE SCAM!  China wants Trump reelected.  They know the best way to help him is to make you believe they want Biden.  Don't be fooled!
Got a huge tip about who Joe Biden is picking as his VP and let me tell you:  you get a VP and you get a VP and you get a VP too.
Can you also explain away the Biden comment: “You’ve got more questions?' Biden replied. 'Well I tell you what, if you have a problem figuring out whether you’re for me or Trump, then you ain’t black.”
‘Sit down’: Trump buried in mockery and scorn for claiming Biden ‘no longer worthy of the Black Vote’ #SmartNews that and wants to take away GOD as a practicing Catholic! This guy just gets NOTHING right
Hearing that Joe Biden is set to announce his VP at a time on a day.
Rose is red flag. Russian bots or malignant violent agitators possibly even agent provocateur. The hateful transparent lies about Biden are dead giveaway. They want Stalin, Mao or Pol Pot. Few if any grasp democratic socialism. I trust neither Trumpkins or fanatics.
The only person who has actually taken away anything weapons related in almost 30 years was your bitch ass.  Biden sucks but anyone who thinks Trump‘s pro 2A are fudd cucks who probably use .45 acp rounds as butt plugs
It doesn’t matter they would attack any qualified person who Biden picks. Susan Rice brings needed stability to our Foreign Policy.
All VP wannabes have baggage. I've never been one for purity tests, even less so this cycle. If it's Biden-Rice, I'll proudly stick in a yard sign &amp; slap on a bumper sticker. YMMV
Biden is the one w cognitive issues tho right?
Go read my original statement, I’m not a Biden fan, I just hate Trump way more. I know the DNC fucked everything up BUT I still don’t want Trump
In the basement with Biden😎
He forgot which button unlocks the door. Dr.Biden is abusing her husband? Someone call SENIOR PROTECTION AGENCY! QUID PRO QUO JOE is the Man in front of the Mask, not behind.  DIMocrat SOCIALIST Party is BEHIND THE MASK OF JOE BIDEN'S CANDIDACY! Are there keys in the ignition?
Joe Biden is literally as Catholic as any human being can be
Trump has proved he’s not it, Biden probably isn’t either but it’s his turn
Would love some Biden/Trump polling crosstabs on people who reuse plastic deli meat containers.
Biden literally doesn’t support a single thing on the list💀 I would love to get like at least 3 of these
I’m sad to say that people stick with parties and Trump is definitely not it and if Biden doesn’t win then Trump will, so take you pick if your not sold on either but me I’d rather have four years of Biden then four more years of Trump
If I hear... "C/Mon Man" one more time from Biden...
Vote Biden. I don't work for you! C'mon man!! #BidenCampaignSlogans
“Well I tell you what, If you have a problem figuring out whether you're for me or Trump, then you ain't black.”
“Well I tell you what, If you have a problem figuring out whether you're for me or Trump, then you ain't black.”
I agree. This is an election that is literally  freedom vs slavery. If Biden wins we lose everything. He basically gives away they keys to the store day one. Who does he give the keys too tho? Special interest? NGO's? Rothschild? It's the most important election ever.
Ah yes.   Devout, still practicing, Catholic Joe Biden will hurt God, not the *checks notes* thrice married billionaire (still under review) who cheated on every one of wives.   Makes sense.
Y’all watch Joe Biden disrespect black people every other week and still gonna vote for him
It means Biden should not be POTUS.
Really don't care who Biden picks for VP, only that he wins. The suburban kommunist' kidz' Klub Marxist-ME-ME-ME-MEist brigade can spare me their "demands". There are many critical issues requiring attention (a pandemic for instance) that affect everyone.
"Yes, yes," Biden responded. "And by the way, what you all know, but most people don’t know, unlike the African American community, with notable exceptions, the Latino community is an incredibly diverse community with incredibly different attitudes about different things.”
Pretty low to use a newspaper photo expressly against their wishes in a political ad.
Oops you mistakenly used Biden ‘s name where trump’s name should go.We are witnessing the methodical dismantling of the Deep-State Obama/Biden/Clinton Criminal, Trafficking, and Pedophilia ring! #ObamaBidenClintonGate 🍿🥤
can’t wait to see joe biden’s reaction when he finds out he picked kamala harris
Vernon is spot on!  Biden &amp; Harris’ record with black/ brown Americans is horrendous!
Vote for Biden!
The choice is crystal clear: Trump = God, Faith &amp; Religious Freedom 🙏🏻🇺🇸  Biden = Remove God, Late-Term Abortion, No Police, Open Borders, Payments to Illegals, High Taxes.....
Biden &amp; Harris are Deep-State tyrants.  They are proven, verified, criminals from the Obama/Biden/Clinton Trafficking/ Pedophilia ring.
Kamala Harris is just another desperate, sick, Epsteiner.  She is a product of the Obama/Biden/Clinton criminal regime.
So I’m a child r*ape survivor and I am disappointed with fellow leftists, who preach all about mental health, attacking people who won’t vote for Biden on the basis of “harm reduction”.  I won’t vote at all if I try to vote Biden. I will have a panic attack in the parking lot.
And Joe Biden is trying to give credit for that to Obama!😂😂
Another truth...I just can not fathom why anyone can't see how well this President is conducting business for the American people! Perfect, no but still better than anything Biden ticket can bring!
Is it a wasted vote if you don’t vote for Biden? Please explain your side after you choose!
Franklin Graham warns Biden-Harris ticket ‘should be a great concern to all Christians’ - Fox News  via
If the Kanye West campaign is some not-so-secret plot to steal votes from Biden, why did he bother getting ballot access in Arkansas and Oklahoma?
I know the feeling it's crazy but unfortunately some of us is still in love with Obama. We are getting shame for not wanting to support Biden and Karma Sutra Harris.
Trump is coool! Nasty Pelosi will not be a goid president. That’s what will happen if Biden/Harris get elected!
And knocked Biden off snd Harris up!😂😂
It gets worst if a Black Man criticize Kamal Harris on her record alone, we are labeled a Misogynist. I called one bc I've been going in and refusing to support the Biden/Kamala ticket.
Me: we gotta vote for Biden. It sucks. But it is what it is right now.   Y’all: But what about...   Me: SHUT THE FUCK UP
Sen Harris, do you still believe the women who say Former VP Biden did something inappropriate to them?Do they still deserve to be heard? Like when you accused Justice Kavanaugh of inappropriate behavior? Or is this a case of #doublestandard #justwondering
Joe Biden is a 50-year corrupt, career, politician and a stone cold crook.
Harris is just another Obama/Biden/Clinton Cabal crook.
This presidency has been such an unconventional one. Plus Biden will come with a more &gt;&gt; progressive cabinet &lt;&lt; That’s so important. Plus I was talking to another PS friend and we think ppl have been so desensitized to the horror that has been this fucking presidency
Anyway, no one is saying that Biden is the optimal choice. In a perfect world, we could go third party &amp; say fuck these two old hags but that isn’t realistic. Is Biden problematic? Yes. But you have to take into account that Biden is not going to have all the leeway trump had —&gt;
This...this is y’all’s Presidential candidate? I know Biden isn’t much better but come on
Many of us live in states that have zero chance of breaking for biden, many others live in states that have zero chance of going to Trump.  I live in Arkansas the only way I can definitely waste my vote is to cast it for Biden. At least voting third party gives my vote meaning.
Maybe Biden should... he is the nominee
Americans: Defund the police!  Biden: *runs with a cop*
And that's where we get into a very grey area.  Some priests still allow Biden to participate in Mass and take Communion. Then there are some that don't, like you've pointed out.
Technically, Biden IS a Catholic.  This is totally different than saying he is in Communion with the Catholic Church.   Most non Catholics probably don't understand the difference.
It’s SO SO much bigger than not liking Biden and/or Kamala...it’s about children in cages, it’s about the future of title ix, it’s about funding for HBCU’s, it’s about reproductive rights, it’s about the future of the USSC for the rest of our LIFETIMES. 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
✝️ 🙏🏼 abiding with Biden 🙏🏼 ✝️
Trying to figure out what the Biden camp is thinking.   Maybe they see a ground swell of push back against the protests going on across the country.  We'll restore "law and order".  It will play well with moderates on both sides.
Uhhhh, not that it matters, but I thought Biden was catholic.
Because Biden definitely isn't here cognitively for anything that taxing, kinda like the presidency itself...
Up thinking about this Biden-Harris ticket. So many non-Republican college students I know backed Elizabeth or Bernie. How are y'all feeling about Kamala as VP?
Whewweeeeeeee!  It's 1am, time to get ready for work! Biden and Harris is a great start to my day!  RAWR!!!!!!!!! 🦖  #BidenHarris2020
You really want to run this ad?  Aren’t you worried this will cause your base to vote for Biden? I mean, being a racist is what most of them love you for.  I think about the house I passed today w/ a Confederate flag next to a Trump sign, whatever will they do if they see this 😳
A Biden harris would be a good debate too
Biden picks another racist as his running mate. She locked up so many other blacks with her stupid anti drug laws.
Oh sure I think he just means that enthusiastic Warren supporters are frequently miscast as trenchant members of the party’s left when, for both policy and stylistic reasons, they’re often pretty mainstream. I personally went with Biden over Bernie after Warren dropped out.
Great, a cop... I'm sure that will appeal to... Republicans maybe... just like Biden. But there were definitely better choices. Her record, much like Bidens puts her pretty squarely on the wrong side of history, Btwn his crime bill and her prosecutorial career.
One of the things that infuriates me the most is the spectacle involved in the VP pick (not specifically Harris).  Like, rather than acting like it was a normal thing to pick from only women, y’all sucked Biden off as if he himself granted women liberty
I love how as soon as Biden announced Kamala Harris as his running mate, Maya Rudolph began trending. 😂 We’re ALL ready for those SNL skits!
Yeah, when I think of the radical left I too imagine *checks notes* Joe Biden and Kamala Harris
Mom is back on the ticket, boys and squirrels 😍🙌🏻
Consuming dem media at the moment is exhausting. If you genuinely think Biden will win Texas/Georgia I have beachfront property in Idaho to sell you
Damn, Biden really took like 4 months to pick the VP we all thought he’d pick anyways lmao
What do y’all think about Joe Biden and Kamala Harris?
Given that Biden was chosen by the Obama campaign for particular signalling, the Biden campaign choosing Harris is completely thematically sound.
Joe Biden picked her to be VP
Good thing Joe Biden chose Kamala Harris as his running mate!  We secured California!
I honestly feel like Joe Biden made a mistake picking Kamala as a VP &amp; we just might be stuck with Donald bitch for another 4 years.
If Biden announces his VP pick at 4:20pm I'll die! 🤟🏻
No thanks!!! .....and the Obama/Biden/Clinton cabal would get away with Treason, Sedition, $ Laundering, Human Trafficking, Pedophilia, and Murder just to name a few...
Joe Biden is a 50-year crook and con-man.  VP of the most corrupt, criminal regime in American history.
The Obama/Biden/Clinton criminal cabal was and is the most corrupt, evil, regime in American history.
I mean, they picked Biden to run for president, so....
Would love to hear them sing at Biden’s inauguration!
Chip in to elect Joe Biden and other Democrats on the ballot
Did Biden remember to bring the cookies to you?
What a horrible crock of 💩, Biden oposes a single payer system that would provide universal coverage. The only people benefiting from his plan are insurance companies and prescription drug manufacturers
Straight from Joe Biden’s mouth. #CreepyJoe #QuidProJoe #YouAintBlack
All Obama/Biden/Clinton Criminal Cabal Thugs!!
The media is mum about the massive, exposed Obama/ Biden/ Clinton Trafficking/ Pedophilia ring.
Joe Biden thinks he owns all black voters.  Biden is a stone cold crook.  This thug has gotten ultra-wealthy scamming blacks for 50 years!
Stupidity cubed! Trying  to protect "China Joe" Biden!
Rice, Obama, and Biden are stone cold criminals who belong behind bars for a long, long time.
Biden and Bloomberg both only ran to undermine the Sanders campaign, neither of them care about the welfare the nation.
People: shouldn’t it bother you that Biden is old and not always sharp when speaking publicly?  Me:
Creepy Joe Biden &amp; the entire (Obama/Biden/Clinton) criminal cabal is owned by China 🇨🇳 and Iran 🇮🇷.  They sold their souls to these countries.
Shut down the Obama/Biden/Clinton Trafficking &amp; Pedophilia ring.  It’s gone on way too long!
What a crock of BS, Biden already told the rich and corporations that "nothing will change"... GTFOH with this platitudinal BS.
You know why? Who are the Traffickers? Obama/Biden/Clinton cabal ✅ Hollywood ✅ The Media ✅  Make sense now?
Obama/Biden/Clinton regime ✅ Hollywood ✅ The Media ✅
Biden will have no say in this.  The DNC will hand Creepy Joe a black woman.  You can book it.  They have already caved to the mob....and the infamous ‘Democrat Plantations’ will continue for them.
This $430M will be used to specifically fight the now notorious (Obama/Biden/Clinton Trafficking/ Pedophilia) ring.
Worse comes to worse, Biden fucks us over (kind of like we are now) and we try this again in 4 years 😩😩 I just can’t expect different results from the same situation
Muhfuckas talmbout how can you vote for Biden with the dumb shit he says?! Easy, he’s not Trump!!! 4 years of Trump has me in a desperate state of mind this election
The Obama/Biden/Clinton regime is one big lie. #Treason #Trafficking #Pedos #MoneyLaundering
All funded &amp; coordinated by the Obama/Biden/Clinton DNC.  A regime of Lawless Thugs.
Yes, probably because the only thing that makes Biden a Democrat is the D next to his name because it certainly isn't his record and definitely not his current policy platform
The difference is, and I know it’s hard but try to keep up, what Biden did was ILLEGAL.
Justice please come for Obama/Biden/Clinton criminal, trafficking, and pedo regime
To be fair, Clinton chose Tim Kaine to be her vice, not the other way around. Biden would be the first to choose a woman vice. Reading it the other way is twisting Dowd's words.
Empty platitudes, where are the policies that will let us achieve these goals? How can we have economic equity without criminal justice reform including the end of Marijuana prohibition, and Medicare for all. I don't believe for a second that Biden has plans that move us forward
Joe Biden: "I promise to raise taxes"  Literally
My emotional state is irrelevant. I try to cite facts, whether anyone takes me seriously or not. isn't my concern. Whomever Biden chooses I will defend but some will be easier than others. Some Democrats feel we shouldn't hash out our differences in public. I'm not one of them.
You see, if Biden wore a helmet, he would engage in more risky biking behavior, because of a false sense of security the helmet creates. Maybe he would also wear it incorrectly. Also, there are no good RCTs showing that helmets work.
This is funny that’s all I don’t care how long Biden takes to pick a veep
I'll vote for Camela Harris if Biden picks her, but without going into much detail. I would prefer someone who wasn't a prosecuting attorney. On the plus side I expect she'll use her courtroom lawyering skills to tear Mike Pence  a new one! Unfollow me if you like.

Why not? Let’s hope Durham doesn’t turn out to be a dud.  The evidence against the Obama/Biden/Clinton criminal regime is overwhelming.  #PutTheseCrooksBehindBars
Biden &amp; the radical DNC are exactly the reason why ‘We The People’ need guns.  They want to take away our gun rights, defund all police.  These Democrats are sociopathic.
Joe Biden sounds like he hates blacks, and implies that they are all yellow boxes just the same. He's an old douche for putting all blacks in the same boat. Doesn't matter what race you are in, there are always ppl who have different thoughts.
In today's news, Biden said two extremely racist things 2 days in a row and no one cares, will probably still win 90% of the minority vote.

Joe “Basement” Biden. Will Joe ever come out of hiding?Harris Biden n Obama lie more
The one thing I can not wait for when we have a Biden/Harris administration is the Trump Crime Commission run by AG Glen Kirschner!   Everyone of these criminals and their accomplices need to pay for enabling this crook!
Vote Biden. Don’t repeat your mistake
You can say that again. My stepmom is vehemently anti-Trump and will be voting for Biden and Harris this November. What an asshole. I am so glad I know the truth about  and  and
Why doesn’t Biden take questions. Get him off the TelePrompTer and let’s see him bumble his way.  You are all nothing but traitors. Go away.

this is outrageous! I have donated to the Biden, Harris, BidenHarris campaigns as well as many Senatorial efforts. I have little $. But Bloomberg has never given money promised! AOC instead of him. I’m angry!
I learned from my vote in 2016 which is why I will vote for Biden in 2020.
4) this nonsense, I’ll take and I did take Trump over party, he has looked out for our best interest from day one, he has always loved this country as I do, every democrat I know are dispicable liars just in it for themselves and republicans, VOTE TRUMP!!! Leave the biden trash
1)Why do you think democrats didn’t complain they wanted that knowing it would get worse before elections and hope they could blame Trump, the democrat ticket is a direct result of the corrupt party biden has no chance he admitted he is in it for one term, this all to try and
She’s not a puppet like Biden and Harris
He's far from perfect. He's better than Biden and the Dems.
Wait isn’t Biden choosing Harris a symbol of how Joe DOESN’T prefer personal loyalty over all else? She did attack him during the primary debates.
Of course I voted for Hillary, just like the majority of voters did. And I will vote for Biden, just like the majority of voters will. And no, unlike just an entry on a flight log, I use actual incriminating evidence (video, accusations from victims, quotes from participants).
I will be voting for Biden because Trump is the most dangerous president I’ve seen in my lifetime.
Joe Biden pronounced it the same way....
Biden Harris - Wrong for America.  Trump 2020
I have loved learning from you and if you think Trump is awesome or just ok or needs to be replaced or if Biden is awesome or just ok or should have been Bernie... honestly I just want to get published. And if your work helps me do that, think/post what you want.
You mean where Harris will be speaking. Biden will just stand there and stutter incoherent sentences

I can’t understand how the people who have listened to Ku Klux word salad for the last four years have the fucking audacity to call Biden senile
Journos just making it up as they go along.  Anything to try and stay in that "Biden for Pres" lane.  Goodness.  They have no shame.  Harris isn't a small "c" conservative, that's an absolutely laughable thing to write.  She's a "Big PL", progressive liberal.  What a joke.
Ah you finally caught him!  Now listen to Biden, he is running for US senate!  You missed that didn’t u?   Your guy can’t put two coherent sentences together and Trump runs the world!
I held my nose and voted for Hillary b/c I recognize a narcissistic personality when I see one  This year I'm enthusiastically voting for Joe Biden not only because my initial judgment of Donald Trump was right, but b/c Biden is the right man to heal our country.  #LincolnVoter
My Brit buddy just passed me again and still laughing saying Harris is that all you got, I told him I have Trump the democrats have her, still he said is that all biden and harris hahahaha
Let’s be honest no one even cares about that debate. Trump will be bathing in Biden’s blood by the time it’s all over and Dems will be looking for a replacement. ( which im sure they’re actively already doing )
Biden is currently more likely to win... but it's not guaranteed.
pardon me, FIRST what we’re not gonna do is not manage to elect Biden in 2020 like some of y’all did with Hillary in 2016 just because she doesn’t check every one of your seventy set dream socialist boxes
Joe Biden is Catholic... And crap like this is one of the reasons I no longer am....
With a mindless and ignorant statement criticizing Biden’s pick of Harris as running mate, Tom KKKotton demonstrates his bigotry and incompetence.
Pro-Life vs. Pro-Abortion is a clear choice for America this November. Biden has officially made clear he will not be moderate in his selection of nominees, Harris is radical about abortion.  and Pence are unquestionably the most Pro-Life pick. #Vote
It just doesn't make sense (even if it was just meant as sick burn on Biden), since there wouldn't have been a Catholic on the ticket in 08 and 12 either. And 92, 96, and 00 were also RC-free zones. Bizarre.
How Biden selected Kamala Harris as his running mate
Ummm...Joe Biden blew it for himself, he needs no help for anyone
not voting for joe biden is a vote for trump. idgaf what you say. refusing to not vote for biden bcuz he isn’t bernie is selfish. you might as well be a trump supporter. #BidenHarris2020
doesn’t report the news... therefore Chief’s of No News.  Listened them again today for nearly 2 hours. Zilch about BLM, riots, looting, Seattle, Chicago, NY, Portland, shooting  The White House...only protection of virus fear, Biden and hate of Trump. That’s it!
We believe in Biden-Harris 2020. Let’s kick ass together!
Biden was not my choice. I have really struggled feeling excited about the campaign until now.
I’m so excited!!! More so than with Biden.
Another historical moment....Kamala Harris is Biden’s VP Pick #HBCUMade #ifeelseen 👩🏾 #vote2020 🗳
Top political voices react to Biden picking Kamala Harris as running mate
Let’s be real man Biden had absolutely NOTHING to do with picking Harris
Joe Biden selects California Sen. Kamala Harris as running mate
When I cast my vote in Arkansas for Biden instead of Warren while she is running, that was my exact thought. This is about saving the country....
No thanks. Enjoying the Biden/Harris ticket instead.
Molly are you as confident in a Biden/Trump debate?
Joe Biden did not select her...the Democratic Party did it got him for the reasons you gave and others.
Kamala Harris will be the first Black woman nominated for vice president by a major party. 🎊
If Joe Biden is elected we will have our first female President in Kamala Harris.
Harris Biden ticket has 3 votes from this family!   My republican husband is all in for Biden/Harris!
#BREAKING Joe Biden selects California Sen. Kamala Harris as running mate
I'm ready!  Let's get to it! Biden/Harris 2020
Biden when he was told who his VP pick was
I guess you don't understand Commnism, Marxism.....you will have no freedoms honey when the Democrats get in. Can you list us 10 things Biden has done in the last 40+years....I am waiting...
My entertainment as I drive today? I listened to  for over an hour.  They all LOVE BIDEN and the virus. Can’t believe these people are Americans. I listened &gt; an hour, not one word mentioned about Black Lives Matter, rioting, looting, vandalism, Chicago nor Seattle.
I'm tired of people thinking joe biden will make things better.
Who do YOU think will be Biden's VP?

Oh also.  Does anyone else have about 5 different T-shirt’s waiting in your #Amazon acct ready to order?  Biden/Harris. Biden/rice. Biden/warren Biden/duckworth    Please tell me I’m not the only one #bidenvppick #BidenVPwatch
The debate has been won when I pointed out that Trump and his cultists’ irresponsibility are what are causing the virus to spread and kill. Nobody is dying from Joe Biden’s decision making, just Trump’s.
Breaking: Baby Nut to be announced as Biden's running mate
He NEVER said that!  Open your eyes and ears!  A vote for Biden is to kill America.
Biden Tells Staffers To Pick Any Black Person For VP 'Since They All Think The Same Anyway' | The Babylon Bee
"Biden has permitted his League of Mediocre White Men to run around dinging up a group of trailblazing female politicians, most of them Black, all of whom have plied paths unimaginably more challenging than any taken by these men." --Rebecca Traister
Biden trying to put words in order to tweet this
Ben Sasse wants to help the democrats and biden, I wonder what the democrats have on him
Looking forward to Biden’s VP pick this week!
You made the point of why it’s important. Biden riding his bike while Trump struggles to walk show Biden is in far better “condition.”Just like our economy, country and military will be once we #FireTrump Nov. 3.
Biden is.....
I’m pretty sure Shaun has told people not to vote for Biden on here before. I’d look it up, but he blocked me, so I can’t see any of his tweets anymore :(
I agree. Pelosi, Schumer, Biden should be running ads talking about the Social Security debacle in plain English.  —no more Mr. Nice Guy on this issue.   get off the damn political shows. Get Congressional Dems  on local news!
Hahaha can you imagine Joe Biden coming out in clown shoes?
just finished watching 2016 debate with Killary. Prophetic looking at your achievements the past 4 yrs. Excellence! Coaches watch game films in preparation for battle. As you prepare 4 election reflect &amp; enjoy!  We r behind you, hit Biden hard, if not harder!
Blacks for Trump. Women for Trump. Latinos for Trump. Trump is so polarizing and sexist and racist that the pro-Trump minority factions have to have labels to make it sound like they have some significant movement.  Meanwhile, it’s just People for Biden.
Everything about Biden concerns me.
Yep....anybody for Biden abortion-killing is LOST
Come on, man!  Even Biden doesn't speak Biden! 🤣
This won’t affect people already on SS -on the off chance anything even happens on this -if he messes with it permanently then people like me won’t have SS when I’m FRA. But don’t stress. My mom already called me and was freakin out.On a positive she’s voting for Biden now
Looking forward to when Biden uses E.O.’s to demand Germany and Japan unconditionally surrender and he can finally claim victory for WWII.
Explain how this will work #MoscowMitch should I not deduct withholding from payroll this week? I’m glad the leaderless GOP is now on board with deficits and EO. It’ll make Biden’s job easier cleaning up your mess.
While u were off gallivanting, Trump has attempted to neuter your congressional powers. I guess u are fine with Biden doing the same in 6 months. U reap what u sow Tommy.

Biden might be mentally declining, but he had something to start with. The current leader is declining from basically nothing. I trust Biden will also surround himself with professionals with knowledge, unlike now.
Oh but if someone said something about Biden supporters like this, it would be a hate crime
Biden ....NEVER.
Biden is a liar.
Yes, I know that your screenshot is an article that doesn’t exist. If you want to see the Twilight Zone, produce an actual Biden article by “jeffiretruck
Biden said "Come on man, I heard you liked me!" To the staffer he sexually assaulted! What became  of that story! I for one believe her! He sure likes to say. "Come on man"!
Biden said "Come on man, I heard you liked me" to the staffer he sexually assaulted! He sure uses that "Come on man" alot! What ever happened to that story? I for one believe her! I'm voting for Trump! And red down the line!

If you vote for Joe Biden, “You ain’t black.”
Everyone in this feed that says the left isn’t trying to take guns.   Yes they are.   You know it, you just can’t say it like your Boy Beto did.  Now Biden has said he will put Beto in charge of gun control.  His stance is hell yeah we’re gonna take em
Will Biden’s handler please remove him from this and just pick someone else to run against Trump.   You know how hard it is to make Bernie look like he has all his Stuff together?  Well that’s Biden.
I think Biden‘s comment is what the DNC has thought for hundreds of years … Which clearly they know nothing‼️‼️
Well it’s Biden or Trump lol
Biden may be a Christian but his base is generally not. That’s what Trump is talking about.
I just saw a Biden ad using Ronald Reagan quotes that he used in his election campaign.  Pretty sure Biden has zero things in common with Reagan.
Biden vows to 'not interfere' with a possible Trump prosecution  via  Man Baby will look good in prison attire.
Sorry facts don’t help you. Trump destroyed the great economy he inherited from Obama and Biden.

Why is Joe Biden’s twitter account blocked?🤣🤣
Bet he will be. He is a millionaire and so is his wife they own 3 homes. Bet money spread in kids names so he doesn't have to pay. This is America it won't be if Biden gets in
He will embrace China n make Biden their ambassador
