Scott, other countries have verified it. There‚Äôs also bank documents that show money transfers. Trump lies. You must accept that.
Could put this on a loop and and play it every single day until the Election. It will be true every one of those days.  That's ALL Trump and his Sycophants have  Great job Don! üèÜüëè
were not worried about trump's tweets, were worried about WHAT THEY SAY, and what they imply he will do, if it werent for shit like that hitlist he put out a few weeks ago, WE WOULDNT BE WORRIED, we might CARE, but we wouldn't be WORRIED
Could we just have Barack Obama as POTUS again, just for a little while? I could listen to him forever. With Trump, I need to turn the TV off. Can't stand his voice. Just saying.
maybe, but I'd bet less than you think. I think its a real short list of folks who are on the fence with Biden but would be swayed by VP. Most folks on the left at this point know either they won't be feeding the machine or they can't sit by with Trump as the opponent.

And trump tweeting about the wall keeping people out. Who would want to come here?
1) never said it was deadly 2) it‚Äôs useless against COVID-19 but great for its intended use i.e. malaria, arthritis, lupus 3) when trump said it FDA approved it for covid, propelling multiple studies including the FDA‚Äôs. So your point is well, pointless. You Anons are grifted lol

Trump wants to delay the election just so he can buy time for himself. He knows he‚Äôs going to lose and so he wants time to try to cheat his way into winning the election.
But his obit must always read that he defied the recommendation to wear a mask and died because of it, and because of Donald Trump.

What worries me is not whether or not Trump wins, or cancels the election, but what petty, vindictive and destructive executive orders he will issue when he realizes he has lost and still has 2 months left.

Because when we said, "No need to fight. They go low. We go high" Trump got elected. Sad reality.
Has Pompeo had enough of this bs yet? Trump must make his job 1000x more difficult, and having to give non-answers like this must make him want to pull his hair out.

I live in Philly. I got laid off due to trump's piss poor response to COVID-19.  My income taxes the past two years were as high as they have ever been.  I cannot get a COVID test, and have to wear a mask everywhere I go, for the foreseeable future.  You boss is a failure!

Trump is a threat to our democracy and is becoming more authoritarian by the day. This country will not survive another 4 years of Trump.  I prefer Biden's policies and like that he is working with Bernie on a tax plan. This is what I like about Biden:
Question is what happens if he loses, declares it rigged, calls on the Qtards to take up arms, and surrounds the White House with the Barrstapo? They just had their second trial run in Portland (first test was illegally clearing the square for Trump's photo op) and #3 is starting
For all of you who want Barr to resign go drink a beer and learn how to live with your lies The issue here is the socialist people who disrespect our country our people and our president trump 2020

There‚Äôs no equivalence here.  Dems in opposition have attempted to govern responsibly. Republicans in opposition have been nihilists, arsonists. Exhibit A is Obama vs Trump on stimulus.  DJT is only the apotheosis of GOP‚Äôs complete bankruptcy. There‚Äôs no compromising with this.
After listening to Bush, Clinton and Obama at John Lewis‚Äô ceremony today, it‚Äôs depressing to think that Trump is our current president.
Humor and sarcasm in trump tweets, that is really cute. You are a special one.
Unbelievable. They lie and say Trump called white supremacists fine people and then run a full story excusing Byrd WHO WAS LITERALLY A WHITE SUPREMACIST!!!!!
Hands down! He‚Äôs responsible for the division we see today. He thought he could blame it on Trump last election and it backfired. Some fools never learn. üòÅ#TrumpLandslide2020 üá∫üá∏
China virus? Call it the tRump virus.  #TrumpIsARacist
Thank you trump. We will be out there in droves.
reading  and Steven Teles' book on the Never Trump conservatives. Wild to see confirmation that the McCain denunciation was indeed prompted by the Cohen-McGrath letter. It's at least hopeful to know so many solid people tried to prevent Trump.
I believe Trump said this to put the ball in Congress court. Now anything that happens to the integrity of the election falls on  . Low turnout, lost mail, fraudulent ballots... Pelosi now owns it. Well played Mr.  .
Donald Trump is so full of bs. Trump will come out and say he was just testing us. He will say of course a president can't change the election date. He is a snake and the Republicans deserve him. I will be glad when he's out and never again a republican
Trump loyalist who tested positive for coronavirus is America‚Äôs ‚Äòdumbest‚Äô congressman, says Lincoln Project co-founder
That‚Äôs pPence and Cabinet tho.  They‚Äôre gone if Trump loses, which he will, mightily.  But GOP Senate just might figure out their best chance of re-election lies in taking him down.  I wouldn‚Äôt bet on it but you never know.
Only because Trump is weaponizing Covid
ATTENTION Republican family &amp; friends: If Trump loses in November but doesn't step down, what will you do? (I've stolen this idea from someone who I will leave nameless so (s)he can avoid any trouble). I am genuinely curious...
It's really a shame Trump squandered the good will with people who got him elected. You'd think he would have consolidated that populist power. I have no doubt you could get him through November if the GOP hadn't taken over.
propaganda machine pence. How can you a religious godly man lie so egregiously?! While Biden was VP for8 years America prospered safely, much more so than under u and trump.! Defund the police is not an insult to police and does not mean eradicate police; anything but! Resign
HAHAHAHAHA... looks like we DO like Trump... how's that chapped ass
That is the fail safe plan. What if only #RedStates can certify results for the #ElectoralCollege? Then Trump wins. Or the Electoral College is voided, meaning a 0-0 tie which the corrupt courts may decide. The 12th Amendment kicks in for a Trump win. #TrumpPresser
It‚Äôs unfair to lump myself or any rational trump supporter into the same group as them. With any good comes the bad. Every political party has the dummies doing things like that. That will never change. No matter who you support unfortunately ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

This is getting juicy. Trump Suggests Delaying The Election Causing Democrats To Freak Out, But Technically Trump COULD
Here‚Äôs a question: is Trump going to acknowledge Herman Cain‚Äôs death or nah?

Remember when Trump was scared to ask Putin about bounties that were paid to have US troops killed? Who in the world would do that, except a complete coward, who‚Äôs also an idiot?
Trump also talked about court cases going on for years, which is the fail safe plan. What if only #RedStates can certify results for the #ElectoralCollege? Then Trump wins. Or the #EC is cancelled, meaning a 0-0 tie? The 12th Amendment kicks in for a Trump win. #TrumpPresser

let's start, right now, referring to Presidents by their jobs and what they actually do  Notary Public of the United States of America, Donald J. Trump
It‚Äôs like 50000000 trump years away.

Trump's advisors when he's trying to do a coup:
Leading to an ending almost literally from the Trump 2020 campaign team, signaling that women/minorities who want to change things are the real Nazis - and that the notion of democratic voting by the people is hilariously stupid
I have to believe that those who think that George W. Bush is likeable or rebranded after giving a few peppermints to Michelle Obama and not being as overtly racist as Trump also get their historical education from Instagram.
What I‚Äôm doing isn‚Äôt projecting.... that‚Äôs not what that means.. it‚Äôs not what I was doing. If you think he‚Äôs done a great job I worry about your future. If Obama or anyone else did the exact same job I would think they sucked. You guys show a complete inability to question trump
Now watch DHS will withdraw the courthouse will burn, and President Trump will be Vindicated as Federal forces were needed to Secure Public Safety! Brilliant move
You‚Äôre just another of Trump University graduates!!!
Trump attempting to do a coup:
Donald Trump is a fascist. Period.
The military will defend Trump if the Supreme Court rules that he is still president. This is the real danger.
Not that I say that's a concrete thing, Biden calling upon Bernie.  But it's a high likelihood.  The reason I want Biden is not because I hate Trump (I do), but because I know Biden will surround himself with people RIGHT for the job, unlike what Trump did.
Trump tells voters who live in suburbs they ‚Äòwill no longer be bothered‚Äô by low-income housing
‚ÄúClean out this beehive of terrorists‚Äù is how Trump describes the literal kidnapping and brutality against peaceful protesters in Oregon.  He used the phrase ‚Äúclean out‚Äù and let that resonate. Older generations have heard this before.
Trump literally contradicts himself in the same sentence. Jhc.
Is it my imagination, or does the texture of Trump‚Äôs face look more and more like the Yellowstone mud pots?
You‚Äôre fully confident that the Supreme Court will rule against Trump when he sues to invalidate the election results? A ‚Äúcoup‚Äù that keeps Trump in office after he loses the election will look like Bush v. Gore, not Pinochet v. Allende.
Wut.  Trump said he's sending in the National Guard to Portland to "take care of them."  "We're coming in very soon."  Which is of course, utter bullshit.
Trump, just now while talking about Portland refers to peaceful protesters as "terrorists".
The media outlets are allowing Trump to have a televised hate speech campaign rally. Actually it's more like a therapy session to spew lies.
He being heard by those he wants to reach all those ignoring him will be the loudest of the loud screaming "how did this happen!"  Trump has a agenda and he's working the phuck out of it.
OmGOD This LYING horrible president #trump has been lying non stop for 45 minutes and now faces softball questions from the press. Disgusting. #anotherbaseballquestion
Like, if Trump attempted to do a coup, the coup would straight up consist of him tweeting a thing, and then every Republican in Congress pretending they hadn't read it, the whole federal government not doing anything, and then Biden becomes president.
The people around the world aren't laughing at us like Trump proclaim's, they are laughing at him.
If you can‚Äôt be bothered to mention Trump by name...why do you have a problem? It‚Äôs almost as if you‚Äôre still protecting him or holding out hope for him.  We all know who he is and what he‚Äôs about...

Hillary was awful at getting the people on the fence to vote for her.  I'm not saying Biden is good, but Trump is awful too.

I do not like Biden... I will vote for him as a default, but I just hate Trump. Your typical democrat insults don‚Äôt work on me... I don‚Äôt care...in fact you got nothing so you are making this is fun..enjoy the knowledge I am dropping on you. You argued with the wrong Republican..

According to the Cong. Research Ctr  there is no direct ‚Äúdefinition of executive orders, presidential memoranda, and proclamations in the U.S. Constitution, there is, likewise, no specific provision authorizing their issuance.‚Äù  Trump can write any EO, including an election delay
I predict Donald Trump will accomplish it something like this:  1. Issue an Executive Order (EO) 2. Get it tied up in the courts as he has done with every court decision not in his favor; 3. Use the courts to issue stays, holding his EO in force until a judge makes a decision.

GET YOUR FEDERAL TROOPS OUT OF PORTLAND NOW!!!! YOU ARE NOT A PRESIDENT BUT A DICTATOR!!!!! WE WILL NOT HAVE THAT HERE IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA!!!! BIDEN HAS A HELLA MESS TO CLEAN UP CUZ OF YOU DAMMIT!!!! FUCK YOU TRUMP AND THE HORSE YOU RODE IN ON!!!
Fact.  Republicans are ashamed of our party.  Ashamed of the mask sneering, ashamed of the undermining public health officials, ashamed at the total lack of empathy toward the 150,000 dead.  And now Trump is again turning it into an undignified circus with his witch doctor.
No thanks, why would you want to hear from a Trump? Oh she hates her uncle. She wasnt smart enough to make it in business. So of course you will believe whatever she says.
#GOP and #Trump ARE MONEY HUNGRY PIGS THAT DONT GIVE A FUCK ABOUT AMERICANS AND THEY DONT CARE IF YOU DIE FROM COVID!!! ITS TIME TO STAND UP AND #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica2020 TIME TO TELL TRUMP TO SHUT THE FUCK UP AND HIS TIME IS UP!!!!
TRUMP
Why does  follow Trump on twitter
is going to be a very busy man trying to clean up Trump and the GOPs mess. They have dragged us through more muck than any other administration ever. The American people, protesters and esp. journalists are not adversaries. They are patriots.
First of all Tulsi is no democrat. Duke wanted her for the dem primary only to destroy the party. He never stopped supporting trump. He is endorsing him now.
Agree 100%. The payback to those that voted for Trump will be vicious.
Huge amount of nuts in Trump's orbit. #VoteBlue2020

Absolutely appalling, Barr. Just what does Trump have on you that you are compelled to sacrifice the lives of PEACEFUL protestors but do NOTHING when armed militia sanctioned by the TRAITOR in the WH brandish machine guns and swastikas?!
TRUTH TO THE MAX
Neither do live people who refuse to patronize nonessential breeding grounds of irresponsibility to get trump reelected.
Well  you might be right so I think you should go to Walmart and get some Clorox bleach and a tall  new water glass and bleach that crap right out of you. Also insert a UV light in an orifice of your choosing. That's how trump does it.
But Trump changed his tone...
Lol! You tell me. You must have all the answers somewhere behind your fake acct. üëç please stop wasting my time. I'm busy trying to convince all of your comrades to take the trump approved cure
For all those afflicted with TDS it wasn't necessary as it never happened. Just more fake news. You really have to stop the insanity just to gain power. You're losing badly with the powerful silent majority that will be voting in force for Trump come November.
Just so you know, Trumpers feel like Trump is that guy.
Trump heading to Texas for a fund raiser and to look at an oil rig field.  He's really Presidential around inanimate (Donald, that means "not alive") objects.    Especially since they don't ask questions.
So you're pro fascism. David Duke publicly supported trump. BLM doesn't mean only black lives, it means black lives matter too. Find me a photo of someone sporting a swastika, confederate flag or flashing a white power sign that isn't a Republican.
Just heard about Trump pulling troops out of Germany.  Lard Ass has accomplished more in 4 years than the Russians have tried since WW2. Putin must have given him the orders before November just in case tRump doesn't get elected. The treasonist Repukes will back his play.

Trump and his buddies need to be investigated for insider trading with this whole  deal.
The Americans who risk their lives every day to protect our country deserve better.
Cuz Trump invested a lotta money into itOh, for the love of God. I feel myself leaving my body. Not only that, I'm afraid to have a bad thought. Can you believe that was on Twitter and that the Trump family pushed it? I hope we make it to Christmas and New Years. It's going to be a very lean existence.
I'm skeptical. It's now less than 100 days until the election. All of these years have gone by and he has supported Trump through the longest 3 1/2 years I've ever experienced. These people are out to save their own sinking ship. I refuse to be duped.
-VF likely chosen because it has significant links to the "K" fam orbit, so can Interview past Associates for anything that appears "Suspect."  -The Article puts a 'wedge' between "K" &amp; Trump, making clear that these were his decisions or the decisions of someone working for him.
Trump couldn't build his wall on the border, at least one that will stand in a storm, so he built this one around the White House. It takes a lot of gall. It's another symbol of his all consuming concern for himself and great insecurity.
Trump is the embarrassment
Hahaha. I do. They were going to go through the bogus impeachment again anyway if they had they chance. A blue tie with a black suit? Impeach the man!!! He hasn't lost one true Trump supporter. He plays the media and those pol's with TDS like a fiddle. Its hilarious.
Trump floats delaying election despite lack of authority to do so
I could not agree more. My family fought in ww2, Korea, and Nam. How can anyone like Trump the he treats the intelligence agencies, dealings with Russia. Malcolm Nance spelled it out in his book the Plot to Hack America.  I tried to get him to testify before the house.
I love Trump, Trump's my Daddy! Greatest man that ever lived. That I can tell you.

Biden! Because I'm saying I'm voting for Biden to avoid scrutiny while actually voting Trump.
Trump and Kelly are in this together - they know they can‚Äôt win by playing by the rules, the polls have made that very clear. They‚Äôll stop at nothing to spread lies, attack our Democracy, and undermine the Constitution. Pitch in now to kick out Kelly! ‚¨áÔ∏è
NOW: Trump is defying the constitution by saying we should delay the November 2020 elections.  Trump: Delay the Election until people can properly, securely and safely vote???
THEN: Trump and Kelly joined forces to sue the state of Pennsylvania over their shared conspiracy theory that vote-by-mail is an attack on our democracy. We know what they‚Äôre really up to ‚Äî voter suppression is the only way they will win in November.
FIRST: Trump and the entire GOP began to tank in the polls. Here in PA, Trump is trailing Biden by 7 points and I‚Äôm within single digits of Mike Kelly.  (THREAD)
The reason we are talking about it is because you keep trying to undermine our civil liberties. You are the single biggest threat to america since the American Revolution. i.e Benedict Arnold. That trump would make such a statement is proof of his intent to destroy this Nation.

Thanks brother. I am a vet. Trump,  think about the stripes on our flag. What about the bounty Putin put on our soldiers, getting out of the open sky treaty with Russia. Trump is a Quisling. Give me Liberty or give me death Patrick Henery. Alan Dershowitz said Trump has more

Trump wants to delay the election due to mail in voting and also wants to defund USPS? I don't just smell a fish, I smell a dead Gyarados.
Trump sees nothing outside of himself, he is incapable of feeling anything outside of himself.
Trust me I like Trump. I voted for him in 2016 but on this virus he got it wrong!
Economy Tanking + Fears of losing election then being indicted = why Trump suggests delaying election
I voted Trump over Hillary. I don't regret my decision between the 2. Just hated that was the best America had to offer.
The man attended a Trump rally and refused to wear a mask. You get what you pay for. C you next Tuesday.
I think all the candidates are shit its pick the best shit that somewhat goes with your beliefs on what they can actually accomplish vs what they promise and ill take the unfollows right now its trump like it or not.
I thought picking between Trump and Hillary was rough, but Biden and Trump might be worse. How is Biden the best the democratic party has to offer? Out political system is a joke.
That was a simple example, but politics in general can have heavy affects on prices as well as world peace. Not to mention the environment. It's why Harper was a subject of ridicule world wide for Canada.. just as Trump is for America now... and lil' Boris in the UK
I‚Äôll never forget the feeling I got when I woke up the next day after the election and my mom told me Trump had won.... a shiver over my whole body.... that was the moment  my hatred for this country started.

im spending my next trump check on a graphics card.

Two things:  1) If absentee voting is good, what makes mail-in bad? They're literally the same thing.  2) Trump's insistence on delaying the election lines up with with a dictator trying to destroy electoral integrity, and thus try and steal an election through corruption.
He's not. Come on now Trump is helping America. He is laying the road to bring In jobs. I know you Dems want free stuff and free college and medical care but we are $25 trillion in debt it's time America starts to pay it's bills.

So still a hoax?? Send kids to school?? Don't wear a mask?? Still blame governors?? Will trump go to his funeral?? STOP the division!!

Some Minorities worked their asses off for a better life, were able to move into the Suburbs, but The low income housing act allowed poor housing to be built on their upper crust land, introduced inner city crime to the suburbs. Trump just ended that.
He's Putin's patsy. He's not looking for safe voting. He wants to be Putin. We all need to vote by mail to remove Trump and Putin from our country.
I know Trump is a womanizer and a sexist from his raunchy talk as a TV Celebrity. Yet none of which is really racist. Creepy at times towards women but not racist the whole nation knows that.

I‚Äôd be a little less concerned about what ever illegalities you ‚Äúthink‚Äù Trump has committed and more worried about what‚Äôs going to happen to all your favorite politicians once you learn what they‚Äôve done.
That means no more poor people Invading the suburbs that people paid so much for by hard work and effort only to have the poor and druggies move right in. Trump ended that!
A.k.a. they live in Cities. This is why the better off working class moved to the Suburbs to get their families to safer areas. All races that are well off have done this the low income housing act that Trump eliminated now protects the hard working American class from city folk.
All you need do is look up his statements and your jaw will drop. Copying statements is plagiarism and his desegregation rant in 1977 was telling and his hostile voting record against minorities in Washington is of no secret.blind hatred of Trump clouds the mind.
Trump is finally taking the virus seriously in considering mail in ballot fraud, not Absentee ballots but just acknowledging that COVID-19 is a threat Trump took a big baby step towards admitting he was wrong!

Of course they need to be told. They  don't owe trump anything so can do the right thing. Trump doesn't like that. He wants his judges working for him. He doesn't know or care that it's not supposed to work that way
Obama did nothing. How do you feel about Obama spying on the Trump campaign in 2016
Bullshit! I have been at my job for 5 years &amp; our minimum wage was $8 &amp; 3 years into my job it is now $11 because of what Trump did
It's Official Americans are Stupid! Especially Democrats &amp; far Right Republicans! While the rest of us who are vulnerable still quarantine to try and stay safe you idiots protesting &amp; rioting are spreading it around. Cases surge, people die and you blame Trump! No you hold it all
No. I don't hate Trump. I hate the way he acts and the terrible things he says and the way he has ruined and divided our very fragile nation. But I see Trump the human who is very limited and should never have received the #GOP nomination in 2016 to begin with. He needs help.

As I have been saying Trump is a Quisling, a domestic enemy
I‚Äôm well aware of how creepy and disgusting Biden is, but I‚Äôm sorry I only have two choices what do you expect me to do? Vote for someone who has absolutely no chance at winning? That‚Äôs a vote for trump in my eyes. That a vote wasted in my eyes

I doubt she breaks 1.5%
By God, this beats everything, absolutely every crazy thing Trump has ever tweeted does not compare with this one. And to think that people have any worries about Joe Biden. Oh my, this is a first.
Me too, and I agree about the protesters, I think it was Joe Walsh who said prolonged protests would help Trump.   And like you said they're accomplishing nothing at this point. The best protest is on November 3rd.
I'm not sure people really associate this with Biden.  These are scenes from Trump's America.
I think it‚Äôs mind-boggling that Joe Biden is the culmination of everything wrong with our political system, but Trump has still somehow found a way to be worse.
We'll see what other polls say.  This one is erratic and has had Trump ahead just a month ago.  I don't think Portland is hurting him though because the many of the protesters aren't innocent as well.

I know ur not talking about Trump. Plz....
John Lewis funeral...trump acting more  a fool than usual so he's acting out bcz he hates the focus not being him.  It is exhausting. So many of us are so damn tired.
Sarah Burris:  Sen. Inhofe lied to Trump when he said he'd make sure the bill didn't pass, but it already had. Was he just trying to get Trump off the phone?
Sarah Burris:  Sen. Inhofe put Trump on speakerphone while in a restaurant, and someone else recorded the conversation. Trump said he didn't want a bill to pass that changed the names of bases from Confederate names, &amp; it had already passed!
Sarah Burris:  Trump's unpaid bills for police are not official visits--those are paid by taxpayers. He's not paying the bills from his campaign rallies, which do not get paid with taxpayer money.
Sarah:  We're never gonna win the no-mask voters. The cop vote is my favorite b/c Trump has been running all these ads saying Biden wants to defund cop depts. Trump is already defunding police by $2 million that he hasn't paid to police for OT, etc, during his visits
Sarah Burris:I didn't think Trump tried to take away attn from Lewis; I thought it was because he'd heard the GDP numbers dropped so much, I think a 70-yr record. I think he was trying to fight the economic news but his plan backfired--Lewis &amp; economy still made news
Sarah Burris:  Herman Cain traveled to AZ after the Trump rally in OK.  I'm obviously not a huge fan of Herman Cain but this is a prime example that it doesn't matter if you're a friend of the Pres, you could still die from COVID.
Democrats are already pushing Americans into a corner with their Stalinist rules during the pandemic. I just saw an insane Biden tv ad that talked about electing Trump led to the violence when its Democrats involved in the ‚Äúmostly violent protests‚Äù!
Especially if Trump wins again.

Pat LaMarche:  I don't know that I would give Trump or any of his rotten kids credit for potentially disenfranchising millions of voters. Remember that recent election that was one be one vote?  It's sooo important that everyone can vote.
Pat LaMarche:  It's laughable Trump thought he could outshine a room with George W. Bush, Obama, Clinton, and Jimmy Carter, and a man who walked across the Pettus Bridge. Even VPs weren't allowed to speak because they didn't make the top tier.
who is this child, and what color has trump called you, and nobody has ever told me i'm not black
Max Burns:  If Trump really cared about protecting us, he'd have filled all the empty gov't positions.
Max Burns:  US intelligence agencies announced that Russian operatives are working to spread COVID propaganda. They can do it b/c under Trump the last 4 yrs, nothing's been done about election security, information security...
Max Burns:  When Trump's back is to the wall, we get press conferences that rewrite reality.
Max Burns:  We see how few Repubs have spoken out about Trump's tweet, even though we know they've seen it. We need governors to commit publicly, in writing, that they will stay true to the Election Day no matter what Trump does.
Max Burns:  Trump has a record of ignoring Supreme Court orders and laws he doesn't like. We need a plan in place to stop him if he tries to move the election anyway.
And of course, the person on the WH team tasked in Trump‚Äôs EO with handpicking industries to make winners like Kodak in this totally not socialist 2020 economy, was Jared Kushner‚Äôs college roommate.
Max Burns:  It was remarkable to see Trump's press conference today when he said he's done things with the economy that no one has ever done before. I think that's true b/c he'd done nothing. In fact, he wants to cut unemployment pmts to people.
Philanthropists have stepped in to fill the federal government gap and create a large amount of testing we are seeing, the Trump takes credit for but refuses to provide. They were told this    ‚ÄúDespite what we might be hearing, there is nothing being done in the admin on testing‚Äù
Max Burns:  Any time you see public criticism of Trump from within the GOP is a big deal. In 2016 after the Access Hollywood video came out, a lot of Repubs jumped ship but voted for him once it was clear he could win the election.
Kushner‚Äôs corona testing team in April hired billionaires and bankers, who started to formulate a comprehensive national testing plan. Then trump got soured, Kushner was convinced blue states would be the only ones that suffered. Testing plan forever stopped.
Trump's talking about moving the election today was to distract from the eulogy of a great man. #JohnLewis  #RickShow
No one should be surprised President Obama gave a campaign speech today. Our country‚Äôs deep divisions didn‚Äôt start when President Trump was elected.

It's still a thing, and it's expanding for the coronavirus vaccine specifically. Operation Warp Speed has people thinking it 1) won't be safe when it comes out because of the fast track or 2) will be bad because it comes from a Trump program. Plus the usual anti-vaxxers. No good.
No Trump. He passed away at YOUR rally because he was ignorant and didn‚Äôt wear a mask. Herman sacrificed himself for you. And all you got there was one less Trump voter.

Herman Cain died of COVID-19 today after attending the Trump rally. Let that sink in.
Trump is a fascist and he and his supporters have no right to participate in our society.  We must treat them like the outcasts they are.
Seriously?  So Trump's a paid influencer now?  Wonder what kind of kickback he's getting?
Trump was asked if he was serious about delaying the election, and his answer included taking about the Russia investigation, some BS about ‚Äúother countries are worse‚Äù with Coronavirus, and that absentee ballots are good, and somehow different than voting by mail.
It amazes me and disturbs me so much how this country went from President Obama to now Trump. So sad.
The Trump election troll worked ‚Äîeven on these Republican rubes
Trump's political rallies #DefundThePolice in communities all across the country.
He didn't change his mind because of Trump's latest tweet. There's something else going on here.
Go Trump 2020!!!
You can't support delaying the election. Amendment XX of the Constitution tells us this fact. If you boyfriend tRump thinks otherwise he is a fool. Well that goes beyond saying.
Did Putin tell you you were going to win? You stand up there and cry that the election is going to be rigged. Five minutes later you are tweeting you are going to win.  You are so fucked up tRump.
if trump had his way, he would call the election right now, declare himself the winner and move on, something like putin has done, give himself another ten years

Exactly. Trump has ZERO empathy, and cannot feel shame or remorse. He can and will do literally anything to get what he wants. Laws won't stop someone like that. Neither will tradition or morality. People still don't get it. Trump is a sociopath.
Trump broke them.
150k Americans are dead, millions more are unemployed and facing eviction and starvation. And Trump wants to illegally seize power.
Who really wants to hear trump babble after hearing the classic elegance of Barack Obama this afternoon. I don't. I will be tuning out to numnuts at 5:30.
I'm still waiting for all these well educated, empathetic and polite journalists to actually call Trump out on, oh I dunno, ANY of his bullshit of the past 4 years? That'd be nice.
Trump's goal is to create chaos, and pretending he's got the power to move the election, and then just DOING it, will serve that goal well enough. Pay. Attention.
I don't care if it takes until January 2021 to find out the results as long as it means that Trump is being escorted out of "The People's House."
I was imagining Trump running a parallel presidency for his cult for four years or til he gets bored as yet another norm destruction
And they wonder why Trump would not attend.
President Trump, who is trailing in polls, is floating the idea of delaying the election in November. He doesn't have that power. Also, his claim that #VoteByMail leads to inaccurate counts or fraud is false.
Jefferson would have been able to spell Michie and Charlottesville. First clue Trump didn't send tweet is Caligiuri
He death is blood on your hands King Trump
Don‚Äôt hold your breath waiting for  to ever disagree publicly with Donald Trump. It could be hazardous to your health.
Pelosi passes every damn thing trump throws at her, but if she became president like the libs are trending, at least a woman would be the one enforcing the decisions. That‚Äôs definitely the most important thing.
And Trump shows no remorse for or even awareness of that fact.
Trump could have acknowledged his error on covid-19, apologized and used this as a teachable moment for everyone to wear a mask and follow basic safety protocols for the Coronavirus. But of course, that's not what he did.
Trump actually called a press conference while Obama was scheduled to speak. How lame ass pathetic is that? And yes, the picture is.... awkward.
Miss him too. I have come to realize no party or person is perfect and each party has great leaders. Trump is not one of them.
Apparently trump called an emergency presser right as Obama was scheduled to speak.
What a sad, pathetic vindictive little man. And this maggot is what Republicans believe represents strength of character?
y'all better be making contingency plans for Trump losing in Nov and his refusal to step down.
Cain died a needless death. Had he worn a mask and avoided Trump rallies then odds are he would still be alive.
I'll believe it when the GOP actually does something tangible to stop Trump. Until then the GOP are still the enemy.
I'll believe it when I see them actually fucking DO SOMETHING about stopping Trump. Otherwise my basic assumption regarding the entire Republican party is that they're all traitors.

Does Liz Warren's plan include a "pretty please" or a "pretty, pretty please" when asking Trump to honor the election results?
31/  Wild Card: As many have noted, the Constitution allows state legislatures to appoint state electors with no input from voters. With 28 Republican-controlled legislatures, representing states with 294 EV, in theory, they could forego voting, and hand Trump reelection.
28/  Some Republican governors who are not likely to blindly follow Trump happen to represent blue states. If MA, VT, and MD held their elections, that would add 24 EVs to the Democratic tally from above, likely enough to put the Democratic candidate over the top.
27/  3) Not all Republican governors are members of Team Trump.  It is unlikely they will take any orders from him.
Republicans aren't going to leave if Trump gets blown out in November.  We're going to have to take it from them.
Maybe they all were tested, since #Trump doesn't think it is necessary for the people on the street, but for him and those around them tests, and fast results.
Its sad seeing you reduced to this level. I hope you at least got a good price for selling your soul to Trump.
Herman Cain almost certainly literally died because of a Trump rally.
Well...unless Trump catches the Coronavirus. Then I think things would get very, very interesting in trumperland.
Trump: covid-19 is getting bad, we should shut down elections! Also Trump: covid-19 isn't a threat, let's send all the kids back to school! Ask the trumpers to reconcile both statements, see what answers you get. Because they both cannot be true at the same time.
24/  Depending on exactly how state law is written, a cancellation/postponement could leave a state without a functioning legislature, major statewide offices, judicial offices, and federal representation. Even in Trump states, would state leaders decide it's worth it?
17/  Beyond that, things get fuzzy, w/50 different states (plus Washington, DC) w/different sets of rules and political situations. There are countless ways this could theoretically play out. However, it's hard to name one that produces the result Trump wants: reelection.
5/  Regardless, postponing the election would not allow Trump to continue as president indefinitely. As so many have noted, per the 20th Amendment, his first term ends on January 20, 2021. So, if he is not duly REELECTED, he would have no further legal claim to power.
The internet is forever kids. FOREVER!

Is it? He decided to be part of the cult and died as a result of his ignorance and need to worship Trump. Then this same cult wants to send our children to die in schools. Why should we feel bad for him?

Its ok for the Trump to vote by mail but we the people is a nope. Voter suppression at its best with this tweet.  Donald Trump does want mail in ballots cause he knows he'll lose. So either way fraud is committed will be by Trump &amp; the GOP #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica2020
There, he is expected to reaffirm the administration's stance against movements to defund law enforcement.
Trump is laying the ground work to claim the election is rigged. When he loses, he'll refuse to step down and accuse the Dems of cheating. And that's how our government will fall
I think it won't matter. Trump will lose in a massive blowout, and he will simply declare the election invalid, accuse the Dems of cheating and refuse to step down. The GOP will back him, and the media will claim both 'sides' are equally bad.
Treaty (N): A formally concluded and ratified agreement between countries. IE: Trump wouldn't understand a treaty if it landed in his lap. The 2 percent is a lie. Again.
No, it opens the door to racial segregation. Trump is a racist and so are the trumpers. When they're not hating brown people, they're spreading covid-19 everywhere.Trump votes by mail. And no, you will not change election day.
All this and still he wouldn‚Äôt wear a mask or socially distance himself during a pandemic. Sad ending to die for Donald Trump.
In WWI, the Dutch stayed *neutral* so the total number of German soldiers from WWI buried at Ysselsteyn is very very low.   So why did Trump‚Äôs Ambassador to the Netherlands decide to visit a cemetery that is almost all dead Nazis?
C. They're just stupid. Trump even once said that he loves the uneducated. They're easy to con and manipulate. Smarter people see through the lies and know the truth. Stupid people cannot. It's really that simple. Intelligent people are against Trump. Unintelligent support him.
Problem is, he‚Äôs not done with his corruption. Not sure what Barr and Durham are doing but there are a lot of people including Obama who tried to stop Trump from being President by breaking laws That‚Äôs treason. Punishable by death.
Oh he supports it, just because tRump said it.  fRed has no independent thought whatsoever anymore.
Oh it‚Äôs the Democrats wanting tax cuts for the rich now somehow, not at all like what the Republicans &amp; Trump already gave them...   sure.
Insincere, racist, &amp; xenophobic all at the same time.  That‚Äôs tRump for you.
So sad. The dems are so much more effective and organized than Trump and his group. He has no hope against them.
‚ÄúWith Pence aboard, the Trump 2020 campaign bus collided with a dump truck around 11 a.m. in Allegheny County.‚Äù That detail is *chef‚Äôs kiss*.  via
False. Donald trump is fluent in bullshit.
Please!  Somebody get this message to President Trump!
Mike pence I hope you know god is watching? How can you present yourself as a man of faith and stand up and flat out lie to Americans. I can‚Äôt understand how you have more fear of trump than faith in god. You need to pray for courage to get over your fear
Trump cannot win by just staying on his golf course
Not getting my hopes up but this trump outburst feels a little different
Patrick is a solid reporter, but in this thread, you can see a clear example of how media can unintentionally add legitimacy to Trump's claims without even realizing it.
It'd be fine for you to say that they've both given different reasons. But you concluded what Trump believes based on what he says. That is not warranted. This is not a minor issue.
And I suspect this may sound like quibbling to you, but there is a huge difference in a respected media figure saying that Trump believes something versus saying that Trump *says* he believes something. These times demand caution.
Important to be cautious in ascribing motives to Trump. Do you really know Trump fears election fraud? Do you take him at his word?
Herman Cain‚Äôs family should sue the Trump campaign for reckless endangerment.
We had bipartisan support for the eulogy of Rep John Lewis today. Where was the current president? Trump only cares for himself. The quicker we can get rid of this narcissistic con-man the better.

Uhm, how to put this for Twitter... ‚Äúoutput from the southern end of a northbound cow.‚Äù   Trump supports anything that will give him power, keep him in power, or line his pockets, even if he just claimed supporting the exact opposite 15 minutes ago.
Ask him about the economy! Ask trump about Flynn! Ask him when does he plan on doing something about covid other than making money off of it? Ask him why does he lie constantly?
Donald trump is fucking insane. Harassing Governor Brown and now trying to postpone the election. He‚Äôs going to try and become dictator.    the tiniest hands, and brain, of all time. Fuck you.
Rephrasing: Herman Cain dies from attending Trump rally.
When interviewing him ask him about his business relationship with foreign governments getting the bulk of u.s. contracts.  Ask him why did he allow and conspire with Trump breaking the laws regarding Ukraine?
....they're the same thing. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è I encourage any Trump supporting followers of mine to jump the mental hoops to try and defend this
Take out the money for Trump and big business. Do not touch social security
I think your hopes for humble self-inspection here are charitable but naive. Mr. Turley admits fault the same way Trump does -- meaning that he doesn't.
If you think the majority of GOP politicians will do anything about that, you have not been paying attention the last four years. Even if the election happens and Trump loses, he absolutely will not leave without being forced to. That eventuality must be prepared for.
Thread by  Fascism. Authoritarianism. The question has always been, could it happen here? Because the answer has been NO doeat it will always be so. It is happening here. It is happening right now. Trump crossed the rubicon this morning.‚Ä¶
The GOP has ran a concerted strategy for the last 10 years to gerrymander every state they can. In states that have elected Dem governors, the GOP legislatures have taken away executive powers during lame duck sessions. Make no mistake, Trump will try to delay the election.
I would hope that journalists have realized that the question isn't whether Trump is legally allowed to delay the election. It's whether anything or anyone can or will stop him. What happens if purple states with GOP governors don't participate?
Awful news. Please, everyone, wear your mask  "While it is unclear where Cain contracted the disease, he was among the several thousand people who attended a Trump campaign rally in Tulsa on June 20, most of whom did not wear masks."
Let's adjust that headline: Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain - attended Donald Trump's notorious Tulsa rally WITHOUT a mask and diagnosed with COVID-19 nine days later - DIES.
Cain killed Cain.  Cain had this cavalier mentality long before Trump became a political entity.
Donald Trump should resign. Pass it on.
can't believe Donald Trump killed Herman Cain... we live in a truly sick world.
What??? Didn't he just attend that Trump rally??
Herman Cain just died from the COVID he caught at the Trump rally.  Reap what ye sow.  Take Gohmert with you.  I said what I said.
What in the ever loving hell?! Nope. Never.
Wonder why Trump chose to rage tweet this morning about delaying the election? Perhaps to distract from something? 96 days. Let‚Äôs keep grinding. No distractions.
#youcantdothat #MailInBallotFraud is #fakenews Trump floats delaying the election, but he can't do that
Although the thought of Trump still getting to be Biden's VP strikes me with a sense of dread so I'm glad some positive things have come out of the two party system. ü§£ü§£ü§£
and so it begins...
But seriously, if Republicans don't dump Trump after this kind of a stunt, they deserve the every bit of the ridicule they'll get the next time they talk about limited government.
Donald. Trump. Is. A. Fascist.  If you vote for Trump in 2020 you are also a Fascist.
Remember‚Äîin the era of coronavirus, racial unrest, and a thousand other injustices‚ÄîDonald Trump is the victim, not YOU. #bluewave

Ah, of course, the pediatrician has been treating ‚Äúhundreds of different patients‚Äù for COVID-19, at least according to tRump at the press conference.  Me thinks they need a board review.

Rain fell in my city. It was Trump‚Äôs fault. Everything is his fault.

How much is trump paying you to tweet for him.
Because of all of the polls the Trump campaign and RNC and OAN have released that show Trump winning? Compared to the other polls that show he has a 32% approval on Covid, race relations, find Biden more competent on economy &amp; less senile? Okay, Boomer.

We are always right to question Trump's motives, but have to disagree with you here, in part. This isn't a medical model. It's a public health / health services / health economics question that is not unreasonable for an econ to comment on.
Why don‚Äôt you guys just flat out say trump sent the secret police to stir up trouble to make it look like a chaotic event. I believe these same people he has sent in were there to ignite  the situation. That building in Seattle was boarded up weeks ago.
Trump loves the uneducated.
Is the White House going to send him some Trump Cough syrup? #trustthescience #trumpsplan #TrumpsAmerica
But Trump only cares about image and his ego. No one can be a bigger deal. He can‚Äôt process that Barr is keeping him safe. Too far gone in dementia.
That‚Äôs what happened with Steve Bannon. SNL did the skits with Bannon co trolling Trump and by the end of summer Bannon was gone. This could work.

Happy 5th anniversary of  warning that Trump might be leading the Republican ticket next year and being met with ... this:
Early in the Kansas City prophetic movement, there‚Äôs was a move towards reigning in some of the more outlandish stuff, but those days are gone. It‚Äôs like a free for all, and unsurprisingly these charlatans are milking Trump‚Äôs chaos for every last penny and oz of fame.
Girl I have no idea if it had solar panels. It‚Äôs the fortress to keep out invading murderers and rapists Trump swore Mexico would pay for. USA taxpayers paid and most was stolen by Trump and his cronies given that the wall is thin as paper and covers 10feet on a 3000mile border.
Trump told the Post that he knew he couldn‚Äôt win, but he sued anyway. ‚ÄúI spent a couple of bucks on legal fees, and they spent a whole lot more,‚Äù Trump said. ‚ÄúI did it to make his life miserable, which I‚Äôm happy about.‚Äù  That alone should make it SLAPP, &amp; him responsible for cost
I wish trump was a facist
Biden will be able to send in DEA and patrol cities, use the gun registry to go to people‚Äôs doors and take their now illegal rifles. Before, that enforcement would have been left to sheriff‚Äôs offices. Now, because of Trump &amp; Barr - not so much. See?
This election is going to be 100% about Trump!
Thank you for speaking out now and going on the record that Trump WILL accept the outcome of the election!

Why doesn‚Äôt integrity matter? Where are your Christian values and morality?  Doesn‚Äôt this scenario suggest Donald Trump is the anti-christ?
Trump can‚Äôt even name a Bible verse. He is fooling you by telling you what you want to hear, which is a message based in hate.
Why does Trump let himself appear so  weak?!? Why doesn‚Äôt he release the campaign polls? The RNC polls? OAN‚Äôs polling?!?
So the thing about America ... and the philosophy of Trump ... if you don‚Äôt like your State, YOU CAN LEAVE!!!!
The best way to combat that would be for the campaign, RNC, and OAN to release their polls that show Trump in the lead!
Didn't the virus come from China? Didn't he close stuff down when Nancy was dancing in the streets? Trump by no means is a biotech engineer or world class virologist that he himself can create such a virus and unleash it on America. Listen to what your saying haha.
I wish God would stop letting these kinds of tapes leak and stop having Trump wish child sex traffickers well. It‚Äôs starting to turn my stomach.

BREAKING NEWS
Why didn't Trump's new doctor give Herman the secret cure??
Herman Cain didn't need Trump to kill him. He died of self-inflicted wounds. He was smart enough to know how to protect himself, but he died stupid. Sadly, he inspired many of his followers to be as reckless as he was. How many other people died for Herman's defiance?
He tried to save lives?!!! Seriously?!!! 151,000 American souls dead and counting. Damn, if he can't do a better job of saving lives, then that's a rather lame-ass excuse you're offering! He owns all of this: the virus, economy in the shitter, cities burning. It's all on tRump!
People whine so hard about how we didn't have a federal solution, but we know if Trump came out in March and mandated states do such and such, we'd be getting the "fAScIsT OvERrEa for weeks. He didn't, now they all wish he'd "done something!!!"
This is proof you are Demented. We shut down the economy voluntarily, Hello is anyone home. Leadership of Trump is only thing that has kept the Country from bankruptcy. I forgot you have never had a real job. Life time government payroll baby.
if this has taught us anything, please listen to the health professionals over trump.  Trump is an idiot, through and through.   Medical professionals knows what they are talking about.  Herman's hubris took his life. It's tragic because he could have lived.
üò±There is the Constitution!!! Why doesn‚Äôt Congress impeach Barr. Why can‚Äôt Republicans realize that trump is dismantling our country?  This message is directed  and  and
Herman Cain died of the Coronavirus today. He sat next to Gov Stitt (who has coronavirus) of OK at tRump‚Äôs Tulsa rally without a mask. So, I‚Äôm guessing that rally was the spreader first these two.

This is terrorism. Trump sponsored terrorism in an effort to remain in power. Trump doesn't care about you. Trump only knows how to use and discard people. Ask his wives. Ask his family. Ask his business associates.
This is Trump's America. He'd rather see us fighting in the streets than admit he's been proven a liar, thief, con man and a failure.
you spend your entire lives hating you hate trump he hates you you hate those who oppose your opinion and they hate you the blacks hate whites the whites hate blacks etc etc it is endless hate and death from the day you set foot here and you want to bring..

Moms want their kids to be safe! The trump dynamic only considers what is best for ONE person: Liar-in-Chief Donny. #AmericaOrTrump  #HistoryWillCallItTrumpVirus
Oh protesting riots, large funerals, are safe anyone with stage 4 cancer can attend them just not Trump rallies ya know Joe and you should move to Greece!
That was the 1st Feench Study that was Later Retracted as Untrue. All Studies Since have said it is Not Effective. If it Worked Why Wouldn't People All Over the World take Hydroxychloroquine that is So Cheap &amp; Readily Avaliable? Did Herman Cain take it as a Close Friend of Trump?
I so badly hope Trump Retweets this thinking it is a supporter video.
He went knee deep on trump
I agree, take away Barr. Yes trump may find another moron but it will take time and some Republicans may not be so quick to make another mistake like they did with Barr. It could help save our rule of law from completely crumbling and stop some of trumps corruption
Vote Trump 2020 or do you want more jobs going to Communist China? Even Dented Joe is voting Trump.. see:
You are uninformed. PPD and Feds escalated peaceful protests from the start.   Parroting #GestapoTrump doesn‚Äôt make you sound edgy or smart, it makes you sound like the useful idiot Trump thinks you are.
JUST THINK IF TRUMP NEVER BECAME PRESIDENT WE WOULDNT HAVE EVEN KNOWN WE HAD BEEN SLAVES ALL ALONG..NOW WE KNOW THEY ARE JUST A RICH GROUP OF SLAVE OWNERS THAT HAVE BEEN USING US FOR MANY YEARS
I just want to hear what she'd have done different if she were Trump, we need solutions not fingers being pointed.
remember when the House impeached Trump? feels like a decade ago.
Honestly for real. All politicians are liars. However I would vote for my spider plant or my asshole cat over trump. Im fairly certain Sprinkle cat would bite Vladimir Putin just because he can.
He should be charged for treason. I was critical of Obama, and Bush Jr. But those two look like paragons compared to Trump.
It was the the dirty cops in MSP that have a nasty habit of murdering unarmed people in handcuffs that sparked protest.  Quit projecting. Unless you‚Äôre actually admitting trump is a White Supremacist.  Which is who started the riots here in town.
Ha ha, that‚Äôs good! I was ü§î   ‚ÄúHey #resistance, I‚Äôm 6 followers away from 300 but I want more so I can share w/my #resister buddies why I think Trump is a fuckstick &amp; we can ride the blue üåä to #Biden2020 ville together!‚Äù  What ya üí≠? Snazzy?   This is considered profile pic

Trump encounters broad pushback to his suggestion to delay the Nov. 3 election
Yeppers, the uber weasel Rep  is in on this.  Ol' Guy is  gonna regret his Trump worshiping.
The good news is that there have been several high profile republicans publicly saying  they‚Äôll have absolutely no part in this. But of course, the fact that our president would raise this at all is still unsettling.
Any comment about trump suggesting delaying the election?  Admitting he hates the US and just wants to be totalitarian dictator.  If you're still supporting trump, you are the problem. #AmericaOrTrump
Trump administration is suing PA so we can‚Äôt drop ballots off at election office. PLEASE ADVISE!!! #VoteForOurLives
Except the orange Cheeto is literally suing states to prevent the use of dropboxes:
Why is hurting each other emotionally and physically how so many people see as the way to fix things??  We are up against evil and that comes in every color and creed. Its all so sad.  The powers that be really don‚Äôt like Trump kicking their table over and doing it his way.

Trump‚Äôs twin.
I don't know what would have been harder for 18 year old Corey to believe. Trump is president or I like JJ Reddick.
Wouldn‚Äôt it be disgusting if God forbid Trump loses and she becomes president in four years because she blew somebody?! That‚Äôs the antithesis of everything that women fought for to be treated equally.
...said Trump's Propaganda Chief.
Yep! this is exactly how Obama got Trump elected in 2016üëè
trump managed to get us blocked in real life üíÄ
He is just stating the obvious. Trump is reckless, and any man, black or white, or named Jack can be a victim.
I‚Äôm not a journalism expert or anything, but ‚ÄúHerman Cain Dies After Catching Covid at Trump Rally‚Äù kinda seems like a bigger story than it‚Äôs been...
Can‚Äôt wait to gloat over the mansplainers when Trump loses the election but stays in power
You have no basis of saying Obama was corrupt. You may not like this policies and wish Trump dismantles them all, this is fine with me. I do not like some of Obama's policies. But attacking him personally, you sir are no gentlemen.
Trump death cult is killing its own
I would take Simon and Garfunkel on the ticket as long as Trump is bounced out.
Lol. Trump campaign bus crashing into dump truck with Mike Pence on board is the perfect metaphor for 2020 / Queerty How perfect.
Trump killed Herman Cain, that‚Äôs a new one...

I'm fairly sure I have a natural immunity to covid 19 , when will the correct test be given? after November I am guessing? Will not matter because We are gonna have 4 more years Trump Pence 2020 üá∫üá∏
Theoretically, social media is a private enterprise, and therefore is not protected speech. On a public forum, it would be protected. That said, I doubt Twitter is concerned about Jen's tweets. They're busy with Trump's.
Ok, so good for Mr. Calabresi; now sell it to Mitch, Jim Jordan and the rest of Trump‚Äôs lickspittle thugs. Then I‚Äôll believe you.
Instead of moving the election to 2021, can we move Trump to 2173? #Election2020
A Black Lives Matter protest, Cops for Trump demonstration - both coincideing with a visit to Greensburg by Vice President Mike Pence.  has details.
I already know what you‚Äôll say.. ‚Äúthis is an opinion piece‚Äù.. it‚Äôs not.. it has to be called that bc it‚Äôs told from the first person. However it‚Äôs a personal testimony to the fact that Trump did not disband that office &amp; this talking point is a lie.
He‚Äôs going to say whatever he has to because if trump looses he knows his ass is on the line
For sure no! Biden is a statesman. He wasn‚Äôt my first choice, but I‚Äôd vote for my 4 year old nephew b4 voting for trump, so, there‚Äôs that! Biden will allow the nation to take a breath and nerves to settle a moment while we think as a nation about real changes we need to make.
This bears watching, don't believe anything coming out of trump or this administration.
No, Trump is his own God. But Pompeo is one different animal altogether. üíôüå∑
We know  is not a very smart guy, so I guess it shouldn‚Äôt be surprising how uneducated his followers are. It‚Äôs hard to believe people actually talk that way, and cannot spell such simple words. Then again if they were smart they would not be supporting trump.
The only way President Trump will be voted out is if the Democrats rig the election!
As I recall he‚Äôs done a fair amount of Trump-enabling over the years.  I knew back in 1989 with Trump‚Äôs racist ad-buys that he was a rotten person not worth our time
Trump is a rat in a corner and that rodent is very dangerous. He‚Äôll have no limits.
remember when Kamala kept asking candidates to join her pledge to kick trump off Twitter, what the hell is with the Dems and this website
Wow. I looked early today and Trump was getting his ass kicked. And looky what happened. Looks kinda like 2016, and what is coming in November.
What happened in #Texas could happen to you. People were voting straight Democratic ticket. When they pressed enter the entire screen changed to Ted Cruz &amp; GOP    He was Installed just like Trump

Hey #Pennsylvania. Remember  Pence is Just a corrupt a #TraitorTrump  We Must destroy their #FascistCoup &amp; send them to Prison!!! Pence is an accomplice in Trump MASS MURDER OF 151K of our FAMILY/FRIENDS!    #PenceKnew #TrumpRussia #PenceKnew #Ukrainegate #PenceForPrison
This could lead to state legislators making decisions on who won in order to certify results &amp; seat electors in time. Many swing states (like mine...PA) have GOP state legislatures that could decide, in interest of time, to decide in favor of Trump
If we actually have a season, Penn State players need to wear social messages on the back of their jerseys that piss off the most Trump loving Penn State fans as possible.  If you can't handle Black Lives Matter, when we have an African American coach, quit coming!

Really, the house should impeach Trump at least once a week. #AlwayBeImpeaching
Hope all the Trump-loving Mormons loved it!
Can't wait to hear Trump's reaction.
What a cluster of a season.  Rob Manfred is as bad as Trump.
Call a Medical Doctor who is African American a "crazy woman who is a disgrace" because Trump retweeted her support of Hydroxychloroquine because of the success she is having
Love the av.
Funny, because Trump doesn‚Äôt even take responsibility for his OWN actions.
Read Sinclair Lewis‚Äô ‚ÄúIt Can‚Äôt Happen Here‚Äù... because Trump is trying to make it a reality....
Trump is presently being advised by people who aren‚Äôt going to go public before he presents us with an amazingly stupid October surprise.
All while trump talks about how he wants to have sex with his daughter....
trump thinks covid is fake until it comes to the election that he‚Äôs scared of losing lMaO
Ran out of chars. But if there end up being debates. Oh boy. ü§í. Basically I‚Äôm saying lots of time till Election Day. And I think trump will still get the win.
I hope so! I cant say for certain how it will go because I don't Trust the polls, especially after 2016,  but I do see the amount of people who are outraged by Trump. So I'm hoping the people who didn't vote in 2016 because they didn't want Hillary, actually vote this time!!
Trump killed Herman Cain.
To be honest, I conflated two arguments I was having. I didn‚Äôt mean to call you a Trump apologist. Sorry.
The national polls were correct.  The states that allowed Trump to with were still within the margin of error.  That being said, people on both sides should vote regardless of what polls say.
Sorry to interject, but you can "not think it is" until the cows come home, but it doesn't change a thing. Pence is Anti-LGBTQ. As is trump, and most of the GOP. Google it.
Trump broke her along time ago.
Foreign concept these days, actually. You can approve of things people have done *gasp* while also feeling that they can improve some things. My disapproval does not imply that I‚Äôm part of your Trump 2020 cult ‚úåüèΩ
Trump could personally cure Covid-19, turn water into wine and walk on water between now and November and I‚Äôd still vote #Biden2020
How about respect for those who do wear them, instead of saying  we "fell for the lie," "want to embarrass Trump" or " are running scared?"
Demon sperm tweeted it not Trump üêòüó≥üá∫üá∏
Trump is going to tell people there's a serious voter fraud problem until a voter fraud problem is created. It doesn't exist. Ignore every word he says. EVERY WORD.
Yep Trump put covid patients into nursing homes.  Stupid comment
Polling gave Clinton a 3-point lead in Michigan, 2 points in Pennsylvania and showed Trump narrowly winning Florida. Only Wisconsin was wildly off at 6¬Ω points.  Biden has an 8-point lead in MI, 7 in FL, and 6 in PA. Trump has no room to maneuver.
Fact. Mr. TRUMP

We (the sane voters in America) have been  stating that Trump is not  a legitimate president, but rather a Russian shill. Still, we have been stuck with his idiocy since Russia and fools put him in office.
Trump wants to delay the election but send 6 year olds back to kindergarten I cannot deal with this moldy cheeto anymore
Affordable care act called Obama care. Doesn't that sound better then the Trump virus that's right Trump u own it.
See this is the BS I'm talking about, this is in the Dems package and yet trump comes out and lie saying the Dems don't want to pass nothing it's in they're package not the repubs.
Trump's staff thought up a plan to get the headlines off of -32% GDP and the press took it hook, line, and sinker  The only people more gullible than Trump and his cronies are the press that are supposed to be holding him accountable

"President Trump needs to be told by every Republican in Congress that he cannot postpone the federal election. Doing so would be illegal, unconstitutional and without precedent in American history. Anyone who says otherwise should never be elected to Congress again."
So. Let's do it again. #ImpeachTrumpAgain  Trump Might Try to Postpone the Election. That‚Äôs Unconstitutional.
Trump thinks he‚Äôs going to lose, so he like a true narcissist is going to burn everything down on his way out. Buckle up! #trumppresser
No, he‚Äôs more stupid than a fence post. Though, Peter Navarro disagrees with me. He said Trump is one of the smartest people he knows.
Couldn‚Äôt be respectful during his comments for Lewis and had to slam his successor President Trump. Obama as a lying, cheating,spying President is a ‚ÄúFargin Bastish.‚Äù
Trump. Is. A. Adderall. Addict.
Time for the rallies to become anti trump rallies
Trump meets with family of Vanessa Guillen and pledges to help
VICE PRESIDENT PENCE IN PA.: The vice president made a campaign stop in western Pennsylvania today. Watch what he had to say during a "Cops For Trump" rally on CBSN Pittsburgh.
It explains how Trump was elected.
Since when is it a Federal responsibility to pay the salaries of local police????? It‚Äôs your job as the Mayor of Pittsbugh to be fiscally responsible with tax payer dollars to provide public safety service. Not the Federal Government ie Trump. DO YOUR JOB
I've always wanted to wear goggles lmao üò≠ jp
By finding someone with full mental capacity that's not propped up, Weekend at Bernie's style, talking some unintelligible nonsense. I'm not a Trump fan by any means, but at least he makes sense 12% of the time.
A great honor to join Vice President  and our great law enforcement officers at the ‚ÄúCops for Trump‚Äù rally today! BACK THE BLUE!
Everything      Including today when they parade Hussein out to campaign at the funeral  and then later a bunch of leftists blame our President for Herman Cain‚Äôs death  The whole 150000 deaths blamed on Trump is super annoying    I also can‚Äôt stand the riots
Guess you don‚Äôt listen to Trump or follow him on Twitter then.
This seems to be routine procedure in the Trump Administration, to forget which side of the fence you work for. You visiting SS graves and Trump allowing bounties on our troops by üá∑üá∫ going unpunished.
You are confusing Biden landslide with trump poopslide
VP Pence drew a crowd in Greensburg today of supporters including plenty of current and retired police from around the county:    For  w/  and   photos
Ah yes, because as we all know, Trump would NEVER violate the Constitution for his own personal benefit üôÑüôÑ
How is trump a dictator?
Trump just suggested we delay the election... my nigga... WHAT?! üòÇ
Fact-checking Trump's continued assault on mail-in voting and suggestions of delaying the election
Obama made his money on book sales.  Trump and his kids robbed the "charitable" Trump Foundation to help fund his campaign. "Mistakes"? Hardly. His kids are now banned from running a non-profit for their crimes.
Your projecting like trump! That bill has been on your desk for 10 weeks! Stop giving money to trump‚Äôs wish list and help struggling Americans! Republicans kept quiet instead of calling trump out on the seriousness of this pandemic! You are responsible for every death too.
I hate to say it, but this is just east of me, and yes...it is Trump country. Many rural areas are, even in Bluish states. This November the urban areas  will be blue, the rural red. Key will be the burbs...a lot of red in 2016 but could easily go blue in November.
cant wait for trump‚Äôs tweet about the NBA
Trump Might Try to Postpone the Election. That‚Äôs Unconstitutional.
Trump's crazy as h***.
I voted for Perot twice over Clinton, so nice try.    Obama? 11.5 million jobs created, Great Recession ended.  Trump? 8 million jobs lost in his term.  2nd Great Recession started.  Any questions?
This is great! I wondered what would happen.  A bunch of guys who probably never negotiated a contract in their lives tried to manaplain that such a scenario would not happen or that it would be the Pens because playoff games trump reg season Pirates games.

Reading the article, they referred to Trump relying on feckless Governors in the House of Representatives  to keep him in. So they lost me.
Hell ya!!! I MUST be able to VOTE on time.        ....I HATE TRUMP... !!!!
When's Trump's beautiful new health care plan being unveiled?
It isn't fascism if Trump has a 95% chance of losing in November.  Hitler and Mussolini never worried about being reelected.
He's also told to stay in office by his boss, Putin. I bet he's afraid he'll be killed if he loses the election.  Putin put millions of dollars into making Trump president
You are the most egotistical of wind on Twitter. Except maybe for Donald J Trump
Wow! He got this presumably from Trump's Tulsa rally. He was there, maskless with no social distancing. He got sick and tested covid-19 positive. Now he has died. This is on Trump &amp; the stupidity that is the GOP!
He makes me very uncomfortable.
Why do "some' people I follow who are supposed to be conservatives and for Pres. Trump liking liberals tweets that are negative remarks towards the President? #fakeConservatives
I am unsure how Biden got a reputation as a more decent person than Trump: there's sniffing, mass plagiarism, segregation/Confederate support, and name calling supporters. He's quoted Mao + Muhammads call to Jihad.   There's the Tara Reade issue as well. Just vote policy, lol.
what did you do to your face? Bwahahahahahaha  and you paid for that? Bwahahahahaha
It was the a Trump Virus.
Why is Ari even talking about Trump moving the election,  we know he can't.  So talk about the economy or the stimulus package.  Falling down on the job lately,  Ari. Get with the program
Never, because everyone knows I‚Äôll vote for Trump. As a matter of fact the way the Democrats, I‚Äôve decided to do what Dems do when they vote. That is they walk in and pull the ‚ÄòD‚Äô lever, only I‚Äôll pull the Republican lever
Herman Cain is responsible for his own death by stupidity, but Trump helped... I wish we knew how many more died from that cult rally...
Yes!!  Move it up .  Why wait?  Let‚Äôs get it over with.  Maybe Air Force One‚Äôs last Trump trip will be one way to Moscow.
Trump is disgusting, still lying about everything , with covid19 and he knows it's a real recession is going down but touting fake job numbers like there's no bottom for trump.
No he‚Äôs not. He has no plan. He has hyperbole and lies. Also, I don‚Äôt remember China making trump not do anything during the 1st 2 months of the year. I don‚Äôt remember China make him screw up testing. I don‚Äôt remember China say we had 15 cases and we‚Äôll be down to zero soon.
I‚Äôve never witnessed any man being so insanely jealous of another man as trump is with Obama! It‚Äôs just weird!
Everything trump said about the stimulus was a lie none of that BS he was saying wasn't even in the repubs package, fact checking is key with this lying a** dude and a shame that fact checking has to even take place, the Dems are the ones working for the entire republic.
Be sure to download the latest episode of #PittsburghExplainer with  Friday morning. On tomorrow's show: PPS weighs its options, Trump's white base shrinks in Pennsylvania and local activists face charges related to recent protests.
Trump just said that mail in votes are immensely fraudulent. THAT FULLY EXPLAINS  2016 ELECTION RESULTS: The total number of voters who voted early, absentee or by mail more than doubled from 24.9 million in 2004 to 57.2 million in 2016. "Step Down asshat!"
He was better, way better than trump
Trump is incompetent but this is ridiculous: not a *single* word about nonstop protests, despite biggest jump occurring among youth and minorities who disproportionately attend protests. Mentioning state failures in passing, despite them having police powers. Deflection &amp; spin.
Yo Trump literally avoids answering any question directly
‚ÄúCourthouses are psychologically important,‚Äù said Trump on national television.   üò≥
I believe in Jesus Christ as well and I cannot believe that Jesus, alive today, would vote for trump.

trump keeps saying it could take ‚Äúyears‚Äù to correctly count the votes and find out who actually won the election

A have a headache from listening to Trump‚Äôs miserable attempt to read aloud.

There hasn‚Äôt been a President for Black people. The truth is the truth. We hold no allegiance to anyone. Why is it up to us to get this country out of the shit it proudly got itself into. The country got Trump because of proud racism, prejudice, and bigotry. Deal with that first.

Im not voting for Trump
We went to the lake right near this today . It‚Äôs deep trump country out there .
do you think Joe Biden is a viable candidate ? I hate trump, but seeing control by the Dems Party (choose a senile  man over Bernie, or Yang). Along with ignorant hate your displaying. Is sadly what has become the Democratic Party.  +
I guess she had to say something to appease Trump.
All the facts and lists of wrongdoing of Trump and his gang are making me dizzy and confused! Sure you are all right! BUT ENOUGH ALREADY! GET OFF YOUR BUMS AND GRANDSTANDS AND INVOKE THE 25TH AMENDMENT!! DON'T WORRY, PENCE WON'T GET RE-ELECTED.

Opinion | Obama‚Äôs rousing speech trolls Trump: Who‚Äôs the impostor now? By Greg Sargent
Look, I fully admit my biases are talking. But I think the so-called Project Veritas video showing "Trump on a Hot Mic" is a hilarious ratf#ck. Both on Trump and PV. (It also sounds like  Trump to me. "Hills Have Eyes people" sounds like one of his.)
Booooo. Pirates trump sucks! Booooooo
#Bullshit I‚Äôm really tired of Republicants trying to cover for Trump by claiming his words or tweets were ‚ÄúJUST JOKES!‚Äù     If his words were jokes - let him come out and say it . We all know dammned well that he knew exactly what he was saying. I‚Äôve been predicting it!

Fact: If you are brazenly touting that you are "WINNING SO HUGELY", and you actually believe it to be true, you would NEVER seek to postpone the "Big Win".  Trump finally admitted today that he knows he is losing, and he will do anything to try to stop that. Good luck, America.
Oh and by the way  Trump‚Äôs Postmaster saying to slow the mail down in an election year doesn‚Äôt seem to bother you either.
Trump is close to full panic and like a cornered rat he will be ver dangerous. Be ready for the absurd .
Trump went on to downplay the virus. He then made states play Hunger Games for PPE. He then went on to downplay the virus more. He then played golf and had multiple rallies. He then pushed to open the economy to early. His incompetence has led to 154K dead Americans.
"Let our consciences be our guide." There are not nearly enough Republicans left like Tom Ridge - people of conscience who stand up to injustice even when it comes from members of their own party. Sadly the current  is full of boot-licking sycophants.

A Poem:  Dump Trump.   The end.
I am a Pennsylvania Republican who was happy with Bill Scranton and his fellows. I respect your choices and  your honesty but I see the company Mr. Biden keeps and am very concerned that a vote for Biden is a vote for AOC, Omar, Pressley and chaos. I will be voting for Trump.

All I said was it isn‚Äôt just a talking point. It‚Äôs the truth. Of course Trump should defend Americans
You like to make a lot of assumptions without any facts. You just believe these Doctors coming out now because they support your biased support for Trump. You only read the studies that support your point of view. I will stick to actual medical evidence.
Trump is a lying TRAITOR to the United States!!!!
trump is lying again!!!! What a loser!!!
These clowns are willing to take the whole ship down in order to show trump how loyal they are
Nanc when Trump wins you‚Äôll be the 2nd person he talks to! Get your affairs in order! And BTW Bless Your Heart!
Trump always supports people whom share his views, reality, and bizarre claims.
Presidents Trump‚Äôs continued infatuation with Putin is a direct threat to U.S. national security ‚Äì as evidenced by the fact that he did not raise an issue that has direct implications for the lives of US servicemembers with the government accused of orchestrating these killings.
Before Trump leaves office let‚Äôs give Russia an opening to Europe and NATO. He is pure evil!
The are so many crazy dysfunctional things going on apart from the Trump show, but people who hate Trump, for whatever reason, are choosing to not see it right now. Its frustrating.  Only Trump matters, but there are crazy things that will matter long after he's gone.
Change in town like how he refused to ask putin to stop paying people to kill American soldiers?  Trump only cares about two things. Himself and protecting himself from whatever the Russians have on him
you are just another wannabe hack, like Voight.  Always looking for favor from your 'king'.  Part of the 'elite' that tRump believed himself a part of as well until they threw him out with the trash.
Lmfao always trying to discredit Trump or the people he backs. It‚Äôs sad. The liberals have the minds of a child! Maybe make some real changes by trying to work with Trump instead of being a baby back b**** because you didn‚Äôt get your way
Trump supporters vandalized #BlackLivesMatter mural.
Is there anyone more corrupt than Barr and the trump family? Maybe Putin and bin Salman? Great company
It‚Äôs not just a talking point though. I despise Donald Trump, but that is what happened in the 80‚Äôs. We shouldn‚Äôt be cool with Russians paying to kill our guys, but let‚Äôs be clear that this has been happening on both sides for a while
Trump's America is scary
Welcome to the Trump America
If the Dems don‚Äôt want President Trump to use the destruction of Federal facilities as a campaign topic they should clean up their cities, then he won‚Äôt have that to use. Make sense?
This video, completely unedited, is a strong ad against trump
hey Peter the fact is the President Trump is an a-hole and he can Tippy tap around all the political questions you want it's people like you and people like him that don't make any sense and are bad for the American people

'US President Donald Trump has again defended the use of hydroxychloroquine to ward off coronavirus, contradicting his own public health officials. He said the malaria medication was only rejected as a Covid-19 treatment because he had recommended its use.
Beautifully written, but his money and power adds fear to the populace that he can cost many of us real harm... if allowed to run a presidential campaign, he could siphon off enough votes to give trump 4 more years.

Trump's anti-Biden commercials say that if Biden wins there won't be any police and no one will be safe. Meanwhile in Trump's world now, the police that currently exist aren't being fair and equal to anyone.

illegal guys, it's illegal to shit talk Trump on Twitter now apparently
If for no other reason,  America is increasingly sick of trump passing blame to everyone.  We need a leader who'll step up, take charge...AND LEAD.  Right or wrong, we need someone to follow.  As long as the person does what he thinks best for the country.  And if wrong, say so!
In Trump World, there's no difference between governing &amp; campaigning!
too many in Trumps camp would rather win the battle over hydroxychloroquine, than win the election in November.   They want Trump vindicated, more than they want him re-elected.
Steady there mr trump....Twitter got you where you're at.   And everyone has figured out how to use it against your re-election.  Can't stand the heat, get out of .............................................
Doesn't he have more important things to do...like bring trump another Diet Coke or something.....
Some logic.  Then ANY men 67 or older, that are CONVICTED by a JURY, should be pardoned by the President.  His blind loyalty to trump and NOT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE is SICKENING

Trump is not going to win. He hasn't grown.  He is a victim of his supporters and enablers and of his own ego.  True conservatives need to pivot NOW away from supporting him, to supporting conservatism.  They need to call out Trump nonsense. History will vindicate them.

You‚Äôre an expert on grifting, Dave! Trump said the trends on Twitter is illegal. Surely you‚Äôre against him trying to turn the dial of ideas to the cold position
So trump is going to be tweeting about #Hydroxychloroquine  all day tomorrow... essentially taking us backward another 2 months.
And make Trump keep spending to stem the tide. I think I read that almost 20% of the web budget is now allocated to Texas. Texas?!?

trump was a registered Democrat until a few years ago. Their voter registration has nothing to do with them both trafficking in resentment and lacking the skill to do anything but be petulant trolls
Trump will never see the similarities no matter how much they mirror each other. It's all a scheme by the Democrats to win the election - sneaky Biden convinced China to shut down the world just to oust him. But shhhh... It's supposed to be a secret. #TrumpIsACompleteFailure
If Trump would have been a REAL LEADER he would have worn a mask from the beginning and shut down the entire country at once. Did he lead by example, no he let his ego control everything and that includes his lying mouth.
Tony, I admire your willingness to speak out.  I wish no one ill.  But writing this article is not enuf.  NOW do you see the cynical irresponsibility of Trump‚Äôs and Repubs?  Can you understand that all the lame excuses show not a spread of empathy?

Let trump start bragging about how "he's done more for black people than any President is history".  And he can't take out an hour, and pay THE COUNTRIES respects to a deceased US Senator??
He uses the highest estimates or the lowest estimates in order to spin the actual numbers positively.  Example, COVID19 Death Estimates for worst-case scenario.  Trump ignored the estimate until realizing he could use it against the actual deaths now.
Tonight I'll be joining  to discuss how, with President Trump in court trying to do what Republicans failed to do legislatively three years ago and the #COVID19 crisis continuing to rage across the country, the stakes have never been higher to protect the ACA.

They are hurting Trump as long as he does nothing to stop them.  He looks extremely weak if all he does is Tweet Law and Order 10 times a day while doing nothing.  Feds arresting people in Portland was long overdue.  Now let's see how long their sentences are.
The things trump has said.  Alleged to have done.  How he bullies/humiliates/belittles people and they want HIM to be head???  Sickening.
Yet people like Clay and trump live in fear of immigrants and Muslims for no rational reason other than they‚Äôre different looking / sounding, in spite of the fact that they enrich our country. When asked why, they point at their disproportionately low risk of violence.

It's TRUE! CONGRATULATIONS!  You guys are really as rediculous as everyone told be.  Voter fraud?  Yeah...voting for Trump is absolutely fraud.  That's something I can get behind.
Do you even hear yourself?  You do realize that not everything is some twisted conspiracy.   There is nothing at All wrong with voting by mail.  Especially with a virus raging across the US because of a complete lack of a unified Federal response.  Trump HAS TO GO!
The problem was Trump, not McConnell.  The current R party would drop McConnell if Trump told them to.

You are not a Dem or Independent.  You watch Fox news, thats evident.  Trump and Fox are spewing the narrative that we will not have police. Defunding the police does not mean getting rid if them!! It means some of ghe budget will go toward educating and training them.

Got to get everyone out to vote too many Trump signs for my liking around. Joe needs to get his VP and get some signs going
The divide has been there. The systemic problems have been there. Trump caused none. He did put it all on display though. The rest put on the show. Joe is doing it now. Remember, I'm not a trumpie. I blame all of them that have been there for prolong periods of time. Both sides
Wait, so Trump is vindicated now for suggesting we look into this a few months ago, right?   Liberals will believe science in a liberal media outlet but if a doctor in a conservative outlet mentions the same thing, then it‚Äôs disgusting and fake news?
There are no narratives. Ever. Trump is responsible for every death. Cuomo is responsible for every life saved. The virus is highly transmissible. After 7 months of unprecedented testing, 1.2% of the population tested positive. Cloth stops the virus. No narratives.

Could we just have Barack Obama as POTUS again, just for a little while? I could listen to him forever. With Trump, I need to turn the TV off. Can't stand his voice. Just saying.
maybe, but I'd bet less than you think. I think its a real short list of folks who are on the fence with Biden but would be swayed by VP. Most folks on the left at this point know either they won't be feeding the machine or they can't sit by with Trump as the opponent.

You're off your nut about a mile and a half. How is Massive advocating for Congress to take responsibility and ownership - since it is LITERALLY their job to enact legislation and spending - instead of just blaming Trump, considered "selfish"? Congress should step up to the plate

Maybe I‚Äôm not stupid enough to get it. Trump will make America safe again?  Who‚Äôs president and why isn‚Äôt it safe already? It was when the last guy left office.
Trust me we need to be de-turd. We must remove Trump and all his minions.
Trump killed Herman Cain.
I knew the Dems would be up to no good when they starter to claim that President Trump told people to inject or ingest cleansers. They however would benefit greatly from gargling  with copious amounts of Listerine. I can smell their fetid breath through the TV.
What worries me is not whether or not Trump wins, or cancels the election, but what petty, vindictive and destructive executive orders he will issue when he realizes he has lost and still has 2 months left.

Trump is gonna leave the White House kicking and screaming and it's going to be about as successful as the film Kicking and Screaming from 2005.
As of today, we now know trump is desperate and salty due to biden winnng the polls and his polling averages were oversampled/overpolled and didnt actual real primary elections his actual vote count was worse than any poll.
I usually hate it when people say that Trump‚Äôs actions are a distraction from something else, but it‚Äôs too much of a coincidence that he tweets about delaying the election at the exact moment news breaks of the worst economic quarter on record.

If he were capable of it, Trump could have been the hero by addressing the pandemic with strong federal leadership and compassionate financial support for the people of our nation.  Instead, because he is simply incapable of it, he will suffer the eternal ridicule of history.

You might think that this "Nobody likes Trump" is cute! Let me tell you that only a non-thinking individual can come up with this kind of statement!  Many people do like Trump!   In 2016, around 63 million voted for him! In 2020, many millions are going to vote for him again!
How about ABC, NPR, NBC, all fake right? FOX is the most FAKE NEWS THERE IS! And Trump of course! He has people so fooled. He may be a moron but don‚Äôt think he didn‚Äôt come up with this ‚ÄúDeep State‚Äù crap and ‚ÄúQ‚Äùand any other outrageous crap that he uses to take the blame for him.

Why Trump Has No Power to Delay the 2020 Election
My husband didn‚Äôt believe my ramblings before Trump was elected.  He does now.
Senators &amp; Congresspeople have made statements in opposition to Mr. Trump's call for delaying the election. No such statement on Senator Toomey's twitterfeed. I hope reporters will ask him about this.
it also spreads a falsehood that absentee voting by mail is not accurate---though I have heard many in Washington, including several Trump family members--have used vote by mail without any complaint!
Mr. Trump dropped the concept of delaying the election because:  1) Mc Connell &amp; others are worried 2)he's thinking if he could make not wearing a mask seem to some like a liberty issue, why not fabricate something about vote by mail, &amp; conflate both issues? 3) attention  4)___?

He‚Äôs baiting ALL of you.  There will miraculously be a vaccine before the election and Hydroxychloroquine will be used as a prophylactic. He will sign an EO for voter ID. Cases will decline and states must rescind their mandates and EO‚Äôs. Trump in a landslide.
What is sad, Trump is planting the seeds, that he &amp; Barr will contest this election &amp; try &amp; take it to the courts saying it was voter fraud. He'll take it to his inexperience judges that will vote his way..
Trump‚Äôs suggestion about postponing the election is about invalidating our electoral integrity &amp; voter suppression. He wants as few people voting by mail as possible and wants us all questioning the results (unless he wins).  Goodness do we need to get rid of this administration.
