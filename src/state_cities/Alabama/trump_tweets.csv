Why is there a JOE BIDEN, NANCY PELOSI, CHUCK SCHUMER? Biden started it about Christians before Trump brought attention to Biden!!!! Now Schumer is flipping the ideology against Trump as starting it on religion.

It was in their best interest to get a deal. Now you just hand a win to Trump.
What can we do? Trump and his butt plugs are operating on the ‚Äúkitchen sink,‚Äù strategy they are willing to do anything and everything in to win by any means necessary. The repugnant party is complicit in their silence and behind the scenes actions. We cannot not survive 4more yes
IMO, Trump is horrible for Whites. MAGA doesn't consider him an ally. They are not paying attention to him. Also, it is mainstream conservatism that has marginalized him. Empowering conservatives just means more tax cuts and wars

Without a new law passed before Nov, PA doesn't allow (likely Dem-leaning) absentee ballot to be tallied until polls fully close on EDay.    Which makes this tweet by trump ominous to say the least:
Lol bro being anti Biden isn't being pro Trump.  This was fun though, take care
trump's strategy in PA: -Polarize absentee voting so GOP voters go in-person. -Litigate the end of ballot drop boxes so Dem voters who vote absentee are forced to use USPS.  -Corrupt USPS so ballots don't arrive by EDay.
Republicans were never going to agree to the Democrats stimulus plan or even negotiate with them. They were always going to shoot it down so Trump can do what he wants through executive order and call himself the hero.
Democrats want to give Americans $600 a week to help them through the pandemic.   Trump and his Republicans do not.   That‚Äôs all this is. Everything else is smoke and mirrors.
Just be honest Joey, and say ‚Äúbecause I hate Trump‚Äù, because we all know you do.
If people had listened to Trump in March, instead of shutdown the information that HCQ was a game changer. Many people who are now lost forever, would be walking around living life. Willful ignorance = negligent homicide.
Trump wants the glory of issuing Executive Orders (which may/not provide any real relief) for re-election purposes.

This is my view of Democrats. They were always nutty, but Trump pushed them off their ledge. Now they are total loons.
Dr. Fauci fooled a lot of ppl. They planned the üí© out well. Dr. Fauci SEEMED to have been against tRump in the beginning, but it was an optic illusion. He was to gain the trust of the ppl. That lady in that video warned us about him. DR. FAUCI IS NOW SAYING THAT THEY ARE GOING
Exactly. And the Trump dictatorship is so extreme that criminals like Comey, Clinton and Brennan have not been arrested and charged. And a Democrat judge will not dismiss charges against general Flynn after the prosecutors admitted that the FBI framed him.
I will vote for Donald Trump without reservation. He has been a breath of fresh air in corrupt Washington. If the Democrats are so wonderful how have Pelosi, Schumer and Biden have been there 40-50 years and the problems are all Trump‚Äôs fault..

If Trump comes up with a lot of asinine rules, he probably will be ignored by the outlet. Plus Biden won't bother debating with him. Which will hurt Trump more, given today's polling.
I understand but the stuff they say incites far right groups to action. Remember how Trump rallied his followers to act on the governor in Michigan? That was dangerous, what the man motivated to send pipe bomb to his enemies? Free speech has limits

The fact that he could say that is proof he needs to be off the air. Trump has been married 3 times had an affair on all 3 wives including his present one. Told 20,000 lies, paid off a porn star and mistress asked a country to investigate his rival but Obama is sleazy.
How did you draw that conclusion? No, that‚Äôs not what I am saying, HOWEVER, they need to FEEL like they lost our demographic, because w/ SOME, it‚Äôs the ONLY way they appreciate what they have. My conscience wouldn‚Äôt allow me 2 do NOTHING, re getting Trump out
Exactly, Democrats need to stop encouraging this step-aside garbage and maybe think things through for once. Pence would be a formidable candidate and I think has been the de facto president for much of the Trump administration.

If you have to ask is Trump a fascist after seeing a tweet like today's, calling to delay the election....I don‚Äôt understand the positives Trump voters saw in Donald Trump in 2016 that they refuse to support him this time around. I can‚Äôt believe it took a pandemic to change their attitude about this man.  Now reality has hit them and their families. We warned them.

And for my final play for this week (this may be one of my last ever): They say stockcharts can predict the future. If true what we may see first of the week is some pressure when the Dems threaten to prevent Trump from his EOs given tonight. They then become the bad guy.(1/3)
Biden has a speech impediment making it hard for him to say some words. Trump has well we don‚Äôt want he has.
Look at all the privileged ass hats in the replies saying they won't vote for Biden because he's "just as bad as Trump". There is exactly ONE way to get Trump out of office. Vote for Biden and continue to support other progressive candidates for Congress.
Agree, it's better to assess the entire package of any candidate. If the bad greatly overwhelms the good, as I think it does for Trump, then don‚Äôt vote for him even if you can‚Äôt stand his opponent.

Trump has defended his appt of several billionaires to his cabinet by saying, ‚ÄúIn those particular positions, I just didn‚Äôt want a poor person.‚Äù James 2:4 ‚Äúthat when we show partiality to the wealthy, we become ‚Äújudges with evil thoughts‚Äù #Biblicalidiot

Republicans are already talking about attacking Kamala Harris if she is picked. I suspect Trump will pull off his schoolyard bully-pulpit to attack her personally.   Susan Rice is who they really want to ambush. They have nothing to run on about Kamala.   Bring it bitch.

Coming from someone who fell hook, line, and sinker for the #RussiaHoax, thought the #MuellerReport was going to be the end of Trump, was convinced the #Impeachment was based on fact, and still owes me $40 for being wrong on all of it. So who‚Äôs the dummy?
I never said anyone was bad people. Your comments implied that just bc someone may vote for Trump that they will fall in line &amp; vote for Tubs &amp; I disagree. What does he stand for other than to put his stamp on anything Trump says? What has he done for the people of AL?
That‚Äôs me giving people the benefit of the doubt that they‚Äôll vote for someone who has actually done things for the state of AL &amp; is talking about real issues/solutions...&amp; not someone who doesn‚Äôt really live in AL &amp; has no original thought or real position other than ‚ÄútRuMp‚Äù.

The media is adamantly trying to argue that Trump may question the election results and not leave office. What they should be covering is the reaction of BLM and Antifa rioters when he wins. I honestly wonder how our cities will deal with that. But alas, journalists are silent.

You have officially lost it.  Trump lives rent-free in your head.  You are a great singer but you are way over the top with your hate.
Finding it hard to believe that Trump's MAGA supporters are not being negatively affected by the GOP stonewalling on COVID-19 aid package. More public awareness is needed to show that ALL of the problems we face came about on the GOP's WATCH!
Thinking that the source of this treatment is Trump's MAGA supporters who take his criticism of any public official as a 'go' ticket to do harm or even more pain! Cohen described it as Trump code, and there are many, many MAGAs out there to do Trump's bidding! For free!

So, Russia doesn't want Biden to win and China doesn't want Trump to win, according to ODNI.  Actually, that definitely makes sense. Biden would be more polite to China which they want for business/superpowering  and Russia wants Trump for business/foreign indifference. 1/2

I don't care if Trump went to Wharton or any other institute of learning. The dude's understanding and use of the English language is on a 3rd grade level at absolute *best*.  And no, him being a well traveled con man doesn't make him smart at all. It makes him cold, and lucky.
Must be a Bernie Bro who doesn't realize that Biden has already apologized and clarified his statement from yesterday! One hell of a lot more than your favorite, Trump, is even capable of doing! "Killing God?" "Killing the Bible?" Don't hear an apology from DJT for saying that!
Obama was cool and all but I wouldn't say I'm on """Team Obama""".  I'm more on Team Get Trump Out of Office as soon as Humanly Possible omg Why won't he just resign 85ish days is too damn long oh wait he's president until January 20th God help us all.  Too long a name?
If Biden, a proven multi-liar, chooses Rice, another multi-liar, the Trump campaign will be in nirvana..... I say this as a NeverTrumper.
Man, the Bernie Bros and Russian bots are out in force today! They must be bored as Trump hasn't done anything stupid enough today to blame on Biden! (But it's only 1:30 PM CDT!)

Trump's payroll tax proposal is a bad idea and probably illegal
Is this a new campaign hat authorized by Trump himself? Based on what he and the GOP have done to our country over the past eight months, it's a perfect fit! When does it go on sale? His MAGAs and evangelical supporters will buy them up fastly!
And Trump thought Thailand was pronounced Thighland! Your point?
Careful "taking the bait" responding to Trump criticism. Your clarification was good and needed but you can't respond everytime Trump raises his ugly head out of Putin's ass or Fox News.
It would certainly seem like that! He's tried to start other culture wars, so what would be different than a religious war? After all, he has the evangelicals led by F. Graham and Jerry Falwell, Jr. as his top generals, the latter who can't keep his pants zipped just like Trump!
Not sure what your point of view is, but the COVID-19 has been here since January and the GOP knew it was here but did nothing. Sens. Burr &amp; Loeffler sold of stocks at a profit in February! They knew, but did nothing! Do you want 4 more years of misery under Trump? Seems so!

Isn't this, by definition an oxymoron? (Referring to Trump of course, NOT biden!)
If Biden had that kind of power, Trump would be in a straight jacket encased in a padded cell that uses barb wire as its wall! His 'meals' would be MacD' and KFC washed down with hydoxyclean in liquid form! But, alas, Biden wouldn't use his power in this manner! He's a nice guy!
That state will be very close no question. Obviously, I think it will be much smaller than his 9 point win (smaller than McCain and Romney who won by double digits in 2008 and 2012). Between OH, IA, TX, GA and NC, I think Trump‚Äôs weakest one is NC which could really flip.
Good point about convention bounces. If anything is to be determined from this, there will be some tightening but in the end, Trump will lose (EVEN in the press-revered Electoral College).

That's inane. What's to say Trump would get the votes of those who instead decide to vote third party or write-in? I actually have a poll showing most people who would vote for a third choice will instead vote Biden if they see no third choice.

So you're voting for trump.
This is really idiocracy. He really is the candidate. It's not a dream. The rumors of a long range plan to make a black woman the next president seem too true. People will truly be voting Trump vs Biden's running mate.
Interesting that Justice Roberts has offended both Obama and Trump with his rulings.
And let us make no mistake: This happens on the GOP's watch, under Trump, and the economy will only crater faster and deeper bc of their ignorance and self-serving political and economic incompetence! And we KNOW the dems are working FOR us and the GOP isn't!

And even if someone gives them money and doesn't care that they're just lining the pockets of Wayne LePierre and Trump, that's still fraudulent and must be stopped.
Mr. Obama: Yesterday on CNN, Mark Meadows proclaimed that our voting is a "privilege" and NOT a right! Meadows is Trump's Chief of Staff so it must be assumed that Trump's views on voting are the same as Meadows. How is this not an attack on our rights under the Constitution?
FYI: Mark Meadows said yesterday, on CNN, that our voting is a 'privilege' and NOT a right! John Lewis is barely in his grave and Meadows, along with Trump and the GOP, is trashing everything that he stood for and risked his life!
I do see the guy that says, "Man...I just may stay home cause Trump kinda let me down and fuck Biden..." -- to now being all "Well now I gotta vote cause they trying to take muh guns!" - That's my more concern. Why give them something they're that passionate about at this point?
Disgusting choice. Wondering with all of the xenophobic comments over the years if he has ever mentioned and antisemitic beliefs? Meaning that his leader has, so why not him? GOP would consider that a plus for his approval. And Trump does not like Merkle!
Actually he hasn't worked with the World Health Organization since the beginning of the pandemic here. Trump has effectively pushed back on data coming from them and has said he wants to take away the funds the US contributes.
Lately, pictures of McConnell have shown him as a broken man and the head of a broken GOP.  has titled one of his books: "Everything That Trump Touches...Dies" and these pics demonstrate the truth of Wilson's words!
Shame that Trump couldn't, or wouldn't, come up with a similar plan for Puerto Rico, an American territory with American citizens! But the majority of its citizens are brown skinned, so they are s**t-out-of-luck as far as the GOP and Trump are concerned! NO equality for them!
Trump wants to defund social security. No
Lie in order to get elected. But no, Trump does not show that he cares for the children by only saying send them back into a classroom knowing full well we haven't done anything to try to mitigate kids getting sick. Cases are already being reported in states that reopened class.
Kayne West is looking to replace Pence on Trump's ticket! Not sure whether that's a good thing or a bad thing! But will Kayne's wife Kim stoop so low as to take up residence in The Blair House? Would Kayne release their taxes? So many questions with no answers!
How does one become a 'pragmatic problem solver' when the same person is the problem? McSally is one of Trump's GOP and that is one of the largest problems that the true republicans, and the rest of us, face on November 3, 2020.
We will not be fooled by this trump operative
This should be a non story. He doesn't have time to get ballot access and unless his poll numbers are through the roof he will never get near a debate stage. This isn't about Biden or Trump, its a means to silence 3rd party candidates.

Free speech has limits. You can't scream "Fire" in a movie theater, for instance if there isn't one. The inaccurate information that Trump is giving to folks, is essentially doing the same thing. By telling people kids are basically immune to this virus, puts us all at risk.
At the mall once i heard a mother tell her son, "Things cost money. You can thank Donald Trump for that."

I find it hard to believe this is not going to be another gotcha moment for Trump.  He sets this stuff up to appear weak and then it all blows up in their faces.  Who knows?  His base is not having any of it and they‚Äôre ready to fight.
He has a pretty clear cut platform. Having said that, even if he didn‚Äôt have one it would still be better than the Democrats platform of ‚ÄúAnyone but Trump.‚Äù They‚Äôd nominate the Devil with a pedophile as his running mate so long as it‚Äôs not Trump. That‚Äôs beyond sad and immature

My guess is that it‚Äôs not alleging anything. Rather, whenever Trump &amp; Company is accused of anything bad, the first response is always ‚Äúbut _____ did it too/worse‚Äù, so this is probably just Team MAGA warning everyone about what they plan on doing after Trump loses.
Our entire existence as we know it is based on a fictional narrative set up by the FBI Mockingbird campaign all so trump could come 25 years later to save us from fake news?

So,  doesn't like vote-by-mail... EXCEPT in Florida, where is says it's necessary. Hypocrite much?         -
The projects are in democratic states and were trashed when Trump was elected!
We have seen this picture before and the MSM are into re-runs of 2016 this summer! Every network, including FOX is flooding us with polls that have absolutely no bearing on the 2020 election! NONE of them! Yet here we are again with a real potential of Trump winning again! SAD!

Trump fires TVA board chair after outsourcing uproar
Prefer to let them see my face!! I‚Äôm proud to VOTE TRUMP 2020 and VOTE RED IN EVERY ELECTION THROUGH NOVEMBER
If the GOP had any humanity they would remove Trump. He‚Äôs just an effect of a rotted party.
SRuhle sees the big "picture" in a rapidly "developing" Kodak situation...while Trump admin. would have us "gloss" over the details, it'll be over in a "flash" and the $ will no longer be the "focus"...we'll be left in the "dark"room with our "rolls" of hoarded toilet paper.
Imagine devoting your whole life to Donald Trump
Lmaooo üòÇüòÇ have you seen the papers where it says he has dementia?ü•¥ I would‚Äôve much preferred Bernie over any of them but he dropped out so ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è but i would literally rather have any other candidate except trump/kayne bunch of idiots fr
He‚Äôs far from the best candidate we‚Äôve got I‚Äôm not the biggest fan of Biden either but I would rather him over trump and or kayne ANY day of the year
beginning to look like Falwell is trying to emulate Donald Trump with his awkward social life. More and more pictures / videos are coming out, each one a little more risque. This while preaching and teaching evangelicals about the greatness of God! Oxymoron?
Best news interviews are not neat and full of soft ball questions.  did the best for his brand. But what did we learn? Little. Swan handed Trump an opportunity to praise Lewis and show his credentials on race. He turned it down and sounded obscenely ignorant.
President Trump‚Äôs latest complaint about states shifting toward voting by mail due to the spread of the coronavirus came days after he floated the possibility of delaying November‚Äôs election entirely.
is overdosing on her hydroxyclean again! He boss is trying to kill off the USPS, but a majority of the GOP needs the post office to exist if they stand any chance of election, or re-election, this November. And yet here we are! GOP vs Trump's GOP.
I.....hate Ygg but I can see where he was coming from.  Trump is massively ignorant and uneducated, and at this point dementia-laden, but like Reagan he was very smart when it came to manipulating humans.   Shows the limits and failures of using smart vs. dumb as our only measure
Reminder: Trump doesn't joke!
Trump turns on anyone who do not support him. Why should Mrs. Birx be surpised?
Gay Trump supporter arrested defacing Black Lives Matter mural for second time   THIS BOY ISN'T GAY HE IS SICK FOR SUPPORTING A PARTY AND A POTUS WHO WORKS EVERY DAY TO DENY HIM CIVIL RIGHTS AND JUSTICE.
If trump successes it down playing in the public mine and heart.   especially the Congress and people of color.    Then BLM and the rest has been a waste of time for over 70 years to date.
Trump Got Cooked in That Axios Interview
The quality of the  interview with Trump is objectively better than the  interview.
I still follow you even though I disagree with you at times for tweets like this. I have no problem calling out Democrats when they suck, and feel no alliance to the Democratic party. Also, it doesn‚Äôt take a raging liberal to come to the conclusion Trump should not be prez.
But FOX thought it was a great interview, though they won't run any of it without doing a lot of editing...a LOT of editing! Trump's propaganda network will soon be running out of good things to say about THEIR LEADER and then the real garbage talk will begin!
They've made me stronger in my commitment to President Trump. Love is definitely blind. Otherwise Kellyanne would have pinched that turd off long ago.
Thinking that the Trump campaign is trying to derail his re-election bid. The major retailers, Walmart, Target, CVS, and even our own military will revolt at this not-so-secret attempt start a cold war with China at their (and our) expense! Utter stupidity!
VOTE RED IN EVERY ELECTION THROUGH NOVEMBER. VOTE TRUMP 2020!!
I think my first sentence should have said ‚ÄúYou are making the same mistake Trump critics make‚Äù. Ha.
The last time Trump wished someone well he turned up dead in his 'protected' jail cell! And now we have to depend on AG Barr to 'protect' Maxwell? What could possibly go wrong?
And suddenly Trump demands our vaccine is brought forward. What a mess
You are doing the same mistake Trump critics do. Creating a bar so low, that it doesn‚Äôt take much to look like something is a win for the opponent. Happens with Trump all the time. People act like he should be praised for his brief moments of being a normal functioning adult.
VOTE RED IN EVERY ELECTION THROUGH NOVEMBER. VOTE TRUMP 2020
I've been saying Trump should withdraw from the re-election campaign. Scratch that. He should resign from the presidency now.
What a pathetic, ignorant, racist, SOB Trump is. Seriously.
America was much greater before Trump.
Thinking that if anything happens to Ghislaine Maxwell while in jail awaiting trial the blame should be placed squarely on AG William Barr. Another death like Jeffrey Epstein's would be unconscionable, yet this is where we are. Trump wishing her well is code for kill her!
Trump is such a coward he can't face the truth and has to use contrived graphs and "facts". He will never accept that he totally dropped the ball and lost the fight. He's responsible for so much death and suffering while he thanked the Chinese for their transparency.
TRUTH IS THE ENEMY OF TRUMP!
TRUTH IS THE ENEMY OF TRUMP!
Nice to see Sen. Grassley pontificating the Beatles' "Love is all you need" song from the 70's. Too bad he's forgotten the rest of the lyrics. Grassley and the GOP have allowed Trump to get away with every crime against humanity that he's done and he wants us to love him?
Who is more stupid than Trump? A trump follower.
Waiting on Kelleyanne or her surrogate Kayleigh to come out and announce that Trump just had the greatest interview with Axios. He was clear and concise in his message to the American people, then they walk back inside and gag on their words!
Trump is an idiot. The President should have taken firm control in February; unfortunately we don‚Äôt have a ‚Äúreal‚Äù President, only a ‚Äúreality TV‚Äù one.
Trump must think that he's Abe's doppelganger without John Wilkes Booth waiting in the wings wearing a MAGA hat and a swastika arm band.
If you think these things only became bad or corrupt because of Trump, then you‚Äôre just stupid
Isn't "Thou shall not kill" one of the 10 Commandments? Guessing not in the evangelical bible. So what do we call this 'have to due" statement from Trump? It's a little more serious than "Let them eat cake" from Marie Antoinette. What are Melania's thoughts? Or Ivanka's?If they like Trump or McMahon, no.
Trump wants his base to think he will do what Congress and Senate ought to.  And they will believe it. Once they hear his lie, they will stick with the desired belief, no matter what, &amp; Trump knows this.
Please please please QUIT being "in disbelief" about anything trump does. The man is pure evil. Hell he might kill 10 million people with nukes before he leaves office, and you are STILL capable of being "in disbelief" that he would stage a show at his club during a pandemic??
üëÄ üò≤shocking that there might be corruption üôÑ I‚Äôm calling it now that some trump affiliate buys tik tok too to access any potential ‚Äúinformation‚Äù gathered. They don‚Äôt get to be/stay successful by being honest businessmen ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
That‚Äôs Trump for the next 200 years üòÇ
There's needs to be a law that overrides Executive Orders that a crooked president takes away things that upsets him personally. Trump is the example of abusing Executive Orders when certain things get under his skin,More like retaliation. #TrumpIsACompleteFailure
Huge news!!!  Trump announces executive order repealing prohibition!  Take that Rex Banner!
after Trump will never vote Republican again no matter who or what.
We must get trump OUT. The only way to do that is vote for BIDEN. Period. One of those 2 will be president.
For BIDEN. Unless you want another 4 years of trump.

Now playing  - POG Interview.mp3 Listen here:  #trump
Trump...Russia...GOP,Yep! They know they trying to make sure Trump gets reelected and trying to slow down the USPS to sabotage Mail-In voting and Moscow Mitch won't sign the bill to stop interference...Yeah,Everyone already connecting the dots together if not already.
Who does he he is? The rules of wearing a mask is  to keep us All safe.  Oh, I forgot,  Trump and Cruz,  along with their supporters don't care if we all get coronavirus and die.  As long as they aren't inconvenienced!
Trump and the Republicans prove once again that they don't care about American people.  They only care about the rich,  who actually received the tax breaks. Vote Democrat.
Seriously, where have you been the past 4 years? üòÇ These cult members of trump‚Äôs are like every crazy evangelical who gives ppl like Paula White their life‚Äôs savings. They‚Äôre happy for NRA and trump family to live in great wealth.
And y‚Äôall smear Trump 24:7... your Russia just on the other side of the table.
I‚Äôm still a believer that the Trump presidency is just a Nathan For You bit that‚Äôs gone too far
Upset with the president? It appears  is too. Here‚Äôs some raw footage of him speaking to donors about how ‚Äúpissed off at Donald Trump‚Äù he is because veterans aren‚Äôt receiving health care.
Carefully worded , he ‚Äúwent‚Äù to Wharton . Trump is dumb as a road lizard , as my dad would say ! üòÇüòÇ
No matter how hard life gets I‚Äôd never vote for trump or Kanye üóë ü§°

Trump praising success backwards, What's horrible for America is a success for him. It's official,He's sick in the head...and I'm not surprised at that and mainly the majority of this country. Getting rid of him will be the only way to save America from him &amp; his bullshit!
It must be nice to live in this fantasy world where people pretend ‚Äúabstaining‚Äù from the Presidential vote counts for anything other than a vote for Trump
Trump‚Äôs America: First to worst. ‚ÄòIt is what it is‚Äô
Please clarify.  Did the White House play  Live and Let Die, or is the  Trump Campaign playing it?
I am really confused. I‚Äôve no doubt Trump is racist. But  Trump‚Äôs crew is looking more like a minstrel show. I‚Äôd expect to see Lincoln Perry next.
(But most of the Catholics I know, the very conservative ones, aren‚Äôt in the Trump camp. They‚Äôre just off doing their own thing in the corner somewhere)
A woman is about as valuable to trump as a piece of gum stuck on the bottom of his shoe but many whyte women will line up to vote by the thousands .
I agree. But this is how Joe really thinks. He's not the savvy Obama makeover. He inserts his foot over and over because he doesn't measure his words like a really good politician does. Trump, he doesn't pretend to be a politician. He just wants to help America to be great!
what‚Äôs funnier: Donald Trump not knowing there/their/they‚Äôre or thinking he‚Äôs going to win the ‚ÄúBlack Vote‚Äù
We're still going to vote for Joe Biden! Trump had his chance, his goose is cooked! Trump knows if he doesn't win he's going to jail! Trump is nothing but a crook and we know it ! F-Trump!
One things for sure:  security concerns or not, a pandering career politician would never take such a risk. Our current #POTUS is putting the well-being of our people ahead of his own political interests. Pretty refreshing if you ask me. #Trump
Heck no! A pandering career politician would never take such a risk.  Our current #POTUS is putting the well-being of our people ahead of his own political interests. Pretty refreshing if you ask me. #Trump

Trump is bad at his job
Trump is the lowest human being using God and the Holy Bible to gain advantage over a political opponent. Peace through understanding üî•
That dont mean he doesnt support trump.
Trump losing more than his approval rating,He's losing his goddamn mind! "Hurt God"...Seriously?! Trump is literally making his own case that he's is a insane madman. 4 more years of this bullshit and God himself might just smite Trump. #TrumpIsUnwell #TrumpIsANationalDisgrace
It is trump's party. Period. It is a party of disgusting racists. Period
Let‚Äôs see: a disgraced former football coach living high on the hog with taxpayer dollars; no experience or skill (such as it was) outside of football; no policy ideas; a Trump bootlicker. Sounds like the perfect Alabama Republican Senate candidate.
I thought Trump was just BSing but then I saw this photo of a young Biden.
No way he last that long, hell he can't come up with one sentence on his own that you can understand. He will not debate Trump. They picked the wrong man to lead their party.
He look like a trump supporter
Trump has been in little girls bathroom and bragged about seeing them naked .
What is/will be Facebook's role in misinformation attempts during the current election cycle?
If Joe Biden could decisively destroy the god worshiped by Trump‚Äôs supporters, he would be doing an inestimable service to America and the world.
The author of Rich Dad Poor Dad is problematic as hell and a Trump supporter. So....

I wouldn't vote for someone who's crazy like Kanye west! He needs to be in the crazy house talking about when he put on a maga hat he feels like super man what a idiot he is, but if he wants to waste his money let him , hell trump is just using his crazy ass!
The republicans kept on backing trump and now you guys want to to blame the democrats for all you guys bullshit and that's not right! Trump and you guys are going to pay at the polls so get ready! Trump and you guys killed a lot of Americans with all your lies!
I bet the NRA corruption is gonna be connected to Trump and the GOP that serves him. The puzzles are being pieced together,Something tells me Trump's fear of not getting re-elected &amp; losing will be the least of his worries and Deutsche Bank is another puzzle piece too.
Will the left-leaning national media jump all over Biden for this? I know if it were Trump they would....
What a godsend for the Trump campaign.üòãüî•üî•#KAG2020 #KAG2020LandslideVictory
This grandstanding politician is going to hurt the Biden cause.  Talk about something sure to fire up the Trump base, sheesh!üî•üî•

Definitely wouldn‚Äôt be my #1 choice. Unfortunately, he‚Äôs the only choice with the backing to get rid of Trump. üò©
At this point, I wanna fight everyone that voted for Trump.... cause we‚Äôre doomed
Trump,‚ÄùMy view is the schools should open.This thing is going away. It will go away like all things go away,&amp;my view is that schools should open.{THE FOLLOWING IS A LIE}Children are almost-I would almost say definitely-but almost immune from the disease.‚Äù Think you missed a quote
Question: does anybody in my Twittersphere still have family/loved ones who are supporting Trump right now? How are you holding them accountable for the state of our country right now? (Humor is welcome, but also I‚Äôm serious.)
So don't vote for pedo trump
Donald Trump and Joe Biden are both corrupt politicians. George Washington would have disapproved of them both.
I think the same thing when liberals cry about Trump.
Those consequences might finally be coming down on Trump. #ConsequencesForTrump

FAIR: Trump‚Äôs Tantrum Against TikTok Is No Laughing Matter -
Seems like a lot to point out a photoshopped picture. What‚Äôs the point if it happens all the the time? I don‚Äôt see that much concern when people get butthurt over photoshopped Trump pictures.
Trump treating his press conference like at TV show,Because that what is is. He's lies,Spread misinformation,and any other bullshit he can come up with because he's desperate for attention. Not surprising everyone already knows this! You know you can change the channel.
I talk a lot about being a virgin but honestly, I almost lost it in undergrad but changed my mind at the last minute. But lmao, call it blessed intuition because he turned into a trump supporter a few years later.   Also, i vet white men now.
Someone needs to tell him Alabama isn‚Äôt the opponent anymore. Wait until Trump finds out. He‚Äôs gonna be in sooooo much trouble.
Not to mention: there‚Äôs a snowball‚Äôs chance in hell Donald Trump can drive a stick.

It's time Trump has a nice long retirement.  Voting Biden.
Trump has Always been Jealous of Obama.  He continues to prove almost 4 years after the last election.
Trump is such a Liar and Fraud.  Americans are supposed to be so Dumb that we shouldn't figure out that the Only reason he approved mail in voting in Florida is because he fears losing due to Democrats huge numbers of requests to vote by mail.
Trump is his daddy
Putin has Trump on strings,Trump has GOP Senators &amp; GOP Congress on strings. At this point,They are too far gone and when you are too far gone you'll end up like those people in The Walking Dead.
As long as it help our 401-k good. They quit listening to Trump
Trump hates people that tells the truth or fact-checks him. He only wants me his words to matter,Not the reality of what's happening. He's proving his own case why he's unfit to be president the GOP &amp; MAGA knows this too but won't admit it. Everyone else is smart enough to notice
We need a counter for every time Trump says the words "fake news" because it seems that he has something to hide but it's not surprising because that "Hitler Playbook" exposing him w/o question. Everyone already knows those tricks is wearing themselves out.

Trump was NOT correct. We have 480 deaths per 1 mil population. The entire world has 87 deaths per 1 mil population. We are 7th worst out of 200 countries in deaths per capita. 193 countries better than us, only 7 worse.
We need a coherent Federal plan for getting through this. Three weeks ago Trump said he'd show us his health care plan "in two weeks."  Re: Cuomo, also abhorrent &amp; I won't defend it because, unlike some, I don't worship power &amp; excuse failure by pointing fingers elsewhere.
trump works?? üòÇ üòÇ üòÇ Works on his golf score, and he can't even accomplish that because he has the worst swing I've ever seen. I HATE golf, never play, and even I can hit straighter than he can. Jesus H. tap-dancing Christ at the prom, you bots think we üá∫üá∏ are stupid, huh?
Watch "Trump Humiliated In Worst Interview in History" on YouTube
Your insinuation was that most white rep. will vote Tuberville because he is a Trump puppet. That‚Äôs untrue. Most Alabamians vote for those that reflect their morals and values.  Sometimes it‚Äôs the lesser of two evils.  Insulting us because we believe different is immature.
Everyone in this country should know that your not only voting to get Trump out of office or vote his GOP &amp; MAGA enablers out,You're voting to save our country from them and their bullshit because we're not gonna put up for it for another 4 years,Hell No to that...VOTE IN NOV.!
Trump is trying to sabotage,cheat,&amp; steal the election! That is the best and easier way to say it because it's the truth. No Narratives,No Media Spins,No Conspiracy Theories,It's A Cold Hard Reality Fact! Everyone that wants him gone better vote like their life depends on it!
There‚Äôs absolutely no proof of that... testing is actually getting faster each and every week in most states.. slow testing falls on your state governments not Trump.
Nah. Only thing that would‚Äôve probably prevented that is an entire national lockdown.. and you would‚Äôve had an issue with that too. Trump is doing all he can from a government stand point.

This criticism assumes there‚Äôs no difference in confessing to a stranger on the phone that you‚Äôre a Trump supporter as Biden.   There‚Äôs a huge difference and it explains why polling might be off in one direction only. It‚Äôs the Doug Wilder effect.
Was sent this information feom the Trump administration. Recieved much more information aswell! See you in court!
Great work done by the Trump Administration!
Trump doesn't care about the thousands dying of Covid 19. He sure won't care if he is successful in stirring up some kind of trouble to get people killed on the streets to try to disrupt the election.
Imagine how Yosemite Sam would feel when he realizes that Trump mis-pronounced his name Yo-Semite.
Yes it was verified, thats not even debateable. Now ask yourself if you are okay with how trump has dismissed this fact repetively after admitting HIMSELF its true.
Lol. Lose to whom??  Put Biden under the same questioning and Trump will look fabulous. And it‚Äôs a 2 man race you know.
Absentee Voting is the exact same thing as Mail-in voting. Mail-in voting is secure in all 50 states, not just Florida, there has never been a case of massive voter fraud in America. Trump is just saying this about Florida because he wants to justify why he votes by Mail there.
I don‚Äôt see many Trump signs because people are afraid of being targeted... their cars and/or homes being vandalized.
that Trump interview üòÇüòÇüòÇ he really don‚Äôt give a fuck
Trump: We can't go by the cases because the cases are up due to increased testing.  Trump: our deaths are lower than the world. You have to go by the cases.  Sir, you can't have it both ways.
Trump sounds like a lot of you Twitter Doctors who think this is the common cold.
The John Lewis question was a softball any interviewer would‚Äôve thrown out ‚Äî easy to answer, easy to get right, literally requires just a few words. Trump didn‚Äôt have it in him.
Exactly. Trump has been remarkably blessed by his crazy unhinged enemies.
How long before they are tho?  It‚Äôs the non-Trump pols that seem the most eager to shut down anything resembling fun or normal life. UTAustin purported to ban parties yesterday!  Trump derangement seems to have turned libs into buzzkill Maude Flanders types. Amazing.
Trump had the goddamn nerve to say he done more for Black Americans than John Lewis. Keep his name out of your mouth you dumb orange bastard. Please everyone,Vote so we can get rid of that narcissist asshole. America can't not stand another 4 years of him! #TrumpIsAnIdiot
The thing that's obvious when you watch this is that   "he was in Congress"  "he's Black"  "he didn't come to my inauguration", and   "he's dead now"   is the *absolute sum total* of what Donald Trump knows about John Lewis.  Beyond that he has NO CLUE who they're talking about.
President Trump Just Called Out Two of the Media‚Äôs Most Dangerous Lies About COVID-19.
#YesWeCanAgain we will overcome after  is long gone. tRump prison bound!! Oh what a day that will be. I want normalcy back
But yet tRump demands our children go back to public school, he could careless about our children or any child....remember he has locked children I'm caged away from their parents and molested many young girls!!
It‚Äôs increasingly clear Trump is completely surrounded by True Believers in the White House, which is basically the most dangerous possible situation for both him and the country.
When did Biden say he was scared to debate Trump?
Trump is like
Trump just shows how dumb most Americans are. I'm glad I learned this lesson in my lifetime.
OMG! How dumb is this MF so-called president is! Trump is incapable of accepting the truth or a loss. Please vote his ass out in November I can't express that enough!
Trump is like Faust, except he traded America's soul to the Devil instead of his own.
Why does your tweet leave out that trump said "he didn't come to my inauguration"
i‚Äôm just saying if trump pushes the election i‚Äôm fighting in the civil war
Could there be a viable class action law suite by US citizens against Trump for his absolute failure to meet even the barest level of of competency for his job, etc., etc., as our president?
Trump is more of a cult leader than a president(if he ever was) and Trump's GOP Loyalists &amp; MAGAs people are his cult followers. With a dangerous cult like that,There's that one road for them and it's covered w/red all over it and I'm not taking about GOP or MAGA colors!
Maybe those MAGA &amp; GOP Idiots should ask Trump is he's too afraid to release his tax returns instead of creating conspiracy theories or any other bullshit. But then again I forgot that they rather turn a blind eye than face the truth because they are for Trump and not America!
Trump = FAKE NEWS.  Anyone who fails to tow THE PARTY LINE   COVID 19 is his enemy EVEN Leaders of the COVID 19 TASK FORCE SPEAKING TRUTH TO POWER.   Watch "Burnett: Trump calls Dr. Birx pathetic after she tells the truth" on YouTube
So I hear. I think they‚Äôre just Trump haters.

Do you hear yourself when you talk,I'm sorry you must be overdosed of the Trump Kool-Aid is affecting your common sense of reality.
Trump is counting on somebody stealing/cheating for him to win the election,That's the reality. His desperation and fear of mail-in voting shows that he knows it's a losing battle that could go either way for him. I'm voting to save America from him,You should to Americans!
The polls don't decide whether Trump approval ratings is up or down,That's for the America people to decide and given that majority of us already knows that he's a desperate loser that likes to keep himself in a bubble to keep out hearing the truth.
Trump will never admit that he's paying or bribing people to fake his approval numbers. Rasmussen for example,It purpose is to only get his MAGA &amp; right-wing stooges to get excited. Mostly everyone already seen this smoke &amp; mirrors trick so many times it we can read it w/E's!
üíµ üç© Isn‚Äôt this like the kiss of death? Oh my. Trump and Brooks. Plus all the financial scandals. And the loyalty issues. At least he‚Äôs republican in Alabama.
Can someone please educate me on why trump wants tik tok taken down? It seems so stupid with everything going on
Does Trump ever look in a mirror and ever think that he's the real "Enemy Of The People"? But I keep forgetting that he's to ignorant to admit that. He's really wearing out Hitler's playbook and the "enemy" does take orders from their puppet master, Putin. #TrumpIsLosing
Is that Trump flag waiting on a SpaceX splash down? #Nauticalscience not Pseudoscience
I certainly am. I hope God intervenes and Trump wins by a landslide
So afraid for our country! Trump is dangerous beyond anything I could have imagined as a president! Ala. has the highest positive Covid 19/Trump-virus rate in the country and Trump is still pushing lies &amp; confusion!
Will you name/list the job opportunities?  Where are all those fossil fuel job opportunities that trump promised?  Where is the new healthcare reform?
Why does trump hire so many pathetic losers in the first place. Does he EVER hire anyone who is any good at anything? So many times he told us he had "the best people". And there would be so much winning. But there's just LOSING and DEATH. worst president in history

that train works great if you can follow people but Twitter locked me down 6/2017 and won‚Äôt let me follow anyone because I love Trump and hate these commie idiots and Chinese crappers
You weren‚Äôt saying this stuff on 3/25/20.... you actually agreed with Trump and the Republicans saying that ‚ÄúTik Tok is a national security threat that should only be used to call out the Chinese government....‚Äù so,  what changed??? ü§°ü§°ü§°ü§°

I hope that the strongly suspected financial ties Trump likely has to the manufacture and sale of  hydroxychloroquine, are found out, that Trump is prosecuted for that corruption, and for the rest of his corruption.
Have theyw told trump that? Is he going to obey?  LOL what a ridiculously naive tweet. Dems need to vote IN PERSON EARLY
that won't work. Because trump won't play along. He will tell people he has won every state where he leads on election night and they will believe it and claim fraud when it changes. Mail in is a massively stupid idea. Vote early IN PERSON - with distancing and a mask
NOTHING the media says will change the fact that trump will claim victory in any state he leads on election night. Dems emphasizing mail in ballots instead of early IN PERSON voting (social distanced with a mask) is one of the stupidest moves EVER
Sorry dude,Your speaking Trump language. Not everyone else that is not blind.
While Trump's goons &amp; those GOP idiots trying to say violence has escalated in Portland since secret police left, Funny they must be crazy in the head,I see they been doing peaceful protest to mostly everyone else but that what people under Trump would say to push his agenda!

The only plan Trump's dumb ass has is golfing while the entire country is still in pandemic mode and silencing the 1st amendment because he can't handle the truth and he knows it! #TrumpIsLosing #TrumpHasNoPlan

Now more than ever, we need President Trump re-elected do he can continue to uncover all of you and  criminal activities
Lol. Sleepy Joe would have slept through it. The same guy that called Trump a racist for closing down travel from China esrly on? Keep drinking the kool aide.
How was your Trump dream last night? Is he paying rent for your brain? Lol.
...but voting third party in this election is essentially a vote for the current administration. We know 3rd party isn‚Äôt going to win, so in swing states in particular, it essentially ensures another 4 years of Trump, which is dangerous for vulnerable people.
LGBT are vulnerable with Trump/Pence. Black people. Undocumented people. Hispanic people. Children being torn from their families in ICE centers where they are denied proper medical care and are actively abused. It may not consciously have sinister intentions, I‚Äôd agree...
Sorry even when Nazis die, but maybe now some of his followers will start wearing masks.
Clinton only won it by 1.5%. 538's average has it at 0.7% redder than the national average. If there were an election today, Biden would win it, but if Trump makes up ground, it's certainly one of the states that he could win.
Hay trump is on drugs, it's called "lien".
Wow Trump is a American hero, 'Not' he's using them as props to make himself look good! If you notice Trump never looked at the lady who was crying, cause Trump has not feeling's for people who's hurting!
Fromm the very beginning trump has proved to be unqualified for the office. In contrast Hillary Clinton was over qualified. Don‚Äôt vote on promises! Vote for purpose and experience.

You've Wasted over 3 years of Not coming up with a Health Care Plan. America is ready to turn the channel on the Trump show. Voting Biden on November 3rd.
Trump doesn't want America to see the poor turnout for his nomination.  Many people will stay home and vote online.
Trump is right. Nobody does like him.  He will find out how True that is on November 3rd.
Golfing while America is dying from a preventable death,  if we had the right leadership. Voting Biden.  Time to Dump Trump.
So, different rules for the little rich boys. Trump is a hypocrite.
#YesWeCanAgain just as soon as tRump is gone....we can recover but may take a little while
You want a far left Dem to be the nominee, then convince more voters to agree with your position. We normal center left traditional Dems outnumber you, by a lot!! How many times do we have to prove it. Get trump elected again and the left will NEVER gain an inch in your lifetime
So....we should be more Christ like and support Biden who likes groping kids....all I'm hearing out of liberal nut jobs is pedofiles are okay. As long as they aren't Trump you'll take anything. Also Jesus taught us to love one another not hate your fellow man
Really cause your precious Fauci said he believes Trump prevented a lot of deaths. But tell us since you're an expert what would you have done differently....
I sometimes wonder how the day Trump dies will be. I lowkey don‚Äôt even see him as a human being. The internet might crash like it did when Michael Jackson died except it won‚Äôt be from people searching out of sadness and shock. It‚Äôs gonna be a whole lotta ‚ÄúGO!! GO!! GO!!‚Äù energy.
Wait, do people actually believe this?  I thought everyone knew anyone attributing Sarah Cooper to Trump banning Tik Tok was a joke.
You‚Äôre right. The problem is, Joe is just a miserable person. Trump runs through his head 24/7. What a miserable way to live
Trump was not and is not terrified of Bernie. Trump wanted to run against Bernie so bad he could not contain his excitement at the thought of it, and his anger that it ended up being Biden. The capacity you bernie supporters have for delusion is scary
They really have a problem with messaging.  According to Trump, if they didn't test, then there would be zero cases in Congress.
You're literally telling people if they don't vote Trump, they're voting for evil.  Don't you claim to be a "freethinker" or some dumb shit?
Honey, that was straight up the work of the Clinton‚Äôs and the Royals. How many times was Trump on Epstein‚Äôs flight logs?

He‚Äôs a clown enjoying his new fame. I‚Äôm not defending Trump, but it‚Äôs long past time to put Fauci out to pasture.  ‚ÄúCould change‚Äù my ass.  Either he knew it would or he‚Äôs incompetent.  Hell I thought it would be a problem in January just from reading about the Ch Dr whistleblower
Trump makes it clear how he feels about pedo island back in feb 2015

Trump doesn‚Äôt send police protection to Republican cities because we don‚Äôt tolerate Antifa and violence. Simple facts.
Explain to me how Trump responsible for a pandemic that originated in China? Pelosi was partying in Chinatown and blasting Trump &amp; Fauci‚Äôs recommendations to shelter in place. Covid has been rampant without restraint when social distancing was ignored. Personal responsibility.
I understand your fear about returning to the classroom. Covid has been hard to get under control. Fauci led the charge with guidelines and Birx followed in lock step. Both of them are Democrats. Trump looks to his advisors for policy &amp; Governors had the final word on lockdowns.
Trust me. Knowing President Trump he always has a plan. Just not revealing it right now. Vote your conscience without fear on Nov. 3rd.

These are actually just the next five words in Trump‚Äôs mental acuity test.
"I am here to bear reluctant witness that Mr. Trump didn‚Äôt hijack the Republican Party. He is the logical conclusion of what the party became over the past 50 or so years, a natural product of the seeds of race-baiting, self-deception and anger that now dominate it."Here is something from three months ago. But I hadn‚Äôt seen anything about this until that Biden tweet tbh
Another attempt by trump to cheat and win the election.

Biden disproportionately weakened the black nuclear family through laws he sponsored . Trump has tweeted so many things that have been questionable. I appreciate your taking the time to respond. #antiracism
The freaking trump and the republican negotiators playing politics with the American people. Lies, lies and more lies every day.
It is not weird. It is selective editing to make it seem like Trump has failed, not that the virus has hurt every race. It is what Democrats do to win. Trump can bring jobs back. They don‚Äôt want the blacks to think that.
Not a defender of Trump. Some things you cannot defend ..Just curious do your tweets mean you‚Äôre a Biden supporter ?
DemonKKKrat strategy.  Open all schools across nation - Per Pres. Trump‚Äôs recommendation - see a tic up in cases (real or created) mid-October and shut schools down, messing up parents jobs, creating another crisis, blame President Trump.  It won‚Äôt work!
Meanwhile, Trump interviews himself for social media. üòÇüòÇüòÇ
"If Trump gets re-elected, the COVID lockdowns will last forever."  Essentially the argument.
Trump says he will fight for ALL American citizens to have prosperity and security. Biden just talks about the blacks.
I am voting for Trump.

Trump is attacking Joe Biden‚Äôs faith, saying he is ‚Äúagainst God.‚Äù The campaign should make an ad about his faith and how it drives his politics. Trump is the guy that hold a church crowd he doesn‚Äôt ask for forgiveness.

Trump is also the only president who grifts off taxpayers everyday. His family also profits every day. One golf outing costs more than his one year salary. #tfumpisanationaldisaster
True, but either way the Lysol would have killed virus. Trump was right.
Where Nikki Haley  when Trump and Republicans gave the top 1% a tax cut in a growing economy with record corporate profits? You are a hypocrite. #TrumpIsANationalDisgrace
This should be retweeted daily so we can all be reminded of how despicable the Trump administration is.  How can anyone still believe that Trump cares about anything other than himself &amp; his re-election?
Brilliant wit throwing this back at them concerning the double standard forever applied to President Trump and his supporters.  We‚Äôll likely all die waiting on the resistance to accept election results from 2016, and possibly 2020.
Sharp Joe Biden is on it. Stocks when up 8 consecutive years under Obama. Biden can do it also. Under Trump worst economical downturn in history. Ever!
i am trump supporter but it doesnt look good for his party. it is too difficult to win as Republican because NY and CA carry so many electoral vote
I don‚Äôt like trump and even I believe joe till perform poorly in the debates. He could shock us all if he actually came out looking sharp. Don‚Äôt see it happening.
Trump is a fool. #TrumpIsANationalDisgrace
Trump doesn't possess a rigorous mindset. He tends to blur details when he has to process them quickly at a wholesale level. (And when he doesn't really care much about them. Which is most of the time)  Pelosi is just flat-out lying and knows she is.  There's a difference.
Trump is an outlier, primarily because HRC ran one of the poorer campaigns in US Presidential history.  At least I trust that is the case......
Your just begging for votes you dummy! Latinos and other cultures are not stupid! Stop using pity and ignorance to try and sway the Americans in this country your way. We know what your up to and it‚Äôs not working sleepy Pervy joe! Trump is the way!!!!!!! Your all going to prison!
Keep in mind this is an opinion piece. From who knows where. You‚Äôll get no arguement from me that joe has some mental issues. The debates with trump and Hilary were also pointless. Cmon. Are you really gonna tell me you didn‚Äôt have your mind made up before the debates?
Convoluted Manu by a talking knucklehead.   Trump will chew Ole Joe up and spit him out.

LOL. 155,000 dead in US because Trump lied about the seriousness of the virus. Worst response in the world. #TrumpIsANationalDisgrace
I am also willing, but I find that the opinion of liberals is based on lies and name-calling. Ex. ‚ÄúTrump has killed thousands of people‚Äù and ‚ÄúHe is a racist.‚ÄùThere is always room for improvement in our institutions, but throwing the baby out with the bath water is not productive.

Trump ran in 2016 on putting together a new health care plan. Nothing. Trump delivered a tax cut for the rich. That is all. #TrumpIsALaughingStock
True.....to the TRUMP VIRUS
When Doug Jones ran against Roy Moore that‚Äôs when I first voted for a Democrat. Jones was the better candidate and Moore was a horrible candidate. I‚Äôve also realized the same about Trump. But if a Republican runs for office and I think he‚Äôs the best candidate I‚Äôll vote for him

Thank you! God bless you for your help in trying to preserve our freedoms, and to re-elect the best President ever, President Trump
President Trump is in  head so bad
Could you maybe pick a time when at least one left-leaning Supreme Court seat isn't likely up for grabs?  If Trump is reelected, the courts will be stacked HARD against a progressive agenda for decades.
This.  A re-elected Trump will overwhelmingly stack the deck for several decades.
Don't let the importance of this next presidential election be understated.  I fully believe that if Trump is reelected in 2020, the deck in the federal courts &amp; including supreme court will be stacked hard against a progressive agenda for decades to come, with no route to fix.
If you are a democrat who sees a path to a presidential election result in 2020 that doesn't re-elect Trump and that doesn't elect the Democrat nominee, by all means enlighten the rest of us.  Many of us are independents who are voting against, not voting for.
What kind of man would sign up to work for Trump? A scum bag, that is who. #TrumpIsANationalDisgrace
If the liberal commentators had some thoughts as to how to make this country better &amp; unify us instead of Democratic talking points, then I might respect them, but Juan Williams &amp; Donna Brazil don‚Äôt have a clue - just hate Trump &amp; think we supporters are racist &amp; unintelligent.
See how important local elections are?Pay attention to what kind of city, county, state the candidates support. Trump won because he promised America‚Äôs interests first.
Confuse everyone and put the Jones up sign with a trump sign

Show me evidence that the NYTimes covered for the Trump Administration.
Ok then Joe , you had 8 long years to do something and you didn‚Äôt.  Trump has that patented already.
Bro. We know, all the fearful and old Fox News types are voting for Trump.   Still not enough of y‚Äôall.
OMG! I mean I HAD A FEELING TRUMP WAS GOING TO BE A BAD PRESIDENT. BUT I NEVER DREAMED IT WOULD BE THIS HORRIFIC IN SO MANY WAYS. We have GOP SENATE TO THANK. They covered up his crimes in FEBRUARY. THEY MUST PAY WITH THEIR JOBS IN NOVEMBER!!! Again OMG!
I wonder how much sickness and death Trump has to confront before he realizes that it was all born out of his own failed response to the outbreak.
Instead the media has allowed tRump to again chg the narrative. He‚Äôs bragging abt it in a recent tweet. No longer are we talking abt what‚Äôs really urgent- we can only talk abt moving the election and mail in votes. Media is complicit with the worse prez ever! #tRumpvirus
Bernell Trammell. We need to remember his name. He was murdered because he was your supporter. Do all lives matter? Did anyone offer to pay for his funeral? Where is the outrage? I don't like the world I'm living in now. Re-elect Donald J Trump for president. Only hope.
She is a danger and should never be allowed back into the UK. Just my opinion as an American. I guarantee Trump would never allow her to return to the US. She made her bed she can lie in it. I don't care if she was 15 and stupid. Now she's just dangerous.
I'd like to believe that, but with Scotty Bowman and Adam Enre liking Trump tweets, Robin Lehner and Tony Deangelo being known supporters, Tim Thomas being himself, etc. it seems likely split.
I think I would give my left nut before I would vote for Trump!Pres. Trump holds Friday evening briefing
I don't advocate vandalism, but what's good for the goose is good for the gander. How many times has Donald Trump's stars been vandalized?
The largest part of the Trump trolls I run across don't seem to really believe any of their propaganda. They come across as lukewarm about their political views at best. I expect most of the trolls are being paid for their loyalty to Trump.
Trump could use a little humbleness, but thanks to the media he can‚Äôt show any weakness. If he did, they‚Äôd attack him like rabid dogs. Well, kind of like they do now. He‚Äôs been the best thing for the country in years. Go Trump!
Strange how the loudest libs who hate Trump, are also the ones who appear to have something to hide
They were gonna screw with whomever went against Trump.  It doesn't matter if he is in their pocket or just stupid, Putin knows in either case he still wins with Trump and loses with anyone else.
Most trump voters voted to keep Hillary out
and many of those will probably vote for Trump. Just sayin'.
I don't think Trump handled this very well, especially in the beginning. With that said, I think you can attribute these numbers to the selfishness of Americans in general as much if not more than Trump.  There are a lot of selfish bastards in this country.

Trump started out farther ahead in life than I did and maybe farther ahead than you too, but you still don‚Äôt build the organizations he has without being a strong leader.
I don‚Äôt understand the positives Trump voters saw in Donald Trump in 2016 that they refuse to support him this time around. I can‚Äôt believe it took a pandemic to change their attitude about this man.  Now reality has hit them and their families. We warned them.
Don‚Äôt fall for trump antics lol
Let me make this as clear as I can. If you follow Trump and his accomplices, you are not a patriot, you are a traitor, to the U.S. Constitution and to your country and your people.
Trump fans can only dish out insults, vulgarity and slander. That's all they have because that's all they have. There's nothing else in there.
Wouldn‚Äôt it be amazing if trump tweeted ‚Äúplease don‚Äôt believe the false smearing of Joe Biden.  My intelligence advisors have told me they‚Äôre spreading false information on social media.‚Äù  Classy John McCain certainly would have.
Put Trump behind bars
Being a lady, I certainly have never passed gas. However, I shall think particularly foul smelling thoughts at trump.
But with all the scandals and the blind support of Trump, it's clear his priority is Jerry, not our University.  It's time for fresh leadership.  He's lucky his father isn't alive to see this.  Dr. Falwell may have been controversial, but he loved Jesus and loved LibertyU.
No, Trump's right. Nobody would do what he's done. Most leaders would never consider outright treason and pushing Nazi Fascism. It's just not done.
And for my final play for this week (this may be one of my last ever): They say stockcharts can predict the future. If true what we may see first of the week is some pressure when the Dems threaten to prevent Trump from his EOs given tonight. They then become the bad guy.(1/3)
Trump tells lies in much the same way the rest of us breath air.
I cannot wait for the HUGE NEWS in November! You trump people have nearly ruined this country.

Biden has a speech impediment making it hard for him to say some words. Trump has well we don‚Äôt want he has.

Agree, it's better to assess the entire package of any candidate. If the bad greatly overwhelms the good, as I think it does for Trump, then don‚Äôt vote for him even if you can‚Äôt stand his opponent.
I have not heard this term but like it. ‚Äúone-thingism.‚Äù I have referred to many evangelicals having a one trick pony mindset when supporting Trump just because he says he's against abortion and will pack the judicial system with conservative judges. They overlook his many ills.

Cool! Thanks for the vote. I might as well have been one of those stay at home voters last time. Voted 3rd Party (don‚Äôt worry I wasn‚Äôt in a swing state). What I would argue helps complacency is COVID and anger and frustration over Trump for 3.5 years. 1/2
If they have ANY integrity, EVERY "family values" repub should say the same! ......Except they voted for Trump.

Let‚Äôs put an end to the Party of Trump, f/k/a the Republican Party. Vote them all out of every office nationwide. 99% of Republican office holders seem to have forgotten what it once meant to be a member of that party. It can be done. Seen any Whigs running for office lately?
Sorry, to clarify: most people who voted for Trump voted to keep Clinton out and I‚Äôm not going down the rabbit hole of voter fraud with you because the loser always say the election was rigged. Will be the same this Nov.
Your comparing trump to hitler?! That may have come out of your mouth a little too fast and easy before thinking about it. Or you didn‚Äôt have history when you were in school.
Good point. I used the phrase figuratively, not literally. I think Biden is less competent to run a country than Trump, but I would have to give him the nod on getting in. But then again none of us earn a spot so I can‚Äôt speak on that.
COVID is a huge problem. But some folks, especially Trump and his GOP backers pretend that everything is fine. Trump literally just said it is what it is. The US is leading the world in cases and deaths. We as a nation clearly have a problem, but not according to some leadership

Exactly.  Your alternative is Trump - the anti-thesis of American leadership.  You should be leading the conservative choice for Biden - so we can get back to normal debates about tax policy and deregulation not how many Americans should die per day, kids in cages, etc.

grow up and move on.   i swear you cult members need to do your own research and stop depending on the words of others.  when i did my research, i learned a lot like never to be for trump again
do your research. trump is refusing to submit his dna
what's trump's excuse?  i'm appalled at how many women are supporting a man that's been accused of rape by multiple women.  it makes absolutely no sense
i mean biden does have 24 women claiming he raped them and plus refuse to give his dna, biden also was fined twice for refusing to rent to minorities, plus biden has locked up hundreds of hispanics in cages like animals ...oh nm... that was trump
yes but at least he's not an evil lying rapist so if he gets elected, he can have his bouts of memory lapses as long as he don't act like trump
message me...lol.. i'll argue for awhile then i'll block them when they get on my nerves too bad.  realize you can't win with them, they are cult members.  they worship trump

we aren't as diverse as latinos.  look let's not pretend biden is the best choice, he's the only choice though.  trump would see us all locked up in chains or lynched.  but when you go to a black community, it's mostly black americans. when you go to a latin community, there ....

child, if biden sat in a corner rocking back and forward, he would still be better than trump and would have my vote
the crazy part about it, trump stands for most things God is against, the prideful, self lover, liar, he has the blood of 180,000 people on his hands, adulterer, the list goes on and on

so here we go blaming obama again when trump was the one that ordered them thrown in there.  i swear ya'll worship that man. it's ridiculous. obama been gone, the next hurricane is obama's fault also
if you have the money to afford a place in trump towers, you'd have trouble getting in.  he was fined twice for not renting to minorities
you should be asking what he's going to do for the country in general to bridge the gap that trump has created.  we need to get covid under control, then he needs to speak to the people to unite them, so stop being selfish and go vote for the idiot in office but remember this...
so biden is demented and trump is mentally stable??  um... i think both have some dementia but trump is just pure evil with his.
another fool who thinks pouring gasoline on a fire is the way to extinguish it.  how much is trump paying you to be his personal ball sack
Donald Trump.. not a big national park guy eh?
President Donald Trump said Monday he had fired Tennessee Valley Authority chairman and Decatur resident Skip Thompson, criticizing the federally owned corporation for hiring foreign workers and overpaying its chief executive officer.
no you allow trump to dictate how you think and feel. a true leader does not throw gasoline on a fire to try and extinguish it. what amazes me is all of the racist views coming at black american but then the sames ones with the racist views say "but i'm not a racist"
Falling off the Trump Train as Trump fires and destroys another good person by firing the wrong TVA person because he can‚Äôt get at the CEO. What a rotten pattern.
To each there own, but isn‚Äôt it cringe how hardcore trump supporters really believe ‚ÄúGod‚Äù only loves America?
An insecure narcissistic control freak, AKA Donald Trump?!!
Because Trump is afraid that if everyone gets to vote safely, he‚Äôll lose their election?
That‚Äôs what we need for everyone to be part of the decision! Trump wants those most often disenfranchised to have great difficulty voting, as they‚Äôre most likely not to vote for him!
Never even saw the targeted to  survey. But Dr Fauci hasn‚Äôt seen a patient in over 20 years &amp; he‚Äôs simply an unelected Gov employee. Trump is advised by many - not just left leaning Dr Fauci.
Too late Michael. Everyone knows the latest Trump interview is out there, and they are waiting to see what you were prompting him to say!! ü§´ü§´ü§´
here we go again.  dang you deflected about trump and went on a rant about blm.  then you brought up that one of the officers was black.  then someone else reminded you that the officer that killed mr. george floyd was white,
no you pulled out the race card when you started about blm...lol deflect then try to flip it...lmfao.  does it matter what race the police are if they're doing their job correctly? typical trump playbook.  keep trying.
the problem is, he has no point.  he is just deflecting from the facts that trump is a complete failure. trump does the same thing, we you call him on his iss, he starts rambling about blm or china.  trump and #Cult45 can't stick the facts
Not true, trump hired his own people to investigate voter fraud, his own people found found 3 instances of voter fraud in the last 20 years.
still waiting on your relevant point.  the typical deflecting racist.  let's not focus on the real issues, let's focus on blm...lol hey but let's ignore the 150,000 lives lost and putin's bounty on our military.  let's ignore the numerous times trump has been caught in lies......
killed by racist police officers.  let's not focus om the 150,000 dead because of trump's negligence, when it's brought up let's just talk about blm... just like sheep led to the slaughter. he told ya'll no mask and you believed him
you aren't too smart are you?  you worship trump and his racist actions.  you think it's ok to kill a man just because he has a criminal record. that's the whole #cult45 mentality.  let's ignore the wrong trump and his minions do but focus on black people tired of being.....
yes, the trump rallies, trump encouraging people not to wear mask because it was a symbol against him, yes large magnitude because ya'll can't think for yourselves. you believe every single thing he says.  the blm movement, we can think for ourselves and speak out when we....
i don't live in nyc and i'm sooo anti-trump but cuomo did a horrible job.  he's just as guilty as trump but i love hearing his brother on tv
trump is a terrorist
but going to spread the virus, ohh i meant trump rally was ok?  you do know about tulsa right? oh i forgot you forgot your god infected tulsa
if you were to ask trump himself wtf he was talking about, HE wouldn't even know.  how can they let him finish out his term?  he clearly isn't mentally stable
trump wants people to donate "plausma"  lol.. what an idiot #WomenAgainstTrump #EndTheNightmare #TrumpVirus
maybe you should think for yourself and stop letting trump tell you what to think.  if you think protesting police brutality is terroristic  then you seriously are a racist
President Donald Trump said today that he had fired the chair of the Tennessee Valley Authority, claiming the federal agency has betrayed American workers.
yeah but trump did things worth suing over
Joe Biden should not debate President Trump, Clinton‚Äôs ex-WH spokesman says
and let's keep the man free who's negligence has led to over 150,000 people's deaths.  trump is the most prolific serial killer in the united states
and i'm not a big fan of joe biden but would vote for a shoe box before i'd vote for trump
#Cult45  can't think for themselves.  they have to agree with EVERYTHING trump says and does.   they are even willing to sacrifice their own kids and lives for him.  trump exhibits signs of mental instability daily. trump is everything that's wrong with the country  now
After what these jackasses did to Yovonavich, Hill &amp; Vindman &amp; his brother give them any job they want. Sondland, Grenell, Dejoy, Perry, Mulvaney, &amp; all these others who paid trump to put them in rolls in his swamp move them to Siberia. They w/ love Putin since they no gd to him
Nope. Truth has been their downfall long before Trump.
like you would know who God is!!! you follow a racist tyrant.  those the video is vulgar, i think it isn't any worse than you worshipping a racist troll named trump!!! now that's horrible and disrespectful!!!!!
everyone should have voted for Deez Nuts instead of trump, at least it would have been slightly amusing.  trump is murderous
Our teachers are so underrated. People still don't understand the value of their job to teach the next generation, and the next, and so on. Without teachers we will surely become the Idiocracy that Trump wants us to be.
I know Trump didn't say that, because it's the truth.
oh biden is worse?? um trump was fined 2 times for not renting to minorities, and he was told about the bounties on multiple occasions, he just was too busy golfing
are you forgetting epstein and trump wishing her well?  you #Cult45  don't even use the slightest bit of common sense to see what's really going on
claimed Loomer &amp; others created the false flag about bombers  being Trump supporters - then ‚Äúhashtag "#MAGABomber" began trending on Twitter, referring to Trump's 2016 campaign slogan, "MAGA" (Make America Great Again).[114][115][116]‚Äù sounds like Loomer was right
the problem is they hadn't guzzled the right amount of kool-aid.   they believe every single thing trump says and does is absolutely correct. they worship him. they would sacrifice their children to him
and here comes the trump cult members...lmfao...
Also Trump did not know the bank had been so throughly robbed, that  so ineptly handeled the situation, &amp; many other things were broken when Trump began office requiring attention.
Nope wrong again:
Well said. We all know, the lesser of two evils but that pretty much qualifies 99 percent of all human beings as the lesser evil. Compared to Trump one would really have to be a true monster to be worse.
Odd how  had almost 50 years (8 as a VP) to root out ‚Äúsystemic racism‚Äù  and did NOTHING. Yet  claims  as a racist when Trump DID SOMETHING in 3 years, making the highest employment for blacks, Hispanics, and Asians in HISTORY!

you're kidding right?  when he's been saying it for months and months, no i take that back, years.  when the first protest started way back he said the same thing.  if you vote for trump, vote for him but stop being mindless and believing every single things he says.
to trumpeteers, if trump offers you kool-aid, please drink it, drink as much of it as you can

glad your eyes are now open because i always think anybody that fights or have fought for us are number 1.  i respect vets so much but gained more respect if that's possible to the vets who may not be for blm but stood in protest with them against trump's war on civilians.
Trump threatens America with the highest employment in HISTORY for blacks, Asians, &amp; Hispanics. Plus the highest employment of women in over 70 years.

talk about window licker.  if trump had of shut the country down in the beginning for about a month, this would have been just a bad memory. due to his lack of response, we are still suffering with covid. trump just isn't too bright
I think it‚Äôd be the other way around! Trump doesn‚Äôt have the courage to have a good debate.

Plus, by avoiding prosecution in another country, he can still continue to sow discord and reap whatever financial benefits he can from what remains of his business.  Trump isn't running for President.  He's running to avoid prison.
It sounds fantastic.  I know.    But, there's nothing left for Trump in America except for countless lawsuits.  If he stays in America, he'll spend the rest of his life in court fighting to avoid prison.  If he's convicted of anything, he'll likely die in prison.
The pilot would have to comply since Trump would still be Commander In Chief.    From that airport, Trump can take ground transportation to wherever he's arranged for asylum.  Moscow wouldn't be out of the question.

Reich is wrong, though.  Pence can't pardon Trump of crimes he hasn't been tried for or prosecuted of.  That's not going to happen between Election Day and Inauguration.
This is a bad take.  A.  Trump would have to be found guilty of a federal crime before he could be pardoned of it.  That won't happen between now and inauguration.  B.  Even then, Pence would only be able to pardon Trump of federal crimes; not state-level.

See and that's exactly where we differ in opinion. I do not believe that Biden is even a little better than Trump.  And I refuse to vote the lesser of two evils. If the Democratic party wants my vote they need to run a candidate I believe in.
And I get it you're willing to vote for Biden because you believe that there is some legitimate difference between him and Trump. I don't. Deal with it.
I don't vote against candidates I vote for candidates. So instead of trying to explain to me why I need to vote against Trump explain to me why I should vote for Biden without mentioning Trump.
Sorry but if your best argument for Biden is "but Trump" you're engaging in a futile effort with me. I don't negotiate with terrorists.
Literally every reason I won't support Trump are the same reasons I won't support biden. And telling me I have to support Biden is like someone trying to convince you you have to support Trump. It's a total waste of time.

The original reply was because you said ‚Äúit‚Äôs all about Trump‚Äù correct? It‚Äôs just a response to what you stated. The kneeling had been going on before Trump. But you blame him. The coronavirus started in China. But you blame him. He is not perfect, but you are ridiculous

Only reason for election being close would be from the Left's cheating.  Democrats will pull out all stops! There's no filthy corruption or demonic evil they would consider beneath them; dangerous to our Republic. I pray Trump has his own bodyguards augmenting his SS protection.
Can‚Äôt stand trump, the schmuck!
We expect rabid nonsense from Democrats. But Feckless Republicans have permitted the persecution of Trump from day 1. Lil Jeff Sessions could've put his foot down as AG, instead he left President out to dry on utterly corrupt criminal activity from DOJ, FBI, FISA, CIA, Congress..
You're arguing against a strawman- exactly like Trump does! You know I never said, or even implied, anything about "the folks who work for" Yellawood. Serious question: did you laugh as you typed "Trust me" bc you know i 100% agree ü§£ü§£... still ‚ù§ you man, but wow
D.A. Is Investigating Trump and His Company Over Fraud, Filing Suggests
If Biden wins, the establishment will sit here and say ‚Äúsee Bernie could never have done that‚Äù. When in reality, the only reason he‚Äôs doing so well is because of covid. If it was Bernie vs Trump, it would be a landslide for Bernie.
A low death rate as a percentage of cases is a testament to our medical community, not Trump.  A high death rate as a percentage of population is a testament to the abject failure of our leadership coupled with citizens rejecting science for hoax  crack.
If you dont want to be chased by men with guns whether its civillians or cops i have a fantastic idea for you... Stop breaking the fucking law. And also trump doesnt need to be moral as the government is not a moral institutionand if he is such a clown hows he doing so great
Arbery was casing houses to steal from he was chased and citizens attempted to detain him he then charged a man and grabbed his shotgun.... What exactly do you think he was gonna do if he got that gun and trump is an amazing president hes not a hero hes a great leader
Interesting. So.. what about those bounties?? Even IF Trump didn‚Äôt know anything about it (he did), why hasn‚Äôt he still done anything about it?
Brianna taylor was wrong and the cops should be charged however arbery was a justified shooting hence why the media went quiet on it there was no way to spin it and trump doesnt cause stress hes done a better job then most who ever held that office
Trump would finally get the [real] crowd size he wants
No i think he lived a criminal lifestyle and danced on the razor edge of a death that sooner or later was going to happen and the media spun it into a race war to gin up a protest that quickly got out of control turned into a riot and then they capatilized on that to blame trump
‚ÄúI took a threesome for two weeks.‚Äù  - Donald Trump  Sorry, the immature kid in me won‚Äôt let this one go
Said and done worse? Ummm when and where because thats not true trump is not a racist
Trump wouldn't even have to utter a word.
Is Donald Trump a Politician?
If Tik Tok gets banned, I will never get to post my dance rendition of the latest trendy song. How dare you, Trump!
Moments ago: Trump to sign executive order on hiring American workers  via
‚ÄúSo even though I had voted Republican in every presidential election since 1976, I changed my voter registration to independent and I will be voting for  in November.‚Äù
Why are we surprised Trump lied about his crowd size in Florida and Texas. It‚Äôs literally the first thing he did in office.  #TrumpIsLosing
We need to sound the alarm: Trump could refuse to accept defeat. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm joining #ProtectTheResults:
GOP: Renomination of Trump to be held in private
Photo shopped picture not even a good one at that. The picture of trump kissing his daughter was taken in 93 at the grand opening of the Harley Davidson Cafe. Taken by photo journalist Ron Gallela. This is the original.
I'm glad Trump closed the borders to china when he did  even though he was called a xenophobe he knew it would get worse if he didn't.
In spite of all evidence to the contrary, let‚Äôs assume, solely for the sake of argument, That HUNTER had corruptly received money from Ukraine. What office is he running for? Who‚Äôs vote is he trying to earn? And exactly how would that be different from the Trump kids..,?
Make America Great Again with Trump 2020 ! We Love our great President Trump, his family &amp; his Administration - he is the 2nd American Cyrus who‚Äôs God appointed and anointed to be the protector of America‚Äôs Ancient foundations - Pray for God‚Äôs agenda to be achieved through him!
maybe you should do some soul searching son. he's done more for this country than any pres in 20 yrs.
This is how I feel about trump worrying about tik tok right now lol
Like Gen Z wasn't already coming for him hard enough? #tiktokban
So did anyone else notice that the police and sheriff escorts for the Trump and confederate caravans in Florence AL tonight didn‚Äôt ticket or arrest anyone for using their phone to record video while driving?
Project Say Something‚Äôs protest against the Confederate monument outside the Lauderdale County Courthouse ended peacefully tonight. Counter-protesters drove through downtown flying Confederate, Blue Lives Matter and Trump 2020 flags off their pickup trucks.
I no longer have to wonder what our Grand Country would be like if it were run by the Mob, it already has been since January 20, 2017 !  Just watch Donald Trump, he acts like a mob member EVERY DAY !
Protesters fill the Lauderdale County Courthouse plaza for Project Say Something‚Äôs Occupy Downtown: Unite Against the Klan protest. Counter protesters have also shown up circling the courthouse with Confederate flags and Trump 2020 flags.
Donald Trump loves only himself, I don't know about who or what he hates. He is using America to make more money, to weaken America so that someday Putin (Trump's banker before and after the presidency) &amp; friends can jet in and conquer America.
Black woman is the only one making sense.
Isn‚Äôt this the trump you talking about?
Another reason for constitutional conservatives to decline to vote for Trump so it will not be close.
Saw a lady in Walmart with a "Women for Trump" shirt.
Keem is the Trump of Epsorts. Literally read that in trumps voice. Sad!
Banning HCQ cure is TDS on steroids.  If Trump had originally vilified it, we'd be OK to purchase HCQ over the counter at a local deli.
It's also convenient when a news channel twists everything.. cough cough  CNN, NBC, MSNBC, ABC, ETC. You sont think this country is controlled by the media? They show you what they want you believe and see. Open your ignorant eyes. Trump isn't the problem, it's the Media.
If y‚Äôall really think President Trump was serious and not throwing the media for a loop to mess with them then yeah y‚Äôall are pretty stupid...
Trump is a genius, he put that out there so that the media and the Democrats will get behind not postponing the election!
Well gee lets take a wild stab as to why people dont want to listen to yet another sjw whine about the lie of trump being a bad president bcuz its not like we haven't been hearing that for four goddamn years and certainly gonna hear it another four when he is definitely reelected
What is your opinion about the possiblity that Trump would try to have the post master general (that he just appointed) claim that mail in ballots from certain (dem) cities in swing states are invalid bc of voter fraud or etc? He would try to do that to tip the election.
Omg all I have to do to be successful is to start a business and say how great trump is biiiiiitch...
I like how you can look back on interviews with Trump and his positions and views haven‚Äôt changed.  He wants America to do better and stop being taken advantage of.  You look back at Biden and his time in office and especially the senate and he is clearly racist but he‚Äôs changed
I have been a Republican all of my adult life.  But Trump and some of his followers are making me seriously rethink my allegiance to the GOP
I‚Äôll answer that for you:  JFK (D), Hoover (D)  and yes your President, President Trump (R). So yeah he has NO financial motive as president.  Unlike Obama, Biden, Pelosi, Schiff (well all Democrats so I‚Äôll save some reading for you).
So your doing more commercials ? Let‚Äôs see beans and pizza what‚Äôs else... oh yea corona . God damn idiot trump
96 Days till the election.  Trounce Trump and vote.
Wonder why they want to ban  Hydroxychloroquine? Other than saving lives, HCQ ends it all. No lockdowns  Schools churches businesses restaurants economy open market surges...  Nope. Trump hating Democrats won't stand for it.
The Virus suddenly disappears? Right? Bwhahahahaha Trump is a GENIUS !
Trump demands money to renovate the White House in the coronavirus bill: report
I don‚Äôt blame you Vote for Trump he and We The People believe in you heroes God bless our Police from sea to shining sea Amen üôè
I can think of a lot more reasons why the big pharmaceutical and Democrats are against it.  If it‚Äôs true Trump was right all along and they have the deaths on their hands.
‚ÄùAmerica First‚Äù for Trump is we should turn a blind eye to intelligence reports of Russian bounties on soldiers because we armed Afghans who fought the Soviets in the 1970‚Äôs.
Please take Trump's plan to move troops out of Germany seriously and stop him !
IF this plan occurs,it will be a continuation of Trump/Putin plans to weaken America inside &amp; outside our borders! I pray Americans will understand this and   you and all military people will explain this to American families so they will vote him out!
Barr faked his way through the entire day. He is a criminal the same as Trump is.  They ARE working together to weaken America. We need to work together to encourage a gigantic wave of votes to oust Trump thereby ridding ourselves of Barr at the same time!
McConnell is responsible for the power that Trump has now, at this very moment.  They planned it for many years, including Obama's term.
The Covid Test should be as fast as Gohmer's. It could be working fast right now for all of us,but,Putin's pressure on Trump to harm America"s people, Constitution,Rule of Law, health,education, living spaces, finances and way of life has caused our greatness begin to crumble!
He offends me deeply too!  I love my country and all the people in it. Think of all the people who would still be alive right this very moment if Trump had used his brain, or allowed someone else with a brain to lead us into this virus war.Aww. Today's poll showed Trump over Biden by 3. üêòüíØ
Second debate just about water. Water pressure. Who can drink a glass of water most gracefully. Who flushes the toilet the most times. Maybe even address the water crisis in Flint if they could get Trump to agree to it.
Now do a billboard for the elderly Trump supporter who was murdered in Detroit for kicks just because he advertised his support for Trump. We *see* youüò∂
Cocktails with Trump. Thousands dead Millions without work The President have a rally with cocktails for his Private Country Club Members.
Knowing what Trump is and capable of, no amount would. I would not be able to live with myself, as the destruction of the country and church is assured. I didn't vote for him in 2016 and I hope that he and his ilk will be excised from public forum.
Cocktails with Donald Trump. Thousands of Americans dead Millions of Americans without work. The President have a cocktail rally at his private golf resort.
So trump is going to dismantle Obamacare for Obamacare?
What Republicans? They are going to be routed just as trump is.
This is absolutely horrible!! Trump did all he could do to destroy Obamacare.  He FAILED!! "Southern Political Segregation" states even refused $billions of dollars by Expanding Medicaid because it's an Obama contribution. Now Trump wants to take credit for it. Sickening!!
I don‚Äôt see how ANYONE can look at what Dems are doing and promoting and call anything Trump is doing a shit show!!
If trump hoping to send his tweets written on balloons?
Question? Does trump read?
Thanks for this. While many r excited 2 vote Trump out, there has been 2 little attention on the change in current toxic culture. I'm really glad to see someone look forward. I do have some q's. How do we change smthg like Fox &amp; OANN? How do we effectively move away from racism?
Anyone stupid enough to vote for Kanye West for POTUS should keep it very quiet, keep it to yourself.   Trump is putting west on the ballot to get stupid people hopefully to vote far west instead of Biden. West will take votes from Trump, not Biden. Biden supporters are not DUMB!
If Trump can bankrupt a casino people should be able to bankrupt on a student loan.
I did a spit-take with my glass of Trump wine so I think it‚Äôs got staying power.
When it comes to trump supporters, they are clueless about everything Obama did for this country and how trump claimed all of Obama‚Äôs accomplishments and dragged them all into the ground.
in an actual debate with Trump.
Well trump has shown they have their lives to lose by ignoring the coronavirus epidemic.
No Joe, that was you. I know it‚Äôs hard to keep facts straight. Here‚Äôs your and Obama‚Äôs impact on manufacturing
I doubt if trump wants to lose, he literally thinks being a bad ass will keep his supporters in line. What a dufus.
The left and media claimed falsely that Trump worked with a forgiven government to get elected and now you are complaining that Trump is going to do the same without any evidence. Liberalism is a mental disorder.
So trump‚Äôs last gasp of breath is to ride on Barack Obama‚Äôs coattails? He‚Äôs already screwed up other Obama‚Äôs accomplishments.

Be as ruthless against the rich as trump has been against the poor and middle class. It‚Äôs us that that created the United States from the sweat of our brows not the wealthy
Another attempt by trump to cheat and win the election.

‚Äúfind something new to hate her for‚Äù  I mean shit, that would be plenty enough for me‚Äîeven without all of her deep sense of appreciation for the russian president, her meetings with the trump campaign, her present vote in the impeachment of DJT, etc  find a clue
Uh, yeah.
Another example if how dumb Trump is.  He just says whatever comes out of his mouth regarding how stupid it sounds.
I think he pretty much got the job because he will lie. He will also hire a hooker and not pay child support which makes he super qualified for the Trump administration.
Really tired of seeing folks saying Biden and Trump are the same. The hell the are! Ask your self if they would appoint the same people to the SCOTUS. There. Fixed it for you.
In order to defeat  ,  is going to run as a Democrat.   I didn‚Äôt see take coming.   Trump will do anything to stay out of jail.
Trump supports Obama Care!
Yeah, it is already the law. The law Trump has been fighting in court to get rid of. I guess he forgot he was so busy thinking about Thighland.
Trump cursed black athletes. He bashes black politicians and residents on their Districts. He bashes predominantly black cities. He has been sued for housing discrimination. Now he's terrifying white suburbanites that low income minorities will destroy their communities.
I fully agree, but again, my hope is that its prevalence &amp; pervasiveness aren‚Äôt so deeply-rooted that it literally forces this nation into a second trump term. I‚Äôm not sure how systemic the issue is within the party, but it better not fuck this up. The stakes couldn‚Äôt be higher.
The people on this thread are the reason why this country is falling apart.  Trump is right. You socialist idiots are insane.
You have the candidates confused. Not Biden, but Trump who lies so often that I sometimes think he believes his own lies.
At this point if you vote for Donald Trump your a goddamn idiot
Daily reminder that you can be vehemently anti-Trump and still not resort to slut shaming when mentioning Melania.‚úåüèª
Heidi: To help you understand how President Trump won in 2016, read the Constitution. As for Russian help, it was all to Hillery, ‚Äî after nearly 49 M wasted, Mueller could not any evidence of Russian help to our President. Recommendation-time to grow up &amp; stop believing Dims.
did someone hit Trump with a Haldol dart before he walked to the podium? #Bedminster #TrumpIsNotWell

There isn‚Äôt enough money in the world to make me go see trump.
What a pathetic and vile response. Must be a Trump supporter.
Hopefully citizens in Florida and Texas will ask themselves why trump is helping just them. Is trump trying to give bribes and favors for votes?
HAPPENING NOW:  President Trump holds a press conference in Bedminster, New Jersey
Congress needs to use the 25th amendment and remove Trump from office. If the republicans hope to win any elections in November 2020, removing Trump from office might be their only hope to try to turn the tide. Otherwise, it‚Äôs over for the republicans.
We will never know.   said his glass as full of ‚ÄúBlack water‚Äù not wine. And both he and that young ladies pants were unzipped because they didn‚Äôt fit.  No one ask why their pants were off, just accepted the excuse.  media lets Trump get away with lies, not you
more Fuck‚Äôn lying!! Ur a lying liberal MF‚Äôer.. Trump lives in ur little pee brain rent free ü§°
STFU.. if ur mouth is moving ur lying ü§• Trump is going to beat #BeijingBiden like a drum!!
Trump managed to fuck up THE POST OFFICE.
The FDA will be required to develop a list of essential medicines covered under the order. At a minimum, the order will apply to drugs and supplies needed to combat emergencies such as pandemics, bioterror attacks and other threats. |
They are calling out your lies and deceit. You people lack any morals or integrity. You have sold your souls to devil trump.
Press corps.  Please walk out on this ‚Äúpress conference‚Äù where trump has assembled members to be a cheering section.  No masks.  No distancing.  Please.  Don‚Äôt give him the audience in the press he craves.
Franklin Graham is somewhere scared to death now. Graham along with several other "so-called" evangelicals committed blasphemy and had the audacity to say that God sent Trump. Absolutely disgusting!!
LIVE NOW: President Trump holds a briefing.
Let trump be trump.   Look we‚Äôre that has landed usü§Ø
I don't watch cable news but I do know that with the asset forfeitures from Manafort that Mueller turned a profit and that he explicitly did not exonerate Trump and that he cited multiple instances of obstruction of justice.
Trump is no AntiChrist, Trump is a con-artist and his followers are fools.
‚ÄúStep back and remember the big picture. What were Obama &amp; Co. so *desperate* to keep hidden if Trump won the election?‚Äù
Sir, you have my support.  But Stuart Stevens has a great idea.  You need a commercial that simply says, ‚ÄúDonal Trump has failed as President.  And his actions and lack of actions is costing you the lives of your loved ones and those you know ‚Äú.
Steven Stevens just summed up this presidential race.  Donald Trump has failed as President and it costing you the lives of your loved ones and people you know.   It‚Äôs just that simple.  And that needs to be said over and over and over, everyday!
Hold on a minute what about Clinton and Obama??? They are secular and made millions off of Wall Street handouts. Reagan, Bush, and Trump may have pandered to the Christian Right to get elected but what did any of them actually do that actually benefitted the Christian Right???
Yeah, I‚Äôve had journalists post more deranged ones. I get the same vibe from the way they do the Trump ads I see everywhere. Almost all of them are not designed to actually try to convince anyone to vote for him!
Trump is trying to take credit for anything that is going on positive N this country whether he is remotely close to it or not so he can try 2 get his base hyped up. We can't give this P.O.S credit 4 anything cuz he HATES people he's a Nazi. Nazis don't belong in our country.
Another follow.  I‚Äôm in ü§™
I hear you... as I mentioned two heads of the same snake. I wasn‚Äôt trying to diminish what Trump has done. I just can‚Äôt fathom why Biden is the democratic choice. We‚Äôve got to find better people to run.
Pathetic,  I can hardly wait to hear you join in n the communal howl at the sky when president Trump is easily reelected. Btw, gfy you Russian dupe!
Few people may "Bible Trump" and "Profess the Military" but other than the military part it has no true affect on our political system. The Christian Right has lost every battle they've gotten in since the 1960s and America has since declined into a Post-Christian secular state.
I like how you‚Äôre trying to deflect to yet another lie but my question remains, would you have been ok with him not being caught? I‚Äôd guess if he was caught later on you‚Äôd blame Obama for not warning trump. Am I wrong?
Underfunding the Post Office is part of Trump‚Äôs campaign strategy.
You might explore the records before you call someone more of a criminal than Trump.  Abundance of evidence to the contrary. You seem to be stuck in your own fortified cave with your blinders on.  Go ahead cuss at me some more that will prove your point.
Biden disproportionately weakened the black nuclear family through laws he sponsored . Trump has tweeted so many things that have been questionable. I appreciate your taking the time to respond. #antiracism
I haven‚Äôt forgotten this: ‚ÄúEvangelical Jerry Falwell Jr. to head Trump education task force‚Äù l Reuters
I followed you. Any road that Trumpty Dumpty is on leads to Putin and his communist russian mafia gangsters. But the Chinese and the Iranians hate Trump. They may actually try to help Trump lose and help Biden win.  Any way that Trump loses works for me.
I would be interested in seeing Congress take the opportunity to consult the American people on proposed legislation, pass a law with a veto-proof majority, and then give Trump the job of enforcing it, instead of "negotiating" with Steven Mnuchin.
American has had Pandemics before, World Wars before, Stock Market Crashes before.  Historically speaking, this is not new.  What America has not had is  ,  Trump is new and the results are disastrous.  This is textbook - "FAILED LEADERSHIP"
He thinks Trump is going to come to his rescue.  Hopefully the board of trustees do the right thing though I could reslly care less. MY CONSCIENCE: Then why are you tweeting about this.  Take a nap Willie .
This is unfortunately all too true. Opinion | We are only beginning to suffer the consequences of Trump‚Äôs failures - The Washington Post
The freaking trump and the republican negotiators playing politics with the American people. Lies, lies and more lies every day.
This is an incredible simplification of Trump voters. Generalizations like this are not helpful and in a world which desperately needs reconciliation I‚Äôm surprised at this post. Some people vote on policies not personality. Trump voters aren‚Äôt monolithic!
It is not weird. It is selective editing to make it seem like Trump has failed, not that the virus has hurt every race. It is what Democrats do to win. Trump can bring jobs back. They don‚Äôt want the blacks to think that.
Reverend reveals what evangelicals say privately about Trump  via
Not a defender of Trump. Some things you cannot defend ..Just curious do your tweets mean you‚Äôre a Biden supporter ?
DemonKKKrat strategy.  Open all schools across nation - Per Pres. Trump‚Äôs recommendation - see a tic up in cases (real or created) mid-October and shut schools down, messing up parents jobs, creating another crisis, blame President Trump.  It won‚Äôt work!
It's election season and Dipshitdonnie is losing.  He lost the #Vets4Trump and he is allowing Pompeo to make meaningless public statements that Trump himself can deny and ignore.  Only a moron would believe Trump would ever stand up to Putin.   Never has / Never will
Have you listen to trump trying to read what‚Äôs put in front of him? I submit Thighland and Yo See MITE from his recent attempts just this week. What day ye?
If anyone ask, "Where are all the NEW Manufacturing jobs  promised with his Tax give away for the rich and his Failed Trade-war?" They're in China and Vietnam, exactly where they always were.  Trump didn't bring them back, they just moved around within Asia.
The fact that Trump still has voters simply shows us how broken we are as a nation. A lot of Americans embrace racism, exploitation of the poor and the marginalization of LGBTQ+ persons. They seem to have zero empathy.
Trump really cares more about tiktok than Covid hahaha what world do we live in ?!
I think the real reason why Trump wants to take Tic-Toc down is because intelligence data shows China  election interference is anti-Trump. Russia‚Äôs is on Trumps side so putting bounties on US soldiers is OK with him.
Herman Cain, the former Republican presidential candidate, businessman and close ally of President Donald Trump, was guided by his Christian faith in politics, business and his personal life, his pastor said at his funeral Friday.
Yes, If I‚Äôve learned anything from Twitter it is that you can‚Äôt use facts, truth and logic on Trump supporters.  Doesn‚Äôt work.  If it did, they would‚Äônt be dining  on meals of Tucker Carlson and flirting with ‚ÄúQ‚Äù.  But if you have swamp land to sell, you may find a buyer there.
Trump uses God exactly as he uses people. As a pawn and a ploy. Trump is un-Christian based on his statements and behavior.
It‚Äôs going to be a landslide. I‚Äôm 63 voting for the first time. I believe there are many more like me. Dems will hold their nose and vote their pocket book (Trump) or sit it out.
#Biden shouldn‚Äôt have agreed to debates until #trump released tax returns
Republicans: SEE CHINA AND IRAN BACK BIDEN!!!! SOCIALIST  Democrats: SEE RUSSIA WANTS TRUMP TO WIN!!!! COLLUSION  The rest of us: üòë  The two party system failed us. How about we just do the right thing and secure our elections from all foreign nations?
On the short term, orange man bad vote blue is probably the only strategy toward anything resembling progressive policy. It's too late in the game to risk 4 more years of Trump. I want a student loan plan and healthcare too. Trump will mean neither. Biden might mean some.
Trump is the best president
The truth behind this is really questionable. First Trump says it was a hoax, then as pressure mounts for weeks, Pompeo says he warned Russia about it, but this is just now being disclosed. Can we see a transcript of the call or have some verification by those who listened in?
Mercy. I'm having the same thoughts I did about this time in 2016 when it was Clinton vs. Trump. I always try to be an optimist, but the choices in November have me using this emoji quite often &gt;&gt;ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

*With GOP Hubby Andrea Mitchell(  ) with her focus on Clinton EMAILS Everyday(EVERYDAY) helping Elect Trump- She would do less Damage if she were on FOX News
These assurances come from a totally unqualified, inexperienced Trump sycophant, a donor who was repaid with a government appointment. We can only hope that he is not just another Republican trying to undermine the voting process, but he clearly takes his orders from Trump.
Except when putin wants to kill Americans - Putin First The trump klan are all cowards. The only reason their ancestor immigrated here was to get out of military service in Germany.  Cowardice is in their DNA
No stimulus checks, unemployment boost? Last-ditch virus aid talks as Trump team back to Capitol
Meanwhile, Trump interviews himself for social media. üòÇüòÇüòÇ
"If Trump gets re-elected, the COVID lockdowns will last forever."  Essentially the argument.
Trump says he will fight for ALL American citizens to have prosperity and security. Biden just talks about the blacks.

You have no back to back up your claims. In fact you‚Äôre spreading misinformation. Tree I think Twitter and Facebook does not allow that. Maybe better clean up your act and get your facts straight. Donald Trump is beating you at your own game.
The poor guy can't stop himself from projecting.   If we promised Trump $1million in cash, 2 barely legal Russian mail order brides, and bag of Big-Macs if he goes 1 week w/out projecting, he'd lose every time. He can't help himself.
Trump claims Biden 'no longer worthy of the Black Vote' in wake of diversity comment

Hey  I'm just curious, can you name ANY hotels that are built w/o money from oligarchs? Lol, course not. Perhaps we should try Trump for his actual crimes instead of trying to blame Russians for our own criminal cabals?
Nope...it is the underlying condition of being a leader is that you are responsible for the decisions you make and how it affects others or the situation.  Trump can deny responsibility all he wants, but the fact is:  the buck stops there!!

I'm holding out hope that McGahn is one of the good ones however few and far between they might be. I seem to remember he had some disagreement with Trump about how being WH counsel isn't the same as being Trump's lawyer.
Are you implying that Donald J. Trump‚Äôs administration has managed the COVID-19 response better than Andrew Cuomo‚Äôs administration? Please provide evidence to you your claims. Joe Biden‚Äôs commercial tells the story of elderly Floridians who are not able to see their grandkids.
Do you want vote by mail so you can corrupt the election. If you think about health or anything else it‚Äôs about your grab for power. Also you didn‚Äôt like When you were ask a real question by PBS. She is not a Trump advocate. You just got caught in a lie. Out the door with you

Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden says he will not stand in the way of prosecution against President Trump from the Justice Department if he is elected. -
Voting for trump? That‚Äôs what hurts to know that many people are simply that stupid
My dad didn‚Äôt want to put on his mask and I was like ‚Äúokay trump‚Äù and it was a good joke my whole fam laughed
Holy shit.  I wonder if Trump talked him into the hairstyle while playing golf with him a few weeks ago.
Besides Donald Trump, how about Vladimir Putin and his henchmen, Mitch McConnell, Ted Cruz, and the republicans in the senate who kiss Putin‚Äôs ass seven times a day facing towards the kremlin. And don‚Äôt forget the head asskisser, Mike Pence.
GOP‚Äôs Senators opposition to a relief package is pretty clear sign they expect Trump to lose. If they thought he had a chance they would be signing on to a bigger package. This seems to be about setting the stage to oppose Biden.
TikTok is threatening legal action over President Trump's exectuive order to ban the Chinese social media app from doing business in the U.S. -
Yes, this is common sense, but what is also common sense is that Trump is American with an American accent. Americans dont pronounce Thailand this way. Dinesh is also trying to say most of the English speaking countries do. It appears people from most of those countries disagree.
Parents need to speak out.....and this right here is why Trump needs to go.  Fascism in the WH of the United States of America.....
It just gets uglier and uglier. If Joe would just smile at the camera and be quiet, his resume and Trump's craziness could help him win. Instead, it's feeling more and more like we just need a reset button. Our (Democrats) hope lies in the VP choice I'm afraid
Trump should be strapped with term #PandemicBotchery
Say what you want about Trump in that photo but man that kid does not know how to cut grass.
I still rubs me wrong knowing that Richard Nixon's signature is on my discharge documents. I can't even imagine how badly the current military folks feel knowing that they want to live with Trump's on theirs!
Trump has lots of rough edges. He‚Äôs far from the ideal man.Same as me. But he beats, by far, anything or anybody the left has to offer.

"On Thursday night, Trump signed two executive orders that'll enable the U.S. Commerce Secretary to punish American companies and individuals found in violation with $1 million fines and possible imprisonment."  Here is the full article if you choose to read it! #glenmalone2
Also, why be hesitant when Trump is shattering all Republican norms and principles?
you never see the headline "Trump clarifies remarks".
a PULLBACK from the gains of May and June and evidence that the resurgent coronavirus IS SLOWING HIRING and the economic rebound.   Trump say "By the end of Summer American will be back Stronger than ever".   TicToc
Trump really bout to ban an appüò≠ WHOSE MANS IS THIS???
Trump supporters are the goddamn worst!
Oh and the navy ship actually had a big ceremony requested by Trump before it left for NY. So yeah.. fanfare.
Surpassing Expectations?  Who's expectations.  Not  's.  Trump said we would have a FULL Recovery by the end of Summer and be back even BIGGER than before by Fall.
As I recall, Fauci, CDC and WHO didn‚Äôt want a run on existing N95s which were in short supply globally. Also, I recall Fauci recommending a face covering and Trump said he would not be wearing one. On live TV.
will someone send me that child rape lawsuit against trump i am so pissed  my mother rn
If you don't feel compelled to vote at all this year, or if your morals compel you to write in a third party as a means of saving face, just stay home. Or better yet, just go ahead and cast your vote in for Trump. All of these choices might as well be the same fucking thing.
71% of people who voted for Trump do not have college degrees.
But you‚Äôre good with Biden saying ‚ÄúYou ain‚Äôt black if you vote for Trump‚Äù? What a hypocrite
Bless your heart you‚Äôre getting the candidates confused. Biden was the one who said ‚ÄúYou ain‚Äôt Black if you vote for Trump‚Äù
We are living in Idiocracy and Trump is President Camacho.
Pay close attention to what networks host the presidential debates.   We are going to see moderator interference like never before with Joe Biden at the podium against Trump.   Every time Joe stumbles or stutters they will jump in and finish his sentences.   #Debate2020 #Trump
Basically ‚ÄúTrump‚Äôs a dumb old man? What do y‚Äôall want?!?‚Äù
Whichever prison Trump ends up in should have a 24 hour live stream from his cell that people can subscribe to who want to watch him suffer and all the proceeds should go to #BLM.
Samuel P. Huntington's pet transition countries--Hungary &amp; Poland--are revealing exactly why they were his favorite. Please don't forget how Huntington's Harvard tenure paved the ideological space for Trump and white nationalism.
So, racism doesn't exist. Trump has never done anything wrong, doesn't lie, hasn't committed fraud (despite losing fraud cases), isn't racist (despite saying &amp; doing racist things). Right. I'm the one who's full of shit. Right.
i dont think being transgender should influence hether or not ur allowed in the military. blaire tries to justify it saying trump probably banned them because dysphoria could get in the way, but honestly i think trump banned it out of pure transphobia.
Trump is not the dictator of America.
LOL. Still not a liberal. I never said every white is racist. But, pretending that racism doesn't exist is as much fantasy as pretending Trump has never done anything wrong &amp; its all fake news &amp; conspiracy against him. Donald Christ is here to save us but I'm too dumb to see it?
trump, it‚Äôs the banning tiktok for me
Quit living in a fantasy. Black doctors, lawyers, etc. aren't bc racism is gone from society. Your argument is that no president has done more for minorities. It's not true. The only person who would say it is would be Trump himself.
You seem to not be reading my responses. I don't support Biden. I don't like him. But, disliking Biden is not a reason to excuse the faults, etc. of Trump.
hello donald trump yes i live in america not a communist country please don‚Äôt take my tiktok away this is a free country
Did what things? Fed. Govt has a spending problem. That has been ignored by every president including Trump. That's why tax money is going to other countries - BC WE OWE TRILLIONS. It's all Dems? By my count, we've had 2 Dem POTUS &amp; 4 GOP POTUS in the last 40 years.
All pols are vile liars, ALL! But Trump is truly a special kind of vile &amp; stupid. It's hard to believe such an ignorant child could exist in a 74 year old body. But capitalism excels at creating vapid, ignorant, selfishish tools. #1
It takes courage and integrity to apologize. We all misspeak sometimes, whether it‚Äôs because we are actually wrong in a belief or we simply miscommunicate our message. Apologizing is something Trump is incapable of. He doubles down or just denies what he said.

Keilar debunks Trump campaign: You've got to shovel the BS  via
He's not getting the job done. Conservatives believe in limited gov't &amp; free trade. Trump? He promised to get rid of the deficit but deficit up more than 1/2 trillion by 2019. Trade wars, even w/ allies. Hasn't ended any real wars. Lies all the time. Hurts relationships w/ allies
You are inspiring. You had the courage to stand up for what is right, unlike your Governor who cowers to Trump. This is typical Republican supression of our democratic values that has become all too normal. You win the John Lewis ‚ÄúGood Trouble‚Äù award.
Time for young Americans to show trump who‚Äôs in charge.
Hey, remember at the beginning of the outbreak when Trump wanted to close the borders to infected countries but was then called racist?
I think there are other reasons they don‚Äôt allow family in the hospital other than the spread. I honestly think they just make elderly feel comfortable instead of helping them. They have to choose who gets ventilators ect.. had Trump not removed Obama‚Äôs policy on preparedness
Our government is busy trying to break Lebanon because the Lebanese government wanted to remove the Lebanese central bank governor Riad Salameh who is as crooked as trump.
It's the "what about the other guy" argument again. I'm not a Biden supporter either. But, disliking Biden or his policies is no reason to ignore the problems with Trump.
When Trump opens his mouth, you should know lies are going to come out of it. Who cares what he has to say on any issue? Whatever he says is a lie. Do you get it! Whatever Trump says is a LIE. A LIE , A LIE. If you believe him, you are dense, mentally disturbed, duped, or dumb.

So, you're just going to blindly support Trump regardless of anything he's done or said? All of the racist things he's said &amp; done don't bother you. How about fraud? Does that bother you? Lying good w/ you too?
Wild statement coming from a woman that supports Trump
This kind of thing isn‚Äôt even worth responding to. It‚Äôs taking Trump‚Äôs bait. I don‚Äôt think that even Trump‚Äôs evangelical base is so deluded that they would take this seriously. The priceless tweet so far is that Trump has been in Stormy Daniels more than he‚Äôs been in a church.

Maybe it makes me a bad person but I couldn't give two fucks about Kanye West and his supposed mental illness. He's a fool that is somehow a billionaire and is trying to doom this country by reelecting Trump.
Advisers to President Trump hesitated to give military options and warned adversaries over fears he might start a war - CNNPolitics
Walter Schaub rightly critiques politicization of Christian faith. One key change I hope to see in the rebuilding of conservatism in post-Trump years, is keeping Jesus out of politics, in coherence to 1st amendment. Separation of church and state.

It is indeed fucked up. Desperate effort by Trump to divert African-American votes. Trump thinks they're fools. üò∑
That‚Äôs WELL under the 2M Fauci predicted!!! So... you all say Trump did a terrible job! Your such hypocrites how about you demonize your demoncratic Governor‚Äôs for allowing older people to be placed in nursing homes where there are outbrewaks! Hold THEM responsible but NO
I've been trying to build a voice on here for a few years, but Twitter suppresses it. The harder the Dems push for Biden, the more and more certain I am that Trump must win in November.
NY Proves Trump‚Äôs Point: 20% of Mail-In-Votes Tossed, Leading To Democratic Win
Biden speaks inartfully about the Black community. Trump pounces. Media then blows it out. I posted about bad campaign coverage a couple days ago.
Yo  Trump refused to be interviewed by Mueller so I mean he kinda set this precedent.
Trump declares TikTok a ‚Äúnational emergency‚Äù. Many parents of teens agree.   Trump signs executive order to ban US transactions with owners of TikTok and WeChat in 45 days
Great  by voting for Kanye you are actually voting for trump. Congratulations! I guess you can't wait for four more years of #TrumpVirus
Yes !!! Thank you for covering our President Trump in prayers.
‚ÄúRubio, Hawley, Sasse and Cotton are inching toward a G.O.P. future. What are the odds they‚Äôll succeed? They‚Äôve got to be way under 50-50.‚Äú
‚ÄúI‚Äôm 100% uncomfortable with the direction Trump does. ‚Äú  Then proves it untrue by setting a silly qualification.
She or Harris would be great picks. Both are highly experienced and extremely bright. Both will be subject to vicious attack and, yes, everything having to do with Obama and Clinton will be relitigated by the R‚Äôs, particularly since Trump‚Äôs foreign policy has been so successful.
Got beachfront property in the Florida panhandle? Trump says he ‚Äòordered‚Äô no drilling off the Florida coast but there‚Äôs no evidence of any such order
Oh, I‚Äôm not denying that he clearly touches too much, but you can‚Äôt throw up his grandson and call him a stranger. It would be like me putting up the pic of Ivanka on Trumps lap and saying ‚ÄúLook at Trump w a teen girl he doesn‚Äôt know.‚Äù
Graham has been one of the biggest disappointments of the Republican Senate. He was once considered a voice that could moderate Trump‚Äôs behavior, but when McCain died, he showed his true colors. He has no dignity. He is no statesman. He is a political windsock.
No shot if Trump said this most people giving him the benefit of the doubt in these comments would feel the same way
Voter suppression. Political manipulation of the stock market. Slowing down the US Postal Service. Misrepresentation of pandemic data. This is just the beginning of the anti-democracy tactics Trump and the Republicans will be using to stay in power.
If they open their borders in Canada, and Trump wins. . . I'm gone!
Michael Berry ( Trump Campaign Holds Evangelical Rally At Vegas Casino To Get Around Rules
I like Trump‚Äôs policies, and I like that he was willing to give up his comfortable life to fight for conservative principles.

This should tell the nation everything about Trump, that those closest to him fear giving him choices and information. They recognize how dangerous he can be. Can you imagine a president so dangerous that his own advisors withhold information? This is the American President.
Still no facts or evidence that TicToc is a nat‚Äôl security problem presented to the public, just general concern. My guess is that this is more retribution by Trump. He wants TicToc muted before the election because they present a political problem for him, not the country.
These are the faces of evil. I hope they all go to jail,but I know they won‚Äôt. We could never get a conviction in the deep state area, but Trump will be hounded the rest of his life for trying to MAGA.  I am so glad I don‚Äôt live in Trump-hating states.
What is your point? Trump shows  up in companies that are manufacturing things Americans need to thank them and show us what is being done here in America. I don‚Äôt care that he doesn‚Äôt throw a pitch at a baseball game. Why do you?
President Trump should commute his sentence.
Joe just give it up,you can't do the job you can't run around like Trump,,your gaffes tells people the real Joe,plus you are being used be the Left,
What does Putin have on Trump? His deference to Putin is undisputed. #TrumpIsANationalDisgrace

Trump bans dealings with Chinese owners of TikTok, WeChat
Hell yes, we got to get everyone to vote Trump,
Everyone feels this way. I'm afraid if it doesn't happen by the election, Trump will lose.
I'm curious, do Trump defenders, who have 2 contort themselves into ridiculous positions daily, ever feel embarrassed in the aftermath? Shamed? Is there any sense of self-loathing? Anger that  perversely persists in antics that put his supporters in ridicule?
President Donald Trump has ordered a sweeping but vague ban on dealings with the Chinese owners of social media apps TikTok and WeChat on security grounds.
Trump and the Republicans can attack no one. Their positions on Civil Rights, Voting Rights, diversity, and inclusion are widely known. They have problems with those issues.
trump did his best to also pretend tha Obama wasn‚Äôt an American either. Hopefully the only place trump would watch the Biden presidency is in a jail cell without his cellphone.
I for one does not want to hear the feelings of an idiot. Not voting for Biden is a vote for trump you numb skull.
Because I trust  I respect this choice. She has called Trump out at every chance she has gotten when he‚Äôs wrong which is all the time.
Well that works if you are proud to be associated with the party who refused to removed a traitor from office, cannot come up with Covid plan, lies to America every day, and has murdered citizens with depraved indifference. That REPUBLICAN PARTY? Trump and his buddies killed GOP!
Biden lives what he believes, Trump lives like the godless shit he is.
First India's potential band now supercell's involved Trump did a huge oopsie
Imagine the Clinton's being banned from having a Charity Foundation like Trump, who STOLE MONEY FROM KIDS WITH CANCER and have been banned to be trustees in a like trust.  The country us burning and you are bellyaching about this insignificant crap.
Republicans should be going after the Covid death crisis....160,000 dead Americans because Trump cannot come up with a freaking plan...thank god we are not in a war with him in charge.  You need to get your priorities straight.
She needs to grow a pair because the left is showing no mercy...Payback for Trump and GOP not removing his treasonous ass from office.  We don't pussyfoot around when our dander is up...Other GOP candidates....beware.  you have awakened your worst nightmare!
Separation of Church and state...practice your faith....you are NOT allowed to force your faith on others.  You want government out of your religion? Keep your religion the hell out of government.  BTW Biden lives what he believes, Trump lives like the godless shit he is.
So it is important to defend Trump's pronunciation of Thailand, but don't call him out on the Covid chaos or his murder of citizens with depraved indifference.  The Trump genocide of Americans.  Wow...good job Donnie on pronouncing Thailand correctly while killing US citizens.
Of course he‚Äôs no saint. Anyone who thinks they‚Äôre voting 4 a saint is stupid.u can‚Äôt distract me from Trump‚Äôs incompetence.
saying Michele Obama pronounces words wrong?  Please. Trump just this week. Thighland and Yo Semites? #trumpmispronounces
As a liberal, I'm perfectly comfortable with it. As a conservative, are you comfortable with the numerous Trump gaffes?
Kayne is an operative to help Trump cheat in order to win the election. Kanye‚Äôs sneaker company received Paycheck Potection Plan that was designed to assist small businesses keep employees. Yet Yeezy‚Äôs are made in Cambodia.
Will you Democrat‚Äôs prevent trump signing executive order to block evictions? Or will you praise him for  bypassing the GOP.... I‚Äôm going with preventing trump because you know.. politics
Headline is wrong.  It should read, ‚Äú15 Stupid and/or alcoholic adults drink hand sanitizer‚Äù.  No one just does that; and it‚Äôs always someone who knows better.  It‚Äôs not an epidemic and Trump didn‚Äôt cause it.
I see the campaign is trying to cover up the racist remark. üòÇüòÇüòÇ. This is why they won‚Äôt let joe debate trump.
True racism slips out from you every now and then, don‚Äôt it joe? What if trump said that? You would call for his removal from office
Seriously. Are liberals comfortable with this??   I get you hate trump. But watch this. It‚Äôs sad.

I'm voting to remove Trump from office. That's my main issue so I don't really care who he picks as VP.

I fully believe it is their aim to break this country on purpose just so they can blame it on Trump!

Heyyyy reminder that we gotta support the VP no matter who it is. Is Biden my first choice for president? Fuckin‚Äô nope. But that‚Äôs who we‚Äôve got. And we‚Äôve got to support and vote for him and his VP to get Trump out of the fucking White House.
If I had balls, I would stick it out until someone figured out that it was a reference to Trump fans criticizing JL for "getting too political." But I really can't handle that stress right now.
With GOP Hubby Andrea Mitchell with her focus on Clinton EMAILS Everyday(EVERYDAY) helping Elect Trump
looking forward to seeing you guys go down in November. Help the people! Back off from Trump!
there‚Äôs no way you will win. You don‚Äôt have a plan on how you‚Äôre going to lead this Nation. The Pandemic? Unemployment? You are making a joke out of the electional process and a fool of yourself. You are allowing Trump to use you. Or maybe that‚Äôs your plan. Sad. üòî

I can never imagine that with Trump.  Not even in a dream.
Shit bite Trump 100%

So sad that he is being used! I know he is not well but he put himself in a position to kiss up to Trump. Trump and those Republicans should be ashame of using a man who is not mentally stable.

When I hear there's some bullshit going down involving Trump and aluminum I can't help but to think about Deripaska, Rusal and that plant McConnell landed for his home state when he helped lift those sanctions to make Deripaska whole with Manafort.
I too am interested to hear more about this country of #Thighland Donald Trump spoke of.
While we making all these jokes about getting trump out of office lets make sure we go out and vote to ensure it ü•±

COLUMBUS, Ohio ( -- Ohio Gov. DeWine tests negative for COVID-19 after positive test earlier in the day, just before he was to meet Trump.

If you really are a Trump supporter, don't play the same game of dirty pool like the MSM and dems do. Be responsible! Here's my proof your tweet is bogus:
Money should never trump human health and human life.  I know the income the rally brings to Sturgis.  One must ask themselves, is this worth the risk now and the long term affects to those who get Covid and there are plenty.  Strokes, permanent lung damage, and heart problems.

The ‚ÄúTwo Corinthians‚Äù trope is tiresome.   In some Christians circles, particularly European ones, this is how the book is pronounced. Trump is not a righteous man but when this line of attack is used it proves some are as ignorant of Christianity as they portray him to be.
Bank Fraud? Tax Fraud?
OMG - what‚Äôs with the ‚Äúwhat most people know‚Äù sh*t?  Biden needs to promise to NEVER speak about African Americans again. EVER!!!!  If it weren‚Äôt for Trump this guy would never be elected.
Yet 38% looks at this and thinks, that is my guy. I want to follow him. Scary. Trump is insane and human garbage.   #TrumpIsANationalDisgrace
His actual history says different. Being sued by the Fed govt (twice) for discriminatory housing practices, removing black dealers from your casino, saying you dislike black accountants, Central Park 5, and many more examples point to the belief that Trump isn't racist as false.
It‚Äôs because anything Trump for even if it‚Äôs good they r against it!
That was a bad take tonight on  Comparing Trump‚Äôs calling BLM a symbol of hate is nothing like what Biden said. BLM funds go directly to Liberal PAC!
Did anyone know that Rudy Giuliani's first wife was actually his cousin. Giuliani seams 2 dog everybody else out but he looks like white trash &amp; now that he's gotten older he's just dumb white trash. And when all this sh*t is up &amp; Trump's out-of-office I smell bars for Giuliani.
Only in the warped state of Trump.
Well, it certainly ain't Trump, his circle of evil and his lying minions....they wouldn't know a truth if it slapped them in the fact.
Well, it may not have been said very eloquently, but I was trying to thank her for pointing out the increase, under Donald Trump!
Sorry, but there is no longer a Republican party. It's now the party of Trump, which is a cult! And, I know things would have been much different if you're father had lived. He's one of the last Republicans that I could truly depend on to do the right thing, in most cases.
YES! It‚Äôs that critical! I would brave Covid to make sure he‚Äôs voted OUT. tRump &amp; GOP are  huge threat to our democracy!
No matter what he pledges to, Trump will never pay up.
Laundered $ from the trump campaign hits different I guess
All of the crap we went through the last four years, how to beat Covid, fixing the economy and creating jobs and getting people back to work....and giving ever GOP repub hell for their part in this Trump Travesty.....the weather....
trump has many stories of how Jesus spoke for the rich and money changers. Jesus also said to cheat, lie and steal every penny from the poor.
Sorry young man. Everything your party touches turns to a disaster. Look, Trump is difficult and abrasive but his administration is doing a great job.
After trump, the bar for GOP presidential candidates will be so low I‚Äôm afraid that any sliver of decency will be rewarded with electoral success. I mean, this man would be a king if we‚Äôd allow him to be, &amp; yet he‚Äôs only marginally losing in polls.  It should be +30 for biden.
If Biden has the ability to hurt God, then Biden is even more powerful than God. Does trump understand the wrath of God?

Since money to trump is God, and Biden is one of the few politicians that hasn‚Äôt grown rich in office, I guess it‚Äôs all about what or who you think God is.
Can you believe Trump accuses Joe Biden of hurting the Bible &amp; hating God, Trump is a Nazi in the WH he's so deranged. Tear gas those folks in Washington so he could take a picture in front of a church holding a Bible, if he keeps going to churches he's going to burn them down.
You can't blame Trump for a virus that no one new how to handle it,and knew nothing about it,
This is why Alabama can‚Äôt have nice things. It‚Äôs a sad fact about our state that both the Confederacy and football will trump just about anything else, including good governance.
People forget quickly that the jobs/careers that most African-Americans hold were won by President Johnson and the Democrats. The claims that Trump brought black Americans their lowest unemployment rate are misleading.
This is war!  Their goal all along!
He is in the WH and his name is trump. Where‚Äôs my $10M?
Right now never Trump means a path to socialism because that is the choice we have in Nov. I choose Trump‚Äôs policies.

Got to wait for Biden to get elected before a vaccine for Covid-19 comes into the picture as a party unity thing according to Joe Biden. Meanwhile Russia has announced they now have a satisfactory vaccine to begin using immediately which is a cure, but wait Democrats have nothing
If trump doesn‚Äôt win it will be because he lost rather than Biden winning. Trump‚Äôs worst enemy is himself.

I take back my prediction about Biden winning now.
She has been a VP contender since she  endorsed Biden. Harris is the first Black woman and Asian American person on a major-party presidential ticket.
The Democratic ticket for president is set. Trump-Pence vs. Biden-Harris.

#BREAKING Joe Biden chooses Sen. Kamala Harris as running mate
I like what I just heard re: the Biden VP choice.
So they have pushed Biden to pick a VP, if Biden dies and he were elected that VP pick would become President and Pelosi might have competition in a fight to manage Congress if VP is a female. What if, then may happen that she cannot accept the nomination in which case a upset.

While you wait for the announcement of Biden's running mate, you should check out the vice-presidential biographies on the U.S. Senate's web page. They're very deep and often surprisingly dark, like Sinclair Lewis was commissioned to write them.
Twitter might break when Biden announces
Kasich does whatever benefits Kasich. He is looking for a cabinet position with Biden. It is pretty slutty, but that is what politicians are.
I really thought the Dems could do better than Biden. The outlook for this nation is now bleaker than ever thanks to the complacency of the #DNC and the #GOP. No faith in this two-party system at all.
Or is she, as the VP candidate, the last to speak before the Biden family and then Joe himself?

I just lost respect for Bernie. It's not ok to point out our country in peril if Biden wins and then say you won't vote. Will a Biden (Dem) presidency be better for the common good or a Trump (Repub) presidency? Bernie knows the answer. Shame on him for not voting.

Does anyone REALLY care who Jill, sorry, Joe Biden picks for his VP?
Sometimes people have to awaken in the gutter before they can think about sobriety. Today Democrats have no pipeline of leaders. They are old and out of ideas. They scraped the barrel and selected Joe Biden. He has been a professional politician for almost 50 years. Ideas? Not.
His goofy, awkward looking, nasal sounding son  said the bike ride was staged. He‚Äôs an idiot. EVEN IF IT WAS, Biden STILL had to get on the damn thing and ride it! Junior probably never learned to ride a bike either.
Seriously, can on January 21, 2021 could ‚ÄúPresident Biden,‚Äù declare a national shower day? It would be appropriate to cleanse the all the sleaze and corruption out the White House
So Pelosi's illegals cannot obtain stardom because of the Biden African-American Diversity Education sessions Joe is offering the murdered Christians in three countries in Africa.

You‚Äôre a brave, honorable soul!  I live in an apartment, so I don‚Äôt have a yard to put a sign in.  I‚Äôve had 3 Biden stickers on my car, all torn off, and noticed a few new dents in my car doors.  I wear my Biden mask everywhere I go, and get petty remarks, Alabama, go figure.
Why? Because Shaun is misleading you? Biden hasn‚Äôt picked a running mate
i can't find any record of biden ever approving any kind of funding for health justice, where are you getting the idea that he has ever "supported" any kind of abortion or health care?
trump's paid for more abortions out of pocket than biden has approved government funding for.    there's lots of reasons to support biden if that's your thing, but he has zero record of supporting health justice generally, and especially not abortion rights.
you realize biden was in a church when he made those "shoot them in the legs" comments, right?
That‚Äôs what everyone said in 2016. Can‚Äôt take this election for granted.  Many people dislike Trump and are disappointed by Biden being in the Democratic ticket. They may stay home.
Thank you  for speaking up!   Alabama Democrats are moms and dads; pastors and laypeople; educators, nurses, and welders. We‚Äôre neighbors who love our neighbors‚Äîfrom the Eastern Shore to Sevenmile Island.

Russia &amp; Ukraine sinking Joe Biden &amp; his son slowly, Ukraine court case filed against Biden in Ukraine. That money Joe &amp; Son took was a Ukraine fund with Russia, Biden is literally guilty.
Joe Biden has no defense for his irresponsible actions, known fully his son had absolutely no expertise in anything the Ukrainian Gas Co had supposedly paid him for, their President fled Ukraine &amp; Biden and his son came back to America with the Ukraine fund. That's it folks.
Soon once Russia and the Ukrainian's got back in-line with the monetary fund of Ukraine Biden took to America Ukraine brought charges against Joe Biden in Ukraine Court.
Biden denigrated himself in Ukraine esp to the Russian financial goals and responsibilities, money owed to Russia somehow was given away to Biden's son and his father Joe came and withdrew his son &amp; money back to America strong arming the Ukrainian Co deal with Russia.
Oh power, perhaps  has more diverse sincerity for the hundred's of dead murdered Christians of African countries than Biden has for the dead Latino's that did not make it crossing the US/Mexican border. Is Biden OK with Hedge Funding, BLM, riots, murders?
Sure Joe Biden worries that Trump will notice hundreds of Christian African-American's were murdered in three countries in Africa following Biden mentioning a learning session he offers African-American's on Diversity which would be a frightening event to the public not aware.

You cannot teach dead people anything especially Diversity Joe Biden, I say You started it with religion aiming to show African-American's being taught in African countries yet when they ended up all dead you fell through the floor like a elephant in the room.
Why is there a JOE BIDEN, NANCY PELOSI, CHUCK SCHUMER? Biden started it about Christians before Trump brought attention to Biden!!!! Now Schumer is flipping the ideology against Trump as starting it on religion.
Did you hear the latest #FakeNews off MSNBC,, Biden wants to teach African-American's Diversity, however, those African-American's who lived in 3 countries in Africa are dead &amp; cannot learn Diversity, Hundreds of Christians Murdered by Islamic Jihadists Across 3 African Countries
Are African-American's now deceased in three African countries  You proud of yourself Biden? Hundreds of Christians Murdered by Islamic Jihadists Across 3 African Countries

Ill wait until I read the platform but I don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm voting for anything when I will for democrats in 2020. I have 0 Enthusiasm about a Biden Harris ticket. If anyone else where in the White House I‚Äôd vote 3rd party and probably will in 2024 if Biden wins.
Can we please have the masked-up rallies for Biden-Harris now? üëèüèΩ We can do this. ‚ù§Ô∏è
Let me be clear on this.   The Trump Campaign will not attack Joe Biden as much now. They will turn their attacks on Kamala Harris. This camp sees her as a dangerous threat and will treat her like she is the one leading the ticket. Mark my words.   KHive, let‚Äôs get to work.
Yes to optics.  I don't care for a lot of Harris' positions, but she's better than Palin.  Minimally when ABC interviews her, it won't be a train wreck.  And did Biden ever have a younger base?  Was anyone of any age ever excited about his run?
Well, Harris is aligned with most of Biden's positions, it's just that being a centrist is uninspiring, arguably unethical, and clearly not what any of us wanted. But yeah no reform for us.
So? Debate skills are not necessary as evidenced by Trump &amp; Biden to achieve where they are now. There will be so many more rules in this debate not like the unstructured &amp; lopsided DNC debates.
It is not up to Biden. DNC only is interested in corporate donors and big dark money.
So what KH debates better. Do debates really count??? As evidenced by Trump &amp; Biden
I believe the effect will be neutral in votes. My point being - debates - so what? Trump &amp; Biden are not the best debaters - that quality did not get them in top spots. And so what if KH is a top notch debater? More security - could be in order...
More accurately, Biden found out today which running mate the DNC chose for him.
Liz Warren is so pissed right now. She raised 3 times of Kamala. All for Joe Biden to drool on himself.
Stacey Abrams was not picked for Joe Biden's running mate because....voter suppression!!!
Yes, I don‚Äôt think Rice has an ambition to be president. That said I think she would make a good one since she is very smart and very tough. If Biden gets elected I have no doubt she will be appointed Secretary of State.

DNC is loyal only to big donors including dark money. I don‚Äôt think Biden has a say - it is the DNC donors making the decision. And if Yang is for removing money out of politics - then not a good fit with the status-quo. My opinion only.
"Trail" not "Trial"- although Biden needs to pass trial &amp; go straight to judgement!
How many years has Biden been in politics?  What has he done in all that time to make a difference? He appears to have dementia

I think you‚Äôll see a run up about a month before the election like IBB tanked into 2016 election. The presidential election is less relevant than how the 11+ states vote on legalization. Gut says all of them will vote to legalize it. If Biden wins no sector will be spared

Biden has a speech impediment making it hard for him to say some words. Trump has well we don‚Äôt want he has.
Look at all the privileged ass hats in the replies saying they won't vote for Biden because he's "just as bad as Trump". There is exactly ONE way to get Trump out of office. Vote for Biden and continue to support other progressive candidates for Congress.
Since Russia is so busy trying to discredit Biden, any truly patriotic American should obviously vote for Biden. A vote for Biden is  a poke in the eye for Putin

Sadly, this seems to be Biden's platform.  Do we actually want Biden to demonstrate how much better he plans to be?  Does he intend to suck just a little less?  Judging from his past, that is the plan.  Biden sucks a little less.
Well, I'm finally convinced.  Trump sucks.  I just wish I had known that--wait, I've known that for five years now.  Aren't you just a "little" tired of this being the only campaign?  Each time Biden/Kamala says something bad about Trump a chance to cite a positive idea dies.

Democrats lauded Harris as a perfect complement to Biden‚Äôs centrist candidacy, but some Republicans argued the move only reinforces their allegations Biden has become a tool of the far left.
I don‚Äôt get it. The Trumplicans are arguing that Biden picked Harris because she‚Äôs black. Then they say she‚Äôs not actually black. How does this even make sense?
Easy... backing the blue does not mean the same as mass incarceration. Imagine a country with  no police. We need the police... we don‚Äôt need the legislation that disproportionately effects the black community which is what Biden and Harris have done.

First  From the very first day of this Administration, President Trump has set our Nation on a path to freedom and opportunity. Joe Biden and Kamala Harris would set America on the path of¬†SOCIALISM¬†and¬†DECLINE.
That pick shows that Biden and the Democrat Party have been overtaken by the Radical Left. Given their promises of higher taxes, open borders, socialized medicine and Abortion on Demand, it‚Äôs no surprise he chose Senator Harris, she is¬†weak on crime and refuses to put America
Ôøº¬† Friend,  It is the honor of my life to serve our Country, alongside President Trump, as the¬†48th Vice President of the United States.  I see that Joe Biden has picked Senator Kamala Harris as his VP nominee.
For anyone who care what they have to say, I got an email in my BS account from the TRUMP campaign and I hope you all don't vote for Biden for the love of your life, your family, your country and your freedom of expression and civil rights.

Hell, criticize them to your hearts content. Kamala has been calling for defunding the police recently though, and picking her was a better move than picking Klobuchar (marginally). But also no one could make Biden look other than he is at this point. He's still not Trump.

It's all for votes!  Biden chose her because he got an ultimatum saying he must choose a black woman.  She's suddenly Black American for same reason. BLM will still demand destruction of America!
Last time I checked Biden‚Äôs never actually been the President during any of those 50 years, whereas Trump‚Äôs been POTUS for the last 4 years and yet he still talks about what he will do and not what he has done because all he‚Äôs done is damn near DESTROY THE COUNTRY! üôÑüôÑüôÑ #ETTD

Biden picks Sen. Kamala Harris as running mate
"JOE BIDEN IS RACIST SO IMMA BE HIS RUNNING MATE" -Kamala
You‚Äôre exactly right I drive about 1500 miles a week all over the southeast. Never see a Biden sign I‚Äôve seen one bumper sticker,one out of thousands of cars
"Joe Biden selects Senator Kamala Harris to be his vice presidential running mate"
Girl what? Do you realize all the sus shit Biden has said when it pertained to integration and segregation. Harris literally called him out on supporting policies of segregationist but it‚Äôs whatever
I DON‚ÄôT mean that you should vote Biden/Harris and then go ignore politics for the next 4 years. No. If you don‚Äôt like the Dem slate, get involved at the lower level. Vote local, vote city, vote county, vote state, vote school board (even if you don‚Äôt have kids), vote dogcatcher.
Look folks, my reaction to the Biden/Harris ticket can best be summed up as ‚Äòmixed, complex, and nuanced‚Äô, but I am still voting for them against Trump. This is not a ‚Äòtake your ball and go home‚Äô moment given how our system actually, y‚Äôknow, WORKS.
No. But I'm not voting for Biden either.
So far the race for a Biden VP is a ‚ÄúRun for the Roses‚Äù.
Im thinking about voting for the first time. I never voted because i dont want to do jury duty lol. Can you give me some reasons to vote for Biden over Trump? Thank you!
Too bad after like a month Biden will be declared not fit for office and then peoples votes for him would be for nothing. She‚Äôll destroy our economy with the things she proposes.
You think wrongly, my friend.
as if biden wasn‚Äôt bad enough he picks kamala as his vip ?!!
Dearest Joseph Robinette Biden ( ),  Thank you.  We. Are. Ready.  Signed,  The #KHiveForBiden   #BidenHarris2020
And everyday calling for Obama‚Äôs birth certificate was, even after he provided it?? This is more proof we have the wrong person in the Oval Office. Don‚Äôt know if Biden is either, but compared to this, I am all for it!
Difference is Biden knew he had mispronounced it, Trump mispronounced it twice &amp; didn‚Äôt know he did anything. We are better off without him. I will always feel that way. Watch the Axios interview, no defending it.
In the midst of a defund the police movement Biden picks Kamala Harris as his VP choice.
So, who‚Äôs trying to listen to me rant about the Biden-Harris ticket, black voters, the DNC speaker list, and more.üò≠ I got the time today.
Joe Biden selects Senator Kamala Harris as his vice presidential running mate.
That would make too much since for black people. Remember this is a dog and pony show.  His selection was premeditated. She is a token black.  She has a track record that spells trouble for our community  No matter who wins, Trump/Biden. The same thing will happen FOR "Black" ppl
Did Sleepy Joe forget that only months ago Kamala Harris attacked him for his racist policies? Now he is handing over the reins of the Presidency to her and the radical left. #al01 #alpolitics
Biden VP pick: Kamala Harris chosen as running mate. Whoop! Whoop!
Don‚Äôt really want to vote for Trump or Biden smh
He was having a real hard time running against Biden  He will now focus his attention on the black woman running as VP.
has spent entire career in upholding the rule of law, which  has spent his entire life trying to avoid.  -
biden will now attempt a law and order campaign
And just like that....Kamala loves Joe Biden. ü§£ü§£ü§£

I‚Äôll gladly vote Biden/Harris, but yeah, not exactly my first choice.
Kamala Harris? Biden? Democrats have duped the "Black" community again.  Do y'all realize how many of our people have been tossed in jail (with the key thrown away) because of the actions and inactions of these two?  Wow #DoingTheSameThingAndExpectingDiffefentResultsIsINSANITY
Biden just announced Kamala Harris as his VP pick! Woohoo!!!
So, Joe Biden is going with Kamala Harris as his VP. I think that she's more risky than some of the other candidates but she's definitely qualified and I have no issue with voting for that ticket.  And neither should any of you.
So Biden picked Kamala Harris for his running mate.

Biden needs foreign policy help because he is always wrong on foreign policy:   Plus, he's a "demagogue."
Ronald Reagan warned us against Joe Biden&lt;br&gt;
In other words, Biden‚Äôs handlers have chosen and informed him who‚Äôs name will be announced today.
Joe Biden has selected his running mate, revealing to top advisers the woman he will invite to join his ticket, two people familiar with the matter say
Advisors tell Joe Biden who they have chosen to be his running mate**
He is as much of a conservative as Biden is of sound mind.
What cognitive issues? Biden has been a gaffe machine his whole career, and there are multiple montages showing Trump and Biden both equally stumbling words and confusing events (eg, just yesterday Trump says 1917 pandemic ended WWII).
Whoever Biden selects as his VP running mate, she will be 1,000% better than our current VP! And I dearly hope that she will speak "truth to power" with the President rather than soulless wimp that currently holds the office!
so when Biden sold our country to China that made him a great vp?
Any debate between Presidential candidates would be a farce because Biden would have the questions given to him before hand as well as his prepared answers.
If it IS #KamalaHarris that Biden‚Äôs handlers choose, which one will it be?ü§î
Exactly. The Trump platform is all about fear &amp; hate-fear of Biden &amp; hatred of other Americans. With no principles/policy to go by, Trump must have conflict to survive -the last 4 yrs prove this. If today‚Äôs America is your happy place, vote Trump. For the rest of us it‚Äôs Biden.
A Biden/Rice ticket pretty much lets  go on to victory by doing not much more than letting the Trump campaign punch itself out. Don't underestimate how many people are *really* pissed at Trump and plan to vote Biden no matter what anyway, so half of this is theater. 2/2
You know why I say Susan Rice is a safe choice? Because, when all the right has on her is Muh Obamagate, there's not much damage that can be dealt to her. Nothing they've thrown at Biden is sticking either, and the Trump campaign is going to be all offense out of necessity. 1/2
Alabama Sen. Doug Jones will be among the speakers at the Democratic National Convention next week, a virtual event at which the party will formally nominate Joe Biden as its presidential candidate.
So it' obvious that if Biden doesn't pick a black woman for his VP then the Blk community will turn to Trump to spite Biden? Just guessing that the BLM would evaporate as they would no longer have the support from all Americans nor a donor base to support them! Blacks for Trump?
With Biden likely to pick a Black woman as VP, here‚Äôs how the media can avoid playing into sexist and racist trope‚Ä¶
Good statement from Bernie but it begs the question: Why have your Bernie Bros taken it upon themselves to disparage every female candidate for Biden's VP? Why have they enlisted Russian bots in their plans? Why are they trashing your stated goals to suit their own agenda? Why?
Reminder to Democrats: VP Pence is not a democrat! Quit trying to get Biden to select another Pence or Trump will win in 2020 by such vocal shortsightedness!
...very much like what is going on now with Biden. Trump listened, and his choice was made by himself, Jared and Ivanka. We now have Pence as VP. The question is do we want Joe to listen to the loudest voices, or do we want him to select a VP that will work hard for us,or a joke?
B.S.    Biden doesn‚Äôt know anything except what he‚Äôs told 2 say! Get real‚ÄºÔ∏è
Man, if Biden picks Susan Rice as his VP; it will be 2016 all over again. I got tired of heating about Benghazi.
Have you idiots heard Joe Biden talk about little kids rubbing his hairy legs in a swimming pool are maybe the one where he‚Äôs riding a cockroach?
Biden is heeding Napoleon‚Äôs advice: ‚ÄòNever murder a man who is committing suicide.‚Äô‚Äù
I encourage Mr. Biden to be as outrageously stupid as his l'il heart desires. After all, he's VERY competent, they tell us.
That could change though, I doubt Biden‚Äôs made up his mind
Then Biden said.... Who's Harry Truman..?
Biden subscribes to the theory that a huge LIE told often will be believed by the masses who don't pay attention. Trump NEVER said he would defund Social Security!
I am voting on November 3 for Joe Biden, I don't care who he picks as VP. The situation is critical.
This is the same man who can‚Äôt quote any scripture that important to him because he doesn‚Äôt read the Bible. If he revered God he wouldn‚Äôt have autographed Bibles. If he was just a little religious he wouldn‚Äôt be judging Biden‚Äôs faith or saying he hates God He‚Äôs a piece of work
49% and to date no debate !! If he can‚Äôt debate he certainly doesn‚Äôt have what it takes to run a county. Of course China supports him... they will own the USA if Biden wins! God help us all.
To play rope-a-dope, at some point you need to be able to land a killer punch. Biden can't.
Folks.... Don't worry, Biden will not be running the Country... His VP and Cabinet will.
Wow.  Pelosi says "China Would Prefer Joe Biden". #DemocratsAreDestroyingAmerica

Yeah you must not listen to Biden speak much. Every time he speaks to a black journalist or commentator, he makes racist comments. His latest where he said ‚Äúcome on man, did you have to get checked to see if you have cocaine in your system?‚Äù (Paraphrased). He is truly racist!
Opinion Communist China is actively helping Joe Biden and Amazon Compost is a active part of the communist China propaganda.
I keep hearing all this talk from Biden advocates about taking away our 2nd Amendment rights.  If you don't have a clue about what's being said, if you have loved ones to protect, keep your guns!  If good people don't have guns, bad people will !!
I don‚Äôt care if someone looks like Gandhi next to Trump, I can‚Äôt about what needs to be done, and Biden doesn‚Äôt go far enough.
No, it‚Äôs not Biden is a moderate. His policies and how he believes they can be achieved are moderate.

About as big as Biden's crowds.
Had a wild thought  Since we know Halloween is pretty much canceled,  why don't we all show up in Super Hero costumes when we vote on November 3rd. With everything going on in this country,  I know I'll feel like a Hero when I vote Biden as our next president
Why isn‚Äôt Biden in jail for graft and greed and using his office as VP to line his pockets and lean on other countries like a mafioso Godfather! He makes he sick to my stomack and Harris is a puke ü§Æ of a woman

Actually?  I think about this shit every time I see somebody say "so Biden went with the cop, huh?".    We've been nipple deep in con men for the past four years; it hurts me to the bottom of my heart to say it, but I think we could use a cop with an axe to grind right about now.
I have a better idea since you‚Äôre so thirsty for Biden , why not just let him be President now ? Trump is obviously not doing it for you . üëçüèΩ
BIRTHERISM = RACISM. I WANT A PRESIDENT WITH POSITIVE QUALITIES. TRUMP TRADES ON THE EVIL IN HUMANITY. I WILL VOTE BIDEN-HARRIS!

Hopefully President Biden fires this guy as his first official act. Many people depend on the post office for meds. This can be a life or death situation.
First, stop whining and acting defeated. Why would you think the full weight of the american people will fail to stop this sabotage of the post office? Did trump succeed in getting Ukraine to harm biden? Did he get caught and made to stop caging kids?

The only thing the Obama-Biden Admin did was drive a bigger wedge between Israel and UAE
THIS.  And it‚Äôs a crime and political malpractice that, until Joe Biden‚Äôs campaign came along in 2019, the only person effectively prosecuting the case against this sort of elitism was a Vermonter socialist.
Joe Biden wrapped up the nomination way faster in ‚Äò20 than Barack Obama did in ‚Äò16.  Biden has united 97% of the party this early, in a way Hillary Clinton never did or could.  Excuse me while I laugh at aides to either pretending Biden‚Äôs not good enough.
Please do not focus on bad things about Biden or Harris (I am fully aware thank you). I want to hear why you support Trump. Make him the priority of your post.
Ok all you Trump supporters I have a challenge for you. I doubt you will respond. I challenge you to only post factual items about Trump. Convince me. If posts are about Biden or Harris, they must be direct quotes or facts that can be proven. Nothing salacious.
Did you see the excerpt from Biden‚Äôs rant against a reporter saying he graduated w 3 degrees, top of his law school class, had a superior IQ. Then they show all the networks doing fact cks. All total Bullshit. Delusion but delivered w such vehemence. He believes his own lies.

Mark Levin: Biden's VP pick Kamala Harris brings 'nastiness' to the table
This man won‚Äôt make promises he doesn‚Äôt intend to keep. Joe Biden and Kamala Harris together will restore our country to the magnitude and greatness we remember.
Above all, in my opinion Joe Biden is a good man. He is a Christian. He practices his faith. He has experience and is respected among world leaders. He has integrity. He has known loss and he has love in his heart. He is strong and knows healing. He is a survivor.
That‚Äôs what we need. Biden is not afraid of a challenge. I like that about him. He doesn‚Äôt mind someone who disagrees with him. He knows when to listen to someone who knows better than him on a particular subject. He respects truth and honesty.
That‚Äôs what grownups are supposed to do. It‚Äôs the president of the United States job to compartmentalize. Joe Biden can do this. Trump can not. Kamala Harris will compliment Joe Biden. She will advise him; not always agree with him. His cabinet will probably be diverse.
He seeks to heal our wounded nation by combining the elite minds from the top of their fields, whether they agree with him or not. As long as the United States of America improves from their knowledge, Joe Biden is willing to listen and act in our best interests.
Vice President Joe Biden is a Democrat. He is not a dictator, an authoritarian, or a neofascist. He would never undermine an election. If he felt an election were in jeopardy, he would allocate funds to ensure a fair and just process.
She is a trash candidate. She wants to ban assault rifles via executive action. She wants to ban plastic straws for some reason. She want socialized Medicare. And she‚Äôs against fracking. Why the hell did Biden choose this woman? He already had California and the black vote.
Fuck Joe Biden
Here ya go for all those that want Biden in 2020. You telling me you agree with his statements? Now all the sudden he‚Äôs changing his mind cause he cares about you? Nope, he wants votes!!! PERIOD!!!
The most troubling &amp; dangerous thing about Trump than is abuse of power,mental health,narcissism,&amp; pettiness is his own goddamn ego! Regardless of what people think of Biden,We need someone better that Trump. 4 more years of Trump and everyone's not gonna stand for it!

Kamala Harris represents 'complete socialist takeover of Joe Biden,' Trump 2020 adviser Schlapp says  #FoxNews
Is the idea here that the Biden campaign is weak and slow because it‚Äôs currently beating the Trump folks by a historically large margin for modern elections?
It‚Äôs really, really popular in media and Very Online circles to dismiss ‚Äúevangelicals‚Äù as a gigantic, lost cause Trump voting bloc.  Thank God the Biden team hasn‚Äôt bought into it.
And I think the biggest reason why is that the Biden campaign ( et al) has made sure these important constituencies aren‚Äôt only being spoken to by the GOP.   makes this point a lot, and it‚Äôs important: we should never surrender to Trump in this space.
Most of these folks never liked Trump to begin with, but none of them even considered voting for Democrats in ‚Äò16. In fact, they took active steps to avoid doing so.  For a few reasons, their calculus has changed drastically in ‚Äò20, and most are now affirmative Biden voters.
The Biden campaign has brought these groups closer together than ever before, at least from my vantage point.  Dozens of ‚Äúevangelical Christians‚Äù I know and love have given up on Trump. The cages, the gassing of protesters, the racism ‚Äî it was all too much.
Boy we saw it first hand. What a horrible President that idiot was &amp; to show how many stupid people are in this Country they elected him twice &amp; that's exactly why I know Biden will win. He doesn't know who he is, but he'll win.
Can you dispose of Biden ? He‚Äôs garbage
Trump supporters: we can't live in fear from something like a virus because we'll die anyway  Same people: *swallows 10 pills and uses essential oils like it's weed* You know, Biden is going to take away all the guns and supports ANTIFA
It helps that the media was dedicated to praising everything Obama/Biden did. Hell, it didn‚Äôt matter if was Fast and Furious, Benghazi, spying on U.S. citizens; the media bowed at their feet. Now the media be as hellüòÇ

This Trump rally in the White House being the chaser to the Biden/Harris shot we got earlier sucks.    It's like drinking milk after the shot of tequilla.  Gross.
Joe Biden has a relatively unique ability among national political figures to make fun of Trump for his whining, and we should be looking for more of it as summer turns to fall.
Joe Biden just said Trump has done nothing but sign executive orders. Hmmm. You talking about that executive order to extend unemployment benefits that your party wouldn‚Äôt pass bc they wanted to play politics?  Please, playaüôÑ
Biden didn't talk in a stream of consciousness garbled mess and Senator Kamala Harris just gave the speech of her career.  It really contrasts with the "me me me" Trump keeps displaying.
I really don‚Äôt understand why people are doing this. Like yes she might be terrible. But Pence/Trump is worse. No Biden isn‚Äôt who we really want. But we definitely don‚Äôt want Trump again. It‚Äôs not like we have a lot of options.
The Biden-Harris Administration. That's the tweet.
Did Joe Biden just call her Komdalisa at his press conference?
WE certainly WILL.  Voting Biden Harris on November 3rd.
Harris will make a great addition to the Biden team.  Just ask Your HUSBAND.
The question at this point is who do you think will do less damage as POTUS? Trump or Biden?
That's California Joel. Her record as the AG is very suspect esp with incarcerating blacks. The Dems already have California for 2020. The front of the ticket remains Joe Biden, whom Kamala accused of being a racist. Lot more problems on the Dems ticket.
You‚Äôd think I‚Äôd be mad that I ran over my damn Wayfarers I‚Äôve had for 5 years but it gave me an opportunity to order some Biden shades

Biden is basically where a third term Ronald Reagan would have been if not worse in his progression, no way they put him on the stage without a script.

These are the asshole who will also say "that was Obama, Biden had nothing to do about it" when we point at economic growth, etc.
Why this conversation period.  Not once has anyone questioned the ‚Äúwhiteness‚Äù of Joe Biden or the ‚Äúorangeness‚Äù of trump.  Please talk about the issues:  Covid-19, healthcare.
Joe Biden was refused communion. He is in complete rebellion. Without acknowledging, confessing and repenting he will remain in rebellion. So at best, he is a luke-warm, rebellious Catholic by name only. You know what the Bible says about being ‚Äòluke-warm‚Äô: Rev 3:16 üî•
Kamala was already announced as the first Indian woman to compete in major election? ü§î Her  family was major slave owners in ‚ÄòBrown Town‚Äôüò°. She called Biden a racist, segregationist and believed his sexual harassment accuser üòÆ. Make up yalls mind ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è.
Dismembering and sacrificing human beings will never be ok. Joe Biden must repent and the Catholic Church must take a stand. God will not be mocked.
To say Joe Biden is Catholic is to say that God and the Church have changed their mind about abortion. That hasn‚Äôt happened.
Except Biden‚Äôs support of abortion.
Along with my rant from previous tweets, America is seeing the largest wage gap between the top 1% and working class since the French revolution.... Neither Trump or Biden will do anything substantial to fix that. IDC if these CEO billionaires ‚Äúworked hard to get where they are‚Äù
We need more people of the working class in office. We need more people of the millennial generation in office. Stop voting legacy politicians into office. They have never cared about anyone but themselves, their pockets, and their big corporations. Biden ain‚Äôt anything special
Y'all. Donald Trump has a racism, narcissism, sexism, and tax fraud problem. His fan base has a racism problem. Stop falling for his bullshit. Biden absolutely needs to right a lot of wrongs, but thinking Captain Cheetoh is better? Embarrassing.
She believes Biden‚Äôs accuser but accepts his VP nomination: such sincerityüòè
I think Trump has been triggered because an amazing Black Woman named Kamala Harris was Biden's VP pick. So instead of being triggered of the 160,00 people that died under his and the accomplices negligence,They going nuts over Biden's VP pick! Everyone already knows time it is!
‚ÄúShe is also the first Democratic presidential or vice-presidential nominee from west of Texas‚Äù
I was a big Juli√°n Castro Supporter. Was hoping to see his name in the mix, but this is an extremely electable ticket. Biden knee what he was doing.
the media just don't get it the person you force on us NEVER WIN!! Kamala Harris isn't going to bring the Black Voters out unless she changes some political views! We're not impressed with Good looks Anymore sorry Biden ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
What pisses me off is the economy under Trump made life good for Biden, Harris and most of the wealthy Dems. Not to mention more work for those so inclined. Unemployed got a raise. And they still wanna tear this house down. Lunacy! Pure Lunacy
I love this so much! Taking back our country‚Äôs soul! Biden/Harris 2020
i AM voting for biden however i will continue to complain abt him &amp; the other one girl!!! i complain every day of my damn life why would this be any different.....
- Biden was Vice President when a man was executed by a firing squad in 2010.   - Biden Was the Senator of Delaware when a Delaware man was executed by hanging in 1996.

Normally everyone. But we're talking about Joe Biden.
So you CAN sleep your way up the ladder. Sara Palin earned her stripes the normal way. Yeah I know this is controversial but I heard her trash Biden till she dropped out. Wonder if HE did. Apparently it doesn‚Äôt matter to him.
Somehow I knew Joe Biden was gonna pick Kamala Harris as VP and Trump reacted by calling her "Nasty" &amp; "Phony Kamala" but it also seems he didn't like the VP choice too! Trump fears strong women,No matter what tricks he pulls everyone already can see through him like a laserbeam!
Daryl, if you are voting for Biden then we are the same ‚Äúus.‚Äù
Something that I‚Äôve learned in the past 4 yrs is that the candidate or even the platform isn‚Äôt the end game of politics. The candidate is the beginning and then you work to ensure that they support the policies you want. That being said, I am ready to vote Biden/Harris on Nov 3rd

I can only speak for myself, but I don‚Äôt like that she‚Äôs been known to turn her back on the black community, her own community, as soon as it proves to be convenient. I‚Äôll still be voting for her and Biden but that‚Äôs just one thing that rubs me the wrong way.

Biden and Harris will be a great team to have in the White House. Time to get good decent smart people back in charge.  Can't wait to vote on November 3rd.
talking about candidates on this website (tm) is a bad time, but I appreciated Kamala absolutely dicing Biden during the debates &amp; him having the wherewithal to be like "yeah, I need her on my team"
President Obama notes, thusly, ‚ÄúJoe Biden nailed this decision.‚Äù
2/2 choice if Biden wanted to focus on domestic policy and sure up a progressive base. With all of that said, Kamala Harris will be a better Vice President than US AG. I believe Rice for Sec. of State and I hope we find the political will to win the senate and make Warren leader
The Obama folks from ‚Äò08 get all the fame, a podcast, tee shirts and the like. And much of that is deserved. But this Biden team, many of them old hands in Washington, has bested even the Pod Bros.
Let me be clear, I think Kamala Harris is the wrong choice for VP because of her ‚Äútough on crime‚Äù tenure as an AG in California. I thought Susan Rice was a much better choice if Biden felt like rebuilding international relations and obligations. I thought Warren was the better 1/
‚ÄúAnd that little girl was me‚Äù!

Kamala Harris is just Joe Biden in a lightskin black woman swatch. Take that how you will. But that‚Äôs my feelings on this situation.
Lmaooo Biden was racist a couple months ago according to Kamala Harris. Now that she‚Äôd become president if he‚Äôs elected he‚Äôs not bad
Biden/Harris sounds more appealing than the Trump/Pence "the country we lead now is a disaster...elect us again to fix it"
And if Biden‚Äôs smart, he‚Äôs gonna go into every Southern state and loudly and openly blame Trump for it happening.
Stop worrying about football and solve the virus and the American economy depression.  This Is Your Dam Job.  Biden will have to do it when he becomes president.
It is NOT about the networks. It is about Trump claiming victory in every state he leads on election night and saying its Fraud when Biden wins due to mail ins. Dems need to make sure mail ins will be counted by election night or emphasize IN PERSON EARLY VOTING
I guess from his politics, Biden believes the world better by killing the unborn...up to the day of delivery. Scripture is clear, God is the author of life. Woe be to those who oppose the Creator of life!
Joseph R. Biden, Jr. just sent me an email entitled ‚Äúre: our historic announcement‚Äù and it‚Äôs not even about his VP selection‚ÅâÔ∏è Sir.
Something we don‚Äôt think about often enough is just how awful the 2016 Clinton campaign was at appearances and visuals, as demonstrated in this graf from today‚Äôs Times convention write-up.  Biden is running 6-7 points ahead of Hillary due, in large part, to this fact.

Roy S Johnson: Hearing that Joe Biden chose Kamala Harris... I thought about so many bold, bad-a Black women in #Alabama who are leading, organizing, and galvanizing our political landscape.
Great VP choice Biden couldn‚Äôt do any better
Also, hell of an admission that Biden won't be able to handle "bad crap".
Also, just FTR, I did not vote for the President the last time, and I certainly won‚Äôt this time around. But I will not be voting for the Biden/Harris ticket.
The TLDR is this: I think all things being equal (i.e. mental fitness), a Harris presidency would yield more ‚Äúprogressive‚Äù outcomes than a Biden one. That‚Äôs likely more scary to me than you, but that‚Äôs where I‚Äôm coming from. (End, I guess)
This again also assumes Biden is ‚Äúall there.‚Äù Our current president is clearly unstable, but there are real concerns about Biden‚Äôs mental acuity. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs just a right-wing talking point. Biden may be subject to whomever he surrounds himself with at this point. (10)
I have a hard time seeing Biden pushing through a true Medicare for all or single payer system, but I can see Kamala doing the same. (9)
Finally, there are the reasons I think she‚Äôd be worse than Biden. Both have a horrible record on CJ so that‚Äôs a wash. But when it comes to matters of other domestic policy, I do feel Harris is more of ‚Äúthis progressive moment.‚Äù I‚Äôm going off what I saw on the trail and the past.8
Good luck with our country moving toward socialism. I am with your father, and hope he gets well. Also, wishing you well but hope you will research policies of Biden. The platform of the left is not moderate and will be the destruction of our country.

Here is something from three months ago. But I hadn‚Äôt seen anything about this until that Biden tweet tbh
I hear you... as I mentioned two heads of the same snake. I wasn‚Äôt trying to diminish what Trump has done. I just can‚Äôt fathom why Biden is the democratic choice. We‚Äôve got to find better people to run.
Yeah, China wants Biden to win so he can dominate the US again.
Biden disproportionately weakened the black nuclear family through laws he sponsored . Trump has tweeted so many things that have been questionable. I appreciate your taking the time to respond. #antiracism
2/2 one law that treated crack cocaine as significantly worse than powder cocaine and ended up disproportionately punishing African Americans. Biden‚Äôs 1994 omnibus anti-crime law is blamed for accelerating incarceration rates, especially of black men.
1/1 I hear you. I think they‚Äôre 2 diff heads of same snake. Biden just gets a pass and he has written laws that have absolutely devastated black families.
Not a defender of Trump. Some things you cannot defend ..Just curious do your tweets mean you‚Äôre a Biden supporter ?
Also that Biden doesn't even know it's been released, let alone had anything to do with writing, you know, the, the thing.
Trump says he will fight for ALL American citizens to have prosperity and security. Biden just talks about the blacks.
Trump claims Biden 'no longer worthy of the Black Vote' in wake of diversity comment
One consolation of a (hypothetical) Biden presidency will be the press having to play janitor for whatever Joe vomits out.  Nothing they can take inspiration from like with Obama, just endless "what he really said/meant was..."  They're going to be so depressed by 2024.
In order to support and vote for Biden, a documented racist at his core, they end up condoning and propagating racism with that support! - Stephen Fuller
Biden‚Äôs racism has ALWAYS been there. It‚Äôs apart of his core as a man. Yet, the Democrats continue to give him a pass! By doing so, the Democrats simply are not credible , their arguments are not valid, and they lack any standing in any serious discussion about racism.
If Biden is incapable of debating or knows he is incapable and afraid, how about at least have 3 rads (Dems) vs 3 conservatives ( Republicans) on stage for 2 hours and debate 5 major issues predetermined by national polls. 1/2POTUS made his press briefing in Washington on time, if you only paid attention to them. Here is your Communist trying to babble from his hideout. Thinks he's in his sister's basement. Biden doesn't know his sister from his wife. Commies will pull him, watch.
In a world that sees Biden become President, I‚Äôd much rather  be a perpetual &amp; belligerent thorn prodding Biden in the side from the left in the Senate.
One of the best moves Trump could do to rattle Biden is pardon Snowden and invite him to a debate. üòÇüòÇ
OK so what if biden made a deal with trump to just get in office and ruin every possible thing he could so that he could run against him in the 2020 election and people would settle for him because we NEED to get trump outta office and it‚Äôs all a big conspiracy
and when Joe Biden actually took action on Corona virus, he took the wrong action. He encouraged people to vote in person, if they were feeling healthy. This went against CDC guidelines.

Also based on what I have read recently, the President can only really issue a pardon for federal charges. So a state AG could go after him on charges at the state level (like in NY). No reason for Biden not to pardon, as I see it. Sets a bad precedent.

My point it that we have to focus on getting them in. We can do that AND address their shortcomings, but getting them in is priority 1. Obama wasn‚Äôt progressive but we made progress on which, with Biden, we can build on. Was it everything, no. But it was a good step.
Biden should debate when Trump produces his Tax returns

I think we get him elected and then push. His policy/action is superior to Trump‚Äôs in every way, so I think the focus right now needs to get Biden elected. Then I think we can press hard for progress. Not ideal, but the alternative is Trump.
Oh I have no issues with criticizing the left people. None at all. I just think that we also need to, despite those criticisms, encourage people to vote for him. Biden wasn‚Äôt my choice at all. Neither was Harris. But this ticket can win and we need to support it.

I will not be voting for Biden (nor Trump) in this presidential election. The DNC has let us know for the last time that they don't give a crap what their constituents or the US want by selecting Kamala Harris as the VP pick. I know when to get out of an abusive relationship.
You're not selling me on Biden, if that's your goal. I am voting Green b/c they are offering Medicare for All, a Green New Deal, and substantive criminal justice reform like reallocating police funds to community funds. To convince me to vote D, offer the same or better.
A president should have judgement, Biden exhibited failed judgement in this crucial moment. That's all.
I‚Äôm so very happy! Biden-Harris is a winning combination and you can see that the GOP are terrified! It‚Äôs glorious to watch them squirm. They all need to wear diapers now.
I think it's important to ask ourselves why we, as individuals, feel the former is futile. Consider when you have ever met an enthusiastic Joe Biden voter. Consider that ~40% of the eligible voters stayed home in the 2016 general. Is it math? Or is it something else?
Yes to optics.  I don't care for a lot of Harris' positions, but she's better than Palin.  Minimally when ABC interviews her, it won't be a train wreck.  And did Biden ever have a younger base?  Was anyone of any age ever excited about his run?
Mr. Biden would like to have a word with you, Bishop.
Well, Harris is aligned with most of Biden's positions, it's just that being a centrist is uninspiring, arguably unethical, and clearly not what any of us wanted. But yeah no reform for us.
No.  Joe Biden voted for the Iraq war, voted for NAFTA, and authored the racist crime bill. Kamala Harris positively laughed at the thought of locking up the parents of truant children and fought to make sure that evidence that would free an innocent man was kept hidden.
Depending on the polls. If close, will hold my nose &amp; vote Biden/Harris. If not, will vote Green or do a write-in. Will try &amp; focus on who to vote for down-ballot. Priority is now non-electoral politics.
On top of just accusing Biden of being racist, rapist, and pro-segregation just a few months ago? Lmao that shit is hilarious
So? Debate skills are not necessary as evidenced by Trump &amp; Biden to achieve where they are now. There will be so many more rules in this debate not like the unstructured &amp; lopsided DNC debates.
Trump is gonna kick his old wrinkley butt. Its a joke actually. Compare them really. Its a no brainer. Biden is history. No one I mean no one in their right mind will vote for him. There is not that many stupid people here in the US. Its getting close but no.
It‚Äôs an of guard picture, taken at the right moment and no context, used by a lot of trolls and bots to try and discredit Joe Biden. They been doing this since Obama was pres. Heres one of Trump with his preteen daughter looking like she‚Äôs twerking on him
Ha ha, she was chosen by the DNC and Biden had to play along. She‚Äôs full of crap just like him. They pander to anyone for a vote.
Trump is a racist joe Biden is a little less racist - y‚Äôall
All right, ready to convince the first person... joe Biden?! Uh oh.
Biden actually needs our votes and elected to nominate a ‚Äútough-on-crime‚Äù DA in the midst of protests for police accountability. You think he‚Äôll care once he‚Äôs in power?
It riles up the base and it informs those who are politically ignorant because they don‚Äôt pay any attention that Biden is a racist, which they may or may not care about.   This won‚Äôt change the minds of liberals who were OK with him raping a woman though.
LoL actually Trump and Barr would just write up a report that said Democrats interfered in the election because China and üôà [I‚Äôm just gonna pick another] Iran wanted Biden to win and would launch an investigation into that and hold hearings and appoint US attorneys etc.
If Wall Street is glad Joe Biden picked Kamala Harris, where does that put all of the leftist "occupy Wall Street" folks?
Where's #MeToo now that Joe Biden is the Presidential Nominee?  Will Madonna want to blow up the WH if he wins?
Good so we agree that Biden is creepy. Better than being a confirmed rapist I guess.
All you need to know about Kamala Harris  1) Believed Biden's accusers 2) Called Biden out for supporting segregation when she was in school 3) Is descended from a slave owning family 4) The pilot of AF2 will radio the tower with "heels up" when taking off
How Joe Biden chose Kamala Harris: Inside the history-making VP pick
Don‚Äôt forget about the batshit Barr report about Biden‚Äôs son or something that will drop in October!
Sounds like 2012. But it was for Paul Ryan. And his VP opponent? Biden. And Biden "won" that debate.
I wonder: What will the Dems and Biden/Harris do if/when Trump attacks them from the left?
Photo Gallery: Meet Biden‚Äôs VP choice Kamala Harris
So define success for a guy like Joe Biden? Is he successful? Is it because he was elected each time? You don‚Äôt know Trump or Biden personally you just hate or love because someone told you to.  Be honest with yourself. What policies are you for or is orange man bad enough?
Regardless of how you feel about Biden, we need to vote for Biden because the next president will replace RBG. We don‚Äôt want another Brett Kavanaugh.
Harris will be the end of Biden's campaign. Like when McCain picked Sarah Pailin
Unlikable Biden just picked one of the least likeable presidential candidates that democrats didn't even pick for the nomination, and now you want us to believe this is the winning ticket?ü§£ü§£ü§£ get the fuqouttahea!
&lt;shiver&gt;   And I‚Äôm arguing with a black dude in the military right now saying he‚Äôs voting for Kanye and fuck Joe Biden because his portfolio has been constantly increasing.
It's still true. I'm not going to pretend that Kamala Harris and Joe Biden are something that they're not. They're not progressive, they're not for the people, they're not an inspiration, they're a stop-gap. I voted Democrat for the last time; I won't be doing it again.
Ok..... But she's the VP pick. Biden does not oppose fracking.
Even Biden himself is doing it, the you ain‚Äôt Black comment for example - More Black people would be willing to vote for him if he had simply said nothing at all than trying to shame or guilt them into supporting him.   People really dont like being told they have no choice Lol
I think its about the fence, people can hate Trump, but having your own community treat you like youre dumb if you dont 100% agree or you dont see Biden as much better, or any opinion that isnt get Trump out at all costs - those are votes that could be had if they werent off put
Mr. Terrell, thank you for sharing your view about Biden's running mate.
If you vote for Biden, you support a racist segregationist.....  If you accept the nomination from a racist segregationist, you're desperate
Politics is all about persuasion though, and the way some of your tweets come off may make people want to double down on how they feel about Biden and Harris.   It lends itself to the same feelings of hopelessness and lack of choice that cause people not to bother voting at all
When I think of all the great people Biden/Harris have to choose from when replacing Trumps cronies, i get giddy with joy!   Warren, Beto, Buttigieg, Abrams, Col. Vindman, Yovanovitch, and more!
These replies treating Kamala like Paul Ryan in 2012(v Biden btw, who actually won that debate) even though we seen Tulsi already drag Kamala on a debate stage this year.
Maybe educate yourself on what the "National Debt" actually is.  44 increased the ND over 10 trillion, much of that became laundered money to elites. 44 and certain people in Congress were given millions. Thats how Biden got his millions.
Hey leftists form a real opinion instead of telling us what you heard about on the news Trumps not racist but Joe Biden and kamala Harris both are racist and flip floppy morons don't believe me I encourage you to look it all up yourself there's plenty of documentation üòâ
Taylor Swift is out here telling people about Biden unifying America, when literally every song she sings is about a guy who won‚Äôt unify with her.   And my wife will confirm, I don‚Äôt dislike her music. I just find it ironic.
Talk yo shit but remember this Biden/Harris ticket is what we voting for come November.
Obama &amp; Biden were Spying &amp; Lying. #MAGA2020Landslide #TrumpPence2020
Biden can not come out at night. Dementia,Sundowners Syndrome cause behaviors to escalate, such as mood changes, anger, crying, fear and wandering. Sundowning is thought to be triggered by fading light. The symptoms can get worse as the night goes on and usually better by morning
Can't Wait for Kamala to make "MinceMeat" of Phoney Mike in a debate.   #returnsanityvoteJoe
It is not up to Biden. DNC only is interested in corporate donors and big dark money.
Kamala Harris just single handedly changed the slogan from "Ridin with Biden" to "Ridin Biden"
So you‚Äôve finally come to terms with the truth about Biden.
If the country wanted a black woman for president then Joe Biden wouldn‚Äôt have won the democratic primary ü§î.  She isn‚Äôt qualified. This should be entertaining
How are we supposed to believe anything Kamala says if she can't even stand by her own statements that Joe Biden is a racist sexual predator?
Of course joe Biden would pick the fucking cop as his running mate.
I think Biden knows he doesn‚Äôt stand chance so he picked a Non starter
Ryan Knight is actually looking out for the people, which is more than Crime Bill Biden and Cop Kamala can say. Let's not try to rewrite history here. Biden is racist and has shown that many times, and Kamala isn't much better. They're better than Trump, and that's it.
Imagine all this shit with police and protests and riots happening and then Biden ‚Äúchooses‚Äù Kamala Harris that was Indian-American and now is African American to be VP...... the Democrats cannot get more stupid.
I may vote for Biden/Kamala, but I foolishly hope her earlier criticisms of Biden about racism and sexually predatory behavior were sincere. These are issues affecting everyday lives, and it just kinda seems like it was reduced to a political attack.
Today is a horrible day for the USA.  was added to  crazy ticket.  Folks, if you vote these two into office your next president won‚Äôt be Joe Biden...it‚Äôs a vote for #kamala because Biden is mentally compromised.  #VoteTrump2020
I do not think Biden would be a good President.
Ordered my yard sign and a bunch of other Biden/Harris swag, not that my neighbors have any doubts with the  yard sign and the  bumper sticker. Gotta make a bold statement when you're a blue voter in Alabama!
Completely agree with the Senate races. However, as an Alabama voter, what incentive do I have to vote for Biden/Harris?
She believes Biden‚Äôs sexual assault accusers but happily joins him as his running mate. She has zero morals and would blow anyone to further her career.
Thank you Team Joe and the Biden Camp for making this happen. Now that you have us, we‚Äôre going to the White House. üíõüêùüíõ
In one sentence you complain about Kamala being disrespectful to Joe Biden, and in the same sentence you call him‚Äùsleepy joe.‚Äù Projection anyone? Can you say misogyny?
This. Warren was my top pick for the Democratic ticket but you know what? She was one among many who would make a great President. So I‚Äôll be proud to support the Biden/Harris ticket and in the future Harris for President. Let‚Äôs #SaveTheRepublic and vote #BidenHarris2020 Nov 3rd!
I love Warren, but Harris is a solid pick, and I'm going to hang my Biden/Harris shirt next to my Persist shirt and wear the heck out of both. If Warren could be gracious and supportive today so can everybody else.
Jill Biden picks Kamala Harris as VP. There, fixed it for you.
Biden never had a chance in the first place between his comments on black people and Trump
In an effort to even the playing field, Barron Trump will debate Joe Biden
So Biden/Harris is worse than Trump/Pence????  I‚Äôm willing to listening!  No one has ever explained it to me so please inform me so I won‚Äôt be confused.
I don‚Äôt know what is happening locally in Seattle. So you‚Äôll have to discuss that with someone familiar with that overall. In any case, it doesn‚Äôt matter. It still doesn‚Äôt change the fact that we need to elect Biden.
Democrats know their constituents have the attention span of a gnat, so remembering something like this will definitely be forgotten
I‚Äôm not voting for Biden, but every time I see a Republican claim that Biden/Hariis is far-left, it makes me want to vote for them a tad bit more than I previously did...
I don‚Äôt want any gear with Biden‚Äôs name on it.   Just put K A M A L A across the chest on a fitted black tee, pls.
Serious question didn‚Äôt she come out and say we must believe the sexual assault accusations made by Mr. Biden‚Äôs accuser. Something about women must be believed. Just wondering what changed her mind so fast
Legitimately, probably Warren, who‚Äôs CFPB plan Biden also fought üòî
Biden just really solidified his win by choosing Kamala üòÇ
So what KH debates better. Do debates really count??? As evidenced by Trump &amp; Biden
Also, Biden himself has hinted at being a one-termer and anointing his VP as future leader of the party, so while it might have mattered less before, this one is much more determinant.
I believe the effect will be neutral in votes. My point being - debates - so what? Trump &amp; Biden are not the best debaters - that quality did not get them in top spots. And so what if KH is a top notch debater? More security - could be in order...
More accurately, Biden found out today which running mate the DNC chose for him.
Liz Warren is so pissed right now. She raised 3 times of Kamala. All for Joe Biden to drool on himself.
So her accusing Biden of being racist and pro-segregation just doesn‚Äôt mean shit because she‚Äôs pro UBI... MAKE IT MAKE SENSE LMAO WEAK
In case you're wondering, YES, the Biden/Harris merch is already up on the campaign store, and YES I'm going to get some after dinner.  needs a t-shirt. :)
Aight here me out. Hard Knocks type show but following the speech writers for Biden‚Äôs campaign
All jokes aside, I seriously can‚Äôt think of two living people more responsible for the overcriminalization of disadvantaged minorities than Joe Biden and Kamala Harris.   This ticket, with everything going on right now, is peak irony.   #KamalaHarrisForVP  #JoeBiden
I'm glad that's settled. Get me a yard sign for Biden AND Harris, and let's get on with winning the whole show in November. FIGHT FOR EVERY SEAT IN EVERY RACE IN EVERY STATE. Leave no GOP enabler in office.
But I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs immediate. People have been not wanting her as a candidate and I‚Äôm not here for Biden at all. Will I still vote for them yes but I don‚Äôt think they are vastly different than a lot of the current administration, they just aren‚Äôt as loud or crass about it
Love this! Her theology must be vibrant and inclusive. She will be able to speak faith language to different groups of people. Good on Biden! Are you excited by this choice?
So if Biden is elected we will have to learn Chinese *and* French?  Cool.
She's Joe Biden's pick for Vice President. Who is Kamala Harris?

Harris is an excellent and smart choice in so many ways. This shows Biden is a fighter and is not afraid to build a strong team to lead this country. Harris challenged him and he stepped up and now they team up. Admirable!45 would have played the pity game cuz that‚Äôs his brand.
Way to go  !! You made an amazing choice. I can't wait to vote for a Biden/Harris ticket.
Joe Biden VP pick: Sen. Kamala Harris. Let‚Äôs get to work.
Don‚Äôt think Susan Rice won‚Äôt be in an active and visible role in a Biden administration.  State dept, probably.
Stacey Abrams was not picked for Joe Biden's running mate because....voter suppression!!!
Yeeeeeah this is when it gets murky, innit. Harris, Biden, Trump, and Pence have all done things that are morally/ socially/political unacceptable. I don't think any should be representative. Obviously some more than others. But we need change, and we won't get it immediately.
To be fair, that's pretty much exactly what they're saying about Biden too. Sounds like a couple of moderates to me.
Right now it‚Äôs about preventing further regression. The Trump admin is hellbent on stripping LGBTQ+ and women‚Äôs health rights. They are filling the SCOTUS and lower courts with conservative justices...this can have an impact for generations. We have to vote Biden.
How y‚Äôall feel about Kamala Harris as Biden running mate?
Yes, I don‚Äôt think Rice has an ambition to be president. That said I think she would make a good one since she is very smart and very tough. If Biden gets elected I have no doubt she will be appointed Secretary of State.
Wrong!  I know of NO women who favors Biden- Heels up Kamala- resume the position that got you were you are - you passed the sniff test- Don't blow it üë†üë†üë†üë†ü§£
Joe Biden clearly picked Kamala Harris as tribute to recently fallen pro wrestler Kamala. That is what I choose to believe.
Honestly, it can‚Äôt matter right now. We have to stop Trump. I know it‚Äôs frustrating, but we have to vote for Biden and encourage others to do so as well. The future of this country depends on it.

Being a one issue voter (defund police) is a bad idea. Similar to people who vote republican just because of abortion. You aren‚Äôt ever going to agree with everything, but Biden and Harris are clearly far more capable of managing our govt than the damn circus that‚Äôs there now.
Democratic Party Presidential Ticket! Biden/Harris Congratulations! #JoeBiden #KamalaHarris
You do understand that defunding does not mean eliminate police forces and take all of their money right? And getting Trump out is the MOST important thing. We cannot go on like this. It is unethical to do anything but vote for Biden.
I, personally, am very excited about Kamala Harris as VP, more excited than I was about Biden as president (tbh, I wasn‚Äôt all that excited, not at all).
If Joe Biden didn‚Äôt want me to vote  all that‚Äôs all he had to say.
Don‚Äôt be like this. I don‚Äôt think anyone is thrilled but we NEED Trump out of office. We can squabble about getting an ideal candidate next time. In Nov, it has to be Biden and Harris. Please just encourage voting, let‚Äôs get Trump out, and move forward.

...the fact we have to pick between two different scum bags should say enough about the current state of our nation. A lot of people are supporting Biden just so Trump isn‚Äôt the president anymore, and I the homophobic and racist isn‚Äôt from the actual person but their policies.
Wow cannot believe Im about to have to block so many WHITE people for immediately being pieces of shit after Kamala was picked as the VP. Im all in for the Biden/Harris ticket
I mean, that‚Äôs a big reason why I personally don‚Äôt like Biden. So to say that the reasons he‚Äôs ‚Äúdemonized‚Äù are not based in truth is very shortsighted and letting your bias cloud your judgement. There are many legit reasons to dislike Biden, just like trump. More so for Trump tho
She‚Äôs so nasty, damn good choice. Until she dropped out she was getting this 69 year old southern white boys vote. I‚Äôm damned proud Joe picked her. Great choice!!!! She could be President and It shows Biden‚Äôs good judgement.
know Joe Biden ad sierra club.
Are you crazy.  He was not the one to get sued for housing discrimination you and your father were!!!! enough said . joe biden black voter not you!!!!!!
I applaud Shaun King for supporting Biden and Harris. Putting aside your personal feelings for the greater good (Defeating Trump) is what we all need.
From the start, some Biden advisers saw Harris as a logical choice. She was among the party's most popular figures, a deft debater and a fundraising juggernaut.
She‚Äôs going to bat for the idea that women are capable and qualified, not necessarily for Biden.
No centrist would want Biden or Trump. Honestly both are just serving their corporate donors and not the people.
I'll vote for trump or not at all tbh. I was grudgingly voting for Biden after he was picked by the DNC (not the american people) to be the nominee. Now Harris was only wanted by Wall Street, not voters.   Its shameful to think Biden will be any different from Trump as president.

Bernie lost the progressive vote as soon as he bent the knee for Biden and gave up everything he stood for.
Sadly they know that progressives will grudgingly vote Biden so they chose Harris specifically as a slap in the face to progressive views instead of shoring up the vote. They already know their eggs are in one basket and want to stomp out all the resistance to their corruption
Honestly if you are a progressive, neither Biden nor Trump will give you anything that you want and they want you to lose hope.
is very much against the people. The Kamala pick was also just another slap in the face to any progressive who tries to convince themselves that Biden is even a little bit forward thinking with the likes of Warren or Sanders whispering in his ear.
Thoughts on Kamala VP Pick: Biden is absolutely just a figure head with no real policies that he has other than whatever Wall street tells him to do. So with Kamala being his VP, her policy will ultimately dictate his. She has a shitty history from when she was a prosecutor &amp; 1/2
Kamala Harris, congratulations but how are you voting on take our guns away when blacks are killing blacks,#1 crime in America always to this day. You and Biden are a joke,leave our country and know what opressions about,from a white God Fearing loving man that despises you
Congrats on becoming Biden's running partner. #KamalaHarrisForVP
After reflection and a quick informal social media review concerning Biden's choice of Kamala Harris, I have determined that people who weren't going to vote for Biden still aren't and people who supported Biden still do.
So tell me Rick, you voting for Biden this year? Really? You are going to support a candidate who believes its ok to murder babies in the womb?
I need this $400 unemployment to start coming asap so I can buy Biden/Harris Masks, Bumper Stickers, and Yard Signs ASAP!
Kamala: I believe the survivors of Joe Biden  Also Kamala: ‚ú®Joe Biden‚Äôs VP‚ú®
Biden needs to watch his food and drinks...it would be just terrible if someone slipped him something...
Mama doesn‚Äôt like Pence being alone with women, so Biden can chaperone.
Not crazy about her but then I don't like anyone.  She was the obvious pick when Biden said he would pick a minority woman. Her primary performance was underwhelming, she won't add her state to Biden column, but she will help secure black voters and progressives.
Congratulations President Trump‚Ñ¢ on Candidate Joe Biden's¬© naming of Kamala Harris¬Æ as V.P. pick.
He legit thinks they just named Kamala from the 80s WWF as Biden's VP.  Also, apropos of nothing, my phone tried to change Biden to Vixen, so I think my phone is drunk.
I‚Äôm excited for Kamala Harris. Biden is still CREEPY AF but I‚Äôll take my chance with him.
That's exactly what the debate will be like...Biden will be given the questions and his staff will put the answers on cue cards!!!
Ronna, I truly don't believe Biden could make it for 4 years!! I'm serious!
ü§îWell, Well, Well, between Biden saying "they gonna  put y'all back  in chains" and Kamala changing the way she speaks in front of black audiences, We have a COMPLETE RACISTS COCKTAIL!!üò±üòÇüòÇüòÇ
Fox news has been a platform for the democrats ALL DAY!! Democrats don't have enough guts to admit Biden is incompetent!!
BREAKING on #VP choice:  selects CA Senator  as his running mate. #KamalaHarris is the 1st black woman to compete on a major party‚Äôs presidential ticket.
Do you agree with Biden's choice of running mate? More details. &gt;&gt;&gt;
I couldn‚Äôt be happier!! She‚Äôs gonna be great VP. Damned proud of Biden
Seriously tho, Kamala Harris? The woman that has made a fucking fortune on the false imprisonments of minorities? The woman that has ‚Äúbacked the blue‚Äù since it was a ‚Äústance‚Äù. This is who everyone is proud of Joe Biden for picking? YGMFU.
LMFAOOOO Joe Biden picked Kamala Harris as his VP. ü§Æü§Æü§Æ. It‚Äôs like he‚Äôs screaming ‚ÄúAJ don‚Äôt vote for me‚Äù. DONT FUCKING WORRY
Joe Biden names Sen. Kamala Harris as his running mate, making her the first Black woman on a major party‚Äôs presidential ticket
i came to see what y‚Äôall had to say bout biden/harris ü§£
Does joe Biden know?
So she will run the country if they're elected. We all know Biden can't do it.
Joe Biden has just named Kamala Harris as his VP running mate. Now it‚Äôs time to really work and get this man to stop raging crazy stuff end get him in that White House
Love the Biden - Harris ticket. You have my vote and financial support. üëçüèø
JUST IN: Joe Biden has decided on his running mate: Sen. Kamala Harris.
Democrats close to the campaign say an announcement is imminent, and could come as early as Tuesday.
More accurately, Joe Biden‚Äôs handlers tell him they have chosen a running mate for him
I would put nothing past Joe Biden, including that he's a sasquatch with a good waxing regimen.
FLASHBACK: Robin Williams Rips ‚ÄòRamblin‚Äô Joe Biden, ‚ÄòCome Here Joe, Sit ...
Amen. John Kasich is a damned Patriot. The real deal. The only true Republican left that doesn‚Äôt call themselves ‚Äúformer‚Äù . God bless him. We need a strong second party. I pray President Biden builds a bipartisan cabinet and really tries to heal our country from the bitterness.
Yep but every time he speaks it‚Äôs another Biden campaign ad
You got it all wrong. Biden goes to the basement and stays. Trump was whisked away but came back to finish Biden just stays in the basement and waits for the sky to fall
Of course they prefer Biden. Puppet.
Yeah if the league of women voters wasn‚Äôt good enough for you I didn‚Äôt think that would be I‚Äôm beginning to think that the only source you‚Äôll accept is Joe Biden‚Äôs website
Have you heard the way Biden talks about children?
The more we talk the more I think you‚Äôre just here to push people away from Biden and towards Trump
Yeah well no he doesn‚Äôt shows your lack of research
Biden lost the candidacy in 2016 to a person who then lost to Trump its hugely egotistical of him for un and steal votes from Jo. You see how that logic works out?
1. She gets into the debates and destroys Trump and Biden and wins in a landslide
How have I shown this by not voting for Biden?
I‚Äôm not trying to rationalize anything I think you‚Äôre mad because there‚Äôs a candidate better than Biden
Biden and Trump are and I support neither
No you‚Äôre right but continuing corporate subsidies, continuing the war in the Middle East, gun control, continuing the war on drugs, continuing the militarization of the police and many other things are impossible enough for me to not vote for Biden or Trump
Mathematically she can though she‚Äôs on enough ballots to hit 270 so let‚Äôs get her on the debate stage then Trump and Biden can prove why they are the better candidate
You keep saying that but ya know I just don‚Äôt believe it maybe you should keep repeating it over and over instead of providing a reason for me to vote for Biden other than he‚Äôs not Trump
I wouldn‚Äôt vote for Biden anyways I‚Äôm not siphoning votes from anyone and if you believe I am then you‚Äôre admitting that Jo‚Äôs policies are better than Biden‚Äôs but #BlueNoMatterWho ammiright
And it‚Äôs not supporting trump because Biden and nobody else is entitled to your vote
I like to hear your plan on this Pandemic not some babble about Joe Biden.
YES!!! Russia is responsible for all the Trump signs and flags I see everywhere!!  And they must be the ones taking down all of the Biden signs!! because I haven‚Äôt seen ANY!!
I AGREE VP BIDEN! WE WILL VOTE COME HELL OR HIGH WATER,SLEET,SNOW,STORMS,ECT.. BLACK PEOPLE HAVE DIED FIGHTING FOR OUR RIGHTS TO VOTEEEEEEE !!! THE ONLY WAY WE DON'T VOTE IS DON'T GO TO THE POLLS! TRUMP IS TRYING TO STEAL THE ELECTION AGAIN, SUPRESSING VOTES,CLOSING POST OFFICES!
Ah, so it‚Äôs the Russians putting out all of those Trump signs in yards and all of the Trump flags I see everywhere AND it must be the Russians organizing all of the Trump flotillas everywhere AND that would explain why I have seen 0 Biden anything anywhere!! THE RUSSIANS!!!!
did you hear him trashing Trump and bragging on Biden??üò°
This has already gone viral. We just need to keep retweeting and retweeting it. Damn what a ad.
üó£Ô∏èHILLARY CLINTON, LORETTA LYNCH, UNDER OBAMA, ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR 4 AMERICAN DEATHS IN BENGHAZI!! WHERE IS HUNTER BIDEN HIDING?üò± IS HE IN THE BASEMENT WITH JOE??ü§î
I‚Äôll note down that you‚Äôre in favor of rule by executive decree in case it comes up during the Biden Administration. Or is that only when Trump does it?
IF WE LET TRUMP SAY AND DO THE THINGS THAT HE DOES AND SAY ABOUT BLACK PEOPLE AND GET AWAY WITH IT!!!! THEN WHY IN THE HELLLLLLLLLLLLWHEN VP BIDEN SAY ONE THING THAT SOUND OFF THE TRACK SOME TROUBLE MAKERS WANTS TO LYNCH HIM!!! YES WE HAVE LET TRUMP DESTROY AMERICA AND IT'S VALUE
Joe Biden said some woozy ass racist shit
Fair. It is quite entertaining. In a sad way. Like Biden.
Desperate: Biden grasps for Gretchen Whitmer as potential running mate
Lester the molester...oh I‚Äôm sorry...that‚Äôs Biden!!! I am shocked and amazed!!! NOT!!!

Well depends who wins. We know if Biden wins it won‚Äôt be covered and it‚Äôll be like it went away. If Trump wins it‚Äôll still be here end be the deadly pandemic the world has ever seen. I have no excuses, what would I be making an excuse about?
Biden‚Äôs criteria for his VP pic was what?  a. Black, b. Female, c. Nothing else. Not even the most qualified ‚Äúperson‚Äù in the country, only Black and Female that‚Äôs called making the VP position a quota filled position without consideration for other qualifications.

I wonder if Harris went to bed with Biden to get ahead like she did with  Willie Brown?
For 1 thing  didn‚Äôt get rich off the  lije  n his fatcat wife Elaine Chao Biden released 20 years of tax returns n financial records something trump is fighting in court to stop after the Supreme Court gave SDNY the go ahead to get his taxes he filed

I know this was an attempt at humor, but Bob Dole was a hero.  He fought for his country and was wounded.  I respected him.  As for Biden, I have more respect for Jeb.
Joe Biden endorsed this message.  then he forgot he did so.
No.  Absolutely not. Not one of those soldier's lives is worth risking on this engineered crisis. Let Portland burn. Let people see what voting for communists does. Let them understand in Cleveland and elsewhere that this is coming for them. All they have to do is vote Biden in.
Vote for Biden like our lives depend on it, because they do.
Statement by Vice President Joe Biden on President Trump‚Äôs Executive Orders to Sow More Chaos and‚Ä¶ by
Biden ain‚Äôt gonna do shit to help Americans. I don‚Äôt need an abortion or my student loans paid by my fellow Americans. So what is all of a sudden is he gonna do for Americans? He has yet to tell us.
Put a statue up and see if it stands as if I understood BLM dont want people or times to be known of anyone who supports black people. So Trump spoke the truth. Biden didnt know John Lewis either im sure.
Hillary, Biden and Obama can build it for them.
Biden during his ENTIRE political career has been against blacks.  Do some research, see the statements he‚Äôs made his entire life.
I just RSVP‚Äôd for Jill Biden‚Äôs keynote speech at Gun Sense University. Join me and thousands of my friends from  this Sunday at 3:45pm ET!  #GSU2020

And for the record, there are legitimate concerns about Biden. It‚Äôs just that Hillyer can‚Äôt write judiciously it seems about any Democrat. He‚Äôs there to hack away. The difference between Hillyer writing about any Democrat and Trump talking isn‚Äôt much. Neither know limits.
So this silly screed about Biden isn‚Äôt any surprise. It‚Äôs full of holes but there‚Äôs stuff there that the Limbaughfied GOP will love. Hillyer wouldn‚Äôt get away with much of what he‚Äôs written if those Trumper types hadn‚Äôt been built over the decades.
I knew a ‚ÄòNever Trumper‚Äô from Alabama would be back at what he did for decades. Hillyer‚Äôs hustle attacking Democrats using strawmen, overwrought language ... is useful. It‚Äôs a preview of what a Biden presidency will receive from ‚Äòconservative‚Äô outlets.

Joe Biden might say he is a devout catholic but his words and actions say otherwise!
You are correct about his aneurysm but he speaks and has written about stuttering since early childhood.  I am working hard not to be pissed off at people about this. I'm officially declaring today my last day of patience with this.
That is a sticking point with me, but I find Trump to be as close to an anti-Christ figure in 2020 as I can think of for a multitude of reasons that I'm going to give Joe Biden the win. Trump is pro-life only as far as courting anti-abortion voters. ProLife is much more than that
Yeah, because Obama stumping for Biden at a fucking funeral shows class right?President Biden
I'm voting for BIDEN/HARRIS !!!
We can believe ever breathe that Captain Mark Kelly takes!  Vote for HIM !  Whoever you are and wherever you are!.  Also, vote for Biden/Harris if you want a safe and sane United States !
Utter lawlessness in DEMOCRAT controlled city.  Vote Biden/Harris &amp; this shit (anarchy) becomes the new normal. No doubt in my mind when Trump wins in Nov, he will do whatever's required to finally restore law &amp; order by whatever means necessary. We've waited long enough.
BIDEN/HARRIS !  IS MY CHOICE, I CAN HARDLY WAIT TO VOTE !!

So when Joe Biden mangled ‚ÄúKamala‚Äù in his speech today, while reading from the teleprompter, guess that was ‚Äúdisrespect‚Äù tooüòè #LiberalHogwash #KAG2020
Everyone of you liberals have to cuss on some point of your tweet. Does that help get your point across? Oh and your an ass hat.  Prove that Obama and Biden did anything positive for our military or for our country for that matter.
I've a deep blue acquaintance who said years ago emphatically  emphasizing his political persuasion, "I'd vote for Mickey Mouse if he were a Democrat!" He told me after Biden's VP pick, that he's voting Trump. But he said Gretchen, Newsom &amp; weeks of Portland, sealed his decision.
how can Kamala Harris simultaneously call Joe Biden a racist, and a rapist, the two worst names you can be as a white man, then run as his VP üòÇ the democrats are such a joke ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
And that‚Äôs your view. My whole point is about not voter shaming people. I disagree with you, but I‚Äôm not like if you vote for Biden then you‚Äôre voting for all the wars hes perpetuated, the racist systems he‚Äôs fought to uphold, and etc.
Dems say that EVERY YEAR. ‚ÄúIf this were a regular election‚Äù. I‚Äôm not debating you on if Trump is a fascist. He is, but it is counterproductive to tell people ‚Äúif you don‚Äôt vote for Biden, you‚Äôre voting for Trump and everything he does‚Äù. And lmk when Alabama turns blue lmao.
&amp; likely future president...what are the odds Biden makes it to '24?
Those peoples‚Äô votes aren‚Äôt going to matter anyways. What‚Äôs the point in voter shaming someone who lives in a safe republican state that Trump won by 20+ points? There‚Äôs absolutely no point. It‚Äôs a waste of breath. If it‚Äôs a swing state, sure vote for Biden. But that‚Äôs not
Something that really gets me is the extreme views from both sides regarding what could happen if one candidate gets elected over the other. The country is not going to end if Trump gets reelected and neither will it end if Biden becomes president. It will just look different.
Not voting bc you dont like the option of biden or kamala is equivalent to voting for trump!   Those are our options, go vote.
I dont think so. I think there are enough republicans who are dis associating themselves from Trump and voting Biden as a one time deal. They wont ever be Democrats. They will be what keeps the party in check or the split will cause a new party. We are due for that historically.
Exactly! Sure I don't believe everything that Biden says or will do but I believe he has the character we need in this country right now.
Now we can stop asking who will Biden pick and get on with the race. Less than 100 days to go.

Wow doesn't he know that's what the primary season is all about, a healthy vigorous debate on the issues. It actually says a lot that Biden moved past that and picked her.

Even the less educated black person knows that the black vote MUST go to Biden/Harris. In the South where "Southern Political Segregation" dominates....white Republican Legislators often pass laws to suppress the goals of majority black cities.  Democrats support black cities.
Every derogatory statement kamala made about biden will now be chalked up to ‚Äúit was a debate‚Äù and the media will let her get away with it.  Disappointing, but not surprising in the least.
If Biden should elected he will be shown to be unfit to serve within the month. Ms. Harris will be president. That‚Äôs the plan.

It would be nice to see Hillary Clinton serve in Joe Biden's administration if he is elected on November 3. Democrats, again, it's up to us. If we show up in large numbers, we win. It is extremely important that we  show up in large numbers. ALL Democrats need to  vote on Nov. 3.
regretfully, the two party system and electoral college denies the freedom to vote for a more varying array of candidates. we vote the biden in, unless we want the trump again.
Would someone tell me why this is true? Joe Biden was a Senator most of his life and knows what the government is supposed to do and how it can work effectively - not where a party closes it in a crisis and goes on vacation.

Exactly.üòÜ I made the post in response to this Politico article:  ‚ÄòThe President Was Not Encouraging‚Äô: What Obama Really Thought About Biden
Did Biden tell you that? He tends to exaggerate(lie) about where he graduated. Trump graduated from Wharton which has the  #1 ranked MBA in the US. So I'll pass on the TDS infected liberal's opinion on his intelligence.
Simply put, the Obama admin coddled the world‚Äôs leading state sponsor of terrorism, and the Trump admin blew them to pieces and ushered in a peace agreement between neighboring states in the region.   Hard to chalk it up to anything else, but Biden and the media will find a way.
Of course Hillary was a shark of a politician‚Äîfully willing to take down anyone to be president‚Äîbut I hope she watches as Biden actually crosses the finish line, too. Like, why would she or Obama look down their noses at a man who‚Äôs almost universally liked? It‚Äôs straight elitism
If even a sliver of this is true, it actually makes me resent Obama. His elitism needs to stay far away from his public image, b/c frankly it makes him look like a technocratic asshole. I honestly hope Biden sails to victory by historic margins‚Äî&amp; I hope Obama watches it happen.

I didn't say Biden was a saint or even that he was a good candidate. I didn't even mention his name. What I'm saying is that Trump trying to claim that his opponent is racist is a stupid argument bc he is clearly racist himself. Not a zero sum. They can BOTH suck, which they do.
Saw your spot on MSNBC. We need every Dem senator and representative in Washington speaking out...Biden/Harris need your support as well as the Resistance....We must all unite to take our country back from the fascist wannabe dictator.
The difference is that I don‚Äôt agree w that what he thinks it should be. Like I said, simply put,  I think Biden is the better person but he is usually misguided in what is best for the country.  I think Trump is genuinely a bad person but he is more inline w policies.
Oh, absolutely not. I‚Äôm a ‚Äúboth sides are terrible‚Äù kind of person. Nothing annoys me more than people who only see wrongs of one party. Biden had an agenda.  However, in Biden‚Äôs case I think his agenda is more an attempt to make the country what he thinks it should be.&gt;

I feel like the left would rather be right than actually get closer to the goals they set to achieve. Angela Davis is voting Biden/Harris. That spoke volumes. He is not my ideal choice, but I believe his administration would be more open to hearing and complying to our demands
It's really a no brainer, but I feel like the left sometimes would rather be right than actually get closer to the goals they set to achieve. Angela Davis is voting Biden/Harris and helped make my decision.
Can we do that right after Biden tells him he's fired?
So we can infer that expediency might have been behind her Kavanough slanders like it was her Biden Slanders?
Has anyone else noticed that the GOP has no plan on any isuess, no platform so they are just makimgbup scary things that Biden and Harris will do if elected? Losers. This includes you
Biden is such a idiot. We are not China you Alzheimer nut-job.
When Biden wins in November and gives his speech after the votes are counted I really really really want him to look straight into the camera and say, "Donald Trump, you're fired."

Yeah, Biden got it wrong today.
There's not a person in the white house that would try to correct Donald Trump in his blundering about history &amp; different years &amp; what happened during those years but he's got nerve to talk about Joe Biden being slow Trump can't pronounce English words that are used everyday.
I mean I‚Äôm clearly going to vote for Biden and Harris. I‚Äôm not going to like it. I‚Äôm not voting for THEM I‚Äôm voting to get that buffoon out of office.
I was wondering if CNN or MSNBC would cut away for trump. He purposively planned his media joke to take time away from Biden/Harris, but it didn't work. I mean, what did he say anyway besides, lie, blame, insult, and take credit for Obama's work.
Obviously Biden pronouncing her name ‚ÄúCamel-uh‚Äù is to get back at her for calling him a racist who she believes sexually harassed women.
Would you care to put your $ where your mouth is? We can each put $10k in escrow and whoever's candidate wins gets the $20k minus the escrow fees. I've already got piles bet on Biden +120, but I'll definitely take more action at evens. Let me know.
The beginning emphasis on Biden's filial love in Harris speech was a brilliant move. We as a nation are hungry for precisely that during COVID crisis. But it also serves as a stark contrast to Trump &amp; his family. What else do we expect from the son of a whoremongerer?
The only way I would not vote for Biden Is if he took Drumpf as his VP. I am glad he picked someone far more qualified. #BidenHarris #BidenHarris2020Landslide
Remember the Pandemic Response Team that Trump disbanded. That was Obama and Biden. If only Trump and GOP listened to the WHO, CDC, Dr. Fauci, Dr. Birx. Trump is the President not Biden (not yet anyway). Trump was given the tools to combat Covid but he refused them all of it.
Pence: ‚ÄúYou locked up thousands of black people for non-violent crimes such as weed possession. Also, do you still believe Biden sexually harassed those women and is he still a racist?‚Äù  Drops mic and walks of stage.
Also, that‚Äôs a lie. She did not say ‚Äúfar worse things‚Äù about Biden.

Funny, That‚Äôs not what you said about Biden in the debates.
I love justice roberts! I'll applaud that choice ; )  I do wonder what you think disqualifies Biden. With regards to strict constructionists like Scalia, my experience is that they only apply that philosophy when it aligns with their right-wing agenda.
I think it's bcuz she doesn't associate with blacks... She said she Indian and Jamaican... Then after literally almost killing Biden's campaign and they beef... She ends up joining him... It's like she playing both sides .. It don't matter who wins as long as she in

See what he did there??   (There will NEVER be a Biden/Trump debate, btw)
Obama and Biden embrace equality and kindness for all; Trump hates everyone but himself; especially hates women.This statement is supported by Trump's record of continued abuse and denigration of women.  Trump needs to reconsider that hate, how the hell does he think he got here?
This is an absolutely blessed morning. Having blocked out the annoying Trump people and right wing propagandists, it has been going absolutely fantastic. The Biden/Harris celebration üçæ continues.
üëç on  Trump says he was surprised Biden picked Kamala Harris as running mate
Roy S Johnson: Hearing that Joe Biden chose Kamala Harris... I thought about so many bold, bad-a Black women in #Alabama who are leading, organizing, and galvanizing our political landscape.
All Joe Biden‚Äôs choice did was make this war between black men and black women worse!
Great VP choice Biden couldn‚Äôt do any better
I look at the overall picture. Democrats have a strong record in protecting and preserving the two laws that are most important for me and mine throughout history. Biden/Harris 2020
is the leader we need in this nation at this time in history. The opposition will call names, whine and complain. The reality is, we need adults and responsible people to fix this broken nation. Biden/Harris will begin that process. I have never felt so energized!
Exactly! That‚Äôs why this clown is in office now. We have to rely on some of those Republicans (who are sick of Trump) to vote for Biden for him to win smh!
Find out what The Breakfast Club thinks about Biden picking Senator Harris as his running mate! -
the DNC wants us all to go back to the Obama administration. back when they ended racism and nobody payed as much attention to politics. that‚Äôs what Joe Biden and Kamala Harris represent; it‚Äôs Obama‚Äôs VP and another black, and that‚Äôs all they are.
The only thing Republicans have is ‚Äúradical left‚Äù and tired name calling. They can‚Äôt call out Biden or Harris on issues with all the damage Trump has done.
Also, hell of an admission that Biden won't be able to handle "bad crap".
Joe Biden think he slick but most people already know wassup with her
Also, just FTR, I did not vote for the President the last time, and I certainly won‚Äôt this time around. But I will not be voting for the Biden/Harris ticket.
MJ or Lebron is stoking racial division? Biden said all black people are the same just last week. Why isn‚Äôt CNN reporting that.
The TLDR is this: I think all things being equal (i.e. mental fitness), a Harris presidency would yield more ‚Äúprogressive‚Äù outcomes than a Biden one. That‚Äôs likely more scary to me than you, but that‚Äôs where I‚Äôm coming from. (End, I guess)
This again also assumes Biden is ‚Äúall there.‚Äù Our current president is clearly unstable, but there are real concerns about Biden‚Äôs mental acuity. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs just a right-wing talking point. Biden may be subject to whomever he surrounds himself with at this point. (10)
I have a hard time seeing Biden pushing through a true Medicare for all or single payer system, but I can see Kamala doing the same. (9)
Finally, there are the reasons I think she‚Äôd be worse than Biden. Both have a horrible record on CJ so that‚Äôs a wash. But when it comes to matters of other domestic policy, I do feel Harris is more of ‚Äúthis progressive moment.‚Äù I‚Äôm going off what I saw on the trail and the past.8
She speaks so well of Biden üòÇüòÇüòÇ. She called him a segregationist
Good luck with our country moving toward socialism. I am with your father, and hope he gets well. Also, wishing you well but hope you will research policies of Biden. The platform of the left is not moderate and will be the destruction of our country.
President Barack Obama said presidential candidate Joe Biden nailed the decision to select Kamala Harris as his running mate, and other Democrats have also praised her selection.
Again, I know why I'm voting for Biden/Harris. I'm excited. I must move on to share that excitement with other people I know. Good-bye.
We are All Sick to death of Trump savage attacks on anyone one who does not worship at the altar of the choosen one. Rejoice.  Biden and Kamala  Civility Dignity Honesty
i really don‚Äôt like Joe Biden, i don‚Äôt like Kamala Harris, i hate the 2 party system. i‚Äôm not even a democrat but i had a dream last night that Tr*mp got re-elected so i know what i‚Äôm going to have to do and again, i don‚Äôt like it.
üòÇ passion and strength! üòÇ Biden has been on the wrong side of every foreign policy decision ever. Now he doesn‚Äôt know what office he‚Äôs running for or what location he‚Äôs at. Rick is the biggest Grifter I‚Äôve ever seen.
Biden like clinton likes them on their knees in oval office
Honestly.. with the choices in this election, I wouldn‚Äôt blame anyone for not voting this time. I said what I said.. Trump is worse but.. Biden and Kamala are pure trash..
Dems, this election is too important to waste our time responding to attacks by bots, Trump people, and other Republican supporters.  Block them out!! Spend that time urging other Democratic supporters to rush to the polls on Nov. 3 and vote for Biden/Harris and other Democrats.
hey for those of you critiquing biden for picking a VP ‚Äújust because‚Äù she‚Äôs a woman of color, you should REALLY be more concerned that throughout history our leaders have been overwhelmingly white males ‚Äújust because‚Äù
She's being used by Biden to pander to minorities and women. Smart people would see right through this and realized the Dems that have been promising he same crap for 50 yrs hasn't delivered.
I am in no way a politician or really even into politics, but DT gone win again because y‚Äôall don‚Äôt wanna vote for Joe Biden üò©
How Biden chose Harris: Inside his search for a running mate
Why not Joe Biden?
This is the main reason I would not be able to vote to Biden/Harris (there are a lot others, but this is the main)
She did not accuse Biden of being a segregationist. She challenged one aspect of his boast about being able to work with people he disagreed with.
Op-Ed: Kama Harris and the Growing Political Power on Black Women: In #Alabama, Black women and the Black Voters Matter Fund played pivotal roles in the election of Doug Jones to the Senate in 2017.
Are the suburbans happy you kept minorities out of the neighborhood?  Probably if we're being honest...   Will it be enough to keep them from voting for Biden for social clout and to keep up with the Joneses? Probably not
You sure he didn't? How many people you think died because of the 1994 Crime Bill? Perhaps, you're just unwilling to face the truth that both Biden &amp; Trump are soulless sociopaths.
Can we put self-serving cancel culture on the back burner for ONCE? If we do not get Donald Trump out of office now, we may not have another election.   This isn‚Äôt about the needs/wants of few, this is about the needs/wants of many. Joe Biden is the most qualified candidate.
This suburban mom is 100% with Biden/Harris.
Biden is being controlled by the Squad and other far left Democrats.
And we are surprised that right wing media is attacking Joe Biden‚Äôs VP pick?
I repeat. Just block the idiotic bots, racists, conservatives, and Trump people. It's easy and convenient. Then continue this momentus celebration üçæ  of....Biden/Harris 2020. It's a wonderful feeling. I love it!! üíò
For some reason, the DNC researchers determined that three factors motivated their voter base:  1) Mental deficiency  2) Pedophillia  3) Kwowing what Willie Brown tastes like  Joe Biden‚Äôs got the first two covered and Kamala can write Yelp reviews on number 3.
Wow!! I feel absolutely wonderful this morning. I thank God for this unspeakable joy. Biden/Harris 2020.
These idiotic bots and Trump people are trying to crush our celebration üçæ of our impressive Biden/Harris Democratic ticket. Just block their misery and annoyance. Keep celebrating and spreading the joy. Biden/Harris 2020.
Yet, Biden voters are not labeled as ‚Äúcoon‚Äù lol I honestly want to know what the non-voters are doing for the country.
I am 100% supporting  the BIDEN-HARRIS  ticket! 100%!!!
I woke up this morning and saw these bots and Trump people tweets all over my phone/computer. It's ridiculous!! I immediately started blocking the morons. Dems, don't argue with them. They're not worth it. We don't need anything to impede our joy and celebration of Biden/Harris.
Precisely this.  is delusional. Nearly EVERY minority is excited for Biden Harris ticket. But more importantly, minorities are desperate to get rid of  Watch the blue wave.
Trump‚Äôs pandemic is his biggest failure as president. And he doesn‚Äôt care. Biden and Harris should start speaking out every day about the pandemic specifically. Make Trump own his failure completely.
Honey you legit cannot call anyone racist...pack your bags Donny boy! If Covid doesn‚Äôt get ya Biden/Harris WILL. Thank u, next.
I‚Äôm not voting for Joe Biden ever
Damnit Joe Biden damnit
Having said that I'm going to mute "Harris" and "Biden" before I set my mail in ballot on fire :)
Pam what's your angle? Why are you attacking Biden?
Medhi I hear what you're saying but until November 3rd it will be helpful is rose Twitter stops bashing Biden and helps us get rid of Trump and win the Senate. Biden isn't going to veto his own party and we can pull harder to the left with him than we can with Trump.
We need to celebrate üçæ Kamala Harris becoming Joe Biden's running mate &amp; next Vice President
That‚Äôs a convenient perspective to ignore Biden‚Äôs cop VP recently saying he‚Äôs a racist whose guilty of sexually harassing women.   I suppose people truly will talk themselves into believing anything that allows them to continue supporting their ‚Äúteam.‚Äù
I heard ‚ÄúAngela Davis is voting for Biden. What do you know that she doesn‚Äôt?‚Äù üôåüèª
Joe Biden is the Presidential candidate
I was all Biden/Harris 2020!!! But then they said she was a phony, and a meanie, so now I just don't know who I should vote for.  I don't like meanies.
Burning down all the corporations isn't on the ticket this year. And if we try and force it on there then we will lose and they will get stronger and harder to beat next time. Obama/Biden admin signed Dodd Frank. Trump repealed it.
Maybe the people who are still whining about Kamala Harris's statements about Joe Biden in debates are still stuck thinking a woman criticizing them is unforgivable.
How Biden selected Kamala Harris as his running mate
The right is getting what its way because they won. If Trump had said he was going to do all he's done, he wouldn't have won. Politics is hard. Biden wants to expand healthcare. Trump doesn't. That's not hard. M4A is one way. Its not the only way. You pick 1 guy. Not an ideal.
I didn't know you were a political philosopher. There is a reality where the next president will either be Trump or Biden &amp; if people don't work to elect Biden then there will be less progress. RBG isn't going to live forever. You want 6-3 far right scotus decisions for life?
Now y‚Äôall who follow my post know how much I love to troll the Republican Party but this time to be fair the Democratic Party Ôøºgotta get these jokes. Didn‚Äôt Kamala Harris Ôøºlast year say she believed Joe Biden sexually assaulted all those women and there stories should be told.
I don't get the rhetoric that Kamala Harris was the only choice for AG. She turned down being Obama's AG. The notion that she is the only one who can be Biden's AG is ridiculous.
