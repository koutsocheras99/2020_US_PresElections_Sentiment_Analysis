Captured to a tee. Trump, a wannabe tough guy, who was neutered psychically by his father, longs for acceptance from substitute father strong men.
Turdley. Old enough to remember his testifying for Trump during the Impeachment.
They had no masks, trump signs, and even the god damn confederate flag 🤢🤮
Of all the hills that Trump wants you to die on - you chose this one? Lots of hills, Adam.
Trump sick
Like the peaceful transfer to Trump!
Pity for old man Trump He’s getting from everywhere and now GOP Governor of FL  In Break With Trump, DeSantis Says Florida Ready for Election - Bloomberg
I hear you, I just see a lot of people praising Obama when they shouldn't and I fear that it could lead to people not holding anyone who isn't Trump accountable in the future. Mad I have to vote Biden, but I will vote for him nevertheless
“Given the wild pace of events, McCabe couldn't be sure how long he'd last as director, so he wanted to lock down as much evidence as possible.”
I think it is important to remind people that while Trump is the worst, we shouldn't paint others as heroes when they aren't
I have health issues too and I also loves me some tees. My favorite? "Fu$k Donald Trump and Fu$k you for voting for him!" I'm considering a somewhat cleaner message for a lawn sign. Keep on keeping on Stevie Jo! Liz in CT is with YOU! VOTE, VOTE, VOTE!!!
Trump is already interfering with our elections  🌈🇵🇷🇺🇸🇨🇦
Trump doesn't joke #trumprecession
Biden is creepy. But I'd vote for mickey mouse at this point. Anyone but trump.
Good pt: bc Trump* is incapable of doing his job, his chaos is replacement artifact. Also, he’s evil.
Herman Cain gave his life to #Trump - dies of -#COVID19 after Tulsa no mask rally.  Now you can join Herman too, leave masks home, go to a bar,  large crowds - or if you’re in a hurry, attend a Trump rally
Trump doesn't give a shit if anyone dies  - we are all disposable pawns
Inconceivable that apparently functioning people could get caught up in this ridiculous nonsense. Really?? Trump is sending secret signals? He's the Prez, what's taking him so long? Really people, put on your thinking caps and re-enter reality!
I feel sorry for his family ,but l don’t feel sorry for him he won’t to the Tulsa  trump campaign rally talked about not believing the coronavirus no protection and it got him rip
You must be blind or something because clearly China sent the virus over and if Obama Biden has the stock pile full we wouldn’t have been in this mess also George Floyd has nothing to do with trump also blm is a horrible bunch of terroist
You just talk stupid black lives matter destroyed us and China if it wasn’t for black lives matter and China everything will be golden trump is the best president of my life time and that is a fact ... China created the virus and blm created these fires that are burning
. knows his Trump*.
Add Herman Cain dead of COVID19  does that GOP thesis that its liek the flu still hold true?  #Trump is so fucked
Sine Trump said “she’s  so smart “  maybe she can explain why this virus is killing so many black Americans 🌈👊🏻
What an idiot  Trump suggesting to delay elections - I think there 50/50 chance he bails out in next 30 days
#Trump wants nothing to do with hard work  What is he facing?  -huge debt  -Faltering economy / unemployment   -Out of control pandemic   -Stockmarket about to hit free fall  -Aliens
Hmm,and they are WOMEN how sexist of President Trump
Of course Trump is RIGHT how can a person CHEAT if SAID person has to show I D to cast their VOTE?? So please tell me why President TRUMP is AGAINST mail in VOTING if he's the cheater.Everyone must be for VOTER I. D.
US Army presence in Germany is to protect Europe and Asia in the event of military actions from Russia or other aggressive groups. You have. Pulling these troops out leaves Germany and other countries vulnerable to violence and wars.  tRump is a moron
So he will move to Trump Tower and charge us rent?
Vote for trump 2020
Not me and not the world Biden is shot his brain is gone he won’t be running anything they will have people behind him running this country we need one leader that’s trump
Trump did something for our country he created the most jobs of any other president he stood up to China when joes son hunter went missing because they stole money millions from other countries Biden had 1 million black kids killed when he was in office
Facts also he will never debate with trump
He cant even debate trump what does that tell you he is incompetent
Trump is perfect to lead if it wasn’t for democrats holding up this country and this president this country would be golden it sucks because the democrats are horrible people and I’m afraid most people who comments here is misinformed
We always need trump
Wrong wake up man come on do you see what these democrats are doing before COVID 19 trump had the best economy in history better then any president ever then COVID a fake virus is made up by the democrats they tried 5 times to impeach trump didn’t work Biden son where is he
Go ahead vote joe he will have every factory that trump brought here gone to China China will take over the world just like they did when Obama was in for 8 years everyone was on welfare they give hand outs o jobs created all the money in BIDENS pocket and Obama pocket
Yeah right you must be a welfare collector because everyone was broke for 8 years when Obama was in there were no factories there were no jobs your out of your mind trump created millions more jobs in his 3 years then Obama did in 8
Omg I pray every night that trump wins because if not we are fucked we are gonna be fucked if Biden gets in
You need to grow a brain dude it’s very clear that the democrats want power and they want to ruin this country mark my words if Biden gets in your gonna pray for trump to come back
Trump created more jobs then any other president and it’s not trump trump wants people back to work while the democrats want to keep work closed and schools closed because a China virus that trump saved millions of people of it was up to the Dems they were in New York dancing
Get the hell outta here trump saved America
DEAR  you have to stop banning and covering up for the democrats and stop removing videos about COVID 19 this is suppose to be a free speech place and you are trying to make trump lose the election so stop before trump bans this social media site all together
If I was trump I would ban twitter and you tube and Facebook these big tech companies clearly don’t want you to win
Texas man called #COVID19 a ‘hoax’ ( like #Trump did) until family gathering led to 14 infections, 1 death and his partner’s relatives rejecting his help
You said it right on T, when u put that hat on your life doesn’t matter. It’s despicable how hypocritical these people are. To the left nobody that supports Trump life matters. Only thing that matters is their bullshit sham agenda, got nothing to do with caring about black lives
If you support trump retweet this cause I’m trying to see something
I think their FBI flunkies that spied on the Trump campaign are more reminiscent of secret police don’t you?
To defeat Trump and the America he is trying to restore and preserve.
Trump, trump family &amp; trump companies all getting rich on our dime. He’s laughing all the way to the bank. He needs to be stopped!!
We need to lock Trump up 🌈👊🏻🇵🇷🇨🇦🇺🇸
This is impossible. The stable genius saved us from the viral apocalypse, employment is best ever! small businesses are thriving and we retired all national debt! Rock on #Trump !  Trump's Approval Rating Sinks to 17-Month Low as Election Looms Closer
Get your priorities straight.
And you wonder why tRump is allowed to get away with his shit. He’s surrounded by POS idiots. Maybe he got it by taking one for the team. Ha ha
If I didn't have my WHITE PRIVILEGE (LOL) and I was a black man supporting PRESIDENT TRUMP,I would be HIGHLY OFFENDED by their RACIST QUESTION!!!!!
We love you Mr. President TRUMP!! God bless you 💕💕
There is an invisible string that leads from Trump’s sagging jowls to Putin’s right hand. #PuppetPresident   *commander-in-chief, my ass
And GOOPers, where are they, where is their outrage, have any of them called out Trump*?
What Alex is perhaps missing is that Trump*s answer is the rebuttal that you would expect to hear Putin say in defense of Russia’s action. He is using the messaging of our adversary, and doing so in a most natural manner.
Trump and Kanye
150k fatalities seems way less than the millions you assured us we’d have... great job trump!
So every country in the world, is out to test socialism on America and get rid of trump specifically? Just America? 🤔 are you ok?
Exclusive: Trump never raised Russia's Taliban bounties with Putin
Trump
Trump 2016: I alone can fix it. Trump 2020: I take no responsibility.
You truly deserve Donald Trump..!
Good or bad? When will all mail ins be counted? If Trump has lead until final count, then loses, does it fit his rigged election narrative?
But this was before we learned from Trump* that you could mix it with alien sperm.
More Trump shit talking about Joe’s cognitive skills when he lies through his teeth every day he calls himself a genius he took a test of a third grader could pass should we look into ingesting disinfectant insulin I don’t know what should I be on it should I be taking it?Genius?
So Trump the guy who claims he isn’t concerned with polls is now crying the blues about #Fauci 🌈👊🏻🇨🇦🇵🇷🇺🇸
Absolutely...we are seeing it all play out right before our eyes. Trump’s win for the common man and woman has broken the left/dems and every day they are revealing how vile and unAmerican they really are.
Bio to be hammered further . Trump talking 50% cost out of retail Rx  in tonight’s presser.  Looks like he’s trying to go back to being a NY Liberal, gave up being a dumbass hillbilly. That’s probably why we’ve seen companies raising like $AUPH - they know what’s coming.
Dr. Trump walks out of #COVID19 Task Force Team , we’re fucked 🌈🇵🇷🇺🇸🇨🇦
OK now - teen girls on Tik-Tok dancing to rapper YG's "Fuck Donald Trump". There is a future!
Trumpism? I don’t get it  Pfizer CEO: Trump overhaul of drug pricing will cause 'enormous destruction'
This is the same drug y’all mocked Trump for, but because he isn’t the one saying it, praise on
...and its all because the left/dems hate America and Trump is blocking their destruction of our way of life...
But please Trump supporters, keep telling us how the Republicans aren't corrupt, want to help us, and that our president isn't just as dirty as they are.
Trump’s New COVID Doctor Says Sex with Demons Makes You Sick

Trump is done we must not let him off the hook 🌈🇵🇷🇺🇸🇨🇦
The left (I include dems in this term - they have become dangerous to our way of life) is throwing everything they have at Trump and at you who they abhor. November needs to be the biggest Republican landslide ever or we are seriously doomed.
FUCK TRUMP 🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🌈🇵🇷🇺🇸🇨🇦
This country is turning into a Tyranny w/ 1 Dictator. He is behind these non-military forces/thugs that harm US citizens. Someone should put tRump down now befote the election &amp; before the country Is lost. He’s arresting Resisters with felony charges so they won’t be able to vote
Do you mean the Trump Hoax Virus?
“One thing I can promise to you this, is that I will always tell you the truth”. ....Donald tRump.   What a F’ing POS , Liar, Cheat, Con Man, Xenophobic, Narcissist, Racist, Bigoted, Little Dick. MF’r.
I think Trump will win. Dems have over played their hand with these riots. It's backfiring on them. And I dont believe these polls because of cancel culture. Being a Trump supporter could mean losing your job, losing your friends and family, losing your reputation. Even your life
Because it hurts Trump. And that's also why Dems are turning a blind eye towards the riots. They think civil unrest on Trump's watch hurts him. Unfortunately for them, that gamble is backfiring big time!
Exactly soo ridiculous you the best presidente we ever have keep strong god blessed.trump 2020🙏
ATTENTION ALL PATRIOTS! I just accidentally ran into something awesome! RSBN has launched "Team Trump Online" It's like Donald Trump's YouTube channel!
Your Just like Hillary, get over it DONALD TRUMP IS AND STILL WILL BE OUR GREAT PRESIDENT. BYE,BYE
Trump respond to the press on Robert O’Brien , “I haven’t seen him , Trumps respond to the press on Epstein “I don’t know the guy , 😂😂😂😂😂🌈👊🏻🇨🇦🇺🇸🇵🇷
anyone voting for biden is purely because they dislike Trump. See what happens when you let hate lead your decision. You’ll surely regret it
And by the way I am very PATRIOTIC I FLY 3 FLAGS IN MY FRONT YARD 2 USA AND 1 TRUMP. GOD BLESS AMERICA
Knuckles and balls drag on the ground but I'm still able to put on a mask, and show MY voter I d to vote.And I know it is going to upset you,but the winner will be THE GREATEST PRESIDENT EVER DONALD TRUMP

Send your $500 to Trump Farmasuticals...
For 4 years we have had to listen to your bullshit.  You are happy to vote for someone seriousky impaired with Dementia?  4 more years of President Trump!
I think you ought to read what you said over again this time read it slowly or ask someone upstairs in the house their opinion,like I said who's the DOLT!!!And by the way a very PROUD TRUMP SUPPORTER good luck in November protester (RIOTER)burning my country down.
Good another Trump troll without a mask of course!
Really Trump. 149,000 deaths in this country from the Covid virus and you were thinking about something that happened in January. You need to get with the program. We’re in July now. What are you doing to stop the spread of the virus besides going to play golf
Who is the “they” that went on to target him? The Mueller (special counsel) probe was put in place by the Trump Department of Justice. Also, why did FBI announce 10 days before ‘16 election that it was restarting probe into Hillary Clinton (while saying nothing of Trump probe)?
The US is the only (I believe)country that is not allowed to negotiate drug prices the way the rest of the world does. It cannot negotiate medicare prices although the VA can &amp; does auto subs for its meds. My understanding. That's why I wondered what the hell trump was saying.
it’s time to get tRump out of office. Can you live with yourself over what’s happening in Portland and around country. You will make history for also becoming an absolute idiot
tRump should be arrested and impeached for what he has let Portland become. He is HITLER.
That’s worst then Sue 😂😂😂😂🌈👊🏻
First base 😂😂😂🌈👊🏻
I’ll spin one for you 🎼I get knock down but I get up again 🌈👊🏻

This is Trump's America.   These people are not black or brown, not terrorists, not poor immigrants, not foreign invaders. They are our sons and daughters, our wives and husbands, our brothers and sisters.  Americans protesting in the streets of Portland to protect your rights.

Trump saved us from Hillaryism by giving us Trumpism?
Trump is a weakened old dog and China knows it. Why do you think they’re moving on Hong  Kong now?  Doh
Ivanka Trump - Daddy’s little girl. Aren’t we lucky to have the princess?
This is a city issue, then a state issue, trump has asked if he could help with the feds coming in, he has been denied multiple times, Lightfoot is a massive problem and should be removed from office. Trump cannot do anything unless he is asked or given perm
Man women sheets 😂😂😂😂🌈👊🏻
You should  give that one to Trump for  his test 😂😂😂😂👊🏻🌈👊🏻
I'm not worried because,TRUMP LANDSLIDE 2020
But they are blaming TRUMP NOW For what the PEACEFUL PROTESTERS (WE CALL RIOTERS) are doing they are trying to turn it around to blame him because he sent in the FEDS To protect our tax payer interests.
Wow! That is an amazing clip! Looks like Trump's message is getting out regardless! I don't care what the polls say. I think Trump is going to win. ONWARD TO VICTORY!!
Show me proof of PRESIDENT TRUMP SPITTING AS YOU SAY ON THE CONSTITUTION. I'LL WAIT.
Hola Chuck 🌈👊🏻
As we head into the next phase of the Trump* Sh!tshow, know where your state is on evictions. Would they were all more like CT.
Perhaps he wasn’t there the day Trump berated a reporter for wearing a mask.   “Dr. Francis Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health, said it was ‘bizarre that we have turned ... mask-wearing into something political.’"

Why did rep Togo apologize for speaking the truth about AOC . She’s one of the reasons this country is going to hell . The squad has used foul language against Trump often and no one has called them out for it.
Dear president trump, I am a single mom, I work very hard, only giving 70% of my income is a death sentence. We cannot survive. The $600 has been a godsend. Please, I’m begging you, don’t take that away.
And if they don’t think they are playing into Trump*s hand…
You’re confusing me now. Trump* said Obama was born in Hawaii. 😳  Please clarify.
Nikki, shhhhhhh🤫. No one has heard from you since your resignation from the UN. Let’s keep it that way.  BTW, you didn’t care for Trump when you where at the UN, don’t start lying 🤥 now. #CountryOverParty
1). You know what’s sickening?? tRump said he’s not bringing military to Portland. Just very strong people. Will employ 75k more across country to get protesters out. WTF is really going on.  2). Have you ever seen this shit before. Take tRump DOWN Before nothings left of morals.
No, you mean thank you BEST PRESIDENT EVER TRUMP. LANDSLIDE 2020 THANKS TO YOU IDIOTS
You're so right abt trump's economic/foreign policy turn around.From Obama's low unemployment &amp; positive economic indicators to the worse economy since the great depression &amp; from Obama's worldwide leadership &amp; excellent working relations with all countries to laughingstock-maga!

Exactly. Plus the worse biden has ever done in his life is probably no way even close to what trump does daily. And pulling the hunter biden thread isn't wise when trump has his 3 stooges +1. Dems may not want to throw feces but plenty of never trumpers would gladly step up.
This dumb ass president think we stupid well some of ya are. he want to change his mind about Doing conventions and having large crowds for his little dumb ass speeches. we’re not stupid Trump you know you’re doing this for votes you don’t care about us! Shut up. you got 100 days
That’s absolutely not what he said. He said that about a state that didn’t pick Bernie and then picked trump. Not about black voters
Will some explain to me how a deep rooted liberal New Yorker like #Trump makes claim to the Confederate flag? Are MAGA that fucking stupid? The ultimate con artist has conned a shit load of shit kickers.
How does our country allow #Trump use DOJ to retaliate against Michael Cohen (or anyone for that matter) for writing a book critizing the President by being thrown back in jail?  What a fucking banana republic Trump built, that we now live in and it’s pitiful.

"This time will be different" is the fundamental fallacy of contemporary politics. It happens just enough (Trump 2016) to keep it relevant, but it really is just this:
“He has said his book would include examples of Trump making racist and anti-Semitic comments in private settings.”
Don’t throw anything or Trump will send in the shock troopers.
Outlier?
Trump* - he just settles into his stoopid talking points like he tucks into a bucket of KFC, doesn’t see the grease dripping all over his chin.  Doofus.
Rigged only if you don’t win. You’re gonna lose!! Joe Biden will send in the troops to remove you. Start packing Traitor Trump!
Said no rational person with an ounce of normal brain cells ever!!!  Bye bye Trump! They are coming for you.
I don’t support trump. Biden doesn’t care either, and Trump being evil doesn’t make Biden good
Traitor Trump!
They know but don't care. It's trumpian. What they don't get is that they aren't trump; they will have consequences while he gets to skate by, again.
I know something that exists already and it's much scarier. Trump's america.
You can't go to concerts because of Trump. #TrumpVirus
I get that. But it’s fair to question his morality if Trump aligns with his core values?  I think so

Trump saying that Obama wasn’t born in this country because he’s black.....
Biden says Trump is first racist U.S. president.  But is that because Trump used N-word routinely?   And does that make him  a) a racist?  b) an asshole? c) or all above?
Scaramucci: 'BIDEN IS ACTUALLY MORE OF A REPUBLICAN than President Trump'  via

Donald Trump is an embarrassment
So Trump claims the exerts are telling him what’s going on with #COVID19 statistics and research and he holding these press conferences to inform us , we want to here from the real experts “enough “🌈🇵🇷🇺🇸🇨🇦
TY for posting this. This is insane and I hope everyone sees it. Trump is killing us all with his special police force. He a POS
Bullshit.  #Trump is going to win by a landslide and then the Democratic Party will start a civil war.
LeBron, what policies does Biden have that makes you want him as President?  We know you don't like Trump but that's not a reason to think Biden would be a good President.
Trump just wished Ghislaine Maxwell “well”  I don’t know what to make of this

I have been at the beginning of multiple launches with companies that had experience with medical data and none went that smoothly. Considering that was for 1 location vs nationwide, this company is inexperienced &amp; trump admin hired them, i doubt it will go well.
Romney got a higher percentage of the vote than Trump
Trump built a great economy. As a female small business owner located in a poor city, for the first time people were working! Biden will not even take one question from a reporter!
But he read it in a presidential… oh FFS, it’s Trump.
It’s no big deal that #Trump is using the executive office to enrich himself. It’s what he does and now nobody gives a shit what he does. It’s good to be King.
Trump has been Q-P-Q his entire life.This is weird. I totally get changing ad/marketing messaging.  Been there.  But pulling current ads and not advertising a few days 90ish days before the election is nuts. Work 24/7 to get new ads done... don't go silent. (Not that I mind :) )
There's no excuse for anyone to be shocked by this. Many of us saw it coming 4 years ago.  Trump floats idea of delaying election, congressional Republicans reject idea

He inherited all his money and literally has lived on tax breaks for real estate developers and has skirted tax laws constantly. He's literally famous for dodging taxes which robs us of our tax dollars.
how is this supposed to be funny? she has a degree from BU and was elected to government by American voters, and was just making a joke on Twitter. maybe ask why Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner are in the White House, or half of Trump's cabinet and ambassadors. extreme reach here

Problem is Trump haters
I'm not sure the US government ever did care. Correct me if I'm wrong, but didn't Bill C. install Thaci? They knew what he's about. Also, Madeleine A. and Wesley C. Investments? I think Trump wants to leave which might be why he supported the KSF.

I still can't believe anyone at all on this planet would vote for Trump after his COVID19 (non-existent) handling.

Even the guy who has wet dreams of the money he can make from trumpmmaynhave has enough. More likely, he knows that the election is being interfered with and is hoping trump can still win.
trump must be convinced he is going to lose...why else would he say the elections are corrupted ?? ... he certainly wouldn’t say that the elections are corrupted if he was sure he was going to win !!

Elections are not delayed in America, that is how dictatorships work. Instead of working to make vote by mail work better (it already works) Trump is trying to undermine the USPS. The current Postmaster General who gave the Trump campaign $1.2 million is working hard on that.

I think trump has mistaken woke for joke
The demoncrats love the social unrest they caused it, and they love saying this is what trump did, vote for us in November and we'll all be having smores by the campfire in December

I’m not the religious person I used to be, but when Donald Trump is voted out this year, Biden’s inaugural song should be “Oh Happy Day.”

You are right Trump has done what last three Presidents did not do. Let's start with by not trusting American intelligence on Russian bounties. By not believing science on the current crisis. By pardoning his friends over personal interest. Let's be clear, Trump has more damaged.

President Trump notes Dr. Fauci has a very good approval rating while working for his administration:  It's curious, he's got this high approval rating, with respect to the virus—so why doesn't the administration, and myself, because of what we've done to combat this virus?!
What’s really #sad is that Trump is genuinely perplexed as to why Dr Fauci is highly thought of (Dr Birx’s credibility is debatable) and not him. Just started reading Mary Trump’s book - quite insightful. If he wasn’t POTUS and screwing up EVERYTHING, I’d feel bad for him.

You are trying to bankrupt people who need urgent help.  No one believes your BS anymore.  You had MONTHS to put together a REAL stimulus package and failed. This is all on YOU!  But sure let's throw in a new FBI building to help Trump with his hotel troubles #Hypocrisy
Trump would like to kill off democracy in favor of an autocracy because in the latter all the wealth &amp; power is concentrated in the person(s) at the top. During the years of the Soviet Union it wasn't that they were poor, all the wealth was centralized. Same with China.
I find this number to be suspect. Who was polled, Trump republicans? I wonder if they even understand the bill?

OH GOOD TRUMP WAS JUST JOKING ABOUT DELAYING ELECTIONS... BECAUSE THAT'S TOTALLY A THING THAT PRESIDENTS JOKE ABOUT
Thank you Ari.  Those of us with brains know all this to be true, but we must remember those who support Trump don't and will try anyway they can to steal the election.  We must educate everyone with your words!
RUSH: It's amazing how the Democrats continue to fall for this guy and -- after almost four years -- still have no idea how Trump does what he does and why he's doing it when he does it.
dumb, political shit. Trump tweets about election fraud and boom to the dems. Obama has 8 years to do it. shit we should have declared it a holiday a long ass time ago. See how politics works folks.
The date of federal elections is determined by Congress, and has already been set as Nov. 3. And the elections themselves are administered by the states. Trump has no power - literally, no power - to delay the election.
At least a little common sense, though we all know voting by mail has only a small chance of voter fraud unless of course Trump can figure out how to do it without getting caught.  I think that's the plan. Push away suspicion by claiming fraud will happen so you can commit fraud.
Everyone knows Trump has probably never Voted a Day in his life before 2016. #TrumpIsACrybaby
This is how it works — do everything in your power to subvert economic recovery, then complain and blame Trump when the subversion works even just a little bit. Hopefully voters understand how they are being mislead and vote accordingly.
Let’s do it for the old drunk, in addition to electing Trump, let’s get a GOP majority in Congress...landslides every where.
But, but its Trump, you know the most harrassed POTUS ever! The most Worked POTUS ever! He is too busy to be able to Campaign at this time, he is working hard on this CORONAVIRUS, thingy! We must give him a break, maybe hold off Election till 2024? 2030? #TrumpThreatensAmerica
Trump will just pardon him if he loses in November
Every MAGA parasite that has attached themselves to Trump - Charlie Kirk, Gorka, Diamond and Silk, Don Jr. Etc. are embarassments who need to be flushed as soon as he's out of office
10. A defeated GOP will almost certainly grow more extreme, as members who managed to survive an anti-Trump landslide will be from safe districts. If Trump wins, well, the party will take that to mean it’s all right to go full-fascist. Either way, soul-searching is unlikely.
6. For this reason, the Republican Party—even if a tidal wave crashes on Trump—is not going to snap out of it and mend its way. That’s a tale told by individuals wanting to believe cold-blooded partisans as not as cold-blooded as they thought.
3. Setting aside the problem of presuming Donald Trump is going to lose based on recent polling, and setting aside the problem of presuming the election is going to be fair, consider this: his aggregate approval across-the-board has been and remains about 40-43 percent.
Whenever trump says something like that it’s always a joke but it’s not you know what the joke is the ass licking republicans like John corny

Just a reminder that the goal here is almost surely not to move the election, which Trump can’t do, but to undermine public confidence in the election and its outcome.

Donald Trump should resign. Pass it on.
Hydroxychloroquine may in fact be effective against Covid even though discourse over the drug has turned into a media circus due to Trump’s early enthusiasm, according to Harvey A. Risch, PhD, Professor of Epidemiology, Yale School of Public Health.
His passing evokes so much added sorrow because it was so preventable so just so stupid. Going to the Tulsa Trump rally, unmasked, with no distancing, while having existing health conditions was absolute folly. I wasn't at all a fan, but I'm saddened at the  news of his death.
#RIPHermanCain Just because someone attended a Trump rally does not mean they deserve to die. I hope instead this serves as a wakeup call to his supporters. My best to Mr. Cain's family.
Trump floats November election delay - but he can't do that
I wrote a thread yesterday of the 🦇💩 crazy stuff Barr said at his hearing. At the top of the list is claiming there was no clear answer on whether POTUS can delay the election. Remember that these kinds of answers give Trump legal cover when he acts illegally. Barr must go.

In today’s “least surprising news ever”, Trump calls for delaying the election
This "opinion" by  does not age well🤪
To be more precise, I’m skeptical Trump would leave office without an election being held, an overwhelming electoral defeat, and massive street protests. Without any one of those, he may cling to power.
In this Tweet, Trump is attempting to plant in the minds of his supporters that they can abandon democracy for him.
From  "Autocracy: Rules for Survival".    Rule #1:  Believe the autocrat.
Pretty much the opposite of actual trends. Whitey, as you call him, is inspired by Trump to make one last pathetic grasp to maintain his social benefits as his generation withers and disappears.
Trump trying to delay the election is basically the free square in the 2020 bingo card.
I need some help from  and other law experts as to what this means. Didn't SCOTUS already OK the public charge policy?
But   will never print that Trump is racist. In fact, the text is one step removed from claiming Trump actually did something racist. They can’t ignore the tweet, so they have to temper it, while still acknowledging the message.

Times seem dark now, my fellow Americans, but the year could very well end with Trump being voted out of office and scientists completing a coronavirus vaccine. Just sayin’.
JUST IN:  President Trump is for the first time floating a “delay” to November’s presidential election, as he makes unsubstantiated allegations that increased mail-in voting will result in fraud.
Everyone paying attention saw this coming.
the hilarity (besides horror for democracy) is the sheer # of folks in #Trump administration—INCLUDING TRUMP HIMSELF—who voted by mail.  stay woke.
Trump loves to set records. Also, I believe red states have now surpassed blue states for COVID19 infections.
Trump floats delaying presidential elections without even catching a sleeper cell of foreign provocateurs? The man can’t do anything right.
He can have house arrest, for all I care. Just take away his Twitter privileges. That would be a punishment worse than death for Trump.

Whoa!  Is Trump finally over the line?
It’s my issue with him. I’m a Trump supporter.     Why shouldn’t we judge him on it?  It didn’t look good to do it before, and it was confirmed in hindsight.
Not just worth grappling with. Members of the media should talk through this publicly in coverage TODAY, reinforcing the simple point that trump doesn’t make the rules for elections. He has no power, and should be ignored. That is a nonpartisan truth.

Well fortunately we won’t have John Cornyn to kick around much longer.  Shameful to use this lame excuse to protect trump.  This guy deserves to lose
If President Trump was actually concerned about safe and fair voting, he'd urge the Senate to pass the Heroes Act, which would give states financial resources to best administer early and mail in voting.
Only Congress has the power to change Election Day and we have no plans to do that. For the President to even suggest this is an affront to our democratic principles of free and fair elections.

President Trump, can you really be this egotistical and myopic. You don't see what you have caused. Hopefully in November that will be your undoing.
The Dems are happy Herman Cain’s dead because it’s just one less black conservative they’ll have to spend time calling a sellout and an Uncle Tom. As if smearing Trump in the process wasn’t bad enough. BTW he had stage 4 liver cancer so I doubt his death was entirely due to Covid
Did he have any other underlying conditions that made him more susceptible to the virus? I don’t think being unmasked and at a trump rally was the only reason for contracting and dying of this virus. Poor statement! A mask is not 100% effective.
I’m proud to join my colleagues from both parties in unequivocally saying no to any delay in the November 3, 2020 general election.
Legally he has no shot...his term ends 1/20/21 at noon whether he delays it or not. Actually, only Congress can delay elections. Congress is ran by Democrats right now. Also, Trump is an idiot

Never mind what Trump wants.  GOP doesn't want to delay the election. What GOP wants is to have the election, and to steal it by cheating.  To date that is still the actual plan.  Russia still plans to help.  Allll the cheating, and allll the misery that complicates voting, is on

"Trump's June 20 rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma -- which saw at least eight Trump advance team staffers in attendance test positive for coronavirus. Cain had posted a photo of himself at the rally, seated closely among other attendees without a facial covering."
RIP Herman Cain, the only Cabinet level Black in the Administration,  CEO of Godfather's Pizza, was diagnosed with COVID-19 last month and admitted to an Atlanta-area hospital on July 1, 10 days after he attended President Trump's rally maskless in Tulsa, Okla. #MurderedByTrump
Trump floats delaying election over mail-in voting, legal experts say that power rests with Congress  via

The play here is not only the presidential race. State house chambers, and thus control of redistricting, is in play. If Biden/Dems can rout Trump/Rs in the big states, including TX-FL-AZ-NC-OH-GA, will have sweeping effects for the next decade and beyond. #EyesOnThePrize.

Biden would likely win what would be a close race if held today, but a lot will change in 3+ months - one can see it turning to Trump every day.
Donald Trump, POTUS, isn’t doing his job. He must clear out, and in some cases arrest, the Federal agents in Portland violating protester’s Constitutional rights. If he can’t do it, the People will do it for him. We will not be stopping until there is safety &amp; he’s out of office!
Whose money guarantees that you will never retract or apologize for an attack on a Democratic president/nominee? Scaife? Koch brothers? Trump could shoot you on Fifth Avenue in broad daylight, and you would say it was Joe Biden’s fault.

trump just suggested delaying the election because of mail-in voting "fraud"...while I can't be surprised, there are just no words for how much I despise this rancid blob
Trump wants to delay the election, so the electoral college can’t declare a winner with majority electorates.   Thus sending the election to the house and senate.  Per the constitution:  the house would elect president (Biden) and the senate would pick Vice President (Trump)

Ambition is the engine.  When fed by ego you get dangerous results (see Barr, Trump...) but when fueled by compassion and a desire to right wrongs you get gold (think Lewis, AOC).  It’s just more common for men to be driven by the former and women by the latter.

You guys suck at this. The only thing the public has learned from this hearing is how utterly unhinged democrats are and how stupid it would be to allow you to remain in power.  Trump has broken all of your facades of reasonableness.
Trump is not an economist. He is a failed business man. He has known ties to organized crime including organizations in Russia. He doesn’t want to show you his tax returns because they will reveal that he is both a criminal or a failure. All he has to do is show 2 prove otherwise
That sums it up. Barr acts like an interior minister in a dictatorship. He has no shame. They act like they know Russia and China will deliver them the re-election no matter how low trump’s poll results are. I have no other explanation for their blatantly outrageous behavior.

Elections are not delayed in America, that is how dictatorships work. Instead of working to make vote by mail work better (it already works) Trump is trying to undermine the USPS. The current Postmaster General who gave the Trump campaign $1.2 million is working hard on that.

Im ready! Sure hope you can stop the madness that is Trump. I also hope you aren’t a big Tweeter like he is. Trump wastes so much time on it, instead of idk..reading daily briefs!He tweets out venom &amp; conspiracy theories all day. Never seen anything like it. Hope I never do again
Yes! Trump for Gitmo 2021!

Very brave lady. I switched to independent a decade ago. 2 of my die hard republican family members have also switched recently. They say Trump &amp; his cronies have changed the very fabric of the party &amp; seemingly all the rules. Conspiracy, bullying,out &amp; out lying are now the norm
And trump supporters are VERY ignorant
You mean trump has a country to continue to ruin.
The only psychopaths are the ones in the White House right now. America will return sanity, reason, empathy, and science in november when trump goes bye bye.  As for god, well I'll let him speak for himself.
Anyone who listens to trump has nothing in their head!
I'm not angry but hydroxy...hasn't...worked! I'm a scientist working on Covid-19, hydroxy DOES NOT WORK,  &amp; his family are dangerous because you Tinfoil heads believe their lies &amp; that's the danger, look at your deaths rising, Trump is clueless!
Better have a word with your boss then Rubio...  Trump on China’s Xi: ‘We love each other’
Trump's "stumps" the GOP of the forest. We need to clear the stumps. I stand with my PRESIDENT. I shall not forsake him.
Go outside and shout n****r to every black person...you'll be arrested because not everything is freedom of speech...some things cannot be said...hydroxy is a conspiracy theory that MAGAT's believe because they're educated...&amp; Trump Jr needs to realise he's dangerous!
So why does the rest of the World agree that hydroxy doesn't work? We don't give a fuck about Trump, if it worked we would give it to our patients but we don't because it doesn't help...get your head out of your ass!
This is  America, no one else is in charge except Trump, it's his fault, his failure, am looking forward to November 3rd!
How are they being silenced?!? Google 'Hydroxychloroquine Peer Reviewed Studies'  &amp; read about the current science on the drug. If you still believe that all this is to bring Trump down &amp; the rest of the World is complicit then you MAGAT's have got psychological issues!
Why doesn't the rest of the World use it, the rest of the World doesn't have a problem with Trump so if it worked they would be treating their patients wouldn't they...JEEZ!
Yes. The world created a new virus just to cost Donald Trump the election. Sounds pretty insane right?
I hope so. It will be so nice to rebuild america into something better after trump, his enabling family and sycophant republigoons are swept aside
A description that fits Donald Trump to a "t".

Just because trump and pence say it because they choose to ignore the science doesn't mean the doctors on the team.said it. They have actively stated otherwise time and again
Funny. I googled dr Fauci and heat will kill the coronavirus and the only thing that turned up was trump saying it. Even dr. Birx said it was unknown.
Gun's over politicians are you ready to lose your NATION. NOT I SAYS ALL PATRIOT'S OF MY AMERICA 🇺🇸 TRUMP'S 🇺🇸 NATION
How awful am I in hoping that The Nuge's speech is carried live in prime time? Should be the nail in the Trump campaign coffin.
I let go of several cousins I grew up with. MAGAts to the core. I cannot abide racism, xenophobia, genocide, misogyny nor co-signing on Trump’s murderous ways.  I will not socialize with them.  I’ve tried to discuss things, but like typical MAGAts, the interrupt &amp; start shouting.

Not enraged Napoleon the Pig in a Trump hat, of course.
Obama and biden created a pandemic response team to deal with future pandemics. Trump disbanded it. H1n1 killed around 7000 people. Covid 19 killed 146000 and rising. Obama didnt downplay it. Trump did.
I can see how its confusing. You have dr. Fauci promoting real science and trump promoting things he makes up
Trump voters make up in enthusiasm what they lack in intelligence and morality.

Hey look it's a trump rally
Those people are called the trump administration
Light over dark is correct. It will be a glorious, bright, and happy day when fascist Donald Trump is removed from office
Trump was seen on video in florida passing a early voting polling place numerous times and did not vote. Nor did members of his administration have reason not 5o vote in person. If they cant hold the rnc for covid deniers they cant make people vote in person
I agree. Trump has been nothing but dishonest about the whole thing.
Terrence Williams is an honest &amp; loving man! He honest doesnt care about how insane he sounds as long as he keeps pushing the trump propaganda that republigoons use to destroy the country

Facebook has repeatedly refused to hold Donald Trump to any sort of standard on its platform. It's time for federal regulators to investigate #Facebook and act!
Obama? Absolutely. If you mean trump, only if you dont count the 44 others
He was a great actor. It's too bad he has lost his kind and sense of decency by saying Donald trump will keep america alive when Donald Trump is the one destroying it everyday
Morality is taught by parents and family. A good case of a lack of morality is Donald Trump and his criminal offspring.
It's  fault, never before have we had this chaos in our country, Trump has single-handidly destroyed America, November can't come quick enough to vote this dictator out!
I dont think it was Democrats that ordered illegal military intervention against states wishes. It's a little thing called the 10th amendment trump and the republigoons are violating
And I just muted and blocked the other two on the thread that's how I troll Trump's 🇺🇸 Nation my President 💙⚓🇺🇸🐾🐾🐕
Trump taught me how to troll 😂 I love my President 💙🇺🇸⚓🐾🐾🐕
Disturbing times...and a disturbing President...welcome to  world, America is burning &amp; where is Trump...GOLFING...JEEZ!!!
Are you blind Cruz...the federal court represents the government, the Stormtroopers represent  the anger shown is because of Trump &amp; his chaotic governance...the anger will be gone when Trump is voted out, he has to go!!!!
It was a democrat president that allowed trump to inherit a thriving u.s. economy and run it into the ground whole giving himself and fellow billionaires unneeded tax breaks
Trump has deployed federal troops to Democrat controlled cities only against states wishes. He has ordered them to attack and kidnap innocent civilians  navy veterans, moms, and children. Who is trying to hold on to power?
Trump has done nothing to try and slow the spread of covid 19 which led to the economic collapse. Trump has passed bill after bill stripping away civil rights. Trump is deliberately lying saying children are immune to covid 19. He refuses to acknowledge russian bounties.

Ummm. I don’t listen to his music &amp; personally think he’s a mentally I’ll egomaniac. Just because i have empathy for someone doesn’t mean Id vote for them. Mental illness isnt a joke. He’d be like the black version of Trump &amp; we’ve  dealt with enough insanity for the last 4 yrs

No I'm providing things trump supporters fear and deny: facts, reason, and science
None have the places trump is sending troops has requested ir invited them. The federal military cannot go there without it. If trump does this in places that have lower crime/murder rates then others, he is doing it against the law and for political reasons only
Oh yes...the GOP are complicit...  Perspective | Republicans are right; election fraud is real. They are perpetrating it. By David Litt
Trump objects. That's why he built a fence around Lafayette park while he hid in his bunker and had barr use military force to disperse them the next day for a photo op
Trump is unleashing military troops in democratic cities only, attacking and/or kidnapping peaceful protestors, navy veterans, pregnant women, senior citizens, and children. It's all documented on video
No he doesn't. Everything he does comes after something trump says and he echoes it verbatim like a parrot. That post is as much about those children as it is me. 0%
U insisted that I couldn’t supply a single example of Trump being racist. I respond by listing 5 from the top of my head. U dont deny his quotes. Instead u agree with all of them. 🤔 So I must conclude that u yourself are racist &amp; explains why u dont see his comments as offensive
We will not survive trump. And his  enablers must go too. #Biden2020🇺🇸 #VoteBlue💙 #ComplicitCorruptGOP  #FlipTheSenateBlue👊
Because we cannot allow trump to continue tearing this nation apart with his purposeful ignorance, narcissistic greed, divisiveness and lies. Joe Biden is a caring, experienced, intelligent, &amp; dedicated public servant. #ImVoting4BidenBecause And the #ComplicitCorruptGOP must go.
To review, Trump 'aced' a test of his 'mental acuity' but can't remember what the test is called? Do I have that right?
Trump: I cant issue a national mask mandate but can create an illegal police force in violation of 10th amendment. I can force children back to school without a plan bu threatening to cut federal funding.
Trump: have you seen the briefings? My ratings are fantastic. It's not about the people suffering. It's all about my ratings. That's why I had the hhs dept intercept the numbers from the cdc so I can manipulate the # in my favor
Trump: testing is overrated. Children dont spread the virus. I'm not responsible at all. I'm a stable genius. Trump turned it into trumps fault. We banned travel AFTER Tlthe virus was here. He still denies it's a problem.
The answer to how many masks he wore is: one. Once. Very recently. After 130,000 people died with him declaring the CDC and most qualified doctors were wrong. Trump is a monster who assigns cash value to every human life.
Oh please. Terrence cares about as much about those children as trump does about the 142000 coronavirus deaths: 0%. Its all about promoting trumps false narrative. If trump wanted a real difference, their are cities with higher crime/murder rates. This is about trump &amp; protests
Trump's 🇺🇸 Nation
Off the top of my head i got more than 1...Calling black lives matter “thugs” &amp; a “hate group”. Calling people from South America “a bunch of diseased murderers &amp; rapists”. People from Haiti Trump said “all have Aids”. He Demanded to see Obamas birth cert. Calls Covid “Kung flu”.
OK last one for the night.  I work in healthcare.  I've seen Trump's lack of response.  I've seen lack of supplies.  I've seen states bid against each other for PPE.  As well as the Fed trying to bid against states.  I've seen him not wear a mask, I've seen him distance himself

Trump would like to kill off democracy in favor of an autocracy because in the latter all the wealth &amp; power is concentrated in the person(s) at the top. During the years of the Soviet Union it wasn't that they were poor, all the wealth was centralized. Same with China.

Thank you Ari.  Those of us with brains know all this to be true, but we must remember those who support Trump don't and will try anyway they can to steal the election.  We must educate everyone with your words!

dumb, political shit. Trump tweets about election fraud and boom to the dems. Obama has 8 years to do it. shit we should have declared it a holiday a long ass time ago. See how politics works folks.
The date of federal elections is determined by Congress, and has already been set as Nov. 3. And the elections themselves are administered by the states. Trump has no power - literally, no power - to delay the election.
Trump dares to hold another presser after  Collins asked him about alien DNA being used in vaccines to end religion. Let's see if he takes questions today.
At least a little common sense, though we all know voting by mail has only a small chance of voter fraud unless of course Trump can figure out how to do it without getting caught.  I think that's the plan. Push away suspicion by claiming fraud will happen so you can commit fraud.
Everyone knows Trump has probably never Voted a Day in his life before 2016. #TrumpIsACrybaby
This is how it works — do everything in your power to subvert economic recovery, then complain and blame Trump when the subversion works even just a little bit. Hopefully voters understand how they are being mislead and vote accordingly.

Every MAGA parasite that has attached themselves to Trump - Charlie Kirk, Gorka, Diamond and Silk, Don Jr. Etc. are embarassments who need to be flushed as soon as he's out of office
10. A defeated GOP will almost certainly grow more extreme, as members who managed to survive an anti-Trump landslide will be from safe districts. If Trump wins, well, the party will take that to mean it’s all right to go full-fascist. Either way, soul-searching is unlikely.
6. For this reason, the Republican Party—even if a tidal wave crashes on Trump—is not going to snap out of it and mend its way. That’s a tale told by individuals wanting to believe cold-blooded partisans as not as cold-blooded as they thought.
3. Setting aside the problem of presuming Donald Trump is going to lose based on recent polling, and setting aside the problem of presuming the election is going to be fair, consider this: his aggregate approval across-the-board has been and remains about 40-43 percent.

Those that post #BlackLivesMatter but still deal in racist tropes. Those that disregard truth for their own view of the world like Trump supporters. Those that hide their misogynoir (misogyny to black women) behind “policy”. This is why I’m skeptical and don’t trust them.
whenever white liberals clutch their pearls about something trump says/does, i think about aimé césaire saying that hitler’s biggest crime was applying to europeans the colonialist procedures that europe had until then reserved exclusively for africans/arabs/indians.

Our existential state of being and day-to-day lives take place not in NASDAQ, but in the real world where Trump has ceded power to authoritarians in China and Russia, assaulted the 1st Amendment, sealed our fate re: global warming, stripped health care, and turned doj on its head

Kinda surprised that Trump voice even has a computer
Just a reminder that the goal here is almost surely not to move the election, which Trump can’t do, but to undermine public confidence in the election and its outcome.

His passing evokes so much added sorrow because it was so preventable so just so stupid. Going to the Tulsa Trump rally, unmasked, with no distancing, while having existing health conditions was absolute folly. I wasn't at all a fan, but I'm saddened at the  news of his death.
#RIPHermanCain Just because someone attended a Trump rally does not mean they deserve to die. I hope instead this serves as a wakeup call to his supporters. My best to Mr. Cain's family.
Trump floats November election delay - but he can't do that
I wrote a thread yesterday of the 🦇💩 crazy stuff Barr said at his hearing. At the top of the list is claiming there was no clear answer on whether POTUS can delay the election. Remember that these kinds of answers give Trump legal cover when he acts illegally. Barr must go.

Who will serve as a democratic check on Trump? i) Republicans who will vote for Biden instead of Trump (vote-switching); ii) Democrats who will turn out for Biden instead of abstaining (backlash); iii) Republicans who will abstain instead turning out for Trump (disenchantment).
In today’s “least surprising news ever”, Trump calls for delaying the election
This "opinion" by  does not age well🤪
To be more precise, I’m skeptical Trump would leave office without an election being held, an overwhelming electoral defeat, and massive street protests. Without any one of those, he may cling to power.
In this Tweet, Trump is attempting to plant in the minds of his supporters that they can abandon democracy for him.
From  "Autocracy: Rules for Survival".    Rule #1:  Believe the autocrat.
Pretty much the opposite of actual trends. Whitey, as you call him, is inspired by Trump to make one last pathetic grasp to maintain his social benefits as his generation withers and disappears.
Trump trying to delay the election is basically the free square in the 2020 bingo card.
I need some help from  and other law experts as to what this means. Didn't SCOTUS already OK the public charge policy?
But   will never print that Trump is racist. In fact, the text is one step removed from claiming Trump actually did something racist. They can’t ignore the tweet, so they have to temper it, while still acknowledging the message.
President Trump, lagging in the polls, floats idea of delaying election  via

CNN right now-  reminding the world that President is buying into conspiracy theories and trying to delegitimize his own (Trump) loss by suggesting election should be delayed.
Times seem dark now, my fellow Americans, but the year could very well end with Trump being voted out of office and scientists completing a coronavirus vaccine. Just sayin’.
JUST IN:  President Trump is for the first time floating a “delay” to November’s presidential election, as he makes unsubstantiated allegations that increased mail-in voting will result in fraud.
Everyone paying attention saw this coming.
the hilarity (besides horror for democracy) is the sheer # of folks in #Trump administration—INCLUDING TRUMP HIMSELF—who voted by mail.  stay woke.
Trump loves to set records. Also, I believe red states have now surpassed blue states for COVID19 infections.
Trump floats delaying presidential elections without even catching a sleeper cell of foreign provocateurs? The man can’t do anything right.
He can have house arrest, for all I care. Just take away his Twitter privileges. That would be a punishment worse than death for Trump.
By law we must have a new (or reelected president) Jan 20. If we don't  will become President,  #USElection #Trump #mailinvoting #Constitution

We know Trump is a New York City racist.    What is more interesting here is that he thinks Iowa is a suburb.  Of Chicago? Of New York?     There has always been a disjunct between city-boy Trump and his rural base.   It's worth driving an 18-wheeler into that gap.
Trump defines Iowa, like Vermont and Maine, as 'suburbs' because they are white.   Politically -much as the racism disgusts - it may be more important that Trump imagines Iowa as a Chicago suburb.   He's clueless about the challenges and problems facing Iowans. 1/
Also underscores the fact that no one expects Trump to win the popular vote.
I know suburbs.  I live in a suburb.  I've lived in towns and rural areas. Iowa is not a suburb.   For all of his variable -- and gilded -- residences, Trump never left eastern Queens.
There’s been anecdotal reports since Trump started pushing this “cure” that people who have been on this drug for years for chronic afflictions suddenly can’t get it and have been rationing their prescriptions.

I'm surprised that Trump hasn't started tweeting about the Demoncratic Pary.
I call for the immediate resignation of Donald Trump!!
If Sen Warren is unhinged, what would you call Donald Trump saying that Intelligence didn't reach his desk about Putin putting a bounty on the heads of our servicemen in Afghanistan?  If we notified our British allies about it why wouldn't it have reached his desk?  #TraitorTrump

The pandemic response team which trump disbanded. Trump has failed in almost everything he’s done so far.
A recession was predicted back in 2010 for around 2017 which trump must’ve been informed about and did nothing to prepare for. Just like Covid. History shows a pandemic around every 100 years. W was notoriously nervous about it, Obama thought it was Ebola which is why he made...
The data proves the economy was improving for the last 10 years. George W’s admin tanked it in 2008 by unregulated monetary policy. Now it’s completely down the shitter by trump not implementing proper policy to protect from this inevitable downturn.
Love it!  Trump 2020

Are you suffering from Trumpistis? Not the Trump vius, but the Trump sindrome. The most common symptom is perpetual, debilitating, excruciating pain in the ass.
You all know the 1st day after Biden is sworn in trump { he doesn't deserve the capital T} will say how much $ he lost while being pres then how big his companies grew cause he'd been   strongest &amp; most powerful pres ever &amp; his presidential library will be 2X larger than Obama's.

Trump was first advised of a possible pandemic in January. Now its July with over 4 million infections &amp; there's still no national testing strategy, no mask mandate &amp; the wait for results is 7 to 14 days which makes contact tracing all but impossible!!  #TrumpVirusCatastrophe

I find it very hard to have sympathy for the those states who are seeing the worst of Covid now. They could’ve learned from our mistakes. They couldv e shown common sense and trump would be getting a 2nd term. The average person who follows protocol I feel for. But the others? Eh
Trump focused on golf this weekend while 1,000 people are dying daily for #COVID19. Exactly what is he doing to end the pandemic? No national testing strategy, no mask mandate &amp; tests that take 7 to 10 days for results which eliminates contact tracing!! #TrumpVirusCatastrophe

Trump ignored our Intel agency reports and last year shut down the CDC operation that had American scientists in China watching for signs of pandemic.  If the only sources of information Trump used were the WHO and China, that’s his own fault.
Too bad Trump didn’t listen to our intel reports and closed the CDC operation that put scientists on the ground in China watching for pandemics.  Who did he listen to? Xi, who told him what he wanted to believe.
Trump just called protesting Americans “terrorists.”
W was out of his depth as POTUS, but he would never have let Russia get away with paying the Taliban to take potshots at our service members and he did not trash our alliances the way Trump has done, even though he was very unpopular.
We need a revolt. Why is Biden even on the ballot. He isn’t well. We the people deserve way better. Vote trump at least he has some marbles.
SNOWFLAKES WITH ONE BALL WHITE OR BLACK THEY WILL FALL . TRUMP WINNING .

Look at the big picture. Look at the National Debt. The one Trump said he would eliminate but is now higher than ever. U may get more in the short term in ur pay but look at the long term &amp; the money we owe to foreign governments that we'll end up paying for one way or another
No! Herman Cain refused to use common sense over ideology/agenda! A smart businessman who refused to see what was coursing through the Earth! A man who let his arrogance be the deciding factor  to attend the rally! Plus not seeing *Trump doesn't give two sh*ts if he lives or dies

It is extremely concerning that the peaceful transition of power in the US is this questionable.
The Trump Spiral
Yeah, OSHA publishs rules for a safe workplace (PPE, sanitary rules, etc.), just like it does to guard against any other workplace hazard. But Trump won't let that happen because he doesn't want businesses to face any restrictions on full opening. Triangle shirtwaist fire redux.

It’s delusional to think Biden or trump cares about you.
It’s always been this current dumpster fire. The only difference that’s making people notice now is Trump brags about the fire from the rooftops instead of smiling and promising hope and change and pretending it doesn’t exist.
This is as real as authoritarianism gets. We were worried about Trump challenging election results; it is now time to worry that he will attempt to prevent any elections at all.

Fox talking points. McConnell refused to consider Obama's nominees for the federal judiciary. That is why Trump had so many judgeships to fill, because McConnell left them empty. This was unprecedented so Reid responded by eliminating the filibuster only for non-scotus nominees.
There is a straight line from Trump’s Tulsa rally to Cain’s ultimate demise. Is Trump really stupid enough to draw attention to that?

actually people still where there after trump has them gassed them and the police only pushed violence on them so trump could hold his bible, you know im right
I doubt she cares she sounds foolish. Typical lefty, mooching off everyone else(and proud of it) &amp; attacking anyone who disagrees with them politically or socially. All feelings,no facts. Not 1 lefty can tell me why they hate trump policy wise, it’s all how they feel about him.

Trump should just wear one of those NASCAR driver outfits covered in brands at this point, Russian flag patch on the arm too.
actually it was peaceful you just deny the facts, as most retarded trump supporters do. Also hows that alien dna in the coronavirus you want to explain that buddy?
Even if he wore masks, told everyone else to wear masks, and directly contradicted all of Trump’s misinformation about the virus, he still supported the death cults of conservatism and capitalism.  If hell existed, he’d burn in it for that alone.
This is what is important to trump. Not the 150K+ Americans who have died of COVID. Not the Russian bounties on our soldiers. Pizza?! WTF
Trump would give us the first female president and this all stems from Hillary pied piper strategy... lol
I suppose if I were going to lose my job, which is definitely evident in recent national polls, I’d want to delay the election too....can’t wait to holla at ya when u do tho....hey Trump “YOU’RE FIRED”
If Trump was a Democrat, these people would be out on the Capitol steps denouncing his statements about delaying the election and calling him a wannabe dictator. That’s what they did to Obama who never proposed anything egregiously unconstitutional like this.
Presidential elections are held by the states (they're only electing the Electoral college electors after all). Trump has literally no ability at all to stop or delay that.  So, if any election happens, the Presidential election happens.
do you think its ok that trump had peaceful protesters shot at with rubber bullets and tear gassed so he could hold a bible that he doesnt read upside down?

COVID19 is the perfect disease for snake oil salesmen like Trump because it’s only by analysing lots of data correctly that the effects of any particular treatment protocol can be determined. As an individual with the disease you’ll never know if HCQ helped you or not.
The reason Trump is pushing HCQ is that 80% of people with COVID19 get better. But if you take HCQ and get better then a lot of people will say it saved their lives whether it did any good or not. Trump looks like a genius for promoting a bogus cure.
And yet Trump will vote by mail. #Election2020

Unless he can guarantee that Trump wins the election, Barr should be very careful about what he does next. There needs to be a full legal reckoning for the agents of corruption and chaos in the Trump Administration.
Nope because all of the White people who voted for Trp immediately nullified voting for Obama. And I'm sure some people voted for Obama and then for Trump. I just know it.

I’m assuming most athletes are Trump supporters 😞
That is his plan.   "in the primary elections held so far this year, at least 65,000 absentee or mail-in ballots have been rejected because they arrived past the deadline, often through no fault of the voter."  Trump won the EC by 77,000 votes in 2016.

Trump is such a low life!
That is not a surprise . Why would a wildly racist man go to a civil rights leaders memorial? Trump is a horrible human being. He has no reedeming qualities.
Because, in normal times, the President is able to put personal and political differences aside to honor a great servant to the nation. Trump trashes the idea that we are Americans first and that ideal supersedes politics.
At the same time that Trump has expanded executive power beyond anything previously imagined, he has vastly diminished the ability of the President to positively influence people’s lives.
Putin is younger and in much better shape; there’s no way Trump outlives him.
At this point, it’s easier to list Trump’s good qualities: 1/ ... That’s the list.

Yeah I had my kid look up several of the teachers on social media, quite the dining out crowd and one that just drops F bombs at Trump.  Master's degree grade intellect stuff.
So, given Trump's embrace of extra-legal violence and the wholesale collapse of the American economy, can we start using the (hideously problematic) term "global south" to refer to anything south of Canada?

Agree. Also, what no one talks about is in 2016 14% of Bernie Sander’s voters voted for Trump. The left should worry about getting them in the Biden camp.Like the peaceful transfer to Trump!
I hear you, I just see a lot of people praising Obama when they shouldn't and I fear that it could lead to people not holding anyone who isn't Trump accountable in the future. Mad I have to vote Biden, but I will vote for him nevertheless

Trump against Big Pharma. Everyone can get behind that..... right?
There’s a part of me that still holds out hope Trump with ultimately resign so as to avoid losing in the election. The response to COVID-19 and the new reports of the GDP plummeting last quarter should, in themselves, be embarrassing enough for him. Wishful thinking, I know.
If Trump had followed the CDC guidelines, there never should have been a rally in the first place!
His death is on Trump’s hands!!! He most definitely contracted COVID at Trump’s rally and now he’s dead. Shameful
Trump should resign. I will keep saying it. Trump should resign.

Dems will try to have Kamala Harris debate Donald Trump.
Kamala Harris' selection proves Dems know they have ZERO chance of beating Trump in 2020.  No moderate will ever vote for a CA rep with Biden's dementia.

The Dems are happy Herman Cain’s dead because it’s just one less black conservative they’ll have to spend time calling a sellout and an Uncle Tom. As if smearing Trump in the process wasn’t bad enough. BTW he had stage 4 liver cancer so I doubt his death was entirely due to Covid
Did he have any other underlying conditions that made him more susceptible to the virus? I don’t think being unmasked and at a trump rally was the only reason for contracting and dying of this virus. Poor statement! A mask is not 100% effective.
I guarantee you they will say not my president because people did when trump was elected.

And because Obama was the star of the show at the funeral today and trump was not even invited.

Someone should tell us what Trump said, we were all watching Obama.
I voted Trump in 2016. I will not vote for him this year. However no matter which way the election goes, I will accept it as I did and would’ve in 2016. IMO to not do so is foolish
Can we all agree that this is no longer a matter of public safety, but instead a political ploy to demonstrate Trump’s “failure to successfully deal with this virus and keep our citizens safe.”  That’s why states and economies are still closed.  It’s pathetic..
Hey, Trump, why not delay our elections permanently? Then you can have it all forever, just like your old pals, Xi Jinping and Putin.

Trump floats November election delay - but he can't do that
MAIL IN VOTING IS ABSENTEE VOTING IM GONNA LOSE IT. There is no difference between the two. The practice has been used for years and you Trump have used mail in voting for elections. The vetting process is still the same as it is for absentee. Taking it away is voter suppression.
Regardless of the legal ramifications of this proposal, the very fact that Trump is considering an election delay is frightening— though perhaps not all that surprising.
Because Joe Biden is so much more competent- you know the guy who can’t get a sentence out, or wait the guy who has NO CLUE where he is most of the time or maybe his weird sniffing issues!!! Um I’m having serious issues trying to figure out how ANYONE THINKS THAT IS BETTER!#Trump
Ha! That's always been the case. But now Trump is setting it up so that any result besides him winning is illegitimate even though its polling like he could lose in a landslide.
So we start the day with Trump suggesting the November election be delayed. Legally won’t happen. But underscores the need for an election.
People ought to sound the alarm about Trump’s ‘delay the election’ tweet, but remember that this man’s currencies with his base are fear and panic. He knows he can’t delay it, so he’s building scapegoats now. He wants to give his base a badly needed jolt. He wants to play victim.
.    a lack of any immediate action on Trump floating an election delay in lieu of mail in voting is almost as criminal as his behavior. Please act immediately

Except that parts of it have been proven unequivocally true. There was a Russian operation to help get Trump elected. Trump campaign operatives met with Russian agents and hid those meetings. Yes, the Aussie was the reason for launching the counterintelligence investigation.
An Australian diplomat was the initial impetus for investigating the Trump campaign, not the Steele dossier. No human Intel is 100% accurate, so further investigation was warranted. You cannot get a FISA warrant renewed unless it has revealed new Intel, like this did 3x.
How do a solid 40% still approve of Trump?  I just don't get it.
I'm looking forward to her laughing when Trump loyalists whine and complain at being held to account for their lawlessness.

I was actually surprised to find the high level of sensitivity to the pathology of the family. After reading the book, I understood why Trump can’t admit failure, why being “The Killer” that Dad wanted him to be means unfeeling + character assassination.

Who wants to bet that beachreader never read Mary Trump’s book? Because I they had, they would realize that her writing expressed some compassion for Donald for the way his life was twisted by his father at an early age.
1) It’s the  that runs the Library, not the Foundation. 2) Reagan was a public figure &amp; official WH photos of him are in the public domain. 3) While I can’t abide Trump, a private foundation claiming rights to the likeness &amp; name of a US president is total legal BS.
Our military should be removing trump secret police
Why isn’t our military speaking out and protecting the citizens of this country vs trump . Our military should be taking down the private troops attacking our protestors . Do something

Pretty sad that us Trump Trolls Care more about  Chicago than their elected officials🇺🇸

Dems burning down cities and then having their actions justified and encouraged by politicians and pundits.  Ridiculous to assert that Trump is the problem with these “mostly peaceful protests” nor the resulting COVID illnesses and deaths that ensued.

If he was pres there’d be a million dead. He did criticize trump for stopping flights from china.

Trump is ACTIVELY making the USA a smaller and weaker country.   What are exactly are you protecting Senate Republicans?
So far Trump's pandemic handling has cost the Republicans 2.4 trillion in US GDP over the last 6 months.   US GDP is now only $19.5 trillion which is pretty much where it was when Trump took office in January of 2017.   4 years of nothing under Trump.

"If Donald Trump and the Republican Party want to try to change the date of the election, the Democratic House will stand up for the Constitution and stop them." Thank you, Congressman
Let's be clear about one thing: A Presidential candidate, even if it is the president, it is not a legitimate candidate if he runs against the US constitution.   Trump should be removed from state ballots since he clearly wants to dissolve the US constitution.
You support secret police, Trump's racism, failure to protect our military from Putin, refusal to protect elections but no comment about Trump wanting to postpone elections but not school reopening! On a day we honor John Lewis, Trump is a corrupt, pathetic coward! #TRE45ON
Nothing will be safe until Trump is removed from power or the US breaks up. Thy guy is clearly insane and there is enough idiots in the South to go along with him.
It has been an insane news morning. Trump is doing this crap to blunt the bad GDP numbers.   But still, the US constitution is not a joke and not a diversion tactic, and people should take his ass seriously and make him pay for his tweets.   Each has to have a cost.
People missing the obvious here. Trump tweeting about delaying the election AT THIS MOMENT is an obvious ploy to get attention off the #JohnLewis funeral which #JoeBiden, #BarrackObama, #GeorgeWBush and #BillClinton are attending.  He wants to be the top story, one way or another

Trump's twitter account needs to be deactivated.
If Trump is going to break the Constitution, he loses all power immediately. Today.   He is only in this office and has this power because of an election.   If there is no election, Trump immediately is stripped from any official capacity.
All of Trump's powers come from the Constitution. Trump clearly is in violation of his oath to execute the Constitution.   Trump needs to be removed from power immediately.   America is a f-ing joke. You have a Constitution, people in government should follow your it.
Exactly!  I got a good chuckle when Trump gave the same answer he gave to HRC in 2015 -- We'll see what happens.  If there are enough idiots to vote for Biden this country is doomed.

If you thought the civil unrest was bad in early June just wait until Trump tries to force a delay in the election. Of course this won't be the last time he will mention it. He will "absente minded float the idea because he can't help himself, but any real attempt will be stopped
You are a cat, and  Trump has the pen light. 😁
Trump needs to be removed from power today.
Luckily, Trump does not have the power to delay the election, only Congress does. Moreover, Trump has abrogated the roll of the federal government in the response to the pandemic, delay or any suggestion thereof is purely political.

Congratulations  By refusing to hold Trump accountable during impeachment THIS is entirely your responsibility!  #GOPFailedAmerica #TraitorTrump  #TRE45ON #AllRoadsLeadToPutin  #RussiaOwnsTrump #PutinsPawn
Trump has been a racist his entire life &amp; everyone knows it whether or not they want to admit it! He isn't using a dog whistle these days, he's using a bullhorn!!  #RacistInChief #TrumpIsADisgrace  #TrumpIsUnfitForOffice  #ToxicTrumpMustGo
People in America are suffering physically, emotionally &amp; economically but Trump wants to fund a new FBI building (near his hotel) with relief funds!! How is that helping the hurting American people? Hint. It doesn't.  #GOPCorruptionOverCountry  #TrumpVirusCatastrophe #VoteGOPout
Trump promoted a fake cure for #COVID19 that could literally cost Americans their lives but let's blame the tech companies for his complete stupidity &amp; malfeasance!!  #TrumpDeathToll150K #TrumpIsADisgrace  #TrumpVirusCatastrophe  #GOPGenocide #RepublicansAreKillingUs
With the troop withdrawal from Germany, specifically, if anyone is yet unconvinced Donald Trump is the greatest weapon engaged against the West in the Cold War, they’re fucking oblivious.
Does the sudden withdrawal of troops from Germany have anything to do with Trump's latest phone call with Putin where he failed to mention Putin putting a bounty on our soldiers? Trump is a national disgrace &amp; international embarrassment!!  #AllRoadsLeadToPutin #PutinsPuppet
Um... what's this now? Trump’s New Favorite COVID Doctor Believes in Alien DNA, Demon Sperm, and Hydroxychloroquine:
Like Trump, men in the Republican caucus, are very disrespectful towards women!! Its absolutely disgusting!! 😡
Good morning trump is pulling US troops out of Germany because it makes less of a threat for Russia on the European continent aka trump is acting on orders from Putin
The pandemic response team which trump disbanded. Trump has failed in almost everything he’s done so far.
A recession was predicted back in 2010 for around 2017 which trump must’ve been informed about and did nothing to prepare for. Just like Covid. History shows a pandemic around every 100 years. W was notoriously nervous about it, Obama thought it was Ebola which is why he made...
The data proves the economy was improving for the last 10 years. George W’s admin tanked it in 2008 by unregulated monetary policy. Now it’s completely down the shitter by trump not implementing proper policy to protect from this inevitable downturn.
I don't like Donald Trump because he's a lying fear monger who doesn't know his butt from a hole in the ground when it comes to politics and how the country should be run. #WhyIDontLikeTrump
Love it!  Trump 2020
This is The a United States but #trump is a piece of shit and acts like we are all separate countries. #TrumpPressConference #TrumpResignNow stop embarrassing yourself
Trump is a puppet for Putin &amp; the most corrupt &amp; incompetent man to EVER inhabit the oval office!!  Amost 4.5 million infections, 150,000 dead while he focuses on removing troops from Germany!!  #TraitorTrump #TRE45ON #PutinsPuppet  #AllRoadsLeadToPutin  #TrumpDeathToll150K
You have enabled the most corrupt man to EVER inhabit the oval office since Day 1. Voters will come out in record numbers to remove Trump &amp; his cronies! #CowardlyCollins #VoteCollinsOut  #GOPComplicitTraitors  #GOPBetrayedAmerica #GOPMustGo   for Senate! #FlipTheSenate
We need an AG who defends the American people NOT the corrupt coward in the White House!! Trump is completely lawless &amp; his cronies in Congress are complicit!!  In less than 100 days voters will come out in record numbers to remove the most corrupt administration in my lifetime!
Do9nnie "Dimwit" Trump is responsible for the deaths of 150000 Americans!  He hasn't even mentioned them!
Little by little it looks like Republicans are standing to up to Trump &amp; he doesn't like it at all.  #TrumpIsADisgrace #TrumpFailedAmerica  #TrumpFailedAmerica #BidenPledgesAllegianceToUS

I thanked him that day!! For everyone who wonders why he didn't ask that question weeks ago, it's because Trump refuses to take Brian's questions because he's a coward!!  #CowardlyTrump #RussianBounty  #AllRoadsLeadToPutin #RussiaOwnsTrump
Trump did the right thing, who wanted to hear a  disingenuous white supremacist for christsakes.  He didn't like or respect John Lewis. ,,so.. Let him go to his clan rallies, no comment was necessary from this racist pc of shit, to ruin the send off of a great man. #GoodTrouble
Like Trump said the one thing DemonRats do is stick together.  Their  buzz word / phrase is peaceful protestors - poor little peaceful protestors getting hurt.  They SUCK
Losers and liar Dems - Trump said he will buy a RV, and together with Melania, ride back to his palatial penthouse in NYC !!!
And don’t give me that msm bullshit. Hilary’s emails were cover 85% of the time by them. Trump was the only candidate with entire rallies being covered on national television. He did just fine in 2016. The rest was self inflicted wounds because of his mouth.
everytime someone from the Trump admin. speaks... who are they trying to convince Trump is doing a great job.. themselves? Because the majority of Americans know better 🙄 so sad their ship is going down.
You trust Trump's judgement. Don't speak for the rest of us.
That -18% GDP growth in 2020 is going to look great on Trump's resume!  Republicans are going to have to carry that cross for the rest of their lives.

This is stunning. Almost as stunning is when Trump questions whether Russia is arming Taliban and says that info “never reached my desk” and  points out that fmr Afghan commander Nicholson has affirmed this in public
Students slam Trump for profiting from presidency...then find out that w...  via
BTW, this "caravan" scam that Trump pulled off in 2018 is also a crime.   Using US military or US agency for election purposes is a crime.
Nothing—why responsible and “real” police identify themselves by uniform, insignia, badges, and name plates. And drive marked cars. And have protocols requiring verbal ID. Trump’s secret police have nothing to do with “law and order”—they are undermining actual police work.

Trump claims that Biden will ruin (his) America. When I read that I think to myself “and it will be glorious”. Trump’s values are spreading like an insidious disease and this is what it looks like. Stop the insanity. #bluenomatterwho
It’s remarkable how quickly people give up their credibility, their oath and their soul to protect Donald Trump. Barr is nothing but a tool, a means to an end for DJT. He’ll kick Barr to the curb as soon as he’s done with him. Fools.  via
Trump says the country will suffer if Biden is elected. Indeed Trump’s America WILL suffer, make no mistake. Trump brought us here, the darkest days I’ve seen in this country in my lifetime. Trump values the wrong things. #voteblue

Trump: Let's put the Adam's Family Witch in charge of coinage
Biden needs to be thrown off the ticket. There is going to be a mutiny against the vampires that own the party. This man is a racist and a fascist to his core, he is not meaningfully different than Trump.
Are you suffering from Trumpistis? Not the Trump vius, but the Trump sindrome. The most common symptom is perpetual, debilitating, excruciating pain in the ass.
Same question as why trump played golf while Americans are dieing!
Patty, my better half asked me, "did u notice Barr was more aggressive w female Congresspersons talking over them &amp; through them"? Yes I did notice! Very notable with trump, barr &amp; many lackeys. Speaking about lackey what's with Gym Jordan. trump worried about FAUCIs popularity
Bill Barr needs to remember that he is America’s lawyer, not Donald Trump’s.  #ImpeachBarr
You all know the 1st day after Biden is sworn in trump { he doesn't deserve the capital T} will say how much $ he lost while being pres then how big his companies grew cause he'd been   strongest &amp; most powerful pres ever &amp; his presidential library will be 2X larger than Obama's.
impeached trump is Inhuman.

This is all on Trump hands 💯
Dear Mr Trump: We are so proud of your Covid-19 updates. That's what will take to be re-elected, since much of Nov Election is unfortunately hinged on the virus. It would not apply to me but I am mindful of brainwashed folks who fear the world is caving down!
Shut up #trump #TrumpIsACompleteFailure

Should be good - Pence is doing great as the Task Force leader - he ia a loyal and hardworking builder of confidence in Government - where would Trump be without him ?
This election 15% of your supporters plan to back Trump.
It'd be nice if your supporters endorsed Joe Biden. But instead they plan to vote for Trump or no one at all.
And meanwhile your supporters out of spite are planning to vote for Trump or not vote at all.
So we need progressive leaders in Congress, but your fans want Trump to get re-elected? How does that track?
The Sanders fan's plan: vote for Trump to spite Joe Biden. Worry about that, because none of this matters if your followers are going to keep these people in power.
Your supporters are planning to vote for Trump again so what difference does it make?
Introduce legislation to stop your fans from supporting Trump over Biden. They're not the same and you're all fools if you think we're better off with Trump.
Pathetic is hiring people you let speak publicly saying Biden is as bad as Trump.
Bernie has people working for him who think Biden's as bad as Trump. If all Bernie fans feel the same way it means 4 more years of President Trump.
"It's like saying to somebody, 'You have a bowl of s--- in front of you, and all you've got to do is eat half of it instead of the whole thing.' It's still s---," Turner told The Atlantic" ---Your followers are going to give the election to Trump, again. Congrats.
Yep, white supremacist agent provocateurs are mingling with peaceful protesters to serve Trump and Fox News their narrative. These guys are on the Trump/Bannon payroll
I don’t think she’s lying... I don’t support Trump but I do think they are purposely blaming him for a reason
The person prone to lying is Trump.  How did you get elected again? Your district comprised of Trump U grads?
I can't imagine how ANYONE can still support Trump!! Thank you for always asking the tough questions every chance you get!! There is NOTHING, short of Biden shooting someone on 5th Ave, that could make me change my mind! #RebuildWithBiden #ToxicTrumpMustGo  #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica

sorry can I pay $20 not to paint a bullseye on my chocolate forehead   should be wiping member rolls rn. Joe Biden abt 2 keep ALL the policestate toys and decimate the DSA/BLM/abolishICE/defundpolice as soon as he's in office, if Trump doesn't win.
William Barr claims to be a member of the Trump administration. Someone please remind him he works for the American people as Attorney General. He is not  ‘s wing man!
How is Barr a member of the Trump administration? He is supposed to be the US Attorney General serving the country not the GOP!!!

We wouldn’t have President Trump today if it weren’t for this guy.
Did Trump stop "believing" because he was elected?  This guy "believes" in CIA conspiracies and he can read literally every document they ever made! He can take Barron to skateboard in Area 51. He can declassify any file that exists. It's not about it making sense.

Trump shatters his own show of responsibility on the pandemic
Trump being completely wrong about something... no way, that's "a first" 😧🥴
This is a shame, seeing as (according to Trump himself) he was once one of the best young ballplayers in NYC. Highly skilled and scouted.    But then Wharton came a-callin’, and suddenly SATs and entrance exams had to be taken...by other, paid non-fucking idiots, in his place.
Comes down to FAT.  Trump loses any of Florida, Arizona or Texas, it’s over.

Watching Trump and his ilk slowly crucify Dr. Fauci is absolutely disgusting, but did we expect anything less from a President who forced NOAA scientists to eat shit because he misspoke about a hurricane?
Perplexed: Joe Biden who, after 30+ yrs has actually never helped the black community to prosper is probably gonna get their vote; whereas Trump has been employing blacks for decades &amp; as POTUS created the best economy that give us the low black unemployment rate ever. Go figure.

Hi  when you wrote about payroll tax... “Self-employed workers pay both the employer and employee share — but are generally able to deduct half of it on their tax return.” How do we deduct that? I’ve never heard this before.
I don't think Fauci was even all that troubled by the poor throw. When he went out to the mound he looked like a kid. He was thrilled. Trump would be devastated if he threw a poor pitch.
I call for the immediate resignation of Donald Trump!!

Is it necessary to use the 'man' descriptor'?  I hear in my head... Trump: See? People, many people, everywhere, even liberal writers, are calling me a man.
That in result could produce someone worse than Trump in the future
Trump is a public f-ing official. Disclosure of tax records is societal norm.

I  forgot to add “not a warmonger”  Yeah. I’m still struggling, I don’t like or trust either. Trump did (according to a few source) attempt to get troops back home but, I don’t agree with many of his policies and his leadership is awful. Biden has no charisma and to me

Biden has the perfect strategy.....he needs to shut his mouth and let the dumb guy continue to shoot himself in the foot. It’s actually pretty funny to think Trump lost the popular vote to the most unpopular candidate in history and now he is going to lose to a guy with dimentia
Americans have never been this panicked about a person running for the Presidency ever.   The urgency of getting rid of Trump in 2020 is 10 times larger than the urgency of getting rid of Hillary in 2016.
Could this be why no Republican Senators are including Trump in their campaign ads?  Most of them are already down in the polls!  #ToxicTrump #GOPBetrayedAmerica  #VoteGOPout #BlueWave2020

We're the most infected country on the planet due to Trump's incompetence! The House passed the Heroes Act months ago &amp; it still hasn't been passed the Senate!! Still no national testing strategy, mask mandate &amp; test results take 7 to 14 days which makes contact tracing useless!
Trump was first advised of a possible pandemic in January. Now its July with over 4 million infections &amp; there's still no national testing strategy, no mask mandate &amp; the wait for results is 7 to 14 days which makes contact tracing all but impossible!!  #TrumpVirusCatastrophe

The so called "V-shaped" recovery is figment in the imagination of the Trump bureaucrats.
I understand the fascination over what Melania is doing to the Rose Garden but I'd really prefer we focus back on the fact that Trump hasn't said a word on the bounties paid by Russia to kill our armed forces in Afghanistan.
Only in the head of Republicans do Americans think people should get paid less to deal with Trump's asinine handling of the pandemic.   Democrats insisting on $600/wk is an easy winner for Dems at this stage in the game.

Pretty amazing that they're wasting their time and energy on hit pieces about Steve Schmidt, who's not on the ballot anywhere. That's symbolic of a rudderless campaign that's only goal is to cater to Trump's ego.
Seriously-hang around &amp; get the stimulus pkg passed. The ppl of this nation - y'know - VOTERS - are counting on some additional help until they can get back to work. GOP turmoil from Donald Trump has reached a whole new level of frustration in the Senate:
That said nothing that happened in 2016 is happening in 2020 in poll models.   IF ANYTHING, 2020 polls OVERSTATE Trump's support.
A reminder that it's been two weeks since the Trump administration redirected COVID-19 data from the CDC to the HHS so take any "good news" about trends in cases, hospitalizations, and deaths with a giant grain of salt.
From back when Rickards wasn't a washed up Trump booster riding on a losing political train.
In case you can't quantify the exponentially escalating cost of keeping Trump as President. Every month the cost doubles.
300 million guns in America are about to get unleashed.   There is a huge human and economic cost to keeping Trump as President. Every month costs a LOT of money and resources.
Someone should tally up all the 'new lows' for Trump.

State and local funding cliff is as big if not bigger than PUA UI cliff  It certainly adds to unemployment and dramatic reduction in consumption because of Trump and McConnell's $10,000 SALT cap.
It’s crazy how you barely hear about what Melania Trump is up too but Michelle Obama was running things and making improvements....oh wait Melania is renovating the White House garden ......
I don't think California, North East and other suburban residents understand the tax code warfare waged against them by McConnell and Trump's Confederate Revanchists.
