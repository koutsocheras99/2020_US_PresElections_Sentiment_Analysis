Biggest GDP drop in recorded American history.   Thanks, Trump!
I think it would be a disastrous error! Look what happened when the Democrats got rid of the judicial filibuster‚Ä¶ We have a legacy of 200 Trump judges many of whom are totally unqualified for the job. Wouldn‚Äôt have happened with 60 votes needed!
Trump is only responsible for the impact of his bluster on his own reputation.  John Lewis realized that being inside was most effective, joining many others, like my old boss, Marion Barry, in doing so. He follows many into the eternal SNCC meeting, but there are some left.

Lewis did not recognize Trump as President. Obama used the platform to continue racism, the country needs renewal.  He used the occasion for campaigning against Trump. Please call that asshole out. He had 8 years to better this country and failed!
It continues  to amaze me how our nation could go from Obama to Trump.  WTF happened? I really fear for our country.
Will never happen. Trump does this for attention. Media reports it for ratings.
A few thoughts as I read ‚Å¶ essay in the Times. Emmett Till was a year younger than Lewis. Lynchings aren‚Äôt ancient history. The fight for voting rights is now, today. And I don‚Äôt care what Trump thinks about anything.  | CTV News
Unfortunately, while we would all love to see progress on the issues raised by Obama, doing away with the legislative filibuster will lead to more of what we were experiencing in this presidency, not less. Remember 200 Trump judges, many of whom are unsuited for the job!
Democrats are singularly responsible for all 200 of Trump way right wing, in many cases unqualified, conservative judges. That‚Äôs a legacy that will last past my lifetime!
One of two things is true about Herman Cain: he was infected by people not wearing masks at the Trump rally, or he was already positive and infected other people because he didn't wear a mask. So he was either murdered or he is a murderer. Also, his pizza sucked.
Something ‚ÄúDonald Jerk Trump‚Äù is very good  at (DEREGULATES )any and everything that Obama did . Bet Obama didn‚Äôt paid someone to pass his SATS ?

What does trump have to do for these so called GOP leaders to do anything to preserve our democracy?
In order to obtain political power in the Senate, Democrats are forced to compete in red states. It explains why Democrats are in the minority right now even with 9 senators from states Trump won, including from very red states like Alabama, Montana, and West Virginia.

Trump with the old sleight of hand trick üòÇ
"It's unclear how Cain contracted COVID-19. He tested positive [for covid] days after attending a campaign rally for President Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Cain (...) tweeted out a photo of himself at the rally where neither he, nor those surrounding him, were wearing masks."
Let's be clear: Herman Cain died because he attended a Trump rally/was around Trump people without a mask, caught COVID, and because it is very bad for those over 65, he died. Drilled down:  and the #MAGA morons killed Herman Cain.
Herman Cain would‚Äôve made a much better president than Donald Trump. #rip
#SchoolsReopening in Sept, but awful enough to delay election in Nov!  Is this Trump‚Äôs #GeniusBrain trying to distract from devasting economic news? Because ‚Äúsome people are saying,‚Äù if #Election2020 is postponed, we could get an interim #PresidentPelosi
Minutes after U.S. reported worst ever decline (-9.5%) in quarterly GDP &amp; 1.43 million new unemployment claims, #Trump tweeted not about extending unemployment benefits that run out tomorrow, but about postponing the election!  #COVID-19 resurgence is not bad enough to delay...
So? Do you think Trump will think about this and it will change anything? Probably not.
Well it still is satisfying. But I agree, nothing on twitter will change the #Trump followers.  They already are twisted.
If Trump loses in November (I‚Äôm far from convinced he will though) he will 100% do everything he can to fight the verdict and, if he is forced out of office, will incite violence in his supporters.   There is zero doubt in my mind about this. Buckle up y‚Äôall.

Whenever people have said that Trump isn‚Äôt authoritarian, I‚Äôve tried to tell them that democracy isn‚Äôt typically destroyed in one day. The recent trend is destroying democratic norms, undermining democratic institutions‚Äîand then canceling or delaying or stealing an election.

How can kids go to school and businesses reopen if conditions are so bad the election must be delayed? Trump is literally planning a coup - what will Senate GOP do since only Congress can change election day? Will they hold hearings or let this tweet trial balloon float away?

Whether witnesses provided the same information already is a secret. We could be closer to an indictment than Trump thinks. Whether he is prosecuted sooner or later is not as relevant as the fact that he cannot pardon his kids.

That‚Äôs almost exactly how Trump performed in TN-01 in 2016, which he won by 57%. Hillary Clinton did extremely poorly here, getting only 19.7% of the vote. Not even native Tennessean Al Gore could break 40% as a Democrat when he ran for president in 2000.
It never came to fruition, but if it had, Franklin would be one of the least populous and most Republican states in America.  found that if Franklin existed in 2016 it would have had a population of 876,797 (3 EVs) and Trump would‚Äôve won it by a massive 56%.

We can‚Äôt do this chaotic crap with this assholical monster piece of üí©. Citizens can‚Äôt take more irrational behavior. We are stressed out to the max. We don‚Äôt care about Trump‚Äôs wants or needs or fake news. Barr can‚Äôt support mail-in voter fraud-it doesn‚Äôt exist, no 1 cares enuf.
Trump makes every gd thing affecting him a nationwide issue. He doesn‚Äôt want to lose in November. Tough crap! TRUMP HAS TO LOSE IN NOVEMBER. AMERICA IS NOT SAFE OR HEALTHY OR GOOD UNDER HIM. Ask any stable nation on Earth! Trump is going over USA‚Äôs dead body.
TRUMP HAND PICKED the HEAD of USPS TO RIG THE ELECTION BY DELAYING MAIL, LOSING MAIL AND HOLDING MAIL UNTIL VOTING DEADLINE IS OVER. TRUMP IS A FELON. He needs to be removed from office and incarcerated.
This. Exactly so.  is President &amp; CEO of and for Donald Trump. EVERYONE else is a very distant second place.
‚ÄúWhat I learned in my years in the county is that the job is more important than partisan politics.‚Äù
Damn shame, so many will die from not wearing a mask at that donald trump sespool covid 19 rally in Oklahoma.
I was going to be snarky in my response, but realized that Trump's cabinet was at one point nothing but failed presidential candidates, and realized there's a good reason to get confused.
TRUMP DOESN'T HAVE AUTHORITY TO MOVE THE ELECTION! HIS RATIONALE IS IDIOTIC!  NO EVIDENCE OF ELECTION FRAUD - USED MAIL IN BALLOTS DURING 2 WORLD WARS.  WE GET PASSPORTS &amp; OUR DRIVERS LICENSE BY MAIL!  TRUMP IS JUST DESPERATE - HE'S LOSING.  HE'S A CORNERED MAD DOG!  DUMP TRUMP!

When is  it going to be enough for you to remove him from office? Trump is crazy &amp; dangerous &amp; this "delay election" propaganda is fascism. DO SOMETHING TODAY!
BLM (black lives matter) and Al Sharpton say and do nothing (NOTHING) about Bernell Tramnell a President Donald J Trump supporter being murderred in Milwaukee Wisconsin.....hmmm
People who, even after 3.5 yrs of Trump, think something will or won't happen because of "the rules" or "the system", confuse me. Especially political reporters.
trump is ‚Äúa great embarrassment to the USA‚Äù and has NO authority to delay.
There is no legal mechanism by which the President (alone) can delay the election.   There is no legal mechanism other than winning an election that keeps Trump in office post January 20th.
The worst economic numbers in American history just were released, and Trump talks about DELAYING the election! He did nothing to stop #COVID19. He knows he‚Äôs going to lose the election, so he talks about delaying #Election2020
Of course Donald Trump. He didn't attend Elijah Cummings funeral either.
RACIST TRUMP IS USING DIVISION, RACISM, &amp; FEAR MONGERING AS CAMPAIGN TOOLS!  HE SAYS SUBURBS DON'T HAVE TO DEAL WITH "THOSE PEOPLE" ANYMORE???    HE OVERTURNED AFFH - FAIR HOUSING RULE- THAT ADDRESSED DISCRIMINATION!  TALK ABOUT OUT OF TOUCH WITH REALITY!  DUMP TRUMP
I‚Äôm Grossed Out by Trump supporters! They are hateful, miserable and ugly like Trump.
A US Senator thinks it‚Äôs ok for citizens to be violently accosted on the street and thrown into an unmarked van. The police claim they were being assaulted by bottles and yelling (I guess). Oh well, what‚Äôs one more lawsuit? Or a small slip toward a police state run by Trump?
REMEMBER IN NOVEMBER   DIDN'T DISCUSS RUSSIA'S BOUNTY ON AMERICAN SOLDIERS WITH PUTIN  NO DISCUSSION AT ALL! GET THAT STRAIGHT! TRUMP'S INACTION IS TREASONOUS.   TRUMP IS A TRAITOR TO THIS COUNTRY &amp; OUR BIGGEST NATIONAL SECURITY THREAT.  DUMP TRUMP!

You ain‚Äôt black Biden is a bobble head and a Trojan horse that is an empty vessel that Sanders and AOC and  pelosi and Schumer and Robert Francis (beto) bozo Orourke use Xi of China likes Biden. Xi of China does  NOT like President Donald J Trump. Why? EZ  Xi can‚Äôt control him !
This is honestly why I don't like Trump's stance on this. He's kissing liberal behinds on this one.
Oh, thank goodness, I guess. I thought it was Trump in drag too.
Look, idk about anyone else but everytime I interact with a "die-hard Trump stan", I legitimately feel as though I'm losing brain cells every minute.

The socialist party of France supports a 35 hour workweek, universal basic income, a wealth tax, legal cannabis, and a 75% income tax bracket on millionaires. The Democratic Party doesn't even oppose all of Trump's tax cuts.
Trump is the Peace Candidate
I‚Äôve been saying this since Trump ran and won-ish. ‚ÄúWe have checks and balances‚Äù is a lifetime ago and a dystopian novel away.    EVERY sign of authoritarian regime.
BIDEN WOULD KILL US ENERGY! BIDEN WOULD TAKE ALL TAX BREAKS AWAY, NOJOBS, NO GUNS, DESTROYS AMERICA! VOTE PRES TRUMP AND SEND BIDEN TO HELL!
150K dead due to egregious federal mismanagement. Virus out of control. Bounties on US troops. Fascist mercenary squads. Endless racism. Quack doctors. Nonstop narcissism. And that‚Äôs just the tip of the Trump shitberg.

So Trump‚Äôs/Barr‚Äôs wannabe Gestapo are leaving Seattle &amp; Portland. Are they simply relocating to another city? Why wasn‚Äôt the NG not called out to stop/detain/arrest these Gestapoids for rioting? Were the Washington &amp; Oregon NG part of these wannabe Gestapo forces?
This is patently false. The poison pills you included including billions for fighter jets, an FBI building to up the value of Trump‚Äôs hotel (he‚Äôs trying to sell it after all) and more pork for large corporations who profits over people are the reasons this is stalled.
I think it's because the key is the middle 1/3rd that really doesn't care about politics. How do you get those people to side with Trump in Blue cities? Let them be completely inconvenienced &amp; frightened by the Dem's alliance of convenience with the Communists. It's brutal but..
Oh, come on! If Democrats have to give you reasons to vote against Trump God help you. Trump has literally shit on this country from day one. Vote blue if you love America and what it stands for.
Trump owes China about $200 million dollars. He has no intentions of paying.
"The¬†supreme Art of War is to¬†subdue¬†the¬†enemy¬†without¬† fighting" - Sun Tzu  Best to prevent the insurgency from starting in the 1st place. I heard it's Trump's favorite book; I think that's the goal here. Dems are flirting w/ civil war b/c they're afraid of imminent indictments
Barr is despicable. We should refuse to pay his salary. He has done zero work for citizens. Trump can pay him.
Fauci has always been genuine and intelligent. He can‚Äôt help it. Trump hates people who have wisdom.
America laughs at you trump.
Interesting considering his policies are effectively disenfranchising about 1 in 4 Americans who will need affordable housing. Many in his base. What kind of mental gymnastics will they need to perform to explain how Trump did this to help them?
Replace Suburban Lifestyle Dream with white people and low income housing built with POC, that's what he really meant. We need a Trump tweet translation bot.

He should brief Trump on it asap. In person.. within 4 feet.. for a few hours.. using a loud voice.. while moving excessively.
Putin: Listen, Don I‚Äôm gonna need you to move your troops out of Germany. Nazi Trump: Yessir, right away sir.. Putin: gonna need you to move desk to the bunker as well, I‚Äôm moving in. Nazi Trump: Absolutely, I‚Äôve gotten used to the basement.
or more precisely, Trump doesn't give a shit.
I think America has an internal domestic terrorist problem that dates back to the Theodore J. Kaczynski and beyond. Sweeping this under "not in my country" rug has allowed for the prolifiration of this mentality. Trump doused gas and lit a match on the embers.
I just read a comment on Facebook today that said if President Trump is taking Hydrochloroquine then isn't it safe?  I died a little inside because this person struck me as smart until a few minutes ago.  Trump needs to fess up and save lives.

The problem in Portland isn't the mob. Problem is that the local Mayor &amp; Gov. are ordering their police to stand down &amp; let the mob to attack the Feds unhindered, also that it's politically delicate for Trump to Federalize the Guard &amp; send them  in, so reinforcements are limited

Her statement might be the best argument for a Biden Win. All the progress the Trump Administration has made toward the destruction of the American people and the nation.

Hey Sanofi. You could save a lot of lives if you would just admit that hydroxychloroquine is not a useful treatment for Covid-19. Or are you hungry enough for profits to kill idiots that listen to Trump and his merry band of quacks. Make a moral decision please.

Remember a couple of years ago when a bunch of armed white Trump supporters took over a federal building in Utah and lived there for months and literally no one did anything about it?

Democrats still haven't accepted the 2016 election &amp; have spent the last 3 years coming up with conspiracy theories about how Trump must have won with the secret help of the Russians.
The right (Republican Party) has traditionally (before WWII &amp; arguably under Trump) been the anti-war anti-interventionist side of US politics due to its "isolationism."  CSIS is basically a think tank for defense corporations.

THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA IS A DISASTER THANKS TO DONALD J. TRUMP, THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA IS THE ENEMY OF THE  PEOPLE, 150,735 AMERICANS HAVE DIED DUE TO DONALD TRUMP‚ÄôS INCOMPETENT HANDLING OF THE CORONAVIRUS.YOUR STUPIDITY HAS KILLED AMERICANS CITIZENS.
Is that Trump?
Donald trump has 84.3 Million followers on twitter and Joe biden only has 7.5??? Oh man
funny how you think President Obama was disrespectful today to John Lewis! Trump turns every time he speaks into a campaign rally!  your Eulogy today was everything Mr. Lewis would have wanted.
Trump is in Putin's pocket.  That is the truth.  And so are many Republican senators and congressmen.  The NRA funneled Russian money to so many senators the only thing we can do is get rid of them all.  So you were saying about the origins though?
Trump will talk to anyone who will praise him and Brown ppl who hate other Brown ppl, don't get offended we got them too
Donald John Trump!!!!!!!
"In the end, Trump's obsession with hydroxychloroquine is an encapsulation of his presidency: a mixture of sham and scam fueled by questionable ideas pushed by fringe outlets, all working to undermine scientific expertise and sow chaos."
"In plain daylight,¬†Trump has funneled millions¬†of public dollars to his coffers while president, an ongoing violation of the Constitution and a direct assault on the public trust." #hydroxycholoroquine
trump will never be one.
If you're heading to #OCMD this weekend, there's a Trump-themed boat parade and raft-up planned for Saturday at 1 in Kent Narrows. This could result in some traffic issues (on land and water) in the Grasonville area.
"So we made it so dishwashers now have a lot more water. And in many places ‚Äî in most places of the country, water is not a problem. They don‚Äôt know what to do with it. It‚Äôs called ‚Äúrain.‚Äù They don‚Äôt have a problem."
This is what you get without Trump's speech writer. "Dishwashers ‚Äî you didn‚Äôt have any water, so you ‚Äî the people that do the dishes ‚Äî you press it, &amp; it goes again, and you do it again and again. So you might as well give them the water because you‚Äôll end up using less water. "
I can‚Äôt believe young people support trump lol just use ur internet like 10 minutes of research should be enough. You fucking disgust me to be honest
Oh! THAT is too far. Not the racism, not the Putin ass kissing, not the Trump pandemic that has killed 150k Americans (so far!). Good to know there is a line some Rs won‚Äôt cross. It‚Äôs a line way down the field (3 inches from the goal line), but here we are.
President Donald Trump‚Äôs pitch to delay the Nov. 3 presidential election ‚Äúreeks of desperation,‚Äù Democratic members of the state‚Äôs congressional delegation said Thursday.
And trump refused 2 pay his respects 2 a man that gave his blood, bones &amp; time 2 ensuring that all are treated as equal in the eyes of the govt, the law &amp; the People. Instead trump overturns housing rules that requires receivers of fed $$ 2 integrate underprivileged into suburbs.
I am so glad Trump was not at John Lewis‚Äôs Going Home ceremony. The only living Presidents who should be there with the exception of Carter were there. Trump is a racist bigot and has no place in our society.
Let's talk about Trump's call to suspend the elections....  via
That‚Äôs the truth! The government is happy to take our money and our souls. I am watching a Trump news conference and wish I could throw something through the TV. After listening to Bush, Clinton and Obama today Trump sounds like a 3rd grader. STUPID
Republicans to Trump: You can't delay 2020 election.   No way Hosey!  Read the Constitution, if you can understand it!
Trump throws out a crazy thought that would never happen, and the everyone goes crazy. I guess you just cannot help yourself. Says more about you than Trump.
IF YOU THINK THAT DONALD TRUMP IS A GREAT PRESIDENT, YOU‚ÄôRE THE DELUSIONAL ONE.
He held a BLM sign in what he called ‚ÄòAmerica‚Äôs most racist town.‚Äô The result? A viral video of abuse.  And watch the video. This is pure racism. No subconscious racism in Harrison AR...this is just overt racism. Trump has brought this to the forefront.
I FIND DONALD TRUMP‚ÄôS THREATS TO DELAY THE ELECTIONS TERRIFYING, THINK MILITARY COUP.
Oh God no. Just comparing the damage to Minnesota versus the country under Trump.
Trump came üò≥
In a legitimate world, none of the MSM should have shown up at the Trump event.  None.  None.  None.
Trump 2020
Black Trump supporter shot, killed outside his business
We're still in July. How much more can this president do to shake the foundations of our democracy before November? - McConnell and other top Republican officials rebuff Trump suggestion to delay the Nov. 3 election
Trump would LOVE to cancel the election.  Or delay it.  BUT, If the election was January 1, he still would have to leave by January 20.  So, what would delaying the election accomplish?  After his defeat, he still loses all powers on Jan. 20.  The goal post does not move.  Nope
yes, liberals allowing their cities to be destroyed and burned to the ground is Trumps fault?? Then getting angry when Trump attempts to stop the destruction.  Democrats destroy everything they touch, just look at the cities they run.
Pelosi isn't running for Office, so you don't have to worry about keeping that promise. Did you vote for trump?
You're entitled 2 your opinion. I believe Cheney was behind the entire set-up &amp; Bush was just pulled along by those who wanted a war 2 enrich themselves - defense contractors &amp; the wealthy that make billions from war. Like trump does w/private prisons &amp; the thousands he's caged.
Sure he will but only after making sure Donald J Trump, his cronies and lapdogs are all taken care of first and then only those few Americans who lick his feet while groveling to hope and get some crumbs as he sweeps by.
While the John Lewis‚Äô funeralwas going on Trump was tweeting about delaying the election.
Who can respect trump? He embodies hatred, ignorance, immorality, lack of ethics, lying and selfishness. Nothing there to respect.
All trump supporters look the same.
Trump's a dirtball.
That tells the story of who &amp; what trump is. Anyone that still supports trump after his myriad of failures &amp; the blatant hatred he holds for black Americans, can't hide behind "economics" 2 explain their support any longer. Your racism is in full view too.  #RIPJohnLewis
This tweet shows that the Trump campaign has nothing.  Nothing.  No platform, no nothing.    Where's Hunter?  Where's Trump's poll numbers.
‚ÄúLike, this is easy,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs two candidates here. One claims that our first Black president wasn‚Äôt a citizen, and the other was his vice president.‚Äù
Well MSNBC and CNN are not covering Trump.
If you want to "boycott, set your sights on Koch &amp; their thousands of holdings, including the majority of the media's corporate  owners. This is who trump  and the GOP serves. Money is their Master &amp; Koch is the Master of that money.
is behind the  failure to control trump's disastrous administration &amp; their mission to burn the Country to the ground &amp; sell our institutions off to the highest bidder, no matter who they are or what nation &amp; interest they serve.
If Donald Trump looks at this picture he will endorse you!! üòÖüòÖ
Boycott Patio Pizza, Trump is tweeting ads for it while he's killing people.
Global stocks, dollar slide as Trump's election tweet, GDP figures rattle markets | Article [AMP] | Reuters
trump has always manipulated the market 2 hurt those like Bezos &amp; Time Warner who didn't kiss his ass. Today he hurts not just those w/ 401Ks, but also his own crony Kkkapitalists, &amp; the global market, out of a need 2 deflect from the disastrous economic crisis of his making.
Trump 2020
Nothing drives desperate people into crime faster than having no way to feed their families &amp; keep a roof over their heads. trump should know that, no man has committed more crime than trump trying to dig himself out of his self imposed bankruptcies.
Instead of giving billions more to your cronies, which undoubtedly helps trump himself, why not make the People whole - it's your fault we're here Donny. No your idea is to beat the people down instead of helping them out of the disaster of your making.
There is nothing different now vs last year, except trump's failing poll numbers &amp; his failure to control a virus that has cost millions their jobs, and is forcing millions into homelessness &amp; poverty.  Instead of authoritarianism, why not help the people to survive?
Former presidential hopeful Herman Cain has died of COVID   The fool refused to take precautions &amp; made the ill-advised decision to attend a Trump rally filled with others who did not take the danger seriously  It seems to be a fitting demise of a backward and dangerous leader
Trump cannot postpone the presidential election, in the manner that many of fascist role models in years gone by have been able to. For the sake of our democracy and our economic well-being, WE CAN, and WE MUST, get this man out of the White House.
Donald Trump killed Herman Cain. Pass it on.
The corruption of the trump administration won't stay hidden from view. We still have justice in our court system even though the  tried to shut it down with their unqualified &amp; partisan appointments.
And shame on the  for letting him.
Biden was called crazy 3 months ago for suggesting trump would try to delay the election if he was losing andddd here we are

Trump's a snake oil salesman......
Or Trump.
That he caught from a Trump rally...
Every damn one of them. They can run, but they can't hide.  And of course, Trump does this on the day honoring John Lewis.  Come on November 3.
Trump plays these people like a fiddle. He doesn‚Äôt want them talking about Federal officers leaving Portland.....one tweet and Shazam! They‚Äôre not talking about it anymore.
Important read:
Trump is going to cycle through all manner of ‚Äúreasons‚Äù and ‚Äúexcuses‚Äù to prevent what he sees as a credible threat against his ability to stay in power. He will say anything.   The more serious threat to the election is voter suppression, which is a tried and true practice. (2)
Not sure who may benefit from hearing this, but:  Congress, not Trump, has the ability to postpone an election. And in the unlikely event that a postponement made it through Congress, the President‚Äôs term ends in January. (1)
We knew this was coming, anyone surprised? It is so depressing to know there is no low.The GOP can not be trusted because they are complicit in Trump corruption.
When was that picture taken. Trump's gait is off with his right leg.  He was dragging it just a few days ago.
#Trump's most egregious undermining of democracy yet. We need a landslide in November to remove him and prevent a complete transformation to dictatorship.
Trump is a failure!

"Trump can't delay the election" doesn't hold up if Trump does it by fiat, AG Barr backs him up and they go to court.    and every other Democrat needs to start clearly TODAY: Only Congress can change the date of the election.
donald trump to start
It's as if the  is willing 2 let trump completely burn the country 2 the ground, killing hundreds of thousands of us in the process, &amp; driving millions into poverty &amp; homelessness, in order 2 force us into privatization so we can be sold off piecemeal 2 the highest bidders.
Im just waiting for trump to be like
While Congress takes off as if they didn't know what we are facing. I don't know why people aren't screaming about this. We can not improve the economy until this virus is under control. The GOP is sitting on it's ass and letting trump destroy the Country as thousands die.
How low Biden will go? Are you fucking for real? Trump will do anything to steal this election. Joe Biden isn't saying anything that the rest of America doesn't believe.
#EVILBILLGATES's father sat on the Bd of #PlannedParenthood. And EvilBill is a substantial financial contributor to the world's largest baby killer today. Now that the US has abandoned the WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION (WHO) EVILBILL is the world's largest financial support for WHO!

"...Trump embraces science‚Äù or ‚ÄúTrump shows compassion‚Äù would fit the definition of genuinely surprising and headline-making."

That's Trump's base, they all look, act, and talk the same....
Obama didn‚Äôt shutter the pandemic response team &amp; say that the virus will just magically disappear. Obama didn‚Äôt make a big stink when the CDC suggested social distancing and face masks. Obama isn‚Äôt President now. And if you support Trump, you own this mess.
We must elect Biden, a Democratic Senate and hold the House.  Then we need to investigate Trump and those eight Senators that went to Russia in depth.

Didn't I read a story about you impeaching a judge. Once Trump is removed, we should investigate this criminal judge &amp; if he accepted a payoff, you could impeach him. Correct?
Yeah I heard they aren't leaving also.  I think even Trump tweeted about them not leaving....

Really?? Why would you lash out? Trump is a threat to the entire world. We need all the friends we can get.
Seriously Trump? Give it a rest will you. What have you done for the American People to like you?
DONALD TRUMP IS KEEPING HIS PROMISES TO VLADIMIR PUTIN TO SABOTAGE THE ECONOMY OF UNITED STATES OF AMERICAN AND TURN HIS BACK ON OUR ALLIES, DONALD TRUMP HAS NOW LEFT EUROPE VULNERABLE TO ATTACK FROM RUSSIA, DONALD TRUMP IS DOING EVERYTHING VLADIMIR PUTIN WANTS HIM TO DO.
AND RUSSIA PAYS DONALD TRUMP TO SABOTAGE THE ECONOMY OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA AND TO MAKE EUROPE MORE VULNERABLE TO ATTACK FROM RUSSIA. YOU ARE OBVIOUSLY FOLLOWING ORDERS FROM VLADIMIR PUTIN. DONALD TRUMP LOOK OUT FOR THE BEST INTEREST OF RUSSIA AND NOT OUR ALLIES.
WRONG!  Trump always puts Trump first.
In other words, "I, Donald Trump, president of the U.S., know nothing about international relations."
That‚Äôs because Putin has video of Trump being pissed on by Russian whores. That and why do you think he doesn‚Äôt want his taxes released? It‚Äôs not because we‚Äôll know how much he does/doesn‚Äôt have; it‚Äôs because we will know how much he owes Russian investors.
can't  enter her "office" without one. Respected members of the scientific community have conducted the research on hydroxychloroquine &amp; found it to be ineffective against covid. The VA was forced to use it by trump and stopped it's use after patients that were given the drug
Why can't the people file reckless endangerment charges against Trump et al. for contributing to the deaths of 150,000+ Americans and profiting off a drug they own which has been proven to kill people?

how is that protecting Federal property? Could this be why you're not getting cooperation from local officials? The  &amp; trump campaign posting pics of violence in Ukraine &amp; claiming it's Portland, even with their lies is telling a truth about Portland protesters.

George Bush made an excellent speech today coming from a Republican more about healing our country than dividing as is Trump &amp; complicit GOP. I agree he wasn‚Äôt brightest candle on mantle &amp; thought many of his policies wrong but he was a decent human being not petty or vindictive.
Respectfully, you had no problem committing fraud along with other GOP senators saying you had ‚Äúno intention‚Äù of being impartial in Trump‚Äôs impeachment trial before taking solemn oath to do exactly that. Knowingly allowing undisclosed 1st hand witness to be Trump defense lawyer..
Someone tell me why Trump has been bragging how high stock market is ( full disclosure fed has been pumping in billions keeping it artificially high ) while GDP dropped record 33% &amp; record numbers of Americans are unemployed &amp; struggling while GOP balks at directing $ their way.

I'm gonna need ya'll to be totally prepared for some of your favorite Left-leaning politicians and personalities/celebrities to be named right along the GOP/right/trump ones in these Ghislaine Maxwell documents that get unsealed.   Like, get your minds ready for that.
See, if Trump manages to hold onto the office through some kind of will-to-power fiat, that means it really is his country and we're just living in it. A president who made himself president has almost absolute power; but a Congress made by that same president has basically none.
There was nothing Trump was ever in a unique position to deliver... nothing they would lose in terms of judges or policy goals by dumping him.  What he had going for him was a bloc f voters who would not vote for a successor without his blessing.  What he had was his cult.
The reason they backed Trump before was *never* "he'll give them their judges". So would have Pence! There was an inane theory that the Federalist Society, GOP, et al would back Trump only until be filled the SCOTUS seat, them they would push him out.  Never made sense.
Trump cannot delay the election. He doesn‚Äôt have the power....but if the election were delayed the constitution states trump has to leave the White House on Jan 21st election or no election and Nancy Pelosi would resume power in that incident.
Because Trump didn‚Äôt win the election he got it through the help of Russia and still has yet to allow his tax returns to be seen and why? Because it will show he got money directly from Russia and also is laundering money just like his campaign is now.
I practice my French so frequently I‚Äôm most certain I‚Äôm fluent by now.. I can thank Trump for that üòÄ Watching Obama today I ask myself that very question how and the fuckity fuck did we get here..
Nobody has ever needed to be president the way Donald Trump does. Emotionally. Financially. Legally. He has no plan for living the rest of his life without the powers and protections of the office wrapping around him like a warm blanket.
Fuck delaying the election!!! We can wait a few weeks or a month for the results. It‚Äôs not going to be so bad and Trump knows his ass is finished anyway!!! He‚Äôs been the worst president this country has ever seen!!
I hope the family is aware that Trump is using them for a poltical statement as Ex-President Obama was starting the eulogy for John Lewis at the same time.
He is so petty. The thing is, he will never be the President that Obama was because a good President has to have empathy which Obama has and Trump is to full of himself to understand what empathy is.
GOP knew. I knew redistribution of wealth upwards would devastate poor &amp; safety nets &amp; be paid for by middle class. I voted against Trump. Hope people who did not notice GOP out business deductions for 3 martini lunches in lastest COVID relief package but not help most needed.

#Trump floats delaying #election--until 2024.
For once will you give Trump a little credit.
In the near future, we will have to contend with Alt-Right tRump deniers who refuse to admit that tRump ever existed.
It kind of looks like the only Statehood for Washington D.C. that tRump supports is Police Statehood!
Trump is the worst comedian ever.
GOP state &amp; U.S. Supreme Courts voted (remotely &amp; safely) last minute to force Wisconsin to unsafely vote in-person using 60 yr old precedent. But GOP &amp; Supreme Court mute as Trump threatens to delay Nov 3rd election falsely claiming ‚Äúauthority‚Äù despite Constitution mandates time
We won‚Äôt. We will vote. Because each child separated &amp; alone like each of our own children is not responsible for real, imagined, or drummed up crimes of their parents. Children ‚Äúlost‚Äù forever by Trump admin are not luggage &amp; can not be replaced which is why we must replace GOP.
The GOP pols who are saying this now... are a good sign, or at least not a bad one. But remember how many of them have been absolutists on something only to change course 180 degrees without comment or apology when Trump dug in.  We need to bring the pressure.
An inescapable truth: Herman Cain is simply the person whose attendance at the rally and death are both prominent enough to be noticed.  He is almost certainly not the first or last fatality of Trump's monstrous vanity in holding it.
You‚Äôd think Trump would accidentally get some lie partly right SOME time. But no! Once again completely wrong in the state where he votes where ‚Äúabsentee ballots‚Äù don‚Äôt exists only ‚Äúmail-in‚Äù ballots which in Florida are available to everybody and should be in each and every state
Donald Trump using the fear tactic just shows how desperate he is. Donald knows his ass is cooked in November. He and his supporters are going to be utterly embarrassed when Donald is thrown out on his ass! #Biden2020
IF trump was providing clearcut, 100% honest leadership, direction and allowed medical experts to speak truth, it wouldn't be half as bad. Trump could have stoppef this at the very start- and he chose not to. He is to blame that it overran the nation. That is just a simple fact.
I think Biden is going to tromp the crap out of Donald Trump in November. Donald is finished! The majority of America sees him for the fraud, liar and criminal he is. #BidenLandslide2020
Reminder that the difference between gallows humor and being a jerk is whose neck it is that's on the line.  With the malevolent malfeasance of the Trump regime on covid-19, we're all climbing the scaffold.
Trump suggests delaying 2020 election. üó≥Ô∏è#Election2020
It will if trump tries to delay the election. She could be the stand in pres.
The enthusiasm gap between the candidates is real: people are dying to get into Trump's rallies.
Wake the fuck up America! Vote him the fuck out! Donald Trump  Suggests Presidential Election Should Be Delayed via
Those people refuse to wear the mask because of trump. They stopped social distancing because he force an early reopening. They don't take the virus seriously because he has denied the science. But yeah he totally has nothing to do with all those deaths...
Between Carcer and Gilt, Sir Terry had the number of men like Donald Trump.
My President Trump !
Hi yes, please don‚Äôt vote for trump or Joe Biden. Ones an accused rapist and pedophile and clearly a racist and the other one is a straight fucking pedophile. Thanks for coming to my ted talk.
Take the threat posed by Donald Trump seriously. After four long years of penguin_club_911_call.png, stop saying, "He can't do that, it's illegal." and take the threat seriously.
No, crazyland is going to a rally in Tulsa without a mask because Trump tells you it‚Äôs ok.  Now Herman Cain will never see his grandkids again when he could have easily lived another 20 years.   This is not a political issue, this is life and death!
I'll tell you what trump has done things anyone thought he could do. YOU HAD BETTER LAWYER'S UP!! TRUMP IS ALREADY WORKING ON IT!!!
In Bible Abel killed Cain.  Complications of COVID-19 killed Herman Cain.  Maybe Cain NOT infected by not wearing face mask at Trump rally where leader of his party set example by not wearing face mask.  We‚Äôll never know &amp; we ARE sorry.  But why are so many still taking chances?
Around the time that the GOP decided that Shakespeare in the Park was an anti-Trump conspiracy, I coined a catchphrase that I haven't used much lately:  "Cry havoc, and let slip the dogs of civic participation."  Right now, those dogs are well and truly unleashed.
If we make enough noise, if we present a big enough backlash... then Trump will keep grumbling and grousing about how if the Democrats are so concerned they should delay the election and little will come of it, and some of you will think I was a foolish, ignorant fearmonger.
Stay angry, stay brave. Don't tell *me* that Trump can't delay, cancel, or ignore the election. Don't tell your neighbors and your comrades who are worried that it can't happen, that "It can't happen here." because it can, and it is.  Tell Trump. Tell your electeds.
THIS should be headline news not Trump suggesting he might delay Presidential election despite not having Constitutional authority he claims he has he does not.  On endless loop Biden predicting Trump would get desperate &amp; call for election delay w/every GOP saying Trump wouldn‚Äôt
If we do everything we can do and it doesn't matter... then we move onto the next everything we can do. We keep going, until he finds that final curtain.   But fundamentally, even more than he's a nihilist? Trump is a coward.
Trump will do what Trump will do; that is his power and his secret. We must do what we must do, regardless of what he will do. It's when we refrain from what we must for fear of what he will do that he wins. He treats everything as a game of chicken, knowing most will back down.
üëáJoe Biden was right. Is right. Trump is just pathetically desperate.
It is not sufficient to vote; it is necessary to vote. It is necessary to vote loudly and largely, it is necessary to affirm and uphold the legitimacy and necessity of the election so that the most people around Trump and the most people in the Mild Moderate Middle see it.
"So you're going to tell us to just vote?"  I'm not going to tell you to *just* anything. Strike that word from your vocabulary. Nothing Trump does is *just* a distraction, even if it distracts. We should not do *just* anything.   Do all things justly; do just nothing.
"Wait, are you about to tell us to vote? You just said Donald Trump can ignore an election and destroy the country no matter what we do, and you're about to tell us to vote anyway?"  MOTHER. FUCKER. YES. I. AM.
You want to talk about things Donald Trump is constitutionally incapable of? He is constitutionally incapable of stopping himself. He must be stopped.  Sometimes the people closest to him can stop him with words.
WHEN TRUMP WAS INAUGURATED, on the eve of his inauguration, I pointed out the significance of his inaugural dance number: a song about a man in a final showdown, facing the final curtain (that's DEATH), a man coolly staring down a firing squad.
The thing that would make the impossibility of a man holding office after January 20th without an election in which he was certified the winner under the law is the fact that trying to do so would break the republic to pieces if neither side backed down.  Does Trump care?
It's worth telling TRUMP that he can't delay the election because the more pushback he gets, the less he'll feel he can get away with.  It's not worth telling each other, in order to reassure ourselves that the monster is not real and cannot hurt us.
The thing that will decide if Trump stays in the White House or not is not the law, it's what Trump feels he can get away with. And the higher the stakes, the higher the bar will be in terms of what will stop him.
The only reform tRump supports with all of his tiny heart is reforming the U.S.S.R. For Putin!
Who is going to enforce it? The Department of Justice? They work for Trump. Bill Barr would not have looked into the matter of succession. The military? Anybody in the brass who wouldn't protect him would sooner fall on their swords than be seen to decide a US election.
Trump thinks his ‚Äúauthority‚Äù is false belief Constitution‚Äôs Article 2 means ‚ÄúI can do anything I want‚Äú because I say so.  Headline should be ‚ÄúTrump floats good reasons to vote him out of office like this delay or keeping THEM (minorities or whites low income) out of OUR suburbs.‚Äù
And both of those outcomes, for Trump, are better than losing on November 3rd, yielding power to someone who might use it against his interests, who might use a fraction of it to hold him in any way accountable or what he himself did with it.
After the scenario where Trump has some impact on the election but is still pushed out, I'm not sure what the next best scenario is. I can name the branches of fate that can follow; I cannot rank them. I cannot, nor do I believe can any living human, say which is worse.
Now, it's possible Trump still gets pushed out of office after instilling doubt as to the legitimacy of the election, in which case he can spend the rest of his life as The Real President In Exile to his fanbase, undercutting whatever is happening and staying relevant.
The sort of military commander or law enforcement agent who would topple a president for lack of legitimacy rather than regarding that as a worse nightmare scenario than the worst president... is in Donald Trump's corner. I guarantee it.
Why ever cancel when you can delay? "Free Beer Tomorrow" is a promise you never have to make good on because it's never tomorrow, it's always today. Trump understands the power of dangling something just out of reach.
We are going to have to do more then that. This isn‚Äôt going to stop when Trump wins. We have to be ready for what‚Äôs coming.
Now, even Kushner's data and the GOP internals have to show that there's a good chance Trump loses on November 3rd. Not having the election on November 3rd would eliminate that chance completely. And someone will say "Delaying is a prelude to canceling." but why ever cancel?
I know that talking about Trump like he's anything other than a flailing monkey toddler is always contentious, but he has at least one thing in common with fictional billionaire mastermind David Xanatos: he rarely attempts any course of action where he can't see profit in failing

And yet, I bet that tRump votes by mail this year again!

Forget the mail in voting.... let‚Äôs talk about a major crime!!!
Freaking tRump just loves this violence and chaos!   He is doing this to screw up the election.  Militants are causing this violence!
Even if there's some of among us who deserve Trump and Gohmert and McConnell in power... Trump and Gohmert and McConnell don't deserve that power.
I have Mary Trump's book, but took the cover off.  Couldn't have that man's face in my room.
Yes. trump is in very bad territory. I worry what will happen if he somehow got reelected. I don't trust him and hate what he is doing to U.S. and our allies. He is not to be trusted. Allies must protect themselves. Hope Biden is elected. If not, Americans may have to fight.
And however many mistakes Cuomo made or didn't, trump has made far, far more. You can also ask the meat plant workers in the midwest how well trump is dealing with covid. Over 150,000 DEAD AMERICANS because our potus is a complete and utter failure as a leader and a pres.
should I go on? And if he was honest about what he really knew when closed border to China, he wouldn't have been called racist. He should have closed ALL flights to/from ALL EU countries, too. He still downplays rate covid is exploding here. YES I BLAME TRUMP, 110%.
have been allowed to soeak teuth, CDC shld not be held back, stay in WHO, work with, not alienate allies. trump let covid loose. He still lie abt it. Still no national cohesion. And- he got intelligence last fall likely pandemic coming, did not prepare. Lies abt mask, hydroxychl
Yes- trump cld have put FEMA in charge, used war powers in Jan to make ppe and ventilators, had fema distribute so states not competing with each other and price gouging happen. Should have been national direction at outset, nit 50 states w/50 ways to deal. Fauci /Birx  should...
So Donald is moving the troops to countries that pay even less to NATO .... this is just trump being vindictive towards a country that regards him as a fucking moron.
Susan Rice: Obama admin gave Trump 'pandemic for dummies playbook'
We‚Äôre already broke thanks to Obama and Trump.
I grew up in NON SUBURBAN low income housing project at time when that was step up from unregulated slum lord housing allowed then. As (white) kid from projects I was respected not for where I came from or how much $ I had but for my character. ‚ÄúBe bothered‚Äù Trump slur just sad.
If trump is re-elected? Yes. But not if we get Biden in office.
I hope Rep Yoho is prepared to speak out about Trump comparing low income housing to a rise in crime.
They just have a lot of ballots to count. No fraud and the states that had small issues of questionable ballots they got caught and this shows how hard it is to commit fraud. Trump is so full of shit. He knows his ass is getting beat in November
Trump seems really bothered.  Do you think it's because #NobodyLikesTrump?
And yet trump still can't get it
I'm sure victims' families will sue, if they even can. It very easily could have happened to my 91 yr old grandmother in MD. Stuff of nightmares. But they also were and still are learning about covid. I was not saying Cuomo perfect- but he is at least leading.  trump has + is not
CV running rampant to begin with is trump's fault. He should have done a lit that he did not do to stop covid before started here. He sent broken medical equipment. The ship was sent but had to be used for non-cv cases.He should have mounted immediate national response. Still not
The expression is ‚Äúthere is no HELP for stupid‚Äù  Trump tweeting alien DNA &amp; demon semen along with Gohmert claiming wearing a mask (we assume he alleges correctly) actually ‚Äúgave‚Äù him COVID-19 might actually help  make people more stupid   but  I don‚Äôt think that counts as ‚ÄúHELP‚Äù
"But if I can't tag Trump in to say it's to him and I can't just leave the reply untagged, how am I supposed to leave my reply to Trump in your mentions?"  Um. Don't? Twitter, for all its faults, already provides you the ability to go scream into the void in his general direction
...and thinking "Well, it should be obvious I meant that to Trump." and being aghast when the person replies as if you told them to shut up and called them a name.  But. That's what the reply signifies.
I swear a good chunk of "Twitter's no good for conversation" comes from people not fully grokking that the reply function means that you are replying to the tweet-and-person you hit the reply button on.  Like leaving "STFU doodiehead" in reply to someone talking about Trump...

Never thought of it that way, why vote Trump when I can be a cool kid. I've just never figured out which agendas I should back. Maybe you could put out a list of which are the trendiest right now, popularity is everything.
Whooo boy you are something special  Trump really put his spell on you what an embarrassment listening to you on MSNBC and being disrespectful to Craig Melvin u give more respect 2 a racist leader &amp; it‚Äôs hard to conceive as to why...you are no Democrat..
Covid deaths are TRUMP'S fault. Complete failure to lead.
Ignorance of the Law is Just the Beginning  If knowledge is power, but the only true knowledge is knowing that you know nothing, then Trump and his supporters have discovered the secret of true power.
Here's a fun little thing to think about, if Trump looses in November ... He could very well run again in 2024  ... and PLEASE name me one Republican who has the guts, to go against Trump in another primary lmao ... good luck!! Hahaha
Typical for Trump....we can‚Äôt face the truth so it‚Äôs automatically fake news.
Lol. I like the Astros. Them, Trump, and Negan are some of the most entertaining TV heels today
tRump hasn‚Äôt given up his genius idea of treating the Coronavirus with light! Why else would he turn to a Company like Kodak, most famous for Photochemistry and Flashcubes? Maybe they could make Nano-Strobe Flashes that could be injected into the body!
In the long run it doesn't matter to them. It's helter Skelter. Once the cities have burnt they come out of their shelters and take over. Mob violence is all they want right now. Distraction, destruction and total chaos. We will beg them to help us. Trump is in their way though
The only actual response that really answered the question asked to Donald tRump was ‚ÄúPerson, Woman, Man, Camera, TV‚Äù, tRump seems incapable and/or too incoherent to answer any other inquiries!
Don't want to shock you but the desire to be right, is more important than dying for a lot of these idiots. Trump can never do or say anything they won't disagree with, except for giving them money, they always take the money.
tRump is turning the White House into his personal ‚ÄúHitler‚Äôs Bunker‚Äù and we all know how well that ended. Here‚Äôs to history repeating itself again.
Maybe some nuance actually serving all the public and the Constitution instead of serving one person Trump and one party republican will be shown after this by Barr.  But I‚Äôm not holding my breath. He was Trump‚Äôs personal lawyer today.

Bill Barr COULD NOT (wouldn‚Äôt?) comment on what would happen if Trump did not respect voters‚Äô choice November 3rd. But Barr COULD blame Obama for poor COVID-19 testing, specifically mention trouble in cities with dem but not republic mayors, &amp; run out the clock by not answering.
That's exactly why tRump doesn't want mail-in votes.
TRUMP 2020!
Let‚Äôs go trump
So is Trump ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
US officials: Russia spreading virus disinformation. Just curious if it‚Äôs the same disinformation Trump is spreading.
tRump supporter won‚Äôt admit that they made a mistake 4 years ago because THAT might make them look stupid!
üëá# of times Barr &amp; complicit GOP questioners brought up Obama‚Äôs name to try to blame him for what Trump &amp; Trump toady Barr are doing wrong now is mind numbingly obvious.  Do GOP really think insinuation &amp; misdirection that worked in 2016 will work again 2020?  Deja vu won‚Äôt work
üëáPoint is Trump was under investigation same as Clinton before 2016 Presidential election. Clinton investigation was outed by FBI but not Trump‚Äôs. Why? Obama insisted to McConnell that ‚Äúouting‚Äù Trump investigation would have to be bi-partisan. McConnell &amp; GOP simply refused ...
Ya think? Barr is giving Trump a run for his money about being most thin skinned and refusing to answer the greatest number of yes or no questions that could be easily answered yes or no.
Barr has trained all of his senses to be highly selective! He hears only what he wants to hear, tastes only the crap tRump feeds him, smells only his own nasty stink, sees only what‚Äôs on FOX news and he feels NOTHING!  He has trained his ethics and empathy in the same manor!
How does Barr justify Trump‚Äôs saying ‚ÄúI take no responsibility‚Äù for COVID-19 PPE or testing or opening up or not while through Barr himself making unsuccessful law suits  to ‚Äúliberate‚Äù Michigan and Virginia. Barr‚Äôs ‚Äúnarrow focus‚Äù excuse seems to ‚Äúnarrow‚Äù only to democratic states
New story on NPR: Twitter Restricts Donald Trump Jr.'s Account Over COVID-19 Misinformation
More like Roy Cohn fast &amp; loose with the law for fear mongerer Joe McCarthy before he was lawyer for fear mongering Donald Trump. Cohn disbarred for forging a document. Barr should be disbarred for deliberately misreprenting facts &amp; law. His ‚Äúethics‚Äù are being investigated now.
That might cause another Toddler tRump Temper Tantrum on Twitter!
Donald tRump
... at Church where Trump took his photo op at expense of gassing everybody in Lafayette Park w/o warning to clear his way were themselves driven away by the gas. Did Barr know (or care) that as part of faux ‚Äúplanning‚Äù he is praising they or church officials weren‚Äôt forewarned?
There are many ways in which Trump and his cronies would be incompetent when it comes to normal governance, effective governance, but this studied ignorance is NOT incompetence. It is a competently executed strategy for getting away with murder.
This has been a response to outright crimes Trump committed: "Well, he doesn't know how we do things, he's not a politician."
We have to be aware that there is a strategy to very carefully not knowing these things. If a lawmaker flat out explained to him what the law said, his answer would still be "Well, I'd have to look into that."  Trump's admin has heavily leveraged the theory ignorance is an excuse
Well, tRump did recommend drinking disinfectant and the disinfectant I would chose would be any with the word Bourbon on the label!   I recommend that you drink enough to make it through to November but not so very, very much that tRump starts making sense to you!
... one sided images of injured protestors without showing police injured also have worked for dems?   I think not.  So why does it work for, why is it being used by, Trump and complicit GOP?
... to counter one sided falsely stereotyping ALL protestors as violent? We‚Äôll never know because Jordan did not follow rules. Is alleged ( non-existent ) ‚Äúspying‚Äù on Trump and rest of Jim Jordan‚Äôs Trump campaign infomercial appropriate. I don‚Äôt think so any more than Barr as ...
Barr (after legal 1A peaceful protestors tear gassed w/o warning to clear Lafayette Park for Trump Bible photo op)  Barr: ‚ÄúTear gas‚Äù ‚Äúchemical‚Äù would have burned potestors‚Äô eyes gas but pepper spray used ‚Äúorganic‚Äù= not burn?  ... indicts himself=tear gas used=why make excuses?
guess what... it's their platform. Don't like it? Leave and make your own echo chamber for all you morons to yell at each other. Leave the science and truth for the grown ups. Anything that says "Trump" on it is inherently tainted.  Can't wait to see all the lawsuits!! #98days
Probably due to it being used for non approved purposes. Trials have shown it has little to no effect on Covid-19. And it sole popularity is because Corruptor in Cheat trump made some stuff up and his loyal morons are it up.
nobody gives a damn!! So you Whitehouse aides just forget it!! It would be as hollow as  funeral!!
What Trump did was not only raise prices on prescription drugs but also reduce availability of drugs. He‚Äôs trying to run our country through executive order like a dictator. Our system wasn‚Äôt designed for this and will lead to total destruction and authoritarianism
Remember when Donald got elected and he decided that he didn't have to divest because he would do politics and Junior would do business and they would keep it all separate?  Junior engaging in electoral politics is illegal. It means Trump lied to you and me, for corrupt purposes.
I think I remember the words to ‚ÄúThe Time Warp‚Äù  It's astounding, tRump is tweeting Madness from that orange troll But listen closely, it‚Äôs not for very much longer We‚Äôve  got to take control! It‚Äôs just a jump to the left No more steps to the right!
Trump failed to serve that flag by hiding behind imaginary bone spurs üòÇüòÇJust the fact that you‚Äôre saying, ‚ÄúTrump is saying‚Äù means we‚Äôre off to a bad start. He votes absentee so that makes absentee ok.
Trump‚Äôs stupidity slip been showing since the 80s.

No. It‚Äôs the Trump virus. There is a direct line from Trump to Herman Cain‚Äôs death. Not just his mismanagement of the pandemic, but also his stupid Tulsa - loyalty test - don‚Äôt-wear-a-mask - death cult rally.
DHS seizes mail in ballots due to fraud. Trump declares victory based on in person vote. Mail in ballots from key precincts in swing states disappear. Barr bars feds from testifying or producing the ballots. Trump judges dismiss suits - vote counting is a political question.
Expecting a much needed opportunity to forget Eric Trump.
There are risks. That said there is no one stopping a doctor from ordering it. The outrage is people think we‚Äôre holding on to a cure because of...Trump??? You‚Äôre allowed to take it, there just needs to be an honest conversation about it‚Äôs effectiveness
Except Trump is fooling around with controlling delays in Post Office
They are a joke just like Trump is a joke
Herman Cain once ran for president as a Republican. A black Trump supporter, refused to wear a mask. He died from Covid 19! Don‚Äôt be like Herman Cain wear a mask!
Better late than never but Trump has not changed since the day he ran for office and certainly not since he flaunted conflict of interest violations immediately upon his inauguration.
Only Trump would turn a pandemic into a political weapon.  is despicable.
So what? You might want to sit down for this... Republican doesn‚Äôt equal Trump.
As a joke, my kids bought me a bunch of hand-held signs saying NO (my default response). I told them I would plant them in the front yard to show my opinion of Trump and Biden.
Gotta do better ‚Å¶
I mean Roberts clearly is not a fan of Trump on a personal level and doesn‚Äôt owe him anything
Trump should be sued the most
Five states currently conduct all elections entirely by mail: Colorado, Hawaii, Oregon, Washington, and Utah. Last time I checked, those votes count in elections. Hell, Trump did mail-in voting the last election. Was that fraud? They have zero evidence!

It's it too much to ask the parties to switch tickets to Pence-Trump and Anyone But Biden-Biden?
Trump &amp; the rabidly anti-science wing of the GOP are causing carnage in the GOP. They are literally leading everyday Republicans to their deaths.  Remember death panels? Used to be, Republicans were against Presidents whom they claimed made decisions that would kill them.

I think they‚Äôve already chosen Trump. It will take a few generations to dilute the Trump gene from dominance over the Republican Party. Even then it might periodically re-emerge.
they made it illegal because it had not passed the FDA trials. duh.  who cares what the Orange man says, he just talks endlessly about nothing.  they are doctors and must do the right thing. trumpers only care about making trump right.
It had to be the tough for him being First Black Prrsident Give him some slack We went backwards to KKK with Trump

every fact based institution hates trump btw. but it is good news, not a cure, or a great impact, but good news.
Remember that Trump and the republicans will do everything possible to steal the election.
Trump Can't Postpone The Election, But He Can Delegitimize The Results.
Hey, Trump:  Your buddy Ben "Pizza! Pizza!" Cain died of COVID.  Where's your statement?  Are you such a monster you won't even acknowledge the death of your own supporter?
Black lives matter unless you like trump üòâ
Now let‚Äôs talk about the 200 Trump judges, many of whom are unqualified for the job‚Ä¶ That‚Äôs what happens when you don‚Äôt have a filibuster!
Trump Floats Delaying The Election. It Would Require A Change In Law
if it is a "cure" how does it not work on "some" people. that is stupid.  how do you not know it isn't the aspirin or the zinc or the antibiotics or the other stuff they get. i see, it only works on trumpers.  yeah, ok. trump lies, it is a fact.
Biggest GDP drop in recorded American history.   Thanks, Trump!
I think it would be a disastrous error! Look what happened when the Democrats got rid of the judicial filibuster‚Ä¶ We have a legacy of 200 Trump judges many of whom are totally unqualified for the job. Wouldn‚Äôt have happened with 60 votes needed!
Trump is only responsible for the impact of his bluster on his own reputation.  John Lewis realized that being inside was most effective, joining many others, like my old boss, Marion Barry, in doing so. He follows many into the eternal SNCC meeting, but there are some left.
On unions, undoing years of bad leadership at DOL is essential, as are tax rates on the rich high enough so that union busting is not an attractive option.  If Krugman thinks that Trump had the power or ability to mess up the SARS2 response on his own, he overestimates Trump.
Just finished listening to the speeches of President Clinton, President Bush, and President Obama. Man do I miss when our leaders weren't dipshits and bending over for Putin.  Voting Trump out can't come any faster
Obama, eulogizing John Lewis, takes aim at Trump over voting rights, protest response
it's this easy to bait a trump
R.I.P. Herman Cain BTW President Trump, Congressman &amp; civil rights leader John Lewis' funeral was today. Why aren't you tweeting about that? Why weren't you at the service? Presidents Clinton, Bush 43, and Obama attended. Your absence affirms you are a petty man. #JohnLewisRIP
Nice to see Trump tweet fond memories of  one of "his" African Americans
A just cause which will make Trump fur√¨ous, but a check on authoritarianism.
Lewis did not recognize Trump as President. Obama used the platform to continue racism, the country needs renewal.  He used the occasion for campaigning against Trump. Please call that asshole out. He had 8 years to better this country and failed!
It continues  to amaze me how our nation could go from Obama to Trump.  WTF happened? I really fear for our country.
Will never happen. Trump does this for attention. Media reports it for ratings.
While everyone telling us to not worry about how he cant follow through on his stupid tweet from this morning, its probably worthwhile to mention what Trump is doing to to make a mess of election (see USPS). Its consistent with tweet that hes at least scared of outcome
A few thoughts as I read ‚Å¶ essay in the Times. Emmett Till was a year younger than Lewis. Lynchings aren‚Äôt ancient history. The fight for voting rights is now, today. And I don‚Äôt care what Trump thinks about anything.  | CTV News
Unfortunately, while we would all love to see progress on the issues raised by Obama, doing away with the legislative filibuster will lead to more of what we were experiencing in this presidency, not less. Remember 200 Trump judges, many of whom are unsuited for the job!
Democrats are singularly responsible for all 200 of Trump way right wing, in many cases unqualified, conservative judges. That‚Äôs a legacy that will last past my lifetime!
Trump ain't got no shame.
While yall praise dancing, reminiscing, and missing Obama after his speech, remember that our current president can memorize and recite five words. Do not lose site of the "real" impressive things that explain why Trump is president today.
Reminder #4080 that Trump is a garbage of a human being.
It‚Äôs not up to you, Mr. President. Safe and secure elections are the cornerstone of our democracy. Nobody -- not even the President of the United States -- can change that.
Trump's presidency is a joke, but we all suffer it!
One of two things is true about Herman Cain: he was infected by people not wearing masks at the Trump rally, or he was already positive and infected other people because he didn't wear a mask. So he was either murdered or he is a murderer. Also, his pizza sucked.
As is your view that Trump's "deals" were good for trade.
Pol Pot did it on purpose. Trump did it through sheer ignorance and incompetence.
Let's call it absentee voting so Trump and the Repubs don't whine and complain and call it fraud.  Who am I kidding, they'll try anyway, but we might as well make it harder, since they will be calling how they vote absentee voting.
Something ‚ÄúDonald Jerk Trump‚Äù is very good  at (DEREGULATES )any and everything that Obama did . Bet Obama didn‚Äôt paid someone to pass his SATS ?
Black women I‚Äôve been following have been talking about this since the day Trump was elected. It‚Äôs part of why I openly weeped that day. I knew this type of shit would happen and Black women have been telling us from the beginning.
Congressional leaders and the White House are set to enter yet another round of negotiations for the fifth #COVID19 emergency stimulus funding as there seems to be no proper consensus.
Whether he got the virus at Trump's rally (likely) or somewhere  else doesn't matter. The fact is that he wasn't following medical advice and was refusing to social distance and wear a mask. He gambled with his own life to "own the libs" and lost.
#HermanCain scoffed at wearing masks Went to a Trump rally Caught the rona Dead.  #EverythingTrumpTouchesDies
Trump doesn‚Äôt have the authority to change election date alone. I don't know what's worse, having a President who wants to do this or having a President that doesn‚Äôt know he can‚Äôt do it by himself.
Trump should just pardon Flynn now.  This is beyond ridiculous.
Hahaha! Good one! It's not like the economy tanked, millions are sick and over 150,000+ are dead. Oh and this Trump guy is undermining the legitimacy of our election.  Nah. What we need is a good joke! Amirite  #MailInBallots
Problem is media isnt putting tweets in context. Trump tweet seems to represents a larger issue that he is nervous and worried about election and his attempts to slow USPS service speaks to that. Rather than clutch pearls over tweet, report that it speaks to a larger problem

If Cain ever won that election, there‚Äôs no way we get Trump as president.
Really Amy? No I'm fact he went to a Trump rally a week before going to the hospital where he spent his final days.
What does trump have to do for these so called GOP leaders to do anything to preserve our democracy?
In order to obtain political power in the Senate, Democrats are forced to compete in red states. It explains why Democrats are in the minority right now even with 9 senators from states Trump won, including from very red states like Alabama, Montana, and West Virginia.
He showed more humanity in those few minutes than trump,has in over three years.
But if you are are trump supporter chances are good you are a covidiot. And you might even die.
Only Trump's presidency could redeem W's.
Trump will explain that he was only speaking as a private citizen ‚Äî using  instead of   ‚Äî and as a ‚Äúprivate citizen‚Äù he can say whatever he wants.
Really for Trump. Idk what goes thru these ppls heads. Death was truly preventable.
Looks like poor #HermanCain‚Äôs ‚Äú9-9-9‚Äù plan was upside down, and its author called him home. But seriously, folks? Supporting Trump kills-and it doesn‚Äôt always kill his opponents! See also #LouieGohmert #TrumpIsACompleteFailure #TrumpOwnsEveryDeath #COVIDIOTS #GOPBetrayedAmerica
I have major issues with THIS being your response. They didn't because they legally couldn't. BUT, Lincoln did suspend habeas corpus, which also shouldn't have been legal but he did it. Like Trump could (low prob but COULD) with the election. Don't concede it's even an option.

This one is directly linked to Trump--&gt; Herman Cain, former Republican presidential hopeful, has died of coronavirus, his website says
So disengage with America began:  Right after Trump declared "America First"; made visas more difficult for everyone; tried to renegotiate every all trade deals; and made all foreigners from anywhere feel less welcome in America.
"It's unclear how Cain contracted COVID-19. He tested positive [for covid] days after attending a campaign rally for President Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Cain (...) tweeted out a photo of himself at the rally where neither he, nor those surrounding him, were wearing masks."
Let's be clear: Herman Cain died because he attended a Trump rally/was around Trump people without a mask, caught COVID, and because it is very bad for those over 65, he died. Drilled down:  and the #MAGA morons killed Herman Cain.
Herman Cain, who attended Trump‚Äôs Tulsa rally, dies of COVID 19.
Herman Cain would‚Äôve made a much better president than Donald Trump. #rip
Herman Cain contracted COVID-19 after attending the Trump Rally in Tulsa - the one where they removed the ‚Äúwear a mask‚Äù signs. Shit‚Äôs real now, Republicans.
So? Do you think Trump will think about this and it will change anything? Probably not.
Obama Unleashes on Trump Privately as He Raises $24 Million for Biden
Everything Trump touches dies. Today, Herman Cain just learned that lesson the hard way.
Well it still is satisfying. But I agree, nothing on twitter will change the #Trump followers.  They already are twisted.
If Trump loses in November (I‚Äôm far from convinced he will though) he will 100% do everything he can to fight the verdict and, if he is forced out of office, will incite violence in his supporters.   There is zero doubt in my mind about this. Buckle up y‚Äôall.
See attached memo....    General Milley has a history of regarding the US Constitution as the highest authority as do others.
also if you support trump you have cognitive dissonance considering how poorly he has handled covid. You can't support someone who has handled a pandemic poorly, then use the poorly handled pandemic to supress speech. Pick a side
Convenient, as he suggests delaying the election...I hope everyone sees what's going on with Trump's soldiers in major cities.
The U.S economy suffered the worst contraction in history under trump so he wants to delay the election? What a strange coincidence. #FailForceOne
Let's vote trump out now! Why wait until November?
Yes, lets vote trump's ass out now! Move the election up!
No, it is the do nothing Trump‚Äôs Pandemic!!!
Ugliest GDP report in recent history. Investment down by 1/2 in Q2; economy contracted by 1/3. A labor market in stall mode.  GOP Senate can't agree on another Covid economic package while Trump tweets about the election.  The nation is burning. They don't care. #coronavirus
Whenever people have said that Trump isn‚Äôt authoritarian, I‚Äôve tried to tell them that democracy isn‚Äôt typically destroyed in one day. The recent trend is destroying democratic norms, undermining democratic institutions‚Äîand then canceling or delaying or stealing an election.
Everyone who woke up after a 3-year nap: Trump doesn‚Äôt hVe the power to do that it would require complete cooperation by the Senate and the Democrats would have to roll over and...
Really? All the mailmen are democrats? How would they know who you voted for?  Trump's logic is: the election is rigged, unless I win.
Trump campaign response in April, in response to Biden saying Trump will try to delay election.
The economy has collapsed because of Trump‚Äôs impotence.
Nothing but noise...his primary focus is golfing, the new &amp; Twitter. No wonder our pandemic is amongst the worst in the world, much to our own embarrassment.  Lack of a Federal response has made this the Trump epidemic!
How can kids go to school and businesses reopen if conditions are so bad the election must be delayed? Trump is literally planning a coup - what will Senate GOP do since only Congress can change election day? Will they hold hearings or let this tweet trial balloon float away?
News of Trump trying to break up postal service operations to potentially make vote by mail harder, should be the real sign of Trump‚Äôs intentions to create chaos around election. The tweet is just spitballing nonsense.
And another pundit hoisted by his own petard.  Aw,  - you are just one in a long line of wrong pundits. So sorry you stuck with Trump and got duped.
Trump is floating the idea of delaying the November election which is a power granted to Congress. #TrumpIsUnwell
Bigger news from Trump‚Äôs tweet about ‚Äúpostponing‚Äù election is it confirms his actions against USPS to make vote by mail a mess.  Trump too dumb to be playing chess here. He‚Äôs throwing shit against wall and compromising USPS is one act he can pull off to create chaos in November
Thank you sir! I‚Äôm so happy that you will be using less of our tax money to fund your adderall addiction. More money for you to spend on golf at Trump courses!
Putin knows what he did. Trump knows what Putin did. Putin knows that Trump knows.  If Trump calls him on it, Putin will simply deny it.  Now, what is the use of that?  Trump needs to act on it.  I'm waiting.
Whether witnesses provided the same information already is a secret. We could be closer to an indictment than Trump thinks. Whether he is prosecuted sooner or later is not as relevant as the fact that he cannot pardon his kids.

Trump floats idea of delaying the November election, a power granted to Congress, as he ramps up attacks on voting‚Ä¶ #TrumpMustGo
This falls in line with Trump looking to break USPS operations. Republicans way of governing is to break and limit services and scream how their actions to purposely compromise said agencies, ‚Äúproves‚Äù that government doesn‚Äôt work. This is what plan with mail voting
"It‚Äôs not just Texas oil that the radical Democrats want to destroy. They want to destroy our country. These people are sick. They are sick."   gets it.
It‚Äôs more than a grave error; it‚Äôs irresponsible &amp; contrary to U.S. geopolitical interests. But then trump has never had our interests at heart, chomping away at ‚Äúthey don‚Äôt pay us enough‚Äù charade.
Of course. Navarro will lose a bundle on his stash of hydroxychloroquine. He and Trump would rather people die than lose money on a phony cure that they promoted in the first place.
Biggest concerns re power transfer are 1)No election (Trump just tweeted re delay election over mail voting) 2) Successful Supreme Court contest of election results a la 2000 3)Contest results successfully enough to prevent seating new Congress Otherwise he's out &amp; gov transfers.
Thank you sir!  All mail should be halted immediately.  I will just drop off the taxes I owe the IRS directly to the Trump Turnberry in person without a mask.  Save some time, buy my POTUS a few rounds of golf on his own course, and own the libs at the same time!

The presidency, as opposed to the person of the president, does not reside in the White House building. So if Trump refuses to leave the White House, that doesn't mean he's still the President. What's important is if the *powers* of the president are transferred w/ oath of office
my favourite was the trump_owo bot replying to this tweet. but seriously....why is trump? (and i do mean 'why is trump?')
If you watched House of Cards absolutely nothing in the last 4 years would come as surprise. In fact it‚Äôs even clearer to see the evil plan w/ greater clarity. The terror campaign, misinformation, manipulating bureaucracy and elections. Working with Russia! Trump def did
Can we re-frame vote by mail as absentee voting? Trump wants to say absentee voting is fine, but vote by mail is fraudulent, even tho they're essentially the same. We should make his attempts to steal the election via word games as hard as possible.
Let's reframe this as absentee voting, which Repubs purport to accept, instead of mail-in voting, which they claim is bogus.  I know, I know, potato potahto, but we might as well make Trump's attempts to steal the election as hard as possible.
There are specifics to the prior rule I might object to, but Trump objects to the principle.  BTW: It is wrong for Trump to characterize his policy as "letting the market decide".  He wants local zoning against affordable housing to override the market.

Is that the Honduras flag ?i worked there for 4 years , lovely people but very corrupt government, a dictator supported by Trump and his administration.
Zeke, assuming Trump as a rational actor on any issue is itself irrational.
Lol,  You at least I can't accuse of being GRU.  I don't think any of the Russians encouraging America to suicide by reelecting Trump are pretending to be from Chile.  So thank you for your sincere comment, I just disagree.
because trump is talking?
rather than what he's saying he's going to do. In most cases, it's the exact opposite.  Again, thanks for being civil and please look out for yourself and your family. It doesn't matter that you support Trump I'm still concerned for you &amp; others. Be well, friend and stay safe.üå∫

Right about now, nothing that Trump does would surprise me. But what is the counter to that move?
That‚Äôs almost exactly how Trump performed in TN-01 in 2016, which he won by 57%. Hillary Clinton did extremely poorly here, getting only 19.7% of the vote. Not even native Tennessean Al Gore could break 40% as a Democrat when he ran for president in 2000.
It never came to fruition, but if it had, Franklin would be one of the least populous and most Republican states in America.  found that if Franklin existed in 2016 it would have had a population of 876,797 (3 EVs) and Trump would‚Äôve won it by a massive 56%.

Trump killed Herman Cain by failing to provide to the medical community the resources they needed to respond to the crisis. Trump killed Herman Cain by refusing to accept any responsibility for the pandemic even though he is head of state.
Trump killed Herman Cain by holding an indoor rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma where masks were not required and ridiculed. Trump killed Herman Cain by not establishing a regimen of testing, tracing, and isolation that exists in every country that has succeeded in flattening the curve.
Trump killed Herman Cain by saying that the COVID-19 would just disappear. Trump killed Herman Cain by ignoring and discrediting the science. Trump killed Herman Cain by politicizing wearing a mask. Trump killed Herman Cain by refusing to wear a mask himself.
Trump killed Herman Cain by deciding to not accept support from the World Health Organization for testing kits. Trump killed Herman Cain by allowing people from Europe to come into the country without testing.
How did Donald Trump kill Herman Cain? Let me count the ways. Trump killed Herman Cain by dismissing the Obama administration's pandemic task force. Trump killed Herman Cain by ignoring the early reports of the disease. 1/

All in all, this is a lot of doomsaying and blowing scenarios wildly out of proportion.  WHICH IS EXACTLY WHAT TRUMP WANTS. Don't fall for the scare tactics so easily. Wise up and be vigilant, because he's gonna be trying some dirty shit come November.
Trump's promised a lot, but he won't promise a vaccine, because that runs against his current mentality that everything is fine. If he confuses people into there being a vaccine only because of him, it'll be a small chunk he may convince. Possible? Yes. Effective? It depends.
Trump can try all he wants to start a "civil war" but it's already failed. Portland was his litmus test, and the goons have been driven out of town on a legal basis. They moved elsewhere, but expect them to be driven out sooner or later. People are already wise to the game.

In other words, universal mail-in voting is basically already happening, and there is nothing Trump can do about it besides to try to sow the seeds of doubt.
Let‚Äôs have tRump give a eulogy of Herman Cain. I want to watch that.
Which is more annoying on Twitter, Trump Supporters or Browns Fans
Bet Trump gets his release.  PR stunt nothing more.
Indeed, they are. Kick him out, already. Enough!   The Federalist Society's Steven Calabresi, a onetime Trump supporter, now says he should be impeached for suggesting a delay in the election.  via
I agree
As much as you believe Trump understands you and is working to protect your interests. I'm as jaded as anyone about politicians on both sides of the aisle. People may disagree with Obama's policies, but he's always been pretty transparent about his motives (for a politician)
A fellow that lost his magic wand and was found by President Trump.
The majic wand comment comes to mind. I guess President Trump found it and there mad as hell and will do anything and say anything to stop more majic from happening.
I‚Äôm a little surprised Trump/the White House has not said anything because from what I‚Äôve heard, he‚Äôs done a bit to help combat it. But I guess he was preoccupied with the whole ‚Äúpushing out the election thing today‚Äù üòë
A shift to mail voting is increasing the chances that Americans will not know the winner of November‚Äôs presidential race on election night. But that doesn‚Äôt mean the results will be flawed or fraudulent, as President Donald Trump suggested on Thursday.
There is an alternate universe out there where Trump immediately mandated masks, and Nancy Pelosi calls them a form of tyranny.
is a fraud. This dude claims he is against police brutality and for the victims but won‚Äôt go hard after the very person giving the orders for protesters to be beaten. Blames everyone but Trump. Sound suspicious.
Them: Go out and vote in November. Also them: Don‚Äôt vote for Trump, Biden, Kanye or nobody else on the ballet ü•¥
üëã I am a mom and the last thing I want is for kids to die from #COVID. Any loss of children is unacceptable. Children &amp; extended family will die without a national testing strategy in place. So while I would like for my children in school, it is quite clear that Trump has failed
ah neat, hockey is now officially the sport of Trump supporters, apparently
Trump sure isn‚Äôt making us feel safe now. What is he planning on changing? Yeah, right.
Trump Has No Power to Delay the 2020 Election
I‚Äôm sure you will spend time explaining this - it is a stat negative towards the President. Do you ever explain the COVID stats that are misleading and if explained would not look so negative ? Nope.
No they want the takeover to go in another direction w/out Trump.
Whats wrong with trump , i think hes doing the best he can. Foreal tho why dont you like him
this is the guy that smuggled classified material "Into" the White House. He had access because he was Chair of the House Intel and he wanted to keep his buddy Trump appraised of the Mueller Report.
‚ÄúAs a loyal follower, every joke about rape, feminism, black people, death and anything in between was cool...BUT NOT saying ANYTHING about Trump‚Äù y‚Äôall clowns lmao
Trump literally suggested the election shouldn‚Äôt happen yet
Forget an apology, sir.  Action is needed. You, and every single Republican on the hill, need to speak in one voice and condemn the balloon Mr. Trump just floated about delaying the election.    It's time for you to stand with the Federalist Society and say, "Not on my watch."
Trump is scared. He knows his time is running short.
Sad sack got owned by Trump again
Under Trump there have been 150,000 Covid deaths, a 26 Trillion dollar debt, 11% unemployment,  and riots in the streets as he sends in Federal Troops.  I like the line where the Generals told him they where out of Bullets..
I have to say that the Republican pushback against Trump on the election tweet is a little bit better than I expected, which is good.
Yes, Mr. President! We will!!! Thank you!!!!
Our great President is the Master!
Of course. Anyone who loves  knew this 12 hours ago.
You really think the American people are stupid??! Did you even put the Hero‚Äôs act on the floor??? No, you adjourned the senate until Monday with NOTHING accomplished. The senate is a graveyard and (Trump) Republicans are TRASH!!
Sorry, Brett, your bias is evident.
Buffoon/not-knowing-the-law Trump stories don't hurt him. His incompetence with the economy does hurt him.  And which is getting the press? The one that will be forgotten. And what's already forgotten? The story that will hurt him most in the fall.
Numerous studies have shown that all forms of voting fraud are very rare in the United States. A panel that Trump established to investigate election corruption was disbanded in 2018 after it found no real evidence of fraud. ‚Å¶
This is classic Trump, and everyone fell for it again...  The economy shrank by 1/3, more than 3x worse than any other quarter in history.  But a few minutes before that story breaks, he puts this out. Now, that's all everyone is talking about for 24 hours...
Here‚Äôs an idea. You support trump‚Äôs proposal to postpone the election? Don‚Äôt vote on Election Day. That‚Äôll show ‚Äòem. #DumpTrump2020
Fascinating piece on how Trump‚Äôs election Tweet today is emblematic of his entire career: When he‚Äôs about to lose big, turn over the chess board and destroy the pieces.
If Donald Trump cancels the election,  will be the 12th District Councilman forever!
Amazing  want to only propagate one narrative, Theirs! President Trump should reclaim his time that D‚Äôs have wasted over the last 4yrs. D‚Äôs can blindly choose what they see &amp; hear, or not. D‚Äôs are spoiled children, nothing more
You have no authority to do this. It must pass BOTH the House and the Senate.  Even your buddies see the insanity in this.
Just follow  instead of Trump
No way trump the election will not be delaying I knew you were up to no good just like that you want to change the constitution what you did not do in almost four years delaying it would not make a difference so that is not going to happen you should leave now
He should just say don't go to a trump rally
I love when Wale calls Trump ‚Äúgirl‚Äù lol üò©
I would vote for Mickey mouse vs trump. He's the reason I'm no longer Republican. He's a scumbag who changed a whole party to cover for a scumbag. Get your parties ideals back... then come back and talk to me.
Trump had a campaign rally where he bragged about his upcoming third term and fourth term.  Term. Not year, TERM.  Everybody saw this coming.  They all saw Hitler coming, too, but decided that was ridiculous and it would all blow over and the crazy Nazis would go away.
Great thread!  I fear the answer to you last question is a resounding NO. I also fear how this will send people over the edge; the potential carnage in the streets that trump so thrillingly spoke of at that weird ass ‚Äúinauguration‚Äù speech.
FDA should have make HCQ more accessible to the public earlier. CDC should have given guides on wearing masks earlier. President Trump just finished the ugly IMPEACHMENT in Feb. He banned China flight early but the left whined as usual.
So Kayleigh, how does it feel to know that you've sold your soul to the devil? My, my how quickly you changed your opinion on trump. We view you as a liar and a fool now. I bet your family is so proud of you.
Move up the election and get rid of Trump now.
Since you seem to be so well-versed in ‚Äúgeneral themes,‚Äù what pray tell is Trump‚Äôs? I mean, if AOC‚Äôs tweet makes you this cantankerous, I can‚Äôt BEGIN to imagine how our imbecile president‚Äôs Twitter musings make you feel.
Caught at a thing called Trump‚Äôs Tulsa rally.
Opinion tweet: I‚Äôm convinced Russia not only hacked DNC servers, but GOP servers as well. The metadata obtained by Russia was weaponized  as compromised dossiers for literally all of the GOP. I believe this is the basis for the trump sychopant army!
Biden's there because of  epic incompetence in containing the #COVID19Pandemic.  Trump is the #WorstPresidentInHistory.
Well, no. If Trump and Pence resigned today, it would be Pelosi. But if the election were postponed, every member of the House and 35 Senators would leave office.
#RIPHermanCain and 155K others killed by the #TrumpVirus. You had better understand that Donald Trump is 100% responsible for Herman Cain's passing from #COVID19.  Trump denied that the virus was coming, seized PPE ordered by States, and suggested injecting bleach as a cure.
The federalist said this about Trump.   The one place that has always thought Dems would try to do whatever to Trump. Finally gets it. Hopefully one day you will too and look back and think about what was done to Americans by a president
There‚Äôs a good argument for her - in terms of how well she gets along with Biden- and that she will be helpful with her understanding of executive branch- she can help rebuild all our agencies that trump has dismantled
Thanks for that. My mind is medical so with Covid I started looking for others thoughts. Then Trump decided to make medicine politics and all I knew was I could not stand him. So I‚Äôve learned a lot and hate him more daily.
Trump Pressed On Russian Bounty Intel | Morning Joe | MSNBC  via
Cuomo delayed action and then fought De Blasio to reopen NYC prematurely, getting a shit ton of people killed and had the stones to release this ridiculous propaganda poster. That guy has is no teacher. He's a more PC version of Trump.
Trump‚Äôs absolute lack of trustworthiness profiled early in his administration by the FBI, who feared him getting hold of evidence and hiding or destroying it, but vanishing it. This straight off in this term in office.
You shouldn't be allowed to use the great Lou Whitaker's name when you are a Trump fan.  What the hell is wrong with you?
Give me a break! I‚Äôm a mom. I want my kids SAFE. I want my kids ALIVE. Stuff it. I‚Äôll take Biden over Trump any day.
Oh dear I don't think the county can stand one extra moment of Trump. Btw have you been social distancing ...COVID
So back when Hogan was reelected I asked my boss why he voted for him given that he hadn't done a good job. He didn't really have anything to point to.  didn't vote for trump in 2016. But might vote for him now? Why? Someone should ask
Thursday, in Trump's America
Particularly when you run a vile right wing org that fertilized the ground for ineffective gov‚Äôt, planted the maga seeds &amp; did everything it could to ensure trump flourished when he became president.
I am not defending trump for his actions on the virus. I was saying that I believe his nickname for the coronavirus is right, because their government should be ashamed of letting out a killer virus
So here‚Äôs a scenario. He ‚Äòtries‚Äô to stop elections using DHS and unregulated militias to disrupt voting in blue centers of swing states. He‚Äôs sued. SCOTUS says the election can only be moved by congress and wasn‚Äôt - so the election Trump ‚Äòwon‚Äô was valid. Impeachment only option.
I agree. But trump will scream socialism and some ignorant Americans will fall for it
Why, because you don't want to directly communicate with the people? President Trump has communicated more directly with the people than any President in my lifetime. I have seen 1st hand the lies told by the media and they have lost my trust.
This was the straw that broke the camels back?? I call BS!! The Trump administration has done so.much damage that he approved of so this doesn't make sense.
You know what? I watched the George W. Bush speech at John Lewis‚Äô funeral, and it was beautiful and moving. I know it is uncool to say this, but I really do believe there is value in basic human decency in a President.   I also think Trump is now worse than Bush was policy-wise.
We would be out of this Covid mess if people would have just stayed home for a few weeks.   It's all the Trump Red states messing it up for everyone else.
Lotta people on here got a very media spin view on what trump supporters believe. I doubt most of you have sat through a long decent conversation about their views. You'll find that you might agree on alot, even if not for the same reason. You're views might not be so different.
Did you look at Dow Jones today?  HaHaHa! Your party has the blood of Covid death in your hand! Cuomo &amp; Blasio did nothing about Covid and let NYC become the hot spot. You banned HCQ b/c it's so cheap and b/c TRUMP promoted it.
I never closed the door on them I just didnt think Trump would be that blatant with it brah
So this is your line... this is where you decided trump has gone to far. Might be too late, but hey, you had to discount 2 yrs of warnings as hysterical b/c your gritting buddies told you not to worry.  Such a leader. Such bravery. So principled.
Trump killed Cain by having him at a no-mask Trump rally
I wish it was possible to rob trump bitch ass
It‚Äôs crazy the people that used to block the Quad on adelbert preaching about Trump facilitating a fascist America were not exaggerating at ALL
He sorta says that: ‚ÄúUntil recently, I had taken as political hyperbole the Democrats‚Äô assertion that President Trump is a fascist.‚Äù
Imagine Trump‚Äôs reaction if Dr. Fauci was to win it this year ü§Ø
No response. Small man.. like trump! Toodles
Trump just finished the damn ugly IMPEACHMENT in February! He had to rely on CDC, NIH and FDA and all 3 have failed him and American people b/c they are corrupt LEFT bureaucracy.
Was and still is, makes Trump crazy!
And to prove that I‚Äôm not just being ad hominem, your argument is essentially the same as what Donald Trump is implying, he can stay if no one else has the job. The speakers position ends at noon on inaugural day.
If you watch the video you‚Äôll see that he didn‚Äôt vote for trump. He specifically brings up the Access Hollywood tape as one of the reasons.
If the Trump Republicans think Biden has no chance, then why not allow a complete count? Baby Huey is in until Jan 20th, regardless.
So interesting how every Republican in Washington has no idea what Trump has said, yet when Obama opens his mouth they‚Äôre first in line to condemn his words.
If the current state of America isn‚Äôt enough for you to vote against trump, I assure you if he wins, the state of America two years from now will be enough for you to regret having not
It's the very right thing to do to let U.S. citizens coming home and then quarantined. Trump just finished the ugly damn Impeachment in Feb!  You guys criticized over his decision to shut down flights from China! More ppl would have died if Biden was in charge!
üòÇüòÇthat Trump runtz with the workout got you right
Trump logic: it is simultaneously safe enough to reopen schools but also dangerous enough to delay the election. #fail #FuckTrump #logicalfailure #IllegitimatePresident
There are so many people who follow the idiot trump, it's going to get worse before it gets better.
‚ÄúAt this point Trump is simply a failed president, and everyone except his die-hard supporters knows it.‚Äù ‚Å¶
It's not Trump's fault.  It's the damn places who are getting the results.i think they are so over loaded with tests they can't keep up
No mail in go and vote red all the way !!!!! Trump 2020
I will welcome and applaud any Republican who abandons Trump publicly. We can argue later. Right now it‚Äôs about the republic, and being on the same side regarding that is all that matters.
Well thank God Trump has a history of allowing constitutionality, legality, morality and decorum to stop him from doing whatever he wants.
Think about Trump just finished the ugly damn Impeachment in Feb! The Dem is the enemy of American people!
It‚Äôs a shame really. Trump should be doing better to get rid of the virus, but that still does not excuse the fact that without the lies from the CCP the world would not be in this situation.
How many times did I hear this.     From 2015 till now. It happened and is happening. No our Constitution didn‚Äôt protect us from a monster like trump.
Trump simply cannot abide living in the shadow of a great man.
Thats Trump‚Äôs way of bull shitting in all caps
You‚Äôre absolutely wrong. Absentee- individuals request a ballot. Mail-in - the gov.  automatically sends. If you can‚Äôt see the difference, and opportunities for error and fraud, you need help.
Trump is responsible for lives lost inside of America. But the CCP is responsible for lives lost around the rest of the world
Game over. He has violated his oath of office in word &amp; deed. Respect him enough as an to believe his threats. #25thAmendmentNow  Trump Might Try to Postpone the Election. That‚Äôs Unconstitutional.
We have played this game of virtual versus actual law-breaking for over 4 years now. Trump steals a dollar and gives back 50 cents if we howl loudly. Meanwhile his sycophants say 'just kidding'.
I do not subscribe to theory that Trump's idea is off the table until Barr or Trump himself take it off. Why do pundits assume that a man as dangerously ill as Trump will not do crazy and dangerous things?
I worry about your tweets now and I‚Äôm a liberal. The right isn‚Äôt to blame for everything. Trump is not to blame for every atrocity. We have to hold people on both sides, on multiple levels accountable.

It‚Äôs the truth. The same people wanted to ru. Him out of office for wearing a beige suit, but say nothing about the egregious crimes trump commits
And you are suggesting that trump is this person?
If Putin told trump to ignore the virus, 153,000 Americans were killed without Russia declaring war.  Civilians killed without paying a bounty
Why do people so absurdly give Trump, who has unfailingly demonstrated since his youth EXACTLY who his is, endless new chances 2 b some1 he is literally incapable of being? He‚Äôd never do that for any of u unless he knew that he could use u &amp; then toss u overboard! Herman Cain.
Driving home to Ohio is always an interesting experience because all I see is a bunch of shit with the expressed purpose of pissing me off. Trump flags, blue lives matter stickers, gun worshipping stickers, an offensive depiction of Greta Thunberg on the back of a giant pickup
If Trump cancels the election, Jack Young is going to remain Mayor of Baltimore forever.
I just don't get what is it that make so many people in the political world afraid to stand up to Trump? Some of the people who I use to think were strong people i have looked at them side ways since this administration.
Yep!!! Trump card owners are having to pay to get rid of them.

Please Trump, postpone the elections!!!!       Trump Might Try to Postpone the Election. That‚Äôs Unconstitutional.
Legally yes. The President has no power to delay an election. But as we've already proven, we're apparently unwilling to do anything about it when Trump breaks the law. I think we're in for the biggest constitutional crisis in our history if the election is even remotely close.
Thanks for trump petulant berniebro

President Donald Trump‚Äôs pitch to delay the Nov. 3 presidential election ‚Äúreeks of desperation,‚Äù Democratic members of the state‚Äôs congressional delegation said Thursday.
Yes. Trump is 100% responsible for Kain's death He is just 1 of the 150k+ Americans  has murdered  All these deaths could have been prevented if we had true &amp; honest leadership in the USA
Just think about how many funerals of heroic and legendary Americans have happened over the past 4 years and Donald Trump hasn‚Äôt been invited to a single one ü•¥ü•¥ü•¥
I am not American, and I don‚Äôt agree with everything Trump does. But what I do like about him is that he says it how it is, and the facts are that China is responsible for thousands of deaths, and yes, the Chinese government should be ashamed of themselves
Ask her why newspaper editorial boards that demanded Clinton resign have remained silent on Trump?
Whether it‚Äôs #Obamagate, #birtherism, or false accusations of innocent black citizens, Trump uses social media repeatedly to mislead the American public to increase his chances of winning in November. I have reported this tweet and donated $2.00 to
Is he? He‚Äôs supposed to be the AG for the American people but has always been a Trump flunky.
Seem all people do who can‚Äôt type anything else is name call and claim others have no facts. When facts are open online and avail to all to see. Republicans,Democrats or whatever you may be.   Trump is using force on citizens. The whole reason the second amendment exists.
Trump Might Try to Postpone the Election. That‚Äôs Unconstitutional. He should be removed unless he relents.
Why Trump Might Quit - POLITICO
President Trump, look at Manhattan today. How far is this 'social experiment' of AOC's  going to go? One would think that it's more like a home grown form of Fast and Furious. Is it that they want to do away with Blacks altogether? Between abortions and killings...
Fully agree, Jason. My pick is  for VP &amp; I would love to see Susan Rice as Sec of State. However, if there really is insistence on a woman of color for VP, Rice is my top pick. Pick a VP I never heard of &amp; I'll be pissed. Then Joe gets my vote only because Trump must go.
We all may never know where HC contracted the virus...but if DT never called for a rally &amp; HC never went, &amp; HC wore a mask, we could have eliminated Trump‚Äôs failed Tulsa rally.  But now it‚Äôs still possible and probably likely that‚Äôs where he contracted it given timing. Sad waste.
I need a reporter to ask what proof does Trump have that makes mail in voting fraud and how does he know the election will be rigged. Reporters allow Trump to continue to say this without asking for proof!! DAMN IT!
I dont think it's a political statement as much as stop listening to trump before he get you killed too

There is a good dissertation to be written about how Herman Cain‚Äôs (fake) campaign paved the way for Trump‚Äôs own showman‚Äôs run for the WH. He was the first Trump, and no one would have consider DJT if HC hadn‚Äôt tried first. Also, this REALLY HAPPENED:

Trump wanting to delay the election is like a kid not wanting  to take a test they haven‚Äôt studied for.
Nothing can stop what‚Äôs coming! WWG1WGA Trump will win VERY BIG!
Just read President Obama's eulogy of John Lewis. Powerful. It's hard to remember, now, that we once had a president who was so intelligent, thoughtful, and empathetic ... all while being mocked and ridiculed by the same GOP who now fawn over and worship a POS like Trump.
Ish Kabibble!  When the Federalist Society wants Trump out that's like a Fox News political editor saying "Trump may be making a tactical error here by further telegraphing his weak position in the polls &amp; his weak position for reelection." Both happened! Thank you! Good night.
The Trump Economy. No wonder he wants to delay the election...
Have u heard Trump speak?
Yea...but send the kids back to school. Trump is a menace.
Oh that‚Äôs Trump. Let‚Äôs compare notes...hope u get Covid u nasty person!
Trump has discovered skepticism.... No that's giving him way to much credit
.‚Å¶ Thank you for being decent, kind, brilliant and competent all in one. Our country needs more leaders like you.  Obama delivers call to action in eulogy for Lewis, links Trump to racist Southern leaders who fought civil rights ‚Ä¶
I thought trump was the one who praised the great effort and transparency of China over the virus outbreak? U guys wouldn‚Äôt be trying to rewrite history would u?
Did Putin tell trump to ignore covid. Putin couldn‚Äôt have killed 153,000 Americans in a war. Now he‚Äôs killing civilians and it‚Äôs not costing Russia a dime
Oh ok. That‚Äôs why 150k ppl r dead-a man that beat stage 4cancer attends his shit rally and dies from COVID? Trump can‚Äôt even read a sentence or walk down a ramp tomcat! Joe is in control and doesn‚Äôt incite danger! Boy bye!
You‚Äôre in NY according to your bio - in WHAT universe do you think your state is going to Trump?  My vote is make sure Biden is held to account and that means 10M people to a 3rd party in safe states - BUT - those 10M would, in theory, be doubled by Biden voters in swing states.
That is not true. The only difference between the 2 is that you have to provide a reason for an absentee ballot. Every other requirement is the same. States like FL, where Trump votes, have no excuse mail in ballots, so absentee ballots don‚Äôt even exist where he votes.
This is step X of Y in the "GOP turning on Trump" scenario. That doesn't mean we will ever get to Y but this is one of steps in that direction.
He has empathy. Compassion. He‚Äôs a man spoken very highly of throughout DC. He‚Äôs actually a hero. His life is in danger. Bernie knew it and dropped out early. Trump is extremely dangerous. Biden is doing this 4us&amp;country he loves
Hear me out... if Trump doesn‚Äôt win a second term, he‚Äôd still be eligible to run again someday right? A constant looming threat... Yikes.
I regretted voting for Hillary.  Also, due to the electoral college being what it is, 35 states effectively have their votes already spoken for; mine is one of the hardest to flip. If Trump wins my state, he‚Äôs run the table, which is increasingly unlikely.
A lot of ppl. They say they r voting for him bc they aren‚Äôt for Trump and no other reason

Considering how  in 2016 didn't accept election results, do you think they will do the same in 2020 or do you think the  secede from the Union like they did in 1860? Lincoln didn't put up with it, neither should Trump.

This is a big deal. Federalist Society is a big supporter of Trump.
CAN 1 DUMBASS REPORTER ASK TRUMP WHAT PROOF DOES HE HAVE THAT THE ELECTION WILL BE RIGGED AND THAT MAIL IN BALLOTS WILL LEAD TO FRAUD???
Trump on mail in voting  "If they do this our country will be a laughing stock all over the world." Uses the word disaster over and over.  Um we ARE a laughing stock you moron. Because of YOU
The co-founder of the Federalist Society just called Trump a fascist.  I really don't know what else needs to be said.
Trump has or scientists around the world who have worked tirelessly to find a cure for the world?   So they could be the first ones to charge Americans out the arse for a vaccine because our system is set up to ensure they get rich off us.  Other countries provide it ...FREE

May He Rest In Peace... bc taking medical direction from Trump is and has been, a death sentence.
I'd invite you to come see me and we can have a talk about all this, man to man. I'd also tell those veterans to kiss my ass. If Trump loses this election then his term is over on Jan 20, 2021. That's the Constitution. That is law. If he refuses then he is a criminal.

RUSSIA Planning to Steal Election for TRUMP Through Mail-In Ballot FRAUD!! &gt;&gt; Protect Our Vote and Demand NO MAIL-IN BALLOTS!!! Please help spread the word. Biden has to win fair and square! #Biden2020
It‚Äôs even a little different in the county, though Dems generally still win 60-40 there. I also know there‚Äôs no chance AL/MS are going to go to Biden, despite Trump doing everything he can to tank this thing and get out.
. Justin Kwasa quoted in  latest Greenwire campaign update for  : "What Trump is suggesting is blatant election interference and an obvious attempt to undermine this election."
And We the People Let it Happen! Without a Fight! Just drank the Koolaid! And those that didn't &amp; spoke out or refused mandates were silenced by MSM, so-called medical experts, All politicians but Trump! He's the only one to call it what it is, A HOAX!
Three hours since Caines death announcement, and no acknowledgement by Trump.  He did acknowledge another Pizza owner (Caucasian) of course that was being, harassed for having a Trump flag on property.
Trump abruptly calling for a presser wen he knows  is speaking at #JohnLewisMemorial rite now is pure ignorance &amp; appalling. üñïtrump and I mean that sincerely. #FuckTrump
warned us you would try to put some distance between yourself &amp; this monstrous president.   We will NEVER FORGET that OVER AND OVER YOU CHOSE TRUMP.
Donald Trump‚Äôs Weak, Self-Defeating Call for Delaying the Election   #ThursdayThoughts #MailInBallots #MailInVoting #DictatorTrump #TrumpIsAFascist #VoteOutTrump #TrumpIsNotWell  #TrumpThreatensAmerica
When u start liking bush , u already know how bad trump is
I've long seen both a bit different. They tickle the part of the brain that says, "You are in fact capable of understanding this incredibly complex thing and having worthy opinions on it." It's like Trump appealing to the "common sense" thing in 2016.
In a tweet this morning, President Trump attacked voting by mail, suggesting a possible delay to the November election. This reporting from  makes it clear that he does not have the power to do that. What will you do to defend our right to #vote ?
Thank God
Nice attempt as distraction from the numbers on the economy today.  Pay attention to other news when Trump says something outrageous.  He‚Äôs trying to hide something.
Here‚Äôs how the President pushing conspiracy theories/false information on Covid endangers lives of everyday Americans.  Read my text exchange which starts after person (former Marine) sent me a video clip tweeted by Trump of Nigerian doctor saying cure for Covid was already here:
Lies runs Trump's entire presidency.

Why do such good people support an amoral criminal like Trump? That said, may he rest in peace.
Careful what you ask for. Trump is the enemy we know. Pence is the traitor hiding behind an evangelical act, even more dangerous. He's been tutoring at Trump's knee for 3 years.
Yeah he proved it but a Senate Majority threw it out due to politics. Liberals aren‚Äôt driving the paper ballots. It‚Äôs the intelligence community.  Trump won‚Äôt want to have an election where each vote is counted. He wants electronically done. So it can be manipulated
How about the governor of Oklahoma? He had more power than Trump on this.
There would certainly be some civil unrest which in a country with so many guns in private hands could be bloody. Trump is playing with fire and people‚Äôs lives
2020 standards b/c everything we have now will be worse. Flu + Covid+ cold weather/ enclosed spaces. Financial and psychological toll much worse. And even if we have election, Trump loses, and he accepts that loss, we get a 2.5 month tantrum of untethered destruction as lame duck
Trump Sparks Firestorm With Suggestion To Delay Elections - a reverse psychology move
Start noticing how the media calls him "Donald Trump" and not "President Donald Trump"? They do this on purpose. Start looking for it and call them out.
Cheeto, please. You made this crisis, remember? Your corruption &amp; lack of both compassion &amp; understanding (anything) have reached new depths. Yes, it is definitely your personality. "BBC News: Donald Trump suggests delay to 2020 US presidential election"
That was the dog whistle that called all the racists onto the trump train and they‚Äôve been riding with him ever since.   Muting you now. Have a nice day.
I could go on and on but I‚Äôm not going to waste anymore of my time on you. I‚Äôll just leave you with this. Trump rose to political prominence by promoting the conspiracy theory that the first black president was illegitimate because he wasn‚Äôt born in this country.
#BREAKING A federal appeals court will review a decision ordering the dismissal of the Justice Department‚Äôs case against former Trump national security adviser Michael Flynn.
y'all have a decision to make. Trump is going to take you down with him and cost you the Senate if you keep "supporting" him, and letting him get away with his belligerent, incoherent, anti-democracy babble. Sane Americans are FED UP with this fool.
Regis Left $20 Million to Trump Campaign
Moments like this, where three former presidents flew to Atlanta to speak at John Lewis‚Äô funeral, remind you that after Clinton, Bush and Obama pass away, plenty of people on both sides of the aisle will line up to speak. The best Trump can hope for is Scott Baio.
Trump wanna send kids back to school but you have to be tested for covid to even be in a room with him.

I'm just thankful that Trump didn't pollute this beautiful service with his presence.
How long till trump says how sad he is Clarence Thomas died.
Considering Trump has said exactly that over the last two weeks, should you update this tweet or delete it?
Back to cartoons: from just copying for my first Trump one of the lockdown, and thinking of a funny caption, to trying to draw from imagination...
Even without Trump's threat, which is basically empty, I find it so hard to convince oneself to see anything that comes next as an uncontrollable tipping point. Perhaps the fault is mine, I hope, I pray, it is. 4/4
It is true. Trump has a lot more power than the pundits think.   and  knows this, that is why they are lying and trying to make this a propaganda war.
Bill leaves us for a month, the sky falls and now Trump honestly brings up postponing the election. It‚Äôs scary how he said all this stuff would happen a year ago and some people laughed it off. No one is laughing anymore.
Please post the ‚Äúmany times and for years‚Äù that  trump who pretended like he didn‚Äôt know who David Duke was when asked about the endorsement, denounced him. How about Richard Spencer? Why aren‚Äôt they or women like this supporting Biden if he‚Äôs the real racist?
Trump has taken control of the Senate and the courts....

Scared of a landslide loss, Donald Trump Suggests Delaying U.S. Election Due To Mail-In Voting  #donaldtrump #Election2020 #RadioOnFire
I‚Äôll bet he wished that they had required masks at the Trump rally after all.
David Duke is an antisemite and assigned his own bigoted meaning to what Omar said. There‚Äôs a difference between using Omar to further his own agenda in a way that would damage her politically and endorsing trump for president.
And more importantly; there are 150 thousand dead Americans due to the trump Freakshow.
Herman signed the waiver. Trump is okay and he wishes Herman well.
Yeah sure. DONALD TRUMP IS THE WORST POTUS IN WORLD AND UNITED STATES HISTORY

Opportunity zones were a giveaway to his rich friends. The 1st step act was also bipartisan and trump starved it of funding in his last budget.
Trump signed legislation funding HBCU‚Äôs  passed by bipartisan votes in Congress. Some were just extensions of acts that were signed by other administrations. He doesn‚Äôt get a cookie for doing the bare minimum.
I've seen that a few times. It doesn't help of course that the Trump supporters are crowing all over the accessibility hashtag and generally stirring things up.  But to say it's all down to them causing trouble is ludicrous.
You should sue trump
So what happens when Trump decides not to leave at all?  Donald Trump suggests delay to 2020 US presidential election
I cannot make out what you are saying based on that word salad. Similar to when Trump speaks. Calling someone of  a pedophile is a strong accusation. I have seen video of Trump asking a 9 year old girl her age and then telling the press he is going to be dating her in 11 years.
68% of the people who answer "polls" put out by Trump's campaign that have questions like "How is Trump doing?" and the only choices are "AWESOME", "WONDERFUL" and "GREAT"...
But you are completely correct.  Don't worry tho Trump is making sure that pop.won't be around to vote! #WeWillVote

I am not amused.  Trump is not joking.  He will do anything to undermine the integrity of the election.

is such a liar! Whenever trump says something delusional they say it was joke. If it was a joke then why not write about it in a joking way. That was no joke you trump stooge.
Biden has the support of the CBC as well as the majority of black voters in the country. trump has the support of Richard Spencer, David Duke,  neo Nazis and the rest of racist white America.
This baloney about the possibility of Trump pulling the plug on himself rather than undergoing ignominious defeat just won't slice.  Unlike the model for such a move (LBJ), Trump has significant criminal exposure as soon as he walks out the door.
I thought this was Donald trump I was bout to turn my car in.
Gotta get those Trump Bucks issued to buy votes
Trump's call to "delay" the election is a distraction ‚Äî but it's also a serious threat. The man is a fascist.  #ThursdayThoughts #MailInBallots #MailInVoting #DictatorTrump #TrumpThreatensAmerica #VoteOutTrump #TrumpIsAFascist
What I truly despise is that trump daily..... daily!.....chooses our conversations for the day....80% of the stuff he says is just to steer topics. I hate that we and the news fall for it every day. He is a vile puppeteer.
"Having more options for voters who can‚Äôt make it to the polls helps prepare our states for the election this year, &amp; safeguards a more fair &amp; equitable democracy moving forward.‚Äù- Justin Kwasa on Trump's dangerous tweet. Read full statement here:
Seen and moving on. üôÇüôÇ This is where you will tell me I said Trump was right to commute Stone's sentence and that Barr is a brilliant AG abi?
So everyone publicly knows my predictions for the 2020 election.  1) There will be no election on Nov 3, 2020 2) IF there is an election, Trump will win. 3) There will be total mayhem around the world. If you think you have seen a protest, you have seen nothing yet.
Trump‚Äôs not ‚Äúpretending‚Äù at anything except doing his job. The threat to our democracy is real.
It doesn‚Äôt surprise me that you want to talk about legislation from 45 years ago instead trump‚Äôs long history of racism that spans his entire life. Your own article states that even back then that Biden was strong on civil rights.
Very sorry he has passed but what a perfect time for  to stand up to Trump like you do and say #WearAMask   Then hos death will not have been in vain.
This sounds dramatic, but I do believe that Trump is more of a threat to the entire world than Covid 19.
You‚Äôre too dumb to know you‚Äôve been played by the great  :)
Thanks for stating the exact sentiment that  , the greatest President ever, has been saying all along :)
My vote counts!  Dump tRump in November!
He would have no died had Trump not held his convention in Tulsa.
Not just any rally, a COPS FOR TRUMP rally at that
I can't wait to see the distraction Trump comes up with when the jobs numbers are released next week.
I want what's best for my country &amp; fellow Americans! I know that Biden does not share these sentiments! I believe Trump Does share these sentiments!  Plus, Trump's exposing of corruption is awesome to witness! I believe him to be more a Patriot!

Trump not attending #JohnLewisMemorial is crazy to me smh. But not surprising at all.
So when‚Äôs the next Trump rally?
Sad day. Left will barely mention his death, but say Trump was responsible.
You don‚Äôt just represent the people of Maine, Senator Collins. Your duty is to protect and defend this entire country. Please step up and denounce Trump for his horrible actions and statements, and work for  a secure election this fall. Mail works: tell people that!
Herman Cain got COVID-19 At this Trump rally, y‚Äôall better get tested for real as a matter of fact people who attended the rally also need to be tested to

Squirrel! Nut!!  GDP contracted 32% in 2nd Quarter. John Lewis is being laid to rest today, and Trump is thankfully absent.
A bad economic report gets released so Trump Tweets about delaying the election and the media eats it up. #distractions
1. Of fucking course every president has lied, you're better request is to find one that hasn't. The problem is the FEEQUENCY at which Trump lies, which hasn't been done by any president.  2. You've never voted so your opinion doesnt really matter.
Well, point I have been making. No one can tell if it would be widespread or not, uncharted territory. Sorry, I don't read WaPo but the figure flying about is a lot more than that. Even the White House report puts it around 400
He and his family might have signed one which is the cost of doing business with trump. I hope that offers cold comfort to that family.
This coming presidential election will prove that the racist minority in this country no longer hold power. This is the death knell for Trump and his ilk. #ByeDon2020 #WeAreTakingAmericaBack
I‚Äôm an independent but I agree with you completely. I didn‚Äôt vote for Trump but have been seriously considering it this time until this. Millions of our people need this help right now. It should be done already.
This guy regularly calls out Trump and TAGS HIM   He signed an NDA with Trump but he doesn't GAF. He's putting everything on the line. Willing to be sued. Willing to suffer a "mean tweet."  It's almost like YOU signed NDAs.  Your oath is to US not *him.*

Trump and the GOP along with many like minded DEMS are putting this experiment called American Democracy to the test. How will it play out? Only time will tell. Those flag waving citizens had better wake up because they might lose their liberty and justice for some.
Donald Trump has often cast absentee ballots by mail. Odd that he now thinks mail-in votes are a bad idea. Might take longer to count votes if the election is by mail, but so what? As long as we get a reliable result within a couple of weeks of the election, we‚Äôll be fine.
Yesterday Trump tweeted about keeping suburbs and cities segregated, screaming the quiet part out loud (overt racism).  Today Trump tweeted about keeping himself in power by extending the election, screaming the quiet part aloud (overt authoritarianism).
You guys have to stop with the Russia bullshit. I didn‚Äôt vote for Trump but that shit was so clearly false and political and you wasted three years of our time on it. It damages your credibility.
...like pretty much everything that Trump engages in.
Why would Trump be invited?  All he would do is show his ignorance and stupidity.

I sometimes shudder at how much of a nightmare Trump will continue to be as an ex president with a twitter account.
You mean Trump convinced. Herman followed your dear leaders advice. COVID was a Hoax!
I now think that was the purpose of Trump's tweet -- to force the media to stop over-hyping the virus.
We have been documenting and warning of Trump‚Äôs dangerous disorders for 3 years. He is a malignant narcissist experiencing organic cognitive decline. He couldn‚Äôt be more unfit and he is deteriorating #TrumpIsNotWell
Every two days the Democratic leadership in the house will spit in the faces of people dying, sick, or in need of help but once a week they'll come out to popular acclaim and rip up a speech or tell a sad story right before giving Trump/companies more tools to torture and kill us
Trump doesn‚Äôt care about anything concerning the vote other than voter suppression. He cannot win without it.
Trump wants a civil war, so...
Trump is desperate to postpone the election so he doesn't go to jail the rest of his life.

Ewwww his portrayal of trump is too spot on. I can‚Äôt believe we lived through this
Afro- Brazillians much like Black and Latinx Americans are being impacted by the pandemic much harder than their white counterparts. Both President Bolsonaro and Trump are neglecting these communities and using racism as a tool to maintain control.
How soon we forget #JohnLewis joined the 70 hate filled #Democrats who refused to go to #Trump Inauguration stoking Trump wasn't a legitimate president.  Where was his unify America legacy on that one ?
Y'all get distracted by Trump when he wants to distract you from shit...every...time.

It's probably someone forced on her by Trump. Maybe Kimberley Guilfoyle?
Trump seems not to understand that universal mail-in voting is still the same thing as absentee voting no matter how he tries to spin it.  It's like saying meat from cows is bad but beef is good.
Do everything you can to defeat Trump, stay mad, but anybody who's mad for the wrong reasons can be manipulated into situations that will make you still much madder. 5/5
while the real danger is right in front of you.  How bad was that economic report? Well, there was one detail particularly that should freeze your blood even much more than that Trump wants to cancel elections:  Almost 30 million Americans did not have enough to eat last week.3/
So guess what:  Trump can't cancel or postpone November 3rd. He can, however, say that he wants to postpone it because of the potential for election irregularities, election irregularities that he will do everything in his power to maximize. 1/
Fuck this man, he was so intelligent to let Trump mislead him? If he was intelligent, he would have listened to science. Herman Cain killed himself with ignorance. And for people who looked up to him because he was an ‚ÄúAmerican success‚Äù, he may have well killed them.
And that consideration has stopped Trump before? He is laying a foundation for constructing an argument that the election result is invalid and refusing to leave office.
We?? WE?!?! Every day I adhere to safety protocol, I stay home, keep my kids home and safe. We've barely left the house for 4 months. And we still can't. Because of people like him. He failed us. Trump failed us.  Stupid people are killing us.
"Cain joined Trump in actively campaigning against masks."  Since, deleted tweet: ‚ÄúMasks will not be mandatory for the event, which will be attended by President Trump,‚Äù Cain wrote. ‚ÄúPEOPLE ARE FED UP!‚Äù
Oh, no they won‚Äôt! The people will have already done that. That‚Äôs the impregnable wall that even Trump‚Äôs evil incarnate cannot bash or even seep through. We are on the watchtower, already.

Why did Herman Cain die? He didn't listen to scientists and doctors. He didn't care about this "hoax", and it caused him his life. Please, I beg you, don't be like him. Trump doesn't give a fuck about him.
This is his way to inform Moscow Mitch and the GOP that this is what he wants. I wouldn‚Äôt be surprise if Mitch took trump‚Äôs request seriously and he tries make it happen. Everyday we come closer to corporatists taking over this country.

It is my humble opinion that come November President Trump is going to get beat solidly. Most Americans aren't as stupid as he thinks.  He's a professional liar.  If we have no election Nancy Pelosi becomes President on January 20th. It's the law.

Trump is responsible for the death of Herman Cain. It did not have to happen. Cain managed to surive cancer but got taken down by conspiracy theories, antiscience, and a politicized deadly virus that doesn't care how you vote. It is tragic and terrible.
This man died because of a decision to be a Sambo character for Donald Trump... think about that for a sec
This tweet aged beautifully. This is how Herman Cain should be remembered. A shit person who was the cause of shit-ness in other people, killed by his own sycophancy and idiocy, attending a failure of a campaign rally for the man responsible for his death.
Think you're underestimating the amount of these protest that are filled to brim of Libs who think Trump is root cause of everything wrong with the country.
So we all agree that Donald Trump is directly responsible for the death of Herman Cain, right?

Since we are asked to settle for Biden in order to defeat trump,just to be really safe the Dems should pick a white man for VP. Too many citizens will not vote for any woman of any race to hold that position.
The only case I can see for Shy Trump Voters is that statistically, it seems as though some members of any decent-sized group should be shy, and I haven't yet met a Trump supporter who doesn't yell at random people and do all sorts of other non-shy things.

Trump destroyed the U.S. economy. That idiot still doesn‚Äôt understand that we must solve the health crisis before we can solve the economic crisis. Why is that so hard to understand?
I thought the same thing. MSM has learned nothing since 2016. This nonsense about delaying the election is exactly that. Note to Media: Trump does not have super powers. He is the CEO of 1 branch of a co-equal branches of government.
Most Americans are tuning out trump. He is just seen as the village idiot.

Agreed. The fact that the Constitution prohibits Trump from doing it will not stop him. He is violating the Constitution and federal and international law at the border every single day.
I said it once, and I'll say it again: Obama must feel like a fucking idiot for trying to play nice with these racists like his respectability politics was going to change anything. Now we got Trump, AND this country might not survive long enough for Obama's legacyü•¥ü•¥

She wasn‚Äôt actually arrested. Her husband called the cops when friends sent him the video of her trashing the store. He wanted her taken in for psychiatric evaluation. When she said she was the spokesperson for QAnon and knew Trump, plus the video was enough to take her in.
And Trump - a no show (again)
I‚Äôm sure #putin has something pretty damaging on the TrumpKlan when Miss Universe was held in Moscow (2013).  Russian intel is pretty darn good at video/audeo surveillance, esp on foreigners.  Unlimited storage, good archives for when they need dirt.  Putin has dirt on Trump.
So, the sign he is flashing is associated with white supremacist hate groups in the US.  So strange to see a black person flash it.  His insanity reminds me of Trump‚Äôs aid, Stephen Miller, who is a white supremacist and Jewish.  What is going on????
That‚Äôs a total misrepresentation of the facts. Trump‚Äôs economic policy with strong economy he can raise more poor people into the middle class. He‚Äôs always working hard for black America. Biden‚Äôs track record is a total failure when it comes to black America so why vote for him?
Master P the black trump fr but I‚Äôd say a few things he‚Äôs doing actually successful
Grab America by the pussy like Trump said and you could be president too moe
Even if the majority of people vote in 2020 the voters aren‚Äôt ideologically motivated they just hate trump or hate Biden. Or hate one more/less then the other. That doesn‚Äôt mean they‚Äôre democrat, socialist, anarchist or liberal. Just like how not all trump voters are racist.
This is what everybody knows it is but wont say it. Trump is about to lose the election, and now it's all about how much money can be stolen on the way out the door.

Barr &amp; Durham could come back with proof that Joe Biden is a serial killer, and he'd still be a better pick than Donald Trump in November. By far!
