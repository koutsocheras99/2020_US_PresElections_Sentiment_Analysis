Anyone who can literally finish a sentence is amazing when you put them next to Biden but pro-war healthcare for profit identity politics puppets do not make the cut with 88% of all Democrat voters in the country who support Medicare for all so....... Just save it üôÑ

These people are McCain and Bush staffers, both of whom were horrible monsters. However, it is personally advantageous for them to have that type of monster in power instead of our current one, and Biden is the best fit for their ideology.
Careful with these Lincoln Project guys. They are conservative operators who expect to be granted entry into the Biden sphere of influence. This pushes what we call "the left" even further right than it already is.
This lady should mothballed like the navy does for old ships. She is absolutely clueless.....maybe Hunter Biden is her Godson?
If you DM me, I'll send you my late wife's blackberry brandy recipeüòâ
Or two terms of a President Warren after Biden.
Commentary: Why Biden‚Äôs choice for veep really does matter
I think the plain facts of the matter is you people are terrified of what's going to happen once Biden becomes President and we start hosting a lot of federal trials for Trump's cadre of crimes against humanity as we hold them accountable for this nightmare.
I remember when Biden said that. Jaw dropped. Then Obama said here Joe, be my VP

Why don‚Äôt you prove it? Did he use government agencies to spy on his political opponents? No wait...that was the Obama/Biden administration. Did he spread a collusion hoax for three years? No...that‚Äôs what he‚Äôs criminally investigating. Indictments are coming for Obama/Biden.

Biden wins Florida game over
How does he plan to be re-elected with a 32% approval rating and dropping fast?  Biden's ahead 16 points in the polls. And that gap is widening.  It's going to be a wipe out for both Trump and the GOP this November.
John Durham is going to indict big names in the Obama/Biden administration. Your silly projections can‚Äôt stop it.

Didn‚Äôt Biden say he wanted a VP that could be ready to go on day 1?   Wouldn‚Äôt her drive and ambition fit that description?
Yeah... in case nobody told you, trump inherited both the economy and unemployment numbers Obama. He then proceeded to run it straight into the ground. Now we‚Äôre here. #Biden #Biden2020 #ObamaSpeaking #ObamaIsBetterAtEverything
The Election is already over:  TRUMP 362 to 176 BIDEN  The Democrats have fuked themselves from any possible chance of winning in Nov. The silent Majority are DONE with the anti-America CANCEL CULTURE, BLM, ANTIFA, Riots, White guilt, Tyranny, Face Diapers, MSM, &amp; Shutdowns!
This is a campaign rally and a time to lie about Biden!  He wants voter ID...I gave my ID when I registered to vote!  They send me my ballot because I am registered!  He is stupid!  Btw wasn‚Äôt this a coronavirus briefing?  ü§î

Maybe he caught what Biden‚Äôs got. Lol
Ok. Here you go. Biden in a landslide.  Thanks for your participation.
Would the indictment of John Brennan implicate Obama/Biden?
He‚Äôs cleared and exonerated. Obama not so much.
This is the best Biden ad I have seen all year!
He will be indicted. His indictment implicates Obama/Biden. Say goodbye to the democrat party.
Democrat??????? This guy is not representing his constituents, using the Democrat cover and belittling Democrat Biden.
I‚Äôll go with the IG report. 17 violations, that‚Äôs a conspiracy by the Obama/Biden administration.
Short list of crimes by Obama/Biden and Mueller in the Flynn case.
He's a con man and a puppet  Three-quarters of the Democrat voters in Washington state voted for Bernie in the 2016 primaries But voting by mail seems to have somehow magically changed their minds and go in the direction of Joe Biden and corruption in 2020 ü§î Weirdü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Just wait for what other drugs will be in the White House if Biden gets elected.  (Aka Kamala Harris laughing about using pot)  Those with the code to the nuclear button should not be allowed to use it while under the influence. More dangerous than DUI.
Thanks Tom, one of the few Republicans with any balls left.  Cheating China has to be stopped and God help us if the Feckless Biden my time Biden wins.  You may hate Trump but China will destroy this country and economy quickly if not held accountable.
What‚Äôre the odds that these sneaky Democrats don‚Äôt let Biden debate Trump ?
Rick, you should be more worried about Biden's mental condition.
If it included renouncing US citizenship, leaving and never setting foot in the country again.....maybe.
This is my biggest fear right now....it's scary that people are even contemplating this, this is how bad a president he is

You‚Äôre going to vote for dementia trodden Biden? Wtf- you all don‚Äôt like Trump because he speaks the way it is. He isn‚Äôt holding your hand while fucking you over! GO TRUMP!!!
Well far left people are just as nuts and stupid as far right people. Just like all the crazy Bernie Bros who refused to vote for Hillary and won‚Äôt for Biden.
Who should Joe Biden pick to be his VP? Take the survey today! --&gt;  via  false
No he‚Äôs not. Yet, that‚Äôs your excuse for the crimes committed by the Obama/Biden administration?
The crimes committed by the Obama/Biden administration are self inflicted too. Indictments don‚Äôt care how you feel about the election.
How ironic. The author claims Trump is ushering in a totalitarian regime, yet completely ignores the fascist behavior of Obama/Biden administration. Using government agencies to spy on and use a fake narrative to have Trump removed from office with a coup. What an absolute moron.
One of the things I appreciate about Joe Biden right now is that his voice is quiet.  I like having a president who isn't belligerent.
I expect indictments before September, with well known names from the Obama/Biden administration. Democrats will destroyed all the way down the ballot.
A timeline of corruption.
I‚Äôve never followed Q. It‚Äôs easily available in the public domain. Here‚Äôs a short list of crimes by Obama/Biden and Mueller.
My Pres Trump legalized weed to win the election theory might just play out. Lookout.  Democrats Wimp Out on Federal Marijuana Legalization. Thanks, Joe Biden! ‚Äì

He's not going to prison under Trump...but under Biden, he will. Trump can't pardon him then. And Trump knows he's got a good chance of going to prison under a Democratic presidency.
Funny, everytime 45 says something stupid, senile, and racist it's a "joke," according to his aides (enablers) which happens quite often. Biden calls it a joke in this very speech but he's insane? ü§îü§£üò∑üåä
I agree - if he did say this, it's disgusting. Not sure how this will help ur argument re Biden today - because the Biden of today is what matters, just like the 45th President of TODAY is what matters. Just wear ur mask &amp; take a seat, fool! üôÑüåäüò∑

Is that really what Fox News has you thinking? It‚Äôs one block in Portland. It was a few peaceful blocks in Seattle. I live in Wa. Fox is lying to you about ‚ÄúRiots‚Äù.   This happened under trump. Not Biden, not Obama. This is trumps America you idiot.
Nobody wants to come here right now. We‚Äôre the joke of the world. We‚Äôre 3rd world rn. Keep talking about how the dems are gonna ruin everything. This country is on fire and Biden didn‚Äôt touch a thing. This was lil donny all the way.

The man who told millions of Americans,"you ain't black," and used the term "Blafrican American," said that OUR President is RACIST.   Joe Biden has ABSOLUTELY lost his mind. President Trump is a champion for Black Voices. He always has been and he always will be.
And I worry that screamy orange grandpa won‚Äôt let go even if Biden does manage to win
The fringe left is threatening a voter rebellion against the DNC and Biden for not supporting M4A.
You guys who want to rebel against the Democrats and Biden over expanding Medicare are just consigning all of us in America to a certain death.  We have much bigger fish to fry than this shit.
I could've told you that with the first State Primary for the Democrats. They went hardcore for Biden, who's a Corporate Democrat, while Bernie gets marginalized again.  Frankly, once 2020 Election is over, I say we knock the chair out from under the Dems.
We will ‚Äî by electing Biden in November!
#OpenTheDebates  won the primary within the #Libertarian party just like Biden did in his races, Trump got the incumbent pass. #LetHerDebate #VoteGold #LetUsVote More people need to hear her message of #Liberty especially those turned off to politics.

I'm a betting man: Biden's presidency will last only one term if the above goals are met, and will be replaced with a more moderate, open-minded, non-corporatist politician, but the best opportunity would be to hijack the Democrat platform by 2028 and push out the corporatists.

Biden can quote poetry from memory.  Not only has Trump not read any to quote, when pressed on the Bible which he supposedly believed, he couldn't specify even a single bit of Scripture that inspired him.  Continue to worship your Golden-Plated Calf, Aaron (oh, sorry, Bob).
Biden said he'd leave it up to the states. Weed has been legal here in Washington for 5 years, he won't fuck with that.
I hadn't heard of Karen Bass until this point.
Trust me, no matter which woman Biden picks, she will rub some people the wrong way. Powerful women tend to do that.
You've got to realize that Biden is better than Trump. You're not stupid, by any means.
Duckworth cause of experience.  But I really like Lance Bottoms in the future and Demmings is interesting.  Dont know enuf about either.  Biden will still win but Kamala will be a slight drag on the ticket
Everyone is in cahoots with MIC. They make something in every district in the USA. War drives our economy. Will Biden beat our swords into plowshares? No. But he'll save Social Security and Medicare from the greedy fucking bastards who want to privatize it. Change comes slowly.

There you go again, all #RoyCohn lying again.  You realize we have Biden's own statements to consult on this ...
True.  But if the Chief Justice swore in Biden, that would settle that.  Unless Trump went for Judge Judy?
Of course if the Florida electors are insufficient to rescue Trump anyway, Chief Justice Roberts could swear in Biden.  Either way, the current President ceases to be POTUS on Jan 21, &amp; only Roberts can swear in the successor.  Grassley Sen Pro Temp would be in line then.

I technically want Biden to win... but don't know if I could vote in good faith in him.
Arianna, thanks for your spirit and commnity action. Can‚Äôt wait for the humanity of Biden‚Äôs presidency!

Trump vs. Biden: Where they stand on health, economy, more
What are you talking about? Lol. Trump was bragging about how well he did on his test. Biden has a lot of scandals, and Trump will tear him apart. The Ukraine scandal originally started off with Biden‚Äôs son (not Trump like the media was trying to push)
Trump won due to his snappy responses against Hillary, which is something Biden won‚Äôt be able to handle. Also, people believe that Biden has dementia of some sort. In a televised debate, Biden loses easily.
can we play her ripping up biden over his pro segregationist polices as soon as he announces her as vp?  haha
Thank you!  This whole discussion is beneath us right now, we need every one to concentrate on Joe Biden winning and bringing back normalcy to our poor, battered country.
I can hardly wait until Biden is president and we have a woman VP, and many women in his Cabinet and other high jobs.  My blood doesn't boil when I read the email, I just thought it was yet another stupid Trumper.
Watch. Biden will open his mouth, and then suddenly he will lose the election. He can‚Äôt form coherent points together, or even get through sentences. Not only that, he‚Äôs an asshole to his following.

I have friends who were removed as Bernie delegates because they did not support Biden
You must not have watched literally any interview with Bernie during the entire primary. No matter who it was interviewing him, they always asked him if he and his supporters would support the nominee no matter who it was. Meanwhile Biden cronies would outright say they wouldn't
Biden needs to pick someone who can become president just in case.

Where does it say that the ACA is a starting point for single payer? A lot of the ACA's biggest backers and key players are against single payer, especially private insurers. Joe Biden even said he would veto M4A if it passed, because he favors private care and the ACA.

Biden versus Trump. Some speculate that the future of the republic hinges on the outcome of the next election. But for smart investors it doesn't really matter who wins.

I have one question for Biden ‚Ä¶ count backwards from 100 subtracting 7.  This is a standard question for stage 3 &amp; 4 Alzheimer's patients.   Tuesday my wife was asked this question by her neurologist ‚Ä¶ she failed.
If Biden is elected he will be the 1st. titular POTUS in our history.
Their only hope is to convince Trump not to run so a more acceptable opponent for Biden can be at the top of the ballot. I wonder if a financial package is being prepared to get him to abdicate. He‚Äôll also need a country to take him in so he can avoid prosecution. Russia? Turkey?

BREAKING NEWS Heels up  Harris seen coming out of Joe Biden's basement early this morning
I love you Joe Biden ü•∞ Thank you so much for taking this on. You're everything we need right now. üí™üíú
Oh barf...ü§Æüò±ü§Æüò±ü§Æüò±.. did I just read they think Biden will be picking.   K. Harris.  It's like one vacant brain and another vacant brain.  One can't talk in complete sentences and the other can't carry on a 2-way conversation.
WHAT????  Biden is getting rid of cows now!?  No suburbs, no cows?
Glad someone else see's it to Sara, it's not Biden I am worried about it's his running mate, look at who he chooses for his Running Mate, she is the one that we need to be scared of.
He‚Äôs surely a meat puppet. I‚Äôve taken care of mentally declining family. Biden lost the light behind his eyes the same exact way. Is there any precedent to the democrats utilizing a bait-and-switch in the last few innings? There‚Äôs no way this can be legitimate.
Thank god. But the democrats will use it as excuse to put Biden back in the basement &amp; not let the public see he‚Äôs mentally not fit for the job. Biden is very racest &amp; bigoted. He has dementia, senility &amp; mental decline. Everyone seen it. Doctors can tell he‚Äôs suffering mentality

My favorite thing about republicans right now is that they keep selling that rumor that Joe Biden is an extreme leftist lmao
I'm guessing the gifs are supposed to somehow scare people? Oh gee, guess I'll have to vote for Biden now :-/
Actually it's not Biden I will be worried about, though he won't win but if he does I will be worried about his running Mate, now that's the puppet master we need to worry about. Especially when he said he will be bringing in a "Woman of Color" and all of them we've seen, racist
Unethical, you betcha. We would not have him any other way. He's not a corrupt Politician like the Democrats who piss away peoples lives, like Cuemo did in NY. And Biden? wow talk about Racist, if you do not vote for me you ain't black enough, lmao...Calling Trump racist?
So, Joe Biden‚Äôs campaign slogan is #BuildBackBetter. It, literally, sounds like something Biden would say. BTW, for those not keeping track, this is basically another way to say #MAGA.
And there is a whole twitterverse who talks about President Trump and every mistake he makes. Meanwhile, Biden can‚Äôt seem to make a coherent sentence anymore, let alone know where he is.

Biden Says One Thing But Then What He Ends Up Doing Will Be Serving Himself No One Else But
Biden has my vote no matter what at this point. Trump is a threat to liberal democracy on par with Viktor Orb√°n or the Law and Justice Party, albeit less competent.
Sam, I am going either full retard or just completely Biden but who is Patrick Howley?
.....he also said Trump can't just do everything by Executive Order. Obama signed 276 EOs &amp; 1186 Presidential proclamations.  I guess   Biden didn't know how Obama worked. What else doesn't he know.?
Biden actually said it was irresponsible Govt. leadership that sent Corporations overseas but  should be here in America. He &amp;  Obama placed such regs on Corps they did just that. It took Pres.  Trump to bring businesses back to build factories Obama said never would.
I don't think it will be Biden but who replaces him, that's the one we got to watch for, his running mate.
you are a fool you are DT‚Äôs boy you have thrown away your reputation. When Biden wins I hope you go to jail.
The problem is that democrats will NOT let ppl go back to work or open their businesses. Democrats R also lying about the virus numbers increasing. Dems R allowing rioters to run their city‚Äôs in violence. Dems R doing this to hide Biden so ppl won‚Äôt see Biden. Dems R lawlessness.

When Trumps tells the crowd that Biden would allow lawlessness and protests, during the debate, Biden should say, ‚ÄúIs there lawlessness now‚Äù? The prez would say, ‚Äúyes‚Äù.

What I hate is Christiane Annampour's smarmy framing of entitlement of the lukewarm DNC-anointed candidate to the votes of Bernie supporters.  If Biden wants Bernie supporter votes, he can support progressive policies and apologize for his racist legacy and sexual harassment.

If you truly support Biden, then vote Biden, not because he isn‚Äôt Trump. If you support Trump, vote Trump. If you support third party, vote third party. But don‚Äôt infringe upon Democracy, the right to make your own vote. And don‚Äôt stop others trying to inform the public.
If all the Biden supporters who can‚Äôt tell me how he is a better candidate other than ‚ÄúHe isn‚Äôt Trump‚Äù realized that they could choose a different option, like 3rd party.... The 3rd party would win. Don‚Äôt contribute to the cycle.

If Biden wins nothing will "Fundamentally Change"   We as Americans need and demand #Change   If Biden won't do it another fake Alt-right populous will spring up 2024.  Poke a hole in THAT logic....
Damage control is the best argument Biden has üëç  I understand and respect your decision.
The second Biden wins Liberals will immediately side with Republicans against Bernie Sanders supporters/Progressives/Anti-Fascists/Nazi Punchers!  Mark my tweet.
Hmm I think we control the narrative enough to shame most Trumpers into hiding, but they are becoming more emboldened ü§î  Depends: will liberals turn on Antifa?   Will Biden deem us "terrorists" just for demanding fundamental change?
Hmm there are a lot of variables.   Pros and Cons to each. If Biden wins liberals will turn on us and embrace modern Republican values.  If Trump wins we-- more or less-- stay united in opposition. Lots of dissatisfied citizens marching in the streets sounds like the cure to me.
Do reined I still can‚Äôt believe that Biden is the nominee
My man is looking cartoonishly fucked up in that photo.  Biden's cop fetish is sick and gross. He can't be president.
Oh, I wouldn't argue in Biden's favor üòâ
It makes sense when you consider that Biden is old as grave dust and hasn't had any non-square fun in his entire life. He's afraid of jazz-related murders.
No Biden needs to improve his policies.
Oh please! Scare tactics now? Biden will quadruple drug prices....lmao!!! #NobodyLikesMe
Coin toss.  He APPEARS worse but when you factor Biden's voting record into the mix, it's up to opinion.
What preceded Trump's rise to power?  Obama/Biden. They promised #Change but didn't deliver, so when they left the American public was still THIRSTY for change.   In comes Mr. Fake Populous, Trump.
Other than, ‚ÄúHe isn‚Äôt trump.‚Äù Is there any actual reasons to vote for Biden? Because I‚Äôm seriously confused why so many have gotten behind him. Rather than the Majority choosing third party, the Majority is yet again siding with America Incorporated. Please, someone explain.
And if we bring in Biden they'll all say the problems with his presidency is that Trump dug us into a big hole and Saint Biden is working with Wall Street to get the country back on it's feet!
I know Trump is technically worse than Biden.  But if we elect Biden this perpetual cycle of terrible Republicans being exchanged for terrible Democrats and vice versa....WILL NEVER END!  We will be in the exact same situation in 2024, 2028, etc.
And I bash Bernie regularly now.  He kowtowed to Biden without gaining any concrete concessions so my love/respect for Bernie has waned.  He's still the best we got but it's weak tea.
This CAN NOT be repeared enough. I believe with Biden leading it WILL happen...still we ALL must keep saying and pushing for #PoliceReformNow

Biden doesn't give AF about our lives.  The guy is vehemently against Single Payer healthcare and that's one of the most CRUCIAL policies to Americans!  He's against it during a pandemic.   The guy simply hasn't #EarnedOurVotes  Get over it.
Just because we bash Biden on a regular basis doesn't mean we are Pro Trump.  He's our defacto leader. Are we not allowed to question or harass those individuals who want to be president?  Both deserve intense scrutiny, period.
Bet on the wrong horse. Biden was never about racial justice.
Gaffey Joe Biden - a typical example of what Democrats think of as a "good" presidential candidate.
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
Joe Biden in his own words has admitted that he does not have any empathy for the generation that he desperately needs in order to get elected. He's fucked.
Can you just shut up already? #ObamaWasBetterAtEverything #Biden
Quit your whining. You‚Äôre losing in the polls. Laughing...#VoteByMail #Biden2020Landslide #Biden
Yes, you are correct. We do want Biden for the win. Biden 2020.
If they were ever going to turn out in huge numbers, it would have been for Bernie. They didn't, and now we're fucked. Turn out for Biden is not happening in that demographic. Sorry.
Bernie agreed to support the democratic nominee in order to run as a Democrat. It‚Äôs not even his choice honestly. And that‚Äôs what Biden supporters fail to see.
Imagine thinking that the Radical Left has any sway at all over Corporate "nothing will fundamentally change" Biden. You're just upset that he's encroaching on your platform.
Your watching the blue wave washing over you and right out of office. That‚Äôs the enthusiasm you see! #Biden #Biden2020 #Biden2020Landslide
Overrated. Joe Biden doesn't need money for people to know who he is. I think money only really matters in politics for relative unknowns who are trying to get the word out about themselves.
It makes sense when Hillary was up 2 in the end nationally and Trump won by 8. Now Biden up 8-10 nationally and Trump only up 1.
wish all 350,000 of my followers would cut and paste this and tweet it out right now:  JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
Obama had eight years, Biden had decades...
Then vote for a new speaker because you know Pelosi will block this even if Biden becomes president
Obama had eight years, Biden had decades...
Obama had eight years, Biden had decades...
This will not be the normal tranfer of power.  At every department,  change and rebuilding has to occur at the same time investigators need to be looking at every aspect of this criminal enterprise.   Is Biden building a deep enough team?
We're over it.  Now that Biden has locked up the senior vote us Progressives/Millennials/Principled voters can focus on giving the Green Party federal funding.   By next election we will FINALLY have a viable 3rd option!
What Astro is saying is both are worldwide embarrassments. Which you referred to only Trump as but got upset when Biden was called such. Saying Cognitive insults won‚Äôt get you far. But that‚Äôs what you were doing. Fixed all the unclearness. Yay!!
It‚Äôs not about luxury, it‚Äôs democracy. My vote is for who ever I vote for. A vote not for trump is a vote for Biden by the same logic.
Obama had eight years and Biden had decades...
I sincerely think that if Obama/Biden actually implemented the #Change they promised then Trump would NEVER have become president.   Trump struck an anti Muslim cord bc were all tired of the endless wars.
If you vote for Biden regardless of policy, what leverage do you have left? No one is entitled to your vote. No matter the situation. Otherwise it isn‚Äôt Democracy.

I‚Äôve said all along Jay Inslee doesn‚Äôt even want to be Governor. He has his sights set on a cabinet position, and will destroy as many Washingtonians‚Äô lives as necessary to hurt Trump and help Biden. He‚Äôs an asshole, pure and simple!
Fair enough, your argument boils down to damage control. I respect that. Trump will do more harm than Biden.  Neither will give us anything we need, nothing "essential" will be added but at least we can buy ourselves more time to fix the issues snowballing outta control.
All Trump has to do is tell the truth about Biden and that lead goes Bye-bye!  Not the strongest position for your lead man
They're voting for Biden, but not because of his voting record or policy platform.   It's out of fear.  We aren't cowering at the thought of another Trump presidency, we are fighting against the Oligarchies that control both Democrats and Republicans.
Saint Biden.   That's how liberals see a Neoliberal who vows to his Big Money Donors that nothing will Fundamentally Change.
Biden isn't saving the lives Trump killed or put in jeopardy.   They're both lying fascists with horrible policy platforms. Neoliberals are just as hawkish and have equal disregard for life/quality of life.
You're confident Biden didn't do anything rape or pedophile related, good for you-- we aren't that naive.  There's plenty of PUBLIC evidence that shows he's a creep.  And Biden is a liar on the same level as Trump. So it makes perfect sense not to believe him.
Tv ratings? Try working on today‚Äôs problems...racial injustice, COVID19, the economy....any ring a bell?  #COVID19 #IStandWithFauci #BidenI don‚Äôt think believing something like that does anybody any good. Everybody just support Biden! Quit putting all these choices down. Jesus. He will pick who he will pick. All of this conjecture doesn‚Äôt do any good.
Quit putting Democrats down. Don‚Äôt put women down. Just support Biden and his choices. I‚Äôm so sick of seeing people putting each other, or others down on the Democrat side. It‚Äôs crazy. Have we learned nothing?
And Joe Biden will make his choice well.
Biden isn‚Äôt that kind of guy. He‚Äôs not gonna be afraid of that.
In the end, it doesn‚Äôt matter what we think. That is Biden‚Äôs decision. I just hope he gets rid of Dodd.
There‚Äôs not a whole lot of Republicans left didn‚Äôt back Trump. And I really doubt Biden is going to pick anyone who backed Trump.
This is some seriously good, imaginative stuff. This is something I really wanted to see in this election cycle where someone from outside the Biden campaign &amp; other traditional Democratic PACs to go after Trump hard in the same mean, downright disrespectful way he treats others

I hope Biden will be able to get something done for him.
I trust Biden to Vet and pick the appropriate VP. I think everybody should stay out of it and quit giving their conjecture to what should happen. Just trust the presumptive nominee. You can‚Äôt change his decision anyway.
Are they? How so? I think there are a lot more things to be flipping out about right now. Biden will vet and pick who he picks.

how are you feeling about this now?
These are the people that will be enthusiastically voting for Joe Biden and going back into political hibernation once he takes office, because they can go back to brunch.
I have a theory about this. I think if Trump goes down, Pence is the candidate of the GOP, and I don't think Biden beats Pence. Pence isn't "Trumpy" enough to push away Never Trumpers. Trump dying right now may actually not be better.
If I were still a centrist Democrat, I would be very scared. She will be de facto president if Biden remains as a puppet-figurehead, or the president if Biden resigns. And it will be a dual Harris/Pelosi run country.
No, he shouldn‚Äôt b/c that would give the GOP time to offer up a more legit candidate who could potentially beat Biden.  Plus, I wanna see trump get his fat ass kicked. üò¨ #WeWillVote
Just remember as Biden said if you don‚Äôt vote for him you‚Äôre not black. Guess they forgot to put that one in there
And yet so many libertarian gun supporters are going to help Joe Biden get elected by voting 3rd party.  Gun control groups support Biden. #WakeUp.  Trump 2020
You already proved your ignorant,now you turn creepy by asking where my sister works? Who are you Joe Biden? Only a moron would give personal information on social media,I'm sure even someone as simple as you can grasp that concept. If not ask the nurse for a play by play. G'day
This is bullshit. Biden‚Äôs very likely to pass away in office so *anyone* is gonna be focused on being an effective replacement. The only real reason I can think of to object to Harris is her DA background, but only leftists object to that, and since when do the Dems listen to us?
anyone who wants Trump in office instead of Biden is equally bad. I don't care if they have a red rose or red X in their Twitter name.
I'm not saying Biden will save America. He may well do very little of value and we get more Trumpism in 2024.  I'm saying that Trump winning in 2020 is effectively a gunshot to Uncle Sam's temple. It's the end of America. You won't get a say in this country ever again.
You REALLY think that Biden will appoint a ultra-right justice, so we see Roe v. Wade overturned, Obergefell v. Hodges overturned, Lawrence v. Texas overturned? That he'll continue Trump's turning the gov't into loyalist lackeys gutting democracy?  THAT is what's ridiculous.
Good ol' rose Twitter is like "sure, Trump is bad, but Biden is worse and we're willing to sacrifice minorities and let America become an authoritarian theocratic state as long as Biden doesn't win."
Hello, if that were true about soon to be President Biden, it would be piped in every living room in the United States and beyond.
Twitter uses manipulated media label for the first time, on doctored Joe Biden video #dpistulka #exityourway
No one will understand any of the debates. Trump will lie as completely and incoherently as usual and Biden isn't sharp enough to go toe-to-toe with him, so he too will be incoherent. It's just going to be a bunch of name calling and tired rhetoric.
It was the race war tweet that got me on board with Biden but I want better in 2024. Even without the race war baiting, his continued refusal to tackle the virus head-on could have had me there by now
Like Barr did with the Mueller Report, Biden needs to do a preemptive report refuting the Durham report before its release.
Joe Biden is not the President of the United States and he is not using the federal government to help him get reelected. What the fuck is wrong with you people, don‚Äôt you see the difference?
Either way the election of 2020 will make America unlivable for non-members of the Leftist cult. Trump wins, 4 more years of approved violence. Biden wins, retribution against conservatives. Time for America to get a divorce. Each state divided into red/blue sovereign states.
Oh, most definitely. If Biden fucks this up, we could get just such a person in to continue Trumpism. Which is why we need to be all over Biden and make him scared of the American people if he doesn't step up.
Everyone needs to keep up with the protests, stay out in the streets, make sure Biden feels the pressure from the people. Similarly House Reps and Senators hearing from people.   I'm not happy with Biden either, I don't expect much from him. But I'm TERRIFIED about more Trump.
Remember there‚Äôs no election that can‚Äôt be stolen. And if Biden wins we then still need to keep fighting because the Dems do NOT have our best interests in mind. There‚Äôs just no hope, here.
Yeah.  And the thing I've noticed the Biden campaign doing is they tend to publicize the worst polls in advertising.  So even if every other poll has them ahead in a state, they'll pick the losing poll and say, "We're so close!  Donate today!"  They get it.
The thing I hate about polling this go-around are the number of people that keep saying "ACT LIKE BIDEN IS DOWN BY TEN!"  Well, no shit.  I don't think anyone is going to be taking a victory lap here.   Still interesting to see, though.
I am appalled at your failure to support Joe Biden at this critical time in our nation's history. Your shortsightedness is very apparent. I am a Vietnam Veteran, who like many others, have put our lives on the line for democracy. Grow up.
It certainly gives me pause. I'll vote for Biden to end the madness but if I don't get a much better option from the Democrats in 2024 I'll be back to voting 3rd party
That's too good for Biden. #NeverBidenNeverTrump
Hillary was wrong to run knowing how high her disapproval was. DNC should not have thwarted Bernie in 16 he was doing better than Hillary in polls vs Trump. I'll hold my nose &amp; vote for Biden to end the madness but I want better in 2024 or back to 3rd party for me
Same map of 2016 right before the election.
Yeah, so his Chinese bedfellows can undercut the U.S. competition; what a dog you are, Biden.
Sure. Biden will never be President of the United States.
Bush43 had it and he was no Reagan. I got that one wrong. Thanks to Perot. The issue, in my opinion, is that you have to buy into Biden as a change candidate. He isn‚Äôt. He‚Äôs just not an overt asshole. But he‚Äôs not better. I‚Äôm taking bets with odds.
He‚Äôs a sacrifice candidate. Like Dole in 1996, Kerry in 2004, Mondale in 1984, McCain in 2008 and Romney in 2012. Clinton 2016 was tough. So we‚Äôre a few others. But not this time. The polls are wrong. I hang out with polar opposites and even concede. Biden will never be POTUS.
Sorry. There will be no President Biden. I‚Äôve predicted accurately right every year since 1980 EXCEPT 1992.
A family member posted on FB they were voting for POTUS as ‚Äúhe‚Äôs the only way out of this mess.‚Äù Later, a friend told a Biden supporter ‚Äúyou‚Äôre ignorance is showing‚Äù and that the ‚Äúlibtards‚Äù and their ‚Äúdivisive bullshit‚Äù could ‚Äúeat dicks.‚Äù  My brain exploded at the contradictions.
Troll Alert! Go to Biden‚Äôs Puppetmaster see if he can make Biden talk on his page.
What a rude awakening this must be for they‚Äôre voting for Biden because they want a real president, not Putin‚Äòs puppet

I am voting for Biden but he ain't getting my endorsement.
I miss Bush, would vote for him again. Saying this as someone who voted for Hillary and will be voting for Biden this November. Bush had his bad moments but at least was respectful of the position of the presidency‚Äîboth at home and abroad.
Like anyone will let Biden out of the basement to debate!
Anyone who would like to vote for someone other than Biden without handing victory to Trump should be in favor of #RankedChoiceVoting.   In fact it gives you the opportunity to put more than one candidate ahead of whomever you like the least.
Bitch won't leave his bunker for anything but golf.
Well, I've heard these Biden supporters are wavering (yes they are reportedly alive)
Biden is gonna be fantastic!
Wrong trump &amp; gop controlled by the Putin mob. Vote Biden
Awww nothing to say just repeating yourself,typical of your type. The biden disease ü§£ü§£ü§£
My message is change will come even if Biden does not embrace all that the left wants. If the left ends up not supporting him they are biting off their nose to spite their face. Change will come easier through a moderate dem I believe. Big picture!
I agree with the protest against the police and big changes in funding and oversight of the police we will get there sooner with Biden, trump we will end up in more upheaval
Biden also said he would mandate that the federal govt will buy American made goods without exceptions (as in, no goods from "allies" and China). Trump's "Buy America" campaign was just a token gesture. I'm hoping Biden's variant extends beyond Trump's faux protectionism.
I actually had to think really hard to eek out what little policy substance Biden has, because he does a damn good job of spouting unsubstantial word salad like Ratboy-ar-dee Pete Buttigieg. Of course, I'm not very confident that he'll stick to his words in the first place.
Note the word "marginal". It brings me absolutely no joy when I think of voting for Biden. For what his rhetoric is worth, Biden did say he would roll back Trump's corporate tax cuts. Biden will also assume a more diplomatic stance when it comes to Cuba and Iran (hopefully).
It's sure to be the longest 100 days of my lifetime. The last few weeks of summer will of course go by in a blink but then waiting to see whether Biden can get through a debate and wrap this turkey up will be torture
If Biden continues to disappoint me on policy any more than he already has, then I'm gonna stay home. It's really on a knife's edge at this point whether I vote. I don't care how much Blue MAGAts virtue signal and hurl platitude shit sandwiches at me. I'll just be chilling.
To dumb it down for you, your petty insults and cliches aren't a factor in my voting behavior. The reason why my line between voting and staying home are blurring is because Biden offers less than the bare minimum on policy while gaslighting progressives with flowery cliches.
Consider yourself lucky that gnats like you don't play any role in my decision to vote since policy is my prime condition. Hence, why I'm leaning towards voting for Biden who has a (marginally) better policy platform. If emotion was a factor, I would just chill on the couch.
I see a difference for sure, but I simply don't find either of them compelling. The Dems have done almost everything possible to turn me off. I'm leaning towards voting Biden this election cycle to remove Trump, but the line between staying home and voting is getting kinda blurry
Ya no... same reason Dems gave us HRC and now Biden.  Parties are political gangs with loyalty tests. Not reason.
You can not like both trump and Biden, crazy as it sounds.
Thank you very much for explaining .it's Joe Biden  who's going to win
Trump did not say that Biden did
We need the votes for Biden.  Can go back to disagreeing LATER.  Right now we have a country to save.
'"If you vote for Biden, you‚Äôre going to be living in Nazi Germany,‚Äù the woman with the swastika mask' said.   Doesn't explain why she HAD a mask with a swastika on it.
Yes me too! Or they are saying they will vote for him and then secretly vote for Biden. Wishful thinking on my part.
George Carlin certainly was no liberal. In fact, for any democrats trying to make him out to be some champion of why you should vote for anyone, especially Biden, well...there‚Äôs this:

Ok don't be hasty but stand your ground. No way Dave could resist but you might have to give Biden a softball interview now
seems to be. you know, the ones who are really really against Joe Biden and have a lot to say, but barely bother to speak out against Trump and don't seem to mind the idea of him winning and permanently ending democracy, for example.
What a lie!   Huge lie.  Biden 2020!
Mr. Trump, unlike your penchant for insecurity-Biden doesn‚Äôt require 24 seven reassurances that he‚Äôs the right one. Biden already knows he‚Äôs the person to get the job done and get you voted out!
A mock up of election results that show Biden win the Presidency
Joe has no shame every one knows the msm is building up Biden giving the people false hope just like in 16 so when Trump wins the snowflakes will go crazy again it‚Äôs not that damn hard to figure out
We‚Äôll see. We‚Äôll see how Biden does up against Trump in November. Odds aren‚Äôt very good Trump will win that is for sure. And all of you Trump followers will have to go back in hiding where you once were.
Biden doesn‚Äôt live by Twitter for one thing. He‚Äôs not the president for another thing. And Trump doesn‚Äôt have nearly the followers that Obama does.
Imagine what happens if Trump wins again! All out revolution. If Biden wins, the Left will quickly try to confiscate weapons, red-flag Trump supporters, maybe you'll get an IRS audit. Either way, the SHTF in Nov.
Still it's a sad choice just like last time. We need to get away from both parties once Trump's destruction of our democracy is ended. No more than one term for Biden pleaseMe kicking in the door to vote for Joe Biden. You fragile, narcissistic child.
I think supporters of all 2020 candidates should put their differences aside for the next 95 days and support Joe Biden in order to remove Trump from the White House.
Nope, Bill Clinton was a frequent visitor to Epstein‚Äôs pedo island and was with underage girls. There‚Äôs no doubt about it...I just want to see who else was there...Biden maybe? #KAG2020

So, a potential VP to Biden is a Scientology fan? No, thank you. That‚Äôs a huge red flag, right there.
This tweet sounds like voicing fear in real time. Which is reasonable.  We‚Äôre all scared, and yes, Trump is *losing*, but Biden is also working with the most progressive folks in the party to continue to shape his platform. Polls show him ahead in all swing states.
America‚Äôs recent confrontational actions towards China may be part of a calculus to put relations on a trajectory that would be difficult to reverse

The best way to boost the ticket is a strong woman candidate who can campaign well, step into the Presidency should the need arise and it shouldn't matter if the person challenges Joe Biden's ego if the person is the best for the Veep slot.
Interesting.  I need to look into this "Karen Bass" person. Unless she's her really, really progressive I couldn't possibly see myself supporting Joe Biden but it's never a bad time to continue one's education.
these things said, she has gigantic meltdown potential -- she could lose Florida for Biden, Val Demings could win Florida for Biden. In 2016 Dems ignored the Electoral College and the result was....
"Remember, this president went so far to say what I warned he would say four months, ago: He thinks maybe we should delay the election," Biden said. "Be prepared. This is going to be a tough road, so vote."

I think you're looking at a misleading snipped of a state poll, not a national tracking polls, or an average of polls. The Rasmusses result is less bad for Trump, but not far off the others at Biden +6. not -2.

Yes, Biden is plummeting in the polls as we speak. Biden‚Äôs poll numbers are very receptive to the topic of the day on Twitter.
That's the whole thing about this issue, is that Biden should not let these two anywhere near his decision making process regarding VP pick or anything else.
Educated guess: Joe Biden will pick Kamala Harris as the VP nominee on or before August 3rd.  FACT: Ed Rendell is a piece of shit. Always has been. And always will be.

Joe Biden's Presidential Campaign -- A Costly, Radical Race and Gender Agenda | National Review
#WeWillVote early &amp; for Joe Biden. #VoteEarly
You‚Äôre trying to sway Biden. It‚Äôs sickening how you think you can help destroy a party &amp; then have a say in the other. This didn‚Äôt start w/Trump. The #SouthernStrategy started under Nixon &amp; trickle down economics came from Ronnie. Both of those things have harmed us for decades.
Why I won‚Äôt vote for Biden:
Interview with Sen. Tammy Duckworth &amp; Discussion on Joe Biden Campaign
"Nobody needs an AR-15. Period." -Joe Biden  America doesn‚Äôt need a president who will give Beto O'Rourke the authority to demolish our Second Amendment.  95 days until we decide the future of our right to self-defense.
The choice isn't likely to make or break Biden's campaign and it isn't likely to radically change his administration if he wins. But I think it matters to the extent that it sets the VP pick up for the nomination in 2024 or 2028.
If Joe Biden wins the election, he may have an opportunity to not just repair relations with the United Kingdom but also help London figure out its post-Brexit role in Europe and beyond,  argues.
#Trump 2016 was instructive: old rules don't apply. Go big.  We saw how boring #Clinton/#Kaine &amp; #Romney/#Ryan were‚Ä¶ that's #Biden/#Bass. Snoozefest.  He won't win playing it safe in a basement. #Warren can turn down the woke, turn out the soccer moms &amp; energize youth. #VPWarren
I get that; I want the VP to win the following 8 years. I hope this ticket moves more progressive. The 1st 2 years will be a heavy workload given how bad everything is. I want the VP to focus on winning during the 2nd 2 years. Biden‚Äôs not going to make it through a 2nd term.
Unless Trump plans to occupy the White House illegally, a postponed election wouldn‚Äôt keep him in office.  In fact, it could well usher in an unelected President Joe Biden

I'm not sure what "Never Trump" means anymore, but there's a swath of voters ranging from reluctant Trump voters, to abstainers, to hold your nose and vote Biden. More than a few dozen. Maybe millions. And how we answer these questions will inform what kind of voters they become.

I think any Black woman on Biden's VEEP short list is capable. Which one are y'all gonna not drag through the mud on a daily basis for the next 4 years. If it's Karen Bass please let Joe choose her and move on. Cuz the way this app tears down THEE senator from CA is infuriating.
LOL Again, were any of this true, why did Trump wait over three and a half years until he was less than 100 days out from the election, and losing badly to Biden?  Trump could have magically solved all our problems all these years and simply chose not to? Right.
No. Absolutely not.   If I gotta start wearing goggles I am checking out and joining ‚ÄúTeam Hoax‚Äù cuz I am not gonna be doing this. Nope. No.   #Biden #Biden2020 #COVID19 #coronavirus
I question the foreign policy thing as Biden has this pretty well settled. But as this point Harris is the only one ready for primetime so I really don't see how it isn't her at this point.
I‚Äôm sorry, but it is genuinely impossible for any candidate‚Äîeven a highly skilled political candidate, which Trump is decidedly not‚Äîto overcome these types of numbers. He‚Äôs done. As long as Biden doesn‚Äôt suffer a stroke or faint at a campaign event, he‚Äôs the next president.

This is very perceptive and awful. Of course if Biden is POTUS, whatever should be done to pump the economy &amp; to help people survive will be fought more vigorously by Rs, but if Ds control both houses  can get the help &amp; support our nation is straining for. We must vote.
That‚Äôs one of the things I don‚Äôt understand about MAGAs: they refuse to see what‚Äôs in front of them. Although photos can be faked, that one didn‚Äôt look fake to me. Another item: when Biden wins, if he effs up, I don‚Äôt have a problem calling him on it.

Of course not. We looked at this in impeachment. There was nothing there then and there is nothing there now.
Me on my way to a conversation about Biden‚Äôs VP:
&gt; Trump has shown himself susceptible to rope-a-dope.  &gt; A Biden VP choice who has the skills to goad Trump into throwing punches at her will lead to more rope-a-dope. (Kaine didn't have such skills.)  &gt; So yes, the choice could be consequential.
This is the dream. Newsom appointing someone from the CA delegation if he picks Harris.  A little boy can dream about Senator Schiff leading a post-Trump bicameral truth commission during the early years of the Biden administration

Biden likely to name his running mate in second week of August
The most important reason Joe Biden should pick the right Vice Presidential candidate is to win.  If it's the wrong choice it could cause him to stumble in the polls.  But a good choice for the Vice Presidential candidate can campaign effectively with him to a win.
Biden has said he only plans to serve for a single term, shouldn‚Äôt we WANT an ambitious VP? Like wtf.
Self admitted plagiarist   who lied about his Law School Class Ranking says he can get Christian's to vote for him. Wrong, 1 of many reasons Christian's will never vote Biden is the murder of babies &amp; genocide after birth killings he supports!

Joe Biden and the "party of science" never miss an opportunity to push their alarmist agenda, even if the facts aren't on their side...

I dunno. Biden and Trump both want to target anarchists for political arrests, deny people healthcare, expand wars, and increase funding to violent police departments.  Maybe allowing Dems to paint themselves as the party that care about normal people for so long is the problem?
Biden is the guy. VP may be more important than Biden. Pandemic is immediate disaster. Climate Change is imminent long term threat. VP may have a chance to lead at crucial time to prevent 1.5¬∞ warming. VP better be a climate hawk, and not mediocre. We're out of chances.
Heck, Biden isn't my top five choice so it'll be hard to lower my expectations any further.
So you still have the opinions and thoughts as you did 20 years ago?  You haven't grown and evolved on these issues?  As least Biden can admit when he's wrong and try to become a better person.
Not sure how widespread this is, but some taxpayers with income under $400k will face income tax increases due to Biden's 28% cap on itemized deductions.  This deserves further investigation.

I can see that. Though maybe Agnew in 1968.  In any event b/c Trump is so easy to goad, my thought is Biden's VP could make a tactical difference. Trump's shown he's susceptible to rope-a-dope &amp; if Biden's VP can get Trump to throw punches at her, all the better. üçø

The only Biden potential VP choice who would be more of a risk to Biden than Harris is HRC. Either would give him a shove the first time he neared the ledge.
It will happen when it happens. As soon as it does the GOP attack machine goes full tilt! I am fine letting Biden and his network do the thinking.
Clinton and Trump traded leads a couple of times during the spring and summer and Clinton never got over 46% after the convention. Biden has consistently lead Trump nationally by a minimum of 4 pts since September 2019, and has been at or over 50% in most polls since June.

The VP pick is irrelevant to the campaign. It's about governing.  Warren's strength is wielding the powers of the executive branch. No one else comes close to her knowledge, skill and passion.  Amid multiple national emergencies, it would be foolish for Biden to pick anyone else.

I think the best *political* options are 1. Tammy Duckworth (we love the vets don't we folks), 2. Val Demmings (her brother is the Boss Tweed of North Central Florida).  I don't get the *jolt* argument for Harris since Biden won the nomination with votes she thought she'd get.

Many people of color were punished for life or for a large portion of their lives because of Biden.  If criminal justice reform is a key issue (it is for me), I don't see why Biden.  At least Trump did something about prison reform in the past term (still not voting for him).

Her health is one of the top reasons to vote for Biden. We can't afford to give Trump a chance to name her replacement.
When she is selected as Biden's VP pick, tell her to study up on her Bible lessons for her debate prep for Pence. She should be ready to point out his moral hypocrisy.
We don't love you ever for any reason. You're even worse than Biden and the Clintons. You're the least funny joke we've been forced to endure. You're literally the worst. Would've been nice to watch Bernie mop the floor with you.
I didn't say it was. I'm going 100% on the people who have been quoted in articles this week. It has been old white men. I'm not opining on the broad nature of misogyny. I'm speaking specifically about those Biden allies who have chosen to go on record about Sen. Harris.

Somehow I don't think we get to "the cool zone" through Joe Biden.
I have nothing against Bass. I think she‚Äôd be perfectly good at the job. I‚Äôm skeptical that she‚Äôs the future of the party. But if you‚Äôd asked me that about Biden in 2008 I‚Äôd have said the same thing. At this point I‚Äôm happy to just wait and see.
Biden was an awful presidential candidate ‚Äî twice! This is nonsense.
D stands for Dangit they won‚Äôt say Biden is 20 points ahead.
But the press process will eat anyone who is not a Biden alive
I don't believe these old white men (because that's who has been willing to give direct quotes) are playing multilevel chess. I think they are being honest and they are honestly misogynistic in their thinking. It would behoove Biden to shut it down.
It‚Äôs perfectly cool to vote Biden. I just don‚Äôt agree with the ‚Äúyou can‚Äôt criticize Biden because then you‚Äôre helping Trump‚Äù narrative. He‚Äôs not above criticism.
People: "It's important that Biden picks a woman, and even better if she's a woman of color."  Also people: "Voters don't care about the VP pick."
If we don‚Äôt have a strong head start on nominee and Biden can‚Äôt run, Republicans will absolutely win due to US yo-yo politics.  Biden only worked this time cuz he had been VP.  If we have a strong VP, who can run, we might get 12 years to undo Trump

If you think the VP choice is just a filler for the ticket, fine.  But if you think the campaigning skills of Biden's VP choice can make a difference, especially in what will be a brawl against Trump, then the choice matters.

'A classic do-no-harm strategy': Biden's campaign enters key stretch

2020 Presidential Election News Updateüóû: The war hero who could be Biden's running mate #Election2020 #News #SuperTuesday
(hard to say if the firm "law and order" approach has been helping him. The polls have shown pretty wide gaps between Trump and Biden. Previous concerns in Trump world spurred him to refocus recently on the pandemic.)
regardless of who the actual VP candidate is. There will be disinformaton campaigns from bad faith actors online saying ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a Dem and because Biden selected [name] I‚Äôm not voting!‚Äù But of course, that‚Äôll be BS.
Hot take: Biden‚Äôs VP pick won‚Äôt change the outcome of the election.   Whoever Biden picks, folks on the left are still going to vote for him. Some VP-related disinformation will come out and the ‚Äúswing voters‚Äù who are just looking for a reason to vote for Trump will believe it...
How much do you pay Scott Rasmussen?  And I‚Äôll bet that you sleep more each night than Biden does.  If you go any further to the right you will lose your hood.
Trump now alleging that if Biden elected the "chaos" in Portland will "spread across the land" ... earlier today, he noted that federal troops in Portland had been assaulted with frozen soup. (Protesters in Portland have suffered serious injuries from fed troops)
Joe Biden can‚Äôt articulate language #2020
But they do vote against the ticket if they think the decision showed terrible judgment. That's why boring types like Biden, Kaine, and Gore get picked. To avoid the Quayle-Palin problem.
Trump claims Biden will bring "chaos and bloodshed" as he continues to ramp up his rhetoric
My dad is one. Lifelong republican but voted Obama in 08 as he was worried McCain wouldn't make it 8 years and she'd end up President.   He voted Romney in 12, Clinton in '16 (he said he covered her name and voted for Kaine), and now is donating to Biden.
I mean sure but... again, if he views himself as a transitional figure, Karen Bass is much closer to a Biden Democrat than a post-Biden Democrat. At least as of now.
I need folks to realize it was debate and not a meet and great!  Obviously Biden was was not prepared and got his ass handed to him.  I just wish white folks would stop showing their bigotry.
part of a thread...and Bass having no interest in running for potus after Biden is somehow a good thing?
My gay friends did not trust Obama &amp; still don't. They were pretty pissed on how some gays were out there representing them in a horrible way. Some acting like pedophiles. Obama is a Muslim &amp; they feel he was setting gays up and Biden he's already talking about Islam.

Rare W for the Biden campaign in my opinion
95% of VP‚Äôs  or running mates have either been a sitting Senator or Governor.  There‚Äôs a reason for that. Biden is going to pick a sitting black Governor or US Senator.  It‚Äôs a real small pool - jacuzzi size.
At minimum it might give pause to her supporters who would have disliked but respected Biden's right to pick someone else. Now it all stinks.
Trump has been talking about Bernie Sanders extensively here. (likely as part of ongoing/wavering effort to paint Biden as extreme)
It‚Äôs not an oped, it‚Äôs a straight up Biden Campaign ad. They‚Äôre an IFCN signatory, which is all that matters when it comes to Facebook‚Äôs program.
Sen Harris did not attack Biden.  She called him out on his ignorant ass comments. Are you terrified of black women challenging white men?  I need for you do do better and educated yourself.
I take your point as an implied assumption that Speaker can‚Äôt hold that post, too, while courts clean up election mess. Untested. But I think she can. Then Biden steps in to assume presidency and she steps down, retaining speakership.
It begs the question is this what we should expect from a Biden administration? He‚Äôs said it will reflect the country. Does his VP selection committee? Who he picks won‚Äôt change my vote, but if this doesn‚Äôt stop now, people will start to doubt his commitment to diversity.
Some Friday reading from yours truly at the #FOXHalftimeReport  Biden is a Bubba, not Obama lite
Totally matters when Biden needs infrequent black voter turnout that you can only get when you put a black candidate on the ballot like 08 and 12.  Turning out the base (black voters) is the order of the day.
If this is Biden people its a huge mistake. As you say theyd be better served just not picking her. To do this &amp; not pick her makes zero sense. If they actually thought this kinda thing would work &amp; make us say oh OK she's bad, then they're only slightly less dumb than team trump
Remember when Biden warned us about how unprepared Trump was for a potential pandemic back in October?! October.

What‚Äôs the point of winning if he‚Äôs not gonna do what‚Äôs required to help the American people. We need leadership right now. If Biden came out for recurring payments Dems would have passed it already.
It's a dumb reason to argue she'd be a bad VP.  She'd be more invested in Biden's success than anyone else because her success would rest on it.  If your argument is that you don't want to anoint a 2024 frontrunner that's fine.  But ambition is going to help, not hurt.

Of course Biden is.  They need infrequent black voters that only turn out when black candidates are on the ticket.
Agreed. Who knows how long Biden will last anyhow. Kamala is the perfect pick. Berners are gunna sit this one out anyway because of Biden and because they hate, hate, hate the democratic party to the point of insanity and they don't even believe in our election process.

Also, didn‚Äôt Biden say he was only going to serve one term?  If that‚Äôs true, we want him to pick a VP who will be our next president.
My understanding is that they'd have an election for the seat or it has to go to another Democrat, not exactly sure but I don't think the seat would be an issue. Regardless, Biden said his team will look like America, two 70+ white people even if one is a woman, isn't diversity.

His team needs to squash this now &amp; if they're behind it, shame on them &amp; a major mistake. They'd be better off just making their pick. Now whoever they choose has to answer for all the misogyny that's been leaking from the Biden orbit. Harris is going strong for him like a pro

Biden has you beat morally and intellectually. As a Republican, Biden will get my vote unfortunately.  You should pull an LBJ and withdraw from the race altogether. Maybe after one of your trump-virus rallies....
If it‚Äôs Bass, then Biden‚Äôs pick for Secretary of State would be just as consequential.
Karen Bass toma fuerza como VP d Biden. No es vista como muy de izquierda pero: "She took a trip to [Cuba] as a teenager and issued a respectful statement of condolence when Castro died in 2016. Ms. Bass has said that she reconsidered those comments and would not make them again"
I don't know that Biden has to shake it up, nor is i think that true as to what Hillary thought of Kaine at the time - she thought, not without reason, he'd help soften her edges in the midwest and could campaign w/ Latinos.  It's just that *nobody votes for the Vice President.*
MORE from our new YahooNews/YouGov poll...  Majority of Democrats want Biden to pick a Black woman for vice president.   Top of that list for Dem respondents? Kamala Harris

Here's the catch-22: What's good for Biden may not be good for the Democratic party.  Do Dems really want to go into the 2024 election without an incumbency advantage? Or is the current crop of contenders not compelling enough on its own?He's criticizing vote by mail so his voters will vote in person and Biden voters will vote by mail. Then his minion that runs the USPS will shut down mail delivery in swing states, disenfranchising Biden voters and getting himself reelected.

I meant elected not re-elected. Biden will be black mailed along with the rest of the Dems who are beholden. Therefore they will not represent us but China. We have to stop them.

He sees the internal polling. Repubs, as well as himself are going to get routed. So, he is going to do everything he can to try and contest the election. Do not be surprised if Biden wins be 5-10% and then Trump sues and tries to use the 12th amendment to overturn the election.
And who do you think is hiding in the Trogen horse? That‚Äôs the scary thought. What if Biden choses Pelosi for his vice. That would be a painful  out come üòÇüòÇüòÇ

OK, Fleetwood Mac...  ...the US has a great human rights record.  Capitalism is the best thing to happen to the American worker.  Joe Biden will make everything fine...you might even say he'll make America great again.
This makes me want to vote for Biden twice.
Biden was polling at 5.4% before the IA caucus, and then dropped out after placing fifth, behind Clinton, Obama, Edwards, and Bill Richardson.
That's not historically how it has worked though, and setting up new rules for a certain candidate to fail at is biased. Joe Biden himself was selected for the VP after withdrawing after the IA caucus in 2008. Probably polling poorly, which is why he didn't want to go on to NH.
That‚Äôs a silver alert.  Biden is looking for Amber.

Well, he is going to vote for Biden, so I guess that makes him black (per Joe).
This is why Americans must have a new amendment, that provides a quicker way to remove a President to daily hurts the country in order to fulfill his fury or make horrible treaty decisions. What Will he damage between now and Biden‚Äôs inauguration?
They should be shaming biden into getting better policies.
Instead of making sure Biden has progressive policies So that we want to vote for him,they are shaming voters . This is what is wrong with our country. If he is a good candidate &amp; has good policies then we would want to vote for him

Yes you're right Biden won't. He isn't even going to change the regulation to reduce his donors influence. That's why he is only better the Drumpf. Until we do workers will be exploited and we will titter back and forth between 2 corporate parties.
How does that him telling his biggest donors that nothing will change take on the structural imbalance in society. Biden obviously better then Drumpf and Biden doesn't have the conviction or imagination to address the issues the nation faces.

Actually, what‚Äôs hardest for me to believe is that the vast majority of people who say they will vote for Biden are doing so not because they believe in Biden, but because they are anti-Trump.  That‚Äôs cutting off your nose to spite your face!
Hilarious to me that people are buying into this rhetoric, that Biden is so left + so radical. He‚Äôs the most boring + moderate candidate they could have given us .. most of us who do support the radical left are only voting for him bc he isn‚Äôt trump. It‚Äôs not bc we support him.

The sad truth is he is about as coherent as Joe Biden. #LiberalismIsAMentalDisorder
I keep thinking this. But also... I'm nervous that if we do have an unprecedented, resounding win, that Trump will use the record breaking numbers as "proof" that they cant possibly be real, that Biden clearly cheated. How can we handle that?
The best selling point for Biden came from Trump himself when he said that if Biden is elected, the tv ratings will go way down.  That sounds lovely. A president quietly getting things accomplished. Vs the current #PersonWomanManCameraTv.
That's the point. They know Trump will lose so they will try to cripple the economy to damage the Biden administration. Same playboy as 2009
The "wand" to build the economy has always been there. Biden/Obama had no clue how to use it or even find it.  and common sense citizens know about over-taxing and over-regulating. #SleepyJoe #QuidProJoe is in it for himself not the nation.

I agree we need to stand with employees and working poor, not the military industrial complex. Unfortunately both parties have candidates that do not agree! You would have made a great President but Biden and Trump both will make lousy presidents we need new leadership.
These people are McCain and Bush staffers, both of whom were horrible monsters. However, it is personally advantageous for them to have that type of monster in power instead of our current one, and Biden is the best fit for their ideology.
Careful with these Lincoln Project guys. They are conservative operators who expect to be granted entry into the Biden sphere of influence. This pushes what we call "the left" even further right than it already is.
Also notable in here, while Biden is planning to make up his mind next week, announcement may not be until the week after that.

Or two terms of a President Warren after Biden.
Commentary: Why Biden‚Äôs choice for veep really does matter
I think the plain facts of the matter is you people are terrified of what's going to happen once Biden becomes President and we start hosting a lot of federal trials for Trump's cadre of crimes against humanity as we hold them accountable for this nightmare.
I remember when Biden said that. Jaw dropped. Then Obama said here Joe, be my VP

Why don‚Äôt you prove it? Did he use government agencies to spy on his political opponents? No wait...that was the Obama/Biden administration. Did he spread a collusion hoax for three years? No...that‚Äôs what he‚Äôs criminally investigating. Indictments are coming for Obama/Biden.

Biden wins Florida game over
How does he plan to be re-elected with a 32% approval rating and dropping fast?  Biden's ahead 16 points in the polls. And that gap is widening.  It's going to be a wipe out for both Trump and the GOP this November.
John Durham is going to indict big names in the Obama/Biden administration. Your silly projections can‚Äôt stop it.
Did he commit treason, like Obama/Biden?
Sure, now that Beto O'Rourke is out of the running.  Even so, Biden has made remarks similar to his.

Once Biden‚Äôs win is confirmed, the Marshals will escort him out the door to the awaiting paddy wagon from New York, with the NYAG standing by, a smile on her üëÑüòùü§™üòèüòé
Didn‚Äôt Biden say he wanted a VP that could be ready to go on day 1?   Wouldn‚Äôt her drive and ambition fit that description?
Yeah... in case nobody told you, trump inherited both the economy and unemployment numbers Obama. He then proceeded to run it straight into the ground. Now we‚Äôre here. #Biden #Biden2020 #ObamaSpeaking #ObamaIsBetterAtEverything
The Election is already over:  TRUMP 362 to 176 BIDEN  The Democrats have fuked themselves from any possible chance of winning in Nov. The silent Majority are DONE with the anti-America CANCEL CULTURE, BLM, ANTIFA, Riots, White guilt, Tyranny, Face Diapers, MSM, &amp; Shutdowns!
This is a campaign rally and a time to lie about Biden!  He wants voter ID...I gave my ID when I registered to vote!  They send me my ballot because I am registered!  He is stupid!  Btw wasn‚Äôt this a coronavirus briefing?  ü§î

Maybe he caught what Biden‚Äôs got. Lol
Ok. Here you go. Biden in a landslide.  Thanks for your participation.
Would the indictment of John Brennan implicate Obama/Biden?
He‚Äôs cleared and exonerated. Obama not so much.
This is the best Biden ad I have seen all year!
He will be indicted. His indictment implicates Obama/Biden. Say goodbye to the democrat party.
Democrat??????? This guy is not representing his constituents, using the Democrat cover and belittling Democrat Biden.
I‚Äôll go with the IG report. 17 violations, that‚Äôs a conspiracy by the Obama/Biden administration.
Short list of crimes by Obama/Biden and Mueller in the Flynn case.
Just wait for what other drugs will be in the White House if Biden gets elected.  (Aka Kamala Harris laughing about using pot)  Those with the code to the nuclear button should not be allowed to use it while under the influence. More dangerous than DUI.
Thanks Tom, one of the few Republicans with any balls left.  Cheating China has to be stopped and God help us if the Feckless Biden my time Biden wins.  You may hate Trump but China will destroy this country and economy quickly if not held accountable.
What‚Äôre the odds that these sneaky Democrats don‚Äôt let Biden debate Trump ?
Rick, you should be more worried about Biden's mental condition.
If it included renouncing US citizenship, leaving and never setting foot in the country again.....maybe.
This is my biggest fear right now....it's scary that people are even contemplating this, this is how bad a president he is
Biden might not make it until December..

Federal judges are appointed for a lifetime. Without a sane, intelligent, person appointing them, we get more kavanaughs and we get them for DECADES.  It's not the next 4 years. it's not even Biden. It's the courts for the whole next generation.

You‚Äôre going to vote for dementia trodden Biden? Wtf- you all don‚Äôt like Trump because he speaks the way it is. He isn‚Äôt holding your hand while fucking you over! GO TRUMP!!!
Well far left people are just as nuts and stupid as far right people. Just like all the crazy Bernie Bros who refused to vote for Hillary and won‚Äôt for Biden.
Who should Joe Biden pick to be his VP? Take the survey today! --&gt;  via  false
No he‚Äôs not. Yet, that‚Äôs your excuse for the crimes committed by the Obama/Biden administration?
The crimes committed by the Obama/Biden administration are self inflicted too. Indictments don‚Äôt care how you feel about the election.
How ironic. The author claims Trump is ushering in a totalitarian regime, yet completely ignores the fascist behavior of Obama/Biden administration. Using government agencies to spy on and use a fake narrative to have Trump removed from office with a coup. What an absolute moron.
One of the things I appreciate about Joe Biden right now is that his voice is quiet.  I like having a president who isn't belligerent.
I expect indictments before September, with well known names from the Obama/Biden administration. Democrats will destroyed all the way down the ballot.
A timeline of corruption.
I‚Äôve never followed Q. It‚Äôs easily available in the public domain. Here‚Äôs a short list of crimes by Obama/Biden and Mueller.
My Pres Trump legalized weed to win the election theory might just play out. Lookout.  Democrats Wimp Out on Federal Marijuana Legalization. Thanks, Joe Biden! ‚Äì

Wait till the tables are turned under a Biden Presidency and we start kidnapping people like you for no reason.
I had a similar one in mind...but yours is better...so I abandon the field to youüòâ
Hey,  I bet Biden can throw a decent pitch.
He's not going to prison under Trump...but under Biden, he will. Trump can't pardon him then. And Trump knows he's got a good chance of going to prison under a Democratic presidency.
Id say vote for biden and flank him from the left with grassroots protest.  Nobody is even talking about Howie Hawkins and the green party.  And he has a black women for a running mate. But I dont see a presidency in their future unless they get more local greens elected
I think so also. Biden knows her so well &amp; there is no doubt he would feel comfortable with her.
Funny, everytime 45 says something stupid, senile, and racist it's a "joke," according to his aides (enablers) which happens quite often. Biden calls it a joke in this very speech but he's insane? ü§îü§£üò∑üåä
I agree - if he did say this, it's disgusting. Not sure how this will help ur argument re Biden today - because the Biden of today is what matters, just like the 45th President of TODAY is what matters. Just wear ur mask &amp; take a seat, fool! üôÑüåäüò∑
Imagine if Biden, Hillary, or Obama did this? The GOP would absolutely *riot*.

anyone with common sense would NEVER vote Biden, as he has none.   If you vote Biden you are not getting Biden you are getting who 'they' want you to get.
Trump didn't make this country crazy. The Marxist movement disguised as BLM / Antifa did that, along with the help of leftist dingbats like Obama, Pelosi, and HRC. Remember her? She's the idiot the libs put up last election. She was a bad Choice. And so is Biden. Wake up.
Biden should call out Trump for saying Kung-flu and then call it Knockout Game-flu, so conservatives take it seriously.
Is that really what Fox News has you thinking? It‚Äôs one block in Portland. It was a few peaceful blocks in Seattle. I live in Wa. Fox is lying to you about ‚ÄúRiots‚Äù.   This happened under trump. Not Biden, not Obama. This is trumps America you idiot.
Nobody wants to come here right now. We‚Äôre the joke of the world. We‚Äôre 3rd world rn. Keep talking about how the dems are gonna ruin everything. This country is on fire and Biden didn‚Äôt touch a thing. This was lil donny all the way.

The man who told millions of Americans,"you ain't black," and used the term "Blafrican American," said that OUR President is RACIST.   Joe Biden has ABSOLUTELY lost his mind. President Trump is a champion for Black Voices. He always has been and he always will be.
And I worry that screamy orange grandpa won‚Äôt let go even if Biden does manage to win
I say that Joe Biden starts talking to his people about getting a grip on the rioting and destruction and get his fellow Democrats to wake the hell up and realize that citizens lives are being destroyed!
The fringe left is threatening a voter rebellion against the DNC and Biden for not supporting M4A.
You guys who want to rebel against the Democrats and Biden over expanding Medicare are just consigning all of us in America to a certain death.  We have much bigger fish to fry than this shit.
I could've told you that with the first State Primary for the Democrats. They went hardcore for Biden, who's a Corporate Democrat, while Bernie gets marginalized again.  Frankly, once 2020 Election is over, I say we knock the chair out from under the Dems.
We will ‚Äî by electing Biden in November!
Trump doesn‚Äôt come close to what Obama and Biden accomplished. In fact, he‚Äôs going in the opposite direction.
#OpenTheDebates  won the primary within the #Libertarian party just like Biden did in his races, Trump got the incumbent pass. #LetHerDebate #VoteGold #LetUsVote More people need to hear her message of #Liberty especially those turned off to politics.
I hope more people are voting for Biden. Most of the people I have talked to are staying with Trump. I know our State is primarily Democrat. I hope other will change. We don't need another 2016.
God will ensure The electoral Landslide is so huge that it cannot be disputed. It will be somewhere in the Ballpark of 363-400 Trump and 167-144 Biden. Trust me on this. IT WILL BE BIBLICAL!!

My point is that a Biden administration has better seriously go to bat for the working class, immediately, because the voters will make him pay in 2024 if he doesn‚Äôt, just like they did after Obama to give us Trump  OF COURSE I‚Äôm not saying Biden will be worse than Trump

For those of you freaking out because many of us are demanding that Biden be a better candidate  Remember that Tom Cotton is waiting to pick up after Biden‚Äôs failures in 2024  Trump is NOT the worst it could get   Cotton has an agenda

I'm a betting man: Biden's presidency will last only one term if the above goals are met, and will be replaced with a more moderate, open-minded, non-corporatist politician, but the best opportunity would be to hijack the Democrat platform by 2028 and push out the corporatists.
A Vote for Biden is a Vote for Treason. #Communism and #Socialism is a real threat to our Nation and Liberty.
Biden was instrumental in forming this police state.
I hope Biden will tear it down. Loved to see the White House back when I was proud.
Remember when you promised you wouldn‚Äôt lie to us? We knew that was a lie in itself but I couldn‚Äôt comprehend the outright blasphemous crap that would spew from your revolting neck!  #KayleighMcEnany #Biden #Biden2020Landslide #Biden2020ToSaveAmerica
Entirely missing the point unfortunately  Nobody wants Trump to remain in office  But saying we can‚Äôt expect any better out of Biden  Or that we can‚Äôt oppose government corruption  Simply nonsensical
Malarkey is at an all time high Joe Biden is on the ballot Can I make it any more obvious?
This evening's episode of Juxtaposition Jollies...... trump tweets that the Wall of Mom's in Portland is a scam  meanwhile  There's a guy on CNN trying to make the point that Joe Biden's election prospects may be hampered by voting for the Iraq War back in 2002.
If he does it through private insurance people will be underserved just like they are right now  Of course I‚Äôm really running for office  I am 100% oppositional to Trump. But to say we can‚Äôt do better than what Biden is offering is wrong

I hope you are right about Biden and the tsunami. Remember 2016. Hillary was a shoo-in and you know what happened. PLEASE VOTE BLUE in November.
Looks like Biden‚Äôs lead has shrunk. That‚Äôs not good, means tRump is closing the margins through his insighting violence. Not good folks!

Democrats! Joe Biden‚Äôs supporters !
I learned my lesson in 2016. Believe zero polls and vote as if your life or the lives of others depends on it. Stop announcing this crap and work like Biden is down 15 points.
Followed Biden some time ago. Wish the entire resistance would.
I told her that it would seal the deal for Biden  She was mad at some ppl down the street gathering sigs to get Howie Hawkins on the ballot  Said a non Biden vote is a vote for Trump  Said it was close for Clinton in WA (wrong, 54-38)  Blamed Bernie for HRC loss  These ppl exist
At the market today I only had one negative interaction, with a VBNMW woman  She said we can‚Äôt ask Biden to support M4A b/c then Trump will win  At the point you can‚Äôt ask your candidates to be better for fear of losing  You‚Äôve already lost   smdh
Take my $2400 again too--since this is based on the last stimulus check requirements.  But I'm still voting for Biden.

When Biden is President, be ready to re-enlist.  You were shafted, man.
Yeah, how‚Äôs that false rumor working for you? You know, the one that‚Äôs about as verified as the fake dossier that Obama/Biden used to falsify a FISA warrant.
Indictments are coming for the Obama/Biden administration.
Jail? For what exactly? I don‚Äôt remember him spying on his opponent and a coup, like Obama/Biden did.
Joe Biden really should volunteer to take a cognitive assessment as Trump did, but do give the old man an easy list of words, like maybe, "Smooch - Sniff - Girl - Woman - Hair."
The indictments of the Obama/Biden administration are gonna be rough on the down ticket democrats too. Just a short list of crimes;
Repost stump_politics Dumbass of the Day Award goes to this Trump strategist, who used a video from the chaos of Trump‚Äôs America.. to try and scare people of Biden?
Biden has to debate Trump first. That‚Äôs not gonna go well for Biden. Landslide for Trump, easily.
Are you telling me that Biden will win the long war?  There‚Äôs only one war. Class war  ‚ÄúNothing will fundamentally change‚Äù  His words, not mine ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Honestly. Last time we relaxed we ended up with Biden as our nominee. Be sure to vote Biden if you don't want an even bigger mistake in November.
We‚Äôre back to the list of crimes by the Obama/Biden administration and Mueller. It‚Äôs certainly not rocket science, it‚Äôs elementary and obvious, at this point.
Flynn contact with foreign dignitaries is perfectly appropriate during a transition. We have evidence, in the public sphere, of targeting by the Obama/Biden administration, to illegally entrap Flynn with fake crimes.

And when Biden sends DHS agents to WA, OR, ID, and rural southern areas, what will you say? Will you still cheer for the feds?
Texas for Biden..... Stop the earth #Trump2020
Have you seen these documents? It‚Äôs the 108 page DOJ dismissal filing in the Flynn case. It reads like an indictment of the Obama/Biden administration and Mueller team. Most of this evidence came from John Durham.
Just saw a spokesperson for the DOJ yesterday, saying there will be, at the least, a report by Labor Day. Mark Meadows, said the same thing. They‚Äôve been investigating this for a long time now, there will be indictments of the Obama/Biden administration this summer.White college-educated women don't vote?  The better argument is that Warren supporters are going to vote Biden anyway but want reassurance that Biden will choose someone progressive and competent.
I'm worried that if Joe Biden is elected Corn Pop will return to assassinate him with a rusty razor
Dem Exit 4 Ever #DemExit #Democrats #Biden #Election2020
No, you are not. That is Biden‚Äôs decision, and I‚Äôll let him make it. Every person on the list can beat up Mikey Pence.
Do you remember who Hillary‚Äôs running mate was? Did you know they were when Hillary announced them? Biden can‚Äôt make the same mistake... he needs to pick someone we all know and respect.
If Biden wins and the Democrats hold the House or pick up seats, I think it would be safe for her to retire, or even withdraw from the competition for Speaker.
But let‚Äôs talk about Hunter Biden. üôÑ
Biden is gonna beat Trump by 10M
And your supporters say Biden has dementia...and you don't even know who you ran against in 2016.
Yes, I want to see if Biden is capable of something as simple as this.
Sure. We‚Äôll wait. I wouldn‚Äôt get a vaccine under this administration if I was on my death bed. I‚Äôll wait for President Biden.
LMFAOOOOOOOOOOO  Thats why Biden is winning like 93% of the minority vote right???
One important thing that's in this poll and several others over the last month, is that Harris wins those who are enthusiastic Biden voters. Warren wins the unenthusiastic ones ~ ie: Warren brings him voters he doesn't already have a lock on.
You said "go check the betting sites". The betting sites all have the odds in favor of Biden. You're now saying "Well...the polls were wrong in 2016! Trust my gut over all evidence to the contrary!" Hence moving the goalposts.
3/ This coming amid suspicions / claims that foreign disinfo campaigns against Biden are heating up.
I agree. It‚Äôs time for Biden to announce his VP and assemble his Cabinet.
The way it's worded and listed right above MSDNC tells me it's what [they] are trying to make us believe.  Pelosi and Biden still push Russia, Russia, Russia and China is no threat to us.
If Biden wins the nomination, there WILL be a revolution, and the left will not like the outcome.
Whoever Biden picks, let's hope for a hard pass on Bass. This is embarrassing.
Is there any chance Barack will be Biden‚Äôs VP?
I agreee. Very strong ticket. Biden needs a VP that could take over at any point in his presidency. We all need an AG that can clean up the mess, inspire and reform the Dept. of Justice
Whoa, Biden lost Ryan Cooper. This is a bad sign for the campaign, folks.
I‚Äôll tell you what I‚Äôm sick and tired of: White Male Americans in positions of power &amp; authority. IMHO, Biden‚Äôs choice for VP is hugely symbolic and important. I love  I would vote for her for pres. But I also love  and I think  should pick her as VP
Side note, it's been 3 or 4 months now, we can all actually agree that the Biden campaign ended #MeToo right?   The character assassination of Tara Reade was the end of the movement's fair treatment by media.
What's ridiculous to me is how purity tests that were considered absolutes in the 2016 primary, like federal support for abortion, were thrown out the window for Biden, a man who decided he actually "opposed" the Hyde ammendment a little more than a year ago.
Smh. Whenever I see a Trumper talking about Biden‚Äôs competency I slip further into the Twilight Zone.
He still should have done it in March though, because now we're looking at next summer instead of this fall, assuming a Biden win.  Neither party is good here, but my criticisms of Democrats should not be considered endorsements of Trump, who is again categorically awful.

Democrats love populist messages that don't threaten corporate profits, ones that do are less supported.   That makes them better than the GOP, but only marginally so.  Lots of people can't afford to go back to brunch once Biden is in office.
He was the WORST president to date we've ever had but if Joe Biden gets elected Obama may lose that well deserved title.  Get out &amp; vote Republican, even if you have to hold your nose on some of them. The Democrats are far more terrible &amp; without any ethical or moral standards.
If Biden wants an African American woman on his ticket, he really couldn‚Äôt find a better choice than NC Supreme Court Justice and civil rights lawyer Anita Earls ‚Äì¬†who unlike Kamala Harris and Val Demmings has been on the right side of battles over policing/incarceration.
You can believe that   has giving this a lot of thought. I'm good with Whom ever he picks.. I'm with #Biden all the way!
Are you sure that wasn‚Äôt Biden?  You know, he really liked Byrd a lot.  Gave the eulogy at his Funeral.  So did Hillary.
Honestly, there are many who will not vote for Joe Biden.   Probably millions.   Liberals understand that we aren't going to donate to their corporate candidate, and they only care because they can use this to excoriate us.  I'm happy to respond by voting my values. #VoteGreen
I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll like whoever he picks even more than I like him. I mean Biden is good, but what a stellar list of women!
Has anyone looked into whether or not the Other Biden is on the logs?
We ain't swallowing Biden, much less his VP. #ReplaceBiden
A vote for Biden is a vote for trump! Don‚Äôt be a part of this inexcusable problem
Most Dems know that the problems in this country are not all traced back to Trump. But the vocal minority‚Äîwho seriously believe Biden will save us‚Äîwon‚Äôt let them express any kind of dissent. Biden bros are extremely toxic. No one is allowed to question them because... TRUMP!!!

I think it‚Äôs about having experience at the national level, which is something she lacks right now. I don‚Äôt question her intelligence or abilities, and she is going to be an asset to the Biden Administration one way or another
1.5 million $$ raised at the Biden/Warren fundraiser
Kamala,  because of gender, race &amp; name recognition.  The amusing part is, during the debates, there was a clear disdain for Biden on her part. A lot of ppl think the DNC will remove Biden shortly after he‚Äôs taken office. I still wish the VP would be Pete.
Doesn't seem Portland is at all interested in voting.  No biden shirts stickers and when you talk to them, they hate hate hate Republicans and Democrats. There is nobody fighting for them.  So again they will sit at home.   Trump 2020  faaaaaaack
And even if the Biden camp had sexist reasons to prefer Bass to Harris, why leak them? Just leak stories about how awesome Bass is?
REMEMBER THIS, WE'RE NOT VOTING FOR A VICE PRESIDENT! THIS IS ABOUT THE SOUL OF OUR COUNTRY, SO KNOCK OFF THE BULLSHIT!  Whoever Joe Biden chooses you can bet he took the time to choose wisely! FULL STOP!
I'm excited to vote for Howie Hawkins for POTUS.   Biden could not earn my vote if he wanted to.
um doesn't matter who he picks. He will lose. He can't debate with big mouth Trump when Biden has so many damn skeletons out of his closet forget in his closet
Biden for president, 2020.
I don‚Äôt defend Obama at all, my point was:  at the time he ran he was Not the very worse. By his 2nd term he WAS the worst. As compared to now, both Trump and Biden are the 2 very worst options and once again üá∫üá∏ forced to choose the ‚Äúlesser‚Äù of the very bottom of the barrel ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
I'll take Joe Biden in a Covid-induced vegetative state over Donald Trump at his very best 155,246 out of 155,246  times.
We‚Äôre not talking about non voters though are we? We‚Äôre discussing those who voted for Sanders in the primary and now are pouting about having to vote for Biden. Plus trolls who probably can‚Äôt vote at all and only seek to sow discord.
watching you endorse biden is uniquely devastating.
Warren would be great, except for the fact that she is old and in the same very high risk category as Biden. Non-zero chance both of them die or end up hospitalized on the campaign trail or in office
His Biden impersonation is spot on.
Um I'm not a trump supporter or a troll I follow Biden and I don't agree with trump on many things.  I saw your comment because if you look up DACA on search it'll pop up cause you used the word DACA . ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è I was just trying to explain what trump means but I don't support him!
If they think she‚Äôs too ambitious, then she‚Äôs doing something right.  Fortunately, Biden doesn‚Äôt seem to feel like her alleged ambition is a problem.
If I see ONE MORE (1) story about Biden‚Äôs VP choices that makes NO mention of Elizabeth Warren at all, I am going on a full-blown journalism major TIRADE and aiming straight for these reporters‚Äô necks I swear to god do NOT test me with this sh*t anymore

Those primaries weren't over in mid March.  Also, Biden has been promising to announce his VP "soon" for about 3 months now.
I have absolutely no plans to get behind Biden.  Hope that helps, Tom.
So y'know how people are trying to say that Biden and Trump are basically so much the same in the ways that matter?  But look at Biden now  He's even oranger, as if the conservative racist within is rising up to show everyone.  I didn't edit this at all.
So where‚Äôs the pics of Biden partying with Epstein?
Oh no... I said earlier today that I‚Äôd be happy with Karen Bass, but I don‚Äôt want another 2016. This would definitely rile up the Q crowd with millions of deep state conspiracies that would really push the focus onto her and Biden.
Source is Joe Biden this week:
Karen Bass Kamala Harris I'm cool with either one, but I will vote for #Joe no matter who he picks. Let's stop speculating &amp; make sure everyone of our contacts is registered to vote, knows how to obtain an absentee ballot &amp; how to return that ballot #Biden
Amazing you would pick Biden over Trump. Do you not see your own freedom hanging in the balance? Bidens America is the opposite of individual freedom
Oh, Pew Research Center lists her as a Baptist. No? Something wrong with that?
Please explain how Trump is better for brown people than Biden. I'm giddy with anticipation.
And btw - although I‚Äôm still voting for him - Biden has recently pledged to ‚Äúarrest anarchists‚Äù. That can‚Äôt be allowed either. It‚Äôs just as fascistic as anything Trump does. Protests can be ugly but we don‚Äôt round up dissidents here.
No. By not voting for trump, you are helping to elect biden, but without voting against your values.
Like this tweet there Biden?
I feel like this but with a bunch of headlines of war crimes from Obama administration, footage of Biden sniffing young girls, that monstrous speech Kamala laughs her way through talking about locking up kids parents, etc could be fucking hilarious.
in conclusion, it should be biden warren 2020
I'm not claiming voting Biden will fix anything. That's your straw man, not mine. I said Biden is better than Trump, which is FAAAAAAAAAR from saying he'll fix anything.
The whole obsession with the veepstakes is hilarious mostly because Biden isn't even competent to make this decision, much less be POTUS.  #ReplaceBiden or #FindOut
I think Karen Bass is a Baptist.
It‚Äôs like Biden has turned to the balcony and Statler and Waldorf are heckling opinions on his choices...
You know I'll be voting anyway, right? Like there's local shit to do and it takes a literal second to check that box or not. I swear to god, y'all think I'm spending all my time prepping to vote for Biden or some shit.
Because the dude said Harris shouldn‚Äôt be VP because she rubs a few people wrong. That‚Äôs a standard not applied to male candidates, certainly not Biden. That‚Äôs called hypocrisy.
Why is it so many leftists online (not the ones I know in town) seem more worried e.g. Biden than they are about Trump?
Don't care who he picks....sick of the anyone but Kamala and only Kamala camps. It's Biden vs Trump regardless of their VP picks. Getting rid of Trump is the goal...if we get a great VP that is icing on the cake....won't be Pence so Yay!
Who do you think Joe Biden will choose as his running mate?
Hell no indeed!
I don‚Äôt see enough conversation about the caliber &amp; qualifications of the VP in context of a) a heartbeat away from the Presidency &amp; b) the successor to Biden (2024).  IMO none of the VP options is more prepared than Kamala Harris, w/ the psbl exception of Warren.  #BidenHarris
Yes, all of the other times, his VP pick is the 2024 Dem standard bearer, you're not voting for Biden, you're voting for 8 - 12 years of ideology.
Yes, all of the other times, his VP pick is the 2024 Dem standard bearer, you're not voting for Biden, you're voting for 8 - 12 years of ideology.
The question is, how would Kamala strengthen the Biden ticket?
"biden will surround himself with smart people!"
no shit. biden sucks. thank yourself and your colleagues for forcing his nomination.
In fact, it‚Äôs the klobuchar camp that is least likely to vote for Biden. Over twice as much as Bernie supporters.
It‚Äôs incredibly sexist to say Biden is going to elevate a woman to power as VP, but only if she doesn‚Äôt want to be POTUS. The point of the position is to be ready to be POTUS on day one. Rather than shit on Kamala for being incredibly capable and empowered it should be a plus.
Trump‚Äôs Poll Numbers SURGE Passed Obama‚Äôs as Biden Campaign Begins to IM...  via  Obama was the worse POTUS in my seven decades as an American &amp; Biden is 100X worse! Vote Red in Nov &amp; save our country from the far left Marxists.
I have concerns that she's not progressive enough, but I know that ship had already sailed with Biden.
Republican &amp; Republican-lite are the Wall Street approved options. I am hoping Biden will accidentally pick a VP who's vaguely willing to represent actual leftist policies occasionally. That way, when he can't finish his term we might sneak a little progress into the White House.
The [bipartisan] logic of a waning American empire &amp; the concomitant inherent belligerence to compensate for the perceived loss of US global power are the issues to follow, not whether Trump or Biden clinch the dog-and-pony race to the White House.
I guess there are some things that‚Äôd dampen my support and question Biden‚Äôs judgement after al
Top Biden Advisor: Yeah, We Really Screwed Up Swine Flu and are Lucky More Americans Didn't Die
the one thing making my existence worthwhile right now is watching shitlibs and pseudo progressives tear each other apart over Biden's VP pick
He's threatening to send his goons out if/when Biden gets elected, is how I read it.
Ok.  Regarding Trumps election scare tactics: doesn‚Äôt  the Electoral College determine the outcome?   So if those big states with in person voting and absentee ballots  results come in on time with 270 for Biden what difference will it make  if some mail ballots are late?
He is the antithesis of Trump, but he does not want to do anything with police or veterans or anything like that. We will get Trump out of office and then start protesting Biden a few weeks later. It is a lesser of two evils and I'm tired of the entire two party system.
Joe Biden can pick Kamala as his running mate, and bulldoze the trump machine clean off the cliff.
To my knowledge there is no 3rd party on the ballot. If you vote for someone not on the ballot, your vote is not counted. Its like you never voted. Biden has been in office before as VP. he worked with Obama.  He's my choice.
Though I suspect you won't like my vote. I won't vote for Trump and I can't vote for Biden.
Maybe even a "Fuck it, vote for Biden."
He's trying to learn not to be so handsy with women. It's one of the many problems that he shares with Trump. So, I know that you were being sarcastic, but it's not funny when it turns out Biden is just a less overt racist, old, white dude who touches women without their consent.
Biden you mean. Because they have no other means.

I don't think a single word of that is true. We literally nominated Biden to get back to a sense of normal, not because he actually stands for anything. Zero chance of any actual soul searching or prosecutions during a Biden administration. None. Never gunna happen.
Right, as if Biden doesn‚Äôt rub EVERYONE the wrong way...
I'm one of those voters. I wasn't even aware of the online movement at the time, wasn't on twitter yet. But I went from kamala to biden. Kamala had been the only reason I wasn't automatically biden in the first place.
who do you think Biden will Pick for VP and who do you WISH  he'd pick?
I donated too! I got a text with my Biden donation history today, and it's literally every time Warren has asked for $$, and only those times. Hope they get the message. :)
Yes, Biden all the way.
HRC‚Äôs VP pick Kaine brought 0% excitement.    made it to the debates.  She has a following.  She is tough and driven.  The only ppl that think that is bad are old white men.   Biden/Harris 2020.
"Grassroots donations are the backbone of our campaign"  And then there's this:
Still think there a slim chance Hillary is Biden‚Äôs running mate.
How many Biden supporters are counting on the implicit compact that he'll be a one-term president who then supports his VP for the next election? (i'm raising my hand)
We need a federal ban on tear gas use by LE against civilians, full stop. On President Biden's first-30-days To Do list. Chemical weapons cause lasting harm, are indiscriminate, and have no place in a civilized society.
Biden/ Harris would be unstoppable. End of story.
Let‚Äôs get these #PresidentialDebates going! The entertainment value will be enormous! #Biden #POTUS #DonaldTrump #president2020
Joe Biden will be too busy undoing all of Twitler‚Äôs awful to be on Twitter all day &amp; night #Biden2020
I'm still for  but I  will vote for Biden no matter what.
Where is Biden?
YOU won‚Äôt be safe in President Biden‚Äôs America. #TrumpThreatensAmerica #trumpVirus #wakeUpAmerica #Biden2020 #BidenLandslide2020
In an era dominated by authoritarianism ‚Äì Trump the wannabe fascist and Biden/Harris the jailer/cops ‚Äì¬†its fun to think of a left-libertarian alliance.
Nina Turner Speaks Obvious Truth: Voting For Biden Like Eating "Half A Bowl Of Sh*t":  Watch:    #HELLOsomebody  #NotMeUs
None of this is true. I'm not acting this way at all. What are you suggesting I do? Not vote? Vote for a candidate that will win zero states? If I vote for Biden it will be for harm limiting, since that's all there's left to vote for in that race.
No unity with either Obama or Biden, they're both corporate flunkies who don't give a shit about working Americans.

Republicans are planning a mass attack against Biden using information from pro-Russian agents
I blame the republicans who pushed for Biden, who belongs to that same old white establishment men club... I blame you, jennifer.
Just terrible choices, both of them. It's one thing to commit to choosing a woman, but Biden bocked himself in way too much by limiting it to a black women. Once Harris blew up he doesn't have any good backup plan.
Joe Biden wouldn't know "real leadership" if it kicked him in the balls üôÑ
It'd be one thing if Biden won because voters wanted him to settle intra-party disputes, but he won b/c democrats thought a white non-"socialist" man would have the best chance of beating Trump. He doesn't have any mandate to pick our first woman president, nor should he (imo).
Sorry. If it was Biden against, say, any of the other Republican candidates from the 2016 election I'd be there with you, but Trump is different, and worse.
what about what Biden's statement calling for the arrest of anarchists, simply for BEING anarchists?  Not saying this in support of 45 in any way. I just think we need to challenge all in leadership who target a specific political ideology.
By the time trump is convicted , Biden will be president and I don't see a future pardon for him .
I don't care as long as it's not Harris. I feel like the least Biden can do for all of us is gift us the greatest twitter meltdown of all time by not choosing Harris as his VP.
Joe Biden knows all too well how difficult a decision it is to choose a running mate. SO ALL YOU MEDIA HYPES, LEAVE HIM THE HELL ALONE &amp; AND LET HIM DO HIS JOB!  Do yours and report the fucking news, THAT'S IT!
really...Benghazi? You got Covid-19 blood on hour hands.. No one is buying the distraction....try something else.. Like Biden is the vaccine for Desantis and Trump Disease.
A conversation with my neighbor~ Me: I'd prefer a fisticuffs in lieu of a presidential debate. It'd be more productive N: or f*sting! Me: with hazmat suits N: yes... Just properly social distancey Joe Biden with has hand all the way up Trump' a*s Me: yes, thats the 2020 zeitgeist
üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇyou‚Äôre calling Biden a radical? üòÇüòÇüòÇ
My prediction is it's going to be that no matter who is VP. It makes no sense that Biden should unilaterally get to decide the future of the Democratic Party, and I'm confident that the factions of the Party that his VP pick doesn't belong to will agree.
I believe the case is Doe v. Trump (1:16-cv-04642)
The GOP protects landlords, and  aren't willing to do anything meaningful. It's once again up to the people to force justice.  Let's see how long it takes before  is asking to have these protesters arrested and charged.
Biden seems like he's missing out on a lot.
She'll beat him. Matter of time. If he gets Maxwell'd that won't hurt her cause. And  is going to get Maxwell'd.  should soon have a compelling incentive to communicate with a heretofore unimaginable degree of openness and clarity. Just a hunch.
Bernie was so left, they left him out of the race on purpose. Biden is not that left, we know, bc he's going to beat you. #VoteBidenToSaveAmerica #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica2020 #VoteBlueToEndThisNightmare
It makes Biden look weak in contrast when you consider what‚Äôs being said and it‚Äôs all the worse when considering that this is specifically a search for a woman VP
Reagan, Clinton, Obama all chose VPs who‚Äôd run against them and had even said tough things about them (even Biden!). Bush chose someone with the agreement that he‚Äôd almost be copresident.
Worried about what happens if Biden wins. A popular '08 sticker read: "Yes, we did" And in a wave self admiration America went back to sleep, while   deported millions, separated families, bombed innocent people, sabotaged "Obamacare" &amp; strengthened Wall Street.
No, I'm implying that if people can work the rest of the system to get what we want, Biden will follow. Nothing more. That IS better than Trump. It's not great, but since I don't believe in accelerationism it is, in my opinion, a shitty stopgap plan in the absence of a good one.
Thank god we have Biden fucking over the left for all these right wing/centrist voters
Millennial tweet Biden is very unsettling because it is so far removed from reality... it‚Äôs like a hundred rats inhabiting a corpse and trying to pass as a human man
According to this survey, American's top political concerns are the pandemic response, the economy, and race relations - all areas where this administration has failed miserably, among many others. #Vote
Just saw on  that Biden will pick next week. FWIW
Joe Biden has not had an antibody rich transfusion as the President has and may not survive  Covid 19
I have no argument against that. None. (Biden &gt; Trump) =/= (Biden = Good)
This is going to be the Trump equivalent of removing all the 'w' keys from the keyboards before GWB moved in.    Biden moves in while massive 'renovations' underway..
Joe Biden will be shoed in to office because  TFS suffered by    his republican supporters. ( Trump Fatigue Syndrome.)  Green New Deal will cause mass starvation on earth . over 3 billion people will die. Sponsored by the Sierra Club and the New York Times.
What we know ‚Äî and what we don't ‚Äî about Susan Rice, a potential Biden VP pick  via  Susan Rice is lucky she hasn't been picked up for treason, after the white house meeting stunt on jan 5.
We should save a LOT of time and resource and remove trump and Biden, have Bernie unsuspend, and voila, we have a great leader who is ready for today, who can handle the crises America faces. He has the best agenda with the progressive platform. We need M4A!
Ugh is Biden really going to pick Copmala in a time like this
I have complaints about Obama but he‚Äôs not a raging narcissistic sociopath. Nor is Biden.
Whomever he chooses, Biden gets my vote!
Dems are real good at talking tough about their position and folding when they can 'get something done.' I expect nothing less from Biden.
I don‚Äôt think either of them will be chosen. It‚Äôs either Harris or Rice I think. Possibly Demings.
i honestly cannot comprehend letting expanded unemployment protections lapse, unless the idea is to saddle the incoming Biden administration with a bonafide Depression
Who are they?
Gun control in America has a very racist history. Starting with ‚ÄúBlack Codes‚Äù in 1860s, Reagan‚Äôs Mulford Act, Clinton‚Äôs AWB. All were reactions to Black uprisings/excellence.  Biden‚Äôs gun control plan is to add $200 to pretty much every part of ‚Äúassault weapons‚Äù 1/
It‚Äôs funny bc at least 90% of the annoying ID politics shit joe biden says is just his interns/social media managers talking. He does not know what a person of color is
Rich, white liberals like  being more upset at Joe Rogan having more listeners than she is about Tara Reade's credible rape accusations against Biden is exactly why Trump got to be president in the first place.
It could be kinda cool if you were Biden‚Äôs press secretary
It didn‚Äôt look like much of a funeral, it seemed like a political ad for Creepy Joe Biden!
I mean both are true, but Hillary was DEFINITELY a worse candidate than Biden.
Susan Rice remains the most likely candidate IMO.  She could be Biden's Kaine.
I have, and Article II after an amendment in the 1800s states: The election will happen on the FIRST Monday in November, so get prepared to get destroyed by Biden! lol  And this is coming from a Progressive, ex-Democrat.
Two women, Representative Karen Bass and Susan Rice, the former national security adviser, are among the most formidable contenders on Joe Biden‚Äôs list.
There's something satisfying about using my unemployment $ to donate to Biden &amp; Warren.   We need  as VP.
Are you sure you immediately condemned the tweet?  Maybe you condemned Joe Biden first?
The fact that I  have even decided to vote for Biden should be enough for them to listen to me,  I shouldn't have to trek half way across the city into the inner city in the basement of some church to tell leaders what I'm concerned about.  I should be able to do it on here.
I'd gladly take the "Romney bullet" to have avoided Trump, but I think had Obama been voted out the Dems would have assessed the loss as Obama being too liberal &amp; moved further right w their 2016 candidate. Hard to get more right than Biden, but I'm sure they would have managed
You can thank Joe Biden for that. Really. Prick made the bill.
That‚Äôs your case for electing Biden?
They‚Äôre always threatening us with a good time.  This dude makes Biden sound cool as hell.  Except for the dictator part, but still...
Reagan was 77 when he LEFT office.  Biden will be 78 when he TAKES office.  Was that your point?
I'm voting against tRump. A "third-party" candidate can't win, so I'm voting for the strongest opponent.  I don't care if it's Biden or not, as long as they can restore some semblance of sanity to this nation.  I'll vote for who I want when it won't end the world if they lose.
i mean, what would they even say? "we fucked this up six ways from sunday, but joe biden is ANTIFA now"
Trump is not fit for the challenge of destroying America and implementing the Globalist Authoritarian Agenda. We need Joe Biden for this job! #Biden2020
52% of Americans believe Trump will not accept the results of November‚Äôs election if he loses.    55% of Trump voters say they will refuse to accept a narrow loss if mail-in ballots contribute to Biden‚Äôs victory.
What's the change? Provide the proof. I'm voting for biden but if you can provide actual evidence you will manage to change my mind.
this would be like biden making an ad that appeals exclusively to people who have a blue donkey tattooed on their arm and framed, autographed photos of them standing with no less than three democratic politicians.
Susan Rice, former National Security Advisor for President Obama, is reportedly on the "short list" of VP candidates for Biden.    She says the Trump administration was prepped by the Obama admin, gave Trump 'pandemic for dummies playbook.'
If Trump decides to not run for a second term, would you Vote for Pence over Biden?
Yes, and they came when Dems had WH.  And neither president was perfect, FDR had intermittent camps, LBJ had the Vietnam War.  Dems no matter how faulted move the country to a more perfect union. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm with Biden no matter how imperfect.

Those are actual photos of trump's America, moron. Those are the best Biden campaign commercials ever.  No more of trump's America.
Because people are being paid salaries to tweet for you  Anyways can‚Äôt wait to vote for biden with the utmost reluctance and disgust in November if we have an election at all ‚ù§Ô∏è
Talking like a baby . Just like Ms Ford  did . It is lies .
Google "Biden qualified immunity" and let me know what pops up.
Fortunately you've got a great record in insisting on realities like WMD that turn out not be true while calling people who point that out crazy.  Didn't you say Biden was wrong to suggest Trump would try to move the election a few months ago?  And yet here we are.
Endorse Joe Biden, Jeb.  You and W need to do this for our country.
I think he's actually just being old-fashioned. Because VP picks have generally been done in the week or two before the convention (usually because the Pres nominee has only just secured his spot too). Biden wrapped it up EARLY, but stuck to traditional VP timing
we are facing death and destitution in Trumps America! I‚Äôll take Biden‚Äôs America!  Decency, Honor and Experience.  He will surround himself with a competent cabinet that upholds the constitution
Obama Unleashes on Trump Privately &amp;Raises $24 Million for Biden Obama privately unleashed on Trump to party donors, bringing up past accusations of Trump‚Äôs assaulting women &amp; warning of his efforts to push ‚Äúnativist, racist, sexist‚Äù fears &amp; resentments.
As Joe Biden would say ‚ÄúYou ain‚Äôt bl...err a politician!‚Äù
Gonna have to disagree with the conclusion to this statement. Biden sucks, but he is movable. Trump is a straight up authoritarian. There's a difference.
Also 45 expanded these detention centers and routinely encourages hate against non-whites. Don‚Äôt be stupid I can‚Äôt wait for him to be voted out. And no I don‚Äôt like biden but 45 needs to go.
Will Biden just pardon Trump for some ‚Äúnational healing‚Äù and ‚Äúmoving forward‚Äù bullshit reason?

You make me sick. Defending a child rapist is about as low as you can go.
She was threatened. Trump's goons followed her and threatened to kill her family.
No it has not.
She says she withdrew due to her life and the life of family members was threatened.
Thank you for speaking out. He only wants his voters to vote by mail &amp; use absentee ballots. He knows he's losing. He can't beat Biden fairly &amp; he knows that. He must chest to win.
Biden has a private island and Maxwell's submarine is parked there but all the sex slave children are in the underground sex facilities at Mar-a-Lago. Sheesh. Catch up!!!
GET REAL! Biden never was but  IS in a position to do lots he promised and hasn't Look where we are now The stock market is down, again Covid is out of control He's seen to it that USPS will be hamstrung on election day. Immigrant children STILL not with parents

Love it when you guys try to play the dementia card--Biden is a doddering dumbshit and a creep, but your special boy? Have you heart him speak? Have you read his tweets?
When Biden's dementia becomes impossible to hide, and the Dems need to pick a new candidate, they will ask for a delay...  But they will all be on the record as against any delay.  üé™ ü§°üíØüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
I don't like Biden at all, but he's crushing Trump right now. At this point, it would take a colossal fuckup from him to lose.  Always a possibility when dealing with Biden, but his team is doing a great job of hiding him.
Thee is no lead so big Trump won‚Äôt try to steal it.  He is going to DAZZLE us with the bullshit he comes up with - before and after the election - to try to turn the tide.  If you think Biden‚Äôs gonna walk away with this thing, clean and easy, you‚Äôre underestimating Trump again.
Surprised he didn't save that bat shit crazy statement for the Biden VP pick and instead used it for the tanking economy numbers and Herman Cain's Trump rally Corona death.  Let's see what look over there he has for the VP pick. Couldn't be more crazy?
"I may not be surprise" that you made a dumb statement or that you're voting for someone who has been destroying the country for decades: #YouAintBlack #Biden #BLM.
no one disagrees that biden is a move to the right
ü§£ü§£ what a load of drivel and whataboutism. Never mentioned Biden, mentioned Trump being a mess, which he has been. Won‚Äôt be getting my vote this election.
And creating the usual fog of disinformation to rob the winner of legitimacy,while utter bullshit,will work with enough people to be an obstacle to Biden and all Dems.Unless,of course,people smarten up.
So any criticism against Biden is not okay? Justified criticism, like this? It's a dilemma that makes people hate politics and hate getting involved in society. The DNC is not entitled to my vote. I will no longer be in this abusive relationship.
Tonight! Join Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren!  They talk in complete sentences and have a plan to fix the country!!!
I understand the predicament, I too will be supporting Joe Biden or any human that can breath over jackass. That being said, Biden will deliver what the Country needs now. However, he is a Corp dem..ü§Æü§Æü§Æ
Biden has never once advocated defunding the police, and is the man behind the crime bill in the 90's, which he still stands by today so you're either I'll informed, or lying.
Biden is the guy who gave us Trump, Becky.
the idea that biden would be some sort of deceleration seems to ignore the trajectory of american politics.
i think what irks me about this "settle for biden" bs is that it dances around the subject of how democrats - specifically joe biden - are complicit in what they would define as "trumpism".
you have to wonder about the health of your party when "settle for biden" is a thing that's gaining traction.
i don't know which is more pathetic:  this hang-dog "boohoo, we have to vote for a segregationist" mummery or biden's true believers.
I‚Äôve been #NeverBiden for a long time but recently, I‚Äôve realized that Trump is as bad as the faux-resistance folks say he is. It‚Äôs a tough thing to concede but I will probably end up voting for Biden. But we HAVE to keep pushing just as hard throughout Biden‚Äôs presidency.
This all day long. I see kamala all the time on media and she never fails to say we have to elect Joe Biden. I haven't heard from Bernie at all.
Dude, just take the loss. Biden has dementia.
I get an email every 45 seconds from one blue org or the other, asking my opinion about VP choices. Stop. Elizabeth Warren, please. I‚Äôm so tired of her being the Hermione Granger to Biden‚Äôs Ron. Let the woman with the magic in already.
Biden thinks the pony express is still a thing.
He's just distracting. Joe Biden is not "radical" left.
Saw Obama today on TV! Just reminds me of 8 years of hell. No leadership by him and Sleepy Joe Biden! Thank God for the Electoral College.
John Kasich to endorse Biden? #NobodyLikesTrump
Besides VP Biden should announce his cabinet and other top positions this summer...that way "the team" can start working, planning, etc and can hit the ground running...including planning legislation for first day, week, month, 100 days...would help buoy the people's spirit...
No he is not.  Stop your Biden bashing.
Youre right, vote biden!
Biden has run for President approximately a million times. What is that if not ambitious?
I think I am at the "you could tell me that Biden invented Covid"   and I'd be like.. "eeeeehhhh but still..."  -stage
The weakest reason to vote for Biden I've seen yet. Straight from corn pops own Twitter account.
What a fucking joke. Its all such a joke &amp; plug for the prision industrial complex. Like both sides now have leaders that want to incarcerate people en masse. Link to Biden from the past above bc news outlets are too scared to say stuff now i guess?
This mom is voting for Joe. And we all want schools to reopen...when it‚Äôs safe. I trust Joe Biden will surround himself with worthy, qualified experts to inform us and keep our children safe.
FUN FACT:  Donald Trump got impeached for trying to dig up dirt on Joe Biden and now he is going to lose to Joe Biden.
we‚Äôve set the bar so low for biden. less authoritarian and somewhat more competent pandemic response. everything else probably not gonna change, even though it needs to change. Wheeeeee
That depends on how much longer the GOP can keep Trump afloat. If Trump  is forced to resign mid-August like Nixon was, Pence will appoint a VP, pardon Trump and mount some kind of campaign against Biden.

Swing Voters in Michigan gave Joe Biden tte Worst News!!
He should but he won‚Äôt. They hate Democrats so much they‚Äôd rather destroy the country. In Texas a vote for anyone but Biden is a vote for Trump. And Trump is an existential threat. Go figure. Bolton is the same - he knows what Trump is doing to America but won‚Äôt vote for Biden.
there are ALREADY much more progressive dems than biden IN OFFICE whp have been trying to make progress, but just can't get anything off the ground  the dems trying and failing vs the gop actively killing ppl is, still real simple math
Correctamundo...  Angel for DNR Joe 30330 is Dr Jill Biden.
plus it deff ignores that trump ran as a segregationist and 60% of white ppl said 'yes plz'  or that bush started everything obama "failed to stop"  plus the takeway still isn't 'biden will never move to the left and a vote for biden is a vote for worse-than-trump in 24 "
holding dems accountable for tilting right is deff an important conversatuon to have, but while mcconnell is still in power it, doesnt matter?  the v progressive house relief bill passed in MAY has been just sitting in a drawer  biden sucks but if he can beat trump AND mcconnell?
biden sucks but what other option is there today? vote not for him but for:   - rbg can retire  - aoc warren and bernie can send progressive legislation to biden's desk instead of mcconnell's  - slow progress under biden bs inmediate fascism if trump stays in office
You're repeating 2016.  Endorsing Biden then when he loses they will blame you and say you didn't do enough.   Pack your bags up for neoliberal centrists please. Just because Trump is worse doesn't mean you have to settle.   You wouldn't want your grandkids to settle..

Fine, sky high profits for health insurance companies it is, then.  Biden's pushing 78 himself, so hopefully his VP pick will be younger and can pick up the slack when his gaffes are no longer defensible.  It's hard to imagine someone almost 80 running ship, Biden or Bernie.
He has disappeared from the public eye as the first openly gay closeted GOP.  A perfectly divisive running mate for Mr Biden, particularly after Joe doubled down against M4A during a fucking pandemic.
Why would anyone donate to either of these 2? Biden is funded by billionaires, why you trying to take money from regular normal people?
OMG!  This is scariest day of my life.  This is truly a #shitshow2020 #Biden #VoteBidenToSaveAmerica
What happens to this information when Biden is elected?
Meh, probably nothing substantial.  Personally, I'm still expecting a last minute endorsement of Mr Buttigieg by Mr Biden.  It would be perfectly tone-deaf and out of touch with the electorate, so largely spot on for his campaign.
How can Biden have an aggressive ckimate plan when he owned by climate denying billionaires. ü§î. There‚Äôs your answer.  They are lying. The Left must not work with the DNC. It must destroy the DNC after 5 years of Bernie kneecapping   #KillSmaug
Nice try...it's not going to look like that until AFTER Biden gets elected. FAKE NEWS!!!
is it bad that i find myself mixing up joe biden and bill clinton quite often. they both suck
Must be nice to live such a privileged existence. I didn't have healthcare under Obama, I don't have healthcare under Trump, and I won't have healthcare under Biden but enjoy your future brunches, bro. Just remember the people serving you won't have that luxury.
I will proudly vote by mail for Joe Biden. #WeWillVote
Biden voters are too thick, propagandized or establishment embedded to grasp that he‚Äôs a puppet &amp;  they are really voting Hillary as stealth POTUS. That‚Äôs why his losing is good (DNC controlled opp dies). The Left can then   fight/defeat GOP. His winning assured climate collapse
I don‚Äôt give a fuck if Joe Biden is winning by 99% I‚Äôm still gonna vote and encourage people to vote like he‚Äôs losing because I will absolutely not go another 4 years of this
nothing in his tweet was about Joe Biden.. it's about #AllofUs..
Did you see Trump's 'Trojan Horse' ad on Joe Biden?  Neither did anyone else.  Meanwhile, whenever a new anti-Trump ad from The Lincoln Project or MeidasTouch hits the net, it goes instantly viral.  Trump's minions can 'review and fine-tune' all they want; it won't do any good.
I am old enough to remember when Biden wanted people voting in the Wisconsin primary during the pandemic.
‚ÄúMark my words,‚Äù Biden said at a fundraiser. ‚ÄúI think he is going to try to kick back the election somehow; come up with some rationale why it can't be held."
From a human who reads and is on the ground in Portland ... prepare yourself for tRump getting 4 more years. Don't get mad at me. If üí© don't radically change in 95 days prepare yourself for a shock.  And I'd lay my life down to get Biden into office &amp; I'm not a fan.
I mean, people are all "where's Biden hidin' hahaha", and I'm like - frankly? I don't give a shit. He's not embarrassing us, he's released some awesome plans, and...yeah. I'm good.
The second one I‚Äôve seen in the wild, first was a ‚ÄúFirefighters for Biden‚Äù one. That ‚ÄúSettle for Biden‚Äù joke campaign might become a reality, very much enthusiasm here against Trump, more so than enthusiastic support of Biden
This looks like a recent photo based on Biden‚Äôs hair style and skin tone.
Biden cannot think straight, the Democrats will use him like a puppet. #ChangeMyMind
The diff here is that Biden will listen to doctors &amp; scientists. When it‚Äôs safe to reopen schools he will. Your dad in law just decided it was safe to send kids to school, but not to have the Repub convention. So it‚Äôs ok to kill kids but not old white guys who are supporters?
Who's left to vote for Biden? Serious question.every week joe biden sends me a fundraising letter that asks ‚Äújoseph, are you with me?‚Äù every week the answer is the same. ‚Äúi guess i have to be?‚Äù
Biden has a wealth of people to fill AG. Klobuchar, Schiff, Swalwell, Ellison. But definitely Harris if she's not VP.
Can't wait til Biden is in office and all ills in the world get to be pointed at him. Thats how this works, right? They'll certainly agree, right????
Hang in there and keep fighting. You‚Äôll be around for Biden‚Äôs term and then Kamala‚Äôs two terms after. üôÇ Thoughts are with you.
Biden was probably a "graduate." How else would such a steaming pile get where he has been? He slurped his way up the ladder. It's his only talent.  He's certainly creepy enough.
Plus there is more than one video of republicans saying how much they love Biden. (before he decided to run)
No, Democrats take seriously a Christian witness and social gospel unseen on Fox News. Biden/Pelosi far better Catholics and Christians  than snotty dogmatist from EWTN.
Inslee doesn‚Äôt care about small businesses! By participating in the lockdown scam, he‚Äôs hoping to be rewarded by the Biden admin if mail-in voting/fraud allows Biden to steal the election.
That sounds like someone currently in the federal government or with history in Obama Admin., like Harris or Rice or Warren...all supposedly on Biden‚Äôs short list. I think winning is 1st priority &amp; selecting someone who could help with a constituency. Not sure who would help most
and abolishing ice dosent mean no immigration enforcement, it just meeans no personal gestapo like trump has turned it into
I don‚Äôt think believing something like that does anybody any good. Everybody just support Biden! Quit putting all these choices down. Jesus. He will pick who he will pick. All of this conjecture doesn‚Äôt do any good.
So what crazy ass Twitter bull shit do we expect the Cheeto to pull to try and squash the news cycle for Biden's VP pick?
I'll ask again: If Biden picks Geraldine Ferraro as his running mate, will someone point out that she's been dead for 9-1/2 years‚Äîor do we all just go with it?
Dr. Fauci - America stands behind you and believes you even though the GOP is trying to discredit you. #Biden will heal America just as you have tried to show what is needed to heal covid-19. Hang in there. We will #VoteOutTheGOP
Quit putting Democrats down. Don‚Äôt put women down. Just support Biden and his choices. I‚Äôm so sick of seeing people putting each other, or others down on the Democrat side. It‚Äôs crazy. Have we learned nothing?
And Joe Biden will make his choice well.
I AGREE with abolishing ice on principle, but i agree its bad electorally to run on it

Ok I‚Äôm supposed to believe Biden has the dementia issues when Trump is talking about beating Obama 4 years ago..?
Being the Trojan Horse For the  Radical Left Democrat Party Is the only job That Joe Biden is Useful for in his  Political career right now. #Sad
In the end, it doesn‚Äôt matter what we think. That is Biden‚Äôs decision. I just hope he gets rid of Dodd.
On the other hand, you‚Äôre so terrified of losing to Biden you got yourself impeached.
no, I think both Biden and Palin were picked later in 2008.
Dear Biden bundlers attacking Kamala:   If you have legit concerns about her, by all means speak up. But "legit" means "national security related." If your biggest reservation is "ambition"‚Äîthat is, if you're butthurt b/c she didn't kiss your ring‚Äîkindly SHUT THE F‚ÄîK UP.
200 bucks a week for unemployment sucks, so what if they blocked it. Your a big stupid jerk, and will lose the election to Joe Biden.  I get to watch your ugly face go boohoo, when they kick your stupid family off of the white house property!!!
Who said I was blanketing anyone? Joe Biden is a uniquely fascist individual lol. And go back to the beginning of the thread. I never said they were the same. I said one leads to the other. Biden is just another step *in the same direction* down that fascist road.
With Biden currently leading by a wide margin in the polls we might see this map come election day ‚Äî the Biden over-performance scenario: 385-153.  Of course, this assumes no effect from voter suppression.
If elected, Biden will only be able to choose what he eats I think.
There‚Äôs not a whole lot of Republicans left didn‚Äôt back Trump. And I really doubt Biden is going to pick anyone who backed Trump.
I applaud your interest in using your "I"s, though technically Hawkins isn't an independent candidate. Also, it's my understanding that President Trump and former VP Biden are accused of generic sex offenses, not pedophilia. I also am a non-pedophile "I" available January 20th.
Harris supporters likelihood of defection is the only thing that would make Harris a strategic choice for Biden, and they've already set up a culture that demands not committing is as good as a vote for Trump and worthy of communal ostracism.  That's gonna be hard to overcome.

Man, who had retweeting  on their bingo card? #biden #vote
You‚Äôre posting articles about Biden plagiarizing stuff as an argument for why he‚Äôs as bad as Trump. That is.... unbelievably not sharp, and a reason that your views aren‚Äôt worthy of consideration. Adios.
... because black people overwhelmingly got Biden nominated. It would be paternalistic and, frankly, racist in the extreme for me to tell black people that I won‚Äôt vote for the candidate they chose and will help Trump get elected because that candidate is bad for them.
My fav from Nancy is ‚Äú....it would devastate our effort to fully restore the Obama-Biden legacy‚Äù. A. I hope that‚Äôs not the full agenda B. None of these texts contain any information on how we plan on winning or how the money will be spent. Assumes donors are completely emotional
Friendly fire isn't friendly. It is deadly fire.   The same forces that love Trump hate Harris. If that money can't have Trump and Biden will win, then that money will fuck up Biden's ticket by sinking Harris at all cost.  That money REALLY doesn't want Harris.
For selfish reasons, I want Biden's VP pick to be a great orator because I want to see Pence get owned in the debates.
Trump already shot all his campaign ad footage of "America Under Biden".
Got it. Thank you for these. This reinforces my point‚Äî if these articles convince you that Trump and Biden are equally bad, you have terrible judgment and are a bad person.
Joe Biden helped create and voted for the Patriot Act. It was signed by President bush. This created the Department of Homeland Security. Obama signed the bill that allowed for indefinite detention of US citizens by the military. Trump is using the powers they voted for.
‚ÄúI‚Äôm not voting for Biden because of racial justice issues‚Äù isn‚Äôt a valid take for a white voter to have. Period.
I‚Äôm not in a position to apologize for Biden‚Äôs record on race. But, given that black Dem primary voters are who for Biden nominated, I‚Äôm sure as hell not gonna be shitty enough to tell black people that he‚Äôs just as bad as Trump. Or on the same planet.
#SeduceMeIn5Words Biden accepts Medicare for all.
If Biden is looking for a way to lose, he will pick Karen Bass as a running mate. He NEEDS to pick someone ambitious enough to want to be President.   Don't fuck this up, Joe. Don't be intimidated by someone who could outshine you. This is too important!!  #NoScientologyVP
Meh. Agreed. Still better than Trump.   Biden knows he‚Äôs just a name and a face. He even came out right and said he needs a VP who‚Äôs ready to be president on Day 1. This is all about getting trump out of office. I wanted Warren or even Bernie anyways üá∫üá∏‚úåüèª
I bet the Biden team has gone overboard in vetting people.   Who knows? Maybe some of this stuff recently is about that. Maybe they want to test this stuff out and see if anyone cares.
Watching Biden and Warren talk about their faith. They‚Äôed be so complementary.
Biden has said he would be a one-term president, so the VP should be a person with presidential ambitions.
Wouldn't that be fun! As long as he takes all of his relatives, anyone would be good to run against Biden. That can be taken several ways.
Harris allies granted call with Biden campaign after Dodd blowup
To be clear, I don't give a shit about Biden's religion, and I do think Scientology is also horseshit.  What bugs me is the pass we give to abusive corrupt organizations simply because they're really old.
Everyone: "Saying nice things at a scientology event is disqualifying, because they're a criminal conspiracy that takes money to cover abuses!"  Also everyone: "I have no problem with Joe Biden being a devout Catholic!"

While I can't stand her politics, at least  acted mature when climate protesters invaded her office.  choose to have them arrested when they stormed his campaign HQ. Biden also agrees with Trump that these #BLM anarchists should be prosecuted.
She was my #1 candidate but I‚Äôll still walk their hell infested swamp is ungodly creatures to get Biden elected on November 3.
We're not talking about Biden sweetie
The only people who deserve to be targets of vote shaming people are those who voted for  and the other conservative sociopaths instead of #BernieSanders. I'm not voting for Biden, I'm sick of voting along with the ignorant and indifferent crowd. #NeverBidenNeverTrump

I'm not arguing-- I don't need to change your mind. If someone on Twitter can convince you to consign millions of people to suffering, that's a you problem. I'm voting for Biden because I care about people. You apparently aren't, so you don't. It's simple!
I‚Äôm not going to ignore misogyny within the party. If you think that helps Biden, have fun in your silence and denial.
At the end of your tweet, I finally realized you were describing Joe Biden.   I agree.  Register. Vote. Protect America  from anarchy.   Thanks, Josh.  You truly love this country.
Yep, it's your willingness to help Trump get elected because you don't like Biden's preferences that makes you a terrible person. That's not "harassment"-- it's adulthood. You own the choices you make. Your choice makes you a terrible person.
But no, I don't accept the equivalency that, because Biden's policy preferences aren't perfect in my view, that his preferences and Trump's are indistinguishable, and I'll stay home. Because I'm neither a child nor an awful human being.
To the extent Biden has different policy preferences than I do, I accept that reasonable people differ. On some matters, I agree with him-- I don't support Sanders' vision of M4A, for instance, not because I don't believe in universal healthcare, but because it's a bad policy.
Your choices are to do the same and vote for Biden, or decide that, because your preferences lost out in the D primary, you're willing to consign millions of people to the damage Trump causes them. That's your prerogative. But you should know that it makes you a bad person.
Yeah, Biden won the nomination by pandering to the socialists &amp; thereby must be a radical socialist himself, therefore ‚Äúunelectable.‚Äù Oh, wait! Who was that guy Bernie Sanders? Talk about inconvenient facts, you‚Äôre reaching, Neil. Trump wishes it was Sanders so that might stick.
Joe Biden won the Democratic nomination because he got the most votes. As all of his opponents acknowledged. Because I'm an adult and I care about the people suffering severe harm from Trump, I accept those results, and will vote for him in November.
I know what scientology is. I'm asking which VP candidate is one? Biden hasn't announced a pick, and, to my knowledge, no one on his likely list is a scientologist....
Senator, wherever you end up in the Biden administration please never stop pushing to have these criminals prosecuted.
All the things you're afraid of, that's what they are.  If Joe Biden is elected president, they're gonna come take your house and your job, and you'll be a pariah on Twitter.
These white men talking shit are Dems and people in Biden‚Äôs campaign. They‚Äôre literally on podcasts saying shit directly from their own mouths.  You should ask yourself why you‚Äôre willing to believe white men would never treat a black woman like this.  Even when they do it openly
Voting for Biden is kinda like wearing a mask.  You don‚Äôt do it because you want to... you do it to protect other people.
I wouldn‚Äôt even want to work with Biden at this point. Sounds like a nightmare.
I think all the women should tell Biden to fuck off bc this selection process has been gross, and make him pick some lame ass dude while they keep floursishing in their existing roles, but they‚Äôre all better women than I am ü§£ I know they want to help.
I'd say they've accepted that November will be a blowout, which is why they will drag their feet on pandemic aid. Patriots that they are, they want to make things as difficult as possible for President Biden and the Democrats. Just like they did with Obama and the Great Recession
Joe Biden's going to pick Tim Kaine for VP.  We need a man that's old, white and boring with this VP pick.
I mean i know that Joe biden just isn't better then trump, like really at all, but if we have an election and trump loses, can we have a big party????
Biden is not falling for Chris Wallace rhetoric. Wallace gave softball Qs to #CorruptTrump &amp; didn't ask any of the important Qs (ie Putin bounties).  On the other hand, he would go for Joe's jugular. Joe is polling well, so no need to give ammo. Smart man, not like dumb Donnie.
Reminder that Jill Biden started the "Settle for Joe" strategy.
I don't care what anyone's religion is either, but Scientology isn't a religion, it's a cult.  I'll vote for Biden no matter what but I'd prefer another choice as VP also.
Biden's running mate announcement pushed back, likely will not come next week

This is not just a VP pick.....Biden will likely be a one term president based on his age alone. This is the 2024 DNC nominee.
Russian bounties has always been uncorroborated. CIA has actually lost confidence in that intel. It's likely false. I've seen tiktok used against Biden too. The fact that you try to turn this against Trump with ridiculous conspiracy theories is insane and tasteless.
The more ambitious the better. A fighter for progress. Biden has the ability to take frank advice and he'll need all the energy and good ideas his administration can muster.
And? I'm not Trans, but I grew up in extreme poverty (still in poverty), was abused significantly as a child, and have a severe neurodevelopmental disorder. I'm white. I'm privileged as f√ªck in comparison. It's privileged to think settling for Biden is safe for others.
That doesn't make sense. Say Trump is the Undertaker. Biden is Roman Reigns. You're saying the only way Undertaker loses is if bring in the Blue Meanie
Everyone SHUT THE PHUCK UP re: the VEEP.  I WAS SICK OF THIS TIRED SHIT IN EARLY JUNE.   Biden VETTED THE BEJESUS outta his candidates - we will NEVER know why someone was not picked as he is a gentlemen and will not spill closet skeletons.   NOV 3.   F O C U S!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Kamala Harris is reportedly losing favorite status in the tumultuous Biden veepstakes. Here's why.
Biden needs someone to effectively be the President for him, on account of his dementia.  Biden's campaign is going to force him to pick a VP that they can control as easily as they control him, because there's a decent chance that Biden will die in office.
If he wins, can Biden call fraud and sue the government like Trump threatened to yesterday? Then, while we wait for that to get cleared up, Pelosi can be acting president. Sounds like trump gave us a plan for when he cheats.
I bash Trump. I bash Biden. I bash anyone who is an idiot m including you. I'm an American, that's OUR right.

I‚Äôve been cruising along telling myself that it‚Äôs all just media looking for controversy and clicks and the vetting process and Biden are insulated .. BUT TODAY I‚ÄôM MAD.
...She won't be everyone's 1st choice? Has Biden signaled that his choice will be someone OTHER than Kamala Harris? Somewhat concerning, but please let's not have another 'Tim Kaine' moment this late in the game.
Vote Biden so we can get trump out yang ia not running anymore
If he can't/won't face down old white dems, no reason to believe he can face down old white republicans.  This has turned into a test of Biden's strength &amp; command ability.

What an ignorant, idiotic, claim. Let's turn it around: Trump v Biden = Fascist dictatorship v democratic constitutional republic (America). Biden has never been a socialist, nor was Obama. Much to your chagrin, Bernie didn't get the nomination.
I wouldn't even send Biden a stool sample and until the Democrats improve the quality of their candidates I will vote Green or Independent.
Are you having a conversation with someone else? I said nothing about trump. Biden is a better alternative than Trump and should win. That has nothing to do with what I was saying.
We CANNOT let fuckin trump get re-elected we have to settle for Biden any change is good at this point
They‚Äôre so frustrating. They would rather talk about Biden‚Äôs voting history and comments from DECADES ago and make judgements instead of looking to 2008-2016 when he was VP. üôÑ
Karen wants to go to brunch and stop hearing about immigrant detention centers and if you dont know how hard it is for her to hear about those things thats what privilige is. Thats why Biden's great because then no one will mention it.

Mehdi, get smart and stop this sh*t ‚Äì‚Äì¬†this right here "there is a strong case to be made"? what case? who put you in charge of those cases? First, you were badmouthing #Biden now Kamala?   Might as well come out as a Trump supporter.  VP pick is Biden's call. End of story.
Bernie‚Äôs chance was 2016, things have regressed with Trump and now Biden *is* progress. Twitter pile-ons, throwing tantrums at caucuses and protest voting is NOT ‚Äúprogressive‚Äù. üôÑ I wish some of them would be honest and say they want to be saved financially.
Um yuck
I don't really care. Whoever it is will be more on the ball than Biden.
With Biden you're asking for a very long neoliberal plunge at best and just as much authoritarian fascism as Trump at worst. It's not like protests are just going to stop when he wins, what do you think he's going to do?
You have absolutely no evidence that Biden would have dealt with China better or at all. Especially with his abysmal foreign policy record. Trump is taking the right steps.
You make no sense. I didn't vote for McConnell Jordan or a litany of other assholes. I think branding Biden as sexist is an unsupportable claim.
Because even if Trump is slightly worse (and he may not be) you get 4 more years of him, as opposed to a Biden/whatever admin where he steps down after his first term and his VP gets it for another 8 after that?

So $600 /week extra for a full quarter, would come to $195 billion, or roughly 5% of our entire federal budget. And that $195 billion would go right back into the economy generating GDP and revenue for sales and other taxes.  It's a no brainer!
"only hope"?  Nonsense. Congress still matters  Biden will deliver relief &amp; reform... less than the left would like, but still a vast improvement over Trump

All the plausible candidates have roughly the same issue positions, they'll all have four years to build a public profile, relationships on Capitol Hill, etc.  If Biden were considering Joe Manchin and Barbara Lee, there'd be some stakes. But he's not!
shitlibs always get caught up in the aesthetic and facade of the american empire and seem to just choose to forget that this is the most evil illigetimate state to have ever graced the planet. but yea let‚Äôs vote for biden so a dem will strike out palestine or iran instead
#TraitorForTrump Devin Nunes won't say if he got foreign info meant to damage Biden - CNNPolitics
I don‚Äôt think Biden would ever do that.  He just wouldn‚Äôt pick her.  And I‚Äôd completely understand.  After she showed who she was in the debates, I believe her.  She sideswiped him with what should have been a personal convo!!
are you sure i‚Äôm ‚Äúprivileged enough to not have to vote for trump‚Äù and not that biden also wants to lock me in a black box for dissenting agaisnt the state? wouldn‚Äôt that argument imply that there is a better choice ?
Now that Trump's hand-picked lackeys are in charge, Voice of America is deleting stories deemed "too favorable" to Joe Biden from its foreign language broadcasts and threatening to fire the employees that produced them
A gracious admission  Article showed Sanders polling better than Biden among *likely Democratic voters* but "Biden performed best among *moderates* at 38%"  Poll also vastly overestimated black vote for Sanders
Also, wanting to be President should be a REQUIREMENT for the VP job. You‚Äôre literally second in line and the backup POTUS.   Biden is gonna be 78 when he takes office if he wins. We better have a VP who wants to be POTUS!
The Seattle Times editorial board published their presidential endorsement for the November general election: Joe Biden.  Previously, they had endorsed Amy Klobucher, not just for the Democratic presidential primary and the presidency.

Also? Separately this scares me - we absolutely need someone who is ready to run in 2024. Biden will be 82 by the start of 2025.
Just so you know, Bill Gates and Joe Biden use 2 factor encryption to lock their Twitter accounts. This wasn't guessing anyone's password, because that isn't possible. This story is a joke and this kid had lots of help accessing a Twitter server.
There is too much speculation about who he chooses as VP. There are many talented women to choose from. But if they aren't chosen they would be excellent members of the administration and cabinet. It's hard to envision Biden afraid of ambition. He'll benefit from the energy
The Young Obama-Biden Chronicles.
Postpone the Election? That Could Mean President Biden
I was interviewed for the 1st time in my life this past June for the below article.  I learned a lot.  But as  is about to make his VP announcement, I think I should share it.
New Yahoo News/YouGov poll: Most Trump voters say they will not accept the 2020 results if Biden ...
It‚Äôs a heightened debate because Biden is clearly unfit and the VP will likely have to finish his term before running as the incumbent in 2024, which makes it super wild that they haven‚Äôt been picked yet.
üá∫üá≤Biden 2020üá∫üá≤ üåüHe's not Trumpüåü
Ok, it pisses me off that someone says, "I want Biden to choose a black woman for VP."  THAT'S CRAP!  I want Biden to pick someone with whom he is confident and comfortable having as a VP!  I don't care if they are PURPLE, male or female!
If Trump is so fucking terrible that we need to vote for anyone marginally better in comparison, why is it *Biden* that the Dems trot out for that? What makes you think that if that was who they picked, they give a single flying fuck about what we want after the win?
Biden 2020: Settling for you because I fucking have to.  Large bumper sticker, real truth.
When we are at ‚ÄúWell at least we don‚Äôt put acid on you while we stuff you in the wood chipper‚Äù lesser of two evils ain‚Äôt saying much.   Is there daylight between Trump and Biden? Yeah, but it‚Äôs the daylight just before twilight and it just keeps getting darker.
Biden doesn't have to excite people: there is *plenty* of "negative excitement" about defeating Trump.
And, as Rara said, if Biden is so weak that this pressure on him to be better, on the Democratic establishment to make even a vague effort to reflect the will of the people, is what makes him lose, how viable was he?
Who is CEO of twitter? How close is he to the Clinton's Podesta, Obama, Biden, et al.?
People who support Biden because he'll bring back the good old days are going to be disappointed. He needs to find a way to let them down easy.
This ONE tweet from Biden Oct 2019 is reason alone to vote for him. #VOTE
Why so you assume anyone criticize Biden isn‚Äôt voting for him?
And if you don‚Äôt see how marginalized communities that have been dealing with 40+ years of this behavior from the Dems, just not quite so brazenly naked, then *you* are doing more to help Trump than anyone criticizing Biden.
Trump won with a plurality  Sanders lost both times  Among all Democratic candidates, Sanders was the only one so ideologically polarizing he might have lost to Trump
That said, I think she‚Äôs a formidable senator, and I‚Äôm willing to be convinced that her positions on criminal justice have changed. Wouldn‚Äôt be upset w/a Biden-Harris ticket.  Plus she‚Äôs a fellow Montr√©alais (kinda) :-)
Biden himself wasn‚Äôt a practical alternative until just before Super Tuesday - what changed?
But so far as I can tell, having listened to all of these candidates over the past year, Kamala seems to me to be the best campaigner, the best one to have out there on the stump, the most commanding voice of them all. Biden can be firm and presidential. Kamala can spit fire.
Calling historical facts ‚Äúhistorical propaganda‚Äù lends no weight to your argument. Nonetheless, I do wish Andrew had remained in the race longer, but no one can say exactly how that would have played out. Establishment Dems did their best to undo candidates other than Biden.
Attack ad idea: Have Biden on camera publicly asking the question (every opportunity he gets) ‚ÄòHas this man told you the truth, about anything, ever?‚Äô And then 60 seconds of constant lies. Fade to black, voiceover ‚ÄòNo‚Äô as a big N &amp; O appear on screen. {fin}
Despite all the 1st person plural stuff, you‚Äôre not an American citizen.  Given your hysterical, baseless attack on Trump here, your boosting of Joe Biden, and now running interference for the ChiCom crackdown in HK, people should start being suspect of your motives.
Benghazi is old news &amp; endless hours have been spent on it without wrong doing being revealed. She's a strong smart woman who has worked with Biden for 8 years!

POTUS is pushing the vaccine. He said he'll have it distributed through the military. You trust him? I don't. Not that Biden is any improvement.
until song inspiration/new indignation ignite... WEAPON OF CHOICE (BIDEN)
Yes, the clear choice is Joe Biden.  It's time to clean house and get rid of the current corrupt, traitorous, grifting administration.  We need a president who shares our values, not one who lies and only thinks of himself.
At least Biden would be President to 100% vs iq45  30%
But Biden has been building so much momentum! How can you not get excited?!?
Good for this guy. But don‚Äôt forget‚Äîthis should be the default stance of every American: that this presidency was a mistake that bankrupted our nation morally, geopolitically, and in terms of our own democracy, and that voting for Joe Biden is THE imperative, corrective action.
Awwww, don‚Äôt talk about Joe Biden that way! ü§£
Joe Biden wasn't in charge of budget approval, or the budget at all for that matter - that was the GOP lead Congress...
N-nooo, literally progressives have HATED having to vote for Biden and would LOCK Clinton up if this isn‚Äôt weird right wing conspiracy. The problem is y‚Äôall politicize MASKS and make it harder to tell what SHOULD be debated and talked about and what should be shut tf down. Jesus.
Guess what, Dan Rather Not? ZERO positive responses to YOU, even on "Twatter." I see it every day. Same for Biden. You SCUM will use ANYTHING but DEMOCRACY to win! That reflects the TRUE nature of the Left. The ends justifies the means. We will CRUSH you.
This is kabuki. R's know they're going to lose big in November so they have no intention of making things easier for President Biden and the Democrats. They did the same thing to Obama in the Great Recession. Party before country, always! #MAGA
My assumption is that the Biden team looks at this and says ‚Äúnah, who else are they going to vote for‚Äù
but what's really gonna rock is Biden choosing to give his concession speech right after that ("for the good of the country", he later explains, "i did not want us to be divided any further")
Sometimes I think it‚Äôs disgusting strategy- get a black woman VP, and make sure everyone hates her, so the election is spent focusing on her instead of Biden. He gets to skate through the election without anyone coming for him.   But they probably just hate ambitious black women.
Oh, Fuck a duck! Come on! If you can game, tik-tok, twitch and scratch your own ass...you can google the shit you need to know. Trump is the reason you can't go to Europe,  back to school or to the bars..Joe Biden will get us back to a normalcy.
How Joe Biden got greener
Yeah you're right, Biden is making serious strides toward socialism by (checks notes) flat-out refusing to pursue medicare for all, publicly stating that anarchists at protests should be tracked down and jailed, and absolutely snubbing the left in favor of courting independents.
I agree Biden isn‚Äôt the best choice but he is vastly better than Trump and can work between the parties unlike Trump. I‚Äôm not insane, I‚Äôm just practical given options.
Biden picking a VP who doesn‚Äôt want to be the party‚Äôs nominee in 2024 is extremely dumb and therefore feels all-too-likely
Ukraine to investigate leaked tapes with ex-president, Biden is part of the Russian interference program. Ukraine is pressured by Trump to have cronies generate this can't see it but we have it BS. Deflect, Lie, Distract. Trump &amp; Rudy at work.
she can beat Biden off write-ins
The most important criterion in the VP pick should be the ability of the VP to run a successful Presidential campaign at the end of Biden‚Äôs term. It will take years to repair the damage Trump and his lickspittle  enablers have done.

What a nice inauguration gift that would be for President Biden.
This is some seriously good, imaginative stuff. This is something I really wanted to see in this election cycle where someone from outside the Biden campaign &amp; other traditional Democratic PACs to go after Trump hard in the same mean, downright disrespectful way he treats others

Trump is going to keep making this worse and run on. "Joe Biden will shut the country down making it even worse" I heard pundits say it over on fox so it is only a matter of time.

I've changed my mind a few times. Depending on whether i'm thinking about  Foreign or domestic parts of job description.   I'm looking forward to seeing who Biden chooses for VP.
We don't like ambitious, smart, &amp; fierce women in this country. Doubly so if they are black or brown. And we've got to figure that shit out, stat.  This is why I didn't want Biden to be our nominee; he's too heavily influenced by the good ole boys club. Be better in 2024.
Can someone dig up the '08 Veepstakes? Joe Biden was ... a surprise, but not a huge surprise? A lot of folks betting on Bayh, Strickland, Sebelius had an outside shot.  Was that roughly the shape of things?
If I were on Team Biden, Bass allies running to the press to boost Bass would be a reason not to pick Bass.  But of course maintenance of hill relationships is important.
K, goodbye crybaby
Check the Vegas odds, Biden loses because sadly the DNC shouldn't ignore the Progressive vote if they really want to beat Trump. But they don't, that's why they picked Biden. Corporate America wins &amp; the rest of us get COVID!!
We can expect  to Invite someone to come testify in December. After Biden loses a rigged election and Republicans are set to take the gavel from Pelosi and give it to Jim Jordan in January. But we‚Äôll get to enjoy some good Pelosi lectures about poor Dem turn out.
i've said this all along.  every one of the dem candidates this year would make an amazing president.  i really believe that.  BUT I simply think 2 old people is a bad idea.  if biden weren't so old, i'd have no issues with EW but he's is. and so is she.  it matters.
Joe Biden should address the Nation Sunday night concerning what should happen in support of the millions about to be thrown into the street due to the republicans and their ongoing program of serfdom for most of us.
as if the Biden campaign would use the official Joe Biden account's DMs to do anything.
And in this instance, the wrestlers did a really bad job at their fight choreography. Getting someone to admit for having voted for Biden is like pulling teeth.  It's like if the wrestlers were standing 20 feet apart and a mouthbreather next to me turns and says "Whatta punch!!"

The whitest white guy around with the whitest White House staff in decades is bashing Biden on diversity. Good luck.
With the old white dinosaurs gnashing their teeth, this is an even bigger opportunity for Biden with Kamala: to be the transformational president who ushered in a new chapter for the Democratic party, centered inclusiveness and true merit.  As big a shift as the 60s.
1. Suppress overall election turnout via incompetence &amp; underfunding. 2. Cripple USPS to make mail-in voting a mess. 3. Declare victory on election night, before most mail-in votes are counted. 4. When mail-in votes go for Biden, claim fraud.

From all indications, Biden &amp; his team understand that their early "return to normal" pitch is out the window &amp; the historical moment demands something much more bold. Another great  story.

Yeah Trump needs all 3 off 1) polls to tighten to Biden +6 or better 2) a 2016-size miss on the national polling 3) a 2016-size miss on swing state WWC polling, despite much better effort by pollsters.  It's not *crazy*, but it's *unlikely*
Why would you vote for Biden? You seem to be a rational person who understands facts. Or is that a persona you portray to grift? Even Tim Pool seems to be more balanced and he's a Democrat. He's expressed horror at seeing a Biden presidency. As confusing as your Clinton licking.
Every political party is imperfect, by design-- they're coalitions aligned roughly around common values. Adults choose the party that better aligns with their values. If you think Joe Biden and Donald Trump align equally with your values, that says a lot about those values.
I give Biden a lot of credit for not falling into the trap.  I hope it holds.

Absentee ballot and vote by mail are the SAME THING despite trump saying they‚Äôre not.   The validity and power of my vote is as strong as one cast in the middle of the Persian Gulf.   My daughter, in the EU for 15 years, has NEVER missed a US election. She‚Äôs voting for Biden.
Biden Calls For Arrest Of Anarchists  via
Nope
War is ugly, people who attack your nation to commence war are not given flowers and puppies as a reward. By the way the Democrats were the Confederates, created the KKK and even today Biden says if you don't vote for me you ain't black. They're also pushing a communist takeover.
2020 Election Live Updates: Republicans Reject Trump‚Äôs Suggestion to Delay Election, Something He Cannot Do  via
That‚Äôs right, Biden is racist.  Very good
You would think FOX would realize there is no "shiny object" Trump is not willing to use. Instead of making Biden look stupid, his April 2020 prediction makes him look prescient. We need a President who can anticipate the future. #VoteBiden2020
He didn't do anything. He gave up. He decided that not insulting Joe Biden is worth more to him than the lives of millions.
I saw the interview and you were 100% correct. He spoke over you and then cut you off, so rude. He also did not answer your question... do you ask people if Joe Biden paid them? That‚Äôs a no. CNN feeds hate and divisiveness and glad you stood strong.
If Trump was anything short of a full on fascist I'd be 100% in for him.   Joe Biden is going to be the worst president ever.
What is Angus King going to do when Republicans filibuster the John Lewis Voting Rights Act out of the gate? Throw his hands up and say we aren't going to do anything during the Biden presidency?
Stop saying Biden is a rapist.   It isnt true and it is incredibly insulting for people to use that term  flippantly for people who have suffered actual rape.  If you dont like Biden fine's become a Trumpster.  Those are your two choices.  The rest is just you bloviating.
Biden isnt a lesser evil.  Trump is actually evil.  Biden just isnt as progressive as you would prefer.  That is a difference between apples and serial killers
I want Biden Warren admin (had to get that in) Truth and reconciliation commission.  Who is America's Desmond Tutu?  I was watching Trevor Noah talk about one thing he wishes America would get from South Africa, and he said S.A. is imperfect, but the T&amp;R = race is talked about...

If the margin of Biden‚Äôs victory is as large as I think it‚Äôs going to be, I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if Trump refuses to leave Mar-a-lago for the remainder of his term. Cabinet then invokes the 25th and Pence is a caretaker President for 2 months, trying to redeem his reputation.
I'm hoping Biden wants to win.
If Biden gets elected, will he let Americans use a Coronavirus vaccine discovered by Cuba?
They being the Trump or even Biden administration...
Hopefully NO ONE. Make America Great Again. Vote BIDEN!
Project Lincoln is doing more to win this election than the Biden campaign. You need to step it up. You have the $$. Spend it. And why are you telling people mail in voting will be fibe when trump is literately dismantling Usps. Do something!
I find it odd that  is looking for dirt on Biden.  America has TRUCKLOADS of dirt on Trump.  America KNOWS he's a crook.  America KNOWS he hangs with pedophiles.  How the fuck are we even considering him for a second term. 1/

You did do the right thing and the decent portion of the country appreciates it. We will get back to having a leader with integrity. I‚Äôm sorry that this has caused so many Republicans to vote against their party. But, no way could Biden be worse than trump. Thank you.
Biden was a colleague much longer than Trump has been. It could‚Äôve been because John Lewis said ‚ÄúTrump is not a legitimate president‚Äù and never recanted that‚Äôs statement.
Joe Biden bobblehead for sale now &amp; I'm buying one.
Crock of sh!t Biden thinks we can't remember the countless times he tried to cut Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security.  What an absolute fraud.
That meritless Wayfair conspiracy got substantially more eyes on twitter than Biden's policy proposals. Anecdotal, but I think indicative of a trend.
Thank you for helping me understand! Whew! And to think I was going to vote for Biden!
Agree.  Biden IS a good man - we desperately need that now.
The only election that was rigged was the 2016 election that Trump stole from Hillary Clinton. That was the most fraudulent election in the history of the US so far. 2020 will be a relief when Biden wins! #DUMPTRUMP2020
Biden - we want facts over truth
I‚Äôm not reassured by the polls showing Biden in the lead.  Instead, I am appalled by the number of people who still support Trump.  It makes me very fearful about the future of this country.
woodrow wilson was a racist authoritarian and a million died under the 1918 flu and crashed the economy, his party still got 34% of the vote, hillary was absolutely right there is a large bucket of iredeemable deplorables
With all of the people planning to suck it up and vote Biden even tho he's a hideous and vile candidate, you would think if conservatives were smart they would start lauding Trump as "he's not so bad, he has pros and cons, he did good stuff too!"   But they're not smart, so...
We already know who JB is &amp; what his plans are. Nobody needs to watch a town hall, we just need to show up &amp; vote for him. Trumpers will now be so confused about when Election Day is they won‚Äôt vote &amp; Biden will win in a landslide &amp; trump will call it rigged (his plan)
So,  released a statement and tweet about John Lewis. Did Biden or any Democrat release a comment about Herman Cain that wasn‚Äôt a vile indictment on him for not wearing a mask or going to a rally? Unfortunately Leo, these people play dirty.
Biden adhering to the John Cena school of political thought
#TrumpHatesScience the vaccine will be real and Joe Biden knows that, a Trump lie is not being realistic on availability date to American people.     Trump has killed more Americans, 155306 dead, by lack of action and Covid crisis response - SLOW THE TESTING DOWN
As soon as Biden is sworn in you'll be like, the economy is rebounding extraordinarily. You have nothing to worry about, America!
Saw my first Trump re-election TV ad the other day.  Basically, showing nothing but the protests in the streets and saying "If Biden wins, the cities will be unlawful hell-holes"  Problem: Isn't this currently happening under your watch, Donny?
How foolish can you be? I know how. Another Biden supporter that doesn't know where they are even at. So 50% huh SPD. Who's going to arrest drunk drivers or murderers? You? Going to invite them to come over and camp in your yard when they close the jail?

The bushes are not fans of Trump. I‚Äôve also heard that Clinton became very good friends with HW and that the Obamas particularly Michelle became very good friends with W. So I would hope Biden.W may be a Republican but he has empathy and compassion like Biden. We will see
This page isn‚Äôt Republicans for Joe Biden this is Republicans... (probably liberals) against Trump. Please give me 3 reasons why you think Biden is better fit for presidency.
No. You either vote Biden, or you're voting Dump. It's binary. There's no other option. Sorry. Just how it is. Deal with it.

Yes! Biden has pretty clearly never cared about poor and working class people.
The same for Biden both Obamba andBiden ware as a fact not working for America but other countries. Obama took a knee and bowed to other leaders. Trump got so much more done in first 3/1/2 yrs then they did in 8 yrs. Let‚Äôs learn from that instead of voting for the failures again

I didn‚Äôt doxx anyone. Biden didn‚Äôt doxx anyone. Biden‚Äôs campaign didn‚Äôt doxx anyone. I didn‚Äôt vote for Biden in the primary. He wasn‚Äôt my second choice either. But, like every primary opponent of his, I understand that Trump is a danger to the country and its people.
People fighting Biden because they are hurt that 'Their person' wasn't chosen are a threat to our escape from Trump. Biden is being inclusive. They are trying.   Why don't you all get IN TO the lifeboat before you bitch about the shape size and color?
I was accused by a Biden voter of 'virtue signaling' because I don't like war-profiteers.  They have adopted the same terminology, rhetoric, and policies. The democratic party's transformation into the republican party is complete.
Trump has Russia working for him, Biden has Gen Z Tik Tokers and K Pop fans
A discussion here isn‚Äôt productive. There‚Äôs a choice‚Äî Biden or Trump. One is an imperfect but very decent person. The other is an abomination. If you don‚Äôt vote for the former, you‚Äôre condoning the latter. It‚Äôs that simple.
No, it still sounds crazy. Biden was ridiculed awhile back for suggesting he'd try to delay the election. And here we are. Dump was impeached, essentially, for trying to cheat another election. Nobody can be surprised he continues to try to do so. He is a constitutional crisis.
Correct!  Last week both did online rally's! Trump has over 300K, Biden had 19 people! Thats right only 19 people!! The NewWorldOrder have infiltrated every nook &amp; cranny of America but the public is finally wising up to their fraud over the decades!

No Mr. Biden we have to worry abt your ability to be easily manipulated by the radical/progressive left who push you to move their radical agendas.  You don't get it- WE don't care abt tweets. We care abt a  who will move America to be it's best/strongest =
I've just translated this using the high tech, next generation Trump-translator: "With mail-in voting (garbage removed) the 2020 election will be really accurate and hard for Putin to hack. It will be a great embarrassment to me. Delay the election until I can hack it?" #Biden
With the options as they are, there is no 'settling' for Biden, there is enthusiastically voting out the worst fucking president in modern times if not ever.
I meant elected not re-elected. Biden will be black mailed along with the rest of the Dems who are beholden. Therefore they will not represent us but China. We have to stop them.
He won‚Äôt get re-elected, Changing the subject did anyone notice how bloated her face is. Looks like alcoholism is getting her. She‚Äôll be sluring her words again and she is stark raving mad. Dems are held by money from China as you know Biden is on the hook and so are the Obamas

When that thought creeped in I began to look up some extra info on Hillary, Bill, Biden, Democrats in general, policy new &amp; old, the intention of the policy, and it in action. You start to really find out that these Families along with many that fund them have worse demons.
Makes me wonder if they don‚Äôt expect a Trump loss in November, and are bringing the cruelty before their party gets shut down by Dems and Biden in January.
No thanks. I'm not okay with China playing the USA, corrupting the WHO, stealing our intellectual property, sending spies into our research and academic institutions. If Biden undoes "this", I can only assume he is a pawn of the CCP.
It was also said that ‚ÄúBlue Collar workers lose elections‚Äù by a Biden delegate. It was unbelievably gross.
Oh, just wait until they off Joe Biden. The political exploitation of that funeral will knock your socks off.  I expect it to happen sometime between now and election day.

Biden wasn‚Äôt my top choice either. But because I believe that people‚Äôs lives aren‚Äôt a game and I‚Äôm not a petulant child, I‚Äôm gonna vote for him enthusiastically, and I‚Äôm gonna be clear in noting that anyone who doesn‚Äôt is a bad person. Period.
I totally agree. Vote Biden
There is no way Biden could possibly make things worse. We already had him as VP for 8 years and know exactly what to expect. I get if you don‚Äôt like him but Trump has set the bar to the lowest point in history &amp; oversteps constantly &amp; directly is responsible for Corona inaction.

Democrats first became aware of Ukrainian disinformation flowing directly to Republicans when DHL accidentally sent them the receipt for a shipment to Devin Nunes. Democrats reported it to the FBI on Jan 27. Nunes refuses to say what he did with it
Something must be done. BLM and their Goons are planning on attacking all Trump supporters at the ballot box on November 3. Saw it on the Internet today. I‚Äôm not joking this is serious! They want Biden in there so they can pull his strings. Joe is a puppet that they can control.

As someone who was molested and raped very young, I also find it distubing. As well as the attacks on Biden. As if patting a girls hair is somehow the same as raping her.
Gotta say I‚Äôm starting to feel better about Trump bringing back the federal death penalty. If Biden can win an election rigged against him, anyway. üò≥
I think you mean the center. The actual "left" doesn't like Biden or Trump's shit policies.
I missed *Republican* president. People actually say that like that matters?  Still not really comparable to Biden being the most progressive president of either party, the GOP are unusually shitty on queer rights for a developed country
...more than you‚Äôre worried now? Come on. Biden would have the most progressive healthcare plan of all time. Facts. It‚Äôs a start.
So  ... if 45 bows out but the GOP runs Pence, will there be a bunch of Lincoln Project conservatives that dump Biden and go for Pence? Or Haley? Or...?
This is the height of irony, given that Joe Biden has spent his entire career fighting against the hard-won victories of the civil rights movement. Not to mention his predatory crime bill that destroyed millions of black lives. I wish you could trade places with Mr. Lewis.
Joe Biden's pitch is being so boring a president, you won't care when his administration commits atrocities.
turns out you‚Äôre a fucking moron too. #biden
I agree. I knew I was born in the wrong country early when I was still in grade school. All this patriotic bullshit and talk about what a great nation we are never matched reality or history. I thought we'd learned our lesson, but nope, we went with Joe Biden.

Ditto that! We in Seattle will make room!
gen y here, I have never once seen a biden ad. I didn't even realize they were airing.
No I'm telling you that this is a tone deaf tweet that doesn't adequately reflect the concerns of his base. I've talked about his racism before. Biden's racism concerns me as well. I think tweets don't matter when it comes to how that racism plays out in action
Tangent: speaking of Black people voting overwhelmingly Dem-what do you say to a young white man who won't vote for Biden because he's "a racist?" I mean what do I say to him about voting third party. Or what can I say to him. Not your job but seeking suggestions
Hmm.  I'm thinking Joe Biden is a warg.
Well, wait until people lose their health coverage AND access to health care under Joe Biden. What's so sad and disgusting is that we had the chance to make health care a human right but rejected it, twice. It won't come again.
We need to act like Biden's behind like 10. The polls said HRC was going to win and we all know what happened.
That‚Äôs President and Dr. Biden!!
Biden would never let a trial of an ex President happen.
Do you suppose President Trump brought up postponing the election because it will be the democrats asking when Biden is caught up in an investigation against him from Ukraine?

It doesn't matter. I'm not voting for Biden. Nor 45. Both are bad.
If Joe Biden is elected will we see the take over of an entire state by criminals like what happened in the Capital Hill area of Seattle? Yes. If BLM forcefully took over Maryland Biden would whine about it but not much more. He doesn't have the balls. Never did.

Then why did you suggest the election be postponed? Even the GOP shut that idea down and said no. Biden wasn't the one trying to buy more time. You were.
They aren‚Äôt dug in the way that that guy described it, though. As evidenced by the Lincoln Project and similar organizations, a lot of Republicans will be voting for Biden to oust Trump.  If they weren‚Äôt, Trump wouldn‚Äôt be getting slaughtered in the polls.
Joe Biden's balls!...
Who are you? Joe Biden didn‚Äôt write this.   Plus, I‚Äôd rather have an active communication from a leader than a filtered fake news feed.

Good thing Biden won't be able to pardon Trump for violations of state law.

If you say you are not going to vote for Biden then you are defending the Trump presidency. Its not really that hard to understand.
The role of VP in the Biden admin is going to involve *a lot* of diplomacy and relationship repair. I think Rice is supremely qualified for that.
Honestly, I think a platform of ‚ÄúI will never tweet as President‚Äù would probably be the best thing Biden could do.
Thank you. I can't take  uch more. Vote Biden!
Kamala Harris and Joe Biden align closely on foreign policy views, but Susan Rice has by far the most direct experience in US foreign-policy making
So what are we gonna do vote for Biden who‚Äôs a lot more racist?
im voting for biden this time. it hurts to say that but trump is hurting the country. the real question is "how far am i willing to go to sacrifice my values?" im doing it just this once. in 2024, they will have to beg for my vote bc im not giving them shit. also
How about no.
We will have to hear bidans gaffs stupidity. Biden said for wemen to just go blast a shotgun out the back foot up in the air. Cnn praised him n adored him . He bows to China like NBA. But how many go to jail for reckless discharge of a fire arm. Biden should be sued

Whereas both  and  have stripped away the Constitutional rights of Americans that Trump has used to inflict his atrocities on us, I shudder to think what Biden will do to empower the next fascist. I expect these policies from Republicans, not liberals.
I see drone wars, millions of dead Iraqi‚Äôs and the destruction of the American safety net. And a lot of other horrible things. You are neocon imperialists. Stick to getting other neocon imperialists to vote for Biden and leave it at that.
Inslee keeps us locked down in support of nationwide mail-in voting so Dems can cheat and elect Biden. Then Inslee will seek a cabinet position (ü§£) and move to D.C. At least that‚Äôs the plan. Trump will win and WA voters will send Inslee back to his ambulance chasing law practice
And as for Biden, it's going to be hard to do anything with both his hands groping a child.
OMG, Ben and Jerry‚Äôs should make a Biden My Time flavor since Joe loves ice cream!
Assuming the GOP can't rig the election, Biden will be sworn in somewhere by a Federal judge at noon on Inauguration Day. The he'll pick up the phone, and make a call as Commander-in--Chief which will result in trump being dragged out.
This is Trumps America NOT Biden (although it will become Bidens if he gets elected)
If Biden is inaugurated in January, can he fire this schmuck?
I'm down for a solidarity pledge where the left votes green, if only for the fact that all our votes can be counted in once place. The pledge cancels *IF* Biden embraces a few things like M4A or a GND, which we know will be a lie, but it gives us more to hold him to if he wins
Joe Biden If we wont hear about your TWEETS, if you become POTUS is only because YOU WON'T TELL AMERICANS THE TRUTH!  You'll be nothing but a puppet for the DEMOCRATS and who ever you choose as VP will run this country since you likely have ALZHEIMERS. DO YOU WHAT DAY THIS IS JOE
1.4M file for unemployment last week and 1.3M week prior, 60M Americans currently unemployed with the GDP collapse of -35% in Q2 this is trumps America I don‚Äôt think so. Only way Trump gets elected is if the Democrats don‚Äôt show up to vote for Biden which is a likely possibility
if the game plan is to convince people that Biden is some kinda fire-breathing extreme leftist then they've already lost.

True, just like Biden (who flat-out lied to the country about having done so during the debates, despite BRAGGING about it on video at the time).  One big club, and all that.
Do you have your tweets ready to go about how Trump beat Biden in all the debates?  Remember if they are not laudatory enough about the President, he will cancel you, Charlie.  Find a thesaurus and hone up on those words of groveling for the President.
Democrats called the FBI after finding shipping receipt for anti-Biden dirt sent to Cow hating treasonous lowlife scumbag Devin Nunes from overseas: report ‚Äì Raw Story
Hahah!  Yes!  You are grasping.  And you‚Äôre afraid.  Biden is your boogeyman!
Yeah. He's got a cool friend who strikes a Presidential chord as well. Joe Biden. üíØ
WEAPON OF CHOICE (BIDEN)
Your conservative friends in the media and in D.C. were all hot and bothered when Biden predicted Trump would talk about postponing the election.  And then your Golden Idol just said it.  Biden knows Trump better than you.
*narrator voice* Biden has never touched an electronic device, let alone has any idea what they are.
There will be time to push for progressive programs after Biden is elected, assuming we actually have an election.
it will never stop being odd to me that people are like, ‚Äúi will walk BAREFOOT across lego-laden lava to vote on november 3.‚Äù  ...i will drive to the ballot drop box probably a good week or two in advance to cast my vote for biden. the US is a very bizarre country.
Except for the fact he refused to endorse Biden until the last possible moment....
DHS is totally discredited and must be dismantled as soon as we have Biden in office. DHS compiled ‚Äòintelligence reports‚Äô on journalists who published leaked documents
LOL at all the Trumpistas trying to project their President‚Äôs Alzheimers and dementia on to Biden.
This is my tweet on the matter, and instead Biden allies are going to have to sell Trump some prime real estate in DC and PR on the cheap so he'll support statehood. oops!
Where Does Joe Biden Go to Get His Apology - now that . is talking election delay?  via
WEAPON OF CHOICE (BIDEN)
I want to see Biden have Twitch explained to him and then him try to repeat back his understanding of it
And the next level of sophistication would be to say "mechanically Biden can't have a uniform swing across 12% of all demographics; we know certain things about vote preference by age &amp; race, etc." IDK, at +14 he'd win *something* weird, best bets are MT/AK/KS/MO/SC
Imagine this, but 100% Biden.

Is it against MLB policy for presidential candidates buying cutouts of themselves in the stands? Could Biden...simply buy out all the seats in a stadium and fill them with cutouts of himself?
Yes, Gunny I will be voting for Biden.
I fully expect Biden to resign for health reasons if he is elected.

You think Biden embraced a bolder plan because activists stomped their feet &amp; called him an asshole? In reality, smart climate folks have been reaching out to him, persuading him, working with his team, and finding common ground. There is actual politics happening.
I‚Äôve made a list of fuckers, with whom I‚Äôd love to be stuck in an elevator for just this reason!!  No particular order... just fantasy scenarios as they come: Barr  Biden Mnuchin  McConnell Warren  Schumer Pelosi  Gaetz Jordan Every member of the Chump family And MORE!!!
Build Back Better - could be H&amp;M‚Äôs way of showing support for Biden. üëçüèº
Build Back Better is the Biden campaign slogan. üòÅ
One would hope a VP would have ambitions to become President. The VP is the understudy for the prez so they‚Äôd better want the job and be capable of doing it. That‚Äôs not a problem; it‚Äôs a qualification. What was Biden‚Äôs last gig again?
There is zero chance there will be a ho-hum transfer of power from Trump to Biden. The only uncertainty is Trump‚Äôs capacity to wreck the system, not his willingness to.
And we will keep talking about the John Lewis Voting Act from now thru Nov so that everybody remembers why the right to vote matters. Biden signs it in the first 100 days.
Biden is being prosecuted in Ukraine and hopefully will be extradited, Harris is not black &amp; the black community knows it, Hillary already lost to Trump because even lefties hate her and considering Michelle is a man the left doesn't stand a chance.~:&gt;
You are also sorely mistaken if you think that I like Biden, in the first place. So you're why you felt the need to come onto my page and start insulting him, is beyond me. I am not offended. I don't cate about him. Or you. I care about my job and our patients. ADIOS.
He exaggerates. Always has. Part of a glaring character flaw but I do trust his economic policies of Biden‚Äôs. And the 300k jobs was including a 50k jobs after the end of a GM strike and some temp jobs on govt.
Then you attacked Biden and Obama's handling of the H1N1 outbreak. In 19 months it killed 12,469 Americans and there were 60.8 million cases. Since March, there have been 4.5 million US cases and 154,000 deaths from covid.
Who‚Äôs the Biden surrogate on Ari right now?
Do you believe ventriloquist dummy Joe Biden would do a better job than Trump? I have zero faith in Biden‚Äôs policies as he just endorsed the crazy green new, jobs killing deal. My 401k has been doing great for the past 5 yrs. Joe Biden would stop that very quickly w/ his policies
The Lincoln Project is using Ronald Reagan for Biden ads.
Though 538 has the national polls as 50.0-41.7, so 56-42 would imply *all* the undecideds break to Biden.  (though Trump's approval is below 40%, he's already winning a few voters who disapprove of him)
Oh don‚Äôt worry. There will be no doubt who the winner is. Biden is gonna kick your ass!
Here's a slightly more sophisticated 56-42. Biden +14, but +12 in blue states and +16 in red states.
So everyone gave Biden shit when he said Trump will not leave......
"Former vice president Joe Biden‚Äôs unfounded accusation Thursday that President Trump wants to delay November‚Äôs election was not only clearly over the line but also unmasks how low the supposedly moderate Biden will go to win."  Your words sir.
I agree. I‚Äôm voting for Biden too. The point of the tweet wasn‚Äôt to dissuade you from voting for him, it was to remind us that we should demand better even from our elected officials from our own party. It‚Äôs aggravating that so many Democrats treat leaders like celebrities.
So, are you apologizing to Joe Biden?
More a realization there's enough time to get Pence onto the ballot, save their list of SC nominees, and this provides a cover that doesn't make them look like the complete hypocrites they are. Bonus of being able to scapegoat Trump for virus failure and economy w/o going Biden.
Intel Dems press Nunes for details on anti-Biden package from Ukrainian official
Jokes aside though the differences between Joe Biden and I aren't philosophical if I believe that he got his positions not from a philosophy but because they have been purchased by people with power. That would also make him my political enemy, not my political opponent.
I can assure that Biden would have handled this better. Hopefully, he is already planning what happens in Jan.
Did anyone remind Biden today that he‚Äôs running for president? üòÇ
Can you not see the entire goal of Trump doing that was to get eyes on it so Biden would be forced to do it!! Thanks for helping Trump out.. Again
Great, you‚Äôre not happy with Biden. Neither am I, but honestly do you think he would be any worse for the country than the human dumpster fire currently in the Oval Office?
We had a good economy, a good GDP, and a pandemic task force when Obama and Biden left office. Now we have high unemployment, the economy is in the toilet, and many thousands are dying of a contagious virus. You are obviously blind to who is at fault here.
I mean maybe Biden will surprise me, but this was his VERY FIRST act on the campaign trail:
Ignoring scientific fact, not surprising.  Did you turn off the TV during the protests or something? Mostly not peaceful, and I saw so many without masks and not social distancing either.   So why don't you go watch Biden explain again how kids touch his legs up and down.
Hi Sean, I'm doing a class project and steeped upon your graph. The article above this graph mentions that Biden has raised $633 million but in the graph you had the number at $278.9 million. Can you clarify why Biden's number in your graph was lower, is because of DNC $?
Can we do it for Biden too?
No. That ship sailed a long time ago.
I put rigging in quotes because we all witnessed Obama+the Media anoint Biden after SC. But calling that rigging is... tough. It‚Äôs like that only time the party acrually acted like one. It was impressive and infuriating.
What do you see as the notable elements of the GND that are missing in Biden's plan? Top three or whatever.
That's all fine and dandy, but just admit that Biden is shit. Vote for him all you want, but don't act like he's gonna be a good president, he's going to be a corporate tool just like previous democratic presidents. Which scares me b/c republicans always seem to gain power after.
That's more like it. Trump vs Biden: US presidential election poll tracker.  Mr Biden is leading in key battlegrounds like Florida, Texas, and Arizona, but not by much.  It's still a close race.   via

Public‚Äôs Mood Turns Grim; Trump Trails Biden on Most Personal Traits, Major Issues
Ten #American military installations are named for unabashedly-racist traitors to the United States. These current names dishonor our beloved #soldiers and their families. While #Trump and #Biden bicker like children, I advocate for the following solution.
I really hope Biden wins. I don't know how much more of this I can take. An out of control manchild running the country in the ground while 50-100 elected lackies look the other way, wading in his excrement so long as he throws a few coins their way.
Joe Biden is Loosing come November.
I'm a United States Veteran and served in the military for 4 years and at the end of my service walked away with an Honorable Discharge and several medals.  I would crawl through broken glass to vote for Biden.
Joe Biden will win the election, if we vote. Everyone knows that. There‚Äôs more work though. Impeach now and get him out
He never served his country.  He's a coward.  I'm a Veteran and would crawl through broken glass to vote for Biden.
Wait. Are we talking about Biden now? Just remember, you ain‚Äôt black if you don‚Äôt vote for Jim Crow sleepy creepy Joe. #YouAintBlack #JimCrowJoe #BeijingBiden
Last time I checked Biden isn‚Äôt bragging about grabbing women by the pussy or saying he wants to fuck his daughter.
"Mark my words, I think he is gonna try to kick back the election somehow, come up with some rationale why it can't be held."  Or this quote from Jimmy Kimmel where Biden says Trump doesn't have the authority but may start a drumbeat to postpone it
I love Kamala Harris and look forward to voting for Biden!
Yea and the science says Biden‚Äôs climate plan devastatingly too little too late.  Long game can only be put off so long. Can only pretend other priorities are more pressing for so many years.

I hope Biden will be able to get something done for him.
When Biden wins and picks Jay Inslee to lead the EPA, who becomes the governor of Washington?
And there it is again.  IT IS NOT BINARY.  You should be able to criticize your candidate without the terrified "You want the other guy?"  Of COURSE I'll take Biden.  Gratefully.  But of all the Dem candidates, he was literally the one I wanted LEAST, and yeah, I'm disappointed.
He Cannot do whatever he wants! That‚Äôs called a #Dicktatorship. Constitution sets up 3 branches of government so no one has too much power. If you believe the president does have complete power I guess Biden can do whatever he wants when he‚Äôs president. PS. He was impeached!
We gained 2.7m more jobs in May then 4.8m in June. Can't count on Biden to continue the trend if he becomes president.
It will be abolished if Biden and Democrats get control of this country.
I'm not Biden fan, and I like Trump, but I'm going to buck the trend and say I choose to wear a mask. I don't know if it works or not, but it's the best I can do
I'm not Biden fan, but honestly, that video looks like the mask works because it looks like the gas is going through the sides??
I trust Biden to Vet and pick the appropriate VP. I think everybody should stay out of it and quit giving their conjecture to what should happen. Just trust the presumptive nominee. You can‚Äôt change his decision anyway.
Are they? How so? I think there are a lot more things to be flipping out about right now. Biden will vet and pick who he picks.
Fvck Joe Biden.  Its better to have Trump for four more years, so we can well and truly burn this shit down.
Pretty fucking rich to demonize Harris for aiming to be president if she gets VP considering the sheer hoard of presidents we've had who were VPs first, not to mention BIDEN WAS LITERALLY VP FOR 8 YEARS AND IS NOW RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT
There is a lot of hypocrisy on twitter and in politics, obviously. But holy shit. His absolute HORROR that Biden would SUGGEST Trump might delay and election versus the flaccid ‚ÄúI wouldn‚Äôt do that‚Äù for THE ACTUAL AUTHORITARIAN ELECTION MEDDLING BY TRUMP.   What a clown.
I really don't see Biden winning Florida tbh, but it would be interesting if he did.
And didn't Biden promise to serve only one term?  I want an ambitious someone coming behind him so that we can have a seamless transition.  12 more years.
I will support a Biden and literally anyone ticket.
This wouldn‚Äôt be a strategy at all if he was even slightly behind Biden. He is getting pummeled in internal polling.
Who in their non-brainwashed mind would vote for #CreepyUncleJoe?¬ø!  Trump's no saint, but Biden helped to enable Trump to become POTUS...
In the Qatholic cult, the gospel is the exclusive property of themselves and if one of their culture war enemies cites it that is seen as an outrageous theft and act of usurpation.  So Biden is reflexively denounced as a fraud by them, but Trump is a "baby Christian".

Quit putting Democrats down. Don‚Äôt put women down. Just support Biden and his choices. I‚Äôm so sick of seeing people putting each other, or others down on the Democrat side. It‚Äôs crazy. Have we learned nothing?
And Joe Biden will make his choice well.
Biden isn‚Äôt that kind of guy. He‚Äôs not gonna be afraid of that.
In the end, it doesn‚Äôt matter what we think. That is Biden‚Äôs decision. I just hope he gets rid of Dodd.
There‚Äôs not a whole lot of Republicans left didn‚Äôt back Trump. And I really doubt Biden is going to pick anyone who backed Trump.
I'd say they've accepted that November will be a blowout, which is why they will drag their feet on pandemic aid. Patriots that they are, they want to make things as difficult as possible for President Biden and the Democrats. Just like they did with Obama and the Great Recession
Russian bounties has always been uncorroborated. CIA has actually lost confidence in that intel. It's likely false. I've seen tiktok used against Biden too. The fact that you try to turn this against Trump with ridiculous conspiracy theories is insane and tasteless.
You have absolutely no evidence that Biden would have dealt with China better or at all. Especially with his abysmal foreign policy record. Trump is taking the right steps.
Biden doesn't have to excite people: there is *plenty* of "negative excitement" about defeating Trump.
People who support Biden because he'll bring back the good old days are going to be disappointed. He needs to find a way to let them down easy.
Despite all the 1st person plural stuff, you‚Äôre not an American citizen.  Given your hysterical, baseless attack on Trump here, your boosting of Joe Biden, and now running interference for the ChiCom crackdown in HK, people should start being suspect of your motives.
This is kabuki. R's know they're going to lose big in November so they have no intention of making things easier for President Biden and the Democrats. They did the same thing to Obama in the Great Recession. Party before country, always! #MAGA
We don't like ambitious, smart, &amp; fierce women in this country. Doubly so if they are black or brown. And we've got to figure that shit out, stat.  This is why I didn't want Biden to be our nominee; he's too heavily influenced by the good ole boys club. Be better in 2024.

Your last sentence is the only accurate one. And another fact is that Biden knows nothing of job creation. If he wins, we're doomed.

There will be choruses of dismay no matter who he picks. If the choice is Warren (my personal favorite), Biden should make the announcement flanked by prominent black Warren supporters.
how are you feeling about this now?
These are the people that will be enthusiastically voting for Joe Biden and going back into political hibernation once he takes office, because they can go back to brunch.
Have Biden take the test. He'll fail miserably.
Is he Biden's age?
And yet, Biden is the one constantly calling the POTUS "racist" and emphatically running on a "I'm not Trump" platform, rather than to discuss his own plans for the nation. Sleepy Joe, you're a hack.
Oh, and I suppose Biden is very well.
I see your point. Kind of like the Biden family and China. What gives democrats the idea that what you say may be the case?
Wow! I have never even seen Biden campaign logo before. Why haven‚Äôt you put it out in the wild?
I have a theory about this. I think if Trump goes down, Pence is the candidate of the GOP, and I don't think Biden beats Pence. Pence isn't "Trumpy" enough to push away Never Trumpers. Trump dying right now may actually not be better.
If I were still a centrist Democrat, I would be very scared. She will be de facto president if Biden remains as a puppet-figurehead, or the president if Biden resigns. And it will be a dual Harris/Pelosi run country.
Biden literally was a segregationist and worked with other ones. That's how he began his career
Just remember as Biden said if you don‚Äôt vote for him you‚Äôre not black. Guess they forgot to put that one in there
Segregationists? Then why does Biden get a pass? Do you not know his history?
Not a completely unfair characterization. But it doesn't matter. I care about actions and it is clear to me if Biden wins, we're doomed.
And yet so many libertarian gun supporters are going to help Joe Biden get elected by voting 3rd party.  Gun control groups support Biden. #WakeUp.  Trump 2020
Is there some reason black men should not go to jail for non-violent offenses like robbery, identity theft, fraud, etc.?  Biden was right the first time.  Trying to out-do the left on soft-on-crime is not conservative.
No. Trump's approval rating is rising since the riots. Polls only show Trump behind Biden by 8-10% nationally but studies show Republicans are FAR less likely to choose to reveal their political beliefs. This skews polls. Trump does very well in online polls too.
I'm from Long Island prior to military. And I'm not at all for Biden. That man is a puppet and has no good ideas or proper experience for this nation.

This is bullshit. Biden‚Äôs very likely to pass away in office so *anyone* is gonna be focused on being an effective replacement. The only real reason I can think of to object to Harris is her DA background, but only leftists object to that, and since when do the Dems listen to us?
anyone who wants Trump in office instead of Biden is equally bad. I don't care if they have a red rose or red X in their Twitter name.
"But what if she does such a good job people want her to be the next President?!"  Really hope Biden isn't listening to the weirdos who peddle this nonsense.

I'm not saying Biden will save America. He may well do very little of value and we get more Trumpism in 2024.  I'm saying that Trump winning in 2020 is effectively a gunshot to Uncle Sam's temple. It's the end of America. You won't get a say in this country ever again.
You REALLY think that Biden will appoint a ultra-right justice, so we see Roe v. Wade overturned, Obergefell v. Hodges overturned, Lawrence v. Texas overturned? That he'll continue Trump's turning the gov't into loyalist lackeys gutting democracy?  THAT is what's ridiculous.
Good ol' rose Twitter is like "sure, Trump is bad, but Biden is worse and we're willing to sacrifice minorities and let America become an authoritarian theocratic state as long as Biden doesn't win."
"An economy where Black, Latino, Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI), and Native American workers and families are finally welcomed as full participants." #WeAreAAPI #AAPI

Whatever, you don't care. You only care about disagreeing with Trump in everything he says. Don't make me post Biden's insane ramblings.
Joe Biden and Donald Trump now both calling for the arrest of anarchists. Not for violating any specific laws, just for being anarchists.  Cool cool cool. Glad to know the general election is now just a Republican primary.
The Joe Biden parody account just delivers shovel hooks over and over.
Democrats are thrilled that many have died so that they can blame Trump and use it for Biden's campaign. The reality is, however, seeing as how the Democrats called Trump's travel ban "xenophobic", I doubt their response would've been better.
Lol. It‚Äôs going to be hilarious when Biden wins with 330 electoral votes.
Hello, if that were true about soon to be President Biden, it would be piped in every living room in the United States and beyond.

No one will understand any of the debates. Trump will lie as completely and incoherently as usual and Biden isn't sharp enough to go toe-to-toe with him, so he too will be incoherent. It's just going to be a bunch of name calling and tired rhetoric.
Yeah maybe. Biden is running for Senate so he oughta know.
It depends on the location. Plenty often all the seats are filled. And Biden's turnout isn't always impressive. But we know that you aren't a journalist. So you won't mention this. You're just a left-wing activist swinging your pen as a weapon.
It was the race war tweet that got me on board with Biden but I want better in 2024. Even without the race war baiting, his continued refusal to tackle the virus head-on could have had me there by now
Like Barr did with the Mueller Report, Biden needs to do a preemptive report refuting the Durham report before its release.
Then you vote for Biden but at least look into his history. It ain't pretty
Joe Biden is not the President of the United States and he is not using the federal government to help him get reelected. What the fuck is wrong with you people, don‚Äôt you see the difference?
Either way the election of 2020 will make America unlivable for non-members of the Leftist cult. Trump wins, 4 more years of approved violence. Biden wins, retribution against conservatives. Time for America to get a divorce. Each state divided into red/blue sovereign states.
Oh, most definitely. If Biden fucks this up, we could get just such a person in to continue Trumpism. Which is why we need to be all over Biden and make him scared of the American people if he doesn't step up.
Everyone needs to keep up with the protests, stay out in the streets, make sure Biden feels the pressure from the people. Similarly House Reps and Senators hearing from people.   I'm not happy with Biden either, I don't expect much from him. But I'm TERRIFIED about more Trump.
Remember there‚Äôs no election that can‚Äôt be stolen. And if Biden wins we then still need to keep fighting because the Dems do NOT have our best interests in mind. There‚Äôs just no hope, here.
Yeah.  And the thing I've noticed the Biden campaign doing is they tend to publicize the worst polls in advertising.  So even if every other poll has them ahead in a state, they'll pick the losing poll and say, "We're so close!  Donate today!"  They get it.
The thing I hate about polling this go-around are the number of people that keep saying "ACT LIKE BIDEN IS DOWN BY TEN!"  Well, no shit.  I don't think anyone is going to be taking a victory lap here.   Still interesting to see, though.
I am appalled at your failure to support Joe Biden at this critical time in our nation's history. Your shortsightedness is very apparent. I am a Vietnam Veteran, who like many others, have put our lives on the line for democracy. Grow up.
It certainly gives me pause. I'll vote for Biden to end the madness but if I don't get a much better option from the Democrats in 2024 I'll be back to voting 3rd party
That's too good for Biden. #NeverBidenNeverTrump
Hillary was wrong to run knowing how high her disapproval was. DNC should not have thwarted Bernie in 16 he was doing better than Hillary in polls vs Trump. I'll hold my nose &amp; vote for Biden to end the madness but I want better in 2024 or back to 3rd party for me
For anyone who gives you crap about it:  is fire.
Yes for reasons I stated. I didn't vote for Trump the first time and voted for Obama twice. But i can't stand Biden and his policies
Same map of 2016 right before the election.
Yeah, so his Chinese bedfellows can undercut the U.S. competition; what a dog you are, Biden.
I might have a glass of bubbly, but until Biden is sworn in and the transfer of power is completed, I will be fearful every time I check the news.  If he likes fucking us over this much now, just wait until we as a nation reject him.
Of course Biden can meet Trump for a fair debate but the DNC knows better than to let him. #gop
A family member posted on FB they were voting for POTUS as ‚Äúhe‚Äôs the only way out of this mess.‚Äù Later, a friend told a Biden supporter ‚Äúyou‚Äôre ignorance is showing‚Äù and that the ‚Äúlibtards‚Äù and their ‚Äúdivisive bullshit‚Äù could ‚Äúeat dicks.‚Äù  My brain exploded at the contradictions.
Troll Alert! Go to Biden‚Äôs Puppetmaster see if he can make Biden talk on his page.
What a rude awakening this must be for they‚Äôre voting for Biden because they want a real president, not Putin‚Äòs puppet
Then why are you voting for Biden? Biden's actions as head of Senate judiciary committee such as his 1994 crime bill gave police immense power and immunities. And as VP, Biden militarized police. The fact that you are voting for Biden is a pitiful contradiction.
even by european standards biden is center right
Biden might say he will debate Trump but bc we know the Dems won‚Äôt let him. #gop #fakenews
Woo who- hit 200 followers today!!üéâüéâ#resist #BlueWave2020 #BLM #handsoffmybc #DumpTrump2020 #Biden
Biden hasn't been in the public eye making speeches nearly as much as Trump and already has his fair share of lies. But I care more about actions and Biden doesn't have the track record to address any of our big concerns right now
Just keep your finger crossed Biden can stay lucid for 3 debates
I am voting for Biden but he ain't getting my endorsement.
I miss Bush, would vote for him again. Saying this as someone who voted for Hillary and will be voting for Biden this November. Bush had his bad moments but at least was respectful of the position of the presidency‚Äîboth at home and abroad.
You're being cynical. Trump lies plenty but usually it's more of a stretch of the truth. All politicians tell some truth but many lies. Biden is no different.
Deliberate foot-dragging. They know they‚Äôre going to lose big in November and want to make things as hard as possible for President Biden and the Dems.
people who like biden arent leftists lmfao
A plague of puppies on Biden's inauguration day?
Anyone who would like to vote for someone other than Biden without handing victory to Trump should be in favor of #RankedChoiceVoting.   In fact it gives you the opportunity to put more than one candidate ahead of whomever you like the least.
Bitch won't leave his bunker for anything but golf.
Trump has signed executive orders to help distressed black and latino areas in education and other funding, sickle cell anemia research, first step act jail reform, massive funding for historically black colleges, and more. Biden, however, has only harmed the black communities.
Well, I've heard these Biden supporters are wavering (yes they are reportedly alive)
You got that right! I haven‚Äôt run across a single person who says, ‚Äúwow, it‚Äôs the  that‚Äôs causing these riots. I‚Äôm gonna vote for #DementedJoe Biden to clean things up!‚Äù  Everyone I know believes this is a traitorous political game by  elected officials like
The Dem wave is baked in. R's just want to make things as difficult as possible for President Biden and the Democrats, so they're setting the dials for "crash and burn" on their way out the door. Party over country! #MAGA
It's especially funny when Biden's pandering attempts fail such as when he praised Vermont while he was in New Hampshire. üòÅ Biden has his fair share of lies. His South Africa and Iraq War lies were intended to pander. And yes, I voted for Obama twice before I left the Democrats.
"Not helping workers" is a feature, not a bug. #MoscowMitch knows his party is headed for a bloodbath in November, and wants to make things as difficult as possible for President Biden and the Democrats. Just like he did to Obama in the Great Recession. #MAGA
Actually, some of those were executive orders, meaning Trump personally used his power to make it happen. See? You didn't know that. Educate yourself. The fact that you dont realize what a pandering, racist pile of trash Biden is shows you aren't a very smart person.
Wrong trump &amp; gop controlled by the Putin mob. Vote Biden
I'm glad it fell down.  Biden can send a crew down there with construction dumpsters and shovel it up.
Yes. That's why it was so ironic when  recently warned that a Biden victory would mean "the end of America as we have known it". To which I say "about damn time!"
There are good reasons for the pardons and Obama pardoned nearly 2000 people! No, i didn't add an extra zero. And there's no reason to believe Biden would have handled the virus better when democrats called his travel ban "xenophpbic".
Yeah it's odd considering how much damage he's done to black Americans and his spotty civil rights voting record. Biden's done nothing positive for minorities compared to Trump. I bet you know nothing about that.
Exactly. Biden supported the war on drugs in office and then his 1994 crime bill was awful for the black communities and gave police immense powers and immunities which BLM is currently trying to reverse. Not to mention, Biden militarized them as VP. But if you like him, alright.
To the contrary, I voted for Obama twice. Decorum is not a basis for voting for me. Some find Trump's manner of speech refreshing. I see none of our nation's issues getting resolved should Biden win election. He's a panderer and charlatan. Expect a very close election, by the way
Awww nothing to say just repeating yourself,typical of your type. The biden disease ü§£ü§£ü§£
My message is change will come even if Biden does not embrace all that the left wants. If the left ends up not supporting him they are biting off their nose to spite their face. Change will come easier through a moderate dem I believe. Big picture!
I agree with the protest against the police and big changes in funding and oversight of the police we will get there sooner with Biden, trump we will end up in more upheaval
Really. I hear many mentions of the failures of Democratic policies- especially progressive ones. I've looked into Biden and don't like him at all. He has a lot of dark history as a politician. And I don't see him as having the experience we need now. But to each their own.
Biden also said he would mandate that the federal govt will buy American made goods without exceptions (as in, no goods from "allies" and China). Trump's "Buy America" campaign was just a token gesture. I'm hoping Biden's variant extends beyond Trump's faux protectionism.
I actually had to think really hard to eek out what little policy substance Biden has, because he does a damn good job of spouting unsubstantial word salad like Ratboy-ar-dee Pete Buttigieg. Of course, I'm not very confident that he'll stick to his words in the first place.
Note the word "marginal". It brings me absolutely no joy when I think of voting for Biden. For what his rhetoric is worth, Biden did say he would roll back Trump's corporate tax cuts. Biden will also assume a more diplomatic stance when it comes to Cuba and Iran (hopefully).
Dave has absolutely no clue what he's talking about. According to CIVIQ polls, Trump's approval rating is going up since the riots. Also, polls show Republicans are FAR less likely to choose to reveal their political beliefs. This all confirms Biden's lead is small, if at all.
There's no reason to believe Biden would have done a better job
You really like Biden then? Many democrats have confided to me that they aren't voting for Biden, rather they are voting against Trump
Dave has absolutely no clue what he's talking about. According to CIVIQ polls, Trump's approval rating is going up since the riots. Also, polls show Republicans are FAR less likely to choose to reveal their political beliefs. This all confirms Biden's lead is small, if at all.
Apparently you haven't looked into Biden. He makes countless gaffes. But more importantly, he's made racist comments as well and fought civil rights legislation and is responsible for mass incarceration of black people
It's sure to be the longest 100 days of my lifetime. The last few weeks of summer will of course go by in a blink but then waiting to see whether Biden can get through a debate and wrap this turkey up will be torture
If Biden continues to disappoint me on policy any more than he already has, then I'm gonna stay home. It's really on a knife's edge at this point whether I vote. I don't care how much Blue MAGAts virtue signal and hurl platitude shit sandwiches at me. I'll just be chilling.
To dumb it down for you, your petty insults and cliches aren't a factor in my voting behavior. The reason why my line between voting and staying home are blurring is because Biden offers less than the bare minimum on policy while gaslighting progressives with flowery cliches.
Consider yourself lucky that gnats like you don't play any role in my decision to vote since policy is my prime condition. Hence, why I'm leaning towards voting for Biden who has a (marginally) better policy platform. If emotion was a factor, I would just chill on the couch.
I see a difference for sure, but I simply don't find either of them compelling. The Dems have done almost everything possible to turn me off. I'm leaning towards voting Biden this election cycle to remove Trump, but the line between staying home and voting is getting kinda blurry
Ya no... same reason Dems gave us HRC and now Biden.  Parties are political gangs with loyalty tests. Not reason.
You can not like both trump and Biden, crazy as it sounds.
Thank you very much for explaining .it's Joe Biden  who's going to win
Great online concert &amp; rally for Joe Biden tonight: Celebration For Change 100 Days to Go. Terrific music, enthusiasm, &amp; commitment. Great job by all! ;-)
Trump did not say that Biden did
We need the votes for Biden.  Can go back to disagreeing LATER.  Right now we have a country to save.
President JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN   #100Days  #VoteForOurLives  #VoteBiden2020
This is kabuki. Republicans are dragging their feet over more aid because they know they're going to get slaughtered in November and they want to make things as difficult as possible for President Biden and the Democrats. Just like they did for Obama in the Great Recession. #MAGA
Biden says ‚Äúon day one, I will take your guns and your Social Security!‚Äù #gop
I hardly "came at you"! All I said was something you should agree with- Carlin wouldn't have supported Biden either. You came at me with your vitriole. You're the aggressor. Progressives are constantly on the attack.
The beauty part is that people don't have to be "excited" about Joe. A better term might be "relieved". As  has pointed out, there is *plenty* of NEGATIVE excitement about Trump, which will drive people to the polls. I like "Joe Biden: the Peace &amp; Quiet Candidate"
If you are planning on voting for Biden anyway then you should have agreed. I knew you are a progressive. I speak to your type often. And I am libertarian. I'm socially liberal and strongly believe in civil liberties. I've produced YT vids defending gay people
Yes me too! Or they are saying they will vote for him and then secretly vote for Biden. Wishful thinking on my part.
All I saif was "He wouldn't have liked Biden either". One short sentence because it's relevant to this video as Carlin was talking about BOTH parties. You should be agreeing with me. Instead, you fly off the handle and examine my tweets and such. And then you cast judgment on me
That begins after Biden‚Äôs inauguration.  Hold on.
as two-faced as they come and both judgment &amp; corruption, not to mention, criminality, still to come into the fold, long b4 Nov.  What President #Trump pageants is child's play compared to stormy abuses committed by one, Joe Biden.  The Lord leads.    Hi
George Carlin certainly was no liberal. In fact, for any democrats trying to make him out to be some champion of why you should vote for anyone, especially Biden, well...there‚Äôs this:
The fact that anyone thinks Biden is better is mindboggling
He wouldn't have liked Biden either
Well you can say one thing about Biden,he‚Äôs had a lot Lee‚Äôs stupid shit come out of his mouth compared to yours!! #STFUTRUMP
More fake news.
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.every week joe biden sends me a fundraising letter that asks ‚Äújoseph, are you with me?‚Äù every week the answer is the same. ‚Äúi guess i have to be?‚Äù
Biden has a wealth of people to fill AG. Klobuchar, Schiff, Swalwell, Ellison. But definitely Harris if she's not VP.
Can't wait til Biden is in office and all ills in the world get to be pointed at him. Thats how this works, right? They'll certainly agree, right????
Hang in there and keep fighting. You‚Äôll be around for Biden‚Äôs term and then Kamala‚Äôs two terms after. üôÇ Thoughts are with you.
Biden was probably a "graduate." How else would such a steaming pile get where he has been? He slurped his way up the ladder. It's his only talent.  He's certainly creepy enough.
Plus there is more than one video of republicans saying how much they love Biden. (before he decided to run)
No, Democrats take seriously a Christian witness and social gospel unseen on Fox News. Biden/Pelosi far better Catholics and Christians  than snotty dogmatist from EWTN.
Inslee doesn‚Äôt care about small businesses! By participating in the lockdown scam, he‚Äôs hoping to be rewarded by the Biden admin if mail-in voting/fraud allows Biden to steal the election.
That sounds like someone currently in the federal government or with history in Obama Admin., like Harris or Rice or Warren...all supposedly on Biden‚Äôs short list. I think winning is 1st priority &amp; selecting someone who could help with a constituency. Not sure who would help most
and abolishing ice dosent mean no immigration enforcement, it just meeans no personal gestapo like trump has turned it into
So what crazy ass Twitter bull shit do we expect the Cheeto to pull to try and squash the news cycle for Biden's VP pick?
I'll ask again: If Biden picks Geraldine Ferraro as his running mate, will someone point out that she's been dead for 9-1/2 years‚Äîor do we all just go with it?
Dr. Fauci - America stands behind you and believes you even though the GOP is trying to discredit you. #Biden will heal America just as you have tried to show what is needed to heal covid-19. Hang in there. We will #VoteOutTheGOP
I AGREE with abolishing ice on principle, but i agree its bad electorally to run on it
If Biden picks Karen Bass as VP, and she becomes the president in 2024, the list of oldest presidents will be:  1. Joe Biden 2. Karen Bass 3. Donald Trump
RANDY....care if an old lady wears her new Randy Rainbow mask, using your trump song???  WEAPON OF CHOICE (BIDEN)
So is it safe to say your voting Biden ?
Ok I‚Äôm supposed to believe Biden has the dementia issues when Trump is talking about beating Obama 4 years ago..?
Being the Trojan Horse For the  Radical Left Democrat Party Is the only job That Joe Biden is Useful for in his  Political career right now. #Sad
On the other hand, you‚Äôre so terrified of losing to Biden you got yourself impeached.
no, I think both Biden and Palin were picked later in 2008.
Dear Biden bundlers attacking Kamala:   If you have legit concerns about her, by all means speak up. But "legit" means "national security related." If your biggest reservation is "ambition"‚Äîthat is, if you're butthurt b/c she didn't kiss your ring‚Äîkindly SHUT THE F‚ÄîK UP.
200 bucks a week for unemployment sucks, so what if they blocked it. Your a big stupid jerk, and will lose the election to Joe Biden.  I get to watch your ugly face go boohoo, when they kick your stupid family off of the white house property!!!
Who said I was blanketing anyone? Joe Biden is a uniquely fascist individual lol. And go back to the beginning of the thread. I never said they were the same. I said one leads to the other. Biden is just another step *in the same direction* down that fascist road.
With Biden currently leading by a wide margin in the polls we might see this map come election day ‚Äî the Biden over-performance scenario: 385-153.  Of course, this assumes no effect from voter suppression.
If elected, Biden will only be able to choose what he eats I think.
I applaud your interest in using your "I"s, though technically Hawkins isn't an independent candidate. Also, it's my understanding that President Trump and former VP Biden are accused of generic sex offenses, not pedophilia. I also am a non-pedophile "I" available January 20th.
Harris supporters likelihood of defection is the only thing that would make Harris a strategic choice for Biden, and they've already set up a culture that demands not committing is as good as a vote for Trump and worthy of communal ostracism.  That's gonna be hard to overcome.
Chip in to elect Joe Biden and other Democrats on the ballot
Pam says she's voting for Biden but will really vote for Trump
Joe Biden heads into the weekend weighing the biggest decision of his presidential campaign so far, and people close to the process tell CNN that the former vice president is believed to have now begun .... NO, NO, NO!~!!
Man, who had retweeting  on their bingo card? #biden #vote
You‚Äôre posting articles about Biden plagiarizing stuff as an argument for why he‚Äôs as bad as Trump. That is.... unbelievably not sharp, and a reason that your views aren‚Äôt worthy of consideration. Adios.
... because black people overwhelmingly got Biden nominated. It would be paternalistic and, frankly, racist in the extreme for me to tell black people that I won‚Äôt vote for the candidate they chose and will help Trump get elected because that candidate is bad for them.
My fav from Nancy is ‚Äú....it would devastate our effort to fully restore the Obama-Biden legacy‚Äù. A. I hope that‚Äôs not the full agenda B. None of these texts contain any information on how we plan on winning or how the money will be spent. Assumes donors are completely emotional
Friendly fire isn't friendly. It is deadly fire.   The same forces that love Trump hate Harris. If that money can't have Trump and Biden will win, then that money will fuck up Biden's ticket by sinking Harris at all cost.  That money REALLY doesn't want Harris.
For selfish reasons, I want Biden's VP pick to be a great orator because I want to see Pence get owned in the debates.
Got it. Thank you for these. This reinforces my point‚Äî if these articles convince you that Trump and Biden are equally bad, you have terrible judgment and are a bad person.
Joe Biden helped create and voted for the Patriot Act. It was signed by President bush. This created the Department of Homeland Security. Obama signed the bill that allowed for indefinite detention of US citizens by the military. Trump is using the powers they voted for.
‚ÄúI‚Äôm not voting for Biden because of racial justice issues‚Äù isn‚Äôt a valid take for a white voter to have. Period.
I‚Äôm not in a position to apologize for Biden‚Äôs record on race. But, given that black Dem primary voters are who for Biden nominated, I‚Äôm sure as hell not gonna be shitty enough to tell black people that he‚Äôs just as bad as Trump. Or on the same planet.
#SeduceMeIn5Words Biden accepts Medicare for all.
Meh. Agreed. Still better than Trump.   Biden knows he‚Äôs just a name and a face. He even came out right and said he needs a VP who‚Äôs ready to be president on Day 1. This is all about getting trump out of office. I wanted Warren or even Bernie anyways üá∫üá∏‚úåüèª
I bet the Biden team has gone overboard in vetting people.   Who knows? Maybe some of this stuff recently is about that. Maybe they want to test this stuff out and see if anyone cares.
Watching Biden and Warren talk about their faith. They‚Äôed be so complementary.
Biden has said he would be a one-term president, so the VP should be a person with presidential ambitions.
Wouldn't that be fun! As long as he takes all of his relatives, anyone would be good to run against Biden. That can be taken several ways.
Harris allies granted call with Biden campaign after Dodd blowup
To be clear, I don't give a shit about Biden's religion, and I do think Scientology is also horseshit.  What bugs me is the pass we give to abusive corrupt organizations simply because they're really old.
Everyone: "Saying nice things at a scientology event is disqualifying, because they're a criminal conspiracy that takes money to cover abuses!"  Also everyone: "I have no problem with Joe Biden being a devout Catholic!"
Bro the fuck you even saying  NEARLY 150,00 PEOPLE HAVE DIED BECAUSE YOU COULDN‚ÄôT DO YOUR JOBüòÇ  The incompetence you display  The irony in that statement  You STILL don‚Äôt have a plan to  -slow the spread -Rebuild the economy  -Reopen safely   Joe Biden does You don‚Äôt üòÇ

Because I don't believe Biden is going to do anything to meaningfully address climate change.
Potential Biden VP Pick Karen Bass Praised Scientology - Cult Accused of Kidnapping, Worshiping Aliens
What lists have Karen Bass as one of Joe Biden's top running mates? I've seen numerous top 10 lists over the last few months and none of them had this woman on it. Is she like his 30th pick or something?
it's like how biden won the primary overwhelmingly without campaigning
CNN: Three people charged in Twitter hack that hit Biden and Obama.   via
While I can't stand her politics, at least  acted mature when climate protesters invaded her office.  choose to have them arrested when they stormed his campaign HQ. Biden also agrees with Trump that these #BLM anarchists should be prosecuted.
She was my #1 candidate but I‚Äôll still walk their hell infested swamp is ungodly creatures to get Biden elected on November 3.
We're not talking about Biden sweetie
The only people who deserve to be targets of vote shaming people are those who voted for  and the other conservative sociopaths instead of #BernieSanders. I'm not voting for Biden, I'm sick of voting along with the ignorant and indifferent crowd. #NeverBidenNeverTrump

I'm not arguing-- I don't need to change your mind. If someone on Twitter can convince you to consign millions of people to suffering, that's a you problem. I'm voting for Biden because I care about people. You apparently aren't, so you don't. It's simple!
I‚Äôm not going to ignore misogyny within the party. If you think that helps Biden, have fun in your silence and denial.
At the end of your tweet, I finally realized you were describing Joe Biden.   I agree.  Register. Vote. Protect America  from anarchy.   Thanks, Josh.  You truly love this country.
Yep, it's your willingness to help Trump get elected because you don't like Biden's preferences that makes you a terrible person. That's not "harassment"-- it's adulthood. You own the choices you make. Your choice makes you a terrible person.
But no, I don't accept the equivalency that, because Biden's policy preferences aren't perfect in my view, that his preferences and Trump's are indistinguishable, and I'll stay home. Because I'm neither a child nor an awful human being.
To the extent Biden has different policy preferences than I do, I accept that reasonable people differ. On some matters, I agree with him-- I don't support Sanders' vision of M4A, for instance, not because I don't believe in universal healthcare, but because it's a bad policy.
Your choices are to do the same and vote for Biden, or decide that, because your preferences lost out in the D primary, you're willing to consign millions of people to the damage Trump causes them. That's your prerogative. But you should know that it makes you a bad person.
Yeah, Biden won the nomination by pandering to the socialists &amp; thereby must be a radical socialist himself, therefore ‚Äúunelectable.‚Äù Oh, wait! Who was that guy Bernie Sanders? Talk about inconvenient facts, you‚Äôre reaching, Neil. Trump wishes it was Sanders so that might stick.
Joe Biden won the Democratic nomination because he got the most votes. As all of his opponents acknowledged. Because I'm an adult and I care about the people suffering severe harm from Trump, I accept those results, and will vote for him in November.
I know what scientology is. I'm asking which VP candidate is one? Biden hasn't announced a pick, and, to my knowledge, no one on his likely list is a scientologist....
Senator, wherever you end up in the Biden administration please never stop pushing to have these criminals prosecuted.
All the things you're afraid of, that's what they are.  If Joe Biden is elected president, they're gonna come take your house and your job, and you'll be a pariah on Twitter.
These white men talking shit are Dems and people in Biden‚Äôs campaign. They‚Äôre literally on podcasts saying shit directly from their own mouths.  You should ask yourself why you‚Äôre willing to believe white men would never treat a black woman like this.  Even when they do it openly
Voting for Biden is kinda like wearing a mask.  You don‚Äôt do it because you want to... you do it to protect other people.
I wouldn‚Äôt even want to work with Biden at this point. Sounds like a nightmare.
I think all the women should tell Biden to fuck off bc this selection process has been gross, and make him pick some lame ass dude while they keep floursishing in their existing roles, but they‚Äôre all better women than I am ü§£ I know they want to help.
Joe Biden's going to pick Tim Kaine for VP.  We need a man that's old, white and boring with this VP pick.
I mean i know that Joe biden just isn't better then trump, like really at all, but if we have an election and trump loses, can we have a big party????
Biden is not falling for Chris Wallace rhetoric. Wallace gave softball Qs to #CorruptTrump &amp; didn't ask any of the important Qs (ie Putin bounties).  On the other hand, he would go for Joe's jugular. Joe is polling well, so no need to give ammo. Smart man, not like dumb Donnie.
Reminder that Jill Biden started the "Settle for Joe" strategy.
Biden's running mate announcement pushed back, likely will not come next week
I can‚Äôt imagine any woman at this point is excited to be in the Biden administration. Excited to help the country? Yes. But being treated like dog shit while you do it is such a fucked scenario I know I‚Äôd dread.
Biden couldn‚Äôt compete with DJTs consistency.   Amazing you know what Biden said was mildly racist but somehow birtherism is fine.
Deleted Biden video sets off a crisis at Voice of America  via
This is not just a VP pick.....Biden will likely be a one term president based on his age alone. This is the 2024 DNC nominee.
The more ambitious the better. A fighter for progress. Biden has the ability to take frank advice and he'll need all the energy and good ideas his administration can muster.
And? I'm not Trans, but I grew up in extreme poverty (still in poverty), was abused significantly as a child, and have a severe neurodevelopmental disorder. I'm white. I'm privileged as f√ªck in comparison. It's privileged to think settling for Biden is safe for others.
That doesn't make sense. Say Trump is the Undertaker. Biden is Roman Reigns. You're saying the only way Undertaker loses is if bring in the Blue Meanie
Everyone SHUT THE PHUCK UP re: the VEEP.  I WAS SICK OF THIS TIRED SHIT IN EARLY JUNE.   Biden VETTED THE BEJESUS outta his candidates - we will NEVER know why someone was not picked as he is a gentlemen and will not spill closet skeletons.   NOV 3.   F O C U S!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Oh, ffs, Biden/tree stump is a winning ticket. THERE. IS. NO. PERFECT. CHOICE. Prepare to get behind whoever it is or get out of the way. We CAN'T quibble now!
A friend just lost her 18 year old Doxie and has been so sad. She found a rescue in TX (we‚Äôre in WA) but couldn‚Äôt leave the sibling behind so she‚Äôll be getting TWO pups transported to her in a few weeks. Win! Win! WIN!!! üê∂üê∂
Kamala Harris is reportedly losing favorite status in the tumultuous Biden veepstakes. Here's why.
Biden needs someone to effectively be the President for him, on account of his dementia.  Biden's campaign is going to force him to pick a VP that they can control as easily as they control him, because there's a decent chance that Biden will die in office.
If he wins, can Biden call fraud and sue the government like Trump threatened to yesterday? Then, while we wait for that to get cleared up, Pelosi can be acting president. Sounds like trump gave us a plan for when he cheats.
I bash Trump. I bash Biden. I bash anyone who is an idiot m including you. I'm an American, that's OUR right.
Thanks for the shout out!  Will follow and follow back as soon as I‚Äôm out of Twitter jail. #ResistersUnited #StrongerTogether
I‚Äôve been cruising along telling myself that it‚Äôs all just media looking for controversy and clicks and the vetting process and Biden are insulated .. BUT TODAY I‚ÄôM MAD.
...She won't be everyone's 1st choice? Has Biden signaled that his choice will be someone OTHER than Kamala Harris? Somewhat concerning, but please let's not have another 'Tim Kaine' moment this late in the game.
Vote Biden so we can get trump out yang ia not running anymore
If he can't/won't face down old white dems, no reason to believe he can face down old white republicans.  This has turned into a test of Biden's strength &amp; command ability.
Me: ‚ÄúBiden‚Äôs Vp pick is very important because they‚Äôll likely end up being POTUS.‚Äù  You: ‚ÄúWhy do you want Trump to win?‚Äù
EXACTLY!!!! WTF is she even talking about?!!!!! 151K Americans dead!!! That progress?!!! Then yeah, that goes away with Biden thank goodness!!
What an ignorant, idiotic, claim. Let's turn it around: Trump v Biden = Fascist dictatorship v democratic constitutional republic (America). Biden has never been a socialist, nor was Obama. Much to your chagrin, Bernie didn't get the nomination.
Are you having a conversation with someone else? I said nothing about trump. Biden is a better alternative than Trump and should win. That has nothing to do with what I was saying.
We CANNOT let fuckin trump get re-elected we have to settle for Biden any change is good at this point
They‚Äôre so frustrating. They would rather talk about Biden‚Äôs voting history and comments from DECADES ago and make judgements instead of looking to 2008-2016 when he was VP. üôÑ
Karen wants to go to brunch and stop hearing about immigrant detention centers and if you dont know how hard it is for her to hear about those things thats what privilige is. Thats why Biden's great because then no one will mention it.
Obama didn‚Äôt announce Biden as his VP until two days before the convention.
Mehdi, get smart and stop this sh*t ‚Äì‚Äì¬†this right here "there is a strong case to be made"? what case? who put you in charge of those cases? First, you were badmouthing #Biden now Kamala?   Might as well come out as a Trump supporter.  VP pick is Biden's call. End of story.
Bernie‚Äôs chance was 2016, things have regressed with Trump and now Biden *is* progress. Twitter pile-ons, throwing tantrums at caucuses and protest voting is NOT ‚Äúprogressive‚Äù. üôÑ I wish some of them would be honest and say they want to be saved financially.
Um yuck
I don't really care. Whoever it is will be more on the ball than Biden.
With Biden you're asking for a very long neoliberal plunge at best and just as much authoritarian fascism as Trump at worst. It's not like protests are just going to stop when he wins, what do you think he's going to do?
You make no sense. I didn't vote for McConnell Jordan or a litany of other assholes. I think branding Biden as sexist is an unsupportable claim.
Because even if Trump is slightly worse (and he may not be) you get 4 more years of him, as opposed to a Biden/whatever admin where he steps down after his first term and his VP gets it for another 8 after that?

If Joe Biden wins, he's gonna personally come to your home and make you drink an illegal immigrant's piss.
No, its churches and bars, and morons like you that went and got tested because you were curious and not actually sick. Also I guess you are a pedophile that sniffs kids since you support Biden, I mean if we are Hillbillies, then you are a pedophile. Aren't assumptions great.

Can anyone explain how Biden benefits from mail in votes? Both parties vote this way. I get tiny brains don‚Äôt get this but WTF
So $600 /week extra for a full quarter, would come to $195 billion, or roughly 5% of our entire federal budget. And that $195 billion would go right back into the economy generating GDP and revenue for sales and other taxes.  It's a no brainer!
"only hope"?  Nonsense. Congress still matters  Biden will deliver relief &amp; reform... less than the left would like, but still a vast improvement over Trump
I‚Äôm confused, you disagree with my statement that Biden would be a better President than Trump?
Joe Biden simply being more polite than Trump is not a reason to believe he wouldn't be doing something very similar. The man's got a pretty fascist legacy of his own
i hate that South Carolina ploy... ffs  SC hasnt voted for D in a general election since 1964.  Bernie wins Iowa.. crickets (Usually over at that point) Bernie wins California.. crickets (Usually over at that point) Biden wins SC... OMG ITS OVEr!!!!!!!!!!

I didn't say there wasn't ANY difference lol, don't strawman me. But it'd be pretty na√Øve not to see the natural progression from the Obama/Biden policies to what Trump is doing now.
Yes! Biden is a dangerous man and the democrats are scary.
I mean, that IS why Biden is where he is right now and not Bernie.
She's also spent plenty of time trashing the Democratic party including saying Biden was running in the wrong party. I don't think she's been good on question 1 either.
The VP pick means that much to some people? You're gonna vote Trump because Biden didn't pick a Latino Veep? Children in cages and hateful cruel policies are OK because you feel left out? Trump didn't pick a Latino VP now did he? Nah he went with a hhhwhite  ass VP didn't he?
I may have to vote for #Biden but if the dem's don't throw their complete support behind cannabis legalization and mitigation, then all of my donations will only go to pot activists and nothing to the dems.

I was sad Elizabeth Warren didn't win  I would have supported Sanders if he'd won  But Democratic primary voters chose Biden  So I'm joining all anti-Fascists in a grand center-liberal-left coalition to defeat Trump
What does that have to do with anything? I was talking about Biden‚Äôs ability to finish his term. When Biden has taken the presidency will you still be comparing him to Donald Trump in order to make him look competent?

But then, if Joe Biden picked Ed Rendell to pick the VP, how can you trust Joe Biden....?
But with Biden's age a factor we want a woman who will rep and stan all the issues at a moment's notice.
Will you retract this tweet when Biden shows up for his debate with Trump?
President Trump, Secretary of State Pompeo, and Vice President Pence, their efforts against the US epidemic and a series of measures were undermined by the Democratic Party, who used American lives to seek power for themselves.  Joe Biden, you will be cast aside.
It‚Äôs astounding such a large number of people continue to support Trump in the face of his avoidant and self-centered agenda.   The rest of us yearn for a real leader to navigate this crisis.   #Biden
No, this is a bad take.  Tiktok is a security issue. Biden should not play politics here.
All the plausible candidates have roughly the same issue positions, they'll all have four years to build a public profile, relationships on Capitol Hill, etc.  If Biden were considering Joe Manchin and Barbara Lee, there'd be some stakes. But he's not!

Now that Trump's hand-picked lackeys are in charge, Voice of America is deleting stories deemed "too favorable" to Joe Biden from its foreign language broadcasts and threatening to fire the employees that produced them
A gracious admission  Article showed Sanders polling better than Biden among *likely Democratic voters* but "Biden performed best among *moderates* at 38%"  Poll also vastly overestimated black vote for Sanders
Also, wanting to be President should be a REQUIREMENT for the VP job. You‚Äôre literally second in line and the backup POTUS.   Biden is gonna be 78 when he takes office if he wins. We better have a VP who wants to be POTUS!
The Seattle Times editorial board published their presidential endorsement for the November general election: Joe Biden.  Previously, they had endorsed Amy Klobucher, not just for the Democratic presidential primary and the presidency.
Pompeo hit with subpoena after he‚Äôs caught assisting Senate GOP‚Äôs political smear of Biden #SmartNews  Now if they could just enforce it.
Also? Separately this scares me - we absolutely need someone who is ready to run in 2024. Biden will be 82 by the start of 2025.
Just so you know, Bill Gates and Joe Biden use 2 factor encryption to lock their Twitter accounts. This wasn't guessing anyone's password, because that isn't possible. This story is a joke and this kid had lots of help accessing a Twitter server.
There is too much speculation about who he chooses as VP. There are many talented women to choose from. But if they aren't chosen they would be excellent members of the administration and cabinet. It's hard to envision Biden afraid of ambition. He'll benefit from the energy
The Young Obama-Biden Chronicles.
Postpone the Election? That Could Mean President Biden
I was interviewed for the 1st time in my life this past June for the below article.  I learned a lot.  But as  is about to make his VP announcement, I think I should share it.
New Yahoo News/YouGov poll: Most Trump voters say they will not accept the 2020 results if Biden ...
It‚Äôs a heightened debate because Biden is clearly unfit and the VP will likely have to finish his term before running as the incumbent in 2024, which makes it super wild that they haven‚Äôt been picked yet.
üá∫üá≤Biden 2020üá∫üá≤ üåüHe's not Trumpüåü
Ok, it pisses me off that someone says, "I want Biden to choose a black woman for VP."  THAT'S CRAP!  I want Biden to pick someone with whom he is confident and comfortable having as a VP!  I don't care if they are PURPLE, male or female!
If Trump is so fucking terrible that we need to vote for anyone marginally better in comparison, why is it *Biden* that the Dems trot out for that? What makes you think that if that was who they picked, they give a single flying fuck about what we want after the win?
Biden 2020: Settling for you because I fucking have to.  Large bumper sticker, real truth.
When we are at ‚ÄúWell at least we don‚Äôt put acid on you while we stuff you in the wood chipper‚Äù lesser of two evils ain‚Äôt saying much.   Is there daylight between Trump and Biden? Yeah, but it‚Äôs the daylight just before twilight and it just keeps getting darker.
And, as Rara said, if Biden is so weak that this pressure on him to be better, on the Democratic establishment to make even a vague effort to reflect the will of the people, is what makes him lose, how viable was he?
Who is CEO of twitter? How close is he to the Clinton's Podesta, Obama, Biden, et al.?
This ONE tweet from Biden Oct 2019 is reason alone to vote for him. #VOTE
Why so you assume anyone criticize Biden isn‚Äôt voting for him?
And if you don‚Äôt see how marginalized communities that have been dealing with 40+ years of this behavior from the Dems, just not quite so brazenly naked, then *you* are doing more to help Trump than anyone criticizing Biden.
Trump won with a plurality  Sanders lost both times  Among all Democratic candidates, Sanders was the only one so ideologically polarizing he might have lost to Trump
That said, I think she‚Äôs a formidable senator, and I‚Äôm willing to be convinced that her positions on criminal justice have changed. Wouldn‚Äôt be upset w/a Biden-Harris ticket.  Plus she‚Äôs a fellow Montr√©alais (kinda) :-)
Biden himself wasn‚Äôt a practical alternative until just before Super Tuesday - what changed?
But so far as I can tell, having listened to all of these candidates over the past year, Kamala seems to me to be the best campaigner, the best one to have out there on the stump, the most commanding voice of them all. Biden can be firm and presidential. Kamala can spit fire.
Calling historical facts ‚Äúhistorical propaganda‚Äù lends no weight to your argument. Nonetheless, I do wish Andrew had remained in the race longer, but no one can say exactly how that would have played out. Establishment Dems did their best to undo candidates other than Biden.
Attack ad idea: Have Biden on camera publicly asking the question (every opportunity he gets) ‚ÄòHas this man told you the truth, about anything, ever?‚Äô And then 60 seconds of constant lies. Fade to black, voiceover ‚ÄòNo‚Äô as a big N &amp; O appear on screen. {fin}
Benghazi is old news &amp; endless hours have been spent on it without wrong doing being revealed. She's a strong smart woman who has worked with Biden for 8 years!

POTUS is pushing the vaccine. He said he'll have it distributed through the military. You trust him? I don't. Not that Biden is any improvement.
until song inspiration/new indignation ignite... WEAPON OF CHOICE (BIDEN)
Yes, the clear choice is Joe Biden.  It's time to clean house and get rid of the current corrupt, traitorous, grifting administration.  We need a president who shares our values, not one who lies and only thinks of himself.
At least Biden would be President to 100% vs iq45  30%
But Biden has been building so much momentum! How can you not get excited?!?
Good for this guy. But don‚Äôt forget‚Äîthis should be the default stance of every American: that this presidency was a mistake that bankrupted our nation morally, geopolitically, and in terms of our own democracy, and that voting for Joe Biden is THE imperative, corrective action.
Awwww, don‚Äôt talk about Joe Biden that way! ü§£
Joe Biden wasn't in charge of budget approval, or the budget at all for that matter - that was the GOP lead Congress...
N-nooo, literally progressives have HATED having to vote for Biden and would LOCK Clinton up if this isn‚Äôt weird right wing conspiracy. The problem is y‚Äôall politicize MASKS and make it harder to tell what SHOULD be debated and talked about and what should be shut tf down. Jesus.
Guess what, Dan Rather Not? ZERO positive responses to YOU, even on "Twatter." I see it every day. Same for Biden. You SCUM will use ANYTHING but DEMOCRACY to win! That reflects the TRUE nature of the Left. The ends justifies the means. We will CRUSH you.
My assumption is that the Biden team looks at this and says ‚Äúnah, who else are they going to vote for‚Äù
but what's really gonna rock is Biden choosing to give his concession speech right after that ("for the good of the country", he later explains, "i did not want us to be divided any further")
Sometimes I think it‚Äôs disgusting strategy- get a black woman VP, and make sure everyone hates her, so the election is spent focusing on her instead of Biden. He gets to skate through the election without anyone coming for him.   But they probably just hate ambitious black women.
Oh, Fuck a duck! Come on! If you can game, tik-tok, twitch and scratch your own ass...you can google the shit you need to know. Trump is the reason you can't go to Europe,  back to school or to the bars..Joe Biden will get us back to a normalcy.
How Joe Biden got greener
Yeah you're right, Biden is making serious strides toward socialism by (checks notes) flat-out refusing to pursue medicare for all, publicly stating that anarchists at protests should be tracked down and jailed, and absolutely snubbing the left in favor of courting independents.
I agree Biden isn‚Äôt the best choice but he is vastly better than Trump and can work between the parties unlike Trump. I‚Äôm not insane, I‚Äôm just practical given options.
Biden picking a VP who doesn‚Äôt want to be the party‚Äôs nominee in 2024 is extremely dumb and therefore feels all-too-likely
Ukraine to investigate leaked tapes with ex-president, Biden is part of the Russian interference program. Ukraine is pressured by Trump to have cronies generate this can't see it but we have it BS. Deflect, Lie, Distract. Trump &amp; Rudy at work.
she can beat Biden off write-ins
The most important criterion in the VP pick should be the ability of the VP to run a successful Presidential campaign at the end of Biden‚Äôs term. It will take years to repair the damage Trump and his lickspittle  enablers have done.

We can expect  to Invite someone to come testify in December. After Biden loses a rigged election and Republicans are set to take the gavel from Pelosi and give it to Jim Jordan in January. But we‚Äôll get to enjoy some good Pelosi lectures about poor Dem turn out.
i've said this all along.  every one of the dem candidates this year would make an amazing president.  i really believe that.  BUT I simply think 2 old people is a bad idea.  if biden weren't so old, i'd have no issues with EW but he's is. and so is she.  it matters.
Joe Biden should address the Nation Sunday night concerning what should happen in support of the millions about to be thrown into the street due to the republicans and their ongoing program of serfdom for most of us.
as if the Biden campaign would use the official Joe Biden account's DMs to do anything.
And in this instance, the wrestlers did a really bad job at their fight choreography. Getting someone to admit for having voted for Biden is like pulling teeth.  It's like if the wrestlers were standing 20 feet apart and a mouthbreather next to me turns and says "Whatta punch!!"

Yeah Trump needs all 3 off 1) polls to tighten to Biden +6 or better 2) a 2016-size miss on the national polling 3) a 2016-size miss on swing state WWC polling, despite much better effort by pollsters.  It's not *crazy*, but it's *unlikely*
Why would you vote for Biden? You seem to be a rational person who understands facts. Or is that a persona you portray to grift? Even Tim Pool seems to be more balanced and he's a Democrat. He's expressed horror at seeing a Biden presidency. As confusing as your Clinton licking.
Every political party is imperfect, by design-- they're coalitions aligned roughly around common values. Adults choose the party that better aligns with their values. If you think Joe Biden and Donald Trump align equally with your values, that says a lot about those values.
I give Biden a lot of credit for not falling into the trap.  I hope it holds.

Ah, but there's the rub. No matter what Joe Biden brings you, the Republicans will claim he made it up. You need an independent Justice and an independent President to remove this most obvious of gambits.
Joe Biden can utter words of empathy to try to convince people he genuinely cares but the absolute truth is "IT'S ALL ABOUT VOTES" and everyone knows it!  Joe Biden 40+ year political career of "non-change", "business as usual" proves he doesn't care about the American Public.

That a blatant lie.  How soon we forget that Biden and Obama inherited the worst economy since the great depression after Bush.  Trump inherited an awesome economy that had been growing for years only to trash it.

Calling it now. In 10 years, centrist Dems will lovingly embrace Trump as he calls out the then Republican nut case. Not without good reason, of course. Maybe Donald will slip Jill Biden a cough drop or paint some pictures.

JOE BIDEN, explain if you have nothing to hide!He's criticizing vote by mail so his voters will vote in person and Biden voters will vote by mail. Then his minion that runs the USPS will shut down mail delivery in swing states, disenfranchising Biden voters and getting himself reelected.

Talk to your boy
You mean the Hunter Biden "investigation" that turned up nothing by Trumps FBI? Keep deflecting morons.
She is with senile Joe Biden
The same for Biden both Obamba andBiden ware as a fact not working for America but other countries. Obama took a knee and bowed to other leaders. Trump got so much more done in first 3/1/2 yrs then they did in 8 yrs. Let‚Äôs learn from that instead of voting for the failures again
I meant elected not re-elected. Biden will be black mailed along with the rest of the Dems who are beholden. Therefore they will not represent us but China. We have to stop them.
He won‚Äôt get re-elected, Changing the subject did anyone notice how bloated her face is. Looks like alcoholism is getting her. She‚Äôll be sluring her words again and she is stark raving mad. Dems are held by money from China as you know Biden is on the hook and so are the Obamas
Seems like you owe Biden an apology.
Why Electing Joe Biden Will Make The Culture War Even Worse
*narrator voice* Biden has never touched an electronic device, let alone has any idea what they are.
Really? Biden is the moral bastion you want to hold up as an example?
He sees the internal polling. Repubs, as well as himself are going to get routed. So, he is going to do everything he can to try and contest the election. Do not be surprised if Biden wins be 5-10% and then Trump sues and tries to use the 12th amendment to overturn the election.
I'm more certain now that Trump won't win in November than I was in 2016. And in 2016 I was 98.7% sure he wasn't going to beat Hillary. Biden is going to win in a runaway. Not cause he's better than Trump, but because Trump keeps being an idiot on Twitter.
And who do you think is hiding in the Trogen horse? That‚Äôs the scary thought. What if Biden choses Pelosi for his vice. That would be a painful  out come üòÇüòÇüòÇ
Its been way obvious that yur wife doesn't like to even hold yur hand in Public,Are U jealous that Biden can have a woman on his arm!How many times did yur wife turn her head when U attempted to kiss her? On camera no less!!
OK, Fleetwood Mac...  ...the US has a great human rights record.  Capitalism is the best thing to happen to the American worker.  Joe Biden will make everything fine...you might even say he'll make America great again.
Biden was polling at 5.4% before the IA caucus, and then dropped out after placing fifth, behind Clinton, Obama, Edwards, and Bill Richardson.
That's not historically how it has worked though, and setting up new rules for a certain candidate to fail at is biased. Joe Biden himself was selected for the VP after withdrawing after the IA caucus in 2008. Probably polling poorly, which is why he didn't want to go on to NH.
Can we get Cuomo for president and Biden as the VP üòî
You go girl, hope to see more of you for a long time to come!  BLM BIDEN 2020!
Karma's a bitch.üëçüòÅ
Is biden racist as well then
Well, he is going to vote for Biden, so I guess that makes him black (per Joe).
Anything less than a landslide, namely Biden winning fewer than 45 states, and Trump will spend the next few weeks challenging the result in as many states as he can.
i am begging for literally any reason beyond not being Trump to vote for Biden and he can't even bother to do that.
With Barr saying yesterday that a separate investigation into the Obama/Biden administration illegal unmasking‚Äôs, this all but eliminates Susan Rice.
Joe Biden does not "understand" a persons struggles.   He got rich through 50 years of politics. It's these politicians I refuse to vote for.
Anyone with the last name ‚ÄúRothschild‚Äù has no room to talk. Idc if you‚Äôre actually related. Cause anyone who knows what a Rothschild is would do a name change. Also, fuck Biden and trump
If TRUMP called on and ordered martial law. I wouldn't worry. If Oblabla had ordered martial law, "I'd be so worried". If slidin Biden was elected and ordered martial law.  It would be all over for America.
If I lived in a swing state I would very reluctantly vote Biden but since I do not he can go fuck himself
Well Joe Biden did say that if you don't vote for him, you ain't black.
These+many other states U lied to will vote BIDEN or U wouldn't have mentioned it! Yur a predictable LIAR!!
No I will never understand and I will never claim to understand. But I also won‚Äôt shame people that try to understand. However, with this particular situation, I‚Äôm not saying I love Biden and want Biden, I‚Äôm saying I don‚Äôt want trump and I just see a 2016 round 2
I'm already not voting for Biden or Trump but  the Democrats writing the platform are really making me not want to vote for them ever again. I hope all you old fuckers rot.
that‚Äôs exactly what trump does. he doesn‚Äôt care about POC either sis go do YOUR own research of racist things he has said and done. like i said i don‚Äôt like biden either, but i absolutely do NOT want trump in office
that‚Äôs your only argument... where did i say i like hillary or obama??? i don‚Äôt even like biden but id rather have him in office than the person we have now

I won't vote for Biden if Harris is on the ticket with him.
And that bill didn't fuel systematic racism?  Not voting for Joe Biden did you think I was?
You are mistaken, this country is a better place to live because of President Trump! Unless you are desiring a communist country! Socialism is exactly what Joe Biden‚Äôs puppet masters (AOC, Bernie Sanders, Pelosi, etc) want. Joe is incapable of resisting anyone in his condition

I don't get why Biden's wife is allowing him to do this. Clearly he has dementia. Dems are up to something and maybe she's going along because of their hatred for Trump.

Well, actually she could run against Biden or his replacement if he is 1 term. With the way voting is going I think we‚Äôre about to see new precedents set. We‚Äôre at points where Millennials and Gen Z will make up majority of voters.
I can‚Äôt for the life of me understand why every time something happens that Trump doesn‚Äôt like he calls it ‚ÄúBiden‚Äôs America‚Äù like does he not realize he‚Äôs still the president
It is as bad as having options of Trump and Biden.
Please make Obama and Biden and Clintons accountable for one of the biggest political crimes against Trump and against the homeowners of America.  American homes are being stolen transferring the wealth of Americans to the elite and Trump should never have had to endure this.
Joe Biden, I will consider voting for you if you promise to send these DHS goons to every golf course Trump uses.

Biden is not in support of defunding police.  That said we do need to look at the roles and scope of what we are asking law enforcement to serve.
Actually, what‚Äôs hardest for me to believe is that the vast majority of people who say they will vote for Biden are doing so not because they believe in Biden, but because they are anti-Trump.  That‚Äôs cutting off your nose to spite your face!
I‚Äôve seen some odd tweets over the years but showing America under Trump and saying that Biden would also be like this doesn‚Äôt seem particularly well thought out.
Good luck with Biden.  He will be a puppet at best, while his handlers rape and pillage  the American people.  Ever notice all of the Trump Signs?  People are inhuman and destroy others property because of hatred for Trump.  Another 2020 Win AZ nd we'll witness the crying again.

Well, he is going to vote for Biden, so I guess that makes him black (per Joe).
They should be shaming biden into getting better policies.

My prediction, pin it.  Nov 3rd Trump loses countable popular vote 55% - 42%. Election called by networks for Buden.  Trump then says he needs mail in votes counted. Within a week, it is clear outcome for Biden.  Trump then claims mail in votes rigged against him.  Jan 20, Biden

If SOMEHOW Trump wins, it will immediately be called into question, and rightfully so. There was pro-Trump interference last time, not to mention all the active suppression occurring now. If Biden wins, Trump will claim foreign interference and suspend the results.
No, he shouldn‚Äôt b/c that would give the GOP time to offer up a more legit candidate who could potentially beat Biden.  Plus, I wanna see trump get his fat ass kicked. üò¨ #WeWillVote

Wow. Republicans REALLY don‚Äôt want Kamala Harris as Biden‚Äôs VP. They‚Äôre flooding Twitter with negative shit. Must mean they‚Äôre scared of her.
If Biden becomes incapacitated, I want someone who is as tough as nuts waiting in the VP slot, in order to deal with the Trumpista uprising that would follow. (In reality, I don't think it will come to that: I expect the House to hand Trump the presidency in January.)
Yeah, I was generally curious.  I am hoping it‚Äôs Harris because I think she is a strong candidate and could be a good leader overall.  Assuming Biden can win, realistically he‚Äôs not going to serve 8 years.  Harris seems to have more experience than some others on the short list.
what is Biden arguing? I mean on his ‚Äúgood days‚Äù when he is able to string a complete sentence together. The world is still hugely dependent on oil&amp;gas -actually more so than in the 60‚Äôs. No other energy source comes close to oil/gas in running the world‚Äôs industry and commerce.

You are aware that Biden and Obama did do things in 8 years... such as their Every Student Succeeds Act, which gave grants to public chools to spend on planned diversity. Effectively opening of educational opportunities to minorities. Trump repealed it. üòÇüòÇ
Fucking Biden was vice president over the 8 years that black unemployment went from 16.5 to 7%. Biden has been proposing national bans on chokeholds, racial biased training in police. Meanwhile, Trump is too busy using his Gestapo to beat the shit out of everyone.
Only one way - elect Joe Biden and kick your sorry a** out of the Whitehouse.
Because, unlike Trump, Biden has been campaigning to work on solutions to the issues and reversing the damage of the crime bill. Trump has been spending hid time protecting statues - pieces of metal - and sending in troops to beat the shit out of peoppe.
That‚Äôs why no matter who Biden will end up picking, I intend to unite the major progressives in politics as well as alternative media so that we can primary the HELL out of Biden‚Äôs VP in 2024, where I intend to WIN next time, no ifs, &amp;s, or buts about it.
It‚Äôs totally &amp; utterly irrelevant to care about Biden‚Äôs VP because the fact of the matter is NOTHING we truly care about as progressives will actually be accomplished under Biden during his 4 yrs in office, REGARDLESS of who his VP pick actually is.
That‚Äôs exactly right Ana! Who gives a f**k about who Biden‚Äôs VP given that Nina Turner &amp; Barbara Lee are NOT in consideration. Warren is malleable, Kamala is a flip-flopper, &amp; the others are just very standard politicians that stand for NOTHING!

Trump's family owns patents on the voting machines which makes me very nervous. I think the real reason he is opposed to mail ballots is due to some scam with the voting machines or the "roll-up" process between the machines &amp; the local/national tally centers - use mail. #Biden
Beware, it's Trump who is trying to rig the election. He placed one of his cronies in charge of the USPS who is laying off and banning overtime to delay the mail while Barr is trying to pass laws to throw out any late mail in ballots. At least he's obvious. #Biden #VoteByMail
Trump is the only one trying to rig the election. We won't let it happen. There will be more election observers around than we used to monitor corrupt dictators like Marcos. Of course, Trump is so corrupt even the Reagan foundation rejects him. #Biden #VoteBlue #VoteByMail2020

They aren‚Äôt dug in the way that that guy described it, though. As evidenced by the Lincoln Project and similar organizations, a lot of Republicans will be voting for Biden to oust Trump.  If they weren‚Äôt, Trump wouldn‚Äôt be getting slaughtered in the polls.
I am positive I would trust Kamala Harris if she had to move into the Presidency because of Biden illness, he is 78....
I suspect bullcrap.  Nobody has put forth the names of these so called "biden donors.
Ridiculous, I suspect Biden's white hairs to be at the head of this, the rich bastards who would "let Biden" be President but want to pick his VP.
I would like to know the names of these "biden money donors" who are leaning on him heavily not to pick her.  Do they have another agenda?
This is definitely closer than accusing Biden of being a Marxist but imo it‚Äôs still not really true
Crazy that the president tweeted his pro segregation viewpoint today and no one is very surprised- even crazier that Biden is probably mad that trump just stole his whole flow

Crazy Nancy Pelosi said I made a mistake when I banned people from infected China from entering the U.S. in January. Tens of thousands of lives were saved, as she danced in the Streets of Chinatown (SF) in late February. Biden agreed with her, but soon admitted that I was right!
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.  #TrumpThreatensAmerica
Trump makes up lies against Biden, he never said he would defund the police, that is something the protesters started, Biden is a Moderate Democrat, not a radical left wing.
by the way, Biden has never said he is for "Defund the Police" this was made up by protesters and Anarchists.  His VP , the same, they think that is a dangerous move.
Editorial: The Times editorial board recommends Joe Biden for president | The Seattle Times
If anyone who supports Trump is getting cold feet, thinking everything will calm down if they vote for Biden, they need to look at how that has worked for the liberal mayors and businesses across the country. A Trump win combined with a Republican House will shit this down!
Really?  You actually are making fun of Joe Biden?  Why would you do that,  do you want trump to win?  If I hear this again, I will delete you.
in summary Biden's biggest weakness as a candidate is that he has a mouth on his face
I guess it makes sense if they‚Äôve bought into the idea that Biden is a secret socialist but yeah he just said he doesn‚Äôt want any more corporate legislation so üòÇ
Why is this a gender issue? Trump offends people irrespective of gender, a bully does that and it does not justify the behavior, but it means it is not gender. He behaves that way with a male Purple Heart winner, male journalist, Biden, Obama, Jeb Bush etc. Lack of decorum, yes.
Warren, on Biden‚Äôs shortlist for VP, specializes in skewering bank CEOsSince Bernie suspended his campaign on April 8, what policies has Biden embraced? I don‚Äôt even know his platform.  I‚Äôm not aware of anything, seriously, that shows is even in the race. He said that nothing will change and so far that‚Äôs the case.
Is this why Biden postponed his announcement by a week?
It's amazing your supporters have the nerve to claim Joe Biden has dementia while hocking your addled old mind.  I'm confident they don't know how pathetic it makes them look.
Biden Will Not Do A Thing For We The People But Cause Problems For Them Just Like Trump
I know what you mean. The outcome sucks either way. You Think Trump is more dangerous than Biden?
Who do you think Joe Biden will pick as his VP running mate?
this is nothing to do with biden or obama. why are you making this political?
Oh there are defiantly boot lickers in the bunch &amp; BlueMaga for sure but there are people, myself included, that think Biden will beat, degrade, &amp; blame progressives but he is far less likely to outright kill. Dem propaganda requires the illusion of fairness, &amp; we can use that.
Going to do control-F on Davis‚Äô new book about socal in the 60s, search for every mention of a young woman named Karen, and attribute all those anecdotes to Biden‚Äôs vp
Wait... that math is... Are you saying you want Biden to step aside for his VP to run in four years?
I'm not voting for him but only because I am in a safe blue district. I think the reason people are voting for Biden, as wretched as he is, is because its a two party system &amp; Trump if given the chance will commit genocide &amp; Biden is far less likely to do so. Its so fucked.
I cringe harder every time we all collectively pretend Joe Biden and his campaign aren‚Äôt awful lmao
When was the last time Joe Biden did an interview? I haven‚Äôt seen one in a long time. But his wife‚Äôs out there doing interviews? Seems really weird to me. What is Biden hidin from?
I assume Biden thinks he‚Äôll be labeled a socialist if he does, I think he should just say fk it but the only demographic Biden is actually in touch with are Boomers, and UBI is still a difficult pill for most of them to swallow, same reason I imagine Biden‚Äôs against legal weed.
No matter who Biden picks for VP, the right wing will tear her apart. But she/we will prevail.
Everyone should be concerned and want to get rid of the bad seeds:
His campaign is no longer about Biden. It‚Äôs about how he steals the election.
Omg I think Obama will be a presidential advisor to Biden and Biden will become a puppet president.
If this doesn't make us aware of the huge opportunity for fraud.  Too many ways for bad people to mess with this election. ////...[ States are scrambling to stop a slow-motion 2020 election disaster
Voting for Biden isn't going to save a single life under threat in the next 6 months. Rioting might. You don't seem to understand that the nomination of Biden is a statement that America has failed to save itself by voting
Oh they did? Isn't that amazing? I'm pretty sure your awesome vote for Biden will help you defund the very people you hold in high regard, way to use your head!
If Bernie‚Äôs ego hadn‚Äôt compelled him to run Biden wouldn‚Äôt be the nominee. Democrats only rallied to Biden to keep Bernie from winning. Without Bernie this Primary would have turned out differently. Now the choice is Trump or Biden and 4 more years of Trump will fkn destroy us.
Trump VS Biden is actually:  Self-identified Americans VS Demoralized Commie Insurgents.
Biden versus Trump. Some speculate that the future of the republic hinges on the outcome of the next election. But for smart investors it doesn't really matter who wins.
The Democratic Party isn‚Äôt united enough for the establishment in charge of it to survive past 2020. Biden will win, and afterwards every liberal who is pissed off and resentful of the corruption and incompetence of the DNC now, will still be pissed off when Biden is in office.
is trashing trump all you care about?  I guess you are a Biden guy.  We have cities being trashed, officials lying about covid numbers and you sound like you are drooling to bash trump.
Not on economic issues, per se. But on like, I don‚Äôt know, cancel culture maybe. Boaters. CHAZ. Mount Rushmore. The Suburban Lifestyle Dream. Biden outflanking Bernie to the left on Suburban Lifestyle Dreams, in some difficult to articulate sense.
People have been afraid to mention this, but Trump tells it like it is: Biden has moved to the left even of Bernie.

Also, I know Biden people can't wait for the debates.  Senile? What's with the constant Trump sniffing into the Microphone during the 2016 debates?  You forget his performances were awful. Tell him to lay off the Sudafed!
Dale clearly you haven't heard.  The Biden senile thing isn't working.  Why do you think the losing Trump campaign has gone dark to change it's message.  I'm starting to wonder if you aren't the senile one.
Obama cause then Trump can get re-elected and deal with the Clinton pedophilia ring. Biden won‚Äôt go after Clinton.
If and when the democrats take the Senate the first priorities should be is getting many of the bills that the house passed and are just sitting in McConnells graveyard passed. That will help a lot of people right away. and set a positive tone for the Biden administration.
When Biden is elected in 95 days he will tap Inslee to come to DC and run the EPA or Dept of Interior.... logjam broken up

Anarchists don't need to burn down the White House ‚Ä¶ just vote for Biden &amp; turn it into a nursing home.
I have one question for Biden ‚Ä¶ count backwards from 100 subtracting 7.  This is a standard question for stage 3 &amp; 4 Alzheimer's patients.   Tuesday my wife was asked this question by her neurologist ‚Ä¶ she failed.
If Biden is elected he will be the 1st. titular POTUS in our history.
In your wet and wild dreams Biden would shred Trump he is a loser in life and can't even complete a sentence.He thinks he is a cognitive genius because he can string five words together and identify 3 animals. Kindergartners can do that!
Women are much more lokely to be crushed by Trump. He‚Äôs got, what? sixty pounds of flab on Biden?  If one of them tripped on the top stair I‚Äôd much rather try to catch Biden. (Not sure I‚Äôd risk trying to catch Donald.)
I know. Crazy. Which is why we need a much larger turnout than any other time in history.  Changes need to be made to correct established systems that don't benefit all of us.  W/Biden in the WH, the racists will head back in the closet or suffer hefty consequences for actions.
Yang literally says his plans are to run for President in 2024 even against Biden, short term is to elect Humanity Forward candidates. I think you misunderstand Yang‚Äôs attitude/philosophy towards failure, it doesn‚Äôt break him, he learns from it and uses the experience to improve.
Well that should be your sign. Biden with or without dementia is still a million times better choice as president than the traitor and criminal pretending to be there now.
Oh don‚Äôt worry, Biden won‚Äôt hit Inslee. Biden won‚Äôt be elected. Biden is a barely breathing corpse.
Biden is a Trojan horse, just like Obama, just like the Clintons.
And if it's Kamala, why would she drop out? If it was anyone in the race, why would they suspend their campaign? Why js Barack Obama fighting so hard to support Biden just for him to drop out?

I actually think people aren‚Äôt being too unreasonable here. The explicit content of my tweet was anodyne, but you could think the intended implication was an attack on Biden, especially depending on who you saw retweeting it.
20 bucks that Joe Biden didn't actually make that tweet and his handler did instead
I think if Warren is VP, and takes an active role and helps make sure Biden‚Äôs administration is extremely successful in improving things, it will bolster her case to be president after him by a lot. And I think she‚Äôs the best VP pick to do that as a governing partner.
I jumped in to say that additional donors and volunteers would be useful for Biden. Does that really need proving?
Top woman Joe Biden may pick for VP? The one reading this tweet
it really scares me to think if Biden becomes president what would happen to this country that's a very scary thought
From my perspective it‚Äôs guaranteed that Yang will be in Biden‚Äôs Administration. Biden has gone out of his way to pick Yang‚Äôs brain numerous times, Yang is clearly someone Biden wants to work with, and the Obama Administration were the first to even discover Yang in the first.
You're giving the DNC too much credit. There's a reason why so many dropped out around the same time. They were told to in exchange for a promised job in the Biden administration. Hell, before Bernie stalled his campaign, Obama gave him a phone call. So much effort for that.
Their only hope is to convince Trump not to run so a more acceptable opponent for Biden can be at the top of the ballot. I wonder if a financial package is being prepared to get him to abdicate. He‚Äôll also need a country to take him in so he can avoid prosecution. Russia? Turkey?
The troops in Portland are there because the sitting president ordered them there. If Biden ordered them there, they would go as well under his command. It‚Äôs shitty, and also how it works unfortunately. Hope Biden understands that it is unconstitutional.
I LOVE HARRIS and am definitely voting for Biden

Biden could do nothing and still be more helpful. Trump has been actively destructive.
At this point in the game, no. This is, apparently, as good as we are going to get, because of all this immense "Joementum" against "malarkey". The American public has spoken. Give us back our status quo, because Obama. Trump uses Obama. Biden uses Obama. Obama Obama Obama Obama.
And that is what the Biden campaign is doing. They have ruled out white men as not qualified for this particular time in our history. If there weren‚Äôt qualified, capable black women? The campaign would look at other candidates.
Exactly! Also, ever lying, old senile, pussygrabbing Joe Biden is also tRump's exact menatal image!

Do you mean that, as you will do what Mr. Putin wants you to do, Biden will do what "they" want? By "they", do you mean "Radical Left Agenda"? Who is "Radical Left Agenda"? Can you name some of these people, so we can know who you are talking about?
You're asking the wrong question. It's not about being enthusiastic to vote for Biden, it's are you enthusiastic to vote Trump out!

So I told you not to deflect to DT and you have no more comments? You should really think about your Biden support if you can't defend him on his own merits.
Don't deflect. We were discussing a candidate telling people to vote in public during a pandemic and Biden did exactly that.
HE TOLD PEOPLE TO VOTE FOR HIM IN THE PRIMARY DURING THE PANDEMIC!
Published in April of this year... üôÑ
Puts massive pressure on Biden. Right where it needs to be.
Biden told us to vote during the pandemic. You forget that or what?
Trump and Biden are close like the Moon and the Earth are close, but the Moon is still 238,900 miles from Earth, which is 10x the circumference of our planet, so from the perspective of our normal daily lives, the Moon and the Earth are still pretty fkn far apart.

Have the experts been able to prevent anything so far? My guess is that the landslide victory in Biden 's favor will be astronomical. I don't expect Trump to carry one single state at this rate! Mitt Romney may be the only Republican left in 2020 at least in the senate.
Biden predicted this in April. Reopen the schools and economy, but hold off on that election, eh?
Really dude? Biden blew Bernie out. Easily. The Bernie cult went in thinking that they could win by having 4 to 5 other Dems in the race. Bernie couldn't beat Biden one on one. Deal with it. It wasn't that hard to beat him. Democrats vote for Democrats.

It's wrong to say both parties are obsessed with the idea. Only one actor is -- Trump. Biden merely predicted it would happen based on evidence Trump had previously presented, such as suggesting he would like to be president for more than 2 terms. Argue in good faith, please.

I've only seen one sign in Washington for Biden. Seattle is Bernie heavy. Tacoma is Bernie heavy. Bernie filled up the Tacoma Dome. The line stretched for blocks. Biden didn't even come here, yet he won. It is really weird to me how that happened. Everyone dropped the same time.

Glad someone else see's it to Sara, it's not Biden I am worried about it's his running mate, look at who he chooses for his Running Mate, she is the one that we need to be scared of.
Biden‚Äôs a pragmatist. He has a conscience, his own thoughts but his public views/positions are chosen based on what he thinks voters want and he prioritizes Boomer voters over young voters because they vote at higher rates. He‚Äôs an empty suit with bit of soul holding it together.
He‚Äôs surely a meat puppet. I‚Äôve taken care of mentally declining family. Biden lost the light behind his eyes the same exact way. Is there any precedent to the democrats utilizing a bait-and-switch in the last few innings? There‚Äôs no way this can be legitimate.

Trump‚Äôs one and only function is being a Right Wing Culture Warrior, he brings literally nothing else to the table. The choice is Trump or Biden, and Biden is capable of serving more than one function. Given the needs of the moment, I choose the more functional option.

Example. In 2016, Bernie won Washington State by 73% against the wildly popular HRC. In 2020, Bernie held a rally just before the primary and filled a 17,000 people arena. Biden has never been here. Biden won Washington State. Almost 40,000 ballots were invalidated.
A Biden supporting centrist? No thanks.
Joe Biden and his radical left? Lol Take one look at his voting record and you know us lefties and Biden aren‚Äôt on the same page.  But whatever. Trump is a nightmare so I‚Äôll vote Biden.

Straight to ad hominem because you simply can‚Äôt explain the cognitive dissonance here. Biden LITERALLY championed both crime bills that destroyed An entire generation of minority men and women, and is unapologetic to this day. Who‚Äôs ‚Äúsacrificing‚Äù minorities again?
Anyone who cant see that Biden has dementia and is a puppet deserves whatever they get. Keep voting all blue just because. It literally takes no brains to do that. Common sense has left the building.

What incremental change is Biden going to bring exactly? The DNC voted down M4A and marijuana legalization. He‚Äôs called for swift arrests of ‚Äúanarchists‚Äù aka protestors, he‚Äôs told Wall Street &amp; Corporatists no new regulations or taxes, increased defense budget. What change?
"Biden and the far left socialist agenda" democrats, who ya know, just voted against legalizing Marijuana and Medicare on their platformüò¨
I appreciate how hard Tr*mp and Haley are working to convince me I should vote for   #ImVoting4BidenBecause I hope Tr*mp &amp; Haley are right: I have reason to hope Biden would at least listen to rational experts &amp; everyday Americans &amp; work fast to undo Tr*mp's damage.
My favorite thing about republicans right now is that they keep selling that rumor that Joe Biden is an extreme leftist lmao
Corporate Dems also tend to listen to economists over scientists, if you haven't noticed.  Like with many things, it's only convenient to point at when they're not in the driver's seat.  Like how Biden has the NERVE to talk about climate change.
I'm guessing the gifs are supposed to somehow scare people? Oh gee, guess I'll have to vote for Biden now :-/
Sarcasm is appreciated, but if you think Biden os going to redeem the country you‚Äôre delusional.
Actually it's not Biden I will be worried about, though he won't win but if he does I will be worried about his running Mate, now that's the puppet master we need to worry about. Especially when he said he will be bringing in a "Woman of Color" and all of them we've seen, racist

And there is a whole twitterverse who talks about President Trump and every mistake he makes. Meanwhile, Biden can‚Äôt seem to make a coherent sentence anymore, let alone know where he is.
‚ÄúJoe Biden is not the same guy who shellacked Paul Ryan at a vice-presidential debate in 2012, but he's also not a Frankenstein's amalgamation of 40 years of conservative intellectual decline into paranoia and delusion that escaped from the lab in 2016...‚Äù
It would work. They would just forget about those 2 years and blame the deficits on Biden.
I predict ( I do a lot of wrong predicting) that within days of #Biden announcing his VP pick #trump will dump #Pence and replace him with #Haley. Pence would rightfully get vilified in debate with a woman.  #Nostradamus II
Biden That's All We Need Is Another Old Blow Hard
I mean hell, they call BIDEN an anarchist. Like... ü§¶
1978. Biden told us nothing will change.
Just when you thought it couldn‚Äôt get worse. If Biden has any brain cells why did they have to be stuck in 1976? Part of the tragedy is his entire life has been built on plagiarism, stealing from others. He only picks the worst ideas.
Repsect for barr went up to the cieling because of his patience he had with the evil corrupt people. Seriously I was furious on how these people hate America and anything Trump. Even if its common sense and las. Then you have Biden getting softball questions like ‚Äúwhy Delaware‚Äù?
We need Biden #wednesdaymorning
Thank you
The Biden shill part.
I‚Äôd like Biden to be found, arrested, and tried. He‚Äôs more of a criminal than every protester put together.
In the union I work for, which is mostly low wage women, members were all over the place but mostly supported Biden, so you can see a problem if our next move was the flood the streets with a strike against him. The smerican left is still a lot smaller than the support for
In some ways. But also young people just changed the urban majority‚Äôs dude facto view of cop power with a mass uprising and Biden‚Äôs stimulus plans on climate &amp; care work are very good lefty olive branches, so maybe rumors of our death have been exaggerated.
Paradoxically it may never become important to hector lefties to support Biden if he continues cruising to victory without them. But so much the worse for the left: a display of weakness &amp; marginality.
I mean that‚Äôs really not what I said there, but it‚Äôs easy to find places I said ‚Äúright now not the moment to hector lefties to vote Biden, they‚Äôll hear the worst sort of thing whatever we say‚Äù
Joe Biden does NOT dare to up against President Trump because he knows he's no match for him.
Literally every other VEEP candidate is a better choice. If she is VP then of course I will still vote Biden but I probably wont vote for any president in 2024. #AnyoneButHarris
Follow the money. I hope President Joe Biden (speak it into existence) tasks his AG to assign a special prosecutor to investigate every financial decision made by this corrupt administration.
This is a good point re: not voting for Biden because you‚Äôre in a safe blue/red state.  Trump is probably going to question the results anyway, so we need them to be convincingly and unambiguously against him.
Look guys, i just definitively proved that KHive won‚Äôt vote for Biden if Kamala isn‚Äôt VP because I found a random person on twitter saying they won‚Äôt
I‚Äôm calling it. Tammy Duckworth is Biden‚Äôs running mate, it was decided weeks ago, and all the drama surrounding the search is meant to milk attention from the media.
Joe Biden is getting the softest questions ever when they should be asking things like why is he a criminal suspect in Ukraine? Why did he do a Quid Pro Quo threatening a Billion Dollars? Why is he connected to spying on Trumps campaign? He commited treason and is corrupt.
You can vote for loopy Biden, Or Trump, who is a dick.  But wouldn‚Äôt it be more fun, To vote for Crazy Rick? While those in the other WA Are busy misspending our loot, You should support the OWL Party, Because ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt give a hoot!‚Äù  #WhyIDontLikeTrump #Election2020
So thats your response to why Joe Biden is getting the softest questions ever when they should be asking things like why is he a criminal suspect in Ukraine? Why did he do a Quid Pro Quo threatening a Billion Dollars? Why is he connected to spying on Trumps campaign. Treason.
I remember that mood in the country, so many people who thought that Republican divisiveness was a passing trend or limited to George W Bush. Ha. And now we‚Äôve got Bumblefuck Biden preaching the same bullshit. ‚ÄúRemember when you could look a racist in the eye and shake hands?‚Äù
To respond to what he tweeted before blocking me, I want to put it out there that there‚Äôs no rule at all saying Biden can‚Äôt give the VP more power than what‚Äôs historically typical...   Biden could pretty much have her do anything he wants.
Biden's list, at the least, suggests that he wants to defuse any tensions around his relationship with Harris.
or Biden, for that matter
You can vote for loopy Biden, Or Trump, who is a dick.  But wouldn‚Äôt it be more fun, To vote for Crazy Rick? While those poopfaces in DC Are busy misspending our loot, You should support the OWL Party, Because ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt give a hoot!‚Äù  #Election2020

Warren Democrats are literally the most loyal of any former candidate‚Äôs supporters in regards to voting for our nominee. Even more loyal than Biden primary voters.  The stats don‚Äôt lie.
Yeah... that was then. Look what he‚Äôs up to now.  He‚Äôs not my first choice. Not by a long shot.  Normally I‚Äôd vote 3rd party on something like this.  But fuck trump and his anti American brand of wannabe fascism.  So Biden gets my vote.
Build Back Better is the Joe Biden of slogans.  *heavy sigh*  Whatever. Take my vote. But I swear to god if you pick a shit VP I‚Äôm going to complain... a lot.  #Election2020 #TrumpVirus #JoeBiden
What will I do if Elizabeth Warren isn't chosen VP? Same as I would if she is: volunteer for down ballot progressives and vote for Joe Biden. #TheFutureIsProgressive #Biden2020

Have you looked at Biden‚Äôs platform and voting history? Even us socialist don‚Äôt like him. But he listens to science and takes it seriously so he has my vote. Trump is a dumpster fire.
I‚Äôll vote for this senile old white guy a thousand times before I vote for trump once. At least Biden knows how to wear a mask.
This is such a mean spirited tweet. If she is his pick, I fully support her and she will need the support of all of Biden‚Äôs supporters. Why do this?
Biden Says One Thing But Then What He Ends Up Doing Will Be Serving Himself No One Else But
I don't think Republicans will be embarrassed I think anybody who votes for a little namby-pamby person like Biden deserves their head to be examined
If Biden wins you will find out what happens to this country then you will scratch your head because you made a foolish decision#AmericaFirst
Yang‚Äôs definitely getting a job in the Biden Administration. Joe and his team know that having onboard Yang makes Joe look smarter, and that most voters wouldn‚Äôt trust Joe to fix a computer. Yang can cover a lot of Joe‚Äôs weaknesses, so Dems will use Yang, and Yang will use them.
I‚Äôm voting for Biden. Who cares what lies Barr tells. üíôüíô all the way down the whole ballot üíôüíôüíô
Biden: there is no place for violence and also there is no place for destruction of property.
Joe Biden‚Äôs domestic policy description: this is America, man, hold your head up high.  Real concrete Joe. Real concrete.
This image was taken by me, on Feb. 17th. This is the kind of footage and energy the mainstream media has suppressed since 2016. Joe Biden wouldn‚Äôt fill 500 seats here. The People For Bernie Sanders.
Tell that to the numbers of black women running their own businesses. Google the info &amp; learn the truth.  Biden is preaching on something he obviously knows nothing about. Pandering as usual.
Biden has my vote no matter what at this point. Trump is a threat to liberal democracy on par with Viktor Orb√°n or the Law and Justice Party, albeit less competent.
Sam, I am going either full retard or just completely Biden but who is Patrick Howley?
Almost every sentence Trump utters is gaffe-filled, grammatically incoherent. But if Biden has a verbal misstep, the media goes ape sh**. Double standards.
.....he also said Trump can't just do everything by Executive Order. Obama signed 276 EOs &amp; 1186 Presidential proclamations.  I guess   Biden didn't know how Obama worked. What else doesn't he know.?
Biden actually said it was irresponsible Govt. leadership that sent Corporations overseas but  should be here in America. He &amp;  Obama placed such regs on Corps they did just that. It took Pres.  Trump to bring businesses back to build factories Obama said never would.
I don't think it will be Biden but who replaces him, that's the one we got to watch for, his running mate.
Real talk my mom had dementia it was sad to watch her go through that....I‚Äôm telling you from what I see joe Biden has the same thing and it‚Äôs sad to see the Dems put him through this,they will stop at nothing to have power.
Wouldn‚Äôt it be nice if the press was as nice to trump as they are with joe dementia Biden?
Why isn‚Äôt Biden‚Äôs speech being broadcast on all stations? I saw it on Fox News of all places.
These Joe Biden questions are the softest questions I‚Äôve ever heard. Are you serious? These are the questions they‚Äôre asking him?
Joe Biden said one thing about Trump that backfired in the most damaging way - Patriot Pulse
Thank you Ed at least you saw the light in 2016 please continue to support and vote for Biden and please tell your friends and family to do the same thing.
Biden's act as president should be gloriously firing Bill Barr on Jan 20th.
Question:  Will the DOJ release the Durham report and indictments after the DNC convention officially makes Biden their presidential candidate?
you are a fool you are DT‚Äôs boy you have thrown away your reputation. When Biden wins I hope you go to jail.
I don‚Äôt understand how people think that if Biden is elected it all goes away. The Covid power grab by governors, the extreme demands by the progressives - it will still be here after the election regardless of who wins.
The problem is that democrats will NOT let ppl go back to work or open their businesses. Democrats R also lying about the virus numbers increasing. Dems R allowing rioters to run their city‚Äôs in violence. Dems R doing this to hide Biden so ppl won‚Äôt see Biden. Dems R lawlessness.
I just don‚Äôt believe people when they say the reason they‚Äôre not voting for Biden is because of his sexual assault allegations. It wasn‚Äôt a deal-breaker for you with Trump, but suddenly that‚Äôs your big hang up with Biden? Just say you‚Äôre a Trump supporter and go.
Can you quote that statement Biden made about giving "citizenship to any &amp; all"? or is this your conjecture?  "99% can't even help their own neighbors": Can you be more specific? And how did you arrive at the "99%" figure?  /1
Keep laughing troll. Just makes you look even more ignorant.
The centrists are no better than the conservatives. Wake up.
I see his digital crap all over but no bumper stickers or yard signs.  In fact I've seen more Hillary and Obummer bumper stickere than any Biden stickers.   Some people just never let go.
Well Joe Biden did say that if you don't vote for him, you ain't black.
BLM is also a fund for the Democrats. Their Chairty ActBlue donates all the money they get to Democratic Candiates like Joe Biden, they dont even go to minority communites and they are also silent on the real things hurting black families like welfare or no school choice.
Your friendly reminder that  doesn‚Äôt actually want to be Governor. He ran for President wasting our tax dollars, and every day he tweets about national political news desperate to get on MSNBC or CNN to promote Biden and bolster his resume.
All U have is your opinion. Not one vote has been cast for next Prez. While Biden may have stronger support among Black voters than 45, he doesn't have our vote yet.  It seems the only worry is from those who believe our vote's guaranteed or take issue w/ Harris because reasons.
You seriously think the party that nominated Joe Biden's McCain and Thurmund-eulogizing ass is "marxist communist?"  Get a grip.

Are we done with these people yet? Because we should be. Shameful is 100% the correct word for this. If you can't see the evil in prioritizing profits over human lives and then saying but Biden is better than Trump, I just CAN'T with you.
They had to cheat to get Biden where he is, if they didn‚Äôt cheat and the virus didn‚Äôt happen it would be  vs  , based on everything that has happened so far I hope Trump wins
These+many other states U lied to will vote BIDEN or U wouldn't have mentioned it! Yur a predictable LIAR!!
‚ÄúNothing will fundamentally change.‚Äù - Joe Biden.
I hope he doesn‚Äôt have enough power on his own to do so then.  Personally i think there are those on Biden‚Äôs team who understand the importance of building bridges with progressive voters, so I hope he‚Äôll listen to those voices and that will lead him to choosing Warren.
I‚Äôd prefer Warren or Bass but at the end of the day Biden will be the one deciding so we should really stop saying ‚Äúit can‚Äôt be x.‚Äù They‚Äôre all under consideration.
No I will never understand and I will never claim to understand. But I also won‚Äôt shame people that try to understand. However, with this particular situation, I‚Äôm not saying I love Biden and want Biden, I‚Äôm saying I don‚Äôt want trump and I just see a 2016 round 2
Given that Biden is no spring chicken, having a VP who can immediately step in if needed should be the goal.
Biden done hired half her campaign staff and adopted half her platform. So she should be half the ticket.  #WarrenForVP  #BidenWarren2020 #TheFutureIsProgressive
I wish all the people telling us it can‚Äôt be Warren for VP would stop prefacing it with ‚ÄúI love her BUT...‚Äù That shit is so annoying.  If you really loved her you wouldn‚Äôt be acting like you know better than Joe Biden‚Äôs vetting team and trying to shoot her down.
that‚Äôs exactly what trump does. he doesn‚Äôt care about POC either sis go do YOUR own research of racist things he has said and done. like i said i don‚Äôt like biden either, but i absolutely do NOT want trump in office
that‚Äôs your only argument... where did i say i like hillary or obama??? i don‚Äôt even like biden but id rather have him in office than the person we have now
Tbf I don‚Äôt endorse Biden either. I‚Äôll definitely be voting for him though. Essentially, that‚Äôs all this says ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
I'm right there with you on this. I think Biden's has already picked most of his cabinet at this point.
Sanders and Warren have moved Biden to the left.  He‚Äôs listening.
It's Operation Just Let Him Talk. It's Biden's best strategy.
Noam Chomsky is also a Biden Democrat
Except Joe Biden... Alien's could find enough to work with.
So is Bernie lol
Yes! Vote Joe Biden!
I bet that 90% or more of people calling Biden and Liberals "fascists" can't even define what it means.
F that. I‚Äôm going to hang my head and pull the lever for him, sure, because what other choice do I have. But I‚Äôm not filling my timeline with centrists platitudes that distract from actual progress. ‚ÄúNothing will fundamentally change‚Äù is the only Biden quote I need.
Seriously.. Ex woke me with a pistol to my head each morning... Feels like Trump Biden makes me happy again...think it happy, been a while   Sorry in my head Had to sing/play it. Sorry
Unless Biden grabs pussy on network news.... Not even a close call. He is huggy, have a buddy like that. Tries to put his arm on my shoulder "Dude, I felt every muscle flex!" Sorry! Whole "touch" thing is new to me... usually ends up in a chock hold!
Wow. Ethics.
Americans love performance over substance, &amp; Trump is living proof. It seems we're akin to lemmings who mindlessly jump off cliffs. If so, let's not replace Trump with old senile, pussygrabbing Biden, who is little more than a mental image of Trump &amp; a practical joke of the DNC.
Fox might be playing the long game. It‚Äôs ratings probably will be even better under a Biden presidency.
1 allegation that was not debunked vs 20 allegations that were. Women accusing Trump were found out that they were paid to accuse, but not the one against Biden, she is still pushing her stance. And if you're accuser was debunked as being paid you don't need to give DNA
Tom please. Obama, Biden, Hillary, Bill, Nadler, Padestra, Soros, the whole bunch all new because it was their plan.
I guess you forgot Biden not only grabbed a woman's p*ssy but inserted his finger in it as well. Wonder if he smelt it and did it smell like a little girls hair?
Thank you for the boost!
The kicker is I‚Äôm not the only young person who feels that way!   (Young voters overwhelmingly support Warren for VP)
Rest ever so peacefully you dear sweet man.
Read this.
Biden was with Obama administration. If he weren‚Äôt deceased, I am sure he would have know this.
I wish Elon would shut up and (make electric cars) but certainly Biden doesn‚Äôt represent the vocal segments of ‚Äúthe left.‚Äù
Joe Biden got to be kidding!  Where you been Joe?  President Trump got that covered in his almost 4years Presidency and continuing!  Four more years for President is what this country need!
Glad you will be making it look nice for the Biden's when they move in.. Thanks birther
Oh I'm waiting for that reply. Unreal how having a D after you name makes you a saint. Here is an article from FIVE YEARS ago, talking about gropy Joe. He will never stop and they want him to be the most powerful man on Earth. "Shudders."
Forget that Biden does it too? Or does the D after his name give him a pass?
So you have no issues with Biden groping little girls, groping women, lying about his history and claiming he'll veto M4A in a pandemic? What's the draw?
She sees the current polling and want's to prepare it for the Biden's. She ordered the DR Premier Field and Brush mower and she's going to get busy.
Do you know why we wait till January 20th for the presidency to terminate?   That's a lot of time for him to sabotage Biden before he even gets in office.
No sexual predator is a breath of fresh air. Look into the eyes of these little girls then sing Biden's praises.
1/ Speaking of women, the idea of Susan Rice moving into contention for V.P. is a good one. Hear me out, 1. she and Biden worked together in the white house, 2. she is smart as hell on many things but foreign policy is a plus and other countries like her. 2/

I've stayed relatively quiet about the election since Andrew Yang dropped out, but let me say as decisively as I can, I am supporting Joe Biden. I'll also be voting for Democrats in all down ballot races. No exceptions. Enough is enough. #Biden2020 #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica
This is why he needs to be destroyed. This is why Biden team needs to think bigger than just winning MI, WI, PA.

Joe Biden hasn‚Äôt said or done anything of significance since April 8.   That should answer your question.  Also he wants to bring Larry Summers back.  That should also answer your question.

Tell that to your nominee for president, Joe Biden ...  ‚ÄúIf you have a problem figuring out whether you‚Äôre for me or Trump, then you ain‚Äôt black.‚Äù Continuing the history of Democrat Party racism.
Yep....‚ÄùIf you have a problem figuring out whether you‚Äôre for me or Trump, then you ain‚Äôt black.‚Äù  Racist Joe Biden speaks his (feeble) mind.  From decades of racist policies the Democratic Party tries to ignore this.
There is absolutely worse possible candidates than Trump. They're not up this year, but probably 2024, and they'll use every bullshit thing Biden &amp; Harris do against them.  Trump will look like a damn picnic. And Dems will probably rehabilitate him like they did Bush. üòí
The Biden fog is lifting. The Democrats are proposing to run Obama as vice president. Even though Obama is not Constitutionally eligible for a third term, he could still end up as VP because of the five traitors on the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court
Tammy you are right, Biden just sits in his basement and has a staff to send these ridiculous tweets out ! We are being lead by  because he is a born leader! Unlike  who hides in his basement!  #trumplovesamericans #trump2020
No, not pathetic.  Biden is winning in the polls!
Funny... but ultimately flawed. Trump had his chance. He failed. We need a change. Plain and simple. If Biden is that guy, ok, We will give him a chance too. If he fucks up, we will vote his ass out too.
Biden needs to disavow the destruction of property which in many cases are small businesses owned by black &amp; brown people of color... The BLM message has been hijacked by anarchists.... stupid
Honestly it doesn‚Äôt matter. The world is laughing at us. The pandemic alone is why we need a change.  Trump had his shot and he blew it.  Let‚Äôs give Biden a shot. If he fucks it up too, we will hang his ass out to dry as well.
This sort of message is antidemocratic because it suggests that the only people worth voting for are the ones presented by the dual-party dictatorship. I'm proudly voting for  because he represents my ideals and beliefs. I refuse to vote for Biden just b/c he's not Trump

You forget Biden was accused of rape by one woman and accused of sexual perversions by 9 others? That's OK because he has a D after his name, right?

It's becoming clear as Trump destabilizes the nation with militarized goons to silence an uprising that this is one step closer to fascism going into this 2020 election. He is already painting Biden as someone who will destroy the police force.

You know the story...even if Joe Biden wins in November, very little can change if the Republicans still control¬†the US Senate.   There are two key toss-up Senate races out West: Montana and Colorado. If you have the means, please consider adopting these races as your own. 1/3
You hit the nail on the head Biden talks a lot but he says a lot nothing  If Biden becomes President he'll say a lot but do nothing. The do nothing President Thanks for your service Sir.

Joe Biden says Trump's divisiveness is 'the last thing we need' ‚Äì live
Please do vote for Joe Biden, he‚Äôs not the best but he‚Äôs certainly better than Proto Fascist Trump, who literally runs concentration camps on the border. Just take a look, he‚Äôs not as bad as you think. He‚Äôs much more left than Clinton.
VP Biden is Exactly what Americans need to begin the process of healing, repair damages done by Trump and allow Science to get us through COVID. The World needs him to mend the fences Trump blew over and stomped on. He's the Perfect Transition President for Country and the World!

Who I would've supported in every primary: (subject to change) 2020: Sanders/Biden 2016: Sanders 2012: Obama 2008: Obama/Clinton? 2004: Dean 2000: Gore 1996: Clinton 1992: Brown 1988: Jackson 1984: Jackson 1980: Carter 1976: Carter 1972: McGovern 1968: RFK 1964: LBJ 1960: JFK
Absolutely under no circumstances should ANYONE write in for Kanye....but "beat BIDEN/ off of WRITE INS/" is kind of a bar tho.

Sir It looks like Obama and the Clinton's are trying to run American through do nothing Biden This is scary. God help us. Only a vote for Trump for President can save American now. Thanks for your service Sir.

From here, it's Warren, who happens to be on a call with Biden right now. No one knows policy AND inspires like Elizabeth Warren.
Old white men afraid of an ambitious woman are afraid she's better than they are, and that's not acceptable. She, or any woman, needs to stick to her guns and move forward no matter what. Biden should pick Kamala for that very reason. It'll show he's not afraid of her ambition.
I wish there was a gif of Biden calling that one guy Fat. And not as a descriptor but by name ‚ÄúListen here, Fat.‚Äù

The Trump kids are the best campaign ad for Biden ...  I love it.
Ultimately, Biden's election will be verified and he will take office.  The issue is that by inflaming trumpazoids, Donnie may incite guerilla violence vs. the government and random liberals (anyone with a Biden sticker on their car for starters).  It's a real &amp; scary possibility
Please VOTE.  If you are a US citizen, please register to vote.  Please vote.  We need not just a victory, but a huge landslide victory for Biden to get fascist Trump &amp; his enablers out of office.  Country over party.
There really is no rush. Let Trump fret about whether they will need to replace Pence due to Biden‚Äôs ultimate choice
I did the same thing 2 weeks ago, the pollster told me she was just reading the questions so I answered all for Biden just to screw with them

Trump administration is so afraid of Biden, a real politician.
Jobs don‚Äôt mean a thing if you are sick or dying. Biden‚Äôs first job as president will be to protect Americans, a duty Trump has failed at spectacularly. Then Biden will stabilize our roller-coaster economy.
I love the whole "well, at least I'm not this guy" thing Biden has going on. Honestly, Trump is so silly but at least his ego and narcissism keep us informed on his dealings via Twitter. So Biden will be just as corrupt but hide it from us. üòÇ
I like Biden! I think it‚Äôs great the challenges he has overcome to make it to be the nominee.
Tell the truth now üòÅ  Who is in charge of that couch ü§îüòâ
This is classic Republican. Our country is a mess and the answer to that is: Biden Sucks! You got nothing. Your party is irrelevant.
We Americans have never lived in fear like this. Its time that we stop. So Mr Biden, that is my challenge to you, to be the greatest uS President  ever. Restore us, put us back on the right course. You will have tons to do, but you will have tons of good American grit behind you.

Establishment dems are trying their hardest to co-opt that movement, but the far left know better. Nobody is claiming they're stupid, they just start from the wrong premise. Biden would appease, but they'd see through it.

Oh it‚Äôs definitely happening.  If he leaves, he won‚Äôt acknowledge Biden or go to the inauguration ceremony, at best he quietly sneaks out and leaves the inside trashed.

I voted for  I really didn‚Äôt care much who he wld choose as his running mate till now. But the leaks abt Biden‚Äôs allies blocking Kamala pissed me off! Kamala is ambitious? It‚Äôs Great! Just like Hillary is overprepared! Now I want to see Kamala as Biden‚Äôs VP! Joe?
No - on the Biden Vote, I am a Republican cause I like my rights not a Democrat who want to keep my rights for himself.  The lesser of two evils, Eh?  Then don't vote Biden, he will be competent enough to accept the responsibility needed to assure this nation a bright future  ...
YES! VOTE FOR BIDEN! VOTE FOR AMERICA! VOTE FOR INTELLIGENCE! VOTE FOR INTEGRITY! VOTE FOR A POTUS THAT YOU CAN BEAR TO LOOK AT AND LISTEN TO WITHOUT WANTING TO VOMIT!
No matter who  picks for VP I will support his decision. I know Joe Biden and I completely trust his decision.
Imagine supporting BLM and then voting for Biden...learn history and his role in pushing a crime bill that caused the mass incarceration of blacks. I wonder if his VP pick will be Kamala Harris? Won't that be great? hahahaha
Is this the Biden outreach to Asian Americans?
And he got tens of millions of people healthcare. Worst case scenario Biden expands Obamacare and gets millions more healthcare. I care more about those millions of people more than I care about my cool Secular Talk vacant leftism aesthetic

That shit is an example of justice. It is not always about the refund you receive, it is about the lump fund Wells Fargo had to pay. Class Action lawsuits are an effective form of consumer protection.
Biden isn't just Biden.  He's whoever replaces Stephen Miller, or Betsy DeVos, or Barr. It's about getting an administration that can reverse some of the damage that's been done, not to shift far left in an instant.
Unflinching?  No.  Pragmatic.  I don't actually like Biden.  He was dead last in a raft of much better options.  But that's who I've got, him or Trump?  Yeah, Biden's better than Trump.  He's not amazing, but he's better.  And right now, all we get is better.
And no, 4 more years of Trump isn't going to change the DNC.  It's not going to punish them, or make them change, or fuck, make VOTERS change, because they picked Biden.  The people picked Biden.    I don't agree with the people, but he's what we've got vs fascism.
At this point, I don't actually give a shit about universal health care.  What we deserve, first, is to clean up the mess he's made since he got into the presidential office.  And the best bet is Biden because he's the only bet.  There's no one else.

This is the dumbest thing I've read in awhile and that includes the shit some staffer is writing for Biden
'[Biden] understands that rather than a revolution, many if not most voters want stability, functional government and a normal president. üíØ '‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt about law and order,‚Äù he said of Trump‚Äôs deployment of federal agents. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs about a strategy to revive a failing campaign.‚Äù'
Biden voices the right amount of disgust and anger at Trump for not pressing Putin on bounties for U.S. troops in Afghanistan, for dividing the country on race, for creating scenes of violence for campaign ads and for botching the coronavirus response.
Part of the far right fascist trump campaign to instill suspicion in the population towards china so when he pulls the I am stronger than Biden to protect you from China bit there will be enough dumbshits in America to be manipulated to vote for him. Or worse he starts a war.
OMG. Listen to trump ramble. He is disintegrating before the nation and world. Trump MUST be voted out...in a landslide. Please, everyone, vote Biden and dems up &amp; down your ballots.
Vote for Biden!
Vote for Biden. He will restore our democracy. Our institutions, and strive to instill governing in the house and it should be, not as it has been trashed and procedures ignored by the radical right fascist party that has revealed themselves. This election concerns the world!
Idk who needs to hear this but: joe biden doesn‚Äôt care about you and he will not change a single thing about this country
Untrue. Fear Politics as usual from you. You have pulled this nation so far right that you have turned your followers into eager Fascist followers thinking they are the opposite, quite the twist there. Biden actually sits Republican right on the political spectrum.
The average voter isn‚Äôt that analytical. A centrist failed against Trump in 2016, and the dem base‚Äôs direct response was to vote for a centrist in 2020 specifically BECAUSE he is the most electable. In the event that Biden loses, prepare for 4 years of
Haha Biden memory bad and I think that‚Äôs more important than tens of millions of people‚Äôs health insurance
If you're voting for Biden that makes you one of those people.
trump. Misuse of patriot act. The first of many steps of fascism. Vote Biden. Then once that is done it will be a political fight against the corrupt corporate elite. The fascist republican party and the democrat war party. We must form an American Unity Party under Constitution.

For real! If you're going to vote for Biden, then do it. It's your vote. But why make it so damn clear you expect nothing from him?  These are the people who can't figure out why American politics keep moving to the right, election after election.
Dunno who needs to hear this but here it is.  Biden's platform isn't to consolidate his base. It's to appease his donors and to be palatable to republicans.  And I hope you understand how fucking stupid that it is.
She's tough as nails. Sen. Duckworth would overshadow the candidate with her raw inner power, and that might be a problem for the Biden Campaign.
Jules, it's down to personal attacks by Trump. There is nothing else but bold faced lies and attempts to besmirch Biden's name by Trump's re-election effort. He can't compete with Joe's record and ideas.

Biden is currently a massive favorite, so this is a pretty bad strategic move on your part. If we don‚Äôt vote for him and he wins anyway, it‚Äôll send the message that they can win without us.

Unless there‚Äôs some evidence that those drone strikes could have been avoided if I, Thomas voted for Howie Hawkins or Trump instead of Biden, no.   Are you going to acknowledge that there‚Äôs a massive difference between 30 million uninsured and 10 million?
Why isn't Julia Louis-Dreyfus on Biden's short list?
You are continuing to refuse to acknowledge the policy differences between Trump and Biden.   30 million people got insurance under Obamacare. Why don‚Äôt you care about those people at all? That ain‚Äôt very leftist of you brotha.
The difference between Biden and Trump on LGBTQ issues, abortion, healthcare, and taxes is pretty fucking substantive. You just don‚Äôt like to hear that because you‚Äôre obsessed with essentialism.
It‚Äôs truly unbelievable that the people who claimed to care about policy and nothing else this whole time are now refusing to acknowledge the clear policy differences between Biden and Trump, to make themselves feel good about not voting for a bad person. You are unhinged.
Bingo. All the more reason for Biden to take his time.
There are 2 possible results come November: Joe Biden becomes president, or Donald Trump remains president. You can either vote for the lesser of two evils, or continue to virtue signal on Twitter while everyone but straight cis men are stripped of their rights.

I have a bad feeling that even if Biden gets elected, there will still be significant pushback on ANY mitigation policy from republican politicians. Like right down to the local level. I don't understand why act this way, it's almost like they don't want it to go away.
That would be great and just in time for a competent Biden team to take over the administering of a vaccine to Americans.
And even if it is developed, people certainly would trust a Biden team to handle it more than the inept, corrupt Trump fumblers.

Translation: Fuck Biden... Keep Trump. Fuck the USA.
#TrumpsAmerica  What an idiot to show images of his failed leadership and gestapo state and try to say that is how Biden's America would look. He forgets that we observed Biden's leadership as VP for 8 years. None of it looked like today which is a Trump-induced shit show
Calling it now. In 10 years, centrist Dems will lovingly embrace Trump as he calls out the then Republican nut case. Not without good reason, of course. Maybe Donald will slip Jill Biden a cough drop or paint some pictures.
Like don't pick someone old *because* they won't run in 8 years (see: Biden).  VP picks don't move the needle much on current races, but dramatically shape future races.

My prediction, pin it.  Nov 3rd Trump loses countable popular vote 55% - 42%. Election called by networks for Buden.  Trump then says he needs mail in votes counted. Within a week, it is clear outcome for Biden.  Trump then claims mail in votes rigged against him.  Jan 20, Biden
They aren‚Äôt dug in the way that that guy described it, though. As evidenced by the Lincoln Project and similar organizations, a lot of Republicans will be voting for Biden to oust Trump.  If they weren‚Äôt, Trump wouldn‚Äôt be getting slaughtered in the polls.

Even Biden, who can't lead his way out of a paper bag, would have known how to let responsible people craft a response and then read the right words on the teleprompter.  I say it again: Trump is uniquely awful. All he had to do was not actively work to sabotage our response.

I am positive I would trust Kamala Harris if she had to move into the Presidency because of Biden illness, he is 78....
I suspect bullcrap.  Nobody has put forth the names of these so called "biden donors.
Ridiculous, I suspect Biden's white hairs to be at the head of this, the rich bastards who would "let Biden" be President but want to pick his VP.
If you think Biden is going to choose his VP, and therefore the future President, I have some three day old fish to sell you.
I would like to know the names of these "biden money donors" who are leaning on him heavily not to pick her.  Do they have another agenda?

Wow. Republicans REALLY don‚Äôt want Kamala Harris as Biden‚Äôs VP. They‚Äôre flooding Twitter with negative shit. Must mean they‚Äôre scared of her.
Yeah, I was generally curious.  I am hoping it‚Äôs Harris because I think she is a strong candidate and could be a good leader overall.  Assuming Biden can win, realistically he‚Äôs not going to serve 8 years.  Harris seems to have more experience than some others on the short list.
Not sure how many nightmares you‚Äôre having, but a Biden election will end some of mine.
Biden/Harris has always been my first pick.  She would absolutely be ready day one.

My guess, either one printing plant has printed four or five different Biden/VeepName banners, or four or five different plants have separate orders.
YES! That‚Äôs what I‚Äôve been saying for a while now. We as progressives truly need to stop going with the media‚Äôs biased &amp; nonsensical framing of any progressive (Bernie &amp; AOC) being a ‚Äúradical‚Äù &amp; any corporatist (Biden &amp; Klobuchar) being a ‚Äúmoderate‚Äù. No, WE‚ÄôRE the moderates.
No. We have the responsibility to do what's right.  Ends do not justify the means.  Trump may come for 4 years or may be Biden. But the goal is to teach DNC and GOP a lesson.   You just have different goals.
Yep.  He sure as hell wasn‚Äôt having any Aferican American man asking him a ‚Äúyes or no‚Äù question.  His response was a practiced lie.  Stop blaming Obama and Biden for your FUBAR non-leadership.  You own it.

I‚Äôll laugh so hard if Biden wins Texas.  If Biden can win Florida is almost impossible for Trump to win re-election.  If Biden wins Texas there‚Äôs zero chance.  Texas has slowly been becoming more progressive.  If it doesn‚Äôt happen this year, hopefully in 8-12 years it will.

It‚Äôs totally &amp; utterly irrelevant to care about Biden‚Äôs VP because the fact of the matter is NOTHING we truly care about as progressives will actually be accomplished under Biden during his 4 yrs in office, REGARDLESS of who his VP pick actually is.
That‚Äôs exactly right Ana! Who gives a f**k about who Biden‚Äôs VP given that Nina Turner &amp; Barbara Lee are NOT in consideration. Warren is malleable, Kamala is a flip-flopper, &amp; the others are just very standard politicians that stand for NOTHING!

What is Biden doing August 15th?
Your reply makes no sense.  Biden is not a liberal.  Biden is willing to work with liberals because he understands that there are 331 million people in the country, and a good leader must listen to all voices and act on behalf of all the people, not just his loyal followers.
You &amp; your loyalists lie &amp; mislead about Biden because the truth is not in your favor.  I think you missed the part where Biden left the basement and earned our enthusiasm by demonstrating what a strong POTUS he will be.  I am extremely enthusiastic and proud to vote for Biden!
Many people think we‚Äôre just voting against Trump. They‚Äôre wrong.   Over the past months, Biden has demonstrated that he will be a great leader. I believe in &amp; trust Biden.  MAGATs think he‚Äôs been hiding in the basement. He most certainly has not. I will be proud to vote for Joe!
It‚Äôs Biden‚Äôs party who is doing this and he has not denounced it. No liberal leader has denounced this shit... so it stands to reason that he will allow this to keep happening if he gets elected. Locals have to vote liberal mayors/governors out too to make it better
Only if Joe doesn‚Äôt go off the deep end.  We have an election to win... or lose.  Don‚Äôt get greedy.  49% of white voters voted for 45 in 2016.  And they do it again if Joe Biden makes the wrong choice.  It‚Äôs sad that prejudice still drives elections, but it‚Äôs a fact.
We‚Äôve become somewhat numb to Trump‚Äôs ridiculousness because it is so common.   This contrast of Trump with a real President is a reminder of what we‚Äôre missing.  Vote for Biden!
In 100 days we get to vote decency, integrity and respect back in to the White House. Quinnipiac shows Biden leading in double digits. ‚ÄòBig enough to drag down all  on the ballot in November creating a hole that it could take years to dig out of.‚Äô

Why Electing Joe Biden Will Make The Culture War Even Worse
*narrator voice* Biden has never touched an electronic device, let alone has any idea what they are.
Really? Biden is the moral bastion you want to hold up as an example?
He sees the internal polling. Repubs, as well as himself are going to get routed. So, he is going to do everything he can to try and contest the election. Do not be surprised if Biden wins be 5-10% and then Trump sues and tries to use the 12th amendment to overturn the election.
And who do you think is hiding in the Trogen horse? That‚Äôs the scary thought. What if Biden choses Pelosi for his vice. That would be a painful  out come üòÇüòÇüòÇ

Biden was polling at 5.4% before the IA caucus, and then dropped out after placing fifth, behind Clinton, Obama, Edwards, and Bill Richardson.
That's not historically how it has worked though, and setting up new rules for a certain candidate to fail at is biased. Joe Biden himself was selected for the VP after withdrawing after the IA caucus in 2008. Probably polling poorly, which is why he didn't want to go on to NH.

Yeah BIDEN... Lord help this one.. #TrumpIsACompleteFailure #BidenPledgesAllegianceToUS not RUSSIA!  #DesperationSucks
He has no power and it's a democracy. If there was a better option than Clinton and biden then he wouldn't win.
I won't vote for Biden if Harris is on the ticket with him.
And that bill didn't fuel systematic racism?  Not voting for Joe Biden did you think I was?
You are mistaken, this country is a better place to live because of President Trump! Unless you are desiring a communist country! Socialism is exactly what Joe Biden‚Äôs puppet masters (AOC, Bernie Sanders, Pelosi, etc) want. Joe is incapable of resisting anyone in his condition
Yeah Biden... üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ good one.. #BidenPledgesAllegianceToUS not RUSSIA
I don't get why Biden's wife is allowing him to do this. Clearly he has dementia. Dems are up to something and maybe she's going along because of their hatred for Trump.
President Biden....tear down this wall!
Don't trust the polls. Between people lying and voter suppression we need to focus on getting people to the ballot box (physical or mail) and #VoteBlue. Go in thinking that #Biden is down by 10. #MotivateTheBase
Yeah Biden..... lmao #delusional af #BidenPledgesAllegianceToUS not Russia
Biden - 'You can vote for Trump he's got...that thing...what do you call it...where you can't remember stuff?'  Trump - 'He means Dementors'
Tammy you are right, Biden just sits in his basement and has a staff to send these ridiculous tweets out ! We are being lead by  because he is a born leader! Unlike  who hides in his basement!  #trumplovesamericans #trump2020
Trump - "The Dems are communists who what to eat your children"  Pelosi - "I know you are, but what am I?"   Biden - "Bazinga...you know from that sciencey show 'The Large Noise Idea' , right...kids...I'm relatable and stuff"

Biden is not in charge now, Trump is. This is Trump‚Äôs America!

The house impeached Trump for investigating Biden‚Äôs corruption but does nothing to investigate Biden‚Äôs wrongful acts against the President while Biden was in office.  Congress should have more integrity.
Joe Biden will reform the police. Not defund them.  Spread the word.
Wait he wants to beat off Biden?
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
What I hate is Christiane Annampour's smarmy framing of entitlement of the lukewarm DNC-anointed candidate to the votes of Bernie supporters.  If Biden wants Bernie supporter votes, he can support progressive policies and apologize for his racist legacy and sexual harassment.
Yes. Biden should take the cognitive test.
God damn, I miss him as our leader.  Let's hope Michelle takes up the mantle when Biden is done..

Well, actually she could run against Biden or his replacement if he is 1 term. With the way voting is going I think we‚Äôre about to see new precedents set. We‚Äôre at points where Millennials and Gen Z will make up majority of voters.
I can‚Äôt for the life of me understand why every time something happens that Trump doesn‚Äôt like he calls it ‚ÄúBiden‚Äôs America‚Äù like does he not realize he‚Äôs still the president
Trump will run this picture in ads that say, "In a Joe Biden America, the suburbs will be outlawed."  And consumers of Fox News will eat their Goya and nod their heads.
It is as bad as having options of Trump and Biden.
Please make Obama and Biden and Clintons accountable for one of the biggest political crimes against Trump and against the homeowners of America.  American homes are being stolen transferring the wealth of Americans to the elite and Trump should never have had to endure this.
Joe Biden, I will consider voting for you if you promise to send these DHS goons to every golf course Trump uses.
Biden is better in every single measurable way!! Duh!!
Vote for a different president the next election.  I am pretty sure Mitchy boy will try his best to block everything Biden will try to do just be ause he is an asshat.

Swine flu never reached this level?  Why did DJ refuse to even admit we had a problem until yesterday?  Trump cannot even address his goals for a 2nd term.  When DJ can do that without ripping on someone else and focus on what he will do there is nothing for Biden to say.
Love to hear how President Biden would handle Russia placing bounties on US troops. We haven‚Äôt heard the current President say anything.
Tyrant Jay Inslee just issued more edicts.  I hope all of us conservatives realize what this is all about. They want to make us tired of it so we just vote for Biden and then everything goes back to normal. We do not want that shit.  I will be helping to register more Trump folks

Biden is not in support of defunding police.  That said we do need to look at the roles and scope of what we are asking law enforcement to serve.
It is too late for Joe Biden or any other president to restore America‚Äôs leadership in the Middle East #SmartNews
Actually, what‚Äôs hardest for me to believe is that the vast majority of people who say they will vote for Biden are doing so not because they believe in Biden, but because they are anti-Trump.  That‚Äôs cutting off your nose to spite your face!
I‚Äôve seen some odd tweets over the years but showing America under Trump and saying that Biden would also be like this doesn‚Äôt seem particularly well thought out.
If you vote for Biden what is happening now will continue to happen now but we can finally blame somebody for it.
Good luck with Biden.  He will be a puppet at best, while his handlers rape and pillage  the American people.  Ever notice all of the Trump Signs?  People are inhuman and destroy others property because of hatred for Trump.  Another 2020 Win AZ nd we'll witness the crying again.

As Biden's VP decision nears, keep three categories in mind  via
From here, it's Warren, who happens to be on a call with Biden right now. No one knows policy AND inspires like Elizabeth Warren.
Old white men afraid of an ambitious woman are afraid she's better than they are, and that's not acceptable. She, or any woman, needs to stick to her guns and move forward no matter what. Biden should pick Kamala for that very reason. It'll show he's not afraid of her ambition.

Ultimately, Biden's election will be verified and he will take office.  The issue is that by inflaming trumpazoids, Donnie may incite guerilla violence vs. the government and random liberals (anyone with a Biden sticker on their car for starters).  It's a real &amp; scary possibility
Please VOTE.  If you are a US citizen, please register to vote.  Please vote.  We need not just a victory, but a huge landslide victory for Biden to get fascist Trump &amp; his enablers out of office.  Country over party.
There really is no rush. Let Trump fret about whether they will need to replace Pence due to Biden‚Äôs ultimate choice

Trump administration is so afraid of Biden, a real politician.
Jobs don‚Äôt mean a thing if you are sick or dying. Biden‚Äôs first job as president will be to protect Americans, a duty Trump has failed at spectacularly. Then Biden will stabilize our roller-coaster economy.
I love the whole "well, at least I'm not this guy" thing Biden has going on. Honestly, Trump is so silly but at least his ego and narcissism keep us informed on his dealings via Twitter. So Biden will be just as corrupt but hide it from us. üòÇ

This is classic Republican. Our country is a mess and the answer to that is: Biden Sucks! You got nothing. Your party is irrelevant.
We Americans have never lived in fear like this. Its time that we stop. So Mr Biden, that is my challenge to you, to be the greatest uS President  ever. Restore us, put us back on the right course. You will have tons to do, but you will have tons of good American grit behind you.

Oh it‚Äôs definitely happening.  If he leaves, he won‚Äôt acknowledge Biden or go to the inauguration ceremony, at best he quietly sneaks out and leaves the inside trashed.

YES! VOTE FOR BIDEN! VOTE FOR AMERICA! VOTE FOR INTELLIGENCE! VOTE FOR INTEGRITY! VOTE FOR A POTUS THAT YOU CAN BEAR TO LOOK AT AND LISTEN TO WITHOUT WANTING TO VOMIT!
No matter who  picks for VP I will support his decision. I know Joe Biden and I completely trust his decision.
Imagine supporting BLM and then voting for Biden...learn history and his role in pushing a crime bill that caused the mass incarceration of blacks. I wonder if his VP pick will be Kamala Harris? Won't that be great? hahahaha
And he got tens of millions of people healthcare. Worst case scenario Biden expands Obamacare and gets millions more healthcare. I care more about those millions of people more than I care about my cool Secular Talk vacant leftism aesthetic

Why is Trump upgrading the West Wing for the arrival of Joe Biden?
I'm . . . not saying you do?  I don't owe the Democratic party jack shit.  I voted for Bernie in the primary.  I'm not happy that the voters backed Biden over Bernie or Warren or Beto or . . . fuck anyone but old-ass Biden.    I have zero party loyalty to the DNC.
That shit is an example of justice. It is not always about the refund you receive, it is about the lump fund Wells Fargo had to pay. Class Action lawsuits are an effective form of consumer protection.
Biden isn't just Biden.  He's whoever replaces Stephen Miller, or Betsy DeVos, or Barr. It's about getting an administration that can reverse some of the damage that's been done, not to shift far left in an instant.
Unflinching?  No.  Pragmatic.  I don't actually like Biden.  He was dead last in a raft of much better options.  But that's who I've got, him or Trump?  Yeah, Biden's better than Trump.  He's not amazing, but he's better.  And right now, all we get is better.
And no, 4 more years of Trump isn't going to change the DNC.  It's not going to punish them, or make them change, or fuck, make VOTERS change, because they picked Biden.  The people picked Biden.    I don't agree with the people, but he's what we've got vs fascism.
At this point, I don't actually give a shit about universal health care.  What we deserve, first, is to clean up the mess he's made since he got into the presidential office.  And the best bet is Biden because he's the only bet.  There's no one else.

Biden voices the right amount of disgust and anger at Trump for not pressing Putin on bounties for U.S. troops in Afghanistan, for dividing the country on race, for creating scenes of violence for campaign ads and for botching the coronavirus response.
Part of the far right fascist trump campaign to instill suspicion in the population towards china so when he pulls the I am stronger than Biden to protect you from China bit there will be enough dumbshits in America to be manipulated to vote for him. Or worse he starts a war.

Untrue. Fear Politics as usual from you. You have pulled this nation so far right that you have turned your followers into eager Fascist followers thinking they are the opposite, quite the twist there. Biden actually sits Republican right on the political spectrum.
The average voter isn‚Äôt that analytical. A centrist failed against Trump in 2016, and the dem base‚Äôs direct response was to vote for a centrist in 2020 specifically BECAUSE he is the most electable. In the event that Biden loses, prepare for 4 years of

Mayor Garcia so sorry for your lost.  May your warm and loving memories of your mother give you, family &amp; friends peace. It was good to know that Biden called.  I am glad that the family shared it.  Even better his campaign didn't, a very classy act of decency.
If you're voting for Biden that makes you one of those people.
trump. Misuse of patriot act. The first of many steps of fascism. Vote Biden. Then once that is done it will be a political fight against the corrupt corporate elite. The fascist republican party and the democrat war party. We must form an American Unity Party under Constitution.

She's tough as nails. Sen. Duckworth would overshadow the candidate with her raw inner power, and that might be a problem for the Biden Campaign.

You are continuing to refuse to acknowledge the policy differences between Trump and Biden.   30 million people got insurance under Obamacare. Why don‚Äôt you care about those people at all? That ain‚Äôt very leftist of you brotha.
The difference between Biden and Trump on LGBTQ issues, abortion, healthcare, and taxes is pretty fucking substantive. You just don‚Äôt like to hear that because you‚Äôre obsessed with essentialism.
It‚Äôs truly unbelievable that the people who claimed to care about policy and nothing else this whole time are now refusing to acknowledge the clear policy differences between Biden and Trump, to make themselves feel good about not voting for a bad person. You are unhinged.
Bingo. All the more reason for Biden to take his time.

Oh, I know. Biden's a pathological liar who pushed the Iraq War, who wrote the '94 crime bill, who attacked Anita Hill, who built a career out of being a racist, who sexually assaulted one woman and exposed himself to several others. But please remember that Trump is bad, too.

First high-profile Republican defection to Biden comes from swing-state Ohio
Yeah, it might actually come to that. Biden has said that the military may have to forcibly remove Trump if he's voted out in November.

Nooo the Democrats screwed my candidate over and now I have no choice but to ignore that the left would be way better off under a Biden presidency and a democratic supermajority than Trump and any republican control whatsoever nooo
Seems like this is a way to identify criminal activity when Biden unilaterally threatened to withhold a billion congressionally allocated to Ukraine if they didnt fire the prosecutor going after the company that employed Hunter Biden.
Being investigated by your political opponents isnt really that big of a deal. Biden on the other hand is being investigated by a foreign power.

perfect, but because it moved the needle. Legalized marijuana isn't happening with Republican legislatures and Governors, but it happened here in Washington with Democrats leading the policy. Democrats will be the ones to move the needle on all those issues. A vote for Biden and

Don't know that I agree with the Biden stuff, serious manner c'mon man, but the T dude? The bar was moved to the basement, standards became a suggestion to be considered but ignored. All in the name of media profit. Take away, qualifications unnecessary, proven acumen, unneeded!

Watch Biden's remarks on how he's mobilizing a 21st century care and early childhood education workforce to deal with the caregiving crisis in our nation.
As for me personally, I‚Äôve never been one to emphasize identity politics. Do I care that she‚Äôs a bIack woman? Not really. But, that piece of the puzzle is a big one for a lot of people. She checks a lot of boxes that Biden doesn‚Äôt
and my point is he's not taking anything from Biden on the level that brandon is saying stein took from clinton. it's just not going to happen. period. biden is not clinton!
that's not how write-in candidates work. if someone writes him in where he isn't eligible to run, then he doesn't get a vote tabulated to him. that means biden or trump do not get that vote. not specifically biden.Joe Biden‚Äôs VP should be Caitlyn Jenner.
It would make 2020 absolutely bearable is Texas our Biden Over 270... in the words of a great kid, Awwwwww Yeaaahhhhh!
Yep, and he was taken to task for it.
This aged well.
Biden did in the spring and was told he was delusional. Jokes on those other idiots
And Biden‚Äôs cognitive abilities have been challenged?  You were played by Trump this whole time. Check today‚Äôs tweet by the dimwit in charge.
It was never Biden... But the real candidate is soon to appear....!!!!!!
Won't know till everyone votes. Biden is definitely the lesser of 2 evils. But also definitely not a good choice.
No one runs for president without a healthy dose of ambition. Harris is a better VP candidate than Rice otherwise they wouldn't be scared of her. Fire Dodd and get your shit together Team
They're not expecting Biden to run the country. I think they're using him to fulfill some sort of alternative.
Trump saved this country.  The country was doing great till you stupid idiots jumped in.  How can people love Biden when he won't even show his face?  He makes no comments on what is going on.  You live in a fantasy world and you better wake up before it is too late.

Biden is lying about everything he is saying and answers. He has a list of people who he gets questions from and has a time limit. Please follow me back
Biden's plan: hide in the basement and watch out the window for little kids to fondle and sniff! #PedoJoe is the Pepe Le Pew of politics.
The right does a great job of positioning Biden as the boogie man. And old white people are scared of a world that doesn‚Äôt look like them...
Now, this is why they will not allow Biden to come out of his basement and speak like a real man.  He has told so many lies that he can no longer navigate through them.
Joe Biden is a baby molester, which is worse? The left seems to be ok with pedophile candidates!
What happens when you snowflakes realize Biden lost?  Trump 2020
Let's give Biden some credit.  He is too stupid to know he can't debate Trump.  The democrat party is too scared to have him debate Trump.  It's the best I can do.
This reminded me for when Hillary Clinton ignored to go to Wisconsin. VP Biden is avoiding the debates or real interviews
wow.  My new rule is that you need to go into the basement with Biden.  I will tell you when you can come out.  My new rule takes effect 12:01 AM Tuesday, July 27th.  If you don't follow my rule, well I think you get the point.  When are you going to end this charade?

Biden won‚Äôt be pardoning this schmuck, I can see a full on investigation coming as to crimes against the American people
Biden won't help anyone as he can barely help himself.  His brain is not well and neither are you.  I look forward to your movement being squashed hard.  This coming election is going to prove nobody wants your ideas.  You are going to look back on your movement with disgust.
You are living in a shell.  Your statement is absolutely hilarious and completely wrong.  The dems are imploding and there is all but zero support for Biden.  The support for Trump is going through the roof.  An uprising is occurring and dems may not survive the coming election.

Trump has done more damage to child porn and trafficking than any President in the history of the United States.  If you think he would have done that when he could have been sucked into it, you are not very smart. You go chase baby sniffing Biden and I will vote for Trump 2020!
Why would we do that Biden?  I think that is a mistake Mr Biden.  Will you still be in your basement?  I will be voting for President Trump not against you.  Can your supporters say the same thing?

its a good video.  The only way to fight biden is what he has said in the recent past.  That is all the evidence we have about what he is about.  good.
Is this more about you, Kamala, or Joe Biden?  I have very good reasons for asking.
Let‚Äôs pretend you were being honest, was Bernie REALLY worse than the shell of Joe Biden?  Until you provide an honest answer with a reasonable justification, you will be shunned.  And don‚Äôt give us the DNC excuse.
This is the most important election in the history of the United States.  A vote for Biden is a vote for everything against what USA stands for.  He is incompetent and dangerous.  Vote Trump 2020.

Very good point.  Joe Biden is running against himself.  Trump has the heart and soul of America.  I really think he has become a major issue for these elite.  All the more reason to vote for Trump.  He is right for America at this time, my kind of super hero.
If Biden has to lose and the Democrats have to fucking implode for enough people to pull their heads out of their asses and do something and the counter bet is that the country is totally fucked? I'm going all in.
Looks like that changed!  I'm voting third party.  I believe Trump is a dangerous fascist, but Biden is status quo  and status quo has proven to just be a red carpet for fascism.
Is this an admission that your entire goal is to make Biden lose?
So, you would vote for Biden since he is easily controlled by the deep state?  That is an unreal twist I never heard before. Careful what you wish for. Ha ha ha. Incredible!
I would like to see Susan Rice
I think Biden should refuse to debate Trump as long as Trump refuses to release his taxes.
You forgot the #PedoJoe before the Biden. lol
Is it just me or does it feel like #AmericasGreatestMistake and his buddy over DOJ are planning a TRUMPed up ‚ÄúOctober surprise‚Äù about Joe Biden?
Well, it is one of the proudest (political) moments of my life because my husband, who erroneously voted for Trump in 2016, just confirmed tonight he is voting for Biden. üé§ drop.
Im sorry Barrack but you are lying. I voted for you Mr Obama but i cant Joe Biden. He's not strong enough and you know exactly what i mean. Im really disappointed in you for making such a blatant statement and  i know you dont even believe yourself.

So you're saying Biden would be as bad as Trump currently is? That seems highly unlikely.
But this is happening under trumps watch, it‚Äôs the reaction to him.  I challenge you to find sustained protests when Biden was VP
The hits keep on coming!  Trump's America will NOT change under Joe Biden's leadership.   Also SHOCKING, top Trump campaign strategist calls Trump a liberal!  How will  respond???
This just in: Trump's America would be Biden's America.  This seems to line up with Biden's statement that under his leadership "nothing would fundamentally change-"  Stay tuned, after the commercial break I will eat a crow live on air.Biden didn't write this. He can't put two sentences together...suckers.

I'm voting for Biden but there are significant policy differences between centrist D's and progressives. Centrists are the true conservatives trying maintain status quo.  Biden, Pelosi and Schumer seem entrenched in 1990s political rules. We need new ideas.
Yep, and he was taken to task for it.
Ammon Bundy doesn't believe in law enforcement at all. I know of not one liberal or person left of Joe Biden who does not believe in the police force. The way it's funded and how those funds are used is totally different than believing in no police.

I won‚Äôt vote for either Trump or Biden. I will, however, attempt to vote out every Democrat on the federal, state, and local elections. The voices coming from the Democrats are: a senile, corrupt hollow man lifer‚Äîa funnel which the Marxist style element will flow through.
Dont worry about Biden, get trump out.
Our economy was great under Obama / Biden. Our economy crashed under Trump. We can't afford another four more years of Trump.
Why are you so opposed to a medical opinion Marcellus? Is it because it goes against your narrative? Is it because you want to see more people die under Trump so Biden wins in November?
They're not expecting Biden to run the country. I think they're using him to fulfill some sort of alternative.
We have elected a 5 year old! I can wait another day for him to...GROW UP! Vote Biden!
Dude, you‚Äôre not supposed to be campaigning FOR Biden.
Vote for Biden and we won't have a country to live in.
She is an amazing person. She will do a great job, but I will be happy with who Biden chooses.
Am watching Barr being grilled. Boy the republicans still are so for what the president wants. Hope Biden gets rid of him
That‚Äôs actually also Biden‚Äôs position as dictated by the pharmaceutical industry and insurance company lobbyists. You know who the entire dnc establishment serves.
So the dnc forced Biden on us... Clearly looking out for average Americans. We have 2 wallstreet front groups that go by DNC and GOP.
Beto and Bernie are vastly different in policy proposals. I wish Biden was as cool as your afraid he is but he‚Äôs got a long history of serving Republican interests, so I think your fears are sadly unfounded. Relax Karen...
And mothers who went to protect peaceful protesters.  Everyone can see what he's doing except for those who pigged out on his koolaid. He's pushing the videos as Biden's America. Except IT IS tRUMP'S America.  Biden will return peace, unity, intregrity and honesty to America!

Oh you mean softball questions like the media asks dumbass Biden everyday?
Thank you President Trump! Biden wants to start a program where prescriptions are mail ordered to your home.  Lol
He stole a winning issue. If he goes all-in on Medicare for all, he will piss both Republicans and Democrats off, and win in a landslide. Medicare for all is more likely under Trump than Biden. He's to the left of the Dems on trade, he's to the left of the Dems on health-care.

Biden is as divisive as a replicating cell, and has about the same cognitive ability. And, amazing as it might seem, I didn't vote Trump, and won't this time around. However, I will vote against the intellectually corrupt Democratic party in other races.
I'm in Washington state, and haven't seen any Biden signs, not even when we were in Seattle. Locally, not a ton of signs for anybody. Our state &amp; local primaries are soon &amp; most signs are for that.
So you're saying Biden would be as bad as Trump currently is? That seems highly unlikely.
Same here.  After seeing what Trump has done with the economy and the Virus I would be happy to vote for Joe Biden's bus.
Using Trumps current America to blame what Biden‚Äôs future America would be like is some next level stuff.
But this is happening under trumps watch, it‚Äôs the reaction to him.  I challenge you to find sustained protests when Biden was VP
I think Biden should look in the mirror when he speaks about racism.
And who is doing the fixing‚Äîdisinformation purveyors? Maybe Sanders supporters who think Obama was a fraud, who were dismayed when Bernie ‚Äòcaped‚Äô to Biden, who have a viseral dislike of Biden. Tearing down the country will have consequences in Nov. when a Silent Majority speak.
