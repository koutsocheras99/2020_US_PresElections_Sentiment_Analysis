Sure which one, there are many.. most were stapments made by Trump about Epstein and Maxwell. It's crazy..
He doesn‚Äôt tweet as much and his timeline is relatively boring (thank god). I think that‚Äôs why. But clearly he‚Äôs popular. He‚Äôs been getting more fundraising the last couple of months than Trump.
He only kicked him out after an Elected Official that was a member told him there was an open case and there were over 20 complaints about the age of some of Epstein's guest. Trump is quoted admiring Epstein for his many different young, beautiful women.

Trump bailed out farmers he damaged with his tariffs with government money. The government sent out $1200 payouts to the majority of the country. The highest number of citizens are dependent on unemployment than ever before. Trump has only enhanced socialism.

Person. women. man. camera. TV. The 2020 GOP platform. Why do you ignore this? You should probably focus on policy issues when Trump is your best candidate because brain power isn't his strongest attribute.
What is "absolutely right" is the old axiom "Birds of a feather". Trump, yourself and the GOP have shown over the course of the last 5 months that you all are incapable of leadership. Your dismal response to an international crisis is another example. U have failed America again.

Yes, it is. No other country had unemployment skyrocket to double digits from the same exact virus because all the other countries handled it appropriately while Trump shrugged it off.

It seems like that announcement normally comes when a campaign wants a boost or to change the narrative. Since Trump has been digging his own grave for the last several months there really hasn‚Äôt been that moment. It will have to come soon though. 99 days till we üî• Trump!

No it's an active case in Federal court. The problem with PACER is there are hundreds of hits when you search by Donald Trump because he is a party to multiple cases in his capacity as President. That doesn't mean he is a plaintiff or defendant.
Oh and the reason Trump has been accused of being a racist is because of the discrimination lawsuits filed against his real estate company many years ago. Also he does make racially charged comments quite often. However his son in law is Jewish and they seem to be close.
Ok so I haven't heard anything about Trump's father being a Nazi. Maybe a few people have made that claim. I know his grandmother was from Germany so many that's where they are getting that. I know there have been accusations and lawsuits against Trump for rape by a 13 yo but...

How can you be a volunteer and get Trump 4 more years in office. I‚Äôm from Arkansas
I'm watching President Barack Obama memorialize Congressman Lewis and I am waiting on the rising.  We will beat trump.
I wonder if a black Biden supporter had been killed for supporting him by a black Trump supporter if the national media would have covered it? Oh you bet they would.  But make it the opposite and not a peep.  Media bias is sickening!
He listened to his doctors when he had cancer and survived. He listened to Trump when he got COVID-19 and died alone.
Herman Cain was a good man sacrificed on the alter of President Trump‚Äôs ego and ignorance.
God, and I thought Trump and Biden were the only 2 bad options
Trump trying to tell if he loses will not except the decision of the elections and will not leave the White House ,stealing the 2020 elections!!!!!!!
As oppose to trump, Pelosi, many of the people in the house and senate. Their goal nowadays is to #conquerandDivide
Trump distracted us from the dreadful economic numbers this morning.
NTTimes: ‚Äú2020 Election Live Updates: Republicans Reject Trump‚Äôs Suggestion to Delay Election, Something He Cannot Do‚Äù Even ReThugLicans are over the #OrangeShitWeasel
"Cain was a fierce public critic of mandatory mask efforts. The day before his hospitalization, he had praise for Trump‚Äôs no-mask policy a Mt. Rushmore event, declaring in a now-deleted tweet that 'PEOPLE ARE FED UP!'‚Äù  /1
Trump says all schools should be completely re-opened... but the election??? Delayed ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ú®üòù
And u live where???  TX??Although Biden is actually beating Trump in every poll out there.  Even in FL. Even FOX NEWS polls have Trump trailing.  Trump is a failure and has not once tried to unite.  Only divide.
I wonder why today of all days Trump explores moving Election Day .... GDP Down 9.5%; US Economy at Its Worst: Live Market Updates - The New York Times
But NPR is right. It is technically possible that Congress could pass a law delaying the election, but it is extremely unlikely that Pelosi and the House Democratic majority would do that. NPR said nothing about what Trump is capable of or likely to do.
The current Asshat-In-Chief has 0 regard for anyone but himself.  Don‚Äôt think Trump will go to Cain‚Äôs funeral either.
specifically said that Congressional consent to delay the election is extremely unlikely, and I agree with that. *No one* is saying it is extremely unlikely that Trump would violate any law at any time for personal benefit, or that the GOP would lift a finger to stop him.
Hitler/putin/stalin/trump?
Keep that same energy when someone, who looks like you, dies in the streets by some fascist cop and a bunch of Trump enabling Republicans callously deflect to "black on black" as a partisan issue.
No, there‚Äôs no shit pile as big as Trump...except maybe McConnell.
Trump: ‚Äúchildren must return to school, every day in the fall, it‚Äôs completely safe.‚Äù  Also Trump: ‚Äúwe must delay the vote, which happens only one day, until it‚Äôs safe.‚Äù   Also Trump:
If Trump and his posse think there‚Äôs anarchists/terrorists marching in the streets now, they ain‚Äôt seen nothing. Push the election date and thousands more hitting the streets.
But this extremely unlikely thing would require Pelosi and her House majority to appease Trump the way Republicans do. "Extremely unlikely" merely acknowledges that it is not technically impossible.
Donald Trump killed him.
American politican Mr. Herman Cain is dead from COVID-19 and it didn‚Äôt have to be this way. Mr. Trump, if you're invited to his services, don‚Äôt politicize Mr. Cain‚Äôs passing like you did John Lewis by not attending services.  America what have we come to?  #negligenthomicide
Fun fact: both Donald Trump (6/14/46) and Joe Biden (11/20/42) are older than former presidents George W. Bush (7/6/46) and Bill Clinton (8/19/46), who have been out of the oval office for almost 12 and 20 years, respectively.
Herman Cain attended the Trump rally in Tulsa. Subsequently was diagnosed with COVID-19 and now one month later he's dead.  I can only presume that the official cause of death would be hemeroids, absolutely anything but COVID-19.
I agree about Oregon..   But if you there is a way to fit the crime in Chicago, DEMOCRATS may simply go crazy. They cannot allow Republicans (TRUMP), MAKE CHICAGO into a safe city. And even worse if enterprise zones recreate the economy. EXCITING TIMES ARE COMING!
Why oh why can't my dad be on twitter so he can see Trump endorse Nancy Pelosi.  He might finally leave the Republican party over that.
To assert that Donald Trump is an utter flop by all measures and from all angles, seems somehow terribly redundant. Unfortunately, for this Oval Office clown, we have exhausted all our very best epithetical descriptions.
ICYMI: French Hill thinks Trump‚Äôs clemency toward Roger Stone is ok because something something Obama.
Cain's positive coronavirus test came less than two weeks after he attended President Trump's controversial June 20 campaign rally in Tulsa, where he tweeted a picture of himself without a mask.
FACTS. We can like the man and not his plan. Unfortunately we can‚Äôt do either with Trump.
What's the link between US Christianity, which loudly calls itself "pro-life" in so many instances (and this is why 50%+ white Christians elected Trump), and toxic anti-life lies during this pandemic: Masks make you sick; hydroxychloroquine cures the virus? /3
This is exactly what I expected him to do and I felt like this was why he did not respond to Covid. Trump is the deadly pestilence on this country.
Trump is the only embarrassment and Barr and probably Pence.  Waste of gravity
said a year ago Trump is going to do whatever‚Äôs possible to stay in office even beyond two terms. We see the beginning of that today.
The irony of American politics to me rn is that the Obama presidency was ‚Äútoo progressive‚Äù for conservative white america when Obama was really a right leaning centrist like practically every dem. Trump was their openly racist white knight in shining armor
Trump trying to steal the elections already!!!!!üëÄüëÄüëÄüëÄüëÄüëÄüëÄüëÄüëÄüëÄ
Actually, it's not all on Donald Trump. That is abdicating the responsibility of federal, state, and local governments as well as the responsibility of the American people to do the right thing. The blame game is easy... being solution oriented is hard and requires actual work.
He put his faith in a conman, and died because of it. He was a victim of the Coronavirus, more than that he was a victim of trump! #thetrumpviruskilledcain
So a rich, republican, Trump supporter dies from COVID and the cure hydroxochloroquine couldn‚Äôt save him. This is sad. Not a gloat just a wake up call to people.
He put his faith in a conman, and died because of it. He was a victim of the Coronavirus, more than that he was a victim of trump! #thetrumpviruskilledcain
He put his faith in a conman, and died because of it. He was a victim of the Coronavirus, more than that he was a victim of trump! #thetrumpviruskilledcain
Gave his life for Trump.  What a guy.
Here it goes. We‚Äôve talked about it. We knew it was coming. He‚Äôs even mentioned it a few times, but this starts 45s ‚Äúofficial‚Äù 2020 campaign: delegitimize the 2020 Presidential election so he can keep power.
This Hotel CEO speaks BIG! America has many empty Hotel Rooms bc of COVID-19. The Federal Government won‚Äôt do what‚Äôs adequately required to stop the Virus bc WE need Rapid Testing, Contact Tracing, and Quarantining. The hotels &amp; Trump‚Äôs Storm Troopers will quarantine the infected
- trump held a rally in Tulsa, during a pandemic. - trump did not require his audience to socially distance. - trump did not require masks at his rally. - trump did not have a National Plan in place to quarantine and #StopTheSpreadOfCOVID19   #thetrumpviruskilledcain
.   His death is on trump's head. - Herman Cain at the June 20th Tulsa trump rally. - trump did not follow the examples of TRUE leaders. - trump did NOT protect the public. - trump shunned masks and encouraged others to as well.
So did they truly establish it was a voice over? I admit I can't imagine trump watching the hills have eyes.
Rip Herman Cain but watch trump is going to be all sympathetic over mr.cain but look at all the people around him contracting the trump virus and dying,so trump virus is still a hoax?
Trump floats November election delay -  but he can't do that
You are not the only one.   The election MUST be held on November 3.  If Trump dies of Covid 19 between now and then because he doesn‚Äôt wear a mask, Pence must run in his place.   There absolutely , positivity MUST be an election on November 3, 2020.
We can ony conclude that Trump Republicans are hopelessly stupid. If not equally suicidal.
Trump floats delaying election despite lack of authority to do so
lmfao y‚Äôall we not laughing but.. he contracted COVID at a Trump rally so we can at least chuckle at that part. Giggle.
In this scenario (which I consider to be a thought experiment), I think Chief Justice Roberts would swear in on Jan. 20 the president chosen by the Electoral College. But before that, I think Trump would resign in hopes of getting a pardon from President Pence.
Wow. Herman Cain died. Trump killed him.
He went to the Trump rally and did not wear a mask.  #Republicans have killed one of their own.   Science will win.
Yep, trump just vocalized delaying the election because mail in or absentee voting is bad
The failed leadership of   has decimated our economy &amp; led to the needless deaths of over 150K Americans. They don‚Äôt care if you get sick, lose your job, lose your home, lose a loved one, or lose your life. All Trump &amp; Pence Carr about is retaining power.
trump; this Country abide by the Constitution not by your twisted thoughts.
Mr. tRump this is not about you, but the people and what they want.  You need to get over yourself.  You have had 4 years to go against the American people and now comes the vote on how the American people feel about it.  Stop being a baby and take your medicine like a big boy.
Donald Trump is a threat to the planet!
I'm starting to think that one of the things Republicans hated most about Obama is that he was a constitutional scholar. It would explain their undying admiration for Trump, who swore to uphold something he only understands enough to despise it.
trump has finally vocalized delaying the election. Please read up on it, please
Trump trying to stoke fear into because he‚Äôs getting desperate and scared don‚Äôt believe he‚Äôs lies!!!!!!
Trump is just trying to play on your fears because he‚Äôs looking like he‚Äôs gonna lose in November,so he‚Äôs trying to stoke fears in you he‚Äôs getting desperate and scared watch when it close to the election in November he is gonna get more desperate and dangerous!!!!!!
Hell no your time has come to leave bye bye Trump
‚ÄúAccording to the Presidential Succession Act of 1947, Trump would cease to be president on noon of Jan. 20 if Congress does not certify him as the winner, passing his authority as commander in chief of the military to the acting president, the speaker of the House of Rep...‚Äù
Trump is unchecked and unbalanced.
Trump is showing you he is about to steal the November elections?
As Trump demurs, an unimaginable question forms: Could the president reach for the military in a disputed election‚Ä¶
Anyone who supports Trump does not support the Constitution or care about their fellow Americans.
"Obama is expected to eulogize Lewis, while Clinton and Bush will participate in the service. Donald Trump, of course, did not travel from the White House to the Capitol to pay his respects as Lewis lay in state there."  /2

I‚Äôve been told I‚Äôm crazy and conspiratorial for saying that Trump will not accept the results of the election if he loses.  And yet here we are with him warming up the engines by talking about delaying the election.  This sociopath is gonna do whatever it takes to stay in power.

No. Trump had a stroke.
We elected Trump to stop that, because we didnt. we don‚Äôt need you to spend what we don‚Äôt have.
Sounds like how trump won with Russia
Hard 2 call this anything but what it is: a racist appeal 2 voters. Horrible appeal &amp; horrible change IMO.
Big Trump supporter is Mr My pillow. That says more about him to me than having a long conversation with him.
Barack Obama eulogizes John Lewis, Elijah Cummings and John McCain.  Trump? Tweets about Regis (and finds a way to make it about himself).  There. Is. No. Bottom.
What a wonderful awesome thing to still think about protecting AMERICA,  brings tears!
Arkansas absolutely for Mr Trump!!!
Citing 'bills,' Trump sets troop exit from Germany
If you think that America is going to survive another four years with Trump in The White House ***AND*** a Republican ‚Äúled‚Äù senate, you are more mistaken than imaginable. You are DEAD WRONG.
I agree &amp; I don‚Äôt do politics. I mean why hate on a good thing for Chicago and the amazing people who live there who desperately need something positive? It‚Äôs stuff like this, refusing to give Trump a win on anything, that turns people off on the media and the left in general.
We are not stupid enough to be fooled by a partisan hack like William Barr.  I don't believe a word out of his mouth, or the mouths of those he or Trump appointed as their lackeys.
Barr says he won‚Äôt wait until after election to reveal Durham‚Äôs findings. Democrats fear a campaign-altering surprise.
Welcome to  's America.  Like what you are seeing?  Vote for Trump.  Don't like it?  Vote for  or it will be like this forever and forever.
NYT lawyers once responded to a Trump threat of a libel suit by stating that Trump had mad himself impossible to defame. Example? He acceded on the radio to discussing his own daughter as a ‚Äúpiece of ass.‚Äù Of course he never actually sued.
Thanks,(stabbing myself in the eye)  trump, you've made America aware of just how ignorant white people are, there's no wonder they've been flaunting their white privilege throughout history. trump has exposed the unadulterated highly toxic ignorance of white people.
President Trump, you are brilliant. As a matter of fact, you sir, are a genius. Thank you for your endless dedication and service to fight for the American people. God bless you sir. God bless America.

MSNBC said that a stint needed to be re-aligned to prevent infection. Of course I haven‚Äôt talked to her, but I just think she‚Äôs holding on with all she has to see Terrible Trump out of office. Let‚Äôs get the Dem vote out to support her.  She deserves her rest.
If something so simple treats this illness, which is so serious and now throughout the world, surely medical professionals would be saying so. They overwhelmingly say the bogus cure touted by Trump does not work and is dangerous.
I am afraid in this Trump/magic world. Will those who are most vulnerable, or those with pocketbooks most valuable, going to first? I am afraid.
This trump supporter got mad because I pointed out she didn‚Äôt know the difference between you‚Äôre and your ü§°
I‚Äôm voting for Biden, because Trump is a Putin-loving, egomaniacal, cowardly, cretinous, dictator wanna-be who disputes science, because it doesn‚Äôt serve his self interest.
Trump waxing sentimal on his supporters.
We r all Americans. Telling someone they can‚Äôt love this country bc they disagree w u, without any facts to back it up, isn‚Äôt helpful. The Trump administration has taken many steps to stop the spread and help major hotspots. Some of the mayors didn‚Äôt take the help, however.
Donald Trump told us that.
#Trammell #Trump supporter killed just for trusting #POTUS
Sorry. Can‚Äôt do that. Trump couldn‚Äôt have given two shits about abortion before he went to the Republicans.   When he was considering going into politics he said that if he did make that decision to do so he‚Äôd run as a Repub cause those people are stupid.
Go President Trump!
No, tRump is bring troops home from Germany because Putin wants them removed.
We just have to make sure that tRump overwhelmenly looses this November.   And every single Republican looses.   We need to peacefully take back our country from Putin.

How utterly laughable that Trump and Fox News would be catfighting! I'm volunteering for the claw-sharpening brigade.
Hogan Gidley, how on earth do you keep from throwing up on your shoes when you try to defend the oozing, lying traitorous corruption of Donald Trump?
How can any Trump-enabling Republican still face a mirror image without throwing up? Can you people not get it through your heads that Trump gives a pass to Putin to place bounties on our combat troops?  Not to mention he's causing civilian deaths by his COVID-19 misinformation!
Please be clear: Trump didn't address suburban voters. He referred to people living the "suburban lifestyle dream." This phrase was used to incite anger and action by racists.
Wait I took a mental health break from news for one day and Trump said something about sex with demons? I hate 2020And how many cities, has barr surged federal officers into under operation legend? How many of those police forces have joined up with them? How many of those white dudes are buying the propaganda they're now the poor victims, trump will stand up for em?
Do you really think the FBI spent over two years on a counterintelligence investigation into Trump, watching their leadership team and colleagues dragged through the mud, slandered, fired, deprived of their retirement benefits, and came up empty handed? No. They bagged his ass.
Contrary to Trump and his lying administration, we knew about the probability of a pandemic:
We should spread the word that his orange makeup keeps  Trump from getting COVID-19.  The germs can‚Äôt get through. Then all the Republicans will start wearing heavy orange makeup.  üòÉ

Trump wasn‚Äôt in California today but he felt the earth move. And he‚Äôs a scared puppy.
This is another ploy to shift blame away from GOP chaos-while trump is trying to justify martial law with his "storm troopers" sent to cities in a first wave. His WhiteNationalist followers won't be far behind. He intends keeping the Presidency no matter what happens in November.

You would have to be living on another planet not to know that Lincoln was a republican but, he would not support the Trump party and that is what we have now. They against anyone that do not agree and worship their prez.
I will personally volunteer to go door to door and pick up ballots and deliver them to the address they are supposed to go to, should Trump get rid of the post office.  I am sure others will follow suit.
Funny you blame the media for the depiction of trump. Remember Trump goes around the media straight to the people via Twitter. He does such a good job making himself appear racist that no one has ever seen anything like it.

You guys heard he was at the Tulsa rally, right? And Tulsa is having a spike now directly related to that shindig.   I‚Äôm practically the girl in the plastic bubble right now, but if I die of covid I want my stone to say Killed by Trump.
And have committed to testing, contact tracing, and supportive isolation. trump's only pro-testing for himself &amp; those who come into contact with him.
Yes. Trump's term expires in January of 2021.
Once Trump gets Moammarred down like Gaddafi for refusing to leave office he can have funerals in multiple places at the same time.
You can be I excited about him, fine. We all are. But to act like he‚Äôs a senile bat on the same level as trump is absurd.
Trump killed Herman Cain by not requiring masks at his rally and removing social distancing signs.  Manslaughter? You cannot waive a crime!
Obama and Biden have done more for this country than your President could ever hope to do. Please take the blinders off and see trump for who and what he truly is, a Cole and corrupt man who doesn't care about anyone but himself.
Please  - take your own advice. Instead of focusing on every word or gesture by Trump, do your job and legislate. Taxpayers are not paying you a healthy salary to grandstand and complain.
LEFTISTS and never Trumpers  SEEMS WILLING TO DO anything TO STOP POTUS from being reelected.... This is also why if Trump save inner cities, they dems will need the fraudulent votes to overcome the walkaway Black and democrat votes.

it's not that they went against it, it is unconstitutional to do what Trump suggested. There is not anything anybody can do to change the election date at this time.
They should be sub zero by now. Trump didn‚Äôt elect you governors, your constituents did.  You‚Äôd be smart to do the opposite of what Trump suggests/demands. Look at his f‚Äôing track record.
Only reason why racist people still support Trump as president is because they don't want to accept the fact that one of their dumb ass kind is fuckin up the world
Joe is pathetic, and anyone who actually thinks he‚Äôd be a good president is reaching. Talk about desperate, picking joe is the slack of a desperate party, they still have no one who can beat trump
Capitol Hill Republicans, if you can still enable Trump, or if you still stay silent about his traitorous, deranged behavior, you are just as weakly contemptuous as he is.
Good luck on collecting it! I‚Äôm sure Trump will say F..k Offü§£ü§£
"Conviction." Heh.   meant eviction, but whatever.  I still think early resignation for the purpose of getting a pardon from Pres. Pence is more likely than Trump refusing to leave the building. Plus, Melania will be outta there asap.

Keep that same energy when someone, who looks like you, dies in the streets by some fascist cop and a bunch of Trump enabling Republicans callously deflect to "black on black" as a partisan issue.
No, there‚Äôs no shit pile as big as Trump...except maybe McConnell.
Trump: ‚Äúchildren must return to school, every day in the fall, it‚Äôs completely safe.‚Äù  Also Trump: ‚Äúwe must delay the vote, which happens only one day, until it‚Äôs safe.‚Äù   Also Trump:
If Trump and his posse think there‚Äôs anarchists/terrorists marching in the streets now, they ain‚Äôt seen nothing. Push the election date and thousands more hitting the streets.
But this extremely unlikely thing would require Pelosi and her House majority to appease Trump the way Republicans do. "Extremely unlikely" merely acknowledges that it is not technically impossible.
Donald Trump killed him.
American politican Mr. Herman Cain is dead from COVID-19 and it didn‚Äôt have to be this way. Mr. Trump, if you're invited to his services, don‚Äôt politicize Mr. Cain‚Äôs passing like you did John Lewis by not attending services.  America what have we come to?  #negligenthomicide
Fun fact: both Donald Trump (6/14/46) and Joe Biden (11/20/42) are older than former presidents George W. Bush (7/6/46) and Bill Clinton (8/19/46), who have been out of the oval office for almost 12 and 20 years, respectively.
Herman Cain attended the Trump rally in Tulsa. Subsequently was diagnosed with COVID-19 and now one month later he's dead.  I can only presume that the official cause of death would be hemeroids, absolutely anything but COVID-19.
I agree about Oregon..   But if you there is a way to fit the crime in Chicago, DEMOCRATS may simply go crazy. They cannot allow Republicans (TRUMP), MAKE CHICAGO into a safe city. And even worse if enterprise zones recreate the economy. EXCITING TIMES ARE COMING!
Why oh why can't my dad be on twitter so he can see Trump endorse Nancy Pelosi.  He might finally leave the Republican party over that.
To assert that Donald Trump is an utter flop by all measures and from all angles, seems somehow terribly redundant. Unfortunately, for this Oval Office clown, we have exhausted all our very best epithetical descriptions.
ICYMI: French Hill thinks Trump‚Äôs clemency toward Roger Stone is ok because something something Obama.
Cain's positive coronavirus test came less than two weeks after he attended President Trump's controversial June 20 campaign rally in Tulsa, where he tweeted a picture of himself without a mask.
FACTS. We can like the man and not his plan. Unfortunately we can‚Äôt do either with Trump.
What's the link between US Christianity, which loudly calls itself "pro-life" in so many instances (and this is why 50%+ white Christians elected Trump), and toxic anti-life lies during this pandemic: Masks make you sick; hydroxychloroquine cures the virus? /3
This is exactly what I expected him to do and I felt like this was why he did not respond to Covid. Trump is the deadly pestilence on this country.
Trump is the only embarrassment and Barr and probably Pence.  Waste of gravity
said a year ago Trump is going to do whatever‚Äôs possible to stay in office even beyond two terms. We see the beginning of that today.
The irony of American politics to me rn is that the Obama presidency was ‚Äútoo progressive‚Äù for conservative white america when Obama was really a right leaning centrist like practically every dem. Trump was their openly racist white knight in shining armor

Actually, it's not all on Donald Trump. That is abdicating the responsibility of federal, state, and local governments as well as the responsibility of the American people to do the right thing. The blame game is easy... being solution oriented is hard and requires actual work.
He put his faith in a conman, and died because of it. He was a victim of the Coronavirus, more than that he was a victim of trump! #thetrumpviruskilledcain
So a rich, republican, Trump supporter dies from COVID and the cure hydroxochloroquine couldn‚Äôt save him. This is sad. Not a gloat just a wake up call to people.

Gave his life for Trump.  What a guy.
Here it goes. We‚Äôve talked about it. We knew it was coming. He‚Äôs even mentioned it a few times, but this starts 45s ‚Äúofficial‚Äù 2020 campaign: delegitimize the 2020 Presidential election so he can keep power.
This Hotel CEO speaks BIG! America has many empty Hotel Rooms bc of COVID-19. The Federal Government won‚Äôt do what‚Äôs adequately required to stop the Virus bc WE need Rapid Testing, Contact Tracing, and Quarantining. The hotels &amp; Trump‚Äôs Storm Troopers will quarantine the infected
- trump held a rally in Tulsa, during a pandemic. - trump did not require his audience to socially distance. - trump did not require masks at his rally. - trump did not have a National Plan in place to quarantine and #StopTheSpreadOfCOVID19   #thetrumpviruskilledcain
.   His death is on trump's head. - Herman Cain at the June 20th Tulsa trump rally. - trump did not follow the examples of TRUE leaders. - trump did NOT protect the public. - trump shunned masks and encouraged others to as well.
So did they truly establish it was a voice over? I admit I can't imagine trump watching the hills have eyes.
Rip Herman Cain but watch trump is going to be all sympathetic over mr.cain but look at all the people around him contracting the trump virus and dying,so trump virus is still a hoax?
Trump floats November election delay -  but he can't do that
You are not the only one.   The election MUST be held on November 3.  If Trump dies of Covid 19 between now and then because he doesn‚Äôt wear a mask, Pence must run in his place.   There absolutely , positivity MUST be an election on November 3, 2020.
We can ony conclude that Trump Republicans are hopelessly stupid. If not equally suicidal.
Trump floats delaying election despite lack of authority to do so
lmfao y‚Äôall we not laughing but.. he contracted COVID at a Trump rally so we can at least chuckle at that part. Giggle.
In this scenario (which I consider to be a thought experiment), I think Chief Justice Roberts would swear in on Jan. 20 the president chosen by the Electoral College. But before that, I think Trump would resign in hopes of getting a pardon from President Pence.
Wow. Herman Cain died. Trump killed him.
He went to the Trump rally and did not wear a mask.  #Republicans have killed one of their own.   Science will win.
Yep, trump just vocalized delaying the election because mail in or absentee voting is bad
The failed leadership of   has decimated our economy &amp; led to the needless deaths of over 150K Americans. They don‚Äôt care if you get sick, lose your job, lose your home, lose a loved one, or lose your life. All Trump &amp; Pence Carr about is retaining power.
trump; this Country abide by the Constitution not by your twisted thoughts.
Mr. tRump this is not about you, but the people and what they want.  You need to get over yourself.  You have had 4 years to go against the American people and now comes the vote on how the American people feel about it.  Stop being a baby and take your medicine like a big boy.
Donald Trump is a threat to the planet!
I'm starting to think that one of the things Republicans hated most about Obama is that he was a constitutional scholar. It would explain their undying admiration for Trump, who swore to uphold something he only understands enough to despise it.
trump has finally vocalized delaying the election. Please read up on it, please

You made a complete ASS of yourself today. Thank you for reminding me why I have walked away from the Democratic Party. You are all lying sickos! TRUMP 2020! Yep, I was once a Democrat....but thank God I woke up!
It‚Äôs not a lie or other wise. It‚Äôs Science. Doctors disagree all the time. Scientist disagree all the time. Only time and more research will know the truth. Twitter has Trump hate derangement syndrome. They‚Äôd love to censor or just band him if they could
Catching up on the daily lies. Trump. Barr. McKKKonnell, who is *apparently* hard of hearing, now.   SMH.  If we don‚Äôt pull this sh*t off, I swear to GOD, I‚Äôll.............................

Biden is a pathetic joke. I can't wait to see the debates! üòÇüòÇ That is...IF his handlers allow it. Trump will eat him alive! #Trump2020 #maga #MakeAmericaGreatAgain
And Michael Cohen couldn‚Äôt pen a Trump tell all. Could be a pattern here.
Just an extension of Trump‚Äôs policy of putting the interests of big corporations over workers. Nothing new to see here. Tax cuts for corporations and the wealthy. Crumbs for ordinary working Americans. Bush I was right ..voodoo economics.
you sad sad man
Going childish. Trump says that people don‚Äôt like him. He acts like it doesn‚Äôt bother him. So why bring it up?  ‚ÄúNobody likes me, everybody hates me, think I‚Äôll eat some hydroxycloroquin‚Äù

Trump‚Äôs America includes violating citizens‚Äô First Amendment &amp; Fourth Amendment rights. Want to know why people don‚Äôt like you  Because you willfully violate the U.S. Constitution to try to make your self look tough. #CowardInChief #TraitorTrump

Trump is really losing it. Reporters are hurting his tender feelings and running him off stage other that tail (which he keeps hidden with the help of his Depends and a girdle) between his legs.
I believe that Obama left a playbook for pandemic, trump shredded it, and now we have a horrible tragedy trump caused &amp; he is desperately seeking susan.  And we die.
OK, start listing the indictments that came put of Trump's DOJ, not counting the Mueller indictments since we know Sessions was fired for letting Manafort, Gates, Papadopoulos, Cohen, Flynn and Stone be punished for their crimes.

This is what drives me bonkers about the Trump clan: a total disregard for their fellow man and absolute loyalty to themselves.
Donald Trump wonders why nobody likes him. Maybe 150,000 dead might explain it?
No one believes Trump reads
THE LAST BALANCED BUDGET WAS BY A DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENT.  JOE BIDEN CAN DO IT IN #8 yrs. TRUMP &amp; THE GOP ARE SPENDING TRILLIONS $ ON ATTEMPTED PURCHASES OF A COVID-19 VACCINES BUT NOT SPENDING ANY OR LITTLE MONEY ON TESTING, RAPID POINT OF CARE TECHNOLOGY.
Trump's coronavirus retweets spark claims of censorship
Further, the less sophisticated voters who are affected by oil prices (oil field workers) would likely never vote for a Dem. The more sophisticated voters affected by oil prices (execs, geologs, etc.) are absolutely aware that the instability of a 2nd Trump term is bad. 3/n

Russia wants to re-elect Donald Trump. Doesn't that bother  the 37 percent just a little bit?

There's little doubt why this agency has downplayed and censored medical experts that have sided with President Trump. Another swamp infested left leaning Bureaucracy...üò†

Nah, there's more than enough police to deal with this, if the local government would comply with their oaths to serve the Public Safety. One thing we do not want is the federalization of police. That would be a Huge mistake.. Trump needs to make local government comply..

Personality and non stop child like behavior from trump aside, do you honestly think things will get better under Biden? In a few years, I think most people will be very disappointed that Biden won. Reminds me of the sentiment when Carter won (and let‚Äôs just not go there)
Bernell Tremmell, he can't breathe anymore. Didn't #BernellsLifeMatters ? Do you think Hands-Up-Don't-Shoot would've saved his life? Like so many, Mr. Tremmell's life was not taken by a Cop.
It's dawning on me that the Biden campaign probably does have a coronavirus policy already planned out, but they're not saying anything because they don't want Trump to steal their good ideas.
Tin soldiers and Trump coming 400 dead in OR. It has a nice familiar ring to it , no ?
Trump says he has 75,000 he can put in the streets.  Where does he get all these goons?  And who pays for them?  And when they ain't being goons what are they?  This inquiring mind wants to know.

Thinking about how the white backlash against Trump probably has more to do with the travel restrictions than his failure to handle Coronavirus particularly.
ü§£ü§£ü§£ like the CCP is going to listen. They've already geared up for world domination, and corporate America gave them the means to do it. A little late to be crying foul.. President Trump saw the threat long ago, many Americans watched as manufacturing abandoned them for China.
Trump was already afraid of Iran's conventional capabilities, and the PLA is like the Iranian military if it was exposed to gamma radiation and became The Hulk.
it's hard to imagine a shooting war working to Trump's favor, because practically nobody wants it. There's a very real chance even that we would lose.

Trump is a fascist - AND - NATO should have disbanded at the end of the Cold War. A poorly sourced Afghan government rumor about Russians should not be used to delay removing U.S. troops from Afghanistan.
Their logic is that if there is a handful of bad apples that are trump supporters then that automatically makes every single trump supporter racist, a white supremacist, and they hate every black person they see.

'I failed my fellow Americans': the white women defecting from Trump
They are slowly bringing their viewers to understand Trump is a fraud, an idiot &amp; a danger to the country. A little eye opening at a time. They don't want to shock them into reality too quickly.
Anyone else remember when Levin was a Ted Cruz guy? Didn‚Äôt support Trump in the primary. What ever happened to that dude? I personally was Rubio supporter and begged my friends not to vote Trump. We even tried to nominate someone diff at the convention. What happened to my party?
What I love about all the comments from people who are saying how unqualified this witch doctor is.... the only reason we see Levins post is because we are his listeners. Just goes to show the mass numbers of conservatives that are done with Trump and his henchmen
He‚Äôs hoping maybe Trump will give him a medal like Rush. These dudes are clowns
Donald Trump just tweeted about the Texarkana Airport. What is 2020
Unmarked ice &amp; other military Trump slaves (secret Trump police).
Be disappointed &amp; concerned on your own time &amp; dime. You are the most naive TRUMP STOOGE OF ALL TIME.
That is the dumbest reason to vote for Biden. Why don't you vote on what the stand for!!! TRUMP 2020!!!
#WhyIDontLikeTrump He is trying to kill me. Being high risk I have to hide in my apt bc Trumpers around here don't want to wear masks! They follow the dear leader Trump in all he says &amp; all he does bc they're brainwashed as fuck from watching FOX SPEWS, NEWSMAX &amp; OTHER RW BS.
What did you give to rid the world of Trump which would go a long long way towards helping those other problems.
Me too, he is capable of getting us out of this shit Trump put us in. However I would vote for a potted plant before Trump for 4 more years. Infact we need him out of ofc yesterday so we can get on with beating back this virus.
Trump
Did Trump just resign and quit???
Just like he is innocent of helping those wrestlers at OSU? None of the GOP are innocent! They cry foul and hoax when they get caught with their hands in the cookie jar! The US just surpassed 150,000 in the coranavirus and Trump keeps spreading lies! Stupid is as stupid does! SMH
Where‚Äôs the confusion? Barr was brought in because he kept Bush Sr. out of Iran-Contra. Trump only values loyalty to himself. Barr was never intended to represent the American people.
It didn't kill him yet, let him keep taking it (right as if), Trump can be a medical trial in himself. Hopefully it will show the heart issues is a real concern, after he falls on his face while lying to the American people.
Sew your mouth shut, give it a break, that many lies coming from one man, even a Trump will allow worms to grow in their brains &amp; make them turn into zombies. Fuck their are 3/4 the way there now. How do you defeat zombies again? They're chewing their way through Repub brains now
A Banana Republic salute to their dear leader Trump. This is what these people love, turning their once perfectly good brains over to a willing brainwashing entities like FOX SPEWS &amp; NEWSMAX + OTHER RWNJ MEDIA. They all specialize in mind control. Only intervention can save them.
They NEED to be in the same room so Trump will have melt downs
Please consider whats actually going on here. Elderly or retired voters &amp; THEIR FAMILY THAT LOVES THEM SHOULD THINK TWICE ABOUT VOTING FOR THEIR EXECUTIONER. I wake up everyday still self isolating &amp; think, YOU STILL HAVEN'T KILLED ME YET TRUMP, YOU DUMB IGNORANT DOTARD!
I voted for Trump in 2016. I‚Äôm pro life. I‚Äôve never voted for a liberal in my entire life. But this year 2020 straight blue ticket. If you want to support a dodger then your a loser. My grandpa stormed Utah beach. He would piss on trump not support him
Birther movement
Told people to inject.... not drink bud.... inject it inside them...
Trump stokes riots
Cut taxes on the super rich. Then told poor people unemployment was too high
Trump dodges draft
Sharpe makes the annual walk to Washington to spotlight the high rate of suicide among the nation's military veterans.
Donald Trump has such low self esteem. How come Fauci gets to throw the first pitch? Why do they love him and not me?  Let‚Äôs be honest. He just wanted to sit in the stands and watch the game like it was his personal MLB game. #TrumpleThinSkin
Yes!!! This is Trump‚Äôs only path to victory. You are not helping your cause! Stop the violence please!!! #Biden
Bro I‚Äôm pro life and I‚Äôm voting Biden. When Elon Musk starts tweeting trying to support Trump you know he‚Äôs in trouble.
Dude Trump was accused of raping a 13 year old girl with Epstein. I‚Äôm not lying bud you can google the court documents by simply googling ‚Äútrump 13 girl court record‚Äù. Plus he‚Äôs a draft dodger. Smh leader of the US military a dodger. Boomer gen elected him. Not the greatest gen
Trump is really a modern day dictator.

THIS could have been prevented Trump. More blood on your hands.
I don't understand all you haters on Twitter? Why would you follow someone that you do not like? I would not waste a second of my life trying to follow someone that I did not like. Like Donald Trump that's why I follow him on Twitter. Try following someone you might like.
So to summarize: Biden paid his respects, Trump doesn‚Äôt plan to. Wonder if that changes
He had nothing to do with JE or This parasite!! After JE arrest, if you did your research you would know that JE had money, he paid to bust parties.!  That's how he became known. Trump is being a smart ass because Trump is the one that brought them down.!!
This is BS!! She had lied and changed her story.!! Trump is bringing down these pedo rings.!!  Wake up ppl..!!
I also don't think it's wrong to blame the country's leaders for making it a political issue instead of treating it like a public health issue first, but anyone trying to do that as it relates to sports that wasn't doing it before is just looking to blame Trump for something else
you could literally make the most valid point but somewhere a trump supporter is saying ‚Äúbut CHINA....‚Äù stfu
Just have your Trump goons appear with their weapons of wars pointed at Americans like in our big cities &amp; just order americans to vote for dictator Trump or people will die between November 3rd &amp; January 20, 2021. Now that would be a real DICTATOR CONVENTION!
Oh please, please, please karma needs a big win here. Tell me you just gave Trump a big hug.
It better be VP or AG. personally i think she would have more impact as AG. He 1st investigation would be Barr, who will give up Trump in less than a heart beat if he isn't no longer able to yield presidential power.
The question is; why does Trump want so many people to die? Especially seniors on SS/MEDICARE &amp; (MEDICADE mainly nursing home residents), prison inmates, low income black &amp; brown essentials workers, drs &amp; rns &amp; frontline workers-worth the unfortunate collateral damage to the man!

I totally agree. Trump has control of USPS. I wouldn‚Äôt trust him. He will threaten to bankrupt and pull funding for USPS if they send in votes from liberal states. We can‚Äôt let him cheat. #Biden2020
Can we take Trump off the ballot?

Don‚Äôt forget Trump quote from the first covid briefing. ‚ÄúThe people who wash the dishes.‚Äù Trump has never washed a dish. He‚Äôs had slaves to do it since he was born
Molest children? Trump supporters don‚Äôt have an issue with that. Millions of GOP voted for a man who raped a 13 year old girl. The man who sent his well wishes to Maxwell.
What a fuck! Trump can't stand on his own reputation &amp; legacy so he has to steal other peoples reputation &amp; legacy.
Trump is not a Republican, he is a autocrat trying to erase constitutional law. Trump is an embarrassment to our country &amp; no respectable Republican or conservative (Trump's not a conservative either) would want their legacy associated with a Trump legacy.
Sorry President Trump. Today's society only wants to prosecute white people ( you're guilty for being white) and let every other real criminal go free. So no they will not do anything to ( lying through his teeth) Obama and if you try to prosecute him you'll be labelled racist.
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.

I say we surround all the Trump supporters. Keep them blocked in and away from any polling locations.  #WallAgainstTrump
But...Trump IS a 3D model of Trump, unlike his Hall of President‚Äôs animatronic, which is a 3D model of Hillary.
If all Trump supporters are racist, then you are a pedophile.!!
Trump'll try his best to shut down post office thinking it will hinder the election. I actually think he knows millions of seniors depend on the PO to receive their medications, this cluster fuck policy again out to kill seniors, his goal. We'll vote you out even at risks to live
Hey Trump; the vets didn't take kindly to your goon using a paton &amp; gas on a Navy vet. What happens A WALL OF VETS SHOW UP.
Way to go Trump your goons are bringing out the whole city. Plus moms, dads &amp; disabled vets. Trump: pull your goons out out of our cities. Americans will never accept an autocrat as leader of our country. We the citizenry will still fight to preserve DEMOCRACY &amp; our way of life!
If the republicans would‚Äôve impeached &amp; REMOVED Trump from office, I believe Covid-19 &amp; the militiamen police wouldn‚Äôt have been exacerbated to the point where our country is, figuratively &amp; literally, burning to the ground around us. #ActBlue
A decent President would try to stop it but Trump likes to drag others down thinking it makes him better.
Yeah Trump went to the  Wharton School of Business.. better than any European business school.
It was talked about on most News media other than Faux. I believe I might of heard them say once it was unverifiable, and it was yet another way for the left wing radicals to stick it to Trump. Oh yea it was they couldn‚Äôt bring it to Trump because the intell hadn‚Äôt verified it .
There we I think 12 that were killed during that time. And bounties were paid. Yet no mention of it on right wing media or from Trump.  Phone call today with Putin - no y‚Äôall of it. Our government completely looked the other way. It‚Äôs shameful!!
There are facts.Intell Dept responded with they weren‚Äôt 100% positive they could verify it &amp; Trump has said he never saw that intell later to say he was briefed about it. Even at the possibility of it happening-  NO ONE took action!!!
Nobody will change Donald J. Trump
Yes, I do!! However, I don't see that happening at the moment!! We have ignorance running around the streets!! Let Trump clean this up so we can get order!! I'm so tired of all the hate!! Violence!!
I think Kanye voters will be   80% non voters 15% would‚Äôve voted for Biden 5% would‚Äôve voted for Trump
I can't wait for this year of constant Trump vomit is over &amp; we can't get back to a semblance of normal.
Another pair of Inspectors Generals soon to bite the dust. If they're going to be critical of Trump invading American cities with SS STYLE UNIDENTIFIED TROOPS &amp; SUV'S uninvited to American cities. What if those troops are infested with Iranians, how the fuck would we know?
Convinced TLP is performatively anti-Trump conservatives caping for Biden but is actually an Anti-Left psyop to purge the Dems of all but centrists and the most milquetoast, capitalist "progressives"
JT. Nobody is going to stop protesting until Trump goes away.
I think it should be noted that Taylor Swift took a government loan too though, considering she hates Donald Trump.
He has enough integrity to know support of Trump was wrong and enough courage to speak. We should not applaud Trump and Barr's retaliation. If we do, who's next?
Trump's an idiot and Biden is not sleepy Joe, he is creepy Joe. Next?
When Michael Cohen said he would take a bullet for Trump, little did he know that one day he would have to eat those words! My mom use to say, be careful of the words you speak!
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a different world, and it will be for a little while,‚Äù Trump said, explaining his decision. ‚ÄúTo have a big convention is not the right time,‚Äù Trump added.
If y‚Äôall need a ride to the polling places give ya boy a Holla. These republicans trying to pretend like they want to help us this week because it‚Äôs an election year. As soon as Trump gets re-elected they‚Äôll go back to being racist rich white dudes  #ImVoting4BidenBecause

A Judge on Thursday ordered Michael Cohen be released from prison, calling his return to jail retaliation for a planned book on President Donald Trump.
Jake is appalled at this language and clutching his pearls. Jake is silent on Nancy Pelosi saying this is the Trump virus. Jake is just being his normal partisan news reader self.
Embarrassed for  with Meghan's uninformed line of questioning. Apparently she has not read the book and just had an agenda. She seemed to just want to scold Ms. Trump for writing the book. Set a bad tone for the interview. Invite Ms.Trump back when Meghan is not there.
I still don't think Trump will debate.

It's Trump making it like this. He's practicing his dictator skills. Courts will put an end to his unconstitutional actions in next few days. It will go to scotus, even the rwnjs on bench will fall on side of state rights. They could call national guard up &amp; protect their streets
This is Trump‚Äôs America right now.
This surge effort will include at least 100 Department of Homeland Security Investigations officers working in the region who generally conduct drug trafficking and child exploitation investigations.
Hardly. Every Conservative President was racist to some degree. Trump is just the worst in modern times.
Under the thumb of their leader Trump, GOP GOV's pushed to open businesses WAY TOO EARLY killing 1000's that didn't need die. Now dear leader Trump-same GOP GOV's are coming for your children-open the schools, roll kid dice A. kill family-B. kill teacher-C. Kid ruin now for life.
Trump better watch for lighting bolts because he has done A LOT that would piss God off!
NO EXPERIENCE AT ALL! HE IS JUST THERE TO BE MICROMANAGED!!! IT‚ÄôS A DAMN SHAME THAT HE IS HELPING TRUMP DESTROY OUR DEMOCRACY! HE KNOWS THIS SHIT IS DOWNRIGHT ILLEGAL!!
Trump to families of 140,000 + dead: .......
Trump administration secured 600 MILLION Covid vaccines from Pfizer (PFE) $38.22 +$1.53 will be issued at no cost to Americans.  Will you take the vax?
Listening to Trump's info some are false studies. The truth about covid 19 has been found in meat processing plants such as Smithfield and Tyson. Also the mask can help by 60 % but the eyes also exposed. If you know the flu or any kind of virus it's similar how you get it.
Exactly. Otherwise why say that?  Good gosh, I watched the documentary. He's horrible..probably has the goods on Trump and who knows who else. I do not care Republican or Democrat, if you were a part of this horrendous teen sex scandal then you deserve to be outed and prosecuted.
I'll watch a Magnum PI rerun before I watch trump*
look at the Bush‚Äôs. They all voted for Clinton. It‚Äôs so rigged with the mail in votes. I am afraid Trump, is going to loose

Absolutely! VOTE RED ON NOV 3! TRUMP 2020!
All you people are soooo smart. I'm surprised you aren't President!  But thank God you aren't!  TRUMP 2020 VOTE RED ON NOV 3!
Right. If hydroxycloroquine is the answer, then Trump would be correct and they just can't have him being correct. Listen up, America. Trump is correct! Hydroxycloroquine, zinc, and azithromax would probably  control the virus, then there would be no need for a vaccine!
Not saying that he loves Trump
Biden is as much of a criminal as trump is.
TRUMP 2020!
VOTE RED ON NOVEMBER 3 TRUMP 2020! TAKE BACK HOUSE!
And Trump is trying to do right by Daca. This one doesn't deserve it!

Yes, and they know the same thing is coming down for 2020. TRUMP 2020. VOTE RED ON NOV3.
She does sound like she looks like trump tho üòÇ
It‚Äôs supposed to be deep fake of trump and Kanye üòÇ
Yeah cause I was making fun of how dumb the conspiracy is. When the adherents of the claim fail to attack Trump, even though he‚Äôs just as ‚Äúguilty‚Äù as the Clinton‚Äôs if we‚Äôre using being photographed with Epstein as evidence, it‚Äôs most likely a fake story with an agenda
Trump will  call out the guard!  He won't let that happen.
Bravo President Trump!
TRUMP/PENCE 2020!
ME too! VOTE RED. TRUMP/PENCE 4 MORE YEARS!
Yes, and EVERY single Trump voter MUST vote in person, please!

Don‚Äôt you have covid? Biden is a better man, father and husband than any person named Trump.
Trump claims, with no evidence, that keeping school closed during summer vacation (as schools have been doing since the 19th century) is causing more death than COVID-19.
You forget Trump is stupid rich or something.
You called it again.
QUESTION FOR LAWYERS OUT THERE: We know Trump cannot delay the election and Congress won't approve it.  But, can governors force delays in their states?
I cannot believe that I am saying this.  As a liberal American, I have rejected the view I'm about the express.  It is wrong, or at least should be.  IF YOU VOTE FOR TRUMP, YOU ARE PRACTICING TREASON.
TBF, Trump would have been miserable the whole time. Everybody would be talking about John Lewis and shrimp would have to spend the whole time figuring out how to make himself the topic.
About 1/3 of the value of all the goods and services of our country has been lost in 3 months due to the failure of our government to address the virus. I ask again, how would Trump's behavior be any different if his goal were to destroy American society?
Gov. Hutchinson says election on Nov. 3 needs to go on as scheduled and #Arkansas is prepared for it. President Trump had suggested earlier today in a tweet that the election might need to be delayed. #covid19Ark
They aren't sure because he's been recklessly traveling around without wearing a mask to places with lots of disease. But probably the Trump rally.
Not only is Trump trying to commit yet another act of treason but the good news just keeps on coming. Fuck 2020, man. Seriously. #2020worstyear
It was reported that 6,200 people attended the Tulsa Trump rally on June 20th how many people will die from this??
Someone needs to do it, Trump sure won't.
Which is why Trump votes by mail. Only voter fraud of recent note has been almost exclusively Republican.
Right, that's the coordinated action for which Dems are so well known. Only person calling for changing election date is Trump because voting by mail "rigs" the election which is why he votes by mail.
Trolling is when you don't really mean it. These are not the words I want my President to say. (I voted Trump)
Trump: "fear not Aztec suburban mom's, I won't let those jungle people move to your neighborhood with their jaguars trying to stop your human sacrifices!" No doubt Trump fancies himself as a "Sun God".
here come the Trump snowflakes in 3, 2, 1‚Ä¶
In the end, it‚Äôs not about delaying the election.  It‚Äôs about planting a seed of illegitimacy with the same people who believe a pizza parlor is the epicenter of a global child trafficking ring that only Trump can bring to justice, revealed through coded missives on the internet.

I‚Äôm so numb these days...  you can literally say as 150,000 people died Trump cared more about: Winning an election Being disliked Golfing Goya Drinking Water w/ one hand Walking down a ramp A cognitive test White Lives Boaters in Flordia And on  And on And on..  &gt;150,000 DEAD.
The Kremlin today praising Trump's move to weaken U.S. military support for Europe should be chilling.
Covid.  Contracted at Trump rally in Tulsa.
Trump basically helped Herman Cain kill himself. I did not agree with Cain, but he did not have to die. Trump is responsible.
Flashback to 2016 when then-candidate Donald Trump was ranting about (imaginary) *in-person* voter fraud.  The dude just doesn't want people to vote.
What do we do when trump shuts down the country in mid October
Donald Trump‚Äôs Tulsa rally killed Herman Cain. #HermanCain
Herman Cain, who attended Trump‚Äôs Tulsa rally without a mask and two weeks later tested positive, has died from COVID.
Oh my God. God, have mercy.  Mr. Cain attended Trump‚Äôs Tulsa rally without a mask. Two weeks later he announced his COVID positive result.
Under trump‚Äôs leadership we just posted the worst economic contraction over a quarter *in our nation‚Äôs history*.  He doesn‚Äôt want you to know that. Or to talk about it.   He‚Äôs desperate. It‚Äôs BETTER FOR HIM for us all to be talking about him illegally cancelling the election.
Donald Trump's Logic:  Send teachers and students to school nation wide because COVID-19 will 'just disappear'.   Delay the November election because it's unsafe to vote.   This man is a clown.
Yep - Trump has tipped his hand that even he knows how weak he is right now.
The only thing Trump has shown himself to be good at is grifting. Whenever you see a wild flourish of one hand - immediately focus on the other hand. He would rather we talk about demon sperm, alien DNA, and delaying the election than an economy he has driven off a cliff.
In case you were wondering why Trump is throwing all the crazy at us this news cycle - here is the thing (along with Russian bounties on US soldiers) that he is trying to distract you from seeing.
‚ÄúTRUMP FLOATS DELAYING ELECTION‚Äù HAHAHAHAH SORRY MY GUY NO CHANCE
Trump is now officially pushing to delay the Election. Not because it‚Äôs unsafe‚Äîhe‚Äôs sending kids to school. So things, to him, aren‚Äôt that bad.  He‚Äôs pushing to delay the election because he‚Äôs f*cked his presidency up so bad that there is NO way for him to steal it from Biden.
‚ÄúThe U.S. Constitution gives the power to regulate the ‚Äútime, place and manner‚Äù of elections to the U.S. House and Senate, with Congress also empowered to alter the rules. Nowhere is the president granted such power.‚Äù #LyingTrump
Trump floats election ‚Äòdelay‚Äô amid claims of voting fraud #SmartNews we have to stop this from happening #RESIST #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica2020 #VoterSuppression
And so begins Trump's desperate clinging to an office undeserved.
Shut up Vladimir Trump
If your a democrat or a liberal you have already been brain washed by the Marxist left!!! President Trump is trying to protect the everyday people of this country!!
Trump. He‚Äôs damn near finished it off already!
We have a new POS president.  The first thing she did was to violate the POS rules against political signs in yards.  Trump, of course.
Are they considering allowing absentee ballot counts to begin early? I‚Äôm concerned if it takes multiple days to complete the losers will claim election fraud. Trump is already starting this. Also, can early voting period start earlier?
This is Trump‚Äôs next physician. Finally, someone nuttier than a fruitcake to take care of himself.

Gretchen Whitmer broke Donald Trump‚Äôs Midwestern firewall. Like, smashed it into a million pieces.
TRUMP
Perhaps shifting gears to 2022?  Saving for blitz this fall? Waiting to allocate to best chances to hold onto Senate? Trump has already lost 65+ (reliable!) vote which he won last time. Other crucial suburban vote now for Biden.
As long as trump is president this is true
Pelosi on Feb. 24th - three weeks after Trump shut down travel to China over COVID.  ‚ÄúWe want to be careful how we deal with it (coronavirus). But we do want to say to people, come to Chinatown. Here we are, again, careful, safe, and come join us.‚Äù
If you ever wanted irrefutable proof that Donald Trump is an overwhelmingly racist piece of shit, then here it is.
United States citizens: Black Lives Matter and we want to see real change in the systematic racism in our country  Trump:
Did the Trump spawn ever take that court ordered class after being convicted of stealing from a children's cancer charity? Asking for the soul of a country.
"... yet to see a dime."  "Trump‚Äôs budget request also includes an additional $7 billion in spending on education, a 10.5% increase, with money going to support STEM, childhood intervention in the opioid crisis &amp; post-secondary vocational training."
Looks like they got degrees from Trump University, doesn't it?
Trump is the gift that keeps on giving.
2021 will likely be the year of GOP reckoning that was scheduled for post 2016. Suspect much finger pointing RE responsibility for Trump and 2020 disaster where white vote goes for Dems for first time in generations (Nixon?).
If you made a list of the 100 most batshit crazy things any president of the United States ever did or said, how many of them would be Trump?
You can stop rattling your chain of bones against the cave and sit down high priest of argle bargle,  ye prophet of Cayman Islands profit prophecy, your Grand Poohbah Trump's multiple bankruptcies proves connected wealthy fail upward. A physician would go to prison.
Historically...trump could do stuff like this &amp; then blame his opposition for blowing it out of proportion &amp; it would rally his base....now its hurting more than its helping bc we are in a pandemic, folks are dying &amp; suffering. Words, actions &amp; results matter more than ever now.
Trump is breathtakingly out of his depth on the world stage, and he seems unwilling or unable to learn even the most basic parts of the job. Historians may be able to correct me here but I don‚Äôt think any president has ever taken the security of the United States less seriously.
Can we get a super cut video of Trump running away from women calling him on his B.S.?
How the ever loving fuck does a young man, a Black reporter look like old-ass Michael Bloom? Trump is senile and it‚Äôs not even a question.
We‚Äôve been talking like Trump unleashed Schutzstaffel death squad super soldiers yet these dweebs are trynna pull up with paintball guns and 3 pistols??? Looks more like Trump hired Paul Blart et al, gave em some Airsoft LARPing gear and said, ‚Äúbe home in time for dinner, kids!‚Äù
Same way Trump got elected. Electorate blew when they should have inhaled.
I get it Trump has never convinced me to vote for him... but I thought the job of Trump supporters was to convince me to want to vote for their guy. Not one of them has even tried to use facts or reality to make me change my vote in the next 98 days. #TrumpleThinSkin
I thought your job as a trump supporter is to convince me to want to vote for you guy right?

My favorite thing about trump supporters is that they have the time and money to rent a whole-ass boat for a political photo op but they lack the sense to stage the photo so it looks like a full boat.
Donald Trump treats women this way, are you really surprised when his jackbooted thugs emulate him?
I don‚Äôt see anyone verbally attacking anyone. I see someone upset that you said it‚Äôs like the flu after his sister died. I also see you blaming Democrats for Donald Trump‚Äôs incompetence.
Yeah, pretty sure if trump's gonna be in an arena full of New Yorkers with bats it's really not gonna end well. Like the worlds most gruesome pinata party and everyone gets to live out their childhood fantasy of beating a dictator to death with a stick.
(it was either this or a "well, Eric thinks Trump is Jesus, so..." tweet)

Lmao, can trump whine about literally anything else
John Lewis did more in his life by age 23 than Trump will ever do in his lifetime.
The board will follow suit. Anything to hurt Trump and parents all in the same swipe is a win for them. Every study in the world has shown kids aren‚Äôt the issue with COVID-19. Surrounding schools all have done a mixture to help parents but not TPD. Smh.
At least he‚Äôs not being a hypocrite &amp; going to pay ‚Äúrespect‚Äù to a person he disliked. Lewis hated Trump.  Obviously Lewis &amp; his family probably don‚Äôt want Trump there.  Trump goes: ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs not welcome.‚Äù Trump stays away: ‚ÄúHe should‚Äôve gone.‚Äù

Today is the day that the GOP is concern about the rule of law? No, you do not get to complain about the ‚Äúrule of law‚Äù after what Trump has being doing. Nope nope nope
The Trump campaign concedes the large majority of Americans on land have realized their administration is a dumpster fire however the boats have not abandoned them.  They will always have the boats.
In the last 100 years, I think the only presidents with a case for being worse than Trump are Harding, Hoover, Nixon, Carter, and Bush Jr. lol so it wouldn't take much for Cuban to be better
The video of Trump declining to pay his respects to Congressman Lewis and his family. His affect speaks volumes here.
So I see here that you accept there is a pandemic. Are you wearing a mask? If this statement were true- it would be a gift to Trump to fix it. But alas, you are misinformed. Please consume other news sources that corroborate and vet what is printed.
I agree 100%. I'm not a Trump supporter and could never vote for him. I'm struggling with finding a way to vote for Biden though. Leaning towards third party.

I have cut all ties to anyone who voted for Trump in 2016. Family or friends it does not matter. They are gone! I do not associate with hate!
All Biden needs to do for the next 100 days is keep posting positive and supportive messages on social media, make on camera appearances to twist the knife into Trump, and remind the entire south that they‚Äôd have SEC football if Trump would‚Äôve taken Covid seriously.
Huge. Just imagine if Trump had taken this seriously. We‚Äôd all be safely back at work/still employeed. I trust data analysis geniuses more than some right-right science-denying assclown and his sycophantic lemmings.

You‚Äôre just attempting to come up with a lame excuse for losing the election, which you will indeed lose, but not for that reason.  You‚Äôre a horrible president and aren‚Äôt protecting the people of USA from the Trump virus.
Biden should do an interview with Wallace. His team should prep him well and he needs to show that he can take the heat. If he can‚Äôt handle a lean-right interview, how will he debate Trump?
Well- when the trump regime falls, she will be sure to give thanks for answer to her prayers.

Is it bad that I‚Äôm jealous of the people who died in 2015?   Imagine having lived your whole life not knowing a Trump presidency or COVID-19
It reminded me of ‚Äúnormal‚Äù presidents who go further gray after 8 years in the White House and age significantly. I don‚Äôt anticipate Trump following this pattern because he doesn‚Äôt carry America‚Äôs weight on his shoulders. All he carries is his oversized ego.
Her memories of Barack dealing with the rough moments of his tenure: Newtown and Charleston shootings, and more, his grief, how he felt the sadness of America on his shoulders, stands in stark contrast to Trump.
She makes it clear that her disliking of  goes back to the first Obama term when Trump tried to bring back up the birther movement.
Yup. Trump supporters can now include the Ronald Reagan Foundation along with both Presidents 41 and 43 as having ‚ÄúTDS.‚Äù

I absolutely love it!!! Take that, tRump, you racist , fascist twit.
So let me get this straight. Libs that don‚Äôt control WH or senate are SO powerful they got Trump, Asa, Hunter Yuracheck, the Razorback football team and most sane individuals to support mask usage. Damn. That‚Äôs quite a theory üòÇüòÇ

MSNBC/CNN are bad about talking over the briefing with TDS TRUMP DERANGEMENT SYNDROME DIMocrats. FOX NEWS gives what used to be called TEASERS. INCOMPLETE INFO to PEAK INTEREST for the WRONG REASONS.
Correct, the 25A allows the president to nominate a replacement if Pence did resign, but the House has no reason to take that up. The historical precedent is for Pence to finish the term and be replaced by Haley on Jan 20, if Trump wins re-election. FDR did this twice.
That‚Äôs because Reagan and Trump are very similar
Trump will win. The dems mob movement has insured it. Many who don‚Äôt pick sides like myself, will be voting trump because we don‚Äôt want to see our country burned to the ground.  We will comeback to the left when dems gets a candidate who believes in law and order.
Hey Fraudulent Fauci, THIS is how you throw a baseball. I laughed so hard. Go Trump!!!!
Am üíØ looking forward to Biden presidency.
More people should be loyal to our country over their party. I started out voting Republican as well but it's not the same party as then. It's currently the party of Trump.
Would love to see America offer basic things like healthcare, child care and low cost post HS/college education. Many perhaps most Americans have NO idea these exist in most industrialized countries.
Dear Canada, yeah we know. Majority of us despise Trump criminal cabal and GOP enablers have done. It's not as if we just woke up to it. Really want to help?  Speak of your "nightmare" of paid maternity leave, child care, etc. THAT will blow American minds. "Wait, you get WHAT?!"

You cannot support trump and say you are pro life. You just can‚Äôt.
It would be awesome if the three of you would pay attention to the Fascism that Trump is bringing to America.  The GOP just continues to sit on their hands and does nothing about Trump being out of control.   But no one pays attention to what I say.
Disclaimer: I don‚Äôt like Obama.  Did the same thing on the border as trump and killed civilians w drone strikes
You do recognize that these ADULTS are making a bad decision by choice. And the mandate to return to school is not a choice? EVERYONE wants schools to return to normal. Safely. This is an idiot argument. Barron Trump remains home as his private school delays.
It is Red Dawn out there right now but instead of the Soviet Army landing in Colorado it is Trump‚Äôs secret army showing up in various cities across America. From Biff to the Soviet Army to Bond villains - This administration has leaned into playing the 80s bad guy at every turn.
Of course being pro trump doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôre also anti African American, that‚Äôs a ridiculous assumption and I‚Äôm not quite sure how you came to that conclusion. You can be anti-racist, and also disagree with some of the assumptions of the black lives matter movement.
Ugliness will only convince Trump supporters of their moral superiority. Wish them good health care under Pres Biden!

Hey Andy, Remember that time in 2016 when you held a poll for your viewers &amp; asked who they were voting for in the POTUS election? Results: Overwhelmingly Trump  You were surprised. It came true.  Now you‚Äôre alienating your own fans over politics. Real nice.I usually hate the disclaimer, but I kind of feel like Trump needs to put "Tweets are my own and don't represent the views of my employer." in his Twitter bio.

I hope our former presidents remember John Lewis stood on principle and refused to attend Trump‚Äôs inauguration.  They should follow his example by refusing to attend Trump‚Äôs funeral when the time comes. Just let Pence give him a ‚Äústrong and decisive ‚Äú descent below.

Impeach Barr! He only works for Trump! I can clearly noticed that today!
He was talking about CARES Act payments. That's the cut-off for a family of four to receive the full payment. Then "median" drops into his head for some reason:
Here's the full speech. He brings up $150,000 because its the cut-off for the CARES Act payments to families. Then he brain farts and says "median"
Yeah, I'd like to see the full clip. Can't find it easily on Google. But anyway, people probably underestimate these numbers, even if Trump overestimates them
And to nitpick a little more, Trump does not say "median" (at least not in that clip)  Trump may just be pulling numbers out of the air, but the median family is doing much better than most Americans would guess (I think!)

Tell me again how trump isn't doing anything negative for trans people.
I just don‚Äôt get how so many people can hate Trump the way they do,  think the riots are protests, hate the national anthem,  and don‚Äôt believe all lives matter.  Is it that important to be a part of a movement? I was better off when I avoided politics!
Just another example of  using his executive power for his own personal gain. Preventing them from building near his Trump Towers in 2018 is just showing why we need to vote November 3rd. 98 days and counting

Its not necessary to spout off what the MSM says they have proven to be absolute liars especially when it concerns president Trump bc he threatens their way of life. Things are changing the majority's waking up and we are not happy being lied to. DOCUMENTATION OVER CONVERSATION
Foolish Trump worshiper!
Trump is using legal military. The illegal ones are the antifa in red clothes and BLM running around in black clothes. You are clearly confused!üòÅ
This is completely false. There isn‚Äôt a single metric that could be evaluated that would not make President Trump a decent human being. He is much more humane than you. And that‚Äôs fact.

Total waste that only benefits trump.
Well I am guilty of that but when speaking to AzzO the Asinine Trump &amp; the GOP kiss A$$es you do have to use simple words !
Maybe there is  method to their madness. BLM logo on mound; players kneel for anthem; &amp; play rousing protest song. Boo trump intro. Thow out first  pitch. Boo trump as he exits field . Priceless.

Can you name one thing President Trump has done to suppress voters? Hes voiced his opinion, which is correct, about needing safeguards to ensure eligible voters only vote. Theres a difference in immigration and illegal immigrant. Dont be afraid to support America First

I agree Opinion | Trump‚Äôs not the only incompetent Republican

It's insane how Trump's whole campaign strategy is pointing to chaotic events and saying "this is what will happen if Biden is elected" when it's what is happening right now while he's president.

also i have now had TWO separate men wearing trump hats come in to s*ductions and buy prostate stimulators.... and imo, trump supporters do NOT deserve to enjoy butt stuffThe BLF-20 virus at work. An epidemic throughout the Trump administration.  (FYI:BLF= Bald Faced Lie. )
I really try to consider the "other perspective" and I want to ask anyone that thinks this virus was created to ruin Donald Trump...  How did they know he wouldn't be able to handle this catastrophe? What does that say about the President that he has let our country down?
I mean, our soldiers have fought and died (some because of Russian bounties to the Taliban that Trump refused to confront them about and wants to pretend he never had intel about even though he did and is an amazing world class comprehender) for that flag.
Despite US law, Trump raises specter of delaying election  via  He does not have that power. He is not "KING"!
No he didn‚Äôt. He passed away from Trump virus
Their is only one phone we give a fuck if he knows where it is. Hopefully they have hidden it from Trump.
LOL  ‚Äúall time low‚Äù under Trump  I wonder how it got there? And where is it now? Feel free to share when comparing Obama to Trump, since you‚Äôre advocating educating yourselves. üòâ
It strikes me that this would be a great time for the Ark. delegation to reassure that the most corrupt president in U.S. history CAN NOT delay the election. But no. These cowards cower in Trump‚Äôs shadow, providing cover for him further enabling his corruption. Disappointing.
We can't have this old dude losing his brain to be in charge of our nukes! Must vote Trump and red down the line!
Michele you are 100% correct all this is happening, is all a devious plan by democrats and their thugs to make Trump look bad so they can steal the election they thought they did it in 16 but they had a lazy ass and she thought all the corruptness was enough to steal and sit back
You sat on your hands for 2 months. You and Trump own this shitshow.
It seems like the Democrats have run Washington for the last four years except for what Trump has done on his own and the great job you guys did to get judges approved. Other than that not very impressed with what Republicans have accomplished, especially Lindsey Graham!
I am an Arkansas resident and Trump die hard. For all of us in The Natural State...THANK YOU PRESIDENT TRUMP!  üá∫üá∏üí™
Can you imagine the future historians combing over Trump's tweets? They are going to see a selfish, mean spirited, vindictive, misguided, ignorant, arrogant, lying politician. History is not going to be kind to you, Mr. Trump. #DonaldTrump
I bet that was a short call. Did u apologize for the dismal response from President Trump and the GOP? #MoscowMitch has had a Bill on his desk, sent over by the House, for 2 months to assist working folks who have lost their jobs due to your failed leadership. Did u discuss that?
Nobody has ever accused a Trump supporter of being intelligent.
Like China did? No. It's the damn fake news and our own colleges that's re educating our own this left wing way! China has gotten it's reach here by way of the liberal left that's taught private business and liberty takes a back seat to Big Gov and stupidity!  We must vote TRUMP!
Think Mattis‚Äôs resignation summed up his viewpoint on Trump‚Äôs actions towards allies. And his executive actions and tweets are bigoted and divisive. People blame the media but all you have to do is read his twitter account and the Whitehouse website.
Donald trump should resign.  Pass it on
Look man, I know our constitution is set up so this would mean President Pelosi and Trump is still out if he loses...but he keeps finding ways around a lot of shit our constitution is supposed to stop. This is the most dangerous thing he's said to date. Dude wants 2 be a dictator
Traitorous trump lies again
I still think Trump gives up before trying anything but if they do the meltdown on magatwitter when Roberts and Gorsuch stop it after it inevitably goes to SCOTUS might be so large it actually destroys this website.

Did Team Trump deliberately undermine social distancing in Tulsa?  via  There is two things in abundance in this world. Hydrogen and stupidity. Let is kill them all.
The problem with Trump's denial in the Russia bounty controversy  via  Putin is so happy to have his puppet in charge of the USA. Trump owes Putin. What a traitor.
Russia paid bounties to kill US troops, US intel says; Trump mum: NYT  via  Trump's lack of interest leads me to believe that Putin has the goods on him. He is a traitor.

Trump Rally's are  üëçüëç
Trump bailed out farmers he damaged with his tariffs with government money. The government sent out $1200 payouts to the majority of the country. The highest number of citizens are dependent on unemployment than ever before. Trump has only enhanced socialism.

Trump‚Äôs bona fides as a POC. Orange IS a color.
Read Foundations of Geopolitics. It‚Äôs required for a lot of Russian military. Trump is almost following point by point. The more he isolates America, the more Russia &amp; China can increase their sphere of influence.
I don‚Äôt know. Looks like Donald Trump Jr. is using it. And yourself. And me.
Better keep the Poors away! Poor people are bad people! Trump doing what Trump has always done, deny opportunities for minorites in the real estate market.
Why did you and #MoscowMitch wait until the last minute to deal with your constituents that are out of work? Trump, yourself and the rest of the GOP have shown they are incapable of leading America thru an international crisis. All of you have failed.

not to worry. trump and  will send bailout cash
As you say, Joe  the soul of our nation is at stake.  That‚Äôs why we must vote for Trump. Trump 2020
Asa started out strong but then somehow got derailed by the atrocious response by Trump and the GOP. I believe the President and his minions, who still hold most of the leadership in our country have failed miserably in order to appease a nut case.

Person. women. man. camera. TV. The 2020 GOP platform. Why do you ignore this? You should probably focus on policy issues when Trump is your best candidate because brain power isn't his strongest attribute.
What is "absolutely right" is the old axiom "Birds of a feather". Trump, yourself and the GOP have shown over the course of the last 5 months that you all are incapable of leadership. Your dismal response to an international crisis is another example. U have failed America again.
He can post it on the Donald Trump website and on Parler. Stop whining.
I do business with China. I‚Äôve been to China three times in the past two years. I know what it‚Äôs about. And I know that Trump has all of his crap made in China. And I know that his followers think that China pays for his tariffs when its actually US importers.
When Trump elevated Fauci to ‚Äúexpert‚Äù status, he surrendered his presidency
Trump had ample opportunity to do it himself.
The same thing you do, that trump is making excuses
Oh, you mean it‚Äôs going to get worse? Trump is going to fuck it up even more? Sweet!
That‚Äôs still on trump, not Obama.  If you bought a house and forgot to check the toilet paper is it yours or the previous owners fault
Show me the times where trump tried to replenish PPE.
Trump lost the economic war with China and the casualties were the US farmers.
Everyone has handled everything better than Trump. Obama handled everything better. Other world leaders have currently handled everything better. Trump is just incompetent.
Under Trump, we‚Äôve had to use the government to bail out farmers and send everyone $1200 along with an extra $600/month in unemployment. We haven‚Äôt had a bigger welfare state ever than under Trump.
Our Great Nation the very fabric of our country is at stake in this election, and Trump is the only choice

President Trump shared video later taken down for providing 'false information' about COVID-19
Trump is only 3 years younger, so why aren‚Äôt you concerned with him
I guess you haven't been paying attention the last couple of years. Our "allies" do not see us leading from the front. President Trump and the GOP have shown they are incapable of leading from any position, that is one reason u are in the minority. Better find a new leader.
You know that Dems passed a bill for that a year ago and Trump said that he would veto it so McConnell held it up (like the other 400 bills) and suddenly when Trump‚Äôs popularity starts crumbling, he declares an ‚Äúexecutive order‚Äù for the bill that he threatened to veto?
Yes, it is. No other country had unemployment skyrocket to double digits from the same exact virus because all the other countries handled it appropriately while Trump shrugged it off.
Mary Trump explains this in her book. Not this, but similar scenarios.
You know why he is issuing fines so high? He knows Trump (Federal Government) is not going to pay for his gross lack of leadership by not intervening in the other idiot deblasio gross intentional destruction of businesses, buildings and streets, murder is on both their hands
Trump has our backs.

trump is a fraud, and endorses bushies
Weird how these cities had Democrat mayors under Reagan, Bush, Clinton, Dubya, and Obama and this wasn‚Äôt happening. What‚Äôs different now? Can‚Äôt blame the Democratic mayors when the only difference is Trump.
Turns out it was a Trump campaigner.
‚ÄúThis will be Joe Biden‚Äôs America.‚Äù  *shows pictures of Donald Trump‚Äôs America*
Turns out it was an anti-feminist Trumpster who worked on the Trump campaign.
Are these cities just now being run by libs? Seattle? Portland? Minneapolis? Nope. They‚Äôve been liberal for decades, even through Reagan and Dubya and Clinton and Obama. So what‚Äôs different now? Trump.
Trump was right all along!
Weird how libs have run these cities for years just fine, even through Reagan, Clinton, Dubya, and Obama, but they didn‚Äôt turn into ‚Äúwar zones‚Äù until Trump fucked everything up. But sure, blame the ‚Äúsocialists.‚Äù ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Just finished Mary Trump's book, Too Much and Never Enough. Really interesting.
Are you tweeting this in a derogatory sense?  I‚Äôm not sure I understand you clearly.  Does mean you are willing to vote for ‚Äúa piece of shit‚Äù over Trump?  You must really HATE Trump
It is no longer a protest for black lives or against police brutality.  It's now anarchists hell bent on erasing many of our laws and our institutions.  Fix institutions don't burn them down.  it IS self defeating and is only driving voters to Trump who are sick of the BS.
I was right the other day-Fauci WAS invited and Trump couldn‚Äôt stand it.  #BabyBitch
All Vets and non-vets should vote the prez out on 11/3/20! Trump does not care about you.

Good luck making up the 3 million vote deficit Trump had in the last election BEFORE he lost control of a pandemic and skyrocketed unemployment to double digits and set a record for POTUS job disapproval.
