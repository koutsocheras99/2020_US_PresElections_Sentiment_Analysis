Kanye Admits His Presidential Bid Will Take Votes Away From Biden: ‘I'm Not Denying It’
I still can’t square “beating Donald Trump is our top priority” with “Joe Biden is our nominee.”  This is of course because the Democratic Party’s real top priorities are preserving the status quo, protecting the rich and powerful, and neoliberalism for all.
Can you imagine what the racist old bastard Biden will spew when the President puts the pressure on?  Will be epic
Great. But please ask Dad to stop exaggerating that Biden would double your taxes.
If a free pass is provided to those that broke the law and subverted democracy, it will embolden them [...] to show even greater disregard for the rule of law.

🇺🇸 TRUMPGATE USA 🇺🇸  The black vote for JOE BIDEN not you you. Trump you have nothing going for you. Your  are all done.
What blatant fuckery!!   is a fn joke these days, but a dangerous one!   He's both willfully ignorant &amp; overtly arrogant in trying to keep  in office.  A detriment to the nation &amp; especially to the black community!!!
He is way behind in Michigan and almost throwing in the towel on it. No current tv ads and not running his new rounds of Biden attack ads. Low dollar way to have some exposure, but not a concerning development given the reason.
Does anyone really think that Joe Biden will actually debate Trump?  Will there be a debate? Yes or No?
Who ya gonna vote for if he picks someone you don't like? ANYONE is better than Trump, and a write in is a vote for him. You might not like Biden, but if you're drowning and he has a rowboat, he can get you to shore. Don't wait around for someone else to save us.

Why not?  I mean, jeeze -- Biden's in them.  Fair's fair.
Biden says "unlike the African-American community," Latinos are "diverse" and have "different attitudes about different things" -
It's really hilarious that Trump tries to make Biden look bad to Christians when Biden regularly attends services with his wife and Trump goes golfing every Sunday.
Ignore.   Exclusive: Kanye West Indicates That His Spoiler Campaign Is Indeed Designed To Hurt Biden
To continue this thread. Biden NEVER should have committed to naming a specific type of VEEP. Self inflicted wounds are often politically suicidal. Pick the very best VP choice regardless of gender or race. And then commit to real diversity in your Cabinet.
This opinion only makes sense in a bubble, not in the real world we are experiencing today. I have a tendency to intellectualize myself, but voting for Biden just takes walking around sense (and I really hate it when people suggest they're mutually exclusive).
Next week: "Joe Biden is going to abolish air conditioning, microwaves and gas powered stoves."
I routinely got into fights with people in KY who argued Catholicism isn't Christianity.   So yeah people will absolutely take Trump's attack on Biden's faith and run with it.
You dont. Its just brainless shit talking.   Its an attempt to rally hardcore religious nuts to vote against biden
I'm voting for Biden #Biden2020
Actually AG is the best spot, she'll have more freedom. 44 will most likely get RBG seat! I really believe it s/b Biden/Rice! Rice with her extensive foreign exp. can help to get all allies calmed down &amp; they'll know the Adults are back in the room

It does if it means you would vote for a Dementia patient with socialistic views!  Anybody who votes for Biden is trying to destroy this country!
Yeah thats why biden said what he did. He doesnt give a fuck because he thinks black people are incapable of diversity of thought. Thats what youre defending.
“Ouch! My Bible!”  Trump claims Biden will somehow 'hurt the Bible, hurt God' if elected
Bernie, Warren and Biden not to run.
Trump seems to think Biden will have a lot more power than Trump has ever had.  Trump is a fear peddler ... he’s not selling a vision he’s just sewing fear.
"No religion, no anything, hurt the Bible, hurt God. He's against God," Trump says of Biden.
But also too weak to be in charge.   Biden is Schrodinger's candidate.
I'm still voting for Biden!  #Biden2020
The Biden Cartel !!!   Criminals 💯 %
Only the strength of Trump can defend God against Joe Biden...
Apparently Trump thinks Joe Biden is powerful enough to destroy God and the Bible.

When are we going to talk about Joe Biden’s offensive and degrading view of the African-American community as a monolith bloc of votes that he is entitled to?
The collective freakout if Trump said the African-American community wasn’t diverse would be so severe that Rachel Maddow would light herself on fire on national television. Joe Biden also (recently) said that you aren’t black if you don’t vote for him.

Single payer doesn't have 88% support. Biden won, in part, because he didn't support it.
Perhaps the reason Joe Biden hasn't announced his VP choice is because Team Biden knows that as soon as his choice is made public those who were not chosen will have the knives out for Joe in a big way
#Biden2020 #JoeBiden #SallyYates  If Biden hasn't decided on a VP candidate, he might wanna look closely at Sally Yates. Stood tall against a wild pack of GOP Senators. She's smart, poised,  &amp; experienced. Also she would eviscerate Pence in any debate.
Biden will sniff her hair.
Biden knows how to drive - hence he is 'one of us'! This is the level of political awareness? 😭

Id say mitch McConnell is worst. Hes been one of trumps biggest cheerleaders.   Now that hes losing to biden.  Suddenly McConnell supports masks and suggests "distancing " from trump.   Trying to save face and selling out beliefs makes him worse.  Barr is just a dumb prick.
I thought you drove a Trans-Am:   😄
A fave gif of President Biden. And no, I cannot imagine trump every driving a vehicle. Ever. Can you imagine the chaos?
Senator Harris, how would you feel if Vice-President Biden were unable to complete his duties as president?
I love the people willfully ignoring reality with the “they’re trying to hide Biden” narrative like he hasn’t done a bunch of interviews and virtual events. The occam’s razor explanation is that he’s just a septuagenarian trying to not get the deadly virus going around.
Biden... Bloomberg... Is there really much of a difference? Does it really matter
It will take a lot, but Joe Biden and his Administration will do it!
Pull votes from Biden in the hopes that black people will vote for Kanye simply bc he’s black as well.
I am still looking for the mythical voter that supports Biden, but decides  is just too radical, so they will vote for Trump.  They don’t exist outside the corporate class/the wealthy.
This was a good and important column and should under no circumstances be reduced to a cheap joke about why it is like a column about what wild bears will do in the woods
Just an observation.  Biden has said several times, "I shouldn't say it, I'm probably gonna say something I shouldn't say".  Isn't that essentially admitting he is putting up a facade.  I understand if it happens once, but this has now been several times.
Correct, Joe. Vote Biden.
Biden has ALWAYS been RACIST
Another data point indicating a decisive Biden victory. Vote and make it happen. #TrumpIsLosing
We know Trump has no soul. His followers think anything negative about him is fake. Can we get more coverage about Joe Biden's plans and accomplishments?

That's not Joe Biden FYI. 🙂
So you tweet doesn’t suggest Biden *should* do this, only that you’d like him to do this. That you’re only *suggesting* he do this, if you will.
I pulled this from bidens website "It’s within our grasp to end our gun violence epidemic and respect the Second Amendment, which is limited. As president, Biden will pursue constitutional, common-sense gun safety policies. Biden will:" -
Simple solution - the Democrats simply list their nominee for President as J Biden and if elected Jill Biden takes over the White House and Joe is put into a "home"
Hey  did you happen to catch your guy's interview with Jonathan Swan? I'm thinking you did... BIDEN is unfit to lead? ROFL Leaders take responsibility. Leaders don't obfuscate facts.
Lmao, actually no one is saying that. Also grad students are incredibly poor, it’s more like Biden is going to make sure I graduate into massive debt and sure hope the depression that causes is manageable since I won’t be able to afford healthcare.

Honestly the way Trump has handled Covid is likely impeachment worthy. But the ship has sailed on that, Democrats blew all their political capital on protecting Joe Biden 🙃
Well, I can assure you if the polls were saying that Trump voter's enthusiasm was less than Biden's it would be national news and the MSNM would be telling how much it matters
Medicare he is going to cut  Social security he is going to cut. When you think of that don't vote for Trump. JOE BIDEN THE NEXT PRESIDENT.

Maybe between meetings with your lawyer you should see if FixNews is hiring so that you can continue to spout nonsense during the Biden Administration. You could be tRump’s personal court room reporter.

Trump is laying the foundation to challenge the outcome of this upcoming election. He is a monster, an authoritarian who demeans the very foundation of our democracy - the right to vote, all while killing thousands with his negligence. #Biden
Joe Biden's campaign team now has all of the material they need for campaign ads.
We had over 1,200 deaths from Covid yesterday. Other countries had 0 or 1 or 7. Presidential incompetence has killed so many of us, and all Trump does is lie. #Biden2020 #Biden
I'm hearing  is experiencing a psychotic break on air because it looks like Biden will choose a WoC as his running mate.
Being an ex Canadian or shall I say dual, nope. It’s not owed. It should be earned. This VP is in a different position as we expect that Biden may do 4 years or one term only. The VP position should go to the person who is next to be president,has Joe’s back and his respect.
Biden Leading Trump Among Voters Who Favor Being Alive  via
If there was a real push to hold him accountable, then our election could be about finding a path forward, instead of rallying behind Biden just because he's not Trump.
I live in Ma. Very blue college area. Not 1 Biden sign or bumpersticker!
When a VP candidate can make a well-placed reference to Skyrim while talking about how bad the people in Congress currently are, you just gotta consider voting for him and    Better than voting for Stormcloak Trump or Imperial Biden.
Yeah sure. Someone is commanding biden......  Someones projecting.....considering trump is putins bitch
Lol another trump supporter you people need to stop letting this man brainwash you . Biden is the former VP so that means he has been in office already,  we have a 155,555 people who have died who had Obama and Biden kill their number for h1n1 has less body count the trump
It does matter because Biden’s picking someone to run the government for him since he’s not mentally capable of doing it himself. Typically it’s merely a symbolic thing to shore up the base, but not this time.
Love this so much!! I can def feel his hesitation about Biden, I’m with him. Not for nothing I am def voting Biden, eventhough I don’t even think he knows he’s running 😂😂. I had to, poor guy he’s getting so old. But I was in love w him and Obama’s relationship

Will Biden upstage #45 by announcing his pick  5pm?
3 options:  1. Stepien doing a reset. 2. Moscow Mitch cutting off the cash 3. He knows he is losing and instead will try and delegitimise Biden's victory.
Let's predict: Joe Biden says I'm corrupt but I'm rubber and you're glue. Whatever you say bounces off me and sticks to you. Nya!
Biden, an adult: “I’ll announce my VP pick in the first week of August.”  Washington pundits and press, barely a day into the first week of August: “OMG what’s *taaaking so looong*!”
I don’t think “all people have health care” is an unreasonable line in the sand to have... if that’s not an issue for u personally than u are immensely privileged and unable to see Ryan’s point. Biden isn’t going to give everyone health care BC his donors won’t let him. Wake up
Hmmm thats also why the economy was strong under biden and obama.  Did the swine flu or ebola shut down a whole country?  Ebola is clearly more deadly than even covid.  Yet we didnt lose over 100 thousand lives.  Obama and biden sure didnt call them hoaxes and play golf instead
With you completely Jason. There are so many factors for Biden and his advisors to consider. It’s time for teamwork and unity not disarray and toxicity. And when the decision is made we must come together and win.

The Biden Administration cannot be bogged down chasing down trump and his cronies next year. Appoint an independent commission headed up by Attorney Generals in Mass, NY, Cali, and Oregon to investigate and prosecute ALL of them.
Leah, that's all fine, but election time is only 3 months away. All of these investigations take forever and then some. She'll be reelected and more powerful than ever. Just like Biden and the rest of the criminals.
In my town I drive by about 5 Chump signs, 1 Biden sign, and 4 Black Lives Matter ones.
Lmao. No but if Biden wins we'll seen some Trump supporters eating their hats.
Yeah all the video footage of biden sniffing children and not knowing what day it is must be fake because trump bad
Cool!    But ... Oh my goodness please don’t kill Joe Biden by not wearing a mask so close to him.   😂.   Old pic?
The “empty vessel” stuff is from evangelical Sunday school.  What’s important is that Biden make his picks and gets organized to start work on fixing democracy.  In 2020 there are no big campaign events, but people know that without a functional democracy nothing will get done.

Biden versus Trump. Some speculate that the future of the republic hinges on the outcome of the next election. But for smart investors it doesn't really matter who wins.

I do. He is going to create chaos by inciting race riots to make sure Biden is bogged down. Being a sore loser he won't gracefully accept the verdict and may have to be physically kicked to the curb
Oh, you mean showing federal police force that is currently occurring under the Trump administration is not good optics when trying to explain that this is what Biden will bring us?
Biden can’t even tell you what state he’s in, do you honestly think he could figure out how to use Twitter?

The question is ... will you willingly hand that playbook over to President Biden?
He's just clever enough to see that he could turn it in his favor either way. A slim margin of victory for Biden = dispute it because surely there were miscounts.   A massive blue tsunami = "CORRUPTION! FAKE VOTES!" Because he also believes he's too wonderful to lose.
#wewillvote  For biden ofcourse
Actually little bot. It wouldnt be hard. The millitary would NOT be obligated to protect the little sociopath once the executive protection is removed.  Then when biden is sworn in. The military would be obligated to follow his orders. It'll be the best eviction ever

Yes Joe Biden was right in saying, If Trump spent  more time running the country then twitting all day the country would be in better shape.
At what point do people stop making excuses for this guy? How many times can you look like a complete dunce saying “you’re over reacting, he wouldn’t do that”, and then he does it? I don’t care about Joe Biden but anyone would be better than the guy helping tear the country apart
Donald Trump is doing more to get Biden elected than the Biden campaign and the DNC combined.
Biden isn't a puppet for Hillary. But... not the end of the world if true.
Seriously. Biden's nomination divided progressives from the rest of the Democrats. Now Trump is like "Biden is being controlled by Bernie, AOC and the radical left". If we choose to believe him, Biden gains enthusiasm.
Everyone lies you lie Biden lies cnn lies
How sad.   Democrats have made Biden their top candidate to represent them in the upcoming Presidential elects.  Simply pathetic.
The problem is that people that need Biden in power have no choice but to run him and hope he wins. While bringing in someone else would be better, these people would get replaced so they don't want that. Basically, they hope that Biden somehow can last to election day.
This “ambition” thing is absurd. A politician. Ambitious!!! No!!! The same as the foolishness about Senator Harris going after VP Biden in that debate. That’s politics. Give me a break!!!

Joe Biden such a horrible candidate bro
i really wanna punch joe biden
I could be wrong, but in my opinion trump keeps the political engine working with give and take. If the democrats get the office with Biden they will be able to railroad everything. Republicans hate Trump, which keeps things somewhat balanced.
The whole “any option is better” rationale doesn’t work for me. Any president would have been screwed during this year. The country was on a good path before covid. Biden using corona in his ads is frankly disgusting.
Trump is a piece of shit. But he is capable of being a leader, whether you like the direction or not. Biden terrifies me. The people who will get control of the office behind the scenes, while joe figures out what day it is is scary. Least with trump you have checks and balances
Panel rejects Donald Trump's request to add a fourth debate with Joe Biden  via
It’s because it’s who they wanted them to vote for. There were a handful of good democrats, and their names weren’t Biden or sanders. But they think Bernie scared away the centered democrats. But Biden is trickier. Anyone who values their vote on stances will have difficulty
Bernie was the candidate of the actual people. Bernie was leading before Super Tuesday. The democratic leadership knew Bernie would lose to trump so they basically put all their money and effort behind him. It was the right choice, but let’s not pretend dems wanted Biden.
This is taken out of context, as per usual via racist rag Breitbart. He was referring to voting trends, not people's actual genetic make up. They grasp at straws to make Biden look bad, trump does it all on his own.
Haven’t seen a single Biden sign or bumper sticker here in Massachusetts’s. People are quite proud in their display of support for tRump here.
How are they going to fight The media's narrative on it? Trump would hammer Biden on it but there's going to be no debate so he can't

The democratic leadership failed us. 4 years and a presidential seat ripe for the taking and they gave us Biden. Democrats are now forced to vote for Trump or ignore reason and vote for Biden just to be against trump. I for one vote for the best option, it’s sad Trump is that.
A little free lesson in Boolean logic for you: If you don't vote for Biden, then (by definition) you don't *actively oppose* Trump.  You can vote or not-vote however you like. You can prevaricate all you like. But that's how binary choices work.  Either own it, or kindly STFU. 🤷
Trump is actually leading. Chris Wallace &amp; the Media are in denial.   Furthermore, Trump would relish more debates with Biden. Biden is cognitively challenged. The more he’s exposed. The more it’s exposed. The more votes he loses.  Trump knows that only so well.   Chris doesn’t.
And Biden is the clueless, doddering feeb???
Remember when the said this for 8 years under Obama/Biden and it never happened? Yeah, same applies here.

After the 1st debate, you'll probably lose supporters.  You can't answer any questions about policy, foreign relations, or about anything else.  People are catching on to your lies and confabulations.  Most people already know they're voting for Biden.
Totally misunderstood. Are they saying Biden supports the inequality or they saying he supports the solutions Bernie proposes?

Speaking of cognitive test, can you imagine Biden playing a round of Jeopardy against DJT?

So you are saying joe Biden is not in a state of mental decline
That’s not a stutter. He never talked like that when he was VP. He’s suffering from severe mental decline. Want to know what’s low? Saying to black people that the GOP is gonna put y’all back in chains, or saying that you aren’t black if you are unsure if you want to vote Biden.
I can empathize. I too had to manage 8 yrs of”low-grade depression” during Obama-Biden years.  I have no desire to have manage that again. So, I’m voting a strict Republican ticket this November.

I bet they're spending a lot of time on focus groups and internal polling.  On one hand, avoiding the debates looks bad, I mean a total admission that Joe can't handle it.  But having the debates would also be a disaster for Biden. It'd be a treasure trove of gaffes and Memes.
Just my thoughts. If Trump wins,  the stock market will drop significantly. The smart money understands the consequences of a Trump victory. If Biden wins, the market will move to 40k in a couple years. Biden is predictable,  which I believe the smart money is craving.

They’re also lying when they say that, they absolutely will not do that and will instead shiv Biden so they can reinstate themselves as Bush-era republican leadership.  We’re headed right back to 2000-2008 once 2024 rolls around if the Dems don’t smarten up, which they will not.
That’s why they’re getting things in place now so there won’t be a Democratic administration past 2024.  They’re going to shiv Biden gleefully and blame him for being unable to fix the fallout of the trump administration, and they’ll present themselves as the way forward.
Notice how he cherry-picks the one bit of information that makes him look good, yet ignores the salient parts that reflect reality? Like, he’s behind Biden by double digits. I think Putin had 99% approval in his party, and Kim has 100%. Gotta do better.

Honestly a swing state or two probably won't matter much if Biden is able to flip a couple firm red states like Texas or Georgia.
Sounds like he pitching for How Biden.
and as for Biden winning:  here's clear proof Sanders won &amp; DP installed Biden.
Biden is most definitely unfit--in mental decline, inappropriate with females, and a 1% centrist republican who will maintain the status quo &amp;  capitalistic greed.
This approach doesn't challenge or take on the DP lie that Bernie lost and Biden won. Stand up for the whole truth. Don't barter with the deception to gain crumbs that ultimately won't  bring #GreenNewDeal, racial &amp; gender equality &amp; justice and an end to psychopathic rule.
We refuse to accept the DP destruction of our votes and arbitrarily naming Biden the winner to maintain DP power &amp; control.   I'm voting for the real winner of the 2016 and 2020 primaries, Bernie Sanders.  Will you join me?
If Biden wins there won't need to be a rightwing version of #Resistance because Biden won't be a criminal despot in hock to a hostile foreign power and bent an undermining the rule of law.  *There will be a relentless rightwing assault on the Biden administration anyway.

Demetrius, Moscow was the Capital of the Communist USSR.  Republicans are anti-Communists,  anti-Marxis, Pro-Capitalism.  Democrats are anti-Capitalism, Pro-Socislism, &amp; in Bernie Saunders &amp; “The Squad’s” case Marxist.  So “Moscow Mitch” doesn’t fit. However,Beijing Biden does.🤷🏼‍♂️
It was meant to emasculate Biden on some level, I suppose... but ironically it seems to have given him an almost Reagan-level teflon coating.   "Dopey-Slow Joe can't have done that--- he's just way too Dopey! And Slow!"  (I wonder if it'll hold?🤷)
Popular culture (SNL, etc) has portrayed Biden as "Dopey Uncle Joe" since long before he was even VP. So everyone "just knows" that "Biden isn't smart."  (Just as everyone seemed to "just know" that "HRC was corrupt", despite little real evidence of her being particularly so).
If Biden were to announce a Photoshop Czar that would ensure official photos were at least faked WELL...it, alone, would be enough to secure my vote.
Biden should delay as long as possible as it’ll drive the right crazy that they can’t target an individual woman. Targeting them all looks bad.
In Biden’s defense, he probably doesn’t know what day it is.
I don't feel like listening to your pro 1% aligned selling of Biden. Blocked.
"vote for Biden" is telling the DP that we condone and accept their behavior in changing our votes and falsely naming Biden as winner, when Sanders clearly won again.  Hold the DP accountable.
Many of us have repeatedly made comments similar to yours. We need to continue to state them repeatedly without backing down. We also need to insist that they stop pushing an unfit Biden on voters and acknowledge that Sanders won. This is our moment to demand a return to sanity.
I criticize Biden/Pelosi and will continue doing so. My vote against Trump is because I want him gone, otherwise I've had it with the DNC. Never again. We need to stop believing this "electability" BS and vote our conscience. A new way will never happen unless we make it happen.

Biden shouldn't pull a running mate from the Senate. Things are precarious there at best. Post-election he can fill cabinet positions from the Senate, providing the Dem majority can withstand the loss.
constitutionaly he cannot delay the election its in the constitution every 4 years we should have an election for president hes afraid hes going to loose to joe biden if he looses whats he going to do hold the house hostage

I vote for Biden to drop out and be replaced by the actual winner, Bernie Sanders.
Between Biden being the author of the Crime Bill and supporter of the Civil asset forfeiture bill and Harris being a 'tough on crime' DA, I can't imagine a Dem ticket that is a bigger "FUCK YOU" to BLM.

Oh sweetheart, if Biden WERE President (as he WILL BE in November) he would have been proactive managing this pandemic, demanded masks to be worn, followed advice of medical experts and would have led this nation rather than having his head up his a$$, golfing &amp; being on twitter.
Today's thought: the vast vast majority of people have already decided between Trump and Biden. The ONLY thing that is at play is whether or not they will vote. No matter what Trump does, his supporters do. not. care. The rest of us need to vote. Period.
Maybe it will work and he'll be able to wangle a Trump-v-Biden SCOTUS decision amid the violence that will get him his second term. But even if it doesn't, the cost to the country in blood spilled, lives lost, and confidence wrecked will be tremendous.

Liberals are going to be so confused when and if Biden enters office and the protests don't stop. "But Trump is gone!" Yeah. And Black people are still being targeted by the police. And now it's Biden bolstering them.
I know politicians have to (or feel like they have to) play this game. But Biden isn't going to budge an inch on any substantive issue. They need to sell him as "not Trump" and hope it works better than in 2016. Nobody buys this narrative except Republicans.

I have. I don't know which way I'm voting but its not Biden or Trump
I would never want to be with a woman that has an orgasm because you voted for Biden.  I would never date a woman that votes for Biden.
He,like a lot of us,love the weekend! He and his people are still doing ok!  A virus vaccine is in the works! And remember toots. He's still in th public eye! Where's Biden, hiding!
Well I might vote green. I might write in Bernie just to piss off the DNC. I dont know yet. Wont vote for Biden though.
I was told today that if I dont vote for Biden I'm voting for Trump. I mean I get this every day but today it was from my best friend. Well, now ex-best-friend.  Its a really sad day

It’s 2020 and it’s Joe Biden vs Trump ... how the fuck did we end up here?
I need all the people to absorb and retain what I am about to share:  there is no “if Biden does this or if Biden doesn’t do that” are you voting for him shit.   You and I and every sane and rational individual in this country, for the sake of this country is going to vote Biden.
I went out to canvass today.  I saw something I never thought I would see.  I saw a Joe Biden sign in the wild. I can never again say I've never seen one. This sucks.
Hwey start making those call for Biden. Stop wasting time with me. Want to win then hit those phones. Get to it already!!!!
MORE EMOTION!!!! EMOTION ISNT ALLOWED. YOUR RULE NOT MINE!!!! STOP WITH THE EMOTION. FACTS ONLY.  The fact is we will all still die and suffer under Biden. Fact
If you cant see why Biden and the DNC should never be in the white house then you have been lost for decades.
As a communist and as someone who sees that Biden is as bad as Trump I dont give a fuck who wins.  Neither one of them represent me and instead represent the big capitalists.  I'm not stupid. I dont play the lesser of 2 evils game. You do
zOmG yOu WoNt VoTe FoR bIdEn YoU mUsT lIkE tRuMp.  This dude is exactly why this country is becoming fascist. They enable it by playing the lesser of 2 evils game.
Thats not how voting works or ever works. I dont support either. I want both of them to drop dead now.  If you got AIDS would you try to treat it by injecting more AIDS? Trump is a symptom of the disease. Biden is the disease. You dont cure the disease with more disease.
Trump can run in 2024  Biden should never be president. His record has shown he will be worse. He just has a nice smile and that has you fooled into thinking he can be moved left when he cant. He's a republican.
Lolol. Biden wouldn't have done anything differently. Go look at occupy wall street or standing rock. Kinds in cages started under Obama/Biden. Biden wrote the patriot act and 94 crime bill. Biden won't move left if he's in office. People who think that never paid attention.
Read through this thread. Its obvious you don't understand Biden is as far right as Trump is and is directly responsible for why we have Trump. There is no moving Biden to the left. Lefties are smart enough to know this
love your wild conspiracies based on your feelings.  no one said anything about Trump, just you.  I did not vote for him.  But Biden has 50 years of uselessness under his belt.  And Russia has been nothing but pissed at us and is an ally of China.
Do you think that moves her up or down on Biden's VP list?
Joe Biden will be smoking the poles In Gitmo i bet ya.#prisonpedojoe
(the 25-24-1 scenario above is with the current House.  If the Dems can flip the delegations of two states then they can just elect Biden if there's at least one EV for Biden.)
On reflection, I guess this could be one way we get P and VP from different parties. GOP controlled Senate picks Pence, but Dem controlled House picks Biden.  (Assuming the new House would have a by-state Dem advantage).
Not just that, but so what if Trump doesn't leave the WH? There's no magic sauce about the WH.  The president is the president wherever he is.  Biden can sign laws, issue EOs, command the military, from wherever he happens to be even if Trump holes up in WH.
Ryan is definitely a Trump voter, mainly due of his admiration of Jared Kushner.  Creed is voting for Biden because they used to throw back some cool ones and jam together.
This is the first big decision Biden has had to make. And it's beyond a cluster fuck. It's unbearable to watch.  Come what may, there's only one person coming out glowing out of this process, and I will forever proudly stand by her. #KamalaHarrisForVP
Instead, your solution is to keep moving things to the right because that's what Biden will bring.
No. 94 crime bill. Written by Biden. Patriot Act. Yeah that was Biden. The democrats have given Trump just about everything he wants. Caging children happened when Biden was VP. The neoliberal capitalists gave us Trump. Biden gave us Trump. Biden is far right.
Biden isn't going to make those changes. He has always been a republic dressed with a D, and for some reason, you believe the democrats are the good guys even though they keep moving further and further right. Biden is a known pathological liar.
Lololololol.  Biden would have to be left for him to do that. He's far-right.
This dude disgusts me. The fact that settle for Biden is a slogan is so fvcking gross. People like  clearly do not understand why it is we have Trump. Let me tell you. It's Biden.
If this is what its going to take to A. Make Trump so mad he explodes; B. Convinces some republicans to vote Biden; or C. Properly IDs species Oompa Loompiticus, I'm pleased. #LincolnProject #LincolnProjectEffect #TeamJoe
Maybe Joe Biden?  Isn’t he getting the briefings now too?
either option is shitty for Biden. Just like how this entire process has unfolded in the last 2-3 weeks. This all could have been much better. If he wanted it to...
are these series of Kamala is the reincarnation of the devil leaks from old white men a result of Biden already having told them she is the pick? And they dont like it?  Or Biden testing the waters to see if any of these slanders stick, thereby not selecting Kamala.
oh boy the other corrupt party that uses victims for votes!  all the crime cesspools and police problems are in longtime blue cities.  And Biden has helped no one in 50yrs and touches kids.  but yay for your feelings!
Biden is as much a socialist as Reagan, who by the way signed a bill to ban assault weapons. It's more like Biden against Fascism, Racism, Nepotism, Sexism, &amp; Division
Many people are looking extra closely at this VP pick due to the fact that Biden will probably not seek a second term if elected. There’s a very good chance that his VP will succeed him as president
This is bad. It gives Trump even the weakest leg to stand on. (And don’t think he’ll be bothered by the contradiction of using this while smearing Biden with China.)
You have a serious problem if you think Joe Biden is a healthy man.   Get some guidance.
C) Leave now. Don't vote for Biden.
You overestimate Biden. it’s gonna be like 2016 again except you dropped out early and are supporting a man that can’t complete a coherent sentence. Yes Hillary is evil but at least she’s an evil genius.
The left has already exploited the China virus to make fraudulent mail in voting the norm. Concealing Biden’s dementia is I’m sure within their capacity to further enable their Communist cabal.
Don't get distracted: the election won't be delayed and Covid won't be managed. We need to keep our eyes on the ball and make sure everyone votes. Oh, and remember  endorsed Biden today. #TeamJoe #Hamilton #bidencoalition #VoteThemAllOut #VoteThemAllOut2020
Ha ha ha!!!  Ha ha!!! I love watching Trump squirm while he looks for ways to cheat so he can win. He made his own noose.  First term FAIL! BIDEN 2020!
We’ve read “1984”, but didn’t read this new chapter below in the latest edition.
Totally agree. I love Warren as my senator and hope that she can stay in the Senate continuing to create pressure from the left. Her roll on the Senate will be vital to keep Biden from moderating too much.
I don't agree with that. But I also believe that mail in voting opens the door to to many fraud issues! For instance,if someone votes Trump,before it's counted some could easily mark it for Biden making that voting ballet void!Nevermind being lost in the mail!

Opinion | Joe Biden accused Trump of trying to delay the election. He should know better.
Mr president you were on a roll the last couple weeks now you just gave the dems the ammunition they were looking for delay the election that is absurd and will give it to Biden  #Trump2020
Look electoral college will be 467 to 71. Ruthless lockdowns flip CA &amp; NY. Biden plank of millions of units of Section 8 housing to the suburbs flips NJ CT. Riots in their largest cities flip WA &amp; OR. Flynn for US Senate flips RI. Scorched earth leaves Dems with lL MD VA DE MA VT
Ruthless Cuomo and Newsom lockdowns flip CA &amp; NY. Biden plank to move millions of Section 8 housing units to the suburbs flip NJ &amp; CT. Riots in Portland &amp; Seattle flip OR &amp; WA. Electoral College blowout 467 to 71.
No better strategy to make me root for  selection as  running mate.
Biden with anyone is just NO GOOD
But is anyone looking for Biden?
Biden wants someone simpatico and ready. We all know why.
Biden is a complete mess! In Chicago in particular,Trump sent in help! FBI,ETC agent's to help police departments investigate the uptic in violent crimes. In Portland,it's a complete shitshow! Law and order needs to be established. If the local officials won't,the Fed's will!
Come on - is this question for real? Anyone who has watched/listened to  recently realizes that he couldn't be the leader of a kindergarten class at this point, let alone the free world! Jill Biden &amp; the Democraps should be ashamed of themselves, but they have no shame.
Biden can end this with the VP announcement.   It is still his choice, but he is in a quandary now - if he doesnt pick Kamala, is it because (i) she said no, (ii) they mutually decided they couldnt work together, or (iii) he listened to his bundlers and Dodd?
So? Biden is literally a former VP running for President.

I think Biden needs regular air time to speak and show just how on the ball that man is!! #RidenWithBiden2020

I think Joe Biden is probably a kind person.  His wife seems to be pretty great too.  But I just don’t have confidence in his ability to lead.  He seems to pander to much to the “cause of the day”.  Trump is ruthless, a former if not present womanizer but he’s a good president.
Shouldn’t you be cowering in the basement w Joe Biden?
hopefully at some point your trash “news” networks actually report about Joe Biden and tell America what an awful candidate he really is, rather than covering for him and acting like the propaganda wing of the feckless
Why's everyone acting like babbling Joe Biden is already the democrat nominee for president? The Dem Convention isn't for a couple weeks so the delegates haven't voted. (they also vote on VP candidate) Enter the Dark Horse(s)?  This is 2020 after all. Be prepared for anything.
Did Joe Biden write this?
Playing electoral defense, Trump claims Biden opposes God
So its cool when I bash Trump or rip on Republicans stingy coronavirus bill, but if I point out very obvious truths about Joe Biden I'm sucking the Republican dick and asking for seconds?
Fuck Joe Biden! We want forward progress. Not someone that is going to continue to drag us backwards. We need real change.
Respectfully,  i wondering how anyone could vote for Biden aka Mr. MAGOO
OMG campaign videos use altered images and take snipets out of context to make their opponent look bad?!?! Since when? Oh right, since FOREVER IN POLITICS  "Trump campaign ad against Joe Biden contains a number of doctored images, CNN and WaPo report"
So biden never said interracial schooling would create a racial jungle he doesn't want his kids a part of?
If I had to pick, I'd say option A. But we can have both with Biden.
The Ds best choice to defeat Trump was running a literally flaming bag of dog shit. Landslide victory.   Instead youre running Biden
It is what it is .. and Biden Is more and more confused and getting worse right before our eyes everyday .
DLT still thinks Democrats are the enemy...he will NEVER be able to unite our country.  President Biden will be president of ALL Americans. #DumpTrump
Witness says idea of prosecuting Flynn was Comey's, not Biden's
No one wants to watch 4 and a half hours of pretty much "Biden 2020" signs in their face all day.  If they say its anything other than that they're full of crap.
Why aren't Obama and Biden indicted for their crimes?
I hope  isn't taking a page out of the  playbook.
....right “now”..... and this is exhausting.  But come hell or high water I plan to vote for Biden in November!!!  Any takers?
But he is fine and Joe Biden is in decline.

And now I understand your supporting Biden also?..Have you lost your mind?
I’m so glad Biden is not at any of these events to sniff woman and children. Another reason to keep him locked in the basement
God help us if that’s true . Americans are smart , they see trouble for our country on the horizon if they vote blue. Especially for a incompetent life long politician such as Biden.

All of Bernie's reasons to vote for Biden in one thread...  It's exactly what you'd expect. And it still really sucks.
Its going to happen or else Biden will be replaced for medical reasons
Most definitely looks like a Biden voter . She was dressed by an assistant and has know idea where she is .
I'm seeing a marketing opportunity here.   Biden branded Depend underwear.
But she’s also the only person on Biden’s list who spent part of the 1970s working construction in Fidel Castro’s Cuba with the Venceremos Brigade, a group that has organized annual trips to Cuba for young, leftist Americans for half a century.
When Karen Bass Went to Work in Castro’s Cuba In 1973, Bass, who’s now a potential Biden VP pick, traveled to Cuba with the Venceremos Brigade. “I didn’t have any illusions that the people in Cuba had the same freedoms I did,” she said.
“Don’t interfere when your opponent is destroying himself” Attributed to Bonaparte. Implemented by Biden.
If Joe Biden is smart he’ll choose you for his VP although we do need more people like you in the senate you cross examine the shit out of them witnesses lol
I hope I don't piss anyone off. But I have changed my opinion on who Joe Biden should pick as V.P. . From Kamala Haris to former Obama's national security adviser Susan Rice. If this pisses anybody off I apologize in advance.
When will Biden announce it?
There's actually a difference between liberals and leftists. Liberals are people like Biden who are more centrist than anything else. Leftists, such as myself, are what form Antifa and other such groups. I find that generalizing a group is hurtful towards 1 on 1 civil discourse.
No delay unless Biden won't debate.  3 debates no reason for democrats hiding him in cave
THIS is what’s next on the LGBTF agenda under a Biden administration. Do you want your kids doing THIS?!?!

If you didn’t vote in the primaries, you can’t be mad that Biden is the nominee
It sure is! Our President will be Joe Biden.
I believe you, person who tweets for Joe Biden. You take his cell phone and he can play with the life call alert necklace.

Action.  Obama was intimidated by the GOP.  Biden knows their secrets and isn't gonna take any shit.
Trump and Biden locked in heated debate over which is better: “Age of Innocence” or “Ethan Frome”
It would be great if Biden made himself worth endorsing/supporting
Absolutely not. I’m of the opinion that debates will only hurt Biden, not because he is outmatched but because Trump lies as he breathes.

Bottomline: the Republican Party doesn’t have the selfrespect to run their sorry candidate for president without the support of Putin/Russia. Biden will reject all interference. Trump asked for, received, benefitted from, and rewarded help in ‘16,can’t call out Putin to this day.
Honestly, anyone who actually votes for Kanye wasn't going to get it together to vote for Biden. If it's costs him a dozen votes nationally, I'll be shocked.

Right. Because even if Biden destroys Trump you’ll find a way to spin it against him so you can blow your wad. That’s your turn on. 😉
What makes this even crazier is this.  Trump folks believe Kanye will siphon younger, disaffected black voters away from Biden.  But aren't these EXACTLY the voters they are trying to disenfranchise "with surgical precision."  You can't siphon voters you are blocking from voting.

My remark still stands. UR entitled to UR opinion. I have no problem w/people supporting #Biden. I simply find  disingenuous.
For instance, if you want Medicare 4 all, student debt relief, and police reform, one of them comes first in your mind right? They aren’t accomplished simultaneously. Trump isn’t going to do any of this. There’s at least the slightest chance Biden or Congress will.
Joe Biden insults African Americans.

“Biden loves Biden.”  First, respecting the office and our institutions does not mean that one has to respect the office-holder. Democracy means being actively involved, if only by voting.  I don’t know if Biden loves Biden, but Trump loves Trump more than he loves his Country.
2/2 The Democrats hope you’ll turn on Trump and blame HIM for ALL your troubles. But THAT’S about to BACKFIRE. Inadvertently, the Dems have STRENGTHENED Trump’s base, NOT weakened it. They know THIS is the ONLY way Biden can “win.” And now ? Mail In voting !
Who is doing this "heavy vetting" for Biden's VP? Seriously. Not so heavy
Biden needs to STOP courting white folks. He needs to secure his support among Black people and POC. We’ve seen HOW EASY it is for white folks to return to Trump without blinking a eye.
Another racist Joe Biden classic!

So it’s obvious that Biden will pick his VP before the convention.  My question is, how does he present it? In normal times you have a rally to bring them on stage, what would be the approach this year? A press release? An event?
I'm gonna take my medicine, but goddamn is biden a horrible candidate. The final 2 candidates in this election have to be the worst final 2 in history. Anyone. Literally anyone is better than the current dipshit, but Biden is the best "we've" got. One step at a time though.

I’m just sounding the alarm that Joe Biden is racist
Considering the American people were unaware of the deep state &amp; its power, Obama's attempt to illegally take the Trump campaign down,Ukraine/Biden/China $ laundering connection, Congress being spied on by our Intel agencies, then yes.  If Trump wasn't POTUS we'd be communists.
If you don’t vote for Biden, you are voting for Trump.
Does this mean in reality Biden is doing better than the average poll and higher quality polls are better at detecting this reality or could it mean there is a bias that is somehow coordinated with your pollster rankings?

My husband has a stutter &amp; does EXACTLY what Biden does when he's trying not to stutter. He misuses or looks to forget simple words when he tries to suppress a stutter. It ends up coming out all wrong, sometimes confusing people who don't know about his stutter.

You and your collaborators are the wolves in sheep's clothing that Jesus warned us about. You obviously have balls the size of China to come out and call Joe Biden godless. Take a good look in the mirror!
Females are today's best leaders. Notwithstanding the attacks will be fierce when Biden’s running mate is announced. Her "tone" will be scrutinized by male pigs and the sexism-enabling media. This old white male is sick of this CRAP! Bring it on SISTER! Save us from male A-holes.

This freak out about Kanye is stupid af. Like find something legitimate to worry about like Joe Biden making racist comments and not supporting medicare for all something supported overwhelmingly by democrats and independents and even half of republicans.
ONLY BIDEN SAID HE WOULD NOT ACCEPT FOREIGN HELP  TRUMP IS ALREADY ACCEPTING HELP FROM RUSSIA
Maybe, it's to counteract any (MSNBC) media narratives of "radical left takeover" when Biden announces Warren as VP? Otherwise, I got nothing...
Prediction thread: stake your claim!  How many days until Biden publicly says his next racist statement and/or verbal gaffe?
Yeah.  That writer has personal animus towards Biden, for whatever reason.  In the spring she went off on him on the Chris Hayes Show over the now totally debunked Tara Reade Hoax, as if she had 100% certainty of the nominee's guilt.
LOL JOE BIDEN SAID IT!
I have it on good sourcing that Trump paid Russia to give Joe Biden a lobotomy back in 2017.

Shut up and win the election is a great name for a book on the 2020 race between Trump and Biden
It was awful.  Two guys behind the counter and this older woman yucking it up about how old Biden is.  They called him Sleepy Joe, I said at least he’s not racist Trump.  Imagine thinking your customers want to hear that crap.
Biden must be starting to slip in polling and in the minds of people operating behind closed doors.  Here comes the Russia monster! LOL
Idiot  If you don't vote Biden then you're voting for Trump. How stupid can you be to even consider letting that happen. Agreed on VP issue but c'mon! It' CommaLa btw.
It’s so sad to say this but the best thing Biden can do for Black and Latinx communities is shut up and just win the election.
Yeah it was Russia that made Joe Biden say there isn’t much diversity of thought in the African American community
You are 100% in the wrong of using religion as a prop for your pathetic re-election attempts against Joe Biden. It will fire back and make you as desperate as a snake crossing over a 4 lane highway getting to the other side safely. HUGE MISTAKE.
Excuse me but, it worked. I do not support it but think about the # of people that actually follow up on the Kanye for pres story! Kanye West is guaranteed to be a write-in for some voters. Kanye West Indicates That His Spoiler Campaign...via
Where tf is Biden’s VP 😭
I’d camp outside to vote for him and I am not even a Biden Stan.
Does that indicate some missed bias on your part or are these polls more accurately picking up on a Biden lead?
yeah, and he said, "Hi my name is Joe Biden and I'm running to get your vote for V.P. this November."
Can they elect literally anyone? Biden is only up 3 nationwide in a couple recent polls and that was BEFORE he went on his ramblings about cocaine and elephants.
Can people stop asking if I'd wait in line for 8 hours to vote for Biden? We fucking get it.  Yes.  Who are you even asking and what's your actual G goddamned point?  That's rhetorical. I understand. But damn
The latest with Biden is we might lose our savings. Hopefully, this is enough to convince people he is not worth voting for.
I mean, Biden is slipping in polls
Joe Rogan keeps raising doubts about Joe Biden's mental acuity
Joe did not clarify. His staff black pedaled Biden’s racist remarks.
I love that Joe Biden doesn’t support the Hyde amendment.   It’s awful policy that reiterates to poor, predominantly women of color, that they have less bodily autonomy, simply bc of their healthcare.   Also, donating to  now, in your name
And how demeaning will it be to give a Black woman the job of cleaning up the huge mess made by white men? Most of it will need to be handled by the VP...b/c Biden isn't skilled enough to do it on his own. Guess who can clean this up w hands tied behind her back? Elizabeth Warren
trump is a white nationalist racist. Biden is better.
That’s putting it mildly.  I’m glad he’s finally showing up Biden’s moral compass.  He hides behind his “good ol’ Catholic school boy” mantra when he’s a bureaucratic piece of dirt on record.
The market will also crash because corporations will freak out if and when Biden wins. The gravy train will be over &amp; I expect billionaires to have a huge temper tantrum.
"[dem] voters will forgive Biden’s latest racist remarks—as they’ve forgiven him for everything else, like, say Tara Reade—because they must rationalize that this election is so important that if you demand Biden be held accountable, you must want another four years of Trump"

Only reason Biden wants to pick a black woman as VP is so he can blame racism and sexism if he loses
If Joe Biden wants my vote he must agree to personally strangle thirteen lifelong Democratic voters of my choosing to death.
Nah, there’s plenty of ways Biden’s platform is to the right of Hillary’s.
Well actually it was the FDA and CDC who fucked this thing up royally, I can't imagine the FDA would have approved MORE tests in the early stages of the virus had Biden been in office
Half is an exaggeration. Had he made even one of countless Biden statements or actions, they’d lock Bernie away and toss the key.
Then Black woman VP will get blamed for every new racially insensitive comment from Biden.
What were the numbers?  Biden still slipping?
Someone should run political ads “Not going to vote because you thing Biden is going to win? Vote anyway, every vote humiliates Trump more and there’s nothing he like less then that.”
If Bernie Sanders said half the things Joe Biden does, he’d be lucky to get life without parole.
Delusional to even think that, Biden no one wants a individual who Has a touchy feely syndrome of children.
We need to #MAGA2020 - hope this is correct. Any #MAGAts at this point in the orange anus mouth's disgraceful period as their leader need to seek another country. Perhaps N. Korea or Russia where their values are similar.
Yeah Biden’s stances are not reflective of our views in most cases, but I guess I’m seeing past him as president and trusting that congress and the Supreme Court can implement MAJOR revisions to presidency as we know it today. Trump exploited every possible power trip he could
‘Sit down’: Trump buried in mockery and scorn for claiming Biden ‘no longer worthy of the Black Vote’ #SmartNews
So basically what you’re telling me is, Biden is racist but trump is not👀... fuck that I am still voting Biden, I simply don’t like trump and his kkk administration.
"so he’s not gonna raise billionaire’s taxes"?  Sounds like you don't know what "facts" and "research" are either.
This question is sincere, but can I ask why you have decided to not vote for Biden? I am voting for him begrudgingly despite him being an awful choice, but for me personally it's better than more Trump. Just curious.
Trump campaign ad manipulates three images to put Biden in a ‘basement’ - The Washington Post
This election seems less about representing the “right” positions, more who gets to them “first” and markets better. Biden wants to open schools, but Americans (by &amp; large) associate Trump with “OPEN THE SCHOOLS”. Trump says “MASKS” but we mostly associate Dems with that message.
I truthfully believe once Biden is in office, EVERYTHING is going to change, and not on Biden’s initiative, but Congress. They’re going to want to safeguard the presidency to never get as close to a dictatorship as it has with Trump in office. I foresee several amendments coming.
I see. But wouldn't almost all the concerns that applies to Biden with regards to age and health conditions also apply to Sanders. Also, I think Bernie made a lot of errors during the primary and his loss was not the result of only an unfair primary.
It’s also just #Gaslighting and the EO will be held up in litigation until  is kicked to the curb. After this, President Biden can just write another EO eliminating this one. It’s all a shell game and a con. Always for  Case in point
Biden can do and get away with it. This is how Biden knows he got the black vote.

I think that Trump could plausibly lose, but it would not be because of Joe Biden or anything Biden has done.
My advice to the black community, Joe Biden needs your vote, tell him you will forgive him if he gives you (insert  demand). Politics 101, when you have political power use it
Rs don’t “care” about deficits. They care about power. They’ve decided NOT to bet on #Spanky’s re-election - this is to make Biden’s economy as bad as possible. Just like 2008 for Obama. They make $$ off being oppositional.
Here's the point you aren't getting. So #Biden attends Church &amp; you judge him to be sincere - fine. You say Trump isn't sincere - fine.  1/X
Especially once blacks get to know the real Joe Biden:
lol, you going by hearsay but ignoring Biden voting against desegregation and didn’t what his kids going to school with black kids. Yet you ignore Trump doing the most for blacks than president ever
We need to put equal effort into flooding Biden's tweets with positive reinforcement as we do with confronting republicans' tweets. There is a great disparity, republicans are flooding Biden as we do tRump and it is negatively influencing potential voters.
I can’t follow the reasoning because Trump is only focused on his own agenda. We have proof of the horrible job he’s done over the last 4 years, it won’t get better in the next 4. Biden will be bullied by actually progressives in offices to push forth issues we need seen.
WE NEED A LANDSLIDE (FOR BIDEN)
Good call! Biden will listen to his team as opposed to Trump. We all might dislike Biden, but we have to trust that those filling other positions in office will actually have influence in issues that were actually concerned with whereas Trump is only worried about his own agenda
Joe Biden - faith.
He took the cognitive test&amp;passed!! Biden has yet to take it. BTW  IQ is one of the highest of all POTUS' to date. #Facts Matter Biden thinks Blacks ain't Black if they vote other tan Democrat. Biden also thinks Blacks all think the same. No problem there? GTHO!!
got anything to add to Kayne West saying his sole purpose in this election to help Biden lose? Because you were roasting people left n right the day he announced his candidacy
This is pretty much the only logical explanation for voting biden I’ve ever seen. When it’s all “he’s not trump” that doesn’t reassure me of anything. I don’t know if I can pull myself to continue contributing to an organization that appears to neglect the people. But compelling!
Get specific please. Have you read Biden’s plans??? Go online and read them then get back to us on where we can read Trumps plans laid out like Biden’s.
I sure hope this is wrong. AOC is the future. Her being excluded will discourage young people from voting for Biden.

Classic racist Joe Biden.
Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden says he will not stand in the way of prosecution against President Trump from the Justice Department if he is elected.
Saw some opinion article where they said they would wait and see who Biden's V.P. pick would be before deciding. I was prepared to vote for a toothpick to be president. I don't know how any Dem V.P. could drag the ticket.
Daily reminder that Joe Biden would be be 78 when inaugurated, is clearly not all there, and his potential Vice President is being chosen based on gender and race
Why? So he can steal 11 votes away from Biden?
You presume that, because I criticize Biden, I support Trump?!? 🤣🤣🤣  Please try to widen your scope a little bit!!!  I DESPISE DONALD JOHN TRUMP AND WISH FOR HIM TO BE BANISHED FROM SOCIETY  …which is why I'm so angry at the DNC for pushing Biden as the nominee!!!

Well, my voting life includes Lieberman, Cheney, Edwards, Biden, Palin, Ryan, Kaine, &amp; Pence.  I think Palin was the worst pick of that group overall.
What is wrong with Mike Emanuel! Joe Biden is NOT a practicing Catholic. The man can't even spell the word Catholic, let alone follow the teachings of the Church. Shame, shame, shame on you Mike Emanuel!☹️

Yesterday I made the mistake of telling people on my Instagram that Biden is a racist not a Trump level racist but a racist none the less. We can't make excuses for his behavior because he's not as bad a Trump.
Biden's brain is drained of any&amp;all logical thinking,no problem solving abilities left!! Dem leaders should be charged for elderly abuse!!
Joe Biden will need to be kept under constant pressure  if we hope to see justice for what the Republicans have done the past four years as well as making any advance on climate change, healthcare, racist policing, et al. Returning to the status quo is not acceptable!
Not at all saying that I like the alternative, but no one should be able to say that they are comfortable with Biden as President...he just isn’t with it enough anymore
Maybe, but I'm not so sure about that. Will the "moderate" independents be comfortable voting for a Progressive like Sanders and Warren? Part of Biden's appeal is his relative "moderation" in comparison with the other Dems.
joe biden’s campaign and joe kennedy’s are exactly the same i see
Aug 6 - part 2  V - OH Gov DeWine tests positive before meeting with Trump. Then tests negative....hmmmm BTB - Thighland. Biden hurts God. CV -  Michelle Obama says she’s depressed...welcome to the Club  EL - Pelosi, Schumer write to Postmaster General DC - still no deal
My true thought is the Dems are too far down the road with Biden.  I believe he will be "Epsteined".  Causing a "feel sorry" movement while plugging Hillary back in.  I truly believe this may already be being planned.
Have you considered doing some funny lip synching videos to Joe Biden lines to draw attention to the humour of the situation?
If anything good comes out of a Biden presidency it will be because massive movements of American people persist in protests and activism.
Because Biden said blacks are monoliths. And this isn’t his first bleating.
I actually respect Brett a lot and like to hear his perspective on things (although I disagree with a lot of his politics). It's just that at this point in time, replacing Biden is no more than wishful thinking.
Karl Rove is ready to give Biden a chance real soon, imho. #FoxNews
Can't wait to see the post "KKK officially endorses Biden for president" LMAO
Biden should be committed. #FoxNews #Biden2020🤡
Well, most "Not Trump" people will probably vote for Biden. So it's essentially the same thing.
Please don’t criticize so strongly that people might question their choice of Biden.  That being said, I think you’re awesome and love your appearances on msnbc.
Everything will stop if Biden is elected.
Biden Lies About Arrests to Appear Cooler to the Libs  #Democrats #liars

I wouldn't be surprised if she Votes for Biden on the down low and she just doesn't want to announce it publicly.
I will say it right out. I am a former Republican (until Bernie 2016), I can't stand Biden. I think he is a bad candidate  At this moment in time, there is a fundamental right and wrong with limited choices Voting for Biden is the right thing to do Sorry I can't be more upbeat

Biden: "I'll announce my VP pick by the end of the first week of August."  Political Twitter at 12:00 on Friday, August 7th:
Trump claims that Biden's America will be so bad that even Trump will be president.
Oh that’s where he got the inspiration for the crime bill?   Trump’s comments are always absurd. Not sure why there’s a need from Biden to highlight his religion despite the critique. Not like it persuaded any Trump voters to perhaps consider Joe’s religious inspirations.
I stand with Joe Biden.
Here's evidence of "Jim Crow" Joe Biden on his true views on black and hispanic people:

Petition to officially make Joe Biden’s official campaign theme song the entire “Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat” soundtrack
Impugning faith has long been in Trump’s playbook, but Biden won’t let it slide
I can't conceive of it.  That said, even though he wasn't my 1st (or 2nd, or 3rd) choice, I'm not sure Joe Biden isn't the right person for this time, but I think most of his advisors, donors, and hangers-on are doing the country, him, and his potential running mates harm.

Then there's the real Joe Biden exposed:
Same!  I am still voting for Joe Biden!
Bear in mind that there's a good chance that Biden's VP will face primary challenges in 2024.  I'm sure that Harris or Rice will do a fine job as VP or President until then, and then we can choose from among a robust field of candidates without having to worry about Trump.
And before Biden was senile he was just plain evil:
Biden can pronounce the names of all our National parks, so...

With all due respect, I think you are very wrong on this one. It's too late now to change the nominee. Also, Biden being ahead in the polls make it more difficult to replace him.
Are we going to find out Biden's VP pick on a Friday afternoon or does his definition of "first week of August" differ from most other people?
'I Don't Need A Cognitive Test!' Biden Screams At Pigeon  via
To suggest that Black people who were not going to for Trump will suddenly vote for him because Biden said they are a monolith is insulting to the intelligence of Black people. Black people are capable of making political decisions beyond statements &amp; gaffes.
Classic Joe Biden. Dude's literally senile.
Remember when Beto’s endorsement in Dallas helped Joe Biden win in the Texas primary this past year? Good memories.
Sadly, I have. And I am in no way saying Biden is worse at this stuff than Trump. I am saying that Biden has never been a great public speaker, and has lately become a much WORSE public speaker. A hedgehog in a red hat would be better at public speaking than Trump!
Joe Biden says he will support China over the US. Wtf!
I hate everyone of you who think that Joe Biden and Donald Trump are our best choices. You’re terrible and uninspiring. You lack a sack.
Many of my Dem friends aren't going to vote for Biden. They're either voting Green Party or voting for Trump. Joe Biden is literally senile.
I'm a reformed Dem who's  voting for Trump. Joe Biden is literally senile. Trump will handle the economy better. Biden will destroy our economy.
The fact is Joe Biden, you said, you meant it otherwise you would not have said it. You have other news worthy comments you made over 48 years of government service that verifies your thoughts.
Joe Biden is literally senile. He's not even well enough to attend the Dem convention. He just insulted the black commmunity and then doubled down on it. Joe Biden is non compos mentis, and the DNC knows it. Joe Hiden isn't fooling anybody, and neither is the DNC. Replace Biden!

Joe Biden is a disaster. He needs to step down and let the DNC put forth a candidate with a true chance. Biden is killing himself, and the Dem Party.
I say the decision of whether to vote for Biden is not worth tearing your hair out over. I get that feeling, but do what feels right and just know you won’t be the reason he wins or loses, and remember his win wouldn’t solve everything. Focus on the other work to be done.
I LOVE how much baggage Biden’s VP candidates have.  WaPo is already calling people sexist for pointing it out.
See - you keep saying I am/was attacking Biden - I will state my CONCERN one last time - I honestly don’t believe he will make it through his first term because of his health - I HOPE HE DOES - if that makes you feel better -
I love how conservatives argued throughout the primary that only Biden would get their votes in November and now that they got Biden, they're arguing they'll only vote for him if they get the VP they want too. No, this isn't your party.   #bidenwarren2020

Cicero would have written an essay in the NRO’s never Trump issue in 2016, then written one endorsing him in the Atlantic in 2020, rather than the radical left represented by Biden.

Ron. I know Trump is far from perfect but he’s not patronizing or racist. From now until the election I think criticizing him will only help Biden.

Joe Biden can't even get out of his basement to attend the Dem convention. He can't debate-- he'll be crushed. He's that mentally ill. Joe Biden is unfit to run for Prez.

And the “fact” Biden has “won” those dreaded debates is appalling in itself. Even the leftist leadership are complete sell out cowards! RNC tried to do that with us by selecting Jeb Bush— how did that worked out? 😂
I know you're not dumb, so you fully realize that these people want a "backfire" to hit Joe Biden. "Backfire" on the Democrats is a feature, not a bug, for ANTIFA. Trump/MAGA is utterly irrelevant to them. Only stopping "neoliberalism" matters to them.

Biden is the biggest racist in politics and he’s being given a red carpet to presidency by the Democratic Party. &amp; y’all are okay with this?

The last year and a half, many people have been naming Wisconsin as the crucial, most likely  "tipping point" state, just to the right of Pennsylvania.  Well, now both 538 and the Economist have WI a bit more Biden friendly than PA. Gotta say:
No, he’s not. The progressive movement is gaining traction. If he picks a moderate and they govern like one after COVID it will be an open race in 2024 (if Biden only does one term of course)
Young voters aren’t going to turn out for Biden
And now Joe Biden is literally senile. Joe Biden would destroy our country.
Joe Biden doesn’t like black people
Biden doesn't need to beat Trump when Trump is doing a fine job of beating himself.
"he has a track record of working for the interests of Black Americans throughout his career" Which interests are those please enumerate them the way them against the damage Biden has done to black interests
Biden VP pick today? Who’s your horse?
Truth! Joe Biden sucks!
All I have to say about choosen a leader in this year voting is look at the last four years of CHAOS, CONFUSION and DIVISION under our CURRENT OCCUPANT in the White House and ask yourself how much more INSANITY and Misery can we take. Trump said it. I ask you vote Biden what do
I'm a foremer Dem who'll vote for Trump in Nov. Obama-Biden's failures got Trump elected. Now, we're better off.
Haha I was worried it was related to Biden in some way. I am in the -Biden is trash but I still feel inclined to vote for the trash bin instead of the dumpster fire- group. But yes DnD sessions give me hours of escape where I can fight back against oppressive regimes w/ fireballs
Biden &amp; his record is awful  The argument I saw from a Black woman in support of Biden is he was a Black man's VP, took orders from that Black man &amp; that is especially appreciated by Black people who have been disrespected by whites all their lives  Understandable but not Praxis
...data.   Now, whether Biden will clarify towards something like that is up for debate. That's generally how I took the statement.
I know I'm in a minority here, but I think both are reactively innocuous. Is Biden's worse, yes.   But if someone said, "the polling data from hispanics is far more variable than other minority communities," Id consider that relatively benign of a statement (assuming there's)...
Joe Biden is literally senile.

My own experience polling Texas voters.  I have only two Kayne voters who when I told them he would not be on the Texas ballot said they would vote for Biden.  The rest all vote for Trump &amp; a few say they will write him in.  I am NOT seeing Kanye/Biden voters.
Is Mr Biden allowed out of his house today?
You’re f-ing yourself by not voting for Biden. He may not be the best but anything is better than Trump.
Impossible to find a more senile, clueless loser than Joe Biden.
That’s bullshit, we’re all voting for BIDEN!!!
Joe Biden would destroy America.
No doubt about it, Joe Biden is literally senile!
Joe Biden is no friend of the black community. Never has been. Biden needs to drop out of the race. He. Just. Sucks.
lol Anna Navarro - renowned race baiting team Obama member will fit in nicely with team Biden
Joe Biden is a racist and an imbecile.
2/ Biden was my next-to-last choice in the primary. But I’ve also been impressed how he’s used task forces bringing people across the D spectrum together to achieve really solid consensus approaches. Especially true in my area, climate &amp; energy. Good governance strategy.
Joe Biden is literally senile.
So has everyone forgotten the secret Trump voters?  Are there secret Biden voters?  No  How do you beat Trump? By being out in public (safely)speaking to the people. Joining a protest, have policies that address the needs we have right now. Not having Republicans join your team
I don't listen to Trump bullshit, he's an idiot. But Biden is actually saying these things. He's an old white guy telling black people they ain't black, and now aren't diverse of thought. I remember him in the 70s and 80s. He's a racist.
Tara Reade has accused Biden of sexual assault and many people back up her story. Biden is total scum. And now he's literally senile.
Biden not only has a website but decades of public service showing where he stands and how he will govern. (You might not want to hear it, but cf Trump’s decades of lying &amp; gritting.) ½
Joe Biden was in Congress 47 yrs and achieved nothing except enrich himself. Biden is a total loser. And now he's literally senile.
i am somewhat in this camp as well. Biden is not going to make it 4 years either. he’s clearly in complete cognitive meltdown. that means whoever is VP will be open to a primary challenge in 2024 &amp; i think by then its highly probable we can mount a powerful progressive challenge
Biden is under criminal investigation in the Ukraine.
Biden is so senile he can't even make it to the Dem convention. He needs to drop out.
Joe Biden is literally senile. He' scan't even go out of his own house without aid and handlers. He's literally senile.

Agree, no way Biden has any genuine remorse for his remark. Joe Biden is literally senile. And he's a racist!
god-damn nerve of  idiots to suggest  a legitimate Lawyer &amp; Legislator as rambling. Lets review Trump and Biden back 20yrs, you will find uneducated-Trump's attempt at syntax to be a perfected art of delivering ¶Paragraphs of nonsense &amp; vagaries! Get real!

Joe Biden is literally senile. And he's a racist!
Trump is basically say that Joe Biden will cower to the left and forget his values and put his real values to the side I think trump knows joe is a devote catholic but will pander so the democrats can take power. That’s all they really care about.
Trump is exaggerating. Biden just keeps the Ultimate Nullifier handy in case Galactus shows up.
Agree with you, Michael. Joe Biden has never achieved anything in his 47 yrs in Congress except enrich himself. Now, he's literally senile. Joe Biden is a disaster.
Georgia and Texas are a toss up not because of Biden or the "president." They are a toss up because Black and Latinx folks have been working their ass off to build progressive infrastructure for a decade.     Let's make sure no one ever forgets that.

Biden was never worthy of the Black vote but sadly he'll get it any way  But none of that means you're worthy of anything other than Black voters Ire
My “favorite” things about this: -Trump admits that Biden was more worth of black Americans’ votes  -Trump implies that now HE is worthy -Trump speaks as if he/Biden decides who black Americans vote for lmfao
What’s your point? That Biden should have selected a running mate earlier?  There’s almost 3 months to go. Plenty of time to “take control” of the narrative. Many candidates peak too soon. I don’t think the Biden campaign has peaked yet, and that’s a good thing.
Biden is a pretty damn conservative Democrat.
Joe Biden poses with his concept of black Americans:
People criticizing Trump for his “black vote” tweet are inadvertently confirming what Biden said was incredibly racist.
Joe Biden is out of his mind!
Joe Biden insulted Blacks yesterday, calling them all the same. He's now insulted Blacks multiple times. Biden is literally senile.
“Centrist” Biden Bro Dems embrace every form of expectation-lowering. “Pragmatism,” “compromise,” austerity, etc., all under cover of being an “adult” in the “real world.”  Have they taken a look at the real world any time lately?

I'm not saying that all Biden supporters are racist, but it's clear that they're okay with supporting a racist.
Anyone who votes for biden can never call themselves a "Republican." What democrats stand for is completely opposite what conservatives do.  But hey, for what it's worth, any "Republican" that votes for biden is scummier than any liberal that does.
i also want to vote for Biden   But it all comes down to who he picks for postmaster general.
THat is AWESOME!!! Sweet Ride MR. Biden!!
An opportunity Biden is singularly incapable of seizing. The man can't get through a 15-second script read for a TV as without stumbling, slurring, or slipping. "The only thing we fear is… the thing. You know."
When Joe Biden wins, maybe RD will move to Thighland.
I don’t disagree with you on this but the shot coming out of Biden’s mouth is no better.    He’s just as bad as Trump.
Biden has two issues..Perversion &amp; taking money from China. Trump can pick one or both to fuck with him. 🍿
Lol that’s not true at all, Biden’s not nearly as far left as made out to be at times
I'm with you, Michael. Biden is a disaster.
So, even though Tara Reade has far more corroborating witnesses and evidence, you only believe Dr. Ford.  Could that plausibly be because you wanted to see Kavanaugh convicted so much more than you want to see Biden face justice?  You're a rape apologist.  That is clear.
Potus, suggestion for election ad: 2-3 short clips of Biden gaffs followed by cnversation between Biden and president Che discussing war or peace with Biden confused about difference.
I really don't care about someone's religous beliefs. But at least Biden isn't a phony.
The Biden campaign did give an apology. They literally tweeted it out.
Say what shit?  Biden Trump Those are your choices.
Trump claims Biden 'no longer worthy of the Black Vote' in wake of diversity comment
Biden is the nominee. You voting for Trump?
I see some of the American evangelicals believe attacking Biden and Catholicism is akin to patriotism and pro-life. AND a "winning for Trump" strategy. Go for it.
If you have young kids u should be so happy Trump is in office... he created  the blueprint to beat corrupt politicians. Now in the future hopefully America will have way better leaders. Better than trump. And never go back to the old Clinton, Biden circle of politicians
If only you covered the racists, dementia riddled shit Biden says on a regular basis 😂
Joe Biden phux up again! Joe Biden is literally senile.
"And by the way, what you all know, but most people don’t know, unlike the African American community, with notable exceptions, the Latino community is an incredibly diverse community with incredibly different attitudes about different things.” -Sleepy Joe Biden
Bernie would be dragged for the things that Biden says. He'd also have people wanting him in a hospital for the near obvious dementia, which is not a problem Bernie had. What a situation they've created for themselves.
I believed Dr. Ford, and I believe Tara Reade.  She's got plenty of corroborating evidence, and Biden absolutely refuses to open the records that could theoretically exonerate him...w/Biden's inability to tell the truth or respect personal boundaries.  Not hard to figure out.
Joe Biden is literally senile.
Biden would destroy our economy.
This is the future if Joe Biden is elected. No pretty.
1. i have so many questions about your religion— ... ... 9. so i take it Biden has the subtle knife, Æsahættr, the god killer? 10. and Trump stayed up all night reading His Dark Materials?
Biden blew it when he prematurely painted himself into a corner saying he would pick a woman.  Can you imagine a Biden / Cuomo ticket or one of the other Covid governor heroes who stood-up to Dumb Donnie?
Did you see the Swan interview of Trump?  It'd be like playing chess with a pigeon. Whether Biden is bad at chess or the world champion matters little of Trump will just run over the board, shit on it and declare victory.  Why waste any energy on that?
Question ; why do we listen to morons like Dr Fauci ( and the girl) moron Marty Walsh , joe Biden , Charlie Parker and the rest ? Please god tell us why ?
i cant stand to listen to biden speaking publicly, but i cant stand trump's public speaking even more
Joe Biden taps Boston Mayor Marty Walsh to lead New Hampshire economic roundtable, fueling Cabinet speculation. Walsh will host group of N.H. leaders &amp; small biz owners to talk about 1st plank of Biden's “Build Back Better” economic plan, “Made in America"
It is to Biden.
Also last I checked Biden's last job was to support and ensure the application of the FIRST BLACK PRESIDENT's agenda.
Clearly Biden has no clue his campaign tweeted some sort of apology. This is who is he is now...or maybe always was and the decline shows what his nature always was.
Joe Biden could look straight into a camera and call black people inferior and people at      would try to cover for him. That's where we're at.
The ONLY way Joe Biden wins is by fraud!  That does worry me knowing how evil these Democrats are!!!
This is the only way someone should vote for Biden,  with grave reservations and the determination to push him as far left as possible
Joe Biden going all-in on this #WorseThanHillary strategy
Clinton was polling at the height of her convention bounce, though:
"Joe Biden’s presidential campaign called Trump “absolutely despicable”  for failing to challenge Putin on the allegations."  #VetsAgainstTrump
Biden campaign just constantly scoring own goals
Apparently, #JoeBiden is both "Sleepy Joe" and "The Wide Awake Wizard" because now he has the power to "hurt god" and "hurt the bible." Oh, and in his down time, he's a-comin' fer yer guns.
Trump is a pompous jerk off who loves this country. And Joe Biden is full of shit who loves power and to be loved.

They're trying to take down Biden by suggesting he's an anime protagonist. Weird choice.
If "helping" is making Biden into a better candidate &amp; President then he would ever be if left to his devices that's what I'm about  If "helping" is uncritical, unconditional support &amp; validation of Biden's godawful history &amp; present, I don't want to "help"
The problem isn’t necessarily that Biden flubs. Trump flubs, too. It’s that Biden messes up almost every single public statement, no matter how few and far between they are. It’s a matter of batting averages, and Biden’s is poor.
Biden and Obama deported millions and millions of Latinos and now he is crying because Trump is doing the same thing
No she didn't lol. Biden wants a public option. Hillary just wanted to lower the Medicare age.
Nope. Most European countries tend to have a healthcare system somewhat similar to Biden's public option, where private insurance isn't banned, but the government acts as the primary insurance provider and uses its leverage to bring down prices.
I feel like the DNC shouldn’t have forced a candidate on voters who frequently displays anti-Black racism, as recently as yesterday. Also, a reminder that if Trump wins, it’s on 2 groups of ppl &amp; 2 groups of ppl alone: 1. Trump voters, 2. Biden and the DNC
Kanye West reveals what Twitter has been suspecting ever since he announced he was running for President: He’s doing it to deliberately take votes away from Joe Biden.
M4A is not the only universal healthcare plan lol.   Most countries with universal healthcare tend to have plans similar to the public option Biden is proposing.
I hope it's either Warren or Harris. Both will help Biden fix the mess that Trump &amp; his cohorts put us in. Spill if you know....anticipation is killing me LOL 😉

No. Biden's plan involves a public option, which will be available to anyone who wants it.   It will be a government-run insurance provider, at low or no cost, funded by the taxpayer. Having this also will lower the price of private insurance because of the leverage.
There is a 0% chance that Biden wrote this or knows what the word monolith even means.
Another racist comment by Joe Biden.
Joe Biden really is SICK and  NO CURE
I’m not opposed to this, but  is a Republican. She regularly critiques policies that are mainstream for Democrats.  I don’t see Biden adding progressive voices or policies is a meaningful way.  If he wants the base to show up he needs to reach out to progressives too.
He is scraping and clawing and trying to turn any small thing on Biden into this huge scandal. He knows he is screwed
I get being upset that your candidate didn’t get the nomination.  Mine didn’t either.  But at a certain point we all need to consider how a continued Trump presidency looks for marginalized communities vs how a Biden presidency would look for those same communities.
agrees:  "[Biden] is as good a man as God ever created."
Biden is doomed. He wants to hit on the third rail of politics and use racial division as a tactic, but he doesn't understand it will kill him.
Wake up, people. The Trump supporter who has no chance of winning is “running”... to support Trump.
Remember when some Bernie stans were like ‘a vote for Biden is a vote for Trump?’.  Well, at this point, refusing to vote Biden because he’s boring and not particularly progressive is undeniably handing Trump a vote.
The irony of your statement here is not lost on us you here Champ.   You're suggesting that all African Americans are "Black Votes" because Biden suggests that African American voters have similar voting patterns   Do ya get what I'm suggesting?  #TrumpIsALaughingStock
Last time, he could tee off, because country didn’t know what he’d do as President and now Biden can tee off on him. Criticism is easy. We know trumps answers don’t work now and that he is weak and stupid.  He has too many easy targets exposed
Biden has never been the same since the Civil Rights protests he lied about participating in.
Question if the day: When will Biden literally just shut the fuck up.  Like if he just says nothing he’ll probably win the election. But this dude really just be spewin bullshit...
Is Trump saying Biden will "hurt god" and "end religion" the most desperate and pathetic attack so far?

It’s really unbelievable how much of a pass people give Biden solely based on he was Obama’s goofy VP who had funny memes. The guy has been in public office for 50 years and has done nothing for minorities besides pass bills that put them in prison by the thousands. Wake up!
Elated by response to his comments about black and Latino voters, Biden today wants to say a few things about LGBTQ and TERFs.
Republicans push Kanye 2020. But will it really hurt Biden?
Let me fix that: "Joe Biden obfuscates comments comparing diversity in Latino and Black communities"
Trump: Joe Biden is crazy for making generalizations about the Black community.   Also Trump: I alone can predict what all “the Blacks” will do.
Biden has been putting blacks in prison by the thousands since the 70s with the bills he’s written, stop kidding yourself.
If you think Biden is the better option, YOU are part of the problem! #MAGA2020 #Trump2020

Biden campaign staffers argue over which one is supposed to be watching him today.
Yes...very much so.  I'm obsessed with maps &amp; quality of polls and I'm working for Texas Democrats &amp; the Biden campaign 40+ hours a week to identify voters via texts.   Take nothing for granted.

I did. They fired back with “what about Hunter Biden!?” Theres no reasoning w MAGAts..

Who the hell planning on voting for Biden is going to switch to Kayne???
No it’s not okay, the pandemic response by the current encumbent is an utter disgrace, but remember you are not voting for one person, you are voting for the SCOTUS, for federal judgeships, for an honest DOJ, for science not to be silenced. This is about more than Biden

You do know that Joe Biden was refused Mass by a priest in the last 5 years . Biden supports abortion which runs a foul of Catholic teachings.
The people who run Joe Biden's twitter account are very, VERY sorry that he can't stop being racist AF.  So, it's all good, right?
Indeed. So, at all economic strata, you’ve got grievance-fueled Republicans riled up by Trump, primed to see a Biden win as fraudulent and primed to believe he’s against all they hold holy, FDR trappings, and little gets better. Powder keg on top of the health/econ meltdown.
How is it false?  You are just saying words without evidence. Joe Biden’s own words show he is not a follower of god as there is no god that supports killing the unborn?  What god teaches a man to support his son in denying his grandson?
We shouldn't be enjoying watching Trump's meltdown but I am. I wonder how his supporters feel about this?  ‘He’s Against God’: Trump Erupts In Delusional Rant Against Biden
8 day line. But luckily I live in state that wants me to vote so I’ll vote early and easily. And forJoe Biden
Could it matter in WI? I guess, but Biden's margins are likely going to be large enough in most states to produce a decisive outcome in both the popular and Electoral vote. Biden has many routes to 270 EVs. Not so for Trump. For instance, winning AZ's 11 EVs while losing WI's 10.
Your other option is VP Joe Biden who said yesterday, unlike African Americans, Hispanics are diverse. He also thinks poor kids are just as smart as the white ones. Biden's supports are cancel culture, anarchy, defund police, raising taxes and big govt. Forgiveness #VoteRed
He’s a black trump supporter. He can’t be THAT offended by Biden’s comments, he’s heard worse that he’s okay with.
Trumps response was “Biden just lost the entire African American community.”  This suggests they all think alike. Oh the irony!
A Trump-backed candidate won the Republican Senate primary in Tennessee. The decision to shorten the census collection period could make polls less reliable. NYT
Biden's promises:  Tax hikes = $3.4 trillion dollars over a decade, 3X more than Hillary threatened.   He'll ban fracking, plastic bags, expand Medicare w/ a “public option”  a new energy/carbon tax.   BTW moderate Dems, these are  policies.
Kudos to Marquita Bradshaw who, using little money, scored a tremendous upset victory in Tennessee's Democratic primary. She's running to win Lamar Alexander's US senate seat. Clinton, Biden, Pelosi, Schumer Democrats shocked again!
You Biden just proved you are really a true racist.
He was trolling him all night.
Trump told the press yesterday: Biden will "hurt the Bible, hurt God."
Are you sure you are talking about Biden? Not yourself?? 🤔 and I can add no equality, no inclusion, no humanity, no feelings for others needs, no RESPECT for anyone except money, no appreciation, no leader, no anything, Trump!!!!
Pbbt, Joe Biden is a trash candidate
There are many reasons I'd never vote for him, but Biden's cognitive impairment doesn't worry me as much as his racism, hawkishness, or authoritarian tendencies.  He's basically the worst kind of Republican, but since he's got a D next to his name, libs think he's all good.
Does Joe Biden posses Thor's hammer from Isengard ,? that's the only chance he has against God, And Donald Duck Trump has hurt my soul ,so it for tat
With Biden, it's the only strategy 🤦🏼‍♂️
Biden could help by promising to direct the Archivist to publish #ERA if he wins. But he refsues to make that promise, which is curious. We all criticized Trump as the bad guy for directing the Archivist NOT to publish ERA after VA ratified. Why aren’t we criticizing Biden?
Depends, if the female is a good politician with many years of experience and the opponent for instance is a useless senile paedophile like Joe Biden, then yes, why the hell not?
It won't happen with either Biden or Trump. There is no pushing Biden left. I refuse to vote for either. We need neoliberals out since they are what directly lead us to Trump.
Biden seeks to clarify comment that Latino community is diverse, ‘unlike the African American community’
Amazing that the R’s would use a mentally ill black man just to pull votes away from Biden. America needs to tell Kim that her husband is damaging her brand.
Woke up today and Trump was still president and only Joe Biden was the other option.... Dammit...i thought this was all a dream 🤦🏽‍♂️
THAT is what is going to make you consider voting for Biden?  I honestly feel that Biden is a nightmare, HOWEVER, Trump has landed us in the middle part of the Back To The Future 2 movie where Biff has the sports almanac. FAR worse than Biden.  MILES worse.
BBC News - US election 2020: Trump says opponent Biden will 'hurt God'
Lots of political risks to the market here - not just a billionaires tax.
Love u George but let's not oversell. Thats a trumper game. Biden is just lesser evil. He needs to really work on his words. He wants to court trumps ignorant base AND stay cool w/everybody else. 🙄🤷🏿
No one has Biden signs 🤣
Sure, he wants to put food on his table. Dudes a grifter.  All these "Never" Trumpers are setting up for a Biden administration. It requires equivocating now.
trump is afraid of Warren. She’s the only person in contention for VP that has a ridiculous nickname. She gets under his skin. Biden should definitely pick Warren.
It seems reasonable to expect they’d be quite agitated by a New New Deal. Of course if they got something portrayed as such under Biden it would be stingy AF.
Doesn't matter, one way or another Biden camp is getting those questions in advance. Is there really any doubt about that? Honestly though, I don't think that's gonna matter he can't keep a coherent thought straight even if he's using a script
And according to Biden they were alll exactly the same with no unique culture
Wednesday: Biden asks black journalist if he's a junkie Thursday: Biden says black people lack diversity Media:
TRUMP: "I have seen Joe Biden punch God. He punched God right in the face. So God looks at me, tears running down his face, and he says, 'Sir?' (he calls me 'Sir'). He says, 'Sir? You are so much better. You know I love people who hold the Bible upside down.'"
A part of me can’t believe that Biden’s VP pick is likely going to be a Friday news dump situation.
Joke Biden lives up to his name.
Under a Biden presidency, what impact do you see from the heightened brazenness and self-stoked grievances of Trump’s supporters?
Hasn’t Americans paid enough for Joe Biden’s political career, time to go away and retire.
Trump has nothing on Biden.  He is so inept.  Trump will be Trump’s undoing.  We need to start healing this broken country, yesterday!
What a big crap! Biden is a man of faith unlike fake ones like you and Don the Con.
And you will never “vote” for Biden. Not if a) you’re a BOT or b) a Trump supporter. If you support Trump at this point, you’re beyond hopeless.
Vote for Biden!
Joe Biden is a racist!
Just another BAD MOVE. Lies and bad moves is all he is about!  #AnotherReasonBiden2020  The people don't have TicTok That will flood Twitter &amp; Facebook and GEN Z will be dominate!  Like most things he does he is wrong. Just another  reason #Biden  From the WH to the BIG House
all blacks think some says Biden. You have no issue with that? Asking for a friend.
all blacks think alike says Biden. Not newsworthy. You would be retweeting Trump or any republican. No bias. Nope. You HACK. Be a journalist. Not a Democrat impersonating a journalist. Shame Jake.
If you think the DAPL scare is gone, you've got another thing coming. That pipe is toast is Biden wins in November.

Howard Kurtz on idea of Biden ditching debates: 'Heads would have exploded' if Trump skipped in 2016
Pay attention, America. Joe Biden is a racist. He just can’t help himself. His insults and views of African Americans are disturbing. His true feelings keep slipping out.
Don't forget that Biden actually supported segregation.
I don’t even know what to make of Trump tweeting the dumb shit Biden says...the pot calling the kettle....to bad we just can’t throw the whole thing in the barsura, start a fresh batch...
Hundreds of college students have had their lives completely ruined for saying something less offensive than Joe Biden did.
"Joe Biden contrasted" They're bending over backwards to defend Biden on this when everyone knows ANYONE else would be instantly canceled.
One of the things that has always been obvious about Joe Biden is his faith. It guides him, but doesn't rule him. #Vote
So true! Which is why no one on the left is talking about taking anyone's guns away. You said this for 8 years under Obama as a scare tactic and it never happened. Now it's the same thing with Biden. How stupid do you think people are that they'll believe this propaganda?
Trump is saying that Biden hurts God. He hates God. Biden is leaning to far to the left to the socialists. This is coming from a man who ingratiates himself to the biggest socialist on the planet...Vladimir Putin.
Have you seen the montage of Trump’s bumbling and stumbling on his words. It’s pretty pathetic!  My blood boils when Biden is made sport of.
This is such racist bs. And, Joe Biden doesn’t know a person can be Black and Latino?! I’m not surprised the left media is not reacting to this. I don’t think Democrat leaders care about actual racism (e.g. Northam). It’s all about power and control. And people fall for it. 🙄

I'm already looking forward to #Election2024. Biden gets a freebie because America needs decency, competence, respect, patriotism, ethics and CARING in WH. But his VP choice, his cabinet, his policy priorities will determine my activism in #Election2024. Simple as that. 3/
Trump said Biden 'hurt God.' Biden has spent his life drawing from his Catholic faith.
Only the beginning . How long can democrats hide that Biden is a political and medical mess ?
It's not too late to get him to drop out of the race and convince  to step in.  It would be difficult to lose to Trump in today's environment, but Biden looks like he's on the way to doing exactly that.
Biden's Game Plan -- Take No Risks &amp; Run Out the Clock: 'The left understands this (Biden's physical and mental conditions), which is why we are suddenly seeing media suggestions that Biden should cancel the debates.'
I'm voting Biden in #Election2020. Trump + enablers must go. For the rest, I predict "parties" will dramatically change in #Election2022 #Election2024 especially if Biden shows he works 1st for DEM party THEN Americans. WE, AMERICANS, are giving him opportunity to be REMARKABLE.
Actually he is. Biden is a fascist. Biden is why we have Trump.
Great slogan for the Biden campaign.  Pushing  to respond to the base and the message is  taken by the electorate is that the president is against your children's right to feel safe in their classroom.

Joe Biden hates black people. And hates gays. It’s well documented.
I don't understand how this makes sense, as an alleged part of grey tribe -- if stabilization and thus solidification of power means voting for Biden, who's an empty political vessel for the collectivist and woke Left, you'd think he'd be the worst possible choice.

You’re running for Congress never miss a chance to screw somebody over so you can get elected sounds to me like you’re playing a card you shouldn’t be Joe Biden will be a better president Trump the chump

is sick, delusional-needs mental health help ASAP. The foolishness about running 4 president is designed 2 woo voters away from Biden. Who in their right mind would vote 4 West who at the moment is not in his? We already have 1 unstable person at the helm-thats enough!
Biden shouldn’t give him the air. Trump doesn’t belong within six feet of the same stage as him.
Biden is, indeed, a man of deep state.
Can't blame 'em
This should end Joe Biden's campaign. It would for anyone else.
Ooh are you afraid that Biden might not win? Thought he was in the lead. Lol
Sure about that? Every single time Biden speaks he shows how incompetent he really is. Lol

Riding with Biden
Trump is doing so poorly this week I've got this sinking feeling Biden is gonna announce next week his VP pick is a turnip
VP Joe Biden supports government funded baby killing. His sin is blasphemy against the Holy Spirit, to remain silent or even vote for him is accepting the Mark of the Beast and complicit to his sin. Don’t be fooled and please hear the cries of the unborn by voting Pro Life.
Trump has been a national embarrassment from day 1!  It is hard to believe he would be able to undo or weaken the nation’s acquired power and influence over the past 100 years in just his first term. SAVE AMERICA-VOTE BIDEN!
ATTENTION CHRISTIANS: The Democrats support government funded baby killing, especially VP Joe Biden. Supporting Democrats is tantamount to taking the Mark of the Beast, and blasphemy against the Holy Spirit. A sin that cannot be forgiven. Vote Pro-Life or don’t vote at all.
Biden supports government funded baby killing which is Anti Christian and against Catholicism. President Trump is Pro-Life and his defunding of planned parenthood which saved thousands of new borns. As Christians/ Catholics Trump earned our votes, and Biden has not!
As much as I love Warren I could love Kamala Harris too. Especially if she can get Biden to win
Hot Take: I'm getting ready for a Biden presidency just as hard.  Giving the neo-libs even 4 years / one SCJ could codify Citizens United for the rest of the country's history. Ruling Class will still be your enemy. It will just be done in husher tones and w/ crumbs and tokenism
Vegas has Biden a 3 to 1 favorite. And 5 to 2 bet Trump will resign before October 1st!
And I do think there’s a good chance the VP will be president. Biden is 78 after all.
Keep an eye on how many racial spit takes Biden has then hope he has a good VP
Biden will hurt more than God if elected.
some of y’all are out here gaslighting people for sharing real information about your candidate‘s racist remarks &amp; it’s absolutely hilarious to me.  sweetie, Biden is grown.  to suggest that he can’t be responsible for his actions but must be responsible for a country is... lmaoRESIGN OR WE WILL REMOVE YOU. YOUR CHOICE. YOU AND  we will stop you asap. Your not doing nothing with the Russians to denigrate Joe Biden. This is Our democracy..Our Election. Not Russias. Clear enough for you Mr.Johnson?? Back off!
Intelligence officials provide details on Russian disinformation campaign against Biden: report -
You keep this in your head..I see your tweets with Russian code messages on the Denigration of Joe Biden..I will abruptly report your tweets to Twitter and see that your removed asap for damaging his campaign. Its against twitter policies. Your not doing this.
You think you and the Russians  and Ron Johnson are attempting to denigrate Joe Biden..Be careful..Americans know what your doing.. Not happening. This is not 2016.
Funny how the media will cover the story of a republican voting for Biden but somehow fails to cover the violence in Portland.   Makes you think the media has a narrative or something.
You are 100% in the wrong of using religion as a prop for your pathetic re-election attempts against Joe Biden. It will fire back and make you as desperate as a snake crossing over a 4 lane highway getting to the other side safely. HUGE MISTAKE.
Can they elect literally anyone? Biden is only up 3 nationwide in a couple recent polls and that was BEFORE he went on his ramblings about cocaine and elephants.
This election seems less about representing the “right” positions, more who gets to them “first” and markets better. Biden wants to open schools, but Americans (by &amp; large) associate Trump with “OPEN THE SCHOOLS”. Trump says “MASKS” but we mostly associate Dems with that message.
He took the cognitive test&amp;passed!! Biden has yet to take it. BTW  IQ is one of the highest of all POTUS' to date. #Facts Matter Biden thinks Blacks ain't Black if they vote other tan Democrat. Biden also thinks Blacks all think the same. No problem there? GTHO!!
Biden's brain is drained of any&amp;all logical thinking,no problem solving abilities left!! Dem leaders should be charged for elderly abuse!!
Have you considered doing some funny lip synching videos to Joe Biden lines to draw attention to the humour of the situation?
Georgia and Texas are a toss up not because of Biden or the "president." They are a toss up because Black and Latinx folks have been working their ass off to build progressive infrastructure for a decade.     Let's make sure no one ever forgets that.

. I mean C'mon Joe don't ya think its time for Donald to hit the high road..Just give it Joe Biden..Rape charges now..
WOW!!!  Joe Biden is actually racist
Hey  - go fuck yourself.    Jesus doesn't approve of your dirty, cheating tactics. And your buddy Trump is in NO WAY a man of God.  Wake up.
Absolutely- not voting for Biden is a vote for Trump. And she couldn’t even explain why she would chose Harris over Rice. This is absurd.
1) why would Harris get it and Rice not? Wouldn’t you expound on that in the article  2) a vote for anyone but Biden IS a vote FOR trump - did you not learn anything from 2016? 3) neither rice nor Harris are an imbecile Palin. Both would be fine choices
Biden is as Catholic as I'm a hooker.
This is going to make Dems look bad,everyone can see Biden is mentally declining&amp;for Dems to hang on a mentally ill man for their pick for Dem candidate for POTUS is why  will win. Dems should be charged with elder abuse of Biden! #WalkAway

You make the outlandish claim that Joe Biden doesn't believe in GOD..well..Joe didn't kill 159,000 americans. YOU DID. Joe Biden has prayed to God for the families of the dead/sick You didn't. Only evil and heartless souls like you kill 159,800 americans. Sad.
I would hesitate to call Biden devout given he is pro-choice. By some canonists figuring he might be excommunicated automatically because of his support of abortion.

It seems so deliberate at this point concerning trump, but lol even asking Biden to just do that is too much let’s be honest 🤣🤣
If he took the Biden approach and only said what was written down for him to say and was other wise stuffed in a closet till they needed him again, he’d win by a land slide. But he’s too compelled to make a complete ass of himself infront of the world.

I completely agree.  Two approaches; Biden announce he will not debate unless Trump releases his Tax Returns by September 15.  Or announce No Debates, period !  If they do debate, Biden gives short, concise answers, leave more time for Trump to make a fool of himself.
If it makes you feel better it probably doesn't matter at all since a Biden administration is committed to being terrible regardless :)
You’re right Trump is much better at destroying jobs than Biden. 20 million jobs lost in four month so far.
Too heavy-handed. Need less Biden.
Is it me or does sleepy 😴 Joe Biden always have that deer in the headlights look?
Who will be Biden's VP
1) why would Biden supporters come out to see you? 2) the clear video evidence shows a less than enthusiastic outpouring for you. Delusional. #AmericaOrTrump
Keep hiding Biden, the truth will come out soon. Mentally and physically unfit to be president. Worse off than Hillary.
it's ok Biden will pivot to the general any time now

377 million for a WH reno..I don't think you'll be needing that..not to mention Its the peoples house..not yours..and the unemplyed and americans get their money before any reno pal..Joe Biden will take care of that..Remember you have already lost...
I agree, no debates unless Trump releases tax returns by September 15.  Biden doesn’t need the debates.

Biden is going to need trusted people in every nook and cranny of our Government at noon on January 20, 2021 to make sure all Trumpers are eradicated.
The whole 2020 voting patterns is strange Biden is winning older voters but Trump has way higher amounts of minority voters than most Republicans
If you vote for Biden, you vote for socialism/communism. You vote for the end of our country as you know it.
a couple of questions you might address in your Podcast; Should Biden debate Trump ?  I say NO.  Give Trump a September 15 deadline to release his tax returns, else no debates.  Second, should Biden commit to being a One Term President ?
So uh has Biden explained his plan for ameliorating the imminent mass homelessness and rampant unemployment or

Didn't your old man give a shout out to Epstein's pedophile girlfriend last week? And while no big fan of tricky Bill, I've seen more photos of your old man the President with Epstein than almost anyone. You know who I've never seen with Epstein- the next president Biden.
Like the Democrats and bumbling Biden could do any better? Give your head a shake.
Biden may not be my choice, but he’ll get my vote! Our country is a mess and our 401K has already gone down!
I’m beside myself about what Trump’s doing to our Country.  This next 90+ days are going to drive me nuts.  And Trump better lose, I can’t take much more of this.  Nice to see so many rational Republicans coming on board to support Biden.

Anyone buying and wearing Biden merch from a Biden dark money front probably isn't as ambivalent about Joe Biden as they claim.
lol how did they not pick Biden's running mate around the same time they decided to put the fix in for him
The Dems have no message, instead Biden is stealing POTUS' message(s). The bring the fear mongers,domestic terrorists:BLM,Antifa hoping to scare Americans in to caving to their demands. They use race baiting,name calling. This is why Trump won&amp;will again!!
Val Demings is high on my list. No VP candidates are perfect. If not VD for Biden’s VP, then certainly for another position in Biden’s Cabinet. Of course I feel similarly about Biden’s other women candidates. They are all intelligent, accomplished, flexible &amp; good women 💛👍🍀🤞
I mean, the pictures of Joe Biden kneeling, with a mask, all sunny around him, outstretching his hands to grace a Black child. It's fuckin' "I'm your savior" propaganda. If he were a little more religiously based, he would probably pass himself off as the second Christ.
It won't be dangerous in Biden's America,  it's dangerous in Trump's America right now....

Alright cool, but if they impeach him, isn't it gonna be pence vs Biden?
Trumpism is dangerous - it’s illiberal, antithetical to conservatism and anti-intellectual at its core. Biden/Rice is the most competent ticket. Keep in mind I’m not wild about Dem economic policy - it will literally hit me in the wallet- Trumpism is THAT dangerous. End
I support Joe Biden because he, for all his faults, puts us back on the path to normalcy. Where policy debates matter and thus populist, nationalist, isolationist Trumpism is repudiated. Bring out a Paul Ryan or Ben Sasse in 2024. 2/
He’s already doing it. A tight 20-minute Rally speech at Texas Oil.  High energy. Concise.  I don’t know about August, but whoever gets the earlier start sets the table. I suspect Biden will drop his VP this week(?) and start the engines for, as the kids say, realsies.  Buckle up
What’s on? The Election?  If Biden makes a splash with his already-later-than-Hillary-did-it-in-2016 VP announcement, Trump will have to keep up amid the hype.

Sometimes you subsume your interest so much that it doesn't get you reelected when it's your turn to steer the ship. Right,     Biden did it too, big guy.
I know who I’m voting for, don’t believe you understand who you’re voting for though. If you look at the bills put forth by Biden before VP he isn’t for the American people he’s for Biden’s wallet
Yea Biden’s been accused by numerous women too but the main difference is there’s actual proof of Biden, and it’s clear as day the corruption within that man. Who also freely threw the N word around during senate hearings. Full blown racist! But hey yea have fun with the election
So many good candidates. And we are poised to have Biden and Kamala. Not surprised we are gonna have Trump for another 4 years ......
I was talking about Biden the actual pedofile, Trump has signed more executive orders than any other president to protect children and prevent sex trafficking to the point where he declared January prevention of human trafficking month. Do some research outside the fake news!

Please #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica2020
tells us the media is liking Biden again and mentions all of his gaffes and knotty points but doesn't even touch on the obvious.  Biden is in the early stages of dementia.  #truth
I swear Joe Biden needs to pick a VP like several weeks ago so all of this can end!!
hot take: Tlaib having and demonstrating good political beliefs is probably good for turnout in her district so this probably helps Biden more than a humiliating demoralizing Sanders style capitulation would
that's going to happen to some degree, and it's gonna suck, but I can't imagine Biden being as effective in that role as Obama or Trudeau. There's no Bidenmania outside of dark and twisted CAP twitter and the current protesters don't view him as any kind of ally or leader.
You are a moron from A to Z.. Your secret agents were sent packing today...So please cut the dictator crap..knock it off..Is this supposed to impress your cult followers to vote for you..Your loosing so bad to Biden..US marshalls will drag you out Nov 4th..or be a man and leave
If Biden is our next president, the four loudmouths will be running the country.
There's a lot going on but it seems fucked up for a Joe Biden outfit to do a meme calling a woman a fucking bitch. I know the reference, and if she wanted to appropriate phrase fine, but otherwise this feels gross.
It should be unbelievable but after four years of lunacy, it's sadly not. #Biden
Not in Joe Biden’s America
#donoharm #vppick as #Hillary did is #AMISTAKE #Biden be bold enough to pick a younger woman who is unafraid to speak her mind. Not withstanding the #fiasco of #sarahpallin this is different. Biden will be a one term president and the vp pick must be able to take over right now!Bottomline: the Republican Party doesn’t have the selfrespect to run their sorry candidate for president without the support of Putin/Russia. Biden will reject all interference. Trump asked for, received, benefitted from, and rewarded help in ‘16,can’t call out Putin to this day.

Biden doesn't need to beat Trump when Trump is doing a fine job of beating himself.
2/ Biden was my next-to-last choice in the primary. But I’ve also been impressed how he’s used task forces bringing people across the D spectrum together to achieve really solid consensus approaches. Especially true in my area, climate &amp; energy. Good governance strategy.

Could it matter in WI? I guess, but Biden's margins are likely going to be large enough in most states to produce a decisive outcome in both the popular and Electoral vote. Biden has many routes to 270 EVs. Not so for Trump. For instance, winning AZ's 11 EVs while losing WI's 10.

Biden is portrayed as a familiar face and reliable statesman in contrast with the volatile Trump. In reality, he promises to be the most liberal president in history, writes
I'd have to look up his exact words, but yes, Biden was saying it was safe to vote in person in WI at the same time Sanders was saying it wasn't. Sanders bowed out of the race after the WI primary but before results were announced.
Biden said “you know I’m less racist vote for me”
Well, I guess that tells me all I need to know about you.  You will cast a vote for DJT, the most corrupt and incompetent president in history, directly or by default if you don't like Biden's VP pick among 4 highly competent black women.
Akin to the over emotional Bernie people trashing Biden a few months ago...
It is just people liking   and other (mostly men) shilling for their preferred candidate.  For me, I will back whatever candidate Biden chooses without reservation.  DJT and company will brutalize whichever person Biden chooses.
What a joke  In every aspect of being human &amp; a leader, Joe Biden is objectively vastly superior to your corrupt, cruel, lazy moronic boss  There is NO case to be made for trump over Biden. The only question is will your side succeed in stealing the election  #GOPTraitors
What is a vote for Joe Biden?
Compared to Trump, Biden is the son Cicero and Thomas Jefferson never had.
is this by joe biden? the one who wants to ban the suburbs
Except he’s trying to take Biden down by saying the same kind of shit means he’s senile.
Okay, at any rate, I think Big Gretch, while she may not be the *best* pick, is likely a *good* pick -- and certainly a *reasonable* pick.  I'm voting for Biden regardless, and I'd be happy if Biden picked Big Gretch.  9/8
And I think for Joe Biden being able to listen to the perspective of an African-American VP -- and how she feels about things (e.g., "You ain't black") -- would be of tremendous value to a Biden Presidency.  So that's where I am.  8/8
That Joe Biden would pick the first African-American woman to be on a major party ticket will only add to his moral authority over the incumbent.  6/
It's an incredible contrast to the current whiner-in-Chief.  Further, Joe Biden gained an incredibly moral authority by for eight years as VP defending our nation's first black President (which also did not have a single scandal).  5/
Joe Biden is running for President to restore the moral authority in the office of the Presidency.  He has experienced the kinds of unimaginable family tragedies that would have caused many to give up long ago.  Yet he hasn't, and even remains in good spirits.  4/
Honestly, I've always felt Biden is best off picking an African-American woman.  And I don't think there's any way around that.  3/
My fav fantasy: Biden's DOJ gets back from trump every single taxpayer dollar he's spent campaigning illegally on our dime
Don’t dismiss this: Donald Trump will win again if 1) we don’t rally others to vote &amp; 2) Joe Biden doesn’t get his shit together.   Remember all the crazy shit Trump said &amp; he still beat Hillary? People said it wouldn’t happen. They’re saying it now. It did &amp; it may again.   VOTE
My dream for the 2020 election is for Joe Biden to use the phrase and acknowledge environmental racism.
While we're evaluating the Presidential response, think about what the response would look like if we had Biden in the WH. #BidenCoalition #COVID19
Just saw his Hunter Biden joke- I did a real lol 🤣
Flipping PA, MI, and either WI or AZ is enough to give Biden a victory in the Electoral College. In that scenario neither FL nor NC matters.
That will come either way. The genie's out of the bottle. Material conditions are so bad that there's no going back to sleep for tens of millions. They can't. They don't have the wherewithal. We're too far down the path and Biden won't try to fix it.
Liberals are going to be so confused when and if Biden enters office and the protests don't stop. "But Trump is gone!" Yeah. And Black people are still being targeted by the police. And now it's Biden bolstering them.
I know politicians have to (or feel like they have to) play this game. But Biden isn't going to budge an inch on any substantive issue. They need to sell him as "not Trump" and hope it works better than in 2016. Nobody buys this narrative except Republicans.
The longest recession in history inherited by Trump. Mr Biden has memory lapse.
Kanye is an op. Nothing more than being used by republicans as an op to take votes from Biden.
I don't understand how black people can support Joe "YOU AINT BLACK" Biden when he's clearly a white supremacist and pedophile while lambasting Kanye West because he's a successful businessman and father. This is just another liberal machination to discredit our heroes. Smh!
It is time to have a woman in power! I know the ⁦ will share the power with his V.P.!
Biden is a pragmatic technocrat moderate. You’re simply a far right Trump supporter. You can drop the façade. You understand we can actually see your Laura Ingram retweets right?
"Biden" looks nice, and seems to have eaten his spaghetti and meatballs!
"No tax returns, no debate" should be Biden's mantra.
We need 270 electoral votes.  For every "progressive" waffler right now, there are 5-10 African-Americans/NeverTrumpers/etc. in NC/FL/AZ/WI/PA/GA/TX/etc. we can get to polls to vote for Biden before we can get a "progressive."
Also, Joe Biden is winning certain states -- e.g., VA -- by margins unseen by Democrats.  I mean -- Barack Obama was the first Dem in 44 years to win VA at the Presidential level.  It's still hard to believe as a VA native that Old Dominion is completely off the table *for Rs.*
Republicans have a clear favorite for Biden’s running mate  HE SHOULD PICK KAMALA HARRIS INSTEAD SHE'S GOING TO GET THE 🤡 IN THE WH.

For everyone saying he’s had a stutter for a long time, yes you’re right but clearly it’s more than just a stutter now, he can barely finish a sentence. In this video from 1993 you can see he has a minor stutter, but is 10x more coherent.
As if you needed another reason to not vote for Joe Biden. Like, seriously, who is this even for? Where is the mythical voter who would have voted for Trump but decided to vote for Biden instead because he promised to grab guns?
seriously, they should be allowed exhibits including slides &amp; video.  Trump will lie every time he opens his mouth and rather than watch them accuse each other of lying the whole time, Biden should be able to show video or quotes of trump speaking or fact checks to prove the lies

Census Bureau turnouts for Wisconsin among Blacks "alone or in combination"  2012:  192,000 2016:  104,000    Biden will win 90% of Blacks in November. Where is that 100,000 for West going to come from?
Dude he’s absolutely COOKED! It’s honestly tough to watch at times, I’m not a massive Trump guy or politics guy at all but the Biden situation is insanity he literally cannot speak anymore. “I’m forward looking to debating him” &amp; that CREEPY ass laugh wtf 🤦‍♂️
Biden has worked his whole life on overcoming a stutter. When have you overcome anything?
4 years ago👇🏿.Keep the hard work up!
I know.  I'm originally from there.  Biden is about the best possible Democratic candidate for NoVA and Trump is about the worst possible Republican candidate for NoVA.
I’m all for doing everything we can but when the nomination wasn’t locked up coronavirus didn’t seem to matter.
How certain for candidate?                                          Trump     Biden Certain to vote for       38%        36% Likely to vote for          12            12 Not likely to vote for   51            53
Re-elections aren't about who the challenger picks as her/his/their VP.  Re-elections are referendums on the incumbent's conduct and performance in office.  This election will not be about Joe Biden's VP pick -- it will be about Donald Trump's conduct and performance in office.
So-called "double haters," voters who gave unfavorable ratings to both Clinton and Trump, split for Trump about 2-1 on election day.  This year double haters are supporting Biden by about the same margin.
I think I agree and only because of the extensive series of Dem debates that gave us plenty of opportunity to see Biden in action and hear his views.  have no expectations of him from debates, only anti-Biden fodder.

It won't appear so because Biden will answer logically. And besides, Biden could shoot someone on 5th ave. and not lose any votes
That is because he lacks a shred of humanity.  He cares only for money and for himself. Everything else is disposable.  He is twisted.  We have got to get both him and his enablers out of office.  Biden/Dems don’t screw this up!
We don't need no stinkin' debates. They're not really debates anyway. Tom Friedman was right that Biden is at an disadvantage so long as Trump's tax returns are not public. How about each candidate sits down with 3 actual journalists and takes questions for an hour, maybe twice.
“The entire Trump universe of dipshits inventing a narrative out of thin air that Biden doesn’t want to debate when Biden has already agreed to all of the debates serves what purpose??”   Biden agreed to three debates IN WRITING three months ago.

I expected Rendell to behave this way.  I didn't expect it from Dodd, Biden's longtime friend on the Foreign Relations Committee who more than anyone helped keep John Bolton from a permanent position as U.N. Ambassador during the Bush years.
The consolation prize for living through this hell is Biden overwhelmingly favored to win, Dems nearly guaranteed to hold the House, and Dems slightly favored to retake the Senate.
Dodd and Rendell damaged Biden and others, too.  That's the problem.  Dodd should have known Bass, a possible future House Speaker, could never have survived VP vetting, and not put her through the process -- particularly this late.  The process seems so ... chaotic.
What policies does Biden differ on from AOC or Bernie?
&amp; Biden is up by how much, now?  The guy as a challenger is at 49 percent or better in states comprising of well north of 300 EVs — including NC/PA/MI/WI/FL.  That’s an amazing position to be in for a challenger at this point.  Voters have made up their minds about the incumbent.
Totally get it.  If Biden and his vetters were that serious about Bass, this should have been done in June/early July.
we need to get past the topic of joe biden's verbal issues because the way we talk about it is really ableist and just tells kids who cannot speak perfectly due to speech disorders, deafness, etc. that they cannot excel as much as their abled peers. this narrative is antiquated

Harris and Rice are really snarky and elitest.  Biden is empathic but he is not without his own moments when he is snarky.  Personally I find snarky people offensive. He needs a toughmined woman who is no nonsense.  He should be begging Amy Kolbuchar to beVP.   Very high trust
Rice is very unlike able person and all the Republicans are going to scream Benghazi!  Biden needs focus on what he is going to do to get Americans what they need
Not a single female politician is good enough for Joe Biden?  If that was his feeling he should have picked a man.

All of this is true. No argument.  What is the alternative??? Biden? Really? It’s not Trump vs Biden.  It’s Right vs Left.  The choice is obvious.  Hold your nose and vote Republican.   Or get Portland as a country.
Biden should simply require tax returns before debating. What is Donald afraid of? He took the case to scotus ffs, and then lost.

This remains a major issue. It’s hard to argue you would fight wholeheartedly for GND or M4A or other issues if you were silent when the incumbent was falling short. Biden will sometimes have to be pushed to do right by the district and  will do that.

I mean... I actually think that if Biden is winning in a landslide, he’s carrying Vigo.

I don’t think over 70 should have run, but it is what it is.  Markey is no Biden.
It'd be really swell if people on the left like yourself would stop betting on Biden failing.
In person but because I’m white and privileged, there are no lines. And I don’t want to stress the postal system. And I want to make sure my vote for Biden is counted immediately.
The media is somehow bored with this election. Or maybe this is false balance at work where they have to invent a Biden “controversy” because the Trump campaign is such a disaster.

"No, we're gonna go and beat Joe Biden fair and square"
“The candidate is talking about child care and elder care in the same breath, and making them part of his economic package. Both changes are long overdue.”
The Washington Post's  have a point. There are too many people trying to influence Biden's decision, often by attacking another contender. This must stop.
This is worth reading, with a stiff drink in hand.   A bipartisan group secretly gathered to game out a contested Trump-Biden election. It wasn’t pretty
yup.. gotta set someone up for the future becaise biden is only good for 1 term.
This thing where we can’t even acknowledge that old white male Democratic politicians from Markey to Biden opposed bussing at the time with a wink and a nudge at white voters is stifling and dishonest.
Mood entering this week knowing that Biden will (hopefully) announce his VP pick
Kiss your #SocialSecurity goodbye, folks. This is how the #GOPscam will defund it while they're trying to distract you with feds attacking protesters and claiming Biden is coming for your bank account.
Another brilliant tweet that the Biden campaign took three weeks to come up with.

Seems like we are headed in that direction with all these poll numbers in Biden’s favor😘
Biden was many of our second, third, fourth choice.  Many of us were already passed first choice.
I believe Biden will deliver on those things regardless of his VP.
Of course Trump doesn't have a plan. He never had one, he doesn't want one, and he doesn't care. He rejected the one he was given. Let's move on and start talking about Biden's plan. #TrumpHasNoPlan #bidencoalition #Covid19

Peter Lucas famously predicted to my Statehouse reporting class at BU that Obama would drop Biden for Hillary on the 2012 ticket
Trump did the impossible. He managed to get out the vote, for Biden.
Well, Joe Biden is notorious for being indecisive.  Biden said in 1985-1986 he would support Robert Bork to the Supreme Court.  He also said around 1990 he would vote for Clarence Thomas.  We all know how Joe Biden voted on both nominations.
Joe Biden should better appreciate the moral authority of becoming the presumptive party nominee, and how folks feel morally compelled to do anything to help their party leader.  It’s hard to say no to the party leader.  (2/2)
No, this is on Biden.  Biden is the presumptive D nominee.  Biden is the one who earned the trust of the party.    It’s Joe Biden’s Democratic Party now.  (1/2)
Anyone who has watched someone close to them suffer through a cognitive decline recognizes the symptoms in Biden. The vacant eyes, the appearance of confusion, etc. are dead giveaways.   As much as he may have wanted this in the past, forcing him to continue is cruel and abusive.
It’s Russia using same tactics as in the US: propaganda surgically targeted at rednecks and rubes via social media.  It works  Biden admin needs to bring SM to heel, make it a crime to disseminate misinformation, and break up the platforms if they don’t stop

I really do think in a Biden midterm he could make things interesting.  He wouldn’t win... but he’d scare some people.
Biden could *really* troll the pseudo-woke crowd by just picking some mediocre dumpy old white guy. Maybe Tim Kaine, again.  It's the last crowd he needs to alienate.
I personally don't care about anything that comes out against Biden in October, true or not true. Nothing could disqualify him in the race against Trump and the hordes of republicans in the House and the Senate.
But she's never competed for office.  Here are all these women who have put themselves out there and run for office, none of them measure for Biden.  That's a bad look.  Most VPs in modern history have electoral experience.
I will evaluate the VP pick, as every american should. I highly doubt the Biden ticket will be worse than Trump's so I'd put money on me picking Biden, but I'm not going to follow blindly.
i mean i agree with your point but Biden won the nomination and Bernie holds the key to lot of voters. Hopefully next time it will be Kamala deciding with Val or Tammy or Elizabeth or stacey or...
"4 years after most Americans, experts realize the obvious."
Well, they're not doing that because Biden is a vulnerable leader.  And powerful people are already thinking about what is next.
I wrote this yesterday when someone told a khiver that Kamala Harris adds nothing to the ticket.  I’m pretty sure Biden gets it.

Lloyd Bentsen was one of the strongest VP candidates and he couldn’t save Dukakis.  Dan Quayle was one of the worst choices I’ve seen and Bush still won.  Biden’s choice is important because of his age, but I don’t think it’s going to change any votes.
Guys, I think this is an important article and if true, Biden is going to come out smelling like a rose compared to his buddies.
"They all suspect that the California senator is Biden’s top choice as he begins one-on-one meetings with the top candidates in the coming days."  via
Yeah, no VP choice is perfect, and I’m still with Biden this year. Hopefully the eventual VP pick won’t *also* have plagiarized a Neil Kinnock speech, though - that might be a bit more than folks will be willing to take.
Joe Biden should quiet his team.  If he's ready to be president, he is certainly prepared to control his house.
Kennedy was a bit too radical, I don't think America was ready for a CATHOLIC president like we are now with Biden, that being said it was sad that JFK was killed by a lone gunman and nothing more  LBJ did all his policies way better though
We need 12 years.  And she’d be running on a ticket with a 77 year old.  I find it completey unfathomable.  Further, we can’t have an all white ticket in the aftermath of George Floyd.  If we could, Biden would have already picked Klobuchar.
That’s not the point.  She lost the primary.  If Biden runs two terms, she’d be 80 when we run for that elusive third term.  We’re the party of young voters.  We shouldn’t run a ticket 13 years old than Trump’s.  And our base wants a diverse ticket.Love it.... and if I were Biden,  I'd say "Judas...because without him, Jesus wouldn't have died for our sins" (then turn his head toward Trump and....wink).
Remember folks, all this death and economic destruction is part of coronavirus stage 1. We still have coronavirus stage 2 coming this fall.   Vote for Biden to save American lives and economy. He listens to the scientists and not just to himself. #RidenWithBiden2020
It will take a lot, but Joe Biden and his Administration will do it!
When I listen to Biden, I am reminded of the movie Airplane when they needed someone who knew "jive".  I need someone who can translate "Biden" speak.
As an independent, who has voted both sides over the years.  I'm more interested in understanding WHAT Biden plans on doing to make the economy better, put folks back to work, and bring all our military home from Afghanistan.  Democrats need to stop looking backward.
When over a thousand Americans are dying every day and this guy is hinting that he won't leave office willingly, don't be surprised that spitballing about how Biden should commit to just being a "placeholder" is not being received well.
Trump: People say you can test too much Swan: Who says that? Trump: It’s in “the manual” I think Biden just found a great commercial to support his election...#   Please do your thing!
Unbelievable. Well I guess not, if they are to keep their momentum there’s no way they let Biden debate. The sad part is the Dems will come up with all sorts of excuses and/or reasons as to why it’s ok for Biden to hold out from debating. Nothing is sacred. It’s all sham.
Come on people It will take less time to vote than it does to buy a dozen eggs at the grocery store.  Mask up, put your big boy pants (skirt) on and vote! A little social separation and all will be well. Seniors can pull a "Biden" and absentee ballot as they have always done.
Trump is laying the foundation to challenge the outcome of this upcoming election. He is a monster, an authoritarian who demeans the very foundation of our democracy - the right to vote, all while killing thousands with his negligence. #Biden
We had over 1,200 deaths from Covid yesterday. Other countries had 0 or 1 or 7. Presidential incompetence has killed so many of us, and all Trump does is lie. #Biden2020 #Biden

he’s complimenting his daughter, what’s the problem? joe biden literally touches little kids, and this is your only argument? crazy world we live in.
I’m really worried that after Biden is elected (and assuming he is) there will be a move by the middle toward “reconciliation” and “meeting the opposition halfway”. No. No compromise with the GOP ever again. We can’t afford to delay the reconstruction process.
Biden versus Trump. Some speculate that the future of the republic hinges on the outcome of the next election. But for smart investors it doesn't really matter who wins.
Biden has challenges,  but he is not a mentally ill malignant narcissist combined with dementia.

This question is sincere, but can I ask why you have decided to not vote for Biden? I am voting for him begrudgingly despite him being an awful choice, but for me personally it's better than more Trump. Just curious.
I truthfully believe once Biden is in office, EVERYTHING is going to change, and not on Biden’s initiative, but Congress. They’re going to want to safeguard the presidency to never get as close to a dictatorship as it has with Trump in office. I foresee several amendments coming.
I see. But wouldn't almost all the concerns that applies to Biden with regards to age and health conditions also apply to Sanders. Also, I think Bernie made a lot of errors during the primary and his loss was not the result of only an unfair primary.
It’s also just #Gaslighting and the EO will be held up in litigation until  is kicked to the curb. After this, President Biden can just write another EO eliminating this one. It’s all a shell game and a con. Always for  Case in point
Biden can do and get away with it. This is how Biden knows he got the black vote.
Where is Jill Biden? Save your husbands dignity for heaven’s sake!!
#Biden owns a shotgun. I don't know if #Trump does. I don't. But it's  #Biden &amp; #Democrats who are pushing legislation that could lead to infringement. 3/X
Biden doubles down on his stupidity and racism.
But #Biden backs policies that could impact my right to practice my religion &amp; #Trump doesn't. Trump isn't keeping me out of Church, #Democrats are. 2/X
I think that Trump could plausibly lose, but it would not be because of Joe Biden or anything Biden has done.
My advice to the black community, Joe Biden needs your vote, tell him you will forgive him if he gives you (insert  demand). Politics 101, when you have political power use it
Here's the point you aren't getting. So #Biden attends Church &amp; you judge him to be sincere - fine. You say Trump isn't sincere - fine.  1/X
Especially once blacks get to know the real Joe Biden:
lol, you going by hearsay but ignoring Biden voting against desegregation and didn’t what his kids going to school with black kids. Yet you ignore Trump doing the most for blacks than president ever
We need to put equal effort into flooding Biden's tweets with positive reinforcement as we do with confronting republicans' tweets. There is a great disparity, republicans are flooding Biden as we do tRump and it is negatively influencing potential voters.
I can’t follow the reasoning because Trump is only focused on his own agenda. We have proof of the horrible job he’s done over the last 4 years, it won’t get better in the next 4. Biden will be bullied by actually progressives in offices to push forth issues we need seen.
WE NEED A LANDSLIDE (FOR BIDEN)
Good call! Biden will listen to his team as opposed to Trump. We all might dislike Biden, but we have to trust that those filling other positions in office will actually have influence in issues that were actually concerned with whereas Trump is only worried about his own agenda
Joe Biden - faith.
This is pretty much the only logical explanation for voting biden I’ve ever seen. When it’s all “he’s not trump” that doesn’t reassure me of anything. I don’t know if I can pull myself to continue contributing to an organization that appears to neglect the people. But compelling!
Get specific please. Have you read Biden’s plans??? Go online and read them then get back to us on where we can read Trumps plans laid out like Biden’s.
I sure hope this is wrong. AOC is the future. Her being excluded will discourage young people from voting for Biden.

Classic racist Joe Biden.
Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden says he will not stand in the way of prosecution against President Trump from the Justice Department if he is elected.
Saw some opinion article where they said they would wait and see who Biden's V.P. pick would be before deciding. I was prepared to vote for a toothpick to be president. I don't know how any Dem V.P. could drag the ticket.
Daily reminder that Joe Biden would be be 78 when inaugurated, is clearly not all there, and his potential Vice President is being chosen based on gender and race
Why? So he can steal 11 votes away from Biden?
You presume that, because I criticize Biden, I support Trump?!? 🤣🤣🤣  Please try to widen your scope a little bit!!!  I DESPISE DONALD JOHN TRUMP AND WISH FOR HIM TO BE BANISHED FROM SOCIETY  …which is why I'm so angry at the DNC for pushing Biden as the nominee!!!

Yesterday I made the mistake of telling people on my Instagram that Biden is a racist not a Trump level racist but a racist none the less. We can't make excuses for his behavior because he's not as bad a Trump.
Joe Biden will need to be kept under constant pressure  if we hope to see justice for what the Republicans have done the past four years as well as making any advance on climate change, healthcare, racist policing, et al. Returning to the status quo is not acceptable!
Not at all saying that I like the alternative, but no one should be able to say that they are comfortable with Biden as President...he just isn’t with it enough anymore
Maybe, but I'm not so sure about that. Will the "moderate" independents be comfortable voting for a Progressive like Sanders and Warren? Part of Biden's appeal is his relative "moderation" in comparison with the other Dems.
joe biden’s campaign and joe kennedy’s are exactly the same i see
Aug 6 - part 2  V - OH Gov DeWine tests positive before meeting with Trump. Then tests negative....hmmmm BTB - Thighland. Biden hurts God. CV -  Michelle Obama says she’s depressed...welcome to the Club  EL - Pelosi, Schumer write to Postmaster General DC - still no deal
My true thought is the Dems are too far down the road with Biden.  I believe he will be "Epsteined".  Causing a "feel sorry" movement while plugging Hillary back in.  I truly believe this may already be being planned.
If anything good comes out of a Biden presidency it will be because massive movements of American people persist in protests and activism.
I actually respect Brett a lot and like to hear his perspective on things (although I disagree with a lot of his politics). It's just that at this point in time, replacing Biden is no more than wishful thinking.

I wouldn't be surprised if she Votes for Biden on the down low and she just doesn't want to announce it publicly.
I will say it right out. I am a former Republican (until Bernie 2016), I can't stand Biden. I think he is a bad candidate  At this moment in time, there is a fundamental right and wrong with limited choices Voting for Biden is the right thing to do Sorry I can't be more upbeat

Biden: "I'll announce my VP pick by the end of the first week of August."  Political Twitter at 12:00 on Friday, August 7th:
Trump claims that Biden's America will be so bad that even Trump will be president.
Oh that’s where he got the inspiration for the crime bill?   Trump’s comments are always absurd. Not sure why there’s a need from Biden to highlight his religion despite the critique. Not like it persuaded any Trump voters to perhaps consider Joe’s religious inspirations.
I stand with Joe Biden.
Here's evidence of "Jim Crow" Joe Biden on his true views on black and hispanic people:
I can't conceive of it.  That said, even though he wasn't my 1st (or 2nd, or 3rd) choice, I'm not sure Joe Biden isn't the right person for this time, but I think most of his advisors, donors, and hangers-on are doing the country, him, and his potential running mates harm.

That’s never what I said. I want it to be clear I don’t like Biden either. I’m trying to make a point that we already know Trump is a wall for any policy you’d like to implement.

I hope I live long enough to see Biden fulfill Trump’s prophesy of canceling God.
If you aren't casting a vote for Joe Biden you are voting for Donald Trump. That's how binary elections work, you selfish, shortsighted children.
Right. Because even if Biden destroys Trump you’ll find a way to spin it against him so you can blow your wad. That’s your turn on. 😉
It's a comment on Biden's tweet...

This is so true.  “I’ll help you, but first I’m going to go over Biden’s Healthcare proposal line by line.”  Oh.. you’d rather walk? Alrighty.
Let's be honest here. Biden's mouth is a bigger danger here than any Russian influence.
*Biden Boy
Patrick is disingenuous re being a “conservative.” He even admitted in a Tweet 5 minutes ago that he’s happy Biden will be super liberal. He only calls himself “conservative” because he thinks CNN or MSNBC might come calling for his punditry. They’re not interested of course
You're not worthy to be president. Who are you to say who anybody is going to vote for. You're just mad it's not you. And sleepy Joe Biden's going to kick your ass in November and then you go to prison.

My remark still stands. UR entitled to UR opinion. I have no problem w/people supporting #Biden. I simply find  disingenuous.
For instance, if you want Medicare 4 all, student debt relief, and police reform, one of them comes first in your mind right? They aren’t accomplished simultaneously. Trump isn’t going to do any of this. There’s at least the slightest chance Biden or Congress will.
Joe Biden insults African Americans.
If you're a conservative or Republican who's going to vote for Joe Biden then as far as I'm concerned you're not a Republican. Don't understand how u can have conservative principles n yet support the man who wants to bring the country so far left China looks like a free country
“Biden loves Biden.”  First, respecting the office and our institutions does not mean that one has to respect the office-holder. Democracy means being actively involved, if only by voting.  I don’t know if Biden loves Biden, but Trump loves Trump more than he loves his Country.
2/2 The Democrats hope you’ll turn on Trump and blame HIM for ALL your troubles. But THAT’S about to BACKFIRE. Inadvertently, the Dems have STRENGTHENED Trump’s base, NOT weakened it. They know THIS is the ONLY way Biden can “win.” And now ? Mail In voting !
Who is doing this "heavy vetting" for Biden's VP? Seriously. Not so heavy
Biden needs to STOP courting white folks. He needs to secure his support among Black people and POC. We’ve seen HOW EASY it is for white folks to return to Trump without blinking a eye.
Another racist Joe Biden classic!
I'm gonna take my medicine, but goddamn is biden a horrible candidate. The final 2 candidates in this election have to be the worst final 2 in history. Anyone. Literally anyone is better than the current dipshit, but Biden is the best "we've" got. One step at a time though.

Bottomline: the Republican Party doesn’t have the selfrespect to run their sorry candidate for president without the support of Putin/Russia. Biden will reject all interference. Trump asked for, received, benefitted from, and rewarded help in ‘16,can’t call out Putin to this day.
Not the way Joe Biden sniffs people! The way Mitt Romney does: I want to be in a binder with my fellow bad lefties.

I was never on the Trump train. I'm just not a lunatic leftist that thinks he's the root of all evil. I agree with some of his decisions. Some not. And I can see clearly the media spin against him. I will likely vote for him over Biden if that's the choice to be made.
That’s never what I said. I want it to be clear I don’t like Biden either. I’m trying to make a point that we already know Trump is a wall for any policy you’d like to implement.

wowza. china wants biden to win. unsurprising considering their economic long game that goes back to them supporting clinton in 96 along biden probs doing nothing on the uighurs. russia is a menace that views trump as chaos, so that’s obvious.
I hope I live long enough to see Biden fulfill Trump’s prophesy of canceling God.
If you aren't casting a vote for Joe Biden you are voting for Donald Trump. That's how binary elections work, you selfish, shortsighted children.
Right. Because even if Biden destroys Trump you’ll find a way to spin it against him so you can blow your wad. That’s your turn on. 😉
What makes this even crazier is this.  Trump folks believe Kanye will siphon younger, disaffected black voters away from Biden.  But aren't these EXACTLY the voters they are trying to disenfranchise "with surgical precision."  You can't siphon voters you are blocking from voting.

You're not worthy to be president. Who are you to say who anybody is going to vote for. You're just mad it's not you. And sleepy Joe Biden's going to kick your ass in November and then you go to prison.

“Biden loves Biden.”  First, respecting the office and our institutions does not mean that one has to respect the office-holder. Democracy means being actively involved, if only by voting.  I don’t know if Biden loves Biden, but Trump loves Trump more than he loves his Country.

Who is doing this "heavy vetting" for Biden's VP? Seriously. Not so heavy

Another racist Joe Biden classic!
I'm gonna take my medicine, but goddamn is biden a horrible candidate. The final 2 candidates in this election have to be the worst final 2 in history. Anyone. Literally anyone is better than the current dipshit, but Biden is the best "we've" got. One step at a time though.

trump is a white nationalist racist. Biden is better.
That’s putting it mildly.  I’m glad he’s finally showing up Biden’s moral compass.  He hides behind his “good ol’ Catholic school boy” mantra when he’s a bureaucratic piece of dirt on record.

Yeah Biden’s stances are not reflective of our views in most cases, but I guess I’m seeing past him as president and trusting that congress and the Supreme Court can implement MAJOR revisions to presidency as we know it today. Trump exploited every possible power trip he could
So basically what you’re telling me is, Biden is racist but trump is not👀... fuck that I am still voting Biden, I simply don’t like trump and his kkk administration.
"so he’s not gonna raise billionaire’s taxes"?  Sounds like you don't know what "facts" and "research" are either.
This question is sincere, but can I ask why you have decided to not vote for Biden? I am voting for him begrudgingly despite him being an awful choice, but for me personally it's better than more Trump. Just curious.
I truthfully believe once Biden is in office, EVERYTHING is going to change, and not on Biden’s initiative, but Congress. They’re going to want to safeguard the presidency to never get as close to a dictatorship as it has with Trump in office. I foresee several amendments coming.
I see. But wouldn't almost all the concerns that applies to Biden with regards to age and health conditions also apply to Sanders. Also, I think Bernie made a lot of errors during the primary and his loss was not the result of only an unfair primary.
It’s also just #Gaslighting and the EO will be held up in litigation until  is kicked to the curb. After this, President Biden can just write another EO eliminating this one. It’s all a shell game and a con. Always for  Case in point

My advice to the black community, Joe Biden needs your vote, tell him you will forgive him if he gives you (insert  demand). Politics 101, when you have political power use it
Here's the point you aren't getting. So #Biden attends Church &amp; you judge him to be sincere - fine. You say Trump isn't sincere - fine.  1/X
Especially once blacks get to know the real Joe Biden:

We need to put equal effort into flooding Biden's tweets with positive reinforcement as we do with confronting republicans' tweets. There is a great disparity, republicans are flooding Biden as we do tRump and it is negatively influencing potential voters.
I can’t follow the reasoning because Trump is only focused on his own agenda. We have proof of the horrible job he’s done over the last 4 years, it won’t get better in the next 4. Biden will be bullied by actually progressives in offices to push forth issues we need seen.
WE NEED A LANDSLIDE (FOR BIDEN)
Good call! Biden will listen to his team as opposed to Trump. We all might dislike Biden, but we have to trust that those filling other positions in office will actually have influence in issues that were actually concerned with whereas Trump is only worried about his own agenda
Joe Biden - faith.
This is pretty much the only logical explanation for voting biden I’ve ever seen. When it’s all “he’s not trump” that doesn’t reassure me of anything. I don’t know if I can pull myself to continue contributing to an organization that appears to neglect the people. But compelling!

Daily reminder that Joe Biden would be be 78 when inaugurated, is clearly not all there, and his potential Vice President is being chosen based on gender and race
Why? So he can steal 11 votes away from Biden?

Joe Biden will need to be kept under constant pressure  if we hope to see justice for what the Republicans have done the past four years as well as making any advance on climate change, healthcare, racist policing, et al. Returning to the status quo is not acceptable!
Not at all saying that I like the alternative, but no one should be able to say that they are comfortable with Biden as President...he just isn’t with it enough anymore
Maybe, but I'm not so sure about that. Will the "moderate" independents be comfortable voting for a Progressive like Sanders and Warren? Part of Biden's appeal is his relative "moderation" in comparison with the other Dems.

My true thought is the Dems are too far down the road with Biden.  I believe he will be "Epsteined".  Causing a "feel sorry" movement while plugging Hillary back in.  I truly believe this may already be being planned.
If anything good comes out of a Biden presidency it will be because massive movements of American people persist in protests and activism.

And then, of course, there is the inhospitable way trump treats immigrants both legal and illegal and the poor. Just politics you might say? I would answer that Biden’s stance on abortion is also just politics .
Moreover, Biden neither renounced nor denounced his faith with his political position. One could well argue that Trump’s lack of love, compassion, mercy, humility and grace most assuredly is against the teachings of Jesus and the will of God.

we just had 8 years of Obama, republicans weren’t about to let a dem take office. But I personally don’t think they would have used Biden as he was very strongly against being president in 2016.  people were calling for him to run but he had just lost his son to cancer; grieving.
And also would Biden even be running if he did not feel the pressure from the left to take down Trump?

How can you hurt the Bible and hurt God when you've already hurt them so much Don?
What makes this even crazier is this.  Trump folks believe Kanye will siphon younger, disaffected black voters away from Biden.  But aren't these EXACTLY the voters they are trying to disenfranchise "with surgical precision."  You can't siphon voters you are blocking from voting.
Dupe or dope? “Johnson is considered 'toxic' by some members of the intelligence community." "Some intelligence officials similarly fear [Johnson's] Biden probe will only boost the Russian intervention."
The Bridge: Barack Obama, Joe Biden, and the Battle for Everything
Patrick is disingenuous re being a “conservative.” He even admitted in a Tweet 5 minutes ago that he’s happy Biden will be super liberal. He only calls himself “conservative” because he thinks CNN or MSNBC might come calling for his punditry. They’re not interested of course
I just published The Bridge: Barack Obama, Joe Biden, and the Battle for Everything
Trumpers are watching doctored videos of Biden on Facebook.  Meanwhile, they’re completely out to lunch on Yo-Semite, Thighland, and the acuity test.  This is what we’re up against.
So it’s obvious that Biden will pick his VP before the convention.  My question is, how does he present it? In normal times you have a rally to bring them on stage, what would be the approach this year? A press release? An event?
This the Fatherland whose false narratives  services: BREAKING OWASHINGTON (AP) — US intelligence says Russia is using a range of measures to denigrate Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden.
A Republican lawmaker in a Virginia House race elicits sharp criticism for selling masks describing the virus as “Made in China.”  Tennessee’s Senate race will pit a Trump-backed Republican against a Democratic environmental justice activist. NYT
My husband has a stutter &amp; does EXACTLY what Biden does when he's trying not to stutter. He misuses or looks to forget simple words when he tries to suppress a stutter. It ends up coming out all wrong, sometimes confusing people who don't know about his stutter.
If you don’t vote for Biden, you’re essentially voting for the Mango Mussolini.
It was awful.  Two guys behind the counter and this older woman yucking it up about how old Biden is.  They called him Sleepy Joe, I said at least he’s not racist Trump.  Imagine thinking your customers want to hear that crap.
The market will also crash because corporations will freak out if and when Biden wins. The gravy train will be over &amp; I expect billionaires to have a huge temper tantrum.
"[dem] voters will forgive Biden’s latest racist remarks—as they’ve forgiven him for everything else, like, say Tara Reade—because they must rationalize that this election is so important that if you demand Biden be held accountable, you must want another four years of Trump"
Nah, there’s plenty of ways Biden’s platform is to the right of Hillary’s.
Delusional to even think that, Biden no one wants a individual who Has a touchy feely syndrome of children.
I see. But wouldn't almost all the concerns that applies to Biden with regards to age and health conditions also apply to Sanders. Also, I think Bernie made a lot of errors during the primary and his loss was not the result of only an unfair primary.
It’s also just #Gaslighting and the EO will be held up in litigation until  is kicked to the curb. After this, President Biden can just write another EO eliminating this one. It’s all a shell game and a con. Always for  Case in point
got anything to add to Kayne West saying his sole purpose in this election to help Biden lose? Because you were roasting people left n right the day he announced his candidacy
You presume that, because I criticize Biden, I support Trump?!? 🤣🤣🤣  Please try to widen your scope a little bit!!!  I DESPISE DONALD JOHN TRUMP AND WISH FOR HIM TO BE BANISHED FROM SOCIETY  …which is why I'm so angry at the DNC for pushing Biden as the nominee!!!
Well, my voting life includes Lieberman, Cheney, Edwards, Biden, Palin, Ryan, Kaine, &amp; Pence.  I think Palin was the worst pick of that group overall.
Maybe, but I'm not so sure about that. Will the "moderate" independents be comfortable voting for a Progressive like Sanders and Warren? Part of Biden's appeal is his relative "moderation" in comparison with the other Dems.
I actually respect Brett a lot and like to hear his perspective on things (although I disagree with a lot of his politics). It's just that at this point in time, replacing Biden is no more than wishful thinking.
Well, most "Not Trump" people will probably vote for Biden. So it's essentially the same thing.
With all due respect, I think you are very wrong on this one. It's too late now to change the nominee. Also, Biden being ahead in the polls make it more difficult to replace him.
To suggest that Black people who were not going to for Trump will suddenly vote for him because Biden said they are a monolith is insulting to the intelligence of Black people. Black people are capable of making political decisions beyond statements &amp; gaffes.
Sadly, I have. And I am in no way saying Biden is worse at this stuff than Trump. I am saying that Biden has never been a great public speaker, and has lately become a much WORSE public speaker. A hedgehog in a red hat would be better at public speaking than Trump!
Here’s What Tammy Duckworth, Joe Biden’s Potential VP Pick, Can Teach the Fashion Industry #disability #disabilities #inclusion  via
I love how conservatives argued throughout the primary that only Biden would get their votes in November and now that they got Biden, they're arguing they'll only vote for him if they get the VP they want too. No, this isn't your party.   #bidenwarren2020
#BLM   #Dems #MAGA2020 even non-political person like me knows what Biden said isn't true-means 2 things: either Biden is not worthy of Black vote or Black community doesn't care about themselves-after repeated insults, asking more

The last year and a half, many people have been naming Wisconsin as the crucial, most likely  "tipping point" state, just to the right of Pennsylvania.  Well, now both 538 and the Economist have WI a bit more Biden friendly than PA. Gotta say:
Biden doesn't need to beat Trump when Trump is doing a fine job of beating himself.
2/ Biden was my next-to-last choice in the primary. But I’ve also been impressed how he’s used task forces bringing people across the D spectrum together to achieve really solid consensus approaches. Especially true in my area, climate &amp; energy. Good governance strategy.
Biden not only has a website but decades of public service showing where he stands and how he will govern. (You might not want to hear it, but cf Trump’s decades of lying &amp; gritting.) ½
i also want to vote for Biden   But it all comes down to who he picks for postmaster general.
An opportunity Biden is singularly incapable of seizing. The man can't get through a 15-second script read for a TV as without stumbling, slurring, or slipping. "The only thing we fear is… the thing. You know."
"And by the way, what you all know, but most people don’t know, unlike the African American community, with notable exceptions, the Latino community is an incredibly diverse community with incredibly different attitudes about different things.” -Sleepy Joe Biden
1. i have so many questions about your religion— ... ... 9. so i take it Biden has the subtle knife, Æsahættr, the god killer? 10. and Trump stayed up all night reading His Dark Materials?
Question ; why do we listen to morons like Dr Fauci ( and the girl) moron Marty Walsh , joe Biden , Charlie Parker and the rest ? Please god tell us why ?
I feel like the DNC shouldn’t have forced a candidate on voters who frequently displays anti-Black racism, as recently as yesterday. Also, a reminder that if Trump wins, it’s on 2 groups of ppl &amp; 2 groups of ppl alone: 1. Trump voters, 2. Biden and the DNC
I’m not opposed to this, but  is a Republican. She regularly critiques policies that are mainstream for Democrats.  I don’t see Biden adding progressive voices or policies is a meaningful way.  If he wants the base to show up he needs to reach out to progressives too.
I get being upset that your candidate didn’t get the nomination.  Mine didn’t either.  But at a certain point we all need to consider how a continued Trump presidency looks for marginalized communities vs how a Biden presidency would look for those same communities.
Remember when some Bernie stans were like ‘a vote for Biden is a vote for Trump?’.  Well, at this point, refusing to vote Biden because he’s boring and not particularly progressive is undeniably handing Trump a vote.
of  tells  "the notion that somehow ambition is a negative is a real setback because what we need for women in politics is to have those ambitious women who are willing to put themselves forward &amp; run for office."
If Biden skips the Debates he might as well skip the election.
Unless Biden digs up Hitler I'm good with whomever he picks.
Could it matter in WI? I guess, but Biden's margins are likely going to be large enough in most states to produce a decisive outcome in both the popular and Electoral vote. Biden has many routes to 270 EVs. Not so for Trump. For instance, winning AZ's 11 EVs while losing WI's 10.
He’s a black trump supporter. He can’t be THAT offended by Biden’s comments, he’s heard worse that he’s okay with.
A Trump-backed candidate won the Republican Senate primary in Tennessee. The decision to shorten the census collection period could make polls less reliable. NYT
Are you sure you are talking about Biden? Not yourself?? 🤔 and I can add no equality, no inclusion, no humanity, no feelings for others needs, no RESPECT for anyone except money, no appreciation, no leader, no anything, Trump!!!!
Does Joe Biden posses Thor's hammer from Isengard ,? that's the only chance he has against God, And Donald Duck Trump has hurt my soul ,so it for tat
Love u George but let's not oversell. Thats a trumper game. Biden is just lesser evil. He needs to really work on his words. He wants to court trumps ignorant base AND stay cool w/everybody else. 🙄🤷🏿

some of y’all are out here gaslighting people for sharing real information about your candidate‘s racist remarks &amp; it’s absolutely hilarious to me.  sweetie, Biden is grown.  to suggest that he can’t be responsible for his actions but must be responsible for a country is... lmao
You are completely untethered from reality. Biden is a pragmatic moderate technocrat.  You appear to get all of your information from absolutely insane sources.
Not unexpected but props to Forbes for the confirmation.
Joe Biden is a joke. Democratic Party has lost its way.

Biden is very in tune with minorities
Why should biden debate Trump Trump will lie, make things up claim false facts it’s a waste of time
I'd have to look up his exact words, but yes, Biden was saying it was safe to vote in person in WI at the same time Sanders was saying it wasn't. Sanders bowed out of the race after the WI primary but before results were announced.
Biden will not win. He won’t
Kanye is an IDIOT!! Take votes from Trump. But don’t vote for Kanye if you hate Trump!!! Vote Biden ! We need Democrat’s in office!!!!

i mean... if biden just... disappeared, could we get bernie back? please?
Biden said “you know I’m less racist vote for me”
Biden was and is far from my candidate of choice and I fully recognize electing him won’t save us from A LOT of things, but his commitment to expanding voting rights is a big motivator for me to support him.
The big difference is Biden consistently polls over 50 percent. Hillary couldn’t hit 45 percent. There are fewer undecideds out there.
Well, I guess that tells me all I need to know about you.  You will cast a vote for DJT, the most corrupt and incompetent president in history, directly or by default if you don't like Biden's VP pick among 4 highly competent black women.
"If liberals are so fucking smart, how come they lose so goddamn always?" - Philosopher Aaron Sorkin  Keeping Biden out of the public eye is the smartest strategy I have seen in a while. Not overly inspiring, though.
Akin to the over emotional Bernie people trashing Biden a few months ago...
It is just people liking   and other (mostly men) shilling for their preferred candidate.  For me, I will back whatever candidate Biden chooses without reservation.  DJT and company will brutalize whichever person Biden chooses.
"Biden, Moynihan, and Goldwater once teamed up on a tuition tax-credit. Could something similar happen now?"

Better is not good. Better is not a destination. Joe Biden is absolutely better. Let's do everything we can to elect him on Nov 3rd. Then we can start talking about why these were our options and how we fix that.
What a joke  In every aspect of being human &amp; a leader, Joe Biden is objectively vastly superior to your corrupt, cruel, lazy moronic boss  There is NO case to be made for trump over Biden. The only question is will your side succeed in stealing the election  #GOPTraitors
What is a vote for Joe Biden?
Piss off. This is a shitty ad and Biden should be called on it. He is out of touch. His people are out of touch.
Compared to Trump, Biden is the son Cicero and Thomas Jefferson never had.

Chris Wallace says Trump wouldn't want more debates if he was leading in polls   It goes to show once again how out of touch Chris Wallace is !of course Trump doesn’t need more debates but it’s a chance for him to annihilate the left more thoroughly!GoTrump
Maybe we shouldn't make the guy who can "hurt God" mad at us? The only logical thing to do is is concede the election immediately and ask Biden if there's anything he'd like you to do for him before January.
Wrong. Deep and widespread corruption is exactly what the majority of voters believe the NRA stands for. That and killing children. This is a win for the Biden campaign.
Biden is essentially a potted plant - thats the issue.
First Biden sticker sighting.
Biden responds by listing the 365 daimons that control the bone-soul, the marrow-soul, the hair-soul, etc.
Wow! Really? How was this obvious fact overlooked by the FIRST BLACK PRESIDENT?? And pray tell why is it that black voters overwhelming supported Biden in the primary? Perhaps you can tell us In all your Woke White Wisdom why Obama and black voters in this country are so stupid.
Confirmed: Biden is a patripassianist who has forged the Gospel of Joseph based on canonical texts in order to dethrone and exile the current bishop of DC
I've changed my trending topics country to France, because, Dear Lord, Biden's gonna Hurt God.
You black people are all the same, says Biden now. This is a variation on you are voting for me or “you ain’t black.” I hope African Americans prove Punxsutawney Joe wrong.
These are things I want and Biden actually won’t do! So fuck all y’all
Apparently, Biden is the theoretical rock that God can’t lift.
Okay, at any rate, I think Big Gretch, while she may not be the *best* pick, is likely a *good* pick -- and certainly a *reasonable* pick.  I'm voting for Biden regardless, and I'd be happy if Biden picked Big Gretch.  9/8
If your vote for Biden depends on his VP pick (as a practical matter), then you’re not a “moderate”: you’re just a terrible person.
And I think for Joe Biden being able to listen to the perspective of an African-American VP -- and how she feels about things (e.g., "You ain't black") -- would be of tremendous value to a Biden Presidency.  So that's where I am.  8/8
That Joe Biden would pick the first African-American woman to be on a major party ticket will only add to his moral authority over the incumbent.  6/
It's an incredible contrast to the current whiner-in-Chief.  Further, Joe Biden gained an incredibly moral authority by for eight years as VP defending our nation's first black President (which also did not have a single scandal).  5/
Joe Biden is running for President to restore the moral authority in the office of the Presidency.  He has experienced the kinds of unimaginable family tragedies that would have caused many to give up long ago.  Yet he hasn't, and even remains in good spirits.  4/
Honestly, I've always felt Biden is best off picking an African-American woman.  And I don't think there's any way around that.  3/
My fav fantasy: Biden's DOJ gets back from trump every single taxpayer dollar he's spent campaigning illegally on our dime
Months ago I was trying to tell skeptical elderly relatives that Biden wouldn't get every Republican to vote for him because Republicans are fascists, even the ones who say they aren't. Now many are flabbergasted and I just sit silently, seething at what could have been
Joe "All black people think the same" Biden
Don’t dismiss this: Donald Trump will win again if 1) we don’t rally others to vote &amp; 2) Joe Biden doesn’t get his shit together.   Remember all the crazy shit Trump said &amp; he still beat Hillary? People said it wouldn’t happen. They’re saying it now. It did &amp; it may again.   VOTE
She is bothered by Biden insulting black journilsts but not by the death of Elijah McLean .
I voted for Bernie in the primary in 2016. I accepted the loss and voted for Hillary in the general election. She wasn’t my preferred choice, but she was first choice by far in Nov. This year, I preferred Warren. But I’ll happily cast my vote for Biden.
Pence’s SCOTUS comments reinforce what I said in a previous tweet: the judiciary is the most powerful branch of government. The election is not about electing Trump or Biden. It is about the hundreds of federal judges who POTUS appoints and interpret laws as they see fit
Listen, if Cruisin’ Joe Biden is able hurt God, then do you really want to vote against him?
Joe "All black people think the same" Biden
*whispers* you really don't want to vote for Biden but might do so grudgingly if he makes a choice that you want to see happen
I will vote for Joe Biden if his veep pick is the first grade teacher who yelled at me for coloring a worksheet with pencils.
Trump keeps sharing a photo of Biden praying, then says he's against god?
If you want Jaime Harrison and Amy McGrath to win their Senate races, you’re gonna need enthusiastic, overwhelming turnout from all walks of the Democratic Party. And there’s only one VP candidate who can bring those that Biden hasn’t already brought. #WarrenForVP

omfg that joe biden video..... guillotine
You mean Biden, right!
Seems pretty good. Biden’s a little low in arizona, I thought he would be +4
Lol. You are seriously going to vote for the #racist #antisemitic #Democrat party. You can see in the #Democrats ruled cities how the #USA will be destroyed if #Biden will be elected.
There is only one #racist #antisemitic party of hate and thats the #Biden #Democrat #IlhanOmar party. See whats happening in the cities runned by the #Democrats and you can envision the #USA future if Biden will win.
What a stupid remark. #covid is impacting the world economy everywhere. The #Democrats are destroying the #USA now. The toplist of unemployment is led by #Democrat cities, the crime rate is exploding in the #police defunded cities etc. #Biden #Trump
Tell that to Biden's eventual, likely black, VP candidate.
Robin Williams in 2009 about #Biden.....and things didnt go better since then😱😉. #Democrat #Democrats
Don't think for a minute that Joe Biden actually *wants* to be President. His behavior over the past six months makes SO much more sense when you realize that winning the November election is the LAST thing he wants to do!!!

Karen Bass will be "out" bcs Biden needs Florida and her few gestures of solidarity w Cuban ppl will be intensely used against her. I'm betting on Rice, whom Biden knows well.
HKS's  says the Biden campaign should be paying the most attention to this question:   If history calls, will his vice president have the capacity and talent to become a first-class president?
It seems like the reasoning behind it is insulting (and racist, obvi)? Like, the thinking is if they put forward a popular Black person as a candidate that Black people will be more likely to vote for them than for Biden? They think Black people arent aware of their own interests
“Deridin’ Biden. Taking it to the Streets!”
I think they’re saying that “for some absurd reason Bernie left the race and now we’re stuck with Trump will kill us quicker or Biden is so useless.” Also, “it is so bad but what the hell else can anyone do? Just get rid of the Cheeto scum and then be Deridin’ Biden.” I guess.
My dream for the 2020 election is for Joe Biden to use the phrase and acknowledge environmental racism.
They are going to make a hero out of a Midwest-hunter-diner regular who uncovers a Norwegian plot to elect Biden.
The Biden campaign is looking at VP candidates through many lenses, but there is really just one question that should drive the decision, says
Joe Biden launches new national ad aimed at Black Americans
Even more disgusting is that the Repugs not up for reelection are already preparing to return to the BS slinging, fake outrage, obstructionist little gnats they were under Obama. No help for Americans! Trump's going down, so they want death &amp; a depression when Biden takes over.
If this is Biden implicitly giving his approval, fine. If it is Biden signalling that any U.S. Attorney who goes after Trump is on their own and won't get any political cover, that seems like a recipe for continued lack of accountability.
The most unpredictable presidential election of our lifetime. Biden VP choice likely more impactful to race than any VP choice in recent memory.   #Trump #Biden #bidenvp #COVID19 #COVID__19 #MailInVoting #polling
Biden won’t do it but i have faith that President Harris will
Biden is only the nominee because those fuckers think they have us over a barrel with Trump. But we’re the ones with the votes, which means WE have the power, if we exercise it
I’m not voting for Biden. If enough of us commit to not voting for Biden, maybe we won’t have to.  I’ve started making the arument here:
still can't get "the goods" on Joe Biden or Obama for "spying" on the Trump campaign.  Sally Yates stood up for the law and facts, and all LG got was that Comey was a dick.
Just saw his Hunter Biden joke- I did a real lol 🤣
To all the critics of how Biden speaks.
Flipping PA, MI, and either WI or AZ is enough to give Biden a victory in the Electoral College. In that scenario neither FL nor NC matters.
Biden wants to publically smash trump and that ego move may be a mistake. Here we go...😒😣
It's simple Sean. Biden stays quiet and Trump drop 5 points nationally: rinse, repeat!
Biden knows that he'll perform better in a debate than Trump, but Trump and the Trump campaign don't. That's a tremendous edge (expectations game) that he might give up if he agreed to another debate since it would signal that he's confident and might wake the Trump team up.
That will come either way. The genie's out of the bottle. Material conditions are so bad that there's no going back to sleep for tens of millions. They can't. They don't have the wherewithal. We're too far down the path and Biden won't try to fix it.
Liberals are going to be so confused when and if Biden enters office and the protests don't stop. "But Trump is gone!" Yeah. And Black people are still being targeted by the police. And now it's Biden bolstering them.
I know politicians have to (or feel like they have to) play this game. But Biden isn't going to budge an inch on any substantive issue. They need to sell him as "not Trump" and hope it works better than in 2016. Nobody buys this narrative except Republicans.
At this rate--and it is wishful thinking that the rate won't go up--we are looking at ~235,000 new deaths by inauguration day, and thus closing in on 400,000 total deaths.  I hope Joe Biden has a plan for Day One.
the fact that Settle for Biden is an unironic account is... wild
Could Biden sue E! for equal free airtime since they play KUWTK daily? Or ban the show till after the election.
The longest recession in history inherited by Trump. Mr Biden has memory lapse.
Bass isn’t going to be and shouldn’t be Biden’s pick but...
Kanye is an op. Nothing more than being used by republicans as an op to take votes from Biden.
Lol I actually really like Biden
I don't understand how black people can support Joe "YOU AINT BLACK" Biden when he's clearly a white supremacist and pedophile while lambasting Kanye West because he's a successful businessman and father. This is just another liberal machination to discredit our heroes. Smh!
What would you say Biden's national popular vote margin needs to be for Jones to have a chance in AL
Except for Hannity and right wing radio, how will Trump’s nasty made-up talking point about Biden’s age get out now while Trump, seen everyday on all media outlets, reveal his mental decline. How else to explain his expectation the Coronavirus will “magically disappear”?
It is time to have a woman in power! I know the ⁦ will share the power with his V.P.!
Fully plays in to the Diamond Joe parody. Who doesn't like this? Like, can't the guy have a personality?
JOE BIDEN WON
Joe Biden is literally a left leaning Republican
Biden is a pragmatic technocrat moderate. You’re simply a far right Trump supporter. You can drop the façade. You understand we can actually see your Laura Ingram retweets right?
Huh. Another poll that moves towards Biden when it becomes more restrictive.
"Trump campaign ad against Joe Biden contains a number of doctored images, CNN and WaPo report"
"Biden" looks nice, and seems to have eaten his spaghetti and meatballs!
He will not release the tax returns but even with the tax returns I would not encourage Joe Biden to take the stage with this habitual liar
"No tax returns, no debate" should be Biden's mantra.
We need 270 electoral votes.  For every "progressive" waffler right now, there are 5-10 African-Americans/NeverTrumpers/etc. in NC/FL/AZ/WI/PA/GA/TX/etc. we can get to polls to vote for Biden before we can get a "progressive."
Also, Joe Biden is winning certain states -- e.g., VA -- by margins unseen by Democrats.  I mean -- Barack Obama was the first Dem in 44 years to win VA at the Presidential level.  It's still hard to believe as a VA native that Old Dominion is completely off the table *for Rs.*
Republicans have a clear favorite for Biden’s running mate  HE SHOULD PICK KAMALA HARRIS INSTEAD SHE'S GOING TO GET THE 🤡 IN THE WH.
I realize that it is 2020 now, but I am still unable to watch this video of Joe Biden driving a car without thinking about how Mitt Romney said we should “let Detroit go bankrupt.”
biden does get intel briefings now
If Biden is +15% nationally *maybe* Indiana in in play? It would take a pretty big polling error from the 8-9% they are showing now
My own estimate is Biden+7.3 nationally, though the differences are primarily in how we adjust polls for time and partisan lean.  I estimate Biden wins 348.1 EV: basically Clinton states + MI, PA, WI, FL, AZ, NC and one of OH/GA.  #2020Elections #polls
It’s simply a ploy to try and drive young voters to move to vote for Kanye and not vote for Biden. So patently obvious.
Never said otherwise, but not every female candidate will shore up Biden’s weaknesses. Kaine didn’t shore up Clinton’s weaknesses.
Joe Biden is Catholic.
It’s like Biden made a commercial for me specifically.   That is a gorgeous Corvette and it’s in amazing shape.
..also, per postal workers endorsing Biden: 1. Of course; Trump is trying to eliminate the Postal Svs by driving it into the ground, 2. The Postmaster Gen is a Trump donor who is intentionally dismantling the PO w new policies that slow down and disrupt Svs. Which is worse?
For everyone saying he’s had a stutter for a long time, yes you’re right but clearly it’s more than just a stutter now, he can barely finish a sentence. In this video from 1993 you can see he has a minor stutter, but is 10x more coherent.
If history is a guide, Biden’s VP pick has a 1 in 3 chance of becoming President someday. Since WWII's final days, we have had 15 VPs, of whom 5 eventually reached the Oval Office. Key question for Biden is thus: who is best fit to be a future President?
As if you needed another reason to not vote for Joe Biden. Like, seriously, who is this even for? Where is the mythical voter who would have voted for Trump but decided to vote for Biden instead because he promised to grab guns?
seriously, they should be allowed exhibits including slides &amp; video.  Trump will lie every time he opens his mouth and rather than watch them accuse each other of lying the whole time, Biden should be able to show video or quotes of trump speaking or fact checks to prove the lies
Richard Behar wrote this piece  on VP contender Bass and his deep knowledge of #Scientology. Since Bass is supposedly still being considered, I wanted to weigh in with support for this article.
Opinion | Trump’s convention speech will be the epitome of narcissism. Biden’s will be the opposite. - The Washington Post
I'm hoping that biden doesn't announce his VP pick too closely to it.. I don't want one to overshadow the other
tldr the world is horrible and Biden is my solid backup, but my first-place vote still goes to Giant World-Bashing Meteor.
you see this? How in the fucking fuck is he the guy? This is mental.
Census Bureau turnouts for Wisconsin among Blacks "alone or in combination"  2012:  192,000 2016:  104,000    Biden will win 90% of Blacks in November. Where is that 100,000 for West going to come from?
Dude he’s absolutely COOKED! It’s honestly tough to watch at times, I’m not a massive Trump guy or politics guy at all but the Biden situation is insanity he literally cannot speak anymore. “I’m forward looking to debating him” &amp; that CREEPY ass laugh wtf 🤦‍♂️
It’s absolutely terrifying that your Dad has control of the “nuclear football”. I look forward to January 2021 when your Dad is out on the street and no longer one of the biggest threats to our country and democracy. Biden, while not perfect, is 1000 times better than your Dad.
Duh 🤦‍♀️. Just dawned on me he is referring to Biden
Oh no, Biden’s done for.
4 years ago👇🏿.Keep the hard work up!
I know.  I'm originally from there.  Biden is about the best possible Democratic candidate for NoVA and Trump is about the worst possible Republican candidate for NoVA.
This is why many delegates of Biden, Warren, and Bernie are voting “NO” on the Democratic Party platform. It is time for M4A. Please let other Warren delegates know! #M4AllNow
I’m all for doing everything we can but when the nomination wasn’t locked up coronavirus didn’t seem to matter.
while our candidate is out and about, making a total fool of himself and his country, joe biden is sitting in his basement being innocuous
Dan Carpenter outlines a Dem. response if Rep. Govs/Secretaries refused to certify their states' electors, preventing Biden from reaching 270 EC votes. Useful to show there is a response; also pretty clear Rs would be triggering constitutional crisis...
Ah, I thought it was about the women, not about Biden. Probably my brain's grammar module misfired onto Spanish adjective order. Makes sense.
I think there should be a virtual debate between Biden &amp; Trump. Is the old toddler “Romper Room” set available? Maybe instead of a debate we could just hold a joint cognitive function evaluation.  Oops, maybe keep notTrump in his man cave as much as possible. Prime Time is scary!
How certain for candidate?                                          Trump     Biden Certain to vote for       38%        36% Likely to vote for          12            12 Not likely to vote for   51            53
I saw Oprah trending and for a moment seriously considered that perhaps she was Biden’s VP pick.
Re-elections aren't about who the challenger picks as her/his/their VP.  Re-elections are referendums on the incumbent's conduct and performance in office.  This election will not be about Joe Biden's VP pick -- it will be about Donald Trump's conduct and performance in office.
Joe Biden’s campaign logo is a nice circle but it should have been designed to look like a “Reset” button or a “Ctrl+Z.”Biden apparently thinks every black person was brought over on a boat
US intelligence warns of election interference, says Russia is trying to denigrate Biden, China wants Trump to lose
Mr.Biden I can’t donate any money because I don’t have any since losing my job but I can volunteer I’ll do anything that’s asked of me!!!
Peter Lucas: Adopting many of Sanders’ policy decisions makes Biden a ‘Bernie Bro’
Wrong! Biden directed the place to make them available but there was a National Security concern.
Biden was accused ( after being VP for 8 yrs without being accused) &amp; there wasn’t any back up. Trump has 45 sexual harassment allegations against him &amp; a woman fighting to get his DNA prior to the election. Clinton’s allegations came out after he was elected, but not ok
I’m supporting Joe Biden for president because he’ll be a steadfast advocate for our nation’s public school students and educators.   Will you pledge to support Joe, too?
It’s weird Geraldo would bring attention to Trump and him being friends and then pretend he wants to honestly interview Biden.
If it's fair why use this as a stupid "gotcha?" We can't if people like you are lying about Biden and depressing turnout like "progressives" did in 2016, 2010 and 2000.
If you're looking for solutions you also don't start by saying Biden doesn't believe in policies he has already released or that "moderate" democrats are responsible for things the GOP did. The main thrust seems to be that we have Trump because Democrats didn't stop the GOP.
Now we know that no matter what we do it is never enough. Vote for Biden, good, but this "no excitement" talk is designed to hurt him and hurt Democrats. If you think that helps progress you're a damn fool.
Except that the Obama/Biden Administration brought the Economy back after Bush killed it. You want to explain that Donnie?
Biden has an aggressive climate change policy that he has already released. Democrats have been for "taxing the rich" my whole life! You live in a world of false conflict between moderates and progressives when the real conflict is Democrat versus Republican.
Which policies of biden's can you sell me on?
How exactly will Biden lock us up? That doesn’t even make sense.  Start prepping your resume. Come 01.21.21 you will be out of a job. I’m sure there is another lying, narcissistic buffoon who needs you to cover for them. Good luck!
I will vote for Biden at 40% than the Narcissist at 100%
Yes it does. At least for president. I get you hate Trump. But never Trump = Biden is president.
Don’t forget Biden hates “energy” too.
Ben Shapiro warns Biden 'falling apart' after bizarre interview, would be 'ripped up and down' if Republican  #FoxNews
I been trying to wrap my head around it. I severely dislike Biden. But also I'll be damned.
But Laura Ingraham said Biden was faltering in the Swing State of Iowa.
Biden doesn’t want to debate Trump because he might lose. He won’t meet the challenge and lacks character Everyday, we are in debate or conflict with each other, our work, local politics. We are expected to show-up. Is that an example for your children.
DO ALL OF U REALIZE THE MILLIONS TAXPAYERS HAVE BEEN PAYING 4 TRUMPS RE-ELECTION CAMPAIGN!  WTF IS GOING ON? WHERE IS THE LINE BETWEEN GOVT BUSINESS &amp; A VERBAL ASSAULT ON JOE BIDEN! TRUMP TALKS ABT JOE &amp; HIS ELECTION  EVERYTIME HES ON CAMERA &amp; WE PAY! WHATTA DAMN' MOOCHER HE IS!
Riden with Biden!!!!
Instead of trying to scare people with ridiculous lies about Biden. Why don't you actually tell people what you have done and what you are going to actually do for this country to get people to vote for you. Oh yeah you can't because you have done nothing and will do nothing.
Any chance that the Orange One can recite the Apostles' Creed? I bet Biden can recite it in English AND Latin.
I was a E Warren supporter.  Still am.  But I will get behind Biden to make sure trump does not get another term.  I'm fine with my self reflection.
You are turning people away from Biden - people who will either not vote at all or who will vote for a 3rd party candidate. Both are votes for trump. I'm serious-how does that help? How does 4 more yrs of trump help your cause?
Joe Biden's Democratic presidential campaign has launched a new national ad focused on Black Americans, urging them to stand up to President Donald Trump the way their ancestors stood up to "violent racists of a generation ago."
I think Kanye pulls more votes away from Biden than from Trump.  Black Americans are generally more conservative than the Democratic party, but they have a lot of party loyalty.  If they can't make the jump to Trump, at least they have an option for not voting Biden.
No hoopla: Virus upends Trump and Biden convention plans
Bidebn's dementia seems to lack the depth of corruption that Trump's has. Plus Biden's explanations of his own actions don't change as wildly in short periods of time.  So, to me, Biden appears to be the "less bad" choice.
Let me double down on what you are getting at:  People need to vote. En masse. For Joe Biden.  Do not vote third party in this election.  Do not vote for George Washington or Jesus or Mickey Mouse.  Your vote matters in this election more than ever.
Swalwell, Hirono, Cicilline, Nadler, Schumer, Pelosi, Hillary, Obama, Jayapal, Lieu, AOC, Tlaib, Omar, Newsom, Clyburn, Kamala, Biden, Mad Max, Presley, Lemon, my brother in law....
Biden has a stutter,what’s tRumps excuse?
Biden on Wednesday said that in his first 100 days in office he'd create a national police oversight commission with civil rights leaders, police officers, police chiefs and other criminal justice experts to consider police reforms, including hiring, training and de-escalation...
They aren’t practicable. Having a lot of long policie wants without actual mechanisms to enforce them is exactly what you’re knocking Biden for.
Biden will be what, 81 in 2024? He’s probably not worrying about a primary in 2024 because one way or another he won’t be running.
JOE BIDEN HAS SPENT 50 years on a GOVERNMENT PAYROLL! HE NEVER WORKED IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR! THAT WON’T FLY IN THE RUSTBELT (OHIO, MICHIGAN, WISCONSIN, PENNSYLVANIA) AMERICAN PEOPLE WANT TO RANGE THEIR FULL POTENTIAL! 🇺🇸 #HIPHOPREPUBLICANS #MaPoli #TheRoadtotheWhiteHouse #Bospoli
Kanye is there for people who despise Trump but are not Biden fans.  Just for fun they will vote for him
Like everywhere else in the country, in the more rural areas of the state, Trump definitely has more, but in the more urban areas, (here that would be cities like Manchester and Nashua), it’s more split, with Biden having a few more.  At least from my observations
I like your optimism about New Hampshire, but as one who lives just over the border from there, I see an awful lot of Biden signs up there. Signs are split pretty evenly between him and Trump.
Biden grew testy when CBS News correspondent Errol Barnett asked the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee about the matter in a recent interview.
Joe Biden will not travel to Milwaukee to accept the Democratic presidential nomination because of concerns over the coronavirus, party officials said Wednesday, signaling a move to a convention that essentially has become entirely virtual.
Joe Biden does not have to knock on doors and donny’s campaign is GRASPING AT STRAWS!!!!
Joe Biden doesn't need those tests. He's as sharp as a tack. Donny Boy, on the other hand, struggles with easy words like Oranges and Yosemite.... There's a real problem going on there. Donny's only running on 2 cylinders.
You realize this applies to Daddy, not Biden, right? Oh, never mind...
Congratulations! You got more votes than Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders, combined!   Carry this momentum into November and onto victory.
people are obsessed with Biden's VP pick because it's a slow news cycle.
The thing that struck out to me wasn't anything racial, it was how out of touch Biden is.  Literally every job I've gotten required a drug test.
A little late but I just finished reading  book Doing Justice.  Loved it.  Would not mind seeing him as AG in a Biden administration!!
yeah, as someone not intimately involved with Green Party internal politics, I don't quite grasp what was not kosher about Howie's actions. If we had any other viable left option I'd worry more about it, but Biden and Trump are straight out, and Jo Jorgenson is def a R Lib.
When are they going to interview Joe Biden ?
I voted for Stein last time never dreaming that we were dumb enough to elect Trump. I want Trump out and the best option is Biden no matter how unpalatable.#BernieShouldaWon
Biden hasn't even campaigned and he's crucifying Trump.  I think we could've put a monkey against Trump and it would've won.
If Biden wins the tone of coverage will change on covid. The science won't change but you'll see more optimistic outlooks on it
has the audacity to apologize and to modernize his stance when pressured to do so by progressives. Guess who else does that, but is reluctant to give in? Joe Biden
National Democrats chastise Ed Markey for being in office for too long, voting for the Iraq War, Crime Bill, and opposing busing. But when Joe Biden, their presidential candidate, is asked about these votes, they are quick to defend him.  Yeah he made some shitty votes but Ed
Jill Biden dismisses Trump's attacks on her husband's mental fitness  via
Yeah he backed Biden because he was going to win the nomination anyways.
I’m sick and tired of this idea that we have to pick a side. My sister likes Trump and her AR-15. She’s gonna teach my daughter to shoot it.  Nothing you or the internet or Trump or Biden ever tells me will overcome my 42 years of living and seeing how good and kind she is.
Wow I can’t believe Biden chose Tiffany Pollard as his VP
I, a conservative since the late 1970s, plan to vote for Biden if the coronavirus doesn't get me first. (I'm very high risk)
I like when MAGA people call Biden mentally incompetent but have Trump as their Lord and savior. Trump isn't exactly kicking down the doors at Mensa
Mr. Biden I received my application for mail in ballot, I much rather go to the polls and vote much to the objection of my wife who worries due to my respiratory problems.   Any advice would be appreciated.
It's about the economy stupid! #VoteTrump2020
Smile more? Some critics see sexism in debate over Biden VP
I think the return of the Covid briefings are helping, too. And I think people  are getting a little nervous about Biden the more they learn about him and his positions, and the more the civil unrest continues. Anything can happen now.  It’s a toss-up at this point.
I still have to give the edge to Biden in the #PresidentialElection,  but Trump has certainly narrowed the gap.  Battleground state polls are tightening.  The change in leadership at the top of the campaign has seemed to help; more serious, focused relevant messaging
Joe Biden takes this Pandemic seriously unlike Trump &amp; complies with the CDC Guidelines. That makes him a LEADER!
The Great Awakening has begun! The people from coast to coast are realizing Sleepy Slow Joe Biden isn’t capable of leading the nearest country club let alone the most powerful nation on earth!  is the only choice for President! #Trump2020Landslide
This guy’s about 2 cheeseburgers away from a stroke and their worried about Biden. Doctors describe him as obese and that’s being kind.
I’d love the neoliberals to name one reason why I should vote for Biden WITHOUT mentioning Trump or Obama.
Mr. Joe Biden do not give trump what he wants, no debates YOU DON’T NEED TO!!!
#WomenAgainstTrump because Creepy Joe is great with women!  I wonder how many voters have flipped after hearing the "I'll vote for Biden even if he's a rapist" argument?
Hey, if you can't bring yourself to vote for Biden, AT LEAST please don't vote for Trump again.
Biden isn’t a Traitor or mass murderer, 45* is both. #TrumpOwnsEveryDeath
The articles point that Biden never should have promised to make the VP a woman as it undercuts the choice is valid. However, he said it, and having done so, he should stick to it.  But mostly he should drop out and let a non senile, non racist, non rapist head the ticket.
Working with biden to get nothing for the working class and poor done and deliver platitudes?
And Trump is the one who would lie in a debate? Biden is about as dishonest as they come
Who should Joe Biden select as his V.P. running mate?
will win the 2020 election in a landslide.  Biden is a joke. We got at least 12 more years of Republican rule in the White House.  Mark this tweet. #sundayvibes #Trump2020Landslide
Biden and Marxism don’t go together man.
Slidin’ Biden the Great White Dope
Man, Biden could not debate the squirrel in his backyard.
biden would do nearly the same fascist things as trump except in a more discreet manner lmao. its not a notable contrast
this implies that biden is not racist
People change Jacquetta. If Joe Biden can change his stance on issues over time, Ed can change his stance on issues as well.
Of course they did. The deficit is now suddenly very concerning. They made their $$ with the tax cut and illegal stock transactions, time to tighten the belt. Can’t see the forest thru the trees. No $$ 4 the unemployed, economy only goes ⬇️ just in time for Biden
We have a Traitorous Mass Murderer the White House, just sayin’. A Biden President will be a lot better.
hey Rubio in three months your worst nightmare will come to fruition and ONLY THEN WILL OUR GREAT COUNTRY BEGIN TO HEAL AND COME TOGETHER AS ONE UNDER THE LEADERSHIP OF JOE BIDEN!!!!
Reporters won't see Trump renomination because he isn't going to be renominated. It's as simple as that. After 155,000 dead Americans caused by the lack of leadership of one Donald Trump, Biden will be the winner, and he will win big!!!
Why not do it now, Trump is going to crush Biden
Even if that happens Biden won't be inaugurated till January 20.
For  supporters,  does  seem like a candidate who will work to make the needed changes? Not clear what Biden stands for.
As a  supporter,  should I feel good about voting for  Is there anything more than Not Trump? What is Biden going to do? A shadow of Obama doesn't cut it.
You have to wait till Inaugurate Joe Biden.
If Biden is elected, there will be a viral pandemic.
For Trump, but even if I am sick of his tweets, Biden is not an option, especially now that the socialists are controlling him
Born November 20, 1942:  Garcia’s brainless, synthetic, and he’s not hiding/That he’s frequently mistaken for Joe Biden. #JustSaying
Great thread about why Biden's choice for Vice President matters.
Hunter Biden and Chelsea Clinton have the equivalent of three Graduate degrees between them. The Trump kids have three bachelor's degrees.   Their educations are not level.
Stop making excuses for them. It's always something: If Obama is elected, it will be a disaster! If Hillary is elected, it will be a disaster! If Biden is elected, it will be a disaster! With these people, any Dem victory is a disaster. So they're in permanent hysteria.
Biden is not a socialist. Remember also that Obama had things his way for less than TWO years before the GOP won the midterm elections in 2010. Whenever a president is perceived as overreaching, the voters react. They did in 2010. They also did in 2018. They may in 2022.
So, for those who ask could Joe #Biden debate  could #Frump debate Anthony #Fauci?? #covid #covid19 #oranfeisnotthenewblack #loveyoubutilovedataandsciencemore
#YesWeCanAgain will get Joe Biden thinking he can sniff more kids.
I oppose Trump *because* I am still a conservative. I don't support the Dem platform. Once Biden is elected, we can go back to our role as "the loyal opposition."
go phonebank for Biden then.   biden was supposed to be the most electable, if his own policies decisions are hurting his chances maybe yknow.. think about what that means.
hey look, biden was the Most Electable, so i guess the truth shouldn't hurt him right?
You are correct. Biden needs come down on the right side of this and that's to choose Kamala.
I want Biden’s VP to be the next President. I want Biden to fill his cabinet with people under 50 who can help repair the damage to our country.
Yeah, a Biden blowout is going to disguise the extent to which places like Minneapolis and Maine have become swing states despite a long string of D wins.
#BernieBros still don't get it! The electorate doesn't want your kind of divisiveness. Either participate or go home.  Biden, Bernie forces clash during convention meeting  via
Well obviously we’re just having a cultural misunderstanding here. We liberal coastal elites don’t understand what Joe means by “vote for” or “Biden” and “Trump.” This is one of those off color jokes maybe.
I don't think Biden would be able to figure out how to post a message tbh
Trump and Biden are both authoritarians. It is happening here.
The politics of the American liberals and Democratic Party will get appreciably *worse* if/when Biden wins.
"progressives"  Biden won't be getting my vote. If Dems come to their senses, and he drops out at the convention and is replaced with someone less heinous, maybe I will vote blue. Otherwise, I am voting for Green candidate
what you described does not mean Joe Biden
But Biden just stayed in.
Blah was and now with Biden's pick he lost all the on the fence moderates. Another 4 yrs for you guys to complain. You can't live in the past be ready for another 4 years
Does anyone doubt that he won’t be attending Biden’s Inauguration?
I've donated to Howie Hawkins, Vermin Supreme, Bernie Sanders, and Ed Markey. Today I got an email from Joe Biden asking me for money. Who the fuck gave him my e-mail!?!  Probably Markey, tbh. I still support him, but :/
Right listen to Trump suggesting you believe a doctor who says alien DNA cures corona virus. You are sooo much smarter than Biden
Did Nancy Pelosi, Joe Biden, James CLYBOURNE?
Keep traveling the country without a mask like the rest of your Republican buddies an the election of Biden is a given.
I only know of one autocrat that forced women and children into buildings and lied about what was going to happen. Children can't vote, most women will not vote for you and the older folks have switched over to Biden. You hang back when needed - jump in at the end to stir the pot
Our whole country is a death cult. How many died cuz of Biden pushing for the primaries in WA, FL, AS, and WI? How many have died just because of our governments bipartisan refusal to properly support people or fund PPE and testing?
President Donald Trump and his Democratic challenger, Joe Biden, both promise sweeping progress over the next four years –- via starkly different paths.
Inspires his players like Biden inspires the American people.... A total drip and not the right coach or candidate for the job
This is such the opposite of truth it hurts.  Thinking Biden is an accetable option is the privileged position. The Democrats are enabling Trump's fascism. Electing Biden isn't gonna stop America's fall into totalitarianism.
democrats are funding Trump's fascism and doing nothing for the poor. If Trump wants to bribe people to win the election 🤷‍♀️ at least people will be able to eat. Things won't get any better under Biden, either.
Exactly. I wish she had gotten the nomination and not Biden. Been a fan of her for 3 years. Definitely voting for Biden, but she was my first choice.
Tell Biden to eat a pint Ben and Jerry’s
I’m not about to. I don’t know who he is and I don’t care. POTUS is posting racist shit as he brags about repealing an Obama/Biden era affordable housing policy but they’re the same side‽
don’t tell anyone but i’m biden’s VP pick
Biden is not left
Say what you will about Joe Biden being a Trojan Horse, you can't deny that he's going senile.   What sort of presidential candidate has to be led by his hand so he doesn't say something stupid to the press? Is hand-holder lady going to save him from the debates with Trump too?
Also "represent the worker" since the DNC and Biden have been focused on women and BIPOC civil rights he clearly means white men. That's what this language has always meant.
President Donald Trump is painting a dystopian portrait of what Joe Biden’s America might look like, asserting crime and chaos would ravage communities should the former vice president win the White House in November.So hopefully China helps out Biden as much as Russia is helping Trump then
Never Trump = Joe Biden!!!! Why would any level headed Republican want that! If we lose the White House we are screwed for not only the next 4 yrs but i am sure it will be even longer! #VoteTrump2020
I honestly don't get WHY Rice is even in the running. As a Progressive, voting for Biden will be hard enough, although he'll be my LAST choice of my ranked choice vote here in Maine, if he picks Rice, it's going to be even harder...
LMAO. Trump is the one that won't agree. Biden has already agreed. Biden is a very good one on one debater (destroyed Bernie) and Trump is one of the worst debaters in modern history.  Awful take here. Just like most recent column about cognitive testing....awful. clear agenda.
Biden walks back African American 'diversity' remarks, lauds community's 'diversity of thought'
So if Kanye is no longer down with trump why would he steal votes from Biden and help re-elect trump? Makes no sense. Also he’s probably gonna see 1% of votes if he’s lucky
Good Grief... Exclusive: Kanye West Indicates That His Spoiler Campaign Is Indeed Designed To Hurt Biden via
You haven’t even considered what state we might live in and how irrelevant our vote for biden would be in the long run. I’m voting bernie bc delegates might matter
what the FUCK is this man saying? please settle for biden 😌✨
I still believe Biden is only paying lip service to progressives for votes...
Did Biden say that??
Joe Biden is a racist his VP pick will be the new president. That’s if Biden gets elected. Welcome to communism USA thanks Democrats
100% correct.  She is not Blue.  She has fought it get Nancy out.  That right there is enough to show she is not a Dem.  She would NEVER get my vote either.
Biden is going to eat him alive.
He destroyed Bernie in that debate.  Biden is a very good one on one debater, and Trump is one of the worst debaters in modern history.
I think the left would be better off with Biden as president because 1. Less likely to get sent to camps 2. Marginally better policies 3. Everything still sucking would prove our point that about capitalism being the root cause
I have little to no faith that the underlying systems will change with someone like Biden in charge. He's a status quo, establishment, neo-liberal.  There are reason's why he was installed as the nominee, just like Hillary was installed.
Jesse Watters is an ignorant, arrogant fool. I’ll truly look forward to hearing less of him once Biden wins.
Repeat after me, You ARE A FRAUD.  U told TARA READE 'i hear u Tara'  Joe Biden doesn't need frauds like you.  You are not welcome here with us.  Bye.
When will Bernie people realize that he lost...twice?  Biden should listen and engage with them but they don't get to call the shots
Pay ATTENTION PEOPLE
Seriously??
THIS IS AN INCREDIBLE ARTICLE BY PATRICIA DICKSON, ON HOW BIDEN IS SO DISMISSIVE OF BLACK PEOPLE. THE DEMOCRATS THINK THEY HAVE THE ELECTION IN THE BAG. SHE BELIEVES BECAUSE NO ONE IS SPEAKING ABOUT EVERYTHING THAT IS GOING ON, THAT BLACK PEOPLE CANT SEE WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE!
How in the world can anyone vote 4 Biden. I truly believe what ur guest said + I said this before. People are so scared to say anything, let alone say they are voting 4 TRUMP! #scaredinamericia
LETS NOT FORGET IT WAS ONLY 5 MONTHS AGO! TRUMP WILL TURN THIS ECONOMY RIGHT AROUND. HE WILL KEEP HIS PROMISES LIKE HE DID FIRST ELECTION. MAKE NO MISTAKE, BIDEN WILL NOT BE SERVING OUR COUNTRY. IT WILL TURN INTO VENEZUELA!
HE IS LITERALLY RUINING DOWN A CAMPAIGN SPEECH THAT BIDEN COULD NEVER ACCOMPLISH. AFTER HIS FAILED ADMINISTRATION HE HAS ALOT OF NERVE. WORST PRESIDENT EVER. STOKING THE FIRE FOR RIOTERS. SCUMBAG!
CAN'T BELIEVE OBAMA IS USING JOHN LEWIS EULOGY TO ACT LIKE HE IS RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT SAYING THAT THE POLICE ARE ASSULTING QUITE DEMONSTRATORS! WHAT A FUCKING DIRTY MOVE. THAN SAYING THE ONES ON THE OTHER SIDE. JUST SAY IT BARRY THE REBLICANS. YOU NEED TO  DO WHAT BIDEN CAN'T.
It’s about time Kaepernick got some credit for standing up for what he believed in and after this Unpresidential president is voted out of office Biden should acknowledge him with The medal of freedom
She did say she's voting for him, but only as an anti-Trump vote. I feel like most people should understand that, considering A) she lives in a swing state B) Biden insults her and her family with his anti-Palestinean stances, nvm other progressive issuesIdk ab y’all but I don’t think just voting for Biden to “just get trump out” is smart. We shouldn’t be voting like that
You are all racists  Joe Biden is goin to win in November ... 2nd place!
Getting ready for the left if Biden  gets elected and his pukes try to come for us!
To the Biden Campaign: If you support what God says is sin then you are against God.   Duh!
I had those very thoughts. How you think so do you write. No way Biden wrote the explanation.   So as he speaks, so will he write. Birripbirripbirrip, “that’s all folks.”  For those of you who weren’t around, look up Porky Pig! 😂
He isn’t talking about the culture , but political views , he didn’t say all black people are the same Hence “notable exceptions”  This is what Trump wants you guys to believe smh hear Biden’s statement
It's just incredibly sad that right-wing nut jobs are using #Extortion17 in a bullshit attack on Biden.  Those soldiers deserve better.
If #Biden could take down that bad dude #CornPop you damn well know he can “hurt god.” I’m voting #Libertarian but - Maybe we need a #POTUS who can knock out that crazy old wizard in the sky. #Thighland #badgrandpa
That would leave Pence (who worries me greatly). I'd really like to see trump humiliated and emasculated with a resounding Biden victory. We will pay a very heavy price daily with trump in office....sigh.
Sources say Biden made his choice, tonight. I hope for a big Friday night announcement!
I don’t think it’ll be Whitmer. Biden doesn’t want African Americans, the left, and the media totally distracting the campaign with the ‘why didn’t you feel it necessary to pick a WOC’ question, especially with the BLM movement coming to the forefront this campaign season.
And y'all still wanna come for Trump lol. Good job Biden. #BidenIsARacist
A whole load of nonsense, as usual. No plan, no concept, no bloody idea about anything. I am so frickin tired of the rambling. I’m breathless.
Beware these Never Trumpers. Just want our help to get rid of Trump for them, but the second Biden’s in office they’ll be attacking him with garbage. Goal is 22 midterms. Don’t trust them for a second, they created the environment for Trump to swoop in.
County Illinois. Never before now, NEVER, has winning the election been more important than anything else. My goal is to choose the person who will get votes, and help Biden defeat this fascist monster. Thus, my three points.
These Never Trumper ghouls just want the D’s to get rid of Trump for them, &amp; the second Biden’s in office they go back on the attack full throttle to take back the House &amp; Senate in 22. It’s so disingenuous.
#Pompeo's a joke   Appalled to see  put Sachs on shortlist for Biden econ team  &amp; the (usually great)  served up nothing but softballs to Sachs on hr-long    #Barr excoriates U.S. Biz re China (the real villains):
I think it was in this same interview, the reporter asked if he’d take a cognitive test to show that he doesn’t have dementia or anything and Biden legit asked if the reporter was a crack head
I’d like it on the record that I’m in favor of hurting god. I’m not sure if this is even possible or even if they even exist.   That being said   I know Joe Biden is not in favor of hurting god, but I would just like Twitter to know MY position on the matter.
Should decline or halt should Biden wins..
Chip in to elect Joe Biden and other Democrats on the ballot
question for the only 2 military men I know.  If Biden wins, will he apologize to Japan on the 70th anniversary next August for dropping the bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki?
So a Trump Biden debate would be unintelligible.

Holy crap all u Never Trumpers are going to vote for him anyway. I don’t trust u for a second. If Biden gets to office u will be in attack mode instantly. Get rid of Trump yourself.
He is against Kamala..that is why he is supporting this..
Biden was the moderate, thank you black voters in the south and the influence of Clyburn’s endorsement. We need someone to bring in the progressive wing, and it’s Warren. Also, Clyburn very recently made it clear that the VP pick doesn’t have to be a black woman... 🤔
Biden can't wait to see who he picked for VP 😢😢😢
I bet Biden will read his intelligence briefs.
Biden has a way of smiling/laughing at the foolishness of other candidates during debates. I have a feeling this will get under Trump’s skin. Biden won’t take his bait, and will hammer that SOB into the ground with stats and figures. Plus, insults won’t work well with Covid 💀
🌹 twitter did the same thing when it was down to Bernie and Biden. They said Biden would pull out because he had dementia/was senile. He walked on stage, completed sentences, and bam, Biden was declared the winner and he went on to win Michigan the next week. Underestimate him!
I’ve been thinking the same thing. Ore he’ll do the first debate with Chris Wallace, do horribly, get owned by Biden, and then say the Fake News, even Fox, wouldn’t give him a fair debate so he refuses to continue with the final two. Especially if he’s still down 8-10 points.
This is quite possibly the worst ad I’ve ever seen and trump was running one last week where someone gets murdered in their home for voting biden
I would vote for a week-old ham sandwich before I vote for the talking yam.  Joe Biden will be the next President of the United States.  Trump doesn’t know how to debate so it would be a waste of time for us to watch it.
The debates had better Damn well happen. Enough with Biden being allowed to skate!

Different substantively but no less big of a problem: Long delays in delivering mail due to USPS cuts leading to lots of mail-in ballots being thrown out as past deadline. Many of Biden voters will vote by mail.

Personally, I don't think Biden should debate trump until he releases his taxes.

The summary description of Jill Biden’s book still kills me— this is the most Joe Biden thing I’ve ever seen—  “how did you get this number” just gold.
If someone asked Biden if he’d pick a wombat for a running mate, beating out the person who asked him if he’d pick a woman, he’d have also said “yes”. Whatever they place in front of him, he always says “yes”.
Biden can’t even have a press conference without TelePrompTer!  What does that tell you. Plus he takes questions from only reporters he has on a list!  Biden not fit for office: neither his picks for VP!

If you want America to become Russia, China, Cuba, Venezuela then vote for Biden. You see what Dem rule looks like!  If you want safety, law and order, a quality life for you and your family, then vote TRUMP 2020!
Marie Harf commented that Biden is a moderate, but added “a moderate with some progressive ideas.”  Gotcha! Prof ideas are anything but moderate. Can’t be both! Biden is no moderate! Look at those with whom he associates.Forget about Trump’s lack of religion for a second and focus on the absurdity of his argument.  For his supporters to agree with him, they have to admit that Joe Biden is more powerful than God in order to be able to hurt God.  To do so is to admit God isn’t omnipotent.  Apostasy
Obviously Trump thinks differently than you do.  He actually thinks Biden possesses the cognitive ability to hurt  God.  Given that God is omnipotent, Biden must possess incredible acumen in order to devise a plan to hurt God and to hurt the Bible.  Ergo, I’ve gotta vote for him.
Enumerating Trump's lies would take days, so let me ask you a simple question. Today Trump said that Biden will hurt the Bible and will hurt God if elected.  If Biden is in mental decline, how can he hurt the Bible (?), and how can he hurt God?  Is God that weak or that gullible?
If God is omnipotent and Biden can hurt God, what does that make Biden?  Are there varying levels of omnipotence?
Hope you are ridin with Biden..

If Joe Biden picks some centrist for VP it’s gonna be a primary showdown in 2024.
Do not understand the idea some have that Kamala is owed VP by Biden. She did meh in the campaign, didn’t resonate with voters, has no major legislative accomplishments, and has never worked with or had a connection to Biden in the past.
Any vote other than Biden is dooming our country- you said it yourself. It literally DOES NOT MATTER who his VP pick is (unless it's Kayne)- anyone, literally anyone, would be better than Trump if it came to their leadership of the country.
Versus Trump America? I’ll take Biden
Hell of a lot worse than saying "I mean, you got the first mainstream African-American who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice-looking guy. I mean, that's a storybook, man." Biden said this about Obama, imagine if Trump said something like this.
Wrong, we all have different and likes, dislikes, opinions etc. Thank you for clarifying why I was not certain I should vote for Biden.

Biden asked a reporter to take a drug test
My sister met Joe Biden at a fundraiser in Long Neck Delaware for his son's foundation a couple of years ago. The biggest take away was you would never know he had been VP, Joe spent time talking with people like a average Joe citizen. The man is authentic and relatable.
I never took him seriously either but it doesn’t mean he hasn’t done a good job. The guy WANTS to be the greatest President in history. I believe that drives him. Biden just wants to finally win a Presidential election. That’s all he cares about.
You think Obama and Biden did a better job running the country than Trump? You REALLY believe that? I’m not asking which PERSONALITY you liked more or who fit the part better. I’m saying JUST based on policy and results. You really think Obama was a better President?
I don’t think either candidates are sane to be honest. Trump hasn’t lived in reality ever, but Biden is literally in cognitive decline. I choose the one who actually has a choice when it comes to deciding what sanity actually is. Biden doesn’t know anymore.
Really? Fox posting a video of Biden speaking is trolling?    Trolling - posting inflammatory, digressive, off topic messages.   No I don’t think they’re trolling I think they’re showing the oppositions candidate.
Oh that I agree with which is sad. Trump is a shit bag human being, BUT he’s NOT a bad President. Biden isn’t capable of speaking a sentence with full confidence but he’s supposed to run the country? What’s better a bad personality who is obsessed with succeeding or a half corpse
The top reasons why Kamala Harris MIGHT make sense for a Joe Biden VP (....
Only reason I’m voting Biden is there is no other choice!  The founding fathers never wrote a bipartisan system into the Constitution.  Only two teams to choose means you’re forced to choose the lesser of two evils rather than a true representative 😢
You site your source proving this statement and I’ll vote for Biden, no questions asked. Just site your source.
If you honestly hate Trump for asking campaign advice or think it’s somehow evil, how do you explain Hunter Biden doing a $1.5 B dollar transaction with them and flying there and back on a plane that operates solely on tax dollars?
Biden made some statement that there has to already be enthusiasm for the VP because they won’t be able to campaign in person. So I really think it’s Warren or Harris. (Hopefully Warren)
The thing about Biden is that he has the librals hands so far up his ass because he is a fucking puppet that he wants to take away our 2nd amendment right. He isn’t even president and he already has made it known that he will do unconstitutional stuff. #redflags

The whole reason Biden is the nominee is the media.

Biden never supported the Green New Deal. Only recently did he unveil a plan that holds a resemblance to it, which is better than nothing.  I believe you misunderstand my reason for this debate, if you can call it that. I understand your view, I don’t think you care to hear mine.
If you can’t see the advantage having been Obama’s VP gives Biden, then you’re clearly choosing to stay short-sighted. There’s no “popularity” without it. He’s run for president before &amp; no one batted an eye in favor of him.
You’re not wrong, but no one voted for Biden on policy. W/o Obama, Biden didn’t have anything apart from a familiar face. Don’t get me wrong, we’re on the same team at the end of day, we need Trump out. I just believe people chose Bernie from passion &amp; Biden from fear of Trump.
I’m not necessarily saying they “rigged” the primaries, but positions were used to undercut Bernie at every corner. They had an unfair advantage in the game, that’s all there is to it. If Biden hadn’t been Obama’s VP, no one would have even noticed him running.
Your argument would be sufficient if they dropped out after Super Tuesday. Out of 4 primaries Bernie won 2, Biden won 1, &amp; Buttigieg won 1. How does that lead you to believe they didn’t have a leg to stand on? It’s fact Obama convinced Buttigieg &amp; Klobuchar to drop out.

I could be wrong, but in my opinion trump keeps the political engine working with give and take. If the democrats get the office with Biden they will be able to railroad everything. Republicans hate Trump, which keeps things somewhat balanced.
The whole “any option is better” rationale doesn’t work for me. Any president would have been screwed during this year. The country was on a good path before covid. Biden using corona in his ads is frankly disgusting.
Trump is a piece of shit. But he is capable of being a leader, whether you like the direction or not. Biden terrifies me. The people who will get control of the office behind the scenes, while joe figures out what day it is is scary. Least with trump you have checks and balances
Panel rejects Donald Trump's request to add a fourth debate with Joe Biden  via
It’s because it’s who they wanted them to vote for. There were a handful of good democrats, and their names weren’t Biden or sanders. But they think Bernie scared away the centered democrats. But Biden is trickier. Anyone who values their vote on stances will have difficulty
Bernie was the candidate of the actual people. Bernie was leading before Super Tuesday. The democratic leadership knew Bernie would lose to trump so they basically put all their money and effort behind him. It was the right choice, but let’s not pretend dems wanted Biden.
This is taken out of context, as per usual via racist rag Breitbart. He was referring to voting trends, not people's actual genetic make up. They grasp at straws to make Biden look bad, trump does it all on his own.

The democratic leadership failed us. 4 years and a presidential seat ripe for the taking and they gave us Biden. Democrats are now forced to vote for Trump or ignore reason and vote for Biden just to be against trump. I for one vote for the best option, it’s sad Trump is that.
A little free lesson in Boolean logic for you: If you don't vote for Biden, then (by definition) you don't *actively oppose* Trump.  You can vote or not-vote however you like. You can prevaricate all you like. But that's how binary choices work.  Either own it, or kindly STFU. 🤷
Trump is actually leading. Chris Wallace &amp; the Media are in denial.   Furthermore, Trump would relish more debates with Biden. Biden is cognitively challenged. The more he’s exposed. The more it’s exposed. The more votes he loses.  Trump knows that only so well.   Chris doesn’t.

They’re also lying when they say that, they absolutely will not do that and will instead shiv Biden so they can reinstate themselves as Bush-era republican leadership.  We’re headed right back to 2000-2008 once 2024 rolls around if the Dems don’t smarten up, which they will not.
That’s why they’re getting things in place now so there won’t be a Democratic administration past 2024.  They’re going to shiv Biden gleefully and blame him for being unable to fix the fallout of the trump administration, and they’ll present themselves as the way forward.

and as for Biden winning:  here's clear proof Sanders won &amp; DP installed Biden.
Biden is most definitely unfit--in mental decline, inappropriate with females, and a 1% centrist republican who will maintain the status quo &amp;  capitalistic greed.
This approach doesn't challenge or take on the DP lie that Bernie lost and Biden won. Stand up for the whole truth. Don't barter with the deception to gain crumbs that ultimately won't  bring #GreenNewDeal, racial &amp; gender equality &amp; justice and an end to psychopathic rule.
We refuse to accept the DP destruction of our votes and arbitrarily naming Biden the winner to maintain DP power &amp; control.   I'm voting for the real winner of the 2016 and 2020 primaries, Bernie Sanders.  Will you join me?

Demetrius, Moscow was the Capital of the Communist USSR.  Republicans are anti-Communists,  anti-Marxis, Pro-Capitalism.  Democrats are anti-Capitalism, Pro-Socislism, &amp; in Bernie Saunders &amp; “The Squad’s” case Marxist.  So “Moscow Mitch” doesn’t fit. However,Beijing Biden does.🤷🏼‍♂️
It was meant to emasculate Biden on some level, I suppose... but ironically it seems to have given him an almost Reagan-level teflon coating.   "Dopey-Slow Joe can't have done that--- he's just way too Dopey! And Slow!"  (I wonder if it'll hold?🤷)
Popular culture (SNL, etc) has portrayed Biden as "Dopey Uncle Joe" since long before he was even VP. So everyone "just knows" that "Biden isn't smart."  (Just as everyone seemed to "just know" that "HRC was corrupt", despite little real evidence of her being particularly so).
If Biden were to announce a Photoshop Czar that would ensure official photos were at least faked WELL...it, alone, would be enough to secure my vote.
Biden should delay as long as possible as it’ll drive the right crazy that they can’t target an individual woman. Targeting them all looks bad.

"vote for Biden" is telling the DP that we condone and accept their behavior in changing our votes and falsely naming Biden as winner, when Sanders clearly won again.  Hold the DP accountable.
Many of us have repeatedly made comments similar to yours. We need to continue to state them repeatedly without backing down. We also need to insist that they stop pushing an unfit Biden on voters and acknowledge that Sanders won. This is our moment to demand a return to sanity.
I criticize Biden/Pelosi and will continue doing so. My vote against Trump is because I want him gone, otherwise I've had it with the DNC. Never again. We need to stop believing this "electability" BS and vote our conscience. A new way will never happen unless we make it happen.

I vote for Biden to drop out and be replaced by the actual winner, Bernie Sanders.

One of the main issues now is that federal agents are going after protestors &amp; not just rioters. You could argue it’s just the media perception distributing that, but we’d probably both agree then that the perception would shift when Biden was elected. Biden’s a good corporatist.
I don’t know if your opinion is rooted in fact.  One stance I could take is how Biden vs. Trump would handle the pandemic.

Patrick is disingenuous re being a “conservative.” He even admitted in a Tweet 5 minutes ago that he’s happy Biden will be super liberal. He only calls himself “conservative” because he thinks CNN or MSNBC might come calling for his punditry. They’re not interested of course
You're not worthy to be president. Who are you to say who anybody is going to vote for. You're just mad it's not you. And sleepy Joe Biden's going to kick your ass in November and then you go to prison.
Chip in to elect Joe Biden
My remark still stands. UR entitled to UR opinion. I have no problem w/people supporting #Biden. I simply find  disingenuous.
For instance, if you want Medicare 4 all, student debt relief, and police reform, one of them comes first in your mind right? They aren’t accomplished simultaneously. Trump isn’t going to do any of this. There’s at least the slightest chance Biden or Congress will.
Joe Biden insults African Americans.
If you're a conservative or Republican who's going to vote for Joe Biden then as far as I'm concerned you're not a Republican. Don't understand how u can have conservative principles n yet support the man who wants to bring the country so far left China looks like a free country
“Biden loves Biden.”  First, respecting the office and our institutions does not mean that one has to respect the office-holder. Democracy means being actively involved, if only by voting.  I don’t know if Biden loves Biden, but Trump loves Trump more than he loves his Country.
2/2 The Democrats hope you’ll turn on Trump and blame HIM for ALL your troubles. But THAT’S about to BACKFIRE. Inadvertently, the Dems have STRENGTHENED Trump’s base, NOT weakened it. They know THIS is the ONLY way Biden can “win.” And now ? Mail In voting !
Who is doing this "heavy vetting" for Biden's VP? Seriously. Not so heavy
Biden needs to STOP courting white folks. He needs to secure his support among Black people and POC. We’ve seen HOW EASY it is for white folks to return to Trump without blinking a eye.
Another racist Joe Biden classic!
I'm gonna take my medicine, but goddamn is biden a horrible candidate. The final 2 candidates in this election have to be the worst final 2 in history. Anyone. Literally anyone is better than the current dipshit, but Biden is the best "we've" got. One step at a time though.
I just hope Biden is the less racist candidate...
Intel officials tell Congress that Russia is spreading false information about Biden
Joe Biden will not be the nominee... we know this. Dems are tiring to figure out what those next step is.
fucking traitors.  Senate Republicans advance Ukraine probe aimed at Biden despite foreign interference concerns
In any other developed nation in the world Bernie is a moderate centrist. We are just so far right in America he seems radically left. Biden is decently right himself.

Joe Biden's veepstakes: Val Demings raised her profile during impeachment trial
that was before Joe Biden opened his mouth.
I’m just sounding the alarm that Joe Biden is racist
Considering the American people were unaware of the deep state &amp; its power, Obama's attempt to illegally take the Trump campaign down,Ukraine/Biden/China $ laundering connection, Congress being spied on by our Intel agencies, then yes.  If Trump wasn't POTUS we'd be communists.
If you don’t vote for Biden, you are voting for Trump.
Does this mean in reality Biden is doing better than the average poll and higher quality polls are better at detecting this reality or could it mean there is a bias that is somehow coordinated with your pollster rankings?

You and your collaborators are the wolves in sheep's clothing that Jesus warned us about. You obviously have balls the size of China to come out and call Joe Biden godless. Take a good look in the mirror!
Females are today's best leaders. Notwithstanding the attacks will be fierce when Biden’s running mate is announced. Her "tone" will be scrutinized by male pigs and the sexism-enabling media. This old white male is sick of this CRAP! Bring it on SISTER! Save us from male A-holes.
No CNN is not News and I think ATT owns them.  Could this be “unreported” Biden political donations?  I’m willing to file the FEC complaints
"U.S. intelligence has assessed that China is hoping President Donald Trump does not win reelection, Russia is working to denigrate Democrat Joe Biden and Iran is seeking to undermine democratic institutions," said the director of counterintelligence, Bill Evanina.
If you don’t vote for Biden, you’re essentially voting for the Mango Mussolini.
This freak out about Kanye is stupid af. Like find something legitimate to worry about like Joe Biden making racist comments and not supporting medicare for all something supported overwhelmingly by democrats and independents and even half of republicans.
ONLY BIDEN SAID HE WOULD NOT ACCEPT FOREIGN HELP  TRUMP IS ALREADY ACCEPTING HELP FROM RUSSIA
Maybe, it's to counteract any (MSNBC) media narratives of "radical left takeover" when Biden announces Warren as VP? Otherwise, I got nothing...
Prediction thread: stake your claim!  How many days until Biden publicly says his next racist statement and/or verbal gaffe?
Yeah.  That writer has personal animus towards Biden, for whatever reason.  In the spring she went off on him on the Chris Hayes Show over the now totally debunked Tara Reade Hoax, as if she had 100% certainty of the nominee's guilt.
LOL JOE BIDEN SAID IT!
I have it on good sourcing that Trump paid Russia to give Joe Biden a lobotomy back in 2017.
Biden can’t talk so his VP choice is so important but his potential helpers are all scared shitless.    #Biden2020🤡💰💰🇨🇳 #FridayThoughts #CNN
Shut up and win the election is a great name for a book on the 2020 race between Trump and Biden
Biden must be starting to slip in polling and in the minds of people operating behind closed doors.  Here comes the Russia monster! LOL
Idiot  If you don't vote Biden then you're voting for Trump. How stupid can you be to even consider letting that happen. Agreed on VP issue but c'mon! It' CommaLa btw.
It’s so sad to say this but the best thing Biden can do for Black and Latinx communities is shut up and just win the election.
Yeah it was Russia that made Joe Biden say there isn’t much diversity of thought in the African American community
Excuse me but, it worked. I do not support it but think about the # of people that actually follow up on the Kanye for pres story! Kanye West is guaranteed to be a write-in for some voters. Kanye West Indicates That His Spoiler Campaign...via
Where tf is Biden’s VP 😭
I’d camp outside to vote for him and I am not even a Biden Stan.
Does that indicate some missed bias on your part or are these polls more accurately picking up on a Biden lead?
yeah, and he said, "Hi my name is Joe Biden and I'm running to get your vote for V.P. this November."
The latest with Biden is we might lose our savings. Hopefully, this is enough to convince people he is not worth voting for.
I mean, Biden is slipping in polls
Joe Rogan keeps raising doubts about Joe Biden's mental acuity
Joe did not clarify. His staff black pedaled Biden’s racist remarks.
I love that Joe Biden doesn’t support the Hyde amendment.   It’s awful policy that reiterates to poor, predominantly women of color, that they have less bodily autonomy, simply bc of their healthcare.   Also, donating to  now, in your name
And how demeaning will it be to give a Black woman the job of cleaning up the huge mess made by white men? Most of it will need to be handled by the VP...b/c Biden isn't skilled enough to do it on his own. Guess who can clean this up w hands tied behind her back? Elizabeth Warren
trump is a white nationalist racist. Biden is better.
That’s putting it mildly.  I’m glad he’s finally showing up Biden’s moral compass.  He hides behind his “good ol’ Catholic school boy” mantra when he’s a bureaucratic piece of dirt on record.
"[dem] voters will forgive Biden’s latest racist remarks—as they’ve forgiven him for everything else, like, say Tara Reade—because they must rationalize that this election is so important that if you demand Biden be held accountable, you must want another four years of Trump"

Only reason Biden wants to pick a black woman as VP is so he can blame racism and sexism if he loses
If Joe Biden wants my vote he must agree to personally strangle thirteen lifelong Democratic voters of my choosing to death.
Nah, there’s plenty of ways Biden’s platform is to the right of Hillary’s.
Well actually it was the FDA and CDC who fucked this thing up royally, I can't imagine the FDA would have approved MORE tests in the early stages of the virus had Biden been in office
Half is an exaggeration. Had he made even one of countless Biden statements or actions, they’d lock Bernie away and toss the key.
Then Black woman VP will get blamed for every new racially insensitive comment from Biden.
What were the numbers?  Biden still slipping?
Someone should run political ads “Not going to vote because you thing Biden is going to win? Vote anyway, every vote humiliates Trump more and there’s nothing he like less then that.”
If Bernie Sanders said half the things Joe Biden does, he’d be lucky to get life without parole.
Delusional to even think that, Biden no one wants a individual who Has a touchy feely syndrome of children.
We need to #MAGA2020 - hope this is correct. Any #MAGAts at this point in the orange anus mouth's disgraceful period as their leader need to seek another country. Perhaps N. Korea or Russia where their values are similar.
Yeah Biden’s stances are not reflective of our views in most cases, but I guess I’m seeing past him as president and trusting that congress and the Supreme Court can implement MAJOR revisions to presidency as we know it today. Trump exploited every possible power trip he could
So basically what you’re telling me is, Biden is racist but trump is not👀... fuck that I am still voting Biden, I simply don’t like trump and his kkk administration.
"so he’s not gonna raise billionaire’s taxes"?  Sounds like you don't know what "facts" and "research" are either.
This question is sincere, but can I ask why you have decided to not vote for Biden? I am voting for him begrudgingly despite him being an awful choice, but for me personally it's better than more Trump. Just curious.
I truthfully believe once Biden is in office, EVERYTHING is going to change, and not on Biden’s initiative, but Congress. They’re going to want to safeguard the presidency to never get as close to a dictatorship as it has with Trump in office. I foresee several amendments coming.
I see. But wouldn't almost all the concerns that applies to Biden with regards to age and health conditions also apply to Sanders. Also, I think Bernie made a lot of errors during the primary and his loss was not the result of only an unfair primary.
It’s also just #Gaslighting and the EO will be held up in litigation until  is kicked to the curb. After this, President Biden can just write another EO eliminating this one. It’s all a shell game and a con. Always for  Case in point
Biden can do and get away with it. This is how Biden knows he got the black vote.
Where is Jill Biden? Save your husbands dignity for heaven’s sake!!
#Biden owns a shotgun. I don't know if #Trump does. I don't. But it's  #Biden &amp; #Democrats who are pushing legislation that could lead to infringement. 3/X
Biden doubles down on his stupidity and racism.
But #Biden backs policies that could impact my right to practice my religion &amp; #Trump doesn't. Trump isn't keeping me out of Church, #Democrats are. 2/X
I think that Trump could plausibly lose, but it would not be because of Joe Biden or anything Biden has done.
My advice to the black community, Joe Biden needs your vote, tell him you will forgive him if he gives you (insert  demand). Politics 101, when you have political power use it
Here's the point you aren't getting. So #Biden attends Church &amp; you judge him to be sincere - fine. You say Trump isn't sincere - fine.  1/X
Especially once blacks get to know the real Joe Biden:
lol, you going by hearsay but ignoring Biden voting against desegregation and didn’t what his kids going to school with black kids. Yet you ignore Trump doing the most for blacks than president ever
We need to put equal effort into flooding Biden's tweets with positive reinforcement as we do with confronting republicans' tweets. There is a great disparity, republicans are flooding Biden as we do tRump and it is negatively influencing potential voters.
I can’t follow the reasoning because Trump is only focused on his own agenda. We have proof of the horrible job he’s done over the last 4 years, it won’t get better in the next 4. Biden will be bullied by actually progressives in offices to push forth issues we need seen.
WE NEED A LANDSLIDE (FOR BIDEN)
Good call! Biden will listen to his team as opposed to Trump. We all might dislike Biden, but we have to trust that those filling other positions in office will actually have influence in issues that were actually concerned with whereas Trump is only worried about his own agenda
Joe Biden - faith.
This is pretty much the only logical explanation for voting biden I’ve ever seen. When it’s all “he’s not trump” that doesn’t reassure me of anything. I don’t know if I can pull myself to continue contributing to an organization that appears to neglect the people. But compelling!
Get specific please. Have you read Biden’s plans??? Go online and read them then get back to us on where we can read Trumps plans laid out like Biden’s.
I sure hope this is wrong. AOC is the future. Her being excluded will discourage young people from voting for Biden.

Classic racist Joe Biden.
Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden says he will not stand in the way of prosecution against President Trump from the Justice Department if he is elected.
Saw some opinion article where they said they would wait and see who Biden's V.P. pick would be before deciding. I was prepared to vote for a toothpick to be president. I don't know how any Dem V.P. could drag the ticket.
Daily reminder that Joe Biden would be be 78 when inaugurated, is clearly not all there, and his potential Vice President is being chosen based on gender and race
Why? So he can steal 11 votes away from Biden?
You presume that, because I criticize Biden, I support Trump?!? 🤣🤣🤣  Please try to widen your scope a little bit!!!  I DESPISE DONALD JOHN TRUMP AND WISH FOR HIM TO BE BANISHED FROM SOCIETY  …which is why I'm so angry at the DNC for pushing Biden as the nominee!!!
If she's being "heavily vetted" ehy doesnt the Biden camp know this? Ugh!

Yesterday I made the mistake of telling people on my Instagram that Biden is a racist not a Trump level racist but a racist none the less. We can't make excuses for his behavior because he's not as bad a Trump.
Joe Biden will need to be kept under constant pressure  if we hope to see justice for what the Republicans have done the past four years as well as making any advance on climate change, healthcare, racist policing, et al. Returning to the status quo is not acceptable!
Not at all saying that I like the alternative, but no one should be able to say that they are comfortable with Biden as President...he just isn’t with it enough anymore
Maybe, but I'm not so sure about that. Will the "moderate" independents be comfortable voting for a Progressive like Sanders and Warren? Part of Biden's appeal is his relative "moderation" in comparison with the other Dems.
joe biden’s campaign and joe kennedy’s are exactly the same i see
Aug 6 - part 2  V - OH Gov DeWine tests positive before meeting with Trump. Then tests negative....hmmmm BTB - Thighland. Biden hurts God. CV -  Michelle Obama says she’s depressed...welcome to the Club  EL - Pelosi, Schumer write to Postmaster General DC - still no deal
My true thought is the Dems are too far down the road with Biden.  I believe he will be "Epsteined".  Causing a "feel sorry" movement while plugging Hillary back in.  I truly believe this may already be being planned.
If anything good comes out of a Biden presidency it will be because massive movements of American people persist in protests and activism.
I actually respect Brett a lot and like to hear his perspective on things (although I disagree with a lot of his politics). It's just that at this point in time, replacing Biden is no more than wishful thinking.
Karl Rove is ready to give Biden a chance real soon, imho. #FoxNews
Can't wait to see the post "KKK officially endorses Biden for president" LMAO
Biden should be committed. #FoxNews #Biden2020🤡
Well, most "Not Trump" people will probably vote for Biden. So it's essentially the same thing.
Biden Lies About Arrests to Appear Cooler to the Libs  #Democrats #liars
So sad that #Biden was the best the Democrats could come up with.   I feel like I am choosing between stale old pizza and a putrid maggot infested piece of meat.  The choice is easy but i won't be enjoying the meal.
I wouldn't be surprised if she Votes for Biden on the down low and she just doesn't want to announce it publicly.
I will say it right out. I am a former Republican (until Bernie 2016), I can't stand Biden. I think he is a bad candidate  At this moment in time, there is a fundamental right and wrong with limited choices Voting for Biden is the right thing to do Sorry I can't be more upbeat

Intelligence officials provide details on Russian disinformation campaign against Biden: report -
You keep this in your head..I see your tweets with Russian code messages on the Denigration of Joe Biden..I will abruptly report your tweets to Twitter and see that your removed asap for damaging his campaign. Its against twitter policies. Your not doing this.
You think you and the Russians  and Ron Johnson are attempting to denigrate Joe Biden..Be careful..Americans know what your doing.. Not happening. This is not 2016.
Funny how the media will cover the story of a republican voting for Biden but somehow fails to cover the violence in Portland.   Makes you think the media has a narrative or something.
You are 100% in the wrong of using religion as a prop for your pathetic re-election attempts against Joe Biden. It will fire back and make you as desperate as a snake crossing over a 4 lane highway getting to the other side safely. HUGE MISTAKE.
Can they elect literally anyone? Biden is only up 3 nationwide in a couple recent polls and that was BEFORE he went on his ramblings about cocaine and elephants.
This election seems less about representing the “right” positions, more who gets to them “first” and markets better. Biden wants to open schools, but Americans (by &amp; large) associate Trump with “OPEN THE SCHOOLS”. Trump says “MASKS” but we mostly associate Dems with that message.
He took the cognitive test&amp;passed!! Biden has yet to take it. BTW  IQ is one of the highest of all POTUS' to date. #Facts Matter Biden thinks Blacks ain't Black if they vote other tan Democrat. Biden also thinks Blacks all think the same. No problem there? GTHO!!
got anything to add to Kayne West saying his sole purpose in this election to help Biden lose? Because you were roasting people left n right the day he announced his candidacy
Take care of the damn gig workers!  You will lose votes in election if you don’t!  You people are starting to disgust me and I’m a Trump supporter.. might not be for long! If u don’t take care of them, I’m voting for Biden! Do the right thing!
Biden's brain is drained of any&amp;all logical thinking,no problem solving abilities left!! Dem leaders should be charged for elderly abuse!!
Have you considered doing some funny lip synching videos to Joe Biden lines to draw attention to the humour of the situation?
Remember when Beto’s endorsement in Dallas helped Joe Biden win in the Texas primary this past year? Good memories.
Georgia and Texas are a toss up not because of Biden or the "president." They are a toss up because Black and Latinx folks have been working their ass off to build progressive infrastructure for a decade.     Let's make sure no one ever forgets that.
Wrong. But you go ahead and dishonestly pretend that Biden and Trump are mentally comparable.
He’s a black trump supporter. He can’t be THAT offended by Biden’s comments, he’s heard worse that he’s okay with.
Kudos to Marquita Bradshaw who, using little money, scored a tremendous upset victory in Tennessee's Democratic primary. She's running to win Lamar Alexander's US senate seat. Clinton, Biden, Pelosi, Schumer Democrats shocked again!
biden has issued an apology for implying he believed Latinos were ideologically diverse
Um.... Donald Trump I can actually understand and he makes perfect sense when he speaks. I have no idea where you are coming up with this bullshit. Zero Idea... no Biden.... he is 9 donuts short of a dozen!
Hannity hammers Biden after 'weird, strange, embarrassing public breakdown': 'What's going on here?'
You’re running for Congress never miss a chance to screw somebody over so you can get elected sounds to me like you’re playing a card you shouldn’t be Joe Biden will be a better president Trump the chump
Ooh are you afraid that Biden might not win? Thought he was in the lead. Lol
Sure about that? Every single time Biden speaks he shows how incompetent he really is. Lol
Trump has been a national embarrassment from day 1!  It is hard to believe he would be able to undo or weaken the nation’s acquired power and influence over the past 100 years in just his first term. SAVE AMERICA-VOTE BIDEN!
Vegas has Biden a 3 to 1 favorite. And 5 to 2 bet Trump will resign before October 1st!
some of y’all are out here gaslighting people for sharing real information about your candidate‘s racist remarks &amp; it’s absolutely hilarious to me.  sweetie, Biden is grown.  to suggest that he can’t be responsible for his actions but must be responsible for a country is... lmao
I will support Joe Biden no matter who his VP is... but I will be disappointed if it’s not Kamala Harris. I think she’s the best.
Are you admitting that Biden is mentally declining? Why don't you ask real questions like, why isn't Biden going to debate  ? What are Biden's handlers afraid of? Incompetent? I think it's elderly abuse what Dems are doing to a sick man.
. I mean C'mon Joe don't ya think its time for Donald to hit the high road..Just give it Joe Biden..Rape charges now..
Why should biden debate Trump Trump will lie, make things up claim false facts it’s a waste of time
Biden will not win. He won’t
WOW!!!  Joe Biden is actually racist
Hey  - go fuck yourself.    Jesus doesn't approve of your dirty, cheating tactics. And your buddy Trump is in NO WAY a man of God.  Wake up.
Absolutely- not voting for Biden is a vote for Trump. And she couldn’t even explain why she would chose Harris over Rice. This is absurd.
1) why would Harris get it and Rice not? Wouldn’t you expound on that in the article  2) a vote for anyone but Biden IS a vote FOR trump - did you not learn anything from 2016? 3) neither rice nor Harris are an imbecile Palin. Both would be fine choices
ffs why is Joe Biden like this  (hit the other video in the thread to watch him double down and say it again at another event)
Biden is as Catholic as I'm a hooker.
This is going to make Dems look bad,everyone can see Biden is mentally declining&amp;for Dems to hang on a mentally ill man for their pick for Dem candidate for POTUS is why  will win. Dems should be charged with elder abuse of Biden! #WalkAway
And more important..#Biden is against #blacks and #Jews.

You make the outlandish claim that Joe Biden doesn't believe in GOD..well..Joe didn't kill 159,000 americans. YOU DID. Joe Biden has prayed to God for the families of the dead/sick You didn't. Only evil and heartless souls like you kill 159,800 americans. Sad.
These are things I want and Biden actually won’t do! So fuck all y’all
I would hesitate to call Biden devout given he is pro-choice. By some canonists figuring he might be excommunicated automatically because of his support of abortion.

I will vote for Joe Biden if his veep pick is the first grade teacher who yelled at me for coloring a worksheet with pencils.
That joe Biden video is taken out of context
Does it make me a racist if I agree with Joe Biden?
I'm looking at you a bit askance, S.E. Any vote not for Biden is a vote for Trump and you know that, especially after 2016.

There is only one #racist #antisemitic party of hate and thats the #Biden #Democrat #IlhanOmar party. See whats happening in the cities runned by the #Democrats and you can envision the #USA future if Biden will win.
What a stupid remark. #covid is impacting the world economy everywhere. The #Democrats are destroying the #USA now. The toplist of unemployment is led by #Democrat cities, the crime rate is exploding in the #police defunded cities etc. #Biden #Trump
It does.  The big variable is... can Biden make it/hold up until November.  He has to participate in at least 2 of the 3 scheduled debates.  If he declines to participate in any debates it should... should... weaken his chances of winning.   “Should”.

“Deridin’ Biden. Taking it to the Streets!”
I think they’re saying that “for some absurd reason Bernie left the race and now we’re stuck with Trump will kill us quicker or Biden is so useless.” Also, “it is so bad but what the hell else can anyone do? Just get rid of the Cheeto scum and then be Deridin’ Biden.” I guess.

Wasn’t Susan Rice at the center of the faux Benghazi scandal? Does Biden really want to open that wound?
So stunning and brazen that Trumpists use this argument against Biden when their own candidate is such an obvious imbecile

To all the critics of how Biden speaks.
How much fun would Jill Biden-Melania Trump debate be?
People bashing this don't seem to realize that old white guys (trumps' boomer base) just love to talk about classic cars.  Biden's trying to win them over.
Except for Hannity and right wing radio, how will Trump’s nasty made-up talking point about Biden’s age get out now while Trump, seen everyday on all media outlets, reveal his mental decline. How else to explain his expectation the Coronavirus will “magically disappear”?
Joe Biden is literally a left leaning Republican

It's wild anyone looked at the Ady Barkan endorsement video, or Bernie Sanders after his endrosement of Biden, and concluded a refusal to endorse Biden would be anything but a positive for Tlaib.
..also, per postal workers endorsing Biden: 1. Of course; Trump is trying to eliminate the Postal Svs by driving it into the ground, 2. The Postmaster Gen is a Trump donor who is intentionally dismantling the PO w new policies that slow down and disrupt Svs. Which is worse?
I've wondered if Biden will get a VP bounce but neither will get a convention bounce.  Does a non-incumbant usually get a bigger bounce because their VP is new news?
I don’t think sleepy Joe Biden would pass the cognitive intelligence test

Predicts a Biden victory
I wonder about this - I think the lesson Biden learned in the primary (not unreasonably) is that field doesn’t matter in a prez race. Bernie out organized the shit out of him and it didn’t matter. Maybe it won’t in the general either
Didn't Biden previously attest to the fact that he was tested 'all the time' on cognitive tests?
He caught in the throes of his illness. What’s disgusting is Republican operatives trying to use him to hurt Biden.
For everybody that is even considering to vote for the #Democrat #Democrats #Biden #Biden2020......We can already see what the impact on the #USA would be if a Democrat that has been in office for already for 50 years would become a president. Scary isnt it? #Trump #Trump2020

It seems so deliberate at this point concerning trump, but lol even asking Biden to just do that is too much let’s be honest 🤣🤣
If he took the Biden approach and only said what was written down for him to say and was other wise stuffed in a closet till they needed him again, he’d win by a land slide. But he’s too compelled to make a complete ass of himself infront of the world.

Maybe the Biden non-engagement factor will work. Trump is out there every day causing major public revulsion to him. If Biden hides he provides us less reasons to revile him (tho there’s not much more he could do to repulse progressives). It’s a race to the bottom &amp; bad for us.

If it said Biden 2020 this wouldn’t be reported.
Dems don’t want Biden to debate Trump coz he would get butchered &amp; it would really expose his growing dementia.   This is why they keep pushing the Covid narrative &amp; mail in voting to avoid an actual debate of policy and hope to run away with the election purely based on fear.
Wait...what?  Biden’s middle name..???
I completely agree.  Two approaches; Biden announce he will not debate unless Trump releases his Tax Returns by September 15.  Or announce No Debates, period !  If they do debate, Biden gives short, concise answers, leave more time for Trump to make a fool of himself.
If it makes you feel better it probably doesn't matter at all since a Biden administration is committed to being terrible regardless :)
You’re right Trump is much better at destroying jobs than Biden. 20 million jobs lost in four month so far.

How Joe Biden’s surprisingly ambitious climate plan came together
Who will be Biden's VP
You're beginning to sound like a russian bot. If that's not your intention, you may want to brush up on your vocabulary and sentence structure. IE: Biden may not be perfect, but we must elect him for there to be any hope of the changes we want to see.
1) why would Biden supporters come out to see you? 2) the clear video evidence shows a less than enthusiastic outpouring for you. Delusional. #AmericaOrTrump
Just let President-elect Biden handle it when he figures it's warranted.
Keep hiding Biden, the truth will come out soon. Mentally and physically unfit to be president. Worse off than Hillary.
I’d rather live in hell on earth ridin with Biden then die even faster under Trrump. I know that’s a pathetically self-destructive observation but we live in a time of ongoing delusion. I’m glad I live in MA &amp; don’t have 2 support either 1% stooge clown in desperation. Good luck
i’m just going to leave this here. Literal proof that #trump is outspending and outanalyzing the #biden campaign and now i’m scared. Joe get with the times and start segmenting your audience better! #politics #Election2020
it's ok Biden will pivot to the general any time now
I completely agree. Trump does not even know how to tell the truth. It would be a lose-lose situation for Biden.
So after I explained my vote, in my DMs I've had a lot of thoughtful back and forth with Markey voters, and have only gotten vote shamed by people in the party who haven't endorsed Biden for November. Can't figure that one out either.

Like the Democrats and bumbling Biden could do any better? Give your head a shake.
Not that hi. But the most progressive president we ever had was a racist party man from Texas because he operated in a context of rising demands. That is key. (Also he was a political genius of a kind. That helps. Biden’s not that.

I bet Biden’s team has or is preparing contingency plans for just about every scenario, so🤞
I’m beside myself about what Trump’s doing to our Country.  This next 90+ days are going to drive me nuts.  And Trump better lose, I can’t take much more of this.  Nice to see so many rational Republicans coming on board to support Biden.
What? Are you running out of gas or something what are you talking about? Already what? Did you catch Biden’s mindlessness?
But if he succeeds in doing the job  has entrusted him with, Biden won’t be President.
Maybe I can get one of Biden’s. He probably has cases of them because he salivates when he assaulting young women or trying to spit out coherent sentences
Of Joe its No match  crazy Question. There  is Nothing To debate  BIDEN next President Of U.S.A
No!!! Carter was a really bad politician. Having better moral principles matters little if you lack political judgment. Biden is a party man, he can be moved left. His lack of principles is precisely why there is an opportunity.

lol how did they not pick Biden's running mate around the same time they decided to put the fix in for him
This is the best tweet about the VP situation I have seen. The problem here are Biden’s friends (BTW the same friends who pushed him to run in the first place)
The Dems have no message, instead Biden is stealing POTUS' message(s). The bring the fear mongers,domestic terrorists:BLM,Antifa hoping to scare Americans in to caving to their demands. They use race baiting,name calling. This is why Trump won&amp;will again!!
Biden requested early access to briefings, when it was clear trump was doing nothing about the bounties on our soldiers. The national security team has zero reason to withhold anything from the former VP/senator.
Val Demings is high on my list. No VP candidates are perfect. If not VD for Biden’s VP, then certainly for another position in Biden’s Cabinet. Of course I feel similarly about Biden’s other women candidates. They are all intelligent, accomplished, flexible &amp; good women 💛👍🍀🤞
I mean, the pictures of Joe Biden kneeling, with a mask, all sunny around him, outstretching his hands to grace a Black child. It's fuckin' "I'm your savior" propaganda. If he were a little more religiously based, he would probably pass himself off as the second Christ.
It won't be dangerous in Biden's America,  it's dangerous in Trump's America right now....
Wait did you all really push for Biden without having ever heard of him before?
Just a reminder to the many Trump supporters who say they won't accept the results if Biden wins... That is NOT up for debate. So build a bridge and get over it!!!

So  is going to do what the cry baby Democrats have done for 4 years now!? Except last election wasn’t rigged. The only challenge Joe Biden would be facing is trying to put together a full sentence without forgetting where he is. You must be as delusional as him.
The double standard has gone beyond what I believe would happen. This is a funeral for a great man who gave a lot to improve the life of American citizens. Obama, Biden, and the leader of Congress turned It into a biased political platform. Do we get it now?
Your willingness to publicly debase yourself for Biden for no real reason suggests you're not as ambivalent about him as you're pretending to be
Biden should be #45 , not 46, as #44 was the last one we had. .. the last 3.5 years have been devoid of a president.
Alright cool, but if they impeach him, isn't it gonna be pence vs Biden?
Trumpism is dangerous - it’s illiberal, antithetical to conservatism and anti-intellectual at its core. Biden/Rice is the most competent ticket. Keep in mind I’m not wild about Dem economic policy - it will literally hit me in the wallet- Trumpism is THAT dangerous. End
I support Joe Biden because he, for all his faults, puts us back on the path to normalcy. Where policy debates matter and thus populist, nationalist, isolationist Trumpism is repudiated. Bring out a Paul Ryan or Ben Sasse in 2024. 2/
He’s already doing it. A tight 20-minute Rally speech at Texas Oil.  High energy. Concise.  I don’t know about August, but whoever gets the earlier start sets the table. I suspect Biden will drop his VP this week(?) and start the engines for, as the kids say, realsies.  Buckle up
What’s on? The Election?  If Biden makes a splash with his already-later-than-Hillary-did-it-in-2016 VP announcement, Trump will have to keep up amid the hype.

I know who I’m voting for, don’t believe you understand who you’re voting for though. If you look at the bills put forth by Biden before VP he isn’t for the American people he’s for Biden’s wallet
Yea Biden’s been accused by numerous women too but the main difference is there’s actual proof of Biden, and it’s clear as day the corruption within that man. Who also freely threw the N word around during senate hearings. Full blown racist! But hey yea have fun with the election
So many good candidates. And we are poised to have Biden and Kamala. Not surprised we are gonna have Trump for another 4 years ......
I was talking about Biden the actual pedofile, Trump has signed more executive orders than any other president to protect children and prevent sex trafficking to the point where he declared January prevention of human trafficking month. Do some research outside the fake news!Over 10% unemployment still! Wow, that’s worse than the Great Recession.  Of course, President Obama and VP Biden would have never let it come to this.  Sad.
Joe Biden is a racist because he supported segregation and just this year he said that, "if you can't tell if you're for me or Trump then you ain't black", and voted the crime bill that locked up blacks

I actually think more disgruntled Trump voters will turn to Kanye’s joke camaign to vote then it will draw away from Biden. This will backfire on them.

How many times did Biden run for President? What if Obama said that about him?
I agree, no debates unless Trump releases tax returns by September 15.  Biden doesn’t need the debates.

You should have pictures of Fauci Biden Harris Pelosi Obama Gates  Schumer Nadler and every Dem Liberal Left who wants mail in voting Not Trump
Trump-Biden?
this is why I didn't want him as the nominee. I knew that he would fall back on outdated democratic thought. Rendell has no idea who are party is now. Biden thinks the old boy club is going to help him/
This is what I worried about with Biden. He should not be listening to Rendell or Dodd. They have not been in tune with the Democratic Party or the country for years. Our base is progressive.

I’m more afraid that you will make a whole truck load of Biden votes disappear in swing states so that you can win. Cheating is the only chance you have of winning
I think Trump’s going to stick it out, I think they’re cooking up Obamagate, probably announce it mid September. If he loses, and I hope Biden wins in a landslide, I see him resigning and have Pence pardon him.

I bet they're spending a lot of time on focus groups and internal polling.  On one hand, avoiding the debates looks bad, I mean a total admission that Joe can't handle it.  But having the debates would also be a disaster for Biden. It'd be a treasure trove of gaffes and Memes.
Just my thoughts. If Trump wins,  the stock market will drop significantly. The smart money understands the consequences of a Trump victory. If Biden wins, the market will move to 40k in a couple years. Biden is predictable,  which I believe the smart money is craving.
Biden didn’t lie. You have been fooled.

This approach doesn't challenge or take on the DP lie that Bernie lost and Biden won. Stand up for the whole truth. Don't barter with the deception to gain crumbs that ultimately won't  bring #GreenNewDeal, racial &amp; gender equality &amp; justice and an end to psychopathic rule.

NOT VOTING FOR BIDEN:
It was meant to emasculate Biden on some level, I suppose... but ironically it seems to have given him an almost Reagan-level teflon coating.   "Dopey-Slow Joe can't have done that--- he's just way too Dopey! And Slow!"  (I wonder if it'll hold?🤷)
Popular culture (SNL, etc) has portrayed Biden as "Dopey Uncle Joe" since long before he was even VP. So everyone "just knows" that "Biden isn't smart."  (Just as everyone seemed to "just know" that "HRC was corrupt", despite little real evidence of her being particularly so).
If Biden were to announce a Photoshop Czar that would ensure official photos were at least faked WELL...it, alone, would be enough to secure my vote.
Biden should delay as long as possible as it’ll drive the right crazy that they can’t target an individual woman. Targeting them all looks bad.
In Biden’s defense, he probably doesn’t know what day it is.
I don't feel like listening to your pro 1% aligned selling of Biden. Blocked.
"vote for Biden" is telling the DP that we condone and accept their behavior in changing our votes and falsely naming Biden as winner, when Sanders clearly won again.  Hold the DP accountable.
Many of us have repeatedly made comments similar to yours. We need to continue to state them repeatedly without backing down. We also need to insist that they stop pushing an unfit Biden on voters and acknowledge that Sanders won. This is our moment to demand a return to sanity.
I criticize Biden/Pelosi and will continue doing so. My vote against Trump is because I want him gone, otherwise I've had it with the DNC. Never again. We need to stop believing this "electability" BS and vote our conscience. A new way will never happen unless we make it happen.

Biden shouldn't pull a running mate from the Senate. Things are precarious there at best. Post-election he can fill cabinet positions from the Senate, providing the Dem majority can withstand the loss.

I vote for Biden to drop out and be replaced by the actual winner, Bernie Sanders.

Today's thought: the vast vast majority of people have already decided between Trump and Biden. The ONLY thing that is at play is whether or not they will vote. No matter what Trump does, his supporters do. not. care. The rest of us need to vote. Period.
Maybe it will work and he'll be able to wangle a Trump-v-Biden SCOTUS decision amid the violence that will get him his second term. But even if it doesn't, the cost to the country in blood spilled, lives lost, and confidence wrecked will be tremendous.

Who needs logic, right? If you don’t think Biden’s Administration would work with a variety of departments and organizations (especially regarding science, economics, etc) to improve public health and return Americans to the work place, you must not think before you speak.
On election night, even if many votes are not yet counted, we'll still know that you lost the election.  Biden will win by a landslide.  Intelligent Americans are fed up with having an incompetent criminal in the White House.
Postponing the election will cause a longer wait.  We will vote on Nov. 3, whether at the polls or by mail, and we will wait patiently to welcome Joe Biden as our president.  Having to wait for the results doesn't change the outcome.  #Biden2020
It’s plausible Biden will do more for reform &amp; racial tensions than Trump, who has more than sold out to his base who sees not much wrong with enforcement as is. But if he can also listen to experts in many fields on how to get people back to work safely, employment ⬆️ protest ⬇️
One of the main issues now is that federal agents are going after protestors &amp; not just rioters. You could argue it’s just the media perception distributing that, but we’d probably both agree then that the perception would shift when Biden was elected. Biden’s a good corporatist.
I don’t know if your opinion is rooted in fact.  One stance I could take is how Biden vs. Trump would handle the pandemic. If Biden’s admin can quell the virus better than Trump &amp; get people back to work life safely faster than Trump can, unemployment resolved faster &gt; less riots
Sanders won in numerous states (mine included) where exit polls showed he won by a significant margin, while the DP vote count declared Biden the winner. We cannot support a corrupt party that steals elections for 1% psychopaths who would destroy the majority to continue to rule.
The important thing right now is to get Trump out of office and the only way to do that is to vote for Biden. Voting anyone else would be foolish as it would guarantee Trump’s re-election. Political issues are secondary and they can be debated and negotiated once Trump is gone.

There will be less rioting  Most of the rioting is happenin from the police anyway. I’m half kiddin, but let’s call tear gassing protestors the fed’s version of “rioting.”  All Biden needs is to people back to working again, &amp; to do even moderate police reform. Workers don’t riot

That was his father.  Secondly, everything Biden has done on race is factual.  All Trumps is media generated.  You dodge facts every time.  Look u vote for your racist and ill vote for the media hated Trump.
Real news is cities are destroyed over racism and people want to elect an actual racist in Biden! That’s why things don’t change because people vote for the same policies with a different name tag.   Things were great before China destroyed the world.  All FACTS!!!!
Who do you think you’re kidding? Biden will win and AZ will have 2 Democratic Senators. Get used to it.

I rather vote for the media made racist than the actual racist in segregation Joe Biden.
I think we’re going to see another era of one term presidents over the next decade. Trump will likely lose, Biden will decline a 2nd term and his VP will likely run and win but party fatigue will lead to a GOP win in 2028. By the end of the decade we’ll see the 48th President.

I’d like it on the record that I’m in favor of hurting god. I’m not sure if this is even possible or even if they even exist.   That being said   I know Joe Biden is not in favor of hurting god, but I would just like Twitter to know MY position on the matter.
question for the only 2 military men I know.  If Biden wins, will he apologize to Japan on the 70th anniversary next August for dropping the bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki?

Biden was the moderate, thank you black voters in the south and the influence of Clyburn’s endorsement. We need someone to bring in the progressive wing, and it’s Warren. Also, Clyburn very recently made it clear that the VP pick doesn’t have to be a black woman... 🤔

I just saw the first ad from Joe Biden that has made any sense so I am impressed. It was nothing he said mind you, only that it aired on Comedy Central.
With this election it’s more important than ever to have debates.  The NYT’s and the DNC are afraid that Joe Biden will show the country and the rest of the world his weak mental capacity. It’s not Joe’s fault. The country needs to make an informed decision.
If actual think the market will hold a Biden election you are delirious.
Praise God for oir Great President for standing up for God and four country to protect citizens from these diablocal plots that has berlen ravaging this nation for decades. We we can not have a repeat of Obama-Biden era  in the White House.

I truthfully believe once Biden is in office, EVERYTHING is going to change, and not on Biden’s initiative, but Congress. They’re going to want to safeguard the presidency to never get as close to a dictatorship as it has with Trump in office. I foresee several amendments coming.
I see. But wouldn't almost all the concerns that applies to Biden with regards to age and health conditions also apply to Sanders. Also, I think Bernie made a lot of errors during the primary and his loss was not the result of only an unfair primary.

lol, you going by hearsay but ignoring Biden voting against desegregation and didn’t what his kids going to school with black kids. Yet you ignore Trump doing the most for blacks than president ever
We need to put equal effort into flooding Biden's tweets with positive reinforcement as we do with confronting republicans' tweets. There is a great disparity, republicans are flooding Biden as we do tRump and it is negatively influencing potential voters.
I can’t follow the reasoning because Trump is only focused on his own agenda. We have proof of the horrible job he’s done over the last 4 years, it won’t get better in the next 4. Biden will be bullied by actually progressives in offices to push forth issues we need seen.
WE NEED A LANDSLIDE (FOR BIDEN)
Good call! Biden will listen to his team as opposed to Trump. We all might dislike Biden, but we have to trust that those filling other positions in office will actually have influence in issues that were actually concerned with whereas Trump is only worried about his own agenda
Joe Biden - faith.
got anything to add to Kayne West saying his sole purpose in this election to help Biden lose? Because you were roasting people left n right the day he announced his candidacy
This is pretty much the only logical explanation for voting biden I’ve ever seen. When it’s all “he’s not trump” that doesn’t reassure me of anything. I don’t know if I can pull myself to continue contributing to an organization that appears to neglect the people. But compelling!
Get specific please. Have you read Biden’s plans??? Go online and read them then get back to us on where we can read Trumps plans laid out like Biden’s.
I sure hope this is wrong. AOC is the future. Her being excluded will discourage young people from voting for Biden.
*Pandemic released on the world by China railroads the global economy for months.  People can’t go to work anywhere in the civilized world because of the need to slow spread of virus.*  Biden: Orange Man Fault.
Classic racist Joe Biden.
Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden says he will not stand in the way of prosecution against President Trump from the Justice Department if he is elected.
Saw some opinion article where they said they would wait and see who Biden's V.P. pick would be before deciding. I was prepared to vote for a toothpick to be president. I don't know how any Dem V.P. could drag the ticket.
Daily reminder that Joe Biden would be be 78 when inaugurated, is clearly not all there, and his potential Vice President is being chosen based on gender and race
Why? So he can steal 11 votes away from Biden?
You presume that, because I criticize Biden, I support Trump?!? 🤣🤣🤣  Please try to widen your scope a little bit!!!  I DESPISE DONALD JOHN TRUMP AND WISH FOR HIM TO BE BANISHED FROM SOCIETY  …which is why I'm so angry at the DNC for pushing Biden as the nominee!!!
If she's being "heavily vetted" ehy doesnt the Biden camp know this? Ugh!
Senate Republicans advance Ukraine probe aimed at Biden despite foreign interference concerns - The Washington Post / Really ⁦ This is the Republican message!Go attack Our Vice President on Foreign soil just like ⁦ ⁦
Well, my voting life includes Lieberman, Cheney, Edwards, Biden, Palin, Ryan, Kaine, &amp; Pence.  I think Palin was the worst pick of that group overall.
Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden says he will not stand in the way of prosecution against President Trump from the Justice Department if he is elected.
You know you're a truly terrible human being, right? All the way, even deep deep down. As #LadyG put it, you're "gonna get destroyed &amp; we're gonna deserve it." #LadyGraham knows Biden's the man for the job. #BlueTsunami #Biden2020Landslide #ItIsWhatItIs #TrumpVirus #TrumpGenocide
Yesterday I made the mistake of telling people on my Instagram that Biden is a racist not a Trump level racist but a racist none the less. We can't make excuses for his behavior because he's not as bad a Trump.
Joe Biden will need to be kept under constant pressure  if we hope to see justice for what the Republicans have done the past four years as well as making any advance on climate change, healthcare, racist policing, et al. Returning to the status quo is not acceptable!
Not at all saying that I like the alternative, but no one should be able to say that they are comfortable with Biden as President...he just isn’t with it enough anymore
Maybe, but I'm not so sure about that. Will the "moderate" independents be comfortable voting for a Progressive like Sanders and Warren? Part of Biden's appeal is his relative "moderation" in comparison with the other Dems.
joe biden’s campaign and joe kennedy’s are exactly the same i see
Aug 6 - part 2  V - OH Gov DeWine tests positive before meeting with Trump. Then tests negative....hmmmm BTB - Thighland. Biden hurts God. CV -  Michelle Obama says she’s depressed...welcome to the Club  EL - Pelosi, Schumer write to Postmaster General DC - still no deal
My true thought is the Dems are too far down the road with Biden.  I believe he will be "Epsteined".  Causing a "feel sorry" movement while plugging Hillary back in.  I truly believe this may already be being planned.
If anything good comes out of a Biden presidency it will be because massive movements of American people persist in protests and activism.
I actually respect Brett a lot and like to hear his perspective on things (although I disagree with a lot of his politics). It's just that at this point in time, replacing Biden is no more than wishful thinking.
Karl Rove is ready to give Biden a chance real soon, imho. #FoxNews

Well, most "Not Trump" people will probably vote for Biden. So it's essentially the same thing.

I wouldn't be surprised if she Votes for Biden on the down low and she just doesn't want to announce it publicly.
I will say it right out. I am a former Republican (until Bernie 2016), I can't stand Biden. I think he is a bad candidate  At this moment in time, there is a fundamental right and wrong with limited choices Voting for Biden is the right thing to do Sorry I can't be more upbeat

Can Biden please listen to free advice from  and please shut his mouth while talking?
Biden: "I'll announce my VP pick by the end of the first week of August."  Political Twitter at 12:00 on Friday, August 7th:
Trump claims that Biden's America will be so bad that even Trump will be president.
Oh that’s where he got the inspiration for the crime bill?   Trump’s comments are always absurd. Not sure why there’s a need from Biden to highlight his religion despite the critique. Not like it persuaded any Trump voters to perhaps consider Joe’s religious inspirations.
I stand with Joe Biden.
Here's evidence of "Jim Crow" Joe Biden on his true views on black and hispanic people:
I can't conceive of it.  That said, even though he wasn't my 1st (or 2nd, or 3rd) choice, I'm not sure Joe Biden isn't the right person for this time, but I think most of his advisors, donors, and hangers-on are doing the country, him, and his potential running mates harm.

Thebreal Joe Biden on people of color:
The gaffe machine strikes again. In the 80s I was actually impressed with Biden’s energy but nowadays.....
Here's the real Joe Biden:
Today would be a good day for Biden to announce his VP!
BIDEN IS JUST AN EXTRA ON THE SET OF THE WALKING DEAD.  PEOPLE WILL HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO VOTE FOR TRUMP AGAIN.  UNLESS KANYE CAN PULL HIS SHIT TOGETHER IN TIME FOR VOTING DAY- WHAT KIND OF FUCKED UP WORLD ARE WE LIVING IN??
Then there's the real Joe Biden exposed:
Same!  I am still voting for Joe Biden!
Bear in mind that there's a good chance that Biden's VP will face primary challenges in 2024.  I'm sure that Harris or Rice will do a fine job as VP or President until then, and then we can choose from among a robust field of candidates without having to worry about Trump.
And before Biden was senile he was just plain evil:
Biden can pronounce the names of all our National parks, so...
Joe Biden exposed:
good one! here’s a hypothetical:  let biden win. he plays bernie’s lil sheep. he has to. more progressives get a real voice - not just on twitter. keep ranting, keep fighting. squad and others split from the dems. hooray multi party system. and so one.  let trump win. we’re done

Nothing will keep me from voting for Joe Biden but my preference would be a woman of color. So many good choices and the moment calls for it.Theyre both pretty shit but idk if biden has any brai capacity to do anything harmful if he continues to just keep his mouth shut. His comments in hispanic and black folks was rlly tonedeaf
Honestly, anyone who actually votes for Kanye wasn't going to get it together to vote for Biden. If it's costs him a dozen votes nationally, I'll be shocked.

Trump is exaggerating. Biden just keeps the Ultimate Nullifier handy in case Galactus shows up.

Trump is saying that Biden hurts God. He hates God. Biden is leaning to far to the left to the socialists. This is coming from a man who ingratiates himself to the biggest socialist on the planet...Vladimir Putin.
Great slogan for the Biden campaign.  Pushing  to respond to the base and the message is  taken by the electorate is that the president is against your children's right to feel safe in their classroom.

Biden shouldn’t give him the air. Trump doesn’t belong within six feet of the same stage as him.
Biden campaign shirts lmfao
At the time of announcement the left was pretty clear wrt why we didn't think people like AOC should be taking part. They were lending their credibility to Biden-- who has his own primary voters' blood on his hands-- just by showing up and weren't going to get anything in return
This is EXACTLY what happened with the Sanders/Biden Unity Commission or whatever it was called
Fun fact Biden owns guns and is a member of the NRA.

i really wanna punch joe biden
I was just informed that the sentence "a vote for Biden is a vote for the single person most responsible for the modern slave state" is a moral stance rather than a factual statement  liberalism is a hell of a drug
the consequence of your lack of anti Biden action is eight years of a fascist presidency
Biden is responsible for the creation of the modern slave state  And you are supporting him  Facts don't care about your feelings
He isn't even officially the fucking nominee yet  There was no reason why anyone had to commit to Biden as early as they did  And whether you like it or not the cause of white supremacy was advanced by that surrender
Joe Biden has enough faith for all of us. That's how strong his faith is. He would have never survived all the heartache &amp; loss without it.  I know Catholics with this kind of faith. I was raised by them. It's unshakable &amp; eternal. It's foundation is forgiveness &amp; love.
Biden should just come out and just recite verses of the Bible and then Make trump do the same during the debates and when he can’t.  Just look at him and say you must of been to busy paying off porn stars to learn the Bible.
Trump believes he's god &amp; Joe Biden is going to hurt him with his bad juju energy.
Is it bad that I hope Joe Biden dies so there is no chance of him winning?
My Nana had faith like Joe Biden. Absolute &amp; Unwavering. The foundation of that faith was forgiveness &amp; love. Always love.  That's how they got through the heartache &amp; losses. That's how he'll get us through this. His faith is big enough for all of us.
I could be wrong, but in my opinion trump keeps the political engine working with give and take. If the democrats get the office with Biden they will be able to railroad everything. Republicans hate Trump, which keeps things somewhat balanced.
The whole “any option is better” rationale doesn’t work for me. Any president would have been screwed during this year. The country was on a good path before covid. Biden using corona in his ads is frankly disgusting.
Trump is a piece of shit. But he is capable of being a leader, whether you like the direction or not. Biden terrifies me. The people who will get control of the office behind the scenes, while joe figures out what day it is is scary. Least with trump you have checks and balances
Panel rejects Donald Trump's request to add a fourth debate with Joe Biden  via
It’s because it’s who they wanted them to vote for. There were a handful of good democrats, and their names weren’t Biden or sanders. But they think Bernie scared away the centered democrats. But Biden is trickier. Anyone who values their vote on stances will have difficulty
Bernie was the candidate of the actual people. Bernie was leading before Super Tuesday. The democratic leadership knew Bernie would lose to trump so they basically put all their money and effort behind him. It was the right choice, but let’s not pretend dems wanted Biden.
I report his tweets when I see dangerous lies about voting, covid, Biden, et al. Twitter tells me they've received it but that's it. We all need to report him. We're not lying.
This is classic Biden. Just another day at this point
This is taken out of context, as per usual via racist rag Breitbart. He was referring to voting trends, not people's actual genetic make up. They grasp at straws to make Biden look bad, trump does it all on his own.
Haven’t seen a single Biden sign or bumper sticker here in Massachusetts’s. People are quite proud in their display of support for tRump here.

The democratic leadership failed us. 4 years and a presidential seat ripe for the taking and they gave us Biden. Democrats are now forced to vote for Trump or ignore reason and vote for Biden just to be against trump. I for one vote for the best option, it’s sad Trump is that.
A little free lesson in Boolean logic for you: If you don't vote for Biden, then (by definition) you don't *actively oppose* Trump.  You can vote or not-vote however you like. You can prevaricate all you like. But that's how binary choices work.  Either own it, or kindly STFU. 🤷
Joe Biden is a white supremacist  The people who he is courting with The Lincoln Project are white supremacists  If you don't want those people to have power, supporting Biden is a foolish way to show it

Trump is actually leading. Chris Wallace &amp; the Media are in denial.   Furthermore, Trump would relish more debates with Biden. Biden is cognitively challenged. The more he’s exposed. The more it’s exposed. The more votes he loses.  Trump knows that only so well.   Chris doesn’t.
Biden has been a racist for many years.
So trump is God &amp; Biden is going to hurt him with all that bad juju energy. Got it.
I can’t believe Biden is going to ban religion if he becomes president. I mean who believe that nonsense.
Remember when the said this for 8 years under Obama/Biden and it never happened? Yeah, same applies here.
Wow,  is SO POWERFUL that he can actually "hurt God." That's one powerful dude, that #JoeBiden.  Also, pretty sure  is scraping the bottom of the barrel at this point. If Biden is already "hurting God," what's left for September &amp; October?
Trump just said Biden will "hurt the bible, hurt God. He's against God, against guns against energy."  I would volunteer for JRPG protagonist Biden.
Biden was never my pic because he can’t stop himself from saying dumb shit. But he won the nom so he gets my vote. I’m so broken I’d vote for John McCain’s corpse at this point.

Dear DNC — you forced this embarrassment of a candidate on your party. Biden is, at best, the lesser of two evils. Please do everything you can to keep him from talking until the election if you want him to win. That’s your best strategy by far.

It's almost as if literally nothing about Trump changes that Biden is a rapist, a white supremacist and a war criminal
Not to mention the literal neocon war criminals who are backing biden and controlling the narrative against Trump. I'd rather fight them than demented fascist incels 4chan rejects.
Literally every negative thing you could say about Biden is more true of Trump, and it will be easier for the far left (people like me) to fight against a biden administration than it is for us to fight Trump because we won't have centrists liberals screwing with our message.
Look let me clear something up, I can and do agree that biden is week, lacks enthusiasm from the left not his base,, and both he and trump are senile as all hell. But that doesn't matter, Biden is winning, and if you held a gun to my head I would prefer him to Trump.
After the 1st debate, you'll probably lose supporters.  You can't answer any questions about policy, foreign relations, or about anything else.  People are catching on to your lies and confabulations.  Most people already know they're voting for Biden.
President Joe Biden
Totally misunderstood. Are they saying Biden supports the inequality or they saying he supports the solutions Bernie proposes?
Because they see it as fewer people able to vote for Biden.
biden is gonna pick Elizabeth warren then resign jus saying❤️
I mean I'm not voting for Biden, but I live in MA, if I lived in a state that actually mattered I probably would. And while I'm not going to try to guilt people who do into doing so, I certainly wouldn't begrudge people who publicly point out that its a good idea.
Trump and his people are already trying to paint Biden as somekind of Maoist, and as an actual socialist I find that insulting. Overt bigotry, well obviously I'm not ignoring that when I see it, because you are right, we will see it.

Biden garnered a majority of the support of *old* black people, Bernie Sanders had huge support among younger black people. Which is the same split that happened in most demographics  Pete however, failed to even poll about 3-4% nationally w black voters
So you are saying joe Biden is not in a state of mental decline
That’s not a stutter. He never talked like that when he was VP. He’s suffering from severe mental decline. Want to know what’s low? Saying to black people that the GOP is gonna put y’all back in chains, or saying that you aren’t black if you are unsure if you want to vote Biden.
I can empathize. I too had to manage 8 yrs of”low-grade depression” during Obama-Biden years.  I have no desire to have manage that again. So, I’m voting a strict Republican ticket this November.

They’re also lying when they say that, they absolutely will not do that and will instead shiv Biden so they can reinstate themselves as Bush-era republican leadership.  We’re headed right back to 2000-2008 once 2024 rolls around if the Dems don’t smarten up, which they will not.
Terrific conversation between    &amp;  and great perspective from  on *what* elections are:  "We are choosing who we are holding accountable. I would rather hold Joe Biden accountable than try to hold this- whatever this is- accountable."
That’s why they’re getting things in place now so there won’t be a Democratic administration past 2024.  They’re going to shiv Biden gleefully and blame him for being unable to fix the fallout of the trump administration, and they’ll present themselves as the way forward.
Notice how he cherry-picks the one bit of information that makes him look good, yet ignores the salient parts that reflect reality? Like, he’s behind Biden by double digits. I think Putin had 99% approval in his party, and Kim has 100%. Gotta do better.

Very thankful we have a deep bench for VP and I trust  to make the right choice. But like many I have a favorite -- and this heartfelt endorsement of  by civil rights leader  is a powerful must read.
Sounds like he pitching for How Biden.
Biden will be as progressive as FDR that's what I'd post to alert people.
and as for Biden winning:  here's clear proof Sanders won &amp; DP installed Biden.
It's about the future and what your vote leads to. Trump is a disaster and Biden may be somewhat better short term but not good enough to prevent people from voting for a future more competent and more dangerous version of Trump down the line.
Biden is most definitely unfit--in mental decline, inappropriate with females, and a 1% centrist republican who will maintain the status quo &amp;  capitalistic greed.
This approach doesn't challenge or take on the DP lie that Bernie lost and Biden won. Stand up for the whole truth. Don't barter with the deception to gain crumbs that ultimately won't  bring #GreenNewDeal, racial &amp; gender equality &amp; justice and an end to psychopathic rule.
I'll vote for Biden *especially* if he starts skipping down the street in his underwear singing songs from Grease
We refuse to accept the DP destruction of our votes and arbitrarily naming Biden the winner to maintain DP power &amp; control.   I'm voting for the real winner of the 2016 and 2020 primaries, Bernie Sanders.  Will you join me?
If Biden wins there won't need to be a rightwing version of #Resistance because Biden won't be a criminal despot in hock to a hostile foreign power and bent an undermining the rule of law.  *There will be a relentless rightwing assault on the Biden administration anyway.

It was meant to emasculate Biden on some level, I suppose... but ironically it seems to have given him an almost Reagan-level teflon coating.   "Dopey-Slow Joe can't have done that--- he's just way too Dopey! And Slow!"  (I wonder if it'll hold?🤷)
Popular culture (SNL, etc) has portrayed Biden as "Dopey Uncle Joe" since long before he was even VP. So everyone "just knows" that "Biden isn't smart."  (Just as everyone seemed to "just know" that "HRC was corrupt", despite little real evidence of her being particularly so).
When President Trump wins on election day.  Then fake media will announce Biden won to cause riots.
Over 60% of Americans approve of Universal Healthcare (Medicare for All). It would be great if Biden would get behind that too.

I don't feel like listening to your pro 1% aligned selling of Biden. Blocked.
"vote for Biden" is telling the DP that we condone and accept their behavior in changing our votes and falsely naming Biden as winner, when Sanders clearly won again.  Hold the DP accountable.
Many of us have repeatedly made comments similar to yours. We need to continue to state them repeatedly without backing down. We also need to insist that they stop pushing an unfit Biden on voters and acknowledge that Sanders won. This is our moment to demand a return to sanity.
I criticize Biden/Pelosi and will continue doing so. My vote against Trump is because I want him gone, otherwise I've had it with the DNC. Never again. We need to stop believing this "electability" BS and vote our conscience. A new way will never happen unless we make it happen.

I'd bet a year's pay that Donald Trump doesn't even know Joe Biden is a Catholic.
Let’s just call it my “Biden Moment” of the day. At least it isn’t 9am yet lol.
Well I guess I’m just a dumb, deplorable, Trump supporter lol. Whooooops.  I honestly thought you were defending Biden. My bad.
I thought you were saying that Biden wasn’t being demeaning.  🏳 🏳 🏳 Same side, same side lol.
Too bad nobody is going to vote for West
"Joe Biden clarifies comments comparing diversity in Latino and Black communities"
If Joe Biden picks some centrist for VP it’s gonna be a primary showdown in 2024.
Do not understand the idea some have that Kamala is owed VP by Biden. She did meh in the campaign, didn’t resonate with voters, has no major legislative accomplishments, and has never worked with or had a connection to Biden in the past.
Any vote other than Biden is dooming our country- you said it yourself. It literally DOES NOT MATTER who his VP pick is (unless it's Kayne)- anyone, literally anyone, would be better than Trump if it came to their leadership of the country.
Versus Trump America? I’ll take Biden
Hell of a lot worse than saying "I mean, you got the first mainstream African-American who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice-looking guy. I mean, that's a storybook, man." Biden said this about Obama, imagine if Trump said something like this.
Wrong, we all have different and likes, dislikes, opinions etc. Thank you for clarifying why I was not certain I should vote for Biden.

I never took him seriously either but it doesn’t mean he hasn’t done a good job. The guy WANTS to be the greatest President in history. I believe that drives him. Biden just wants to finally win a Presidential election. That’s all he cares about.
You think Obama and Biden did a better job running the country than Trump? You REALLY believe that? I’m not asking which PERSONALITY you liked more or who fit the part better. I’m saying JUST based on policy and results. You really think Obama was a better President?
I don’t think either candidates are sane to be honest. Trump hasn’t lived in reality ever, but Biden is literally in cognitive decline. I choose the one who actually has a choice when it comes to deciding what sanity actually is. Biden doesn’t know anymore.
Really? Fox posting a video of Biden speaking is trolling?    Trolling - posting inflammatory, digressive, off topic messages.   No I don’t think they’re trolling I think they’re showing the oppositions candidate.
Oh that I agree with which is sad. Trump is a shit bag human being, BUT he’s NOT a bad President. Biden isn’t capable of speaking a sentence with full confidence but he’s supposed to run the country? What’s better a bad personality who is obsessed with succeeding or a half corpse
The top reasons why Kamala Harris MIGHT make sense for a Joe Biden VP (....
Only reason I’m voting Biden is there is no other choice!  The founding fathers never wrote a bipartisan system into the Constitution.  Only two teams to choose means you’re forced to choose the lesser of two evils rather than a true representative 😢
You site your source proving this statement and I’ll vote for Biden, no questions asked. Just site your source.
If you honestly hate Trump for asking campaign advice or think it’s somehow evil, how do you explain Hunter Biden doing a $1.5 B dollar transaction with them and flying there and back on a plane that operates solely on tax dollars?
Biden made some statement that there has to already be enthusiasm for the VP because they won’t be able to campaign in person. So I really think it’s Warren or Harris. (Hopefully Warren)

Yeah it’s also possible Hillary ran a tight operation while Biden is not...
I agree that there could be a silver lining to the media ignoring her at the moment. Though I definitely think they have an agenda in creating buzz for certain names, just as they always have. Whether it’s just ratings (Trump) or corporate pressure (Biden, Pete, etc.).
The whole reason Biden is the nominee is the media.
Anyone else play “Pump it Up” by Joe Biden when their wife is breast pumping?
Yeah that’s why we heard so much about Tim Kaine from cable news prior to his announcement and weren’t totally surprised like who the hell is this? The corporate media has their agenda and they’re just hoping through influencing polublic opinion they can influence Biden.

Biden has a way of smiling/laughing at the foolishness of other candidates during debates. I have a feeling this will get under Trump’s skin. Biden won’t take his bait, and will hammer that SOB into the ground with stats and figures. Plus, insults won’t work well with Covid 💀
🌹 twitter did the same thing when it was down to Bernie and Biden. They said Biden would pull out because he had dementia/was senile. He walked on stage, completed sentences, and bam, Biden was declared the winner and he went on to win Michigan the next week. Underestimate him!
I’ve been thinking the same thing. Ore he’ll do the first debate with Chris Wallace, do horribly, get owned by Biden, and then say the Fake News, even Fox, wouldn’t give him a fair debate so he refuses to continue with the final two. Especially if he’s still down 8-10 points.
This is quite possibly the worst ad I’ve ever seen and trump was running one last week where someone gets murdered in their home for voting biden

Personally, I don't think Biden should debate trump until he releases his taxes.

The summary description of Jill Biden’s book still kills me— this is the most Joe Biden thing I’ve ever seen—  “how did you get this number” just gold.
You’ve got to maneuver on the team/ staff job angle as well as the qualifications of the nominees. What VP team does Biden’s team want or need to work with.   It’s a lot trickier than the nominees themselves.
If someone asked Biden if he’d pick a wombat for a running mate, beating out the person who asked him if he’d pick a woman, he’d have also said “yes”. Whatever they place in front of him, he always says “yes”.
I’ve got my thoughts on who the VP should be but let’s be honest, Biden could nominate Kasich and I’d still show up in November and begrudgingly cast my vote against this seditious failure.Additionally, it shows that Joe Biden is in no position to take a stance against the reopening of schools because he needs all the good PR he can get right now.

Considering the American people were unaware of the deep state &amp; its power, Obama's attempt to illegally take the Trump campaign down,Ukraine/Biden/China $ laundering connection, Congress being spied on by our Intel agencies, then yes.  If Trump wasn't POTUS we'd be communists.
If you don’t vote for Biden, you are voting for Trump.
Does this mean in reality Biden is doing better than the average poll and higher quality polls are better at detecting this reality or could it mean there is a bias that is somehow coordinated with your pollster rankings?

Biden must be starting to slip in polling and in the minds of people operating behind closed doors.  Here comes the Russia monster! LOL
Idiot  If you don't vote Biden then you're voting for Trump. How stupid can you be to even consider letting that happen. Agreed on VP issue but c'mon! It' CommaLa btw.
It’s so sad to say this but the best thing Biden can do for Black and Latinx communities is shut up and just win the election.

yeah, and he said, "Hi my name is Joe Biden and I'm running to get your vote for V.P. this November."

I mean, Biden is slipping in polls
Joe Rogan keeps raising doubts about Joe Biden's mental acuity
Joe did not clarify. His staff black pedaled Biden’s racist remarks.
And how demeaning will it be to give a Black woman the job of cleaning up the huge mess made by white men? Most of it will need to be handled by the VP...b/c Biden isn't skilled enough to do it on his own. Guess who can clean this up w hands tied behind her back? Elizabeth Warren
trump is a white nationalist racist. Biden is better.
That’s putting it mildly.  I’m glad he’s finally showing up Biden’s moral compass.  He hides behind his “good ol’ Catholic school boy” mantra when he’s a bureaucratic piece of dirt on record.
The market will also crash because corporations will freak out if and when Biden wins. The gravy train will be over &amp; I expect billionaires to have a huge temper tantrum.

Well actually it was the FDA and CDC who fucked this thing up royally, I can't imagine the FDA would have approved MORE tests in the early stages of the virus had Biden been in office
Half is an exaggeration. Had he made even one of countless Biden statements or actions, they’d lock Bernie away and toss the key.
Then Black woman VP will get blamed for every new racially insensitive comment from Biden.
What were the numbers?  Biden still slipping?
Someone should run political ads “Not going to vote because you thing Biden is going to win? Vote anyway, every vote humiliates Trump more and there’s nothing he like less then that.”

We need to #MAGA2020 - hope this is correct. Any #MAGAts at this point in the orange anus mouth's disgraceful period as their leader need to seek another country. Perhaps N. Korea or Russia where their values are similar.
Yeah Biden’s stances are not reflective of our views in most cases, but I guess I’m seeing past him as president and trusting that congress and the Supreme Court can implement MAJOR revisions to presidency as we know it today. Trump exploited every possible power trip he could
So basically what you’re telling me is, Biden is racist but trump is not👀... fuck that I am still voting Biden, I simply don’t like trump and his kkk administration.
"so he’s not gonna raise billionaire’s taxes"?  Sounds like you don't know what "facts" and "research" are either.
This question is sincere, but can I ask why you have decided to not vote for Biden? I am voting for him begrudgingly despite him being an awful choice, but for me personally it's better than more Trump. Just curious.
I truthfully believe once Biden is in office, EVERYTHING is going to change, and not on Biden’s initiative, but Congress. They’re going to want to safeguard the presidency to never get as close to a dictatorship as it has with Trump in office. I foresee several amendments coming.
I see. But wouldn't almost all the concerns that applies to Biden with regards to age and health conditions also apply to Sanders. Also, I think Bernie made a lot of errors during the primary and his loss was not the result of only an unfair primary.
It’s also just #Gaslighting and the EO will be held up in litigation until  is kicked to the curb. After this, President Biden can just write another EO eliminating this one. It’s all a shell game and a con. Always for  Case in point
Biden can do and get away with it. This is how Biden knows he got the black vote.

I think that Trump could plausibly lose, but it would not be because of Joe Biden or anything Biden has done.
My advice to the black community, Joe Biden needs your vote, tell him you will forgive him if he gives you (insert  demand). Politics 101, when you have political power use it
Here's the point you aren't getting. So #Biden attends Church &amp; you judge him to be sincere - fine. You say Trump isn't sincere - fine.  1/X
Especially once blacks get to know the real Joe Biden:
lol, you going by hearsay but ignoring Biden voting against desegregation and didn’t what his kids going to school with black kids. Yet you ignore Trump doing the most for blacks than president ever
We need to put equal effort into flooding Biden's tweets with positive reinforcement as we do with confronting republicans' tweets. There is a great disparity, republicans are flooding Biden as we do tRump and it is negatively influencing potential voters.
I can’t follow the reasoning because Trump is only focused on his own agenda. We have proof of the horrible job he’s done over the last 4 years, it won’t get better in the next 4. Biden will be bullied by actually progressives in offices to push forth issues we need seen.
WE NEED A LANDSLIDE (FOR BIDEN)
Good call! Biden will listen to his team as opposed to Trump. We all might dislike Biden, but we have to trust that those filling other positions in office will actually have influence in issues that were actually concerned with whereas Trump is only worried about his own agenda
Joe Biden - faith.
got anything to add to Kayne West saying his sole purpose in this election to help Biden lose? Because you were roasting people left n right the day he announced his candidacy
This is pretty much the only logical explanation for voting biden I’ve ever seen. When it’s all “he’s not trump” that doesn’t reassure me of anything. I don’t know if I can pull myself to continue contributing to an organization that appears to neglect the people. But compelling!
Get specific please. Have you read Biden’s plans??? Go online and read them then get back to us on where we can read Trumps plans laid out like Biden’s.

Saw some opinion article where they said they would wait and see who Biden's V.P. pick would be before deciding. I was prepared to vote for a toothpick to be president. I don't know how any Dem V.P. could drag the ticket.
Daily reminder that Joe Biden would be be 78 when inaugurated, is clearly not all there, and his potential Vice President is being chosen based on gender and race
Why? So he can steal 11 votes away from Biden?
You presume that, because I criticize Biden, I support Trump?!? 🤣🤣🤣  Please try to widen your scope a little bit!!!  I DESPISE DONALD JOHN TRUMP AND WISH FOR HIM TO BE BANISHED FROM SOCIETY  …which is why I'm so angry at the DNC for pushing Biden as the nominee!!!

Yesterday I made the mistake of telling people on my Instagram that Biden is a racist not a Trump level racist but a racist none the less. We can't make excuses for his behavior because he's not as bad a Trump.
Joe Biden will need to be kept under constant pressure  if we hope to see justice for what the Republicans have done the past four years as well as making any advance on climate change, healthcare, racist policing, et al. Returning to the status quo is not acceptable!
Not at all saying that I like the alternative, but no one should be able to say that they are comfortable with Biden as President...he just isn’t with it enough anymore
Maybe, but I'm not so sure about that. Will the "moderate" independents be comfortable voting for a Progressive like Sanders and Warren? Part of Biden's appeal is his relative "moderation" in comparison with the other Dems.
joe biden’s campaign and joe kennedy’s are exactly the same i see
Aug 6 - part 2  V - OH Gov DeWine tests positive before meeting with Trump. Then tests negative....hmmmm BTB - Thighland. Biden hurts God. CV -  Michelle Obama says she’s depressed...welcome to the Club  EL - Pelosi, Schumer write to Postmaster General DC - still no deal
My true thought is the Dems are too far down the road with Biden.  I believe he will be "Epsteined".  Causing a "feel sorry" movement while plugging Hillary back in.  I truly believe this may already be being planned.
If anything good comes out of a Biden presidency it will be because massive movements of American people persist in protests and activism.
I actually respect Brett a lot and like to hear his perspective on things (although I disagree with a lot of his politics). It's just that at this point in time, replacing Biden is no more than wishful thinking.

Remember when Beto’s endorsement in Dallas helped Joe Biden win in the Texas primary this past year? Good memories.
Sadly, I have. And I am in no way saying Biden is worse at this stuff than Trump. I am saying that Biden has never been a great public speaker, and has lately become a much WORSE public speaker. A hedgehog in a red hat would be better at public speaking than Trump!

I say the decision of whether to vote for Biden is not worth tearing your hair out over. I get that feeling, but do what feels right and just know you won’t be the reason he wins or loses, and remember his win wouldn’t solve everything. Focus on the other work to be done.
I LOVE how much baggage Biden’s VP candidates have.  WaPo is already calling people sexist for pointing it out.

Let's be honest here. Biden's mouth is a bigger danger here than any Russian influence.

Patrick is disingenuous re being a “conservative.” He even admitted in a Tweet 5 minutes ago that he’s happy Biden will be super liberal. He only calls himself “conservative” because he thinks CNN or MSNBC might come calling for his punditry. They’re not interested of course
You're not worthy to be president. Who are you to say who anybody is going to vote for. You're just mad it's not you. And sleepy Joe Biden's going to kick your ass in November and then you go to prison.

My remark still stands. UR entitled to UR opinion. I have no problem w/people supporting #Biden. I simply find  disingenuous.
For instance, if you want Medicare 4 all, student debt relief, and police reform, one of them comes first in your mind right? They aren’t accomplished simultaneously. Trump isn’t going to do any of this. There’s at least the slightest chance Biden or Congress will.
Joe Biden insults African Americans.
If you're a conservative or Republican who's going to vote for Joe Biden then as far as I'm concerned you're not a Republican. Don't understand how u can have conservative principles n yet support the man who wants to bring the country so far left China looks like a free country
“Biden loves Biden.”  First, respecting the office and our institutions does not mean that one has to respect the office-holder. Democracy means being actively involved, if only by voting.  I don’t know if Biden loves Biden, but Trump loves Trump more than he loves his Country.
2/2 The Democrats hope you’ll turn on Trump and blame HIM for ALL your troubles. But THAT’S about to BACKFIRE. Inadvertently, the Dems have STRENGTHENED Trump’s base, NOT weakened it. They know THIS is the ONLY way Biden can “win.” And now ? Mail In voting !
Who is doing this "heavy vetting" for Biden's VP? Seriously. Not so heavy
Biden needs to STOP courting white folks. He needs to secure his support among Black people and POC. We’ve seen HOW EASY it is for white folks to return to Trump without blinking a eye.
Another racist Joe Biden classic!
I'm gonna take my medicine, but goddamn is biden a horrible candidate. The final 2 candidates in this election have to be the worst final 2 in history. Anyone. Literally anyone is better than the current dipshit, but Biden is the best "we've" got. One step at a time though.
I just hope Biden is the less racist candidate...

Joe Rogan keeps raising doubts about Joe Biden's mental acuity
Joe did not clarify. His staff black pedaled Biden’s racist remarks.

trump is a white nationalist racist. Biden is better.
That’s putting it mildly.  I’m glad he’s finally showing up Biden’s moral compass.  He hides behind his “good ol’ Catholic school boy” mantra when he’s a bureaucratic piece of dirt on record.

Half is an exaggeration. Had he made even one of countless Biden statements or actions, they’d lock Bernie away and toss the key.
Then Black woman VP will get blamed for every new racially insensitive comment from Biden.
What were the numbers?  Biden still slipping?

Yeah Biden’s stances are not reflective of our views in most cases, but I guess I’m seeing past him as president and trusting that congress and the Supreme Court can implement MAJOR revisions to presidency as we know it today. Trump exploited every possible power trip he could
So basically what you’re telling me is, Biden is racist but trump is not👀... fuck that I am still voting Biden, I simply don’t like trump and his kkk administration.
"so he’s not gonna raise billionaire’s taxes"?  Sounds like you don't know what "facts" and "research" are either.
This question is sincere, but can I ask why you have decided to not vote for Biden? I am voting for him begrudgingly despite him being an awful choice, but for me personally it's better than more Trump. Just curious.
I truthfully believe once Biden is in office, EVERYTHING is going to change, and not on Biden’s initiative, but Congress. They’re going to want to safeguard the presidency to never get as close to a dictatorship as it has with Trump in office. I foresee several amendments coming.
I see. But wouldn't almost all the concerns that applies to Biden with regards to age and health conditions also apply to Sanders. Also, I think Bernie made a lot of errors during the primary and his loss was not the result of only an unfair primary.
It’s also just #Gaslighting and the EO will be held up in litigation until  is kicked to the curb. After this, President Biden can just write another EO eliminating this one. It’s all a shell game and a con. Always for  Case in point
Biden can do and get away with it. This is how Biden knows he got the black vote.

I think that Trump could plausibly lose, but it would not be because of Joe Biden or anything Biden has done.
My advice to the black community, Joe Biden needs your vote, tell him you will forgive him if he gives you (insert  demand). Politics 101, when you have political power use it
Here's the point you aren't getting. So #Biden attends Church &amp; you judge him to be sincere - fine. You say Trump isn't sincere - fine.  1/X
Especially once blacks get to know the real Joe Biden:
lol, you going by hearsay but ignoring Biden voting against desegregation and didn’t what his kids going to school with black kids. Yet you ignore Trump doing the most for blacks than president ever
We need to put equal effort into flooding Biden's tweets with positive reinforcement as we do with confronting republicans' tweets. There is a great disparity, republicans are flooding Biden as we do tRump and it is negatively influencing potential voters.
I can’t follow the reasoning because Trump is only focused on his own agenda. We have proof of the horrible job he’s done over the last 4 years, it won’t get better in the next 4. Biden will be bullied by actually progressives in offices to push forth issues we need seen.
WE NEED A LANDSLIDE (FOR BIDEN)
Good call! Biden will listen to his team as opposed to Trump. We all might dislike Biden, but we have to trust that those filling other positions in office will actually have influence in issues that were actually concerned with whereas Trump is only worried about his own agenda
Joe Biden - faith.
This is pretty much the only logical explanation for voting biden I’ve ever seen. When it’s all “he’s not trump” that doesn’t reassure me of anything. I don’t know if I can pull myself to continue contributing to an organization that appears to neglect the people. But compelling!
Get specific please. Have you read Biden’s plans??? Go online and read them then get back to us on where we can read Trumps plans laid out like Biden’s.

Saw some opinion article where they said they would wait and see who Biden's V.P. pick would be before deciding. I was prepared to vote for a toothpick to be president. I don't know how any Dem V.P. could drag the ticket.
Daily reminder that Joe Biden would be be 78 when inaugurated, is clearly not all there, and his potential Vice President is being chosen based on gender and race
Why? So he can steal 11 votes away from Biden?
You presume that, because I criticize Biden, I support Trump?!? 🤣🤣🤣  Please try to widen your scope a little bit!!!  I DESPISE DONALD JOHN TRUMP AND WISH FOR HIM TO BE BANISHED FROM SOCIETY  …which is why I'm so angry at the DNC for pushing Biden as the nominee!!!

Yesterday I made the mistake of telling people on my Instagram that Biden is a racist not a Trump level racist but a racist none the less. We can't make excuses for his behavior because he's not as bad a Trump.
Joe Biden will need to be kept under constant pressure  if we hope to see justice for what the Republicans have done the past four years as well as making any advance on climate change, healthcare, racist policing, et al. Returning to the status quo is not acceptable!
Not at all saying that I like the alternative, but no one should be able to say that they are comfortable with Biden as President...he just isn’t with it enough anymore
Maybe, but I'm not so sure about that. Will the "moderate" independents be comfortable voting for a Progressive like Sanders and Warren? Part of Biden's appeal is his relative "moderation" in comparison with the other Dems.If Biden wins, it is more than likely because a conspiracy of states doing what they can to steal the election.  Polls be dammed; I don't see ANY energy whatsoever with the Biden Campaign.

Biden needs to pick who he thinks will be the best governing partner. Plus he has reviewed all the vetting material so he has access to info that isn’t available to the rest of us. We should trust him and support h no matter who he chooses
It's entirely possible. It's also maybe predicated on the belief that the Dems wouldn't be able to respond to an economic catastrophe New Deal-style because of the filibuster.  And I thought too Biden would never go along with ditching it until Obama endorsed that yesterday.

And also would Biden even be running if he did not feel the pressure from the left to take down Trump?

Joe Biden names Kamala Harris as his running mate
Good piece by  on Biden's foreign policy, and how it's guided by his "horse sense of voters’ wavering commitments."

Vote for Biden as your best chance to be able to vote freely for a candidate you choose in the future.  Not voting returns the murderous dictator you now regret choosing in the past.

What progress do you think a Biden/Harris ticket will accomplish? It’s an awful option.
why do you need to “hear more” from Biden/Harris on trumps new birther claim? You know the answer - why give this slur air?
I’ve seen plenty of Bernie stickers.  A few Hillarry stickers.   But absolutely NO  Biden stickers.
Anyone else pretty much ostracized from their families because of their No Biden/No Trump stance?  If you're not team red or blue, I guess you're not fit to acknowledge as a human being. 😥
is a good option if you're in a state where Biden is likely to win.  Otherwise I'd say vote for Biden, because the majority of our country are unwilling to stop Trump outside of an election.

Wouldn’t it be sweet irony if the 600,000 postal employees proved to be the difference in electing President Biden.
It is the only card he has left until Barr tries to indict President Obama and VP Biden. Don’t be fooled, that is the card they are trying to play.

Pence: "Well, I've got some red meat for you. We're not going to let Joe Biden and Kamala Harris cut America's meat."  Omg. Some idiot Pence aide actually wrote that... "cut America's meat." Like in tiny little pieces for a child? Did no one have a think about that?

Bloomberg is an oligarch, and more dangerous than Trump and Biden combined.
Tell them to fuck off. Really.    These folks aren't interested in your reasons for voting as you do. They won't listen, and they won't argue in good faith.  A vote for Trump is a vote for Trump, vote for 3rd Party is a vote for 3rd Party &amp; a vote for Biden is.. you get the idea
Bull.  Total bull.  Stick it where the sun don’t shine dead-in-the-head biden.
gentlemen’s club in D.C.
What I get from this is that Biden is in remarkable physical shape.
Lol! So you’re actually saying the NBA lost out to Joe Biden... that’s hilarious!
He didn't "attack" Biden.
Bad job by  covering the presidents campaign speech .  He spews half truths and attacks his opponents. This is not a press conference. Give equal time to VP Biden!!
Our best path forward is get Biden into the Whitehouse, and then call out EVERYTHING and explain how to fix it. When the people observe how Biden in fact does not have the answer, we need to be there with solutions. This is how we win!
I agree with Vaush.  People see the problems now, but they will never learn that Biden won’t fix them unless Biden is elected and they see for themselves that he isn’t fixing them. If Trump wins, they will keep blaming it all on Trump without looking deeper.

Each night is only 2 hours long and he's apparently speaking first on the final night where Kamala and Biden are speaking.  So while it sucks it's only 2 minutes, it's in a prime spot. I rather he gets 2 minutes in a great spot than 5 minutes on a night nobody is watching.
When you move in January is there any chance you could leave a few pens behind so that President Biden can sign some Exexutive Orders before the Innaugural Balls begin. It would be very helpful. All the best.

Biden has a hidden talent -- clueless magic.
Unless you turn out to be a MAGA chud or a Biden apologist, you're safe 😆
Watching the news with my 7 year old brings me joy. She talks so much shit at everyone. It's hilarious. Biden ad- "we need to invest in American small businesses" kid- "you mean the business of Black Lives Mattering, which is a job more people should have."
Joe Biden is not entitled to your vote
You are absolutely right, we must become ungovernable and dismantle the govt. however, we must manufacture conditions that allow us to achieve that purpose. I guess some of us believe the Biden/Harris ticket would be advantageous in that pursuit
I’d like Biden and Kamala to address the fact that their ancestors actually both owned slaves!
You gave an outstanding speech today, Vice President Biden. You and Kamala are exactly what we need.

Yes. Let's do this. My only income is social security, Dr. Biden. I really cannot afford to donate, but I will shout to my last breath that Joe and Karmala need to kick that POtuS to the curb!
If COVID hadn't happened, Trump would have mopped the floor with Grampa Joe.. but he bungled the response so bad that even the doddering old fool looks like a step up. Biden likely wins.  6 of one, half a dozen of the other. Either way, WE lose.
Hey  , why the wall to wall coverage of the Biden/Harris anti-American hate fest?  You can't carry a full Trump rally
Watching Joe Biden and Kamala Harris makes me miss leaders who speak coherently, in full sentences and speak of the care of others. It’s their time.
I'm further left than either of Biden or Harris but I'm sorry, you can count me in the "any sentient breathing creature would be better than what we've got" crowd. I've been proud of looking younger than my age but 4 more years of this shit will have me looking 80 at 56.

Nahh Im watching Biden and Harris talk, you know, the next POTUS &amp;VPOTUS
How a personal connection led Joe Biden to pick Kamala Harris #GREATDEMS #LETSWIN
No, it isn't.  Don't get me wrong, I'm sure that much will change but the odds and polls were never this much in Clinton's favour.  Biden is already running a better campaign than HRC by letting Trump chat rubbish.

You know, this has been said before. But it still boggles my mind that trump, jared, et al. think that illegally pushing (absurdly faked sigs) Kanye on state ballots is going to entice Black voters to vote for him, even after Kanye admitted it to be an effort to hurt VP Biden...

Peak Kamala was when she came at Biden during the debates that one time.
The only positive to a Biden presidency is that a lot of centrists don’t care about policy they just want to not pay attention to politics. And when they see Biden being president doesn’t stop that they’ll have a choice republican authoritarianism or progressive ideals
If elected, Biden won't finish his term
We think it's a great day for Joe biden but he has chosen the wrong woman for the job and now he's gonna lose this race a sad day!
Dear mr Joe Biden I was going to vote for you but now I have to rethink my vote do to who you picked she's not one of us and now she wants to be one of us for our votes but we know her record
My God, Carr. This is THE bottom of the barrel of Op-Ed pieces...even for you. You can't fault Harris...although giving it the old college try...so you have to once again slam Warren and Biden (complete with tired old nicknames) to appease your base? Are you that out of gas?
Biden and Harris are politicians which by definition means they have issues.  Those issues do not include putting children into cages and then “losing them,” calling Nazis “very fine people,” and selling the lives of troops to Russia.  There is no third choice.  #BidenHarris2020
Im saying I have to see what Biden and Harris offer. If the only difference between trump and Biden admins is that one tweets awful things while the other doesnt. And if people still die wo healthcare &amp; the rich get richer under both admins what substantive difference is there?
Her history of attacking Biden does not make Kamala a hypocrite for accepting the VP spot. If you want to make a difference and do good, you will accept legitimately substantive roles working for people you believe made mistakes or disagree with.
Don’t forget about the entire Biden family. Including low life drug addict Hunter.

Vote green not trump. Perhaps if the Green Party does so well it costs Biden the election they’ll realize
The Democrats overlook that Hunter Biden will be a big issue that Trump will go after hard. At worst, there is a some really shady stuff going on. At best, he has pretty heavy financial ties to China. I mean he was “gifted” a 3ct diamond by the head of a Chinese conglomerate
Not gonna lie .. if people vote for Biden OR Trump, I WILL blame them...for enabling a broken system that's gonna get us all fuckin' dead.
Oh btw. How many pictures of biden have Epstein in them huh?   So what are you gonna do. Shift to obama?  Or just the standard trumpanzees response of duuuuuh democrat
Well hes certainly not the one who has 25 sexual misconduct allegations against him.  And biden sure as hell didnt call epstein a "terrific guy"
These are the same dipshits who refer to Biden, HRC and Harris as "Radical Leftists"  Clearly their judgement on political labeling is suspect at best 🤣
She has an in with Biden’s doctor. She knows that she won’t have to hold her nose long!
Biden is not perfect. He is also not Tr*mp.  Harris is not perfect. She is also not Pence.  Lives are at stake and we’ve got work to do.   Don’t want to do the work for Biden and Harris? Cool. Pick a Senate race.  Let’s focus, people.
Is Kamala Harris actually pro-Israel? Despite me losing my mind about her being our next VP, I guess that would at least mean that the Biden administration would be good for Israel (compared to our other options in the Democratic Party, at least).
Tulsi Gabbard would have been a far superior choice for Joe Biden over Kamala Harris. Doesn't really matter, they are going to lose so badly anyway.
Tbt to Kamala Harris joking about doing drugs in college, yet ruined people’s lives for doing drugs... also called joe biden a racist but yeah new VP for him lmaoooo Christ
Trump using Kamala's attacks on Biden against her is hilarious as he's literally calling him "sleepy Joe" in the same sentence and saying Biden wants to dismantle religion, destroy the suburbs, eliminate the police, destroy healthcare and let China own the United States.
If only John Lewis  could witness this  how proud he would be  BIDEN/HARRIS 2020  LET’S DO THIS
I also thought on this more and would like to say (because I didn’t explicitly say) that Biden is also not a shining choice (imo). In all I think Kamala is a better candidate and person.
Hey Moscow, we are getting our own relief on November 3rd. Biden/Harris, the Senate and a greater majority in the House....it’s over Turtle Head. It’s over.
No, but if you can make Joe Biden and Donald Trump disappear... I'll sign right on up! 😂
I'm voting for them not because Bernie supports them, but because Trump is the worst. Biden-Harris is the most boring, vanilla ticket we've had since I can remember.
If and When Biden has to step aside...how is anyone allowing this man to run for President?! It's insane and so damn sad
actually a fan. she’ll appeal to a lot of different demographics that Biden alone couldn’t get.

Why New Gun Owners Should Fear A Joe Biden Presidency -
Sorry to be blunt, Bishop, but you couldn't be more incredibly wrong. Both VP Biden and Dr. Jill Biden are devout Roman Catholics and life-long church-goers. And not that I care what religion any politician is, just that it needs to be out of government, way out.
I just unfriended and blocked an alt-leftist who admitted he'd rather have four more years of Trump than Biden / Harris. This is not progressive. It's psychotic.
I understand we will never get the perfect ticket. And trust me, I will still vote Biden/Harris because folx lives depend on it. But *sigh* I just wanted something more radical and progressive.
Harris also stated she believed Tara Reade’s acusation that Biden sexually assaulted her in 1993.
And as someone very astutely pointed out on the thread, how is it that the Obama/Biden ticket but not the Biden/Harris ticket has a Catholic on it?
87% or sanders voters voted clinton and it’s still our fault she lost, why would vote for a worse candidate. You wanted to win with republicans go win over republicans. I voted for Clinton. Won’t be voting for Biden
I’m not sure which I’m looking forward to more: Biden vs. Trump, Kamala vs. Pence, or the  cold opens.
I was voting Biden anyway.
True. Was a terrible policy widespread in this country that has decimated communities of color for more than a generation. I think she gets that now, but no doubt that Biden and Harris both have responsibility for the impact.
EXACTLY!!!!!   Hopefully biden/harris can rebuild the bridges trump burned.  I think they can, given i know people from other regions of the world.  Most do know trumps the asshole not Americans.  Ive seen iranian interviews that they just blame trump/government
Kamala has also called Biden a Racist.   Why would she join the ticket of a man she called a racist and said she believed the accusations that he sexually assaulted Tara Reade?
Whew .. I was fearing Susan Rice. Kamala is a total disaster and this ensures Biden will lose badly.  Not a drop of slave blood in her!  Descended from Indians and slave trading Jamaicans.
the “history” being made isn’t worth the damage her &amp; biden will cause
Breaking news: For his VP pick Joe Biden went to the depths of Uganda and found himself a giant 😂😂 #RIPKamala
Biden and Harris have a heart and a soul. Trump and Pence have ice water running through their veins, and no semblance of a soul.
I agree with the first sentence and I'll go as far as to say it's about as good as I could expect from Biden. I was really hoping for a progressive (thinking they might sell it as circling of the party wagon thing), but at the end of the day, this sphere's gonna burn regardless
Kamala explain the face that “you” called Biden a Racist and “you” said you believed Biden’s accusers; on the sexual assault accusation!   Care to explain your change of heart?  Or why you sold out; for ANOTHER job opportunity?
Kamala recently called Biden a racist and said she believed Biden’s accusers on the sexual assault.  A great pick 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
The people have the right to choose another option then state run healthcare and I do not like Biden's gun agenda at all.
Biden and Kamala is definitely a BK that I’ll have my way! Here’s to a whopper of a victory!
It does matter though. If you don't vote for Biden, you're effectively voting for Trump.
Uhm....hello!!! China virus? Kung fu virus?  He literally blamed covid on them. Claims china was in cahoots with biden to ruin trumps campaign?  How about this?
I am so proud of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. We are lucky to have these two, who will bring back decency, honor, ethics,respectability, knowledge, intelligence, truthfulness, equality &amp; class back to the White House. In the age of Trump, these two are like a breath of fresh air.
that’s what gets me thinkin ya know. like I’ve BEEN super critical of her for a while, but I can’t get over the fact that I don’t think she would be this scrutinized for being chosen as Biden’s VP if she wasn’t a WOC

If you are acting happy that Kamala was picked to be Biden’s running mate, I can only assume you either don’t know about her record as a Cali DA, or you’re pretending this is good because it’s too late to change Biden’s pick and Trump scares you that much. Look into Jo Jorgensen.
someone pull my tweet from 2 years ago that said the only way Biden wins is if Kamala Harris is his running mate
Biden/Harris is the Police State ticket. And Trump sucks too. But there is a better choice.   wants to end policemen’s qualifies immunity BS, release non-violent offenders from prison, and fix the broken expensive healthcare system.  #LetHerSpeak #VoteGold
Biden, the guy who wrote the crime bill that gave police the power to act without consequence &amp; ramp up the incarceration rate of black Americans, picked Kamala, the prosecutor who locked up thousands for weed possession and blocked DNA evidence in a death penalty case, for VP.
Joe Biden. Forward ever
Agree. This is utter bullshit. Even if I liked Susan rice. I am glad that Biden picked who he liked.
No i knew. But its hard to tell one idiot trumper from another since you all sound the same.   No facts, just slander. Duuuuuuh democrat.  Duuuuuhhhhh biden. Deeeeerp obama.  Youre all clones.   And youre all obsessed with democrats because theyre successful and trumpers fail
So I’m surprise we haven’t seen a million tweets from   or Donnie Jr yet regarding Biden’s VP pick!  I smell fear!

Joe Biden selects his running mate with announcement coming as early as Tuesday
I'm not censuring anyone for endorsing Biden. The voters picked him based on the current election system on the books and we need to get Trump out. Yang and Bernie can't throw the establishment under the bus and expect to change hearts and minds for next time.
1) R's cut M's from security funding to embassies! 2) 163k + &amp; counting! 3) Biden/Rice, they've worked together for 8+ years! She doesn't take shit, one bad ass, she will help mend our foreign allies!
Is that what Biden is speaking?
Given the democratic push for something like universal basic income over the course of the pandemic, I'm surprised Yang wasn't invited...unless of course Biden wants to steer clear of that UBI.
No, I agree. But they are still popular Democratic politicians who are considered up-and-comers in the Democratic party and aren't "not being accepted" by the DNC. The DNC Convention is not just about "ideas", especially ideas that Biden isn't currently supporting.
Exactly. And for what? He fell in line with Biden, and now he's being left on the side-line. He should have stuck to his principles and chosen the candidate that better aligned with him, not the most likely to win.
No no. Nothing is ending. The DNC isn't a TV ratings juggernaut. There will be other opportunities. Most likely Yang is going to be in Biden's cabinet or running for NYC mayor in early 2021. Yang is a lot to keep the movement going. We are still full speed ahead.

First of all Biden was Tara’s employer....he was also marrried.

This is what a president says and does. Thank you Joe Biden. We need you more than ever!
There is also a very serious threat that Biden/Rice will continue the hawkish attitude towards Iran. It’s been well documented that Biden was/is against Obama and Kerry’s Iran Deal, and with Rice in the VP slot, it seems all the more likely that we will not go back to the deal.

To be clear, the strategy of regime change in Venezuela was well under way under Obama. Pelosi and other leading Democrats welcomed the rise of Juan Guaido with open arms. The Biden/Rice admin will undoubtedly continue a hawkish attitude towards Venezuela and will continue to....
Biden is likely to pick Susan Rice as VP. The reasoning for this is pretty clear: he wants to return to the neoliberal globalist status quo of US empire and reestablish the US as the world’s sole super power. This is catastrophic for the situation in South America and MENA.
Joe Biden tried to defund Social Security several times over his career.
Fake news by Biden what else is new
Takes great skill. You should totally grade your president on if he can ride a bike or not. The bar for Biden is that low anything he does that he Dosent completly botch and gaffe all over you try and use it as a strength

Trump was for gay marriage before Biden and  Obama but ok facts don’t matter
Biden tweeted that very thing today.
And you know that Obama or whoever he is will be the actual President should Biden win. That'll be end of whatever remains of America.

Biden losing with Buttigieg as the VP would be the funniest to me
Easy with all the Biden funny money they've scammed. Hard to believe this crook has the nomination. Apparently normal in that party, tho.
Just temp. if Biden wins, it will be down in a week once he is in office!
Biden is in the basement,yes.
Strategically, I think Biden might do well to choose a young candidate who can take over in 4 years and easily go another 8.  How about AOC?
Trump says the stock market will tank if Biden is elected. Of course - Trump has been buying up stock like crazy to artificially inflate the market. It’s all a sham, just like the Trump presidency and how dangerous mail-in-voting is. Evil incarnate.

Did Biden remember to do it again and I see you have to meet you there I’m sorry
The only bright note is that VP Biden and a new government not consisting of corrupt grifters and bootlickers can roll all this shit back again beginning in January.  Man oh man... VP Biden's to-do list is going to be epic. Calling all lawyers!
You would do better under a Biden administration. He wouldn’t make fun of your family.
Youre gonna keep doing your dumb whattaboutism bullshit arent you.  Trashing on biden isnt going to bother me. Im only in favor of him to get rid of cult 45 once and for all.   I dont care if biden goes on a shooting spree tomorrow and starts a drug empire next week.

Yes the left resorts to this because, sadly, it’s true. Can’t dialogue with ppl who seriously think Biden isn’t better than Trump after seeing all of the ppl dying. At least Biden would have competent ppl in his administration.
Biden is currently at a projected 307 electoral votes, whereas Clinton was at only 272. VOTE!
Americans need to be able to believe what their president says. That ship has sailed for Donald Trump. We believe Joe Biden.
That's why  is better at everything then you  #COVID19 #coronavirus #VoteTrumpOut #TrumpCantRideABike #Biden
Joe Biden is a good person who will surround himself with experienced, smart, capable people who will protect social security, Medicare, Americans, healthcare and the institutions that keep us safe. And that is a hell of a lot better than what we have now. #TrumpsGenocide
Beautiful, isn't it?  Biden's people are too busy making weapons and posters in their basements. They only bring them out in the dark wearing their cute little black ninja/isis outfits. Creepy..
Wow..  Right  why do you think China would prefer Joe Biden they .. already own him Duh #ChinaGate
No, I think she's saying that we can only remove Trump through an election, so it's too risky to not vote for Biden.
Your father, like your grandfather, had severe cognitive decline. Unlike Biden, your Dad cannot string together a coherent sentence, walk down a ramp or pronounce basic words SO STOP PROJECTING!
In Biden's plan anyone can get into Medicare. If u elect Trump again u are fully screwed!
The libs always “know their heart.”  I am going with the racism that has come out of dead-in-the-head biden’s mouth for the past half century and still he spews to this day.

Burn is supposed to be Biden 🤦🏻‍♀️😂
Not for nothing, but will Biden just pick a VP already.  I feel like I've been reading about how he's been narrowing down his list for a month now.
To be fair, Biden vs. Trump debates could be an HBO Comedy special
Yea they are... The Lincoln Project's members are republicans, among others, they're voting biden.
If Biden selected Dick Cheney I’m still voting for Joe.
Let’s watch.  “attacked for her ambition and ...for her bluntness.... In fact, we admire male politicians who are “really going places” and “tell it like it is.....just pay attention to how the women on Biden’s list of candidates are being talked about.”
"Why would anyone (Especially Black voters) listen to Racist, Rich, white, elitist and Fake Conservatives?" They voted one into office in 2016.... Kanye is mentally ill, Republicans are fraudulently trying to get him onto the ballots to steal potential votes for Biden.
You inflated a bubble. A crash is inevitable due to your idiocy.  Biden will have to raise taxes to prevent the government from collapsing.
Eerily prophetic if Biden wins.
Biden has plans for things...far from my favorite plans, but still plans

Only difference is they're not doing anything to help Biden whereas Putin is actively helping him right now. You all are traitors and trump doesn't mind admitting it. #RIPGOP
Joe Biden is America’s only hope to cure the disease you have unleashed on Americans, America and our democracy.
Senator Grassley is going to love it when Joe Biden institutes the Green New Deal by “executive action.”
There's not a lot of brain cell left in Biden's head that need the protection a helmet could offer!🤷‍♂️🤣🤣🤣🤣
As predicted. The Ds have become so compromised by progressives it’s unlikely $$ will save us.  The Trump RW is targeting the LW socialist positions Biden has been forced to accept by extortion. Bloomberg has endured plenty of LW attacks for trying to help.  Bernie is a traitor.
Make no mistake: this is political Genius by Trump. He’s going to go on the war path against Pelosi and the Democrats, and that can only hurt Biden. It’s sad that things like *crucial pandemic relief* are partisan political bargaining chips, but that’s the US for ya!
Swine flu in the US under Obama/Biden: 115,318 cases, 3,433 deaths.  COVID-19 in the US under Trump: 4.95 million cases and counting, 161,000 deaths and counting.  Now that you know the stats, who do you think did/has done a better job at responding to an ongoing outbreak?

You do understand there are actual indictments against Biden and his son in Ukraine? You do understand there is communist pushback against the Ukraine justice department stalling the issuing of warrants to Interpol? You do know that right?
Biden must have a press conference about what Trump and his goons are doing to the Postal Service, which rural America depends upon for medication and goods!

I still can’t square “beating Donald Trump is our top priority” with “Joe Biden is our nominee.”  This is of course because the Democratic Party’s real top priorities are preserving the status quo, protecting the rich and powerful, and neoliberalism for all.
Can you imagine what the racist old bastard Biden will spew when the President puts the pressure on?  Will be epic
Great. But please ask Dad to stop exaggerating that Biden would double your taxes.

He is way behind in Michigan and almost throwing in the towel on it. No current tv ads and not running his new rounds of Biden attack ads. Low dollar way to have some exposure, but not a concerning development given the reason.
Does anyone really think that Joe Biden will actually debate Trump?  Will there be a debate? Yes or No?
Who ya gonna vote for if he picks someone you don't like? ANYONE is better than Trump, and a write in is a vote for him. You might not like Biden, but if you're drowning and he has a rowboat, he can get you to shore. Don't wait around for someone else to save us.

To continue this thread. Biden NEVER should have committed to naming a specific type of VEEP. Self inflicted wounds are often politically suicidal. Pick the very best VP choice regardless of gender or race. And then commit to real diversity in your Cabinet.
This opinion only makes sense in a bubble, not in the real world we are experiencing today. I have a tendency to intellectualize myself, but voting for Biden just takes walking around sense (and I really hate it when people suggest they're mutually exclusive).
Next week: "Joe Biden is going to abolish air conditioning, microwaves and gas powered stoves."
I routinely got into fights with people in KY who argued Catholicism isn't Christianity.   So yeah people will absolutely take Trump's attack on Biden's faith and run with it.
You dont. Its just brainless shit talking.   Its an attempt to rally hardcore religious nuts to vote against biden

Of course he did. He's afraid to go to jail if he loses his Presidency (refer to the Articles of Impeachment earlier this year). Vote Biden or else we can see a dictatorship in the near future.

Prediction . . .   Biden suffers a stroke or something that will prevent him from accepting the formal nomination. Kamala will solemnly accept the nomination.  Of course, this is all scripted.
Well, I guess we will have to watch where they are spending. I think they have committed ~$280M to ad buys. But a lot of that money could be focused on retaining the house, not so much promoting Biden. I sure haven't seen too many Biden signs or bumperstickers, that's for sure.

As if anyone had to work to undermine Biden. This is some real Liberal Qanon stuff.
Totally. But yes, exactly about the shortlist. This is Biden, who no one (I know) has high expectations of. Why would our expectations of who his VP pick be so high? I was just relieved it wasn’t Whitmer, who likely would have lost him MI because she has turned her back on Flint.

amplify this message now! Let them do their job!
Hate to disappoint you. Remember,half the country still likes Trump. Biden is a complete idiot!
Can't wait for the debates! Trump will eat Biden's lunch!
somehow your twitter bio rings hollow. “I’m not GOP or Dem” followed by Harris/Biden 2020. Yeah, you’re right down the middle...Lol
Biden should make a prime time address to the nation on how to vote by mail and submit it EARLY. And just leave Trump's name out of it.
I always laugh a little when people on the right call Joe Biden a liberal... like the dude is conservative... liberal and democrat are not the same thing...
We lack a consistent national policy on treating COVID-19. I suggest the 50 US governors get together and create a consistent, uniform policy on treating this pandemic. Please support VP Biden's call for a national mask mandate implemented by governors as you've already done.

Biden? Is gonna do what? He’s a doddering fool. Perez get your head out of it and come up with a better plan. Two solid candidates would be good. What does George say? Does he like the plan or is there a suprise coming???

This is what I'm saying. For YOU Biden is less bad. For somebody without health insurance, likely living paycheck-to-paycheck, they have an equal chance of dying or losing their homes. Biden (quite literally) tells such people not to vote for him. Just be aware.
Or... they will die under either regime. For a lot of people, the two meal options are both broken glass. Biden, for you, isn't broken glass. Fine. Tread lightly around people for whom he is.
Let’s spread the word. It’s time to take a stand.
To a shocking number of people, both candidates are broken glass. They'll die (literally) under either regime.  Now, to YOU, Biden may be a pile of crap and you vote for him because of it. Cool. But be careful not to attack people for whom both are broken glass.
It there is a Trump press conference today, will you turn off your TV and social media accounts? We will.
“We aren’t going to let Biden and Harris cut our meat.” 🤣🤣 Better go buy your steak now before it’s too late .  God I hope there is a VP debate.
I kind of feel like not turning the A in Harris into a star of some kind is a bit of lost potential in the current Biden-Harris branding.
This is hysterical. Biden can’t speak, won’t debate, Kamala calls him a racist and old guard and now they’re a power house team? How is voter id, suppression? Mail in is/has ans aleays wil be fraud ridden. Do you want sovialism or America the beautiful!
Dear  You can turn the mail sorters back on. Your country is counting on you. Our future depends on it.
I tried giving you my reasoning for why Biden is as bad as Trump. I literally tried having a conversation with you. I asked you to show me the policies Biden enacted that makes him better. Never once will you willing to actually engage in what I was saying.
Insightful background about the process/priorities in Biden's VP decision. Comforting that they agreed to Biden's staff leading any decisions around building the combined Biden/Harris team after some of the personnel challenges in Harris' primary campaign.
#FletcherAlum  (F19) spoke with  about the #2020Election and a potential #Biden presidency.  Watch below  👀
I really dont see Biden being able to do any better.  Were also going to continue to get brutalized by the police.
Biden's policies have affected me and you personally because they are why we have Trump. Anything Trump does to us, we can thank Biden for it.
Biden wont
No religion needed. You blindly follow Biden and Harris.  Cult
They are the same. Biden is also responsible for why we have Trump.  Good idea, cure a disease by injecting the same disease and hope it gets better.  Yeah you're in a cult
What the fuck is with people calling Biden and Harris family members. I saw someone call them mom and dad and now aunt and uncle. This is cult-like behavior.  #BlueMAGA
Ive been having an honest discussion the entire time.  The thing is, I'm right. Biden is a fascist. Biden is responsible for why we have Trump. It's like you only want to win and dont want to hear my perspective.
What issues did you bring up? Biden isnt better than Trump on a single issue. Caging kids? Started under Biden. Police brutality, yeah that happened under Biden. Biden also wrote policies that made Trump possible. How are you not getting this?
You just proved our point. Thank you. Biden and Trump are the same.
Your arguing Biden is better. Thats why
I always love these predictions. There is no way to refute them. You can’t be wrong. 10,000 people die, would have been 50,000. 60,000 die, would have been 100,000. As Biden says, it’s horse puckey.
I'm not. It was shown to you that Biden &amp; Harris are ok with the human rights violations. You're making it out that its ok if they do that and making it seem like we all shouldn't be concerned with that
Biden is a fascist.
So then tell me what policies in Biden's past makes him so good. I want specific policies and how they actually improved the lives of the masses. I sure as hell can't find any. In fact, I can see that his policies are responsible for why it was even possible for Trump's election.
Really? So I'm sure you can tell me which policies that Biden has enacted that makes him so great?
🤣🤣🤣  Biden isn't better. Please tell me where in his record shows that he's better because, in reality, we have Trump due to Biden's policies.  Biden isn't progressive and he's no better than Trump
⚪️Trump lies all the time and he’s just being Trump.   🔘Biden doesn’t take questions with Harris on Day 2 of VP rollout and Johnathan Martin is getting high-minded about accountability.
Biden has written plenty of bills that pushed this country further right. Trumpism is here to stay. The DNC is ok with this. They get an enemy they can scare us with. Biden terrifies me more than Trump due to his policy record being a big reason the country is where it is.
You can vote for a third party or an independent.  No one wants Trump or worse than Trump but voting for Biden just tells the DNC they can keep running further and further left candidates, which will in turn cause the republicans to go further right.
Harris may have perfected the craft of "advise and consent" with Justice Kavanaugh, but there is only one founder of "This Is Personal" style Senate hearings, the creator of Borking, Mr. Joe Biden.
Keep dreaming. Were just going to get worse and worse. Voting for Biden enables that.
It's not just Hilary. Its been moving this way since Regan. There are a lot of things that contribute to why it was possible for getting Trump. Joe Biden is one of those reasons
Lol. So what you're saying is you dont understand the history of what led to the point where Trump could even get elected. This wasn't a fluke. This is the country that has been moving further right. You can thank Joe Biden for that.
It is a matter of values. Your strategy of voting whoever the DNC puts in front of you is exactly why we have Trump right now. Put Joe Biden in and then we get Tom Cotton in 2024. Great strategy

Except for the part where using social media not being progressive is just made up. Oh no, I participate in society.  Biden is far right. You cant be progressive and vote for a far-right candidate. Thats just a fact.

Not safekeeping. Fact. Biden is the architect of the 94 crime bill and copmala is all for it and imprisoning people who shouldn't be imprisoned.  Neither of them are for a single progressive policy.  There also neolibs who are fascist enablers.  That's not progressive.
You certainly aren't progressive if you're voting for Biden.
The CEO of antifa would never vote for Biden. Dude literally picked a cop as his VP

I mean all I can do is max out my donations to Biden and maybe do a little phone banking. I don't think I can meaningfully stop the worst from happening.
She basically called Joe Biden a rapist &amp; racist she has no integrity and Joe is a pedophile the Dems are making me vote Trump.
We’ve got the ticket. Now we need the votes. Everyone, it’s time to persuade voters and conquer the logistics so all voters can safely deliver #BidenHarris to victory. Together, we win

Honestly go through this thread and you’ll see that some of the shit she does is just as evil as Trump. She sent kids to ICE, she forced transgender women to go to prisons for men, she tried to ban federal funding of abortion.   I’m voting Biden. But these dems are evil af too.
Someone said Biden has an enthusiasm problem? Is that person still around? Hello...
Biden wasn’t President when this was taken or had anything to do with that. Try again. Christian doesn’t mean hate anyone that non white Straight and poor. All 3 things Jesus cares for
This whole election has gone to the surreal Charlie!😳. I can’t see anyone in their right mind voting on the ticket with Biden/Harris.
Paying attention to Biden’s introduction? I’m sure you’ll give it a thorough leaving alone.
It was a great speech for Biden and Harris today let’s all get behind them and vote  for them

Don't worry. The more time Biden and Harris spend in front of an unbiased camera, people will figure it out. Marketing can only take you so far.
Nope, I'm voting for Biden.
the higher turnout goes, the wider Biden’s margin over Trump
I think it's important to remember that the president is only as powerful as congress lets them be. Biden sucks, but get some progressives in congress and fix our elections. Making our elections fair removes all establishment power, as AOC showed us in 2016 with her 82% win.
Biden wants to help poor people obtain stable housing? Can’t wait to vote for him. Thanks for the heads up, Donald.
Kamala Harris Gives New Meaning to the Biden Campaign
Patients, healthcare professionals and researchers, hopeful that Biden and Harris might prioritize funding for and support for #cancerresearch if elected in November, as they both have strong ties to the disease.
Of course there's much at stake every single day. It didn't matter to me how long or how Biden announced the choice what mattered most to me is who was chosen - he chose wisely. The campaign energy has been low - I hope this choice re-energizes Dems/Independents/Lincoln Repubs
Joe Biden proves again that he doesn't actually care about the struggles that the disenfranchised people of America have to go through every day. He had the opportunity to select a real progressive as his VP and instead chose this rat.
The Democrats hated that Iowa and New Hampshire had such an impact on their nominee. Harris and Biden were 5th and 6th in those primaries. They just got a stick in the eye. Their opinion does not count.  Trump wins both states easily.
I hope Harris helps prepare Biden for the debates. Need to be as sharp as possible. Trump supporters overlook the presidents flaws and focus on Biden’s.
Trevor Noah Reacts to Joe Biden’s Decision to Pick Kamala Harris for Vice President  via
Don't pretend like this shouldn't be an issue that the dem base should have with the dems.  Biden/Harris are running on a Republican Lite platform. Unless we A. Raise hell like we have been this summer over the next 4 yrs or B. Overthrow the current system, nothing's changing.
Biden &amp; Harris have failed to support a genuine universal healthcare plan, opposed marijuana legalization and thereby opposed freeing POC wrongly incarcerated for drug charges, and resist supporting the dismantling kf the prison industrial complex bc their careers are tied to it.
Anybody who's telling people dissatisfied with the Biden/Harris ticket that they have to suck it up and vote for them is morally obliged to be out in the streets raising hell with those same people when Biden/Harris inevitably do nothing to dismantle the prison system.
Amazing.
Seems that  is pretty much awake on the #climate and #EnvironmentalJustice justice, with several strong efforts over the years
Gundlach – Trump will Defeat Biden; Avoid the Bond Market
Again, ho take your meds. Joe Biden can and will outrun you.
Imagine how Trump would respond to a woman who publicly challenged and criticized him. Especially a strong, non-white woman.   Harris may be a pragmatic or political choice for Biden. But they’re already showing themselves to care less about their egos and more about the office.
I can think of no greater contrast between our current petty, grievance-driven president than this: '"I’m not good at keeping hard feelings,' Biden told her."  Keeping hard feelings is about all Trump IS good at!   via
Tufts Psychology is very excited to be co-hosting a colloquium with  and  on October 7. Our speaker will be  who just published  op-ed on Kamala Harris:
No, it doesnt. There's nothing to back that statement up.  Biden isn't the lesser of evils. He is the evil that is directly responsible for why we have Trump.  Other choices are not a theory. they exist. You can vote for them. You choose to vote to keep things shit for people.
Kamala Harris Is Biden’s Choice for Vice President  ALL RIGHT 👍
via  Under her gaze, Pence has to defend a racist, sexist president. As he watches helplessly, Harris gets to talk about how that racism and sexism feel to a Black woman like her.
And then you have Trump calling strong women nasty and using racist language. “‘One of the reasons that it surprised me is -- she was probably nastier than even Pocahontas to Joe Biden,’ Trump said at the White House on Tuesday.”
Pence has to defend a racist, sexist president. Harris gets to talk about how that racism and sexism feel to a Black woman like her. This isn’t any ordinary clash of perspectives and philosophies. It’s an extraordinary collision of life experiences.
That's right, Tim. Nickelback was Biden's VP. All 17 of them
Is Biden going to put windmills in our beautiful beautiful suburbs? Why is he talking about windmills ffs?
I mean, I’m holding my nose and voting for Joe Biden of all people. That I don’t like his vp isn’t gonna stop this leftist from voting out the fascist. (We can work on educating the capitalists in the meantime &amp; afterwards :) )

I'm happy to put up one of your lawn signs.  For full disclosure, it will be next to the "Hate Has No Home Here" sign and the Biden/Harris sign that I just ordered.  All will be in front of my Black Lives Matter flag.

So happy about Biden/Harris!  It’s nice to see a rainbow through the clouds.
That "enjoy" thing always creeps me out. Almost 4 years in office and he still has no idea how to conduct himself as a president.  Biden and Harris will make mistakes, they're human but I think we can be assured the clown show will be over.
oh boy a bad cop with a history of incarcerating blacks and recently called Biden a racist and sexual assaulter is now his VP.  As long as it's a woman tho.  to hell with character and honesty right? #liberal #doublestandard

some good news in these trying times: this means that biden will possibly be picking up hil's former media team along with kamala. time to "pokemon go to the polls" again!
This is a strong ticket.  All the way with Biden and Harris!
Yes! Biden and Harris!
Ugh I wish we could go back to 2016 and be excited about Clinton-Harris instead of confused with Clinton-Kaine or resigned to Biden-Harris
I guess the plane was a ruse.  It's Kamala.
Makes perfect sense.  Perhaps I am too optimistic, but I suspect we will get there under Biden.
Let's see if the Biden campaign is smart enough to wait to announce the veep pick until right after Trump walks on stage for his daily televised masturbation session.
Biden's handlers are excited about all the changes Trump made, and just want someone they can control to use it.
We need the ENTIRE Biden coalition, including progressives, youngsters, Republicans, all races and genders. #BidenCoalition
Interesting. I don’t like Rice, but I’d still pick a Biden-Rice ticket over the other options. Jill Stein has destroyed any support I may once have had for the Green Party.
So the answer to this question is LIE.  If you're a Biden supporter and they ask you about mail in voting, say you're a Trump voter and you'll ONLY vote for Trump if you can vote by mail.  Problem solved.
Biden has been killing us for decades.
Monmouth - Biden +10
Saved y’all some reading, Nickelback is Biden’s VP
Biden winning would force me to finally learn a second language? This sounds incredible. Can we have the election today?

That is some hard core lineup there. Look at this amazing team Biden has behind him! Woot! #BidenCoalition #TeamofRivals
Let’s not forget that Trump praised China close to 40 times from January-April. On January 22nd, he was adamant that China was being transparent. At the same time, Biden warned Trump about the beginnings of a pandemic. Yes, Sleepy Joe was wide awake, while Trump continued to nap.
America had 4 years to come up with a viable candidate to go against Trump.  Biden is the best it could come up with. Let that sink in.
I strongly endorse Biden's pick for VP. She is wise, well-credentialed, and absolutely qualified to be president should that be necessary. The other candidates were all excellent choices - an embarrassment of high-quality talent. Now, I'm glad we can all focus on beating Trump.
JOE Biden you lie, PRESIDENT TRUMP, never said he would not fund Social Security. I can't wait until you debate our president, so he can tell you to your face.
I’m sure Biden would like to know who his running mate is as well.
Biden said he swiped left you know on that thing with what that thing does.
If Joe Biden can hurt God either Trump believes God isnt omnipotent or that Biden is a peer with a diety?
but I bet Biden the child toucher with the racist past is ok?  Wait so you like Bill Clinton the rapist pedophile more? maybe the Kennedy who murdered a woman? Amazing the level of double standards.  You are entitled to hate him but your hypocrisy is strong.

Biden a puppet and idiot !!  Biden wants to impose highest capital gains tax rate since Jimmy Carter in 1977
It is sexist to criticize Joe Biden, rapist.
I hope Biden has enough common sense to keep them self as sharp as possible. He can’t stumble on any responses.
Look, Biden needs to win for a lot of reasons but the democrats are perfectly happy with 90% of the shit that goes on
Biden, a sick man, a great reason to vote FOR Trump.
Hey Biden campaign - your twice-daily emails promising to let me be “among the first” to know your VP selection aren’t having the intended effect. Announce, find one of a thousand other things to fundraise on, and move on.Do what is best for you and your country.  Support Biden in order to RID us of Trump! Do not throw your vote away.
can’t wait for biden to sniff kamala on TV lol

Why would anyone vote to bring Obama’s and Biden’s policy failures and leadership back ?  We have so much more to protect then even before .  Voting proudly for Trump
"What Difference does it make"     Why not ask you this same question we all know you are doing the same thing.    And Joe Biden must answer for his 44 years of lying
There seems to be some misunderstanding.  Just because I don't intend to vote for Trump does not mean I'm voting for Biden
Only foreign policy Biden ever achieved was to steal money while he sold us out
Biden and his kind are the ones that created decades of inequalities So now he says he will make it better 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣If someone believes that they are stupid
You look fab, of course. How excited are we? Biden Harris! Already ordered my gear ready to work.
I certainly does not. Do you really think Biden would have selected her after months of vetting if there was the slightest doubt she could not be president? Get serious.
No, they threw away the Pandemic Playbook left for them by the Obama/Biden Administration.
Most of the MSM ignored Tara Reade, then briefly conceded the accusations exist, then shutup about it as to not hurt his chances in the primary. So to the DNC and your friends in the MSM... well played as always👍👏👏👏
I wonder how much phonebanking he’s done for Biden

Of course she didn't! She was just saying...??? No. If you take just a few seconds to think about it, she definitely was calling him a racist.
Yeah, I don't know. I remember predictions that Biden would clean Sarah Palin's clock in the 2008 VP debate, and that Paul Ryan would do the same to Biden in 2012, and neither happened. If you can memorize talking points, you can hold your own in this debate format. #Election2020

Strange in a non gender society Biden had to pick a "woman" vp
I’m not 100% sure Biden even knows who she is. The man is not fit for public office.
I can't wait to call Joe Biden Mr. President .
This is a lie. Biden has never been part of the far left wing. He ran and won as a moderate when many thought it was the year of the far left to take over the party. He held and holds positions the far left is uncomfortable with. Biden-Harris will win. Humanity will be restored.
Do you think he’s gonna let Biden upstage him he’s gonna drop pence and come up with his own women Vice President he will pick Sara palin his moron base loves her lol
Insignificant who Biden picked . We might flip a few house seats in Cali .
Exactly why im voting Biden Harris they have a lot of work to do but the Democrats always have to clean up after the Repbulicans will do it.
We dont care who he picked we are voting Biden because we need to get the Pysco who is letting Americans die and the economy tank out of office say whatever you want about her.#VOTEBLUETICKET
never heard of the one running with Biden going for Trump.
I don't even need to read the article. The 4 reasons he picked her: 1. Fuck Bernie 2. Fuck the left 3. Fuck the country 4. Fuck the world. Nothing will fundamentally change.
Since you’re so concerned about trump being a racist, are you equally as concerned about Biden’s constant racism?
It is always interesting to see what the opposite political party will attack the other with. Why is it a negative Biden picked someone who was quite outspoken against him during the debates, doesn’t it show maturity to not let personal feelings get in the way?
Reminder that the cops don’t care about sexual assault

Biden's new logo with Harris has slightly different typeface and I hate it
Yes indeed. I was prepared to be disappointed but would still get out there now I’m trying to order every bit of campaign gear I can get. Do you think the Biden Harris acid wash jeans are too much?
Went to buy my new Biden/Harris tshirt, bumper stickers, pins, coffee mug, beach towel, throw pillow and maybe even a bed spread but the store is overwhelmed! Such a good day.
Thank you for being such a classy lady.  I hope Biden/Harris will pull you into their administration. You would be a great addition.
The Biden Harris store is overwhelmed. This is SUCH a good day.
You understand it was slick w/ rain water and very dangerous. He also did not ask for guidance it was out of respect . Biden in a million years could not keep up the rigors of the office . He can’t even campaign .

I would’ve voted for Joe Biden in November but everything he’s done since Bernie dropped out has told me that he doesn’t want my vote. I don’t have a problem with you if you decide to, but I’m gonna sit this one out
Five months seems about right. I’m hoping for March 2021, but that’s predicated on a Biden presidency and a Democratic Congress starting to dig us out of the bigly sized hole Trump and the GOP are leaving us in.
I've heard so much from you and trump over the past five years that even if there were no debates, I'd still vote for Biden. That's the consequence of your consistent "party over country" approach.  Oh, and your party has become thoroughly racist.
I think you might be ready for a job with the Biden campaign now.
UNholy poopoo.  Can’t wait to see him in debate Biden.  Does he even listen to himself?
oomfs, i’ve already tweeted about this before but i will be without my phone or any wifi the next two weeks. if biden decides to do something big please yell at me in my dm’s and don’t unfollow me for inactivity xxx
Who’s the funniest person Biden could pick to be Vice President?

I think Joe Biden is probably a kind person.  His wife seems to be pretty great too.  But I just don’t have confidence in his ability to lead.  He seems to pander to much to the “cause of the day”.  Trump is ruthless, a former if not present womanizer but he’s a good president.
Shouldn’t you be cowering in the basement w Joe Biden?
hopefully at some point your trash “news” networks actually report about Joe Biden and tell America what an awful candidate he really is, rather than covering for him and acting like the propaganda wing of the feckless

Fuck Joe Biden! We want forward progress. Not someone that is going to continue to drag us backwards. We need real change.
Respectfully,  i wondering how anyone could vote for Biden aka Mr. MAGOOi will be one of the most happy people along with many others if joe biden wins :,) like i will forreal shed tears
If Biden wins, she will be President soon. Biden obviously has dementia, and not early stage.
Trump is so foolish that his supporters say he is not a politician as if that is a plus. That he does not use big words as if that is a plus. That he earns no salary as if it is true for this man steals like a monkey stealing a banana. Just unfit to be human

I knocked 1000 doors in salem/ Beverly.  430 answered. 55 were on the fence about Warren the rest asked for Bernie stickers/yard signs. Biden was dead hadn’t even brought his campaign to this state. The 55 were either being polite or were converted.

Same old thoughtless regurgitation of old talking points. Speak of "privilege" to an Anti-war voter? Smh  A Biden Foreign Policy ala Iraq, Libya, Syria, Honduras (already has eyes on forcibly returning Venezuela to the Petrodollar) will hurt far more people than both Trump terms.
Biden was installed as nominee specifically to keep Americans from getting healthcare and other such humane reforms. Imagine what kind of sellout creep you have to be to facilitate that.

Tremendous get for Joe Biden
Biden is supposedly targeting Texas but you wouldn’t know it from Democratic convention lineup
Joe Biden is being treated so unfairly.
Seriously, who are his political advisers? In some alternate universe, where he's getting good advice about fighting the pandemic, he's beating Biden by 8 points.
Is there any suggestion of illegal behavior on their part (as opposed to their followers), or are they protected under the first amendment? Because I expect the Biden admin DOJ to be super careful about who they go after.
wildcard nice thing about potential Biden presidency: without the FBI having been entirely compromised, maybe the person or group known as "Q" will get unmasked and either apprehended, or have their accounts compromised / taken away.
What impeached  &amp;Postmaster Gen Louis DeJoy are doing to our Postal Services is horrid.   is bragging about it. Register and vote. Biden cares about us &amp; will do a good job.  For what  has done to harm our nation warrants being fired.  Lets do it!

POUND Biden
We have nothing to fear, but fear itself. This nonsense should spurn more resolve, and  stronger solidarity. We must first donate to The Biden Harris ticket with time, and dollars, then encourage the undecided to vote, and vote Blue! The future is now.
Okay. A: At his age, Biden can be forgiven for his mind defaulting to 1917 when using the ‘17 shorthand (likely more Freudian than anything), and B: Any fast talker, myself included, can tell you slurring your words is quite common when talking at certain speeds.
Um...Bernie is older than Biden.
I've already found a DC-area crash pad so nobody can claim I'm a vagrant. I'll be standing in front of the Capitol all day, every day, until President Biden is installed -- alone, if I'm alone there.
my goal is universal healthcare, avoiding climate catastrophe, and boosting an alternative to our two-party oligarchy.   i can understand voting for biden in a swing state, but beyond that, why should anyone support him as a candidate when howie is also in the race?
Steve it must have been a lot of calls, for a big Biden supporter like yourself, who is telling other people to do activism. Just let us plebes know how many calls you made so I have something to aspire to.
Biden taps Kamala Harris as running mate, setting aside tensions from primary
my one vote - can push the green party to 5%, where they can get millions in federal funding and become a major party cannot affect the outcome of biden winning my state by *literally* nearly a million votes  in safe states, voting blue/red is more of a waste than green, cmv
Biden Reaffirms His Hatred Of Medicare For All  via
That's when private prisons started, but it's not when incarceration skyrocketed.  That didn't happen until the 90's.  All of this is publicly available information.  Here's what Biden was doing during the Reagan years:
How are people planning to “hold Biden/Harris accountable”? Second question: how are people currently holding Trump accountable? And how’s that working out?
WE WILL!!!! I will be voting IN PERSON for Biden/Harris on November 3rd! I don’t care if I have to put on a hazmat suit and crawl through broken glass.
He did do a war on drugs thing...which was heavily pushed by your guy, Joe Biden.  Seriously.  You should look some of these things up.  Google can be your friend.
Fortunately Biden then advanced beyond 3rd grade, whereas trump's thought process and reading level never matured beyond primary grades.
Joe Biden came out yesterday making a proposal for a nationwide mask mandate. VP pick Kamala Harris came out to speak after saying "That's what real leadership looks like!". Is it? VB takes aim with this &amp; hears yours thoughts.   LISTEN:   #vbinthemiddle
FOX News is propaganda just like OAN. Second, Biden is beating you badly in what we call the #BlueTsunami
How can anyone possibly compare these two situations. To quote joe biden ( come on man )
Every one of the production assistants will be masked ??? Joe Biden insists
The one who wrote the '94 tough on crime bill?  Yes, he's responsible for the current prison industrial complex.  Look at incarceration rates before and after Biden's signature bill.  Democrats have been 'tough on crime' since the '90s.  Where have you been?
I would recommend your looking at  feed for plenty of articles about allegations against Joe Biden.  Regarding corruption, he's got 50 years of representing corporations in Congress.  There are plenty of articles like this one.
Obama and Biden looted SS years ago. Joe doesn’t remember that tho!
but does me backing that “real opponent” do anything? how does me voting for biden actually accomplish anything, other than throwing away a vote that could’ve gone towards a party and candidate that support medicare for all and saving the planet and people on it?
Did you give the $3 to the Biden/Harris campaign like I ordered you to?  That's all you have to do. $3. Once. Then you'll never have to do it again.
And that "strong woman" said her questioning him was political theater.  That's not strength.  Your VP is an authoritarian who has exploited the prison industrial complex that Biden helped establish.  She's trash.
Better go do what I ordered you to do. Like I said, there will be a consequence if you don't follow my orders.  $3 to Biden/Harris That's all I'm asking. Give $30 to Trump if you feel like it. But just do as I just told you to do. Then I will leave you alone
Based on my read of the internet today, Trump is going to win re-election despite the fact that  1. Biden is ahead in every national poll, and in every swing state. Very clearly leading by a lot.  2. Trump is sabotaging the USPS and we all know about it 4 months in advance
Joe Biden still does not support #M4A Utterly infuriating.
He's probably one of the people who is flying with the Trump line that "if Biden gets elected, the stock market will crash". He's wrong tho, because even if trump doesn't manage to fix it, he won't leave. He's checking who in the military is loyal to him rn.
Good a better economy for Biden
“Trump’s view...was that Biden would prefer a candidate with Bass’s low national profile and one who wouldn’t outshine him.”  He's such a fucking narcissist he cannot imagine others thinking differently from himself.  via
Agreed.  If Tulsi and Yang cared about policy and being anti-corruption, then they would have endorsed Bernie.  Instead they both showed they don’t really care about the issues and backed Biden before Bernie dropped out.
Biden's healthcare plan is calling us fat individually
Yeah well, it happened in 2009.  Don’t believe everything Bernie and Biden spew for political points
Now I gave you an order to give $25 (OR ANY AMOUNT YOU CAN) to the Biden/Harris campaign, or else I was going to give you a consequence.  Did you do what I asked?
Or put on your hazmat suit and show up in person.   It will be MUCH easier for them to game the count when there is no visible presence at the polls with Biden/Harris pins on their chests.
“Mike Pence Says He's Not Going To Let Biden And Harris 'Cut America's Meat'”  😂😂😂
Go give $25 to the Biden/Harris campaign like a normal American would do instead of giving your money to a propaganda news network.  Do as I say, or face the consequences.
Biden is going back to the suburbs to save your loveless marriage with a person who cheats on you. Trump is your physically abusive spouse who is addicted to Vicodin from a work injury he sustained 20 years ago and for which he blames the union.

How many times did you visit Epstein’s Fuck island Jim? How about the island next to it? That’s owned by Joe Biden.
You’re very presumptive , I’m choosing anyone but Biden , just like your mentality seems anyone but trump (you’re supporting a geriatric) ,I would prefer if  ran , then your head would really pop off ... as a Democrat think back to JFK speech and stop wanting handouts
Ok. You convinced me. I am going to vote for Biden/Harris
Biden’s numbers are better than those in those states. Wow the pressure is really getting to you to hedge and just never be able to be proved wrong ever.
I don’t think Biden is going to ban cheeseburgers or whatever, but I have done quite a bit of research on how much of the water in the American Southwest is diverted to cattle and cattle feed and oh boy is that gonna be a fuckin doozy for LA, Phoenix and Las Vegas soon enough.
Great propaganda , as a union member we were at 100% employment and busier than ever , not a video , I lived it.  I enjoy not paying 60% tax as proposed by Biden , and I like a candidate that doesn’t bail Antifa terrorists out of jail.
I hadn't really paid much attention the Kamela Harris before the selection as VP on the Biden ticket. However, there is nothing like Trump calling her a nasty foreigner that makes me instantly like her.
This is really a coup and has to be stopped. Does anyone out there have any way to stop this? What about Biden, Harris &amp; Democratic leadership? Are they planning their own legal actions and strategies to fight this assault on our electoral system and democracy?
Biden is already to the right of Romney and Bush on several issues, so...
Of course he did. He's afraid to go to jail if he loses his Presidency (refer to the Articles of Impeachment earlier this year). Vote Biden or else we can see a dictatorship in the near future.
Court documents seem to suggest that the idea to charge Flynn with violations of the Logan Act may have come from Joe Biden. That probably will not be good news for Biden’s 2020 campaign.
I mean I had hoped you say you stopped a little.   It's gonna be weird for your pride when the Harry Potter Warren people prevent more people from getting pushed into unmarked vans than you by electing Biden.
because in most states, like MA, biden is gonna win by 30%, nearly a million votes.  is there really any reason, in that situation, not to vote for the candidate that most closely aligns with my values?  personally, medicare for all is very much needed.
Comma-La, what is it like to play nursemaid to Old Joe Biden &amp; refrain him from racist outbursts?

Biden spews Muslim quotes&amp;totally takes them out of context,why? Because someone(Dem) told him what to say to gain favor with the Muslim community,stop listening to Dems they will get us all killed/in a war.
Each state that has Cares Act surplus dollars from the bill can institute this process and short order and deficit spending will be reimbursed under the Biden Administration...Short term borrowing at very low interest rates now for 90 to 120 days.

Yes, both Biden/Harris are big supporters of late term baby killing.
Who do you think supported Bernie? They seemed like mostly Warren folks. Their frustration w Biden was largely his hiding from the media and refusing to do an interview with them despite the fact that they worked together.
Looks like the postal service is in the bag for Biden! Screw mail in ballots, go in person wear a mask, and show an identification. We can go to the liquor store, Walmart, Home Depot, and the Post Office. You certainly can go to the ballot box on November 3rd.

The "I'm going to make things calm and normal again" message is how Biden won the primary. It's probably the right tactic to maximize the number of people who vote for him in November.

Among plethora of reasons one very important reason was Biden wanted a “Black woman” has his running mate.   Kamala trying to fit the bill with her tenuous claim to being “Black woman” comes at the cost of effacing her “Indian” identity.  Only a racist like u will be ok with that

How is Biden worse? Please offer examples.
Lazy, It is not if then else, it is a beating we need to get a whip for trump. Biden has been literally President, pulled us out of Ebola, the financial crises. Accomplishments. Trump is nothing but a disaster, a skunk, a fat dirty rat, a fraud and a thief. Low IQ no education.

how is this different from joe biden going on about the “soul of the country” or whatever narrative his team came up with?
The Constitution says nothing about the number of judges on the Supreme Court. If Trump/McConnell mess with it before the next inauguration, then Biden should add two more justices.
Trump is rolling back every Obama era emission std which ↓ the regulatory burdens on businesses which ↑ jobs &amp; ultimately helps Americans.  A Biden win means each reg is restored, fracking is banned, &amp; the US is no longer be energy independent.
PENCE: The selection of California liberal Senator Kamala Harris as Joe Biden&amp;#039;s running mate simply confirms everything President Trump and I have been saying about Joe Biden and the Democratic Party.
Joe Biden could have picked   as his VP and I would still vote for him, she has no problem standing up to Trump after all. Glad he picked  though.
you’re very short sighted for a politician, jason.  i mean rookie aoc and ubi yang speak at the life or death dem convention - that’s a yay. and yes moderate rep voters needed for landslide victory.   also: go with the squad, bernie, cornel - vote biden - vote against fascism!
This is true if the Dems get undivided govt./Senate control.  Not sure if this will be the case if the GOP can bottle up Biden initiatives.
Can we agree that it's Harris/Biden not Biden/Harris
No one of those things where Trump just repeats himself. Best job ever. China travel restrictions. Biden is a commie. Harris is nasty. Blah, blah, blah.
Vote Biden. You don’t have to be excited about him. He will be better. Consider where your strong feelings led you before. Vote with your reason this time.
If Biden and Harris win god forbid it will be a celebration for 4 years with Hollywood the media and the pundits.
Biden-Harris: Here's the typeface they're using. #ForTypeGeeks #Font #Typeface #BidenHarris #GraphicDesign
Harris would make history as the nation's first female, first Black *and* first Asian American vice president if Biden wins.
Or let me spell things out a little clearer. It doesn’t even matter if Biden is senile from your deductions based on media clips (clearly scientific..). The decisions made in the Oval Office is already senile. So it’s a moot point. But I hope you find your solace in the debates.
i just don't understand how it wasn't expected that there would be a reaction to this vp announcement.  which, whatever, Biden can't control twitter, but he picked Harris in June, why not announce and get it out of the way 5 months before the election instead of 3?
Biden facing down a more progressive candidate in a primary in 2024 is objectively a superior option against fascism than risking not having an election in 2024 with Trump.
If Biden runs on Obama's economy then compare:             Obama                                   Trump Presidency  last 30 months            1st 30 months 1.5%↑ in mfg jobs                            41% ↑ in mfg jobs

People like you are convincing Biden supporters to stay home. You're not convincing Trump supporters to stay home. Your actions contribute to a Trump victory.
Lol that’s padded too.  The Bob Research Center Poll: Whatever you are, add 5 to Trump and subtract 5 from Biden.  That factors in the silent Trump voter.
My vote going to joe Biden and all the democrats cause that what I is
I knew I would encounter this kind of bullshit from the moment I posted what I wrote. I had no illusions. I was still willing to make my statement. \All I have to say is, there's a monumental difference between Mein Trumph and Biden,...and if you guys can't see that,...smh
Drug prohibition has already been used to silence activists in the US &amp; Biden is a major proponent of that especially along racist lines with the Crack vs Cocaine 20 to 1 sentencing discrepancy
Because if you didn't go to college your stupid? If you're "educated" you're a Biden voter. Maybe if you go to college your brainwashed? I hate them both, wonder what that says about my education.
Which things specifically?  Sure Biden is the better of the 2 when it come to expanding coverage but dropping the medicare age requirement a year meets that non-conditioned request which is hardly what we're looking for..  While violently returning Venezuela to the petrodollar
unfortunately feds at protests and voter suppression are actually two things where Trump and Biden are almost identical, based on record.  this doesn't mean i'm saying there's no difference between them, but those aren't good examples.
Obama and Biden cozied up to enemies? Really?  Does Trump bending over and taking a Putin putsch up the arse count as cozying? Or perhaps the love affair between Rocketman and dotering Donny is cozier?

Melania’s speech very clearly used Michelle’s as a template after some minor editing. Joe Biden used a similar metaphor to the one Reagan used, but his speech wasn’t based on Reagan’s. Can you see the difference through your partisan bias?
This is so insulting to BCPD Chief Evans, who spent years working with ICE to help them deport people.  Biden wants to destroy all his hard work.
Remember, he is doing everything he can to stand a chance. Biden isn’t Clinton, he is very well liked and all the projections l have seen have Biden winning in a landslide. Trump is doing what he can to cheat to have a chance.
If Biden wants a public that is true. Looking at Biden's history he will not expend any real capital to deliver a public option which the Obama/Biden admin could have done through reconciliation during the time of the passage of the ACA.

This entire piece was trash. Not a good idea going after BO and HRC. Almost certain Dr. Jill Biden sourced part of these inner talks and thoughts. Hopefully a one off.
Vote Biden. Doing otherwise is a vote for trump and an end to our democracy
You act like if this happened to Nancy Pelosi or Joe Biden or Rep. AOC that people with your political viewpoint would be polite and not harass them? What alternate universe do you come from?
You tried to insinuate that Biden and Harris are just as bad. That is complete bullshit &amp; you know it.
...now, in a world where according to you guys, everyone is shouting at people to not vote for him (which isn't true).  we can be honest.  Biden's whole platform is that he's not Trump.  the people on twitter you're mad at are preaching the exact same platform.
Not covering the fact that both Biden and Reagan used the word “possibilities”? Oh heavens no!
i don't agree, but either way, choosing not to _celebrate_ and pump the B/H ticket is too often being interpreted as hurting D, helping R.  and like, fuck you?  if you have to lie about your ticket to get support, all hope is lost.  we _don't_ have to.  Biden's up by 11 right...
Hold your nose and vote for Biden. We need every single vote we can get to send Trump packing.
It was more than a cliché, mate. That describes Biden calling America a land of possibilities, not the whole sentences Melania ripped off.
Melania stole entire sentences from Michelle, Mary. Biden just used the word “possibilities.”
Biden &amp; Harris 2020! Make America Happy Again!
Melania’s speech did indeed steal entire sentences from Michelle Obama, unlike this non-story about Reagan and Biden both using the word “possibilities.”
...voters being stupid.  misinformed, sure.  oppressed?  sure.  but you can't say someone saying "Biden fucking blows, Trump blows more" is misinforming anyone.  and on the initial reaction to Harris, comments are high.  relax, we all knew this was coming.
Lord forgive me but I made a Steamed Hams for Biden/Harris ticket
Biden is not my pick but I am excited about Harris.  Good brain, something to work with.  &amp; I know it is a lot easier to be heard with them than with the fat orange guy &amp; his cronies.  They are just evil &amp; an abomination &amp; so stupid
Think about where America was in 2008, where we were in 2016, and where we are now.  Then think about what Trump will likely do in 4 years, and what Biden will do. To me, the choice is clear, but you should vote based on what you think.
sorry, i've strayed, just, people will weigh their options, and people are more than welcome to convince them to vote Biden.  blaming people who point out the flaws in the D ticket as helping Trump is an admission that voters are stupid, and i never like basing things on...
Very simple: Vote for Biden.

For those of you who don't believe Biden is a fascist, despite his authoring the '91 police bill of rights, '94 tough on crime bill, and The Patriot Act, you're way too far gone to reason with.  Hope it's comfortable in that bubble when your racist authoritarian is in office.

i won't say vote for Biden either.  that doesn't mean you can't come to that conclusion all on your own because you're not a damn automaton who needs things directly spelled out for you.

She deleted it lol. Basically said she get betrayed because Liz didn’t get chosen and that Biden was using the blacks.
about encouragement.  but i mean, you really gotta want it.  a lot of people do want it, heh.  so i'll say the same things now: Biden is a terrible candidate, will be a terrible president, is not good on almost...any issue.  and the issue at hand, Harris as VP...
I did. I don't understand why the author thinks Bernie was on the path to victory before Buttigieg and Klobuchair dropped out, but I appreciate their willingness to help elect Biden, despite their reluctance.
which maybe one would take as "encouraging people note to vote for Biden," but that's not true.  it's pointing out Biden's flaws.  and the only thing he's specifically encouraged for US voting is don't vote Trump.  now, i get the argument, and Vaush even made one specifically...

well..  it was that Biden says crazy stuff - but all of the crazy stuff is on par with crazy stuff Trump says or milder
I agree. And if Biden had been in a power position in March, he would have followed that lead as well.
Biden’s VP pick makes history, but not much sense- these people are so damn delusional they actually believe their own fake polls just like the last time!and if the left thinks women are going to blindly vote for Biden bcuz of kamala they’re wrong again.😄
I heard not only will Biden remove kids from cages but he will also be recycling those cages in order to build a bridge. And YOU can buy that bridge, DM for details
Yes, Joe Biden, famous fascist who probably also try to destroy the institutions that allow us to pick our leaders. Will probably also pack the courts with religious, anti-labor, pro-life zealots and prevent progressive change even after he is gone.

Super Tuesday was after SC, when Biden had already beaten Sanders by almost 30 points.  Why would Buttigieg and Klobuchar have stayed in the race when they could no longer see a path to victory?  More people not voting for your preferred candidate does not mean foul play.
We're not.  I was saying to her go ahead and vote for Biden, do whatever you want, but don't lie about what Obama and Biden did.
whose going to win the presidential election 2020. Ask   COVID-19. Like everyone says ask the virus whom the virus vote for. Trump vs Biden. COVID-19 already picked up the winner. Last time Russia sided with Trump. Let’s see COVID-19 does the same.

Joe Biden isn’t even a little bit racist or sexist. On your side, oh boy.

Big Mark Strong Tinker Tailor vibes from this era of Joe Biden
I'm open to the idea of harm-reduction voting, but the notion that we can elect Biden/Harris &amp; THEN "hold them accountable" or "move them left" is folly. They are who they are, and they're accountable to capital, not to us.
And as they tried to meet their ends through the KKK, Democrats today are using ANTIFA and BLM to intimidate and strike fear in their fellow citizens for political power.
Did Biden plagiarize Ronald Reagan
If the intelligence community intercepts something incriminating about Biden and decides to dig further, that's fair. But Trump can't go ordering them to dig up dirt.
Hillary Clinton may have her fingers crossed for a new job if Joe Biden heads to the White House.
Al Gore and George W Bush were a lot closer to each other than Trump and Biden and yet it still ended up being one of the most important elections in history.
Trump certainly has an Election Day advantage among people who don’t believe in or fear the pandemic (as did Biden in late primaries against Sanders).
Joe Biden is the nominee. I certainly won't be voting for Trump or for the Republican in the general election Senate race in Massachusetts. I have a choice in this primary.
Well, again, the voters picked Biden over Bernie, but I understand you're upset about the outcome. You'll get 'em next time.
Record unemployment during a global pandemic isn't enough to move Biden left on key issues that are essential for recovery...but if you get him elected, he'll start listening to you.  Isn't that always the Dem strategy?  Give GOP everything, and hope they won't fuck us...again.
Hillary Clinton may have her fingers crossed for a new job if Joe Biden heads to the White House.

This is our alternative option to Trump, so at this point it’s our country’s only option. Biden has always been willing to work across the aisle and has respect from a lot of Republicans. Hopefully we won’t be as divided as we are now.
Still Biden will be better than 4 more years of Trump. Sorry but there is no viable 3rd option.

Holy shit I’m on the Biden train now!
Completely agree, in fact I believe a Biden presidency would fuel Trumpism to the point where they may even convert many centrist/undecided voters which would devestate a future progressive movement.
There's no evidence of that, &amp; based on folks I know who are friends with Biden, he's quite healthy (contrary to online myths about him). Didn't we go through this in 2016 with myths about Hillary's health? She was fine too:
Yup. I think he was almost certainly ratfucked out of the nomination again even before Biden made it explicit that they'd blame Sanders for every single person who died of COVID-19 during the primary, AND I no longer concern myself with what Sanders says.
if biden wins all its going to tell democrats is "keep doing this same thing"

2 more biden/harris tshirts and a mug on the way. #TeamBidenHarris
It's still a basic principle of individual choice &amp; consent. If people have their own agency, and consequences are known, then they're allowed to make whatever decision they are allowed to make, even if it affects other people. Shame isn't a great tactic (btw I look fwd to Biden)
And then Biden will say we should look forward not backward and not support any investigations
Awwww... White Man Joe Biden makes more than non-white woman Camel Harris... Elect Sleepy Joe and all non-white women will make millions from deals with foreign governments!!
Every time Biden says "Come on man" he loses 500k votes
Guys like John are doing way more to get progressives to support Biden/Harris than the Democrats would ever do.
Nope. And the left is aware no one would leave their homes, go out of their way to vote for Biden.
But you can’t decide between Trump and Biden👀😳
Biden expands lead over Trump to double digits: poll -
Don’t vote for Biden/Harris because they’re going to take away your ribeye! 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
They are no better than Trump supporters! They are just as radical and unhinged! We need to keep pushing them, even if Biden gets in we can not stop the movement for BIG changes! Demand it!
Justin: "She is noted to be an energetic and exciting public speaker who can engage large crowds and draw national media attention, all traits that Biden has struggled to display."
And to be fair. Biden will promise to fix NYC and then forget what NYC is!
Not even anti-vax but I’m gonna wait.  Unless Biden and Kamala make it mandatory like they want with masks outdoors.
That's so true. Kamala knows what direction we need to as a country. Thankfully Joe Biden picked her as his vp
That's easy for you to say: you aren't going to vote for Biden anyway.
IT'S OFFICIAL: Senator Kamala Harris named Biden’s running mate  Read Justin's coverage:
After hearing Kamala Harris's acceptance speech does anybody else get the feeling before coronavirus came along she thought we were all going to live forever? Guess Trump destroyed inmortality.
Man I’d pay to hear Biden or Kamala say that
Harris bringing energy, dollars and more to Biden's campaign -
Trump promotes another birther lie, this time about Kamala Harris -
Harris withheld evidence that kept a man on death row !! Integrity !! Really ! Harris incarcerated black men for simple  marijuana charges as a prosecutor while later admitting she smoked pot in college . Biden signed the 1994 crime bill that incarcerated thousands of black men!
Are you f*ing kidding me?!

We lack a consistent national policy on treating COVID-19. I suggest the 50 US governors get together and create a consistent, uniform policy on treating this pandemic. Please support VP Biden's call for a national mask mandate implemented by governors as you've already done.
In 1977 Biden said integrating black students would turn schools into jungles. He also said a 2 party system in the south was good for the Negro . Harris incarcerated black men for simple drug arrest . Do you hate Black people ?
Not voting for Biden is a vote for Trump.

I don't see Biden dismantling Environmental regulations, dismantling the post office, asking foreign states to interfere in the elections, while simultaneously degrading the office he holds.

Biden? Is gonna do what? He’s a doddering fool. Perez get your head out of it and come up with a better plan. Two solid candidates would be good. What does George say? Does he like the plan or is there a suprise coming???
NPR/PBS poll says Biden's leading Trump 53%-42%, &amp; Biden leads by 19 pts among voters who say they dislike both candidates, important coz in 2016 Trump won voters who disliked both Trump &amp; Clinton by 30 pts. But 76% of Trump fans say they strongly support him, vs 64% of Biden's.
Biden has no stamina and Kamala Harris is a sellout bureaucrat.
is failing on the job and also in his attempt to make Joe Biden look old, tired, and sleepy. Trump is the candidate who,not only appears to be getting senile and clumsy in his gate ,but also slurring a d mispronouncing simple words in most people's lexicon. Loser

Kamala Harris was a bad VP pick.  Her centrist political career drives away far-left voters.  Her far-left presidential campaign drives away moderate voters.  Biden desperatley needs both on-the-fence voting groups, but picking Kamala Harris pushes them away.
Sorry to pipe in but I will never understand this. Literally nothing could drive me from Biden. Trump is the biggest threat to our democracy. The GOP bent over backwards to enable him. You are sitting here talking about leftists but how could you not be laser focused on repugs?

This dystopia of suitless vagabonds and outdoor dining is . . . Joe Biden’s America (?)
This is what I'm saying. For YOU Biden is less bad. For somebody without health insurance, likely living paycheck-to-paycheck, they have an equal chance of dying or losing their homes. Biden (quite literally) tells such people not to vote for him. Just be aware.
Presidential candidate  has called for a nationwide mandatory #COVID mask order for the next 3 months. What does the science say? Hear from Dr. Ed Nardell, recent guest on our #policy #podcast Hubwonk:   #Biden #Election2020
Hello its me, the radical left, we lost the nomination when Bernie dropped out and he was our compromise candidate, we think biden is a racist conservative asshole and most of us aren't voting because of it.   You can relax now. "nothing will fundamentally change"
So Biden has a ‘plan?’  How novel is that?  160k dead and NOW we have a plan?  Let’s just say 5 months too late.

Let’s pretend polling is super stable from here through mid-October. Does your model slowly give Biden better odds with each passing week?
Probably still not going to vote for President, but I actually kind of like Kamala. She sucks on a bunch of stuff, but on the whole she is better than anyone (except maybe Gore) who has ever been on the Democratic ticket. Maybe Biden will wander off into the woods or something
And said on the record that he doesn't care if it violates your rights.  Should anyone who votes for Biden and his unconstitutional policies be doxxed like they've done to conservatives supporting Trump?
The whole point of a Biden/Harris presidency is that neither of them will have any power or influence. It's a return to the Smart People in generic conference rooms running the show while we all just go to brunch and smile
Ummm, no.  Like Bernie, Joe Biden came in to the nomination with a base.  Now you may not see them, because they’re darker (and older) ...
Or... they will die under either regime. For a lot of people, the two meal options are both broken glass. Biden, for you, isn't broken glass. Fine. Tread lightly around people for whom he is.
Joe Biden sucks so much His campaign slogan is “settle for Biden”. Why couldn’t u all settle for Bernie if u were ready to vote for any blue shithead on the ballot when his supporters made it very clear they had no interest in backing the Crime Bill author during a civil uprising
We're not gonna let Biden &amp; Harris cut America's meat! Hell of a platform. He really thought that was gonna hit harder than it did
Trump has never respected the rights of anyone with whom he disagreed, who challenged his goals, or whose very existence threatened his fragile ego. He is willing to tear the fabric of our society apart to stay in power. So,no, Biden doesn’t need to kowtow to conservative (1)
But once I saw this video after IA, I knew Biden was going to win the nomination:
Let’s spread the word. It’s time to take a stand.
To a shocking number of people, both candidates are broken glass. They'll die (literally) under either regime.  Now, to YOU, Biden may be a pile of crap and you vote for him because of it. Cool. But be careful not to attack people for whom both are broken glass.
#UrineTroubleTrump Biden drinks beer and rides bikes.  Trump eat pizza with a fork.
Will all the 'Stupid Voters' remember to vote for Biden/Harris?  I guess we'll have to wait and see.
This is laughable, but the Biden campaign did support a national startegy thtat included a mandate for masks in certain public settings until the pandemic was controlled. A President Biden would have relied on experts to guide strategy, not blind faith that it would just go away.
And I end with Biden’s positive abilities. Because Biden is a moron, he’s good at building relationships.
Democrats looked at Hillary's 2016 strategy and said "Yes, this is what we should do again but this time with Joe Biden"
but then, the DP  'suppressed' the vote by changing and discarding SANDERS' votes to name Biden as the nominee.
If (please baby Jesus PLEASE) Biden wins, I'm not worried about trump not leaving the white house. His ass will be taken out if necessary.   What I'm not looking forward to is weeks or months of debating the fucking results of the election ala Bush/Gore. My brain can't take it.
Dime Store Mussolini  is losing to Biden by 47 points among suburban women. His racism &amp; scare tactics aren’t working.
Not many people find that Biden blows their hair back. Yet, he’s leading by a large margin and uniting both parties in a way I’ve never seen in my lifetime. Ignoring partisan talking points, what it boils down to is that Trump has to go.
And here we go to Obama’s betrayal of Biden, but was it an actual betrayal? I don’t know on that. It was very clear Obama and Clinton were more similar and worked well together, but it’s so shitty to do what Obama did as Biden’s son died.
Biden expands lead over Trump to double digits: poll
I think Biden was stupid to say that, and he came out and apologized. Something Trump would never do. But I do have to say as a black person, I don’t know how you can be black and support Trump. Probably why 95% don’t.
Biden’s future polls should improve for three reasons: 1 the successful rollout of a VP 2democratic convention will hit some high marks with Michelle and Barack 3 the Trump convention is almost assuredly going to be a train wreck
Biden comes from an old style of negotiating politics...probably his best suit because he’s such an moron, but this Politico piece kinda rips Obama a new one on his preachy attitude and shuts down Jarrett’s implication of “old boy’s club.”  The problem was Obama’s attitude.
The implication that he doesn’t prepare or really read reports is quite hilarious to me considering the current posturing of his campaign.   Y’all are cuckoo if you don’t think Kamala Harris was chosen as the leveling effect to Biden’s intellectual inabilities.
When I call Biden a moron who fails up, his record proves that, fyi. He literally plagiarized in law school, come tf on.
If by “religious voters” the author intends “white religious voters”- Harris attends a Black Baptist Church, her husband is Jewish, she has Hindu family members. Harris has multiple ways to reach out to religious voters.
I think a Harris/Biden administration will likely double the impact.

I kind of feel like not turning the A in Harris into a star of some kind is a bit of lost potential in the current Biden-Harris branding.
This is hysterical. Biden can’t speak, won’t debate, Kamala calls him a racist and old guard and now they’re a power house team? How is voter id, suppression? Mail in is/has ans aleays wil be fraud ridden. Do you want sovialism or America the beautiful!
Well, you spelled pendejo wrong, BUT - oh my god - how can you be Hispanic and support Joe Biden/Democrats?
and once again, i think there is a very real _conversation_(not blind agree) to be explored more fully in terms of leftists in clinched states voting for Hawkins (if they like his policy), as there is virtue in a reminder that an anti-Trump mandate is not a Biden-platform mandate
And the reason I say “supposed bromance” is that I believe it’s completely obvious the transactional relationship between Obama and Biden. Biden helped bring Obama victory in 2008 with WWC voters. It’s clear Biden reveres Obama more than Obama likes Biden.   Rather sad, tbh.
Who caused the rift in the Obama/Biden bromance? Or supposed bromance? Hillary Clinton.   Say what you will about Hillary Clinton in her obvious bitchiness (admirable on some level) and noticeable hypocrisy on women’s issues due to personal scandals, she’s more intelligent.

As a survivor of sexual violence, I’ve struggled with the idea of supporting Biden. But the world is not black and white, and I need the Trump administration to end more than I need ideological purity.
i don't agree with that at face.  i'm also still not sure who you're talking about, because i think it's just people on twitter.  like Ryan Knight has 373k followers, Biden has 8.3m.  Sanders himself is actively advocating for Biden, and not even pointing out his negatives.
Poll: Voters approve Harris VP pick, Biden gets image bounce
Kamala Harris deserves an Oscar for her performance at the debates. I was totally convinced she was genuinely angry at Joe Biden for his support of segregationist policies. I didn't realize it was all a staged performance! Bravo!
is that why you want to get involved in Biden's administration ?!!!?
Again: not ideal, not perfect, not full-proof, ad hoc, imprecise definitions of "masking", varying enforcement. List goes on.  But one (damn) state at a time, Trump has lost this fight that is, only in his world, a fight.   He is the outlier, not Biden.  Report it that way.  6/
This is amazing! It will be a model for the nation.  It is awful that in Boston we failed to get any serious cuts. And Biden says he wants to give more money to cops!
But we all know why Obama picked Hillary over Biden, correct? For all her many personality faults and obvious personal scandals, she’s intelligent. Biden just isn’t.

It is very clear why Biden (or Dodd/Garcetti) chose Harris. Say what you want about her, but she is capable and focused when she’s not pushing religious bigotry or Avenatti conspiracy theories versus Biden, the typical fool.
woof, this article is pretty telling what a biden presidency would be like.
“We’re not gonna let the Biden/Harris campaign cut America’s meat!” No need to snip the tip, I suppose.

The only reason he is saying this is strictly because Biden actually has a chance to take Texas from him. That is the only reason he is saying this because his feelings are hurt. Poor widdle Donny

I like that the Ed Markey video has a very brief bit acknowledging taking out Trump means moving on to fight Biden after.
Who cares? The Democrats conceded when they picked Biden. Everything after that is performance art. The campaign is stillborn but they’re carrying it to term anyway. That at least might get some Republican voter goodwill in a later election.
HUNTER BIDEN. Need I say more?  It sure seems like your defending/justifying someone who stole 1/2 million from a charity, just because she’s a woman.
It must have been really dumb because you don't look smart.  Anyone excited about Biden is not too smart. He was in office 45 years and all he did was put blacks in prison with his marijuana laws of the 80s he authored and his crime bill in 94. White old man dumb as a stump.

can't wait for vp pelosi when biden dies on january 21 when his organs start shutting down bc he forgot how to eat &lt;3
Sen Harris do you still believe VP Biden’s accusers? Do you still have an issue with him working with segregationalists? 🤔🤔🤔🤔
Kamala Harris – Biden’s VP Choice’s Story
I’m not a conspiracy theorist by any means but...what if Biden wins, resigns for health concerns, and Harris becomes not only the first woman, but the first black woman as President. President Harris has a nice ring to it 🤷🏼‍♂️
Honestly, I'm a little relieved it's over. I don't care about Harris. I don't care about Biden. But at least we don't have to listen to that brand of horse race shit for a while
Get over it.. You have lost every voter.. Biden and Harris will take over now..You already killed your base in those 163,000 americans.. Cyrus Vance is coming for you and Michael Flynn is going back to prison..Your golf clubs are calling ya
Hm, I actually think (being in a state Biden will lay zero attention to) that the best thing I can do is strategically withhold my vote. If Biden loses MA by a little less then expected, maybe he will be more inclined to take us seriously
Biden and Harris will pulverize your father in any debate..Start panicking jr..The end days of your fathers corrupt and criminal administration are coming..including Cyrus Vance from Manhattan..you and donnie jr and Ivanka..gone!  Watch! Your criminal enterprise is collapsing
Who put a miter on Biden's head?
If Joe Biden wins they are going to say he’s too mentally unstable so she will become president and Nancy Pelosi will be the Vice President
Too ambitious is just what we want.Ambitious to save America is why Im voting Biden/Harris
Semi-hot take on #KamalaHarrisForVP: If Biden wins, expect the GOP to get a lot more libertarian on drugs, criminal justice, etc.
Watch "Joe Biden Gaffes &amp; Bloopers" on YouTube
I can say with complete confidence that Elizabeth is gonna be a good sport about this and all in for the Biden/Harris ticket. Follow her lead.
I’m listening to Stuart Stevens’ book “It Was All A Lie,” right now.  It’s healing to hear it after feeling like I’ve been watching and experiencing gaslighting for years.  But my question is, if Biden is elected, what will be the next actions of the people in the Lincoln Project
Kennedy/Johnson Johnson/Humphrey Humphrey/Muskie McGovern/Shriver Carter/Mondale Mondale/Ferraro Dukakis/Bentsen Clinton/Gore Gore/Lieberman Kerry/Edwards Obama/Biden Clinton/Kaine Biden/Harris
Kamala Harris was a former #1 contender for dem candidates I would consider drinking with. She fell out down in the polls when she dropped out.   Biden was never even in the running because I strongly dislike him - and I really like alcohol -  so that’s saying a lot.
Wrong choice. Shows lots about the pathetic state that Biden is in &amp; how the Dems are just wrong again.   The move was to the middle w/ the choice knowing cabinet would be left reaching and VP really the play caller.   Good luck winning over moderates on both sides w/ more crazy!
That's the ticket: Joe Biden picks Sen. Kamala Harris as his 2020 vice presidential running mate  via
Do I get a Biden/Harris lawn sign??
Not gonna vote for a prosecutor who covered for a corrupt drug lab. Just not gonna do it. And I’m in Massachusetts, so Biden doesn’t care anyway
I'm so happy for you and our country. In these times its not often that there is a time for joy and excitement but this is one time. God bless you and VP Biden.
Doubling down on my conspiracy theory that Harris got permission from the Biden campaign to do the one attack on Biden the entire primary.
is the Biden campaign ever going to pivot to the general?
Katie Porter for US Senate?  *provided Biden &amp; Harris win
i wonder if biden knows about  imagine that
Should we set Biden's VP-pick horse slightly ahead of the Trump/Biden horses?
In other words, the same reason McCain lost. He was a great candidate but picked a terrible running mate. (It didn’t help that he was running against Obama, who was an excellent candidate and knew how to create buzz in a way that Trump does and Biden doesn’t.)
Me waiting for Biden to announce his VP
2016 DNC was actually great. Both Obamas, Warren, Sanders, Booker, Biden. All top notch speeches. I can also remember enjoying Jennifer Granholm and Sarah Silverman "You're being ridiculous."
While everyone on Twitter dot com is speculating about Joe Biden’s VP pick, I would like to take this opportunity to recognize and remember America’s first Vice President, Quincy’s own John Adams.

Why not? Kasich is himself closer to the fence. Unless you mean sitting on the fence between Biden and a progressive, not between Biden and Trump. But that’s a losing strategy.
You know we're in troubling times when specific genitalia is one of the required attributes for which a VP mate is to be selected... Utter shame Mr Biden
Biden/Harris I hope
4 year olds can ride a bike, that doesn’t make him fit for President. Biden will destroy this country.  Just look at the Dem run cities. That will be everywhere with him in charge.
If his VP is the murder doll Chuckie, I’m still in on Biden.
And now I know why they called you meathead! The North won at Gettysburg but you keep supporting Joe Biden who was friends with an actual KKK member in Robert Byrd.
So are we to presume Biden favors President Moro of Bolivia? President Maduro of Venezuela? Honduran President Zelaya? All three were elected by their citizens.
Mr. Biden is hoping she’ll throw up one of his lawn signs.
Sources have told me that the Joe Biden’s VP pick will be...  Announced before November 3rd.
Yes and no. Biden has said he will only serve one term. I think it’s important that he picks a VP that is strong enough to run a winning campaign in 2024.
Who is Biden picking for vp
I never said Biden was on Epstein’s Island did I?? No I didn’t, I don’t go around call people a pedophile on a public forum without proof.
“EVERYBODY” should CARE! Something happens to Biden who do you think becomes president?! The VP should be chosen by “QUALIFICATIONS” NOT what “COLOR” their skin is!
Hmmm,  now I’m thinking Biden really might be able to do more push ups than me and probably take me out back and beat me up.  Stop the presses because this changes everything.
Can you imagine the rating these debates are going to get.  It’s going to be like a Super Bowl event.  Trump being the favorite and for many the first time seeing Biden’s sad condition.  The dems may try and replace him after the first debate if necessary and who could blame them
Biden literally got the idea to use the Logan Act from the show “West Wing”.  Also copies speeches from the show !!!
As a libertarian I voted for Trump in 2016 not because he was my first choice but because anyone was better than HRC. I preferred Rand Paul and would have been happy with Christie, Jeb and even Kasich but that was then. Now no way and I going with Trump or Biden. Nobody 2020
This is without release of Durham's report/indictments &amp; requires Biden to hold up in his basement. Best never to discount the power of incumbency. If Trump champions pot legalization, suddenly favors M4All and brings troops home, coupled with an October surprise? Things change.
Remember this you oblivious tree trunk.. Seniors will sharply remember you are doing your best to remove their lifeline..Social Security and Medicare.. Joe Biden won't . Seniors/disabled know what your up to now/ tax cuts/ defund SSA.  They will remove U Nov 3

Now you sound like Biden.
You realize Biden,along with Obama ,set policies that hurt America? Trump 2020
I live in corporate leftville and I haven’t seen a single Biden sign that’s how bad a candidate Biden is
I LOVE the 2008 SNL stuff!! Especially the Sarah Palin/Joe Biden debate!!
Yea but joe Biden is perfectly nothing mentally wrong with him
How adorable of you to think I support Biden either. And how very conservative of you to be so black and white as it’s the simplest way to think.
Keep an eye open for reports of secret service assuming protection of one of the women reportedly under consideration for Biden's VP.  That could be a big indicator.  It was how people started to figure out Biden was the pick in '08.
Hopefully Biden/Harris
Our lives depend on itvVote Biden Harris and blue tip to toe
Trump no where near the hilarious and bumbling Joe Biden for lies and gaffs. Biden lies 24/7 but Democrats excuse his lying. smh......

No; but will be an equal disaster when Biden wins for different reasons. Sad state of affairs we are in.
I am expecting Pete to have a substantial role in the convention. Joe had much personal praise for Pete when he endorsed Biden, and said Pete would be in his administration. Pete and Chasten have been very active for and with Joe and Jill Biden, and #TeamPete has been there too.
It's not about #Coronavirus it has everything to do with his mental capacity! He can no longer have a coherent conversation. He has so many outbursts&amp;confusion. He can not read notes put in front of him. Dems should be charged for #ElderlyAbuse #BidenUnfit
You are not worthy of any vote. Black, Brown, White or otherwise. Biden will hurt GOD? God , like everybody else does not like a liar. You are the king of prevarication.
Idk about Biden’s church regularity, but the second sentence is true.
Spell check ,you knew who I meant. The woman joe Biden molested. Who told her mom and friends when it happened.
But you still support Biden?
He will make a big mistake. The wackos will vote Biden. Biden is just a puppet. Need a strong VP. The inmates will run the assylum. Its pathetic I have to vote for Biden but the country will just go into reverse and go in another absolute horrible direction.
One of the other freaken readons your not getting elected again because you shit on americans..Oh you and Ron Johnsons and Lindsey Grahams and your beloved Putin are not denigrating Biden..More conspiracy with a foriegn advisary to rig an election... Sorry we know.Remove You!
RESIGN OR WE WILL REMOVE YOU. YOUR CHOICE. YOU AND  we will stop you asap. Your not doing nothing with the Russians to denigrate Joe Biden. This is Our democracy..Our Election. Not Russias. Clear enough for you Mr.Johnson?? Back off!
Intelligence officials provide details on Russian disinformation campaign against Biden: report -
You keep this in your head..I see your tweets with Russian code messages on the Denigration of Joe Biden..I will abruptly report your tweets to Twitter and see that your removed asap for damaging his campaign. Its against twitter policies. Your not doing this.
You think you and the Russians  and Ron Johnson are attempting to denigrate Joe Biden..Be careful..Americans know what your doing.. Not happening. This is not 2016.
Funny how the media will cover the story of a republican voting for Biden but somehow fails to cover the violence in Portland.   Makes you think the media has a narrative or something.
You are 100% in the wrong of using religion as a prop for your pathetic re-election attempts against Joe Biden. It will fire back and make you as desperate as a snake crossing over a 4 lane highway getting to the other side safely. HUGE MISTAKE.
Can they elect literally anyone? Biden is only up 3 nationwide in a couple recent polls and that was BEFORE he went on his ramblings about cocaine and elephants.
This election seems less about representing the “right” positions, more who gets to them “first” and markets better. Biden wants to open schools, but Americans (by &amp; large) associate Trump with “OPEN THE SCHOOLS”. Trump says “MASKS” but we mostly associate Dems with that message.
He took the cognitive test&amp;passed!! Biden has yet to take it. BTW  IQ is one of the highest of all POTUS' to date. #Facts Matter Biden thinks Blacks ain't Black if they vote other tan Democrat. Biden also thinks Blacks all think the same. No problem there? GTHO!!
Biden's brain is drained of any&amp;all logical thinking,no problem solving abilities left!! Dem leaders should be charged for elderly abuse!!
Have you considered doing some funny lip synching videos to Joe Biden lines to draw attention to the humour of the situation?
Georgia and Texas are a toss up not because of Biden or the "president." They are a toss up because Black and Latinx folks have been working their ass off to build progressive infrastructure for a decade.     Let's make sure no one ever forgets that.
Wrong. But you go ahead and dishonestly pretend that Biden and Trump are mentally comparable.
Kudos to Marquita Bradshaw who, using little money, scored a tremendous upset victory in Tennessee's Democratic primary. She's running to win Lamar Alexander's US senate seat. Clinton, Biden, Pelosi, Schumer Democrats shocked again!
biden has issued an apology for implying he believed Latinos were ideologically diverse
Um.... Donald Trump I can actually understand and he makes perfect sense when he speaks. I have no idea where you are coming up with this bullshit. Zero Idea... no Biden.... he is 9 donuts short of a dozen!
Hannity hammers Biden after 'weird, strange, embarrassing public breakdown': 'What's going on here?'
You’re running for Congress never miss a chance to screw somebody over so you can get elected sounds to me like you’re playing a card you shouldn’t be Joe Biden will be a better president Trump the chump
Ooh are you afraid that Biden might not win? Thought he was in the lead. Lol
Sure about that? Every single time Biden speaks he shows how incompetent he really is. Lol
I will support Joe Biden no matter who his VP is... but I will be disappointed if it’s not Kamala Harris. I think she’s the best.
Are you admitting that Biden is mentally declining? Why don't you ask real questions like, why isn't Biden going to debate  ? What are Biden's handlers afraid of? Incompetent? I think it's elderly abuse what Dems are doing to a sick man.
. I mean C'mon Joe don't ya think its time for Donald to hit the high road..Just give it Joe Biden..Rape charges now..
WOW!!!  Joe Biden is actually racist
Hey  - go fuck yourself.    Jesus doesn't approve of your dirty, cheating tactics. And your buddy Trump is in NO WAY a man of God.  Wake up.
Absolutely- not voting for Biden is a vote for Trump. And she couldn’t even explain why she would chose Harris over Rice. This is absurd.
1) why would Harris get it and Rice not? Wouldn’t you expound on that in the article  2) a vote for anyone but Biden IS a vote FOR trump - did you not learn anything from 2016? 3) neither rice nor Harris are an imbecile Palin. Both would be fine choices
This is going to make Dems look bad,everyone can see Biden is mentally declining&amp;for Dems to hang on a mentally ill man for their pick for Dem candidate for POTUS is why  will win. Dems should be charged with elder abuse of Biden! #WalkAway
Biden Suggests Diversity Of Thought Doesn't Exist In The African American Community - Sara A. Carter : Sara A. Carter
First of Joe Biden is Catholic and your an idiot for saying he doesn't believe or trust in god..Your the jerk who held up a bible in front of a burnt church for a stupid photo op before having innocent protesters pepper sprayed..Third a 6 year girl died
You make the outlandish claim that Joe Biden doesn't believe in GOD..well..Joe didn't kill 159,000 americans. YOU DID. Joe Biden has prayed to God for the families of the dead/sick You didn't. Only evil and heartless souls like you kill 159,800 americans. Sad.
I would hesitate to call Biden devout given he is pro-choice. By some canonists figuring he might be excommunicated automatically because of his support of abortion.
Which community should be more insulted by Joe Biden’s remarks

my goal is universal healthcare, avoiding climate catastrophe, and boosting an alternative to our two-party oligarchy.   i can understand voting for biden in a swing state, but beyond that, why should anyone support him as a candidate when howie is also in the race?
my one vote - can push the green party to 5%, where they can get millions in federal funding and become a major party cannot affect the outcome of biden winning my state by *literally* nearly a million votes  in safe states, voting blue/red is more of a waste than green, cmv
but does me backing that “real opponent” do anything? how does me voting for biden actually accomplish anything, other than throwing away a vote that could’ve gone towards a party and candidate that support medicare for all and saving the planet and people on it?
Based on my read of the internet today, Trump is going to win re-election despite the fact that  1. Biden is ahead in every national poll, and in every swing state. Very clearly leading by a lot.  2. Trump is sabotaging the USPS and we all know about it 4 months in advance
I don’t think Biden is going to ban cheeseburgers or whatever, but I have done quite a bit of research on how much of the water in the American Southwest is diverted to cattle and cattle feed and oh boy is that gonna be a fuckin doozy for LA, Phoenix and Las Vegas soon enough.
I hadn't really paid much attention the Kamela Harris before the selection as VP on the Biden ticket. However, there is nothing like Trump calling her a nasty foreigner that makes me instantly like her.
because in most states, like MA, biden is gonna win by 30%, nearly a million votes.  is there really any reason, in that situation, not to vote for the candidate that most closely aligns with my values?  personally, medicare for all is very much needed.
give me one good reason to vote for biden in a deep blue (or red) state
Thanks Brooke!  Please stay strong Sen. Harris of OAKLAND, CA!  We need you and Joe Biden now more than ever!
I will commit to phone banking for biden if he bans pod save america from all streaming platforms
If "common sense" means abandoning attempts to finish sentences and "compassion" means playing a major role in almost every bad policy decision made by the US since the 70's, then, yeah, i guess vote biden??
Vice President Biden was being a true leader unlike someone who thinks the virus will magically go away.
somehow your twitter bio rings hollow. “I’m not GOP or Dem” followed by Harris/Biden 2020. Yeah, you’re right down the middle...Lol
Or let me spell things out a little clearer. It doesn’t even matter if Biden is senile from your deductions based on media clips (clearly scientific..). The decisions made in the Oval Office is already senile. So it’s a moot point. But I hope you find your solace in the debates.
This year’s election could lead to a significant change in the capital-gains tax rate—no matter who wins   via
Melania’s speech very clearly used Michelle’s as a template after some minor editing. Joe Biden used a similar metaphor to the one Reagan used, but his speech wasn’t based on Reagan’s. Can you see the difference through your partisan bias?
Vote Biden/Harris. They may not be your ideal ticket, but Trump is a disaster who will so much worse in 4 more years and no re-election to worry about
Not covering the fact that both Biden and Reagan used the word “possibilities”? Oh heavens no!
It was more than a cliché, mate. That describes Biden calling America a land of possibilities, not the whole sentences Melania ripped off.
Melania stole entire sentences from Michelle, Mary. Biden just used the word “possibilities.”
Melania’s speech did indeed steal entire sentences from Michelle Obama, unlike this non-story about Reagan and Biden both using the word “possibilities.”
Lord forgive me but I made a Steamed Hams for Biden/Harris ticket
Biden and Harris will know how to handle a pandemic, saving countless lives. Over 165K dead because of Donald Trump's mishandling of the pandemic.  Now he wants to rig the election again by defunding the USPS
WSJ Opinion: A Biden Presidency Won't Help Black School Children
I heard not only will Biden remove kids from cages but he will also be recycling those cages in order to build a bridge. And YOU can buy that bridge, DM for details
Per the CNN exit poll, 56% of 2020 SC Primary voters were African-American.  Further, per the exit poll, Biden won 61% of black voters in the Palmetto State.
And to be fair. Biden will promise to fix NYC and then forget what NYC is!
I wish Biden were that cool
This is what I'm saying. For YOU Biden is less bad. For somebody without health insurance, likely living paycheck-to-paycheck, they have an equal chance of dying or losing their homes. Biden (quite literally) tells such people not to vote for him. Just be aware.
Probably still not going to vote for President, but I actually kind of like Kamala. She sucks on a bunch of stuff, but on the whole she is better than anyone (except maybe Gore) who has ever been on the Democratic ticket. Maybe Biden will wander off into the woods or something
Ummm, no.  Like Bernie, Joe Biden came in to the nomination with a base.  Now you may not see them, because they’re darker (and older) ...
Or... they will die under either regime. For a lot of people, the two meal options are both broken glass. Biden, for you, isn't broken glass. Fine. Tread lightly around people for whom he is.
But once I saw this video after IA, I knew Biden was going to win the nomination:
Let’s spread the word. It’s time to take a stand.
To a shocking number of people, both candidates are broken glass. They'll die (literally) under either regime.  Now, to YOU, Biden may be a pile of crap and you vote for him because of it. Cool. But be careful not to attack people for whom both are broken glass.
It there is a Trump press conference today, will you turn off your TV and social media accounts? We will.
I kind of feel like not turning the A in Harris into a star of some kind is a bit of lost potential in the current Biden-Harris branding.
Congratulations America, we’ve made safely sending kids back to school a partisan issue. 75% of Rs think students returning to school is a good idea, 83% of Ds say it is a bad idea.

Leadership is not plagiarizing speeches...  Reagan Speechwriter: Biden Just Plagiarized From Reagan

This is leadership 😂 Biden: "I got hairy legs that turn blonde in the sun. The kids used to come up and reach in the pool &amp; rub my leg down so it was straight &amp; watch the hair come back up again. So I learned about roaches, I learned about kids jumping on my lap..."
Hysterically funny that Trump lies about following the science. He is so obviously ignorant of science ie drink Lysol to kill the virus. Most children cleaning fluids are poisonous!  Biden &amp; Harris are intelligent solid people who can follow science &amp; have common sense!
The world laughs right now at Trump as the bully clown failing to lead the USA.  Biden will rebuild the respect America always had before the Trump Administration!
I mean... Biden's no Socialist yet he likes to get publicly owned with his asinine statements so...
Sounds like music 🎶, isn’t Biden? Biden ? Biden ... ah you can’t hear me you’re in the basement 😜
You assume I would vote for Biden if Hawkins weren't on the ballot. You're wrong. Go recruit non-voters if you think your case is so strong. I'm always voting to the left because that's the best way to pressure the system and strengthen our movement.
As someone else recently put it, any progressive action will be organized around, over, under, or careening through a Biden Administration, but it will not be coming from, by, or with a Biden Administration. At best, they will do *slightly* less to actively impede &amp; detain us.
The important thing to understand about a potential Biden Administration is that progressives or leftists of any kind and tendency will not be running it, will not be co-running it, will not be a junior partner in it, will for all intents &amp; purposes not be part of it.
Biden/Harris raised almost as much money in 48 hours as Biden did in all of 2019, $59 million.
Dear  You can turn the mail sorters back on. Your country is counting on you. Our future depends on it.
Bernie, Warren, Biden, maybe Amy.  If you think those stories weren’t coming from the competition, you’re extremely naive.
Insightful background about the process/priorities in Biden's VP decision. Comforting that they agreed to Biden's staff leading any decisions around building the combined Biden/Harris team after some of the personnel challenges in Harris' primary campaign.
This is exactly the type of shit I’m talking about. And ironically, Kamala harrris DID separate children from their families as AG, Biden DID separate children and families at the border and biden DID send in federal enforcement to deal with protesters, using the same tear...
Unfortunately over 165K dead people because of your poor pandemic response won't be around for a Biden Presidency.

I always love these predictions. There is no way to refute them. You can’t be wrong. 10,000 people die, would have been 50,000. 60,000 die, would have been 100,000. As Biden says, it’s horse puckey.
It sounds like a conspiracy to violate citizens' civil rights. Stiff jail term if convicted. Biden/Harris and a bunch of people should say this publicly and often. Might intimidate some people out of helping.
Biden will make our country proud and a huge success again. You are the laughing stock around the world and have made our country a failure or you’re a failure more accurately.

Harris may have perfected the craft of "advise and consent" with Justice Kavanaugh, but there is only one founder of "This Is Personal" style Senate hearings, the creator of Borking, Mr. Joe Biden.
Reality is every DNC has an ex-R as a speaker, and every RNC has an ex-D as a speaker.  So it is expected to have an ex-R as a prime time DNC speaker.  John Kasich has endorsed Joe Biden.  That's why Kasich makes sense as this year's R speaking at the DNC.
DNC rules are that you have to endorse the presumptive nominee to get a speaking slot.  See 1992:  Brown, Edmund G. and Casey, Robert P.  Beto has clearly endorsed Joe Biden.  Has AOC?
Why?  Has AOC endorsed Joe Biden yet?  The DNC rules require you to endorse the presumptive nominee to get a speaking slot.  See 1992:  Brown, Edmund G. and Casey, Robert P.

We’ve got the ticket. Now we need the votes. Everyone, it’s time to persuade voters and conquer the logistics so all voters can safely deliver #BidenHarris to victory. Together, we win
Biden could be in cognitive decline for 100 years and be more able than Trump

If people are lining up in Europe to get a vaccine, and in Canada, and Biden and Harris and their families all get the vaccine, and Melania and Barron and Bill Gates and Dr. Fauci all get it, and you STILL refuse it because Trump is in charge, nothing I can say will help.
Joe Biden sounded more coherent today than Trump has...ever
So much for the muddled Biden theory.

If Biden-Harris were in office we would be helping.
Paying attention to Biden’s introduction? I’m sure you’ll give it a thorough leaving alone.
Blown away: Biden and Harris’ speeches fantastic! I’m really impressed with Harris; so heartfelt.
And THAT's why I'm working my tail off for Biden-Harris. #BidenCoalition #BidenHarris2020
I'm trying to communicate with you. Science is the only thing that will show whether a vaccine works, but the idea of listening to trustworthy people like Joe Biden or Angela Merkel is not "pointing to more science".
I am so proud of ⁦ Harris, Biden's V.P. Pick. For all our black, minority, immigrants sisters out there, there is nothing you can not achieve. If you can dream it, you can make it happen. ❤️❤️#KamalaHarrisVP #diversity
If Joe Biden recommends a vaccine in December, will you still refuse it?
Suburban housecats for Biden!
Refusing a scientifically proven vaccine just because a moron happens to be in charge of the government is self-destructive. If Joe Biden recommends a vaccine in December will you still refuse to get it?
That's because elections tend to tighten before election day. If the election were held tomorrow with Biden up 8 points his chances would be in the 90s.
Interesting how people will criticize Kamala Harris to the ends of the earth but not at all to the extent of Joe Fricking Biden- the actual nominee who’s much more problematic than her...
and all this "we have to get behind Biden" is just a loyalty oath in different form
The "worst" political analysis I've heard is Trump talking about how effective he has been as president. Anyway, you have a point. The party overall has shifted left but the last two nominees have been quite conservative. Hillary over Bernie and Biden over Bernie, Liz etc
This result makes sense. Trump's voters are largely cultists who believe he "alone can fix it."  I'm voting for Biden, but I would have chosen "somewhat," because I'm sufficiently informed to know it will be difficult to thwart the pandemic now that it has spread so widely.
Place Of Born does not decide suitability;its one's ideology &amp; virtues too matter;Do BJP accept Socialism &amp; Her Prez candidate Biden Questioning about CAA?        Ji parnam

She literally said a couple days later she was not M4A, neither is Biden. No ones saying it cause it’s not true🤷🏻‍♀️

How is anyone actually voting for Biden/Harris?  C’mon.
Imagine how Trump would respond to a woman who publicly challenged and criticized him. Especially a strong, non-white woman.   Harris may be a pragmatic or political choice for Biden. But they’re already showing themselves to care less about their egos and more about the office.
Kamala Harris Is Biden’s Choice for Vice President  ALL RIGHT 👍
Biden should be getting intelligence briefings. Maybe he has to officially be named the nominee first.
Paul Tsongas won the primary in 1992, and Hillary Clinton won in 2008.  In both years the eventual Dem nominee carried the state in the general.   So, will Biden carry New Hampshire? He's up nine points based on 538's average and his margin is increasing.
I’m your target audience. I’m voting Biden and a straight dem ticket and will never vote GOP again.
Counterpoint: The Biden/Harris administration will be the most progressive in American history BECAUSE the  and  candidates we elect will make it the most progressive administration in history. Also, support progressives like
Fwiw, I volunteered in Biden's Quincy, MA office right before Super Tuesday.
After MS, AL was likely to be Biden's 2nd or 3rd best state overall (and one of Bernie's/Warren's/Pete's/Amy's 3-4 worst states).
Damn -- and Biden won by a bigger margin in VA than he did in SC.  53% in a 4-candidate race in VA is impressive when HRC and Obama won Old Dominion with 63-65% in a 2-candidate race.  Granted, after AL, VA was always going to be Biden's 2nd best Super Tuesday state.

Daily Poll: Do you approve Of Joe Biden's choice of Kamala Harris as running mate?
Pence has to defend a racist, sexist president. Harris gets to talk about how that racism and sexism feel to a Black woman like her. This isn’t any ordinary clash of perspectives and philosophies. It’s an extraordinary collision of life experiences.
Biden is a very, very luck guy having you on board.
You should vote for Biden because he does admit fault, doesn’t speak in hyperboles, doesn’t keep changing the subject, listens to what others have to say, and doesn’t use ad-hominem attacks.  Also, because Obama wants him to win. #BidenHarris2020

On this evening when everyone is scrutinizing Kamala Harris I thought it appropriate to rewatch the brilliant film Game Change about the Palin nomination. I don't think McCain would have won in 2008 no matter who he picked for VP, but at least Biden chose America over politics.
Running against a nasty, thin-skinned, misogynistic narcissist like  Biden chose a capable woman senator who dinged him hard in the debates. That's pretty chill. Biden is modeling a better politics for people tired of Trump's bullshit.

Anyone else wondering about what Diamond &amp; Silk think about the Biden/Harris ticket? They’re gonna lose their status!!😂🤣
I think the main thing on Trump's mind is how jealous he is of the attention over Biden's v.p. pick process, and he's wondering if he could make Pence reapply for the job just to make a show of it.
they probably wont and use it as leverage to get biden to debate trump.

Biden's choice was really a cowardly choice. I have no doubt he was pressured into this decision.
Biden/Harris!?!?! Trump/Pence just got a lot paler…
That "enjoy" thing always creeps me out. Almost 4 years in office and he still has no idea how to conduct himself as a president.  Biden and Harris will make mistakes, they're human but I think we can be assured the clown show will be over.6-8 weeks puts us in October.... come November is the election... I am not huge conspiracy theorist but why do you say November... post election as in Biden wins and this goes away???
No one believes Biden is a racist, but everyone knows that Trump is one, bigly.
you’re assuming as if you know the intention of others. it’s his daughter, he clearly would never talk about his daughter like that. why are people so wicked and perverse with their thoughts? you would rather focus on that than biden actuslly touching little kids.

Biden names VP and just like that people realize he wont be defunding the police either and is just as anti minority as the cheeto... Jorgensen 2020 for real change
Too many people still support him. They need to see the juxtaposition and quash the narrative that Biden is not there cognitively. As insane as it is, I personally know people with reservations about Trump who buy it (I know, I know).
You would have used this exact same line against any VP choice. Biden/Harris will being stability, intgrity, and intelligence, the exact opposite of the current chaos. Let's right the ship.
lol...so, I wrote this "quick" thread about folks who get, rightly, annoyed whenever they get accused of "loving Trump" whenever they criticize Biden or Harris or Democrats. But, after 7 tweets, I was like "what the hell...this is too much."
The difference between Trump/Pence and Biden/Harris couldn’t be more pronounced. One side is all about lies and corruption, the other is about ethics, intelligence, experts, the truth  and a soul.
Perhaps read some Howard Zinn. People movements are a key driver to getting the policy we want. It works better with good politicians and Harris/Biden are good. So this is how it works. Don’t like it, donate to your own cause. I’m not stopping and Twitter downtown so much either
Biden and Harris have a heart and a soul. Trump and Pence have ice water running through their veins, and no semblance of a soul.
I am so proud of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. We are lucky to have these two, who will bring back decency, honor, ethics,respectability, knowledge, intelligence, truthfulness, equality &amp; class back to the White House. In the age of Trump, these two are like a breath of fresh air.
Gee, someone is very afraid of the Biden/Harris ticket and you know what- he should be!
This is what a president says and does. Thank you Joe Biden. We need you more than ever!
Ok... but can someone else accept the nomination??  I won't vote for Biden if you don't run again...
Trump says the stock market will tank if Biden is elected. Of course - Trump has been buying up stock like crazy to artificially inflate the market. It’s all a sham, just like the Trump presidency and how dangerous mail-in-voting is. Evil incarnate.

He did do a war on drugs thing...which was heavily pushed by your guy, Joe Biden.  Seriously.  You should look some of these things up.  Google can be your friend.
Fortunately Biden then advanced beyond 3rd grade, whereas trump's thought process and reading level never matured beyond primary grades.

The one who wrote the '94 tough on crime bill?  Yes, he's responsible for the current prison industrial complex.  Look at incarceration rates before and after Biden's signature bill.  Democrats have been 'tough on crime' since the '90s.  Where have you been?
I would recommend your looking at  feed for plenty of articles about allegations against Joe Biden.  Regarding corruption, he's got 50 years of representing corporations in Congress.  There are plenty of articles like this one.
Obama and Biden looted SS years ago. Joe doesn’t remember that tho!
And that "strong woman" said her questioning him was political theater.  That's not strength.  Your VP is an authoritarian who has exploited the prison industrial complex that Biden helped establish.  She's trash.
He's probably one of the people who is flying with the Trump line that "if Biden gets elected, the stock market will crash". He's wrong tho, because even if trump doesn't manage to fix it, he won't leave. He's checking who in the military is loyal to him rn.

Biden’s numbers are better than those in those states. Wow the pressure is really getting to you to hedge and just never be able to be proved wrong ever.
I don’t think Biden is going to ban cheeseburgers or whatever, but I have done quite a bit of research on how much of the water in the American Southwest is diverted to cattle and cattle feed and oh boy is that gonna be a fuckin doozy for LA, Phoenix and Las Vegas soon enough.
Great propaganda , as a union member we were at 100% employment and busier than ever , not a video , I lived it.  I enjoy not paying 60% tax as proposed by Biden , and I like a candidate that doesn’t bail Antifa terrorists out of jail.
This is really a coup and has to be stopped. Does anyone out there have any way to stop this? What about Biden, Harris &amp; Democratic leadership? Are they planning their own legal actions and strategies to fight this assault on our electoral system and democracy?
Biden is already to the right of Romney and Bush on several issues, so...
Court documents seem to suggest that the idea to charge Flynn with violations of the Logan Act may have come from Joe Biden. That probably will not be good news for Biden’s 2020 campaign.

The one who wrote the '94 tough on crime bill?  Yes, he's responsible for the current prison industrial complex.  Look at incarceration rates before and after Biden's signature bill.  Democrats have been 'tough on crime' since the '90s.  Where have you been?
I would recommend your looking at  feed for plenty of articles about allegations against Joe Biden.  Regarding corruption, he's got 50 years of representing corporations in Congress.  There are plenty of articles like this one.
Obama and Biden looted SS years ago. Joe doesn’t remember that tho!
And that "strong woman" said her questioning him was political theater.  That's not strength.  Your VP is an authoritarian who has exploited the prison industrial complex that Biden helped establish.  She's trash.
He's probably one of the people who is flying with the Trump line that "if Biden gets elected, the stock market will crash". He's wrong tho, because even if trump doesn't manage to fix it, he won't leave. He's checking who in the military is loyal to him rn.

Great propaganda , as a union member we were at 100% employment and busier than ever , not a video , I lived it.  I enjoy not paying 60% tax as proposed by Biden , and I like a candidate that doesn’t bail Antifa terrorists out of jail.
This is really a coup and has to be stopped. Does anyone out there have any way to stop this? What about Biden, Harris &amp; Democratic leadership? Are they planning their own legal actions and strategies to fight this assault on our electoral system and democracy?
Biden is already to the right of Romney and Bush on several issues, so...i will be one of the most happy people along with many others if joe biden wins :,) like i will forreal shed tears
If Biden wins, she will be President soon. Biden obviously has dementia, and not early stage.

Would you vote for Trump or Biden? Reason 3rs

Where is the immigration rhetoric?! Where are Hillary’s Benghazi?!? You played Biden’s  Burisma ties prematurely and idiotically and ended up impeached for your trouble! The pandemic wiped away your economy achievements, and it even brought your Obama vendetta back to haunt you!

Same old thoughtless regurgitation of old talking points. Speak of "privilege" to an Anti-war voter? Smh  A Biden Foreign Policy ala Iraq, Libya, Syria, Honduras (already has eyes on forcibly returning Venezuela to the Petrodollar) will hurt far more people than both Trump terms.

And, again... I'm in MA. I have *massive privilege* in this situation; if I was in Michigan or something I would have to take a very different tack.  But if I want to see a world where some of the things I care about, like M4A, actually *happen*... I dunno if a Biden vote does it
Except I sorta feel like accepting that formulation is a good way to ensure that you'll *never* get something to vote FOR  Like, Biden is less bad than Trump, 100%. An ounce of crap is better than a pound of crap, too, but that doesn't mean I'm gonna line up to eat the ounce
I can understand that position, and I respect it wholeheartedly. And honestly, if I wasn't living in MA - a state that if Biden loses, he's got bigger problems than just me - I might feel the same.  My issue is... holding my nose is what I've had to do for multiple elections now.
Dear everyone trying to vote-shame me because my lack of enthusiasm for Biden somehow equates to supporting Trump in your minds:  Please stop. It's not going to work.
538 did an analysis last month arguing exactly this.

EDITORIAL: Biden’s VP pick puts U.S. on cusp of history
You’re deluded. Biden is inherently smarter than Trump.  Worlds more educated on the key issues. Sane. Has much sharper mental faculties. Do you even watch Trump’s incoherent and paranoid ramblings? #returntonormal2020
Joe Biden and Kamala Harris pushed past their one-time political rivalry to deliver an aggressive attack on the character and performance of President Donald Trump in their historic first appearance as running mates.
Is your arthritis acting up. .or are you just complaint because .stop riding Biden ..your acting like an XWife.  Biden and Harris is the future of USA. For all not just the .0.1%
is P.Harris and Biden fans of FOX and friends .?
is joe Biden Kennedy going to win over Ed Market for MA.?
If you go to  it goes to Joe
The people voting for Biden, are the same people who bought lonza ball's $495 shoe that explodes 😂
And run against  ?  yeah great idea. Just shine a spotlight on the racist comments he has made against minorities living in low income housing. Brilliant strategy. Trump is toast. Admit it .
Not a fan of Biden policy at all. One’s Catholic faith is a personal walk with Jesus Christ. We are all sinners. The goal is to learn &amp; grow. I believe that there is no pro choice. It is pro murder. Christians who support this stance have to address in their time with Jesus.
How Biden chose Harris: Inside his search for a running mate
In naming Kamala Harris as his running mate, Joe Biden made a groundbreaking decision, picking a woman of color to be vice president and, possibly, a successor in the White House someday.
Joe Biden named California Sen. Kamala Harris as his running mate, making history by selecting the first Black woman to compete on a major party’s presidential ticket and acknowledging the vital role Black voters will play...
Why does your Daddy care if Pamalla Harris was mean to Biden .Your Daddy hates Biden .
Biden, Harris.  Smell my Willy 2020
Are you happy with Joe Biden’s choice of running mate, Sen. Kamala Harris?
Pass. I’ll be making my BIDEN/HARRIS 2020 signs!!
Guess she passed the Biden smell test! Smelled a little like willie......🤔🤔🤔
If trump wins in November, then it will be proven that enough people lie to pollsters to ruin their usefulness forever. If Biden wins, we can chalk up 2016 as an anomaly.
He is also gathering ammunition, graciously supplied by Trump. He will unload it all when the leaves begin to turn .... Trump, meanwhile , is firing all his bullets now. By October he will have nothing new to say about Biden.
Let’s be clear  —  is a Rhodes scholar compared to dim witted Donald trump. He is also smarter and has sharper mental faculties than both you and trump. He will shred dumb Donald on the debate stage and would take you apart as a bonus .
Biden has reason to get into a back and forth “he said , he said” with trump every day. And daily “gotcha” grillings from the media don’t educate the voters about policy and principles. Frankly it’s refreshing not to have a campaign of sound bites.
I guarantee that after the first debate , whenever it is , trump will find an excuSe to try and cancel the others. Biden will mop the floor with him. Clinton tried to trade quips. Biden will undress him and show trump for the ignorant buffoon he is.
More data the media will never show you. Way more accurate than the fake national polls - remember 2016  Who raised more money from small donors? #trump vs #biden  Full analysis

Since Trump is President.. Admission 2 Hell increased by 80%..ALL of these sycophants over last 4 yrs have 2 answer 2 God..WHY WERE 80% OF YOUR WORDS LIES LAST 4 YRS..Oh yeah...BUT..Biden hates God..the Bible almost burst into flames when Trump held it up
And then, of course, there is the inhospitable way trump treats immigrants both legal and illegal and the poor. Just politics you might say? I would answer that Biden’s stance on abortion is also just politics .
Moreover, Biden neither renounced nor denounced his faith with his political position. One could well argue that Trump’s lack of love, compassion, mercy, humility and grace most assuredly is against the teachings of Jesus and the will of God.
Ide trust eating an egg and cheese croissant that’s fallen on to the floor of a Dunkin Donuts bathroom more than Ide trust Joe Biden.
Oh  you poor deluded sap.  has given ZERO indication of not debating the babbling moron  who cant pronounce Thailand or Yosemite. He will mop the floor with the orange marshmallow.
Have you ever actually listened to Trump? He is LITERALLY Unable to put together coherent thoughts on the fly. Short of crass insults. Compared to Trump, Biden is a statesman and a Rhodes scholar .WOW. This #Biden ad 👇  #Election2020 #BidenHarris
people really be out here unironically using settle for biden posts to sway people to vote for him   I —

Biden/Harris are definitely not perfect but they are a billion fold better than Trump, his nepotism, and overall fascist behaviour that undermines the rights of our citizens. I can at least feel safe in knowing that Biden won't try to inhibit citizen votes in elections.
#LoserInChief  #BidenHarris2020 is coming for you! All your distractions &amp; lies won’t help! Can’t wait to see Biden kick your ass in the debate! 👏
my mom said I could go to my friend’s baby shower! so now I’ve gotta think of advice to write down but since I’m not a mom all I can think of is “don’t have kids” or “vote for biden so maybe the pandemic ends here someday and your kid can go to daycare/school”
Honestly, the Biden Ryan 2012 debate might have made the difference.
amplify this message now! Let them do their job!
i’ve gone over the fact that i’m in one of the many safe states, which means my vote for biden would not have any effect on trump’s re-election, just as my vote for hillary had no effect from MA.
Is there any suggestion of illegal behavior on their part (as opposed to their followers), or are they protected under the first amendment? Because I expect the Biden admin DOJ to be super careful about who they go after.
wildcard nice thing about potential Biden presidency: without the FBI having been entirely compromised, maybe the person or group known as "Q" will get unmasked and either apprehended, or have their accounts compromised / taken away.

my goal is universal healthcare, avoiding climate catastrophe, and boosting an alternative to our two-party oligarchy.   i can understand voting for biden in a swing state, but beyond that, why should anyone support him as a candidate when howie is also in the race?
my one vote - can push the green party to 5%, where they can get millions in federal funding and become a major party cannot affect the outcome of biden winning my state by *literally* nearly a million votes  in safe states, voting blue/red is more of a waste than green, cmv
but does me backing that “real opponent” do anything? how does me voting for biden actually accomplish anything, other than throwing away a vote that could’ve gone towards a party and candidate that support medicare for all and saving the planet and people on it?
Based on my read of the internet today, Trump is going to win re-election despite the fact that  1. Biden is ahead in every national poll, and in every swing state. Very clearly leading by a lot.  2. Trump is sabotaging the USPS and we all know about it 4 months in advance
I don’t think Biden is going to ban cheeseburgers or whatever, but I have done quite a bit of research on how much of the water in the American Southwest is diverted to cattle and cattle feed and oh boy is that gonna be a fuckin doozy for LA, Phoenix and Las Vegas soon enough.
I hadn't really paid much attention the Kamela Harris before the selection as VP on the Biden ticket. However, there is nothing like Trump calling her a nasty foreigner that makes me instantly like her.
This is really a coup and has to be stopped. Does anyone out there have any way to stop this? What about Biden, Harris &amp; Democratic leadership? Are they planning their own legal actions and strategies to fight this assault on our electoral system and democracy?
because in most states, like MA, biden is gonna win by 30%, nearly a million votes.  is there really any reason, in that situation, not to vote for the candidate that most closely aligns with my values?  personally, medicare for all is very much needed.
give me one good reason to vote for biden in a deep blue (or red) state
Oh you silly rabbits, only Republicans have mandates according to the national press corps almost all of which are employees of large corporations with large corporate interests. Biden could win by an historic landslide &amp; still be considered on shaky ground.
Your reminder that Joe Biden will be the only Presidential candidate this year to have corresponded with Hannah Arendt:
We'd have seen even more of this in the primary if COVID-19 hadn't gifted the nomination to Biden.
Thanks Brooke!  Please stay strong Sen. Harris of OAKLAND, CA!  We need you and Joe Biden now more than ever!
But it fundamentally in conflict with laying the groundwork for calling for mass demonstrations when Trump tries to steal the election. Trump is already prepping his supporters  for conflict - I don't know how Biden pivots to calling for mass demonstrations.
The "I'm going to make things calm and normal again" message is how Biden won the primary. It's probably the right tactic to maximize the number of people who vote for him in November.
I don't listen every week,  I've missed  a lot of episodes, but I agree w/ you. Unless I'm mistaken, most or all the hosts worked w/ Biden at the WH since they were part of Obama's '08 campaign &amp; worked at WH. They like Biden. Obnoxious for member of JB's staff to give that quote
I will commit to phone banking for biden if he bans pod save america from all streaming platforms
But the other option is Trump/Pence. By saying idk, are you saying that you’d rather consider them instead? For me, I’m saying let’s get Biden Harris in office and hold them accountable. We have a far better chance there than with Trump.
If "common sense" means abandoning attempts to finish sentences and "compassion" means playing a major role in almost every bad policy decision made by the US since the 70's, then, yeah, i guess vote biden??
With this coming election, it’s a game of lesser of two evils but it should really be who’s going to listen to their constituents regardless of their own beliefs. My hope is that with Biden/Harris, they show growth against their past actions and do what’s right for the people.
Vice President Biden was being a true leader unlike someone who thinks the virus will magically go away.
give any progressive/leftist this option right now, they'll vote Biden.  give any DNC person this option right now, they'll reject it.  it's not us that your problem is with.
Because  is a racist. #TrumpIsARacist #BidenHarris2020 #birtherism #BirtherismIsRacism #Birtherism2point0
2024?  i guarantee you Biden will be elected this November if we don't hear a fucking word about splitting a party or promoting republicans in 2024.  i guarantee it.  deal?
The Constitution says nothing about the number of judges on the Supreme Court. If Trump/McConnell mess with it before the next inauguration, then Biden should add two more justices.
No one of those things where Trump just repeats himself. Best job ever. China travel restrictions. Biden is a commie. Harris is nasty. Blah, blah, blah.
Vote Biden. You don’t have to be excited about him. He will be better. Consider where your strong feelings led you before. Vote with your reason this time.
Or let me spell things out a little clearer. It doesn’t even matter if Biden is senile from your deductions based on media clips (clearly scientific..). The decisions made in the Oval Office is already senile. So it’s a moot point. But I hope you find your solace in the debates.
i just don't understand how it wasn't expected that there would be a reaction to this vp announcement.  which, whatever, Biden can't control twitter, but he picked Harris in June, why not announce and get it out of the way 5 months before the election instead of 3?
unfortunately feds at protests and voter suppression are actually two things where Trump and Biden are almost identical, based on record.  this doesn't mean i'm saying there's no difference between them, but those aren't good examples.
This year’s election could lead to a significant change in the capital-gains tax rate—no matter who wins   via
Melania’s speech very clearly used Michelle’s as a template after some minor editing. Joe Biden used a similar metaphor to the one Reagan used, but his speech wasn’t based on Reagan’s. Can you see the difference through your partisan bias?
Vote Biden/Harris. They may not be your ideal ticket, but Trump is a disaster who will so much worse in 4 more years and no re-election to worry about
...now, in a world where according to you guys, everyone is shouting at people to not vote for him (which isn't true).  we can be honest.  Biden's whole platform is that he's not Trump.  the people on twitter you're mad at are preaching the exact same platform.
Not covering the fact that both Biden and Reagan used the word “possibilities”? Oh heavens no!
i don't agree, but either way, choosing not to _celebrate_ and pump the B/H ticket is too often being interpreted as hurting D, helping R.  and like, fuck you?  if you have to lie about your ticket to get support, all hope is lost.  we _don't_ have to.  Biden's up by 11 right...
It was more than a cliché, mate. That describes Biden calling America a land of possibilities, not the whole sentences Melania ripped off.
Melania stole entire sentences from Michelle, Mary. Biden just used the word “possibilities.”
Melania’s speech did indeed steal entire sentences from Michelle Obama, unlike this non-story about Reagan and Biden both using the word “possibilities.”
...voters being stupid.  misinformed, sure.  oppressed?  sure.  but you can't say someone saying "Biden fucking blows, Trump blows more" is misinforming anyone.  and on the initial reaction to Harris, comments are high.  relax, we all knew this was coming.
Lord forgive me but I made a Steamed Hams for Biden/Harris ticket
sorry, i've strayed, just, people will weigh their options, and people are more than welcome to convince them to vote Biden.  blaming people who point out the flaws in the D ticket as helping Trump is an admission that voters are stupid, and i never like basing things on...
Biden and Harris will know how to handle a pandemic, saving countless lives. Over 165K dead because of Donald Trump's mishandling of the pandemic.  Now he wants to rig the election again by defunding the USPS
Joe Biden: Still Got the Spirit
i mean, i think it's weird to blame Shaun.  but whatever, i can only speak for myself.  and i personally am thinking about not voting for Biden.  i've said, repeatedly, if i lived in a swing state, i would, but i live somewhere where's he's ahead by 33.  _33_.
i won't say vote for Biden either.  that doesn't mean you can't come to that conclusion all on your own because you're not a damn automaton who needs things directly spelled out for you.
And/or Biden
and i think this is the crux.  acting like anyone who isn't 1000% on board espousing the Biden/Harris ticket is seen as encouragement of abstain, and abstain = Trump.  WE UNDERSTAND WHAT THE STAKES ARE.  people can complain, and still fucking get it.
WSJ Opinion: A Biden Presidency Won't Help Black School Children
Shaun can speak for himself, but he seems to have the same gist, and he doesn't even get to vote here.  but he's never said voting for Biden is wrong and i've never said voting for Biden is wrong -- i'm saying there _are_ valid positions and reasons to not vote for Biden.
is a literal slap on the face to anyone who's been on the street since Ferguson.  am i recommending not voting for Biden?  no.  but fuck sugarcoating it, we're left with this guy, the not-so-much-racist-and-fascist-and-misogynist, to save us from outright fascism.
about encouragement.  but i mean, you really gotta want it.  a lot of people do want it, heh.  so i'll say the same things now: Biden is a terrible candidate, will be a terrible president, is not good on almost...any issue.  and the issue at hand, Harris as VP...
which maybe one would take as "encouraging people note to vote for Biden," but that's not true.  it's pointing out Biden's flaws.  and the only thing he's specifically encouraged for US voting is don't vote Trump.  now, i get the argument, and Vaush even made one specifically...
Sanders-voters are already blamed for Trump.  also the left != Sanders-voters, but that's for another time.  i've watched almost every Shaun vid, and just searched through his tweets about Biden, and honestly, he's only said nearly exactly the same things i've said...
Biden’s VP pick makes history, but not much sense- these people are so damn delusional they actually believe their own fake polls just like the last time!and if the left thinks women are going to blindly vote for Biden bcuz of kamala they’re wrong again.😄
I heard not only will Biden remove kids from cages but he will also be recycling those cages in order to build a bridge. And YOU can buy that bridge, DM for details
One thing I am really looking forward to in a Biden Admin is for the  naturalization test to include questions on Black, Asian and Native American etc history on that test. I’m tired of seeing some immigrants disrespect people who were here before them. Cc:
at the very least, i'd ask once again, who is it people are mad at?  who is it with some vast platform advocating against voting for Biden are you folk afraid is going to swing the election? cause again if it's just twitter peeps, maybe relax a little. (not saying u mad specific)
Per the CNN exit poll, 56% of 2020 SC Primary voters were African-American.  Further, per the exit poll, Biden won 61% of black voters in the Palmetto State.
What do  &amp;  think of #Russia?  compiled quotes from Biden and Harris on what U.S. policies towards Russia they'd pursue as well as on U.S.-Russia relations and Russia itself:
Oh lordy...lemme guess: Obama/Biden bad. trump good. Russia fake. Are arrests forthcoming?
Yup. I think he was almost certainly ratfucked out of the nomination again even before Biden made it explicit that they'd blame Sanders for every single person who died of COVID-19 during the primary, AND I no longer concern myself with what Sanders says.
Yes, some of the proposals made by Sanders would do much to address these concerns, but I doubt Biden/Harris is going to push much for free (state) college.
This has gotta be the 3rd or 4th poll today that I’ve seen with Biden in a double digit lead. Not ideal.
They are no better than Trump supporters! They are just as radical and unhinged! We need to keep pushing them, even if Biden gets in we can not stop the movement for BIG changes! Demand it!
Justin: "She is noted to be an energetic and exciting public speaker who can engage large crowds and draw national media attention, all traits that Biden has struggled to display."

This is what I'm saying. For YOU Biden is less bad. For somebody without health insurance, likely living paycheck-to-paycheck, they have an equal chance of dying or losing their homes. Biden (quite literally) tells such people not to vote for him. Just be aware.

Probably still not going to vote for President, but I actually kind of like Kamala. She sucks on a bunch of stuff, but on the whole she is better than anyone (except maybe Gore) who has ever been on the Democratic ticket. Maybe Biden will wander off into the woods or something
Ummm, no.  Like Bernie, Joe Biden came in to the nomination with a base.  Now you may not see them, because they’re darker (and older) ...
Or... they will die under either regime. For a lot of people, the two meal options are both broken glass. Biden, for you, isn't broken glass. Fine. Tread lightly around people for whom he is.
But once I saw this video after IA, I knew Biden was going to win the nomination:
Let’s spread the word. It’s time to take a stand.
To a shocking number of people, both candidates are broken glass. They'll die (literally) under either regime.  Now, to YOU, Biden may be a pile of crap and you vote for him because of it. Cool. But be careful not to attack people for whom both are broken glass.
It there is a Trump press conference today, will you turn off your TV and social media accounts? We will.
Joe Biden is a moderate.  is... I don’t know what. An opportunist?  A sell out?  A third rate anchor?
I kind of feel like not turning the A in Harris into a star of some kind is a bit of lost potential in the current Biden-Harris branding.
and once again, i think there is a very real _conversation_(not blind agree) to be explored more fully in terms of leftists in clinched states voting for Hawkins (if they like his policy), as there is virtue in a reminder that an anti-Trump mandate is not a Biden-platform mandate
i don't agree with that at face.  i'm also still not sure who you're talking about, because i think it's just people on twitter.  like Ryan Knight has 373k followers, Biden has 8.3m.  Sanders himself is actively advocating for Biden, and not even pointing out his negatives.
is that why you want to get involved in Biden's administration ?!!!?
Again: not ideal, not perfect, not full-proof, ad hoc, imprecise definitions of "masking", varying enforcement. List goes on.  But one (damn) state at a time, Trump has lost this fight that is, only in his world, a fight.   He is the outlier, not Biden.  Report it that way.  6/

How Biden Chose Harris: A Search That Forged New Stars, Friends and Rivalries  Biden winnowed a large list to four finalists before settling on Harris, in a process shaped by questions of loyalty. He is eyeing other contenders for top administration jobs.
just because it might be loud right now doesn't mean no one is going to vote for Biden.  and yes, some are saying they won't vote D, but i think we're all conflating immediate response to an event for national trends.
personally, i've criticized Biden this entire cycle, and also said i'd vote for him if i lived in a swing state for sure, and might even tho i don't.  i can't get on board with the thought of absolute hearts and smiles.
She is not capable of not following where the winds blow her. Plus, Biden has always been pro creditor.
This is leadership 😂 Biden: "I got hairy legs that turn blonde in the sun. The kids used to come up and reach in the pool &amp; rub my leg down so it was straight &amp; watch the hair come back up again. So I learned about roaches, I learned about kids jumping on my lap..."
alas, i am not advocating for not voting for Biden overall.  i am saying there are acceptable reasons to vote for, say, Hawkins, in certain states, or if finding Biden completely morally objectionable. and it's fine to criticize the ticket, any ticket, without burning it all down
Hillary Clinton stated that she will participate in Biden's administration - very strong reason to believe that Dems have something up in their sleeve
Has ANY pollster tried to estimate likely voters accounting for GOP voter suppression effects on R vs D voting?  Marquette University poll showed HUGE differences in R vs D voters for mail-in vs in-person voting.  Are current large Biden poll advantages completely misleading?
i agree completely, but it's also prefectly acceptable to recognize problems and not get into the "D ticket is perfect!" narrative.  also very real reasons to not vote Biden, such as credible accusation of sexual assault, or just living in a state where he's polling +30.
Ok I needed a good laugh today! 😂Blaming your mishandling of the virus on Biden? Sorry little buddy, this ain’t gonna fly with voters. #BidenHarris2020Landslide
A lot of people considered Joe Biden a total joke for most of his career. And yet here we are ! He is a literal bridge between the first African American president and the first female African/Asian American vice president. Luck 'o the Irish ! 🍀
Hysterically funny that Trump lies about following the science. He is so obviously ignorant of science ie drink Lysol to kill the virus. Most children cleaning fluids are poisonous!  Biden &amp; Harris are intelligent solid people who can follow science &amp; have common sense!
The world laughs right now at Trump as the bully clown failing to lead the USA.  Biden will rebuild the respect America always had before the Trump Administration!
Foxnews just had Kellyanne Conway stating that a mandate for masks was what the Trump administration has been advocating for and that Biden is just plagiarizing Trump
Joe Biden has more religious credibility than any nominee of either party going back to Jimmy Carter. He does NOT have a problem with religion at all. Like Christ, Joe was Resurrected (by Jim Clyburn) !
I mean... Biden's no Socialist yet he likes to get publicly owned with his asinine statements so...
Yeah I mean it’s definitely concerning bc some polls have shown most Biden supporters plan to vote by mail, but the fact is we know about the problem and the Dems can plan ahead by encouraging early voting and dropping off mail ballots in drop boxes if possible.
If people don’t get their mail ballots, most of them will probably just go vote in person. Biden’s lead will probably tighten, but it’ll probably still be high enough that some ballots getting to election offices too late won’t swing the entire thing.
The Biden comeback isn't just something the Democrats are self-congratulating over -- conservatives think it was stunning too.
You're really discounting how genuinely miraculous the consolidation around Biden was. Without him overperforming his polls in SC off of 3 terrible first contests AND Buttigieg + Klobuchar endorsing him AND him overperforming on Super Tuesday Bernie actually could have won
True. Biden will almost certainly not be able to confirm her without the Senate, but at this point that might be true of literally his entire cabinet depending on how Mitch wants to play things.
Reminder: a vote for Biden/Harris is a vote for college football in the spring.
Sounds like music 🎶, isn’t Biden? Biden ? Biden ... ah you can’t hear me you’re in the basement 😜
You assume I would vote for Biden if Hawkins weren't on the ballot. You're wrong. Go recruit non-voters if you think your case is so strong. I'm always voting to the left because that's the best way to pressure the system and strengthen our movement.
To be fair, I don't think Harris will hurt Biden as much as Palin hurt McCain in the election. Palin completely destroyed the McCain candidacy.
As someone else recently put it, any progressive action will be organized around, over, under, or careening through a Biden Administration, but it will not be coming from, by, or with a Biden Administration. At best, they will do *slightly* less to actively impede &amp; detain us.
The important thing to understand about a potential Biden Administration is that progressives or leftists of any kind and tendency will not be running it, will not be co-running it, will not be a junior partner in it, will for all intents &amp; purposes not be part of it.
a must-read for anyone pushing the "but you *have* to vote for Biden" line
It's actually Biden (2020-2022) Harris (2022-2024) Buttigieg (2024-2032) Chasten (2032-2040), but I don't blame you for underestimating Chasten. Easy mistake to make.
A model that's still almost certainly more accurate than all other models out this year, just like his 2016 model crushed the competition?  95% confidence for Biden is not correct.
Biden/Harris raised almost as much money in 48 hours as Biden did in all of 2019, $59 million.

Insightful background about the process/priorities in Biden's VP decision. Comforting that they agreed to Biden's staff leading any decisions around building the combined Biden/Harris team after some of the personnel challenges in Harris' primary campaign.
Biden/Harris need to shout this out that anyone complicit could face consequences
President Trump, you just can’t stand strong outspoken women of color. You insult them all the time in a disgraceful racist manner. I will certainly welcome VP Harris along with President Biden in January.
It’s amazing how Trump buys into the extreme right wing, even actively supporting a candidate who is tied to QANON. Joe Biden at least does not fancy himself a dictator like you do. And he hardly left wing.
This is exactly the type of shit I’m talking about. And ironically, Kamala harrris DID separate children from their families as AG, Biden DID separate children and families at the border and biden DID send in federal enforcement to deal with protesters, using the same tear...
Unfortunately over 165K dead people because of your poor pandemic response won't be around for a Biden Presidency.

Virginia mayor urged to resign after saying Biden picked 'Aunt Jemima as his VP' via nbcnews -
Biden calls for mandate requiring all Americans to wear masks  #FoxNews  👇 already being a true leader!
The Trump campaign insinuating that Kamala isn't a U.S. citizen just merely two days after she was announced Biden's VP is completely disgusting and overtly racist.
Thread. Masking! Biden calls on Govs to mandate masks. This is essential, as it is actually the norm; don't let the faux rage about taking away freedom make this seem like a real debate. 35 states already under masking orders, covering nearly 75% of the American population. 1/

Joe Biden doesn't mind being the old white lube used to slide America into fuller and fairer representation ! #ObamaBiden #BidenHarris
I always love these predictions. There is no way to refute them. You can’t be wrong. 10,000 people die, would have been 50,000. 60,000 die, would have been 100,000. As Biden says, it’s horse puckey.
oh no Biden has lost the all-important "QAnon shitheel" demographic
It sounds like a conspiracy to violate citizens' civil rights. Stiff jail term if convicted. Biden/Harris and a bunch of people should say this publicly and often. Might intimidate some people out of helping.
Biden will make our country proud and a huge success again. You are the laughing stock around the world and have made our country a failure or you’re a failure more accurately.
Biden becomes President and Trump flees to Russia.  This is  the goal.  But we have to be prepared for the shenanigans that will be used to block that goal.
It's been pointed out that I'm fear-mongering here.  I'm just trying to prepare for the worst.  But...  The best outcome is we vote in numbers too big to manipulate.  Trump can bring court cases, but there's no real basis and at least 270 Biden electors are certified by Dec. 14.
Still mind-blowing that Trump refused to hold the Saudis accountable after they literally dismembered Khashoggi with a bone saw. We need to elect #Biden and reclaim America's moral leadership.
The difference between Trump and Biden is Trump loves the country and he cares about the future of the country. Biden thinks it’s a big fucking joke. Typical government worker.
Joe biden lost me at "I got a lotta - I got hairy legs that turn"
On the ballot: An end to forever wars   The fall election could be a turning point in American foreign policy, writes  with Biden sniffing the wind, a race for House Foreign Affairs chair, &amp;antiwar candidate  challenging in WMA.
This is what evil looks like. I seriously need both Biden and Harris to apologize for their grave errors in judgement in the past if they hope for my vote.
We are clearly having very different arguments. I do not expect these tactics to work as well as you do. But I was talking about a scenario in which Biden is elected and sworn in and Trump, for whatever reason, plants his ass in the Oval Office.

#BidEn #Harris #NationalMaskMandate Priority 🙏 5 Year Old Boy Riding His Bike As 7 &amp; 8 Sisters He Was Playing With Came Out Held 🔫Loaded Gun To His Head &amp; Shot &amp; Killed The Innocent Child
A fine tribute from Sarah Vowell to public universities and their graduates, which include both members of the Democratic ticket.
Harris may have perfected the craft of "advise and consent" with Justice Kavanaugh, but there is only one founder of "This Is Personal" style Senate hearings, the creator of Borking, Mr. Joe Biden.
Sarah Vowell's fine article misses that Gerald Ford was a grad of Yale Law School.
No, just a company with a very people-centric culture. I’m not big on “one model to rule them all,” particularly, and my personal circles seem to have about 50/50 folks burned out on co-ops vs love them. But I generally favour more/better modes of shared ownership.
Reality is every DNC has an ex-R as a speaker, and every RNC has an ex-D as a speaker.  So it is expected to have an ex-R as a prime time DNC speaker.  John Kasich has endorsed Joe Biden.  That's why Kasich makes sense as this year's R speaking at the DNC.
DNC rules are that you have to endorse the presumptive nominee to get a speaking slot.  See 1992:  Brown, Edmund G. and Casey, Robert P.  Beto has clearly endorsed Joe Biden.  Has AOC?
Why?  Has AOC endorsed Joe Biden yet?  The DNC rules require you to endorse the presumptive nominee to get a speaking slot.  See 1992:  Brown, Edmund G. and Casey, Robert P.
The pigs are alive.
"Being challenged with 'I dare you to say why you're voting for Biden/Harris without mentioning Donald Trump' is like saying 'I dare you to defend chemotherapy without mentioning cancer.'  One of the dumbest proposed exercises on social media."  –
I suppose that's approval ratings and reelections come in handy. Biden is not going to ever want to tarnish his public image. I think once they're securely in office we can really push hard in a very organized way to set these as top priorities.
lol, having a normal one in the alumni facebook group post about how Biden and Harris have no Ivy League ties
Biden and the other Dem campaigns are really going to need to pivot their messaging away from vote by mail, and that is so fucking infuriating in the middle of a pandemic.
Unlike most potential presidents, no one knows what Biden stands for. He’s the figurehead for a shaky coalition that harbors radical views, writes   via
I’m going to vote for Biden/Harris no matter what but to say that criticizing her WHILE STILL SUPPORTING HER TICKET is “insanity” “nonsense” “ego” and “selfish”??? Say you have no empathy for people more marginalized than you and go,  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ 3/3
Compared to Biden, Sanders, Trump and Clinton she's a teenager. And AOC is a newborn.
Personally I think Biden says the wrong thing a lot of time time- he has a pretty outdated mentality on a lot of things- but I think he has a kind heart... at least one that can be moved.
The more interesting question for the Biden-Harris ticket might be the extent to which blunt appeals to gender and race still animate the American electorate today, writes   via
Say what you will about Kamala, she's brought the energy that Biden's campaign was sorely lacking
Say we're the labor leaders and we have to choose which mgmt team we're going to negotiate with... it's going to be imperfect... would you rather negotiate for the future with Trump/Pence or Biden/Harris? Or walk away completely and get nothing. That's the election for me.
Joe Biden promised to nominate a Black woman to the Supreme Court. He'd likely choose one of these two judges  via
We have to fight for every wrung- we already know this. But to even begin that fight, we have to also be willing to sit at the table and have those really difficult discussions. Even with people we disagree with vehemently. Personally, I'd rather negotiate with Biden/Harris.
We call on Biden to address nuclear war danger in campaign  "The United States urgently needs a leader who will have the courage to look at, think hard about, and speak openly about the dire perils posed by our country's vast nuclear arsenal."

I am not feeling particularly aggrieved. My group is bascially Biden/Harris 2020. But thanks.
And his neurologist, if his handlers let him see one. His vocabulary and mental stater are going downhill rapidly.  His “Biden hates God, hates religion” speech was not normal. His speech about Kamala sounded like he just woke up from a nap. What is he on???
I don’t doubt the backlash. The FBI should be at her door since it could be considered a threat against Mr. Biden. But she is an intimate friend to Trump.
and  on #Russia: What have the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee and his newly announced VP pick said on the U.S. policies they advocate on key Russia-related issues, as well as their views on Russia itself? Find out here:

Joe Biden picks Kamala Harris as running mate

biden chose harris cuz she has the most rubbable shoulders
My pleasure. Tech + worker co-ops/progressive biz models = extremely my jam :)
Hi, totally crashing your thread so apologies if you're well familiar with these, but in case you or others would find these resources helpful:   List of tech co-ops:   Another list:     should be on those lists too.
joe biden IS a scorpio!!!
“We’ve created more jobs in the last 3 months than Joe Biden and Barack Obama created in their 8 years in office.” You can argue #sycopence isn’t lying..but you can’t argue he’s being honest:      -1373   -20787     +2725     +4791     +1763 ————-    -12881 jobs LOST IN 5 MONTHS.
Yeah but before October there will be simulated footage of Biden eating a fetus and then looking directly at the camera and saying “yum yum, gimme some”
Are you saying biden would also get 160,000 american citizens dead?    Really?  Do you even understand why we have so many death?    Crazy
So to be clear, you feel firmly that a Trump presidency will offer you as much it not more than a Biden/Harris presidency?
We have 4% of worlds population and between 20-25% of cases and deaths in the world from Covid -19.  166,000 deaths so far . The US has colassely failed in our response to this pandemic.  We must Vote for Biden/ Harris this November.  Vote. Vote. Vote. Vote. Vote. Vote. Vote.
Bush was a terrible president. I agree. I'm not thrilled about Joe Biden either but frankly, he's willing to offer us more than Trump will and it's not a lot to accept but it's more than I'll get throwing away the election over a purity test.

How embarrassing, the sole reason you were selected was the color of your skin &amp; your gender.   By doing so, Biden disrespected every woman &amp; person of color. He essentially is telling the world that qualifications don't matter, the right superficial qualities all that's needed.
So far today... • Fox News broadcast veiled threats against Biden’s life • Trump told Fox that he’s flat out trying to destroy the USPS to kill voting by mail • Pence told America that unemployment isn’t happening  • It’s not even 10am, what the heck

I never thought Bloomberg was a good substitute for Biden. And I always believed all roads in Veepstakes lead back to Kamala Harris.  I’m delighted to say I was right.😉
I nominate Jacob Soboroff as the head of ICE or CBP in a Biden administration. Get a good chief of staff to manage the bureaucracy, while you lead by example and empathy.
Joe Biden is basically this guy from Lord of the Rings, creepily stewarding the ancient halls of power for the billionaire class while they wait for an actual political leader to return
If Trump campaign is going to make ads that highlight Joe's occasional ramblings, the Biden campaign should respond in kind.  Plenty of good material.  Lots of interviews w Trump letting gibberish dribble out of his mouth
A Democratic Debut:  &amp;  make their first appearance together after the Democratic VP choice announcement in Biden’s home state of Delaware.  responds, painting Harris as “rushing to the radical left” #7NewsI'm just listening to that Virginia Mayor give a LAME apology on TV but the funny thing is... He NEVER apologized to Kamala Harris or Joe Biden! I don't think he's sorry, I think he's sorry that everyone got mad &amp; he prob almost lost his seat on city council!
Theoretically that could happen, but realistically...not a chance. I dont think all 3rd party candidates combined will even get 5%. Mass is winner take all, and overwhelmingly blue. Biden is totally safe. Swing states should still vote blue though
HOT TAKE: Biden is obviously much better than Trump, but still irredeemable trash. Since he will inevitably win Mass, I'm using this opportunity to vote Green. I KNOW Hawkins won't win, but he's my preferred candidate of the 3. If this was NH, I'd suck it up and vote Biden.
I was shocked Biden won, it was hugely off from polling and I don't know anyone who supported him.
Trump has my vote. Biden is a nut
Biden is a good man, hes lost so much that he understands real Pain! He doesn't have a racist bone in his body! For me I feel at his age he knows what must be done to make this country work for all of us. He cant b bought &amp; he doesnt Lie, this is his legacy &amp; will work hard 4 us!
Normally I wouldn’t consider something like this a big deal cuz a lot of their members would vote differently but in this situation I’m sure their ALL pissed enough to vote Biden
Ask Baker if he supports Biden’s call for a mandatory mask mandate from all Governors. Let’s find out how left Baker has gone

How Biden Chose Harris: A Search That Forged New Stars, Friends and Rivalries
Everyone wants changes to be made for voting in this election due to the Coronavirus, but for some reason, the Biden camp refuses to consider moving up the debate schedule to accommodate the larger than normal early voting.  Something is not adding up. #Debates2020
So is it ok for the Trump campaign to spy on Biden/Harris now??   ?
...has been usually lost in the mainstream media coverage of the event.  This event is a few years old, but Biden has been bringing it up and that is why it is getting attention again.
President Trump has taken questions at the end of all his press conferences the last several days since the VP announcement. (He almost always does anyway.)  Biden and Harris have taken a grand total of zero at their three events together so far.  🤔
Hold your nose and vote for Biden to get the psycho out of our house before he screws anything else up.
"Top former aides ... David Axelrod and [ Jon Favreau, Tommy Vietor, Jon Lovett and Dan Pfeiffer—at times ridiculed the former VP’s campaign. Biden is one of the few candidates to have not gone on either of their popular podcasts ... despite having been invited"
Great behind the scenes long-read.“numerous administration veterans ... remember it differently: Obama had begun embracing Clinton as a possible successor years before Biden lost his son, while the VP was laying the groundwork for his own campaign.”
If I want to survive the coronavirus (I'm at high risk), I must vote Biden.
PETER LUCAS: If Biden is elected, be prepared to live in the new dystopian United States
Vote for Biden. He will bring back our country.
It is not because Kamala Harris is a woman, or because she is not white, that people like me have an issue with her, and might be perceived as “freaking out” about her.  It’s 1) her views on the issues, and 2) considering Biden’s age and evident cognitive decline, the reality...
I agree - I can’t stand Trump but I won’t vote for Biden either because of this. I will blank the ballot for the second presidential election in a row.
John, you know perfectly well that when an incumbent runs for re-election, it's always a referendum on his job performance. NOT a choice between the incumbent and the challenger. With 180,000 dead by Election Day, Trump will lose no matter what Biden says or doesn't say.

Trump has shot America in the lung. Liberals propose electing Biden cuz he promises to put a bandaid on it, but whats needed is emergency surgery. Meanwhile, Biden announces his plans to improve on Trump's policies by shooting us in the leg next time.
I have heard Some catholics say they can’t vote for Biden because he supports abortion, meanwhile #DonaldTrump does not go to church......give that some thought
Harris bringing energy, dollars and more to Biden’s campaign
Now that would be making America great again. So another words..nope not gonna happen. Their not going to bite the hand that feeds them. Last thing they want is Joe Biden getting elected. They know they’ll b richly rewarded by trump getting rid of USPS
It seems like if Biden loses we’re not getting a better candidate next time. No valid reason not to vote for Biden.
I mean I'm sure you tweeted this same thing after Biden pronounced her name wrong yesterday right?
we will storm the polls and vote and the BIDEN administration will start the process of healing our country.
Obama/Biden literally built the cages and filled it with kids before 2016
You think things like bounties on our military men could happen under Biden, like it has under Trump, a virus consuming our country, lack of morals, befriending chid traffickers.
Thank you Project Lincoln you Guys are AWSOME love your ADS keep them coming. And i will keep sharing,  Biden 2020 bring on the Blue Wave.
AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!  The Democrat establishment is so desperate after the flopped reveal of Kamala Harris, Joe Biden's worsening dementia, and leftist riots that they're trying to revive the Golden Showers story!  They're sinking and there's nothing they can do!
Ok. Go convince voters who actually would support biden bc i dont vote rapists on principle.
Trump is not a true leader! But at least he has the stones to stand up for our Country &amp; answer for his own actions, while Joe Biden runs &amp; hides. Jill Biden answers more for him than he does! Ask yourself, what has he really done in his 50 year Pol-Career, all on the US $$!
When Biden was nominated for President and led in Polls
The other possibility is that Biden is so deep into dementia he just isn't aware that it's a hoax.
There's less here than meets the eye. Biden's exact words were that each of the state governments of the 50 states should implement a mask mandate. Which, btw, is what happened with car seat belt laws. Each state has its own, and they differ from state to state.
Private prison industry backs Trump, prepares if Biden wins
Can Joe Biden’s VP pick, Sen. Kamala Harris, the first Black and South Asian American woman to be selected for a presidential ticket of a major party, help Biden win over independents and conservatives?  experts say she is ‘the safest choice’
Fuck Joe Biden.  #DefundKamala
EDITORIAL: Biden’s VP pick puts U.S. on cusp of history
This is a widespread view among conservatives. On right-wing websites, you'll see plenty of speculation that the DNC will kick Biden off the ticket, possibly replacing him with Hillary.
The good ratings were following Harris and Biden
You could say the same thing, only worse, about the Obama Biden admin.  The unemployment rate finally fell to where it was when they took office 6 years later.
Biden is senile not insane, but you're right, a third will stick to him no matter what.
We are making history again as Joe Biden chooses Kamala Harris as his running mate! We are getting close to possibly having our first ever female Vice President. #CrystalTimeMachine
There is simply no greater moral or human rights  issue in our time than abortion.  It kills more innocent people than anything else.  I hope people understand the gravity of this issue, and think long and hard before voting for Biden/Harris or anyone of any political party...
...would be the most pro-choice, pro-abortion one ever.  The differences could not be more stark.  For those of us who believe in the sanctity of all human life from womb to tomb, the prospects of a Biden/ Harris Presidency should cause us grave concern.
In this election you will see the greatest disparity in terms of candidates positions on abortion than ever before.  The record clearly shows Trump/Pence is the most pro-life, anti-abortion administration since Roe v Wade, and it also shows a Biden/Harris administration...
I had my doubts about Biden’s Catholicism already with his stance on abortion, but his selection of someone like Harris, confirms my belief that he does not take it very seriously.
But upon reflection, I think that speaks to the reality that everyone is thinking right now, that Kamala would really be the President if they are elected, considering Biden’s age and clearly evident cognitive decline.
Joe Biden and Kamala Harris pushed past their one-time political rivalry to deliver an aggressive attack on the character and performance of President Donald Trump in their historic first appearance as running mates.
The fact that she was “ mean” to  &amp; he picked her anyway shows that Biden is a strong man who doesn’t need or want sycophants around him. No wonder you don’t understand it.
So Biden works hard to get things done where you just roll on by? Got it.
To all BIDEN/HARRISsupporters... Newsweek is letting a Repubican Racist start another birther bullshit campaign on Kamala! #WeHaveMomalasBack
It took me a while to find Biden palatable, so forgive me if I feel the same way about Kamala Harris. I need to warm up to her
I mean, I think its that the establishment wanted her all along, and this way when Biden inevitably dies, 🤷‍♀️
Nah, Barr coming down with indictments in late October. If it's looking grim for Trump's re-election expect Biden, Obama, Comey and Rice to be arrested
If Biden wins, I think we can pretty much cancel out any progressives as president for the next 12 years at least. The assumption is Biden does 1 term. It’s hard to see Harris losing a primary after being the VP so that’s a possible another 8 years.
Perhaps but history is against her - George HW Bush was only VP since Martin Van Biden to become president after his predecessor competed his term
No need donny, Joe Biden will take care of that!!! Fuel up the plane and head for Scotland!!!!
*Joe Biden straightens his tie, clears his throat, and delivers his monologue. He pauses, glancing at Trump, waiting for his rebuttal. But there is silence. Trump is looking past him, staring into space. Biden wheels around, and sees this waiting for him.
Billionaires also have the same spending limits for campaigns as we do. PACs are a different story, but since this story was about the Biden for President campaign it includes the FEC.
Really not feeling motivated to volunteer for a Biden/Harris ticket but there's plenty of down ballot races to be excited about. Right?
I mean Biden beat her head to head in the primary election, she dropped out because she was polling even with Tom Steyer, and the more people got to know her, the less they liked her. This is the honeymoon period, the media is hyping her. She brings zero new voters
Biden and his new partner Kamala. He calls women by their first names all the time. Dr. Fauci and Debra. Biden and Kamala. Governor Cuomo from New York and Gretchen from Michigan.
Bill Barr arresting Obama and Biden in late October is in play
I'm looking forward to voting for these two. Enthusiasm level just went up a notch or two.  #BidenHarris2020   Watching Joe Biden Introduces Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) As Running Mate
No. But maybe Biden, working with Dr. Fauci and other experts and congressional leaders, can find ways to prevent thousands more deaths.
Yes ! Obama/Biden pulled us out of the depths of the Great Recession.  Trump Killed it all!
Wow! That live address from Biden &amp; Harris knocked it out of the park! And the music before? Hell yes!
The saddest thing will be if Biden wins. Then it is the fault of all the fools who voted for him!!
biden would be still digging the hole at nearly the same speed lol
Their talking points had Biden being a segregationist all the way back to yesterday morning. They are so confused.
I agree wholeheartedly. But I will say that as a progressive myself, the only ways to get progressive leaders in office is through Democratic seats. It’s the nature of the system and we have to game it. I don’t want Biden, but I’ll vote for him. KH is the 4th most prog Senator rn
Joe Biden wanted a female minority VP running mate. But, Tulsi Gabbard was never in the mix 😆
It will be the fight of our lives but our chances to get something resembling #UBI or #mc4a or #GreenNewDeal are much better with a Biden Harris white house then with a trump one. And this is coming from someone who was willing to let it all burn down 4 or 5 months ago.
biden is a racist. there are countless receipts on this. just because someone explicitly doesn't say "i hate black people and minorites" doesn't mean they aren't racist.
I'm not "voting blue." I haven't become a Dem. I am voting for Biden as a one-off in order to fire Trump for his incompetence on COVID, which led to the unnecessary deaths of tens of thousands of Americans. #LincolnVoter
The problem for Biden is that while he is historically a pretty mainstream Democrat, his platform is pure woke.  Harris is young and presentable but how does a former "cop" fit in with a "defund the police" party?
It doesn’t matter. People that like Harris were voting for Biden anyways. Doesn’t hurt, doesn’t help. Won’t pull many progressives and won’t pull many independents.
I am member of pissed off old men for BIDEN.
now, more than likely, Biden knows how it goes, and he explicitly did not promise anyone anything - just a wink and a nod. But as Yang said, he probably nevertheless made it clear without outright saying it.
Harris/Pence debate is going to be anticlimactic. Pence is pretty reserved and will be harder to rattle than Trump. A Harrris/Trump debate would be great I think. Biden would be better off having her do it anyways.
JOE BIDEN &amp; KAMALA ARE GOING TO HAVE A HARD TIME WINNING #OHIO WITH JUDGE &amp;  GOT BLACK MEN IN JAIL FOR MARIJUANA?   WHAT ABOUT #PENNSYLVANIA? WHERE JUDGE BRINKLEY IN PHILADELPHIA. AN AKA LIKE HARRIS HAD TO BE FORCED TO RELEASE MEEK MILL? #hiphop #HipHopMusic #MaPoli 🇺🇸
I said from the jump the only people I wouldn’t vote for under any circumstance was Biden, Buttiegieg, and Bloomberg when he joined. All of the others I could have possibly mustered up enough will to vote for.
Harris being VP won’t get me to vote for Biden. But I would probably vote for her if she was the nominee. I still don’t like her but I can sleep at night voting for her.
I have stopped with the Joe Biden and Trump are the same arguments though. Mostly because I have to believe Biden and the people around him would have handled this pandemic better. But honestly that’s the only difference I see. But that one difference is HUGE.
I’m so glad I’m not in a swing state lol. I can be comfortable knowing my mind is made up on not voting for Biden. Not sure if I’m writing in or going Green Party but I know for a fact Biden isn’t getting my vote.
This is Maureen Dowd-level stupidity regarding very recent history. I mean, Biden was a key link in keeping that streak going, you pedophile-enabling homophobic jackass!
I’m not questioning her qualifications. Just the selection by Biden.
Biden seeks-out his own level of integrity.
Yeah I’m not that naive to junk that it’s all the candidate. But all the talking points today has tried to paint the picture that it was Biden who is bringing her in.   But after all the animosity during the campaign it just doesn’t seem like it’s a blend of ideas here.
How Biden chose Harris: Inside his search for a running mate
She’s staying there for us! Please elect Biden so that poor lady can FINALLY get some rest!
Both could be an option but don’t feed me the line that it was all Biden.
Honest question.   Did Biden really pick Harris or did the DNC pick Harris for Biden?
I’m a white guy. I’m doing fine, thanks. And I’ll be voting for Biden. I just wish I could vote for sexy Scott B over Ed Markey.
Biden picks Kamala Harris as running mate, first Black woman
JOE BIDEN &amp; KAMALA HARRIS TARGETED BLACK MEN! THE MORE BLACK MEN THEY INCARCERATE? THE MORE MESSR SHOWS FAVOR! 🇺🇸 #MaPoli #BosPoli #Kamala #EMBARGO
One thing i realized is Trumps just not strong enough to have a woman by his side as president! Hes a misogynistic asshat! Biden is man enough to have Kamala by his side, who will hold her own &amp; be a partner in leading this Country into an America that is... "OF BY &amp; FOR THE PPL"
Maya Rudolph reacts to Kamala Harris as Biden's VP pick, her SNL return
And she also beleives Trump raped Young Girls....Ill leave my kids with Harris &amp; Biden
if Biden cut a deal with her to drop out in exchange for VP, thats literally illegal
Why you think things will get better with Trump losing when the Dems have already proven themselves enablers of him confuses me. Biden is just gonna continue Trump's policies. He said is gonna keep building the wall, gonna keep crushing the protests, gonna keep secret police...
Every time I hear the name Beau Biden my brain involuntarily says “banana fanna fo fiden” #BidenHarris
Donald Trump isn’t going to go after policy issues. He’s going to go after the context of Joe Biden’s and Kamala Harris’ character. Donald Trump is and always will be weak.
lol Biden as a reformer
so, we defeating Biden/Harris and Trump/Pence, then? cool! #VoteGreen2020
i am sorry you cannot have ACAB as your twitter name and support Biden/Harris. You're gonna explode in a puff of logic any second now.
every second u spend arguing with leftists online who have genuine concerns abt biden is time u can spend phonebanking for biden ;)
im sorry, do u actually think i follow everything that comes out of bernie's mouth? lol i disagree heavily with bernie's methodology and i frankly think he was too cowardly with what he had to endure twice. if u really wanna help joe biden get elected u should go phonebank.
Biden already got my two votes!😄
Was Kelly WAS........ We will be much better off with Biden and Harris!!!!
So Biden has a VP.  TAKE MY VOTE ALREADY
Why don't you explain to them that this can be a one-off for them? They just have to vote for Biden, that's all. Maybe asking them to become *Democrats* is a bit too much for them.
This can only be true if you don’t count Biden as catholic, but if you don’t count Biden as catholic, then the 2008 and 2012 ticket also didn’t have a catholic. If that’s the case then this isn’t the first time in a long time... So eitherway you are lying.
You think joe Biden will be any better than trump? The man literally can’t form a damn sentence but I guess incompetence is the only competence y’all see in order to really think the democrats are “for the people”
Bernie supporters vote so much he lost to Clinton and Biden. That's horrible.
Democrats are risking everything by choosing to have a candidate that’s running on “not Donald Trump” as opposed to having a candidate running on real change. If Biden loses they will blame everyone and everything except their own corruption.
And if they're going to give Bernie credit for voting for VAWA or gun restrictions in the 1994 bill they need to give Biden even more credit, by their own logic, because he wrote it and didn't just vote for it.
So now that we know Biden's VP is definitely a woman, will Pence be ok being alone on a debate stage with a woman that's not his wife?   Will he have to ask Mother for permission?
literally screaming defund the police and biden chooses the alpha police lieutenant law enforcement officer general cop for VP. 😪.
Are you happy with Joe Biden’s choice of running mate, Sen. Kamala Harris?
Joe Biden selects Senator Kamala Harris to be his vice presidential running mate
how does one ignore that Kamala Harris said she believes the women who accused joe Biden of sexual assault and then runs w him make it make sense 😞
Imagine picking a woman who think you're a rapist as VP.  Kamala Harris said she believes the woman who accused Joe Biden of rape. What self respecting person would work someone they think is a rapist?  #BidenHarris2020 #KamalaHarrisForVP
DONALD TRUMP DEFEATED HILLARY IN WISCONSIN, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan, &amp; Florida..  Which of these States does Joe Biden take back to win the Presidency.? 🇺🇸🤔🧐   #BidenHarris #VicePresident #KamalaHarrisForVP #COVID #BreonnaTaylor #EMBARGO 🎁 #HipHopMusic #HipHopRepublicans
Im lgbt+ and biden would hurt me too and go lookup deportation statistics under obama
Kamala was honestly the only person Biden could have went with in 2020. A centrist who is also a black woman. I’m not voting for him but it could help with some potential voters.
Stop. Is that who Biden picked?
Thanks to the Biden VP announcement!  #BidenHarris2020  #BidenHarris2020Landslide  #TrumpIsLosing
2. Warren can enact more substantive change from a cabinet position or as a lioness in the Senate.  3. Biden is going to be one term. This VP is likely the 2024 candidate. 4 years from now Warren will be 75. Hence the need for somebody younger.  Again, I say as a huge Warren fan.
If Trump wins then the dems have themselves to blame, so many better candidates than Biden
Just tried to buy my Biden/Harris merch, and I think the site is crashing already! Too many AWESOME PEOPLE on there!! YEAH, BABY! Feel that #BlueWave rising? #BidenHarris2020
Nothing is ideal, Biden is my last choice, it is what it is. I’m all in to salvage democracy.
It’s a real race to the bottom this year. I’ll admit I didn’t have “Biden picking a cop as vp  in the midst of nationwide blm protests” on my bingo card.
She did so bad in the Democratic debates she couldn't make past Iowa. The only person she "annihilated" was Biden and got ended by Tulsi.
Joe Biden, a conservative Democrat, picks Kamala Harris, a pro-law enforcement Democrat, during a time when the country wants law enforcement reform. At least it’s a woman, and a POC. I’m still voting Trump out, but his pick solidifies his position as against progressives ideas.
good luck. I like you and your platform. I'm not a Biden fan. I'll be looking for you in 2024
Biden/Harris. Love it.
Y’all remember when Kamala called Biden out for being friends with racist segregationists. Guess Kamala doesn’t.
Yep! It’s proof that Biden isn’t afraid of strong women and is willing to surround himself with smart people who will disagree with him. Yahoo!
#VPPick  I’m a little surprised; I thought it was going to be #SusanRice . I’m not sure how Kamala helps Biden in the swing states.  It will be interesting to see how/ if this pic helps or hurts him.
Extremely happy about this. BIDEN/HARRIS 2020  Lowell, Massachusetts
Yes!!! The best choice for this moment!! Biden/Harris 2020!!!
100% not voting for Biden now
I promise that I will be as excited by Biden's VP choice as I was when Obama chose Biden.
Kamala Harris is Biden’s VP pick!!  Yes!!!!!!
Biden-Harris baby gonna mop the floor with Pence in the debate #BidenVP #BidenHarris2020
Biden should announce his running mate at the same moment trump steps on stage for yet another one of his WH rallies!!
THE RUSSIANS HAVE STARTED PUTTING OUT FALSE INFO ALREADY... ITS NOT GONNA WORK, SORRY! I cant wait to see Putin on bended knee to "PRESIDENT BIDEN"🇺🇸
Biden isn’t a Traitor, or a pedophile, or a mass murderer, Junior. Nice weak tea you’re serving! #TraitorTrump
Biden will mop the floor with him. But no debate until we see the taxes!
Look, if the most important issue to you is abortion, then absolutely you cannot vote for Biden. But given everything that's happened to America, even an evidently religious person like yourself should give equal weight (at least) to other issues this year.
Graham also didn’t want to rush into any investigations of his good ole friend, Joe Biden’s son, about Ukraine. Over his long years of knowing Joe, Graham has thought him an admirable public servant.
I will only vote blue if Biden himself is replaced, so no, it won't change anything ❤️
Clearly it means "Vote for Biden. He keeps the 10 Commandments." (my tongue is only a little bit in my cheek)
I voted for her of course but I do think she could've done a better job campaigning and debating. Didn't come across strong or sincere. Im hoping Biden gets his game on soon. He's ok but needs some more fire. I think.😬
I feel dumber every time I hear you speak. You’re a fraud, a cheater, and Joe Biden could beat you in a battle of the brainless.
I will still vote for biden. But I agree with this sentiment
Hey if I bring up issues about Biden then it erases everything terrible Trump has done, right?
I'm sorry, but you know the rules.  Joe Biden will be by shortly to personally take back your black card.
I come from a Military Family, that being said if you vote for trump a man who knows putin put a bounty on our Soldiers that’s UN-AMERICAN !!! Our President DOES NOT HAVE OUR SOLDIERS BACK SO LETS SHOW THEM THAT WE DO BY VOTING FOR JOE BIDEN!!!
Does she forget blaming losses in heavily Blsck states in uneducated and under informed voters?

Another spoiler alert: Biden will beat Trump by at least 150 electoral votes.
Whomever Biden chooses to be his running mate will not affect my vote, unless of course it's anyone named Trump. And, though it's not urgent that I know today, making the announcement soon is the right thing for him to do. 💙
has reported that Joe Biden came out from his basement to chose former UN Ambassador Susan Rice to his running mate
Is Hunter Biden in politics? Is he actively commenting on Politics or involved in any Political Campaign? NOPE. So STFU
Biden's communication team must respond quickly and repeatedly.
stop this nonsense about electing Biden, a sick man, president.
They’ve stooped to gathering fake signatures to get Kanye West of all people on the ballot in key states. Hmmmm, trying to steal votes from Biden? tRump maybe demented, but Kanye is downright crazy. And there will be people that will vote for him.
IMO its admirable Biden decided to choose a woman, and terrible he announced it before hand. As you say, it pits women against each other, but also because it alows people to devalue the choice by implying the choice was because she was a woman, and not the most qualified
I feel like Biden was giving us a quest when he told the corn pop story &amp; now we all have to track him down &amp; duel Corn Pop to get a rare piece of armor or something
#VoteOutRacism by refusing to vote for Biden or Trump. Both are racist. Trump is spit in your eye racism, Biden is write a bill criminalizing your existence racism.
Biden is harder to hate than Hillary was.
I hope that Biden will take direction from Dr. Fauci rather than Laura Ingraham. She has a lot to answer for.
Plenty of us Americans aren't sure that it's Joe Biden. All we know for sure is that it's not Trump.
Biden should contact leading COVID epidemiologists immediately. (Maybe have one as a campaign adviser). Come up with a reasonable plan, present it during the campaign, and get ready to put it into effect on Day One of his new administration.
Yeah true, I’m not arguing that. I’m just saying that it’s false that African Americans are not diverse, like Biden suggested
It is about race when you suggest the only reason Biden would pick a black women is because of the “current moment” instead of her own qualifications and personality. This idea that black people advance because of their blackness is blatant racism and we deal with it every day!
I DON’T THINK 🤔  &amp;  HELPS THE CAUSE OF #BREONNATAYLOR WITH THEIR NEW MUSIC 🎶 SELECTION! LOOK ALL AROUND #AMERICA! BLACK WOMEN ARE GUNNED DOWN BY BROTHERS! NOT POLICE 👮! GIVING NO VALUE! NOW LET’S TALK ABOUT BIDEN’S V.P. PICK? #hiphop #HipHopMusic #Mapoli

Peter Lucas: Adopting many of Sanders’ policy decisions makes Biden a ‘Bernie Bro’
Wrong! Biden directed the place to make them available but there was a National Security concern.
Biden was accused ( after being VP for 8 yrs without being accused) &amp; there wasn’t any back up. Trump has 45 sexual harassment allegations against him &amp; a woman fighting to get his DNA prior to the election. Clinton’s allegations came out after he was elected, but not ok
I’m supporting Joe Biden for president because he’ll be a steadfast advocate for our nation’s public school students and educators.   Will you pledge to support Joe, too?
It’s weird Geraldo would bring attention to Trump and him being friends and then pretend he wants to honestly interview Biden.
If it's fair why use this as a stupid "gotcha?" We can't if people like you are lying about Biden and depressing turnout like "progressives" did in 2016, 2010 and 2000.
If you're looking for solutions you also don't start by saying Biden doesn't believe in policies he has already released or that "moderate" democrats are responsible for things the GOP did. The main thrust seems to be that we have Trump because Democrats didn't stop the GOP.
Now we know that no matter what we do it is never enough. Vote for Biden, good, but this "no excitement" talk is designed to hurt him and hurt Democrats. If you think that helps progress you're a damn fool.
Except that the Obama/Biden Administration brought the Economy back after Bush killed it. You want to explain that Donnie?
Biden has an aggressive climate change policy that he has already released. Democrats have been for "taxing the rich" my whole life! You live in a world of false conflict between moderates and progressives when the real conflict is Democrat versus Republican.
Which policies of biden's can you sell me on?
How exactly will Biden lock us up? That doesn’t even make sense.  Start prepping your resume. Come 01.21.21 you will be out of a job. I’m sure there is another lying, narcissistic buffoon who needs you to cover for them. Good luck!
I will vote for Biden at 40% than the Narcissist at 100%
Yes it does. At least for president. I get you hate Trump. But never Trump = Biden is president.
Don’t forget Biden hates “energy” too.
Ben Shapiro warns Biden 'falling apart' after bizarre interview, would be 'ripped up and down' if Republican  #FoxNews
I been trying to wrap my head around it. I severely dislike Biden. But also I'll be damned.
But Laura Ingraham said Biden was faltering in the Swing State of Iowa.
Biden doesn’t want to debate Trump because he might lose. He won’t meet the challenge and lacks character Everyday, we are in debate or conflict with each other, our work, local politics. We are expected to show-up. Is that an example for your children.
DO ALL OF U REALIZE THE MILLIONS TAXPAYERS HAVE BEEN PAYING 4 TRUMPS RE-ELECTION CAMPAIGN!  WTF IS GOING ON? WHERE IS THE LINE BETWEEN GOVT BUSINESS &amp; A VERBAL ASSAULT ON JOE BIDEN! TRUMP TALKS ABT JOE &amp; HIS ELECTION  EVERYTIME HES ON CAMERA &amp; WE PAY! WHATTA DAMN' MOOCHER HE IS!
Riden with Biden!!!!
Instead of trying to scare people with ridiculous lies about Biden. Why don't you actually tell people what you have done and what you are going to actually do for this country to get people to vote for you. Oh yeah you can't because you have done nothing and will do nothing.
Any chance that the Orange One can recite the Apostles' Creed? I bet Biden can recite it in English AND Latin.Can't wait for you to blame the storm on Biden and Harris
I will be voting in person just so there’s no excuses.When it goes 75% Biden 25% Trump,he still probably will not throw in the towel,we will probably have to burn down the White House.
I'm sure the Biden/Harris administration will find a way to bail them out without any benefit for the public. Isn't her brother-in-law the head lawyer for Uber?
I’ll start by stating this clearly: In November I’ll be voting for the Biden/Harris ticket.  Now I’ll add that: The Biden/Harris ticket disgusts me.  And: I have nothing good or positive to say about the Biden/Harris ticket.
My fucking lord CNN is trash. Three times this morning now they've asked if the Biden/Harris ticket is too far to the left.
I am so glad that Joe Biden picked Kamala Harris!!  She will make a great vice-president!!❤️
I am so happy the Joe Biden picked Kamala Harris as his running mate.  It’s about time that a strong, intelligent, woman of color be picked to serve as vice-president of the United States.  Trump supporters send your hate elsewhere, you’re going to lose in November.
Bishop Tobin excommunicates Joe Biden, apparently.
She was the best LOOKING black woman. Sounds shallow but Biden likes attractive females+he knows sex sells. America loves attractive people. Most of those people don't have a clue what's going on.
Get ready for Biden/Harris to dance on your political grave.
Tom Cotton? Tucker Carlson? Trump Jr? Mask-off Biden?
Awesome! I guess if u are a very attractive black lady u can really move up the ladder fast! Biden+company knows this of course...)
Oh, I'm sure he's voting for Biden. I didn't say I wasn't voting for him, however, he will be my LAST choice on my ranked choice voting ballot here in Maine. I know my first two choices won't garner the required votes to be viable so my vote will trickle down to Biden..
Biden as nominee and Harris as VP was decided before the primaries even started. It’s fucking depressing
Totally.  And once Trump's campaign starts rolling out Harris attack ads, Biden's going to see a drop from pulling Harris onto the ticket.  Between her terrible debate performances, and her pitiful questioning during the Kavanaugh hearings, she'll be an anchor on the ticket.
Hahahahahaahah Biden picked a cop.   My vote means little in MA but my goodness what a horrible VP pick. There’s literally clips of her calling out his racist policy on debate stage
TBH, I was rooting for Susan Rice, but Kamala was a close 2nd...in makes sense in terms of competencies, as she knows domestic policy, while Biden knows foreign policy very well. Rice has great creds in foreign policy, none in domestic, &amp; not as energizing as KH!
We need to turn out in November.  Trump will try to steal the election if it is close.   If we are lucky enough to have a Biden win, Nov 4 we fight for #MedicareForAll #tytarmy
yeah, that's what's frustrating.  The MA teachers unions are still saying they won't do it.  whatever.....Let's go Biden/Harris!!!
Wouldn't quite call Biden unbeatable at this point. They still have a lot of work to do. Fingers crossed they do it. #VPPick
Biden has made a VP pick. Hopefully we find out who it is before November. #joebidenvp
he's definitely going to replace Pence after he sees how much press Biden gets from his pick
I'd say the corporate media. They're also responsible for making Mayor Pete a thing. And making Obama, Clinton, and Biden the Dem nominees. And pushing John fucking Kasich as a moderate alternative to Trump.
Did Biden remember to bring the kids to the left of the house.
"'You better watch out if Trump is reelected': Critics warn new executive orders will 'defund' Medicare and social security | The Independent"this to the DEMOCRATS in DC STOP SPREADING LIES ABOUT TRUMP OR FACE FACT CHECK!
All he does is make ads for the Lincoln project and the Biden campaign. Every single day, several times a day....
I meant in 2016. I don't think Biden could've won then either.
Yes, Obama was also an unoffensive neoliberal, it was peak great recession, and he could've easily lost still if McCain didn't pick Sarah Palin as VP. I think Biden can win this one because we're in a similarly trainwrecky position and he's similarly inoffensive (to media elites)
Personally I'm dreading the debates. I thought Biden did terribly in the Democratic debates. He IS a gaffe machine. I think it's gonna be ugly.
Are you kidding me , you are a fool if you think any of us would vote Blue, oh you are a fool your voting for Biden
HEY, Luka is getting a little love...this play+the layup video. But not on the up+coming star list? As J.Biden always says..."come on man".
It's so hard to believe how anyone could vote Biden...really...I know people just hate Trump but "come on" we're talking about being President. What s best 4 the country. The rich celebrities+sports stars don't care. They're protected+taken care 4, 4 life. #trump2020
The economy that Trump brags about was built by Obama and Biden...TRAITOR Trump had absolutely nothing to do with building the economy...It was great when Putin put him in office..!
That hope evaporated pretty quickly. Biden will bring a sense of normalcy, but unfortunately that "normalcy" is the status quo that brought us Trump, so it's just a matter of time before the next nightmare begins in 2024....
does not have the power to do this. Taxes are supposed to be regulated by a representative Congress elected by the people. We can’t vote a constitutional menace for another four more years. Vote Joe Biden for President #Biden2020
"U.S. intel: Russia trying to hurt Biden, but China, Iran don't want Trump"
So hopefully China helps out Biden as much as Russia is helping Trump then
Never Trump = Joe Biden!!!! Why would any level headed Republican want that! If we lose the White House we are screwed for not only the next 4 yrs but i am sure it will be even longer! #VoteTrump2020
I honestly don't get WHY Rice is even in the running. As a Progressive, voting for Biden will be hard enough, although he'll be my LAST choice of my ranked choice vote here in Maine, if he picks Rice, it's going to be even harder...
LMAO. Trump is the one that won't agree. Biden has already agreed. Biden is a very good one on one debater (destroyed Bernie) and Trump is one of the worst debaters in modern history.  Awful take here. Just like most recent column about cognitive testing....awful. clear agenda.
Biden walks back African American 'diversity' remarks, lauds community's 'diversity of thought'

Ya right! Obama help Israel? Biden in his forgetful stupor forgets that:  1: Obama kept Prime Minister Netanyahu  waiting. Didn’t want to meet with him  2: Obama colluded in Israel election trying to get vote to go against Netanyahu. Obama did what he accused Russia of doing here

Well, he's white.  I don't recall any birtherism bs about HRC or Biden either.  You would think his blatant racism would be enough to vote him out, but apparently 50% or more of Americans are also racist.
Not true. Now do Biden..
Many great state-school grads!  "if he is the 1st [non-Ivy] to be elected president in ~6 decades, we expect him to grab a shovel &amp; keep on digging. Having an #education secretary who actually believes in public education would be a good place to start."
Don’t blame you.  I’d wait until Biden is sworn in to open.
I say fu Biden and your head Queen partner
I get it. No one is happy with me about it (wife included). I promised myself early on that Id vote for any candidate other than Biden or Bloomberg. I refuse to accept that we have to be basic b’s in America with a 2 party system. The dem platform just doesn’t speak to me anymore
Her words and behavior? Thats the qualifications? Ok..Now do Biden...
History is filled with great leaders making alliances with former rivals.  Woodrow Wilson picking William Jennings Bryan for Secretary of State.  JFK and Lyndon Johnson.  Eisenhower and Earl Warren.  Despots kill rivals.  Great leaders form alliances.  Biden - Harris.
Everything he’s accusing Biden of Trump is guilty of! This is beyond pathetic! What a joke!
No. He’s Biden, which is waaaaaay worse

How about you put this on your TelePrompTer! Get this through your lying brain. Biden has no brain left to get this through. He can’t even read it and get it right.
As long as the mainstream media parrots it back (you know they won’t challenge him) both Biden and Harris will continue to lie or just make stuff up.
IMO, at that stage, he can be dragged off to the side in all of his insanity and stashed away in a locked room until Biden's term begins. Nobody will care and most will be relieved.
Like Trump said. She’s a nasty woman! Tell it like it is!  I’m sure Biden thought that after her attacks on him during the Primaries!
Has America not been lied too enough by the Democrats? Wake up people!  Compare Kamala statements about Biden before and now! LIAR!  She’s called a moderate? Are you kidding me? Not one Democrat should be elected. Is it possible 50% of Americans are stupid enough to believe them?
How about you and you’re Ilk apologize to Joe and Jill Biden for the scurrilous and unfounded claims leveled at him by you and  on behalf of Tara Reade and we’ll call it even Krystal? A cold day in hell? That’s what I thought.

Biden can read and won’t eliminate intelligence briefings. He would’ve had an immediate, appropriate response to C-19. Anyone who is ok with putting their health, safety &amp; security in the hands of this incompetent Putz is just as mentally ill as he is. You’re sad.
Yes.  Historically bad.  Take a look at record, her own view of Joe Biden during the primary run...
And despite the intersectional impact of racism and sexism on Black women, they are the nation’s most reliable champions for universal rights for all groups. They are keenly aware that all forms of oppression disproportionately affect Black women;
Isn't Biden Catholic???
Don't worry, when Henry isn't posting racist stuff about Kamala, he's posting about Hunter Biden conspiracies in Ukraine.  Seems like a real straight shooter.
Yea, just like Hillary right? Why are you guys so naive. Biden isn't winning shit Its obvious they control the narrative Trump is winning by a landslide. So many people were democrats and after this whole blm antifa shit they've come out and stated they will vote for Trump.
“As a president I think trump lacks professionalism and has made a lot of mistakes but he is infinitely better than Joe Biden. “
The energy, optimism and excitement surrounding Biden picking Kamala Harris reminds me a lot of when Trump picked Pence.
And if you can’t comprehend that Tara Reade is a liar, there is no way for me to help you. It’s Biden or Trump, and any other choice helps Trump. Sorry to break it to you.
I don’t like Joe that much either, but you have two choices: Biden or Trump, and any vote NOT for Biden is a vote for Trump. You need to comprehend that. Refer to my earlier tweet about 2 party systems and FPTP voting.
Honestly, I’m not thrilled that the democratic ticket is Biden/Harris. I really wish Bernie would have been the nominee. BUT. I will happily support Biden &amp; Harris if it means getting rid of the joke we currently have in office.
You’re absolutely right. Knowing it’s the Biden/Harris ticket, it will be Trump in a landslide.
I donated to Biden-Harris
Ok, let's do this!! First Black woman and Caribbean/Asian American on a major party ticket! No matter how you feel about her, just take some time to take in this historic moment. #WOC #represent
oh goody, a cop. you really had to pick a fucking cop. good on you, Biden.
I genuinely think that this pick strengthens the ticket. It take a very niche kind of person to get pushed from Biden to Trump at this point.
Lots of fodder for the Republican Party to work with!  Does she still think Biden is a racist?
Let’s Go.
Warren would have been a better choice but I’m gonna vote for Biden no matter what. Was hoping one nice thing could happen in a maelstrom of insanity, but alas, no. Just get this year done with already...
Kamala- not good enough to be the Dems’ frontrunner. But plenty good enough to takeover when Biden is inevitably relieved of duties due to the blatant mental inadequacies? I struggle to understand why the Dems’ don’t just pick a presidential candidate to collectivey rally behind.
Like this pick - she was my top choice for President! Kamala Harris will join Joe Biden on the Democratic Party ticket as the VP nominee to defeat Donald Trump and Mike Pence in November -
Alright, BIDEN/HARRIS 2020!  #DumpTrump2020 #TrumpDepression #TrumpVirus #WeWantJoe
She could be your next president if Biden ever got elected.
What if Biden is announcing a large portion of his cabinet with the VP announcement?! That would be great!
Why Trump is unlikely to pull off an election surprise against Biden like he did with Clinton
It’s going to be a woman of color. You can guarantee that. Biden’s camp doesn’t want to be fielding questions for the next 3 months on why, out of all the qualified WOC, he decided to go with the status quo. It would be suicide.
Biden’s main consideration, all along, has been for his VP to be someone who he trusts, is ‘Simpatico’ with, and someone who could slip into the job, if needed, on day 1. Foreign policy is a main consideration for the former Foreign Relations Comittee chairman, just a thought.
I was just thinking today about when  started to enter the conversation of those being considered for VP. Early on, she was not even mentioned and then all of the sudden her name began to drop in talks. I think this was strategic on the part of the Biden campaign.
Shouldn’t it be “Confused You Know the Things for Joe Biden”
Biden Suggests Trump's Coronavirus Vaccine Won't Be Safe
I have a feeling today is the day! I’d like him to also name a few Cabinet picks, Go Team Biden!
Ahhh, so this is why the polls have gotten closer. Quality pollsters are waiting until Biden picks his VP, so we’ve only been looking at crap polls!
I plan on renewing and upping my weekly contribution to the Biden campaign through Election Day, and start donating to the DSCC through this campaign season. If we take back the White House, but not the Senate, all our hard work will have been in vain.
I never ceases to be amazed at the depths of stupidity these Trumpers can go to. Just when I thought Lysol ingestion was it, Trump went to Biden is out to hurt God, then I hear this. It makes flat earth preachers look like geniuses compared to the biker group.
Ok.    Assuming you’re right, and it’s not just something he’s saying to placate centrists, what’s another viable option?    I want to know, because I’m not so much a Biden supporter as I am a “Get Donny Out” supporter.
And what chance do those policies have of becoming reality in a Trump administration?  Wouldn’t they have a better chance of happening under Biden?
How will our aims be achieved with a second Trump administration?     If we gain control of Congress to pass M4A (for example) could you honestly see it being vetoed by Biden?
Even Robin Williams was on to Biden. #Trump2020 #MAGA2020

You're unbelievably foolish comment about impeaching Joe Biden shows just how corrupt the current Republican party is. Also,  just stupid.  I mean you're intelligent yet you have to do this play acting as an anti-intellectual and to say stupid s*** to fit in.
I don’t understand.  How does attacking Biden help in removing Trump from office?    Isn’t that the immediate goal?
Yeah...  watch 11:15-12:24. Still voting for Biden no matter who he picks, but this is not my favorite take on police reform and allocation of funding.
In keeping with new Washington tradition, The Biden Running Mate.

How did Susan rice do in the primaries..what we know, we are here cause everyone not named Biden lost.
I think Biden brought her to Delaware and is building up her name in order to help her in Michigan and for future endeavors. The actual choice has probably already been made, and kept very much under wraps. It’ll be a WOC, and deservedly so.
Joe biden said "She can have any role she wants".... then he's gon do this to her?
This is true. But remember how Trump got the nomination, with 35% of the Republican vote. If the moderates can coalesce around a ‘Biden’ like the D’a did around Bernie’s leftism, they can beat back another Trumpist.
1. There is no way he wrote this "apology." 2. There is no way he remembers what he said even 5 minutes ago. 3. There is a pattern of Biden's gross, racist statements.
Like Biden or Killary?

Key factor is joe Biden has lost it.  Doesn’t know where he is half the time.  Lol
You won’t realize anything because they’ll be starting bad-faith attacks on Biden as soon as he’s declared the winner, led by the disingenuous Never Trumpers who may be worse than MAGAs themselves
China, Russia, Iran and God knows who else, don’t want Trump to win because he plays hardball!  Biden would wimp out and keep feathering his nest especially with China. POLICIES OF THE LEFT WOULD SHAFT OUR WORKERS!
What a sharp guy our President is. Love that he won’t take crap from anyone!  is going to rip Biden apart in the debates! Check Biden for “Hearing Aids”  WATCH: Trump Wrecks Reporter Who Complains About Crowd Size at Press Conference
Notice. Joe Biden’s team is constantly having to clean up over all his gaffs.   As President Biden would put China first and US Workers last. Must re-elect Trump or we are finished and will be living under tyranny.
My 2 republican uncles and aunt who are tired of Trump told me last week that they would vote for Biden if he picked harris. Would write in someone else if he picked rice. They think rice is hillary part 2 and  that she lied about benghazi...Shes too hawkish. ..
Remember Marine Corps (pronounced Corpse by Obama?  Not to mention countless gaffes by his Vice President.  We know why Biden does it though and it’s just sad.  Maybe Queen Botox prays for him nightly because she’s such a good Catholic.
Idk ab y’all but I don’t think just voting for Biden to “just get trump out” is smart. We shouldn’t be voting like that
You are all racists  Joe Biden is goin to win in November ... 2nd place!
Getting ready for the left if Biden  gets elected and his pukes try to come for us!
To the Biden Campaign: If you support what God says is sin then you are against God.   Duh!
I had those very thoughts. How you think so do you write. No way Biden wrote the explanation.   So as he speaks, so will he write. Birripbirripbirrip, “that’s all folks.”  For those of you who weren’t around, look up Porky Pig! 😂
He isn’t talking about the culture , but political views , he didn’t say all black people are the same Hence “notable exceptions”  This is what Trump wants you guys to believe smh hear Biden’s statement
It's just incredibly sad that right-wing nut jobs are using #Extortion17 in a bullshit attack on Biden.  Those soldiers deserve better.
If #Biden could take down that bad dude #CornPop you damn well know he can “hurt god.” I’m voting #Libertarian but - Maybe we need a #POTUS who can knock out that crazy old wizard in the sky. #Thighland #badgrandpa
That would leave Pence (who worries me greatly). I'd really like to see trump humiliated and emasculated with a resounding Biden victory. We will pay a very heavy price daily with trump in office....sigh.
Sources say Biden made his choice, tonight. I hope for a big Friday night announcement!
I don’t think it’ll be Whitmer. Biden doesn’t want African Americans, the left, and the media totally distracting the campaign with the ‘why didn’t you feel it necessary to pick a WOC’ question, especially with the BLM movement coming to the forefront this campaign season.
And y'all still wanna come for Trump lol. Good job Biden. #BidenIsARacist
A whole load of nonsense, as usual. No plan, no concept, no bloody idea about anything. I am so frickin tired of the rambling. I’m breathless.
Beware these Never Trumpers. Just want our help to get rid of Trump for them, but the second Biden’s in office they’ll be attacking him with garbage. Goal is 22 midterms. Don’t trust them for a second, they created the environment for Trump to swoop in.
County Illinois. Never before now, NEVER, has winning the election been more important than anything else. My goal is to choose the person who will get votes, and help Biden defeat this fascist monster. Thus, my three points.
These Never Trumper ghouls just want the D’s to get rid of Trump for them, &amp; the second Biden’s in office they go back on the attack full throttle to take back the House &amp; Senate in 22. It’s so disingenuous.

I think it was in this same interview, the reporter asked if he’d take a cognitive test to show that he doesn’t have dementia or anything and Biden legit asked if the reporter was a crack head
I’d like it on the record that I’m in favor of hurting god. I’m not sure if this is even possible or even if they even exist.   That being said   I know Joe Biden is not in favor of hurting god, but I would just like Twitter to know MY position on the matter.
Should decline or halt should Biden wins..Trump could've had a good news day with the Mid-East deal, but he just couldn't stop insulting women. AOC, Kamala, Mika, Nancie. I doubt Trump negotiated the deal.  Sure he probably told Pompeo to "go do this for me" but fact is UAE and Isreal got it done for themselves. #biden
If something happens to Biden.. We will descend on Washington... Both Biden and Harris need to be protected like Fort Knox! Trump isn’t above anything..
Bill Gates is a pedo..Joe Biden is a pedo
What can’t be lost in this moment is that Hillary Clinton was attacked every day by Trump.. She proved herself an amazing warrior.. Because of Hillary, Kamala is and the Biden Campaign are offensively equipped! Thank you Secretary Clinton!
Have you met Biden’s running mate or are you aware of the man who chose Biden to be his running mate? Let’s have some fun, for every 1% over 59% of the Black vote Biden gets you donate $100.00 to BLM and every 1% under 59% I’ll donate $100.00 to the Proud Boys.  Deal?
Biden leans right, unfortunately. The Biden of TODAY (emphasis on "today") would have been a Republican 30-40 years ago. Anyone who thinks he's left has no sense of direction..... I'll reluctantly vote for him.....
That means Biden made an excellent choice. Yahoo!
Joe Biden selects California Sen. Kamala Harris as running mate

This needs to end w/ Fauci, Birx, Gates, Soros, Barry Otero, Michael LaVaughn Robinson, The Clinton’s, The Biden’s and many others in jail 🚂🇺🇸🚂🇺🇸🚂🇺🇸
So even if #POTUS Trump upsets Biden in a Democrat leaning state with more statewide votes at final count (which is very possible; especially if the Biden Island rumor goes public) the electoral team in that state will fudge the #’s and award the state electoral count to Biden?
Good luck sycophant.  Biden will take care of all that.
I don't care if biden selects a festering pile of $hit. I'm still voting for him.
I’m sorry, at this point, if someone is trying to run as a third or more candidate for president THIS year, they are a colossal, self-centered  dick, who cares nothing about this Country. This year, every single person who isn’t for Trump, needs to climb the eff behind Biden!
Forget about Trump’s lack of religion for a second and focus on the absurdity of his argument.  For his supporters to agree with him, they have to admit that Joe Biden is more powerful than God in order to be able to hurt God.  To do so is to admit God isn’t omnipotent.  Apostasy
Obviously Trump thinks differently than you do.  He actually thinks Biden possesses the cognitive ability to hurt  God.  Given that God is omnipotent, Biden must possess incredible acumen in order to devise a plan to hurt God and to hurt the Bible.  Ergo, I’ve gotta vote for him.
Enumerating Trump's lies would take days, so let me ask you a simple question. Today Trump said that Biden will hurt the Bible and will hurt God if elected.  If Biden is in mental decline, how can he hurt the Bible (?), and how can he hurt God?  Is God that weak or that gullible?
If God is omnipotent and Biden can hurt God, what does that make Biden?  Are there varying levels of omnipotence?Team Biden was probably even worried Bailey would outshine Major.
So I saw a "United for Biden" campaign sign near my street today, I think I'm going to keep my body armor near my bed now...
"The Room Where It Happened" and "Stay Alive" and "History Has It's Eyes On You" and "Right Hand Man" (just replace Washington with Biden and Hamilton with Kamala Harris).
A vote for Biden may save your life!
Joe Biden had eight years under Obama to build back better. What did he do,  nothing. They said that it would take a magic wand to bring back job's and the economy. Well it takes a person who understands how business works and that was Trump. Who do you trust .
Vote for Biden. This administration is totally corrupt and there is no bottom. If you love your freedom then you need to defend the constitution and vote BLUE!
LMAO you saw him on tv for all of 30 seconds bike riding. I can't believe you actually think Biden's got a chance to win.
The evidence of a very big conflict of interest in Joe Biden having Giuliani fired when Giuliani is looking in to corruption his son is working for and getting paid $50 thousand a month. As if that isn't the definition of quid pro quo.
Did Joe Biden say on national TV when he was VP that if Ukraine doesn't fire the Giuliani he was going to withhold a billion $ in aid? Yes he did. Was Giuliani looking in to corruption in Burisma? Yes he was. Was Hunter on the Board of Burisma? Yes he was.

Biden’s Mask Mandate Is a Ploy to Keep Him in the Basement
There was no way NOT to have COVID deaths. Trump kept them as low as possible even in the face of those who wanted him not to prohibit flights from China in the beginning. Biden and others called him a bigot for doing so. #trump2020.
Biden,  Kamala Harris better start looking for another running mate because the Federal government is about to send indictments to the Obama administration including Joe Biden for the illegal activities that were made trying to get Hillary Clinton elected.  #KAG VOTE4TRUMP
Chairman Biden and emperor's Harris will be right at home with the CCP.They've already started using some of the policies of Chairman Mao Zedong. Next thing they'll have the gov. to start distribution of quotations from Chairman Mao Zedongs little Red Book . We're in for it
FYI Joe Biden does things to help his son's investments like telling Ukraine to fire the lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani that was looking in to Burisma and their dirty dealing. Hunter was on the board of Burisma. Talk about quid pro quo.
the FBI  attorney that falsified documents to spy on Trump is making a deal with the Fed's in order to get a lesser sentence.  A "chain" is only as strong as its weakest link. If I was Obama-Biden I would start looking for a good attorney because you'll need one.
Yes voter disenfranchisement is a problem. However the reason people don't vote is because they think both parties are the "same" which is a lie meant to suppress young people from voting. If a young person can't tell the difference between Biden and Trump then the lie worked.
Americans will be imprisoned or fined for failure to comply with face protection. While murder, looters rob private businesses,  Biden-Hariri are showing no concern for the anarchy.  But defunding the police and saying, be tough on crime, these two are in conflict
I didn't support Biden but now that he is nominee I do... If Markey was running against Trump I would wholeheartedly support Ed.
Kamala is not going to be the reason Biden wins or loses.  comes down to Covid  Dems and Repubs have monetized Covid 19; why would Big Corporations want to give up that funding?
If only our fantasy league got as much attention from you as Biden and Fabolous do...
Biden said the travel ban was xenophobic and he wouldn’t have closed the borders. Democrats advocated large crowds for Chinese New Year, they still advocate for large crowds and rioting? How would you have prevented it? Locking it up for marijuana possession?
We can’t have it both ways. We can’t say Biden can’t remember his own name AND plagiarized something from 30 years ago. He isn’t writing his speeches or they’d read “C’mon man! This is um um um how the hell did I get p-p-pudding in my knig-nig-knickers?! K-K-K-Kamala man!”
POV: You are a white haired former child solid named Raiden, real name Jack. You just killed your adopted father, Solidus Snake. As well as forgiving your girlfriend Rose who's the reason you got into this whole mess.  Now Joe Biden is trying to give you an ice cream as a treat.

Susan Rice made the most sense for Biden’s VP Pick, but my money says Susan Rice is one of the names that’s going to be torched by Durham and they didn’t want the controversy. Obviously I don’t KNOW that, but I truly believe she will be scapegoated.
They've already started.  I've read that she can't be president many times on here in the short time since Biden picked her for VP....it's pathetic.  Same thing they did to Obama
Could anyone get sucked off this good?! I was waiting for the money shot. 🤦🏽‍♂️ Is this what we have to look forward to? This R the type of questions asked of Biden or Harris? When it comes to Trump the media wants to bare knuckle brawl. What happened to journalism?

What do you Hannity groupies think is behind his recent, obviously conscious, decision to refer to Biden and Obama by their first names -- and now Harris. Just really peculiar. Any theories?
I didn't listen to your dang cause I assumed it wasn't about me. Lol I mean I hate Joe Biden and Kamala Harris but I don't think Bernie's a sell out he's doing what he believes is right just as I am voting for those assholes.
Can someone please shut up  ? She’s bat shit crazy
This is like kind of unacceptable. Have you lived through the same last 3.5 years I have? If you have then I ask... ARE YOU KIDDING ME?!?  Anything other than a vote for Biden is a vote for Trump. Get it together.
The only thing you said that is true is 150,000 people have died which is pretty aweful but would have been at least double thay number if Trump hadn’t have stopped flights in from China in late January which, btw, Biden called, wait for it... racist!
I think if Biden gets Ohio &amp; GA he got ME-2.
Biden,  Harris  soon will be advocating incarceration and fines for failure to conform  with society. They were worried that Trump would be dictating as he sat in the OVAL office. But it turns out that its been the democrats all along. Its up to us to stop them
Biden,  asked America for a national mask wearing. But while requesting this they weren't wearing a mask. Hypocrisy coming from hypocrites
The existence of the electoral college makes all the voting discourse hilarious to me. Biden is winning my state regardless of what I do.
That’s about all Joe Biden’s brain can do is generate enough power to make them go three steps
Woah you are not about to say that when Joe Biden's campaign is literally vote for me because I'm not Trump. Like my fucking God the irony. I'm voting for that piece of shit but you guys need to stop acting like he isn't shit and is god's gift to Progressives and the left
Oh how quickly people forget, in 2008 this Country was a total mess and Obama and Biden came into a mess. They fixed General Motors, Wall Street, housing mortgage problems. They got us out of a disaster that once again the Republicans got us into. Kamala did much for CA
That’s a big fat lie and you know it. Never did She ever accused Biden of such things!
I can’t wait to see you campaigning. I see the Smiling side of you and it’s Sweet, now I want to see The Stern side as we elect the Biden Harris Presidency. (Put your seat belt on)
If Bernie and Warren are at fault for anything, it was not having a plan pre-primary for how to still unify when things inevitably get tough and heated, or when one of them has a heart attack while the other just passed Biden in the polls in the same week.
Thing I’ve been telling myself to deal with the fact there was every logical reason to pick Warren: A Biden to Warren admin would never be the Warren presidency she or we wanted bc she wouldn’t have the mandate of being elected on her own platform. She’s free to be herself.
, no matter how she got to the top, some say that she had affairs with her boss. That's up for debate. But the fact that she's here is a threat to the way of life as we know it if Joe Biden gets elected. Higher taxes, open borders, and everything else. #KAG
Apparently they also want to tear down the Empire State building. A dastardly duo.
It collapsed already Biden &amp; Harris will rebuild America... The damage you have done resembles an earthquake...
idk now i ain’t realize this dweeb was biden’s running mate
So now because Biden picked Harris.  the unemployment rate must have dissolved all these people are getting kicked out of their homes must still have their homes. Just don't think that is the most important thing facing our country. Congress get back to work.
Wait a minute, are you implying you don’t think old white men should be running the country and in order to stand up against old white men running the country you’re going to vote for Biden? An old... white... man...? Slow clap

People wonder about this country’s shortcomings. Then I see videos of people crying about Kamala Harris being chosen as Biden’s VP. They obviously don’t know about her record as a senator, much less anything before that. So being a female is more important than her achievements.
The GOP is pushing for Kanye west to be registered in a swing state to siphon off votes from the Biden campgain causing trump to have a win and a potential Biden state
Kamala Harris never called a biden a racist. In fact she specifically remarked at a presidential debate “I do not believe you are a racist” after she addressed his opposition to busing in the 70s.
Harris said she believed 3 women (not Reade) who claim Biden inappropriately touched or kissed them. It does not fall under the legal definition of sexual misconduct, however I do believe it’s inappropriate. Trump thinks it’s ok to grab women by “the pussy”.
"Biden and Harris remember Beau Biden in their first remarks together as running mates"
Here is actual data of the effect the Crime Law has on incarcerations. The drastic increase was due to state laws, not Biden’s law.
4. Biden wrote the Violence Against Women Law which imposes harsher penalties for domestic violence and rape offenders., the 10yr Assault Weapon Law, and the “Safety-Valve” the relieved some inmates from the mandatory 3 strikes provision.
1. The Crime Bill is a federal statute &amp; cannot be enforced at state level. Only a few states actually adopted harsher penalties. 95% of inmates are in state prisons, not federal. 2. Biden opposed the 3 three strike mandatory life sentence in 94 &amp; now.
If Joe Biden is elected will God need to get Secret Service protection?

A whole speech and not one mention of bleach, I don’t think Biden can pull this off

Tune in to Biden/Harris on MSNBC and watch how a REAL President acts.
You missed the point. I’m not defending Trump, I’m implying you’re a hypocrite. Biden may not have as many accusations, but he has them too. My money says you’ll have no problem voting for Biden though, which makes you a hypocrite.
Wow, Biden is boring and Trump is destroying Biden in followers.  Good to know. Biden is second in another category.
Let's skip the debate with presidential candidates because you're worried people might figure out Biden is deranged.  I'm not a Trump fan and I can tell you don't want a debat because Trump would eviscerated Biden.  Just come out of your echo chamber and admit you lost already.

For how stupid the Biden campaign is, I actually totally believe it. Though if Biden has stronger convictions he wouldn’t let a gaffe get in the way of course of going for substantive change.
So we lost having an eventual president that believes in single payer, a wealth tax, student debt cancellation and an overhaul of Washington corruption and Wall St because Biden made another stupid gaffe. Big structural wtf.

If Joe Biden becomes president then Hillary Clinton will call in a suicide strike on Joe Biden. I can see it now, it will be labeled as an overdose that was brought on by dementia and just for good measure he will have shot himself 3 times in the back of the head.

Jim Polito Daily Poll: How will Kamala Harris impact the Biden campaign?
Trump clearly has dementia. He can't complete a sentence. Biden does not have dementia and has served in the senate and as VP with no problems. You are delusional if you think tRump and his adolescent tactics are going to work this time around. He's losing his base.
Innocent thought? There’s nothing innocent about hiding the DNC elected leader has full blown dementia. If they cared about the country they’d pick a different candidate. Biden the politician is dead and Trump’s the coroner who will call his TOD. Just like he did with US politics
Does this guy even know that his dislike for President Trump and voting for Biden will lead to the socialization and open borders of our Country? I remember when he used to be a solid conservative as a congressman.  #FoxNews
You must feel so dirty when you tweet about Joe Biden knowing that he has dementia and he’s a pedophile. If I were you I would start praying for absolution now.
Biden stands a decent chance of winning now that he's kissed the ring on the k-hive. Which is great for me because now he DEFINITELY doesn't need my vote! I can write in Yang or cast it for Howie Hawkins without losing any sleep. Honestly this shit was over for me months ago.
It wasn’t because she was being courteous or whatever to Warren, that was some bs. Biden had it in the can and she was just playing the field as she does.
If Biden didn’t have the courage to stand up to Wall St and make her VP he won’t have it to make her secretary of treasury.

Yea he's quick, and aggressive. I get not liking what comes out of his mouth but Biden can't run on the fly. There were moments in the primary debates where Biden just took punches and didn't respond. I wouldn't debate him if I was Biden. Let Trump's Twitter ruin him.

Wow. Nice pick Joe.
I'd be tweeting more about Harris, but for the #mapoli Chernobyl we're living through, except to say politically Biden won't lose votes with Harris, which is frankly the only consideration. Nobody would gain him more. Harris will be fine.
Harris, now the American people will hear why the both of you haven't condemned the violence that's plagues all the major cities. Not one democratic leader has spoken up against the violence.  WE'LL SEE AND HEAR YOU ABOUT THE VIOLENCE

Joe "Shoot 'em in the legs" Biden &amp; Off. Kamala Harris. Of course. Totally on-brand.
I cried I was so happy!! Biden/Harris 2020 Unbeatable!!
So does this mean Biden made Mayor Pete fly all the way out to Delaware to tell him he didn’t get the job?
I don't think Biden will do well with Trump on stage. He can only hold so much information in his head before he jumbles the words together.
It was my dream ticket back when she was still on the debate stage attacking Biden. She has the federal experience, was AG of California, US Senator. She's young and strong. Biden had the burden of picking a running mate and possibly the future president.
"Joe Biden selects Senator Kamala Harris to be his vice presidential running mate"
I truly don’t know who Biden could’ve picked for VP to strengthen his case but I would prob guess Sanders due to the ideas and following he’d bring. But picking the “token black person” despite recognizing she been against her own people her whole career is so misguided
Sen.  is just the third woman — and first African American — to be nominated for vice president by a major political party.
Yes Dr. Biden!!
Now that is Slow Biden has picked his running mate Kabbalah Harris, we will now see all of the trash about her coming out and how much of a terrible prosecutor she was, but Joe can’t remember all of that he’s lucky if he can remember how to tie his shoes.
The quicker people realize that Dems and Reps are the same people with different names, the quicker we’d make progress lol. I knew they didn’t care about Trump being re-elected as soon as they strong-armed the primaries towards Biden
They should just flip the ticket and have Kamala be president and Biden be VP
Dump the whole US into a bag of rice.. Biden chose Kamala Harris as her running mate for this years elections.....
Will the debate between Harris and Pence be more anticipated than the ones between Biden and Trump?
If Biden couldn’t get any worse as a candidate.... he picks Kamala Harris as VP 🤢
Didn't Kamala Harris have a go at Joe Biden re the bussing?
Welp, I still think Biden is garbage but he picked the best VP possible out of the rumored names

Don't get me wrong I'm voting for Biden but this is still hella funny
Remember That Time Biden Blatantly Lied About Law School?  via
Biden can’t handle anything and likely whoever is VP will take over as president at some point. If Biden has any strength it’s already foreign policy so I don’t see what Rice brings to the ticket. What sells right now is the economy, healthcare, climate change, student debt, etc
She thinks Hillary is going to be charged with a crime next month. Must be rough, being a day drunk, Pam! But don’t worry, we’re all voting soon, and a President Biden will be a good and decent president. Unlike the POS there now.
Baffling that Biden and son are being criminally investigated in Ukraine as we speak, and yet not a sole in the media talks about it. They are still trying to tell us that the Russian hoax is still real as if it were not already deemed false.
Biden wasn’t there.
Russia is the one interfering in our elections, not China or Iran. Both of the latter just 'prefer' that Biden wins. Putin is helping Trump win.
Let’s see 2020 Biden do that 😂😂😂😂
Meanwhile they would have had to wake Biden up. Dunce.

It's a nut-fest, to be sure. Trump fooled me for the hottest minute -- but my mail-in vote in BIden/Warren for sure
I saw #RIPKamala trending and I thought Biden had finally chosen Warren as his running mate.
Yeah that's what I was alluding to too. It's not just about Morning Joe promoting Biden while not showing Warren's speech after Iowa, it's about Fox News controlling the right and all of corporate media following along with the circus.
Of course China would prefer Biden so where is Hunter can get a job back
If the ticket is Biden/Harris my only thoughts will be that MSNBC picked the entire ticket themselves and until we defeat the disease that is cable news propaganda this country will never pull itself out of the status quo.

Biden,  the American people have seen What President Trump has done concerning the economy. Don't we want Him Steering the economy back on course, instead of someone who has never been or has done what couldn't be done. If it wasn't for this virus  we'd be on all cylinders.
Awesome ad...Perfectly sums up the reasons,as a Republican, I’m voting for Joe Biden. This country can not sustain another 4 years of Trump.
The point is when he loses people have to pay back those taxes under a Biden administration and he will say I told you Biden would raise your taxes when it was his doing in the first place.
Why are Obama and Biden being silent they should attack him for lying while at the same time thanking him for supporting the ACA and the Veterans bill.
I think i watched enough of Biden, poor man i don’t think he knew where he was, talking gibberish &amp; forgetting his words!!! Blimey!!!!😂🌿
Bernie could have gotten behind Warren when she had surpassed Biden (which Bernie never managed to do) and had a heart attack at the same time. Instead he fought back for nothing.
Even if Warren had dropped earlier Bernie still wouldn’t have won because the majority of her supporters that Bernie hadn’t already peeled off from her didn’t have Bernie as a 2nd choice. At that point she was taking more votes from Biden. Move the fuck on.

But I’ll take higher debt and keep my guns and religion and not murder babies so Biden who claims to be catholic (a religion that notorious for pedaphiles and gangsters) and  is pro choice so yah I can see where Trump might make that assumption

Any vote other than Biden is dooming our country- you said it yourself. It literally DOES NOT MATTER who his VP pick is (unless it's Kayne)- anyone, literally anyone, would be better than Trump if it came to their leadership of the country.
Versus Trump America? I’ll take Biden
Hell of a lot worse than saying "I mean, you got the first mainstream African-American who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice-looking guy. I mean, that's a storybook, man." Biden said this about Obama, imagine if Trump said something like this.

Prediction . . .   Biden suffers a stroke or something that will prevent him from accepting the formal nomination. Kamala will solemnly accept the nomination.  Of course, this is all scripted.
Well, I guess we will have to watch where they are spending. I think they have committed ~$280M to ad buys. But a lot of that money could be focused on retaining the house, not so much promoting Biden. I sure haven't seen too many Biden signs or bumperstickers, that's for sure.

Totally. But yes, exactly about the shortlist. This is Biden, who no one (I know) has high expectations of. Why would our expectations of who his VP pick be so high? I was just relieved it wasn’t Whitmer, who likely would have lost him MI because she has turned her back on Flint.

No...the Texas Democrats are going to be pissed because they're working their asses off. Can I ask WTF you problem is here? Beto has been on every damn station speaking up for Biden. Candidates aren't necessarily the same as the DNC.
Coffin Joe would also be a good nickname for Joe Biden.

Insanity is:  Joe Biden is actually running for president and people think its all good.  We live in a very sick country and if the haters have their way, we are finished.
They really seem to have thought they were going to run against Bernie and whoever he chose as VP and they couldn't figure out how to retune for Biden.
Would you vote for Trump or Biden? Reason 3rs
It’s very painful &amp; has been extremely depressing to watch I think Bernie’s whole thinking is Trump is way worse &amp; doesn’t want any blame,he’s said from day 1 he would support the nom But everyone else just lalaing not fighting or pushing Biden on anything really pisses one off
Where is the immigration rhetoric?! Where are Hillary’s Benghazi?!? You played Biden’s  Burisma ties prematurely and idiotically and ended up impeached for your trouble! The pandemic wiped away your economy achievements, and it even brought your Obama vendetta back to haunt you!
Your absolutely right we would be looking at twice the amount of deaths. As Biden thought it was a bad idea to restrict flights in to the United States.

Same old thoughtless regurgitation of old talking points. Speak of "privilege" to an Anti-war voter? Smh  A Biden Foreign Policy ala Iraq, Libya, Syria, Honduras (already has eyes on forcibly returning Venezuela to the Petrodollar) will hurt far more people than both Trump terms.
Biden was installed as nominee specifically to keep Americans from getting healthcare and other such humane reforms. Imagine what kind of sellout creep you have to be to facilitate that.
Is it the Donald Trump or the mother fucking Americans who voted for him .He don't give a f about me &amp; you .He only cares about him &amp; his ratings .Americans should wake up now &amp; Vote for Biden/ Harris coalitions..

We have nothing to fear, but fear itself. This nonsense should spurn more resolve, and  stronger solidarity. We must first donate to The Biden Harris ticket with time, and dollars, then encourage the undecided to vote, and vote Blue! The future is now.
Okay. A: At his age, Biden can be forgiven for his mind defaulting to 1917 when using the ‘17 shorthand (likely more Freudian than anything), and B: Any fast talker, myself included, can tell you slurring your words is quite common when talking at certain speeds.
Um...Bernie is older than Biden.
I've already found a DC-area crash pad so nobody can claim I'm a vagrant. I'll be standing in front of the Capitol all day, every day, until President Biden is installed -- alone, if I'm alone there.
Steve it must have been a lot of calls, for a big Biden supporter like yourself, who is telling other people to do activism. Just let us plebes know how many calls you made so I have something to aspire to.
Biden Reaffirms His Hatred Of Medicare For All  via
That's when private prisons started, but it's not when incarceration skyrocketed.  That didn't happen until the 90's.  All of this is publicly available information.  Here's what Biden was doing during the Reagan years:
How are people planning to “hold Biden/Harris accountable”? Second question: how are people currently holding Trump accountable? And how’s that working out?
WE WILL!!!! I will be voting IN PERSON for Biden/Harris on November 3rd! I don’t care if I have to put on a hazmat suit and crawl through broken glass.
He did do a war on drugs thing...which was heavily pushed by your guy, Joe Biden.  Seriously.  You should look some of these things up.  Google can be your friend.
Fortunately Biden then advanced beyond 3rd grade, whereas trump's thought process and reading level never matured beyond primary grades.
Joe Biden came out yesterday making a proposal for a nationwide mask mandate. VP pick Kamala Harris came out to speak after saying "That's what real leadership looks like!". Is it? VB takes aim with this &amp; hears yours thoughts.   LISTEN:   #vbinthemiddle
Every one of the production assistants will be masked ??? Joe Biden insists
The one who wrote the '94 tough on crime bill?  Yes, he's responsible for the current prison industrial complex.  Look at incarceration rates before and after Biden's signature bill.  Democrats have been 'tough on crime' since the '90s.  Where have you been?
I would recommend your looking at  feed for plenty of articles about allegations against Joe Biden.  Regarding corruption, he's got 50 years of representing corporations in Congress.  There are plenty of articles like this one.
Obama and Biden looted SS years ago. Joe doesn’t remember that tho!
And that "strong woman" said her questioning him was political theater.  That's not strength.  Your VP is an authoritarian who has exploited the prison industrial complex that Biden helped establish.  She's trash.
He's probably one of the people who is flying with the Trump line that "if Biden gets elected, the stock market will crash". He's wrong tho, because even if trump doesn't manage to fix it, he won't leave. He's checking who in the military is loyal to him rn.
Good a better economy for Biden
“Trump’s view...was that Biden would prefer a candidate with Bass’s low national profile and one who wouldn’t outshine him.”  He's such a fucking narcissist he cannot imagine others thinking differently from himself.  via
Agreed.  If Tulsi and Yang cared about policy and being anti-corruption, then they would have endorsed Bernie.  Instead they both showed they don’t really care about the issues and backed Biden before Bernie dropped out.
Biden's healthcare plan is calling us fat individually
Yeah well, it happened in 2009.  Don’t believe everything Bernie and Biden spew for political points
Or put on your hazmat suit and show up in person.   It will be MUCH easier for them to game the count when there is no visible presence at the polls with Biden/Harris pins on their chests.
“Mike Pence Says He's Not Going To Let Biden And Harris 'Cut America's Meat'”  😂😂😂
Biden is going back to the suburbs to save your loveless marriage with a person who cheats on you. Trump is your physically abusive spouse who is addicted to Vicodin from a work injury he sustained 20 years ago and for which he blames the union.
“It doesn’t have to snowball,” said  “...But if the president is saying, ‘Stop. I think I won, where did these blue shift ballots come from?’ You could have this dispute spin out of control.”
We want all charges made to Trump and cronies when Biden in office so that they can’t be pardoned
How many times did you visit Epstein’s Fuck island Jim? How about the island next to it? That’s owned by Joe Biden.
You’re very presumptive , I’m choosing anyone but Biden , just like your mentality seems anyone but trump (you’re supporting a geriatric) ,I would prefer if  ran , then your head would really pop off ... as a Democrat think back to JFK speech and stop wanting handouts
Ok. You convinced me. I am going to vote for Biden/Harris
Biden’s numbers are better than those in those states. Wow the pressure is really getting to you to hedge and just never be able to be proved wrong ever.
Great propaganda , as a union member we were at 100% employment and busier than ever , not a video , I lived it.  I enjoy not paying 60% tax as proposed by Biden , and I like a candidate that doesn’t bail Antifa terrorists out of jail.
This is really a coup and has to be stopped. Does anyone out there have any way to stop this? What about Biden, Harris &amp; Democratic leadership? Are they planning their own legal actions and strategies to fight this assault on our electoral system and democracy?
Biden is already to the right of Romney and Bush on several issues, so...
Of course he did. He's afraid to go to jail if he loses his Presidency (refer to the Articles of Impeachment earlier this year). Vote Biden or else we can see a dictatorship in the near future.
Court documents seem to suggest that the idea to charge Flynn with violations of the Logan Act may have come from Joe Biden. That probably will not be good news for Biden’s 2020 campaign.
I mean I had hoped you say you stopped a little.   It's gonna be weird for your pride when the Harry Potter Warren people prevent more people from getting pushed into unmarked vans than you by electing Biden.
Comma-La, what is it like to play nursemaid to Old Joe Biden &amp; refrain him from racist outbursts?
Each state that has Cares Act surplus dollars from the bill can institute this process and short order and deficit spending will be reimbursed under the Biden Administration...Short term borrowing at very low interest rates now for 90 to 120 days.
Just like Killary you and your dad will not buy this election either. Sick of the Soros/ Clinton/Biden/Obama crime families f*cking with our country.  Ya heels up ain’t becoming VP either
It's really nice of Biden to give the guy who will run against him in 2024 a chance to launch his campaign. #Kasich
Tensions linger between Biden and Obama camps throughout 2020 primary campaign: report  #FoxNews
Oh you silly rabbits, only Republicans have mandates according to the national press corps almost all of which are employees of large corporations with large corporate interests. Biden could win by an historic landslide &amp; still be considered on shaky ground.
Your reminder that Joe Biden will be the only Presidential candidate this year to have corresponded with Hannah Arendt:
We'd have seen even more of this in the primary if COVID-19 hadn't gifted the nomination to Biden.
I agree and cannot believe how many people discount Biden's staying power. Given what he has been through personally (like, really, it should make everyone stop in their tracks) I can't help but be in awe of his  resilience.
Malcolm, you need to be back in public service. What position would you accept in a Biden/Harris administration?
Here's how the 2020 presidential election could come down to state lawmakers, according to
If you want evil to win..  Vote for Biden.  Very simple decision this year
I think right now all Democratic governors are megalomaniac. Weather it's      they are all tin-pot dictators with one common goal to make our lives miserable in hopes that will vote for Joe Biden.
Liberal media outlets push "Yo Biden is super boring" in 5... 4... 3... oh oops, It's happening again already.
well Biden’s word play makes him sound stupid 🤣
Yes, both Biden/Harris are big supporters of late term baby killing.
Who do you think supported Bernie? They seemed like mostly Warren folks. Their frustration w Biden was largely his hiding from the media and refusing to do an interview with them despite the fact that they worked together.
Looks like the postal service is in the bag for Biden! Screw mail in ballots, go in person wear a mask, and show an identification. We can go to the liquor store, Walmart, Home Depot, and the Post Office. You certainly can go to the ballot box on November 3rd.
Biden Clinton and Obama all support the war in iraq
Tbh she’s gonna get dragged for being so outspoken about sexual assault and Biden’s been accused of that... that’s my main thing
Someone keep the receipt ITT for our proof of collective voter voicesBiden- Harris! Let’s go!
Just in
NY Police Union..Are you sure on Trumps Endorsement?? He's under Criminal investigation by Manhattan DA Cy Vance..Big mistake!
Breaking tonight..
Hi Kamala!  This story broke tonight..please tell Joe!
YOU GOTTA DO THIS STORY..JUST BROKE TONIGHT.. USPS CARRIERS ENDORSE JOE BIDEN 300,000 VOTES..
I’m attending 2020 Victory’s event, “South Shore Young Democrats - Joe Biden Convention Nomination Virtual Watch Party - Day 4” – sign up now to join me!
#LoserInChief  #BidenHarris2020 is coming for you! All your distractions &amp; lies won’t help! Can’t wait to see Biden kick your ass in the debate! 👏
Kyrsten Sinema, Gretchen Whitmer, Joe Biden...
Evening Mary..Take a looknatvthis story..USPS letter carriers just gave Joe Biden 300,000 votes!😀😀
my mom said I could go to my friend’s baby shower! so now I’ve gotta think of advice to write down but since I’m not a mom all I can think of is “don’t have kids” or “vote for biden so maybe the pandemic ends here someday and your kid can go to daycare/school”
Fucking bite on this idiots.. Paybacks are a bitch..You fuck over the USPS.. Your gonna pay now..  USPS workers union endorses Biden, citing threat to postal service "survival"
Biden is an incompetent idiot who's not even fit to be a door greeter bc he would grope,grab or sexually assault women&amp;children. He's plagiarized other ppl's speeches&amp;writings. He's mentally unfit,period!! Insults Black ppl&amp;even called them N**gg**s!!
How can anyone possibly compare these two situations. To quote joe biden ( come on man )
Biden spews Muslim quotes&amp;totally takes them out of context,why? Because someone(Dem) told him what to say to gain favor with the Muslim community,stop listening to Dems they will get us all killed/in a war.
There wasn’t someone there from HuffPo to say, “Joe Biden, do you regret sniffing the hair of hundreds of American citizens? Thousands?”
Not working out for ya Mr.Johnson..Don't even try..See most republicans are not on your pathetic side anymore. Your enabling a criminal..Donald Trump. His political futurecis ratger bleak and dismal. Republicans have bailed..Your bashing of Biden are on deaf ears
But the other option is Trump/Pence. By saying idk, are you saying that you’d rather consider them instead? For me, I’m saying let’s get Biden Harris in office and hold them accountable. We have a far better chance there than with Trump.
With this coming election, it’s a game of lesser of two evils but it should really be who’s going to listen to their constituents regardless of their own beliefs. My hope is that with Biden/Harris, they show growth against their past actions and do what’s right for the people.
Because  is a racist. #TrumpIsARacist #BidenHarris2020 #birtherism #BirtherismIsRacism #Birtherism2point0
Oh lordy...lemme guess: Obama/Biden bad. trump good. Russia fake. Are arrests forthcoming?
I disagree, but the only reason I do not push back even harder is that "you must vote for Biden or American democracy is dead" is dramatic, but something that *I* actually believe
Vote for BIDEN, for god's sake. It's not hard!
This has gotta be the 3rd or 4th poll today that I’ve seen with Biden in a double digit lead. Not ideal.
I ain’t voting for Cheeto Jesus, but the way these liberals build up sniff your hair Joe Biden and Copmala Harris is very off putting for me
All the times Kamala Harris criticized Joe Biden during the Democratic primary
My wife and I will be using mail in ballots forvthe first time..Biden all the way. We will then walk our ballots to our post office and sent off to be counted without your fucking interference.We will remove Dejoy and you on November 3 .Bank on it
WATCH: Nunes says Biden knew “damn well” about spying on Trump campaign |
They gotta go for the person that can do the dems business when biden needs to step dow.
Do I really need to list the issues of Hunter Biden?
I like that the Ed Markey video has a very brief bit acknowledging taking out Trump means moving on to fight Biden after.
President Obama and vice President Biden inherited the worst economy since the great depression they turn it around saves auto industry and Trump ruined it
Who cares? The Democrats conceded when they picked Biden. Everything after that is performance art. The campaign is stillborn but they’re carrying it to term anyway. That at least might get some Republican voter goodwill in a later election.
HUNTER BIDEN. Need I say more?  It sure seems like your defending/justifying someone who stole 1/2 million from a charity, just because she’s a woman.
It must have been really dumb because you don't look smart.  Anyone excited about Biden is not too smart. He was in office 45 years and all he did was put blacks in prison with his marijuana laws of the 80s he authored and his crime bill in 94. White old man dumb as a stump.
Unfortunately i knew this Bullshit was going to happen! Harris has a real dark history and to add insult to injury,the Black and Hispanic Community made it very clear that they are very upset with Biden using her as vice president! I hope he knows what he's doing! On tha real!!!
DONALD TRUMP AIN’T THE ONLY PROBLEM! BIDEN/ #WILMINGTON, DEL. MASSACHUSETTS/ ED MARKEY/ JOSEPH KENNEDY ARE PROBLEMS TOO! DELAWARE &amp; COONS! BEATTY’S IN #COLUMBUS, OHIO! GOT MY FAMILY LOCKED UP ON #MARIJUANA CHARGES! I’M NOT TO VOTE FOR THESE PEOPLE TO RUN THE WHITE HOUSE! #MaPoli
I dont understand. Kamala Harris scorched biden in the demoncratic primaries for obvious reasons she listed. And now she is running alongside him??? Is this political shit a game bros and sis?
Do you know what Donald..All your garbage your spewing out..voter supression usps mail in ballots..Americans aren't stupid..your BS only fires up voters to vote Biden and stand there and watch you crash and burn on November 3rd.. Your so low and desperate.sad
Biden calls for mandate requiring all Americans to wear masks  #FoxNews  👇 already being a true leader!
Isn’t the Secret Service protecting Biden and Harris right now should they be alerted of this threat?  look into
You ain’t Malcom Butler, Fuck Trump, Harris and Biden
And the hapless Joe Biden is claiming that the Obama admin is responsible for the Israel-UAE arrangement. Funny the only Mid East country Obama was interested in improving relationships with was Iran.
The difference between Trump and Biden is Trump loves the country and he cares about the future of the country. Biden thinks it’s a big fucking joke. Typical government worker.
Biden and Harris call for nationwide mandatory masks, an extremely American concept. “Mandatory”
I don’t know how anyone sees that Trump Ad as anything but Pro Biden  Electric Avenue SLAPS  And handcars are cool as hell
my wife posted an anti-Biden meme to facebook and it is taking an extraordinary act of willpower not to be extremely rude to the guy who accused her of spreading Russian propaganda
you support Donald Trump I didn’t realize you support Donald Trump you’re a Karen I don’t like Karen’s what do you need grabbed vote Joe Biden Democrats rule Republicans stink
#BidEn #Harris #NationalMaskMandate Priority 🙏 5 Year Old Boy Riding His Bike As 7 &amp; 8 Sisters He Was Playing With Came Out Held 🔫Loaded Gun To His Head &amp; Shot &amp; Killed The Innocent Child
A fine tribute from Sarah Vowell to public universities and their graduates, which include both members of the Democratic ticket.
I’m going to vote for Biden/Harris no matter what but to say that criticizing her WHILE STILL SUPPORTING HER TICKET is “insanity” “nonsense” “ego” and “selfish”??? Say you have no empathy for people more marginalized than you and go,  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ 3/3
It’s an insult that Biden and Harris think women will vote their way simply because a woman is running.  That’s pretty much saying you have no brain to vote for your own thoughts and opinions about intelligent topics.
Well unfortunately now, Biden incapable of simply answering questions. Maybe that man on the pic was, but that is not the man that is running for President.
via   Hooray. Incident free!
Yeah but before October there will be simulated footage of Biden eating a fetus and then looking directly at the camera and saying “yum yum, gimme some”
Private prisons are an injustice.  To imply that Biden/Harris will support and/or enable them more than Trump/Pence is just disingenuous tho
Well, we do have Biden on tape telling Amy he’s going to steal her husband and bring him to DC to help him. 🙄 The “problem” is the work Beto has been doing with PxP is going to bring seismic levels of change as to what TX politics will look like. They want him to keep that up.
Why are you attacking that ticket?  It’s a binary choice at this point: Biden or Trump.  To attack the Biden ticket is to support the Trump one
Tucker Carlson accuses Biden, Harris of embracing 'the Democratic Party's new pro-criminal agenda'
A Democratic Debut:  &amp;  make their first appearance together after the Democratic VP choice announcement in Biden’s home state of Delaware.  responds, painting Harris as “rushing to the radical left” #7News
Kamala attacked Biden for his abuse against women. Also called him a racist. In 2016 headlines read “Kamala, first Indian-American senator.” She now takes a postion from that abusive racist pedophile(Biden, her own words)and headlines read “Biden picks BLACK woman as VP”👍🏻🐑#KAG
the field is wide open for a presidential candidate who believes in the coronavirus pandemic and the associated unemployment and housing crisis, joe biden could be propped up by his nurses and take it easily
But she dances so much better than Biden..............
Has The Biden campaign offered Timothy Ennis a cabinet position yet?
😂😂😂😂he be doing Biden dirty
Oh also he BLATANTLY dragged Biden at the end, absolutely glorious
Senator, you made us so proud today. God Bless you and may God keep you and VPOTUS Biden safe. So PROUD!
Apparently Biden and Harris want to seem moderate.
Are they really using a dead man's Twitter account to attack Biden and Harris.
If you yelled at Biden supporters because of Tara Reade but you still support Alex Morse, I have news for you: you don’t actually give a fuck about Tara Reade, or any survivors. Go ahead and tweet snakes at me. I *fucking dare you.*
Says the woman who called out an old white man for his racism and sexism directly to his face on national television and is now that same man’s VP choice. Fuck Biden, Harris, Trump, Pence, the US government, and fuck dumb cunts who are gonna think B/H is TOO LEFT.
plus we get lefties convincing themselves Biden is 100% indistinguishable from Trump so they don't feel responsible for letting Trump win and liberals retconning him into a progressive champion so they don't feel responsible for the ways he'll be trash  what fun
Fight to increase funding for our schools and to increase access to higher education to improve the political knowledge of our populace. These will all help to improve the make-up of our government.   So, please, vote. Vote for Biden and Harris.
I hear the fears that if Harris and Biden are elected, progressives (especially white progressives) will pat themselves on the back, go home, and think that all has returned to “normal.” That is real. But we must then work to continue to agitate for change.
Moreover, while Harris and Biden do not have ideal records what we should consider is what they currently stand on and what they’ll do in office. Their platform is the most progressive in history, regardless of their past actions.
I hear the arguments against Biden and Harris. People are not wrong for criticizing them. I’ve criticized them. There's a lot to object to. Joe Biden was literally one of the architects of mass incarceration and the New Jim Crow.
this has nothing to do with anything but sometimes I think about how joe biden’s son Beau died and then his other son Hunter started dating the widow of his brother ???
Donated to Biden. For you my friend.
Joe Biden and Kamala Harris introduce their presidential ticket in Delaware
Wow a big crowd for Biden. Must be dozens of people there.
Big deal! With the things she has said about the POTUS why should we care? I happen to think she is as phony as the day is long. Her fake cackling laugh is enough to make  me want to throw something at my tv. I think she’s irritating and obnoxious just like Biden is.
In a surprising move, Biden picked the person that was the near unanimous front runner for the last six months.   Nailed it!
Given that Biden is slated to “hurt God,” I sure hope so.
Watching this Trump presser after Biden-Harris one
When Biden wins if they start to prosecute Trump he will flee to Russia and take His place and Vladimir Putin’s feet
When Biden wins if they start to prosecute Donald Trump he will flee to Russia and take his place at Vladimir Putin‘s feet
Who did you think Biden should have selected as his VP?
Brilliant speech by Biden. His best ever 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Lol I can’t wait til Trump brings up Hunter Biden in the debates.
These debates are going to be fantastic. Biden can barely speak.
I see the right doing that non stop but he won’t resign. Like most old white men Biden is very stubborn
Biden looks cinched in this picture
Biden looks like the creepy uncle and Trump looks like this even creepier friend.
Thank God! I’ll be voting for Biden. #BidenHarris2020 #VoteBidenHarris2020 #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica
JOE BIDEN JUST GOT TRUMP REELECTED WITH KAMALA HARRIS PICK  via  so she got the job just because she a black woman that sad and embarrassing
WTH is your problem..you should be removed from your senate seat for colluding with Russia to taint Joe Biden..You have nothing on him..So please take your garbage and exit right..not gonna work. Your corrupt like Trump..
Join me in supporting Help defeat Donald Trump and elect Joe Biden and Kamala Harris via
Not going to happen Bill. You and your socialist friends are going to have to deal with actual debates. Once Biden has to come out from behind his media screen he will be toast.
Man you are not a picture of health..Overwieght..Depleted..you look depressed and clueless and lost.. The writing is on your oval office wall..Your failed presidency won't end well. Your racist rants and anti-biden attacks won't serve you well..Be honest you knew this was coming.
Inwasnt talking about trunp at all but yea...thats what the government does. Put ppl in jail. Obama did it. Trump is doing it. Biden will do it. Its all the same.
Biden wants to decriminalize and expunge all the records for possession. But that’s besides the point because facts doesn’t seem to matter in this weird take. You don’t want to answer the question because your answers would be weird too. Enjoy your day.
People are hating on Biden for getting a cop VP but who else can better change the policing system than a former cop who knows how the system works? If she really wants to “fight for the people”, she’ll make the right moves to fix the injustice in the system
Harris is a yes man. A chameleon.  Lets not forget that she was a supporter of me2 accusations against Biden.  She a product of Bussing How does  Dems platform want to defund police hire the CA secretary of law enforcement. Harris is bad news ask willy brown. Its about tech $
I agree I don’t think Biden should debate Trump how can you debate someone who makes up facts and lies it will  be a complete waste of time
Yall think Biden and Harris are just gonna let yall protest in peace?
Better Than Hitler! Biden-Harris 2020. It may catch on.
Can I just point out: Biden, Trump, Kanye on the same ballot. Lmao
I'm a 71 yrs young white man who has seen so much in my life time. I'm proud of u both and pray for our country 💗🙏🙏🙏. Go Joe Biden and Kamala Harris.  Our country needs u more than ever.✌️🙏🙏🙏💙💙💙 James I'll do my part for the good of all
I'm proud to be and will always be a Democrat. I think this ticket of Biden/Harris will be so strong that our country will finally come together, but there alot of work to do. Dr evil has left us with a huge mess. Hard work and we'll achieve all that is needed to be Great Again
Besides being intelligent, experienced, and attractive she possesses a strength and energy that would make a lesser running mate (Trump didn’t choose the passive Pence by accident!) uncomfortable sharing the spotlight. #BIDEN/HARRIS the perfect ticket for America!
Smh, and that’s Biden’s vp?
So y’all couldn’t make this thread after the election ? The whole point is to get Trump who is more evil and vile out office but when you do this thread you’re taking votes away from her and Biden
If you are unable to understand the needs of other people, you are incapable of being a leader. Biden is the right person at the right place at the right time!
Nice #racist combo. #KamalaHarris2020 family owned the plantations in #Jamaica and #Biden is stating to #Blacks #YouAintBlack if you leave the #Democrat plantation. Both putting the in jail as much as possible. #BidenHarris2020.
Wow! I guess it REALLY behooves Biden to back the policies that voters want, right? Why not encourage Biden to do so instead of jumping on the DNC threat wagon? Its on Biden to EARN votes not just be the less awful choice. Stop shilling, Bob.
Biden VP pick Harris promoted group that put up bail for alleged violent criminals
Me driving off 6 months ago the morning after the NH primary on little sleep.  I still have those high hopes for Biden/Harris.  The Democratic Avengers have begun assembling and it will be glorious.
Biden-Harris 2020 “it is what it is”
It's wild Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib scored such solid wins in well funded attempts to oust them happened in the same party that appointed Joe Biden as their leader and Kamala Harris as his running mate. Seems dysfunctional!
Did Joe Biden pick Ghislaine Maxwell for VP?
Maybe Rob Reiner looks like Joe Biden? Nah, Rob looks way better than Joe. Run, Rob, run!
She’s the antithesis of Warren, Markey, AOC, Biden/Harris White House, Omar, Pressley, Tlaib, Sanders. So 🤷🏻‍♂️ balance?
Joe Biden announcing Kamala as his VP like we ain’t seen this show already 🤣🤣
I feel like the most unbelievable thing about 2020 is the washington football team name change. like if you told me last year that there’d be a pandemic and mookie was going to LA and biden and harris were the ticket, I would have gone along with it. but this? no way in hell tbh
Guess you won't be crying when her and Biden start locking up more people for victimless crimes huh
Well,  didn't mince word in this  piece, "The Senate is affirmative action for white people"
Everytime you post a anti biden video..racist remarks about Kamala Harris.I will report your disgusting and pathetic tweets to  asap and to  . that would suck if you were permanetly banned from Twitter right to the election..Not kidding!Enuf!
🗣: In the end #45 has to go ! Get over it and vote Biden/ Harris or you’re apart of the problem! Periodt !
In juxtaposition, Biden is everything Trump is not.He's strong enough to pick someone who has challenged him; someone who is charismatic and accomplished. This bodes well for Biden's cabinet.
Hope you guys realize if Biden wins Kamala WILL be the president. She will run the entire operation.
Biden isn't winning, so it doesn't matter who Biden's handlers choose.
Taking bets on how long it will be before we go from President Biden to President Harris.
Joe biden’s slogan is “Build back better” which to me has under tones as MAGA and now he got that cop as his VP candidate ... shessssh
I guess it’s good to see that Biden actually did anything. We’re fucked no matter what happens. It’s all relative to your comfort level and how well one is fixed to survive a lot of horrible shit as we struggle and stumble forward.
"Joe Biden selects Senator Kamala Harris to be his vice presidential running mate"
Federally legalize Marijuana tomorrow, and Trump/Pence win this election  Kamala already made all their arguments for them; re: Biden being an establishment dem, and a creepy one at that  And now they can slam Kamalas law enforcement history  The contrast between tickets is stark
Sen Kamala Harris as a running mate for Biden.
Trump on Biden's VP pick: Harris was my 'number one draft pick' - CNN Politics - lair lair lair I’m against #fracking too ! She doesn’t have any to take healthcare YOU DO!
He doesn't consider Biden a real Catholic because Biden isn't Pro-Life
"don't vote for Biden, allowing the president to be reelected, and maybe get a more progressive nominee in 2024" seems like a pretty long game to me
Trump is gonna get a bit offended by Biden's dogwhistles during the debate
Joe Biden and company did zero for women for 6 years. This woman minority not getting the attention. They have been humiliated by this country.
Biden almost selected Klobuchar but his staff wasn't gonna let him pick someone who'd immediately do him like LBJ did Kennedy. Day 1, stapler from a grassy knoll. Harris doesn't have the guts.
can't wait for vp pelosi when biden dies on january 21 when his organs start shutting down bc he forgot how to eat &lt;3
In 6 years Joe Biden did nothing. I personally don't want to live in his "mans" world anymore. Democrat: FOR WOMAN( ALL THE PEOPLE) Its more than workplace discrimination. Welfare is $500 a month. Imagine you lost your childs father in unexpected death! And get that
Please don’t put Joe Biden &amp; Kamala Harris on a pedestal. Yes they’re the better choice than Trump but they’re the lesser of TWO EVILS. Shits still not gonna be sweet.
We'll have our work cut out for us pushing Biden/Harris leftward, but not voting or voting for a third party candidate will do such harm to the country and (natural) world so as to be - in my mind - unconscionable. And I do believe the left's arguments have had an impact already.
After suffering 4 years with the Trump/Pence administration that has tried to drag America back into the worst years of its past, Joe Biden has selected a running mate enabling the Democrats to lead America into a proud future!
YouTube Biden Ukraine Quid Pro Quo Joe  Why? In 6 years he did nothing for anyone but Hunter Democrats used to fight for all the people. Currently woman and children have become last. Name 1 thing Biden and his boob Obama did for woman and children??
Sen Harris do you still believe VP Biden’s accusers? Do you still have an issue with him working with segregationalists? 🤔🤔🤔🤔
bro if i’m gonna have to vote for biden/harris in nov i will literally *** myself
Kamala Harris – Biden’s VP Choice’s Story
if y’all keep complaining about the biden/harris ticket how are you going to expect people to vote for biden in november? even if y’all are still voting for him that’s not what everyone else sees. they just see reasons not to
I’m not a conspiracy theorist by any means but...what if Biden wins, resigns for health concerns, and Harris becomes not only the first woman, but the first black woman as President. President Harris has a nice ring to it 🤷🏼‍♂️
Listen: y’all can get your jokes off about Kamala as long as you still go vote for her and Biden because we can’t do 4 more years of orange. Thanks, Management
Honestly, I'm a little relieved it's over. I don't care about Harris. I don't care about Biden. But at least we don't have to listen to that brand of horse race shit for a while
Get over it.. You have lost every voter.. Biden and Harris will take over now..You already killed your base in those 163,000 americans.. Cyrus Vance is coming for you and Michael Flynn is going back to prison..Your golf clubs are calling ya
I will still be voting for the Biden/Harris ticket ...I just don’t think I have to shut-up and just vote!
Lmaoooooooooo  Donald Trump Issues Statement About Joe Biden and Kamala Harris  via
Elect Biden. We need Maya Rudolph every weekend on SNL.
Did he wait to announce this when Biden announced his running mate. Was wondering what news would come out from him.
Hm, I actually think (being in a state Biden will lay zero attention to) that the best thing I can do is strategically withhold my vote. If Biden loses MA by a little less then expected, maybe he will be more inclined to take us seriously
I love this. It shows that both of you can come together, despite moments of tension, and being this country together. I  look forward to saying President Biden and Madame Vice President Harris.
Biden and Harris will pulverize your father in any debate..Start panicking jr..The end days of your fathers corrupt and criminal administration are coming..including Cyrus Vance from Manhattan..you and donnie jr and Ivanka..gone!  Watch! Your criminal enterprise is collapsing
Who put a miter on Biden's head?
Literally. Cause in another scenario I probably wouldn’t vote for Biden/Harris. But please don’t be dumb rn. I’m not worrying too much aabout a woman as much an a competent person taking office
Biden/Harris vs Trump/Pence lets see how it goes, tag match of the year? #tuesdayvibes #VicePresident #KamalaHarrisForVP
I guess the good thing abt this ticket is that it’s not radically progressive but just more of the same soooo the Republicans can’t really attack Biden on being left wing. The attacks fall short.
I must have texted LAST to 30330 by mistake because the Biden campaign still hasn't told me anything
*Biden picks Kamala Harris as VP*   Russian bots posing as Bernie bro’s:
Dude, you've got to disassociate with Biden/ Harris, no one is excited to vote for them. I can't think of a combo that gives less of a f*** about what is going on in America right now. There is no substance there. You're better than them! Forge your own path.
I donated to Biden instead!
If Joe Biden wins they are going to say he’s too mentally unstable so she will become president and Nancy Pelosi will be the Vice President
Too ambitious is just what we want.Ambitious to save America is why Im voting Biden/Harris
Semi-hot take on #KamalaHarrisForVP: If Biden wins, expect the GOP to get a lot more libertarian on drugs, criminal justice, etc.
Just like he was supposed to win over Biden? 🤔
Watch "Joe Biden Gaffes &amp; Bloopers" on YouTube
A VP pick isn’t just about helping the current candidate win. It’s about the future of the party. It’s hard to imagine Biden ever securing the nomination if he hadn’t first been Obama’s VP. A VP Harris means we’ll be fighting the carceral wing of the Dems for decades to come.
Biden snubs African Americans picks Jamaican for running mate
Lmfao dawg I’m NOT prepared for 3 months of white people with red roses in their twitter name telling me I’m dumb for supporting a Biden/Harris ticket as a black man
giving us a little bit of hope for this year.    Time to go all in.    Biden/Harris 2020
Biden must have some idiots in circle to let him pick Harris. We’ve all literally been saying how bad she would be 🤦🏽‍♂️
I can say with complete confidence that Elizabeth is gonna be a good sport about this and all in for the Biden/Harris ticket. Follow her lead.
Lol Donald Trump has done more to get people out of prison than Biden/Harris ever did. A pox on both their houses.
Kamala Harris would not have been my first choice for VP. Biden needed someone more progressive to expand his base... HOWEVER an African American woman as a VP is MONUMENTAL
Hard work means more than family wealth. Vote Biden/Harris #RidinWithBiden #GoJoe2020
I’m listening to Stuart Stevens’ book “It Was All A Lie,” right now.  It’s healing to hear it after feeling like I’ve been watching and experiencing gaslighting for years.  But my question is, if Biden is elected, what will be the next actions of the people in the Lincoln Project
Kennedy/Johnson Johnson/Humphrey Humphrey/Muskie McGovern/Shriver Carter/Mondale Mondale/Ferraro Dukakis/Bentsen Clinton/Gore Gore/Lieberman Kerry/Edwards Obama/Biden Clinton/Kaine Biden/Harris

Kamala Harris was a former #1 contender for dem candidates I would consider drinking with. She fell out down in the polls when she dropped out.   Biden was never even in the running because I strongly dislike him - and I really like alcohol -  so that’s saying a lot.
The Democratic ticket announcement = Biden / Harris
I'm cautiously optimistic about the Biden/Harris ticket... but uh.. go team
Wrong choice. Shows lots about the pathetic state that Biden is in &amp; how the Dems are just wrong again.   The move was to the middle w/ the choice knowing cabinet would be left reaching and VP really the play caller.   Good luck winning over moderates on both sides w/ more crazy!

Why joe Biden why 😭
It’s official: Biden picks  as running mate.
Is #Biden attempting to lose to #Trump, it’s like neither want the job and are trying to out do each other for who’s worse for the job. #SENDHELP
Doubling down on my conspiracy theory that Harris got permission from the Biden campaign to do the one attack on Biden the entire primary.
Biden chooses Harris.
Now that the waiting is over, let's hit the ground running with turnout. Mail the ballots in and make sure to ask your neighbors if they voted yet? It's the very effective nothing method that made NOLA's 4th Ward 3rd precinct darn near 100% for every election. Biden/Harris 2020!
It's official:  Sen.  is Joe Biden's vice presidential pick.
is the Biden campaign ever going to pivot to the general?
Word, so Biden didn't listen to a thing the liberals were saying. Fantastic

BREAKING: Biden’s VP choice is Leslie Barbara Knope. A strong local Parks and Rec leader from Pawnee, Indiana!  “Be the Leslie Knope of whatever you do!” 🌲
I STILL CAN'T BELIEVE JOE BIDEN PICKED OLIVIA POPE AS HIS VP! WHY DIDN'T ANYONE TELL HIM THAT SHE WAS A FICTIONAL CHARACTER!?
In other words, the same reason McCain lost. He was a great candidate but picked a terrible running mate. (It didn’t help that he was running against Obama, who was an excellent candidate and knew how to create buzz in a way that Trump does and Biden doesn’t.)
okay fine y’all guessed it...i’m joe biden’s vp
Me waiting for Biden to announce his VP
Wow, can't believe Biden chose Warren AND Klobuchar to be his #VPPick
2016 DNC was actually great. Both Obamas, Warren, Sanders, Booker, Biden. All top notch speeches. I can also remember enjoying Jennifer Granholm and Sarah Silverman "You're being ridiculous."
While everyone on Twitter dot com is speculating about Joe Biden’s VP pick, I would like to take this opportunity to recognize and remember America’s first Vice President, Quincy’s own John Adams.
Relax! He isn’t getting a spot in the Biden admin.  Ever hear of swing voters ? There are quite a few in Ohio. It doesn’t hurt to allow the popular former governor endorse you. Practical Democrats realize this.  Bernie Bros would rather die on the left wing purity pyre.

Joe Biden has spent his entire career supporting and promoting women’s rights. That's why I joined Women For Biden. Join women from across the country as we continue the fight for women's health care, paychecks, safety, and families.
You know we're in troubling times when specific genitalia is one of the required attributes for which a VP mate is to be selected... Utter shame Mr Biden
Biden/Harris I hope
I always thought it was very strange Joe Biden took so long before he decided to enter the presidential race. I suspect they knew he was failing and had concerns that he would last. Democrats have no shame
4 year olds can ride a bike, that doesn’t make him fit for President. Biden will destroy this country.  Just look at the Dem run cities. That will be everywhere with him in charge.
I'd love to add this to that recent conversation. I declare... If Joe Biden wants to hand Donald Trump 4 more years in the White House then by all means he should pick that 1-term white women governor.
know telling &amp; amusing about these leftist democrats. Going around talking shit how joe Biden got to pick a black woman for VP. These liberal democrats do more damage to black people than anyone else. shit people going to be talking now about Biden’s pick. No party affiliations
If his VP is the murder doll Chuckie, I’m still in on Biden.
Seeing that Biden’s VP pick is “imminent”, who do y’all think it’s gonna be?
And now I know why they called you meathead! The North won at Gettysburg but you keep supporting Joe Biden who was friends with an actual KKK member in Robert Byrd.
The electorate did decide.. overwhelmingly who they wanted and it was Joe Biden...
Wuhan! Obama/Biden owned the lab!  He ordered one released, they're be more to follow!   With Trump, we keep our rights! With Biden, we lose our rights!  Republican party started in 1800's,  because Democrats wanted slavery to continue!  Independent, but prefer my rights!
So are we to presume Biden favors President Moro of Bolivia? President Maduro of Venezuela? Honduran President Zelaya? All three were elected by their citizens.
So as far as Im concerned the #democrats need to enshrine their place in the #africanamerican community by getting #Biden to select a #BlackWoman to the #VPPick . #Biden2020ToSaveAmerica would be nothing without #blackvote from #SouthCarolina. #blacklivesmatter #ripgeorgefloyd
THIS IS WHY I NEED BIDEN TO WIN! Hubs really doesn’t want to buy a house if it doesn’t happen...I tweeted all our concerns to Nancy Pelosi, Adam Schiff, Eric Swalwell and Joe Biden.  I encourage you to do the same.  Complaining among ourselves isn’t going to bring change.  Bring it to the people with the power and PUSH.  Peace out.
Voting for Biden is about saving our country and democracy, Trumpler Is a fascist dictator and has already hinted that if he wins he will never leave office and have his kids take over when he dies. To may of our ancestors died to make America a democracy
I’m pretty sure the press is part of the Elect Biden team. When they do get to ask questions, you can be certain those questions will be pre-approved with the answers written on the TelePrompTer.
I can't thank  enough for his VP pick. Keeping my fingers crossed that she IS legally eligible to run, I've heard there are 2 areas that may disqualify her - haven't checked into it myself... Biden just handed Trump the election tied up w a nice little bow on top 😁😁
very true where is the joe Biden evidence?

Biden picking Kamala Harris is the best comedy movie since Tropic Thunder #BidenHarris
I wish Joe Biden was not the Democratic nominee but I am going to vote for him because he is the one of 2 options with any real chance to win
He recently said the 1917 (1918) pandemic ended WW2 in 1945 because the soldiers got sick, he also said the fatility rate is low for the US. And the right try’s to say Biden is in decline
I remember on election night in 1992 with Clinton finished Is victory speech, “don’t stop thinking about tomorrow” by Fleetwood Mac started playing. I think that would be a great song for election night this year after a Biden/Harris win
Are DemonRats swinging for the fences with the joke known as the Harris/Biden ticket really just hoping to win? My concern is they are more focused on down ballot elections trying to retain control of House and flip the Senate which would be disastrous #MAGA #KAG
Your dead wrong Obama Biden administration did absolutely nothing for Americans in 8 years And nothing for Blacks and their neighborhoods Trumps done more for Blacks in 3 years than Obama Did in 8 Look at the facts Prison Reform The First Step Act Better opportunity to buy homes
Joe Biden and Kamala Harris are EMBARRASING and Causing Democrat DISARRA...  via
The Democratic Party picks Candidates based on party delegates and "super delegates" who wanted Joe Biden. The Democratic Party is wrong for America and they don't care about regular people just the elites it's time to end the two party system #VoteGold2020
Can we just accept that no matter who Biden picked they were gonna suck in some way, and some part of the "party" would be upset? Let's just face the music and head into november strong.
It keeps happening with Joe Biden also there's a video of him trying to nibble on his wife's finger. The DNC could have nominated anybody else but the elites in the DNC want racist Joe Biden
From the second I met Dave I knew that he truly cared about Easton residents and the residents of every single town in MA04. I would have loved to see him down in DC fighting for progressive policies during the Biden-Harris Administration...
So, the media treats Biden/Harris like the "Royals" and yesterday was their debut. Talk about "Low energy " entrance! And all they did was bash Trump! #Trump2020
I understand that Biden and Kamala have many many flaws but unless you like what Trump’s doing, keep that shit to yourself for now
If Biden and Harris get in  we will slowly become a third world country they will give U.S. away . Free Free who pays for it the taxpayer
Biden and Kamala not my first or second choice but Lets Work! First thing! Lets figure out this student loan!

She a joke a Racist and a fraud She hates Biden and white people but she’s Honored to be VP for the guy she hates because she will end up the nominee when Biden steps down 🤣Of course she is 🤮
Biden pushed Obama on gay marriage.
I don't care what Biden/Harris chemistry is. I just want to live in a sane world with a functioning goverment.
Biden is Catholic
Kamila Harris said she believes the women that accused Joe Biden of sexual misconduct and yet she’s his running mate? How can ANY Woman wrk side by side w/a man she claims to believe is a PREDATOR???
People are hating on Biden for getting a cop VP but who else can better change the policing system than a former cop who knows how the system works? If she really wants to “fight for the people”, she’ll make the right moves to fix the injustice in the system

Biden is a racist and always has been Look at his entire career he was against every Civil Rights Bill for Blacks and used racial slurs every time he opened his mouth and he’s done nothing for the American people even his 8 as VP You must know this but still say how great he is
Tucker Carlson...”Just hours ago, Joe Biden’s “handlers” announced “they” have selected Kamala Harris of California to run as Biden’s Vice President...”😂😂😂😂😂😂
There is no way we don't live in a simulation. All I saw on Twitter today was wet pussy debates. Biden picked Kamala Harris for VP. Former WWE wrestler Kamala just died and his finisher was the "Kamala Splash"  #BidenHarris #FOH
Yes Ma’am First Lady Biden🇺🇸
Biden just secured President Trump's second term.
Why do I feel like this move by Biden really hurt his chances of becoming president?
Just gasped so loudly when I saw Biden’s pick, that my coworker fell out of her seat #KamalaHarrisForVP #BidenHarris2020

NEXT VP NAMED Joe Biden named CA Sen. Kamala Harris as his running mate on Tuesday, making history by selecting the first Black woman to compete on a major party's presidential ticket and acknowledging the vital role Black voters will play in his bid to defeat Trump. #mapoli #VP
Not gonna lie, when I saw the breaking news headline of “Biden Picks Harris As VP Choice” I was incredibly disappointed to learn it wasn’t  sigh...
Biden just secured 4 more years of President Trump!!!
I'm so happy for you and our country. In these times its not often that there is a time for joy and excitement but this is one time. God bless you and VP Biden.
Joe Biden has selected Kamala Harris as running mate.
It's  Yes!
Kamala Harris was selected as Biden's running mate on the presidential ticket for the Democratic Party.
Dont worry  all these Karen's will be on video crying when he wins again. I wonder what their take is gonna be when the dems switch out Biden for a "medical issue"
Again. Accusations. Whether true or false. What does that have to do with the economy? Biden literally stole millions of dollars and sent it to ukraine. What's worse? I'll wait.
I legit can't think of anyone I want to as vp for Biden... But I'll take whoever.   But legit, this isn't the time to play around. His pick needs to bring in voters. If he chooses someone that undecided/on the fence voters don't like then it's a wrap. Please don't fuck this up
This. You vote for Biden and then you still get to make his life miserable for 4 years with constant activism.
I don't know why Biden would listen to him. He may seem moderate but he has extreme abortion views.

Why didn't Biden and Obama do it. When they were in power 11 yrs ago.
The reason why We need a younger vp candidate is because Biden said he will only do one term, that mean in 24 the VP candidate will run. Warren is in her 70s so say she wins in 24 and only does one term then we have to find someone for 28.
Warren doesn’t add value to Biden because of her age and race. What ads vale is a younger black woman
Like I said I have no problem with a socialist president but a lot of people do. The independents especially who Biden needs to win
Biden wouldn't try to exploit Gettysburg cuz he's a narcissist.
I’m voting Biden no matter what but we don’t need Warren in the ticket or he has no chance. She is to old and will be labeled a socialist which will sink Biden. He needs a moderate black woman to have any chance to win
I do support whoever Biden picks but Warern isn’t a good chose if it means losing her seat. Especially with how Kennedy going after tithe other senate senate. That would leave no one good to run in a special election against the Republican incumbent
I understand but we don’t want her as VP she will hurt Biden and Cost the Dems the senate and RBG Supreme Court seat. First she is to old, second she will be labeled a socialist and Biden will be done
They're rebooting The Hunger Games where after Biden gets elected President and the whole country starves to death.
I hope Joe Biden learned a lesson about the times we are in. I get that he would listen to old trusted friends. The campaign should have stopped in its track the misogyny coming from some of his advisors.
Look at Biden’s career He’s been more  racist than Trump ever has Trumps done more for Blacks in 3 years than Obama in 8 Biden was against Blacks on every Civil Rights bill &amp; used racist remarks about every nationality since day one in office Yet Blacks still vote for this fool
America is in serious trouble if that idiot Biden and the Dems can rig the election Wake up lady

Fuck trump let China help Biden! It’s not like trump wants every dictator or country to influence our elections since 2016
All BS Have you heard Biden? RACIST! I guarantee that Trump wins the black vote. He had the lowest unemployment rate in history for Blacks &amp; Latinos before the China virus. Even with Dems fighting him &amp; using the media for false propaganda -he has succeeded.
Over 10% unemployment still! Wow, that’s worse than the Great Recession.  Of course, President Obama and VP Biden would have never let it come to this.  Sad.
Joe Biden is a racist because he supported segregation and just this year he said that, "if you can't tell if you're for me or Trump then you ain't black", and voted the crime bill that locked up blacks
Can people stop asking if I'd wait in line for 8 hours to vote for Biden? We fucking get it.  Yes.  Who are you even asking and what's your actual G goddamned point?  That's rhetorical. I understand. But damn
If Joe Biden was my grandpa, I will snatch the car’s keys away from him
Clyburne should have stayed out the Biden comment about latinex diversity. He didn't help.
Joe Biden is also a racist
Joe Biden says more racist things than Trump does but Trump is the racist
It's true. The media is either both siding stuff or falling for the latest Republican fake scandal. Like the dumb reporter who asked Biden has he taken a cognitive test.
I actually think more disgruntled Trump voters will turn to Kanye’s joke camaign to vote then it will draw away from Biden. This will backfire on them.
He has to be the most despicable person on this planet. In what scenario would anyone presume that their rival “is against God”? Think of the meaning of that statement ..... of all people to say has no belief in God, he picks Biden....a man whose been to hell and back
Again and again Oprah shows how racist she is but nobody says a word about it Just like Biden his entire career against Black Civil Rights Bills and racist comments regularly Yet they attack Trump and call him a racist Typical isn’t it

Well, I guess we will have to watch where they are spending. I think they have committed ~$280M to ad buys. But a lot of that money could be focused on retaining the house, not so much promoting Biden. I sure haven't seen too many Biden signs or bumperstickers, that's for sure.

Totally. But yes, exactly about the shortlist. This is Biden, who no one (I know) has high expectations of. Why would our expectations of who his VP pick be so high? I was just relieved it wasn’t Whitmer, who likely would have lost him MI because she has turned her back on Flint.

Honestly the only thing I’m looking forward to in potential presidential debates is Biden calling Trump a bunch of names that we’ll have to google to verify if they are or aren’t old timey slurs.

Well, he's white.  I don't recall any birtherism bs about HRC or Biden either.  You would think his blatant racism would be enough to vote him out, but apparently 50% or more of Americans are also racist.

How about you put this on your TelePrompTer! Get this through your lying brain. Biden has no brain left to get this through. He can’t even read it and get it right.
IMO, at that stage, he can be dragged off to the side in all of his insanity and stashed away in a locked room until Biden's term begins. Nobody will care and most will be relieved.
Like Trump said. She’s a nasty woman! Tell it like it is!  I’m sure Biden thought that after her attacks on him during the Primaries!
Has America not been lied too enough by the Democrats? Wake up people!  Compare Kamala statements about Biden before and now! LIAR!  She’s called a moderate? Are you kidding me? Not one Democrat should be elected. Is it possible 50% of Americans are stupid enough to believe them?
Kampala Harris has been a great pick as VIP with Biden. She really brings a lot to the campaign! People love her!   Yup! All 3% of those who voted for her during the Primary! 😂   By the way, she’s not African American. Get that straight!

And if you can’t comprehend that Tara Reade is a liar, there is no way for me to help you. It’s Biden or Trump, and any other choice helps Trump. Sorry to break it to you.
I don’t like Joe that much either, but you have two choices: Biden or Trump, and any vote NOT for Biden is a vote for Trump. You need to comprehend that. Refer to my earlier tweet about 2 party systems and FPTP voting.
Ok, let's do this!! First Black woman and Caribbean/Asian American on a major party ticket! No matter how you feel about her, just take some time to take in this historic moment. #WOC #represent
Lots of fodder for the Republican Party to work with!  Does she still think Biden is a racist?
Let’s Go.
Warren would have been a better choice but I’m gonna vote for Biden no matter what. Was hoping one nice thing could happen in a maelstrom of insanity, but alas, no. Just get this year done with already...
Kamala- not good enough to be the Dems’ frontrunner. But plenty good enough to takeover when Biden is inevitably relieved of duties due to the blatant mental inadequacies? I struggle to understand why the Dems’ don’t just pick a presidential candidate to collectivey rally behind.
Like this pick - she was my top choice for President! Kamala Harris will join Joe Biden on the Democratic Party ticket as the VP nominee to defeat Donald Trump and Mike Pence in November -
Alright, BIDEN/HARRIS 2020!  #DumpTrump2020 #TrumpDepression #TrumpVirus #WeWantJoe

Ok.    Assuming you’re right, and it’s not just something he’s saying to placate centrists, what’s another viable option?    I want to know, because I’m not so much a Biden supporter as I am a “Get Donny Out” supporter.
And what chance do those policies have of becoming reality in a Trump administration?  Wouldn’t they have a better chance of happening under Biden?
How will our aims be achieved with a second Trump administration?     If we gain control of Congress to pass M4A (for example) could you honestly see it being vetoed by Biden?

You're unbelievably foolish comment about impeaching Joe Biden shows just how corrupt the current Republican party is. Also,  just stupid.  I mean you're intelligent yet you have to do this play acting as an anti-intellectual and to say stupid s*** to fit in.
I don’t understand.  How does attacking Biden help in removing Trump from office?    Isn’t that the immediate goal?
Yeah...  watch 11:15-12:24. Still voting for Biden no matter who he picks, but this is not my favorite take on police reform and allocation of funding.
None of the liberal media call out Biden for only making scripted remarks. Zero credibility
This is what Biden did do when faced with a pandemic: #WalkAway #Trump2020 #TrumpLandslideVictory
1. There is no way he wrote this "apology." 2. There is no way he remembers what he said even 5 minutes ago. 3. There is a pattern of Biden's gross, racist statements.

Biden is hiden because his mind is sliden  Please flood Facebook with this!!!
Remember Marine Corps (pronounced Corpse by Obama?  Not to mention countless gaffes by his Vice President.  We know why Biden does it though and it’s just sad.  Maybe Queen Botox prays for him nightly because she’s such a good Catholic.
Idk ab y’all but I don’t think just voting for Biden to “just get trump out” is smart. We shouldn’t be voting like that

I had those very thoughts. How you think so do you write. No way Biden wrote the explanation.   So as he speaks, so will he write. Birripbirripbirrip, “that’s all folks.”  For those of you who weren’t around, look up Porky Pig! 😂
He isn’t talking about the culture , but political views , he didn’t say all black people are the same Hence “notable exceptions”  This is what Trump wants you guys to believe smh hear Biden’s statement

PLease don't get overconfident people. If the Dems need to pull Biden out (cuz of his dementia) then they will slide her into the Prez slot.  That would be perfect for her, since she is a lazy, hyper-entitled person that does not want to lower herself to "campaigning".
So does that mean Biden is actually Raymond Shaw, but with dementia?  🤔

I am leaning toward Scott Adam’s theory.  That being, the Fems know Biden won’t even make it to the election, so they pick a weak VP and get ready to replace Biden with the real Pres candidate at the last minute.  Camala or Moochell is my guess for Biden’s replacement

This is so true! Trump can't get a hold on Biden, because they are so 'similar' - older whiter males. That's the secret of Biden's success. Trump can't find a wedge issue, based on race, or gender, or political extremism. It's an apples-to-apples race, and Trump is the bad apple.

The one who wrote the '94 tough on crime bill?  Yes, he's responsible for the current prison industrial complex.  Look at incarceration rates before and after Biden's signature bill.  Democrats have been 'tough on crime' since the '90s.  Where have you been?
I would recommend your looking at  feed for plenty of articles about allegations against Joe Biden.  Regarding corruption, he's got 50 years of representing corporations in Congress.  There are plenty of articles like this one.
Obama and Biden looted SS years ago. Joe doesn’t remember that tho!
but does me backing that “real opponent” do anything? how does me voting for biden actually accomplish anything, other than throwing away a vote that could’ve gone towards a party and candidate that support medicare for all and saving the planet and people on it?
And that "strong woman" said her questioning him was political theater.  That's not strength.  Your VP is an authoritarian who has exploited the prison industrial complex that Biden helped establish.  She's trash.
He's probably one of the people who is flying with the Trump line that "if Biden gets elected, the stock market will crash". He's wrong tho, because even if trump doesn't manage to fix it, he won't leave. He's checking who in the military is loyal to him rn.

“Mike Pence Says He's Not Going To Let Biden And Harris 'Cut America's Meat'”  😂😂😂
Biden is going back to the suburbs to save your loveless marriage with a person who cheats on you. Trump is your physically abusive spouse who is addicted to Vicodin from a work injury he sustained 20 years ago and for which he blames the union.
“It doesn’t have to snowball,” said  “...But if the president is saying, ‘Stop. I think I won, where did these blue shift ballots come from?’ You could have this dispute spin out of control.”
We want all charges made to Trump and cronies when Biden in office so that they can’t be pardoned
How many times did you visit Epstein’s Fuck island Jim? How about the island next to it? That’s owned by Joe Biden.
You’re very presumptive , I’m choosing anyone but Biden , just like your mentality seems anyone but trump (you’re supporting a geriatric) ,I would prefer if  ran , then your head would really pop off ... as a Democrat think back to JFK speech and stop wanting handouts
Ok. You convinced me. I am going to vote for Biden/Harris
Biden’s numbers are better than those in those states. Wow the pressure is really getting to you to hedge and just never be able to be proved wrong ever.
I don’t think Biden is going to ban cheeseburgers or whatever, but I have done quite a bit of research on how much of the water in the American Southwest is diverted to cattle and cattle feed and oh boy is that gonna be a fuckin doozy for LA, Phoenix and Las Vegas soon enough.
Great propaganda , as a union member we were at 100% employment and busier than ever , not a video , I lived it.  I enjoy not paying 60% tax as proposed by Biden , and I like a candidate that doesn’t bail Antifa terrorists out of jail.
I hadn't really paid much attention the Kamela Harris before the selection as VP on the Biden ticket. However, there is nothing like Trump calling her a nasty foreigner that makes me instantly like her.
This is really a coup and has to be stopped. Does anyone out there have any way to stop this? What about Biden, Harris &amp; Democratic leadership? Are they planning their own legal actions and strategies to fight this assault on our electoral system and democracy?
Biden is already to the right of Romney and Bush on several issues, so...
Court documents seem to suggest that the idea to charge Flynn with violations of the Logan Act may have come from Joe Biden. That probably will not be good news for Biden’s 2020 campaign.
I mean I had hoped you say you stopped a little.   It's gonna be weird for your pride when the Harry Potter Warren people prevent more people from getting pushed into unmarked vans than you by electing Biden.
because in most states, like MA, biden is gonna win by 30%, nearly a million votes.  is there really any reason, in that situation, not to vote for the candidate that most closely aligns with my values?  personally, medicare for all is very much needed.
Comma-La, what is it like to play nursemaid to Old Joe Biden &amp; refrain him from racist outbursts?
give me one good reason to vote for biden in a deep blue (or red) state
Each state that has Cares Act surplus dollars from the bill can institute this process and short order and deficit spending will be reimbursed under the Biden Administration...Short term borrowing at very low interest rates now for 90 to 120 days.
Just like Killary you and your dad will not buy this election either. Sick of the Soros/ Clinton/Biden/Obama crime families f*cking with our country.  Ya heels up ain’t becoming VP either
It's really nice of Biden to give the guy who will run against him in 2024 a chance to launch his campaign. #Kasich
Tensions linger between Biden and Obama camps throughout 2020 primary campaign: report  #FoxNews
Oh you silly rabbits, only Republicans have mandates according to the national press corps almost all of which are employees of large corporations with large corporate interests. Biden could win by an historic landslide &amp; still be considered on shaky ground.
Your reminder that Joe Biden will be the only Presidential candidate this year to have corresponded with Hannah Arendt:
We'd have seen even more of this in the primary if COVID-19 hadn't gifted the nomination to Biden.
I agree and cannot believe how many people discount Biden's staying power. Given what he has been through personally (like, really, it should make everyone stop in their tracks) I can't help but be in awe of his  resilience.
Malcolm, you need to be back in public service. What position would you accept in a Biden/Harris administration?
Here's how the 2020 presidential election could come down to state lawmakers, according to
If you want evil to win..  Vote for Biden.  Very simple decision this year
I think right now all Democratic governors are megalomaniac. Weather it's      they are all tin-pot dictators with one common goal to make our lives miserable in hopes that will vote for Joe Biden.
Liberal media outlets push "Yo Biden is super boring" in 5... 4... 3... oh oops, It's happening again already.
well Biden’s word play makes him sound stupid 🤣
Yes, both Biden/Harris are big supporters of late term baby killing.
Who do you think supported Bernie? They seemed like mostly Warren folks. Their frustration w Biden was largely his hiding from the media and refusing to do an interview with them despite the fact that they worked together.
Looks like the postal service is in the bag for Biden! Screw mail in ballots, go in person wear a mask, and show an identification. We can go to the liquor store, Walmart, Home Depot, and the Post Office. You certainly can go to the ballot box on November 3rd.
Biden Clinton and Obama all support the war in iraq
Tbh she’s gonna get dragged for being so outspoken about sexual assault and Biden’s been accused of that... that’s my main thing
Someone keep the receipt ITT for our proof of collective voter voices

He’s also writing in Bernies name. He said “Hcan’t support Biden Harris because they don’t support Medicare for all.” Hes a moron.

Well, I hope Biden is running a campaign to win the electorate as it exists. But we'll see.  Anyway, sorry you're mad Bernie lost, but he only lost because not enough people voted for him. A bummer for many people, sure, but nothing sinister.

They lose billions per quarter thanks to Republican sabotage. Vote the anarchists out Biden/Harris 2020🇺🇲
I’m so surprised and happy G*ga isn’t backing Biden like she backed Hilary.
Lol Joe Biden listens to whatever the DNC tells him
Kamala Harris is the most recent of a long line of Black heroines, write Ella Bell Smith and Connie Hale.   "We [see in] Harris an example of qualities that research tells us are prerequisites for all successful female leaders: grit, influence and grace."
But it fundamentally in conflict with laying the groundwork for calling for mass demonstrations when Trump tries to steal the election. Trump is already prepping his supporters  for conflict - I don't know how Biden pivots to calling for mass demonstrations.
The "I'm going to make things calm and normal again" message is how Biden won the primary. It's probably the right tactic to maximize the number of people who vote for him in November.
I don't listen every week,  I've missed  a lot of episodes, but I agree w/ you. Unless I'm mistaken, most or all the hosts worked w/ Biden at the WH since they were part of Obama's '08 campaign &amp; worked at WH. They like Biden. Obnoxious for member of JB's staff to give that quote
it's isn't just children who are at risk, #JoeBiden's wayward mouth and sick head could put us all in danger #MakeAmericaSafeAgain
I jokingly asked my mom who she was voting for. Her legendary response: "If Biden chose a hamster for his VP running mate, I would still vote for him."

Trump can’t win Florida.  See2/3 Most say it is a good thing. One dares to say, "Anticipating a potential Joe Biden victory in November, Netanyahu may have had second thoughts about large-scale annexation," in some effort to bestow some credit on the man in the Delaware bunker.

If Joe Biden becomes president then Hillary Clinton will call in a suicide strike on Joe Biden. I can see it now, it will be labeled as an overdose that was brought on by dementia and just for good measure he will have shot himself 3 times in the back of the head.
Does this guy even know that his dislike for President Trump and voting for Biden will lead to the socialization and open borders of our Country? I remember when he used to be a solid conservative as a congressman.  #FoxNews
You must feel so dirty when you tweet about Joe Biden knowing that he has dementia and he’s a pedophile. If I were you I would start praying for absolution now.
Now would be a great time to make a donation to the Biden/ Harris campaign!!!!!
Now that is Slow Biden has picked his running mate Kabbalah Harris, we will now see all of the trash about her coming out and how much of a terrible prosecutor she was, but Joe can’t remember all of that he’s lucky if he can remember how to tie his shoes.

2/3 Cassidy concludes: "Trump and the viewers of 'Triggered' and 'The Right View' won’t concede of their own accord. Between now and November 3rd, Biden and his supporters will have to go all out to defeat them. Complacency isn’t an option."

Of course he did. He's afraid to go to jail if he loses his Presidency (refer to the Articles of Impeachment earlier this year). Vote Biden or else we can see a dictatorship in the near future.

the only reason black people still support Joe Biden it because organizations like NPR refused to tell them that the reason their father brother and Uncle were in jail because of laws Joe Biden crafted and then incubated to get passed.
Exactly why Dems no matter how bad they are have gotten the black vote since the 60’s. Joe “If you don’t vote for me you ain’t black” Biden was just saying what a lot of Dem politicians believe. Don’t criticize the flaws just vote for them and shut up

whose going to win the presidential election 2020. Ask   COVID-19. Like everyone says ask the virus whom the virus vote for. Trump vs Biden. COVID-19 already picked up the winner. Last time Russia sided with Trump. Let’s see COVID-19 does the same.
Joe Biden isn’t even a little bit racist or sexist. On your side, oh boy.

We lack a consistent national policy on treating COVID-19. I suggest the 50 US governors get together and create a consistent, uniform policy on treating this pandemic. Please support VP Biden's call for a national mask mandate implemented by governors as you've already done.

is failing on the job and also in his attempt to make Joe Biden look old, tired, and sleepy. Trump is the candidate who,not only appears to be getting senile and clumsy in his gate ,but also slurring a d mispronouncing simple words in most people's lexicon. Loser

Hello its me, the radical left, we lost the nomination when Bernie dropped out and he was our compromise candidate, we think biden is a racist conservative asshole and most of us aren't voting because of it.   You can relax now. "nothing will fundamentally change"
but then, the DP  'suppressed' the vote by changing and discarding SANDERS' votes to name Biden as the nominee.
I think a Harris/Biden administration will likely double the impact.
Yep. It won’t be a good thing. It’ll hurt people but maaaaybe it’ll cause a huge influx of donations to the Biden campaign. But Trump’s base will love it. :(
Tax reductions seem unlikely given the enormous fiscal response to the Covid-19 business disruptions. Biden’s tax plan offers a glimpse of what we may be facing in 2021 and beyond.

I’d say!  &amp; Biden-Harris isn’t answer.
Right, but I was assuming based on probabilities that they're thinking Biden wins but opts not to run again. Which is Not? Good? And it's weird how anyone who mentioned it was called an ageist crank.
You know the amazing thing about this poll? Where's Biden? Why are we assuming that Biden's not going to be there in four years, running? And the contingent possibilities of Biden running again in 4 years with a potential left challenger are...interesting.

Meaning....Biden &amp; Harris will bring the backing of science &amp; education &amp; leadership once again to the country.
this is a controversial opinion but i dont actually think trump has a chance at being reelected. i know biden is worthless but i dont think it even matters at this point
The idea of trusting Andrew Yang to deliver an unprecedented comprehensive civilizational overhaul for the U.S. economy, government, and society, but then second-guessing him on a 2020 Biden endorsement is just . . .

It sure is!  In January, Biden and Harris will begin the difficult task of repairing all the damage you did.  They'll work hard to fight Trump Virus, not ignore it like you do.  166,000 deaths!
None. At least Biden can read complete sentences. The Trump cannot conplete a sentence even reading it.
After Biden is sworn in on January 21, Kavanaugh should by thoroughly investigated.  Very thoroughly!

She basically called Joe Biden a rapist &amp; racist she has no integrity and Joe is a pedophile the Dems are making me vote Trump.
It might be a waste of time to try to nudge the biden administration in a less psychopathic direction, but I can't fault her for trying. I mean the hell else is she going to do? become a republican?

Biden is one up on Bill Clinton. Joe has his “Monica”, kamala, in the next office to his office. No need to sneak her in the side door after hours
I’m getting real tired of genuine Biden supporters. I and many others are gonna vote for him, but nobody has to like it.
If Biden loses, the moderate few will not supplant the extremist many; the rhetoric of the DLC will not trump the policies of the DNC. If Trump loses, the RNC will cut its losses; Republicans will then campaign as “conservatives,” and govern like Romney, Ryan, and Rubio.
She should be in the hot seat, not Biden.
Poison in the air and water? That’s terrible. I guess that’s what happens when you have 30 years of uninterrupted Republican Administrations. This would have been avoided if only Obama-Biden had won in 2008.

This is a pretty lame clip to keep pushing. Everyone knows the guy has a stutter. So he meant poor black kids have the same talent as poor white kids. I’m not saying Biden and pols like him haven’t  been part of the problem - but the first step in real change is dumping Trump
Tulsi Gabbard &amp; Bernie would of beaten trump. But tulsi can’t be controlled so she can’t be a real candidate for the left. In reality that base combined is HUGE. Democrats got greedy chosing Hillary over Bernie. Now..where is Biden’s base? &amp; when was it ever bigger than Bernies?
She wasn't my top choice, but I think she's a good choice for Biden.

He will be trespassing, after all.  He should be removed by force, if he refuses to leave willingly.  Once Biden is sworn in, trump has no more right to be there than I do.
As if anyone had to work to undermine Biden. This is some real Liberal Qanon stuff.
Totally. But yes, exactly about the shortlist. This is Biden, who no one (I know) has high expectations of. Why would our expectations of who his VP pick be so high? I was just relieved it wasn’t Whitmer, who likely would have lost him MI because she has turned her back on Flint.
i’m curious how many people are going to not vote now because biden picked kamala harris as his VP?
The trump Biden debates are gunna be legendary funny though, only good thing out of all this
Were progressives complaining about Harris looking at Biden’s shortlist? Pretty sure they wouldn’t have been happy with anyone (except maybe Warren), so I really don’t get the up-in-arms indignation.
Wear it like a badge from moron King Con Don and The Greed New Deal #nastywoman #kingCONdon #fake #fraud Fake eCONomy        #biden #kamala
😂😂😂😂 The Biden/Harris team is going to bury you.  All your weak and childish verbal assaults will mean nothing.  They care about people.  You care about you.
She’ll dump on Biden after his first few mistakes and she can show how incompetent he is. Then she is a shoe-in for the remainder of the term
Radical left? I know you’d love to play that card but that’s impossible with a Joe Biden/Kamala Harris ticket. These two are the most centrist candidates of the bunch. Painting them as radical left will just make you look sillier.
Joe Biden is a racist that helped elect our first black president and announced a black woman as his VP? Stop projecting and get over yourself. Cherry picking quotes that sound racist just to prove your point, sad! He also gave all Americans, including Black people healthcare.
You old sack of potatoes, the suburban housewife??? what the hell??? We are strong, fierce, smart warriors and we want you OUT!!! You are the worst person on the planet!!!!! VOTE BIDEN/HARRIS 2020💙🙏
Be well and heal quickly so you can dance in the street when Biden/Harris win in November
I don't now.  just said Kamala Harris is a far-left Democrat ... That Biden is signaling his administration would be going in that direction as well, vs. Clinton, who signaled centrist direction by choosing Al Gore.
I challenge you to name a Democrat other than Tulsi Gabbard of whom you would not have said their selection moved the Biden campaign further left.
Biden Harris, one is a  bigoted old man and one is willing to sleep with the  bigoted old man to get ahead. For America!
But hey, tell me more about why I should love the ACÁ. And stop making this about Trump. My beef is with the Dems and Biden and Harris. If you don’t want that argument then move the fuck along.
I love that all of you end your discussions with this. No actual rebuttal, but a wish for people to suffer. Says a lot. You’ll be happy to know, I guess, that I’ll die of kidney failure and leave my family in debt while we wait for incremental change from Biden and Harris. 👍🏼
who cares? given all the horrific fucking things Biden believes and will actually do, I'd take a kooky new age wine mom with legit leftwing politics.
Dropping out mid race and endorsing the least progressive democratic candidate is definitely not something she as an actual progressive wanted to do and did so for the DNC. It's not exactly a secret that the DNC wants establishment democrats like Clinton or Biden to win.

I'm not blaming Warren I think if he chose her he would actually have a chance i just think its hilarious that she was the only other real option besides biden or Bernie and biden fucked her even after all she did for his campaign.
Trump will win 2020 because Biden chose Harris
Harris as VP choice is a massive slap in the face to anyone who hoped for Medicare for All, anyone supporting trans rights, judicial and policing reform, and anyone who hoped that Biden would make any overtures to progressives. Fuck!
That’s very bad news for Biden!  If Trump is only 3pts behind Biden in Minnesota at this junction of the race, he’s poised to win the state of Minnesota in November ... which means Trump will defeat Biden handily for the Presidency.
Biden has already accepted the invitation to all three debates. Trump has not.   This is fake news.
YES. I also think Kamala is a step in the right direction in putting more liberal politicians in places of power which is why I’m a bit more optimistic. She’s not ideal but she’s more left than Biden and Trump obviously.
If youre getting fired up to vote for Biden rn you still have a soft spot on your head
kamala harris was not my first, second, or third choice but would she be a hell of a lot better in a position of power than trump? YES. and that in itself is reason enough to vote for her and biden. (note that she votes on par with bernie in the senate)
for those of you who need to hear this:  TAKING THE MORAL HIGHROAD AND NOT VOTING FOR BIDEN/HARRIS DOES NOTHING BUT PREVENT PROGRESS + ENABLE FURTHER DESTRUCTION TO THE COMMUNITIES YOU CLAIM TO VALUE  swallow your pride and recongnize your privilege.
i’m not 100% on her but she does have a liberal track record in the senate and she’s smart so i’m hoping she’ll help keep senile joe in line. also it would be symbolic to have a woman vp. but it‘s really bad timing on Biden’s part to pick a VP involved in criminal justice...
Yes. Biden-Harris
Trump. Biden. Or the iceberg.   I'll take the iceberg for 1200 Alex.
nah im planning on voting for biden. in the grand scheme of things id rather him than trump and like there is no goof answer or course of action in a broken system
I mean, I’m holding my nose and voting for Joe Biden of all people. That I don’t like his vp isn’t gonna stop this leftist from voting out the fascist. (We can work on educating the capitalists in the meantime &amp; afterwards :) )
Biden helped create yhe criminall justice disaster we have today and harris supported it during the 2010's.    When will people stop just accepting people like these.  Racism will be swept under the rug. Democrats just want it out of the view so they can say its all fine.
Can’t believe Biden chose Quibi as his running mate
Counting the hours until to VP debate!!! Sooo excited for Biden/Harris!!!
One last thing, a vote for Joe Biden and Kamala Harris is a vote for an actual functioning White House cabinet, a couple potential Supreme Court seats, and the chance for a blue Congress that will actually get shit done.
I would kill for a Bernie Sanders &amp; Stacey Abrams Democratic ticket. But Biden and Harris is a start in the right direction in history.
Don't waste your breath.  Looks like Biden/Harris is a done deal with more enthusiasm than the first moon landing.  The Republican party is beyond repair, it's dead.  Face it, people are fed up with the criminal enterprise that's destroying our country.

Super happy dance! She was my first choice for president so having her on the ticket makes me very happy. It also shows that Biden is neither petty nor vindictive and has the strategic ability and character to be a great president.
So excited! I wanted Kamala for president but this is the next best choice because it means she'll almost certainly be president someday! It also shows that Biden is neither petty nor vindictive and has the character to be a true leader!
In a better world, Biden could point to how far he has come from the positions he once took. Harris being one example. He could go on about the trajectory of progress she represents, a stark contrast to Trump's reactionary politics.
I still don't think it'll change the minds of a lot of voters but it could... Now I'm just really hoping Biden can stay healthy for a full term. For some reason I'm reminded of John McCain choosing Sarah Palin.
It's phony progressivism at its finest. Early on when I heard Biden was going to choose a female VP, seemingly just for the sake of appealing to certain demographics, I realized the democrats could again set themselves up to fail. Kamala has as many skeletons as many in the GOP..
I’m riding with Biden!
Joe Biden selects Kamala Harris as his VP?  Why do I feel like Trump just got an advantage?
Biden should tweet out the Central Park Five.
oh boy a bad cop with a history of incarcerating blacks and recently called Biden a racist and sexual assaulter is now his VP.  As long as it's a woman tho.  to hell with character and honesty right? #liberal #doublestandard
The prospective 49th vice president of the United States would be a cabinet meeting away from becoming our 47th commander in chief. The transition would be smooth, with Kamala Harris walking (unassisted) into the Oval Office while an aide wheels Joe Biden into assisted living.
Hey, this is America. Kamala Harris obviously proves that Biden's:   1. a pandering neo-liberal racist   2. a crypto-fascist cop-lover  3. a weak, trojan-horse vessel the Squad will use to implement Anti-Jesus/Commun-islam.  ...simultaneously... 🤷🇺🇸
I think Biden is looking not at a game of geography but one of bringing in folks who don’t feel represented by the top of any ticket ever. It’s also a generational handover of sorts. I didn’t support either during the primaries but feel this was a solid pick.
Guess who's supporting Biden's pick? The one and only King 👑
Back in December, at dinner with friends, I predicted the ticket would be Biden/Harris.  No one believed me.
Finally some great news, Harris got picked for Vice President.   Vote Biden-Harris to get our country back from the worse 4 years I ever witnessed.
Hard to see when Biden is ok with policing shooting protesters and wants to increase police funding. When I read the words of racial justice leaders I see them saying that she’s changed far less of her opinions and policies over the years as she has changed her tactics

Absolutely. I doubt Biden will finish the first term if he wins.
hmm I don't think I'll be voting for the Biden/Harris ticket
And Biden is already adopting a lot of her plans and policies.
You’re the one saying they are the same. I never said that or insinuated it. They are very much not the same. Biden was not my first choice. But he is still a billion times better than the racist pig in the White House.
So I guess Kamala Harris doesn't think Joe Biden is a racist, anymore?
Joe Biden took on the challenge of making it as tough to vote for him as possible and fuck. It’s working
There is no way Biden is even close to as bad as Trump. NO WAY. At least he believes in science and doesn’t call women names (among other things).
I couldn't be happier about Biden's selection!  Congrats to all!  On to November 3rd and change the path of our beloved United States of America!

Biden-Harris, who could ask for anything better. Lets win and win big.
With Harris as VP, there is almost no conceivable way Warren won't be tapped for a cabinet position (AG or Treasury, most likely) if Biden wins.
Me to!  She was my pick.  Would have supported Biden with anyone he picked.

I was channel surfing &amp; stopped at FOX to listen to what pathetic Tucker Carlson had to say about the Joe Biden/Kamala Harris ticket. He is definitely a Clone of tRUMP;racist,insulting,dramaticPeople complain about CNN but they present both sides of the argument, unlike FAUX NEWS
You literally, in a nutshell, said that Joe Biden did what his accusers of sexual misconduct said he did. Now..you’re going to jump on his wagon? You are the worst martyr in modern time. Women look for successful women for motivation, and this is what you do. You’re a sad person
So..  do you no longer believe nor care about the sexual misconduct victims of Mr. Biden? Now, choosing to look the other way or just being the crooked politician that Democrats welcome with open arms? What a joke. Women must be proud. Disgraceful
By Andrea Widburg: It says a lot that Biden chose Kamala, and none of what it says is good
Joe Biden's selection of Kamala Harris as his vice presidential running mate is resonating with Black women.
With Biden's pick of Kamala Harris as his VP, Mike Pence must be nervous as a long-tailed cat in a room full of rocking chairs
That there should put fear in our hearts! You realize that she will be President within a year after they remove Joe Biden for dementia! Thank God he won’t’ win!
Using same analogy,you also said you believed Mrs Reid . So that would make VP Biden not qualified to run the highest office in the country right?  We expect equal treatment right?
Biden and Kamala can make this a better country but they can't stop some people from being idiots
Trump's Attempted Attacks On Kamala Harris Are All Over The Place. Because he’s an asshole.
I'm pumped for Biden /Harris! Who's with me?
Check out this link to a USA Today story in photos of California Sen. Kamala Harris' career. Joe Biden chose Harris Tuesday to be his pick to run for vice president on the Democratic Party ticket for president.
Coons as soon as they seen Biden picked Kamala Harris as if that does anything for our people 😂😴😴
congratulations. I am so proud of you. I will supporting you against Donald trump and Mike Pence who better watch out you got this Kamala I have your Back Biden/Harris 2020
If Tulsi was the VP pick...I would be 100% with Biden. Such a shame. After watching Tulsi on J.Rogan I really thought she would rocket to top of the party. Instead, they said she was a Russian puppet 😂I don't agree with all her opinions, but she seemed level headed &amp; intelligent
Donald J Tramp just shit his depends when he found out that Biden named Kamala Harris as VP choice
You will have an important role to play within the Biden-Harris administration I’m sure. You are too smart, talented and valuable to leave out. Well done, you as always.
She destroyed biden in the last debate, she hates his old ass. Wonder why she said yes?
Say what you want,  is one of the most reliably progressive members of congress, and she's bringing the Biden ticket with her. I am happy about this news.
BIDEN - HARRIS. I AS HAPPY AS A PIG ROLLING IN MUD. I CAN'T WAIT FOR KAMALA HARRIS TO SWEEP THE FLOOR WITH  N  THIS GIRL IS TOUGH AND FEARLESS. SO HAPPY WITH  'S PICK. I CAN'T WAIT FOR HER DEBATING PENCE IN THE COVID19 TASK FORCE RESPONSE !!!!!
But we already knew this...
Kamala Harris Is Joe Biden's Pick For Vice President 😊

I heard it’s Tony Hawk! The left was so exited to see Biden ride a bike he said come on man let’s get a skater on the ticket that will surely show diversity!
If you live in a city where Antifa is destroying everything in it’s path, or in one soon to be, if Trump is still in office he will help if you ask, Biden won’t. It depends on what you want for your family.🇺🇸💪
Thank you soon to be President Biden!
This lady is almost as senile as Biden. Never has a thought for herself, just shit talk at other people.  how about you generate a pure thought of your own and maybe people would give a shit about you.

And the GOP ENEMIES OF DEMOCRACY wants to sell the idea, that  is too old to be president. Compare any of  latest speeches to the elephant genius. You see who's incoherent and lying and who's lucid, refresh and full of life  is gone take him to the cleaners
Right now the media I believe is just as scared as many Americans of what this country will be like if Trump wins again. Biden isn't the long-term answer. But he's a big improvement over Trump in my opinion. You can argue that if you'd like. But I'll stand by my word.

Joe Biden had eight years under Obama to build back better. What did he do,  nothing. They said that it would take a magic wand to bring back job's and the economy. Well it takes a person who understands how business works and that was Trump. Who do you trust .
LMAO you saw him on tv for all of 30 seconds bike riding. I can't believe you actually think Biden's got a chance to win.
The evidence of a very big conflict of interest in Joe Biden having Giuliani fired when Giuliani is looking in to corruption his son is working for and getting paid $50 thousand a month. As if that isn't the definition of quid pro quo.
Did Joe Biden say on national TV when he was VP that if Ukraine doesn't fire the Giuliani he was going to withhold a billion $ in aid? Yes he did. Was Giuliani looking in to corruption in Burisma? Yes he was. Was Hunter on the Board of Burisma? Yes he was.

Biden,  Kamala Harris better start looking for another running mate because the Federal government is about to send indictments to the Obama administration including Joe Biden for the illegal activities that were made trying to get Hillary Clinton elected.  #KAG VOTE4TRUMP
Chairman Biden and emperor's Harris will be right at home with the CCP.They've already started using some of the policies of Chairman Mao Zedong. Next thing they'll have the gov. to start distribution of quotations from Chairman Mao Zedongs little Red Book . We're in for it
FYI Joe Biden does things to help his son's investments like telling Ukraine to fire the lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani that was looking in to Burisma and their dirty dealing. Hunter was on the board of Burisma. Talk about quid pro quo.
the FBI  attorney that falsified documents to spy on Trump is making a deal with the Fed's in order to get a lesser sentence.  A "chain" is only as strong as its weakest link. If I was Obama-Biden I would start looking for a good attorney because you'll need one.
Yes voter disenfranchisement is a problem. However the reason people don't vote is because they think both parties are the "same" which is a lie meant to suppress young people from voting. If a young person can't tell the difference between Biden and Trump then the lie worked.
Americans will be imprisoned or fined for failure to comply with face protection. While murder, looters rob private businesses,  Biden-Hariri are showing no concern for the anarchy.  But defunding the police and saying, be tough on crime, these two are in conflict
I didn't support Biden but now that he is nominee I do... If Markey was running against Trump I would wholeheartedly support Ed.
Kamala is not going to be the reason Biden wins or loses.  comes down to Covid  Dems and Repubs have monetized Covid 19; why would Big Corporations want to give up that funding?
If only our fantasy league got as much attention from you as Biden and Fabolous do...
Biden said the travel ban was xenophobic and he wouldn’t have closed the borders. Democrats advocated large crowds for Chinese New Year, they still advocate for large crowds and rioting? How would you have prevented it? Locking it up for marijuana possession?
We can’t have it both ways. We can’t say Biden can’t remember his own name AND plagiarized something from 30 years ago. He isn’t writing his speeches or they’d read “C’mon man! This is um um um how the hell did I get p-p-pudding in my knig-nig-knickers?! K-K-K-Kamala man!”

Susan Rice made the most sense for Biden’s VP Pick, but my money says Susan Rice is one of the names that’s going to be torched by Durham and they didn’t want the controversy. Obviously I don’t KNOW that, but I truly believe she will be scapegoated.
Could anyone get sucked off this good?! I was waiting for the money shot. 🤦🏽‍♂️ Is this what we have to look forward to? This R the type of questions asked of Biden or Harris? When it comes to Trump the media wants to bare knuckle brawl. What happened to journalism?

What do you Hannity groupies think is behind his recent, obviously conscious, decision to refer to Biden and Obama by their first names -- and now Harris. Just really peculiar. Any theories?
I didn't listen to your dang cause I assumed it wasn't about me. Lol I mean I hate Joe Biden and Kamala Harris but I don't think Bernie's a sell out he's doing what he believes is right just as I am voting for those assholes.
Can someone please shut up  ? She’s bat shit crazy
This is like kind of unacceptable. Have you lived through the same last 3.5 years I have? If you have then I ask... ARE YOU KIDDING ME?!?  Anything other than a vote for Biden is a vote for Trump. Get it together.
I think if Biden gets Ohio &amp; GA he got ME-2.
Biden,  Harris  soon will be advocating incarceration and fines for failure to conform  with society. They were worried that Trump would be dictating as he sat in the OVAL office. But it turns out that its been the democrats all along. Its up to us to stop them
Biden,  asked America for a national mask wearing. But while requesting this they weren't wearing a mask. Hypocrisy coming from hypocrites
The existence of the electoral college makes all the voting discourse hilarious to me. Biden is winning my state regardless of what I do.
Woah you are not about to say that when Joe Biden's campaign is literally vote for me because I'm not Trump. Like my fucking God the irony. I'm voting for that piece of shit but you guys need to stop acting like he isn't shit and is god's gift to Progressives and the left
Oh how quickly people forget, in 2008 this Country was a total mess and Obama and Biden came into a mess. They fixed General Motors, Wall Street, housing mortgage problems. They got us out of a disaster that once again the Republicans got us into. Kamala did much for CA
That’s a big fat lie and you know it. Never did She ever accused Biden of such things!
I can’t wait to see you campaigning. I see the Smiling side of you and it’s Sweet, now I want to see The Stern side as we elect the Biden Harris Presidency. (Put your seat belt on)
If Bernie and Warren are at fault for anything, it was not having a plan pre-primary for how to still unify when things inevitably get tough and heated, or when one of them has a heart attack while the other just passed Biden in the polls in the same week.
Thing I’ve been telling myself to deal with the fact there was every logical reason to pick Warren: A Biden to Warren admin would never be the Warren presidency she or we wanted bc she wouldn’t have the mandate of being elected on her own platform. She’s free to be herself.
, no matter how she got to the top, some say that she had affairs with her boss. That's up for debate. But the fact that she's here is a threat to the way of life as we know it if Joe Biden gets elected. Higher taxes, open borders, and everything else. #KAG
Apparently they also want to tear down the Empire State building. A dastardly duo.
It collapsed already Biden &amp; Harris will rebuild America... The damage you have done resembles an earthquake...
idk now i ain’t realize this dweeb was biden’s running mate

People wonder about this country’s shortcomings. Then I see videos of people crying about Kamala Harris being chosen as Biden’s VP. They obviously don’t know about her record as a senator, much less anything before that. So being a female is more important than her achievements.
The GOP is pushing for Kanye west to be registered in a swing state to siphon off votes from the Biden campgain causing trump to have a win and a potential Biden state
Kamala Harris never called a biden a racist. In fact she specifically remarked at a presidential debate “I do not believe you are a racist” after she addressed his opposition to busing in the 70s.
Harris said she believed 3 women (not Reade) who claim Biden inappropriately touched or kissed them. It does not fall under the legal definition of sexual misconduct, however I do believe it’s inappropriate. Trump thinks it’s ok to grab women by “the pussy”.
"Biden and Harris remember Beau Biden in their first remarks together as running mates"
Here is actual data of the effect the Crime Law has on incarcerations. The drastic increase was due to state laws, not Biden’s law.
4. Biden wrote the Violence Against Women Law which imposes harsher penalties for domestic violence and rape offenders., the 10yr Assault Weapon Law, and the “Safety-Valve” the relieved some inmates from the mandatory 3 strikes provision.
1. The Crime Bill is a federal statute &amp; cannot be enforced at state level. Only a few states actually adopted harsher penalties. 95% of inmates are in state prisons, not federal. 2. Biden opposed the 3 three strike mandatory life sentence in 94 &amp; now.

I would actually enthusiastically vote for Biden then 🤷🏿‍♂️😅
A whole speech and not one mention of bleach, I don’t think Biden can pull this off
I’ll admit Trump’s treatment of women is deplorable and disgusting and there’s no room for it anywhere in this world. Can you say the same about Biden? Will you condemn him for it?
You missed the point. I’m not defending Trump, I’m implying you’re a hypocrite. Biden may not have as many accusations, but he has them too. My money says you’ll have no problem voting for Biden though, which makes you a hypocrite.
Wow, Biden is boring and Trump is destroying Biden in followers.  Good to know. Biden is second in another category.
Let's skip the debate with presidential candidates because you're worried people might figure out Biden is deranged.  I'm not a Trump fan and I can tell you don't want a debat because Trump would eviscerated Biden.  Just come out of your echo chamber and admit you lost already.

For how stupid the Biden campaign is, I actually totally believe it. Though if Biden has stronger convictions he wouldn’t let a gaffe get in the way of course of going for substantive change.
So we lost having an eventual president that believes in single payer, a wealth tax, student debt cancellation and an overhaul of Washington corruption and Wall St because Biden made another stupid gaffe. Big structural wtf.

Jim Polito Daily Poll: How will Kamala Harris impact the Biden campaign?
Trump clearly has dementia. He can't complete a sentence. Biden does not have dementia and has served in the senate and as VP with no problems. You are delusional if you think tRump and his adolescent tactics are going to work this time around. He's losing his base.
Innocent thought? There’s nothing innocent about hiding the DNC elected leader has full blown dementia. If they cared about the country they’d pick a different candidate. Biden the politician is dead and Trump’s the coroner who will call his TOD. Just like he did with US politics
Biden stands a decent chance of winning now that he's kissed the ring on the k-hive. Which is great for me because now he DEFINITELY doesn't need my vote! I can write in Yang or cast it for Howie Hawkins without losing any sleep. Honestly this shit was over for me months ago.
It wasn’t because she was being courteous or whatever to Warren, that was some bs. Biden had it in the can and she was just playing the field as she does.
If Biden didn’t have the courage to stand up to Wall St and make her VP he won’t have it to make her secretary of treasury.

Not to insert myself into the national conversation. But you have to wonder if Joe Biden would have chosen differently if Elizabeth Warren had bothered to be on the Bax &amp; O’Brien Show. I say no. But maybe I’m just being too modest.
He got my ass but he isn’t a sexual predator like Biden is right?

One word: Benghazi. It’s irrational, but I think it would have ultimately hurt us. I really do like her though, and I’m sure there’s a place for her elsewhere in the Biden Administration!
Wow. Nice pick Joe.
I'd be tweeting more about Harris, but for the #mapoli Chernobyl we're living through, except to say politically Biden won't lose votes with Harris, which is frankly the only consideration. Nobody would gain him more. Harris will be fine.
Harris, now the American people will hear why the both of you haven't condemned the violence that's plagues all the major cities. Not one democratic leader has spoken up against the violence.  WE'LL SEE AND HEAR YOU ABOUT THE VIOLENCE

The point is when he loses people have to pay back those taxes under a Biden administration and he will say I told you Biden would raise your taxes when it was his doing in the first place.
Bernie could have gotten behind Warren when she had surpassed Biden (which Bernie never managed to do) and had a heart attack at the same time. Instead he fought back for nothing.
Even if Warren had dropped earlier Bernie still wouldn’t have won because the majority of her supporters that Bernie hadn’t already peeled off from her didn’t have Bernie as a 2nd choice. At that point she was taking more votes from Biden. Move the fuck on.

I will give you he is ignorant of religion. But Biden is an evil man. If you look at his son the fruit dosnt fall to far from the tree. He learned that behavior from good ol dad. I have my suspicions about Biden’s virtues.
But I’ll take higher debt and keep my guns and religion and not murder babies so Biden who claims to be catholic (a religion that notorious for pedaphiles and gangsters) and  is pro choice so yah I can see where Trump might make that assumptionMe when biden announced it ha!!🤣🤣

I think the body language and rhetorical roles in those debates was telling &amp; likely by design.  Biden was on the periphery bringing the others back on topic when things we’re getting testy.
There goes Biden’s chance in hell of winning 👍
Congrats on your naivety that Biden and the Billionaires he’s indebted to are going to bring substantive change to that
You cant make this stuff up, it wooldnt be believed...
If Biden is the candidate that most aligns with your values, then it was a wise primary vote for you. Personally, I value healthcare, social justice, corporate accountability, etc...
Not true. Now do Biden..
Don’t blame you.  I’d wait until Biden is sworn in to open.
Joe Biden is the bus that Kamala Harris will use to run over our country
I get it. No one is happy with me about it (wife included). I promised myself early on that Id vote for any candidate other than Biden or Bloomberg. I refuse to accept that we have to be basic b’s in America with a 2 party system. The dem platform just doesn’t speak to me anymore
Her words and behavior? Thats the qualifications? Ok..Now do Biden...
History is filled with great leaders making alliances with former rivals.  Woodrow Wilson picking William Jennings Bryan for Secretary of State.  JFK and Lyndon Johnson.  Eisenhower and Earl Warren.  Despots kill rivals.  Great leaders form alliances.  Biden - Harris.
Biden’s call for mandatory face mask for 3 months is a joke and shows how deperate he is for a headline while he continues to pander to any and all in search of votes no matter what the repercussions. Really sad. He doesn’t have an original thought.
what a phoney Kamala Harris is. She is a poor choice for VP that Joe Biden was forced by the left of the party to nominate. It will cost him any chance for election as America will see right through her. She’s an attack dog only. Period
Is it okay if my take on Biden picking Kamala Harris is that I don’t give a shit?
I had tears listening to both Biden and Harris .. they weee so refreshing
Only ones creating problems are the dems and rinos, I don't see Republicans rioting,looting in the name of a criminal,stop your BS,biden hasn't done crap in his entire political career
When Biden announces his VP pick.
As long as the mainstream media parrots it back (you know they won’t challenge him) both Biden and Harris will continue to lie or just make stuff up.
How about you and you’re Ilk apologize to Joe and Jill Biden for the scurrilous and unfounded claims leveled at him by you and  on behalf of Tara Reade and we’ll call it even Krystal? A cold day in hell? That’s what I thought.
Ok so as someone who thought Biden was going to do 1 term, it would seem to me that the Harris pick suggests I was wrong. If he’s gonna do 1 term, he would have a VP running for the Dem nomination for his entire term. He doesn’t want that. Just a thought.
Huh, the news media shows Biden, but not Trump. #Biasnews?

Biden can read and won’t eliminate intelligence briefings. He would’ve had an immediate, appropriate response to C-19. Anyone who is ok with putting their health, safety &amp; security in the hands of this incompetent Putz is just as mentally ill as he is. You’re sad.
Yes.  Historically bad.  Take a look at record, her own view of Joe Biden during the primary run...
Isn't Biden Catholic???
Don't worry, when Henry isn't posting racist stuff about Kamala, he's posting about Hunter Biden conspiracies in Ukraine.  Seems like a real straight shooter.
Does Kamala Harris as VP increase the chances 2016 Trump voters vote for Biden?
Yea, just like Hillary right? Why are you guys so naive. Biden isn't winning shit Its obvious they control the narrative Trump is winning by a landslide. So many people were democrats and after this whole blm antifa shit they've come out and stated they will vote for Trump.

The energy, optimism and excitement surrounding Biden picking Kamala Harris reminds me a lot of when Trump picked Pence.
Honestly, I’m not thrilled that the democratic ticket is Biden/Harris. I really wish Bernie would have been the nominee. BUT. I will happily support Biden &amp; Harris if it means getting rid of the joke we currently have in office.
You’re absolutely right. Knowing it’s the Biden/Harris ticket, it will be Trump in a landslide.

oh goody, a cop. you really had to pick a fucking cop. good on you, Biden.
I like the Biden VP pick
I genuinely think that this pick strengthens the ticket. It take a very niche kind of person to get pushed from Biden to Trump at this point.
Biden succumbs to left and goes Kamala. Good luck with that. Biden-Harris is a losing ticket. She’s nothing but an attack dog because Joe can’t. No one want’s a potential of Harris Presidency.
Kamala- not good enough to be the Dems’ frontrunner. But plenty good enough to takeover when Biden is inevitably relieved of duties due to the blatant mental inadequacies? I struggle to understand why the Dems’ don’t just pick a presidential candidate to collectivey rally behind.
It's  Good pick. I took these during her presidential campaign swing through Portsmouth, NH in February, 2019.  #election2020
Joe Biden is taking so long to announce his VP because it’s taking this long for his staffers to explain to him that he is not the VP, he is running for President
What if Biden is announcing a large portion of his cabinet with the VP announcement?! That would be great!
Why Trump is unlikely to pull off an election surprise against Biden like he did with Clinton
It’s going to be a woman of color. You can guarantee that. Biden’s camp doesn’t want to be fielding questions for the next 3 months on why, out of all the qualified WOC, he decided to go with the status quo. It would be suicide.
Biden’s main consideration, all along, has been for his VP to be someone who he trusts, is ‘Simpatico’ with, and someone who could slip into the job, if needed, on day 1. Foreign policy is a main consideration for the former Foreign Relations Comittee chairman, just a thought.
I was just thinking today about when  started to enter the conversation of those being considered for VP. Early on, she was not even mentioned and then all of the sudden her name began to drop in talks. I think this was strategic on the part of the Biden campaign.

Well Paula the President just slapped your bitch mouth shut. Go interview do nothing Biden who doesn’t have a cogent thougtnin his head.
I think Biden brought her to Delaware and is building up her name in order to help her in Michigan and for future endeavors. The actual choice has probably already been made, and kept very much under wraps. It’ll be a WOC, and deservedly so.
Joe biden said "She can have any role she wants".... then he's gon do this to her?
This is true. But remember how Trump got the nomination, with 35% of the Republican vote. If the moderates can coalesce around a ‘Biden’ like the D’a did around Bernie’s leftism, they can beat back another Trumpist.
Like Biden or Killary?

You won’t realize anything because they’ll be starting bad-faith attacks on Biden as soon as he’s declared the winner, led by the disingenuous Never Trumpers who may be worse than MAGAs themselves
My 2 republican uncles and aunt who are tired of Trump told me last week that they would vote for Biden if he picked harris. Would write in someone else if he picked rice. They think rice is hillary part 2 and  that she lied about benghazi...Shes too hawkish. ..
Remember Marine Corps (pronounced Corpse by Obama?  Not to mention countless gaffes by his Vice President.  We know why Biden does it though and it’s just sad.  Maybe Queen Botox prays for him nightly because she’s such a good Catholic.
Idk ab y’all but I don’t think just voting for Biden to “just get trump out” is smart. We shouldn’t be voting like that
It's just incredibly sad that right-wing nut jobs are using #Extortion17 in a bullshit attack on Biden.  Those soldiers deserve better.
That would leave Pence (who worries me greatly). I'd really like to see trump humiliated and emasculated with a resounding Biden victory. We will pay a very heavy price daily with trump in office....sigh.
Sources say Biden made his choice, tonight. I hope for a big Friday night announcement!
I don’t think it’ll be Whitmer. Biden doesn’t want African Americans, the left, and the media totally distracting the campaign with the ‘why didn’t you feel it necessary to pick a WOC’ question, especially with the BLM movement coming to the forefront this campaign season.
We deserve the president Fox News thinks Joe Biden is
Beware these Never Trumpers. Just want our help to get rid of Trump for them, but the second Biden’s in office they’ll be attacking him with garbage. Goal is 22 midterms. Don’t trust them for a second, they created the environment for Trump to swoop in.
These Never Trumper ghouls just want the D’s to get rid of Trump for them, &amp; the second Biden’s in office they go back on the attack full throttle to take back the House &amp; Senate in 22. It’s so disingenuous.
Should decline or halt should Biden wins..i will be one of the most happy people along with many others if joe biden wins :,) like i will forreal shed tears
If Biden wins, she will be President soon. Biden obviously has dementia, and not early stage.
Trump is so foolish that his supporters say he is not a politician as if that is a plus. That he does not use big words as if that is a plus. That he earns no salary as if it is true for this man steals like a monkey stealing a banana. Just unfit to be human

Okay. A: At his age, Biden can be forgiven for his mind defaulting to 1917 when using the ‘17 shorthand (likely more Freudian than anything), and B: Any fast talker, myself included, can tell you slurring your words is quite common when talking at certain speeds.
Um...Bernie is older than Biden.
I've already found a DC-area crash pad so nobody can claim I'm a vagrant. I'll be standing in front of the Capitol all day, every day, until President Biden is installed -- alone, if I'm alone there.
my goal is universal healthcare, avoiding climate catastrophe, and boosting an alternative to our two-party oligarchy.   i can understand voting for biden in a swing state, but beyond that, why should anyone support him as a candidate when howie is also in the race?
Steve it must have been a lot of calls, for a big Biden supporter like yourself, who is telling other people to do activism. Just let us plebes know how many calls you made so I have something to aspire to.
my one vote - can push the green party to 5%, where they can get millions in federal funding and become a major party cannot affect the outcome of biden winning my state by *literally* nearly a million votes  in safe states, voting blue/red is more of a waste than green, cmv
Biden Reaffirms His Hatred Of Medicare For All  via
That's when private prisons started, but it's not when incarceration skyrocketed.  That didn't happen until the 90's.  All of this is publicly available information.  Here's what Biden was doing during the Reagan years:
How are people planning to “hold Biden/Harris accountable”? Second question: how are people currently holding Trump accountable? And how’s that working out?
WE WILL!!!! I will be voting IN PERSON for Biden/Harris on November 3rd! I don’t care if I have to put on a hazmat suit and crawl through broken glass.
He did do a war on drugs thing...which was heavily pushed by your guy, Joe Biden.  Seriously.  You should look some of these things up.  Google can be your friend.
Fortunately Biden then advanced beyond 3rd grade, whereas trump's thought process and reading level never matured beyond primary grades.
Joe Biden came out yesterday making a proposal for a nationwide mask mandate. VP pick Kamala Harris came out to speak after saying "That's what real leadership looks like!". Is it? VB takes aim with this &amp; hears yours thoughts.   LISTEN:   #vbinthemiddle
Every one of the production assistants will be masked ??? Joe Biden insists
The one who wrote the '94 tough on crime bill?  Yes, he's responsible for the current prison industrial complex.  Look at incarceration rates before and after Biden's signature bill.  Democrats have been 'tough on crime' since the '90s.  Where have you been?
I would recommend your looking at  feed for plenty of articles about allegations against Joe Biden.  Regarding corruption, he's got 50 years of representing corporations in Congress.  There are plenty of articles like this one.
Obama and Biden looted SS years ago. Joe doesn’t remember that tho!
but does me backing that “real opponent” do anything? how does me voting for biden actually accomplish anything, other than throwing away a vote that could’ve gone towards a party and candidate that support medicare for all and saving the planet and people on it?
And that "strong woman" said her questioning him was political theater.  That's not strength.  Your VP is an authoritarian who has exploited the prison industrial complex that Biden helped establish.  She's trash.
Based on my read of the internet today, Trump is going to win re-election despite the fact that  1. Biden is ahead in every national poll, and in every swing state. Very clearly leading by a lot.  2. Trump is sabotaging the USPS and we all know about it 4 months in advance
He's probably one of the people who is flying with the Trump line that "if Biden gets elected, the stock market will crash". He's wrong tho, because even if trump doesn't manage to fix it, he won't leave. He's checking who in the military is loyal to him rn.
Good a better economy for Biden
“Trump’s view...was that Biden would prefer a candidate with Bass’s low national profile and one who wouldn’t outshine him.”  He's such a fucking narcissist he cannot imagine others thinking differently from himself.  via
Agreed.  If Tulsi and Yang cared about policy and being anti-corruption, then they would have endorsed Bernie.  Instead they both showed they don’t really care about the issues and backed Biden before Bernie dropped out.
Biden's healthcare plan is calling us fat individually
Yeah well, it happened in 2009.  Don’t believe everything Bernie and Biden spew for political points
Or put on your hazmat suit and show up in person.   It will be MUCH easier for them to game the count when there is no visible presence at the polls with Biden/Harris pins on their chests.
“Mike Pence Says He's Not Going To Let Biden And Harris 'Cut America's Meat'”  😂😂😂
Biden is going back to the suburbs to save your loveless marriage with a person who cheats on you. Trump is your physically abusive spouse who is addicted to Vicodin from a work injury he sustained 20 years ago and for which he blames the union.
“It doesn’t have to snowball,” said  “...But if the president is saying, ‘Stop. I think I won, where did these blue shift ballots come from?’ You could have this dispute spin out of control.”
We want all charges made to Trump and cronies when Biden in office so that they can’t be pardoned
How many times did you visit Epstein’s Fuck island Jim? How about the island next to it? That’s owned by Joe Biden.
You’re very presumptive , I’m choosing anyone but Biden , just like your mentality seems anyone but trump (you’re supporting a geriatric) ,I would prefer if  ran , then your head would really pop off ... as a Democrat think back to JFK speech and stop wanting handouts
Ok. You convinced me. I am going to vote for Biden/Harris
Biden’s numbers are better than those in those states. Wow the pressure is really getting to you to hedge and just never be able to be proved wrong ever.
I don’t think Biden is going to ban cheeseburgers or whatever, but I have done quite a bit of research on how much of the water in the American Southwest is diverted to cattle and cattle feed and oh boy is that gonna be a fuckin doozy for LA, Phoenix and Las Vegas soon enough.
Great propaganda , as a union member we were at 100% employment and busier than ever , not a video , I lived it.  I enjoy not paying 60% tax as proposed by Biden , and I like a candidate that doesn’t bail Antifa terrorists out of jail.
I hadn't really paid much attention the Kamela Harris before the selection as VP on the Biden ticket. However, there is nothing like Trump calling her a nasty foreigner that makes me instantly like her.
This is really a coup and has to be stopped. Does anyone out there have any way to stop this? What about Biden, Harris &amp; Democratic leadership? Are they planning their own legal actions and strategies to fight this assault on our electoral system and democracy?
Biden is already to the right of Romney and Bush on several issues, so...
Court documents seem to suggest that the idea to charge Flynn with violations of the Logan Act may have come from Joe Biden. That probably will not be good news for Biden’s 2020 campaign.
I mean I had hoped you say you stopped a little.   It's gonna be weird for your pride when the Harry Potter Warren people prevent more people from getting pushed into unmarked vans than you by electing Biden.
because in most states, like MA, biden is gonna win by 30%, nearly a million votes.  is there really any reason, in that situation, not to vote for the candidate that most closely aligns with my values?  personally, medicare for all is very much needed.
Comma-La, what is it like to play nursemaid to Old Joe Biden &amp; refrain him from racist outbursts?
give me one good reason to vote for biden in a deep blue (or red) state
Each state that has Cares Act surplus dollars from the bill can institute this process and short order and deficit spending will be reimbursed under the Biden Administration...Short term borrowing at very low interest rates now for 90 to 120 days.
Just like Killary you and your dad will not buy this election either. Sick of the Soros/ Clinton/Biden/Obama crime families f*cking with our country.  Ya heels up ain’t becoming VP either

Your reminder that Joe Biden will be the only Presidential candidate this year to have corresponded with Hannah Arendt:
We'd have seen even more of this in the primary if COVID-19 hadn't gifted the nomination to Biden.
I agree and cannot believe how many people discount Biden's staying power. Given what he has been through personally (like, really, it should make everyone stop in their tracks) I can't help but be in awe of his  resilience.

Liberal media outlets push "Yo Biden is super boring" in 5... 4... 3... oh oops, It's happening again already.
well Biden’s word play makes him sound stupid 🤣
Yes, both Biden/Harris are big supporters of late term baby killing.
Who do you think supported Bernie? They seemed like mostly Warren folks. Their frustration w Biden was largely his hiding from the media and refusing to do an interview with them despite the fact that they worked together.
Looks like the postal service is in the bag for Biden! Screw mail in ballots, go in person wear a mask, and show an identification. We can go to the liquor store, Walmart, Home Depot, and the Post Office. You certainly can go to the ballot box on November 3rd.

Lol Joe Biden listens to whatever the DNC tells him
Kamala Harris is the most recent of a long line of Black heroines, write Ella Bell Smith and Connie Hale.   "We [see in] Harris an example of qualities that research tells us are prerequisites for all successful female leaders: grit, influence and grace."
But it fundamentally in conflict with laying the groundwork for calling for mass demonstrations when Trump tries to steal the election. Trump is already prepping his supporters  for conflict - I don't know how Biden pivots to calling for mass demonstrations.
The "I'm going to make things calm and normal again" message is how Biden won the primary. It's probably the right tactic to maximize the number of people who vote for him in November.
I don't listen every week,  I've missed  a lot of episodes, but I agree w/ you. Unless I'm mistaken, most or all the hosts worked w/ Biden at the WH since they were part of Obama's '08 campaign &amp; worked at WH. They like Biden. Obnoxious for member of JB's staff to give that quote

And I will say also that—that in this campaign, we’ve also heard—and I’m going to now direct this to Vice President Biden. I do not believe you are a racist and I agree with you when you commit yourself to the importance of finding common ground.

Amen, the state made the Almighty smile a bit today. The Democrats who support the systematic government funded baby killing like Biden/Harris should not be voted for at all. The cries of millions of aborted babies scream for justice. Wake up America!

If "common sense" means abandoning attempts to finish sentences and "compassion" means playing a major role in almost every bad policy decision made by the US since the 70's, then, yeah, i guess vote biden??
Biden was a little boy with a debilitating stutter in a time before speech pathology was widely available. Of course he repeated a grade.  The fact that he was able to complete a graduate education is a testament to his will and determination.

Among plethora of reasons one very important reason was Biden wanted a “Black woman” has his running mate.   Kamala trying to fit the bill with her tenuous claim to being “Black woman” comes at the cost of effacing her “Indian” identity.  Only a racist like u will be ok with that

We have nothing to fear, but fear itself. This nonsense should spurn more resolve, and  stronger solidarity. We must first donate to The Biden Harris ticket with time, and dollars, then encourage the undecided to vote, and vote Blue! The future is now.
Okay. A: At his age, Biden can be forgiven for his mind defaulting to 1917 when using the ‘17 shorthand (likely more Freudian than anything), and B: Any fast talker, myself included, can tell you slurring your words is quite common when talking at certain speeds.
Um...Bernie is older than Biden.
I've already found a DC-area crash pad so nobody can claim I'm a vagrant. I'll be standing in front of the Capitol all day, every day, until President Biden is installed -- alone, if I'm alone there.

He did do a war on drugs thing...which was heavily pushed by your guy, Joe Biden.  Seriously.  You should look some of these things up.  Google can be your friend.
Fortunately Biden then advanced beyond 3rd grade, whereas trump's thought process and reading level never matured beyond primary grades.
Joe Biden came out yesterday making a proposal for a nationwide mask mandate. VP pick Kamala Harris came out to speak after saying "That's what real leadership looks like!". Is it? VB takes aim with this &amp; hears yours thoughts.   LISTEN:   #vbinthemiddle
Every one of the production assistants will be masked ??? Joe Biden insists
The one who wrote the '94 tough on crime bill?  Yes, he's responsible for the current prison industrial complex.  Look at incarceration rates before and after Biden's signature bill.  Democrats have been 'tough on crime' since the '90s.  Where have you been?
I would recommend your looking at  feed for plenty of articles about allegations against Joe Biden.  Regarding corruption, he's got 50 years of representing corporations in Congress.  There are plenty of articles like this one.
Obama and Biden looted SS years ago. Joe doesn’t remember that tho!
And that "strong woman" said her questioning him was political theater.  That's not strength.  Your VP is an authoritarian who has exploited the prison industrial complex that Biden helped establish.  She's trash.
He's probably one of the people who is flying with the Trump line that "if Biden gets elected, the stock market will crash". He's wrong tho, because even if trump doesn't manage to fix it, he won't leave. He's checking who in the military is loyal to him rn.
Good a better economy for Biden

Biden’s numbers are better than those in those states. Wow the pressure is really getting to you to hedge and just never be able to be proved wrong ever.
I don’t think Biden is going to ban cheeseburgers or whatever, but I have done quite a bit of research on how much of the water in the American Southwest is diverted to cattle and cattle feed and oh boy is that gonna be a fuckin doozy for LA, Phoenix and Las Vegas soon enough.
Great propaganda , as a union member we were at 100% employment and busier than ever , not a video , I lived it.  I enjoy not paying 60% tax as proposed by Biden , and I like a candidate that doesn’t bail Antifa terrorists out of jail.
This is really a coup and has to be stopped. Does anyone out there have any way to stop this? What about Biden, Harris &amp; Democratic leadership? Are they planning their own legal actions and strategies to fight this assault on our electoral system and democracy?
Biden is already to the right of Romney and Bush on several issues, so...

LMAO you saw him on tv for all of 30 seconds bike riding. I can't believe you actually think Biden's got a chance to win.
The evidence of a very big conflict of interest in Joe Biden having Giuliani fired when Giuliani is looking in to corruption his son is working for and getting paid $50 thousand a month. As if that isn't the definition of quid pro quo.
Did Joe Biden say on national TV when he was VP that if Ukraine doesn't fire the Giuliani he was going to withhold a billion $ in aid? Yes he did. Was Giuliani looking in to corruption in Burisma? Yes he was. Was Hunter on the Board of Burisma? Yes he was.
Last night on PBS Newshour, Fauci told Judy Woodruff that we need a "uniform and universal" commitment to mask-wearing. The Biden/Harris strategy reflects this call.
FYI Joe Biden does things to help his son's investments like telling Ukraine to fire the lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani that was looking in to Burisma and their dirty dealing. Hunter was on the board of Burisma. Talk about quid pro quo.
All I see from you is calling  some nasty names that are false! Show your proof! Trump banned Epstein from his properties after he learned of his cesspool of an Island. Trump has done so much good for America. He's definetly helped my family! Tell me what has Biden done for

No Biden is a sick child sniffer!
(True, but 65 points is a pretty broad black coalition. In the South, anyway - and Biden has a chance there this year.)  Hires like Karine Jean-Pierre are gonna go a long way to helping the young black vote, &amp; Biden is working on his Latino outreach.
Nah. Clyburn gave Biden SC, and it swiftly became clear that black voters weren't interested in Bernie, like, even a little bit. I mean, he lost Mississippi the next week by 65 points. Obama has a lot of weight and he surely helped clear the field, but come on.
You know, Joe wasn't even in my top dozen choices, but we have an actual fascist in charge. You know what they say about fascists? The second term is when they feel emboldened to do whatever they want.  I'm not voting for Biden out of loyalty. I'm voting to save the Republic.
Kamala Harris never called a biden a racist. In fact she specifically remarked at a presidential debate “I do not believe you are a racist” after she addressed his opposition to busing in the 70s.
Harris said she believed 3 women (not Reade) who claim Biden inappropriately touched or kissed them. It does not fall under the legal definition of sexual misconduct, however I do believe it’s inappropriate. Trump thinks it’s ok to grab women by “the pussy”.
Here is actual data of the effect the Crime Law has on incarcerations. The drastic increase was due to state laws, not Biden’s law.
4. Biden wrote the Violence Against Women Law which imposes harsher penalties for domestic violence and rape offenders., the 10yr Assault Weapon Law, and the “Safety-Valve” the relieved some inmates from the mandatory 3 strikes provision.
1. The Crime Bill is a federal statute &amp; cannot be enforced at state level. Only a few states actually adopted harsher penalties. 95% of inmates are in state prisons, not federal. 2. Biden opposed the 3 three strike mandatory life sentence in 94 &amp; now.
I mean, if Trump and Biden BOTH want to bow out, I'm cool with that.

Let’s be clear  —  is a Rhodes scholar compared to dim witted Donald trump. He is also smarter and has sharper mental faculties than both you and trump. He will shred dumb Donald on the debate stage and would take you apart as a bonus .
Biden has reason to get into a back and forth “he said , he said” with trump every day. And daily “gotcha” grillings from the media don’t educate the voters about policy and principles. Frankly it’s refreshing not to have a campaign of sound bites.
I guarantee that after the first debate , whenever it is , trump will find an excuSe to try and cancel the others. Biden will mop the floor with him. Clinton tried to trade quips. Biden will undress him and show trump for the ignorant buffoon he is.

Since Trump is President.. Admission 2 Hell increased by 80%..ALL of these sycophants over last 4 yrs have 2 answer 2 God..WHY WERE 80% OF YOUR WORDS LIES LAST 4 YRS..Oh yeah...BUT..Biden hates God..the Bible almost burst into flames when Trump held it up
And then, of course, there is the inhospitable way trump treats immigrants both legal and illegal and the poor. Just politics you might say? I would answer that Biden’s stance on abortion is also just politics .
Moreover, Biden neither renounced nor denounced his faith with his political position. One could well argue that Trump’s lack of love, compassion, mercy, humility and grace most assuredly is against the teachings of Jesus and the will of God.
Ide trust eating an egg and cheese croissant that’s fallen on to the floor of a Dunkin Donuts bathroom more than Ide trust Joe Biden.
Oh  you poor deluded sap.  has given ZERO indication of not debating the babbling moron  who cant pronounce Thailand or Yosemite. He will mop the floor with the orange marshmallow.
Have you ever actually listened to Trump? He is LITERALLY Unable to put together coherent thoughts on the fly. Short of crass insults. Compared to Trump, Biden is a statesman and a Rhodes scholar .
