Trade "Trump" for Black and "Idiot" for NBA and i think this is just about right on
Trump didn‚Äôt care enough to attend John Lewis funeral. No surprise. Trump has know no respect for anyone or anything.
We have had too much rain today... damn it Trump! üôÑ Cuomo/s are terrible people!!
He‚Äôs going to eventually uncover a lot of shit. Trump had a falling out with Epstein when he discovered what a sick predator he really was.
This is the REAL Trump Derangement Syndrome
Trump Has Done More To Protect Dead Statues From Protesters Then He Has to Protect Living Americans From A Pandemic.
Who was killed? Bring these stories to light. One day the lives lost due to Trump will be avenged.
Trump didn‚Äôt have authority to build the wall either. But, he declared a national emergency and issued executive order to take money appropriated to the military and use it for the wall. It was unconstitutional and against the law but he did it anyway.
Nope, my prediction is we're going to wake up one morning to a tweet from Trump that says dasvidaniya baby, he's never paid the piper &amp; isn't about to at this age.
Let Trump try to cancel the election if there‚Äôs no election by January 20th succession goes to the speaker of the house. His only means is to hold office is to win the election.
John, what of every Trump voter wears a red shirt when they go to the polls? That way people will be able to see and record all the people wearing red who are coming and going to see that Trump won.
Barr should be disbarred, he‚Äôs debased himself; Pompeo has lost his reputation in his service to trump. All of them have the trump taint that will be very hard to remove. The Constitution is something they only revere when it is politically expedient.
Fuck you Barr. Fuck Trump forever.
So Trump finally said it out loud what those of us with an ounce of common sense knew he eventually would. He tweeted earlier today that we should delay the 2020 election until it is safe for everyone to vote. This is on the heels of installing Louis Dejoy as the new postmaster.
Part of the overall conspiracy. It has nothing to do with Trump. This is about power 5 consolidation.
Just be president. Trump does what he wants. ü§£ü§£ü§£
Elitist comments like this are why Trump will be elected again.
So proud of President Obama today.  He realized he had just a few open moments to fire his ‚Äúarrows of truth‚Äù at Trump, Barr, and his entire stupid fuck administration, and he fired them, not once but 3 times with each one splitting the next.  Well done, Mr. President. Well done.
No, but with Trump trailing Biden by double digits in the polls there aren't a lot of takers for the role.
Barr and Trump will collude to cancel elections based on the pandemic emergency and voter fraud;  So Far Trump has committed close to 100 illegal acts and has gotten away with everyone of them.
caught on to my goal. If they think it comes from Trump they not take it.
i wonder how much less our country would hate if god hadn't invented fox news.  trump couldn't have happened w/o them.  fox was john the baptist paving the way for the self-proclaimed chosen one donald trump.  he's the immaculate conception that should make everybody pro choice.
Maxine is the woman who's wig is too tight!  Thanks to the magic of Trump Dynamite!
More like trump is trying to distract from the Maxwell documents.
OpEd by co-founder of the Federalist Society.  Wow.
Embattled surgeon Dr. David Samadi has a new gig on Long Island  via    One of the "Experts" Trump brought in. Now people can  decide if they want to get their COVID advice from the worlds leading authority in epidemics or an "Embattled urologist."
Honest and serious question: is anyone else having panic and anxiety attacks about our country and the current political events happening? I legit started crying today when trump tweeted he wants to delay the election. How do we keep our mental health intact w/ all of this?
Hope you're keeping that same energy for Trump not pushing back on Russia for putting bounties on the heads of our troops.
This a great audition for the part of Trump's #1 bootlicker in the Senate. I'm positive he's going to be getting a callback for the role.
The White House and some of its Republican allies in the Senate are signaling they want to extend, at least temporarily, the $600-per-week unemployment benefit.
Such leadership.  Nothing trump says means anything.
Gotta love it when Trump is so bad that liberals are praising a war criminal. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Trump 2020
Clyburn has challenged President Trump and McConnell to prove they hold Lewis in the same light as hundreds of other politicians in the country and work to pass the bill.
Drunk veteran me almost flipped out, but then I finished reading. Yeah, fuck Trump. And thank God for good, old school reporters like Jake, and the honored dead of the fourth estate, who have sacrificed their lives for their nation and truth.
that'll be the most confusing thing when we look back on this.  how did trump and Russia actually convince some Americans to fight on the side of the virus?  no masks and demon sperm &gt; Fauci
Leave it to Trump's ambassador to mourn the closest thing to a Confederate statue in Europe.
It is a 2 partY system that works because it requires compromise. Don't do Trump wants you do and fall into the Bernie or bust mess.
I thought the standing president wasn't allowed to have a personal account, and that's just ignored for Trump for some reason
So that's worse then tRUMP using the Oval Office to self benefit himself and his entire family.  #Hypocrite
And 1/3rd of Trump‚Äôs power along with it.
I'm at the gym and a Hispanic lady is wearing a Trump Pence face mask..ü§îü§îü§î
In this analogy I do, of course, think of Donald Trump as the "platter of shit with bits of broken glass" and I relate "how the chicken is cooked" to whether Biden will actually do anything about the climate crisis, jobs, and health care, or just talk about these critical issues.
That‚Äôs funny. They would come unglued. As it is, they are numb to the evil now. History will write that Trump ran for the Presidency for an ego trip. He didn‚Äôt really want the job. Now he‚Äôs stuck with it. Or is he? Sabotaging his own re-election and taking down all his pals too.
It's the Trumpvirus. Nobody is more responsible for spreading it in the US than Dirty Don Trump.
Kansans in recent weeks have faced increasingly aggressive political messages about the race for the Kansas Senate seat.  This reporting from  and  adds context about what‚Äôs promoting those campaign texts and calls to voters.
If trump was confident he was gonna win, he would not be suggesting delaying the election. Or do you think he just wanted to say something stupid to distract from the worst GDP report in American history?
This is why we need to remove Dirty Don Trump and make sure similar scoundrels never get elected - so little guys like this can grow up in a decent, just and prosperous land.
And in the meantime whose paying? üôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è And we have no idea what amount were each paying and what we should get back and when. Shady ass business. His family‚Äôs whole fucking job. You ever read about Fred Trump? It‚Äôs easy to see where Don gets it from.....
Follow the bouncing endorsement:  If Trump stays neutral  If that hurts Roger Marshall &amp; helps Kris Kobach  If Kobach wins GOP #kssen   Then Trump helps elect Democrat Barbara Bollier Nov. 3  Awesome move, Ted Cruz
I asked both Roger Marshall and Kris Kobach about the Trump controvery this week on 4Star Politics...
I would like to think that Kansas Republicans are smart enough to refute Trumpism. But we will see. All of the  senate candidates, except one, kiss Trump‚Äôs ass. There is hope in the new generation  If they will step up and get serious.
Kobach was Trump‚Äôs only endorsement heading into the caucus in 2016.
Trump Virus.  Fixed.
Trump threw paper towels at hurricane victims. Your turn. I can play this game for a month. I have 4 yrs of Trump material.
Trump needs more white vote to win, not more black vote
Trump about 50%. Tea Pain will delete this poll. Bank on it.
Trump's campaign paid Brad Parscale's firm $94 million.
This is terrifying. It is now right out in the open. Dog whistles have become blaring megaphones. And now what everyone feared is spoken outloud. Barr, Pompeo &amp; trump will do everything they can to steal the upcoming election.
YOU wrote: "If Trump weren‚Äôt in office life would not have changed."  Uh ... no. Wrong.  The implication is that it is ALL about Trump and the tens of thousands of deaths in Spain, Italy, and Iran - before the virus came to the states - meant nothing.
But couldn‚Äôt be bothered to talk about it in front of a microphone out of all the other dumb shit we have to hear him say. The full truth would‚Äôve been a nice change of pace. He ran a scam on his own country. Go Trump. üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏
No. I never thought Mexico would pay shit. Trump would make us do it and try to put a bow on it and hope we‚Äôre stupid.
the gag is, Dems enable Trump, whereas Republicans opposed Obama and still got what they wanted. its almost like.. Democrats don‚Äôt really CARE about all they posture for, because the end result still directly benefits them  this cult mentality around Obama is why Biden is the nom
eight years as president. eight years.  and yet we act as if Trump can somehow supersede all process and authority to get his terrible shit done.  so that tells me he‚Äôs either full of shit, or Democrats aren‚Äôt HALF the ‚Äúopposition party‚Äù or ‚Äúresistance‚Äù that Republicans are. sad.
Liar! You 100% support trump and all of his treasonous decisions.
Instead of Trump trying to extend the voting date, why doesn‚Äôt congress open voting for the whole week before the traditional voting day. Due to Covid and not having enough voting booths this is a viable solution.
Bull, you fully support tRump. He is your leader and your brand.
Opinion | Trump‚Äôs suggestion to delay the election is the most anti-democratic thing any president ever said - The Washington Post
Actually, it matters bc ppl mistakenly believe that Trump is an aberration, that he didn‚Äôt inherit much of his powers from prior presidents (including Obama). So just getting rid of Trump isn‚Äôt enough and thinking Biden will simply erase the Trump legacy is incredibly naive.
trump already turned the game off
That is cool. Also, a metaphor for the Trump administration and 2020!!
#maxwelldocuments  Hmmmmmm. Looks like Trump has always been a good guy!!
Covering Climate Now: The terms of the Paris climate accord mean no country can leave before November this year, so due to a quirk of timing, the US will officially exit the Paris deal on November 4 ‚Äì just one day after the 2020 presidential election.

A good friend was in a medically induced coma from early November 2016 until late January 2017. Coming out of it, she heard a news report about ‚ÄúPresident‚Äù Trump. She sat bolt upright and said ‚ÄúPresident???Trump??? What the fuck happened??‚Äù True story.
Im not confident Trump knows what the filibuster is...but the fundemental issue is one party has perserved a system that even though they receive fewer votes they remain in power. That isn‚Äôt democracy. Something must change.
Trump was up +2 in florida the day before the election
Did Ted Cruz convince Trump stay neutral in race between Kobach and Marshall?
James, it‚Äôs simple brother. It‚Äôs common sense. Biden is in bed with china, they tried to take out Trump, it didn‚Äôt work, so China unleashed the virus. They figured the people they were paying here weren‚Äôt getting the job done, so they did it themselves
Everyone compared to Trump is a strong man.

God knows who's right (and it ain't Flynn/Trump)!
1/ Can you imagine if, when cases first started to appear in February, Trump had given an Oval Office address to the country and told us that this moment had to transcend politics and that he was appointing  to head up a task force to come up with recommendations?
When I see people who support trump and say don‚Äôt wear a mask
In KS here we'd like Kobach to win the primary b/c  would definitely win running against this nutball... who was Trumpy before Trump  But man hearing his racists ads just sends shivers down my spine
I think Mitt Romney was the turning point; financial parasites switched sides and joined Democrat. Big tech, woke capital, selling country to China, it was all written in by then, making Trump inevitable. I gotta even reevaluate Trump now. I still hate him, but nobody else acted.
Trump has taken a sledgehammer to democracy.  Ignoring everything in the constitution except the 2nd amendment; he would toss that one out the window too if more non white non Christian citizens were to exercise their rights.   To say Biden is a bigger threat is ludicrous.
He's trolling so as to elevate the seriousness of potential wide-spread election fraud with mail-in ballots.  It wasn't a serious suggestion.  Classic Trump technique, which of course triggers the Left's collective heads to explode.
Lol... everything trump touches fails. The only thing he had success at was reality TV üì∫.  You elected Snooki
Donald Trump found out that couldn't was putting a bounty on American soldiers so they're going to have a date at patio pizza and talk about it.

In a really like gay wapo editorial way I am upset with the United States The secretary of treasury under trump is literally a jewish movie producer
What a tremendous burden it must be for you to still be defending Donald Trump
Weird.  I guess you and Obama forgot when John McCain gave a üëéüèº to stop Trump and the majority party‚Äôs attempt to undo the Affordable Care Act. ü§î
Yep...and remember when they ridiculed Pres Trump who forewarned about that very thing, early on in this "plandemic"...and said we had to be careful that "the cure was not worse than the virus". Once again, Pres Trump was RIGHT!!!
Donald Trump should resign. Pass it on.
Not sure why this week's  episode features an ad from  I'm in KS and the ad was pro-Kobach, "the first statewide elected official to endorse Donald Trump". I was like whhhaaaa?? Alie would not endorse this!
I think Trump might know more than you and I would know. You are not in politics for 34 years and innocent. Our Govt was not designed to operate this way. Too much Lobbyist money to be innocent &amp; in politics that long to stay innocent.
The right wing has resorted to: "Oh... come on! Trump does not mean any of the things trump says!!!"  And this is their DEFENSE of trump.
Its ok though, because nothing trump says means anything.
This game of "trump didn't suggest the thing that trump suggested" is petty and pathetic.  Your tortured defense of a man with absolutely ZERO character is disheartening.
Democrat ballot harvesting?  You are no better than tRump.
Conservatives are now melting down about the nfl, mlb, and the nfl. You know that saying how if you run into assholes all day that you might be the asshole? Now that they don‚Äôt have sports all they have is trump. It‚Äôs gonna get worse.
I disagree. Haven‚Äôt we learned how much smoke he blows? The results will be convincing (Biden wins by at least 5 points) and Trump exits stage left.
You're absolutely right: Nothing trump says means anything.
Worse excuse of a man,That could not even walk away without being a Traitor &amp; Committing Treason on his own Country. So angry because not only did they lose. They even got caught cheating &amp; Spying. And They still Lost. They blame Trump &amp; the voters. For what the did to themselves
What's going on because I have already started my wine a hour ago. I can't take this waiting around for some good trouble against Trump and any other crooked Republican senators.
The elite hang together.  They cover up for each other.  Clinton is guilty.  Trump is guilty.  Hanks is guilty. Winfrey is guilty. Gates is guilty.  The list goes on.   It‚Äôs the elite and then the rest of us.  If you impede or mess with the elites bottom line, look OUT!!
Lol. Nope Trump does not.  But neither did
No, they're not. You need to look up what a red herring actually is. And we're not helping Trump, Joe Biden and the Democrats are.
Trump is too transparent to be devious. He loves dictators and hates our Free world allies. No apologies. He wants us to like him but he insults people. So he gets back what he gives out.  was correct in her analysis. Unqualified to be President.
The current KKK showed out for Trump in Charlotte and other places.  Nazi white supremacists were called "good people" by Trump.
So, FLOUTS renegotiated her contract with trump... I think it has something to do with being a couple. Anyway....!  How much will she get when she sues...?    trump must be scared out of his wig.
It is not  called China Virus!  I think we should call it the Trump Virus!
idk about y‚Äôall but i will be looking back fondly on our time with president Trump once the mole people successfully undermine the 2040 election and president Dirt Diggler takes power
I am not saying I agree with Trump.. im just clarifying the words he said without inserting my own perception of what they mean.
Trump is an a-hole joke, Biden is terrifying.
So much more Presidential that tRump already.
Doesn‚Äôt he think Trump isn‚Äôt that bad?
Trump listened to the Fuhrer and this is what happens. I imagine that many in his base that went to the rally will get COVID-19 as well. Who knows... some may die. A lesson is here for all... Don‚Äôt listen to Trump you just might die.

They won't be sorry because Trump backs all the people. Where as the Democrats agree with Muslims &amp; Make no mistake The Muslims do what Allah says &amp; Which is no Homosexual or Lesbian.
You do realize that criticism of Obama doesn‚Äôt equal support for Trump, yeah?
I love how you think criticism of Obama = support for Trump. Can you not see beyond tribalistic partisanship?
I always give Trump a pass when he slurs his words because he's working 24/7 and is tired from talking all day. Biden does max 25 minutes and gafs it Everytime
He was on video in 2016 election memeing irl about how Trump will complete the philosophy of German idealism and raise Thule. It was pretty funny tbh and the reporter and ppl around him had no idea what he was talking about. I have faith he'll get his shit together

If you were to squeeze Trump's 'big' brain with a vice the only things that would ease out of his ears is tough talk, bullsh!t and lies He's not very complicated
Trump is playing you and you cheer him. He is saying look over here üëãüèº don‚Äôt worry about this shit I‚Äôm doing over here. And you look, like a good boy! So housebroken
Trump admin openened an investigation into voter fraud, they found nothing. Millions &amp; millions already vote my mail. They found nothing. There is a pandemic, 150,000 dead &amp; surging, &amp;  would rather risk American lives than risk a fair election! Beyond disturbing.
If  is Biden‚Äôs VP choice, I will be SO EXCITED TO VOTE FOR BIDEN. If she‚Äôs not, I‚Äôll still vote for Biden because, you know, he‚Äôs not Trump. I said what I said.
Back in the days when he focused on blocking football players rather than people who didn't vote for Trump
Bullshit! The HERO's Act was past almost 2.5months ago and you're just now getting around to proposing your bill full of pork like protecting trump tower from competition. The GOP are the ones dragging thier feet here not the Dems. You could have taken up the HERO's Act 2...
Trump offers to pay for funeral of slain soldier Vanessa Guillen
Millions of Americans became insured under Obama. Before Obama I had no access to healthcare. Now Trump has destroyed that system. As a single male I pay $650/month with $8,000 deductible. Trump has made ACA unaffordable to many. Where the eff is his "cheaper, better" healthcare?
Trump is done. If the GOP doesn't start standing up to Trump and take your party back, it will be a very long time before Republicans have any power again. You reap what you sow.
So  volunteered to give his life to make trump look bad. So THAT‚Äôs why he went to the Tulsa Rally without a mask. Thanks for clearing that up.üôÑ
I‚Äôd add ‚ÄúVoter Fraud‚Äù, ‚ÄúBallot Harvesting‚Äù etc are just conspiracy theories pushed by Trump.  Unfortunately it‚Äôs very human to believe them, they resonate with us all, to some extent. It‚Äôs a defense mechanism, we‚Äôre primed to be suspicious of things that can‚Äôt easily be explained

Thank you, President Trump!
He full of threats b/c he‚Äôs so desperate he‚Äôll try to abuse his power.  He‚Äôs too unstable, to trust. He should have been impeached when they had the chance. There‚Äôs been so much corruption and obstruction of justice, within the Trump Gov‚Äôt, it‚Äôs hard to keep up.
There‚Äôs are protests not riots.  Trump keeps telling everyone that it‚Äôs way worse than it is.  He said my city was a mess and would have to have Federal Troops sent in.  We are not a mess, Trump lies.  It‚Äôs all he can do is lie.
Glad you asked! House Speaker Paul Ryan, who endorsed Trump, later called such comments ‚Äúthe textbook definition of a racist comment.‚Äù
Trump has stock in it. Why else would he be pushing it for months? So tired of it all. The election couldn't come sooner.
I can only 'watch' trump thru his threads. It's like a sterile filter. Now, next year I will continue to follow Aaron bc his daughter.
But supporting Trump is supporting the swamp-expansion project. I‚Äôm confused.
Who will you vote for Biden or Trump?
In fairness, as long as Trump is President none of us can be sure of anything nor are any of his pronouncements reassuring.
We can start with Charlottesville, but there‚Äôs also this
Donald Trump doesn‚Äôt know what he wants. He doesn‚Äôt really know reality. He just says whatever flows from his lips. But his GOP followers lap it up no matter what it is and no matter how farcical
I think it'll be a Biden vs. Trump rematch if Biden wins in 2020. 60% of Republicans strongly approve of Trump, and I don't see him quietly going away after a loss.
Trump has been "probing and testing" every firewall of democracy since before he was elected. We are going to need some security upgrades when he's gone.

I‚Äôm a trump hater but they can be different. You request an absentee ballot when you‚Äôre not able to vote in person (travel, illness, etc.) Mail-in ballots are usually determined by a state and sent out to all registered voters to use instead of in-person voting.
He does whatever Trump wants. VOTE him out!

Never said that, but sure, Christians believe in forgiveness for those who renounce their former ways. Its like their thing. Which, again, Trump wouldn‚Äôt know anything about
The Issue Is Trump
It was all under Trump's guidance.   Had Trump banned flights from Europe at start of the virus spread, NY wouldn't have been seeded so much with the virus.   Had Trump prepared months earlier &amp; gotten enough tests for the country, virus in NYC would have been contained.
Definitely didn‚Äôt tweet the initial response to get likes from the right or comments from the left. Trump is a moron. Just think it‚Äôs weird to hop on deaths for a political twitter war.
Trump: "We're coming in very soon, the National Guard, who r allowed to go forward and do what they have to do and I think that makes the governors and mayors jobs a lot easier so they're working to clean out this BEEHIVE of TERRORISTS and...I'm going to be very happy."  WTF???üò≥
President Trump has done more good for our country than all 3 of those democrats combined.

Imagine actually thinking Joe Biden is going to win over Trump. I would honestly love to be that clueless.
#USPS #USPSSabotage The United States Post Office is ESSENTIAL for the safety of this country in peacetime and wartime - and Trump is attempting to sabotage it just before the election.  This is unconscionable!    We need our post office and we need to SUPPORT it, dammit!
You are right!  He was an adult!  Should not have listened to the Idiot Trump!
Hey, ex cops could get jobs in those big beautiful growing coal mining communities - oh, wait, Another Trump failure

Michelle Obama describes Barack as ‚Äòformer president who reads and knows history‚Äô, in apparent swipe at Trump   A business man who raises the economy is as important as a history or geography student. Business folks are great in Math &amp; calculations.
Me too, but Trump's just digging a deeper and deeper ditch for his own grave, Julie, so cheer up...this insanity will all be over soon.üëç
You are caving under the pressure of Trump and his cronies. How disappointing. What happened to your backbone?
And is Trump so fucking STUPID that he's unaware of the Constitutional FACT that he doesn't have the ABSOLUTE POWER to postpone the election?  (That was a rhetorical question btw).ü§£
‚Ä¶Because when the founder of the  is calling Trump a fascist worthy of impeachment, maybe it‚Äôs time all Republicans took this threat to democracy seriously:
I am going to volunteer for somebody who is not part of swamp, just like Trump, like Herman Cain, outsiders. I feel its wrong for all those who have long been in politics from the start to kick out those who come in new from outside call us deplorables, just cos we are not toilet
Trump and his lackey postmaster general is trying to destroy the post office.
I'm ok with calling it the Trump virus.
Are we living in same country? Job prosperity plans - never implemented in 3 1/2 yrs. Billions in drug money? Where? What happened to it? Human &amp; child trafficking arrests - why haven‚Äôt I seen this or heard trump talk about rescues / sentences. Guess you‚Äôre not pro-life.

BREAKING NEWS. President Donald J. Trump just publicly announced that he whole heartedly agrees with the co-founder of The Federalist Society   ... delaying the 2020 election would be FANTASTIC!
Trump Might Try to Postpone the Election. That‚Äôs Unconstitutional.
Got you. So all this about racism is a lie as Herman Cain supported President Trump he is obviously black, but he was not involved in politics but has been a businessman, like Trump. What is wrong with that? So they can't enter politics directly? I want to enter politics now.
Herman Cain died from following Trump's lead and ignoring mask &amp; social distancing. He died from Trumpvirus. You elect a monster-clown, expect chaos, confusion and death.
Did he listen to 45‚Äôs press conference just now? Because Trump just doubled down.
Trump and Herman Cain are business people, outsiders, did not go through the formal route of congressman, senator, governor or born to a politician in power, they came from outside, without being soaked up in the swamp of politics before becoming president, or a supporter. Ha ha.

Trump said we will be the laughing nation of the world if we have mail in ballots. He is lying again.  Voting by mail is safe. No mail fraud. By the way countries around the world are laughing at you, and your leadership.  Becky
Yeah bcuz revamping FBI bldg when a thousand Americans a day are dying and the creditors are stepping up their evictions next week as well as foreclosures just makes total sense.  Sit down.   stop caring about any American who aren't in the 1% the minute Trump took office.
wont let  do it. But, it is a very bad look. Kind of surprised Trump let this leak.
Trump: "I don't want to delay, I want to have the election but I also don't want to have to wait for 3 mths and find out that the ballots r missing and election doesn't MEAN anything...that's what's going to happen Steve, that's common sense, and everyone knows it."  WTF???????üò≥
Just remember if Biden happens to win, we need to treat him with the same respect and optimism that the left has treated Trump with.  It‚Äôs only fair to match their class.
Wondering if Republicans still think it‚Äôs treasonous to propose delaying the election...
Very sorry for Mr. Cain's family.  People said Trump's Tulsa rally was a failure because of low turnout.  Can you imagine the catastrophe if the place had been filled to capacity?   Looks like the TikTokkers may have save some lives, eh?
Is Trump drunk?? #orangevillan
What about the money that was given to millionaires? Kanye West, Elaine Cho's family for example! What about mail in ballots????? What about stop kissing Trump's butt? The buck stops with you for Missouri!!!
Unlike Donald Trump, our US Mail personnel are people of integrity and honor.
Trump needs to stop beating around the bush.üòÇ .
Really? Your "experts" said millions would die if Trump didn't act.  He did. Only thousands died.  You should be praising him.  #MAGA2020 right?
Trump: "U r sending out HUNDREDS of MILLIONS of mail-in ballots and the democrats know this Steve, the democrats know this...I want an election more than u but u have the fake polls and we have the REAL polls and I think we're doing really well."  We only have 350M people..WTF?üò≥

We have a state-wide mandate here in Kansas, TeeKay, thanks to our great governor and have not noticed that at all simply bc it's the LAW of the State.   Can u imagine how many lives could've been saved if Trump issued a NATION-WIDE mandate back in March, when he should have?üò≥
Trump has been president for almost 4 whole years. Why isn't freedom here yet?!
Trump is a pathological liar. He has to be to make up for his utter ignorance and natural tendency to cheat. The TrumpVirus rages across America due to his utter incompetence; Russian put bounties on our troops and he says nothing to stop it. He is an astoundingly bad president.
Trump is rambling and lying as usual so it's a waste of time.
Trump just admitted it‚Äôs not fake news from the New York post if it benefits him what a fucking ass clown
It‚Äôs failing me? Lol. Ok you keep throwing assumptions on me so let me try.  You think I want COVID to kill people because I think that will cost Trump the election, right? Or I want the country to stay locked down cuz thatll make him lose?
I feel great! I knew 20 years ago the trump was a criminal bully. He fooled stupid people then and is doing it now. I feel sorry got you  and your family.
FAKE NEWS!!!  HER REAL BOYFRIEND IS DONALD TRUMP
4 American Presidents; Obama, Clinton, Bush, and Carter...were ALL HEARD today at John Lewis's funeral ceremony.  And they ALL were speaking about what this nation SHOULD BE doing, rather than what we ARE doing.  In simpler terms, they eviscerated Trump into a pathetic PULP.ü§£üëç
Petty dumbfuck trump tried to hijack Obama's eulogy of John Lewis by calling for an unscheduled press conference. CHRIST WHAT AN ASSHOLE. How can people condone this childish behavior?
i stopped following Trump months ago ,I realized I didnt need the aggravation
The people who cheer when I criticize Trump, fascists and bigots who involve themselves in other people's lives are gonne be upset when I also denounce socialism, attempts to circumvent the 2nd ammendment, and extreme taxation. News flash: I'm not a D or an R. I'm a Libertarian
Based on the GOP‚Äôs unwillingness to fight for almost anything I would rather get rid of the GOP than the President   It‚Äôs why I contribute to President Trump but NOT the GOP  Just Sayin

Trump is going to be so, so small in this press conference. Obama's shadow today is far too long. Whatever Trump tries to do to steal the spotlight will be even more pathetic, especially if he comes out to pat himself on the back. Which...he will.
LAW AND ORDER! Trump 2020!
Nikki Haley has become very vocal lately. I'm wondering if the fix is in for trump to resign "due to health issues" and RNC selects Nikki, thinking a woman will draw Democrat women?  Not really wondering this - trump's desperate to win to stay out of jail
Trump 2020!
Trump dilly- dallied and denied that the TrumpVirus would be serious, that it would just disappear. He had disbanded the Pandemic Alert Team. He sent 8 tons of PPE to China and said China was doing a good job. He continues to confuse the public about masks &amp; medications.
But I wonder what the result would've been had the Democrat candidate been a man?  A lot of those trump votes were anti Hillary and anti woman
Thank you, Gregory. Trump doesn‚Äôt want to nor does he posses the ability to govern .
If Democrats are for it, I‚Äôm against it..... if Democrats are against it, I‚Äôm for it
True. The radical left is messing up the vote. I sure hope President Trump can win anyway.  It would only be fair.
The radical left is deliberately messing up the mail. They dream up messes to make - to try to blame other people, like President Trump.
He'll still vote for Trump because everything to the left of absolute monarchism is socialism.
So you still thing Trump is the issue? Why are  all complete morons?
... but instead, the President, Donald J. Trump, is out getting fucked by Russia. This is the man we chose, but unlike Melania ‚Äì we won't choose to keep him. I don't know about you, but I won't be #dyingfortrump on Nov. 3rd. #VoteBiden2020 #Biden2020
All of America feels like Melania Trump must have felt in 2006 ‚Äì¬†a time when she needed her husband most. At home Melania sat, alone &amp; pregnant with Donald's 5th child, while he was out screwing a porn star. 14 years later, America needs presidential leadership now more than ever

LMFAO... Did trump take down his "delay the election" tweet?  Someone must have paraphrased the Constitution to him
#ObamaWasABigMistake.  President Trump is the best president ever.
To be clear, Trump is not wanting to delay the election due to safety concerns. He wants to delay the election because he hopes a vaccine will be put out on the market and ultimately turn his bad polling around. It's endless political corruption from this administration.
Thank God we have Donald Trump to in no way try and profit from his political position, right?
This idiot, Biden isn't 1/10th the man  Trump is, and  you know it! There is no chance Biden wins in a fair election. AND, that is why you intend to cheat with mail in voting! #GruberLibs

What presidency used to look like? Urbane, civilized, erudite, caring, compassionate! Everything that Trump is not.
Just to count your internet faux pas: against making voting accesible, force poor people to pull themselves up by the boot strings AND you make fun of illiteracy. THIS, my friends, is the Democratic Party. Congrats, Trump.
Trump doesn't have a whole lot of problem with that
Ignorance like this just shocks me, it‚Äôs almost 4 years an none of ridiculous shit liberals have said Trump would do has happened. When is all this stuff Trump was gonna do for Russia gonna happen? I can‚Äôt wait to see all memes of crying liberals after he wins again, too funny.

Voters are concerned that Trump‚Äôs new Postmaster General will find a way to lose the ballots before they get back to election officials. Trump has already said this will be the most rigged election ever and will do everything he can to prove it.
I estimated nothing. And Trump himself went up to 2,000,000 when he started inching up on his previous 100,000. Then he throws out 2,000,000 cuz he knows we won‚Äôt get to that ridiculous number then later he can say ‚Äúlook how much I cut down from the expected 2M!‚Äù
Herman Cain passed away from COVID after attending the Trump rally in Tulsa. Horrible, yet probably preventable.
Pence is one of the most insincere speakers in the world, surpassed only by Donald Trump himself. Take their microphones away.

Preach it, Pete. Don't let Trump distract. Putin is calling the shots here anyway, not Trump. Trump is the latest Benedict Arnold and needs to be imprisoned for treason!
So Trump thinks we should delay the election. More advice from his mentor Putin?
If Trump attempts to remain in office upon losing the election, citizens will take to the streets en masse. I have already lived most of the life that I have on this earth. If it comes down to it, I will gladly take to the streets. 1/2
Wait, don‚Äôt you get paid by Soros? Why would Trump take responsibility?
This is more than he said about John Lewis.   Maybe that‚Äôs because Cain died because of Trump. Just add him to the list...
Only in America have we seen Donald Trump‚Äôs lack of leadership lead us to most cases and most deaths of any country in the world. Pence waves his arms and praises an incompetent president like this is a good thing.

Yes. In the age of tRump it certainly is.

However, here he is standing with this alliance, claiming that we need to send our kids to school during this pandemic, just as Trump has said. Hamilton said, "We need to not act out of fear, we need to act out of science." As she stands with other physicians who say don't wear
So Trump really feels like his supporters are "balls deep" in their sisters? What a sick, sick man. That is the leader Evangelicals want to follow? The man the Christian Right has faith in? He's more like the Beast. More intent on killing Americans than leading and saving us.

Kansas Secretary of State releases statement after Trump suggests delaying election
If you go on TikTok and look at  ‚ÄúRed Kingdom‚Äù, it‚Äôs just a bunch of  supporters using the audio.  DUMB #TRUMP SUPPORTERS ARE TRYING TO CLAIM OUR KC  MASTERPIECE. ü§Æ NO. ü§¨ Orange koolaid doesn‚Äôt deserve to be associated with that gem. üñï
Better retweet and let Trump* know we're watching his performance.   US economy suffers worst quarter since the second world war as GDP shrinks by 32.9%  #VoteBlue2020 #economy #Biden
The only embarrassment is Trump!  Why is he constantly ranting on about the election voting?   Calling it fraudulent haha  When he loses and as they‚Äôre tossing him out, he‚Äôll be yelling ‚ÄúI won this election‚Äù   Remember he wouldn‚Äôt shut up when Hillary won the popular vote! üôÑ
Pretty sure there was a method to the madness when Trump tweeted that. Guess you were suckered too.
And President Bush did not let a grudge prevent him from honoring the life and career of   Mr. Lewis; i.e., trump and John McCain
You think all trump supporters are racists that‚Äôs literally the dumbest statement ever are there some yeah but I‚Äôm sure Biden‚Äôs supporters are all saints
Tell Congress: Defund and dismantle the DHS agencies taking part in Trump's "surge" of unaccountable federal forces terrorizing communities and being sent to largely Black and brown urban centers across the country! &gt;&gt;  via
I have seen two catergories of people..  I hate Trump (not endorsing Biden ) and those of us who love America and will vote for him again. No middle ground.

Do we know if Herman signed the waiver? I bet he didn‚Äôt get his Tulsa tickets online like the Tik Tok teens so did he sign a paper waiver? Trump and campaign better hope so.
Maybe tRump is just preparing for his post president job as a spoke person for a pizza joint?
It's true. Trump had led his cult followers into believing they were safe. They were not. And now they are dying, just so Trump could hear them chant his name. Trump will burn in hell for this.
trump should resign. pass it on
I even told those GOP Senators they need get Trump under control. The way he has divided our country &amp; mishandled the #COVID19 pandemic was abhorrent. I have high risk factors but I‚Äôd risk my life &amp; crawl over broken glass to vote! #VetsResistSquadron #VoteBlueToEndThisNightmare
üö®Powerful, Amazing and I miss hearing himüö®  BREAKING: Obama, eulogizing John Lewis, harshly criticizes Trump's actions on voting rights, protest response
Do we know if Herman signed the waiver? I bet he didn‚Äôt get his Tulsa tickets online like the Tik Tok teens so did he sign a paper waiver? Trump and campaign better hope so.
Barr is a liar, and a crook. Him and trump are a disgrace to america.
He says "no one reads more than I do". Yet, he hasn't read that Congress is the only body that can approve any change in voting laws or dates.  President Trump suggests delay to November election, though experts say he lacks the authority to do so"
While President Trump hasn‚Äôt done a great job of uniting people, President Obama played a very major role in why we have been so divided as a natio and why we still are. President Obama played a major role on why we are at each others throats 24/7.
Why isn't this funeral a "super spreader event" like Libs claimed of Trump's rally? #GruberLibs
you are Anti-Trump scum
Division in America is unhealthy for us all. Shame on you #FakeFox for spreading the Trump Hate rhetoric! #VoteBlueToEndThisNightmare
We'll see about that?  What does that mean?  I believe it is a matter of law which we still have in this country and judges that still don't completely cave into trump what you cowardly do every day.
trump and the Nazis.
It's like Herman Cain will just disappear some day. Trump is a psycho

Trump is worried that others will try to duplicate the GOP's cheating tactic they tried to employ in NC-9.  Does he not know we know what the GOP did there? THEY are the ones who tried it ... and they got caught.
‚ÄòDominate the streets‚Äô  ‚ÄòDemocrats are animals‚Äô  Trump is dictating this garbage  He‚Äôs so full of hate   It‚Äôs not fully understandable why he wasn‚Äôt impeached but if he isn‚Äôt removed, America will suffer far worse than it already has.
Yeah but at the same time...
The fact that the DoJ would interfere to do a favor for a president's friend is scary. The abuse of power by trump is stunning and you know it well, but choose to ignore.
Of course they do! Even if everybody had worn a mask and he still got sick they would still blame Trump
Trump like 150K others
trump.
Yes. The Trump vs. the ENTIRE WORLD derangement is something else.  It is rather cult-like that his supporters believe he is the most wronged individual alive today and that the world revolves around him.  He alone has made the wrong decisions prolonging the virus in the US.
Black lives matter. Trans lives matter. Trump is a rapist and a racist. Vote for Biden. #BlackLivesMatter #TransLivesMatter #NobodyLikesTrump #Biden2020
Trump killed him.
Trump is doing the  a favor by suggesting delaying the election. They need someone who can stand, speak and be coherent. #GruberLibs
Trump killed him
Yep. Would crawl through broken glass to vote Trump out of office.
Trump killed Cain #TrumpThreatensAmerica
I like how everyone liking this post is a Trump supporter. Shows the level of stupidity in his followers ü§£ Clearly this man died from covid-19 after getting it from that unsafe petri dish of a rally in Tulsa
Sad he had to die of a hoax to prove tRump wrong..
Imagine Trump delivering a eulogy for someone: ‚ÄúNot many people know this, but I‚Äôm the one who told John to go out there and protest. I gave him cash, and cheered him from Trump Tower, and nobody gives me credit for this, but it‚Äôs ok.‚Äù
Trump playing the  again, and they have no clue. The DEMS are the ones that planned to steal an election, with mail in voting.  #GruberLibs
Look at those Trump voters! #MAGA
No dem leaders talk shit on trump in any interview or press conference whatever it my be he always comes up and that‚Äôs fine because that‚Äôs how America works
Acting CBP commissioner dismisses Elizabeth Warren's 'ridiculous' claim about election
Lindsey - the jig is almost up.   You‚Äôre personally corrupt ... and you‚Äôre protecting Trump/Barr corruption.
You don't "has" my respect because your rapier like sarcasm was blunted by poor grammar, sentence structure, and punctuation. Obviously a Trump acolyte. #TedSpeaksTheTruth
Why isn't the John Lewis funeral a "super spreader event" like Liberals claimed of Trump's rally? And, WHY do  Liberals get funerals when average Americans do not?  #GruberLibs
I tend to agree. Leadership should come from the top down and Trump has not shown that. Unfortunately, Biden has been in politics a long time and hasn't been that man either, which takes me back to the wish (dare I say prayer) that another option will appear.
Haven't been that moved since Adam Schiff gave closing argument in Trump's impeachment.
‚ÄúWe are not aware of any evidence supporting the claims made by President Trump,‚Äù the National Assn. of Secretaries of State said in a statement.
Trump is terrified of losing and terrified of going to jail. The bull shit / fuckery he‚Äôs going to try and pull between now and the election will become more and more obscene.
I Believe Trump is nuts and Joe is looney
Stone cold racism. If Obama did anything Trump had did in his life, he would not have held an office at any level.
Jeff, I don't think you have a clue. Trump is a Populist Nationalist. He isn't a Conservative or Right Winger.   But Trump has done much to advance the Conservative Agenda. Clinton also advanced parts of the Conservative Agenda...does that make him a Conservative, too.
Spot on.  I was thinking the same when the news broke of Trump trying to delay the election. Man-child cannot stand former presidents are speaking at one of the greats and he's standing outside pouting because he didn't get invited üôÑ
His suggestion came minutes after the Commerce Department announced that the nation‚Äôs GDP, the broadest measure of goods and services produced, fell 9.5 percent during the three months ending June 30, the largest quarterly drop on record.
I was thinking while watching this today; ‚ÄúWill ANYONE want Trump to speak at his/her funeral?‚Äù  He would always turn it to himself and all praise would be directed to self. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
So did Trump's waiver say Herman Cain has to be buried in a MAGA hat?
An opinion piece that talks about the "dangers" of universal mail-in voting? No where in that piece does it say that Democrats are trying to abolish in-person voting.
‚ÄúMisled donors and misdirected funds, funneling them into Trump properties‚Äù .....You have to read the whole Snopes article. It‚Äôs false in the wording only. Trumps are all cons, grifters, and thieves.
a lot of things  that quote " will not happen" because of quote " how are goverment works"  have happened under trump, sooo.......lol
Trump's exposed and sadistically using his position can't be over soon enough.
I totally agree!!! Unfortunately, this was Herman Cain and friends literally catching the virus. While at the same time dancing around and selling their souls to Trump.
Truer words have never been spoken. Hate that phrase with a passion. I won‚Äôt even use it as a descriptor of all the lies that trump, his administration and many Republicans tell.
At least you haven't completely lost it. But you also said Trump was a terrible person and it took like 2 months and you were basically on his diiiiiii     I think everyone gets the point. Shifty shady lady.
Does anyone actually think Trump is gonna push the election? Or maybe, just maybe... he likes us talking about this right now and not the GDP tanking.
HCQ almost doesn't even matter. If Sweden new deaths per day remain trending to near-zero. That's knowledge that's *out there*. Heads will roll. Trump wins 80% of the vote.
Same Republicans who have no comment on one abuse of power after another from Trump will have a whole lot to say about Obama making this speech.   Take that to the Koch bank.
Yeah Thank YOU President Trump!!   Yeah Thank YOU President Trump!!   Yeah Thank YOU President Trump!!   Yeah Thank YOU President Trump!!
He's done with Trump's bullshit!
No one has time to check out everything that is posted especially when you've got Trump and QAnon and their crackpot bs.
Let‚Äôs not discuss prison even tho it is warranted;  we should not waste 1 ounce of energy on that and put our energy into restoring our country to where it was before trump.  let‚Äôs vote this man out, remember the lessons learned from this tragic event and vow not to repeat them.
this is how man and a president speaks... fuck you! #Trump #Biden #TrumpIsANationalDisgrace
Delaying the election in no less far fetched of an option as is bastardizing it by mailing out millions of ballots nationally with no chain of custody.  The #NeverTrump crowd like  &amp;  are ready to jump all over Trump but not dems.
Of course, you're a Trump supporter, so by definition you listen to and believe bullshit, superstition and conspiracy theories.
Your "experts" said millions of people will die if Trump doesn't act. He did. Only thousands have died so you are his biggest fan now right?  #MAGA2020 right?
Delaying the election in no less far fetched of an option as is bastardizing it by mailing out millions of ballots nationally with no chain of custody.  The #NeverTrump crowd like  &amp;  are ready to jump all over Trump but not dems.
Experts? 491 cases of fraud between 2000 and 2012 where literally billions of votes were cast. By "disaster" you really mean that people's voices will be heard and Trump will lose
I read your article in our local, biased paper in KC.  While you can explain away Trump and slam him all you wish, I‚Äôm not quite sure you can explain how, by requiring #VoterID that it makes it harder for minorities to vote.  No one has fully explained this yet.
Trump is fuming right now because Obama is speaking and more liked than him.

Why are  hacks having a funeral for a man, when we cannot? And, didn't Lewis refuse to go to POTUS Trump's? inauguration? Why special rules for DEMS
We see what Trump‚Äôs version of greatness has magnified in America-divisions... disparities... inequalities... distrust... racism... abuse of power...diminished respect in the eyes of the world.  It‚Äôs time to ‚Äúmake America America again‚Äù (Langston Hughes)
Instead, Trump pinned the Tweet to his profile. It's shocking that after  has spent 3.5 years enabling and shilling for Trump that the President doesn't listen to his advice (Muh judges I guess).
trump killed his competitors in 2016 and has a good start for 2020
Trump says he won't pay respects to John Lewis as he lies in state.  Shame.
Instead, the guy you relentlessly shill for has pinned it to his Twitter profile.  This is why EVERYONE who enabled Trump needs to spend the next 20 years in the political wilderness.  You own this crap
trump was killing his contenders in 2016 and now again in 2020
I‚Äôm getting ‚Äúwhy does nobody like me‚Äù trump vibes from her
Trump has called the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus the ‚ÄúChinese virus‚Äù and ‚Äúkung flu.‚Äù The World Health Organization advises against linking a virus to any particular region, since it can lead to stigma
Wisconsin, New Mexico, Arizona.  There are examples everywhere.  You throw Trump in the mix, there will be more.  Left or Right doesn‚Äôt matter.  And whoever loses?  They are going to fight and complain about the results.  And then they‚Äôll be court cases.  So much wasted money.
Trump tweeted later that year that several Black and brown members of Congress Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez Ayanna Pressley Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib are ‚Äúfrom countries whose governments are a complete and total catastrophe‚Äù and that they should ‚Äúgo back‚Äù to those countries
When liberals are as psychotic as Trump they post stuff like this.
Trump reportedly asked, in reference to Haiti and African countries, ‚ÄúWhy are we having all these people from shithole countries come here?‚Äù He then reportedly suggested that the US should take more people from countries like Norway.
Trump chooses to believe a doctor/preacher from a strip mall over Dr. Fauci. The rest of the world no longer respects us. They aren't even laughing at us anymore. They pity us.
Next, Trump will declare a 30-day suspension of the constitution. Trump would declare Martial law in sometime August. Trump declaring Martial law (COVID-19/Riots/Epstein) would help delay the election in November as a ploy to stay in office.
Trump reportedly said in 2017 that people who came to the US from Haiti ‚Äúall have AIDS,‚Äù and he lamented that people who came to the US from Nigeria would never ‚Äúgo back to their huts‚Äù
I've been inconsistent with Twitter for the past couple of weeks. Went on today only to find out that Donald Trump killed Herman Cain. What kind of a campaign slogan is that? Okay, see you all soon.
At the 2016 Republican convention, Trump officially seized the mantle of the ‚Äúlaw and order‚Äù candidate ‚Äî an obvious dog whistle playing to white fears of Black crime, even though crime in the US is historically low
Trump has been repeatedly slow to condemn white supremacists who endorse him, and he regularly retweeted messages from white supremacists and neo-Nazis during his presidential campaign.
is a racist. There is no place for racism in America. And, there is no place for Trump in America. He has to go. And, I don't care where... to Russia, to jail, to hell. I just want him to go away and let us be the UNITED States of America again.
He argued in 2016 that Judge Gonzalo Curiel ‚Äî who was overseeing the Trump University lawsuit ‚Äî should recuse himself from the case because of his Mexican heritage and membership in a Latino lawyers assoc
true, but i think we can agree that the trump family is toxic.
No doubt. Hoping for a return to brighter days in January.   I can say that if for the 8 years prior to Trump‚Äôs inauguration the office of the president was occupied by a ham sandwich, I‚Äôd likely miss the sandwich in comparison to the shit show we have now.
As a candidate in 2015, Trump called for a ban on all Muslims coming into the US. His administration eventually implemented a significantly watered-down version of the policy.
Thats why i made the comment. Because Mr Cain was a Trump supporter. And thats what i imagine Trump would say about his passing. Because he and his supporters refuse to acknowledge Covid-19 as a serious/deadly virus.
Trump has proved how very fragile our democracy is. We cannot let this happen. We cannot let our democracy be destroyed by a despicable man like trump. Vote like your life depends on it. It does.
Trump launched his campaign in 2015 by calling Mexican immigrants ‚Äúrapists‚Äù who are ‚Äúbringing crime‚Äù and ‚Äúbringing drugs‚Äù to the US. His campaign was largely built on building a wall to keep these immigrants out of the US.
2011: he also argued that mb Obama wasn‚Äôt a good enough student to have gotten into Columbia or Harvard, and demanded Obama release his university transcripts. Trump claimed, ‚ÄúI heard he was a terrible student. Terrible. How does a bad student go to Columbia and then to Harvard?
The people living in the hills of Kentucky and the boot heel of Missouri are exhaling with relief at trump‚Äôs assurance that no black people will be coming to spoil their trailer parks!
If by now, they still support and defend Trump/GOP, then what do you think? Tell them they're idiots, so they don't confuse silence with agreement, and block them promptly. Arguing entrenches them.
2011: Trump played a big role in pushing false rumors that Obama ‚Äî the country‚Äôs first Black president ‚Äî was not born in the US. He even sent investigators to Hawaii to look into Obama‚Äôs birth certificate.
2010:On The Late Show With David Letterman, Trump argued, referring to Muslims, ‚ÄúWell, somebody‚Äôs blowing us up. Somebody‚Äôs blowing up buildings, and somebody‚Äôs doing lots of bad stuff.‚Äù
Not his call.
2000: In opposition to a casino proposed by the St. Regis Mohawk tribe, which he saw as a financial threat to his casinos in Atlantic City, Trump secretly ran a series of ads suggesting the tribe had a ‚Äúrecord of criminal activity [that] is well documented.‚Äù
I‚Äôm person is always better.  How can you argue it‚Äôs not?  So you‚Äôre saying there is no way the Left wouldn‚Äôt try to do anything underhanded to try and take out a sitting Republican President?  Especially one as polarizing as Trump.
1993: In congressional testimony, Trump said that some Native American reservations operating casinos shouldn‚Äôt be allowed because ‚Äúthey don‚Äôt look like Indians to me
Calling him Eric Cartmen implies some kind of intelligence as Eric Cartman is a scheming mf who is pretty cunning. Donald Trump is legitimately stupid.
Case of ex-Trump aide Flynn to be reheard by full U.S. appeals court
1992: The Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino had to pay a $200,000 fine because it transferred Black and women dealers off tables to accommodate a big-time gambler‚Äôs prejudices
Don't fall for the  video of Trump trashing his voters. Project Veritas is a right-wing, pro-Trump group. They're just trying to get people riled up. More deflection from his failures.
1991:Trump‚Äôs criticism of a Black accountant: ‚ÄúBlack guys counting my money! I hate it. The only kind of people I want counting my money are short guys that wear yarmulkes everyday. I think that the guys lazy. And it‚Äôs probably not his fault, because laziness is a trait in blacks
Trump is too busy trying to remember those 5 words.
Also, this what happens when The Stonks hear that Trump is openly musing about how to become a dictator. Someone summon the ghost of Immanuel Wallerstein...
Help Me Find Trump‚Äôs ‚ÄòAnarchists‚Äô in Portland
1989:The teens‚Äô convictions were later vacated after they spent seven to 13 years in prison, and the city paid $41 million in a settlement to the teens. But Trump in October 2016 said he still believes they‚Äôre guilty, despite the DNA evidence to the contrary.
Add in top of this Biden‚Äôs soft ban through taxation of firearms and ‚Äúhigh capacity magazines‚Äù why would any 2A advocate oppose Trump? He not trying to strip their rights or censor their speech. They know that he can‚Äôt delay the election. This is all talk eck.
i wish trump would follow freds teachings
1988: In a commencement speech at Lehigh University, Trump spent much of his speech accusing countries like Japan of ‚Äústripping the United States of economic dignity.‚Äù This matches much of his current rhetoric on China.
No my science is all the studies which show little evidence.  It definitely doesn‚Äôt explain why Cain is dead, because you have no idea where he got it from.  And btw, I don‚Äôt belong to anybody‚Äôs cult (and I didn‚Äôt vote for Trump).  Life and liberty = no masks.
He went to Trump‚Äôs Tulsa rally.
1980s: Kip Brown, a former employee at Trump‚Äôs Castle, accused another one of Trump‚Äôs businesses of discrimination ‚ÄúWhen Donald &amp; Ivana came to the casino, the bosses would order all the black people off the floor,‚Äù It was the eighties, I was a teenagerThey put us all in the back
Trump should provide assistance to those that remain and need to get out first
1973: The US Department of Justice ‚Äî under the Nixon administration, out of all administrations ‚Äîsued the Trump Management Corporation for violating the Fair Housing Act. Federal officials found evidence that Trump had refused to rent to Black tenants and lied to Black applicants
in joy once we get Trump out of the White House
Didn‚Äôt Marco Rubio try this tactic on something outrageous Trump said before?
You‚Äôre right about the fraudulent death counts! They‚Äôre vastly underreported and it will be even worse now that Trump has gagged the CDC.
And seeing is his base would be ok with an attempt (Trump has done this before), and the third, and most notable, is Trump is laying groundwork to attempt to delegitimize an election that doesn‚Äôt seem like it is going to turn out in his favor.
Unlike a lot of my associates, I do understand this fear, as the Trump administration has been caught doing many things that aren‚Äôt exactly legal or constitutional, but it‚Äôs worth considering that the courts have consistently not upheld Executive Actions that are broader
Now, don‚Äôt get me wrong, I do not believe there is a legal mechanism for Trump to successfully delay the election. This is one issue that most decidedly not within the powers of the President. Not that I would say that it is beyond the realm of possibility to ATTEMPT such an
The real problem we have is if Trump announces right before the election that it is canceled. Throwing it into chaos. All the Democrats will go out and vote and then trump will declare it an invalid election because his folk didn‚Äôt turn out because they listened to him
‚ÄòNot the time to act in fear.‚Äô Top Kansas election official rejects Trump‚Äôs idea
Trump allowed this virus to devastate America. Other countries responded competently and stifled, contained it. Trump did his useless, racist shit - that you admire so much - that let the virus explode here. Trump killed Secretary Cain. #TrumpKilledSecretaryCain #TrumpVirus
Nobody deserves to die, but when you call COVID a hoax, push misinformation that kills people, go to Trump rallies without a mask, you are literally bringing it upon yourself. No sympathy here.
Kris Kobach headed a commission creat by Trump to investigate an alleged 3 million cases of voting fraud. They found nothing, and disbanded. Kobach investigated voter fraud here in Kansas, claim tens of thousands of cases. He found 12. In 8 years.
Trump is full of bull
It is a shame that the people this affects the most are the very people Trump and Republicans abuse with virtually all their policies, immigrants and low-income Americans.
It‚Äôs so obvious that Trump is fucked and he knows it, and he‚Äôs going to do anything from slowing down the post office to suggesting we delay the elections to keep from facing the inevitable. He will die in jail.
Hey  - cash me on 5th Avenue.   How bout dat?   *Donald Trump can't delay November's presidential election without Congress, partially controlled by the Democrats, first approving the decision. If he didn't already know this, someone has certainly told him by now!
I wonder if you didn't already know what the books you read contained. Nothing I've learned about Trump from reviews of anti-Trump books has appreciably changed my mind about him. He's as bad as I always knew from observing him. Read the classics for perspective on our times.
Some folks can‚Äôt stop watching trump fuck up ü§£ü§£ü§£
You act surprised that there is a bias in the media but you are biased every day you are on the air.  Why not just start off every broadcast with "I hate Trump, so consider my comments in that context".  Be transparent.
Careful, Trump will include them in his China ban and Josh Hawley will write a nasty letter about them.
Trump is over here floating the idea of delaying the election. Thank god he doesn‚Äôt have that power. That‚Äôs on Congress. If we can open school in Sept we can vote in November.
The descent of the GOP into completely lacking any kind of spine is terrifying. I can already imagine the praise they will heap on Trump for thinking of moving it.
Wow! It‚Äôs amazing how Donald Trump makes George Bush look like a saint....
That Trump is a racist, white supremist, etc are widely-used democrat talking points that I don‚Äôt subscribe to. I wonder if Carol Folt subscribes!? Would she come out and endorse Joe Biden for President? She seems to have a political bent and maybe wants to unburden herself.
Trump will next claim he has the absolute right to delay the election.
Biden must be picking #Oprah for VP. She is Trump‚Äôs biggest enemy. #OprahWinfrey for VP!!!
Because trump tells them
He went to Trump's rally spouting anti mask bullshit. It's very necessary.
Trump's politicization of mask wearing is probably his greatest crime.
He knows whats going on is bullshit. It‚Äôs all a game and he knows what the media reaction will be. I follow economists that have predicted a ton of events including last election. Algo‚Äôs all saying Trump in a landslide. Social media algo also knows which is why all the censoring.
Herman Cain dies.....Trump goes silent.....
Trump's politicization of mask wearing is probably his greatest crime.
Trump cannot delay the election. That is up to Congress and it won‚Äôt happen.
Yes, because we're better than trump and/or trumpers would be
Here is what I recall from Civics and Con Law...first of all, the election date is fixed by the Constitution, so tRump can't delay it, and even if he could the Speaker of the House would become President at the end of his term. Does he want #PresidentPelosi? I could live with it.
When they arrest Trump finally for one of his numerous crimes, let‚Äôs pray it‚Äôs done like his secret police have been assaulting people on the street to arrest them during the protests.  Wouldn‚Äôt that be karma! #DumpTrump2020
let‚Äôs make President Trump another 4 more years and a second term for him #MakeAmericaGreatAgain
Trump doesn‚Äôt joke, he IS a joke!  ü§®
All of Trump's bullshittery about the election isn't so he can delay, it's so he can call it illegitimate. He does nothing on foreign interference so he can use it as an excuse. Calling for a delay he can't actually make? "Now it's all invalid, I'm still president!"
If Donald Trump wanted to be a shitty fucking standup comedian I sure wish he wouldn't have ran for President of the United States
it‚Äôs not unlikely Cain got this at the rally. Trump is killing people; whether through rallies or his complete failure to manage the pandemic on a nat‚Äôl level or through abandoning the most vulnerable (low-income communities have alarming mortality rates:
Very important thread to read while trump is busy trying to distract from his failing campaign and the fact that all eyes and hearts are with  today
He got sick within the incubation period after having attended Trump‚Äôs pathetic Tulsa Rally with no mask. He was an anti-masker.
Yes I'm voting for President Trump state of Missouri
Did you see the hearings this week with AG Barr? The way they treated him was shameful. They have acted like petulant children since Trump was elected.
"Who came up with the idea of terms limits? Maybe they are a good idea, maybe they're not. I think I'm doing a great job. I've done more for America than any other President. Nobody has seen anything like it. I think I should be able to run in 2024."  -Trump in 2021
Wear the mask!  Trump people are idiots not Matter the color!  #HermanCain
This is today‚Äôs gentle reminder that Trump is not Lincoln and he sure isn‚Äôt FDR.

President Trump PLEASE do an Executive Order to ban mail-in voting &amp; mandate Voter ID nationwide!!
All of you are willing to endanger our children.  I‚Äôm not.  If Trump thinks it is too dangerous to hold an election, why is he sending our children back to school?  Answer that, Lindsay.
Trump is like a student who didn‚Äôt study for midterms and decided to ask the professors to cancel the exams for him and, when the professors refused, he then decided to email the school with bomb threats.
‚ÄúThe Great trump Dump‚Äù
There trump goes again - trying to unring a bell.
"I don‚Äôt kid" - Donald Trump on his order to slow testing down after aides told reporters he was joking
I asked in another thread if this was on video. The Secretary of State refuses to answer a simple question on Presidential authority to which we all know the answer. Trump can't delay the election but what could the entire GOP &amp; their 40% of Americans due collectively you think?
Do we know if Herman signed the waiver? I bet he didn‚Äôt get his Tulsa tickets online like the Tik Tok teens so did he sign a paper waiver? Trump and campaign better hope so.
Attend Trump rally in middle of pandemic. Get diagnosed with Covid 19 a week later. Get admitted to hospital due to Covid 19. Die.  So sad that this happened, why people can't accept the obvious about this virus is beyond me.
I‚Äôm a miss #TikTok! Trump just mad cause we like it! Don‚Äôt say China spying on us thru it or whatever.
No clue, but to do that wouldnt be Trump-like. Once a person isnt useful to Trump,  they cease to exist to him.
Perhaps someone should mention to them, that the Constitution specifies that, Trump &amp; Pence would still be required to leave office by noon on Jan. 20. With no successor, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, (Pelosi), would be next in line.   Who‚Äôs laughing now?
Oh, if he loses, they will launch Trump TV. Take it to the bank.
Actually Cornyn said ‚ÄúTrump IS A joke‚Äù.
I don't know Chris Wallace's bookers and don't work for the Biden campaign. I think what Trump advocates should worry about is his success/failure at communicating a message that isn't seen as weak/addled. Take me off the thread. Thanks.
I was among the biggest critics of Bush while in office, but at least I always knew we just disagreed and he was ultimately, a decent man.    Trump couldn‚Äôt be bothered to attend Rep. Lewis‚Äô ceremony but has no problem fitting in 18 every week. #trumpsucks #VOTE
So children can go back to school but we can‚Äôt vote? Trump logic. #TrumpIsANationalDisgrace
JUST IN:  Former presidential candidate and Trump enthusiast  has passed away from his battle with #COVID19.
Kan. Secretary of State asks delegation to oppose Trump's election delay suggestion
I mean seriously, all Trump did was suggest moving it. Just like presidents have been suggesting things that requires Congressional action for centuries. This is so not a big deal.
So your argument is: Trump can't delay or cancel the election because... "Constitution"?  Stop. You're killing me.
NO. NO. NO. THIS MUST BE STOPPED.   Donald Trump  Suggests Presidential Election Should Be Delayed
Lmao now y‚Äôall wanna fight for black lives when he‚Äôs a trump supporter üòÇüòÇüòÇ
Trump stans crack me up.
Ya better send out the Trump Troops....!
Trump is playing 4D chess on a consistent basis recently.
Trump has been pimping the shit outta this country and he is gonna win again cause y‚Äôall don‚Äôt want niggas to shop at your Aldi üòÇüòÇüòÇ
Except Trump made it considerably harder for that to happen.
Amen. Trump is a blight
And racist hater trump...sure doesnt!!! He is such a hater, how can a person if color like him???
Trump is disturbed.
Anytime you turn on a tv, it‚Äôs like turning on the live feed from a daycare. Fits being thrown. Arguing. Tantrums. Bullying. Fucking stupid. Both sides. Not just repubs. Not just Trump. Not just Pelosi or Schumer. All of them.
Every living President except  are are at John Lewis's funeral.  Why is Trump not there, he is trying to divide the nation.  He thinks he can't win unless he stirs up hate! What he doesn't realize is that most of us White people love our Black brothers &amp; sisters.
Hawley is funded by Trump people. And he wants to be in a presidential ticket. So calculated.
Trump is brilliantly tickling middle class white American with the ‚Äúyour house value will drop‚Äù racist fear monger bullshit. That‚Äôs the demographic he needs to vote for him again to win.
He praised Trump for not requiring masks at the rally that he went to. The one where it looks like he caught the virus. And then died.  Herman Cain politicized his own death.
it's a particularly bad day for Trump. Look forward to the ads!  McCain, Lewis, GDP, the economy, 152,000 dead, Plantation capitalism, Pence unmasked get together today in Pa, James Lawson, postpone the election! #GoodTrouble
Agree with others, unless Donald Trump gets it then it will be no one he cares about...
No, like trump!
The Constitution specifies that the Speaker of the House becomes acting President due to a delayed Election. As commander-in-chief, Pelosi could send the military to pull Trump out of the White House.
It's sad trump and his cult got Herman Cain killed.
Because Trump knows he will lose!
All for a rally. For a man who dgaf about u. Sad but iz what it iz
Why the Democratic Party is just as irredeemable as Donald Trump
Trump* gets another "worst in US history" title! The U.S. economy shrank at a dizzying 33% annual rate in the April-June quarter ‚Äî by far the worst quarterly plunge ever.  via  #Economy #VoteBlue2020
Trump: "There will be no more low-income housing forced into the suburbs."   In 1973, the Justice Department filed a civil rights case against Trump‚Äôs company, accusing him of violating the Fair Housing Act by not renting to Black tenants.
If you could reason with Trump supporters there would be no Trump supporters
Sorry Spanky, your giveaway to the Pentagon and Trump is a nonstarter. We need a bill that will take care of everyday Americans
Oh the irony.  Anything Trump doesn't like is "A great embassassment to the counry".  I hope to heaven we never have an embarrassment like that of the Trump administration ever again.  An abysmal death dealing failure! #TedSpeaksTheTruth
Being a trump fan  That's a deal breaker. And I've lost friends over it
New York Times said it helped them in past.  Changing their tune a bit now.  Same with Washington Post.  Though they think it would help rural Trump voters.  NPR says it a security issue as they are not very secure.  How can you be sure who cast the vote?
Abrams was cheated out of votes because of voter suppression.  Trump is already saying that if he loses, he doesn't trust the system. The exact same system that got him elected in the first place ü§îü§î
Proving that  was right. Everything Trump touches, dies. #ETTD
Trump killed him at his rally.
They never err on the Trump side
I will vote by any means I can even if it means going to designated place. Even though I am in a high risk class to do so. Nothing will stop me because we must stop Trump and his CULT followers. If not for ourselves then for our future family members.  KC voter for #JoeBiden2020
Trump can only be Trump with a supporting cast of a enablers. Mr. Cain chose his path and my thoughts are with the heartbroken family members he left behind.
So the president will be Leahy as president pro tem of the senate takes over on January 20. So trump is screwed tyen.
I joined a ‚ÄúFarmers and Country Folk Against Trump‚Äù group on FB to see if I could get some insight on what points resonate w/ that demographic but it has been zero help because all they do it talk shit too üòÇ
He died on a ventilator. He died of COVID. He died because he attended Trump‚Äôs irresponsible rally and contradicted Trump‚Äôs virus. Nice job to deflect though.
That‚Äôs Trump for ya. He has a hard time being considerate üòÇ
Impeach the SOB. Impeach him again. In the meantime, make your congressman and senators' phones red-hot with your calls. They have got to have a plan to drag his ass out of the White House.   And vote in numbers so vast that Trump is crushed like an empty nutshell.  #Election2020
#WeWillVote - I wont be afraid to stand up to the trump dictatorship
In point of fact people like you who are #CureDeniers are responsible for the deaths loss of liberty &amp; isolation of millions simply because you refuse to accept the 60+year-old cheap cure to this ‚Äúvirus‚Äù #HCQCURES I attended Trump Tulsa Rally unmasked &amp; I still feel fabulous!
I wish people would stop buying into Trump's bulshit. Focus, he is the king of chaos.  He will go to any length to hear us scream and to watch people squirm and freak out over *his* statements.  Let's not fear him, let's plow over him shall we!  ‚úäüèº‚úäüèª‚úäüèΩ
I deleted my original tweet...it was as rude and offensive in speech as is Trump. My intent, however, is clear....Do not allow this monster to lay the foundation of his Dynasty.  #OustTheIllegitimatePresident
"The depth of economic devastation our nation is experiencing is not an act of God, it's a failure of presidential leadership.   Had President Trump taken immediate &amp; decisive action, 10s of thousands of lives &amp; millions of jobs would never have been lost"   ~
It's real!  #COVID19 What a price to pay for NOT WEARING A MASK to a Trump Rally.
Trump's tweet about possibly delaying the election because of mailin ballots may just be the final straw for many people.  A lifelong Republican I may be, but there does come a point...
Trump floats November election delay, but it won‚Äôt happen
Truly disgusted you would leverage the death of this honorable man for your TDS mouthpiece!  Sadly, this is typical behavior of leftists, and given a claimed GOP policy involvement past, you show you are truly disingenuous! It is people like you that are why so many vote Trump!
just read your article on Trump possibly having connection to Hydroxychloroquine. Just plain bad reporting. No evidence to support your claim besides the fact that one person suggested this back in April. No sources to cite how this could be possible. Terrible.
There was plenty wrong with America that Obama and Co. caused which was the main reason Trump was elected. The reasons still stand. The DNC is not good or healthy for America as can be seen by the actions of their leaders in the throes of their almost 4 year temper tantrum.
Now would be a good time for all the sociopathic trump supporters to hop on...
Cain‚Äôs death, just announced. Honoring John Lewis, as President Obama will give his final farewell to the legend who paved the way for him, that‚Äôs the top news of the day. And Trump knew it when he sent that tweet.   Undermine the election, keep the focus on himself.
Are you ashamed yet D. Trump?  I know you're not because you have no soul.  Your failure to lead during the pandemic has you covered in the blood of the innocent you can never wash away.  You are a failure and a fraud.  RESIGN!! #TedSpeaksTheTruth
On your first point.. NO CHANCE, I can send you artical after artical of biased and unfair characterizations of something Trump said or did.  I agree more discussion between the sides are needed, but it‚Äôs not 1 sided.
This didn't have to happen ... another needless death due to the recklessness of Donald Trump.I Second that...."even" if had started in China they quickly got it under control, while tRUMP was calling it a Hoax....
Sure you have. Your own line of tweets tell a different story- you‚Äôre a gullible idiot. Do get back to me with your proof. Don‚Äôt tell me to search for it. Credible proof, not from some nut job website or cult BS. Nothing from OANN or any right wing Trump fluffer. I‚Äôll wait
Not true, and even if it was- how does that change the fact that Trump has been a failure at every turn? And he even tried to delay the election with complete BS, despite the fact that it‚Äôs not Constitutional. I called my sec of state‚Äôs office to confirm. He can‚Äôt do it
End the bs then and work with trump and republicans out from behind closed doors! Like you want but you can‚Äôt reveal your two faced bs you use to manipulate your supporters!
That‚Äôs the democratic way, instead of working with Trump you resists and ruining your corrupt way over the last 50 years you‚Äôve been in Congress!
You don‚Äôt tweet them, you can‚Äôt even talk or do interviews! Don‚Äôt work joe you‚Äôre right we must re-elect Trump 2020
Nope. Trump could be filmed live on camera in a killing spree and they would still excuse it
Trump spews shit for 45 min and there‚Äôs not a journalist in the house. Slow pitch softball ü•é
Pompeo can testify all he wants but tRUMP cannot move the election date of November 3rd, 2020.... but we the people can and will remove a turd....
He did it to himself since he is just as ignorant as trump.
The misinformation comes from Trump. Hate to break it to you
#HydroxychloroquineWorks Please President Trump make it available to all Americans!
Yea even though I support him, sometimes trump is just....üôÑ
Exactly! Trump 2020üá∫üá∏
OMG!  This is the person that was elected to lead our country?  Shame on tRump voters that don't realize their mistake!  His corona virus briefing is disgusting.  He can never admit he is wrong much less offer hope.  Mary Trump's book is right on target and it is scary!
Trump is the catastrophic emergency. Jeez, lady, put down that glass of kool aid for a minute.
Guess what - me and a lot of my elderly friends will NOT be voting for Trump no matter what it takes to vote. Even if it means standing in lines in the middle of a pandemic along side idiots not wearing masks. It‚Äôs that important to get Trump the hell out.
Walsh on Trump tweet: I don't give a damn if he's joking, he said it
Trump not accepting results of 2020 election before it takes place.
Delay the election. Ridiculous.  Refuse to leave the White House. Ridiculous.  Donald Trump. Ridiculous  #dumptrump #votebiden #voteblue
This Trump supporter was shown evidence that the Nazis were fascist, not socialist, and has been told that all historians will tell you the same thing. But Jenny here knows more than all the historians. Trump loves the poorly educated. #Biden2020
That black fist looks like total disrespect to our flag. Trump 2020, Trump Jr. 2024
I've said it once and I'll say it again, Trump has made Obama look way better than he was. Why didn't he push for these while in office?
If Trump has to acknowledge that the country fell to shit under his watch, he‚Äôs already lost.
Good no one will be watching Trump the traitor &amp; Putins puppet.
Just like Trump the cameras show up when it‚Äôs a Covid update &amp; vicarage them nothing to be on the news at 5.
Managed to hold elections during Civil War and WWII... I think we can manage thank you: GOP leaders shoot down Trump suggestion to 'delay the election'  via
Welp I wasn't worried about Trump's call to delay the election until I read this thread... pretty frightening stuff.
I‚Äôm a school board member. Last week I voted to start school 100% virtual. Part of my reason was that Trump took hospital data away from CDC
Did more for this country than Trump could/would do in 2 lifetimes.
Hey tRump!  Did you see the president, the "real" president speak?  It was directed at you!
#WeWillVote to kick Trump out of office on November 3
I agree. But every tweet about pizza that is attacked by qanon doesn‚Äôt have anything actually to do with child trafficking. The Q movement has latched onto this and will call anyone who posts about pizza a pedophile, except the trump family. It‚Äôs extremely odd and unsettling.
Every news channel coved Congressman John Lewis funeral except OANN and Newsmax which I refer to as Trump's Nazi News. Shame on them.
Yes I do like Trump!
It‚Äôs not allowed by the Constitution. I called my Secretary of State‚Äôs office, and they confirmed that is not constitutional. There needs to be major pushback against Trump‚Äôs blatantly false words
Your average Trump supporter, folks. They really believe this crap. #Biden2020 #TrumpThreatensAmerica
Obama made his remarks about Louis, unlike Trump , who no matter the subject,always makes it all about him.
Right? In what universe does California go red? Especially with the train wreck that is Trump
It‚Äôs not grandstanding to speak of equality, love and compassion.  It‚Äôs such a relief from the hatred spewed every time Trump and his minions opens their mouths.
Right now, I just want to get Trump out, and then maybe we can go back to a more normal election in 2024.
He‚Äôs a grifter. I‚Äôm sure he‚Äôll wind up on one of the Fox News clones after Trump loses
Whataboutism and a photo don‚Äôt take away from the fact that Trump has over 25 women and one child accuse him of sexual assault. Care to address that without deflection?
He won't be the only one from that Tulsa rally. And trust me Trump won't bat and eye over it. He only cares about getting reelected. So he can then  enforce his totalitarianism agenda across America.
Trying to imply Trump rallies to blame.
trump: ‚Äúlet‚Äôs let children go to school, BUT we should wait for voting as it‚Äôs not safe for the people.‚Äù SHUT UP
Looks like Congressional Rs are hitting the right notes. Except Cornyn and his dumb "it was a joke" line.
Let's not sugar coat this or place blame anywhere else than right at tRump's feet!  He did this, and continues to do nothing and we have all suffered and will continue to suffer until his corrupt ass is kicked to the BLACK LIVES MATTER curb on Nov. 3rd
And he listened and supported tRump espousing the benefits of not wearing a mask. Now he is dead.  He will also leave a legacy of why you definitely wear a mask when their is a pandemic raging all around you!
I try to avoid potentially dangerous COVID-19 situations as much as possible, but I will gladly take the risk to vote Trump out of office in November.
When Trump first came onto the scene and everyone was calling him racist, fascist, etc., I thought it was all hyperbole.  Unfortunately, he has proven all the hyperbole to be true.
LIAR.  The malignancy of you, tRump and the GOP knows no bounds.  Millions of American's are going to drop off a financial cliff because of the Republican's and that is why you will all be gone come November.  Thank God.
Hydroxychloroquine Study Finds the Drug 'Significantly' Cuts Death Rate
So faced with facts you spout platitudes and don‚Äôt even address it. Typical Trump supporter
After attending the Tulsa Trump Ralley - without a mask -  #SCIENCEisREAL #TrustFauci
Trump is alright crying foul on the 2020 election in Nov. Knowing he is going to lose. He want to delay the election to disavow the voting process, so he can try and shore up his #.  BBC News - Donald Trump suggests delay to 2020 US presidential election
, when are YOU going to LEARN  President Trump is IN THIS PRESIDENCY to ACTUALLY BENEFIT WE AMERICAN CITIZENS,  UNLIKE the Communist,  Lying, State-Run MSM, CNN,MSNBC, WE AMERICAN CITIZENS don't TRUST YOU ALL ANYMORE, nor LISTEN to YOU ALL ANYMORE= USE YOUR OWN BRAIN.
Trump doesn‚Äôt care if it is truthful
How much stock was Trump given?
Last month, Cain had tested positive for COVID-19, just a little¬†over a week after he had attended a Trump campaign rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma on June 20... Now a month later, he's dead!   His death, like the other 150K+ Americans, is on  .
Trump suggests delaying election, warns mail-in ballots to result in ‚ÄòINACCURATE &amp; FRAUDULENT‚Äô vote. What‚Äôs the matter Dems? You say it‚Äôs to dangerous to vote. He‚Äôs giving you than the right choice.
Herman McCain died from CO-19 today, please God trump next!
Congress has sole power to change elections. Not Trump. And per the constitution Trump's term ends 1/20/21 whether there is an election or not! Nice try Donnie
GOP members up fo re-election are signing their death warrants as elected officials. When the election is over if Biden wins if the US and UN don‚Äôt hold all members that did not impeach Trump, Pence, and Trump should be charged mass murder Nuremberg II. Then he shot 150000
Saying they love Donald Trump as president.
Everyone knew trump would try to f with the election
FUCK YOU DONALD TRUMP.This is horse shit
Yet more proof that Trump is a hypocrite
I ask republican legislators, if Trump goes down with the historic margins the poles are showing now and you are still in office, will you stand up and say how proud you were to have  served him so diligently?   I think you will be like Judas and deny him.
Trump can't figure out why Fox News isn't as supportive as it was 4 years ago.   He's the only one.
Earlier you told us that Trump-Russia Collusion was true.
Mr. Trump. Be advised that democrats are going to vote with more determination than your supporter did in 2016.  People who voted against Clinton won't vote for you  And you failed the people who voted to give you a chance won't vote you. You failed them. #voteblue #votebiden
He‚Äôs a trump ass kisser. He thinks this is going to win votes.
WE ARE DONE UNLESS WE VOTE TRUMP IN!
You never actually answered the question. How many times has Trump sat down with CNN? Or MSNBC? Or anywhere besides Fox or their many imitators?
But when Trump brags about being a ‚Äústable genius‚Äù and his ‚Äúbig brain‚Äù, you cheer him? Hypocrite much?
She learned well from Trump
What I'd like to know is where did Trump's witch doctor got her degree?
Apparently someone has finally figured out the violence in Oregon was exacerbated by having federal officers there. They are withdrawing. It wasn't Trump who figured it out. He told Fox news they weren't leaving. Go figure. It won't take much effort. #votebiden #voteblue
Ah, pivoting to another talking point because you have no adequate defense. Another time honored Trump supporter tactic
Can't give up on taking Trump down.   Keep throwing the coal on the fire.  And let's not forget Moscow Mitch.   Ridding our government of those two is the minimum. #voteblue #votebiden
I'm surprised that there isn't a stampede of Trump staff heading for the hills. I guess they are as ignorant as he is. Trump's ship is sinking. Being on it when it goes under makes no sense. #voteblue #votebiden
Couldn't have gotten much for him. Perhaps Trump was born out of the dreams that the black doctor he likes so much talks about.
Curious coincidence that two trumps put up posts obviously false for digital talk media to take down just when their CEOs are being grilled by Dems. in congress. I believe facebook helped trump purposefully in 2016.
Sorta like how y'all think Traitor Trump is God.
As you spread the Trump Virus!
need a lesson in insults? The best one you had you copied from me!       Here‚Äôs tip.   Stick with one good insult instead of 3 that‚Äôs don‚Äôt fit!   Your a classic Trump supporter.  You can‚Äôt argue topics so you go straight for personal insults that are most likely self reflection
Than it's current state of affairs. And also, Trump isn't gonna be president forever. Once a Democrat gets into power and he/she decides it's time for a clean up. I can guarantee you that social media censorship will be worse now that it would be in the hands of the state.
And to the shock of absolutely no one, the Trump supporter misses the point.
Too coherent to be trump
Even if we throw Trump out in Nov will we make it to January? WTH is going on? 12,000 troops being pulled out of Germany? That's a gift to Putin. No wonder he doesn't want to talk about his conversations with him. He needs to be stopped. Do the Reps really want this to happen?
Everyday I think Trump can‚Äôt get any worse, and everyday he proves me wrong üòå‚ú®
So you‚Äôre okay with destruction of property as long as it isn‚Äôt federal property? That‚Äôs an odd take for someone who presumably supports the rule of law. You should go smash up a statehouse with your guns... oh wait, you guys did that and Trump gave them his blessing.
They will do anything Trump tells them. The documentaries and the books that will be written about Trump and his band of morons are going to be amazing. And the historians...
This guy is just... wow. Trump lives the poorly educated. And this guy definitely is if he thinks anything he said is convincing or winning him anything. At this point I almost pity him...
Boy I sure can‚Äôt wait to see his emails to the Trump administration about protecting troops against Russian bounties or POTUS encouraging Chinese concentration camps.
I‚Äôm not a young woman and NOTHING will stop me from voting on November 3. I‚Äôll stand in rain, snow, amid a pandemic surrounded by idiots without masks to vote for Biden.  Trump will do anything to steal this election.
Trump still calling the Russian bounties fake news.   Didn't talk about it with Putin in a recent call.   Unbelievable.   What did he talk about?   Ways Putin could help him win in November?
Vlad is pleased. Trump hands Europe to Russia. You thinking times about up better get it done. That recent phone call to putin, you didn't bring up the bounty on American soldiers because you didn't bring up anything. You just recieved instructions didn't you donnie boy. We know
Looks like trump will have to get someone else to get the martinis on the plane tonight. Lost their gomar.
May have to send in Capital Police to remove trump.
He refused to acknowledge Trump so sorry!! Could care less!!
Since you believe that we only need one piece of evidence for something to be true, I would think you would understand that Umbrella Man from the article is clearly a Trump supporter? Why do you support right wing violence?
The GOP'S Congress, has their (Back Turned) to the American People, only open to tRUMP and Clonies....
Again, there was a hearing. Take off your Trump goggles and listen to the charges they laid out. It‚Äôs called youtube- go search for it!
Because most votes in Congress are't very radical and are more often about regular old GOP objectives with little to do with Trump.
Let me guess trump supporter Governors? How did I know that? Deniers? Shame the innocent will die along with the idiots, that‚Äôs the sad part, if it only killed idiots I‚Äôd be ok with it.
President Trump IS DOING HIS JOB, &amp; has been for ALMOST 4 YEARS, even with ALL the ATTACKS, LIES by the Socialist Democrats,Progressives,Liberals,Left,Radical Left,Communist, State-Run, Propagandist MSM,Hollywood, &amp; He will for 4 MORE YEARS, His SUPPORTERS are SO NUMEROUS.
What about our troops?
Idk who  is to be completely honest, but I fuck with the Anti Trump tweets üî•üî•
Trump family=the people
I'm from Missouri and D J Trump has shown me who he's for.   "The Common Man".  God bless him.
You are very off topic now. We were discussing Trump‚Äôs reliance on quack doctors that believe in demon sperm and alien dna. Nothing you brought up is relevant to that. Swing and a miss
Lol Trump said fck Germany ü•¥   US to withdraw nearly 12,000 troops from Germany in move that will cost billions and take years
YEAH, President Trump, TELL IT EXACTLY like IT IS, that's what I LOVE about YOU, to the POINT,  ALL OUR USA MILITARY are NOT the WORLD'S POLICE FORCE, PROMISE MADE &amp; KEPT, KEEP BRINGING THEM HOME, don't LISTEN to VOICES who SAY NAY, I SAY YES, &amp; I'm SURE their FAMILIES AGREE.
Trump and Barr cannot dispatch federal agents to take over local law enforcement activities simply because they might think local police are doing a poor job.
Joe's HIDEOUS HIDEOUS RUN as SOC DEM Candidate is going to his INFLATED HEAD, ONLY President TRUMP &amp; SAVVY BUSINESSMAN CAN &amp; WILL REBUILD our ECONOMY &amp;  doing so NOW, 14 MILLION JOBS  ALREADY, POOR OLD JOE, PRESIDENT TRUMP is 14 MILLION STEPS AHEAD of him.
Great, Mo. now on the do not visit list, maybe it‚Äôs because Mo. has a Covid denier governor or maybe it‚Äôs because we have a 93% republican house whatever the reason. Mo. Covid rate is going up 389% daily. (Below) me protesting at Trump rally.
Trump is not only an idiot with declining mental capacity, he has to be was on some drugs that make him think UFO alien DNA is turning people into atheists, and that black American reporters actually look like Michael Bloomberg. He may need an involuntary mental evaluation.
Hi Connie, NO WAY, President Trump is ALMIGHTY GOD'S ANOINTED &amp; CHOSEN ONE for a TIME SUCH AS THIS,  I TRULY BELIEVE Our ALMIGHTY GOD will GIVE US a SEASON of HIS PEACE &amp; UNITY, I TRUST in HIM TOTALLY,  HE is WAITING for US ALL to DO LIKEWISE &amp; PRAY,  show NO INDIFFERENCE to HIM.
Sad that we even have to think about this. There is genuine fear about what trump will do if he loses in November.
If you don‚Äôt think we are going to have to forcefully remove trump and cabinet members from office you are naive. The election is already rigged. There will be blood.
The last thing you should think of is him . The flag is a symbol of our republic. I have family buried in France after Normandy. He died to protect the republic. Trump should be flying the Rebel Battle Flag, he is George Wallace.
I agree with you on one important thing Mr. Trump, "nobody likes you".
Trump‚Äôs America
Trump is a derelict human being.
Madam Majority Leader, if you are not doing it, please start now. Review the laws being used by DHS to justify invading our cities uninvited. It is wrong. Fix it. Hopefully, the tsunami that wipes out Trump will take McConnell with him. Don't let it happen again.
President Trump texted, LAW AND ORDER this morning! Who was arrested?
Like how Putin can screw up our election to keep Trump in power?
I want Trump gone. He‚Äôs been an embarrassment and has brought turmoil and hatred long enough. Biden will bring dignity back to the presidency.
Odds are good Trump won‚Äôt do the debates. The day he takes a dementia test live will be truly hilarious, but will never come because he‚Äôs both a coward and a moron.
Shouldn‚Äôt you be working instead of posting this BS? There‚Äôs a pandemic- wait, you trust Dr Alien DNA. Go toddle off to a game of golf and let Dr Fauci and the actual experts handle the Trump virus.
Not to mention that Obama and Biden put together a pandemic response team and listened to medical experts. Trump dismantled the pandemic response team and ignores medical experts. #Biden2020
Trump's invasion of our cities is putting fuel on the fire of the anger and frustration of reasonable Americans. The jerk doesn't even realize that it won't win him votes from the silent majority that is going to take him down. #voteblue #votebiden #dumptrump
We know teachers will stand up for kids. Federal, and state gvmts wont. They only stand up for trump.
I mean, we could have if they had actually held the Republican convention in person like Trump wanted.
Uh huh. I will take the word of you, some random guy or girl on twitter, and the word of a quack doctor that Trump retweeted because she supports his (and your) so called miracle cure. I will completely accept that BS instead of the CDC during a pandemic that has killed 140K
Not xenophobic. But I‚Äôm pretty sure you chanted right along with Trump about his flimsy wall, so perhaps you are projecting? What med school did you attend? And in what year? Because I really don‚Äôt buy that you‚Äôre a doctor, buddy.
Someone who knows they‚Äôre above reproach, above the law, and has zero consequences for any of the actions or inactions. I hate to say it but he won‚Äôt face any disciplinary actions even after trump is gone.
Him and all the professional Trump fluffers on Twitter. It‚Äôs almost mesmerizing to watch. And laugh at.
I wonder how that kid feels, knowing he has ruined his entire political future by supporting Trump and this level of insanity
Seriously, alien dna? Demon sperm? Followed up with him scurrying from the room like a frightened mouse when  calls him on his BS? C‚Äômon,  have some goddamn dignity. You swore an oath to the US, not Trump. Act like it. #TrumpleThinSkin
Ah, I forgot that trump supporters have to have everything explained to them in simple terms. I don‚Äôt want to continue speaking with you. Can‚Äôt get much clearer than that.
The ‚Äúsilent majority‚Äù has never stopped yelling about Trump. Do you need a refresher on what silent means?
Maybe that‚Äôs because Trump is historically unpopular and he runs away from press briefings when he is asked about retweeting a doctor that believes in demon sperm and thinks we use alien dna? Just a thought.
Self-praised Prez Trump's chaotic leadership style didn't work crisis after crisis (That #MAGA is not working!). There will always be a crisis under any presidency. I can't vote for him to abandon us again.
Only way a Dem can win is by cheating! Virus is ploy to have mail in voting, democratic way to cheat! Trump 2020 üá∫üá∏ at the polling place!
I am a shamed to say I‚Äôm an American citizen . The Democrats are so far left, they‚Äôve been after pres. Trump before he even got elected. If Biden wins I can see a civil war in the US.he will attack the second amendment an try to take our guns
Not to mention Trump abolished the pandemic response team.
Maybe you'll attract some Russian Bots or skinheads. Have you run over to the WH to tell Trump?
This man and woman are for Trump! Trump 2020üá∫üá∏
Another part of the Constitution that Barr and Trump‚Äôs criminal cabal has violated! Thanks to Boris up there for pointing it out!
Because trump says he took it
I would have gotten Barak Obama to put in a curtain call and handle it.There would today be a lot less dead Americans because that would have been president Obamas goal.Trump has a goal of whatever is best for trump and not nearly enough brains to reason out what that is. üá∫üá∏üì¨
Twitter, you need to give Donald Trump Jr. His accessibility back. We need to know the truth.....you suck Twitter!
Every question Trump doesn‚Äôt like is ‚Äúfake‚Äù, ‚Äústupid ‚Äú or ‚Äúnasty‚Äù. Decorum went out the door the minute he declared his candidacy.
I don‚Äôt like Trump because he lies with every breath he takes. #WhyIDontLikeDonaldTrump
Nadler like every other corrupt politician been in congress for way too long need to go to have real change and not cause such resistance to trump trying to make good changes and undo the corrupt bs previous administration has done
Prez Trump leads the way to discredit a trusted scientist and then tell us all... they're in good term with Dr. Fauci. He's making everybody's challenging job so difficult in this health crisis. We all suffer too, more lives could be saved. RIP 150K.
Trump‚Äôs popularity would jump to 70% if he just shut up for two weeks.  He‚Äôs his own worst enemy.
Prez Trump has himself to be blamed. He provided us with rosy pictures that were not true (to preserve his "good" image or to promote his brand "Trump"). Obviously, somebody has to fact check that. Those lying need to stop... seriously, this is NOT in the process of #MAGA.
They might be giving Trump and his criminal cabal more rope to hang themselves with. Never interrupt your enemy when he is making a mistake.
Keep telling yourself that is what‚Äôs going to happen. Several red states, TX included, are competitive in a presidential election, and in your mind that automatically translates to a Trump landslide? Really?
I didn‚Äôt expect to get anything out of it anyway. Tit for tat. I am so sick of this mess everyday everyday. I can hardly wait for Trump to go so we can get some peace &amp; try to straighten out his mess, as Dems always do after a Rep Prez. This one is a big F U.
Just the start of Trump Police state.
I can not and will not let my children and grandchildren live through another trump term.
My opinion, if tRUMP is re-elected there will be no Presidency left, just Dictatorship....
Can you imagine how long Obama would have lasted if he had whined half as much as Trump?
President Trump has said, all pre-existing conditions will be covered! You don't have Obamacare crap, I did. You are a rude joke! Trump 2020
He exposed his allegiance in his summation of Mueller's report. Opening salvo of corruption. I hope he's the first one fired when Biden is voted in, then tried for his corruption. He stinks every bit as bad as trump.
What a shameful, disrespectful display. You are a rude, joke! My mom taught me to vote as an independent but Dems like you have taught me to vote Republican! Trump 2020üá∫üá∏
Barr is doing what we all know he has been doing-protecting tRump.  Big surprise.
Just give tRump a sharpie and he will steer the possible hurricane to the places his GOP cronies want it to hit!!!!!
You are not worth listening to. Just so you know, I muted your tirade! Trump 2020  #CancelDemocrats
I mean Wright won by 8 in 2018. Dems more or less turned out at Presidential turnout levels and Republicans generally stayed home. With Trump on the ballot, Republicans will turnout and I think Wright will be fine.
Heil Trump!
Just to lie to make him (Prez Trump) looks good... and he begs for others to thank him for a so-called 'job well done' (Hints: That's what our state governors were forced to say to get those PPEs and COVID-19 testings). Leading not by good example is not an element of #MAGA .
Please thanks Fiana for sharing this heart breaking news &amp; sending my love and condolences to her and her family... MORE LIVES CAN BE SAVED if our self-praised Prez Trump has not abandoned us from the start! Can't see this as #MAGA . I simply can't... RIP 150K.
Texas has the chance to prevent from being an outbreak epicenter by learning from other states/countries that have been successfully contained COVID-19. Instead Texas Gov followed Prez Trump's lead, which we already knew was a mismanagement in health crisis. That is NOT #MAGA .
Many countries have proven that COVID-19 can be manageable. Prez Trump only think for himself. Reopen economy against scientists' guidelines. Hoping that economy will bounce back by Nov 3. He forgot the health of the nation is link to the economy. That's not #MAGA. RIP 150K.
TX Governor is another mini Trump (besides FL and AZ Gov) blindly followed self-praised Prez Trump's lead knowing that he has been mismanaged this public heath crisis right from the start! I don't know how others see this as #MAGA. RIP 150K.
Lol I don‚Äôt think there will be, trump will be arrested after the election.
IT'S TIME TO STOP THIS IGNORANCE...!!!!! I would like "3" people to give me a sensible resolution to the unrest in this country. Forget Trump, Forget Barr, Forget Covid- 19. Someone please tell me how we will come to equality across the board. Not just politics,,,,, Community,
Only show the violence. Don't show the unidentified militia. Trump wants this &amp; the protesters are playing into his hands. It's hard to watch 14 yr old girls being assaulted  by 4 or 5 of these goons. It's all for show.
Same poll has Trump down by 13, so Gardner is showing some crossover appeal. Of course if Trump loses by double digits, I don‚Äôt see Gardner winning but if Trump manages to keep his loss within single digits, Gardner could pull it out.
Hahaha!  Dana Bash on CNN called Bill Barr a "tool"!  She was referring to how tRump uses him, but it was still funny if anyone still looks for things to laugh about!
With all that is going on, I keep thinking of Horton hears a Who. Americans are on the dust spec, Trump is Horton trying to save us from being boiled by radicals. Americans need to shout, "We are here!" It's happening!
I think some people are going to be surprised to see Trump ahead this next election.  It‚Äôs not to hard to tell that the polls are not being honest.
#TrumpleThinSkin #TrumpIsACrybaby    Trump wines about everything and anyone that does not support him and his crazy ideas.  He thinks he is a dictator rather than leading a democracy.  Surround yourself with loyal people rather than smart and experienced people gets you nothing
I think its all of what you have stated, but what's worse in my opinion, like Trump they don't care.
I don't understand the DHS in Portland being framed as Trump playing both sides of a State's Rights debate. The opposite of State's Rights is not Fascism. The opposite of State's Rights is an overarching, singular rule set that governs every citizen despite your zip code.
It would be a hollow gesture. Fuck Trump John Lewis was a real man a brave man something Trump knows nothing about
Trump has to fire this guy. He‚Äôs literally gonna get people killed.
I call for Mrs. Krassenstein and family to be investigated for being fake Americans. Go Breitbart! HCQ works!! Trump 2020üá∫üá∏
Trump admired Reagan? Trump was a Democrat during most of his adult life.
New York Daily news blames covid-19 for the spike in violent crime. The virus isn't the problem. Trump's hate speech, racism, invasion of cities and deliberately dividing the country is. If he hadn't bungled the virus, we would be feeling hopeful by now and not frustrated.
If you support trump and his Gestapo f*ck off! #TrumpGestapo #TrumpFailedAmerica
How long until trump and his cabinet members break out the black uniforms?
Thanks for this info. I know Trump is corrupt and transparent but I missed this one.
Did you see he's now pulling a page from the Trump playbook saying, in essence, "I was joking."
An average of more than 65,000 daily new cases over the past 2 weeks. Covid cases rose from 3.4 mil to 4.3 mil in 2 weeks. Shame on American if Trump is still in business come January 18, 2021. #voteblue #votebiden #ditchmitch
Trump said he was ‚Äúoptimistic‚Äù
If only you cared that he evidently likes to grab women by the pussy.
Trump is starting to remind me of someone.
Trump will just veto it!
How about Trump repeals the Vaccine Injury Act of 1986 right before the Covid vaccine is released? Pharma can put their trillions of dollars where their mouth is.If Trump postpones the election, there will be riots and this old lady will be front and center.
All pardons are admissions of guilt. That is why he commuted Roger Stone. Stone wanted to keep fighting his convictions. I have a feeling that more charges will be brought after Trump leaves office.
No Reagan pardoned a lot of criminals in his administration. Until Trump his was the most criminal administration in history.Over 135 went to jail. When Trump leaves I pray that the Justice Dept. Is relentless in prosecuting his enablers.
Trump has no authority on doing this that is a Federal Crime that he maybe committing if he does that Trump will get in severe trouble, and he could winding up landing himself to a Federal Prison in Leavenworth, Kansas.
It won‚Äôt benefit Americans, just Trump. He owns the Republican Senate except for Romney who is truly a faithful man.
I'm waiting for a proper answer. There just isn't one. There's no sense in this lesser evil shit anymore. The people didn't want Biden just like they didn't want Trump. DNC/GOP are the same.
That makes sense honestly because Trump does everything he can to instill fear of the educated opinion in his fan base. Even his vernacular is extremely basic. He uses ‚Äúbad‚Äù and ‚Äúgood‚Äù to describe everything to make it easy to understand and vague so he doesn‚Äôt have to explain it
wait is ivanka trump the wife, or the daughter?
I wouldn't say he deserved it, but it is his fault.  He campaigned to put Trump into office, pushed Trump's policies, and pushed for faster reopening during the pandemic.  The policies he supported got him infected and killed.
I‚Äôm a school board member. Last week I voted to start school 100% virtual. Part of my reason was that Trump took hospital data away from CDC
I've been wondering if Obama, who told Trump in the Oval that a pandemic was the biggest potential threat and left him with a playbook that went unused, was mad about how things are and I guess I got my answer
I've been active registered democrat since 2014 and these people already have more sway over the dems, than people like me, after a few months of attacking trump's character, a strategy that doesn't actually work against a man with no shame.
Good morning beautiful black people and non trump supporting wypipo!!!
You would criticize Trump for going if he had.
Documented where? Cite a source that isn't Trump.
People have already forgotten about the hurricane that hit Puerto Rico making it lose power for months and then trump coming in and lobing paper towel 3 pointers at them
what say you now hack?
So has trump! ü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
Trump is trying all in his power to stay in office because he knows as soon as he leaves-he is going to prison.
Trump's probably forcing net neutrality shit
Cowards working for a coward.  Is the imbecile Donald Trump worth dying for? This really isn‚Äôt that difficult.
every single trump supporter I know that tells immigrants they should "just learn english!!!" took two years of spanish in high school and still cannot form a single coherant sentence
show of hands who's surprised trump wants to delay getting voted out of office??   oh, and uhm, almost all of his family votes by mail?
He sure did #Kayleigh - and now he‚Äôs dead.  Don‚Äôt suppose you‚Äôll acknowledge that it was #TulsaTrumpRally that killed him? #Trump will never mention this man again.  THATS who you work for.  150k and counting, you can bet their families aren‚Äôt supporters.
People really roasting Herman Cain because he was shucking and jiving at the Trump rally about not wearing mask and Coronavirus being a hoax. But this man died y‚Äôall ion think that‚Äôs 100% right to do, he still is a black man that died, but I get it.
Fellow Americans planning to #VoteByMail PLEASE drop off your ballot! Somehow I missed this news in May... üò¨ #corrupttrump #postmastergeneral #Election2020
That will backfire Trump The Election will go on as planned even hoping for The Federal Election Commission, and The U.S. Marshals are looking at this very closely at Trump.
Herman Cain went to a Trump rally before getting sick? Welp...
That is a Federal Crime right there Trump just committed The election will go on November 3 as planned hoping for  even  is looking into this even will backfire and embarrassed at Trump on that.
In the words of  : ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs hilarious, because it shows they have nowhere left to go. It also shows that we are having an impact. There must be a reason why they try to silence us,&amp; that must be because we are being loud,&amp; we are having an impact.‚Äù #Trump #Election2020
Trump: Herbert Cain? Never met him.
Anyone who follows Trump ends up disavowed, fired, disgraced, paid-off, owned, imprisoned...or dead!
My  feed is a lot rn. I‚Äôm logging off for the day... ‚úåüèø   #education #future #COVID19 #Trump #HermanCain #MLB #Asterisks #Marlins #crime #news #STLCards #STL #Missouri #illinois #rain
Herman Cain's last public appearance was Trump's Tulsa rally which he attended maskless. Some deaths are tragic and others are stupid &amp; preventable
Will  even ACKNOWLEDGE that a member of his admin has died from #COVID__19? Kinda feels like this man would likely still be alive had he put his eggs in a different basket. The 150k dead..these deaths rest on orange shoulders. #RIP #RemoveTrumpNow
He already knows he‚Äôs going to lose so he‚Äôs just trying to fuck things up even more. It‚Äôs like the kid in class that loves getting everyone else in trouble. Dear Trump, nobody likes a sore loser. Or you.
also trump doesn‚Äôt give a guck if you are ‚Äúsafe‚Äù while you‚Äôre voting. May i remind you he gave the go ahead for children to go back to school knowing over 14,000 KIDS would die. This man only cares about power, money, and himself.
TRUMP DOES NOT HAVE THE RIGHT TO DELAY THE ELECTION LMAO WHAT UNIVERSE ARE WE LIVING IN ???
Ohhhhhhhh....so that's why he's tweeting nonsense (again)
FUCK YOU DONALD TRUMP.This is horse shit
Trump virus now.  #NobodyLikesTrump
I don't know anything about the UK, but that's not the case in the US. There's no evidence of mail in fraud here.   Every state has absentee ballots, and military personal and other Americans who are living abroad vote via mail.   It was never an issue until Trump complained.
Earlier you told us that Trump-Russia Collusion was true.
75% of people think trump has a micro peen
Trump can't even keep his stories straight. According to him, the virus is just going to disappear one day. It's not even a big enough deal for him to wear a mask.  But now he is concerned about safely voting because of the pandemic?   Which is it? It's concerning or its a hoax?
No we will vote for Trump, period!
Why has anybody on your station  bought up any news stories about the black man killed in Milwaukee for supporting Trump you and BLM don't  care, but if it was a cop killing an black person you would be all over it
I'd vote for a used condom before I vote for trump.
I think this may turn some suburban voters off. I hope it backfires on Trump! üôèüòå
Wow, ole espn is REALLY scraping the bottom of the barrel on this one... Buy im sure he‚Äôll find a way to blame it on Trump, oppressive white people, or racism
EVERY TRUMP SUPPORTER EVER!
There‚Äôs a reason trump support hrc her entire political career up until about 2012.
I'm donald jackass trump, and I'm relying on white fear to keep me in office!! #TrumpIsNotWell  #Whitefearistrumpsonlyhope
My point is, i don‚Äôt think Beto helps Biden win Texas. If anything, he hurts his chances... I appreciate your Bernie reference though. Reminds me of why we have trump now, because the most corrupt modern day politician lost.
The answer to repealing the AFFH by Trump is going after FANNIE and FREDDIE.  The housing market is a ponzi scheme right now and #Boomers are hoping to sucker in younger people to cash out.
judging by your profile, the media you consume is incredibly biased as well as mostly inaccurate. you are clearly ignorant to the actions Trump has taken to oppress POC yet you continue to worship an administration that doesn‚Äôt care about you one bit
Why are alleged liberals mad at less US to further American imperialism..... Trump is finished and now the battle is between The Bernie wing who wants change and the corporate Democrats who are just the republicans from 20 yrs ago
I'm glad Trump recognizing we don't like him. We sure don't honey!
If he does actually debate Trump, which I doubt, it will be claimed that he needs a proxy to answer all debate questions for him.
Studied Finance &amp; Economics, followed central banking closely.  Asked many of them for data supporting the claim and they link to a random article with a single sentence saying Trump controls FED. Then they tell me to do more research and wake up. ü§Ø
What about our troops?
I fly the flag in front of the house and had it out with my Make Aemrica Great Again- IMPEACH TRUMP yard sign for years! Took the sign down when he was impeached, but left the flag. Love my country enough to FIGHT BACK against racism! MAGAats dont own patriotism, only cultism.
Not sure on the trump part, I may have blocked that from my brain. I tend to do that for all things trump
It‚Äôs the trump 2020 shirt for me
Kanye West Really Tryna Run For President. Anybody Who Votes For Him Need They Ass Whooped. Now Is Not The Time To Be Trying To Split The Votes. That Only Leaves More People Voting For Trump. Its All A Scheme.
It could also be something as simple as Trump being unable to admit he was wrong
Why are Trump supporters defending the federal ‚Äúagents‚Äù swooping into American cities to protect cement? Are you anti big government or not? Make up your minds about what you believe. You seem to flip flop when it doesn‚Äôt fit your narrative. Total hypocrisy.
It‚Äôs not about supporting Trump...the media BEEN lying about hydrocloroquine.  We did not have to lockdown...people did not have to die...
I'm getting Trump ads. We're being targeted.
yes go Mr. Trump
This article explains what went wrong with ‚Å¶ #Trump2020? No way. #NoEmpathy #DonaldTrump
Everyone : What‚Äôs this new FBI Building doing in a coronavirus relief bill? Trump:
if you just google ‚Äúdonald trump racist‚Äù the internet will provide you with several definitive lists but since you‚Äôre too dim-witted to do that yourself, here‚Äôs just one
Impeachment hearings would change the narrative.  Right now Trump is digging a hole. I guess we can see how deep.
B#All Biden has to do is sit back and let tRump bury himself with his idiotic tweets‚Äî-he‚Äôs doing a damn good job of it.
I just spent some time on her YouTube page and Dr. Stella Immanuel is colonialism and religious fanaticism personified. The fact that Trump is propping her up is ludicrous and insulting.
You could just say you disagree and not be such a dick about it. I'll never understand why Trump supporters are so goddamn angry all the time. Smoke some pot and chill.
hate to sound like a democrat but any vote but for....b..biden is a vote for trump ü§¢
Was that Trump, or Yogi Berra?
Good. Cuz we‚Äôll keep going if his sundowning ass gets elected. He‚Äôs no better other than that he pretends to give a fuck. Trump can‚Äôt even quite to that.
I think we‚Äôre witnessing them in life support, if they really thought Trump is as vulnerable as they claim they‚Äôd run a stronger candidate for POTUS. And they wouldn‚Äôt be acting like this.
I think right now we‚Äôre witnessing the Democrat party on life support. If Trump were as vulnerable as they claim they wouldn‚Äôt be acting like this.
I support mail-in voting in the long term. But for this fall I am afraid the push will create too much of an opportunity for Trump to pull shenanigans and steal the election. I think the Ds should push in-person early voting and Election Day turnout.
My confusion is they don't like medication (including vaccines) so how could Trump change their mind to believe Remdesivir or Hydroxychloroquine are ok.... I'm lost on the rationale.
I‚Äôll never cease to be shocked by how proud Trump supporters are of their abject ignorance. It‚Äôs really astounding.
Send information about leaders doing what Trump did with COVID. This is about COVID.
He‚Äôs to invested in trump winning
Why is the antivax crowd so into whatever drugs Trump touts?...
Dr Fraudci been lying...real doctors are going to tear the lil shrimp to pieces about using hydrocloroquine ...many died off their lies...not Trump
Would do a world of good if the media would stop lumping protestors &amp; rioters together by using the term "mostly peaceful". Just state that there are people that protest and there are people out to cause havoc. The "mostly peaceful" strategy doesn't hurt Trump, it hurts America.
This is just a friendly reminder that the Trump family can‚Äôt run a charity in New York because they got caught stealing money from kids with cancer. #TrumpTaxes #Trump2020LandslideVictory #charitytuesday #NewYork #TrumpIsACrybaby #TrumpHatesWomen #TrumpMeltdown
I don‚Äôt. She got a Trump crop top on üòÇ
But wasn't Trump the one who appointed some of those people too...
My reaction when I‚Äôm not a Trump fan but he‚Äôs giving out stimulus checks
Trump‚Äôs whole 2016 campaign was about how shitty our country was and they loooved that. He should have just gone to Russia
You need a plan for 2024 and joe biden isnt cutting it cause they will run someone worse than trump
The United Nations Orders Trump To Stand Down?
Another Dick move by Trump. Not going to honor a congressman. 99 days until voting to remove him.
Not surprised one bit   Trump says he won‚Äôt go and pay respects to John Lewis at Capitol
I know that Trumpers like to ignore that there is a pandemic...but you guys. There is a pandemic that has killed 150k Americans. Hence the reason Biden isn't having a rally. The last time Trump had a rally how many people were infected? Secret service, Hermain Cane, Jrs gf.......
I'll never understand the cult worship of Trump. But then again, I've always been a leader not a follower. I also know how to think for myself. So I guess weak people succumb to this kind of bullshit.
Trump retweeted th video so yes it has everything to do with him
Trump is so far beneath Congressman Lewis that he won‚Äôt even be missed.
I don‚Äôt see any republican support in the senate for Trump. They all pull up theirs skirts and hide when BLM is involved.
That nigga trump lied and said this check was gone be generous, it‚Äôs the same shit ü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
people still using nuance to persuade the vote. we are past nuance, folks. you just vote. trump. OUT.
Read the comments and his post is proven instantly. Trump landslide incoming, but we need to vote despite how comfy we feel.
Hoping one day this total loser realizes how fucking dumb he looks with a Trump face-mask on his chin ü§û
Trump‚Äôs people are all so unbelievably ignorant. It‚Äôs truly exhausting how stupid they are.
A Racist like you would say what you did about slavery. You and Trump, two ignorant want to be slave holders.
Yes it does protect you. The data says it does.
Rahm Emmanuel just hit the nail on the head about Trump amd his response to the virus and protests. #TheView
President Trump Semper Fi
You all are a bunch of lying cheats. We KNOW you want the votes such that you can manufacture the number you need. GFY TRUMP 2020
There is a raging pandemic with nearly 150,000 Americans dead and Trump was golfing over the weekend. Whoever runs this account is REALLY bad at it. Obama isn't the president anymore. I wish I could understand what point you're trying to prove here.
Go trump
The fuck is this? Is that Dr. King in the back? You know what it makes sense. He came to tell Trump he ain't shit and everyone else is yeah we agree as King walks away
He won re-election in a landslide, so I‚Äôm not sure the media or the swamp was much against him as what we have seen with Trump. Reagan was great, don‚Äôt get me wrong. I just feel Trump has done much more with less. Take care.
After the election I had a dream reliving Dante's Inferno. When Dante approached Satan half frozen in the lake, munching Judas and squeezing Brutus and Caligula for all time, I saw Trump frozen up to his neck in front of Satan, cheeks bulging. I don't normally dream.
I wonder how many times aides have had to explain to Trump that he can‚Äôt just fire Pence on a whim , and appoint Haley as Acting Vice President. Pence‚Äô term goes until January 20, 2021 regardless of trump‚Äôs constitutional illiteracy
is Trump lactating
Trump is the cancer. Biden is the chemo.  Not a perfect treatment but way better than letting this fascist thuggery continue.
You can‚Äôt argue Trump had a better economy, stronger on the border and better with the military. He could have done more but he had to fight his own party as well deal with impeachment. He not as good in communicating but has better results.
lol  that fat-assed Trump galloping by. üòÖüòÜüôÇ
Trump kinda looks like he‚Äôs melting and it‚Äôs weird
Thanks for follow Trump 2020!
CLEARANCE SALE üòÇüòÇüòÇ
Nothing like #resist cry baby lying about Trump
That would involve total shutdown of the economy
That‚Äôs not how it works. State constitutions fill in the ambiguity of the US constitution. Do you really not understand this?
The US constitution doesn‚Äôt say anything about masks. Does the Constitution say anything about wearing clothes?
Your argument is wandering. Keep to the initial point. Masks protect others. Mounting data supports that. Your local officials are telling you to wear it to protect your fellow Americans.
I‚Äôd check your state constitution. Many have granted the state director of health executive authority to enact measures during times of quarantine or outbreak. So, while I may not be able to, your state constitution says they can
Oh come on. What Jake is saying is valid. Every reporter needs to be asking this question, ESPECIALLY the ones that get to sit down with Trump.
You don‚Äôt think for yourself. You let a box think for you lol. Read the compiled data from retrospective analyses and see that there‚Äôs a statistically significant correlation between community masking and transmission
I‚Äôm not a Republican but this quote is fake
Yes! Must get tRump out!!!
Again it‚Äôs to protect others. It‚Äôs job is to minimize respiratory droplets. It doesn‚Äôt stop aerosols but it does minimize droplets which is theorized as a main vector for infection.... by limiting respiratory droplets, we limit the airborne vector... lol taking about the box
The government isn‚Äôt saying this, the medical community is. I‚Äôm so sick of hearing people act like they‚Äôre more knowledgeable than the top physicians
Nazis arent anarchists
That‚Äôs a fake quote
But you wear a mask to protect others.
You can be a republican and a conservative and NOT support Trump. This country needs more people to put country over party.
If you support Trump you actually do support this. This is who he is. He is racist and xenophobic and homophobic and a misogynist and that's clearly a-okay with you.
So, by this logic...Batman was Black Supremecist.  The family who hired Mr. Belvedere were Black Supremecists as well. Trump, too! -OR - They're just cowards who don't wanna come out and say they think all butlers should be black.   #BlackIsKing #blm #racism #Amerikkka #Beyonce
Yeah the guy is wearing a Trump shirt. Somebody got a screenshot of it.
His name was Bernell Trammell, he was black &amp; supported Trump.  Will there be any marches in his memory? Will any bricks be thrown or fires set because of his murder? Of course not because the left doesn‚Äôt care about all black lives, just the ones they can exploit.
Because Trump is a narcissist and cares for no one but himself. WTF is Favre doing?
Tuff shit, what's she protesting about , the best country in the world and best President ever, Trump 2020
Trump is a a Populist.  He's for Individual Freedom. The Establishment are  and  ,  ate Totalitarian Elitists. They despise anyone who didn't graduate from Ivy League private universities.
If the average (non-millionaire) Trump supporter went up to #DumbDonald and said ‚ÄúI need $10 to save my house. Can you spare it?‚Äù, that person is losing their house. Yet most of them are too stupid to realize that he is NOT ‚Äúone of them‚Äù
I wish all of my followers would cut and paste this and tweet it out right now:  JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
Every fandom has annoying followers. Unfortunately for sports, those annoying followers tend to be bigoted trash. I found a meme Twitter for my hockey team and there was a pro trump post and I was like NOPE
I think " you must support trump".
You're running as a cheap carbon copy of Donald Trump. You don't even belong in the democratic party.
Still voting for him because Trump tear gassed people for a photoshoot AKA attacking the first amendment.
Trump is still holding campaign events.
Nancy Pelosi is a republican in blue skin and she agrees with 95% of Trump‚Äôs changes. Banning entry from China did not prevent anything.
We pay for Trump to go golfing every fucking weekend ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
Trump did not take anything seriously before and 2 months into the pandemic. He didn‚Äôt even believe it was a pandemic. When he got into office he got rid of most of our government response teams that directly deal with pandemics. NY is doing a shit job too, ya.
If Trump was doing a good job with Corona I would give him credit. I don‚Äôt want either Biden or Trump to be president they‚Äôre both garbage.
Biden has nothing and he‚Äôs still destroying in the polls. Therefore, it‚Äôs Trump‚Äôs lack of leadership that‚Äôs denying him the easy victory
Maybe tRump can find him a job in the White House like he did for his family.
Trump has dementia. He can try to say he'll focus on the issues but he won't. He literally can't help himself.
Another tRump on the payroll‚Äî-no thank you.
Trump cannot navigate a ramp, drink water with one hand, nor speak in coherent or complete sentences. And BTW, sir Mick detests the üçäü§° too!
Purity like this doesn‚Äôt exist in Trump‚Äôs America üòÇüòÇüòÇ
Even someone with 76 followers knows Trump is not self made.
Love the name for the virus....The Trump Virus ‚ù§üëç100%
1/ The Trump campaign displays a stunning level of ignorance when it uses the intellectual property of others without permission. We have seen this repeatedly in their use of Michelle Obama‚Äôs speech, a great variety of songs, and now the name and likeness of another president.
It'll never happen under Trump and I doubt it'll ever happen anyway but we need to ban Nazi imagery from being displayed in public. Flags. Masks. Hats. Everything.   As Trump supporters like to say to us snowflake libtards - "You lost, get over it!"  The Nazi's lost. Get over it.
He did over 40 rallies 4 hillary üôÑThere are a ton of people that could be doing a lot more to make sure Biden is elected, including fucking Biden himself. Ppl wanna hate bernie yet expect him to do all the work?? ü•± he has endorsed and stated over &amp; over we gotta get trump out
Trump working hard on a plan for the pandemic I see.
YOU make me EMBARRASSED 2 be FAN right now. Y would u invite such a DECEITFUL, DIVISIVE, RACIST person be a Guest of Honor?????  Bronx Official Suggests BLM Mural Painted Outside Yankee Stadium, After Team Invites Trump to Throw First Pitch
Oh, I know it won't work üòÇüòÇüòÇ It's Trump, he's insane. I just like him to know how I feel about him.
Understand that supporting the Lincoln Project is performing electoral calculus. You don't get both the left and the Bush GOP. So if the Dems choose to embrace the Never Trump GOP they are saying they'd rather have those votes than the left's.
Fuck Trump!  Stormy:
Bruce  levell is a coward !!  He is a disgrace to the black race especially black men, upholding Trump in his racism.  Black men were brutalized by men‚Äôs like Trump.
If Trump wins you are getting vodka for Christmas, comrades.
This sounds like a Trump cognitive test
This clip gives me chills and tears...while Trump and his cult have worked to divide, we have factions coming together &amp; standing up.  This is America.  Moms, dads, veterans.  All colors, all sexes, all socio-economic backgrounds, all religions.
Trump finally got a wall but it wasn't the wall he was looking for.
WE GET IT CHRIS CILLIZZA!!!  YOU HATE TRUMP!!  I HATE HIM TOO, BUT NO ONE MAKES MORE IDIOTIC CONCLUSIONS ABOUT HIM THAN YOU!  example:Analysis: These 5 words may cost Trump a second term - SURE, CHRIS!  And 'grab them by their pussy' in 2016 was totally fine.  But "I alone" not!Just posted this excerpt. Only reference I found was Mar-a-Lago.  This isn't exactly damning to Trump.

I know that has been her goal, but I‚Äôm hoping that GOP dream will go down the drain with Trump.  With any luck we will have 8 years to undo the damage.
Good evening. Donald Trump is a fascist.
This is more evidence Trump has lost his own party. Yes, his base will always be there ‚Äî but the ‚Äòsilent majority‚Äô he had in 2016 is no longer a thing. He‚Äôs a fascist.
I was pointing out Americans can‚Äôt travel to 116 countries thanks to Trump
Yeah of course parents wish schools could open but Want their kids safe!  Big difference.  Trump has no plan, strategy to help anyone with anything Covid related, unemployment related, rights related, immigration related...got it.  Biden is our leader
When Obama handed off the economy to Trump, real GDP (controlling for inflation) was about $18 trillion. And Trump called it "American Carnage."  Three and a half years later the economy is 4.4% smaller than it was under Obama.
So, they‚Äôve drawn their line. Not particularly difficult considering it is the choice of Congress to determine (and Dems have the House). But, do they really think they can control Trump‚Äôs fear between now and the election? This is just the beginning.
Trump spent nearly 1 billion already.... where... oh he gave it to friends and family...
Trump cannot stop us!
We'll find out in the debates who's sharper.  If Trump is your idea of someone who sounds smart, I worry for your mental capacity.
My best understanding/thinking is 1) massive groupthink, 2) Trump must be defeated, and any sword to hand, and 3) a fearful population is suggestible.
So after 80 years of destroying the country all of a sudden they are going to do something better than Trump? Makes sense.
Since Trump‚Äôs racist use of the term ‚ÄúChina Virus‚Äù is clearly an attempt to misdirect the blame and public perception from his failed attempt to get the spread under control in the US, can we please from now on refer to it as the ‚ÄúTrump Virus‚Äù?

Say what you want about President Trumps communication skills, you have to LOVE a politician that can talk to America without using the standard playbook like Obama. Also, Trump says it like it is and follows through on his promises. Obama fanned racism today, Trump is MAGA.
...this is the argument about paying a ridiculously low amount on taxes all over again.  He didn‚Äôt create the system, he navigates if well.  Clinton, Clinton, Bush, Bush, Obama, Obama built the China market.  Trump org maximized it.  28B of China‚Äôs tariffs went to farmers. 1/2

Like a troll under a bridge. Sums up Trump perfectly.
Trump Administration is a regime.
I hate to say this, but there might be some sympathy since he was conservative, but I don't think a lot of Trump's supporters will fully internalize their own danger because their racism will cause a disconnect between them and him being the same. It's just so sad.

Trump is desperate and facing indictment when he leaves office. He will do anything to stay in office. Stay woke. We haven‚Äôt seen his worst yet.
Remember how Democrats took back the House in 2018? Imagine if that didn't happen and Trump was pushing for delaying an election. Bullet fucking dodged.
Obama, Bush and Clinton said goodbye to a civil rights leader who preached change, progress and hope. Donald Trump stayed home, spending the morning watching TV and tweeting, holding fast to his program of conflict, nostalgia and restoration. #resist
Thanks for reminding us that for 8 years acted like Obama was the antichrist and a dictatorial sociopath, then answered those 8 years with Trump.
trump is not the one you want to be touched by.

I hope she's fishing.  It was obvious the constant trump saga of corruption was getting to her, as it is with most of us.  We can vent, but she has to remain professional, which she always is.  I think she just needed to detach, but I'm worried about her.
Remember Trump‚Äôs first address at the CIA in front of a wall of stars that commemorated fallen soldiers and he boasted about his ratings and crowd size?
So trump decries mail in voting, driving everyone to request mail in ballots, but secretly destroying the post office so those ballots won‚Äôt get counted in time? Yeah, he would. They‚Äôre working to cover all their bases.

Trump can't delay the election, but his cronies are trying really hard to delay ballots. Which means if you're voting by mail, mail that sucker ASAP.

That's why Trump is building a wall on the Mexican border. That's where the most human trafficking comes from.
This is the entire motivation of the Lincoln Project. They want to distance themselves from Trump (whom they rode to get everything they could) in order to create the myth of a "good Republican" (like the postwar "good Nazis" in Germany) in order to rebuild the GOP.
How much you wanna bet that trump saw your ad on Brad Pascale and demoted him because of that ad?
Trump isnt on shit
No. They're trying to compensate for the 1970s Ferdinand Marcos level manipulation of our established system to favor a confessed felon. It's an irregular situation because Trump et al have been heavy handed in trying to spike justice. No-one needs your guidance in how to pray.
Soon, Trump is going to be at a rally, he'll point into the crowd and say "Look at my African American over here!" But then realize all 3 of them died from not wearing a mask.

Pretty obvious the reason Trump‚Äôs brainfart tweet floating the idea of delaying elections is the red line the  actually cares about him crossing isn‚Äôt because they‚Äôve found their spines; it‚Äôs that the secretly hate him and want him out of the White House too. He‚Äôs cancer.

If Trump delays election results past January 30, the 46th president will be Nancy Pelosi.

Calling it the ‚ÄúChina Virus‚Äù doesn‚Äôt change that Herman Cain contracted COVID19 at Trump‚Äôs Tulsa rally. That he was told not to have. Where he removed the signs designed to socially distance attendees. Where people didn‚Äôt wear masks because Trump claimed masks made him look bad.
I'll admit I joked about this, that even they weren't this ghoulish, but turns out "letting people die" is actually a Trump re-election strategy.

There are a lot of Republicans ready to stand by truth over party lines probably due to the fact that Trump is not Republican. He believes in Trump and no one else.

At the start of the year I would've said Trump, but after the whole pandemic debacle I can see Biden winning.
Don‚Äôt be fooled, people-the warning is in his letter. This man doesn‚Äôt want Nancy Pelosi to become president by default. That is it.   As long as the election occurs, he will be voting for Trump again (or whoever is on the ballot if not him).
I believe we all do this. It‚Äôs becoming daily. I used to clap at 8 for heath care workers. Now I scream that every night into my Trump supporting neighborhood! #sendhelp

Many local broadcasters don't agree with trump but fear losing their lucrative jobs and being banned by RW owners.Its horrible watching previously good people prostitute themselves and trash decades of built trust.
So your saying trump WANTS to bring jobs nack from china. He should start by making his own clothing lines here dont you think? He wont because its cheaper to produce there. Lead by example. trump is no leader. Hes weak.
Just an amazing story by Cory Booker in response to Trump warning white suburbanites about ‚Äúlow income people.‚Äú
What jobs did trump bring back from china?
Imagine thinking that replacing Donald Trump with Joe Biden is some variety of liberation? It‚Äôs changing out buffoonery for the more traditional method of calculated oppression. Catch 22.
Or this is the theatrical number they‚Äôre putting on to bog down a Biden admin a la ‚Äò09? If the race was tighter or Trump was winning, the money spigot would be open. They did tax cuts and judges. Governing is hard. Time to go back to obstructing from the minority.
I've been watching a lot of true crime. Murder is less disturbing than what Trump and the GOP are doing to America.
I‚Äôm confused, isn‚Äôt this pretty much what Trump does at every press conference
Trump sucker says what?
There are days I fight the feeling of hating tRump too. But when we give into hate we let him steal our joy. Hate is corrosive and destroys the hater not the hated. We must have the energy to fight his evil and destroy him with our love for each other. Hating him takes our power.

Has anyone bothered to ask Trump  to publicly explain the difference between absentee and mail-in voting? Or are we just not up to the nonsense word-salad?
It came in from Europe by the time Trump sort of closed down incoming flights from China. You should try doing your own research instead of getting your info Trumps twitter feed full of lies and misinformation.
Wow. Last time I checked,  the Blue States were being hit worse with the Virus. To say something like "they're getting what was coming to them" is just despicable.  That's the Democratic way now. Hoping Americans that voted for Trump get sick or die.
Trump continues to lie and 152,000 Americans are dead because Trump made masks a political statement. He could have been a hero. Don't get it twisted. Also he said China was doing a great job on the virus until he needed someone to blame for his trying to magically wish it away.
Another interesting aspect of this is finding out how terminally online Trump is. He‚Äôs governing by retweet.
tRump killed Herman Cain.  Not China. tRump.
Take the fbi building and the defense funding off the table and then they‚Äôll talk. Put that $ in the economy, not into Trump‚Äôs hotel in dc.

As far as I'm concerned he is still the President, all be it without powers, since trump illegally stole the election.  Can't Republicans win a Presidential election without cheating?  Ref: Bush '02 trump '16.
Here‚Äôs the scary thing. If Trump loses on November 3 but cries foul, contests the election, and takes it to the supreme court, what will the court do?  History is not on our side.

Are you focused NOW? Did Trump refocus you NOW?
tRUmp is elderly.
Yes! Why isn‚Äôt Trump saying that?
I don't think so, but he is hurting his nemesis Bezos by slowing down the mail. He's the reason trump refused to bailout the USPS. The test delays are due to so many companies starting up quickly and using fax machines instead of more expensive and quicker permanent technology.
Trump should do everything in his power as  to protect the elections by mail and in person. That is his job. What does he think his job is???
Democrats had bills for help piled up #MoscowMitch! You and trump want to add your own pocket lining and that‚Äôs what‚Äôs holding it up. Even R‚Äôs are saying so. 2B new FBI bldng across from trumps hotel. It‚Äôs a shake down for Americans health aid! These hypocrites are lying to üá∫üá∏‚Äôs!

oh my..
trump just claimed that GOP not Democrats are fighting for extended unemployment benefits.  He is also proposing to take $$ away from public schools and give to parents to send their kids to alternatives.  Surprised?
Obama had this same energy in 2016. He went throughout the U.S. telling y'all Democracy was on the ballot. Trump wasn't the one. Hillary told y'all step by step what he would do. Y'all couldn't get over the whatever isms y'all had abt them two.
is lying his ü§•off! He‚Äôs acting like it‚Äôs Democrats making aid bills hard to pass? They have them ready but we keep having to add trump incentives at almost $3B. That money could help so many ppl, but a 2B new FBI bldng across from trumps DC hotel or no aid? SICK
Wtf is grandpa snorting today?  #Trump

Sounds like he knows he was wrong before, knows Trump is going to lose, and is looking for any credible way to distance himself before the election.
Please keep your crazy off topic opinions to yourself. We are discussing the billions of dollars spent on defending  a sovereign nation that can take care of itself. Not you fear and hatred of Trump.
Huh. Didn‚Äôt know Trump could sell ads.
We really don‚Äôt need our time wasted by  giving meaningless unqualified lies! He failed us and Florida hit a record just a day or two though! America is looking like a 3rd world country. Our stores look like Russia‚Äôs. Maybe that‚Äôs what trump wants doing 0!

How is a foreign country going to steal my ballot, with my name printed on it, and change my vote on the ballot? More Trump cult conspiracy theories. Voting machines can be hacked or malfunction. Mail in ballots leave a paper trail which can be verified.
OMG!  This is the person that was elected to lead our country?  Shame on tRump voters that don't realize their mistake!  His corona virus briefing is disgusting.  He can never admit he is wrong much less offer hope.  Mary Trump's book is right on target and it is scary!
Anyone else think Trump‚Äôs skin looks wrong?
Trump is going on and on about how terrible other countries are doing with the virus.
I may be wrong.
I think that "silent majority" isn't going to let trump continue this nightmare

Perhaps this thread will help you understand why Trump suggested postponing the election:
I'm waiting for a proper answer. There just isn't one. There's no sense in this lesser evil shit anymore. The people didn't want Biden just like they didn't want Trump. DNC/GOP are the same.
Yes! Long story but a guy me and my wife know lives on a street with one trump flag outside one house, all the other houses on the street have blm yard signs and 3 have Biden signs and the house directly across the street has a coexist flag, its awesome!
Biden is going to try to set up virtual debates with Trump. I give him a high probability of getting it done. Democrats are always leading and Republicans are sleays responding.
Donald Trump said we‚Äôd lose 60,000 people by August to #COVID19. Today is July 30, and we‚Äôve lose 150000 live.

I hear they have to call him lord Trump in private
It was 2 weeks after the hate rally, I mean trump rally.
Trump‚Äôs psychological profile is what makes his resignation extremely unlikely. A normal president would have already done so. It was great to see Fox do the right thing twice, but that won‚Äôt last until the GOP admits to themselves they‚Äôre going under in Nov.
Trump will never resign, unfortunately. He‚Äôs too much of a narcissist. The blow to his ego would be devastating. He can‚Äôt be shamed into it like Nixon, either. All of this is in preparation to refuse to concede as well.
Does anyone have a sinking feeling that Trump is probably wondering if a nuclear war could delay the election
Steven is gonna be asked if he‚Äôs still voting for Trump, who he basically calls a fascist, and he‚Äôs gonna say ‚Äúyes‚Äù
This is like the opening speaker at a Trump rally who claimed he had shed blood on seven continents
First off, that's a drop in the bucket to keeping thousands of troops in a foreign country. Second, no one has to out their lives of their loved ones on the line to defend Trump's golf course from Russia.  I would rather pay for 20 Trump vacations than protect Germany for nothing
Trump is a dummy. This is not a dummy decision. This is looking over the horizon and cutting China out of our markets and not letting them chose to do that and have leverage over the US during any future conflict or negotiation or issue/event ect. India is an ally of sorts.
This is one of the dumbest things ever produced by a newspaper. You will be dumber after reading the selective context that is made to make Trump look bad. Trump is a F'ing idiot. He doesn't think strategic and this is a strategic move. USA can and will supply itself
Didn't Trump say it was illegal for Twitter to show trending topics that are unfavorable for him?  It's a shame if he sees what's trending today. #ObamaWasBetterAtEverything
Well, tRUMP was correct about the 2016 election saying it was rigged. It was rigged in HIS favor. This warning us that mail-in will be rigged in his favor too?
Oh, a liar just like trump!
So I'm *still* waiting. " does not trump an aggregate of peer reviewed abstracts from fucking NASA.
Well, tRUMP was correct about the 2016 election saying it was rigged. It was rigged in HIS favor. This warning us that mail-in will be rigged in his favor too?
a little property damage will do. a big fat NO to trump tower. and he said a little blood will do thats on his children..
Is it just me, or does Trump wanting to delay the election sound suspiciously like a con man needing just a little more time to get all the money together before he can pay you back?
I have watched my father-in-law grab wasps with his bare hand and smash them. I have watched him hammer nails with his fist. But, he‚Äôd give you the shirt off his back.  He‚Äôs a gun-totin‚Äô, Trump-supporting, tender-hearted badass. #MAGA all over again.
Just because I refer to 'coffee' as 'covfefe' doesn't mean I like Trump
Clinton's was a EULOGY. Obama's was a Trump Roast!

Awwww....couldn‚Äôt make it through your comment without a little nod to Trump and his conspiracy theories
Some of us have been warning people for 4 years about what #Trump and the Republicans are up to. Are others ready to listen?
In his wonderful, presidential eulogy of John Lewis, President Barrack Obama didn‚Äôt once mention Trumps name Just bracing for Fox News and Republican pundits to attack Obama for all the terrible things he said about Trump
Would this work at your job or company?  Trump: I've done such a horrible job that you need to fire me, I understand. BUT, I've put the company in such a "hole". You should probably wait until you can afford to replace me!
please stick to what you know which is acting and singing. Politics is not your strong suit. I am sorry but it is the truth. Trump did nothing wrong. He tells the honest truth which is what we need.
there is no need to talk to you....apparently pictures aren't effective either....hope the future works out for you....getting your head out of Trump's ass might help also...Bye Felicia!

True! I appreciate your courage and dedication üíïüíïObama's jab at Trump gets standing ovation #WeWillVote #WeWillVote #NovemberIsComing
Was explaining that 2 my teenager today via text. Even Nixon wasn‚Äôt this corrupt &amp; twisted. Nixon, Reagan, &amp; 43 did much damage &amp; I disagreed w nearly every decision, but they weren‚Äôt career criminals, rapists, or traitors. Trump is in a horrible class by himself. He isüíØPutin‚Äôs.
Trump practices medicine without a license all the time by recommending hydrochloroquine! He has no authority to do so.
That makes sense honestly because Trump does everything he can to instill fear of the educated opinion in his fan base. Even his vernacular is extremely basic. He uses ‚Äúbad‚Äù and ‚Äúgood‚Äù to describe everything to make it easy to understand and vague so he doesn‚Äôt have to explain it
I thought Clinton's was pretty damn good! Better actually...because it was about THE PERSON. Not Trump &amp; his politics! Seemed MORE "Campaign Speach" and a lot LESS "eulogy". Kinda disrespectful if you ask me.
You work for us. You should listen to the people and take their advice. I rarely hear a decent follow up question at a Trump briefing.
What could be more hateful than a complete disregard for human life? Trump &amp; his supporters are the reason COVID is so bad in the US. Do you even have a clue about how the rest of the world handled it and got back to normal? They don't have a narcissistic moron as a leader.
President Trump.
I *wish* we could put politics aside for this pandemic.  Trump has all the smartest people on the planet around him with infinite resources. Imagine if he just knocked this pandemic out of the park. He would CRUISE to reelection. But he just chose to deny deny deny since day 1.
"... Republicans ‚Äî in the Oval Office, in the Senate, in the House ‚Äî must lose, and lose decisively. Trump has made national Republicans fully complicit in his revolt against American principles. Party loyalty now consists of defending the indefensible."
You're missing my point. A 10 year old wouldn't suggest that.   You're so quick to tear Fauci down for getting a few things wrong about a novel virus that we've never seen before, yet you bend over backwards to excuse Trump pondering the injection of surface disinfectant.
As pharma continues to think about its response to the Trump administration‚Äôs newly introduced executive orders, rather than continuing to point fingers, players should think about how they can deliver what everyone wants: value.

I still don‚Äôt understand the cries of Trump being an ass. Yeah, we know. We‚Äôve always known. Neither surprised nor care.
I don‚Äôt really care if our leaders are Christian or religious at all. BUT, listening to Clinton and Obama speak at John Lewis‚Äô eulogy, I cannot imagine Trump, the Chosen One of evangelicals, quoting scripture the way they do.
4 LA men admit to Skid Row voter-fraud scheme, DA announces  #FoxNews I believe the Democrats did this, 1000%. They would sell out their grand kids if they could to get rid of Trump.
I‚Äôm sure he‚Äôll change his mind. He likes standing up next to the Turtle and Trump for the cameras.
Congress and Trump had options to ensure everyone continued to receive a paycheck. They opted for temporary and limited stimulus. Blame belongs at the feet of our worthless politicians. They protected the billionaires and the corporations but crumbs for the 99%.
Yet you'd be the first to say - well, Obama did it so that makes it okay for Trump to. Ironic, isn't it?
Surely you can admit that Trump has a political incentive to making you believe that this whole thing is under control and actually being overblown.  What incentive would Fauci, the guy who has worked under the past 4 administrations, have to gain from trying to doop you?
So are the American people of this socialist puppet regime you seek to vote into office. It's not only Trump that should be scared, it's the rest of the country.  The Democratic Party is no longer the party of Kennedy that you so loved.

Some of the finest music about cops and trump I‚Äôve ever had the pleasure of to
Facts. All the comments say look and see who was buying that stock and how they related to trump.
There is a reason President Obama, President Bush, and President Clinton attended Representative Lewis‚Äô funeral. These men are filled with love, honor, dignity, and they profess unity.  There is a reason Donald Trump did not attend. He is filled with hate and professes division.
Obama's jab at Trump gets standing ovation
These aren't straw man arguments. These are ideas floated directly from Trump. She's already tracking 5% in a new poll with no msm reporting. They know who she is. They have all resources out to stop her (ballot suppression, media suppression, even Wikipedia edits).
2/ there is no sound evidence that the numbers are being inflated. These are just more talking points meant to downplay the severity of the pandemic which has been Trump's strategy this entire time. It's undeniable, why do you keep falling for it?
I hope you‚Äôre joking, because otherwise you just said one of the dumbest things ever said. Still think Trump is a secret genius?

How do you justify him wishing Ghislaine Maxwell well? You can‚Äôt just ignore that, right? Unless you never really cared about abused children, and you were just grandstanding on them for political reasons. Yes, the Clinton‚Äôs are predators, but so is Trump.
What are the Democrats proposing? All I hear is how bad Trump is. No shit Sherlock, Trump is bad, but what are you offering?
Except for also notably being a wealthy, politically connected, and vocal antimasker at a Trump rally that was predicted to spread the disease. That makes him of significant public interest, don‚Äôt kid yourself.
Trump need to be locked up. Every past president who defies court orders would have been removed from office.

I wouldn't say he deserved it, but it is his fault.  He campaigned to put Trump into office, pushed Trump's policies, and pushed for faster reopening during the pandemic.  The policies he supported got him infected and killed.

We are already in open conflict with Russia, we just happen to have a President with interests that require his denial of that reality.  Putin has made it clear how he feels about America. Trump has made it clear how he feels about Putin. And so, here we are.
Hey tRump!  Did you see the president, the "real" president speak?  It was directed at you!
And yet all of Bernie's key people are still focused on attacking the Democrats and the Democratic nominee.  Just like 2016.  Almost as if that's what he wants them to do.  When lifelong Republicans are opposing Trump, but the top Berners aren't, something's wrong.
If Trump could not win the popular vote in 2016, he most certainly cannot  come close to winning it in 2020
If that‚Äôs the case then Trump is a bookworm
Herman Cain dies of Covid. The US experiences the worst economic quarter in its history. The Feds are being forced out of Portland. The Maxwell indictment is being unsealed today. No wonder trump is making threats to delay the election.

It pains me to think my children don't remember a political time before Trump was president.
You sure talk like one. You also rely on the same ‚Äúfacts‚Äù as they do, since any reputable source will lead you to the realization that Trump opted of his own volition not to attend the service. Because he‚Äôs a coward. No one disinvited him.
I think the overwhelming reason Trump‚Äôs base still support him is  Fear  Fear that in a few years they will be a minority  Fear that the liberals are coming for their Christianity  Fear that the gays are coming for their children  Fear they have been conned and can‚Äôt admit it
In an important case like this, SCOTUS cannot send it back to the lower courts.If trump's minions thought they would win, they would already have tried this.
I don't think they will because it's not what has been pushed. The push has been change by intimidating force after the legit non-violent protesting tapered off. I think Trump will lose bc of GOP apathy &amp; those who voted Obama then Trump will vote Biden this time.
the US is at a disadvantage because of Trump's failure to provide a plan to effectively deal with COVID-19. along with the failure of governance in all others areas.
It's a funeral and he is crushing any speech that has been given since Trump took office. From any politician. I'll stop fangirling now. Lol   #Barack  #JohnLewisMemorial
I hate Trump with an unbridled burning passion unlike anything I have ever felt before. Not for my abusive ex-husband. Not even for Covid mask eschewers. He is a literal antichrist &amp; I don‚Äôt even believe in that shit. He is a blight on humanity &amp; if you can‚Äôt see that, fuck you.

You do realize President Trump made liberals mainstream media and Democrats say no we must have the elections on November 3rd completely brilliant.
How do you know he didn't? In any event, studies show it is effective *if* given early. The Left would deny people an effective treatment just to attack Trump.
Your repition of a sentence fragment as a standalone sentence, meant to emphasize the original sentence, and placed immediately after the original sentence is very trump-esque.  "...is the most viable scientific conclusion to The #TheoryofEverything. The most viable!"

That is" old news!" She was diagnosed with Coronavirus,at the time Trump's valet and secret service staff were infected.That was about two months ago.
Focus, Senator. Focus on the most pressing issues. Your jingoism toward China is meant as a distraction.  But the American people will not forget who denied the existence of the virus from the start. Trump will be sent packing.
I've been active registered democrat since 2014 and these people already have more sway over the dems, than people like me, after a few months of attacking trump's character, a strategy that doesn't actually work against a man with no shame.

Nobody orders anyone to do anything, even Trump . If he did, people would go crazy

But Trump has never been stopped on anything significant. His cronies in the senate will back his every corrupt move.
First of all, because they couldn‚Äôt. That power lies with Congress; and, second there absolutely was nor is there any need. I wouldn‚Äôt risk COVID19 for a  tRump rally but I‚Äôll risk it all to vote!

Trump says he doesn't kid. He's right about that. He has no sense of humor.
‚ÄúThe Republican Party is the central threat to America of our time‚Äù When Trump suggests something wildly unconstitutional (like, say, delaying an election) China is always a good distraction

"Berlin has long failed to meet the alliance‚Äôs target for defense spending‚Äî2 percent of GDP‚Äîbut is not behind on any payments, such as headquarters fees, contributed by member states"
Kissing Trump's ass.
If Trump doesn‚Äôt pay his bills, who is paying for the ‚Äúpretend‚Äù federal agents in Portland and other cities.
Possible topics for Trump's press conference: 1) Declaring war on China. 2) Explaining how record fall in GDP is a win. 3) Insisting he wasn't joking about delaying election.  Real purpose of press event: 1) Everyone stop looking at Obama! Look at me!

The Trump administration is doing everything they can to deflect, deflect, deflect.

"Cops for Trump" is trending. This seems like a good time to remind those people that the Republicans would gladly strip away your unions and your pensions, were it not for the fact that they need you to crush the peasants. Once robots replace you, you will become proles like us.

some say election should be delayed others say it can‚Äôt be. just another political controversy impossible say whos right and whos wrong oh well
Prolly not, but Trump's election and reelection will save the state from permanently being blue. The whole country was saved actually.

Trump floats idea of delaying the November election, a power granted to Congress, as he ramps up attacks on voting by mail By John Wagner and Amy Gardner    Is anyone surprised by this? The question is whether the military will obey this tyrant.
Putin told tRump he can delay the election.
If Donald Trump wants to tell jokes or play games, he can step down from the office and have all the time he wants to do so. While in office, we expect him to keep his eye on the ball.
Americans need to sue Donald Trump.  The virus may have started in China but other countries did it the right way.  Wore masks, social distanced and got the virus under control.  In the US we have macho morons refusing to wear masks and we 150,000 dead Americans.  #TrumpVirus
Shouldn‚Äôt have gone to that Trump rally
Why do the rape claims against Trump matter, but the rape claims against Biden dont?

Donald Trump has Gestapo Troops on American City Streets grabbing peaceful protesters throwing them in unmarked cars and driving away. Where is your outcry for that. It isn't ok in Hong Kong but it's ok in America? Where is your outcry for that. I can't hear you!
Watching people praise George W Bush for saying nice words at John Lewis‚Äô funeral. Truly cursed. In 10 years some of these people are going to be resurrecting Trump‚Äôs reputation too.

Are you losing income since Trump became President It's how his world works
George W Bush gave us Trump. His politics are responsible for what we see today. If you are actually opposed to Trump, don‚Äôt give Bush any respect.
Let's not sugar coat this or place blame anywhere else than right at tRump's feet!  He did this, and continues to do nothing and we have all suffered and will continue to suffer until his corrupt ass is kicked to the BLACK LIVES MATTER curb on Nov. 3rd

Thanks for having that Trump Rally. No facemasks.
And he listened and supported tRump espousing the benefits of not wearing a mask. Now he is dead.  He will also leave a legacy of why you definitely wear a mask when their is a pandemic raging all around you!
Can we sue trump for gnoring ur intelligence that we‚Äôd had before China came clean?
He‚Äôs no patriot; he died a sycophant, trump a$$ kisser! He deserved his fate based on his choice to go to a rally maskless to prove a point. Well, he proved a point, WEAR A MASK!

Trump, 2020: ‚ÄúWill no one rid me of this meddlesome election?‚Äù
My thoughts go out to all of the non-Trumpers that Herman Cain might have infected with his reckless "attended a Trump rally without a mask" lifestyle.  As for Herman himself, he reaped what he sowed. Good riddance.
Cain was among the highest-profile public figures in the United States to have died from Covid-19. Less than two weeks before receiving his diagnosis, Cain attended Trump's campaign rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma, which had been staged despite concerns about mass gatherings during the

Isn‚Äôt it interesting how every headline had to say he attended Trump‚Äôs Tulsa ralley without a mask. It‚Äôs as if that was indicative of something.
This is just the latest of several murders of people who are Trump supporters. These riots must stop right now!! There isnt any reason to allow violent protests!! Peaceful, maybe but the crap thats going on in Portland, Chicago et al needs every bit of military assistance!!

LIAR.  The malignancy of you, tRump and the GOP knows no bounds.  Millions of American's are going to drop off a financial cliff because of the Republican's and that is why you will all be gone come November.  Thank God.
Not fair that the Trump tweet about the election date is getting more attention than this one.
Give us your reaction to tRump's suggestion to delay the election. Or go home.
Trump is trying all in his power to stay in office because he knows as soon as he leaves-he is going to prison.
So, everyone here is 100% certain that Mr. Cain contracted the virus at the Trump Rally? Upon what is this certainty based?  Remember, people die. And the concensus of all the "experts" and their models, say that 2.5 MILLION AMERICANS SHOULD ALREADY BE DEAD FROM CV19. #Scamdemic

Trump is preparing everything he‚Äôs got to call the election into question after he loses to retain power. We cannot allow this
Can you state unequivocally that you reject the notion of a delayed Presidential election?  Regardless of whether Trump meant it or was joking...can you state without reservation that you fundamentally oppose delaying the Presidential election?
And you think Trump is a horrible person. You become what you hate.
The newest Inspector General of the USPS is a major Trump donor. His assistance in slowing and suppressing mail in votes will be helpful. I am losing any shred of hope we will be able to get this con out of our house.

In 2016 I told a relative that Trump would be a disaster. He told me that people were freaking out that Reagan would be a disaster &amp; he was fine. Regardless of your opinion of Reagan, that was true to the extent that he didn't ruin democracy. Trump is different. #TrumpIsAFailure

So if he was infected before the rally somewhere else then he was given the opportunity to contaminate others at the maskless rally. Oh that‚Äôs much better.  You think this rids Trump of culpability?
He's retooled Hillary's "basket of deplorables" for 2020.  He also thinks Trump can win. How? Everyone who is anyone says Biden has it in the bag.
That's right.  I just assume everyone I know would be at least a little bit anti-Trump.  Then one of them wears a "45" t-shirt.  There goes my perfect record.
Trump is trying to delay the election.
It keeps getting worse. He tweets this sh*t during  service. Hateful. Horrible man. The worse it gets the less I can associate with Trump supporters. If you agree with hate you too are hateful. No more hiding the truth!
Trump suggests delaying election, warns mail-in ballots to result in ‚ÄòINACCURATE &amp; FRAUDULENT‚Äô vote  #FoxNews That is an excellent Idea. America is putting off everything else until it is safer to proceed; Ex: Sports, Schools and any activities with crowds.
every single trump supporter I know that tells immigrants they should "just learn english!!!" took two years of spanish in high school and still cannot form a single coherant sentence
Make no mistake, Trump didn't think of any of this and he is a clown listening for opportunity like a Ferengi in Star Trek.

I love these wishful thinking takes. To Republicans, there is NOTHING Trump could say or do that's worse that being or agreeing with a Democrat. They are all as partisan and horrible as he is, he's just more willing to say it out loud.
Trump's now pinned his election delay tweet
On  CNNI this morning, my brother   had a few important things to say about Trump and the GOP Senate trying to reduce enhanced unemployment benefits and the big drop in 2nd quarter GDP.
I called this in Trump's first year. Herman Cain is dead from #Covid19, which he caught at Trump's rally, a pandemic Trump called "fake news," the GDP shrank by 32.9%, &amp; Trump is tanking in the polls.  If the Constitution is the "God" of the US, #Trump is its Antichrist.
Trump is completely nuts
show of hands who's surprised trump wants to delay getting voted out of office??   oh, and uhm, almost all of his family votes by mail?
Insane as he is, Donald Trump probably doesn't realize that postponing the election will lead to a Democrat Acting President on January 20th.
He sure did #Kayleigh - and now he‚Äôs dead.  Don‚Äôt suppose you‚Äôll acknowledge that it was #TulsaTrumpRally that killed him? #Trump will never mention this man again.  THATS who you work for.  150k and counting, you can bet their families aren‚Äôt supporters.
Trying to figure out what part of your comment has anything to do with what I said? Trump and his administration put out one short tweet about Lewis and it's a tweet that Trump didn't even write. Trump said he had no interest in attending the service for John Lewis. üôÑ
People really roasting Herman Cain because he was shucking and jiving at the Trump rally about not wearing mask and Coronavirus being a hoax. But this man died y‚Äôall ion think that‚Äôs 100% right to do, he still is a black man that died, but I get it.Biden is a corrupt disaster; Even his sentences are corrupt to the point that they make no sense.  President Trump had a good run and I supported him for quite awhile, but he just can't get it done...just too much arguing between him and the false media and others alike.

The House Judiciary Committee will vote on two bills and an amendment that would try to dissuade President Trump or any future presidents from abusing their pardon powers.
What idiots like Cruz, trump and many others fail to realize, is that #TraitorTrump is the POTUS, yet he takes ZERO responsibility for anything and has done nothing to improve the situation.  This happened during trump‚Äôs tenure.
I never heard anything about this, I am not a Trump fan anyway. Why doesn‚Äôt the American people know about this?!  It probably wouldn‚Äôt matter anyway they love Trump so much he can do anything and get by with it!
If you really want to be safe, don't believe anything you see in the New York Times when it involves Donald Trump.
Also, I started thinking for myself instead of listening to the news. Somewhere during then I started to realize President Trump is totally different than he is being portrayed. I only disliked him because I was being told to dislike him. I'm still learning but I'm getting there.
Oh.  It's 100% political.  No doubt about that.   But, it's popular.  And it's an opening hand-delivered to Trump by those who hate him the most.
It‚Äôs the Democrats who can‚Äôt accept that they lost the election. And now they‚Äôre so convinced that they‚Äôve already won that Pelosi is talking about having to fumigate the place to get rid of Trump.
I just think it's quite telling that Pelosi's out there already assuming Trump's lost and that he's not gonna leave and they're gonna have to fumigate the White House to get him out of there.
Also, every person pictured with Trump are contractually required to be there. (Yes, all of them.)
polls show that 71% of Americans are sick of anti-police bullshit and crime in the streets.  Trump is doing what the leaders of these cities refuse to do. It will show how Democrat mayors are implicit in the deaths of dozens of people every day. It's election gold for the GOP.
the #GestapoTrump hashtag will last a day or two, and then the violent crime numbers in the #OperationLegend cities will be released and as they fall, Trump's approval ratings will rise.   It will give these people 4 more years to come up with clever 3rd Reich bullshit hashtags.

The Trump administration will pay Pfizer nearly $2 billion for a December delivery of 100 million doses of a COVID-19 vaccine the pharmaceutical company is developing, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar announced Wednesday.
Economically and morally, Trump is still the better choice. And honestly I wish the independent candidate choice would actually count but it doesn‚Äôt, they cancel a vote out between the two parties and that sucks because they have great views and morals between the two.
No matter how dumb Trump has been acting lately, there is still no way I would be stupid enough to vote for Biden. And if you think he‚Äôs the better choice, please think about what would happen. That‚Äôs literally what the government wants and you‚Äôre letting them control you.So, the name ‚ÄúDonald Trump‚Äù will forever be linked with the word ‚Äúshrinkage.‚Äù

I still maintain that  was the only candidate that could‚Äôve stolen votes from Trump and beaten him but democrats rejected her for a rich old white guy with dementia.
Unfortunately a lot of the media reports things as ‚ÄúTrump says‚Äù in the headlines. It does a great disservice and helps misinformation spread.
I don't think Trump hated him and wished he was dead.
Very saddening. His last public appearance was at Trump‚Äôs Tulsa rally.
No one deserves to die from this virus. I am not going to take joy in anyone's death. I will, however, hold Trump and the Republican party responsible for every single COVID death.

That's totals for just 2009.  April 14, Fauci was at a press conference &amp; is quoted saying "POTUS is taken action on every recommendation made to him by his medical professionals." If Trump's response is something u have an issue w/ u should look at the ppl giving him the advice
Well his plan worked . Trump has managed divided America by causing a race war. Whites against blacks , Right against left. A pandemic that some people call a hoax. Americans are not welcome in most countries. We fight each other while Putin laughs.
And this Hurts or Affects You &amp; Your Dad in what Real Way in your daily life? So it‚Äôs Ok for you to wear a MAGA Hat or Trump Shirt (because it is your right to do so) BUT It isn‚Äôt Ok for the Astros and other Players to wear BLM shirts before a game?? Honestly How Does It Hurt U ?

I don‚Äôt blame them. Blame Trump
1. Duh.   2. That's what Trump is/ was doing but it's getting out of hand bc the fires are still burning and growing. It's no longer about BLM or Injustice. This isn't how you persuade a nation!  3. United States doesn't negotiate with terrorists.  4. 1992 LA riots solved nothing
Just pointing out you're advocating for   pro-fracking  Veto medicare-for-all  "Nothing will fundamentally change"  Other and him trying to cut Social Security.  That is more of a Republican than Trump.  This is a false choice.  Good Day
I know plenty of boomers who are OK with gay married and did not vote for Trump!
He doesn‚Äôt. Just let Trump do the heavy lifting.
Yeah that‚Äôs the right wing attitude! Trump is going down!!
Democrats don't give a dam if people die or suffer just as long as it goes against Trump.   All of this Burning Looting and Murdering of America BLM is brought to you by only the Democrats.   Chaos is 100% Democrats! All because they think it will hurt Trump.
I hope Trump uses Burisma to spy on the Biden campaign because its apparently acceptable these days to use government intelligence agencies to spy on campaign opponents now because Obama did it with no consequences
Told you Joe would weasel out of a debate because he knows Trump will mop the floor with him.
The trump administration is the Tal Shiar.
Here is some Liberal logic for you:   Protestors throw rocks and explosives at police   +   Federal agents respond to violent protestors   =   Liberal groups sue   Let us know when this makes sense to you.

Ah Nixon was like trump in many ways . Both parties wanted him out . He knew he would be arrested so he said peace out . Trump would never say he is wrong
Absolutely.  Trump 2020 another 4 years on it's way. Thanks for the reminder EX traitor in chief.
Trump is killing people. 150,000. Oh and people are hungry,no jobs and he lies
She is a really bad impersonater of a liberal. Hilarious. Trump says you‚Äôre fired. Ha
Trump girl we have different views. Yes?
At the outset of the China virus, President  and many docs said hydroxychloroquine is the answer - but the media and the Left wouldn‚Äôt hear of. They‚Äôd rather lose lives than give Trump any positive coverage. Sick.
I watched it a second time to make sure I didn‚Äôt just assume the shirt said Trump. I know people who hate Biden as much as Trump, so that comment doesn‚Äôt always mean Trump fan. In this case, it appears to.
Maybe Trump should explain his winning economy to Rep Katie Porter.
Trump is doing all the heavy lifting for Biden.

Trump frustrates me sometimes, but he is impossible not to like in this interview.
Hell friggen YES! I worry about it being canceled out by fraudulent Democrat voting. Illegal spying on the last Trump campaign then a fake Russian collusion cue to frame him and take him out so do you really think Dirty Democrats will stop at massive voter fraud? They are lawless
Its truly amazing how full of crap these Democrats aka communists really are.   They cause the problems  and force their policies of total failure and then somehow get to blame Trump.   They are either lying or mentally ill.
How convenient as always that America's attention is on communists burning down our cities while more &amp; more EVIDENCE is coming out exposing Obama, Biden and all their crimes against incoming president Trump. Dems are guilty from top down but now they don't want to talk about it.
Dump Trump. That idea, having someone other than Donald on the 2020 ticket, how many Republican minds is it running through?
These Dem mayors are practically asking criminals to burn down their cities while refusing help from the fed just b/c they think it makes Trump look bad. I feel sorry for their city residents who are afraid to oppose for fear of leftist retribution. THIS IS LEFTIST FASCISM!!!!!!
The left is the cause and creators of ALL THIS CHAOS AND DESTRUCTION and they have the audacity to try and blame Trump for THEIR ACTIONS.   It is absurd!!!
That has to be the dumbest thing i've ever heard!!  Democrats burn down the country and are the ONLY people causing chaos and destruction and try to blame Trump.   They are the cause of ALL OF IT!!   It is not Trump voters out there destroying the country its ALL DEM VOTERS! FACT

The Left only pretends like they want law and order, but they really want chaos. They're threatening more Portland-like riots if President Trump is reelected.
Trump wants to give a 10 year minimum for someone throwing a bucket of paint on a statue, and then our Justice System hands out one year to this repulsive person. Our Justice System is fundamentally flawed.

So faced with facts you spout platitudes and don‚Äôt even address it. Typical Trump supporter

And to the shock of absolutely no one, the Trump supporter misses the point.
Even if we throw Trump out in Nov will we make it to January? WTH is going on? 12,000 troops being pulled out of Germany? That's a gift to Putin. No wonder he doesn't want to talk about his conversations with him. He needs to be stopped. Do the Reps really want this to happen?
So you‚Äôre okay with destruction of property as long as it isn‚Äôt federal property? That‚Äôs an odd take for someone who presumably supports the rule of law. You should go smash up a statehouse with your guns... oh wait, you guys did that and Trump gave them his blessing.
They will do anything Trump tells them. The documentaries and the books that will be written about Trump and his band of morons are going to be amazing. And the historians...
This guy is just... wow. Trump lives the poorly educated. And this guy definitely is if he thinks anything he said is convincing or winning him anything. At this point I almost pity him...
Nope, worse. Putin has a menu of requests into Trump. For every item Trump ticks off the list a portion of his Russian debt is forgotten. The crown jewel is a US withdrawal from NATO. A large piece of Roseneft awaits if Trump can pull off a NATO exit.

Maybe that‚Äôs because Trump is historically unpopular and he runs away from press briefings when he is asked about retweeting a doctor that believes in demon sperm and thinks we use alien dna? Just a thought.

I mean Wright won by 8 in 2018. Dems more or less turned out at Presidential turnout levels and Republicans generally stayed home. With Trump on the ballot, Republicans will turnout and I think Wright will be fine.

Can you say Plump Trump?
So true!!! Plump Trump the Racist will not even go to he Capitol to pay respects to John Lewis, a man Trump could never be. Instead he admires Putin, degrades Women, and puts the Economy over Human Life. Yet, he wants our vote. Shameful!
Eating a bowl of shit is better than four more years of trump

Trump is starting to remind me of someone.

Michael... Trump supporters have been comparing Trump to your Dad for 4 years claiming he's the next Reagan or a better President than your Dad. I do not agree... But this is nothing new for Trumpocrats.
As much as it pains me to say this, we may have to sacrifice and vote Trump. Its the only way they will get the point!
Trump is a perv.
Name them. You brought it up, you provide the proof. Name the Dems that are publicly voting for Trump.
Yep. He‚Äôs the most devoted Trump ass kisser on Twitter

Shame on Trump for retweeting this mess. Presidential to the end, huh, Spanky?
Trump is sending his thugs to escalate problems so that he can claim to be the law and order candidate.  It‚Äôs no accident that he has targeted Democratic leaning areas. It‚Äôs all about his re-election. He‚Äôs failed at COVID and everything else, so scaring people is his strategy.
Is trump lactating?
Standing up for oneself isn‚Äôt whining.  If we don‚Äôt stand up for ourselves,  we sure can‚Äôt depend in people like you to do it.  You, like Trump, think no one matters if it doesn‚Äôt affect you.
No, I‚Äôve made it clear that I care about everyone who will be needlessly subjected to unnecessary dangers because Trump thinks it will help his re-election.
Wimpy man demanded that all players stand for National Anthem before his throwing out first pitch. Yankees probably couldn't promise that, so Trump is backing out, in lame attempt to save face.

There it is: the political point of his statement. As with so much that Trump does and says, it is about shifting the discussion so that disagreements or analysis becomes a personal attack. Insisting on following the Constitution on federal elections is now rank partisanship.

'I failed my fellow Americans': the white women defecting from Trump
This right here is a top reason why the line that Trump loves America is a pile of üí©. He could care less about everyone and just wants to hold on to power.
Despite the lack of evidence, the White House claimed they had ‚Äúsubstantial evidence of voter fraud‚Äù from the commission. However, that ‚Äúevidence‚Äù was never released and no one was charged with voting crimes.
Let‚Äôs talk about voter fraud. The President seems deathly afraid of ‚Äúfraud‚Äù stealing the election from him. After his election in 2016, President Trump claimed there were between 3-5 million illegal ballots cast that cost him the popular vote. (1/10)
This is Donald Trump's vision of making America great. Segregation like it used to be in the good old days. We can't let this happen.
President Donald Trump is for the first time floating a ‚Äúdelay‚Äù to November‚Äôs presidential election, as he makes unsubstantiated allegations that increased mail-in voting will result in fraud:
Three things.   1.) He can't delay the election. Only Congress can take such a drastic action -- if he read the Constitution he would know this.   2.) Mail-in voting = Absentee Voting  3.) Donald Trump votes by mail.

Lol did you really just say there is nothing evil about Joe Biden?? I can list more than the three things you listed about Trump. 2 of the 3 you listed for Trump also apply to Biden!
Trump says of accused sex abuser Ghislaine Maxwell: 'I wish her well'
Trump asked envoy to see if UK would move British Open to his Scottish resort: NYT | TheHill
#IWishHerWell Trump said of Ghislaine Maxwell.
You think Trump is trying to 'take over" KC?  Why?Everything Trump Touches Dies
I Second that...."even" if had started in China they quickly got it under control, while tRUMP was calling it a Hoax....
Sure you have. Your own line of tweets tell a different story- you‚Äôre a gullible idiot. Do get back to me with your proof. Don‚Äôt tell me to search for it. Credible proof, not from some nut job website or cult BS. Nothing from OANN or any right wing Trump fluffer. I‚Äôll wait
Not true, and even if it was- how does that change the fact that Trump has been a failure at every turn? And he even tried to delay the election with complete BS, despite the fact that it‚Äôs not Constitutional. I called my sec of state‚Äôs office to confirm. He can‚Äôt do it
End the bs then and work with trump and republicans out from behind closed doors! Like you want but you can‚Äôt reveal your two faced bs you use to manipulate your supporters!
That‚Äôs the democratic way, instead of working with Trump you resists and ruining your corrupt way over the last 50 years you‚Äôve been in Congress!
You don‚Äôt tweet them, you can‚Äôt even talk or do interviews! Don‚Äôt work joe you‚Äôre right we must re-elect Trump 2020
I mean you‚Äôve got a point he looks like one of those trump supporters ü§¢ü§Æ
Nope. Trump could be filmed live on camera in a killing spree and they would still excuse it
The three races I‚Äôm focusing on come November 3rd, 2020:  ‚úÖ = Support  Jill Schupp (D) ‚úÖ VS Ann Wagner (R) - US Rep, MO-02  Nicole Galloway (D) ‚úÖ VS Mike Parson (R) - Gov. of MO  Joe Biden (D) ‚úÖ VS Donald Trump (R) - President   CONNECT: üëáüèΩ -   -
Pompeo can testify all he wants but tRUMP cannot move the election date of November 3rd, 2020.... but we the people can and will remove a turd....
He did it to himself since he is just as ignorant as trump.
The misinformation comes from Trump. Hate to break it to you
He didn‚Äôt even necessarily get it from the Trump rally either. He could have gotten it from any number of places.
I‚Äôm embarrassed I voted for him too. One of my biggest regrets. He‚Äôs such a joke and says anything to be anti Trump. He is definitely not the conservative he painted himself to be.
Trump is the catastrophic emergency. Jeez, lady, put down that glass of kool aid for a minute.
Guess what - me and a lot of my elderly friends will NOT be voting for Trump no matter what it takes to vote. Even if it means standing in lines in the middle of a pandemic along side idiots not wearing masks. It‚Äôs that important to get Trump the hell out.
Walsh on Trump tweet: I don't give a damn if he's joking, he said it
Trump not accepting results of 2020 election before it takes place.
This Trump supporter was shown evidence that the Nazis were fascist, not socialist, and has been told that all historians will tell you the same thing. But Jenny here knows more than all the historians. Trump loves the poorly educated. #Biden2020
That black fist looks like total disrespect to our flag. Trump 2020, Trump Jr. 2024
Can Trump be charged with involuntary manslaughter?
Imagine thinking Trump will go away because of Rick. Laughable.
Good no one will be watching Trump the traitor &amp; Putins puppet.
Just like Trump the cameras show up when it‚Äôs a Covid update &amp; vicarage them nothing to be on the news at 5.

#WeWillVote to kick Trump out of office on November 3
Plump Trump is realizing he cannot lie his way out of the virus or economic conditions. His total ignorance and Fox News has put us in an unacceptable situation. You cannot fix stupid. He can barely read from a script. NOVEMBER 3 VOTE!!!! BIDEN!!!
I agree. But every tweet about pizza that is attacked by qanon doesn‚Äôt have anything actually to do with child trafficking. The Q movement has latched onto this and will call anyone who posts about pizza a pedophile, except the trump family. It‚Äôs extremely odd and unsettling.
Every news channel coved Congressman John Lewis funeral except OANN and Newsmax which I refer to as Trump's Nazi News. Shame on them.
Yes I do like Trump!
It‚Äôs not allowed by the Constitution. I called my Secretary of State‚Äôs office, and they confirmed that is not constitutional. There needs to be major pushback against Trump‚Äôs blatantly false words
Your average Trump supporter, folks. They really believe this crap. #Biden2020 #TrumpThreatensAmerica
Obama made his remarks about Louis, unlike Trump , who no matter the subject,always makes it all about him.
Right? In what universe does California go red? Especially with the train wreck that is Trump
It‚Äôs not grandstanding to speak of equality, love and compassion.  It‚Äôs such a relief from the hatred spewed every time Trump and his minions opens their mouths.
Right now, I just want to get Trump out, and then maybe we can go back to a more normal election in 2024.
He‚Äôs as petty as Trump. Just much more eloquent.
He‚Äôs a grifter. I‚Äôm sure he‚Äôll wind up on one of the Fox News clones after Trump loses
Whataboutism and a photo don‚Äôt take away from the fact that Trump has over 25 women and one child accuse him of sexual assault. Care to address that without deflection?
He won't be the only one from that Tulsa rally. And trust me Trump won't bat and eye over it. He only cares about getting reelected. So he can then  enforce his totalitarianism agenda across America.
At a time when all we are hearing is how awful this country is for black people, you would think everyone would be celebrating the life of Herman Cain. But nope. Shots at Trump is what matters.
trump: ‚Äúlet‚Äôs let children go to school, BUT we should wait for voting as it‚Äôs not safe for the people.‚Äù SHUT UP
Certified Website Of President Donald J. Trump  Mainstream Media Accountability Survey
I try to avoid potentially dangerous COVID-19 situations as much as possible, but I will gladly take the risk to vote Trump out of office in November.
When Trump first came onto the scene and everyone was calling him racist, fascist, etc., I thought it was all hyperbole.  Unfortunately, he has proven all the hyperbole to be true.
So faced with facts you spout platitudes and don‚Äôt even address it. Typical Trump supporter
Trump is alright crying foul on the 2020 election in Nov. Knowing he is going to lose. He want to delay the election to disavow the voting process, so he can try and shore up his #.  BBC News - Donald Trump suggests delay to 2020 US presidential election
, when are YOU going to LEARN  President Trump is IN THIS PRESIDENCY to ACTUALLY BENEFIT WE AMERICAN CITIZENS,  UNLIKE the Communist,  Lying, State-Run MSM, CNN,MSNBC, WE AMERICAN CITIZENS don't TRUST YOU ALL ANYMORE, nor LISTEN to YOU ALL ANYMORE= USE YOUR OWN BRAIN.
How much stock was Trump given?
Okay. No voting is fraudulent!! WHAYS NEXT MR POTUS!!! TRUMP!!!
There is fraud in everything TRUMP has to do with!!!
Last month, Cain had tested positive for COVID-19, just a little¬†over a week after he had attended a Trump campaign rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma on June 20... Now a month later, he's dead!   His death, like the other 150K+ Americans, is on  .
Trump distraction tactic after killing Herman Cain.
NO DELAY!!! Get TRUMP OUT!!!
Sad.  Now watch the illiterates, Leftist and Pandemic hysterics rush to reasons for his death and blame President Trump!
Donald Trump should resign. Pass it on.
Trump suggests delaying election, warns mail-in ballots to result in ‚ÄòINACCURATE &amp; FRAUDULENT‚Äô vote. What‚Äôs the matter Dems? You say it‚Äôs to dangerous to vote. He‚Äôs giving you than the right choice.
When your a loser try and change the rules. Guess you would take the ball home if you didn't get to start. Always DISGRACEFUL, MISERABLE, AND DISGUSTING.
Hey Trump and Trumpites!
Saying they love Donald Trump as president.
GOP Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel: Enthusiasm For Trump Higher In 2020 Than It Was In 2016
Yet more proof that Trump is a hypocrite
So what are you trying to saw Post, that when President Trump gets re-elected, your Liberals editors can yelling interference and collusion again?  Nice time to continue the Democrat lies.
He‚Äôs a trump ass kisser. He thinks this is going to win votes.
WE ARE DONE UNLESS WE VOTE TRUMP IN!
You never actually answered the question. How many times has Trump sat down with CNN? Or MSNBC? Or anywhere besides Fox or their many imitators?
But when Trump brags about being a ‚Äústable genius‚Äù and his ‚Äúbig brain‚Äù, you cheer him? Hypocrite much?
Ah, pivoting to another talking point because you have no adequate defense. Another time honored Trump supporter tactic
Sorta like how y'all think Traitor Trump is God.
Is your last name Trump? Do you share any Trump DNA?  Are you related to Trump in any manner? Are you or have you ever been a Trump doctor, lawyer, or any business associate of Trump? If you answered NO to ALL of these questions... you have my vote and unrelenting support!!!
As you spread the Trump Virus!
And to the shock of absolutely no one, the Trump supporter misses the point.
Even if we throw Trump out in Nov will we make it to January? WTH is going on? 12,000 troops being pulled out of Germany? That's a gift to Putin. No wonder he doesn't want to talk about his conversations with him. He needs to be stopped. Do the Reps really want this to happen?
So you‚Äôre okay with destruction of property as long as it isn‚Äôt federal property? That‚Äôs an odd take for someone who presumably supports the rule of law. You should go smash up a statehouse with your guns... oh wait, you guys did that and Trump gave them his blessing.
They will do anything Trump tells them. The documentaries and the books that will be written about Trump and his band of morons are going to be amazing. And the historians...
This guy is just... wow. Trump lives the poorly educated. And this guy definitely is if he thinks anything he said is convincing or winning him anything. At this point I almost pity him...
Nope, worse. Putin has a menu of requests into Trump. For every item Trump ticks off the list a portion of his Russian debt is forgotten. The crown jewel is a US withdrawal from NATO. A large piece of Roseneft awaits if Trump can pull off a NATO exit.
Why don‚Äôt you do your job to try to help the country instead of trying to impeach Trump impeach barr impeach impeach get over it just do what you‚Äôre there to do to help the people
It‚Äôs an article on the Lincoln project and their breakdown. That they have made Trump their focus doesn‚Äôt mean the article requires an equal expose on Trump.
Only Plump Trump could support this so called physician. Wonder, what is her Health Grades rating? Is there any sane individual who actually believed her. We realize our President is demented, and tweets gibberish. Covid-19 is real and dangerous.
I‚Äôm not a young woman and NOTHING will stop me from voting on November 3. I‚Äôll stand in rain, snow, amid a pandemic surrounded by idiots without masks to vote for Biden.  Trump will do anything to steal this election.
Biden or Trump we are screwed
'Trump is right about the coronavirus. The WHO is wrong,' says Israeli expert - Israel News -
He refused to acknowledge Trump so sorry!! Could care less!!
There‚Äôs more evidence linking the  flunkies to Russia than there ever was linking Trump to Russia. Crazy weird how that‚Äôs not a concern now.
They‚Äôre all just trying to gaslight us. Anything to keep Biden out of office because they know trump is going to lose.
Since you believe that we only need one piece of evidence for something to be true, I would think you would understand that Umbrella Man from the article is clearly a Trump supporter? Why do you support right wing violence?
This is #MAGA ?? Fuck you Trump!! #VoteBlueNoMatterWho
The GOP'S Congress, has their (Back Turned) to the American People, only open to tRUMP and Clonies....
Again, there was a hearing. Take off your Trump goggles and listen to the charges they laid out. It‚Äôs called youtube- go search for it!
President Trump IS DOING HIS JOB, &amp; has been for ALMOST 4 YEARS, even with ALL the ATTACKS, LIES by the Socialist Democrats,Progressives,Liberals,Left,Radical Left,Communist, State-Run, Propagandist MSM,Hollywood, &amp; He will for 4 MORE YEARS, His SUPPORTERS are SO NUMEROUS.
Getting to only Trump and Clinton falls at the feet of voters. Doesn‚Äôt mean every voter is to blame but overall that‚Äôs who voters gave us.
You are very off topic now. We were discussing Trump‚Äôs reliance on quack doctors that believe in demon sperm and alien dna. Nothing you brought up is relevant to that. Swing and a miss
YEAH, President Trump, TELL IT EXACTLY like IT IS, that's what I LOVE about YOU, to the POINT,  ALL OUR USA MILITARY are NOT the WORLD'S POLICE FORCE, PROMISE MADE &amp; KEPT, KEEP BRINGING THEM HOME, don't LISTEN to VOICES who SAY NAY, I SAY YES, &amp; I'm SURE their FAMILIES AGREE.
Trump and Barr cannot dispatch federal agents to take over local law enforcement activities simply because they might think local police are doing a poor job.
Joe's HIDEOUS HIDEOUS RUN as SOC DEM Candidate is going to his INFLATED HEAD, ONLY President TRUMP &amp; SAVVY BUSINESSMAN CAN &amp; WILL REBUILD our ECONOMY &amp;  doing so NOW, 14 MILLION JOBS  ALREADY, POOR OLD JOE, PRESIDENT TRUMP is 14 MILLION STEPS AHEAD of him.
Trump is not only an idiot with declining mental capacity, he has to be was on some drugs that make him think UFO alien DNA is turning people into atheists, and that black American reporters actually look like Michael Bloomberg. He may need an involuntary mental evaluation.
Hi Connie, NO WAY, President Trump is ALMIGHTY GOD'S ANOINTED &amp; CHOSEN ONE for a TIME SUCH AS THIS,  I TRULY BELIEVE Our ALMIGHTY GOD will GIVE US a SEASON of HIS PEACE &amp; UNITY, I TRUST in HIM TOTALLY,  HE is WAITING for US ALL to DO LIKEWISE &amp; PRAY,  show NO INDIFFERENCE to HIM.
Sad that we even have to think about this. There is genuine fear about what trump will do if he loses in November.
Trump‚Äôs America
Can't fix ignorance and stupid. Must be Plump Trump supporters. No Mask, No Insurance, No Responsibility. Just Selfishness, Me First, and No Respect for Fellow Man. JESUS WILL BE SO PROUD OF YOU.
Like how Putin can screw up our election to keep Trump in power?
I want Trump gone. He‚Äôs been an embarrassment and has brought turmoil and hatred long enough. Biden will bring dignity back to the presidency.
Odds are good Trump won‚Äôt do the debates. The day he takes a dementia test live will be truly hilarious, but will never come because he‚Äôs both a coward and a moron.
Just think, she is way smarter than trump
Shouldn‚Äôt you be working instead of posting this BS? There‚Äôs a pandemic- wait, you trust Dr Alien DNA. Go toddle off to a game of golf and let Dr Fauci and the actual experts handle the Trump virus.
Not to mention that Obama and Biden put together a pandemic response team and listened to medical experts. Trump dismantled the pandemic response team and ignores medical experts. #Biden2020
Trump doubles down on defense of hydroxychloroquine to treat COVID-19
I mean, we could have if they had actually held the Republican convention in person like Trump wanted.
Uh huh. I will take the word of you, some random guy or girl on twitter, and the word of a quack doctor that Trump retweeted because she supports his (and your) so called miracle cure. I will completely accept that BS instead of the CDC during a pandemic that has killed 140K
Not xenophobic. But I‚Äôm pretty sure you chanted right along with Trump about his flimsy wall, so perhaps you are projecting? What med school did you attend? And in what year? Because I really don‚Äôt buy that you‚Äôre a doctor, buddy.
Him and all the professional Trump fluffers on Twitter. It‚Äôs almost mesmerizing to watch. And laugh at.
I wonder how that kid feels, knowing he has ruined his entire political future by supporting Trump and this level of insanity
Seriously, alien dna? Demon sperm? Followed up with him scurrying from the room like a frightened mouse when  calls him on his BS? C‚Äômon,  have some goddamn dignity. You swore an oath to the US, not Trump. Act like it. #TrumpleThinSkin
Ah, I forgot that trump supporters have to have everything explained to them in simple terms. I don‚Äôt want to continue speaking with you. Can‚Äôt get much clearer than that.
The ‚Äúsilent majority‚Äù has never stopped yelling about Trump. Do you need a refresher on what silent means?
Maybe that‚Äôs because Trump is historically unpopular and he runs away from press briefings when he is asked about retweeting a doctor that believes in demon sperm and thinks we use alien dna? Just a thought.
Might as well be another quote about 2020 Trump abruptly ends briefing after being pressed over retweeting misinformation
Not to mention Trump abolished the pandemic response team.
Maybe you'll attract some Russian Bots or skinheads. Have you run over to the WH to tell Trump?
Another part of the Constitution that Barr and Trump‚Äôs criminal cabal has violated! Thanks to Boris up there for pointing it out!
Why remove Donald Trump Jr??? Board Certified Doctors who see and treat patients every day say use Hydroxychloroquine.  Just because it doesn‚Äôt agree with the Dems narrative he gets removed??  SHAME ON TWITTER!!!!!
Twitter, you need to give Donald Trump Jr. His accessibility back. We need to know the truth.....you suck Twitter!
Every question Trump doesn‚Äôt like is ‚Äúfake‚Äù, ‚Äústupid ‚Äú or ‚Äúnasty‚Äù. Decorum went out the door the minute he declared his candidacy.
Nadler like every other corrupt politician been in congress for way too long need to go to have real change and not cause such resistance to trump trying to make good changes and undo the corrupt bs previous administration has done
Trump‚Äôs popularity would jump to 70% if he just shut up for two weeks.  He‚Äôs his own worst enemy.
They might be giving Trump and his criminal cabal more rope to hang themselves with. Never interrupt your enemy when he is making a mistake.
Keep telling yourself that is what‚Äôs going to happen. Several red states, TX included, are competitive in a presidential election, and in your mind that automatically translates to a Trump landslide? Really?
I didn‚Äôt expect to get anything out of it anyway. Tit for tat. I am so sick of this mess everyday everyday. I can hardly wait for Trump to go so we can get some peace &amp; try to straighten out his mess, as Dems always do after a Rep Prez. This one is a big F U.
Just the start of Trump Police state.
hey the narrative that kanye is only running to help trump is kind of problematic in that it implies that a black candidate you disagree with must only be in it to help a powerful white man end rant
My opinion, if tRUMP is re-elected there will be no Presidency left, just Dictatorship....
I mean Wright won by 8 in 2018. Dems more or less turned out at Presidential turnout levels and Republicans generally stayed home. With Trump on the ballot, Republicans will turnout and I think Wright will be fine.
Do You Approve Of President Trump?
Only show the violence. Don't show the unidentified militia. Trump wants this &amp; the protesters are playing into his hands. It's hard to watch 14 yr old girls being assaulted  by 4 or 5 of these goons. It's all for show.
Tell Congress: Stop Donald Trump's secret police!
Same poll has Trump down by 13, so Gardner is showing some crossover appeal. Of course if Trump loses by double digits, I don‚Äôt see Gardner winning but if Trump manages to keep his loss within single digits, Gardner could pull it out.

If you support trump and his Gestapo f*ck off! #TrumpGestapo #TrumpFailedAmerica
Did you see he's now pulling a page from the Trump playbook saying, in essence, "I was joking."
Can you say Plump Trump?
So true!!! Plump Trump the Racist will not even go to he Capitol to pay respects to John Lewis, a man Trump could never be. Instead he admires Putin, degrades Women, and puts the Economy over Human Life. Yet, he wants our vote. Shameful!
Eating a bowl of shit is better than four more years of trump
If only you cared that he evidently likes to grab women by the pussy.
Trump is starting to remind me of someone.
Trump will just veto it!
False. Sorry lassie. Enjoy Trump while you have him. Ain‚Äôt gonna be long.

Michael... Trump supporters have been comparing Trump to your Dad for 4 years claiming he's the next Reagan or a better President than your Dad. I do not agree... But this is nothing new for Trumpocrats.
As much as it pains me to say this, we may have to sacrifice and vote Trump. Its the only way they will get the point!
Trump is a perv.
Name them. You brought it up, you provide the proof. Name the Dems that are publicly voting for Trump.
Yep. He‚Äôs the most devoted Trump ass kisser on Twitter
For some reason they made supporting Trump the center of their lives. They can‚Äôt admit they were wrong in supporting his actions, so they make up BS like Jacquelyn does

2/ will be a productive member of society.     You are correct Trump is an idiot and is dangerous as our president.  We have to work to elect Joe Biden because we cannot be sure that Trump will not manipulate the vote as he did in 2016.
Trump says he's the least Racist person. But won't pay his respects to Sen. John Lewis a highly respected Senator and Civil Right leader. Every other President has pay respect to fellow politician's regardless of race, believe and party until this POS.
Great political plan.   Trump keeps nuking his own campaign.   Why would Biden take a chance of actually influencing voters, with his lack of mental acuity.  Trump better wake up soon, he is bleeding voters.  If Biden won‚Äôt compete, Trump needs to find a new foil, and quickly.
Right, I think a big part of it is the establishment finally found something they can effectively bludgeon Trump with heading into the election and they're not going to let up. Even beyond the election, this hysteria is a $-maker for so, so many ppl (media, gov., pharma, etc.)
The people in Mexico are saying;  trump actually wanted us to pay for that??! üòÑüòÑ
They are there on trumps behalf.. trump sprayed this man
His cognitive test was an Alzheimer's test not an intelligence quotient test. In which Trump called "Iquity Test".

I just want to say that I've met at least two - three women that ether worked for &amp;/or with Mr. Trump for sometime. They all said. He was one of the most honest, hardworking person that cares very Deeply About Our Country
Do you know how to listen for tone? I watched that clip, and he wasn‚Äôt ‚Äútrolling‚Äù Maxwell. He literally wished her well, buddy. Trump supporter excuses for ‚Äúthis is what he meant‚Äù are getting worse by the day
I absolutely agree.  They are peaceful protestors.  There are even right wing radicals infiltrating and starting fires, etc.  After arrests, it became clear that they were there trying to make the peaceful demonstrations look as though they were violent.  Trump‚Äôs thugs incite.
PRESIDENT JOE - PLEASE POINT OUT THAT TRUMP LETS THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE TO DIE FROM COVID BY DOING NOTHING, BUT SENDS HUNDREDS OF TROUPS TO PORTLAND FOR PUBLICITY. WHY DONT YOU GO THRU A LIST OF NAMES THAT HAVE DIED.

Correct. Trump‚Äôs twitter activity doesn‚Äôt move voters one way or the other.
Really?  Trump's America is actually killing us and he won't do anything to make it better, he is going to make it even worse by sending kids to school during a raging pandemic.
Everyone I know who voted for HRC or who didn‚Äôt vote because they thought she had it learned their lesson in 2016. We‚Äôre voting #Biden2020ToSaveAmerica and we‚Äôre all voting and campaigning like we are 15 points behind in the polls like Trump is right now.
Shame on Trump for retweeting this mess. Presidential to the end, huh, Spanky?
Trump is sending his thugs to escalate problems so that he can claim to be the law and order candidate.  It‚Äôs no accident that he has targeted Democratic leaning areas. It‚Äôs all about his re-election. He‚Äôs failed at COVID and everything else, so scaring people is his strategy.
Is trump lactating?
Standing up for oneself isn‚Äôt whining.  If we don‚Äôt stand up for ourselves,  we sure can‚Äôt depend in people like you to do it.  You, like Trump, think no one matters if it doesn‚Äôt affect you.
No, I‚Äôve made it clear that I care about everyone who will be needlessly subjected to unnecessary dangers because Trump thinks it will help his re-election.
I find it extremely ironic that all of the people who said "Trump would destroy America" are the one's burning our cities to the ground.
You have to fight fire w/fire. It‚Äôs the only game Trump knows. Burn down the house.
Trump is going to pick Nikki Haley for VP. Trump need someone to blame for the coronavirus that‚Äôs why he put pence in charge. trump is going to say pence was at fault.
As I keep saying the GOP IS Trump's party now. It's main interests is to support and defend Trump. Headed by  and Trump's life long Democrat son-in-law... Holding on money back to support down ballet races. I would never donate to the GOP now. Corrupt Party.

By helping our citizens, they will, again, be admitting that they and Trump failed us &amp; that we are in the process of collapse as a country. As of now, their inclination is to ignore the misery of our citizens, as protections against evictions  expire and hunger runs rampant.
And why, in the name of God, would God need to have Trump's back? I mean, honestly the confuzzled order of things that some people ascribe to...
Seems quite clear that AJ turned on Trump once she realized he wasn‚Äôt going to bail her out from having shitty taste in men.
That‚Äôs a question I ponder daily. I think trump is the Antichrist.
Trump is no Reagan. Reagan had empathy, courage and compassion. Trump is a sociopath, sadistic racist,  and narcissist. Is it so hard to figure the Reagan Library and Foundation do not want him to mention Reagan.
Well said. Trump is throwing your children and all school personnel to the wolves.  They are a sacrifice to his bid for re-election. He cares for no one other than himself. If you didn‚Äôt believe it before now, here‚Äôs your proof. Wonder how dead kids and teachers going to play?
No, it wasn‚Äôt about science.  It was about politics.  Political pressure from the Trump White House and Trump‚Äôs re-election strategy drives the reopening, regardless of subjecting children and school personnel to infections and death. To Trump, it‚Äôs all about what benefits him.
Never have we been put in such dire straits. The great depression was caused by greed economics not a Pandemic. Our Treasury Secretary is as inept as Plump Trump.

Wow I only wish people how think trump is a piece of shit would actually look at there own party and realize it is 1000 times worse
I have a joke about the Trump/Russia scandal, but her emails.
Your third party vote will be very effective in helping Trump. Glad we agree on that
Christians.  The Bible said the AntiChrist would come. He‚Äôs here, &amp; you have been worshipping him. Vote for someone who actually exhibits the values that you profess to use in your life. And that‚Äôs definitely not Trump, the liar, fornicator &amp; thief who consorts with our enemies.
It makes no difference whether Trump or Biden win America is so fucked either way #EndThe2PartySystem #VoteThirdParty
Republicans, who failed to protect America, should lose.  They don‚Äôt deserve the support of our citizens, as they stood by, supported&amp; applauded Trump,  abetting him as he flaunted our constitution &amp; our laws. Replace them with respresentatives who respect us &amp; our our democracy.

He's not even a leftist, he's just a moderate who doesn't believe in anything. It's the most basic position to take, requires the least though, and is generally the most popular. Biden is trash, Trump is trash. This may be one place where the left and the far right can agree.

His death is on Trump‚Äôs hands. Let‚Äôs never forget that, while mournful, this was a completely preventable death. Trump cares not at all for those in his own administration. How much do you think he cares about you? (The answer is also not at all.)
Trump is dead weight now. They can still get their agenda pushed through now that he's installed their apparatus.
I never said Trump hasn't done a number of good things. It's just the bad things he has done far outweighs the good things, in my opinion. I don't think you can really hate a guy for voting for what he believes in.
WAY TO GO TWITTER.  YOU ANTI AMERICAN PRICKS.
You can't make the case in defense of him can you? This is how I can tell you don't care about policy, it's all just team warfare. I'm not on your team, or trump's team.

This was the headline Trump wanted to shift today's conversation away from with the bogus tweet about delaying the Nov. 3 Election - a date he has no authority to change - only Congress can. Don't go for the fake. Keep the discussion right where it belongs
In ordinary times, Trump's tweet today ALONE would push forward an investigation into election interference. This is a failure to uphold his Oath in plain language. If re-elected, each of these foundational cracks he's made turn us into a nation no longer bound by written law.
I'm never going to forget that he caught COVID at a Trump rally and died from it.  His dedication to ironic humor was amazing.

They have no choice. They have to try and interpret Trump's message. He tries to appeal to everyone except those that won't kiss the ring, the ones with integrity or the fortitude and ability to see through the lies. The smoke has been there since the civil rights movement.
Trump doesn't control McConnell. McConnell controls Trump. Putin controls Trump. White Nationalist control Trump. Trump has so many puppet masters it is a wonder their strings don't all get tangled. And due to the lies told, the ignorant, the racist, and the zealous interpret.
If you think that Trump is making the moves that he's making on his own volition, you're wrong. He's receiving advice from those who know how to stroke his ego, who pretend to adore him, and who have agendas of their own. Make no mistake.
Trump is an extremely weak leader, severely flawed, and unfortunately easily manipulated. He seeks validation through adoration. Those who are principled have no choice but to attack him head on. Republicans, right wing media, t.v. evangelist, &amp; foreign dictators understand this.
Trump used gaslighting so expertly that Republicans couldn't help but adopt the practice. They employ it so much as does the right wing media that now learning the truth has become a scavenger hunt. All of the conspiracy theories cropping up are a direct result of all this lying.
Police employed gaslighting but never embraced it. Not really. They were hobbyist when it came to gaslighting, but Trump? Trump took that shit pro. And no matter how much you want to criticize that bastard, he has a PhD in gaslighting.

Trump has been repeatedly slow to condemn white supremacists who endorse him, and he regularly retweeted messages from white supremacists and neo-Nazis during his presidential campaign.
He argued in 2016 that Judge Gonzalo Curiel ‚Äî who was overseeing the Trump University lawsuit ‚Äî should recuse himself from the case because of his Mexican heritage and membership in a Latino lawyers assoc
As a candidate in 2015, Trump called for a ban on all Muslims coming into the US. His administration eventually implemented a significantly watered-down version of the policy.
Trump launched his campaign in 2015 by calling Mexican immigrants ‚Äúrapists‚Äù who are ‚Äúbringing crime‚Äù and ‚Äúbringing drugs‚Äù to the US. His campaign was largely built on building a wall to keep these immigrants out of the US.
2011: he also argued that mb Obama wasn‚Äôt a good enough student to have gotten into Columbia or Harvard, and demanded Obama release his university transcripts. Trump claimed, ‚ÄúI heard he was a terrible student. Terrible. How does a bad student go to Columbia and then to Harvard?
2011: Trump played a big role in pushing false rumors that Obama ‚Äî the country‚Äôs first Black president ‚Äî was not born in the US. He even sent investigators to Hawaii to look into Obama‚Äôs birth certificate.
2010:On The Late Show With David Letterman, Trump argued, referring to Muslims, ‚ÄúWell, somebody‚Äôs blowing us up. Somebody‚Äôs blowing up buildings, and somebody‚Äôs doing lots of bad stuff.‚Äù
2000: In opposition to a casino proposed by the St. Regis Mohawk tribe, which he saw as a financial threat to his casinos in Atlantic City, Trump secretly ran a series of ads suggesting the tribe had a ‚Äúrecord of criminal activity [that] is well documented.‚Äù

1989:The teens‚Äô convictions were later vacated after they spent seven to 13 years in prison, and the city paid $41 million in a settlement to the teens. But Trump in October 2016 said he still believes they‚Äôre guilty, despite the DNA evidence to the contrary.
1988: In a commencement speech at Lehigh University, Trump spent much of his speech accusing countries like Japan of ‚Äústripping the United States of economic dignity.‚Äù This matches much of his current rhetoric on China.
He went to Trump‚Äôs Tulsa rally.

So this is Trump is spewing nonsense, the GDP shrank at an annual rate of 32.9% in the second quarter ‚Äî the sharpest economic contraction in modern American history. The economic shock in April, May and June was more than 3 times as sharp as the previous record ‚Äî 10% in 1958.
Everything Trump Touches Dies.
Trump literally killed Herm. Sad.
I just wanna say thank you to Garett Haake, and all the reporters on the ground doing the right thing about Trump‚Äôs tweet. Don‚Äôt call an election expert, make the Republicans go on record!
I know there is a lot to pay attention to right now, COVID-19, Trump‚Äôs threat to delay the election, but you also need to watch this. Republicans may yet succeed in destroying the economy.
Thank you D.Trump by not defiling John Lewis's funeral with your presence.  You are the antithesis of the good John stood for all his life.  You are the personification of division and hatred, and a putrid stain in this great country.#TedSpeaksTheTruth
Donald Trump should resign. Pass it on.
The American people should be able to sue Trump and all his supporters for the death and destruction they caused by failure to lead during Covid.  They are still failing, bodies stacking up!#TedSpeaksTheTruth
There is nothing, and I mean nothing that trump will not do for his god Vladimir Putin.
While true had trump not held a rally and told people it was safe to attend when he knew full well it wasnt then people wouldnt have had to make that stupid decision.
No one thinks it's great to kill babies up to due date. There is no party platform that thinks that.  Just because Donald Trump says it, doesn't mean it's true.
Trump can spout all the nonsense he wants to -- and he will do anything to divert our attention from the 153,000 who have died on his watch.   But the Constitution has spoken. He can't do anything about that.
Dear Kevin McCarthy, we are still waiting for a replacement for the ACA the Republinazis have been promising for years.  You are are just another Trump coat tail chaser.  How pitiful is that? Pick Tammy Duckworth for VP.#TedSpeaksTheTruth
This breaks my heart. and people are blaming the trump rally! He also travelled extensively
He attended the Tulsa trump rally! Wow!
Agreed. Trump invalidates his legitimacy by manipulating the election.
The cause for spikes Laura is Trump's failure to lead and conservative governor's following his abysmal example.  They all bear responsibility!#TedSpeaksTheTruth
President Pelosi can't actually happen if Trump/Congress delay election. House members must renew terms every two years on Jan 3. Which means that By rule Pelosi can't become President because she's not a sworn House member. Be default  becomes new POTUS.
Trump help the economy 100000000%
Half those governors do everything Trump wants and the other half were already doing some form of lockdown, mask orders or both. You're acting like he had no power. And I think your first argument is so bad and a thing veil for some shit opinions about race
Trump‚Äôs attempts at election manipulation invalidate his legitimacy to hold the highest office. Since  is impotent, SCOTUS must be the check.  is no longer Conservative. It is a tool of immorality and indecency.

What does the homogeneity of a population have anything to do with it. And Trump spent months downplaying it and refusing to set an example. Whether or not we rely on local and state government doesn't matter. He didn't have to turn it into a partisan thing.
Never America first; always trump first!
Trump‚Äôs behaving the way someone who is drowning does. He‚Äôs splashing and flailing like crazy and will pull down anyone who gets close to try to help him. This is not good.
Can we just tell Trump's supporters that he did delay the election and it isn't November 3rd?
Of course it is. Completely on brand for Trump.
Trump‚Äôs said a lot of scary things, but this is, by far, the most frightening to me. We can‚Äôt allow this evil, lying, manipulative, unAmerican embarrassment to further weaken and delegitimize our democracy.
Im angry also that on one hand you refer to john lewis as a martyr to the cause of justice and on the other refer to an angry people! Yes angry on both sides. Systemic rascism used  w such ease that it fuels the anger! Disagree w ur op on Trump this am. Makes me angry! GOP 2020!
PRESIDENT DONALD Trump. tells the truth.  Fauci is a FRAUD and a LIAR
This is what trump wants. He wants to arrest ppl like me who speak out against his racist regime that encourages the rest of racist-amerikkka to come out from hiding and be loud. Well in that case, FUCK YALL! Arrest me, kill me, if that helps end racism and police brutality üñïüèΩüñïüèΩ

I think most trump supporters think they are because they can say idiotic things freely because the president does.
No it wont. Trump doesnt realize the "mail-in" doesnt require the p.o. to participate at all. If the republicans can ballot harvest &amp; turn in entire neighborhoods thru one person, why cant we? Im more than willing to go around my area and collect and turn in for those that cant.

It‚Äôs time for her to retire she‚Äôs trying to hold off retiring to make sure that if Biden wins she can retire after he wins, right? She has no plans to retire or die as long as Trump is president and that‚Äôs a big concern.

Except your "ban" allowed 40k americans and 8k chinese nationalist back into the US w/o any tests, quarentines, temps or anything upon arrival and many of them came in directly from Wuhan.
Then maybe trump should have sent the USS Comfort with orders to accept COVID patients as soon as it got there when thier hospitals were overflowing instead of waiting 2 weeks after its arrival to gove the order to accept them. Where else were those patients suppose to go?
But im sure that has nothing to do with trump denying those states aid and stealing the PPE they ordered and reselling it to other states though, right?

Trump violated the rules of the Reagan Foundation. It's not political. It's just business, dumbass. What does Trump do when someone uses his name for monetary reasons without his permission? Yeah, I thought so.
Bernell Trammell‚Äôs death may or may not have anything to do with his political views, no evidence to suggest it is. He supported trump AND BLM, he also supported a (Dem) mayor. Unfortunate, yes. But don‚Äôt make accusations without proof.
So Trump's whole family votes by mail , this is his admission of his corruption!

President Trump, you are the political crime of the century.   Please do the honorable thing and step down.   Only those you have gaslighted want you, most Americans skin crawls when you speak.

The press secretary continues to lie about trump and masks!  He first refused to wear a mask &amp; said until very recently. Then he said masks were a choice for everyone &amp; he wouldn‚Äôt wear one.  Now he says it is probably better to wear one.  Consistent????  No!

‚ÄúIt is time for Congress to investigate the emergency authorities given to the chief executive. ‚Äú
But is his badness a good enough reason to reject a medical intervention? Would you turn down medicine just because you don't like Trump? That's my point.
According to Trump .That will be more lives lost
You and Trump have many things in common
His supporters will buy all of it and think Trump is a f-ing genius.
Go Donald Trump!!!!!!!!!! #Trump2020LandslideVictory
All of a sudden Trump cares about the social welfare of kids. What about the kids you took away from their parents. #Pressconference
WHY does this remind me of every Trump "Gotcha!" headline?
The level they will go to just to never admit trump might be bad
Well it's great you love buildings being burnt down and kids shot but sure Trump is overreaching by helping them cut it out
Did Trump say something dumb? I keep seeing tweets about ‚Äúman, woman, tv.‚Äù
But it actually IS trump‚Äôs America under his watch. And it is a scary place NOW!
Those who seriously use the trump claim of being a ‚Äústable genius‚Äù as a topic of conversation should have their own cognitive skills tested..
Wait a min. Hold on. Where‚Äôs all those ppl that immediately shower Trump with praise after his every tweet? I‚Äôm not seeing them anymore Don. Did u have to divert funds from fake Twitter accounts to tv ads in response to the so, so many ppl that despise u on both sides?We have had too much rain today... damn it Trump! üôÑ Cuomo/s are terrible people!!
I‚Äôm a trump hater but they can be different. You request an absentee ballot when you‚Äôre not able to vote in person (travel, illness, etc.) Mail-in ballots are usually determined by a state and sent out to all registered voters to use instead of in-person voting.
Michelle Obama describes Barack as ‚Äòformer president who reads and knows history‚Äô, in apparent swipe at Trump   A business man who raises the economy is as important as a history or geography student. Business folks are great in Math &amp; calculations.
I am going to volunteer for somebody who is not part of swamp, just like Trump, like Herman Cain, outsiders. I feel its wrong for all those who have long been in politics from the start to kick out those who come in new from outside call us deplorables, just cos we are not toilet
Got you. So all this about racism is a lie as Herman Cain supported President Trump he is obviously black, but he was not involved in politics but has been a businessman, like Trump. What is wrong with that? So they can't enter politics directly? I want to enter politics now.
Trump and Herman Cain are business people, outsiders, did not go through the formal route of congressman, senator, governor or born to a politician in power, they came from outside, without being soaked up in the swamp of politics before becoming president, or a supporter. Ha ha.
I wonder if she is from planet earth?
Truer words have never been spoken. Hate that phrase with a passion. I won‚Äôt even use it as a descriptor of all the lies that trump, his administration and many Republicans tell.
Yes I'm voting for President Trump state of Missouri
They never err on the Trump side
On your first point.. NO CHANCE, I can send you artical after artical of biased and unfair characterizations of something Trump said or did.  I agree more discussion between the sides are needed, but it‚Äôs not 1 sided.
Trump needs to resign right now   #TrumpMustGo
I agree, but that‚Äôs not being pushed.  See above;  the narrative is what‚Äôs being pushed.  They had to mention he was at a ‚ÄúTrump rally‚Äù, do they can tie the two together.
Media trying to tie Trump rally with infection.  Media is a joke these days!!!  I wonder how many ppl got covid at a protest and died?  Do you think they would use a photo of that to push a narrative of where the contracted it?  NO!!
Trump saying it‚Äôs not good Enuff for you Trishüò°üò°üò°That‚Äôs why your were you are!!!
Looks like gangsters are giving states to trump.THANKS.
I am very sorry to hear this . I swear this Virus has a karma factor . Be bold ... go to a Trump rally without a mask ... its just a hoax.
China warns India against 'forced decoupling' of their economies   Why would India trade with an invading neighbor? That is an enemy that should be avoided, rejected &amp; snubbed. At least US is doing that, they are cutting of China under Trump &amp; Obama opposes
Can Trump order voter ID to protect integrity of election?I say yes.
The great irony ‚ÄúI‚Äôll do it myself‚Äù  Donald Trump you have done enough.  You have also not done enough.  When you say  ‚ÄúI‚Äôll do it ‚Äúand it fails you blame it on others. Donald J Trump it‚Äôs time for to be still.  You and your Administration have failed.  It‚Äôs not fake our it‚Äôs rea
Well, Putin is Trump's ally and Trump has a crisis with his re election.

Trump Falsely Claims Much of U.S. Is ‚ÄòCorona-Free‚Äô - The New York Times

To take a person who was loved as much and Martin out of context shows a lack of knowledge, honor, respect.  I can only speculate with respect  they both Malcom and Martin would view Donald Trump as the white devil.  Full of sin and hate for people of color.  They would protest!
And when stepping back to consider the wider picture - if the medicine works; and if it had been employed when Trump first suggested; how many lives would still be living today? If it doesn't work, someone needs to tell those people it helped...
Donald Trump and his administration never stop producing turmoil. The events are occurring so fast and without proper discussion Congress is blind sided. The Trump administration is planning to remove 12,000 troops from Germany weakening NATO as punishment.  Russia is happy!
You voice comes from hell like your cult masters.  Associating The Trinity with cruelty, prejudice, greed, hatred, separation, lust, division, lies, deception, suffering and death.  Donald Trump is no more than a cult leader rotten with sin reaping now what he has planted.
The false information and blame never ends! With each tweet Donald Trump falls deeper into a pit. Some drug companies are rejecting Trump because he is using them as a political weapon. You are giving dangerous drug information to citizens which is unethical for companies.
Suzy a robot of Donald Trump is a clear danger to America pushing a dangerous agenda.  Her rhetoric like her master only confuses our nation. The question is why does Donald Trump  appear to purposely want to bring suffering and death to America.
Trump Moans 'Nobody Likes Me,' And Twitter Critics Quickly Remind Him Why   Cruelty, dishonesty, hubris, jealousy and evil are rarely respected, but sure-let's call it his "personality.
Hey guys. Friendly reminder, Joe Biden is not the president of the United States. The orange one, Trump, is. This is under  administration.. I‚Äôm not sure what‚Äôs confusing about that.
The notion of William Barr operating  an independent Justice Department is simply not true. He is a complete and compromised loyalist of Donald Trump.  Justice for all is a myth as Trump activates William Barr as an attack dog!  Barr and Trump share one quality their both bullies
The decimated Republican Party seeing Donald Trump as unpopular and reckless are saying no and are challenging his cruelty.  They are trying to salvage want is left from blind loyalists who now appear ridiculously racist and corrupt. Trump is irrelevant and now so is the party!
Americans you have witnessed a retweet storm by Donald Trump. He is trying to remain relevant as mounting disapproval has destroyed all his credibility. He is hateful if Dr Fauci because he is now more popular and more respected.  America is looking past Trump!
Trump just can‚Äôt help himself.
Trump makes everything about himself.
Good. More Trump cultic action.
So they don't even back their own supposed candidate, they are all backing Biden. So the stimulus bill by GOP is attacking good decent Americans &amp; all of USA that Trump supposedly was protecting.
Barr must have swung a lot of votes for trump today.
They said Trump took away our nuts. So I don't know if its Trump doing the crazy gang stalking to me. Its Hillary Clinton they say. I do know the bad stuff been happening long time, people trying to kill me or do bad things to me, accidents like Toyota, Mazda suddenly speeding up
Dr Trump has a huge stockpile of this stuff he needs to sell.
Rich people who are so mean &amp; rude &amp; do such terrible things should not have power should not remain in politics should not get any support from anyone any more. Do you know who is doing gang stalking? Trump says its Hillary Clinton. The people are in the left so its radical left
Trump is so clueless.

That is what the Lincoln project and other such anti-Trump efforts have become. Get rich by fraud.
In fact Democrats those against Trump should never win in any election from now.  And we should leave all historic monuments as is. Trump 2020 - 2024 -2028... Any president has to enforce-work for a living study when you are young do not waste time, talent, resources as the norm.
A thief instead would have stolen the purse, he would not be 'working'. There is the difference and those who vote against Trump supporting these 'wasters' who spend billions of dollars so that they can make Trump 'waste' a day so they feel they have 'gained' should never win.
That is not slavery. So we can stop that nonsense about anti-Trump ads using Lincoln's name.
Because of that I do not want these 'rich' people who want to attack Trump just because he likes to not lose days or time wasted away. There is one good reason not to support anti-Trump and Lincoln Project. So they don't want anyone to work, study, as if you do, you are a SLAVE!
I put up a good message - Each day is a gift from God, make the most of it try to follow through. They want us to lose a day they want Trump to lose a day, so they psychologically target Trump. Imagine that as an agenda to win an election, to make Trump lose his day get him upset
Clearly its nothing but personal prejudice &amp; that cannot win any election truthfully. That is why you won't succeed in this bid by so many rich people just to unseat Trump.
If you do identity theft you are a liar. I know Trump enemies do that as a routine. They pretend my dog is somebody I am somebody they can use or abuse. That is the biggest lie ever. Those lies are most damaging to actual persons.
Americans developed a mistrust of the government and Donald Trump has deepened that mistrust.  Government should be by, for, and of the people but it‚Äôs not! Our government is as divided as its citizens therefore, it becomes ineffective in defining and meeting our needs.
It may be some form of truth perhaps but is your gossip doing harm to a lot of good people? Trump's team help the poor folks do better, have a good economical status, raise them from dire poverty, unemployment, misery, sickness, while your 'truth' is giving them all of that harm.
Thiruvalluvar has written ahout what is Truth. Vaimai enapaduvadhu yadhenin, yadhonrum theemai illaadha sollal. Truth is anything that by saying which no harm results to anyone. Is your version of the 'lies' you say Trump said,  the opposite? You spread gossip that is harmful
Also innocents make mistakes, then lie to cover up, to avoid humiliation, shame or cruel &amp; unusual punishment. Are you doing that to Trump perhaps? I mean people make mistakes, if you forgive one you should forgive the other.
Republican voters, some Republicans, along with all Democrats - all very rich can bribe, spend millions on targeted ads, bribing the White House team, insiders in the administration. If Trump is here in spite of all that, he is too good, &amp; is the real man
The truth in his effort to end the protests against him. Donald Trump wanted to send troops into the cities but his Generals would refuse. So he sent in Federal Forces into cities with Democratic leadership to show strength and to say democratic cities are out of control.
So someone rich should be your enemy, bribe all your family members against you -  I have had that happen to us, my own step siblings take money &amp; say &amp; do terrible things to me. Now I think I know its you, those who hate Trump who are doing that sort of strategy to oust Trump.
"We hear from inside the White House and from inside the campaign all the time now." So you have people inside the White House &amp; inside Trump's administration and his team who give you information for which you bribe them as you are very rich. Think that happening in your family
What exactly is it that Trump does that you do not do, doing all this psychological trauma on him just so you can accuse someone of sexing minors? What is this big 'liar' thing you feel Trump should be ousted for? What lie has he told ? Your ads do not have any lies in them?
Trump's "record" is a reign of destruction. You may want to sit this out...and everything else out.
Don't blame Dems. Belive me this was a Repug Trump decision.
Obama/Biden went big uniting FBI,CIA, Australia, Italy and British Spy Orgs to frame Trump, they‚Äôre so afraid of what‚Äôs coming they‚Äôve  turned their Riot Base loose.
He along with Flynn,  &amp; Kushner were trying establish a secret back channel from Trump to Putin &amp; Russia..No collusion there.
We believe Donald Trump has only a few options.  If he continues and wins he will be impeached again. If he remains in the race and defeated he will suffer an historic loss and the lost of everything. If he steps down he would leave in disgrace but privately deal with corruption
Donald Trump‚Äôs campaign committee, and advisors realize their leader is in real trouble.  No money, no spin, no adds, or attacks can change the minds of the majority of Americans. The issue is new controversies emerge each week. He is doing everything to save a sinking ship!
Donald Trump never stops driving America deeper into crisis.  Everyday he and his minions like a gang of bullies try to intimidate through force not realizing they operate from a position of weakness.  This is not the time to pick a fight with China! Trump focus on the crisis!
We are learning the Chinese will not completely vacated the consulate in Houston by 5:00 p.m.  They will contend the Trump Administration has broken international law.  They as we said are planning a tremendous economic retaliation which will rise gas prices.
Yet you will hand the country over to a yard who cannot find a running mate. A viable option would be nice. Trump is not responsible for the virus  the State Government handles that the economy would be far worse without him. Great writer. Stick to that or run and create change
Donald Trump as President is about over as we predicted.  By August 1, 2020,  the second national shut down, Americans sick and dying, schools closed, unemployment benefits ends, Michael Cohen tells all, GOP Convention cancellation. Economy crashes!  Approval rating hits 33%.
The difference in the upcoming election and 2016, is Donald Trump has a record as President. He failed to make good on his promises and in many cases his incompetence has hurt our nation.  Not even with Russian involvement Donald Trump does not  have the votes!   Change is needed
We must remember the CDC can be influenced and intimidated by Donald Trump and his administration.  Governors and Mayors not intimidated by Donald Trump and school districts with parents must protect the lives of our children and families.  Keep our children and teachers safe!
After we reviewed the news of the week there was one news story which might be the knock out blow for Donald Trump.  The release of Michael Cohen from prison. Trump threw Cohen under the bus and the DOJ kick him. The very person  who protected him who did the dirty work is free!
This was meant be to funny but it‚Äôs the truth.   Donald Trump and  his band of worshipers have hurt our nation.  He didn‚Äôt make America Great Again he made it worse!  His lies, obstruction, intimidation, foolishness, prejudice, ego, arrogance, greed, and incompetence killed us!
Biden has nothing to lose. Trump is on the hot seat. He is the Potus for the moment. You saw Trump yesterday cancel Repugs convention. Don't fool yourself Biden wants the opportunity to show his vision. He already has it up on his web site.
The Trump Administration pushed and even intimidated governors to open their businesses to early the results are disastrous.  Donald Trump now is pushing and intimidating again for opening schools which will put teachers and our children in danger.  When will learn?  Trump evil!
Do you think Trump should show his tax teturns for the last 10 years or 5 yrs.? Do you think if you hide your tax returns you should be Potus?
Debat if it happen it happens. If it don't no big deal. We the American people know the character of both men. One has shown10 years of tax returns.Trump hides his. Biden said he will release his medical records if Trump will. Trump won't. He won't release either. He hiding shit.
We are learning many school‚Äôs are planning to open with full student and teacher contact.  When teachers and students become infected and entire families fall sick.  The Trump administration will pass the blame on to state and local leadership and will again forget their rhetoric
Trump talks like a 7 yr old learning to Read. Trump has serious problems or he would release his medical record done by an independent Doctor. Not one bought and paid for like he did with bone spurs.
It was Trump Dr. Who suggested he take the Cognitive test. That's scary. Walk down a ramp will you. Try holding on to the rail. Don't worry about Biden showing up. Worry about Trump showing up. Can't wait for Biden to challenge Trump to a push-up test. Bets ?.Hit me on Nov 5th.
Did you take the same cognitive test Trump did. Hit me on Nov. 5th.
Just wondering how many times Trump played catch or played any sport with his sons, daughters, grandchildren instead of playing golf by himself or with others. We know Biden played &amp; coach his kids.
When trump wins,how do we redo the whole government. So many dirty operators in deep state.DOJ IS biggest threat to society.
If President Trump is at Yankee Stadium, and the Yankees bend the knee, someone should start a rumor they're actually bending their knee to President Trump.
I'm rocking with Rigby on this one.   Good boy   *boops nose*   Trump sucks but can't we enjoy a video of an overweight trailer park woman getting aroused by McDonald's pancakes in peace?
Donald Trump under tremendous pressure was forced to cancel the GOP convention.  Many Republicans were simply not planning on attending because of the pandemic but others are ashamed of what the party has become.  Donald Trump has destroyed and repurposed the GOP into a cult!
Chachi thinks it‚Äôs because he supports Trump that no one hires him to act? That‚Äôs hilarious!!!
I am waiting for the next Kent State fiasco. Not that I want to see that happen. Just saying- Under Trump "shit happens" all bad.
The only puppet master is Putin who has Trump on a several strings. Middle Class Trump gave billions in tax breaks to the wealthy who will never give to the middle class.
As long as Trump is making self inflicted wounds with Unforced errors why would you rock the boat.
These Evangelical Women Are Abandoning Trump and the Church | by Sarah Stankorb | Jul, 2020 | GEN
Why doesn‚Äôt Trump just get rid of state and local governments and just run everything himself?
Still won't matter. We are staring at worst than Depression number. People just will tune in to see the Trump cicus.
No I hope there is debates it won't change anything.Trump will call names, talk about Biden son, Obama, &amp; how bad they were with no facts. Biden will present facts &amp; his vision for the country. If anyone drops it will be Trump.Biden as VP has a record to run on-Trump not much.
It was not mindless prattle? Everything I said was a fact. Trump is a Russian puppet. He bows down and writes love letters to our enemies.The world does not repect us.The virus is Trump virus. It has happen on his watch.We lead the world in deaths because his poor performance
Trump will send in the DHS stormtroopers.
What a circus at the White House. Trump admin $21M gambit for Pepcid as a COVID remedy fizzles (from
What idiot running for Potus would go on TV and talk about a cognitive test you took because someone close to  you was concerned about your mental state..That would be Trump.
Biden can tie his shoes.Trump can't. Biden knows the difference between North America and South America Trump don't.
We need to know when did Trump take that cognitive test. He needs to retake and the results released to the public along with his annual exam.
We would still like to know, where, when &amp; what part of Khashoggi murder you knew about? How deeply were you &amp; Trump involved? You are hiding the truth. Truth will set you free.
China is where it started. Trump late &amp; irresponsible reaction to Pandemics-like firing the entire pandemic response team in 2018.Then firing Bao Ping Zhu American medical Epidemiologist embedded in chinese health system for early detection of disease last July.Poor Judgement.
I guess he‚Äôs trying to get his poll numbers up. Good luck with that. Trump deploys more federal agents under 'law and order' push (from
That should tell you how bad Trump is. I don't need to watch Biden or Trump. My mind is already made up, as is 67 Percent of this country.
Debates don't matter at this time. Trump has lost the trust of the Amerocan people. He done. Besides Hilliary won all 3 debates against Trump, but lost a lot of peoples trust at a key point in time.
Obama/Biden created over 12 million jobs while in office. Trump/Pence loss 22 million jobs and climbing.
Can the House have Trump's doctor, Ronny Jackson, publicly testify immediately about the president's mental state? What are they waiting for???
Biden: Trump Shouldn‚Äôt Blame China For The Virus, People Can‚Äôt Make The Distinction ‚Äòbetween a South Korean and someone from Beijing‚Äô
Instead of a debate, can we just have Trump and Biden take a cognitive test live on TV?
This IS Donald Trump's America. #fixedit
He should have taken over for Trump on the Apprentice four years ago.  It could have been the first comedy reality TV.
Maybe that's where Trump found "Sleepy Joe".
It's the last argument of a small mind.  When they can't contest the facts, they go for the Nazi card, or the race card, or whatever offensive Joker card they might be holding in their hand, thinking they have the Trump card.
There is no way anyone who voted for your dad is going to vote for Joe Biden.  The people from 2016 voted for Donald Trump specifically because of politicians like 47-years-in-politics Joe.
GOP congressman: Trump‚Äôs Ghislaine Maxwell comments were ‚Äòunacceptably obtuse‚Äô  via   Chip Roy looks like Hannibal Lector in Silence of the Lambs. Its those type of characters - bald monster gnomes skinheads who always hated me says I am Ghislaine.
GOP lawmaker condemns Trump remarks on Maxwell   Rep. Chip Roy (R-Texas) - Texas is Bush country &amp; they are gang stalkers &amp; torturers who are stupid and jealous so they just do anything they want to those they detest because of hatred, jealousy, stupidity.
GOP lawmaker condemns Trump remarks on Maxwell   I am quite sure the media &amp; GOP lawmakers also make me out to be Ghislaine Maxwell.  I did no sexual wrongs or terrorism or anything but they heap nasty things on me as that is what targeted individuals get
Trump is out. He used to send me emails, 'They hate you Uma'. Now he is the one torturing me.
America once had a voice and standing at the world table but Donald Trump killed the American spirit by replacing constitution law with partisan cronyism. His swamp because our cesspool.  Buried in rotten corruption he failed America. He accentuated the worst of us! He divided us
Biden says Trump is first racist U.S. president   And he is using torture to hurt those who he thinks are enemies when we are the ones who supported him. Never had such pain before in my neck ever. No one helps me from excruciating pain. No more Trumps.
Today I can say without a doubt America is toxic and is falling apart. Donald Trump has torn a struggling nation apart.  He has with incompetence and egotistical motives divided our nation.  We are the divided house which can‚Äôt stand.  We have lost our way in Trump Darknes
Liberal states listen to liberal politics, when they blame trump the state listens.  They dont want to take responsibility for things that have happened and people keep voting the same way.  SF is a shit hole man, I go there every year and it makes no sense to me why they keep
And manage their response as well as supplies.  The federal government is there for backup, have you seen Cuomo and Newsome praising trump for getting them the supplies they needed?  Cuomo put COVID positive patients in nursing homes for God's sake.  The group at the highest risk
They get more money for COVID positive patients and hospitalizations.  If you haven't learned by now, everything is Donald Trump's fault.  These states are deflecting their terrible governing and blaming DT for all of these deaths. The reality is it's up to the state to organize
Including the Corona virus.  This is just another way the media likes to blame Trump for "Breaking constitutional rights" when he's protecting the livelihood of innocent citizens who dont deserve this havoc in their city.  Local government spawned this beast, let the feds fix it
Trump you should have thought about that when you fired the entire Pandemic response team.
Looking for another Kent State. Something is bound to go wrong. Everything Trump touches turn to shit.
Trump would love to start any war. He is desperate. He don't want to be Potus anymore &amp; he don't want to go to jail.
What has the Democrats done to help?  I can tell you, nothing! And you can‚Äôt stop Trump Lightfoot your a disgrace. Your hate for Trump is more important to you than the safety of the people.
Bye Trump.
Sex abuse of any lady white or colored, us wrong.Federal govt sexually abuses brown and black ladies. I want Trump govt, gone for good.
Trump does not read.books or study and does not like brown or black ladies being educated having degrees being moral as we were raised in our families.I get very dirty dreams of being sexually assaulted recently and it's done by bad men , women under Trump.We don't need them
Vote for educatiion, schools opening as normal notbe forced to stay home alone together for sex abuse by Trump and other bad men and his girls showing off as good women while we non white girls are dirsrobed treated as slaves sexually abused usingan immorality  federal govt

The sad thing you are so blind and deceived you would justify Donald Trump shooting someone on Fifth Avenue.  Donald Trump will let you and me die for his own gain. He will put your life in danger in a heartbeat!  Your support is not enough as millions are sick and dying today
Is there any logical reason why everyone in the media thinks Joe Biden is going to win? I will admit I have been disappointed with some things Trump has done and said, and his style is definitely not my own.  But Joe Biden? Has the media totally lost it?
The truth is Donald Trump and his administration will destroy all relations with China.  The Tariffs, blame for the pandemic, and the closure of the Chinese consulate in Houston will warrant retaliation and could hurt our people.  The Trump administration are fake world bullies!
One of his Repug goones from Indiana was ask - what do you think about Trump rhetoric of  about wishing MAXWELL well. He said he would not have use those words. How about not saying anything. !!!!
Why don't Johnson Wisc. Nunes Calif investigate or ask their Russian friends about the bounty on our Troops. Instead of trying to prove a guility Trump was not guility.

Trump should just dump all Bush people.When you have a known enemy in DC,not a good idea to keep them around.Donald Trump should be charged with the murder of over 150,000 individuals!

I think that "silent majority" isn't going to let trump continue this nightmare
This silent majority stuff cracks me up.  Every time I hear trump say it I think soooo you mean the unenthusiastic people that are not verbally supporting you will appear on Election Day to vote for trump.  Interesting are they embarrassed thus their silence?
If you can go to a store you can vote in person, cause mail in vote will be a disaster and create another excuse for democrats to say trump cheated not all votes where counted or they got lost in the mail
No denying that.  But they want Trump out and we need all the help we can get.  After Election Day, we can go back to being adversaries.
This is why Trump very well might win in Nov.  This country is overwhelmed with racists.
Are you serious? Why would anyone work under the Trump administration. Y'all are unAmerican.
First of all, because they couldn‚Äôt. That power lies with Congress; and, second there absolutely was nor is there any need. I wouldn‚Äôt risk COVID19 for a  tRump rally but I‚Äôll risk it all to vote!
Ooops...he tweeted about delaying the election... Trump, not Biden. Just this morning. Go ahead defend that too. You know you want to.
#TrumpDepression setting in.  We either die from COVID-19, or survive and lose our healthcare to fight it, lose our jobs and default on mortgages. So we live in pain in the streets.  Sounds like a Fred Trump legacy.

Trump+1 and by a plurality(MO-02). Not a lot of Biden energy, but there‚Äôs definitely been a huge drop off in Trump support here

So so true re Fox, but if you look at the clip, at least up to 2017-cause that‚Äôs as far as I cloud watch, it was All cable media outlets. Plus chuck todd just spouted the same nonsense late last week when tRump feigned appreciation for mask wearing. Sooo, there‚Äôs that...
My point is solely about a broadcaster  who softballs his brother who made deadly pandemic decisions. Trump Admin is fair game, yes. But Cuomo is showing his hand here: it‚Äôs politics and favoritism, not truth and journalism.
Why are you surprised? Why do you think Trump is just letting this go wild? Genocide. It's his reelection plan. Get rid of the blacks and browns.
Trump is a lying, racist, rapist, grifter who is also a traitor.
But somehow Trump still manages to mesd them up...while playing golf constantly and an empty schedule
Those agencies work for Trump and he muzzled them.
You‚Äôre certainly correct that Trump was warned in 2019 and ignored it. He also did not implement the Defense production act, he just said he did. He had plenty of time to plan , ramp up prod of reagents, testing and PPE but didn‚Äôt care and still doesn‚Äôt.
And let me add, the bar for Trump is so low it's underground.
Only Rosenstein had ability to fire Mueller. It was between him and Magahn. Trump never ordered Mueller to be fired.   Plus, Did you forget Mueller‚Äôs 3yr investigation report? How it exonerated Trump from any collusion between Russia. Why would he want to fire him?

Trump is a crook
Agreed.  Watching tRump following Secretary Clinton around the stage and yelling out comments as she addressed questions was unseemly and crude.  His fans ate it up and intelligent people were disturbed.  Plus there‚Äôs no fact checks!  Don‚Äôt bother!
your status as relentless promoter of the 2016 tRump campaign is still fresh in my craw. Pleas be carful not to be on the wrong side of this movement! History will not be kind.
Dean I completely agree- you are so so  RIGHT !!  WE MUST VOTE STRAIGHT RED,  TO SAVE AMERICA ITS RED RED  RED ALL THE WAY !! TRUMP  2020 =freedoms!!! L
Can anyone justify white conservative Preachers still supporting the policies and practices of the Trump administration?

JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU
Right there with ya brother. They are so afraid off Trump they are trying to destroy the country. He needs more time and they still are probably gonna fight him.
Yeah you are 1 of the uneducated people. Of course the debt went up, when liberals brought Covid here and shut the economy down. Trump had to send out $2T in stimulus + the ppp program. Get your facts straight
Photoshopped! Fake news like everything else against Trump
Remember, all patriots to register as republican and vote Trump. The stake of this country depends on it. Biden will be a puppet for more competent elites. Don‚Äôt do mail in ballots if you can manage. Never know who is on the receiving end and could change your vote.
It‚Äôs property.   No way justifies thug tactics by militias in streets.  This is what Trump wants.
‚Äú... they‚Äôre undersampling Republicans by 9 points in that poll,..‚Äù  ‚Äúthey‚Äôre designed to create headlines, and they are actively trying to suppress the enthusiasm of President Trump‚Äôs voters,..‚Äù  Good read on what is really going on with polling..üëá

You know, at this point, it's easier to list Trump's successes: ... ... Yep, much easer!  #PersonWomanManCameraTV
Lets just hope that Trump doesn't put his stormtroopers in front of the only polling places open on election day.
Grow the hell up!  Unless you‚Äôre being paid by the Republicans to throw the election to tRump!
Politico never gets anything to do with Trump correct!  TRUMP 2020
Ha, ALL the ad people are GOP Operative, the real extreme GOP'ers and when they say they won't fact check political ads, they mean TRUMP ads. They always take down other peoples ads. Zuckerberg is a white supremacist.
You meant Trump
I love President Trump!
Trump is brilliant and helps the African American community.
Trump will save this nation!
Really I am fine with Trump golfing 24/7 works for me as long as Pence caddies.
Well Brett really dressed up for the occasion lol.  Trump is just gross the neck the leaking tits, his belt too big and that damn thumb I want to chop off he makes me ü§Æ
Actually no.  Trump is a tall guy.  I can give him that one.
In Trump‚Äôs America there are no rules.
It‚Äôd make a whole lot of sense if Trump has been taking the advice of Robert E Lee‚Äôs ghost
I feel like scamming trump supporters üôà
Now do Trump
Wanna get involved in a campaign, look to your hometown team.  is running a helluva race against old AF  - the guy who is helping Trump keep confederate names on bases.
I think the left will try and burn this country down whether Trump wins or not!  We all need to stand up and take our country back !!  #MAGA2020 ‚ù§Ô∏èü§çüíôüá∫üá∏
And very short sighted thinking. I teethed on politics literally, going door to door as a kid for my dad‚Äôs friends. I‚Äôve been on both sides. First election was JFK, a Goldwater girl, Bushes,finally Obama.  Debates &amp; ideas were fun. The Trump years have been idiotic chaos.
How are you the head of Trump Diversity Coalition and you call it the China Virus?  You are racist. #CancelTrump #TrumpDiversityCoalitionIsAJoke

We used to be before trump.
Not stupid!  Beliefs change and morph!  We all grow and change with the times of our lives!  Trump needed to deal with Democratic Unions to build in NYC.  The Democrats were the Union criminals, the KKK, The Jim Crow, and so much more racism! Read history!
he doesn‚Äôt care about Floridians... he only wants to make trump happy... #CountryOverParty üá∫üá∏üíôüá∫üá∏üíô
What if Trump beat her ass  ? You‚Äôd probably complain
Not all trump supports are racists but by far most white supremacists are Trump supporters.  There is a reason for this.  Also trump supports are totally willing to overlook that for other agendas.  Honesty would be saying it doesn‚Äôt affect me so IDC.
You know tRump would never have agreed to throw out the first pitch if there were crowds in the stands. He‚Äôs a coward. And I can‚Äôt believe  are allowing this racist, coward on their field. So disappointing.
Look to the Portland Dad Pods (play on Dad Bods) supporting the Wall of Moms with their leaf blowers (to blow back the tear gas) and tennis rackets (to hit back the canisters or whatever thrown at them by Trump‚Äôs Trrops). Bravo to my hometown!
Nope. You are so wrong. Bless your heart. Not propaganda. I personally know some of those participating in the Wall of Moms. Not paid. Now, let‚Äôs talk about the members of Trump‚Äôs Troops who do not wear name tags, ID, organization ID , etc., and are tear gassing these brave moms.
increasing  Black male vote?  How?  Black female vote?  You‚Äôre not explaining how Trump‚Äôs racist policies help people of color.  How is your Coalition encouraging diversity of ALL POC?  &amp; to call Covid China virus is OFFENSIVE.  #CancelTrump #AMJoy
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
And also, all those Trump voter stories and nary a one on the disappointed Clinton supporters.  They knew we were out of here; we showed up at marches right away.
Then you know normal aging means word funding is a little harder they are 4 years apart Biden has morals and character Trump does not even know what that means
So you apologize publicly.? Makes no sense. Like Trump lay off Twitter

God, Cocaine, Money and Forgetting: A Look at Donald Trump's New Economic Adviser
‚ÄúSpeaking on the condition of anonymity, however, senior Republican officials express exasperation that the president in their view mishandled the virus, leaving the party vulnerable to not only losing the White House but the Senate as well.‚Äù
How and why is this even a question?  Is it to place the idea of Trump defeat in the mind of the public?  They did this same thing back in 2016.
Yes Trump 2020 all the way
Dude I mean actual dementia not the fact that Trump is ‚Äúorange‚Äù as you party walker lemmings say
President Trump and republicans will always protect those with pre-existing conditions! And without help from the congress, will lower prescription drug prices for those who need them! Big moves president Trump!!
‚ÄúShe (Meghan Markle) likened tabloid criticism to ‚Äúdeath by a thousand cuts.‚Äù  I wonder if either of these two spoiled brats can imagine a day in the life of the Trump family.
Trump and his egregious family
Melanoma is a trump,devoid of emotion.
He ALWAYS says he's out when things get a little hot. He WANTS you to think he's out. He WILL keep writing checks, through dark money groups. Mercer IS funding this. So is Thiel. SAYS he's out but he's spending money on Trump. Dark. Money. Watch what they do, not what they say.
Wowza...despite all of Trump's baby tantrum, NC was working with the RNC to get them the best convention they could under the circumstances. Oh, well. Sorry you lost all your money.

Please. No one wants any of that (except the "defeat Trump" part).
Trump looks like the one who wants a total and complete national shutdown, given his actions/inaction.
Hey Donald "The Mask" Trump, where's your mask???
Who gives a fuck?  He gave it a shot.  The man‚Äôs ego isn‚Äôt the size of the moon like Trump‚Äôs.    It was more important to him to be seen on National TV representing logic and science and wearing a mask.
Trump is really upset about Paw Patrol

The Clinton comparison is terrible. Clinton‚Äôs impeachable acts concerned personal behavior that did not touch on his official duties. Trump‚Äôs impeachable offenses directly concerned his official duties and his oath of office.
If you want to vote by mail, please, please consider taking it directly to your election board drop box in person. I know you should not have to, but do it if you can. I have vision of Trump loving mailman dumping crates of votes from big cities into a dumpster.
