Miss you Shin!  Biden 2020
Carolyn, you want to read this. It is a transcript from Faux News. Hannity and tRump. Now tell me that tRump I‚Äôd more mentally fit than Biden.
Buy some unbelievable horrific Cosmic storm allows Joe Biden become president I would like to have 15 days in the pool before they have benched him. I'm good for the money just make sure my name's got the 15 days
Sure. In 2035, Biden will be (if he‚Äôs still around) will be 93. It doesn‚Äôt change the fact that 100% is a moronic goal. It seems to me it‚Äôs meant to blame the other side if it‚Äôs not achieved (or objected to), not to take responsibility for its implementation.
Hey dummy.  It appears your blind loyalty to that orangutan in the WH caused you to write a stupid opinion piece trashing Biden.  "Crossed a line"  Well, tRump crossed that line himself today.  Will look for your redaction ASAP.  kthnx
But you are ignoring the fact she hated DC, happy to get away, would never be the #2 under someone like Biden and really just wants to make money without any mess. And we know politics is messy. No way. Even Jarrett said odds were zero
Biden called and said he doesn‚Äôt need that cash money - so you can take that right the fuck outta there.
I bet Biden knows how to spell ‚ÄúDecrepit.‚Äù
Kamala Harris as VP is basically another Joe Biden. They both have the same criticisms in their records but in their policies they both have seemed to have "moved on"(we'll see. One is how Kamala prosecuted 1.5k of marijuana cases but now wants it to be legalized.
Trump shirt Biden under pants
Open ignorance is often a blessing in disguise. I just made that up but I kinda believe it! Let them have a microphone, once in a while, to show their ignorance. Look how well Biden is doing chillin in his man cave!
When you do a pre-write, you write that stuff and then do a quick editing pass to change some of the specifics.  I mean the only reason Politico would have the info and not publish would be if there's a deal w/ the Biden campaign, but there's no reason for them to do so.
Biden is trying to woo centrist Republicans at the expense of me. Barring a retraction, I cannot vote for this man.
We now have a president I can change direction whenever needed Bobby country this is fantastic we are not dead Full Speed Ahead on corruption like we were with Joe Biden Barack Obama Loretta Lynch Sally Yates Susan Rice Eric Holder Jim Clapper John Brennan all treasonous Traders
This is going to have to happen,  otherwise we will have to wait until president Biden is in office to fix it !
Crazy part about this shit is Joe Biden believe that
If Biden can do this then it will probably be the biggest win this country has had in years. I hope this promise is true. Being able to grasp a somewhat liveable minimum wage (its 2.5x the poverty line) will make a vote for him less painful for me.
Keep making America great, you got my vote, my wife is a Democrat but she is voting for you she do not like The Retard Biden.
Somebody tell this young fellow did Joe Biden wants to raise his taxes and take out more that's what he needs to be told
Joe Biden's type of women are subservient
Pervert Biden !
I actually like the merchandise from the Biden campaign. Not overly political
My area is pretty purple, I wear my Biden shirts all the time
There are a lot of baby killers running for office this November vote against all of them including Joe Biden
Sleep soundly because why will change is the next Supreme Court nominee and Biden will pick her.
Yay!!  Someone is joining me in donating to Biden.  That's awesome news Teddy.
Wearing one of my Biden shirts out today
Wearing a Biden shirt today. I‚Äôm not scared to represent
Meanwhile here is Biden lighting the world on fire with his 19 viewer livestream 26 minutes into it.Here is your Biden, take him, he is all yours.
That's the most critical flaw for Trump actually  Presidents aren't Kings. Biden will (actually) surround himself with experienced, great people. Maybe we'll listen to scientists, economists, military leaders, epidemiologists...
Yes, yes you are.  Joe Biden just won the Primary. Not Bernie, Not Elizabeth Warren... The most conservative guy running. Progressive? Yes. Radical Socialist? Google him, that's ridiculous
Either President Pelosi or President Biden is an absolute must for our country.   NO MORE FUHRER TRUMP!!!   #Resist #VoteBlue en masse in numbers #TooBigToRig either #VoteByMail or at the polls on 3 November  #RememberComeNovember
You should actually read this platform. It‚Äôs far better than you realize. And anyway, congress decides what will pass, not Biden. (So probably Bennet‚Äôs Real Deal agenda). Biden‚Äôs going to be a rubber stamp
Texas Voter here. Voting for Biden and MJ Hegar.
I'm sorry, but Biden polling ~3+ in swing states above an insane grifter lying leader of a violent racist death cult is classic US politics. chef's motherfucking kiss my friends
Biden seems to be intentionally not reaching younger folks. Like just being for legalizing marijuana would shore up most young voters
I think joe Biden should start an onlyfans
Can go ahead and let you know that Biden isn‚Äôt that answer. Biden doesn‚Äôt know where he is half the time. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
The making of the ‚ÄúBiden Recession‚Äù
Biden could do things like-after DT answers with word salad or propaganda bullsit, respond by busting out laughing, or just shake his head, saying "Uh, whatever THAT was" and then give a cohesive answer.Or, do the "twirl your finger at side of head" sign for this MF's crazy. Fun!
Don't bother, polls say that Biden will win in landslide anyway. Coronavirus outside, it can kill, scary like hell! Take care and enjoy your life at home with your family, ma'am!
Joe Biden has spent his entire career supporting and promoting women‚Äôs rights. That's why I joined Women For Biden. Join women from across the country as we continue the fight for women's health care, paychecks, safety, and families.
Take the first 40 seconds of this and replace the videos of protests with videos of police brutality and shock troops in Portland and it‚Äôs a great Biden campaign ad
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
"If Joe Biden wins, the teachers' unions would run the Dept of Education."  And... That's a problem?
‚ÄúThere have been a number of racist American presidents, but Trump stands out ‚Äî especially in modern history ‚Äî because he made running on racism and division his calling card and won,‚Äù [Biden aide Symone] Sanders said.Who do you think will be Joe Biden's vice president pick?
The hacks led to bogus tweets being sent out July 15 from the accounts of Barack Obama, Joe Biden, Mike Bloomberg and a number of tech billionaires including Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates and Tesla CEO Elon Musk.
#TheFive  Dems downplayed the virus from the beginning! Biden said 6 things he would do of which ALL 6 are already being DONE! Plus! Thanks for giving credit to the Trump administration, btw. #WalkAway #KAG2020
Is it cool to report somebody who threatens to kill our president? I don't know much about Twitter etiquette . I do know If I would have said it about Joe Biden I would have been kicked off automatically.
The United States of Russia is exactly what you would get if you vote for Biden. God help us!
Why has this not been taken down? If I said that about Joe Biden I would have been gone. Haven't you noticed how terrible people have become? It's scary. I've never seen anything like this In my life. READ THE CONSTITUTION!

Never saw Greta once be a follower of anyone or anyones ideas. Libs just don't like it if someones every words don't agree or support their agenda. I would back Biden against another country's citizen maligning him, and I don't like Biden. #GretaIsTruth
Trump and Biden both suck bigly
This didn't age well. Delete your account or apologize to Joe Biden.
Trump Can‚Äôt Stop the Election, But He Can Threaten Democracy. Evil bastard!!
Hahahah. This didn‚Äôt age well. Looks like another thing Biden was right about
And Biden is going to win?üòÇ
Just ordered my mail ballot to vote Biden 2020!
Then take a stand against the Democratic Party and their racist rhetoric. They are the one‚Äôs responsible for the division in this country.Educate yourself on the polices that a Biden administration wants to implement. The hate for one man isn‚Äôt warranted and us as wrong as racism
The president and Joe Biden both promise sweeping progress -- but through very different paths
People applaud Joe Biden when he talks about raising our taxes. Crazy huh?
Now I want this to happen just so I can get the headline that says "Joe Biden beaten to death by Kamala Harris."
Warren, Harris, Abrams, Rice.... you know what all of them have in common? They beat the everlasting piss out of Pence sitting in a chair one rage aneurism away from the presidency. Whoever he chooses I‚Äôm voting for Biden. I want no part of the Handmaiden‚Äôs Tale Pence America!!!
Biden expected to choose running mate next week
Joe Biden telling everyone he's gonna get those anarchists is just so...on brand.
Will you be in the Biden administration? I hope.
He's promising to invest in Black-owned small businesses and encourage homeownership while closing wealth gaps among minority communities
Joe Biden's campaign managers testified before AG Bill Barr today
Shut up Biden!!! Isn‚Äôt time for your afternoon NAP???? You idiot.
It‚Äôs not Bernie‚Äôs personal email list though. He made it clear he wasn‚Äôt handing it over. I got an email yesterday from Bernie asking me to vote for people and Biden‚Äôs name was nowhere to be seen ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Ex-Sanders Campaign Chair: Voting for Biden Is Comparable to Eating a ‚ÄòBowl of Sh*t‚Äô
‚Äú77% of moderate conservatives are afraid to share their political views‚Äù - this explains why the polls are wrong that are showing Biden being up. Also shows how many of us are sniveling cowards with no courage to stand up for what they believe in! üò†üíîüá∫üá∏

I think that early exchange about race was actually very good for Biden in the long run. It left a mark at the time, but I think he grew from it.
The poll finds Biden's supporters are less enthusiastic than Trump's, although the Democrat's coalition may be equally motivated by anxiety.
This was the piece that got political Twitter all up in arms üôÑ
The poll finds that Biden's supporters are less enthusiastic than Trump's ‚Äî both about the campaign itself and about their candidate

Well Pete went all greatest hits during his spot during the Biden even and I just saw this in my feed... That's me, telling Pete he's always the most prepared person in every situation... And I am absolutely ruined üò¢üò≠
Ok, y‚Äôall who are voting for Biden, why should I? Literally the only reasons I can think is he‚Äôs not Trump and he will probably nominate a liberal justice to replace Ginsburg. Both of those are important to me, but not important enough to win my vote over the Green Party.
I reported all 20 of the tweets about her. Twitter never cares though.
Oh yea...Biden all the way!
I would LOVE to vote for Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. üíú
No I üíØ Warren. She‚Äôs a tough lady. I don‚Äôt know. I see her as a Secretary of State. I think Biden will stick to his promise. His pick will be a woman of color.
Here‚Äôs a touch of why I think #KamalaHarris is a bad choice for Biden‚Äôs VP.
We don‚Äôt have time for any mistakes. Biden‚Äôs VP has to have literally NO skeletons in their closet. Harris has enough for a grave yard. She can be on his cabinet. Just not his VP.
He's lying. He took sides and now he's claiming he has no idea what Biden Brigade did.
He doesn't want  to turn on him
So when your dad beats up your mom, you consider that "my parents fighting" - very interesting
So he‚Äôs supporting Biden?
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
For example, every day the Monday afternoon quarterbacks in the liberal media fault him for not responding fast enough to the threat of COVID-19. #rrdailyherald #opinion #Reagan
So I have this idea of how politics could work! Biden adopts some of the progressive platform of Bernie, and people who like that might give Biden money! I know, fucking earth shattering right!
"If Joe Biden wins, the teachers‚Äô unions would run the Dept of Education."   if I've ever seen it.   Biden should run this tweet as a campaign ad.
How about that Biden sponsored 92' Crime Bill ? What ? that doesn't count against him ? He's a total hypocrite, liar.
Not surprising. The smart people are no longer in the GOP. They have all sided with the country and the Constitution and are working to elect Biden.
Now interview Biden
Whatever happened to that girl that accused Joe Biden? We don't see much of her Do we?

Honestly this dinner and a show, Trump is literately making life easy for Biden
The 15-minute video, posted online Thursday, is the latest maneuver to get the former president involved in the 2020 campaign for his former vice president.
How many more times are you going to use the term 'optical rectitis'? We get it, you don't like her or her attitude.  Who honestly gives a flying monkey what you think? I think she's great. More pressing, however, is your attitude while repping Joe Biden in your profile pic.
Create this ads, Covid-19 were approved by Previous admin &amp; ChinaCDC2011, Covid-19 was existed 2013 - Then was walked by Previous Admin. Recently I heard, being President you need to have responsible-Obama vs Biden, where was the responsible when walked out rather than distroyed
As I've said consistently on this platform, if Biden includes some progressive policies in his formal platform, he will earn my vote, and those of many others. If you don't support the left wing of your party at all, you can't demand they support the center, sorry.
You realize Biden hasn't said a word about it, right? You go ahead and put your eggs in that basket.
People thinking Biden wouldn't have done what Trump is doing in Portland obviously have conveniently forgotten "Occupy Wall St".
I have thought the same thing from the start, and hope m wrong too! James Woods Makes Prediction On Who Joe Biden Will Pick For Vice President And It's Not Good
‚ÄúI couldn‚Äôt be prouder of what we got done,‚Äù the former president said
This statement alone reveals that Biden is both clueless, and a liar.Allies say Karen Bass's reputation as a bridge-builder would make her a strong partner to presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden.
But fewer people say the U.S. is on the right track. Plus, how we feel about the future of our jobs and the coronavirus threat. Explore the mood of the country in 8 charts.
I think a wide majority of swing state voters largely side against the protesters at this point. However, Trump certainly has enough mistakes to go around and those may be enough to put Biden over the top. The debates will also be pivotal IMO.
Chris  Sooo how mach $$$ is the DNC paying you???  Like soft balling the fact that Biden is not capable  Of an interview??  You are such a ______ Fill in the blank!
Biden is not a socialist, if he was I‚Äôd actually be eager to vote for him. But on the subject, how is racism and communism equally evil? Actually do you even know what communism is? MLK jr. was considered a communist so are you saying you wouldn‚Äôt support him????
And you think Biden is a good choice? Please enlighten the masses as to the wonderful goals and past achievements of Biden...
Last I checked it's at 7!

Great activist? Maybe. But he let the district he ran go to hell, didn‚Äôt do much for the people who lived there. Took huge donations even when he ran unopposed and supported people like Biden when he railed against desegregation and busing .
I‚Äôm confused. I thought liberals LOVED taxing the rich. Biden said his economic plan would be paid for in part by taxing the WEALTHY.
I Been With Joe Biden From Day 1,üíô
Who every Joe Biden pick as V,P they have to be vetted they back ground has to be good No Dirty that will hurt the election.
Uncontrolled pandemic, rogue Federal agents, unemployment and no health insurance , violence by white supremacists.. In Biden's America the main cause of all of this will be in prison.
Let's Not Forget Rep John Lewis Said Keep Your Eyes On The Ball!! Republicans party  and  have received FAKE Documents from UK. The Trump Campaign and Gop what's to Smear Joe Biden.  Keep your Eyes On The Ball. #TrumpResignNow
I've seen alot of videos of people who voted for him in 16 who will be voting for Biden now. People with intelligence who admit they made a mistake. But the far right, kool aid drinking, mask throwing racist mfers won't leave his side.
I've been going back and forth these last few days between Kamala and Susan Rice,although I believe Rice would be a better fit For Biden.She has a lot of baggage and her pick would be going back in the past.Kamala is the safer pick.
Choosing only from candidates of one gender is #sexist. Joe Biden has a long history of supporting America‚Äôs #fascist policies &amp; is no friend of the left. He supports the wanton slaughter of #black children through his steadfast support of the racist Planned Parenthood org.
If Biden don't pick Kamala Harris now the backlash will be brutal.I've been following politics for 40 years and I have never seen a potential VP pick being torn apart by there on party like this.
Biden has accomplished basically zip in his four plus decades as a politician. Really don‚Äôt want a guy as POTUS who can barely speak coherently at times.
"The survey, it‚Äôs worth noting, was conducted July 28 to 30, mostly before Trump‚Äôs tweet about delaying the election. If anything, these gaps will likely widen in the wake of his incendiary suggestion." Which is EXACTLY why he made it.
This is NOT Biden's America ..
Actually, it was Biden who suggested using the military in such an event.
Let's keep our eye on the ball Trump and Republicans party trying to do play book 2016 watch Ron Johnson and Lindsey Graham. They trying to smear Joe Biden.
botted tweets really expose the fact that there are idiotically defensive assholes supporting both sides üòÇ ever Trump tweet that gets oWo-ed triggers a bunch of Trumpers and every Biden tweet that gets oWo-ed triggers a bunch of Dems üòÇüòÇ
who else will they vote for that actually has a chance though? then we‚Äôre stuck with donald for 4 more years because we‚Äôre divided on our vote while he has a solid base. I don‚Äôt see how it does any good to not vote biden. Trust me, I don‚Äôt like Joe but we need donald out
You evidently know nothing about Biden. Just listening to him speak is proof he has a cognitive issue. Do a little research before calling just one of them terrible.
This is the unfortunate truth Biden folks, #resistance folks, #KHive trolls, blue wavers will not understand. Even if Trump loses, people will suffer and we'll still face the constant fear of getting sick and having no medical insurance because Joe will not enact #MedicareForAll
The only thing Republican lite Democrats care about is taking control for 4 more years to replace RBG and stopping SCOTUS turn even more far to the right. By that time, people will die needlessly and families will face financial ruin as Joe Biden does little to help us.
What's depressing is conservative Democrats are not fighting to make this country a better place to live for those of us struggling in this crisis. Biden has made no promises to uplift and help us as we're facing an eviction crisis and a healthcare crisis. Nothing will change.
It goes to show you how weak Joe Biden is that his minions on Twitter have to comes to his defense because he's such a terrible candidate. Do you think Trump will be as kind as Biden's critics on the left? They're already calling him a socialist, which is laughable.
It's bad enough to having to choose between the two despite the outcome being the same: death by a lack of healthcare access. What's insulting is when Republicans disguised as Democrats tell me I can't tell the truth about Joe Biden because it'll help Trump.
The cold hard truth conservative Democrats are refusing to admit is even if Biden wins there's still going to be suffering under his administration. All they have is "damage reduction", but what they don't say is hundreds and thousands more will die all in order replace RBG.
Show me a tweet about Biden that I originated?
I'm absolutely terrified they will especially if Biden's VP pic isn't to the liking of everyone. I have my VP preferences but whoever he pics I'll still be voting for him. No matter what Trump is exponentially worse than anyone Biden can pic.
I am new to the KHive, so please excuse me if I ask a stupid question. Why do they continue disruptive behavior if we are supposed to be on the same side? After these last 3 1/2 years, you'd think they would work w/the best team to win (Biden/Harris).
This is why I am VOTING for you VP Biden‚úùÔ∏èüôèüèæ
Adam Green telling a Muslim woman to stop talking about how much of a racist Joe Biden is peak corporate Democrat to a T.
Eid Mubarak! After Trump cages our children Biden will deport them while House Democrats votes on a bill to give them airplane tickets.
Followed the advice of Biden in his January 29th op ed to start.
You know, it's sad: that sentence right there might have been enough to convince me to vote for Biden, were I a citizen. That's how low his opponent has set the bar.
'the polls were off In 2016.' yeah no, michigan and pennsylvania were both within the margin of error. Wisconsin was the only state off. Biden now doubles Hillary's lead compared to this time 2016, ESP in the rust belt, and Biden leads in almost every swing and even TEXAS
And as far as I'm concerned, the American people will suffer no matter who wins, and there's no amount of shamming coming from you that will change that unfortunate reality. Biden or Trump, people will die from a lack of healthcare access.
Biden said he would veto Medicare For All and the DNC has voted down any measures of enacting a single payer healthcare systems, along with many other progressive and popular ideas that were rejected. That's not the fault of someone critiquing that insanity. That's on Biden.
Oh, so it's her fault that Biden is looking less electable because of his inadequate policy proposals and not Biden himself? It's because of her criticism and not because Biden has said time and time again he doesn't care about our needs in this crisis we're in right now?
This is the same face we're all making knowing Joe Biden will never fight for #MedicareForAll.
Then why are you on her case when she says Joe Biden will increase our premiums? She's not helping Trump when she points out Joe Biden doesn't plan on doing anything about our healthcare system even in the middle of a pandemic.
That's not her job to make Joe Biden less shitty. It's on Joe Biden himself.
We're not allowed to say Joe Biden's healthcare policy, or lack of, is not sustainable given that we're in a pandemic? Are we not allowed to demand better from the presumptive nominee?
This is who Joe Biden and Kamala Harris attracts. I'll be damned if this is who we have to unite with in order to defeat Trump. A bunch of bitter, hateful, self-absorbed trolls that don't think we're actual people. We don't matter to them. They sound just like Republicans.
Will Biden even make it until then?  His feebleness and addled demeanor is clearly quickly increasing.  The question is, who would really be president IF he is elected?
The truth to them is like God's Word is to demons. They don't want exposure or to answer for their crimes against America &amp; its people. Trump didn't play their game &amp; refused to be their puppet. Dems won't tolerate this &amp; Joe Biden is willing to be their puppet.
Are u a Biden fan or Bernie ?
Yeah, sure. Whatever you say loser. The only BIG thing happening now is the amount of losing that you're doing to Joe Biden.  Hold the L jackass.
Fucken pc of shit!! Vote please biden 2020
A whole 247 watching Biden!! Wow!
Maybe trump should be secluded (detained?) during the election results until Biden emerges as the clear winner...
I think it's going to be  because we don't see her anywhere and Kamala is all over the place.I just have this feeling that Biden is going to throw us a curve ball.
Yes, I know Olsen denounces Trump today and acknowledges that he criticized Biden - but he never actually apologizes to Biden.
It‚Äôs so obvious Obama is just itching to go to war with Trump while on the campaign trail for Biden, and I am here for ALL of it. üòé #ObamaEulogy
Both candidates are unable to campaign openly so I'm sure that Biden might consider... unless it's ok with him since he's stuck in the basement....
It's Evident Biden Is Confused But Real Americans Are Not. We Dont Want A Demented Socialist Racist Running Our Nation. Socialism Doesn't Work For The People It Enslaves Them. Keep America Free, Keep Trump!üá∫üá∏
But you won't vote because Biden and Trump are the same?  Isn't this how we got Trump 4 years ago? Are you better off now than you were 4 years ago?  Explain to me this smart dumb shit of not voting for the lesser of two evils lol.

Biden's moderation? Biden is in no condition to run his administration, is captive to the extreme left, and is about to announce a nightmare (from a "conservative" perspective) running mate, who may well finish his term. Will is suffering from TDS.
How come no one is asking if Biden would accept Trumps win?
Is Biden still announcing his VP pick before August (this Saturday)? Or did I make that up in my head?
Omg!! WTf‚Äô trump wants to moved the election from November because biden is kicking his butt!! Let‚Äôs be clear HE HAS NOT AUTHORIZED to moved shit ! clear is that only the states and Congress have the power to delay that part of the election process! Facts! Vote this monster out
A wonderful idea ! Voting is sooo yesterday.  People nobody wanted could be elected. So why don't you just skip the expansive and fraudulent process and declare Joe Biden to be the next president !!  The pandemic will end, the economy will grow and everyone is happy again.

We often focus too much on how the candidates are different.   Both  and  give full support to nuclear.   They just whisper about it instead of yelling it from the rooftops.   That‚Äôs my job!!   #GreenNuclearDeal
Hey ADOS I was just wondering has Joe Biden ever addressed black abuse and injustice this head on?
Lilly, I was stuck a couple months ago. Download an app called "Unfollow Today". It lets you easily see and unfollow people who aren't following you. If you have questions, feel free to DM me.
No. That is not an acceptable answer. Not everyone can wait to 2024 for the perfect choice. Biden wasn't even my 3rd pick, but he offers a chance to step back from the edge.
Hey comotose Joe Biden, don't forget to send your wife flowers for Valentine's day..
We don't need Biden's Socialist Party. He's got 30 years in politics &amp; 8 years with Obama but only managed to make life in the USA worse. Now he &amp; the rest of Satan's soldiers want to dismantle everything Americans have built. No God, No Morals &amp; No Freedom.  TRUMP 2020üá∫üá∏
But he says Biden is unfit because he mistakenly said Arizona is a city.
at this point, Biden is the ONLY chance this country has ..
Thank you, stranger lady at lunch who decided to give me her unsolicited opinion on ‚ÄúBiden‚Äôs socialist America.‚Äù I needed a laugh today.
why don't the Democrat just run an ad:.  Don't want  riots and looting?  Vote for Biden,. If you elect Trump we will continue to allow root and looting.
You sound like Biden at a press conference
the decision not to vote for Biden isn't really one that I'm making for myself, it's one that was made on my behalf by right-wing democrats when they decided to torpedo the Sanders campaign on Super Tuesday
I volunteer too!  needs ppl to put out signs for Biden in August if you want to check it out!
cool you explained 1 of them away, but for every gaf trump has Biden has 10
At least he isn‚Äôt afraid to be interviewed like Biden. Dude feels pressure and melts like an icicle in August.
Bruh i ain't gonna let biden near my little sister why would i let him near the white house again.
Can't understand if comotose Joe Biden is Soo great, why didn't he do anything for 47 years???
‚Äúbiden wasn‚Äôt my first choice either, but not voting for him because it makes you ‚Äòfeel better‚Äô endangers people who aren‚Äôt as privileged as you‚Äù
And what people may overlook is that she was on President Obama pandemic response team,to go with all her other qualifications.If I was Biden I would pick her over Kamala Harris.
Joe Biden says he'll announce vice president pick in first week of August
I snuck in tooüòâ
If Joe Biden runs with Kamala, then y‚Äôall have fun with trump cuz I‚Äôm not voting
What was the point of Bernie‚Äôs ‚Äútask force‚Äù if it lead to nothing but the Biden team humiliating them?
I personally would vote for Biden regardless of who he picks but the way his campaign been dangling black women at the top of the list,if he doesn't choose a black woman there may be a serious backlash.Some black women may not work hard for him to get elected
Who do you think should be the next president? ‚Äî Joe Biden üíØü§ûü§û
Soooo if Joe Biden bows out of Office, the VP moves up (Harris) to POTUS and Nancy Pelosi is VP?!? Say it ain't so bruh?
What what what what what what you actually think Biden knows what he said?
This is my brother in rural Ga. This sounds exactly like what he‚Äôs been saying recently. I‚Äôve been gobsmacked to hear him speak like this about black people. And he‚Äôs VERY unhappy that Biden spoke at Flyod‚Äôs funeral. But he is absolutely NOT voting for Trump.
‚ÄòDo not hold grudges‚Äô against Kamala Harris: Biden speech notes caught on camera
Doesn't matter who Biden pick I'm still going to vote for Joe because the alternative is unacceptable.Trump is an embarrassment to the office of the presidency.Just look at his press conferences the dude is a narcissist and insane
Joe Biden‚Äôs notes: ‚ÄòDo not hold grudges‚Äô against Kamala Harris
So your not allowed to passionately express your opinion on an issue that's different from your primary opponent?I am a Biden supporter and I thought the attacks on her were unfair.
The American people who chose to vote in the Democratic primary voted for Biden. He is the Democratic nominee by popular vote.
It doesn't matter which black woman Biden picks the Republicans will find away to attack that VP choice.Kamala is actually the safest pick.We know what the GOP play book will be,Willie Brown that will get old fast.
I‚Äôm not sure who is a bigger badass, AG Barr or Jim Jordan. Today the Dems proved that they don‚Äôt care about this country, they care about their agenda and their re-elections. They are truly laughing stocks with no way forward, and good luck to them with Biden as the Head.
The Biden camp has been dangling a variety of Black women as his VP,with most being on his short list.If he doesn't choose a black woman,his chance of energizing the black vote will be gone.
There is a leak in the Biden camp whose only purpose is to sabotage

joe biden adding a last minute pro-ACS plank to his platform
Here's where we are today, July 28th, 2020.  Imagine where we'll be if Trump doesn't rein-in Fauci and/or Biden wins.
America needs you to answer the call and save our Republic.... Biden/Obama 2020
Joe Biden once said he would be a one term president, so they're looking for a proper candidate the corporate donors will agree with for 2024. That and the current political climate we're in has a lot to do with it.
I'm one of those.   Sure, I had other candidates in mind, but anything is better than #CadetBoneSpurs  and I feel like biden will be very capable of at a MINIMUM undoing a bunch of the illegal bullshit trump did and help pass legislation protecting democracy.
If by indispensable, you mean Whitewasher Barr doesn't prosecute Comey and McCabe for leaking and lying to congress and announces there will be no investigation of Obama and Biden but he does catch the Democrats saying dumb things...sure.
Biden? Out of sight, out of his mind.
You are right.  "Biden shouldn't throw Trump a lifeline by granting him any debates". That's a losing proposition for Biden, and he (well, his handlers) damn well know it. #Trump2020
Barr has always talked a good game.  Meanwhile announced no charges for leaking and lying to congress for Comey and McCabe.  Said no more politics, immediately announced no investigation into Obama and Biden... a purely political announcement.  He's lead whitewasher.
I understand the case conservative Democrats make for voting for Joe Biden is taking back the SCOTUS. I only wish they would also acknowledge that it would cost the lives of hundreds of thousands more who are without healthcare because Joe Biden doesn't believe in #MedicareForAll
As much as you want to convince me a Joe Biden presidency is better than 4 more years of Trump, we'll be stuck in the same situation in terms of healthcare. Both of them want to keep this barbaric system that is tied to our employment as we're seeing record number unemployment.
Either way, we'll be in under great hardships under either Trump or Biden. We'll be without healthcare and god help us if we get sick without insurance during a global pandemic. Neither of them support single payer. We'll suffer greatly.
Barr  Comey and McCabe off for leaking and lying to congress, said no more political DOJ decisions, then promptly announces no investigation of Obama and Biden.  Bill "Business as Usual" Barr writes strongly worded letters and talks big. He's the chief whitewasher.
Absurd.  He let Comey and McCabe off for leaking and lying to congress, said no more political DOJ decisions, then promptly announces no investigation of Obama and Biden.  Bill "Business as Usual" Barr writes strongly worded letters and talks big. He's the chief whitewasher.
I agree wholeheartedly with
If you ever wondered how Comey, Biden, Obama, etc etc broke the law in spygate, this video breaks it down step-by-step. Watch with an open mind.
Sounds like democrats here. Biden would probably be on disability along with schitt for brains and schmucker.
The onky threat Donakd Trump is to them is he is exposing the Demonrats and the corruption perpetrated within our government by the likes of scum like Comey, Stryok, Brennan, Pelosi, Biden, Schumer and Schifty.
Honestly, does Bernie still believe Biden would be the most progressive president since FDR? The guy is against progressive ideas.
I think a lot of her lack of support from the black community was do to the fact that we felt like that Biden was the only one that could beat Trump and we weren't going to waist our vote regardless of the skin color.
And to think Bernie believes Biden would be the most progressive candidate since FDR. It's nothing more than a sick joke.
Exactly what we're going to do! We're going to elect Joe Biden!
She doesn't even speak proper English! She just trying to stir up s***! Biden 2020

Both are vile but Trump is like the boss leader of the disgusting. Biden is nowhere near as horrid as Trump.
What?  All of this burning and rioting is bc of your inability to lead our country. I also think it‚Äôs funny that you use actual footage from events that happened recently in your lastest campaign ad and then said, this is what it will be like if Biden was president. #A$$hat
reporting! Here's me w a #feetinterview on the #streetinterview scene at  chicago    Wonder if she's HRC/BIDEN?
No doubt that Biden is being used but he also is allowing it. He knows what the Socialists are up to. He worked alongside Communist &amp; ISIS sympathizer Obama for 8 years &amp; helped to tear this nation apart. Now he &amp; his army of evil (Satan's Soldiers) plan to finish their work.
I expect nothing from Bill "Business as Usual" Barr, and he's surprised me by exactly how little he's accomplished.  Said, "No more politics at DOJ!"  Followed by, "Obama and Biden won't be investigated"!  Comey and McCabe, no charges for leaking/lying to congress. Perfect score.
Joe Biden is a little scardy cat! He‚Äôs scared to pieces about debates with PRESIDENT TRUMP!!! Hahaha. He‚Äôs a coward!
Bill "Business as Usual" Barr is useless.  He writes stern letters, gives hard-talking speeches, then says, Obama and Biden won't be investigated, Comey and McCabe...no charges for leaking and lying to congress.  These people are useless trough-feeders.
I don't think it's going to be Kamala because of all the VP picks she's the only one that's being seen the most. Biden's about to throw a curveball and pick either Elizabeth Warren or Michigan Governor's Gretchen Whitmer.
Exactly. Pelosi, Schumer, Biden, and the rest of the Clinton-worshipping conservative core of the Democratic party don't care anymore about the American people than the GOP does. The 2 party system is a lie. We live in an oligarchy. Period.
Very nice of Mike Pence to provide this footage for the next Biden ads in Florida.
Jon Meacham on Friday evening warned Democrats that even though former Vice President Joe Biden is leading President Donald Trump by double digits in nearly every poll 100 days before Election Day, a lot of people who will vote ‚Äúfor the incumbent are not going to tell pollsters.‚Äù
Future President Biden paid his respect. Current White House Resident showed he is not due any respect.
Leave Biden alone! Oh wait,  he's not President YET!!
This complete dumb ass.üëáüëá "I will put our citizens back to work." Is in his bio, how are you going to do that when you do not know that Joe Biden was part of the team that took out Osama? The people that you and DeSantis killed will not be getting jobs.

If they push the season back to November we will be good to go for fantasy goodness cuz by then Biden will win and the COVID in the states should then inexplicably go into remission
Vote this trolls out !! Biden 2020!! Please
Joe Biden is going to Reform the police. Not Defund them.    Pass it on.
I hate that I have to vote for Joe ‚ÄúI have a black friend‚Äù Biden
The ideas and policies that Nancy Pelosi and Joe Biden are vehemently opposed to. Like #MedicareForAll for example.
Probably. From what I understand, Joe Biden got the bulk of the VA vote from Northern Virginia, which is close to DC. It's a haven for establishment Democrats. Hell, nearly all of VA is an establishment haven. There's hardly any progressives here, despite being a blue state.
Yeah photo shoots are fun.üòÇ  Biden was kissing that girl in real time. (Not Staged)
To those who are upset about Bernie's delegates doing this, it's called "earning their votes". Last time I checked, this is still a democracy and not a coronation. Biden is not entitled to their votes just because he's the presumptive nominee.
Biden is a disgrace and embarrassment to our country. Worst, most corrupt, treasonous VP ever ü§Æ
And Joe Biden can do better. He can tell us what he is going to do for our Country, which is probably nothing.
Worse, Barr announced no charges for McCabe and Comey for their leaks and lying to congress and no invest of Obama/Biden  Barr says he has full faith in Wray who says he's seen no evidence of bias affected decisions  Wake up  Bill "Business as Usual" Barr leads the whitewash crew
You spelled Joe Biden wrong
Bill Barr made a very political announcement when he said neither Obama nor Biden we‚Äôre going to be investigated.  Barr‚Äôs DOJ publicly announced no charges for Comey and McCabe leaks or lying to Congress.
Revelation of Steele‚Äôs primary source triggers focus on think tank tied to Clinton, Biden
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
I think you should play ‚ÄúIndependence Day‚Äù (American Beauty) at your acceptance rally after you beat Biden in the election. ‚ÄúLet the guilty pay‚Äù
I'm not sure what happened, but there's no doubt in my mind that Biden and his team did what he did here in VA and coalesced the representatives and told their voters their marching orders. They were organized to a fucking T
I live in Virginia and I saw no signs of any ground game here for Biden and yet he won it by wide margins. All he did was gather endorsement from Democratic representatives here and that's all he needed. It taught me a harsh lesson about how politics is played here and I hate it.
I'm going to need the Biden campaign to stop making it so hard to vote for him. Have Chris Dodd sit down. Keep Biden in the basement. Just let Trump make Biden's case for him. The best thing the Biden campaign can do for the next 99 days is just keep quiet.
Maybe, but this is Biden we're talking about. Being tone deaf isn't a bug.
Joe Biden in his basement.
China adores Joe Biden. He's their puppet. They are the puppet masters.
Joe Biden is just a puppet on a string for the Democrats to try to regain power but it‚Äôs not gonna work !!!

My FIL was (just retired) a high income exec and thought putting in the WH was a good idea.   Now he and I think many like him see the disaster and are either 1.  Sitting out (dad) 2.  Voting Biden
The 'silent majority' (üòÖü§£üòÇü§™üñïü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è) are people like my father in law, who thought having s 'business man in the WH' sounded good, and now realize how much of a mistake that was and are now either 1.  Sitting out (dad)  2.  Voting for Biden
I don't think President Trump is the one called out in the current Ukraine government corruption investigation &amp; trial. It seems your Presidential Candidate Joe Biden is the person listed.  Sorry...Facts hurt...
The Biden campaign really needs to push Early Voting where ever possible.  We cannot afford to have long lines on election day with stormtroopers out and about.
She cherry picks whose racist and who isn‚Äôt, Not gon lie Biden has done questionable things, but Trump gets a pass? Plus doesn‚Äôt Melissa realize Trump used to be a Democrat himself? Where was the outrage then?
Biden won't dare, tho - he can't even string enough words together to create a coherent sentence.
Biden talks about unifying the country while his decades as a politician show he‚Äôs accomplished pretty much zip and has done nothing for the minorities he supposedly cares so much about.
I don‚Äôt support Joe Biden at all but I absolutely would LOVE to see Trump Lose, imagine how pissed Trump voters would be? Ah the tables would ultimately turn and I can already see the excuses, in case you‚Äôre wondering, I‚Äôm supporting an Independent candidate in November.
Yes, Sir PRESIDENT BIDEN!!
Text TRUMP to 88022! I stand with   I think Basement Biden's lawyers will have him plead the 5th on this issue.  Even though he probably doesn't know what pleading the 5th means.
Huh.... oh..... now I see why you are voting for biden... carry on
Trump. Out. Biden. In. Peace.
Yes!  in August the are having Signs Across America for Joe Biden.
When Biden loses, he will think that he won. And then he'll write a book... What what what what what what what happened.
It‚Äôs Chris Cillizza who loves tearing down women. Soon as Biden chooses the VP Cillizza will spend the rest of the run to the election pointing out every negative over &amp; over &amp; over‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..
Is it bot behavior when people are still on the fence about Joe Biden since he doesn't believe in a single payer system  and he still believes healthcare should be tied to employment even in a pandemic with record high unemployment?
By bots, you mean voters who have issues with Biden's record on criminal justice? Are they considered bots if they take issue with the fact that Joe Biden doesn't support full legalization of marijuana? Is it bot behavior to say Joe Biden doesn't support Medicare for All?

Loved seeing her too,  let‚Äôs not get people all balled up over Biden‚Äôs VP choice,  winning this election is bigger &amp;we shouldn‚Äôt put in people‚Äôs head that they are some how dejected with HIS choice.  This election is bigger than a VP choice and yes getting rid of trump is BIGGER!
I love all the  black VP choices &amp; I love Warren too, staying home if Biden doesn‚Äôt choose a black vp is  like saying if you don‚Äôt choose who I want give me 4 more years of Trump.  They didnt vote for Biden , but here we are, let‚Äôs not make it harder than it already is.

Yes but they are structured and framed as equivalent, so the Times snuck in an inaccurate ‚Äúbaseless‚Äù implication to the Biden argument.
Yes. A vote for anyone other than Biden is a vote for 45.
Before liberals twist George Carlin's words, understand he was heavily critical of both parties and he knew that politicians are in the back pockets of wealthy corporations, the "owners" as he calls them. He would have dragged both Trump and Biden if he were alive today.

ALL THIS IS HAPPENING UNDER TRUMPS AMERICA,  NOT OBAMA NOT BIDEN,  NOT HILLARY,  TRUMP

ONLY think Biden is doing to win my reluctant support is drawing a "aggressive" climate policy. I want ExxonMobil thrown is jail as much as you. Will I take massive infrastructure investments &amp; economic support to pll hurt as we shift energy balance away from dead dinosaurs. Yep
Yes because I'm voting for Biden regardless of who he  other words, Elizabeth Warren,yes Karen Bass yes, mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms yes, Susan Rice yes, Tammy Duckworth yes.
Biden is going to throw everybody a curveball and pick Michigan's Governor Gretchen Whitmer
So what happens if President Trump disputes election results in November?  story says a bipartisan group has gamed it out and ... the results aren‚Äôt pretty.

And the kicker of all kickers, Robert Byrd of the KKK died as a card carrying democrat, AFTER he trained Joe Biden and Hillary Clinton, 2 people with their name all over the school to prison pipeline and the Crime bill of 1994. But yeah the parties switched
In 2008 Joe Biden didn't win a single delegate or state but President Obama picked him as his VP.
Biden's going to throw everybody a curve ball and Pick Michigan's Governor Gretchen Whitmer.Kamala won't galvanized the black women vote like people think. Keisha Lance Bottoms could but but resume may be too light.
this is out of control. When Biden wins can we charge Fox News for spreading hate speech!?
you do understand your enemy should be trump, not biden right? or are you intentionally trying to split the vote so trump wins again

This is such a lazy and factually inaccurate  take. 1. HRC‚Äôs campaign was not polling at numbers Biden is at this time/places. 2. We‚Äôre in the middle of pandemic, so the campaigns are patently different in how they‚Äôve been run. 3. Biden‚Äôs platform far more progressive than HRC.
Those who hang with Biden are ok with illegal spying, wiretapping, multiple examples of racist statements and over 40 years of doing nothing for the people he supposedly cares so much about
Baby, you need help. Please do yourself some good and commit yourself for a few months to get back where you need to be. You've got babies that depend on you. Then when you're on the right track, come out and VOTE BIDEN!!

Saw a Joe Biden ad on TV last night and it was one of the best election ads I've ever seen. Emotional and negative but positive enough not to seem over the top. Superior to anything I saw from Hillary four years ago. The former VP has some smart people running his campaign.
It‚Äôs not about ME, it‚Äôs about YOU and US per biden 2020! Vote crooked trump out !  Please ! Rapist, racist, fake president, crooked, alarmist towards racism , monies towards his golf courses, womanizer , lier, lier, lier vote trump out please! Walls of mommies !!

Hi Chris! Please don't take it personally! I work full time. I help take care ofvmy granddaughter. Right now I'm going thru dm's trying to find people who have reached out to volunteer. We are working on Signs across America for Joe Biden.
Why do you think that I‚Äôm ok with it? I‚Äôm just pointing out some of trump‚Äôs hypocrisy. Everything that you said, China was doing BEFORE trump asked them to help with Biden. trump is the one that doesn‚Äôt care. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre bitter at my lord and savior, trump! So mean!‚Äù üò≠üò≠üò≠
Okay, I get your point! Biden 2020
We'll see about that ma'am! He's not doing too well at the moment! Biden 2020!
Hey! Remember that time when trump asked China to help him investigate Biden's son? And now he's mad because they are hacking from the embassy? Yeah, good times.
Hope for Biden though?  Even though he had 8 years
Now you know why John Kasich is speaking for and supporting Joe Biden (not that it really matters), they are all tied together in this corruption. The Rabbit Hole keeps getting Deeper &amp; Deeper!!! "Those you trusted the most"...
Biden is a racist.
I was just speaking on the same topic the other night! Could it be he's just another New York bullshiter! We will win without Bloomberg! Biden 2020
Biden told the black voters you ain‚Äôt black unless you vote for me.  Direct quote.
So I guess that means they‚Äôll be letting us pick Biden‚Äôs running mate? If they really believe their own bs
Dude, get over it. By doing what you are is making it political. It is one interview by the owner of the company that you work for. Just do your job that you state you love so much. Trust me...it will be ok. Don't whine. And Good Luck if you get an Interview with Senile Joe Biden
If UR entertaining that Biden is a pervert or pedophile you are being groomed for some kind of "evidence" to drop later so you'll say "I knew it" just before the election and hand it to Trump. It'll be shown later to be false after the election but by then it will be too late.

Have you seen Biden!?  He forgets what his wife looks like.
Didn‚Äôt Biden try to cancel the debates?
He already said he was. He tells Biden to please go ahead &amp; pick his black woman VP so he can get enthusiastic about voting for her, because he'd never get enthusiastic about voting for Bide. It's exactly what most of us have been saying for months, the election is about his VP.
I wouldn't vote for Joe Biden if he had a cure for the kung floo.
These are the exact same things we brought up in 2016. Word for word, except substitute HRC for Biden.
What scares me the most is Joe Biden will not be scrutinized the same way Trump is. I'm afraid Joe Biden will lull people to sleep and he'll be able to violate human rights and there won't be a peep from the woke resistance folks and they'll chastise leftists for doing so.
I have a really bad feeling Joe Biden will do the same shit Trump is doing right now to violate our first amendment rights and the #Resistance will not say a word about it. They're rightfully vocal about Trump now, but once Joe Biden becomes president they'll be quiet.
If Joe Biden becomes president and there's still protests going on, do you think he'll sic the federal police onto them? And if he does, do you think liberals will cheer him on for doing so? Because I have no doubt the #Resistance folks will not resist that at all.
That doesn't even make any damn sense! Joe Biden served 8 years with a black president! Donald Trump is very obviously a racist! We'll see what America thinks
Thank God we need all the help we can get! Biden 2020!
Dont forget Biden and the rest. U clowns always aim at one party but not the rest  üôÉ Democrats  and Republicans  are the same people  on different  sides
The only people who have been punked are Trump supporters who have fallen for his lies and bull s***! Biden 2020
Excuse me, but I hate Donald Trump! I think he's the biggest fraud, conman, crook, bully, divider in chief this country has ever seen! Biden 2020
Biden has also been in washington the majority of his career... trumps been there 3 years.  anything else?
If the question is Trump or Biden, Biden is the answer.
i dont see biden deploying federal forces against americans.  or calling klan members good people. or consistently speaking against anyone who isnt white.  sorry, its not the "same bro"  AGAIN, im not fighting FOR biden.  theres a bigger picture here.
as i said... i dont know anyone voting FOR biden.  I'd much rather have bernie personally.  But its more than a vote just for president.
but obviously the choices suck... i dont know alot of biden "fans" but its understood what is the best option moving forward
or you look at the whole picture, its not just a vote for biden as president... but getting biden in office will help change alot of things in washington for the better.  thats how i look at it.
I just listened to your donkey of the day on Joe Biden and I heard you say our country got to where it is because of old white men!! Did you forget that the man who ran this country before Trump was a Black man? At what point will black America start putting Obama
As an Independent, Biden is not my choice, but I will vote for him to get rid of trump's fat ignorant ass. The black community where I live, can't stand him.  trump only got 8% of the black vote in 2016. Compared to the majority of the black vote- Obama in '08 &amp; '12.
Joe Biden has a long to-do list if he wins the White House
Let 'em know what? That we're not allowed to criticize Joe Biden?
You don't think Biden would do the same?
The Joe Biden ad on ESPN during the Dodgers-Giants game was the first ad of his I've seen this whole election cycle while living here in Southeastern Virginia.
It‚Äôs still Biden 2020 for me, regardless of his comments
If you want to feel hopeful about the election, go to  and listen to the remarks of disaffected Republicans who are supporting Biden. Many also resolve to punish all Republican enablers. Good stuff.
Of course not!  Anyone that does is in worse shape mentally than Biden. Polls are run by the media, which is nothing more than the PR division of the DNC these days.
Hey idiot, this isn't happening under Joe Biden, its happening under Donald Trump. I know y'all aren't the sharpest tools in the shed but man... that's idiotic!
First one went to Biden,  second will be split between JoBi and Luria
"One of the things that I think is important: I wish, I wish we taught more in our schools about the Islamic faith," Biden said. "What people don't realize is ... we all come from the same root here, in terms of our fundamental basic beliefs." Is what he actually said.
I got a call on my house phone (I need to get rid of)  about 2 months ago.   It took me until nearly the end to figure out how pro-trump it was, they ended up near the end referring to 'sleepy Joe Biden' and had shitty response options to some questions.
this country will never be a socialist nation EVER!  Trump will beat Biden and squash socialism like a bug so that it never becomes a thing and you can forget about using Denmark as an example cause they aren't socialist.
You mean like the Test Obama &amp; Biden just stopped doing during the H1N1 pandemic? Post the Tested / Tested positive rate vs. the death rate which is quickly dropping/ Your event failed...face it Trump wins easily in November. Look out for John Durham...
While we'll see a scaled-back Republican convention, I bet Dems forge ahead with tonight's agenda at their Portland convention.  Biden's national platform is coming together brick by brick.

No Jake we just only tested the most people in the World to date and Trump is asking for additional money for even more testing. Guess he didn't just stop the test efforts like Obama &amp; Biden did. How about speaking the death trend vs. the # of people tested and or tested positive
Looks like Charlemagne the god confirmed today what we all knew about the Joe Biden candidacy, it's not about Joe, but his VP. Then he slams Kanye. ü§î
Highly unlikely. Biden has no hope other than politics. Trump has every reason to NOT be president. He just wanted the clout. He's got hundreds of millions (maybe billions) of reasons üíµ to leave if he loses and not a single reason to go to war. Biden on the other hand...
not too far away from early voting in a couple of these states.  I think both Michigan and Minnesota start 45 and 46 days before the election.   I really hope the Biden campaign really really pushes early voting hard.
The man literally donates his presidential fee (about $400K) to a different group every year. Does the presidency give him more clout? Sure. Will he ruin the country cuz he loses to Biden? Highly unlikely. The presidency isn't his only gig.
I'm Riden With Biden 46

Last time I checked (this morning) this is HIS America .. and we need Jo Biden to fix it.
So you prefer a repeat of Obama ass-kissing every world leader to where we were a laughing stock.  Notice since he left office, we no longer have terror attacks here in the states. Biden is weaker than even Obama.
Here is where Biden wants you to live.  What right does the government have to tell you whether you can own your own home where you want to live?
You either hate Biden or love America. Pick one.

Biden raped somebody according to that somebody. How do women vote for people who grope women on actual video and have a rape case that kinda just "went away". And sadly, Tara Reid wasn't alone, but yeah #WOMENSRIGHTS
Obama and Biden were amazing. You are way out of their league.
Liberals and non-Trumper Conservatives now: Setting differences aside and coming together to get Trump out of the WH  Liberals and non-Trumper Conservatives after Biden gets elected and they immediately start bickering again:
Biden and Obama condemn Trump's COVID-19 response
These are treacherous times!! Trump wants to be King! This is why our forefathers in America did not make this soo! Vote! Vote! Biden 2020
Naw, he showed and continues to show what he really is. There's no redeeming Joe Biden, he hasn't changed
I wish you was more incline regarding our men and women who had a bounty on their heads ! Almost 4 million Americans with covid 19 or over 130 ,000,of our Americans dead!! But I see you troll ! We dont want a dictatorial troll or a King! Biden 2020
What a maroon. Someone needs to inform Biden that some American presidents owned slaves.
‚ÄòI went fishing, and a coffee cup and forks were, were uh, there. And I like the smell of gasoline.‚Äô-   Joe Biden‚Äôs thoughts on climate change probably.

Hunter Biden made millions from Chinese coal while his dad helped decimate coal in the USA... shh, don‚Äôt tell anyone
Great activist? Maybe. But he let the district he ran go to hell, didn‚Äôt do much for the people who lived there. Took huge donations even when he ran unopposed and supported people like Biden when he railed against desegregation and busing .
I‚Äôm confused. I thought liberals LOVED taxing the rich. Biden said his economic plan would be paid for in part by taxing the WEALTHY.
I Been With Joe Biden From Day 1,üíô
They're making an even weaker case for Biden than they did Hillary. Even people who will vote for him admit he isn't a good choice.
Who every Joe Biden pick as V,P they have to be vetted they back ground has to be good No Dirty that will hurt the election.
Uncontrolled pandemic, rogue Federal agents, unemployment and no health insurance , violence by white supremacists.. In Biden's America the main cause of all of this will be in prison.
Let's Not Forget Rep John Lewis Said Keep Your Eyes On The Ball!! Republicans party  and  have received FAKE Documents from UK. The Trump Campaign and Gop what's to Smear Joe Biden.  Keep your Eyes On The Ball. #TrumpResignNow
I've seen alot of videos of people who voted for him in 16 who will be voting for Biden now. People with intelligence who admit they made a mistake. But the far right, kool aid drinking, mask throwing racist mfers won't leave his side.
I've been going back and forth these last few days between Kamala and Susan Rice,although I believe Rice would be a better fit For Biden.She has a lot of baggage and her pick would be going back in the past.Kamala is the safer pick.
Enjoy these last few presidential greetings, trump in serious trouble in the polls and with his lack of common sense there's nothing nobody can do to save him. He's even asking to push back the butt kicking Biden about to put on him once the White House&amp;Fox polls show him losing
Choosing only from candidates of one gender is #sexist. Joe Biden has a long history of supporting America‚Äôs #fascist policies &amp; is no friend of the left. He supports the wanton slaughter of #black children through his steadfast support of the racist Planned Parenthood org.
If Biden don't pick Kamala Harris now the backlash will be brutal.I've been following politics for 40 years and I have never seen a potential VP pick being torn apart by there on party like this.
Biden has accomplished basically zip in his four plus decades as a politician. Really don‚Äôt want a guy as POTUS who can barely speak coherently at times.
Biden: Supports $1200 ‚Äúrelief‚Äù Trump: Supports $1200 ‚Äúrelief‚Äù Jorgensen: Lets citizens keep their own money by eliminating the income tax, allowing for more people to have a savings than ever before, and allowing them to be more generous than ever before.
"The survey, it‚Äôs worth noting, was conducted July 28 to 30, mostly before Trump‚Äôs tweet about delaying the election. If anything, these gaps will likely widen in the wake of his incendiary suggestion." Which is EXACTLY why he made it.
This is NOT Biden's America ..
#ADOS Who do you think Joe Biden should select as VP???
It's a curious / interesting decision that Biden has, b/c each VP contender will face a mountain of R critiquing as you've noted.  I honestly don't know who he should pick.  Hard to pick Harris after the nasty debate exchange; yet the others also have numerous, similar issues.
Actually, it was Biden who suggested using the military in such an event.
Let's keep our eye on the ball Trump and Republicans party trying to do play book 2016 watch Ron Johnson and Lindsey Graham. They trying to smear Joe Biden.
Trump didn't speak on election results until he saw it was impossible for him to beat Biden. We didn't hear nothing while he was campaigning for others. The man scared and his presidential powers can't do nothing to stop November 3 butt kicking
botted tweets really expose the fact that there are idiotically defensive assholes supporting both sides üòÇ ever Trump tweet that gets oWo-ed triggers a bunch of Trumpers and every Biden tweet that gets oWo-ed triggers a bunch of Dems üòÇüòÇ
who else will they vote for that actually has a chance though? then we‚Äôre stuck with donald for 4 more years because we‚Äôre divided on our vote while he has a solid base. I don‚Äôt see how it does any good to not vote biden. Trust me, I don‚Äôt like Joe but we need donald out
You evidently know nothing about Biden. Just listening to him speak is proof he has a cognitive issue. Do a little research before calling just one of them terrible.
This is the unfortunate truth Biden folks, #resistance folks, #KHive trolls, blue wavers will not understand. Even if Trump loses, people will suffer and we'll still face the constant fear of getting sick and having no medical insurance because Joe will not enact #MedicareForAll
The only thing Republican lite Democrats care about is taking control for 4 more years to replace RBG and stopping SCOTUS turn even more far to the right. By that time, people will die needlessly and families will face financial ruin as Joe Biden does little to help us.
What's depressing is conservative Democrats are not fighting to make this country a better place to live for those of us struggling in this crisis. Biden has made no promises to uplift and help us as we're facing an eviction crisis and a healthcare crisis. Nothing will change.
It goes to show you how weak Joe Biden is that his minions on Twitter have to comes to his defense because he's such a terrible candidate. Do you think Trump will be as kind as Biden's critics on the left? They're already calling him a socialist, which is laughable.
It's bad enough to having to choose between the two despite the outcome being the same: death by a lack of healthcare access. What's insulting is when Republicans disguised as Democrats tell me I can't tell the truth about Joe Biden because it'll help Trump.
The cold hard truth conservative Democrats are refusing to admit is even if Biden wins there's still going to be suffering under his administration. All they have is "damage reduction", but what they don't say is hundreds and thousands more will die all in order replace RBG.
Show me a tweet about Biden that I originated?
I'm absolutely terrified they will especially if Biden's VP pic isn't to the liking of everyone. I have my VP preferences but whoever he pics I'll still be voting for him. No matter what Trump is exponentially worse than anyone Biden can pic.
I am new to the KHive, so please excuse me if I ask a stupid question. Why do they continue disruptive behavior if we are supposed to be on the same side? After these last 3 1/2 years, you'd think they would work w/the best team to win (Biden/Harris).
This is why I am VOTING for you VP Biden‚úùÔ∏èüôèüèæ
Why is her face obscured ?

Eid Mubarak! After Trump cages our children Biden will deport them while House Democrats votes on a bill to give them airplane tickets.
Followed the advice of Biden in his January 29th op ed to start.
You know, it's sad: that sentence right there might have been enough to convince me to vote for Biden, were I a citizen. That's how low his opponent has set the bar.
'the polls were off In 2016.' yeah no, michigan and pennsylvania were both within the margin of error. Wisconsin was the only state off. Biden now doubles Hillary's lead compared to this time 2016, ESP in the rust belt, and Biden leads in almost every swing and even TEXAS
Is Kamala Harris Biden's VP?!  via
And as far as I'm concerned, the American people will suffer no matter who wins, and there's no amount of shamming coming from you that will change that unfortunate reality. Biden or Trump, people will die from a lack of healthcare access.
Biden said he would veto Medicare For All and the DNC has voted down any measures of enacting a single payer healthcare systems, along with many other progressive and popular ideas that were rejected. That's not the fault of someone critiquing that insanity. That's on Biden.
Oh, so it's her fault that Biden is looking less electable because of his inadequate policy proposals and not Biden himself? It's because of her criticism and not because Biden has said time and time again he doesn't care about our needs in this crisis we're in right now?
This is the same face we're all making knowing Joe Biden will never fight for #MedicareForAll.
Then why are you on her case when she says Joe Biden will increase our premiums? She's not helping Trump when she points out Joe Biden doesn't plan on doing anything about our healthcare system even in the middle of a pandemic.
That's not her job to make Joe Biden less shitty. It's on Joe Biden himself.
We're not allowed to say Joe Biden's healthcare policy, or lack of, is not sustainable given that we're in a pandemic? Are we not allowed to demand better from the presumptive nominee?
This is who Joe Biden and Kamala Harris attracts. I'll be damned if this is who we have to unite with in order to defeat Trump. A bunch of bitter, hateful, self-absorbed trolls that don't think we're actual people. We don't matter to them. They sound just like Republicans.
Will Biden even make it until then?  His feebleness and addled demeanor is clearly quickly increasing.  The question is, who would really be president IF he is elected?
The truth to them is like God's Word is to demons. They don't want exposure or to answer for their crimes against America &amp; its people. Trump didn't play their game &amp; refused to be their puppet. Dems won't tolerate this &amp; Joe Biden is willing to be their puppet.
Are u a Biden fan or Bernie ?
Yeah, sure. Whatever you say loser. The only BIG thing happening now is the amount of losing that you're doing to Joe Biden.  Hold the L jackass.
Biden is not even going to get 80 percent of the black vote. And that's just because he's not for Reparations for Black Americans whose lineage goes back to slavery and only them
Fucken pc of shit!! Vote please biden 2020
A whole 247 watching Biden!! Wow!
I signed up top be a delegate for Convention of Founding Principles, yet you have people supporting Biden speaking at this event.  The organization will be accused of being UNPRINCIPLED.  I'd like to speak at your event at attack Trump by going after RED States!
Pick for Biden's running mate is crucial, analyst says
Maybe trump should be secluded (detained?) during the election results until Biden emerges as the clear winner...
I would also like Biden to commit to ensuring that all future POTUS's, including himself, are unable to commit the wholesale obstruction of oversight and justice Trump/Barr have. That and making it clear to all those currently betraying our country that there WILL be a reconning.
I think it's going to be  because we don't see her anywhere and Kamala is all over the place.I just have this feeling that Biden is going to throw us a curve ball.
Mail in ballots less stressful than running across a bunch of poll locations that's closed down or the voting machines not working so pick you poison all votes will count and the margin of difference in votes between Biden and trump will be self explanatory
Yes, I know Olsen denounces Trump today and acknowledges that he criticized Biden - but he never actually apologizes to Biden.
Also it's basically 50 state elections. Even if some shit tier states like Mississippi or Oklahoma decide to go ahead with it, Biden probably gets enough electoral votes anyways.
I, for one, am happy to welcome anyone who has had a genuine change of heart into the fold.  I sincerely hope all the anecdotal evidence of "Former GOP"/"2016 Trump, 2020 Biden" voters is true.  If it is, and they vote as stated, there's a Dem Landslide coming.
It‚Äôs so obvious Obama is just itching to go to war with Trump while on the campaign trail for Biden, and I am here for ALL of it. üòé #ObamaEulogy
Both candidates are unable to campaign openly so I'm sure that Biden might consider... unless it's ok with him since he's stuck in the basement....
No we mustn‚Äôt. For me, the dems could run a cardboard cut out of Biden and I‚Äôd vote for it. I‚Äôm not a Biden fan - he was not my top choice - but we need to get 45 out ASAP please and thank you.  Again, just my opinion
It's Evident Biden Is Confused But Real Americans Are Not. We Dont Want A Demented Socialist Racist Running Our Nation. Socialism Doesn't Work For The People It Enslaves Them. Keep America Free, Keep Trump!üá∫üá∏
i hear you but voting for Biden is not possible.

It is very disappointing that Biden won't advocate for #MedicareForAll or do much about many important issues. However, it is very good to know that Biden won't use the Attorney General as his personal attorney, or award the Medal of Freedom to Rush Limbaugh, or commit treason.
Biden would be the downfall of the United States. He is senile and can't hold a coherent conversation, talks shit to his voters and acts better than everyone else. Joe is worse than Trump cuz at least Trump has balls
Joe Biden can't have open rallies because the far-left will interrupt every speech he gives that isn't closely guarded‚Ä¶and that will prove, on camera, the schism between the DNC and people actually motivated on the far left.
Pretty Brazen To Support A Racist Such As Biden.  Who Used The FBI To Spy &amp; Then Lie About Trump Colluding With Russia. No true American Can Blame Trump For Being Concerned About Dems Dirty Dealings With Votes. You Want To Legally Allow Illegals To Vote. You Corrupt Our System.

Hey A$$hat!  Don‚Äôt you think we have bigger problems?  I mean, to promote a pizza joint now!!! You are one of a kind and you are taking us all down with you. You talk about Biden not all there. Dude, the engine is running but you are as sure as hell not behind the wheel.
Biden's moderation? Biden is in no condition to run his administration, is captive to the extreme left, and is about to announce a nightmare (from a "conservative" perspective) running mate, who may well finish his term. Will is suffering from TDS.
How come no one is asking if Biden would accept Trumps win?
According to this photo, Biden's Dementia is worse than Trump's dementia, which if we go by this metric, Trump is re-elected #ADOSPolitics
Is Biden still announcing his VP pick before August (this Saturday)? Or did I make that up in my head?
Omg!! WTf‚Äô trump wants to moved the election from November because biden is kicking his butt!! Let‚Äôs be clear HE HAS NOT AUTHORIZED to moved shit ! clear is that only the states and Congress have the power to delay that part of the election process! Facts! Vote this monster out

Lilly, I was stuck a couple months ago. Download an app called "Unfollow Today". It lets you easily see and unfollow people who aren't following you. If you have questions, feel free to DM me.
No. That is not an acceptable answer. Not everyone can wait to 2024 for the perfect choice. Biden wasn't even my 3rd pick, but he offers a chance to step back from the edge.
Duh tf? She had a whole campaign and isn‚Äôt that the whole point of why Biden is choosing a women vp so they can be his replacement in the 2024 election

cool you explained 1 of them away, but for every gaf trump has Biden has 10
At least he isn‚Äôt afraid to be interviewed like Biden. Dude feels pressure and melts like an icicle in August.

I personally would vote for Biden regardless of who he picks but the way his campaign been dangling black women at the top of the list,if he doesn't choose a black woman there may be a serious backlash.Some black women may not work hard for him to get elected
I bet the DNC is working right not to figure out how they can make as many of Biden's "appearances" in the convention scripted and pre-recorded.
My guess is the media was told to start selling Harris and Politico let the cat out of the bag. So, let the pitch begin. Interesting that both Biden &amp; Harris have backgrounds in sending black people to jail. Is there a message there?

Presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden unveiled plans for racial economic equality on Tuesday before reporters in Delaware. He also said that he plans to name a vice presidential candidate during the first week of August.  #News3Politics
This is my brother in rural Ga. This sounds exactly like what he‚Äôs been saying recently. I‚Äôve been gobsmacked to hear him speak like this about black people. And he‚Äôs VERY unhappy that Biden spoke at Flyod‚Äôs funeral. But he is absolutely NOT voting for Trump.
‚ÄòDo not hold grudges‚Äô against Kamala Harris: Biden speech notes caught on camera
Doesn't matter who Biden pick I'm still going to vote for Joe because the alternative is unacceptable.Trump is an embarrassment to the office of the presidency.Just look at his press conferences the dude is a narcissist and insane
Joe Biden‚Äôs notes: ‚ÄòDo not hold grudges‚Äô against Kamala Harris
So your not allowed to passionately express your opinion on an issue that's different from your primary opponent?I am a Biden supporter and I thought the attacks on her were unfair.
There was a time where I would've considered voting for Biden.  That was 2016.
The American people who chose to vote in the Democratic primary voted for Biden. He is the Democratic nominee by popular vote.
Joe Biden keeps forgetting who he selected for VP but I'm still voting for him
Just figured it out, they added the superdelegates to biden's total,  Democracy isn't real
It doesn't matter which black woman Biden picks the Republicans will find away to attack that VP choice.Kamala is actually the safest pick.We know what the GOP play book will be,Willie Brown that will get old fast.
I‚Äôm not sure who is a bigger badass, AG Barr or Jim Jordan. Today the Dems proved that they don‚Äôt care about this country, they care about their agenda and their re-elections. They are truly laughing stocks with no way forward, and good luck to them with Biden as the Head.
The Biden camp has been dangling a variety of Black women as his VP,with most being on his short list.If he doesn't choose a black woman,his chance of energizing the black vote will be gone.
There is a leak in the Biden camp whose only purpose is to sabotage

Here's where we are today, July 28th, 2020.  Imagine where we'll be if Trump doesn't rein-in Fauci and/or Biden wins.
America needs you to answer the call and save our Republic.... Biden/Obama 2020
Joe Biden once said he would be a one term president, so they're looking for a proper candidate the corporate donors will agree with for 2024. That and the current political climate we're in has a lot to do with it.
I'm one of those.   Sure, I had other candidates in mind, but anything is better than #CadetBoneSpurs  and I feel like biden will be very capable of at a MINIMUM undoing a bunch of the illegal bullshit trump did and help pass legislation protecting democracy.
If by indispensable, you mean Whitewasher Barr doesn't prosecute Comey and McCabe for leaking and lying to congress and announces there will be no investigation of Obama and Biden but he does catch the Democrats saying dumb things...sure.
Biden? Out of sight, out of his mind.
You are right.  "Biden shouldn't throw Trump a lifeline by granting him any debates". That's a losing proposition for Biden, and he (well, his handlers) damn well know it. #Trump2020
Barr has always talked a good game.  Meanwhile announced no charges for leaking and lying to congress for Comey and McCabe.  Said no more politics, immediately announced no investigation into Obama and Biden... a purely political announcement.  He's lead whitewasher.
I understand the case conservative Democrats make for voting for Joe Biden is taking back the SCOTUS. I only wish they would also acknowledge that it would cost the lives of hundreds of thousands more who are without healthcare because Joe Biden doesn't believe in #MedicareForAll
With the Biden campaign limiting his live exposure to interviewers to mere minutes, there's no way he can stay coherent long enough to do an interview with Wallace. There won't be any debates, either.
As much as you want to convince me a Joe Biden presidency is better than 4 more years of Trump, we'll be stuck in the same situation in terms of healthcare. Both of them want to keep this barbaric system that is tied to our employment as we're seeing record number unemployment.
Either way, we'll be in under great hardships under either Trump or Biden. We'll be without healthcare and god help us if we get sick without insurance during a global pandemic. Neither of them support single payer. We'll suffer greatly.
Barr  Comey and McCabe off for leaking and lying to congress, said no more political DOJ decisions, then promptly announces no investigation of Obama and Biden.  Bill "Business as Usual" Barr writes strongly worded letters and talks big. He's the chief whitewasher.
Absurd.  He let Comey and McCabe off for leaking and lying to congress, said no more political DOJ decisions, then promptly announces no investigation of Obama and Biden.  Bill "Business as Usual" Barr writes strongly worded letters and talks big. He's the chief whitewasher.
I agree wholeheartedly with

Obama and Clooney team up to raise money for Biden  #FoxNews
Sounds like democrats here. Biden would probably be on disability along with schitt for brains and schmucker.
The onky threat Donakd Trump is to them is he is exposing the Demonrats and the corruption perpetrated within our government by the likes of scum like Comey, Stryok, Brennan, Pelosi, Biden, Schumer and Schifty.
The general election is months away. She's in a primary race. Biden isn't yet the nominee.   Why does everyone rush things so far ahead of schedule?
Does the ballot machine magically change the vote from Jorgensen to Trump? Funny, cause Trump supporters say the machine magically changes from Jorgensen to Biden.
Also, most of the pollsters have adjusted their methodology, and most swing states are well outside the margin of error in favor of Biden right now, and Biden is outperforming Hillary by every objective measure.  Anything can change but DJT is losing right now.
Honestly, does Bernie still believe Biden would be the most progressive president since FDR? The guy is against progressive ideas.
I still think it‚Äôs wild that Biden leads in polls in Texas. But, this kind of close lead can make Texas a toss up.
Wrong! They are Americans who are protesting injustice. The same exact injustice you have sent after them. Brutality! Stop saying it would be worse under Biden. At this point anything is better than what you've done to our country you selfish narcissistic jerk
I think a lot of her lack of support from the black community was do to the fact that we felt like that Biden was the only one that could beat Trump and we weren't going to waist our vote regardless of the skin color.
And to think Bernie believes Biden would be the most progressive candidate since FDR. It's nothing more than a sick joke.
Biden camp scrambling to hit their air with the counter-message of "he doesn't really mean that" and then he just tweets "The failing Democrats want you to think I didn't mean that. I did mean that!"

What?  All of this burning and rioting is bc of your inability to lead our country. I also think it‚Äôs funny that you use actual footage from events that happened recently in your lastest campaign ad and then said, this is what it will be like if Biden was president. #A$$hat
reporting! Here's me w a #feetinterview on the #streetinterview scene at  chicago    Wonder if she's HRC/BIDEN?
No doubt that Biden is being used but he also is allowing it. He knows what the Socialists are up to. He worked alongside Communist &amp; ISIS sympathizer Obama for 8 years &amp; helped to tear this nation apart. Now he &amp; his army of evil (Satan's Soldiers) plan to finish their work.
I expect nothing from Bill "Business as Usual" Barr, and he's surprised me by exactly how little he's accomplished.  Said, "No more politics at DOJ!"  Followed by, "Obama and Biden won't be investigated"!  Comey and McCabe, no charges for leaking/lying to congress. Perfect score.
Joe Biden is a little scardy cat! He‚Äôs scared to pieces about debates with PRESIDENT TRUMP!!! Hahaha. He‚Äôs a coward!
Bill "Business as Usual" Barr is useless.  He writes stern letters, gives hard-talking speeches, then says, Obama and Biden won't be investigated, Comey and McCabe...no charges for leaking and lying to congress.  These people are useless trough-feeders.
Edwards was my pick when Kerry should have gone with somebody he got along with who didn't turn out to be a creep. Maybe Gephardt?  Biden was my pick for Obama, and it worked out! Kaine was the sentimental favorite, which leads to...
I don't think it's going to be Kamala because of all the VP picks she's the only one that's being seen the most. Biden's about to throw a curveball and pick either Elizabeth Warren or Michigan Governor's Gretchen Whitmer.
Exactly. Pelosi, Schumer, Biden, and the rest of the Clinton-worshipping conservative core of the Democratic party don't care anymore about the American people than the GOP does. The 2 party system is a lie. We live in an oligarchy. Period.
Very nice of Mike Pence to provide this footage for the next Biden ads in Florida.

The ideas and policies that Nancy Pelosi and Joe Biden are vehemently opposed to. Like #MedicareForAll for example.
Probably. From what I understand, Joe Biden got the bulk of the VA vote from Northern Virginia, which is close to DC. It's a haven for establishment Democrats. Hell, nearly all of VA is an establishment haven. There's hardly any progressives here, despite being a blue state.
Yeah photo shoots are fun.üòÇ  Biden was kissing that girl in real time. (Not Staged)
To those who are upset about Bernie's delegates doing this, it's called "earning their votes". Last time I checked, this is still a democracy and not a coronation. Biden is not entitled to their votes just because he's the presumptive nominee.
Biden is a disgrace and embarrassment to our country. Worst, most corrupt, treasonous VP ever ü§Æ
And Joe Biden can do better. He can tell us what he is going to do for our Country, which is probably nothing.

I'm not sure what happened, but there's no doubt in my mind that Biden and his team did what he did here in VA and coalesced the representatives and told their voters their marching orders. They were organized to a fucking T
I live in Virginia and I saw no signs of any ground game here for Biden and yet he won it by wide margins. All he did was gather endorsement from Democratic representatives here and that's all he needed. It taught me a harsh lesson about how politics is played here and I hate it.
I'm going to need the Biden campaign to stop making it so hard to vote for him. Have Chris Dodd sit down. Keep Biden in the basement. Just let Trump make Biden's case for him. The best thing the Biden campaign can do for the next 99 days is just keep quiet.

Biden won't dare, tho - he can't even string enough words together to create a coherent sentence.
Biden talks about unifying the country while his decades as a politician show he‚Äôs accomplished pretty much zip and has done nothing for the minorities he supposedly cares so much about.
I don‚Äôt support Joe Biden at all but I absolutely would LOVE to see Trump Lose, imagine how pissed Trump voters would be? Ah the tables would ultimately turn and I can already see the excuses, in case you‚Äôre wondering, I‚Äôm supporting an Independent candidate in November.

So I guess that means they‚Äôll be letting us pick Biden‚Äôs running mate? If they really believe their own bs
Dude, get over it. By doing what you are is making it political. It is one interview by the owner of the company that you work for. Just do your job that you state you love so much. Trust me...it will be ok. Don't whine. And Good Luck if you get an Interview with Senile Joe Biden
If UR entertaining that Biden is a pervert or pedophile you are being groomed for some kind of "evidence" to drop later so you'll say "I knew it" just before the election and hand it to Trump. It'll be shown later to be false after the election but by then it will be too late.
The Nation Is Dealing With A Pandemic, Rioting, &amp; A Takeover By Socialists But This Is Newsworthy. ü§î Anything To Get Eyes Off Of Biden. President Trump reveals he 'too often' regrets his tweets in exclusive interview with Barstool Sports founder
100% chance Joe Biden did not write this tweet.
Joe Biden brings the heat?
How much better would this country be without Pelosi, schumer, northam, kaine, Warner, Newsome, aoc, talib, omar, nadler, Schiff,  Obama,  Clinton's, biden, hollywood.....can you imagine how much better this world would be? #MAGA2020 #KAG #Democrats #LiberalismIsTheRealPandemic
Have you seen Biden!?  He forgets what his wife looks like.
Didn‚Äôt Biden try to cancel the debates?
He already said he was. He tells Biden to please go ahead &amp; pick his black woman VP so he can get enthusiastic about voting for her, because he'd never get enthusiastic about voting for Bide. It's exactly what most of us have been saying for months, the election is about his VP.
ICYMI, Joe Biden's live stream interview had all of NINETEEN viewers.
I wouldn't vote for Joe Biden if he had a cure for the kung floo.
These are the exact same things we brought up in 2016. Word for word, except substitute HRC for Biden.
What scares me the most is Joe Biden will not be scrutinized the same way Trump is. I'm afraid Joe Biden will lull people to sleep and he'll be able to violate human rights and there won't be a peep from the woke resistance folks and they'll chastise leftists for doing so.
I have a really bad feeling Joe Biden will do the same shit Trump is doing right now to violate our first amendment rights and the #Resistance will not say a word about it. They're rightfully vocal about Trump now, but once Joe Biden becomes president they'll be quiet.
If Joe Biden becomes president and there's still protests going on, do you think he'll sic the federal police onto them? And if he does, do you think liberals will cheer him on for doing so? Because I have no doubt the #Resistance folks will not resist that at all.
Because...they all look the same??? Racism, anyone?
I spent eleven years in the Asia-Pacific. Try calling a Japanese person "Chinese" or a Korean, "Japanese", and see how well that works out.
That doesn't even make any damn sense! Joe Biden served 8 years with a black president! Donald Trump is very obviously a racist! We'll see what America thinks
I wonder if Sanders realizes #FeebleJoe will say anything he's told to say at this point.
Thank God we need all the help we can get! Biden 2020!
Baseball statisticians track the number of pitches a pitcher can make before he starts to degrade. Biden must have a statistician that tracks the number of minutes he can talk before he goes off the rails.
Dont forget Biden and the rest. U clowns always aim at one party but not the rest  üôÉ Democrats  and Republicans  are the same people  on different  sides
Still pandering to niches in the Democrat party means his base is still shaky.
The only people who have been punked are Trump supporters who have fallen for his lies and bull s***! Biden 2020
Excuse me, but I hate Donald Trump! I think he's the biggest fraud, conman, crook, bully, divider in chief this country has ever seen! Biden 2020
Democrats' wet dream: Biden elected + 25th Amendment invoked = VP acts as President for up to 8 years. VP then runs in her own right for up to two more terms -&gt; Dems keep same person exercising powers of "President" for up to 16 years.
Biden has also been in washington the majority of his career... trumps been there 3 years.  anything else?
If the question is Trump or Biden, Biden is the answer.
i dont see biden deploying federal forces against americans.  or calling klan members good people. or consistently speaking against anyone who isnt white.  sorry, its not the "same bro"  AGAIN, im not fighting FOR biden.  theres a bigger picture here.
as i said... i dont know anyone voting FOR biden.  I'd much rather have bernie personally.  But its more than a vote just for president.
but obviously the choices suck... i dont know alot of biden "fans" but its understood what is the best option moving forward
or you look at the whole picture, its not just a vote for biden as president... but getting biden in office will help change alot of things in washington for the better.  thats how i look at it.
Work on China intelligence and you become good at finding seemingly small data points that say big things. Biden's livestream the other day attracted 19 viewers. Nineteen. That speaks volumes. The Dem convention is going to be a ratings disaster.
(3) the many presidents that practiced and profited off of the institution of slavery. Biden was better off not saying anything because this quote shows his lack of understanding of the impact of history on black and brown people.
For the people who voted for Trump, "normal politics" is the problem, not the solution.
I just listened to your donkey of the day on Joe Biden and I heard you say our country got to where it is because of old white men!! Did you forget that the man who ran this country before Trump was a Black man? At what point will black America start putting Obama
The tweet itself is silly because it‚Äôs happening now and they‚Äôre saying this would be Biden‚Äôs America lol.  It‚Äôs trump‚Äôs now at the moment lol
As an Independent, Biden is not my choice, but I will vote for him to get rid of trump's fat ignorant ass. The black community where I live, can't stand him.  trump only got 8% of the black vote in 2016. Compared to the majority of the black vote- Obama in '08 &amp; '12.
Joe Biden has a long to-do list if he wins the White House

The Joe Biden ad on ESPN during the Dodgers-Giants game was the first ad of his I've seen this whole election cycle while living here in Southeastern Virginia.
It‚Äôs still Biden 2020 for me, regardless of his comments

If you want to feel hopeful about the election, go to  and listen to the remarks of disaffected Republicans who are supporting Biden. Many also resolve to punish all Republican enablers. Good stuff.
Of course not!  Anyone that does is in worse shape mentally than Biden. Polls are run by the media, which is nothing more than the PR division of the DNC these days.
Hey idiot, this isn't happening under Joe Biden, its happening under Donald Trump. I know y'all aren't the sharpest tools in the shed but man... that's idiotic!
First one went to Biden,  second will be split between JoBi and Luria
Biden has been quiet on this actually, except for hes for adding more cops..
"One of the things that I think is important: I wish, I wish we taught more in our schools about the Islamic faith," Biden said. "What people don't realize is ... we all come from the same root here, in terms of our fundamental basic beliefs." Is what he actually said.
I got a call on my house phone (I need to get rid of)  about 2 months ago.   It took me until nearly the end to figure out how pro-trump it was, they ended up near the end referring to 'sleepy Joe Biden' and had shitty response options to some questions.
this country will never be a socialist nation EVER!  Trump will beat Biden and squash socialism like a bug so that it never becomes a thing and you can forget about using Denmark as an example cause they aren't socialist.
You mean like the Test Obama &amp; Biden just stopped doing during the H1N1 pandemic? Post the Tested / Tested positive rate vs. the death rate which is quickly dropping/ Your event failed...face it Trump wins easily in November. Look out for John Durham...

No Jake we just only tested the most people in the World to date and Trump is asking for additional money for even more testing. Guess he didn't just stop the test efforts like Obama &amp; Biden did. How about speaking the death trend vs. the # of people tested and or tested positive
Looks like Charlemagne the god confirmed today what we all knew about the Joe Biden candidacy, it's not about Joe, but his VP. Then he slams Kanye. ü§î
Highly unlikely. Biden has no hope other than politics. Trump has every reason to NOT be president. He just wanted the clout. He's got hundreds of millions (maybe billions) of reasons üíµ to leave if he loses and not a single reason to go to war. Biden on the other hand...
not too far away from early voting in a couple of these states.  I think both Michigan and Minnesota start 45 and 46 days before the election.   I really hope the Biden campaign really really pushes early voting hard.
The man literally donates his presidential fee (about $400K) to a different group every year. Does the presidency give him more clout? Sure. Will he ruin the country cuz he loses to Biden? Highly unlikely. The presidency isn't his only gig.
Obama didn't have the issues trump facing once he leave that white house, the man can say what he want right now but in a few months he gonna wish he kept his comments to himself. While trump fighting indictments Biden, his diverse administration go bring world leader title back

So you prefer a repeat of Obama ass-kissing every world leader to where we were a laughing stock.  Notice since he left office, we no longer have terror attacks here in the states. Biden is weaker than even Obama.

Biden raped somebody according to that somebody. How do women vote for people who grope women on actual video and have a rape case that kinda just "went away". And sadly, Tara Reid wasn't alone, but yeah #WOMENSRIGHTS
There is so much disparity between what Harris says and what she does...  She will be right at home in the Biden administration. Even that will be far, far better than anything the Trump administration would be.

I think any VP pick is going to get all of the vitriol they haven't been able to stick to Biden. Primarily because it will be a woman, but for multiple reasons.
We just had a 33% economic contraction, can‚Äôt travel to other countries, can‚Äôt safely see our parents, massive unemployment,&amp; bc of gross incompetence no end in sight to the virus with over 150k dead and 4 million cases. What could Biden possibly do to be worse?

Deer Vice President Biden. People need a road map on how to vote they need something in front of them it doesn't matter whether you're a Democrat or Republican but in order that people know how to fill these things out they must see it.
Trump didn't speak on election results until he saw it was impossible for him to beat Biden. We didn't hear nothing while he was campaigning for others. The man scared and his presidential powers can't do nothing to stop November 3 butt kicking

he's not going to be president IF they win.  minutes or no more than a day or two he will resign due to health and the vp will be president.  any one who votes for biden is voting for his vp  not him

Mail in ballots less stressful than running across a bunch of poll locations that's closed down or the voting machines not working so pick you poison all votes will count and the margin of difference in votes between Biden and trump will be self explanatory
Also it's basically 50 state elections. Even if some shit tier states like Mississippi or Oklahoma decide to go ahead with it, Biden probably gets enough electoral votes anyways.
I, for one, am happy to welcome anyone who has had a genuine change of heart into the fold.  I sincerely hope all the anecdotal evidence of "Former GOP"/"2016 Trump, 2020 Biden" voters is true.  If it is, and they vote as stated, there's a Dem Landslide coming.
No we mustn‚Äôt. For me, the dems could run a cardboard cut out of Biden and I‚Äôd vote for it. I‚Äôm not a Biden fan - he was not my top choice - but we need to get 45 out ASAP please and thank you.  Again, just my opinion
i hear you but voting for Biden is not possible.
It is very disappointing that Biden won't advocate for #MedicareForAll or do much about many important issues. However, it is very good to know that Biden won't use the Attorney General as his personal attorney, or award the Medal of Freedom to Rush Limbaugh, or commit treason.
Biden would be the downfall of the United States. He is senile and can't hold a coherent conversation, talks shit to his voters and acts better than everyone else. Joe is worse than Trump cuz at least Trump has balls

My guess is the media was told to start selling Harris and Politico let the cat out of the bag. So, let the pitch begin. Interesting that both Biden &amp; Harris have backgrounds in sending black people to jail. Is there a message there?

The general election is months away. She's in a primary race. Biden isn't yet the nominee.   Why does everyone rush things so far ahead of schedule?
Does the ballot machine magically change the vote from Jorgensen to Trump? Funny, cause Trump supporters say the machine magically changes from Jorgensen to Biden.
Also, most of the pollsters have adjusted their methodology, and most swing states are well outside the margin of error in favor of Biden right now, and Biden is outperforming Hillary by every objective measure.  Anything can change but DJT is losing right now.
I still think it‚Äôs wild that Biden leads in polls in Texas. But, this kind of close lead can make Texas a toss up.

And that‚Äôs just in winter 80,000 so we‚Äôre nowhere near that with COVID because all of last year the flu killed over 300,000 so how is that not serious. You gonna blame trump for the flu also? Probably. I‚Äôm a registered Democrat and I‚Äôm not voting for Biden because he‚Äôs a racist
You should learn to do some actual research the flu has killed more people this year than COVID-19 and I actually voted for Obama twice and Hillary in 2016 I just never had the hate for trump you and everyone else does. I‚Äôm a registered Democrat and joe Biden is a racist
The endgame is when the Republican nominee in 2024 actually knows how legislating and governing works, the Democrats aren't running the corpse of Joe Biden

Baseball statisticians track the number of pitches a pitcher can make before he starts to degrade. Biden must have a statistician that tracks the number of minutes he can talk before he goes off the rails.
Still pandering to niches in the Democrat party means his base is still shaky.
Democrats' wet dream: Biden elected + 25th Amendment invoked = VP acts as President for up to 8 years. VP then runs in her own right for up to two more terms -&gt; Dems keep same person exercising powers of "President" for up to 16 years.
Work on China intelligence and you become good at finding seemingly small data points that say big things. Biden's livestream the other day attracted 19 viewers. Nineteen. That speaks volumes. The Dem convention is going to be a ratings disaster.

Also it's basically 50 state elections. Even if some shit tier states like Mississippi or Oklahoma decide to go ahead with it, Biden probably gets enough electoral votes anyways.
I, for one, am happy to welcome anyone who has had a genuine change of heart into the fold.  I sincerely hope all the anecdotal evidence of "Former GOP"/"2016 Trump, 2020 Biden" voters is true.  If it is, and they vote as stated, there's a Dem Landslide coming.

i hear you but voting for Biden is not possible.
It is very disappointing that Biden won't advocate for #MedicareForAll or do much about many important issues. However, it is very good to know that Biden won't use the Attorney General as his personal attorney, or award the Medal of Freedom to Rush Limbaugh, or commit treason.

Because...they all look the same??? Racism, anyone?
I spent eleven years in the Asia-Pacific. Try calling a Japanese person "Chinese" or a Korean, "Japanese", and see how well that works out.
I wonder if Sanders realizes #FeebleJoe will say anything he's told to say at this point.
Baseball statisticians track the number of pitches a pitcher can make before he starts to degrade. Biden must have a statistician that tracks the number of minutes he can talk before he goes off the rails.
Still pandering to niches in the Democrat party means his base is still shaky.
Democrats' wet dream: Biden elected + 25th Amendment invoked = VP acts as President for up to 8 years. VP then runs in her own right for up to two more terms -&gt; Dems keep same person exercising powers of "President" for up to 16 years.
Work on China intelligence and you become good at finding seemingly small data points that say big things. Biden's livestream the other day attracted 19 viewers. Nineteen. That speaks volumes. The Dem convention is going to be a ratings disaster.
(3) the many presidents that practiced and profited off of the institution of slavery. Biden was better off not saying anything because this quote shows his lack of understanding of the impact of history on black and brown people.
Hi Eli, l agree 100%. Not one vote can be lost for Joe Biden. Our power is our vote. Each one is critical to save our democracy, our children &amp; our individual sanity. Enough is enough of trump &amp; his lemmings in the GOP They must be voted out to save our country. trump has failed!
For the people who voted for Trump, "normal politics" is the problem, not the solution.
The tweet itself is silly because it‚Äôs happening now and they‚Äôre saying this would be Biden‚Äôs America lol.  It‚Äôs trump‚Äôs now at the moment lol

Biden has been quiet on this actually, except for hes for adding more cops..
Obama didn't have the issues trump facing once he leave that white house, the man can say what he want right now but in a few months he gonna wish he kept his comments to himself. While trump fighting indictments Biden, his diverse administration go bring world leader title back
1. Joe Biden 2. Aubrey Plaza  That is all.
I really don‚Äôt like Biden man..
This is the America that trump created. We need Biden to Save this country. This will stop under Biden.

What I like about Kevin is that you can count on him to vote for Biden keleven times.
Biden has yet to be President.  Here's an idea, let's make Biden President and see how he does.  That sounds like a great idea, doesn't it Mo'Ronna?
I agree with the "get rid of all the old white guys you have working for you" part. the "Biden screwed up this VP search" not so much. He's taking his time and getting it right. Which he should, given that his pick will have a head start for Prez in 2024.

Biden didn‚Äôt beat anyone. He was a huge loser in 4th &amp; 5th til #Obama cleared the board. #Bernie shoulda booted Weaver but #Biden beat no one, he benefitted from election fraud and Obama/DNC fuckery. Boomers always make trash decisions so here we find ourselves
Right to vote. This is ur reason for asking me about where I‚Äôd rather be black at? Lol white people have a nerve and Nick Cannon said it best about u people. Evil and soulless. Voting Biden vs Trump. Both snakes. One u can see one hidden. White people are pure evil
This hype does not help matters. Biden will pick a woman. Biden will pick an African American woman.  Biden will pick a qualified running mate. Enough already.
Joe Biden as the Scarecrow? Like Trump doesn‚Äôt have a brain... or a heart, or any balls.
Just got an email from Trump saying we won't be safe in Biden's America... Can someone tell him who is currently POTUS right now?
I did hear that Biden has one who has testified that he raped him too, and there is video. I guess we‚Äôll see if it is released.
I appreciate the thread. I was (and am still) all in on Warren, but she‚Äôs as apt to get swept up in ridiculous Democratic infighting as any of her peers.   Purely in terms of the EC, Biden was probably always the best choice. I‚Äôm just dreading to see how the party blows this.
I don't understand how people think this #pandering is legitimate and that #Biden is any different from #Trump. #Color and #gender are not qualifications for office. I suppose it's enough to keep people distracted as they vie to show off how #woke they are.
Makes no difference to us. But you will not be in office come January. Biden is beating you by double digits.  The more you open your mouth, the worse it gets for you. Winning this last election is going to be you &amp; your families undoing!!!!!!! Orange Jumpsuits coming at ya!!
4 months. Just in time for Republicans to pretend they care about deficits again and then blame the breadline on Biden.   Nope.
especially should want to include a woman running for potus - who will be on the ballot in most or all states - in the debates.  Wouldn‚Äôt be very inclusive to keep her out.   And once Biden calls for it, trump will feel compelled to agree.  #JoJorgensen2020 #LetHerSpeak
Why don‚Äôt you talk policy. How will your healthcare plans compare to Biden‚Äôs. What are you going to do for our public schools? Are you going to keep your unqualified people in important positions. Quit name calling. It‚Äôs beneath the Office of the Presidency
Poor #Biden: the activists are like a bunch of hyenas---but I get a sense, too, that he's made himself easy prey. It's the usual identity craziness with the Dems. Biden should strongly consider who among the (female) candidates is actually qualified to be president. #VPick
Oh, I've listened. Keep making excuses.
Walking in on 15 year old girls so he can see them nude, and your only response is, "well he's crude " and "boys will be boys".  GTFOH.
Hey is that time trump talked about how attractive he thought Paris Hilton was (when she was 12) in there?
The activists have locked Biden into picking a AA female; the only question now is, which one? There's a decent chance his pick will be greeted by many with this response: "Who?"

MSM? These are Ivanka and Donald's own words as well as the words of his accusers. You can't blame this one on MSM.
Biden should be in a nursing home, not running for public office. He will never debate Trump.
5 underage girls: Trump walked into our dressing rooms to try to see us naked.  Ivanka: Yeah, dad does that.  Donald: yeah I do that, when you're the owner you can.  You: there seems to be nothing here.
All three of those things exist independently of the article. All five of the accusers are on record as are Don and Ivanka. There are recordings of them all saying these things. This isn't just some made up nonsense (like Qanon). It can and has been fact checked.
1. allegations (made by five girls in this case)  2. Ivanka admits her dad does this in an interview.  3. Trump brags about doing this exact thing.

If Clinton is guilty of child abuse he should rot in prison.   Also it's "right" there with you, commrade.
Why not let Biden pick who he wants and feels comfortable with? If it is Harris so be it. I do think they're better choices in my opinion. I like Susan Rice.
Keep pretending to care about child sexual abuse while making excuses for a career sexual predator who brags about walking into the dressing rooms of underage girls so he can see them undressed.

Honestly Trump is gonna win. Biden is that bad. Imo we need to stop focusing on the ballot box and figure out other ways to get these kids and people out of these detention centers
It's possible to be crazier, and regardless of a Biden win, the next Republican who will win will see crazier.   There may be stations to slow down for on the way to the cliff's edge, but this train isn't stopping until it does.
But Rice as VP could cost Biden the election also.  So there's that problem.

While Joe Biden was Vice President the GOP-held Congress and GOP-held Senate passed budgets that reduced police funding. The Vice President, Joe Biden, Mike Pence, or anyone else, has nothing to do with it.
Trump is a fascist. Joe Biden is not great, at all. But he‚Äôs not a fascist. So we all have to vote for Joe. We have to save the Democracy (as flawed as it is) and live to fight another day. I don‚Äôt understand why that‚Äôs so hard for people to understand.
Not all Republicans. Just people who still support President Agent Orange. I know Republicans who will be voting for Biden and loath trump

There is a reason Bill Clinton thinks he can talk reckless like this, and it's the exact same reason why Joe Biden is the Democratic nominee for President.
Progressive Coalition Urges Biden to Curb 'Excesses of Corporate Power' by Ending White House Revolving Door -
It‚Äôs a mortal lock that Biden knew about that remark in advance and had no problem with it.
I‚Äôm pretty sure that if they led to a slowing of resources it would also be a criminal offense. If Biden is elected a special council will be needed to investigate and prosecute this administration. It may be labeled political but it‚Äôs essential to bring these offenses out.
Just in case you're still undecided about our next election, here are some facts about the Obama/Biden years:
They were caught off guard in 2016, they‚Äôll go totally insane if Biden loses in Nov.  I think ppl expecting things to calm down after the election are going to be extremely disappointed.
This is a real issue for the Biden Admin. This creeping fascism that has infected the ranks of government agencies from the intelligence, law enforcement and, even more so, the public affairs offices, that see the American people and journalists as enemies to be targeted.
Guys come on. You don't have to write dumb shit like this that everyone knows is fake.  Biden os a scumbag segregationist, thats undeniable. But I dont think he would use secret police on us. Thats the only reason to vote for him.
The GOP do not want Trump reelected.  They want Biden so they can continue business as usual.  The money means nothing to them. They are in this for the power and influence, which pays super well far into the future.   The voters/peons don't count.

He doesn‚Äôt even meet with the incoming President. He enters his motorcade and Biden is put into a separate car. One is driven to the capitol; the other splits off and is taken to Reagan International.
I have a more optimistic, if slightly boring, opinion that he‚Äôll publicly contest the election results but come January 20th he‚Äôll simply leave. He won‚Äôt attend Biden‚Äôs inauguration, he‚Äôll simply board Marine One at noon and be flown to Florida for retirement.

I'm sorry to hear that. The bill passed with overwhelming Republican support from people like Mitch McConnell who have had tremendous power under Trump. Biden has endorsed Sen. Warren's bankruptcy reform plan. I haven't heard anything from Trump on this.

We are as left as we have ever been. Anyone who thinks Biden would be a republican 30 years ago obviously wasnt alive in 1990, or is too stupid to know better.
Voter shaming is silly and unproductive, much better to argue for harm reduction. Though ngl, if the simple argument that less people will die w/ Biden &amp; Dems in charge fails to convince a green party voter in a swing state, then I can't reasonably see them aligned with the left.
No.... Biden people are going to do everything to keep Biden from participating in a debate.
I cannot belive these would be Biden's allies.  Biden will not stand for it and I hope he chooses Kamala.
Joe Biden's inner circle is out here calling Kamala Harris an uppity negress but apparently Bernie Sanders was a racist
Mr. Biden, if you want my vote, we need a strong woman as an Vice President like Ms.
Most sinister explanation is that some who expect to Survive are salting the earth for Biden for their own long-term benefit. More likely an offering to prevent defection from ideologically far right supporters.
Biden sucks but unfortunately he‚Äôs the only chance we have of getting rid of trump.
Why are Boomers always patting themselves on the back making us pay for their na√Øvet√© and selfishness?? Y‚Äôall fought universal healthcare, debt relief to stimulate econ growth, Logic, and we‚Äôre paying the price. Y‚Äôall have us #Trump &amp; joke #Biden when we coulda had #Bernie

If Joe Biden wants to lead, he needs to specifically decry the violence in Portland and Seattle and call on local officials to stop it, writes
Wat is the point if u don‚Äôt fight when it‚Äôs hard? He‚Äôll be remembered for fumbling the ball and shilling for a subtle fascist so how is it good for legacy to call for revolution then fail to throw a punch at dem estab? They‚Äôll blame him no matter wat &amp; give no cred if #Biden wins
So that means every network will provide wall-to-wall coverage.     Will Biden be saying a few words?  LOL.
Love the Repubs saying "See Portland? That's what America will look like under Biden!". Well, excuse me but that's what it looks like under TRUMP!
There's no evidence that Hunter's position affected how VP Biden did his job, but VP Biden should have prevented him from taking the job to avoid the appearance  of impropriety.
As far as Hunter Biden is concerned, it's not unheard of for businessmen to get these really cushy positions, especially with foreign companies trying to give themselves an air of legitimacy.
There is no ‚Äúwhataboutism ‚Äú trump is objectively a moron. He speaks in literal word salad. And these would all stand true whether or not joe Biden‚Äôs senile ass wasnt running for president. You assume I love joe Biden that‚Äôs your first mistake hombre
The recent image of Biden being led, with a big grin on his face, by a young lady that seemed to be responsible for him was disturbing. She looked to me like she was in caregiving mode. yes. He is a mascot. What‚Äôs their plan?
It seems there is a lack of transparency about health issues, both with Hillary and with Biden. Why does their party nominate these two people with compromised health that are clearly not strong for a demanding job? It makes me think ‚Äòthey‚Äô want to control them.
It‚Äôs not really hard to figure out... #Biden was a huge loser before #Obama cleared the field.  dropped out so she wouldn‚Äôt be embarrassed when #Bernie owned her in her own state lol. Full stop. She had no campaign.  supporters you‚Äôd think would be mad
What does any of this have to do with Joe Biden's mental fitness?
Regarding Joe Biden's recent comments:
I mean she should be thinking about the Presidency. BIDEN is a one term bridge. That's common knowledge, right?
I can‚Äôt vote for trump but I also can‚Äôt vote for Biden. I‚Äôm voting  #VoteGold #VoteGold2020 #NeverTrump #NeverBiden #NeverBidenNeverTrump #JoJorgensen2020
i will 100% be guilted into voting for biden by my partners and out of spite to my republican relatives but i really will think i did something terrible every time a poor person dies from a lack of healthcare
Trump is a moron. He rambles in about nonsense every time he openes his mouth . I didn‚Äôt say anything about Biden you did but thanks for playing
no because biden is going to win easily in virginia and most nonvoters are poor, POC, and disenfranchised despite the false narrative the DNC likes to uplift
i'm probably gonna vote for biden too but god these people are trash and i can't help but agree with people who refuse to vote for biden tbh
Yeah, but Biden will implement a federal mask mandate.  #Reno #LasVegas
They are mutually exclusive questions. tRump can be (is) nuts. That does not have anything to do with whether or not Biden has diminished mental capabilities.
Since it takes a few years and a lot of money to do this maybe Biden will be President reverse this  and can keep the troops in Germany.
Um... isn't Biden a former VP focusing on becoming President, who ran twice before 2020?
Meaty "Crimate Clisis?" üòÇüòÇ
Trump is hard at work destroying the equal rights rules that Obama/Biden passed while in office.  He rescinded the AFFH rule in order to keep less affluent people out of certain neighborhoods.  It‚Äôs very unfair, the way Dumpy likes it. #TrumpIsANationalDisgrace  üåä
Bruh... y‚Äôall look dumber and dumber as u keep saying this and we express our hatred for joke #Biden rejecting all our policies &amp; cozying up to corp heads. Do u even pay attention?? #UnitedLeft
is deteriorating fast.  He's blind now.  #Biden
Biden will shut it down.
how is this not a joke?  the lefty voting bloc not voting do so because they resent constantly settling for centrists  1. they've been alienated from the dems &amp; nothing will change their minds 2. moreso you couldn't come up with a worse imperative than "settle for biden"  üòÇ
No #Biden and the  are but sure be angry at folks putting their foot down as centrists condemn ppl to die w/o healthcare w/#M4A. I mean u think we‚Äôre supposed to vote against life &amp; death policy? Ur a joke
Playing three Biden spots back to back to back during Tucker smells of desperation.

Biden expected to choose running mate next week
it's remarkable, right? Trump could definitely pump his approval rating &amp; challenge Biden by being an effective leader against coronavirus. It would be easy--he could just follow Fauci &amp; CDC. Nihilism is even more important than ratings. I think people often miss this.
I think the Washington Post's Opinion writer meant to say  "Biden's election will begin a national nightmare" !!!!!!
The look on this young woman‚Äôs face is that of a caregiver. She is responsible for Biden.
This is despicable, should be condemned in the harshest possible language, and reversed in the first days of the Biden administration. #AFFH
How disingenous. I agree Biden's remark crossed the line. He recognized it and apologized. Robert Byrd is a tale of redemption. That man grew up as a racist, held those views for a long time, then had a distinguished career of fighting for civil rights legislation.
Shut up, #nevermypresident.  Obama and Biden would not have fueled the fires of racism in a deadly pandemic like you have, so they will #ALWAYSBEMYPRESIDENTS.  Resign.
what do Joe Biden and Levar Stoney have in common? they want your money, they want your vote, and they want you to go home and be quiet while they go back to making task forces neither empowered nor intended to stop cops from killing Black people
Why can't Joe Biden walk without assistance?
üíØ. Biden should have primaried Donald as a Republican. The way moderates flock to him now show how his policies have always been ‚ÄúRepublican-Moderate‚Äù
Bots for Bidenüëáüèæ
Does he tho cuz this last week or two where he parrots #Trump on protesters and keeps kicking us in the face... I‚Äôm done w/ him &amp; every other centrist. Dems won‚Äôt get my votes in Nov cuz none in my district I can stomach voting for. VBNMW can cry to #Biden abt it. üòë
But ‚Äòvote for #Biden cuz climate change‚Äô lol
My wife was interested in the Ternary operator last night.  Getting her to even glance at a computer screen is akin to getting Trump to endorse Biden üòÇ.
There is a chance Biden will win. And then, it will be like when Obama won in 2008. Antiwar movement straight disappeared over night. I worry we will lose momentum
Indeed. Just ask Biden.
#Biden isnt the left and he proves his daily so do u think we‚Äôre allies?? We aren‚Äôt
He just rejected #MedicareForAll again!! In a pandemic refused marijuana legalization &amp; told corporations he‚Äôll propose no legislation to rein them in. You are the clown and FUCK #Biden!! Go cry to him for being so shit &amp; corrupt!
WHOOPS! Politico Accidentally Publishes Article Revealing Who Biden Picked As His VP
I think we still gotta vote BUT only for grassroots lefties and focus on primarying these clowns. Voting for #Biden won‚Äôt help anything tho yea
its gonna rule when Biden wins   fascists will be pissed and out in the street, and the liberals will declare victory and form a pincer attack on anyone to the left of them
hey  remember when we said Joe Biden isn't any better than Trump?  we meant it
A center-right candidate already is... joke #Biden. lol and scrambling to prove ur not one is a waste of time cuz they‚Äôre gonna call u that regardless so maybe stop caring what Repubs think. #Trump is bad for us #Biden is bad for us, full stop. Incrementalism is BS
Keep laughing, that will change after Biden's landslide in November.
Michigan is Likely D.
No, not even close. Biden is an angel compared to Trump.
Yeah cuz she trash. I‚Äôm already having a hard time with Biden .. this won‚Äôt help
Imagine thinking Biden is doing anything "radical" or "left."  Amazing.
Biden is gonna pick Kamala Harris isn‚Äôt he?
You would say that about any Democratic candidate. Biden is a good man unlike Trump who has no clue and no empathy
Always follow the dtRump money trail &amp; the costs to US taxpayers. When he loses in November watch the international lenders come after him finally.  VOTE BLUE VOTE BIDEN
She shared this in 2013. I fully supported a Biden presidency in 2013. Now I've gotten more involved in politics and realized that the DNC does not stand for what I thought it did. Have you never changed your opinion on something over the course of 7 years?

‚Äòthugs, with the help of accomplices on extreme right seek to turn PEACEFUL protests into violent civil unrest so Trump can get footage for his campaign ads that warn of what a fictitious Biden America will look like, while featuring what an actual Trump America looks like now.‚Äô

False equivalency, it not that I don't hate Trump, it's that you like Biden
I dont think there are a grip of Bernie supporters who are "RidenWithBiden." I would say less than 25%, at the most! That means there are MILLIONS of votes these fools are just blowing off. If Biden loses, he has only himself to blame, not progressives. YOU have to earn my vote!
With Joe Biden, who is going to veto M4A, is to the right of Regan with his crime bill, is for segregating schools.. the list goes on. He's a republican.
Only 3% of Bernie's supporters have donated to Biden's campaign......I'm with the 97% who haven't.....
No, it means I was in a hurry, dude are you alright, you've been screaming in caps a lot.  Do you need a hug.. obviously not from Biden, no one wants their hair sniffed a a close friend of cornpops

Biden vows to fight racial inequality with economic agenda
I am so sickened with the DNC today. I cannot in good conscience vote for Biden. I'm stunned at how tonedeaf the DNC is on medicare for all and cannabis legalization/releasing for related crimes. Stop telling people they're selfish for no longer believing in electoral politics.
What an odd tweet. I think the mean "Random people on Twitter that are probably fake are saying they won't for Biden"
If you can name one democrat who could do a better job, then I'll agree! Name the person and the change that would have made any difference, I'll listen! In my opinion, if Biden was in charge you can triple the numbers of deaths, and burn this country down.
Can Biden be Inaugurated November 4th..üôÑ Asking for a friend..please!!
Nothing wrong with notes. Biden did a fabulous job today. Such a statesman.
why shouldn't the republicans act exactly like the democrats have the last 4 years?  especially if Biden wins?  it works acting like spoiled brats who didn't get their way.

This was interesting to me.  The ‚Äúrepublican‚Äù that is supposed to speak at the DNC convention on behalf of Biden who won‚Äôt be there is saying that John McCain was put to death and we all saw the wrinkled flag at his funeral. #WWG1WWA
sweet so I don‚Äôt have to vote for Biden lmao
Yep. Just let Trump talk. The contrast is striking. I watched Biden today. He was fabulous on his feet. Such a statesman. I so look forward to a Biden administration.

My Dad cast his first vote for Reagan and has consistently voted Republican since then. He voted for Trump thinking that the office would change him. Now he's trying to decide between Biden and staying home.
It's the quotes attributed to the Biden campaign that makes my eyebrows jump up and down ridiculously
Pretty obvious at this point that Biden's admin is gonna be full of cops no matter what.

Good thing Science studies the human brain. Biden should look into that research...
That's a hell of an assumption to make for why voters voted for Joe Biden.  Based on ... what, exactly?
I wonder if Biden would have the courage to choose vice president based on qualifications and ability to pick up the reins in four years as he has indicated he may not run again... to me something insulting about idea he ‚Äúshould pick a black woman‚Äù since he has some good choices.
Unbelievable that there are those who at least say that Biden is a viable candidate.
If Biden picked Michelle Obama, I'll be in line Nov. 1 to cast my vote. I'll be there on the 3rd regardless.
Listening to Joe Biden and jjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjj oops I fell asleep
That is a real possibility. Thankfully  is right now speaking out against the violent rioters and pointing out how Trump has tried to spin that narrative to try to paint Biden as the one responsible (as if this were on his watch rather than Trump‚Äôs!)
She is a Bernie bro and I hope she loses too. Joe Biden 2020!

Biden is speaking now. Uplifting as it should be; hopeful, caring, loving. But I am whipped at the moment. Luckily our fight is never hinged on only one person, but on all of us. When we need a breather, we just take it. WE are a team, the best team in the world. ‚ù§‚öñ‚ù§

They, both Obama and Biden would do anything to save face with any race except black gl folks. They can sympathize with everyone except us. Hell, we might as take it our chances with Trump. At least u can see the snake rather than the hidden one

I may tweet this everyday too:   "I understand the point about not getting too overhyped about polling, but think about this for a second: Let's say Trump was LEADING in the polls and Biden's numbers were terrible. The talking points would be VERY different right about now."
Again, I'm not defending Trump. He's worse than anyone, including Biden. But not by much.
Is Biden president yet? No? Well then why is Biden being brought up? I thought we were talking about trump? And who said I was voting for Biden either xD but it‚Äôs always Biden since you don‚Äôt want to see anything wrong with Trump xD they‚Äôre both creepy but don‚Äôt act like Trump
I wonder if they would have flagged one of Biden's kids, oh wait they would never do such a thing
I might add that your descriptions of Trump fit Biden very well, too. You'd have to assess his past objectively to realize this, though. Good luck out there.
I‚Äôm desperately hoping that Biden will pick her to be his VP. I mean, I‚Äôm still voting for Biden whoever he chooses, but please God or whoever let it be

The only way that Joe Biden will be elected is by massive voter fraud from the left. No person in their right mind would even consider voting for this buffoon!
I don't speak for all the #KHive but for me I'd still be all in for Biden regardless who he chooses. And my guess on most of the #KHive will still vote for Biden but they won't be as excited to do so especially if the isn't a black women, like no more donations to the Biden camp.
You seriously can‚Äôt even consider that the lack of equality Biden is referring to has EVERYTHING to do with small minded people like you diminishing women‚Äôs struggles?   You really think there is equality??  You. Are. So. Narrow. Minded, man. Get it together.
Democrats didn‚Äôt even give them a decent candidate. Just picked Joe Biden cuz he was Obama VP. Now they got him backing his boy like that‚Äôs what the people really want. There were more qualified candidates....
Said who? Polls are very very very very in favor of Biden, if the current polls were wrong by the margin in 2016 he‚Äôd win 370 electoral votes.
Denial is dangerous; a significant percentage of the middle class‚Äî ‚Äúdecimated‚Äù and otherwise‚Äî are highly suggestible to the narrative Trump is creating. Nothing less than a Biden landslide can reverse the  ongoing slide into authoritarianism.

We never cared what he personally wanted if it‚Äôs something weak and harmful. It was about policy, it‚Äôs always about policy NOT #Bernie, we aren‚Äôt sports fans or celeb stalkers like shallow libs, we hold even HIM accountable cuz ppl are going to die cuz of his weakness  on #Biden
I kno and I disagree but his reporting on #Biden is excellent and he does call it out but yea  is my #1 for always calling them out relentlessly I mean aside from  1  2  3  and I WISH they had run the whole campaign
The images you see are not what large percentage of voters see. Fox has largest # of viewers if I am not mistaken, and they are making their point using clips from CNN minimizing &amp; excusing violence. (CNN correctly seen as propaganda outlet for Biden as Fox is for Trump).
Biden wants to increase funding to police for better training...
A Biden Victory in 100 Days Would Destroy America. Here's Why. - Trump Train News
He is not losing the narrative with large percentage of voters. He is winning with them, Biden‚Äôs lead is already narrowing.
True but those on the fence will not see it that way. They are confused about who is responsible. By minimizing the violence &amp; making excuses for it CNN is helping Trump; giving fodder to Fox News; reinforcing narrative that Biden supports ‚Äúrioters.‚Äù Trump‚Äôs strategy is working.
I gotta tweet this again:  "I understand the point about not getting too overhyped about polling, but think about this for a second: Let's say Trump was LEADING in the polls and Biden's numbers were terrible. The talking points would be VERY different right about now."
According to you a vote for anyone besides Biden is a vote for Trump so...   Won't Trump will be up there lol
What if the 88% that want #MedicareForAll don‚Äôt vote for Biden. How about we end the norm of voting for these dipshits who tell us to our face that they don‚Äôt care about us.   They keep telling us NO, why should we tell them YES on Election Day?
Virginia voting for Biden 100% absofuckinglutly

My take: Tammy Duckworth is Biden's best possible pick for VP.
Is it crazy to think that Biden might be looking to appoint Sen. Harris to the Supreme Court?
Biden has a distinguished record of inclusion and the ability to work with everyone. Try again.
So that means in effect you'll be voting for Trump. List something that Biden did lately that causes you to think he's a racist.
What does stuttering have to do with Biden talking about nurses BREATHING INTO HIS NOSTRILS to get him to move???  You're nuts if you think Americans can't see that he's cognitively impaired and GETTING WORSE.

I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll enjoy standing in Soviet style breadlines if idiot Biden is positioned in. You‚Äôll have to choose what you need the most.....food, Rx‚Äôs, or gasoline(if you think actually you would be allowed to have a car-I don‚Äôt think you will, though.)you are a sad sad man.
Biden is owned by the Chinese. We lose America and our freedom if democrats take over. They are evil.
Lying and cover ups are her strengths so she would fit in a Biden administration well.
Gotta admit, I like "BEAT BIDEN OFF" more than "Build Back Better"
You keep acting as it Trump is worse than Biden, which to me suggests you don't read history or you haven't been at this long. Because, I'd say Biden is worse with a much farther reaching negative impact on the US and the world at large. You not seeing that is your problem.
They're gonna shoot a hellfire missile at the Biden inauguration bloc
A contested election is also a threat to our democracy:
Pandering Biden portrays women as inferior victims; Trump creates an economy that provides women high paying job opportunities.   My decision to vote Trump in November is the best choice for all women.

Joe Biden is just a light version of republican. But hopefully he is the bridge to someone that will bring real change to the country.
I think the left has some infiltrated posters. Have been reading that Chinese bot farms are posting anything they can to defeat and deflate our cause. CPP really wants biden in, for obvious reasons. We may have to go to camouflage to push them away.
That's simply not true. Biden is nothing like Trump. The difference between the parties are bigger now than at any other time in my life. Biden is the right guy at the right time
SO GLAD to hear good news with this! After seeing Ted Cruz talk about how much Biden is trying to take Texas&amp;if he does-the election could be over for Trump I was really worried the recent spikes would be the push for mail ins they needed. Thank goodness things are looking up.
Vote for Biden, he ain't perfect but at least he won't teargass peaceful protestors so he can get his picture taken in front of a church while holding a Bible upside down.
The Democrats passed the Heroes bill 2 months ago. The Republicans can‚Äôt manage any aspect of this crisis. A Biden landslide win will occur in November.
Trump, the sexual harasser, actually said Biden would end religion. There's no bottom to Trump‚Äôs lies.
Vote Biden to end this reign of terror
meanwhile, in Virginia,  Northam, Richmond Mayor  and CA  McEachin - *all Democrats* - have enabled and supported repression of protesters. Are y‚Äôall just going to be cool with it when Joe Biden takes over and does the same shit nationally?
Anyone who has ever done business with Trump knows this is how he operates. He doesn‚Äôt care about the expense of others. It looks like NC is going for Biden, which makes a lot of sense.
I have brought as many as I could into the fold. Some are still not believers. I look at it like this - the first American Revolution had resistant Tories who wanted to believe King George 111 was a good guy. He wasn‚Äôt. We have idiots still who like Biden. He is not a good guy.

I would love to see Wallace interview Biden.
Just few things I‚Äôm watching. Biden reminds me of Rudolph Giuliani. Trump talk crazy which incites ignorance upon people who cannot free think. Then he hides. But true evil,, not sure. They are all evil per Nick Cannon
All lies. Open borders is a lie, Biden is not in favor of defunding the police...even trump had to admit that, people illegally in the country already have an option to go to a hospital for treatment.
I‚Äôm saying, you would have to do the same thing with all presidents. Including Clinton. Reagan so on. But u know, just thoughts. Like I said I definitely don‚Äôt like Biden so
Stop following then...would've been a great interview with Biden üëé
Actually done wrong. Besides talking dumb. IDK, not saying I‚Äôm going with the whole maga again but I‚Äôm just saying..... haven‚Äôt seen much from Biden you know.  I‚Äôm not trying to fight off a mob lol but, yea. Just saying
Hahahah... Trump did not do great. He looks like a complete idiot to the entire world.  Wallace is a great interviewer and I am sure he would do much the same with Biden... but it‚Äôs so sad to think you believe Trump did great.
Why should Biden be interviewed by Fox then? Personally, I would love to see Chris Wallace interview Biden‚Ä¶but don‚Äôt scream about one and not the other.
We give money to McGrath, Gideon, Harrison, Biden, Spanberger, and Warner. I think Spanberger, and Warner will retain their seats, but do you believe can we actually defeat McConnell, Graham, and Collins?
Absolutely. It‚Äôs at a point where ‚Äúcompetent administration‚Äù is the bar for heroism.  And, in a twist, Biden spent a good chunk of his time as VP building relationships with the medical research community. At minimum, the man knows who to call for responding to COVID.
What makes you think that?  Obama met with Castro! I think it is entirely possible Biden admin could end sanctions on both  Cuba and Venezuela    in a couple years
I dreamed that Biden won Kansas last night. Yes sometimes I dream about election nights. If that were the case, what other Trump states would he win? What was the D net gain in the house? How many Senate seats do they have?
Yea. I‚Äôm not MAGA. Malcom x spoke about the Democratic Party so not feeling Biden and I do agree with the prison reform.also, Jennifer Hudson, the compassion he showed towards her when her family died. Biden is terrible.
Lord. Have mercy thought he was pro black. While i do not support trump or Biden. But yea, he‚Äôs for sure not the worse. But why do men come from Harriet? Jealous, pride, not sure about that. Like Harriet Tubman who does that
Biden is a weak, feeble idiot.   #FoxNews  #Biden #Philly
I've applied in VA already. Either way, I will vote for Joe Biden  hell or high water.
It pains me to see people say they won‚Äôt vote for Biden. When you choose to not vote for him and dump gets re-elected do NOT complain. #EveryVoteMatters
100 Reasons Not to Vote for Joe Biden
Seems as though that ship has sailed. Maybe we can get our mojo back if Biden is elected.
I'm not a Chris wallace fan at all! That said, He would destroy Biden within 20 minutes. Biden would challenge him to pushups, since he couldn't actually answer hard questions!

Yes, that is exactly what he is going to do. He will attempt to create a shooting war. Joe Biden will be sworn in and begin day one of his Presidency at a location other than the White House. I don't think you realize what is in front of us.
This is how cowards live. I hope President Biden has this monstrosity disassembled in Week 1.
(That sentence was ‚Äúthe good thing about Biden is he‚Äôll at least come in ready to maneuver the administrative state on day 1.‚Äù I‚Äôll take that + not a cell for foreign influence or a demogorgan..‚Äù

And what will it take to get Trump to do an interview with CNN or MSNBC? He keeps refusing them.  I, for one, would like to see Biden on Fox‚Ä¶ I would also like to see Trump on CNN or MSNBC
He said he was JILL Biden‚Äôs husband. Looks like someone needs to clean the wax out of thier ears.
She was one of the first presidential candidates to drop out because the country doesn't really like her. No conservatives like her, and 40%-50% of liberals don't like her. Biden would be stupid to pick her to be vice president.
I‚Äôm not thrilled about  forcing unskippable 20-minute Trump ads on every video I try to watch. The Biden ads can be skipped or hidden but not the Trump ones. Says a lot about Google...
Check this here üëá  I understand the point about not getting too overhyped about polling, but think about this for a second: Let's say Trump was LEADING in the polls and Biden's numbers were terrible. The talking points would be VERY different right about now.
Problem for Biden is any red state that is close will likely 1) reduce polling places, 2) reduce mail in voting, and 3) request trumps secret police to ‚Äúquell Election Day bad actors‚Äù.
How many is Biden?
You can say anything you want ... it's a free country.   But, I'm still voting for Trump and I predict a landslide.  Biden is too senile to be President and most Americans know that.
No you're not. You've already voiced your opposition to Biden which means, no matter who you vote for, you're ultimately supporting Trump.
So.... when is Biden gonna pick a VP candidate dang
Dude, you are hiding in your basement.  #Trump2020 &gt; #Biden

Yeah, I think Biden still not having announced his running mate is ridiculous too.

Great activist? Maybe. But he let the district he ran go to hell, didn‚Äôt do much for the people who lived there. Took huge donations even when he ran unopposed and supported people like Biden when he railed against desegregation and busing .
I‚Äôm confused. I thought liberals LOVED taxing the rich. Biden said his economic plan would be paid for in part by taxing the WEALTHY.

Uncontrolled pandemic, rogue Federal agents, unemployment and no health insurance , violence by white supremacists.. In Biden's America the main cause of all of this will be in prison.
I think some of us care about this VP pick more than ever because Biden will be the oldest POTUS by far in history. Can't afford to get it wrong.

I've seen alot of videos of people who voted for him in 16 who will be voting for Biden now. People with intelligence who admit they made a mistake. But the far right, kool aid drinking, mask throwing racist mfers won't leave his side.
I'm old enough to remember when I was told repeatedly that Kamala should just be Biden's VP and now that she's under consideration for exactly that - she's now too "ambitious". It's so blatantly sexist but honestly can't say I'm surprised. Happy Friday!!!!
I still don‚Äôt think Biden has a chance in November. It‚Äôs hard to energize a fan base when your only platform is ‚ÄúOrange man is bad‚Äù. I still can‚Äôt believe they rolled his old ass out there. Almost feel sorry for him
Biden doesn‚Äôt want this either!! ü§®
I've been going back and forth these last few days between Kamala and Susan Rice,although I believe Rice would be a better fit For Biden.She has a lot of baggage and her pick would be going back in the past.Kamala is the safer pick.
Choosing only from candidates of one gender is #sexist. Joe Biden has a long history of supporting America‚Äôs #fascist policies &amp; is no friend of the left. He supports the wanton slaughter of #black children through his steadfast support of the racist Planned Parenthood org.
If Biden don't pick Kamala Harris now the backlash will be brutal.I've been following politics for 40 years and I have never seen a potential VP pick being torn apart by there on party like this.
Biden has accomplished basically zip in his four plus decades as a politician. Really don‚Äôt want a guy as POTUS who can barely speak coherently at times.
It comes down to this, is Donald J Trump or  Creepy Joe Biden going to be the next president.
Biden's Opponent is speaking at a mask-less mini rally in the epicenter of the pandemic with no social distancing. I'm not sure killing off your supporters is a good idea, but OK.
"The survey, it‚Äôs worth noting, was conducted July 28 to 30, mostly before Trump‚Äôs tweet about delaying the election. If anything, these gaps will likely widen in the wake of his incendiary suggestion." Which is EXACTLY why he made it.
This is NOT Biden's America ..

Why did your administration allow money to go to Wuhan? Why did you oppose Trump‚Äôs closure of the border and call him a racist? Sounds like YOU Biden will be far worse ‚Äúleader‚Äù. Maybe if he got his son a good job or money from a foreign country..good?
It would be great if some Democratic men- namely Biden stood up and said something.
Like who TF do these people think they are? They got destroyed and embarrassed. Biden did zero campaigning in many of the key states he won and Bernie had way more money. STFU and go away
Probably more predicated on gender, I was curious if my amount of face masks was excessive. But, like  I have designated them into various uses: RBG=Court appearances; Puppy motif=meetings w/ my child clients; VoteBlue/Biden mask=annoy my neighbors; etc.

You evidently know nothing about Biden. Just listening to him speak is proof he has a cognitive issue. Do a little research before calling just one of them terrible.
This is the unfortunate truth Biden folks, #resistance folks, #KHive trolls, blue wavers will not understand. Even if Trump loses, people will suffer and we'll still face the constant fear of getting sick and having no medical insurance because Joe will not enact #MedicareForAll
The only thing Republican lite Democrats care about is taking control for 4 more years to replace RBG and stopping SCOTUS turn even more far to the right. By that time, people will die needlessly and families will face financial ruin as Joe Biden does little to help us.
What's depressing is conservative Democrats are not fighting to make this country a better place to live for those of us struggling in this crisis. Biden has made no promises to uplift and help us as we're facing an eviction crisis and a healthcare crisis. Nothing will change.
It goes to show you how weak Joe Biden is that his minions on Twitter have to comes to his defense because he's such a terrible candidate. Do you think Trump will be as kind as Biden's critics on the left? They're already calling him a socialist, which is laughable.
It's bad enough to having to choose between the two despite the outcome being the same: death by a lack of healthcare access. What's insulting is when Republicans disguised as Democrats tell me I can't tell the truth about Joe Biden because it'll help Trump.
The cold hard truth conservative Democrats are refusing to admit is even if Biden wins there's still going to be suffering under his administration. All they have is "damage reduction", but what they don't say is hundreds and thousands more will die all in order replace RBG.
Sexism shadowed Kamala Harris' rise to power. It's an experience that could prepare her well for future campaign battles against Trump.  via
Show me a tweet about Biden that I originated?
I'm absolutely terrified they will especially if Biden's VP pic isn't to the liking of everyone. I have my VP preferences but whoever he pics I'll still be voting for him. No matter what Trump is exponentially worse than anyone Biden can pic.
I am new to the KHive, so please excuse me if I ask a stupid question. Why do they continue disruptive behavior if we are supposed to be on the same side? After these last 3 1/2 years, you'd think they would work w/the best team to win (Biden/Harris).
This is why I am VOTING for you VP Biden‚úùÔ∏èüôèüèæ
So you honestly believe Joe Biden can win the election without the Democrats cheating. The man cannot even string together a coherent sentence. Change your mind you say, just think of that objectively. Not a complete sentence is he capable of putting together...

Who went Biden Island and took the fast boat to Epstein Island?
'the polls were off In 2016.' yeah no, michigan and pennsylvania were both within the margin of error. Wisconsin was the only state off. Biden now doubles Hillary's lead compared to this time 2016, ESP in the rust belt, and Biden leads in almost every swing and even TEXAS

And as far as I'm concerned, the American people will suffer no matter who wins, and there's no amount of shamming coming from you that will change that unfortunate reality. Biden or Trump, people will die from a lack of healthcare access.
Biden said he would veto Medicare For All and the DNC has voted down any measures of enacting a single payer healthcare systems, along with many other progressive and popular ideas that were rejected. That's not the fault of someone critiquing that insanity. That's on Biden.
Oh, so it's her fault that Biden is looking less electable because of his inadequate policy proposals and not Biden himself? It's because of her criticism and not because Biden has said time and time again he doesn't care about our needs in this crisis we're in right now?
This is the same face we're all making knowing Joe Biden will never fight for #MedicareForAll.
Then why are you on her case when she says Joe Biden will increase our premiums? She's not helping Trump when she points out Joe Biden doesn't plan on doing anything about our healthcare system even in the middle of a pandemic.
That's not her job to make Joe Biden less shitty. It's on Joe Biden himself.
We're not allowed to say Joe Biden's healthcare policy, or lack of, is not sustainable given that we're in a pandemic? Are we not allowed to demand better from the presumptive nominee?
This is who Joe Biden and Kamala Harris attracts. I'll be damned if this is who we have to unite with in order to defeat Trump. A bunch of bitter, hateful, self-absorbed trolls that don't think we're actual people. We don't matter to them. They sound just like Republicans.
Will Biden even make it until then?  His feebleness and addled demeanor is clearly quickly increasing.  The question is, who would really be president IF he is elected?
The truth to them is like God's Word is to demons. They don't want exposure or to answer for their crimes against America &amp; its people. Trump didn't play their game &amp; refused to be their puppet. Dems won't tolerate this &amp; Joe Biden is willing to be their puppet.
Are u a Biden fan or Bernie ?
Now do Joe Biden‚Äôs use of the term ‚ÄúShylocks‚Äù
You realize people are unemployed because of something completely out of anyone‚Äôs control. People continue to stay on unemployment because of the money the government is offering. Not to mention the same people who back Biden are the reason for unemployment.
Yeah, sure. Whatever you say loser. The only BIG thing happening now is the amount of losing that you're doing to Joe Biden.  Hold the L jackass.
Oh I read it correctly, it just doesn‚Äôt make sense lmao. What will Biden give back? Trump has lowered unemployment, created jobs, the list goes on he is continually giving back to us. If you disagree I‚Äôd like to see the facts as to how he has taken away from society.
Hopefully the withdrawal is cancelled when Biden steps foot in the WH. He doesn‚Äôt take orders from Putin.
I‚Äôm just sorry you‚Äôre believing these lies that Biden can somehow help our country. The proof is in the facts. I still haven‚Äôt heard a good reason as to why he‚Äôs better. You‚Äôre just proving my point Biden supporters have no idea what they‚Äôre talking about.
Just say you have no good reason as to why Biden is the better candidate without bashing trump and his supporters.
Fucken pc of shit!! Vote please biden 2020
please give me five good reasons how Biden is better without bashing Trump, because trust me nobody believes he‚Äôs the better choice. Trump has done far more for Americans than Biden has in his 30+ years of office. if he can make America better why hasn‚Äôt he tried to already?
A whole 247 watching Biden!! Wow!
‚ÄúAccording to calculations, a female VP would only make about 78 cents for every dollar we'd usually pay a male vice president.   ‚ÄòIt shows that Biden is serious about getting the most bang for the taxpayers' buck‚Äô.‚Äù
Maybe trump should be secluded (detained?) during the election results until Biden emerges as the clear winner...
Registered for my mail in ballot yesterday. I'm an independent. I look forward to my vote for Biden being counted.
Biden won‚Äôt.   He doesn‚Äôt even know where he is...
I think it's going to be  because we don't see her anywhere and Kamala is all over the place.I just have this feeling that Biden is going to throw us a curve ball.
Joe Biden's team is simply waiting for a plausible excuse to duck out of the debates. They can't "call in sick", that would show how weak he is. They're probably hoping for an even bigger National Emergency in the hopes that the Media would say debates are "irresponsible". üòê

the most ironic thing about people telling you you have to vote for Biden, because he‚Äôs the only way to get Trump out of office, is that ALOT of these people supported MUCH less popular Dems instead of settling for the much more popular choice against Biden.
But he says Biden is unfit because he mistakenly said Arizona is a city.
He‚Äôs directly responding to Biden‚Äôs plan to ban single-family housing, to effectively get rid of those racist suburbs! Context is a nice thing.
at this point, Biden is the ONLY chance this country has ..
Thank you, stranger lady at lunch who decided to give me her unsolicited opinion on ‚ÄúBiden‚Äôs socialist America.‚Äù I needed a laugh today.
why don't the Democrat just run an ad:.  Don't want  riots and looting?  Vote for Biden,. If you elect Trump we will continue to allow root and looting.
Biden allies move to stop Kamala Harris from becoming vice president
You sound like Biden at a press conference
the decision not to vote for Biden isn't really one that I'm making for myself, it's one that was made on my behalf by right-wing democrats when they decided to torpedo the Sanders campaign on Super Tuesday
You retweet charlie kirk sin#1 and legit any lie that makes Biden look bad #2. Plus 30something followers since 2017.#3 I don't conversate with trolls or bots sorry. Blocked
Fuck Biden. Honestly anyone but Trump would be a sign I'd rock.
I volunteer too!  needs ppl to put out signs for Biden in August if you want to check it out!
cool you explained 1 of them away, but for every gaf trump has Biden has 10
I would rather Joe Biden does what the democrats want than anybody does anything that you want.  Shitbird.
I‚Äôm not a Biden fan, but this is not a recent photo. Unless they‚Äôre wearing winter coats somewhere in July.
At least he isn‚Äôt afraid to be interviewed like Biden. Dude feels pressure and melts like an icicle in August.
Bruh i ain't gonna let biden near my little sister why would i let him near the white house again.
‚ÄúPlus, she smells fantastic. Welcome to Team Joe, toots!" He then put his hands on the neck of the bottle and caressed it, giving the bottle of maple syrup a good sniff.‚Äù
Ninety-six days seems so very long to wait to get this racist out! I‚Äôm so tired of being angry. I‚Äôll just use that anger to work harder for Biden.
Can't understand if comotose Joe Biden is Soo great, why didn't he do anything for 47 years???
‚Äúbiden wasn‚Äôt my first choice either, but not voting for him because it makes you ‚Äòfeel better‚Äô endangers people who aren‚Äôt as privileged as you‚Äù
And what people may overlook is that she was on President Obama pandemic response team,to go with all her other qualifications.If I was Biden I would pick her over Kamala Harris.
Joe Biden says he'll announce vice president pick in first week of August
How can Kamala Harris get the VP nod after calling Biden a racist?  Power over morals I guess.
I snuck in tooüòâ
If Joe Biden runs with Kamala, then y‚Äôall have fun with trump cuz I‚Äôm not voting
Being the good Union (UFCW 400 / AFL-CIO, former AFGE 2206) man that I am, I must stand in Solidarity &amp; publicly endorse Biden for President.
Under Joe Biden?  There is but one man in the Presidential office. Trump.  This is the America under TRUMP‚Äôs term.  What is he doing about it?  Based on results?  Nothing effective.
Is Obama a secret muslim: Nope.  Did Obama wiretap the Trump campaign: Nope   Did Hunter Biden do anything Illegal by working in Ukraine with Congress' blessing: Nope  This is only a short list of accusations levied at Dems.Y'all had ample time to prove any of these......
What was the point of Bernie‚Äôs ‚Äútask force‚Äù if it lead to nothing but the Biden team humiliating them?
I remember a time Trump accused Obama of wiretapping with 0 evidence.Or a time he accused him of not being American(also 0 evidence). Or the time he said Hunter Biden was dirty(0 evidence) and got impeached for it. Where'd this indignation at unfounded accusations spring from?
I personally would vote for Biden regardless of who he picks but the way his campaign been dangling black women at the top of the list,if he doesn't choose a black woman there may be a serious backlash.Some black women may not work hard for him to get elected
Who do you think should be the next president? ‚Äî Joe Biden üíØü§ûü§û

biden waiting forever to announce his VP
Soooo if Joe Biden bows out of Office, the VP moves up (Harris) to POTUS and Nancy Pelosi is VP?!? Say it ain't so bruh?
What what what what what what you actually think Biden knows what he said?
I know democrats, I have friends that are Dems.  They‚Äôre moderates.  They can‚Äôt believe what is going on and want no part of it.  Im positive they will jump ship. No Biden signs in their yards.  They feel they are not represented in Congress.
I've got a feeling that instead of Trump's silent majority, enough sane conservatives will pull the lever for Biden bc they are also exhausted from the hourly clusterF.
I was expecting Biden to wait until after getting elected to start talking about jailing political dissidents, but I guess he decided there was no need for a mask.
This is my brother in rural Ga. This sounds exactly like what he‚Äôs been saying recently. I‚Äôve been gobsmacked to hear him speak like this about black people. And he‚Äôs VERY unhappy that Biden spoke at Flyod‚Äôs funeral. But he is absolutely NOT voting for Trump.
‚ÄòDo not hold grudges‚Äô against Kamala Harris: Biden speech notes caught on camera
Doesn't matter who Biden pick I'm still going to vote for Joe because the alternative is unacceptable.Trump is an embarrassment to the office of the presidency.Just look at his press conferences the dude is a narcissist and insane
Joe Biden says if you‚Äôre in the red X you should be in jail.
Joe Biden‚Äôs notes: ‚ÄòDo not hold grudges‚Äô against Kamala Harris
So your not allowed to passionately express your opinion on an issue that's different from your primary opponent?I am a Biden supporter and I thought the attacks on her were unfair.
The American people who chose to vote in the Democratic primary voted for Biden. He is the Democratic nominee by popular vote.
Wait, wait, wait...so the Yankees never actually invited Biden's Opponent to throw out a pitch?!? He made that shit up because he is jealous of Dr. Fauci?!?
It doesn't matter which black woman Biden picks the Republicans will find away to attack that VP choice.Kamala is actually the safest pick.We know what the GOP play book will be,Willie Brown that will get old fast.
And you're a dummy if you think joe Biden can beat trump in a election
I‚Äôm not sure who is a bigger badass, AG Barr or Jim Jordan. Today the Dems proved that they don‚Äôt care about this country, they care about their agenda and their re-elections. They are truly laughing stocks with no way forward, and good luck to them with Biden as the Head.
What the hell are you talking about? DEMOCRATS OR REPUBLICANS are subject to White Supremacy period! I don't understand what you don't understand.... Trump is DANGEROUS &amp; Biden is trash but I'll rather vote for him than get another 4 years of the more racist PRESIDENT
Politico Deletes Report Saying Joe Biden Picks Kamala Harris As VP  via
The Biden camp has been dangling a variety of Black women as his VP,with most being on his short list.If he doesn't choose a black woman,his chance of energizing the black vote will be gone.
If they were going to Vote for Trump, they didn't need my help doing it! Apparently, Trump speaks to their beliefs and I'm not going to make myself Accountable for their actions! I'm voting for Biden because Trump is DANGEROUS to people that look like me. Plain and simple
We understand that Trump must go! Nobody is denying that! This idea of playing into WHITE FEAR &amp; MAINTAINING A POLITICAL CORRECTNESS to save Democracy is A sham! My vote ain't free and I'm going to continuously stay critical of Biden until my vote is cast
Joe Biden did a good speach. What did he take to be able t talk for a hour. Nice try copycat  #Trump2020NowMoreThanEver
There is a leak in the Biden camp whose only purpose is to sabotage
Soooo proud of my talented friend! You‚Äôre going to crush it and the Biden team is lucky to have you!
I gotta vote for Joe Biden because the SUPREME COURT IS AT STAKE! What y'all need to do is focus on the SENATE AND THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE! That's where the problem is going to come in at if the cards aren't played correctly! Sad to say, many haven't learned anything from 2016
P.S. While y'all at it, Let's talk about why Black &amp; Brown people, specifically the older generation, always wait to cast their votes then want to demand an EXCHANGE! That's backwards as hell plus y'all gonna be mad when he don't pick A BLK VP but vote Joe Biden anyway
Joe Biden isn't above criticism &amp; we know what we have to do! Y'all continuously advance this slave MENTALITY with "DON'T TALK ABOUT MASSAH" SMH ü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è WE KNOW TRUMP IS DANGEROUS &amp; HAS TO GO! Most of y'all ONLY voted for him in the primaries becuz he was Obama's homeboy

joe biden adding a last minute pro-ACS plank to his platform
Here's where we are today, July 28th, 2020.  Imagine where we'll be if Trump doesn't rein-in Fauci and/or Biden wins.
America needs you to answer the call and save our Republic.... Biden/Obama 2020
Joe Biden once said he would be a one term president, so they're looking for a proper candidate the corporate donors will agree with for 2024. That and the current political climate we're in has a lot to do with it.
I'm one of those.   Sure, I had other candidates in mind, but anything is better than #CadetBoneSpurs  and I feel like biden will be very capable of at a MINIMUM undoing a bunch of the illegal bullshit trump did and help pass legislation protecting democracy.
Biden dont know America population
Hey  why are being forced to watch this nut Biden.   has lost it. I‚Äôm done with you.   Go back to AG Barr hearing so I can get more pissed off
Biden wasn‚Äôt in office in 1915. You should be fighting your GOVERNOR for marijuana laws.
If today couldn't get any worse...dem cry babies at this hearing,  northam press conference, and now Biden.  Where's the bourbon?
If cannabis is the only reason you‚Äôre not voting for Biden then your priorities are screwy!! Let‚Äôs give EVERYBODY equal rights then we can worry about your medicinal issues!! Good grief!
If by indispensable, you mean Whitewasher Barr doesn't prosecute Comey and McCabe for leaking and lying to congress and announces there will be no investigation of Obama and Biden but he does catch the Democrats saying dumb things...sure.
Biden? Out of sight, out of his mind.
You are right.  "Biden shouldn't throw Trump a lifeline by granting him any debates". That's a losing proposition for Biden, and he (well, his handlers) damn well know it. #Trump2020
Biden will win. Don‚Äôt confuse reality with your fiction.
Barr has always talked a good game.  Meanwhile announced no charges for leaking and lying to congress for Comey and McCabe.  Said no more politics, immediately announced no investigation into Obama and Biden... a purely political announcement.  He's lead whitewasher.
I understand the case conservative Democrats make for voting for Joe Biden is taking back the SCOTUS. I only wish they would also acknowledge that it would cost the lives of hundreds of thousands more who are without healthcare because Joe Biden doesn't believe in #MedicareForAll
You're gettibg my vote, like it or not. A vote for Biden is a vote for Trump, just like Hillary 2016. Only this time some of us have learned. #Bernie2020
As much as you want to convince me a Joe Biden presidency is better than 4 more years of Trump, we'll be stuck in the same situation in terms of healthcare. Both of them want to keep this barbaric system that is tied to our employment as we're seeing record number unemployment.
Either way, we'll be in under great hardships under either Trump or Biden. We'll be without healthcare and god help us if we get sick without insurance during a global pandemic. Neither of them support single payer. We'll suffer greatly.
Barr  Comey and McCabe off for leaking and lying to congress, said no more political DOJ decisions, then promptly announces no investigation of Obama and Biden.  Bill "Business as Usual" Barr writes strongly worded letters and talks big. He's the chief whitewasher.
Absurd.  He let Comey and McCabe off for leaking and lying to congress, said no more political DOJ decisions, then promptly announces no investigation of Obama and Biden.  Bill "Business as Usual" Barr writes strongly worded letters and talks big. He's the chief whitewasher.
I agree wholeheartedly with
If you ever wondered how Comey, Biden, Obama, etc etc broke the law in spygate, this video breaks it down step-by-step. Watch with an open mind.
Sounds like democrats here. Biden would probably be on disability along with schitt for brains and schmucker.
The onky threat Donakd Trump is to them is he is exposing the Demonrats and the corruption perpetrated within our government by the likes of scum like Comey, Stryok, Brennan, Pelosi, Biden, Schumer and Schifty.
And how do these people think Hidin Biden would have done any better?
Honestly, does Bernie still believe Biden would be the most progressive president since FDR? The guy is against progressive ideas.
I think a lot of her lack of support from the black community was do to the fact that we felt like that Biden was the only one that could beat Trump and we weren't going to waist our vote regardless of the skin color.
And to think Bernie believes Biden would be the most progressive candidate since FDR. It's nothing more than a sick joke.
Biden‚Äôs energy plan is ambitious. But plausible? Full decarbonization of U.S. power grid cost $4.5 trillion; staggering $35,000 per household. Energy transitions are crucial, difficult, and slow, not cheap or easy. #energy #natgas #power #policy #politics
Exactly what we're going to do! We're going to elect Joe Biden!
She doesn't even speak proper English! She just trying to stir up s***! Biden 2020
Trump doesn't need a lifeline, but if he did, he certainly wouldn't be looking to Joe Biden to throw one.
NYT Reporter: Intel Officials Believe Russians Using Hunter Biden Allegations to Distract from Election Interference  I say fuck a bunch of dumb ass trump supporters like Him dumb as rocks. As hard as GOP tried they could not find any crime w/ Hillary
Both are vile but Trump is like the boss leader of the disgusting. Biden is nowhere near as horrid as Trump.
What?  All of this burning and rioting is bc of your inability to lead our country. I also think it‚Äôs funny that you use actual footage from events that happened recently in your lastest campaign ad and then said, this is what it will be like if Biden was president. #A$$hat
reporting! Here's me w a #feetinterview on the #streetinterview scene at  chicago    Wonder if she's HRC/BIDEN?
####### BREAKING NEWS ####### Joe Biden announced he was picking Joe Biden as his Vice Presidential nomination. He sighted this guy should be good because he has been Vice President before I think????
No doubt that Biden is being used but he also is allowing it. He knows what the Socialists are up to. He worked alongside Communist &amp; ISIS sympathizer Obama for 8 years &amp; helped to tear this nation apart. Now he &amp; his army of evil (Satan's Soldiers) plan to finish their work.
I expect nothing from Bill "Business as Usual" Barr, and he's surprised me by exactly how little he's accomplished.  Said, "No more politics at DOJ!"  Followed by, "Obama and Biden won't be investigated"!  Comey and McCabe, no charges for leaking/lying to congress. Perfect score.
Joe Biden is a little scardy cat! He‚Äôs scared to pieces about debates with PRESIDENT TRUMP!!! Hahaha. He‚Äôs a coward!
Bill "Business as Usual" Barr is useless.  He writes stern letters, gives hard-talking speeches, then says, Obama and Biden won't be investigated, Comey and McCabe...no charges for leaking and lying to congress.  These people are useless trough-feeders.
Well, a bag of s___ is better than a bag of Biden.
It's a voluntary service my guy.  We are going to need a strong defense especially if Biden's going to be in office anyways.
I don't think it's going to be Kamala because of all the VP picks she's the only one that's being seen the most. Biden's about to throw a curveball and pick either Elizabeth Warren or Michigan Governor's Gretchen Whitmer.
Joe Biden has class. My mother said Donald Trump is nothing but white t__sh.  I am not allowed to say that because it is racist.  He paints everything gold to make himself look rich really means he has to show it on the outside because he has no worth within.
VOTE FOR BIDEN!

Exactly. Pelosi, Schumer, Biden, and the rest of the Clinton-worshipping conservative core of the Democratic party don't care anymore about the American people than the GOP does. The 2 party system is a lie. We live in an oligarchy. Period.
Very nice of Mike Pence to provide this footage for the next Biden ads in Florida.
He will stand there for an hour and answer tons of questions. Including the hard ones. I haven't seen Biden answer any. Or if he does they make no sense....lol.

The ideas and policies that Nancy Pelosi and Joe Biden are vehemently opposed to. Like #MedicareForAll for example.
Probably. From what I understand, Joe Biden got the bulk of the VA vote from Northern Virginia, which is close to DC. It's a haven for establishment Democrats. Hell, nearly all of VA is an establishment haven. There's hardly any progressives here, despite being a blue state.

To those who are upset about Bernie's delegates doing this, it's called "earning their votes". Last time I checked, this is still a democracy and not a coronation. Biden is not entitled to their votes just because he's the presumptive nominee.
Is there a reporter out there with the courage to ask Joe Biden how many black neighbors he has in his neighborhood and when is the last time he invited them over for a barbecue or other social event?

The Trump Campaign doesn‚Äôt even know how to get you to vote for Trump. Their tactic is to scare you, by using false information, into voting against Biden. Pathetic but that‚Äôs politics I guess. #Biden2020

I'm not sure what happened, but there's no doubt in my mind that Biden and his team did what he did here in VA and coalesced the representatives and told their voters their marching orders. They were organized to a fucking T
I live in Virginia and I saw no signs of any ground game here for Biden and yet he won it by wide margins. All he did was gather endorsement from Democratic representatives here and that's all he needed. It taught me a harsh lesson about how politics is played here and I hate it.
I'm going to need the Biden campaign to stop making it so hard to vote for him. Have Chris Dodd sit down. Keep Biden in the basement. Just let Trump make Biden's case for him. The best thing the Biden campaign can do for the next 99 days is just keep quiet.

Biden can‚Äôt string three words together in a coherent sentence. It‚Äôs bad enough when it‚Äôs on a teleprompter for him! That‚Äôs why he‚Äôs trying to weasel out of debates with Trump. Trump would eat him for lunch on national television for the entire nation to see!

I‚Äôm voting Biden 100%, but dont make a hero out of a rapist (alleged) and person that participated and ‚Äòreached across the aisle‚Äô to aid war crimes in iraq, Afghanistan, etc.. not to mention his help  in creating  and expanding dhs. Fyi, now dhs is Portland rn, ice, cbp etc
Yes but they are structured and framed as equivalent, so the Times snuck in an inaccurate ‚Äúbaseless‚Äù implication to the Biden argument.
Yes. A vote for anyone other than Biden is a vote for 45.
Before liberals twist George Carlin's words, understand he was heavily critical of both parties and he knew that politicians are in the back pockets of wealthy corporations, the "owners" as he calls them. He would have dragged both Trump and Biden if he were alive today.
A very good, if not the only, reason to vote for Biden.
I clicked on one of those silly promoted ads that talked about yearbook quotes.    This must‚Äôve been Joe Biden
ALL THIS IS HAPPENING UNDER TRUMPS AMERICA,  NOT OBAMA NOT BIDEN,  NOT HILLARY,  TRUMP

Feckless idiots think George Carlin was referring to President Donald Trump.  He was actually speaking about career politicians like, Pelosi, Schumer, Biden, Waters, Schiff, etc.  Doh!
July 26th marks the 100 days of work Norfolk must do to elect Joe Biden, Mark Warner, Bobby Scott, and Elaine Luria. We need your help right in your own precinct and neighborhood. Please sign up to save America.
So the absence of weighting by Education attainment has a potential to make the results skew towards Trump in a more rural State whereas skew Biden in a more urbanized State?
I know everything about Trump! He is making policies that help all Americans while Joe Biden just plagiarized everything Trump has already done! Joe has no ideas of his own except to bash Trump. It will never work!  #TRUMP2020Landside
Literally this. God send for Biden
ONLY think Biden is doing to win my reluctant support is drawing a "aggressive" climate policy. I want ExxonMobil thrown is jail as much as you. Will I take massive infrastructure investments &amp; economic support to pll hurt as we shift energy balance away from dead dinosaurs. Yep
I think he is a focused successful President!  He is not in decline! Good Grief, why make up stuff! Joe Biden is senile ,under criminal investigation and has sold out America his entire adult life. He is a proven racist and touches children inappropriately &amp;  is accused of rape!
Please get out and tell the protesters they need to calm down before they give tRump the election   This is not doing us, Biden supporters any good.
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
Yes because I'm voting for Biden regardless of who he  other words, Elizabeth Warren,yes Karen Bass yes, mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms yes, Susan Rice yes, Tammy Duckworth yes.
Joe Biden is the true racist and crook! Wake up!
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
Kamala is a nice choice  But in all honesty, a 50 lb sack of wet cow manure is better than Trump/Pence so I'd vote for Biden no matter who he chooses
Biden is going to throw everybody a curveball and pick Michigan's Governor Gretchen Whitmer

Russia is not our problem.  China, Biden, Democrats, Socialism, ALL seem to be on the same page. They are all trying to turn USA into chaos!
Same here in the US. The Democrats want Trump to look bad while teachers union backs the Democrats (Biden). They want Trump to fail so they refuse to have schools open. Parents can‚Äôt work but have to stay home with kids. Parents,kids &amp; country suffers to have Trump lose. Insane!

If you vote Joe Biden you will regret it.
I'm voting for Biden because trump is full bull. that's it point blank PERIOD.  to be honest I'd vote for ANYONE that ran against trump.just to get his ass out.
Tell me with an honest face that you could ever see Donald Trump doing this EVER! This is why I‚Äôm voting for Joe Biden. #Biden2020
it appears that's all you or your brother can fine on Biden. to be honest I'd vote for pee wee herman right about now. ANYBODY can have my vote other than this KLANSMAN.  hes the worst president America has ever seen. Republicans have has enough of the bully too.
Biden said he's gunna pick a black lady VP.  Probably Sean Hannity.
In 2008 Joe Biden didn't win a single delegate or state but President Obama picked him as his VP.
Biden's going to throw everybody a curve ball and Pick Michigan's Governor Gretchen Whitmer.Kamala won't galvanized the black women vote like people think. Keisha Lance Bottoms could but but resume may be too light.
this is out of control. When Biden wins can we charge Fox News for spreading hate speech!?
you do understand your enemy should be trump, not biden right? or are you intentionally trying to split the vote so trump wins again
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
Lord please expose Joe Biden for what he has always been; a racist and a con man getting away with ripping off other countries to get rich. Please bring him to repentance Lord. In Jesus name, name...there you go; a prayer for Joe Biden

I am ready to vote for him. A life with Biden is no life for honest hard working people. Trump 2020
This is such a lazy and factually inaccurate  take. 1. HRC‚Äôs campaign was not polling at numbers Biden is at this time/places. 2. We‚Äôre in the middle of pandemic, so the campaigns are patently different in how they‚Äôve been run. 3. Biden‚Äôs platform far more progressive than HRC.
I may not click on a link, or watch a news conference, or show up at a campaign rally, but you can bet your ass I will walk through fire or crawl through glass to show up on November 3rd to vote for Biden. I will vote for a golfish cracker then trump!
Those who hang with Biden are ok with illegal spying, wiretapping, multiple examples of racist statements and over 40 years of doing nothing for the people he supposedly cares so much about
Baby, you need help. Please do yourself some good and commit yourself for a few months to get back where you need to be. You've got babies that depend on you. Then when you're on the right track, come out and VOTE BIDEN!!
But it would probably guarantee Biden a loss...

Bro, Trump is going to win in the biggest landslide victory ever.... have you not been paying attention?? Biden is a chomo and almost everyone knows this... How can you support a man of his character?? He messes with little girls and tries kissing them while rubbing on them...
I thank you for holding up your oath. I hope when Biden wins he asks you &amp; your brother to make sure dickwad Donnie is removed from the WH! God bless you &amp; your brother. Again, thank touüá∫üá∏‚úäüèæüëçüèæ
Saw a Joe Biden ad on TV last night and it was one of the best election ads I've ever seen. Emotional and negative but positive enough not to seem over the top. Superior to anything I saw from Hillary four years ago. The former VP has some smart people running his campaign.

America is more divided &amp; damaged now than ever before. Why would anybody volunteer to take that responsibility head-on? Because that person cares about the wellbeing &amp; future of America. #JoeBiden cares about the wellbeing &amp; future of America. Joe Biden will unite us againüá∫üá∏
It‚Äôs not about ME, it‚Äôs about YOU and US per biden 2020! Vote crooked trump out !  Please ! Rapist, racist, fake president, crooked, alarmist towards racism , monies towards his golf courses, womanizer , lier, lier, lier vote trump out please! Walls of mommies !!
You could totally beat Biden off.
Reports that the trump pushed to move british open to his own Fuckin Golf Course raises questions?? Bitch this shit was happen last year and I was disappointed and disgusted then just as I am disappointed and disgusted NOW!! Vote this crooked fake man out !! Biden please
#nevertrumpersareScum  Please realize trumps mission is to regain American wealth and stop trafficking  #ye point is to beat biden
And beating Biden won‚Äôt mean you will win it jus means we get another four years and evil....and that‚Äôs what you want
Only because Biden doesn't lumber.
And apparently, y'all think Joe Biden is going to make everything better when he still operates from a place of Privilege
Did you check my page or you giving a typical emotional response to truth? I stay calling out Donald Trump but acting like Joe Biden is a better choice is IGNORANT AS HELL! I'm voting for Biden because Trump is clearly endangering everything but we have to be honest as well
Yes. A vote for anyone other than Biden is a vote for Trump. #VoteBiden2020
My point was to pray for your leaders. Pray for their success. If they're successful we will all be happy. On top of that I was making the point Trump doesn't want to take away my religious freedom and Biden does not care about my rights.
Oh well, gonna crush Biden anyway. You should have stuck with Covid. Riots and arson and the destruction of American cities by leftist mobs have seal the  fate. You'll be lucky to keep The House.
If there is one perk to Donald Trump's presidency it's the fact that my wife has been drinking way too much! And I take full advantage of that!üòÅ just being honest! But, when Joe Biden wins we are going to double up on that drinking in Celebration!! Biden 2020!!
Here's a better one of Donald Trump hanging with two known child molesters! This one's not photoshopped it's real! I wonder if Melania used to recruit little girls also! It wouldn't surprise me oh, nothing surprises me with these mobsters!! Biden 2020!
You nailed it! Biden 2020!!
I can't wait.   I think many people will vote just to 'twist the knife' so to speak. Biden will win virginia, and I have no state electrons, but I'm still going, just to add my vote to the list to say 'fuck you' to #CadetBoneSpurs
Agreed. If you don't want Trump to get a second term, then vote for Biden even if he doesn't exactly meet all your high standards.
Biden should just say "vote for me if you wanna live" at this point lol
It doesn't matter to me. I'll vote for Biden no matter what.
2. Attention tracker: Biden makes it about Trump  #axiosam
Evidence Biden is a racist: Biden sponsored and wrote the 1994 crime bill that is responsible for the mass incarceration of minorities for minor, nonviolent crimes we have today, fully supported the Obama administrations ‚Äúno-knock‚Äù initiative and the fed intervening....
Thank you. Period. Vote biden 2020
It is a way to get around campaign finance law. One of the reasons Biden has hired 600 lawyers... Trust me, those lawyers are not working to stay in compliance with any laws! They are working to subvert them and to affect the outcome of the election and if necessary subvert it.üò°
I will Vote for Biden only because another 4 years of Trump would be a diaster
He'll use this against Joe Biden and it's going to work because the Democrats have not learned a damn thing.
If y'all ass cared anything about History, you would understand how PROBLEMATIC THAT IS! THIS IDEA THAT BIDEN CAN NOT BE CORRECTED IS WHY THIS ELECTION IS IN JEOPARDY ! If you want to be honest, Biden's record alone would put him in the RACIST CATEGORY! Both of them are trash
Planning on voting for Biden too.
They can't understand that because they're playing into WHITE FEAR! APPARENTLY, PEOPLE CAN'T WALK AND CHEW GUM at the same time anymore! This idea that Biden is above criticism is IGNORANT AS HELL TO ME
So Biden is above criticism??? How the HELL is this misspeaking?? WHETHER YOU KNOW IT OR NOT, THIS IS WHAT YOU CALL "RACIALLY BLIND SPOTS" that still plays into White Supremacy! BTW: Attack is A strong word to use when Biden clearly is WHITE WASHING HISTORY
I think the Biden administration needs to re-evaluate broadcast licensing.  Endangering the public through disinformation and slander should be reasons to lose your license IMHO.
Hillary Clinton's favorable/unfavorable split was -12. Biden's is about -2. There's just a large chunk of the country that doesn't like her. Totally unfair, in my opinion, but a lot of politics is a popularity contest...
But as Mr Biden helpfully explained, he is conservative, and therefore not actually black.
#HereRightMatters what do you think you are doing? Are now going to vote for Biden? If so , you are not a conservative, Period!Stop trying to spread your legs in two different directions! This is a binary choice.
Hush little Americans daddy just wants to be re elected !! Then I can tell y‚Äôall more bullshit ! Vote this racist troll out biden 2020

Haha yeah it really looks like it! 145000 dead 20 million out of work thousands of people facing eviction! You call that making America great? I call that making America suck! Don't worry Joe Biden will fix it again!!

The other thing we know is that Lenin was the figurehead of the revolution  and not the real power behind it. Just like Biden is the Dems‚Äô figurehead candidate but not the real power behind what the Dems are trying to do... üòê
Why do you think that I‚Äôm ok with it? I‚Äôm just pointing out some of trump‚Äôs hypocrisy. Everything that you said, China was doing BEFORE trump asked them to help with Biden. trump is the one that doesn‚Äôt care. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre bitter at my lord and savior, trump! So mean!‚Äù üò≠üò≠üò≠
Okay, I get your point! Biden 2020
We'll see about that ma'am! He's not doing too well at the moment! Biden 2020!
Hey! Remember that time when trump asked China to help him investigate Biden's son? And now he's mad because they are hacking from the embassy? Yeah, good times.
Hope for Biden though?  Even though he had 8 years
Basement Biden? Built nothing. Participated in a coup attempt and should be in prison.
Basement Biden you already had your turn and were part of a coup attempt that failed. You should be in prison.
Every time I hear "trump is bad, but Biden isn't any better! I'm writing in my vote!" I can literally feel something inside me die. I want to believe in people again üòî
I think too many just accept that he‚Äôs done terrible things and can only do something in Nov but unfortunately I think it will too late by then...so much chaos will be done before then and before Biden takes over.
Joe Biden's Twitter is so beautifully and Wonderfully boring. It's just normal run of mill stuff.  Its.. So beautiful.
Now you know why John Kasich is speaking for and supporting Joe Biden (not that it really matters), they are all tied together in this corruption. The Rabbit Hole keeps getting Deeper &amp; Deeper!!! "Those you trusted the most"...

Dude, get over it. By doing what you are is making it political. It is one interview by the owner of the company that you work for. Just do your job that you state you love so much. Trust me...it will be ok. Don't whine. And Good Luck if you get an Interview with Senile Joe Biden
Maybe he just remembered.  He's trying to prove that he's sharper than Joe Biden. He's going full Trump/Roy Cohn for the rest of his time in the White House. He's looking for anything: lies about Biden, law and order, illegal voting, immigration, The Blacks, The Border, Hillary..
If UR entertaining that Biden is a pervert or pedophile you are being groomed for some kind of "evidence" to drop later so you'll say "I knew it" just before the election and hand it to Trump. It'll be shown later to be false after the election but by then it will be too late.

He already said he was. He tells Biden to please go ahead &amp; pick his black woman VP so he can get enthusiastic about voting for her, because he'd never get enthusiastic about voting for Bide. It's exactly what most of us have been saying for months, the election is about his VP.

What scares me the most is Joe Biden will not be scrutinized the same way Trump is. I'm afraid Joe Biden will lull people to sleep and he'll be able to violate human rights and there won't be a peep from the woke resistance folks and they'll chastise leftists for doing so.
I have a really bad feeling Joe Biden will do the same shit Trump is doing right now to violate our first amendment rights and the #Resistance will not say a word about it. They're rightfully vocal about Trump now, but once Joe Biden becomes president they'll be quiet.
If Joe Biden becomes president and there's still protests going on, do you think he'll sic the federal police onto them? And if he does, do you think liberals will cheer him on for doing so? Because I have no doubt the #Resistance folks will not resist that at all.
That doesn't even make any damn sense! Joe Biden served 8 years with a black president! Donald Trump is very obviously a racist! We'll see what America thinks

Under President Biden, taxpayers would pay for his transgender surgery.
Biden has also been in washington the majority of his career... trumps been there 3 years.  anything else?
If the question is Trump or Biden, Biden is the answer.
i dont see biden deploying federal forces against americans.  or calling klan members good people. or consistently speaking against anyone who isnt white.  sorry, its not the "same bro"  AGAIN, im not fighting FOR biden.  theres a bigger picture here.
as i said... i dont know anyone voting FOR biden.  I'd much rather have bernie personally.  But its more than a vote just for president.
but obviously the choices suck... i dont know alot of biden "fans" but its understood what is the best option moving forward
or you look at the whole picture, its not just a vote for biden as president... but getting biden in office will help change alot of things in washington for the better.  thats how i look at it.
I just listened to your donkey of the day on Joe Biden and I heard you say our country got to where it is because of old white men!! Did you forget that the man who ran this country before Trump was a Black man? At what point will black America start putting Obama
If Dems allow Biden to be used/abused like they are currently doing...WHAT WILL THEY ALLOW TO HAPPEN TO AMERICAN CITIZENS?
#JoeBiden will be 100 times better than the proven &amp; documented racist currently in the White House. Our  base consists of Neo-Nazis, Klansmen, White Nationalists, White Supremacists &amp; Anti-Semitics. Biden has NEVER had a base like this &amp; NEVER will. Only
As an Independent, Biden is not my choice, but I will vote for him to get rid of trump's fat ignorant ass. The black community where I live, can't stand him.  trump only got 8% of the black vote in 2016. Compared to the majority of the black vote- Obama in '08 &amp; '12.
Joe Biden has a long to-do list if he wins the White House
Vote vote vote!! Biden is only ahead when we vote
While you are REQUIRED to LIE as a  cult member (which explains your lies about Obama/Biden) the truth is our  is a proven &amp; documented Russian puppet due to the money Trump owes to Russians who kept his casinos afloat until the bankruptcies=hiding the taxes

Of course not!  Anyone that does is in worse shape mentally than Biden. Polls are run by the media, which is nothing more than the PR division of the DNC these days.

"One of the things that I think is important: I wish, I wish we taught more in our schools about the Islamic faith," Biden said. "What people don't realize is ... we all come from the same root here, in terms of our fundamental basic beliefs." Is what he actually said.
I got a call on my house phone (I need to get rid of)  about 2 months ago.   It took me until nearly the end to figure out how pro-trump it was, they ended up near the end referring to 'sleepy Joe Biden' and had shitty response options to some questions.
this country will never be a socialist nation EVER!  Trump will beat Biden and squash socialism like a bug so that it never becomes a thing and you can forget about using Denmark as an example cause they aren't socialist.

Highly unlikely. Biden has no hope other than politics. Trump has every reason to NOT be president. He just wanted the clout. He's got hundreds of millions (maybe billions) of reasons üíµ to leave if he loses and not a single reason to go to war. Biden on the other hand...
not too far away from early voting in a couple of these states.  I think both Michigan and Minnesota start 45 and 46 days before the election.   I really hope the Biden campaign really really pushes early voting hard.
Am I the only person who still wants to know how the fuck Biden is running for president? üòÇüòÇ
The man literally donates his presidential fee (about $400K) to a different group every year. Does the presidency give him more clout? Sure. Will he ruin the country cuz he loses to Biden? Highly unlikely. The presidency isn't his only gig.

Obama is the one who divided this country and continues to do so in the back ground...a vote for biden will only bring more lawlessness!

Biden raped somebody according to that somebody. How do women vote for people who grope women on actual video and have a rape case that kinda just "went away". And sadly, Tara Reid wasn't alone, but yeah #WOMENSRIGHTS
Obama and Biden were amazing. You are way out of their league.
Liberals and non-Trumper Conservatives now: Setting differences aside and coming together to get Trump out of the WH  Liberals and non-Trumper Conservatives after Biden gets elected and they immediately start bickering again:
Joe Biden‚Äôs America.
Biden and Obama condemn Trump's COVID-19 response
These are treacherous times!! Trump wants to be King! This is why our forefathers in America did not make this soo! Vote! Vote! Biden 2020
I wish you was more incline regarding our men and women who had a bounty on their heads ! Almost 4 million Americans with covid 19 or over 130 ,000,of our Americans dead!! But I see you troll ! We dont want a dictatorial troll or a King! Biden 2020
What a maroon. Someone needs to inform Biden that some American presidents owned slaves.
I realized the difference between a conservative and a liberal... A conservative would see a Biden 2020 hat and ü§î‚Äôdumb hat‚Äô.   A liberal would see a Trump 2020 hat and get in their face and assault the person... Liberals are way too emotionally unstable...

One problem here... Biden isn‚Äôt president right now. Trump is. This is LITERALLY Trump‚Äôs America.  Anything else you try to tell yourself at night to sleep better is a lie.
‚ÄòI went fishing, and a coffee cup and forks were, were uh, there. And I like the smell of gasoline.‚Äô-   Joe Biden‚Äôs thoughts on climate change probably.
Joe Biden calls Donald Trump America's 'first' racist president. With all due respect, Biden is mistaken. Woodrow Wilson was a flaming racist among other likely White House bigot-residents.
That‚Äôs like Biden saying if you don‚Äôt vote for him your not black. üôÑ
Is anyone else who is Anti Trump and Pro Biden having problems posting and liking posts on Facebook!! They deleted my whole account and are now fucking with my Johann one!! Fuckerberg is a Nazi
You need some education that's why biden is in court because all your proof. When Russian trump is a racist and pedophile and over 24Republicans have went to jail over the last 2 years for pedophile,tax evasion, campaign fraud,bribery. This is what Russian fox news dont tell you

I don't think he is the first, but assuredly he is the most recent.  Biden says Trump is America‚Äôs first ‚Äòracist‚Äô president By Colby Itkowitz and John Wagner
Is this a new Joe Biden ad?
When will Biden tell everyone that he‚Äôs going to debate Trump? Oh yeh, I forgot. Biden would melt like an icicle in August if he does.

Come to think of it no. Lots of Bernie and trump but don‚Äôt recall one Biden sign in SE Va

Great activist? Maybe. But he let the district he ran go to hell, didn‚Äôt do much for the people who lived there. Took huge donations even when he ran unopposed and supported people like Biden when he railed against desegregation and busing .
I‚Äôm confused. I thought liberals LOVED taxing the rich. Biden said his economic plan would be paid for in part by taxing the WEALTHY.
I Been With Joe Biden From Day 1,üíô
Who every Joe Biden pick as V,P they have to be vetted they back ground has to be good No Dirty that will hurt the election.
Uncontrolled pandemic, rogue Federal agents, unemployment and no health insurance , violence by white supremacists.. In Biden's America the main cause of all of this will be in prison.
Let's Not Forget Rep John Lewis Said Keep Your Eyes On The Ball!! Republicans party  and  have received FAKE Documents from UK. The Trump Campaign and Gop what's to Smear Joe Biden.  Keep your Eyes On The Ball. #TrumpResignNow
I've seen alot of videos of people who voted for him in 16 who will be voting for Biden now. People with intelligence who admit they made a mistake. But the far right, kool aid drinking, mask throwing racist mfers won't leave his side.
I've been going back and forth these last few days between Kamala and Susan Rice,although I believe Rice would be a better fit For Biden.She has a lot of baggage and her pick would be going back in the past.Kamala is the safer pick.
Choosing only from candidates of one gender is #sexist. Joe Biden has a long history of supporting America‚Äôs #fascist policies &amp; is no friend of the left. He supports the wanton slaughter of #black children through his steadfast support of the racist Planned Parenthood org.
If Biden don't pick Kamala Harris now the backlash will be brutal.I've been following politics for 40 years and I have never seen a potential VP pick being torn apart by there on party like this.
Biden has accomplished basically zip in his four plus decades as a politician. Really don‚Äôt want a guy as POTUS who can barely speak coherently at times.
"The survey, it‚Äôs worth noting, was conducted July 28 to 30, mostly before Trump‚Äôs tweet about delaying the election. If anything, these gaps will likely widen in the wake of his incendiary suggestion." Which is EXACTLY why he made it.
This is NOT Biden's America ..
Actually, it was Biden who suggested using the military in such an event.
Let's keep our eye on the ball Trump and Republicans party trying to do play book 2016 watch Ron Johnson and Lindsey Graham. They trying to smear Joe Biden.
botted tweets really expose the fact that there are idiotically defensive assholes supporting both sides üòÇ ever Trump tweet that gets oWo-ed triggers a bunch of Trumpers and every Biden tweet that gets oWo-ed triggers a bunch of Dems üòÇüòÇ
who else will they vote for that actually has a chance though? then we‚Äôre stuck with donald for 4 more years because we‚Äôre divided on our vote while he has a solid base. I don‚Äôt see how it does any good to not vote biden. Trust me, I don‚Äôt like Joe but we need donald out
You evidently know nothing about Biden. Just listening to him speak is proof he has a cognitive issue. Do a little research before calling just one of them terrible.
This is the unfortunate truth Biden folks, #resistance folks, #KHive trolls, blue wavers will not understand. Even if Trump loses, people will suffer and we'll still face the constant fear of getting sick and having no medical insurance because Joe will not enact #MedicareForAll
The only thing Republican lite Democrats care about is taking control for 4 more years to replace RBG and stopping SCOTUS turn even more far to the right. By that time, people will die needlessly and families will face financial ruin as Joe Biden does little to help us.
What's depressing is conservative Democrats are not fighting to make this country a better place to live for those of us struggling in this crisis. Biden has made no promises to uplift and help us as we're facing an eviction crisis and a healthcare crisis. Nothing will change.
It goes to show you how weak Joe Biden is that his minions on Twitter have to comes to his defense because he's such a terrible candidate. Do you think Trump will be as kind as Biden's critics on the left? They're already calling him a socialist, which is laughable.
It's bad enough to having to choose between the two despite the outcome being the same: death by a lack of healthcare access. What's insulting is when Republicans disguised as Democrats tell me I can't tell the truth about Joe Biden because it'll help Trump.
The cold hard truth conservative Democrats are refusing to admit is even if Biden wins there's still going to be suffering under his administration. All they have is "damage reduction", but what they don't say is hundreds and thousands more will die all in order replace RBG.
Show me a tweet about Biden that I originated?
I'm absolutely terrified they will especially if Biden's VP pic isn't to the liking of everyone. I have my VP preferences but whoever he pics I'll still be voting for him. No matter what Trump is exponentially worse than anyone Biden can pic.
I am new to the KHive, so please excuse me if I ask a stupid question. Why do they continue disruptive behavior if we are supposed to be on the same side? After these last 3 1/2 years, you'd think they would work w/the best team to win (Biden/Harris).
This is why I am VOTING for you VP Biden‚úùÔ∏èüôèüèæ

Eid Mubarak! After Trump cages our children Biden will deport them while House Democrats votes on a bill to give them airplane tickets.
Followed the advice of Biden in his January 29th op ed to start.
You know, it's sad: that sentence right there might have been enough to convince me to vote for Biden, were I a citizen. That's how low his opponent has set the bar.
And as far as I'm concerned, the American people will suffer no matter who wins, and there's no amount of shamming coming from you that will change that unfortunate reality. Biden or Trump, people will die from a lack of healthcare access.
Biden said he would veto Medicare For All and the DNC has voted down any measures of enacting a single payer healthcare systems, along with many other progressive and popular ideas that were rejected. That's not the fault of someone critiquing that insanity. That's on Biden.
Oh, so it's her fault that Biden is looking less electable because of his inadequate policy proposals and not Biden himself? It's because of her criticism and not because Biden has said time and time again he doesn't care about our needs in this crisis we're in right now?
This is the same face we're all making knowing Joe Biden will never fight for #MedicareForAll.
Then why are you on her case when she says Joe Biden will increase our premiums? She's not helping Trump when she points out Joe Biden doesn't plan on doing anything about our healthcare system even in the middle of a pandemic.
That's not her job to make Joe Biden less shitty. It's on Joe Biden himself.
We're not allowed to say Joe Biden's healthcare policy, or lack of, is not sustainable given that we're in a pandemic? Are we not allowed to demand better from the presumptive nominee?
This is who Joe Biden and Kamala Harris attracts. I'll be damned if this is who we have to unite with in order to defeat Trump. A bunch of bitter, hateful, self-absorbed trolls that don't think we're actual people. We don't matter to them. They sound just like Republicans.
Will Biden even make it until then?  His feebleness and addled demeanor is clearly quickly increasing.  The question is, who would really be president IF he is elected?
The truth to them is like God's Word is to demons. They don't want exposure or to answer for their crimes against America &amp; its people. Trump didn't play their game &amp; refused to be their puppet. Dems won't tolerate this &amp; Joe Biden is willing to be their puppet.
Are u a Biden fan or Bernie ?
Yeah, sure. Whatever you say loser. The only BIG thing happening now is the amount of losing that you're doing to Joe Biden.  Hold the L jackass.
Fucken pc of shit!! Vote please biden 2020
A whole 247 watching Biden!! Wow!
Maybe trump should be secluded (detained?) during the election results until Biden emerges as the clear winner...
I think it's going to be  because we don't see her anywhere and Kamala is all over the place.I just have this feeling that Biden is going to throw us a curve ball.
It‚Äôs so obvious Obama is just itching to go to war with Trump while on the campaign trail for Biden, and I am here for ALL of it. üòé #ObamaEulogy
Both candidates are unable to campaign openly so I'm sure that Biden might consider... unless it's ok with him since he's stuck in the basement....
It's Evident Biden Is Confused But Real Americans Are Not. We Dont Want A Demented Socialist Racist Running Our Nation. Socialism Doesn't Work For The People It Enslaves Them. Keep America Free, Keep Trump!üá∫üá∏

How come no one is asking if Biden would accept Trumps win?
Is Biden still announcing his VP pick before August (this Saturday)? Or did I make that up in my head?
Omg!! WTf‚Äô trump wants to moved the election from November because biden is kicking his butt!! Let‚Äôs be clear HE HAS NOT AUTHORIZED to moved shit ! clear is that only the states and Congress have the power to delay that part of the election process! Facts! Vote this monster out
A wonderful idea ! Voting is sooo yesterday.  People nobody wanted could be elected. So why don't you just skip the expansive and fraudulent process and declare Joe Biden to be the next president !!  The pandemic will end, the economy will grow and everyone is happy again.

No. That is not an acceptable answer. Not everyone can wait to 2024 for the perfect choice. Biden wasn't even my 3rd pick, but he offers a chance to step back from the edge.

I volunteer too!  needs ppl to put out signs for Biden in August if you want to check it out!
cool you explained 1 of them away, but for every gaf trump has Biden has 10
At least he isn‚Äôt afraid to be interviewed like Biden. Dude feels pressure and melts like an icicle in August.
Bruh i ain't gonna let biden near my little sister why would i let him near the white house again.
Can't understand if comotose Joe Biden is Soo great, why didn't he do anything for 47 years???
‚Äúbiden wasn‚Äôt my first choice either, but not voting for him because it makes you ‚Äòfeel better‚Äô endangers people who aren‚Äôt as privileged as you‚Äù
And what people may overlook is that she was on President Obama pandemic response team,to go with all her other qualifications.If I was Biden I would pick her over Kamala Harris.

If Joe Biden runs with Kamala, then y‚Äôall have fun with trump cuz I‚Äôm not voting
What was the point of Bernie‚Äôs ‚Äútask force‚Äù if it lead to nothing but the Biden team humiliating them?
I personally would vote for Biden regardless of who he picks but the way his campaign been dangling black women at the top of the list,if he doesn't choose a black woman there may be a serious backlash.Some black women may not work hard for him to get elected
Who do you think should be the next president? ‚Äî Joe Biden üíØü§ûü§û
Soooo if Joe Biden bows out of Office, the VP moves up (Harris) to POTUS and Nancy Pelosi is VP?!? Say it ain't so bruh?
What what what what what what you actually think Biden knows what he said?
This is my brother in rural Ga. This sounds exactly like what he‚Äôs been saying recently. I‚Äôve been gobsmacked to hear him speak like this about black people. And he‚Äôs VERY unhappy that Biden spoke at Flyod‚Äôs funeral. But he is absolutely NOT voting for Trump.
‚ÄòDo not hold grudges‚Äô against Kamala Harris: Biden speech notes caught on camera
Doesn't matter who Biden pick I'm still going to vote for Joe because the alternative is unacceptable.Trump is an embarrassment to the office of the presidency.Just look at his press conferences the dude is a narcissist and insane
Joe Biden‚Äôs notes: ‚ÄòDo not hold grudges‚Äô against Kamala Harris
So your not allowed to passionately express your opinion on an issue that's different from your primary opponent?I am a Biden supporter and I thought the attacks on her were unfair.
The American people who chose to vote in the Democratic primary voted for Biden. He is the Democratic nominee by popular vote.
It doesn't matter which black woman Biden picks the Republicans will find away to attack that VP choice.Kamala is actually the safest pick.We know what the GOP play book will be,Willie Brown that will get old fast.
I‚Äôm not sure who is a bigger badass, AG Barr or Jim Jordan. Today the Dems proved that they don‚Äôt care about this country, they care about their agenda and their re-elections. They are truly laughing stocks with no way forward, and good luck to them with Biden as the Head.
The Biden camp has been dangling a variety of Black women as his VP,with most being on his short list.If he doesn't choose a black woman,his chance of energizing the black vote will be gone.

America needs you to answer the call and save our Republic.... Biden/Obama 2020
Joe Biden once said he would be a one term president, so they're looking for a proper candidate the corporate donors will agree with for 2024. That and the current political climate we're in has a lot to do with it.
I'm one of those.   Sure, I had other candidates in mind, but anything is better than #CadetBoneSpurs  and I feel like biden will be very capable of at a MINIMUM undoing a bunch of the illegal bullshit trump did and help pass legislation protecting democracy.
If by indispensable, you mean Whitewasher Barr doesn't prosecute Comey and McCabe for leaking and lying to congress and announces there will be no investigation of Obama and Biden but he does catch the Democrats saying dumb things...sure.
Biden? Out of sight, out of his mind.
You are right.  "Biden shouldn't throw Trump a lifeline by granting him any debates". That's a losing proposition for Biden, and he (well, his handlers) damn well know it. #Trump2020
Barr has always talked a good game.  Meanwhile announced no charges for leaking and lying to congress for Comey and McCabe.  Said no more politics, immediately announced no investigation into Obama and Biden... a purely political announcement.  He's lead whitewasher.
I understand the case conservative Democrats make for voting for Joe Biden is taking back the SCOTUS. I only wish they would also acknowledge that it would cost the lives of hundreds of thousands more who are without healthcare because Joe Biden doesn't believe in #MedicareForAll
As much as you want to convince me a Joe Biden presidency is better than 4 more years of Trump, we'll be stuck in the same situation in terms of healthcare. Both of them want to keep this barbaric system that is tied to our employment as we're seeing record number unemployment.
Either way, we'll be in under great hardships under either Trump or Biden. We'll be without healthcare and god help us if we get sick without insurance during a global pandemic. Neither of them support single payer. We'll suffer greatly.
Barr  Comey and McCabe off for leaking and lying to congress, said no more political DOJ decisions, then promptly announces no investigation of Obama and Biden.  Bill "Business as Usual" Barr writes strongly worded letters and talks big. He's the chief whitewasher.
Absurd.  He let Comey and McCabe off for leaking and lying to congress, said no more political DOJ decisions, then promptly announces no investigation of Obama and Biden.  Bill "Business as Usual" Barr writes strongly worded letters and talks big. He's the chief whitewasher.
I agree wholeheartedly with
If you ever wondered how Comey, Biden, Obama, etc etc broke the law in spygate, this video breaks it down step-by-step. Watch with an open mind.
Sounds like democrats here. Biden would probably be on disability along with schitt for brains and schmucker.
The onky threat Donakd Trump is to them is he is exposing the Demonrats and the corruption perpetrated within our government by the likes of scum like Comey, Stryok, Brennan, Pelosi, Biden, Schumer and Schifty.
Honestly, does Bernie still believe Biden would be the most progressive president since FDR? The guy is against progressive ideas.
I think a lot of her lack of support from the black community was do to the fact that we felt like that Biden was the only one that could beat Trump and we weren't going to waist our vote regardless of the skin color.
And to think Bernie believes Biden would be the most progressive candidate since FDR. It's nothing more than a sick joke.
Exactly what we're going to do! We're going to elect Joe Biden!

What?  All of this burning and rioting is bc of your inability to lead our country. I also think it‚Äôs funny that you use actual footage from events that happened recently in your lastest campaign ad and then said, this is what it will be like if Biden was president. #A$$hat
reporting! Here's me w a #feetinterview on the #streetinterview scene at  chicago    Wonder if she's HRC/BIDEN?
No doubt that Biden is being used but he also is allowing it. He knows what the Socialists are up to. He worked alongside Communist &amp; ISIS sympathizer Obama for 8 years &amp; helped to tear this nation apart. Now he &amp; his army of evil (Satan's Soldiers) plan to finish their work.
I expect nothing from Bill "Business as Usual" Barr, and he's surprised me by exactly how little he's accomplished.  Said, "No more politics at DOJ!"  Followed by, "Obama and Biden won't be investigated"!  Comey and McCabe, no charges for leaking/lying to congress. Perfect score.
Joe Biden is a little scardy cat! He‚Äôs scared to pieces about debates with PRESIDENT TRUMP!!! Hahaha. He‚Äôs a coward!
Bill "Business as Usual" Barr is useless.  He writes stern letters, gives hard-talking speeches, then says, Obama and Biden won't be investigated, Comey and McCabe...no charges for leaking and lying to congress.  These people are useless trough-feeders.
I don't think it's going to be Kamala because of all the VP picks she's the only one that's being seen the most. Biden's about to throw a curveball and pick either Elizabeth Warren or Michigan Governor's Gretchen Whitmer.
Exactly. Pelosi, Schumer, Biden, and the rest of the Clinton-worshipping conservative core of the Democratic party don't care anymore about the American people than the GOP does. The 2 party system is a lie. We live in an oligarchy. Period.
Very nice of Mike Pence to provide this footage for the next Biden ads in Florida.

The ideas and policies that Nancy Pelosi and Joe Biden are vehemently opposed to. Like #MedicareForAll for example.
Probably. From what I understand, Joe Biden got the bulk of the VA vote from Northern Virginia, which is close to DC. It's a haven for establishment Democrats. Hell, nearly all of VA is an establishment haven. There's hardly any progressives here, despite being a blue state.
Yeah photo shoots are fun.üòÇ  Biden was kissing that girl in real time. (Not Staged)
To those who are upset about Bernie's delegates doing this, it's called "earning their votes". Last time I checked, this is still a democracy and not a coronation. Biden is not entitled to their votes just because he's the presumptive nominee.
And Joe Biden can do better. He can tell us what he is going to do for our Country, which is probably nothing.
Worse, Barr announced no charges for McCabe and Comey for their leaks and lying to congress and no invest of Obama/Biden  Barr says he has full faith in Wray who says he's seen no evidence of bias affected decisions  Wake up  Bill "Business as Usual" Barr leads the whitewash crew
You spelled Joe Biden wrong
Bill Barr made a very political announcement when he said neither Obama nor Biden we‚Äôre going to be investigated.  Barr‚Äôs DOJ publicly announced no charges for Comey and McCabe leaks or lying to Congress.

JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
I'm not sure what happened, but there's no doubt in my mind that Biden and his team did what he did here in VA and coalesced the representatives and told their voters their marching orders. They were organized to a fucking T
I live in Virginia and I saw no signs of any ground game here for Biden and yet he won it by wide margins. All he did was gather endorsement from Democratic representatives here and that's all he needed. It taught me a harsh lesson about how politics is played here and I hate it.
I'm going to need the Biden campaign to stop making it so hard to vote for him. Have Chris Dodd sit down. Keep Biden in the basement. Just let Trump make Biden's case for him. The best thing the Biden campaign can do for the next 99 days is just keep quiet.
Maybe, but this is Biden we're talking about. Being tone deaf isn't a bug.

PLEASE, DON'T ANY DEMOCRAT ASK OR ANSWER A QUESTION THAT CALLS FOR TELLING WHAT DUMB trump CAN DO OR SAY TO MAKE HIS CHANCES BETTER TO BEAT JOE BIDEN, PLEASE!

My FIL was (just retired) a high income exec and thought putting in the WH was a good idea.   Now he and I think many like him see the disaster and are either 1.  Sitting out (dad) 2.  Voting Biden
The 'silent majority' (üòÖü§£üòÇü§™üñïü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è) are people like my father in law, who thought having s 'business man in the WH' sounded good, and now realize how much of a mistake that was and are now either 1.  Sitting out (dad)  2.  Voting for Biden
I don't think President Trump is the one called out in the current Ukraine government corruption investigation &amp; trial. It seems your Presidential Candidate Joe Biden is the person listed.  Sorry...Facts hurt...
The Biden campaign really needs to push Early Voting where ever possible.  We cannot afford to have long lines on election day with stormtroopers out and about.
She cherry picks whose racist and who isn‚Äôt, Not gon lie Biden has done questionable things, but Trump gets a pass? Plus doesn‚Äôt Melissa realize Trump used to be a Democrat himself? Where was the outrage then?
Biden won't dare, tho - he can't even string enough words together to create a coherent sentence.
Biden talks about unifying the country while his decades as a politician show he‚Äôs accomplished pretty much zip and has done nothing for the minorities he supposedly cares so much about.
I don‚Äôt support Joe Biden at all but I absolutely would LOVE to see Trump Lose, imagine how pissed Trump voters would be? Ah the tables would ultimately turn and I can already see the excuses, in case you‚Äôre wondering, I‚Äôm supporting an Independent candidate in November.
Yes, Sir PRESIDENT BIDEN!!
Text TRUMP to 88022! I stand with   I think Basement Biden's lawyers will have him plead the 5th on this issue.  Even though he probably doesn't know what pleading the 5th means.
Huh.... oh..... now I see why you are voting for biden... carry on
Trump. Out. Biden. In. Peace.
Yes!  in August the are having Signs Across America for Joe Biden.
When Biden loses, he will think that he won. And then he'll write a book... What what what what what what what happened.
It‚Äôs Chris Cillizza who loves tearing down women. Soon as Biden chooses the VP Cillizza will spend the rest of the run to the election pointing out every negative over &amp; over &amp; over‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..
Is it bot behavior when people are still on the fence about Joe Biden since he doesn't believe in a single payer system  and he still believes healthcare should be tied to employment even in a pandemic with record high unemployment?
By bots, you mean voters who have issues with Biden's record on criminal justice? Are they considered bots if they take issue with the fact that Joe Biden doesn't support full legalization of marijuana? Is it bot behavior to say Joe Biden doesn't support Medicare for All?
I wish all 350,000 of my followers would cut and paste this and tweet it out right now:  JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.

Loved seeing her too,  let‚Äôs not get people all balled up over Biden‚Äôs VP choice,  winning this election is bigger &amp;we shouldn‚Äôt put in people‚Äôs head that they are some how dejected with HIS choice.  This election is bigger than a VP choice and yes getting rid of trump is BIGGER!
I love all the  black VP choices &amp; I love Warren too, staying home if Biden doesn‚Äôt choose a black vp is  like saying if you don‚Äôt choose who I want give me 4 more years of Trump.  They didnt vote for Biden , but here we are, let‚Äôs not make it harder than it already is.
Let's Not Take Our Eyes Of The Ball Rep.John Lewis Said. Donald Trump Is The Ball  Trump IS Lying On   Joe Biden said He Want To Reform The Police Not DeFund.  Trump IS A Liar  Conman he will and has Sold his Soul To The Devil.

That was the full Biden quote and there are parentheses.
Can‚Äôt imagine 20% of this country voting for this dangerous fool! If the election is fair‚Äîno Russian/Trump fraud‚ÄîBiden should have a walk in the park toward victory.  It‚Äôs what happens after that‚Äî given the economy, the virus, the US debt &amp; Trump detritus that worries me!üë†
Unfortunately, I think he would be bored on SC! And, he‚Äôs never served as a judge and I don‚Äôt  believe he‚Äôs ever tried a case... He‚Äôs a brilliant man and a real people person.  I‚Äôd love to have him back as POTUS!  Or, VEEP this time!  He and Mr. Biden make a good team! üë†
Yes. A vote for anyone other than Biden is a vote for 45.
Before liberals twist George Carlin's words, understand he was heavily critical of both parties and he knew that politicians are in the back pockets of wealthy corporations, the "owners" as he calls them. He would have dragged both Trump and Biden if he were alive today.
A very good, if not the only, reason to vote for Biden.
ALL THIS IS HAPPENING UNDER TRUMPS AMERICA,  NOT OBAMA NOT BIDEN,  NOT HILLARY,  TRUMP
I always wondered why everyday people (the single mom who works three jobs, the college student trying to come up with tuition, the immigrant fleeing oppression in his homeland) don't fly Biden flags on their boats ü§î  #SundayThoughts  #TrumpIsACompleteFailure #AmericaWakeUp
Feckless idiots think George Carlin was referring to President Donald Trump.  He was actually speaking about career politicians like, Pelosi, Schumer, Biden, Waters, Schiff, etc.  Doh!
July 26th marks the 100 days of work Norfolk must do to elect Joe Biden, Mark Warner, Bobby Scott, and Elaine Luria. We need your help right in your own precinct and neighborhood. Please sign up to save America.
ONLY think Biden is doing to win my reluctant support is drawing a "aggressive" climate policy. I want ExxonMobil thrown is jail as much as you. Will I take massive infrastructure investments &amp; economic support to pll hurt as we shift energy balance away from dead dinosaurs. Yep
Yes because I'm voting for Biden regardless of who he  other words, Elizabeth Warren,yes Karen Bass yes, mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms yes, Susan Rice yes, Tammy Duckworth yes.
Biden is going to throw everybody a curveball and pick Michigan's Governor Gretchen Whitmer
So what happens if President Trump disputes election results in November?  story says a bipartisan group has gamed it out and ... the results aren‚Äôt pretty.
Russia is not our problem.  China, Biden, Democrats, Socialism, ALL seem to be on the same page. They are all trying to turn USA into chaos!
your mouth is as big as Joe Biden.  You should shut up tooü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
Biden said he's gunna pick a black lady VP.  Probably Sean Hannity.
And the kicker of all kickers, Robert Byrd of the KKK died as a card carrying democrat, AFTER he trained Joe Biden and Hillary Clinton, 2 people with their name all over the school to prison pipeline and the Crime bill of 1994. But yeah the parties switched
In 2008 Joe Biden didn't win a single delegate or state but President Obama picked him as his VP.
Biden's going to throw everybody a curve ball and Pick Michigan's Governor Gretchen Whitmer.Kamala won't galvanized the black women vote like people think. Keisha Lance Bottoms could but but resume may be too light.
this is out of control. When Biden wins can we charge Fox News for spreading hate speech!?
you do understand your enemy should be trump, not biden right? or are you intentionally trying to split the vote so trump wins again
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.

I am ready to vote for him. A life with Biden is no life for honest hard working people. Trump 2020
This is such a lazy and factually inaccurate  take. 1. HRC‚Äôs campaign was not polling at numbers Biden is at this time/places. 2. We‚Äôre in the middle of pandemic, so the campaigns are patently different in how they‚Äôve been run. 3. Biden‚Äôs platform far more progressive than HRC.
Those who hang with Biden are ok with illegal spying, wiretapping, multiple examples of racist statements and over 40 years of doing nothing for the people he supposedly cares so much about
Baby, you need help. Please do yourself some good and commit yourself for a few months to get back where you need to be. You've got babies that depend on you. Then when you're on the right track, come out and VOTE BIDEN!!
Not to send: watch Joy Reid interview w Biden
Announcing that neither Biden nor Obama would be investigated WAS PURELY A POLITICAL ANNOUNCEMENT.  Bill "Business as Usual" Barr is lead whitewasher.
Bro, Trump is going to win in the biggest landslide victory ever.... have you not been paying attention?? Biden is a chomo and almost everyone knows this... How can you support a man of his character?? He messes with little girls and tries kissing them while rubbing on them...
Saw a Joe Biden ad on TV last night and it was one of the best election ads I've ever seen. Emotional and negative but positive enough not to seem over the top. Superior to anything I saw from Hillary four years ago. The former VP has some smart people running his campaign.
It‚Äôs not about ME, it‚Äôs about YOU and US per biden 2020! Vote crooked trump out !  Please ! Rapist, racist, fake president, crooked, alarmist towards racism , monies towards his golf courses, womanizer , lier, lier, lier vote trump out please! Walls of mommies !!
Reports that the trump pushed to move british open to his own Fuckin Golf Course raises questions?? Bitch this shit was happen last year and I was disappointed and disgusted then just as I am disappointed and disgusted NOW!! Vote this crooked fake man out !! Biden please
#nevertrumpersareScum  Please realize trumps mission is to regain American wealth and stop trafficking  #ye point is to beat biden
If there is one perk to Donald Trump's presidency it's the fact that my wife has been drinking way too much! And I take full advantage of that!üòÅ just being honest! But, when Joe Biden wins we are going to double up on that drinking in Celebration!! Biden 2020!!
Here's a better one of Donald Trump hanging with two known child molesters! This one's not photoshopped it's real! I wonder if Melania used to recruit little girls also! It wouldn't surprise me oh, nothing surprises me with these mobsters!! Biden 2020!
You nailed it! Biden 2020!!
I can't wait.   I think many people will vote just to 'twist the knife' so to speak. Biden will win virginia, and I have no state electrons, but I'm still going, just to add my vote to the list to say 'fuck you' to #CadetBoneSpurs

Thank you. Period. Vote biden 2020
He'll use this against Joe Biden and it's going to work because the Democrats have not learned a damn thing.Wait what? But Kamala is too ambitious? Oh hell to the no.  Let's hear now why it's a travesty that a VP would want to be the next president. Isn't that the whole point? Especially when the president is the age of Biden?  Oh hell to the no.
Really hoping Biden is listening to Black Women and that this very legit anger is alleviated soon.
That‚Äôs the goal. Biden and Harris have laid out achievable plans.
Vote for Biden because you won't have a future if you don't.
we just got 50% in rasmussen, and much higher in our internal polls. we are doing a new ad campaign on sleepy joe biden that will be out on monday. he has been brought even further left than crazy bernie sanders ever thought possible. by the way, bernie‚Äôs folk love me on trade!

That is a bizarre thing for Biden to say - why does he think Americans need to know that?
3 months ago I would have bet on Trump 100%, but now Biden is ahead like 10% and states such as Texas and Georgia are considered tossups... Trump re-election is not going to happen at this point as far as I can see.
Grab the Popcorn: Biden Allies Reportedly Waging a ‚ÄòShadow‚Äô War to Derail Kamala Harris from Democratic Ticket
‚Äú... re-establish our credibility.‚Äù  ‚ÄúOther nations know they can trust Joe Biden ...‚Äù  I don‚Äôt care about our regaining our bogus status as The Greatest Country In The World.  I just want us to be seen as credible and trustworthy.  It‚Äôs been horrible to lose that.
Don‚Äôt know how Biden‚Äôs plan dovetails with that; he wants to protect and strengthen and expand ACA.  Seems to me they‚Äôre complementary approaches.
I voted Biden.. but on second thought.. it would be sad. Also, Trump dunking on the media would be hilarious.
I have a proposition... can we elect Biden, but have Obama just do everything?
Biden has always been clear that the eventual goal is universal healthcare. Stop being ridiculous. üôÑ
The greatest people are at John Lewis's final funeral service.  The people we yearn and ache for.  The people who truly made America Great.  Bill Clinton, Joe Biden and of course the amazing Barack Obama.  Hate was not invited to his funeral.
He'll keep trying to move it until the polls say he's close enough to Biden to fix the result
Assuming Joe Biden wins and is inaugurated as President, and immediately orders a nationwide mask wearing mandate, will trumpkins and the great right stupid protest in the street for their 'freedom of no mask wearing'?  I suspect they will, trump will keep spewing and covid grows
Against any rational candidate Biden would lose. But Americans who are not totally tribal, like my wife, will vote for him to end the Trump madness.  We just pray he doesn't start another war, which ironically he is more likely to do than Trump.
I too don‚Äôt understand why   could not be THE candidate. Is he going to be his VP if Biden gets the top job?
Nobody knows who those 3% are. They may simply be folks who refuse to join the public option, since (for now) the SCOTUS has blocked a mandate.  Biden has been clear that the goal has always been universal healthcare.
Joe Biden's running mate - none will satisfy all sections of the party
This is ridiculous!! Biden folks get your act together.
Joe Biden says if he gets elected and gets done what he is promising he will be the most "progressive President in history."  Gee, didn't  token Republican  call Joe Biden a centrist?
I'm all in with Yang, he'll be great for the US, but he is not on the ballot. The logic is go with the next best option at this point and that is Biden obviously.  Please explain the logic of 4 more years of Trump. #yang2024
Biden's handlers know he would go off into never-never-land in a hard hitting, one-on-one interview. They cannot permit their sock puppet being exposed. But if he were to be elected, they will get rid of him quickly, expressing how brave was.

In 2016 I couldn't vote for 45 and I didn't care for Hilary either. I regret that I "wasted my vote" on Gary Johnson. Let's get Biden in the WH in Nov and use 4 years to focus on a legit 3rd party candidate. #independentsforBiden  #Yang2024
How are they going to keep Biden away from the debates - his dementia is getting worse, week by week.
Yep. Biden is hardly better than Trump in the creepiness factor.
Do you actually believe that's what Biden meant? Is this all performative for you?
Joe Biden just issued a statement calling for the arrest of anarchists, simply for BEING anarchists, which is very explicitly not illegal.  It should also be noted that Biden and Trump have now joined together in openly calling for the political persecution of the same people.

....would destroy our american cities, and worse, if sleepy joe biden, t'ruddy puppet of t'left, ever won. markets would crash and cities would burn. our country would suffer like never before. we will beat t'virus, soon, and go on t'golden age - better than ever before!
How does announcing early help defeat Trump? Honestly asking.  Isn't it better to take the time to vet the candidates and think it over? Give candidates time to get out there and see how well they push Biden?
Misogynistic white dude finds a list of female politicians "flawed." Definitely headline material. üôÑ  Do these people have no self-awareness whatsoever?
Thanks Connie! Biden I think, will win by a large margin because after 3.5  years, most Americans are finally realizing how utterly inept at governing Trump is, how morally deficient and uncaring he is, and that he has cost American lives by his Coronavirus denial and response.
I don‚Äôt know why Biden hasn‚Äôt told Dodd et all to STFU.   And I find it hard to believe that ‚Äî even if Biden didn‚Äôt appoint KH ‚Äî he‚Äôd want everyone to think it‚Äôs because ‚Äúshe was mean to him about race.‚Äù Definitely not a good look!  I‚Äôm gonna take a wait and see on this.

Yeah I know #NotAll üòÇ  Wouldn‚Äôt be surprised to see her in some kind of role in the Biden Administration. She has a few qualifications üòâ
If anything that is a point in favor of biden because dem voters would be forced to see that they‚Äôre hypocrites if they just side with him and give up on BLM. I think it would cause a divide in dems in office as well unless they are literally all frauds which is possible.
And it will be Jo Biden #Biden2020
I truly hate people who pretend to know how others think and try to fool everyone. Everybody knows Biden is not a socialist and democrats are not socialist either.  Socialism XXI in Latin america was a social engineering project created by the Pentagon as Project Camelot

Essentially: Conservatives (or Tories) are like Republicans, Labour are like Democrats, Boris Johnson is Trump, Jeremy Corbyn is Bernie Sanders, Keir Starmer is Joe Biden. The Russia Report is like your Mueller report. We are both controlled by Putin.
Soon he'll be claiming Biden wants to make puppies illegal.
Lying about Biden being against fracking is one thing, but does anyone on Earth believe Biden is anti-steel? That's just insane.  Why not just claim that Biden is against puppies and wants to murder them all if you're going to be this insane about it?
there is nay way a place like pennsylvania can vote for t'ruddy radical left and their puppet, joe biden, when they are against fracking, steel production, and just about everything else that pennsylvania stands for. likewise, texas, and many other states!!!
Biden wasn't even in my top 10 pics for POTUS, but he's the guy we've picked. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è  I can get behind him and help save the republic from Trumpism or I can be a useless sack of shit like you and pretend Biden and Trump are the same. Or that Pelosi gave Trump "everything he wanted."
Again, gibberish. Accepting the reality of the two party system and voting for the guy the primary voters nominated is not "Blue MAGA." That you think voting for Biden is equivalent to being a hardcore Trump supporters is further evidence of your brain worms.
So if Joe Biden and Obama were in charge for 8 years and you had other Democrat Presidents, why have they allowed this?
slurring his words in that sit down with  whatever #Obama says ppl want to be safe, I guess he means from the Chinese virus, not from the party rioting #peacefulprotests in the streets. #Biden didn‚Äôt even respond to statement plus it was unintelligible.
t'trump campaign has more enthusiasm, according t'many, than any campaign in't history of our champion country - even more than 2016. biden has none! t'silent majority will speak on november third!!! fake suppression polls &amp; a load of old flannel will not save t'radical left.
crazy nancy pelosi said i made a mistake when i banned folk from infected china from entering t'u.s. in january. tens of thousands of lives were saved, as she danced in't streets of chinatown (sf) in late february. biden agreed wi' her, but soon admitted that i were reet!
this week you had joe biden call arizona a city. nowt matters wi' him, however, because t'ruddy opposition party (lamestream media) covers everything oop - especially t'corruption. t'ruddy obama/biden administration is t'most corrupt in history. they even spied on me campaign!

This case is not only important on its own but demonstrates what could happen if Joe Biden wins the presidencyüò•üò¨
I mean, against Reade there were literal generations of Biden staffers saying that not only has he never done it to them but it seems against everything they know about him. üôÑ
What the fuck are you talking about? Biden is crushing him.  Anyone COULD lose. Negative partisanship is real and about 40% of the country gets only right-wing news.  WTF is wrong with you?
I don't understand how politically illiterate you have to be to think 2016 is the same election as 2020. Biden isn't running as a pseudo-incumbent. He's running during a time when Trump has set the country on fire, FFS.
Yup. For every dirtbag leftist vote Biden loses in Williamsburg or Silver Lake he gains like 10 votes in swing state suburbs.
I dare say the real powers that be, will rig the election for Biden to win and Hilary will be his VP and quickly take over when Bidens poor health is diagnosed (üôÑ)
Particularly as this isn't something I NEED to read up on. Biden is gonna chose whoever he wants. If it's someone I don't know enough about yet I can read up on them then.
Well, "folks", not necessarily Biden.  He's been pretty clear that one of his concerns is the future of the party and helping to set up future leadership.  It's one of the reasons why Harris has been so blindingly obvious to most pundits all along.
Anyone who supports Trump but goes at Biden for coherent sentences is obviously so mentally screwed up that they don't know what a coherent sentence actually is.  Find one clip of Trump making a normal coherent speech or get back in your box

Funny how you conflated WDC football with biden.  Seriously dude, you got nothing better to do?  Oh yea, you're a trumper so i guess not.
It is not a threat. Trump is threatening that he will stay if Biden wins. IN THAT CASE he has to be kicked out. Plain and simple
You write about all your failed relationships with men but tell us to vote for Biden. üòÇü§£üò∑ You should stay out of politics.
obama, who wouldn‚Äôt even endorse biden until everyone else were out of t'primaries (and even then waited a long time!), is now making a commercial of support. remember, i wouldn‚Äôt even be here if it weren‚Äôt for them. i wouldn‚Äôt be president. they did a terrible job!
This is for ppl telling us to vote 4 biden. Its exactly the point.
Ppl laugh at tweets like this but we need to be vigilant. Trump is using the protests to spread fear about a Biden presidency. Things like this appeal to a lot of ppl who can't see this is Trumps doing. A Biden win in November is not in the bag.
I know. Ppl can't just assume Biden will win in November.
Yes. Things happening under the Trump regime should be blamed on Joe Biden. Only the simple minded would fall for this.
"Donald Trump is America's first racist president" - Joe Biden  So are we just gonna ignore the 12 that owned black slaves, then?
This is Trump's America though. Not Biden's.  Who's side are you on exactly?But you said Biden was out of line to suggest just this a few months ago.  You owe him an apology.
I‚Äôm pretty sure at least Kellyanne Conway‚Äôs husband will find no place for him in Biden‚Äôs government
Trump will get double if not Triple the votes of Biden
That‚Äôs because Obama and Biden never had any intention of doing so
They're using the same polls they did in 2016. No way is creepy dementia Biden leading.
Good luck your orders won't last long once Biden is elected November 2020.  Less than 100 days away.  America or Trump.
#SettleForBiden sounds exactly like #GirlIGuessImWithHer . Biden lost already. I‚Äôm callin it, I have no hope üòÇ
In response to Joe Biden's plan to address housing inequity, Donald Trump attempts to stoke a racial panic.
When Nadler makes a statement like that he makes Joe Biden sound like a mental giant.
Credit for saying he loses four out of five times.  More like 4.5 or 4.75 out of 5.  I think folks are looking for a horserace where one just doesnt exist. Biden's lead has had HISTORICAL length.  Just as Bernie found out on Super Tuesday, running against HRC was just easier....*
On second thought, unfollowing Peter Baker.  I can't stomach the stories he re-tweets. Horserace boredom.  Would love to look back on what he re-tweeted during those Iowa / NH / "Biden is dead" days of February.*  Geez.
Biden is a disgrace and embarrassment to our country. Worst, most corrupt, treasonous VP ever ü§Æ
Biden should carry on as he is doing, that wat Trump will  win
Joe Biden is just a puppet on a string for the Democrats to try to regain power but it‚Äôs not gonna work !!!
I was a  GOP volunteer before I could vote. I backed Bush, Dole, W, McCain, and Romney. In 2016, I backed Rubio, then Cruz, then Kasich, then I left the GOP. I backed Clinton. I'm backing Biden (I call myself the conservative feather of the Democratic Party, so I may not count).
Most Pennsylvanians see through your charade.  Biden is a Pennsylvanian born and raised.  He has lived PA values.  He is a practicing Catholic. His wife is a teacher.  He grew up in steel country. He is far more blue collar than you have ever been.  The con is up.  #Biden2020

Sidenote: Just a reminder that I said the Anti-Iowa, Anti-New Hampshire vote was palpable, and could not WAIT to vote, despite IA's/NH's opinion during the primary.*  I also said this both pre-caucuses, AND post-caucuses, during the BREATHLESS "Biden is done" narrative.*

I think Biden's been in the basement a little too long.
Allies of Russian dictator Vladimir Putin hoping to give President Donald Trump a second term in office appear to have a new partner: Republican Ron Johnson, who is using his Senate committee to renew debunked allegations against Joe Biden.
With Biden having that connection to Obama, they can pull in the Obama vote. Then they put in as his VP a (loud-mouthed) black female and they pander to blacks and females.
Shorter version: Biden used to lie and say dumb stuff all the time but now he stops himself from doing it so he must be going senile. As  puts it, Trumpism corrupts.Me kicking in the door to vote for Joe Biden. You fragile, narcissistic child.

I think you're looking at a misleading snipped of a state poll, not a national tracking polls, or an average of polls. The Rasmusses result is less bad for Trump, but not far off the others at Biden +6. not -2.

There are political reasons for Biden to unveil the pick relatively shortly before the Aug. 17 kickoff of the Democratic National Convention, since that timing could add some excitement to the gathering while minimizing the opportunity for GOP attacks.

Keep dreaming. You know Biden is kicking your ass and you're losing support everywhere.
Some folks are acting as if Joe Biden hasn't been on the receiving end of this process before. He will make the final and best decision. Period.   P.S Never thought I'd see the day when right-wing propaganda was being co-opted by those seeking to discredit shortlisted candidates.

I‚Äôd like to think that Biden will just go with Bass to spite Chait at this point.
It makes ZERO sense ‚Äî unless you want #MoscowMitch to continue his obstruction and corrupt control of the Senate, crippling Biden &amp; stifling the will of the American people, just like he did with Obama.  ü§Øüò°ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
A Biden win will be a breath of fresh air.... I‚Äôll have to re-order my entire physic back to dealing with sanity in high places! ... and more good stuff from people who care about how to intelligently deal with both the spread of the virus and stabilizing our economy! Can‚Äôt wait!
Last time Biden ignored the very online left he mounted one of the biggest comebacks in primary history, steamrolled to the nomination far sooner than anyone expected and carved out a formidable national + Electoral College advantage over Donald J. Trump.
It would most likely stay consistent with the statistics on the frequency of riots in the US. So Trump is wrong and Biden won‚Äôt stop riots.
Kamala pushes back: ‚ÄúThere will be a resistance to your ambition. There will be people who say to you, ‚ÄòYou are out of your lane,‚Äô because they are burdened by only having the capacity to see what has always been instead of what can be."
Biden‚Äôs pick for Secretary of State will be just as consequential. Nobody wants to talk about that because it‚Äôs not as sexy. The Sec. of State will be deeply involved in Paris Agreement, climate change policy, and coordinating our response to the pandemic.

Biden+China+Ukraine+The Media=Sell out.  How do you not see this?
If it‚Äôs just a question of who Biden feels comfortable with, it will be Rice. But it‚Äôs not just a question of that, and Rice can always be SoS or Chief of Staff (which she is better suited for IMO). Of all the other choices, Harris is  the safest. It‚Äôs pretty easy.
The other thing I‚Äôve learned is, Joe Biden is smarter at politics than me. He‚Äôs smarter than twitter too. So he‚Äôll make the right call.

The democratic party knows they don't have to offer us ANYTHING because Trump is so "bad", (which he is, i know) and we have no choice and pick Biden otherwise "we" are bad people.  And i won't succumb to this. We have to show them we won't take this deal.
And to be clear, Biden violating his pledge to not increase taxes on households with income under $400k is w/e.  The pledge itself is bad.
I never said not to vote Biden. If you look back the original tweet is asking why Biden hasn‚Äôt come out for recurring cash payments that both a majority of D‚Äôs and R‚Äôs support.
That said, I‚Äôm not buying that Harris is more qualified than Karen Bass. Just a different skill set. Bass would be more effective shepherding Biden‚Äôs agenda through the House.

Yes, Biden is plummeting in the polls as we speak. Biden‚Äôs poll numbers are very receptive to the topic of the day on Twitter.
That's the whole thing about this issue, is that Biden should not let these two anywhere near his decision making process regarding VP pick or anything else.
Educated guess: Joe Biden will pick Kamala Harris as the VP nominee on or before August 3rd.  FACT: Ed Rendell is a piece of shit. Always has been. And always will be.

Bernie Sanders supporters really hate Biden and really wants Trump to win.

#WeWillVote early &amp; for Joe Biden. #VoteEarly
You‚Äôre trying to sway Biden. It‚Äôs sickening how you think you can help destroy a party &amp; then have a say in the other. This didn‚Äôt start w/Trump. The #SouthernStrategy started under Nixon &amp; trickle down economics came from Ronnie. Both of those things have harmed us for decades.
Why I won‚Äôt vote for Biden:
Interview with Sen. Tammy Duckworth &amp; Discussion on Joe Biden Campaign
The choice isn't likely to make or break Biden's campaign and it isn't likely to radically change his administration if he wins. But I think it matters to the extent that it sets the VP pick up for the nomination in 2024 or 2028.
If Joe Biden wins the election, he may have an opportunity to not just repair relations with the United Kingdom but also help London figure out its post-Brexit role in Europe and beyond,  argues.
#Trump 2016 was instructive: old rules don't apply. Go big.  We saw how boring #Clinton/#Kaine &amp; #Romney/#Ryan were‚Ä¶ that's #Biden/#Bass. Snoozefest.  He won't win playing it safe in a basement. #Warren can turn down the woke, turn out the soccer moms &amp; energize youth. #VPWarren
I get that; I want the VP to win the following 8 years. I hope this ticket moves more progressive. The 1st 2 years will be a heavy workload given how bad everything is. I want the VP to focus on winning during the 2nd 2 years. Biden‚Äôs not going to make it through a 2nd term.
Unless Trump plans to occupy the White House illegally, a postponed election wouldn‚Äôt keep him in office.  In fact, it could well usher in an unelected President Joe Biden

I'm not sure what "Never Trump" means anymore, but there's a swath of voters ranging from reluctant Trump voters, to abstainers, to hold your nose and vote Biden. More than a few dozen. Maybe millions. And how we answer these questions will inform what kind of voters they become.
Biden likely to name his running mate in second week of August
I think any Black woman on Biden's VEEP short list is capable. Which one are y'all gonna not drag through the mud on a daily basis for the next 4 years. If it's Karen Bass please let Joe choose her and move on. Cuz the way this app tears down THEE senator from CA is infuriating.
LOL Again, were any of this true, why did Trump wait over three and a half years until he was less than 100 days out from the election, and losing badly to Biden?  Trump could have magically solved all our problems all these years and simply chose not to? Right.
No. Absolutely not.   If I gotta start wearing goggles I am checking out and joining ‚ÄúTeam Hoax‚Äù cuz I am not gonna be doing this. Nope. No.   #Biden #Biden2020 #COVID19 #coronavirus
I question the foreign policy thing as Biden has this pretty well settled. But as this point Harris is the only one ready for primetime so I really don't see how it isn't her at this point.
I‚Äôm sorry, but it is genuinely impossible for any candidate‚Äîeven a highly skilled political candidate, which Trump is decidedly not‚Äîto overcome these types of numbers. He‚Äôs done. As long as Biden doesn‚Äôt suffer a stroke or faint at a campaign event, he‚Äôs the next president.

Joe Biden will need a running mate who can "throw a punch and take a punch" Mark Shields says on
Of course not. We looked at this in impeachment. There was nothing there then and there is nothing there now.
Me on my way to a conversation about Biden‚Äôs VP:
&gt; Trump has shown himself susceptible to rope-a-dope.  &gt; A Biden VP choice who has the skills to goad Trump into throwing punches at her will lead to more rope-a-dope. (Kaine didn't have such skills.)  &gt; So yes, the choice could be consequential.
This is the dream. Newsom appointing someone from the CA delegation if he picks Harris.  A little boy can dream about Senator Schiff leading a post-Trump bicameral truth commission during the early years of the Biden administration
On Thursday, as national and battleground state polls show Trump in political peril in his race against Democrat Joe Biden, he went even further, floating the idea of delaying the election until it could be conducted in person.

Biden has said he only plans to serve for a single term, shouldn‚Äôt we WANT an ambitious VP? Like wtf.
Self admitted plagiarist   who lied about his Law School Class Ranking says he can get Christian's to vote for him. Wrong, 1 of many reasons Christian's will never vote Biden is the murder of babies &amp; genocide after birth killings he supports!
You must be kidding. The rise of China at the expense of American jobs started with Clinton.   Trump has been there 3 years!   Who has been right there in Washington letting it happen for decades? BIDEN.    Fool.
Former Vice President Biden previously said he would announce his running mate the first week of August. It looks like that date may be pushed back.
Joe Biden can‚Äôt even remember where he is.
Joe Biden and the "party of science" never miss an opportunity to push their alarmist agenda, even if the facts aren't on their side...
#Kamala would stick the knife in #Biden's back the minute she were in line for succession. If he won, she'd start plotting to #25thAmendment him the morning of 1/21/21.  What voters would he gain with #KarenBass?  Smart #VP choice: #Warren‚Ä¶ populist folksy Okie-born trustbuster.
I dunno. Biden and Trump both want to target anarchists for political arrests, deny people healthcare, expand wars, and increase funding to violent police departments.  Maybe allowing Dems to paint themselves as the party that care about normal people for so long is the problem?
Heck, Biden isn't my top five choice so it'll be hard to lower my expectations any further.
So you still have the opinions and thoughts as you did 20 years ago?  You haven't grown and evolved on these issues?  As least Biden can admit when he's wrong and try to become a better person.
Not sure how widespread this is, but some taxpayers with income under $400k will face income tax increases due to Biden's 28% cap on itemized deductions.  This deserves further investigation.
Trump Halts TV Advertising as He Struggles in Polls Against Biden via ‚Å¶ ‚Å¶ and me

Joe Biden's The Biden Agenda for Women is insulting: It relegates women to victim status suggesting we have no agency over our lives and careers and no personal responsibility for our outcomes. #IWpol
Trust and believe that Joe Biden will put the smartest people in our country to work to fix everything that Trump has purposefully broken, starting with selecting the fabulous, ass kicker  They will do away with the Senate filibuster and transform America.
Cash payments isn‚Äôt a #YangGang policy idea though. We just support it the most. It‚Äôs consponosored by Kamala Harris, Bernie Sanders, and Ed Markey in the Senate. Tim Ryan, Ro Khana, Katie Porter, and many others in the house. This thing would get done if Biden got behind it.
The president's campaign will start running new attack ads against rival Joe Biden on Monday in key early voting states, including Michigan and North Carolina.  from
I can see that. Though maybe Agnew in 1968.  In any event b/c Trump is so easy to goad, my thought is Biden's VP could make a tactical difference. Trump's shown he's susceptible to rope-a-dope &amp; if Biden's VP can get Trump to throw punches at her, all the better. üçø

The only Biden potential VP choice who would be more of a risk to Biden than Harris is HRC. Either would give him a shove the first time he neared the ledge.Allies say Karen Bass's reputation as a bridge-builder would make her a strong partner to presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden.
Ummm... we aren't loyal to Biden. We criticize him sometimes, believe it or not. We just don't hold the country hostage when other lefties/liberals/Dems don't nominate him.
Not as cult like as me pointing out Bernie taking a similar position to Biden on the crime bill and you blithely dismissing it.
The articles spell out why Biden most likely didn't rape her. Read them for yourself. I'm not your first grade English teacher.
That's horrific, but that doesn't change the fact that the crime bill had broad support at the time (from both black and white communities) and that Biden didn't draft it for racist reasons -- no matter how hard you want to convince yourself that he did.
And I'm pointing out to you that BIDEN wasn't the only person behind the crime bill. It also wasn't BIDEN's intent for disproportionate mass incarceration to happen (the CBC wouldn't have backed the bill if it was). '94 was a different time that you don't seem to understand.
I'm pointing out that the CBC supported the crime bill along with Joe Biden while üåπ Twitter tried to depict Biden as an enemy of the black community.  You know... context.  Which you don't seem to grasp.
I'd be willing to put money on it! He's just like my poor Mom was at one time before she got worse and worse üò¢‚òπÔ∏è til she didn't even know me. Now she doesn't know Daddy, her husband of almost 73 years! How very sad. BIDEN definitely has it!!! He needs to be in a nursing home.

Postponing the election would not postpone the date of the transition of administrations if Biden were to win. I see no problem with it.
Woah, looks like I was right.
Ridin with Biden is cool
So what is wrong with a woman wanting to be president? We know Biden wanted to president when was VP. Why is an ambitious woman considered a threat?  knows her worth and every other woman should too.
Unreal. Biden sells America out to Ukraine, and Trump is the one impeached for holding him to the same standards as everyone else.
So, how come Biden's bailing them out?
Trump isn't the one talking crazy stuff like Biden that makes no sense.   Plus, should Trump win in 2020, he will be leaving in 2025. But if Biden wins, we'll have to put up with his mental illness for up to 8, and he will leave around 2029, or 2025 if we're lucky.
Joe Biden sniffs women, you should be able to as well.
That may depend on what the Biden campaign's internal polls look like. Is Trump's mishandling of the pandemic putting Biden far enough ahead that he it makes no difference to the downballot Dems which VP he picks?
It will be older black folk like them and Clyburn that Biden will listen to, not randos on Twitter.
That's apparently news to the #KHive. They were the ones (present company included) who've been attacking Biden and his surrogates since y'day over something Dodd said according to a 3rdhand anonymous source. Now they're explicitly pressuring Biden to pick Kamala via Twitter.
The Biden campaign has made it explicitly, repeatedly clear that they are not taking their cues from Twitter. Which would give Rice an advantage.  #KHive ppl antagonizing the campaign over anonymous thirdhand gossip can very well backfire and convince Biden to pick someone else.
If Kamala Harris calling Biden a racist to his face and then being chosen to be his VP doesn‚Äôt sum up the current state of American politics, I‚Äôm not sure what will...
Democrats are bailing out the "white supremacists" that you claim instigated the riots.  Try again.
While Bill Barr destroyed the radical Democrats... Sleepy Joe Biden still doesn‚Äôt know where he is! This is sad! #TheFive #tuesdayvibes
I dont know how it will happen but I just dont think Biden will be on the ticket on Nov 3.
Cedric appeared on CNN as a campaign surrogate for Biden and quite forcefully denounced the Politico article as the gossip piece it was -- certainly more forcefully than what's-her-face on Fox. I didn't say anything about Dodd.
NO, A no vote for Biden is a no vote Biden.
Biden can‚Äôt even get through a scripted presser, he won‚Äôt debate POTUS, you‚Äôll see.

While we are all flipping out about whether Biden will pick Kamala, can we come together and laugh at the fact that even now, months after Bernie withdrew, people from his camp are STILL wishing Nina could be the Democratic running mate?
Says the guy who states he's not voting for Biden.
I wonder if certain corners of the #KHive are aware that they are making it LESS LIKELY that Biden picks Kamala the more they antagonize the campaign.  Team Biden has been open with the fact that they ignore the CW on Twitter when deciding strategy. That INCLUDES the #KHive's CW.
If these really are attacks by the Biden campaign on Kamala, then why isn't Kamala saying something?
I lived in Kentucky and while like everywhere they have their share of "Hicks" they also have a lot of good people who love this country. Biden will take KY! And they will ditch Moscow Mitch!
Never not voted.   You are foolish to believe Biden is any less cogent than Trump is. I realize that Trumpster's are parroting that line.  At their age, both have lost some of their edge.  Biden has always been a gaffe machine at any age but is more capable than Trump.
Biden‚Äôs been in govt. forever and has never fixed a thing. He and his racist girly boy President Barry screwed things up royally. And he wants us to trust him? He can‚Äôt even find his way out of his basement.
I just drove from Va thru WV, Md, Pa to the tip of western NY at Canadian border and saw exactly zero Biden signs. I just don‚Äôt think he will be the candidate.
So why is Biden bailing them out?
Biden still isn't condemning it. Not helping his case.
They both suck but the difference is that Biden will more than likely have a cabinet that actually knows how to do their jobs.

Instead of seeing Trump's tax returns (AGAIN), I think we need to see Biden's senate records. IIRC, he had them sealed, to cover his ass from Tara's allegations.

Biden: ‚ÄúProtesting such brutality is right and necessary. It‚Äôs an utterly American response,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúBut burning down communities and needless destruction is not. Violence that endangers lives is not. Violence that guts and shutters businesses that serve the community is not.‚Äù

I don't worship Biden. He wasn't even my first choice -- Kamala was.  But I am not telling you to ignore racism. I am calling out your dumb tactics and even dumber attitude. I did it with Bernie Bros and I am not afraid to do it with other members of the #KHive.
On this end, it really looks like you're looking for something to be mad about and engaging in some sort of purity test against Biden.  Why? Because it feels less impotent to be mad at Biden than it is to be mad a faceless army of feds? Is that it?
I'm not telling you to ignore racism on the left, I am telling you to FOCUS.  Trump is sending goon squads into major cities, and you have spent the better part of 24 hours nitpicking a Biden comment that most people understood the context for.
Actually, it's a few #KHive people who are hyperventilating this time.  They were hyperventilating about Kasich, too.  They've taken to nitpicking Biden on everything, I think b/c they've assumed for some reason that Kamala won't be his running mate.

"...Russia is again trying to boost President Donald Trump‚Äôs reelection and denigrate his opponent, the presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden, sources who attended the briefing said."

Joe Biden has been an architect &amp; enabler of both the domestic police state &amp; imperialist wars?  Biden wrote the Crime Bill &amp; used his Senate committee powers to fast-track a war based on lies.  Unfortunately, it‚Äôs disqualifying.  What we condone, we own.
Allies say Karen Bass's reputation as a bridge-builder would make her a strong partner to presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden.
if biden wins and keels over a month later the vice president should not only be able to quickly take over the job but should have a vision of what she wants to do with the office.
Since I'll be offline for a while here's my pre-statement on the VP nominee: "Tokenism doesn't excuse militarism and rapacious capitalism; it just normalizes stupidity and cynicism. Joe Biden has just ensured that even his failing capacities provide us no hope."
i continue to think this is total beltway politics brain, divorced completely from the question of governing. whoever biden chooses should a) be prepared to be president and b) should want to be president
Almost as despicable as having a bum like obama down grill of Trump and hold a biden rally, how absolutely shameless and uncouth.
But the truth appears to be otherwise. Most politicians are wind sailors and they go where the wind blows. Apparently that was true of FDR, to some extent. And though I have no hope in Biden, perhaps it's true of him too.
The suggestion that if elected Biden can and must be pushed to the left is worth noting. According to Marxist professor Wolff LBJ would not have done what he did if it weren't for massive pressure from the left.  We tend to think of politicians as either having integrity or not.
Glasnost Gone; Americans are mobilizing around this awareness, Joe Biden is mobilizing policy around this issue - we have been seriously infiltrated and must continue to follow the threads of all Putins' initiatives. Molly McGew - 'If we fight, we win.'

Democrats called the FBI after finding shipping receipt for anti-Biden dirt sent to Devin Nunes from overseas
More negativity. I'm sorry you spend 700 hours a month on your computer trying to be not-lonely.. relevant, pithy.. I don't know, but I'm a real progressive, and those of us who are us would never compare Biden with Trumputin. #FireTrumpInNovember #FakePresident  #russianbot
Seriously, are   and  actively campaigning for Biden? üòÇ
So you don‚Äôt care about Bush‚Äôs atrocities?  Do you care that Biden used his Senate committee powers to actively enable Bush‚Äôs atrocities?
Biden basically already beat him to that
biden will lose in a landslide because his old boss got called greasy on tucker‚Äôs show, my sources say this tactic is playing very well with the boater demographic who are very concerned with nancy pelosi‚Äôs ice cream as well
A model that Biden should follow* re: DHS &amp; the Border Patrol, but won't.   *If there's an election, if he wins, if Trump concedes...
We will know before 10pm that Biden has won... It wont be close..
‚Ä¶a Democrat-led House of Representatives could actually elect Joe Biden to the Speaker role, therefore electing him President.   Just sayin‚Äô
Months ago I was furious that the Democratic party had once again chosen Biden over Sanders. But you know what? Now I‚Äôm so ready to vote for Biden. With all the crap that‚Äôs happened this year, we need to unite behind him now to fix this mess.
Well, good thing Biden is the nom and not Bernie or AOC. Unfortunately are already seeing how the authoritative state is ran.
absolutely this. the actual energy for ending the filibuster will come from moderate democrats who want to make deals with joe biden
Some say Lean R. I think it starts as a tossup. But Biden will have to keep it close in VA-5.
Maybe it‚Äôs me but 9% of self identified republicans say Biden.
Tom Steyer and Michael Bloomberg could single handedly pay off all the court debt of Floridians whose voting rights are on the cusp of restoration and thus greatly increase the chances of a Biden Presidency, right? I mean, if they're all-in on defeating Trump...
Just guessing that Biden may not be as harmless as many think he'll be. Certainly going to be a lot of ppl advising him that will call for going big.
Biden has some real guts; viewed one way, he's the first White Man to be POTUS after Obama. I count Trump as the last Neo Con. And NOW its time to account for decades of half-solutions : health/education, etc. Through the lens of social media!! 'OK guys, I know its been bad....'
Or, in the case of Joe Biden, they rarely fire at all.
How would Vice President Pence have felt if Joe Biden had sent the National Guard?
Some erosion among seniors for Trump. But yes, in the end, Trump is likely to carry them, sans Biden landslide.
I wonder what it‚Äôs like to vote for a president that you‚Äôre truly excited about and believe in. As someone who couldn‚Äôt vote until 2014, the only major candidates I‚Äôve ever been able to choose from are Hillary Clinton, Donald Trump and Joe Biden. I feel cheated.
I predict the day after Biden is sworn in.....Indictments against Trump will be unsealed in the SDNY.
You excoriated Biden for suggesting that Trump would do this. Maybe you should apologize?
Note: this was in April.
Adjusted we‚Äôre about 10th worst in the entire world, we should be last place. We‚Äôre only beat mostly by places like Iraq, Iran, Kyrgyzstan, &amp; Guatemala. Completely embarrassing. Trump admin has failed. I definitely will be voting for Biden this year, not getting fooled again.
"Throughout the summer,  has gotten advice on racism from an environmental organization that few people have ever heard of."

So so excited to have   coming on board as an MC senior fellow! Check out his insights in the  #MCmedia
23) If it is this that our initial numbers are beginning to capture, then we'll soon find ways to validate our findings.  The most important of these is to recruit honest Democrats and Left Leaning, Biden Supporting Independents. We need just as many of them as we can find!
21) Where the overwhelming Trump advantage we show may result from that alone, it may have another cause. It may demonstrate that Trump supporters are anxious to show up and sound off, due to passionate support, and Biden supporters may not feel so strongly or sound off so loud.
20) It's sad, obvious, and not very interesting. It's just normal selection bias. I should say a couple of more things about this, though. Our poll itself, unlike the vast majority out there is NOT biased in its intent or method. We WELCOME Biden supporters and seek them!
19) Second, our data suffers from an obvious selection bias. Now, obvious as this is, it may have a couple of different causes. One is boring, the other not quite so much so. Boring is just that our reach is far strong, right now, with Trump supporters than we Biden supporters.
10) If you look at both charts so far, you'll see that the Biden data is exactly the same on each. In addition to showing each data point's number, I've done something else here. You saw the same thing in yesterday's black and white chart. I've drawn two lines with unique slopes.
9) Now let's look at another chart. This is a subset of the exact same data. It focuses exclusively on Biden's probabilities as we call them. I usually do NOT include the number for each data point, but in order to explain the process, decided to do so today.
3) So, what exactly are you looking at? Having crunched up our numbers, we make a percentage based prediction. As of that day, the data we have, and the models we use to convert data into a prediction, we called 68% for Trump and 32% for Biden on our first day.
FL  and PA POLLS. Biden up 50-46% in FL (Mason-Dixon) and Biden up 50-41% in PA (Franklin &amp; Marshall)‚Äù. Pollsters Brad Coker (FL) and Terry Madonna (PA) have deep experience in these states. Credible numbers as of late July.
The only reason I include Haley is that she's a pre-Trump GOP favorite. If there's a swing back right by Independents during a Biden Administration, I'd imagine they'd go to her versus a Cruz or Pompeo. But I could also see that same bloc of voters go to Hawley instead.
My biggest priority for the next four years, whether it's a Biden Admin or another four years of Trump, is healing the divide in our country. The China Challenge is unlike any challenge our country has faced before and we'll need strong national unity to meet it.
Who should Joe Biden pick to be his VP? Take the survey today! --&gt;  via  false
Wow. That was so blatant, you can‚Äôt even call it a dog whistle. This black suburbanite will be voting for Biden.
How did Biden come into this? You over here given praise to Bush.
They‚Äôre gonna roast whomever Biden picks. If anything, I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs her lack of having held elected office...
Truth. "The black lives most at risk are inner-city school children. A Biden presidency won‚Äôt help them." If fact, it will extinguish school choice, and with it, hope.
Biden was willing to go clear and hardcore when it came to conducting mass incarceration, interrogating Anita Hill, and opposing desegregation.  Now that he's talking racial equity, we get this. B O L D
Biden is a Republican. ü§£üò¢ü§¢
Signup for an In-person Phonebanks to help Biden, Warner and Dr. Webb win by making calls with fellow Democrats.
If Biden does nominate Kamala Harris for the vice-presidency, I wonder how that'll sit with the BLM and progressive crowd, given that Harris presided over corrupt crime-lab shenanigans in CA and made her political reputation by incarcerating lots of young Black men.
I‚Äôm not sure I understand what measure of any of those things is set to improve based on a continued Trump administration VS a Biden one.
I'm in favor of immediately. And, it might just happen in March, 2021 if there's a Biden administration and Dem control of Congress to invest the $ to make it viable. It is absolutely the fastest route to squashing this thing.
How very 1952.   Are you guys absolutely sure you're not actively campaigning for Biden?   Because you're very good at it.
At least he was respectful enough to capitalize Obama and Biden.   It honestly surprises me that he gives them that much respect.
Trump is worse than Biden as a man. But you are right. Biden represents the very compromised that gave us Trump and if we want to put an end to Trumps we need to stop electing Biden's. We need to refuse them.  The real crisis isn't Trump. It's the absence of an opposition party.
Thank you. Please don't get mad at me for ragging on Biden!  The world runs better when all of us talk: when we listen and don't run away, slamming doors. üëç
Good point.  I should have said fake Biden.  My apologies.
So Joe Biden's consolidation of the Democratic party is "worrying" for the US Economy. But 150,000 dead and a spike in evictions and homelessness, not so much? Got it.
I've been thinking a lot recently about how Trump and Biden's equating of anarchists - who do a lot of mutual aid organizing - with terrorists parallels the way Black Panthers were called terrorists for their free breakfast program
Biden will run. The switch would be made after he were, hypothetically elected. Bait and switch. Its not bait and switch if he pulls out before November. Then its just switch.
I remain unconvinced that  isn't campaigning for Biden üòÇüòÇüòÇ
12) In offering my recommendations, I'll start with Democrats. First, don't believe anyone, not even me. None of know, and there just isn't the data, the honest data, to draw real conclusions from. However, DO NOT TAKE comfort from Biden's positioning. Don't do it.
11) Here's some data I didn't report in the graphs yet, the Independents in our poll are breaking about 8 to 2 for Trump, and we are finding growing numbers of Biden supporters predicting a Trump win.
10) Imagine the headlines...  Biden Camp's Inability to Mount Serious Threat Sends Democrats Running for the Hills  The Somber Mood in DC has Never Been so Obvious
Opinion | Biden‚Äôs election will end national nightmare 2.0
I'll ignore your lack of vocabulary. Let me use it in a sentence for you, "Trump and his fellow Republicans have sneaked a Trojan horse of a talking point into the 2020 debate."  It is your attempt to call Biden anti-American. That is a trojan horse, fool.
yeah i think it came out after he was already out and obama had picked biden, but wouldn‚Äôt it have been crazy if that scandal came out in an Obama-Edwards or even an Edwards-Obama administration
Ady Barkan, progressive activist with ALS, endorses Biden: 'He is everything Trump is not' - CNNPolitics #Biden2020
I love how Republicans can‚Äôt make up their mind whether Biden is a far left activist socialist or a lifelong democrat do nothing centrist
Trump voters also need his rallies to find out what they want.  Biden voters can just pick up the New York Times.
a vote for biden is a vote for using LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT to crush your skull into the pavement during a violent arrest for having political beliefs the state disapproves of, not FEDERAL LAW ENFORCEMENT putting you in an unmarked van! don't forget to vote!
The main thing going for Trump right now, is that eventually Biden will have to take some positions on the issues of the day.  Progressives in the Democratic Party will make sure he takes at least a few positions that have spelled trouble for Democrats in the past.
Bernie voters will not support Biden. If they do, they are sellouts.
I am voting for Biden even if he chooses a sock puppet as his running mate. We will not survive another 4 years of trump.
Looking forward to a Republican minority trying to backpedal on all of their flouting of the law during the Biden administration.
we‚Äôre already a fascist right wing disgrace now controlled by oligarchs, so Biden &amp; Omar actually sounds pretty nice at this point
I *hate* that I have to vote for Biden. Hate it, hate it, hate it. ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨
The conversation is really about Biden's VP choice.  Warren is the only progressive being vetted, as far as I can tell.  Although, to be fair, I don't know much about a several of the other candidates.  Whoever is chosen will probably be the 2024 democratic nominee.
If Joe Biden gets elected? ‚ò≠ ‚ò≠ ‚ò≠
Oh yeah, I imagine it's going to pick up again even more so when Biden restores the 30% that was cut from their budget under Trump.

If Biden had been President on A12 2017, he maybe wouldn't have said there were "good people on both sides," but I'm pretty sure he would have demonized antifascists and condemned "violence on both sides"
Biden VP predictions  Will pick: Harris Should pick: Duckworth  (No insider info so don‚Äôt ask)
I‚Äôm married to one. He‚Äôs a Republican but not stupid. He didn‚Äôt vote for tRump and he‚Äôs for Biden 2020!
Repeat after me: anyone Biden picks for VP will be great! Imagine the depth he has for his cabinet. I can‚Äôt wait.
Sobering. Putin has 5 months (until oath of Office) to move unchecked. He must have gotten quite arrogant; i.e., stupid.  Biden will have to engage this outside the Republican enforced mindset of feigned ignorance. Looks like that tactic predates Trump - thinking Malcolm Nance.
it depends on whether you think benghazi would resonate more with swing votes, or if it would be just as ineffective as the last 5,000 biden non-scandals
joe biden says there‚Äôs reporters camping his house to see any potential VP contenders come in so i say it‚Äôs time for a US political-thriller type secret meeting in a diner
ME-2 is going to have an interesting partisan dynamic in that Golden will likely overperform Biden, who will run ahead of Gideon. Compare to say, NC, which I can see just getting less Dem as you move up the ballot -- Cooper fairly safe, but Cunningham doing better than Biden.
wow i had forgotten about joe biden
Biden announces plans to boost black and Latino finances
20) Underneath the conflict of this or that party, this or that candidate, there remains America Herself. When you wish to fight for Her, you must be able to establish that it is Her for whom you fight. As a former socialist, I can easily imagine the patriotic case for Biden.
18) Let me speak personally. If there is the real chance that Biden will defeat Trump, then I wish to call for Biden. That I oppose Biden is a huge reason in my motivation. I don't want to live by fantasy. I want to live by truth. The truthful data matters. That's what I seek.
17) What we need are those family members who support Joe Biden to sound off. We are not quite ready to show our data transparently, but ONLY for technical reasons. The still small amount of data we have collected is MASSIVELY for Trump, not Biden.
Most of the posts by   and  are either parody posts or they're campaigning for Biden üòÇ
&gt;&gt;Harris also has the perspective that comes from growing up as a nonwhite woman in this country.&lt;&lt; "Nonwhite"? I guess that makes Biden "nonblack" or nonpersonofcolor.   Kamala Harris‚Äôs lack of ‚Äòremorse‚Äô should make her an even stronger candidate for VP
Clinton won by like 1.5 but i probably would‚Äôve expected biden to have more of a lead than 3 in this environment honeslty
This quote is meant as an _endorsement_ of Joe Biden, by the way.
No one could stop Biden once he won SC.  But making Warren VP could bring a real progressive into the Oval Office.
Choosing Warren would signal that Biden wants real change in the country to more equitable society.
I would love that team.  Warren as VP signals that Biden is interested in real change.
Warren as VP would be a signal that Biden really does want the country to become more equitable.  #Warren
Not a terrible poll for Gardner. Still Leans Dem, but in the (limited) #COSen polling we‚Äôve had, Hickenlooper has run several % behind Biden.
In the event that Biden wins the election, what would your initial ratings for the Wisconsin and Pennsylvania sen‚Ä¶ ‚Äî Probly Leans R for WI &amp; maybe Toss-up for PA (assuming Toomey runs for gov). If Biden wins it could be another ba‚Ä¶
Yea agreed on most accounts.  &gt;Being awol onyl helps Biden  True, but I wonder how long he can manage this in the run-up to election. Doesn't seem sustainable. I'm under the assumption that he'll eventually put his foot in his mouth in a very public setting. I guess we'll see.
Lol  actually makes sense. Dems fumbled and are now stuck with Biden who could literally pick anyone from the Obama admin *cough*  *cough* instead could settle for easily the most vulnerable Veep. #BenghaziAintGoingAway
When Biden becomes President, he can replace the Peace roses with Mostly Peaceful roses.
Kyle doesn't understand or ignores is that Biden is preferred by black people and he won't yield that it's because of policy. In his mind it has to be pandering, indoctrination, or they are too stupid to like Bernie. He is just too chicken shit to say it, so he dances around it.
I have to stop watching the news in front of Nia. She was playing barbies tonight and kens name was joe Biden lol üòÇ smh
between this and running a pres campaign purporting a socialist jew is controlling joe biden from the shadows BS, it seems the GOP needs to clean up the antisemitic trash.
The woods are filled with the professionals discarded by Cult45 - great people who can step in and be up to speed in a hurry. And Biden knows 'em all - or he knows somebody who knows them. Plus everybody who's ever been anywhere near DC is ready to help him work shit out.

This is the only reason you need to vote for Biden. Lives and the economy depend on this election, and Biden has a detailed and intelligent recovery plan that doesn‚Äôt revolve around his ego.
But fewer people say the U.S. is on the right track. Plus, how we feel about the future of our jobs and the coronavirus threat. Explore the mood of the country in 8 charts.
Trump won't release tax returns and then Biden will be blamed for nixing the debates. No, I think you just go on and do them.
Presidential:  ‚ÄúJoe Biden was among those expected to honor Lewis. President Trump... told reporters outside the White House on Monday afternoon that he would not be attending the memorial events.‚Äù
In the primary, Biden carried her district by over 30 points and he‚Äôs probably going to take 80% there in the fall.
you could probably fit in a single room the number of people that plan to vote for biden who care if his VP will be "loyal" to him
biden's apparent emphasis on "loyalty" as a criteria for a potential VP pick is both incredibly stupid and suggests that he fundamentally misunderstands the position that he is in
Fox's Chris Wallace says Biden campaign turned down interview request: 'We'll keep asking'
Here we go again.. votes for Trump because they can‚Äôt immediately get their way? Why don‚Äôt they work with Biden to get him elected &amp; then push their cause? I have never seen such a bite off your nose to spite your face move! Like the GOP will ever help?
If Biden wins &amp; Trump concedes (big ifs), I hope Biden's first move is to banish the word "homeland" from the American political vocabulary. His second move should be to dissolve the DHS.
there‚Äôs generally a lot of picking and choosing what topics to be upset about on both sides of this primary, markey stans won‚Äôt talk about markey‚Äôs record when they criticized joe biden on it and moderates suddenly care about the iraq war and crime bill on people‚Äôs records

There is a big difference between "significant progress" and a workable vaccine. If whatshisname says that there will be a vaccine, I put that in the category of all the other 20,000+ lies he has said.  If Dr. Fauci says it, great! We elect Joe Biden and one problem is solved.
It's like they're campaigning for Biden üòÇ
The GOP brand is so strong that  definitely doesn‚Äôt mention he‚Äôs a Republican in his new ad while slyly piggy-backing on the Biden ‚Äúbuild back better‚Äù campaign slogan.

this tweet is mainly because i‚Äôve been seeing a ton of ‚Äúmarkey was a segregationist‚Äù takes from the people who weren‚Äôt worried about joe biden at all, but this is also for the stans who literally won‚Äôt vote for joe biden over policies markey supported
some of y‚Äôall aren‚Äôt worried about ed markey‚Äôs record when you were obsessed with joe biden‚Äôs record on the same things but then y‚Äôall who all of the sudden care about ed markey‚Äôs record weren‚Äôt concerned about joe biden at all, either care about both or neither

The Staff Member Acting as Director, Wolf, is instigating the violence with his Cosplay Mercenaries.   Biden, like the Trojans, will win.
I decided on her as my preferred VP choice a few weeks ago. I've been following her for years now and have been very impressed. Fingers crossed she is Biden's VP choice.
Seconded. Tho, at this point, the only convincing I've heard about Biden that tickles me is: he'll tweet less, which isn't a good argument for a president

NORTH CAROLINA‚ÄîNew NBC-Marist Poll has Biden up 51-44%. This +7 for Biden compares to +4 in March. NC is close to a must-win for Trump who carried it handily in 2016. So a new week begins as the old one ended‚Äîgood polling news for Biden.
i had to learn to watch myself and turn it off this spring when the Biden people became unbearable. it only makes me more angry and uncomfortable than i already am. now i just avoid them. you can lead a horse to college, but you can't make them think üê¥üí≠‚ùì

It's unpersuasive. But it IS true that FDR did much of what he did because he was forced.  Given our situation, skeptical though I am, I admit that the only hope is to try to force Biden to the left, even though that's a little like trying to teach a geoduck to sing opera.
Wait is Joe Biden a wildly leftist Marxist activist or a do nothing corporate deep state centrist dem? Can you guys make your mind up so I can repeat it on the internet?!?
July 25, 1988: Michael Dukakis leads George H.W. Bush by 17 points.   100 days to go, 17 points.  Please keep all tanks away from Joe Biden.

Build-Back-Better: BIDEN 2020!
I wish he would defund the police given everything that is happening, it's sort of proving the whole point. I wish the we Democrats would take a position for it instead of not saying anything. This is a sort of trap that Trump set to make people defend Biden &amp; say no he won't.

Biden is an idiot, if America votes him in, the country will go down the drain.
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
And yet both Quinnipiac and CNN had Biden at 51% in FL. It was the Trump number that varied. As for groups, all are important, but in '16 Trump won 57% of whites, who are still ~70% of electorate. If Trump's % of whites is closer to 50% than 60%, he's likely lost.
