About the only part of that reply that‚Äôs accurate is that Biden has a son.  Have to remember the source though is someone who hoped that the Mayor of Portland choked on tear gas so you know, taken with a grain of salt.
It did. Polls were only off around two points nationally in 2016. State polls in the Midwest were the issue but even then it was only like a 70k vote swing across three states. Trump is in trouble. Biden is far more popular than Hillary. People hate Hillary. I hate Hillary.
Polling is trash for Trumpito. Joe Biden gonna be president but then Tom Cotton and Tucker Carlson will win in 2024 when they beat Kamala Harris and Pete in a landslide. I‚Äôll probably be put in an internment camp after being labeled a terrorist by the Cotton administration.
I can‚Äôt wait to vote for Biden in November so he and other Democrats can work hard to prevent any policy that I agree with from becoming a reality.

Heard a lot of chatter yesterday that Politico's reporting on Harris was misplaced, but Biden strikes me as the kind of guy who really cares about loyalty in his VP, which is why I wouldn't dismiss Rice quite yet.

Is it because the silent majority no longer want to sit back so Trump with his attitude and actions are the voice they‚Äôve wanted for so long but we‚Äôre too civilized to express? Question now is, if Biden should win will the Right ever sit back again..being bullied,pushed around?

so you saying its NOT a hoax? you voting for Biden then? #Biden2020
Your followers have to blindly follow you to be a cult. We aren‚Äôt voting for Biden just because Bernie said so. Y‚Äôall are voting for whoever is the Democrat because they told you so.
And Biden wrote it all down and continues to hold those communities down... neither are your friend
"Trump is bad."  "Oh yeah?  What's Biden stand for?"  "Um...I don't know.  But did you hear, Trump is awful."  That's the campaign.  I don't think Biden mentioned a single primary idea, except saying "No" to all of Bernie's.  I'm in FB jail, for mentioning the MIC drain on HC4All
I hate that she supports Biden, but Mz  has something against 2A so I understand that part .... Let's hope she finds  and  and realizes we have better choices than the old white guys running #VoteGold
Continue making America "Grate."  Seriously, between Biden and Trump all you've got is Trump is more racist.  Everything else is so close to being the same it's ridiculous.  We've got virtual one-party rule.
Not remotely thrilled about Biden but he's light years better than Trump
Can people change? After spending decades in Washington and not repairing, but enacting worse legislation/laws?!  #VoteGold   Joe Biden worried in 1977 that certain de-segregation policies would cause his children to grow up 'in a racial jungle'
Biden's campaign is confident that the former vice president can emerge victorious if the contest is a referendum on whether the current commander in chief has succeeded during his four years in office.  via
damn... call it what it is ....when you say 'a jail for children' it sounds so much worse than a juvenile detention center .... Biden is going to be horrible for our nation. Mothers teach your children well, get them active in local politics
The polls with Biden leading big are wrong, again! In the last couple of days Rasmussen has released some polls from I think 8 battleground states where Trump is leading! It could be close and anything that is not overwhelming will be challenged in court!
Whew.... so glad you posted on here ..... I get tired of seeing TC pushing Biden, knowing how awful his policies will be.....
It's  never been about Floyd! BLM is a Marxist movement set up to manipulate the emotions of people who believe their lies and to funnel their donations to the democratic socialist party to try to help biden and try to remove President Trump. Plain and simple!
I have a joke about Joe Biden but it's you know the thing.

Everyone can see Joe Biden was reading a transcript about what someone said at a hearing. Biden didn't say the N-word intentionally nor directly. Joe Biden is NOT a racist. This is slander! Love you Joe Biden!
A better plan is to allow people to receive real training for real jobs that qualify them for a mortgage on their own home or rent wherever they want to live.  Section 8 housing has become a place where you either 'escape from' or 'succumb to'.
Did you pay attention to the 2016 election? That was hands down worse. Hillary makes lackluster Biden look good.
Biden couldn‚Äôt even walk to the mound much less hum one in there on the inside corner
Biden only wants the status quo.
I agree, if you want Bernie's voters then start talking about passing some of the policies for which he advocated.  Don't blame people for not voting for Biden when he offers nothing. "Trump's bad," is not a good campaign.
Definitely voting... And Biden‚Äôs going down!
I'm a Republican in Alabama. I believe you are ignoring history. He was a traitor and fought against this great country. Also, I want to tell that I'm voting for Biden. What Trump and the people that follow his cult are doing is destroying the GOP.
"Hey Yoho, I'm worried you'll scrape your knuckles on the ground the way you're dragging them along beside you," might have been on reply.  AOC 2024---whether Biden wins, or not!
and the Obama/Biden swine flu of 2009 ‚Äúprimarily affected children and young and middle-aged adults‚Äù
Is there a scenario where, with the help of the lying news media they could fake the election results and install Joe Biden as president whether or not he actually won? Pelosi made some interesting comments recently that may reveal  what they have planned for the election.
Bill, please look beyond Trump. IF a weak Biden, combined w/the increasingly hard-left Dems, control POTUS, House, and Senate, the damage to all you've worked for could be incalculable. Please reconsider. Thanks, my friend.
In a sick way, I almost want to see Biden beat Trump just so we can instantly see the robots and democratic mouthpiece media completely forget about their manufactured doomsday, and never again utter a single syllable about Covid-19.  On second thought, lets keep #MAGA üá∫üá∏ üèÜ üöÄ

Shameful. Drive on big guy! These are the kinds of people who will vote for Biden. üòéüá∫üá∏
Biden won't even give us M4A. Do you really think he would consider UBI?! We have to eat and pay bills.
Biden has no vision, plans, or character!  Biden needs to stay in his basement!
Biden and the Democrats Can't Win by Insulting Americans    Not so sure it's true Biden can't win.  We'll see if cancel culture has succeeded in bullying and deceiving enough Americans.  Sad to say that intimidation sometimes works.
I‚Äôm sure that Biden thinks that Jim Crow is an actual person and he feels flattered!!ü§£ü§£ü§£
Hopefully we all will agree to support Biden and his VP candidate! But I fear a 2016 Bernie Bros reaction should one or more agendas not be realized! So hoping and praying that I am wrong in this, but then past is prologue...
Just guessing that the Death Star Captain Parscales is back in charge since he's the only one in the GOP who knows how to turn on a computer! No! Wait..Darth Vader is still around rummaging thru FOX's garbage bin looking for some garbage on Biden to eat!
Clearly I am indeed blind to all the communism around me, that‚Äôs why I asked for an example, but you gave me nothing. Being so prevelant that shouldn‚Äôt be too hard to do. Also, Biden is not POTUS, Trump is, and all this death &amp; destruction is on his watch, not Biden‚Äôs.

Interesting. It's not that he's above it. And not if he could use someone else's money to do it and take the credit. I would take the money and vote for Biden anyway. How would he know?
Person, woman, vote, blue, Biden
You can be a horrible president and not be fascist. Biden being president is NOT going to make the US better. It does NOT fix any of our problems. It just makes people feel more safe, mainly privileged people who haven‚Äôt even been affected by Trump‚Äôs presidency.
People aren‚Äôt enthusiastic because he sucks. No one is pushing for Biden, they‚Äôre pushing his VP and Cabinet, which so far have been shit.
Again, why would Biden listen?! He‚Äôs already gained power, so why should he listen?‚Äô
Fox News presidential polls:  Michigan Biden 49%, Trump 40%  Pennsylvania Biden 50%, Trump 39%  Minnesota Biden 51%, Trump 38%
The nerve !!! I think that's how many Biden had on his last YouTube conference.
But you can criticize Biden for his stupid shit and for his record. You can demand he move more to the left  But you can‚Äôt. If he demand he change, then it‚Äôs ‚Äúoh its him vs Trump, so pick which one‚Äù as if Biden can‚Äôt change.  Anytime he says something stupid, it‚Äôs laughed off
Majority is there   Biden is exactly like Hillary. He has a horrible record, says stupid shit, and no one can ever say anything about it without being accused of being a Trump supporter
I‚Äôm a suburban housewife and I read this article. I totally agree with Joe Biden  vote blueüíôüíôüíôüíô
There is about 35% of our population that are mentally terminal, despite being the minority, they are extremely loud. Have faith that we WILL vote in overwhelming numbers for Joe Biden on November 3. It will return these  bigots back under the rocks from which they came.

Russia Ukraine Impeachment Riots Biden
This is what America gets for electing Biden President four years ago
The fact that Joe Biden said trump is the first racist President like 12 Presidents didn‚Äôt own slaves, like Nixon didn‚Äôt launch the war on drugs, and like Ronald Regan didn‚Äôt call black women welfare queens is laughable.
Biden charged in Ukraine?
supports killing the unborn and he calls himself "devoutly religious". Pleeaassee...how absurd. And your support of immorality.  Need to read Romans 1:18-27.  How would you describe Joe Biden's worldview?
This is different, though. Polls weren‚Äôt really that far off honestly. Hillary lead nationally by 3-4 points nationally around this time in 2016 IIRC. Look at statewide, though. Biden literally needs to do nothing and he will win tbh, but we still have a ways to go I guess.
Has he heard of Hunter Biden?ü§î
Biden ratcheting up on racism allegations because Biden doesn't have any positive campaign material on his own. This is the tactic used when someone can't effectively argue in a debate. Topic diversions. Erroneous generalizations. Works on some people.
Biden was one of the ones that originally sent them to China.
Biden calls Trump the first racist to win the presidency. Probably not but he is certainly the worst.
So if Biden gets elected and is awful I can say the same thing?
Obama and Biden release video criticizing Trump's pandemic response. These guys are so good!
Joe Biden laid out a plan on how to handle the pandemic in January. January 2020.   Trump is just now, in late July 2020, saying they‚Äôre working on a plan.   140k American deaths later.   Let that sink in.
I am!!! I'm voting for Joe Biden if I have to crawl naked over a mile of broken glass and wear a Hazmat Suit on November 3.
Look, we need to have a real talk:  I get that y'all need to document and record all of this, but to do so without a fact check attached is just aiding and abetting at this point.  I literally watched Biden do a meeting IN A MASK MONTHS AGO.  This is ridiculously irresponsible
‚ò™Ô∏è is not a religion and Biden has lost his marbles!
I'm backing Biden, but get your facts right man. Trump isn't the first racist President. He's just the most, overt, cavalier and endorsing of racism President that we've ever had.  We've never had a President that goes out of his way to make race relations worse. We do now.If it were possible to change the date of the federal election,  I say sooner not later.  The sooner we get Trump out of office,  the better for the country.  Voting Biden on November 3rd.  The Blue Wave is coming.
Well we're definitely not safe in Trumpland.  I'm ready for a REAL PRESIDENT.  Voting Biden on November 3rd.  I just wish we could vote earlier in Alabama. Also will be voting Senator Doug Jones.  He's Great for Alabama.
I still won‚Äôt have health insurance under Biden and that is killing me because I can afford treatment that I need for my chronic illness. Is slowly dying under a Democrat support you make me feel better?
I just did a MAJOR interview with Trump 2020 Campaign Press Secretary,   We discussed everything from his new role, focus in the last 100 Days, Biden‚Äôs VP pick, the future of campaign rallies, and whether or not the election will be postponed.  Stay tuned ü§´
I dont get how bidens mind is ever brought up. Do you hear trump speak? He spent his last news conference staring at the podium to read his notes. Trump is obviously more senile than biden and in worse health.
Absolutely. Trying to tie him in it when there's no evidence. All because they got their feelings hurt that their sicko HRC didn't win 4 years ago. And they'll get their feelings hurt again when creepy Joe Biden doesn't win.
That‚Äôs a lie. It‚Äôs a lie. You are lying about Joe Biden. You will never make your lies stick, Ronna. The amusing part of this is that as much as you and the progressive wing of the Demo party would love this lie to be fact, it‚Äôs simply not. You cannot turn Biden into Bernie.
I‚Äôm astounded that ANYONE is seriously considering a vote for Biden. Besides being a pervert and a criminal, he clearly has dementia.
Won‚Äôt get this if Trump or Biden win this year
Lol I don't care about Biden. That's the best you've got?
You owe Joe Biden an apology.  This falls short of admitting how wrong you were.  Apologize.  You will feel better afterwards.
remember when you said that Biden's accusation that Trump would try to delay the election was  "Over the line" and Biden "should know better"?
I think #Biden &amp; #Pelosi both want #Trump‚Äôs head on a pike. And he knows it, too. So don‚Äôt look for him to resign. ‚ÄúPeaceful Transition of Power‚Äù is the only card he has left. It‚Äôs too late to play it. But he‚Äôs desperate and has no other options. #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica2020
If this doesn‚Äôt show how much of a performative stunt Biden picking a woman as his VP is. Kamala is an overall better PRESIDENTIAL candidate than him and that scares the shit out of him.
Joe Biden‚Äôs VP
Biden &amp; Pelosi area neck and neck for #2&amp;3!
So Biden races to catch the curve, but when he caught up to it forgot what he was there to do.
If i remember correctly,  biden slide into the abyss , began when his eye filled up with blood during a democratic debate???? Anyone remember?
I've never thought I'd say this, but the next 95 days College Football is a Risk, not a health risk, but a Biden Campaign risk. Anything that brings Joy and hope to American people is censored or postponed until further notice.
Vote for Joe Biden because ‚Äî at the very least ‚Äî he won‚Äôt just give Russia a pass when they ... put a bounty on the heads of our soldiers abroad.
I'll really believe it if Joe Biden gets all 538 electoral votes. But as long as he has his supporters, he's liked by some people.
Joe Biden has a better chance of completing a full sentence than OHSAA does making a decision on the fall sports season.
Lmaooo she literally called biden a racist and then would be his Vp lol

this is one of the most pathetically stupid tweets I've EVER read. Literally out of tens of thousands, this one cannot be topped for stupidity. Voting for an independent 3rd party instead of Biden helps Trump get re-elected - which would end our freedoms and nation as we know it.
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN
but republicans argue that third party votes will be absorbed by biden. so maybe third party votes are just what they are called...votes for a third party
IDIOT!  They want to work and keep their jobs and health insurance.  It's not their fault that Trump's screwed everything up with the Trump virus. Everyone won't forget when we vote Biden  on November 3rd.
Because Biden will be 78 when he takes office, he is unlikely to run for a 2nd term. His choice for VP bill have a huge advantage in 2024 if the Biden administration is successful. I want Kamala for that reason. Look for Doug Jones or Preet B  to be the attorney general

I think if you‚Äôre in a functional state it‚Äôs easy to be like ‚Äúwell Joe Biden isn‚Äôt great‚Äù and sure, I agree with that. But in a state that‚Äôs not very functional, there are federal programs that we need to work.
If the AL legislature (not a great group most of the time!) has to make up for lapses in the federal government, we are very fucked. If Joe Biden just puts people in positions they know how to do, we are doing better.
Joe Biden is far from my first choice. However, Trump has either failed to fill positions or filled them with the worst people possible. At this point, people who know how to do their jobs would be a massive improvement.
Um. Let's just say that I misread Kanye's tweet, turns out it's not about "beating Biden off."
Did Trump ask Putin about murdering our soldiers or interfering in our elections.  Or was this just a  I Love You and miss you call. Did Putin let Trump kiss his butt some more. Defeat Trump in November.  Voting Biden, he won't be kissing Putin butt.

False. He has pledged to support the agenda of a President Biden.  This is not about Trump nor even a refresh of the Republican Party anymore.
Yes, Biden/Rice would be more pathetic.
Biden is 78. While I like him as a candidate there is a good possibility he may not finish his term. He needs a VP that would be highly capable of running the country. That person is Harris.
Do you &amp; your followers realize that all House committee chairpersons are almost all from the west coast or the N.Y. area?If the Democrats win,the Senate Chairs, Joe Biden,and Kamala Harris will be, too. That means that most of the country will have no leadership at all in gov‚Äôt.
Of course Biden has never wanted to be president
How many times did Biden run for president? Is he too ambitious?
Good point and so true. Biden is funny  QB ing his own poor Obama-Biden Admin 4 years after it‚Äôs over and he still can‚Äôt get it right.

Not sure how it is a juvenile question. I agree with you that they aren't the same, but that's just a weird statement. Here, I will help you. Biden won't tear gas a peaceful protest for a photo op. Not hard to give a reason.

I love the Bernie is backing Biden crowd. I didn't write in Bernie because I thought he would win that way. I voted for him because I understand Alabama enough to know they loved Trump. He won 62-38 against all other options. He will win my state at least 58-42 this time.
Then, it wouldn't be close anywhere except maybe swing states...oh, wait. I tell you what if I'm not feeling too idealistic this time, I will vote Biden since my vote doesn'tmean anything. Trump will still win my state at least 58-42. Stay tuned for me being right.

You have got to be kidding!!!  Are there no millionaires in the Democratic Party, you are laughable. Pelosi, Schumer, Biden and many other crooked liers have lived off of the taxpayers for years and have become millionaires.
This is not true. The Dems are not stopping the Terrorist in the streets, is that what you want for the United States? This is what will happen if Biden is elected. They spied on Trump and will turn this country into a socialist country!!!
You are a very sick Mom. You better do some researching before you vote for Biden!!!
The Joe Biden rescue method. Between someone blowing the breath of life into him and the golden hairs on his legs, there is proof of La La Land.
There will be no miracle in Alabama. I hate to tell you. However, what's a more likely miracle? Biden. So, I may go ahead and vote for him. Depends how idealistic I am that day.
Of course I do. If I make a bad decision and the write ins and third party votes would have put Biden over in Alabama. Then, you'd have me over a barrel.
Every despicable thing he does emboldens his voters here. It is a bit disgusting. I will keep an eye on polls. If they get close to the margin of error, I will be pragmatic and vote for Biden. Just unlikely.
What part of the Russian Collusion was a Liberal set up do you not Understand. It‚Äôs obvious you people like the way our country is going. If Biden is elected it will only get worse and when you Pansies start Crying I‚Äôm going to laugh my ASS off and say I Told you So

Gotcha.  This isn‚Äôt about Trump or Biden.  Fauci is the issue.  He hasn‚Äôt done a damn thing in the last 5 months except contradict himself.
I don‚Äôt think Biden is a racist. He is an opportunist. Says he believes whatever he thinks will get him elected. I don‚Äôt think he has any core beliefs. Also, I don‚Äôt think he is very smart - has no idea what policies make us safe and prosperous.
Douglas Adams would write the perfect satire to win me over to voting for Biden‚Ä¶ but he‚Äôd never get around to submitting it until after the election.
Please correct me if I‚Äôm wrong.  But Biden does NOT want to defund police.  He wants to add to that budget.  Open for correction.

Just watch. All bets are off if Trump comes back to win, but if it's president-elect Biden, the catch phrase of November will be "we can't afford to live in fear anymore".
But you know what the really stupid part is?  The instant Biden gets declared the winner in November all this magically just gets better. You just watch.

This is the MOST ridiculous statement I have ever heard from Biden.Trump has tried to help all CITIZENS of America to be safe &amp; prosperous. He wants us all to be educated &amp; have jobs. Democrats want children dumb &amp; adults dependent on government. How could anyone vote for him?
Biden doesn't think Woodrow Wilson re-segregating the federal government &amp; showing the pro-KKK film Birth of a Nation at the WH was racist, doesn't think FDR throwing Japanese-Americans in internment camps was racist, but Trump saying "China virus" makes him the only racist POTUS

I never liked Biden, but this seems a bit like abuse to me.

Some progressives have no intention of voting for Biden. Joe needs to seek a VP candidate that levels with his ideas, can turn out BIPOC, generate enthusiasm, and has worked hard for him this whole MFING time. We know who that person is and she doesn‚Äôt need an introduction.
Oh hell naw! We don‚Äôt need someone far-left on that ticket influencing Biden on issues that he doesn‚Äôt believe in that can potentially turn off moderates and independents (who voted for Trump.) Progressives will hijack the mess out of his campaign to make it about them. Nuh uh.
Duckworth has small name recognition that doesn‚Äôt go beyond the base. She served in the military but her experience doesn‚Äôt strengthen a Biden ticket. No disrespect to her at all. This isn‚Äôt 2004 America. I‚Äôd rather for her voice to be in the House.
The headline itself calling Biden‚Äôs team ‚Äúfolks‚Äù is amateurish and lacks professionalism in reporting. I think this is an opinion writer who is a Bro and is making up shit takes to erase Kamala. We can‚Äôt forget the erasure the media did to her last year.
Don‚Äôt forget Biden.
Please have your brother do a video of people from minorities who know him well and support him. Let them tell his story. I see no evidence of Biden‚Äôs personal insult being true. The only answer is from the people who are his people. We the people...‚ù§Ô∏è
These imbeciles are targeting her because she is the strongest candidate to be picked by Biden. So what we (KHive) and allies need to do at this time is start fighting like hell for Kamala and dispose any smears more than ever before.
Well... how could Biden be president sniveling all the time and sniffing hair isn't exactly social distancing either.
Joe Biden is a divisive and racist candidate. He knows Trump isn‚Äôt racist. To bring race into this campaign at this time in history is racist.
Joe Biden isn't competent enough to operate a magic 8 ball.
Is that for Joe's sake or from anti-Trump animus? Not voting for Biden in my deeply red state, though I can see why you would want to vote for him in Ohio. We have to get out of this "yeah, my guys not great, but the other guy's worse" mentality. It means we always lose.
Lucky for that little girl that Joe Biden isn't there.
Biden leads. Trump follows. #Joe2020
Well the good thing is you understand that Joe Biden is a pedophile. So you‚Äôve got intelligence and understanding. That‚Äôs awesome üí™  keep your head up. Life is tough but you have the power to make anything out of it.
Take as much time as you need. Answer I'm looking for: "&lt;Crisis facing tens/hundreds of millions of US people&gt; can be solved by &lt;specific policy proposed by Biden &amp; team&gt;, and implemented by &lt;specific strategy&gt;."
Those Berners must be having amnesia about Latinos rejecting his ass by 3 to 1 with those comments he made about praising  Fidel Castro. Biden swept every county in that state. üòÇüòÇüòÇ In a GE, they would vote for that orange slimeball again before Sanders.
I'll ask you the same question that I ask everyone who tries to get me to vote for Biden is asked? Name one policy that Joe Biden and his administration will fight tooth and nail for, that is the size and magnitude of the crisis it is trying to solve?
You might be right Biden gets to stay in the basement until after the Democratic teleconvention.
New polls show Biden ahead in some key battleground states.  Soooo in 2016, I recall he was behind and was destined to lose the election, but that changed election night?  Was it the #SilentMajority?  I predict another surprise, Nov 3!
Be nice to see the true figures of Dems after the laundered money came to them. Biden's millions from Ukraine and the 1.5 billion from China. That is something that would be important to know.
This was a very cute interview with Senator Kamala Harris. She addressed the key points in her agenda. I liked that one segment where Brian Tyler Cohen said ‚ÄúIn a Biden-Harris Administration.‚Äù   Watch. üíõüíõüêùüíõüíõ
Clearly, you‚Äôre used to watching a Biden ‚Äúspeech‚Äù. Understandable.
I, too, live in the Suburbs and look forward to Biden's America. #TrumpsAmerikkka sucks!
How different would these numbers be if it was Pence vs Biden?
I must have missed that answer.  I'm assuming you would have said that Joe Biden's racist statements are cool with you. Oh, and I'm not whining and throwing a tantrum.  I'm sitting in my office trying not to laugh as I read through your TL.
Yeah, I don't know what I'm going to do election time yet.  I know it won't be Trump, but between his alleged assault cases and how poorly he handled that, his rewriting of history, and his poor voting record, I don't know if voting for Biden is ethical either.

Well, since you called me an idiot and dumb and other less than appealing adjectives, when I all I did was ask you a question about equal criticism of Biden, I figured it was time to get on your level. Keep thinking you have the higher moral ground here.
Hopefully Biden will be the last racist VP!
Obviously Biden hasn't heard the Nixon tapes.  Not that he was by any means the worst...  His own party ushered in Woodrow Wilson and Andrew Jackson.  He should drop out of the race and read a book.
And yet Joe Biden happened
Only the ones that say:  Obama Biden  Yep, they are still out there... Bumper sticker too...
I‚Äôm really not excited about Joe Biden man.

Yes. Alternating between suggesting that Biden is a corrupt socialist despot-to-be and a dementia patient.
Biden has been a politician for how many years? But all the United States problems are because of Trump now? It‚Äôs ridiculous. He was in a lose-lose with the Coronavirus. And please tell me you think Biden is of the right mind to be president? Can the Democrats not find better?

Biden will be destroyed and deep inside you know. You know the old man can‚Äôt even complete a paragraphed without screwing up. He has to have that teleprompter to read off of. I once saw Michael Dukakis 16 point lead evaporate within three weeks. Watch it happen .
And the best u can come up with is babbling old deminted Joe Biden. The debates will be a massacre.
You just wait for the debates and Biden is going to fall to pieces. He doesn‚Äôt have it all up there anymore. All those years of drinking has caught up to him. Nobody can bail him out of the debates. No VP, no media,  nobody can save him in the debates. He‚Äôs a babbling old fool.

I agree! He called Trump a racist. People need to go back &amp;read what Biden has said about black people. He said social workers need to go to black peoples house &amp; teach them how to raise their children. That was HORRIBLE for Biden to say. Look at the Washington Post article.

I like how you can look back on interviews with Trump and his positions and views haven‚Äôt changed.  He wants America to do better and stop being taken advantage of.  You look back at Biden and his time in office and especially the senate and he is clearly racist but he‚Äôs changed
I‚Äôll answer that for you:  JFK (D), Hoover (D)  and yes your President, President Trump (R). So yeah he has NO financial motive as president.  Unlike Obama, Biden, Pelosi, Schiff (well all Democrats so I‚Äôll save some reading for you).

Trump talked about litigation over the election. Said it could take "years" to know the outcome of this election. He is setting us up for a claim that the election is not legitimate. The S Ct may pick the president (like Bush v. Gore) unless Biden's win is overwhelming.
this is a GREAT idea. we get pelosi for sure vs maybe biden. let‚Äôs make it happen

Biden is 78. While I like him as a candidate there is a good possibility he may not finish his term. He needs a VP that would be highly capable of running the country. That person is Harris.

Of course Biden has never wanted to be president
The fuck are you talking about, dude? Republicans will still have the judiciary and most likely the senate. Christ, you‚Äôre think. In no world is Biden worse than Trump.
We'll first others vetting her know better than me but based on the way she comported herself in the primaries (health care positions, Biden attack) showed me that.
It's not about ambition it's about loyalty. Ryan was loyal to Romney. Biden was loyal to Obama. Edwards and Palin put themselves and their ambitions above their ticket-mate. I think Harris wouldn't be as bad as Edwards or Palin but less loyal than Biden or Ryan.
I think it's more about loyalty and subverting one's own ambition below supporting Biden's agenda. I would have said the same thing about John Edwards.

Trump policies are helping Texas economy recover, while Biden would crush energy jobs
Good point and so true. Biden is funny  QB ing his own poor Obama-Biden Admin 4 years after it‚Äôs over and he still can‚Äôt get it right.
Biden: "we're moving the low income housing out of the suburbs so that we can encourage a spirit of entrepreneurship this nation was built upon!!!!"  Trump: "man don't you hate those poor minorities?! They'll be out of your suburb before long!"
Trump is a serial abuser of women which includes his daughter and has actually had charges filed against him in federal court for rape of a minor.  No such charges remotely filed against Biden. This is a lie and you are a liar.  Repeating this untrue story is libel and slander.
Like, I get it, but the way America's 2 party system works (#abolishtheelectoralcollege), we cant vote 3rd party &amp; change anything. We have to get a Dem in who will actually change something (ik for an absolute fact that it won't be Biden but that's all we got rn üò©)
If you live in a typical American suburb or small town, it's very likely that your area is in Biden's crosshairs. Your property taxes will have to be raised in order to build high-rise public housing, in defiance of local zoning laws, because your community is "too affluent."
Biden and Coach O probably have more in common than we‚Äôd like to admit.
Biden is such a creep and it‚Äôs not even intellegent.
Call it what it is! You Dems just can‚Äôt take the TRUTH! It came from China and was most likely intentional. Biden loves China though.

The past 4 years have been tough, so you, we, all have the right to be depressed.   Biden's VP pick drama is something happy to look forward to. For me kinda like the trailers for Star Wars Episode 7.
Biden says Trump 'behind the curve' on pandemic, denounces violent protesters

Will  commit to the citizens of the AL 5th Cong'l district that, if Trump loses the election, Brooks will not support any effort by Trump to obstruct the legally mandated transition of the office of the Presidency to Biden?  #alpolitics #al05
Biden says Trump 'behind the curve' on pandemic, denounces violent protesters
Literally can‚Äôt imagine the privilege it takes to refuse to vote for Biden against tr-mp ‚Äî I can‚Äôt imagine not feeling the urgency to do everything possible to ensure he‚Äôs voted out of office.
Biden ‚Äúwarming‚Äù up for his VP pick!
The democrats have completely embarrassed themselves today with the lack of respect of our AG.  The lies and false narratives that they let flow from their mouths was absolutely ridiculous. I don‚Äôt care if you are democrat or republican, for or against Trump, for or against Biden
Biden's notes: ‚ÄòDo not hold grudges‚Äô against Kamala Harris
Biden vows to fight racial inequalities with economic agenda
I think he has a good shot still. People in States that could possibly go Biden need to get out and do it. My state won't, but it is what it is.
I'm not certain he knows that he's Joe Biden anymore.
The first thing Biden should do is accept Barr's resignation.
It‚Äôs not racist. Claiming it is says a lot about you. Biden is still free to choose whomever he wants. Politically speaking, choosing someone more liberal is good politics as many progressives see him as too moderate. He could do a lot worse than picking a woman of color.
Plus who cares ....could be anyone and I‚Äôll still be voting for Biden...and I mean literally...anyone!
So all of you are saying Biden is better?? Really?? He is a career people pleaser who would do absolutely anything to get elected. If you get focused on politicians you will always be disappointed. Only choice it to pick the liar you can tolerate. #WhyIDontLikeTrump
And I sure all Republicans feel the same about Biden. All politicians are liars including all the prior presidents. Boils down to which you can put up with.
Its Biden vs Trump.  You should say you‚Äôre voting for the person not named Trump. I feel like I‚Äôm living in the stupidest simulation üôÑ
My first choice is Warren in great part b/c the chance is great that Biden doesn‚Äôt make it all four years but at this time in our nation the choice should be a black woman. I would be happy w/ Harris or Demmings especially. I‚Äôm voting Biden regardless but turnout is key in Nov.
Hillary Clinton: I don't need your votes Joe Biden: I don't need your votes Screaming in unison: DAMN U SANDERS!
They could but they won‚Äôt.
A 50-state strategy *is* something the democrats can utilize to shift GOP control all across the country‚Äîespecially if Biden defeats the criminal-in-chief by historic proportions.
THIS IS THE CONTENT I‚ÄôM HERE FOR. Look, even Alabama is a place that Biden should one day consider pumping resources into. If he‚Äôs elected, he should help build up the dem infrastructure in states like it. People assume AL will always be red, but we have no real party apparatus.
I mean, we‚Äôre really going to sit here &amp; pretend that progressives like Rice in part b/c she‚Äôs a Black woman? I‚Äôm sorry, but the evidence is to the contrary. If not Bernie, most progressives want Warren, &amp; there‚Äôs not a hint of color in either  This is BS.
Everywhere Trump has been awful (and there has been so much "awful"), Biden offers nothing better. In the relative handful of policy areas this administration has done ok, the Left plans to spin it all back and then some. I can't back Trump, but I can sure back not-Joe.
Biden just answered a question about dealing with rioters. He said HE would use local law enforcement to quell riots. Would he have that authority when Trump did not?
The Press claps as Biden leaves. ü§£ü§£ü§£
This whole fucking day has been a BIDEN RALLY. ü§¨
You really think it stops if Biden is elected? Laughable get ready to kiss your hard work good bye
Biden talks about Trump holding a bible upside down and Bidens on priest won't let him have communion. Hmmm.
Seriously FOX is now showing Biden?

Biden will most likely be dead by 2024, he does not look good. Trump is so bad to me I'm voting for an empty suit who I know is a puppet of the Dem establishment.
Oh we are very aware of the reality of the Trump presidency. Believe me. I'm just waiting for the dangerous headache that's gonna happen when Trump blames losing to Biden on mail in voting and refuses to abdicate power.
What does the document promise with respect to Social Security and retirement, and does it differ from the original Biden promises on the campaign website?  #retirement

Keep on pushing Biden Juan. What an insult to intelligent people of the US.
Great read.  Fair assessment.
Dude, it sounds like you mean well. But guess what happens after Biden? The next Repuke will be "more dangerous than Trump" Once you give in to extortionists they don't let go. You know this. The Dems will keep us in slavery &amp; fear, "we can't do this or that JC Repukes..."
Even if Sanders had taken all of Warren‚Äôs votes, he still would have lost to Biden. But that‚Äôs beside the point.
You‚Äôre right. Joe Biden doesn‚Äôt read fiction written by white privileged trumps. Maybe you should get the audio version for the President. Charity starts at home.

I have no idea who the respondents were to that poll. Biden supporters are as enthusiastic about getting Trump out as Trump's supporters are about re-electing Trump. It's going to be a matter of which Party can bring their voters out....
This is where you deploy someone like Bloomberg to light some money on fire in PAC ads. Let Biden keep dry powder for other states. But he won‚Äôt.
I think she's bitter because she's no longer relevant. She probably reached out to Biden's people for a job and was told she's a day late and several dollars short.  Po thang!
I‚Äôm Catholic and I‚Äôm voting for Joe Biden, I also voted for John Kerry.

The bar has been set everyone, this is the best Biden meme of the week so far
That‚Äôs the way it‚Äôs supposed to be, unless there was an independent candidate I guess. But certainly too late for that now. Biden will not make it.
Babs he was listening to dumb Fauci, the WHO puppet.  Don't you get it?  Even Fauci admitted he was not truthful in March.  Oh and did you forget Pelosi in Chinatown saying it was safe to go out during the first days of March?  You must have what Biden has mentally.
Who will Biden pick for VP?  #pod
üòÇüòÇüòÇü§£ Trump already started and made progress.  Just like Biden to steal someone else's platform as his own, riding with Bidin means riding Trump's coattails.
Did you read the same article i responded to? She sidesteps the question. At no point does she say that she will hand it over to Biden.
Gonna print this prediction: Trump will move left on this as an October surprise, some level of federal legalization. It will be immensely good politics, puts Biden on the unpopular defensive and as my wife pointed out, a good snub to his first attorney general.
Both the governor of Oregon and the mayor of Portland are not only incompetent but stupid. I can see with my own eyes and hear with my own ears. And Biden has always been a BS artist.

Trump support: cognition and crime. This is Biden's week points with swing voters.   Feelings toward Trump pro and con are influencing the election as opposed to feelings for Biden.  Rich is out of step with pollsters in the midwest.
Rich Thau on   Midwest focus groups with 1) Obama-Trump and 2) Romney-Clinton swing voters.  Group 1) 7 of 9 takes Trump over Biden; other people (VP &amp; cabinet)will control him because of his faculties; like economic prospects with Trump  #Election2020
While I partly agree, I think Trump will have a field day calling Biden feeble and senile and incapable of debating. I think the downside of not debating outweighs the upside.
Biden wasn‚Äôt my first or even second choice for the dem nominee, but damn I did tear up reading, ‚Äúfinding HER.‚Äù All of just possible picks are women, and mostly woc and that‚Äôs powerful

When is biden going on Chris Wallace‚Äôs show?  Give us a nice side-by-side.  Ya know, since trump won‚Äôt debate...
He meant instead of shooting to kill as has been happening. I don't like Biden, but that's misinformation.
Biden needs women of color advising him on his VP pick. He needs young people advising him.  We need someone to balance his old, white, male, Senate stalwart energy. The VP will be expected to run for Pres in 2024. We need someone ready to take that job.
Not sure how it is a juvenile question. I agree with you that they aren't the same, but that's just a weird statement. Here, I will help you. Biden won't tear gas a peaceful protest for a photo op. Not hard to give a reason.
Maybe he's emulating our next President:

Joe Biden is plagiarizing again in his campaign priorities!!! He says we should invoke the DPA, which Trump did on March 27. Also, Biden says we need more tests, which we are up to 750k per day. Biden wants everyone to wear masks, Trump administration said that on April 3.

Again, this is no time to celebrate. Democrats still must remain inspired, motivated, and determined. Always be mindful of the fact that the poll that really counts is the poll where we vote on November 3. Urge your family, friends, and neighbors to vote for Biden on November 3.
We‚Äôre not safe in Trump‚Äôs America.  At least Biden will try to work on stopping the coronavirus.

I love the Bernie is backing Biden crowd. I didn't write in Bernie because I thought he would win that way. I voted for him because I understand Alabama enough to know they loved Trump. He won 62-38 against all other options. He will win my state at least 58-42 this time.
Then, it wouldn't be close anywhere except maybe swing states...oh, wait. I tell you what if I'm not feeling too idealistic this time, I will vote Biden since my vote doesn'tmean anything. Trump will still win my state at least 58-42. Stay tuned for me being right.

That‚Äôs not enough. But what‚Äôs enough is that well planned voter fraud will take place on the Election Day when illegal aliens will openly cast their vote. Bingo! Biden is winning! Very simple.
It‚Äôs much more than $7.25/hr. Trump is not even thinking about increasing minimum wage but giving tax breaks for big corporations that will hire at $10.00-$12.00/hr. Joe Biden is looking out for workers.
This is not true. The Dems are not stopping the Terrorist in the streets, is that what you want for the United States? This is what will happen if Biden is elected. They spied on Trump and will turn this country into a socialist country!!!

Sounds just like you described trump. These people need to come out and share this info. Strange though... most people I've heard talk about Biden say he's a wonderful human being. Even trump cronies say he's wonderful and knows how to cross partisan lines to get things done.
I have issues with the two party system, but we're in crisis mode right now. I'll vote for Biden and probably protest Biden, but for our country's collective physical and mental health we need a new president. Hopefully Biden does more, tho I don't expect it.

Joe Biden agrees with you for sure.

Did you say you're going to beat Biden off??
There will be no miracle in Alabama. I hate to tell you. However, what's a more likely miracle? Biden. So, I may go ahead and vote for him. Depends how idealistic I am that day.
Biden‚Äôs America is now! #awaken
Of course I do. If I make a bad decision and the write ins and third party votes would have put Biden over in Alabama. Then, you'd have me over a barrel.
Every despicable thing he does emboldens his voters here. It is a bit disgusting. I will keep an eye on polls. If they get close to the margin of error, I will be pragmatic and vote for Biden. Just unlikely.
I want healthcare &amp; student loan forgiveness but w/out votes from the people who are scared shitless of the word "socialism" we won't get either. Biden has plans to expand healthcare &amp; fix student loans. Not my dream plans, but better than any possible alternative at this point.
Yes! He‚Äôs saving the country but u r so blinded by the fake media u can‚Äôt double check any other source! Freedom will be gone if Trump loses! Ifu live in the suburbs say bye to your home! No school choice! Biden will b all gov jobs! All living in cities! Communism v freedom

Gotcha.  This isn‚Äôt about Trump or Biden.  Fauci is the issue.  He hasn‚Äôt done a damn thing in the last 5 months except contradict himself.
Regardless of polling, assume Biden is 10 points behind and work accordingly.
I don‚Äôt think Biden is a racist. He is an opportunist. Says he believes whatever he thinks will get him elected. I don‚Äôt think he has any core beliefs. Also, I don‚Äôt think he is very smart - has no idea what policies make us safe and prosperous.
People need to wake up. You think its bad now let a incompetent Joe Biden and his left wing liberals run this country....we will collapse from inside and out.
Going nowhere is better than going backwards üëç. Think any of us actually want to vote for Biden? We're voting against Trump.
I have yet to see a Biden sign in Alabama. I figured it was because they were ashamed. Honestly, I haven‚Äôt seen any Trump signs or flags either since the ‚Äúprotests‚Äù started. I assume that is so their property isn‚Äôt defaced.
Then you don‚Äôt get to bitch, but something tells me you will anyway. Biden wasn‚Äôt my 1 or 2nd choice, but he sure is my 3rd choice over Trump.
Douglas Adams would write the perfect satire to win me over to voting for Biden‚Ä¶ but he‚Äôd never get around to submitting it until after the election.
Please correct me if I‚Äôm wrong.  But Biden does NOT want to defund police.  He wants to add to that budget.  Open for correction.
You are a despicable human being for these lies you are spewing on CNN right now!! You are AFRAID OF TRUMP!! WE ARE AFRAID OF YOU HELPING BIDEN, a man who can hardly speak!!!
Help the middle - middle aged-class go to college Mr.Biden! Please.
Dying doesn't seem to be doing very well in the polls.
Speaking of women treated unfairly. Has hunter Biden‚Äôs baby momma received any child support?
Joe Biden is and has been a racist bigot. His record shows it without any doubt. He is also mentally deficient. How can anyone not see it? How can you justify supporting his candidacy? I hate Sanders politics, but at least he has his wits about him
I've been registered 'No Party Affiliation' (not even independent or any 3rd party) since I turned 18 in '91, and have refused to vote party lines since. So I usually don't entertain politics at work at all. But from an employment‚Ä¶
Biden Already filling missing leadership Role as  poll #s dip into Sewer
Everything they blamed Obama (or are blaming on a future Biden presidency) is happening now, under Trump‚Äôs leadership.
This is what Biden‚Äôs America will be. Our great President wouldn‚Äôt send our top stormtroopers there if he didn‚Äôt think white lives were at stake #WakeUpAmerica #TheGreatAwaking #stormiscoming
Is Biden still hiding in his basement?  Does he have room to get a whole White House staff in there?
Obama and Biden team up for campaign video ahead of convention
Joe Biden commercial about "we need a President that loves masks"...while not wearing a mask. Interesting creative decision there.
Not gonna happen because they know he is a Complete moron. Hidn Biden!
Trump vs. Biden: Who‚Äôs Winning the Money Race in Your ZIP Code? According to map, there are more Biden than Trump contributors in the 35209, 35216, and 32226 zip codes, basically predominantly white Homewood, Vestavia, and Hoover - Bluff Park in #Alabama
. Trump, Biden poll update &amp; the Democrat party OBSESSION with race contin...
I hear you.  I'd add that Mayor Pete was a major first step and it is now more of a possibility.  And he will likely be the one to do it.  Say Kamala gets the VP and Biden serves one term.  A Kamala / Pete ticket would be pretty impressive in 2024.
It's going to be a numbers game. Whichever Party can get their voters to come out will win.  Biden is taking in more in urban areas  and on the coast while Trump is taking in more in rural areas and the suburbs. The electoral college might be a key determinant, also.
If you understand that Biden has the sexual maturity of a 14 year old, it will make sense.
Bruh you talk about division ! If Trump loses votes to Kanye West, we can easily have Joe Biden elected as our President. Why Kanye wears Trump‚Äôs hat... uhh no. I don‚Äôt even care! This political vacuum helps Joe more than anything. Biden - let‚Äôs get it man !! #Biden2020
Uhm , this is actually great. Kanye West is wearing Trump‚Äôs trademark hat - ‚ÄúMAGA‚Äù .  Kanye West can take Donald Trumps votes &amp; open a vaccum for the election of Joe Biden. It‚Äôs not like Kanye could even win ! Take away Trump‚Äôs votes to Kanye &amp; give em to President Biden !! #HIM
Just watch. All bets are off if Trump comes back to win, but if it's president-elect Biden, the catch phrase of November will be "we can't afford to live in fear anymore".
Nancy has no clue from one day to the next. A conversation between her and Biden would be fun to listen to. I would bring the popcorn.
But you know what the really stupid part is?  The instant Biden gets declared the winner in November all this magically just gets better. You just watch.

One track mind on display....
I‚Äôm going with Harris. Very bright with an engaging personality, experienced in government, young, passionate. She has a personal dynamic that Biden doesn‚Äôt.
. Why would you want more of the same government like Biden, Hoyer, Pelosi and others, not to mention some dumb Republicans. Oh my God, Tech is out to get us. What a bunch of fools. ‚òπÔ∏è
The New York post article misrepresents nearly all points in Biden‚Äôs plan while making absolutely no points! it‚Äôs just criticism without facts or data.
Biden Already filling missing leadership Role as  poll #s dip into Sewer
The kind of thing they would absolutely use to attack Joe Biden‚Äôs cognitive ability.
ABC 33/40 is working hard for Biden. But it won‚Äôt work. It‚Äôs all Trump in 2920!
Love barstool since 09‚Äô still will vote for Biden
Biden Already filling missing leadership Role as  poll #s dip into Sewer
Guys.... this election could be a blowout. Biden is killing trump in the polls...
Biden, "One nation under,  you know, the thing ".
Biden isn't a leader.
ü§£ The fact that that is what you have to use against Biden says so much.
Does Joe Biden actually believe the people he‚Äôs trying to get votes from are that dumb to believe our reported coronavirus numbers
A Biden ad! During baseball! When worlds collide!!
Wrong. Bad job? Huh? My stocks looked good under Obama! Now, tanked! Obama has listened to you enough. Now you get to listen to him, Biden and the American people.
This suburban housewife is all in for Biden. I know in my heart he won‚Äôt teargas me.
AOC 2028 (not because I want Biden to have two terms. Just bc she won't be 35 in 2024 üò©)
Biden is leading in the polls, but Democrats still MUST come out in HUGE numbers in November for Joe Biden to complete the task. Republicans are watching and they will come out in large numbers in November. The fact is that if Democrats come out in big numbers, the Democrats win!
Wow... Biden camp people have some strange ideas
I expect Biden to win these 3 states easily. The problem is still need WI, FL, NC or AZ to get to 270
Just more proof of Trump‚Äôs racism, as if we needed any. Fortunately, many of the hateful and hurtful things done by this administration can and will be undone by Biden and particularly with a Democratic Senate.
Joe. Biden. Is. New. President.
That's a disaster. He needs people to show up because he shows up. If Biden hides he needs to be out there. Fuckity fuck fuck fuck.
Unless their shit is true,  I don‚Äôt think Biden can be damaged by fake shit. #Biden2020Landslide #WearADamnMask
Biden is full of crap.

Full interview:
I am happy she nor Biden is listening to blue check twits on twitter &amp; in this thread. Because any of this can be investigated in one month, two months or even three months from now when the entire country is not focused on a FUCKING PANDEMIC
Where was this interview when he was running for president? This might make a good ad for Joe Biden even today. What is that
Instead of a debate can we please have Trump and Biden compete against each other on ‚ÄúAre You Smarter than a 5th Grader‚Äù on live tv?
Joe Biden gotta stop ignorantly ranting on race issues
If this is happening now,or last night technically, and Biden isn‚Äôt actually president, then who‚Äôs America is it actually?  Oh yeah, the guy in office who‚Äôs trying to say that what‚Äôs happening now is someone else‚Äôs America? No, this IS  America right now!
Yeah agreed, but like, is his base going anywhere? They're not going to suddenly shift to Biden. I suppose he just wants them to turn out in maximum numbers, which MIGHT work in states like Florida, Missouri and Kansas.
‚ÄúPicking a Black woman to be his vice president could boost presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden with young voters, white women and other key groups, according to a new poll of likely 2020 voters in seven battleground states.‚Äù  You love to see it ü•∞
Stevie is a Biden plant.  (keep up the good work *wink wink)
How are you so bad at this? Biden is going to have to start listing stevie as an in-kind donation to his campaign.
These are the images we need to remember in November. Nothing in our country will change as long as McConnell has the Senate in his death grip. If D‚Äôs don‚Äôt take the senate, no legislation will be advanced, even if Biden is elected.
Voting for Biden is saying your okay with him sniffing children and that‚Äôs just nasty it also says your okay with pedophilia and if your okay with that you need a bullet in your head ü§¢ü§Æü§Æ#reasonimvotingfortrump #joebidenisapedophile #votingred
I can cite sources showing Trump‚Äôs racism all day. I‚Äôm also no Biden supporter, but your claim has zero evidence. I however have this evidence of Trump‚Äôs friendship with Epstein.

Can‚Äôt wait to see how the left reacts in a few years to Reblican governors resisting Federal Troops sent in by Biden to enforce ‚Äúlaw &amp; order‚Äù for whatever reason. I‚Äôm sure the reaction will be the exact same.
Like Obama and Biden did, right?
and the GOP get a Biden not a trump like we did after Obama.
Typical Trumpian tactic. Turn the argument made against you on the opposition. Now, it‚Äôs the Lincoln Project and Biden who are in bed with the Russians, not Trump. It‚Äôs deflection. If you have more than conspiratorial theories, i.e. facts and data, let‚Äôs see it.
Biden, Obama pair in socially distanced video to decry Trump
Interesting. How are they hooked up? Is it business? If so, I did not know of any business deals. What business is Hunter Biden now operating?
Well this proves one of two things; either Biden is blatantly lying, or he is completely clueless on our presidential history.
On Wednesday, Joe Biden said that President Donald Trump was the country's ‚Äúfirst‚Äù racist president.
This is the MOST ridiculous statement I have ever heard from Biden.Trump has tried to help all CITIZENS of America to be safe &amp; prosperous. He wants us all to be educated &amp; have jobs. Democrats want children dumb &amp; adults dependent on government. How could anyone vote for him?
Biden also said that blaming China puts all Asians at risk since Americans can‚Äôt tell the difference from one to another. I know that I can as do my friends because we interact regularly with Asians of many nationalities. But Biden thinks ‚Äúthey all look alike to me‚Äù. Pathetic
Why? Because Trump can, Wolf and Barr obey and help him drum up the belief that if #Biden is elected it will be a police state, like the one they are creating. Typical wag the dog moves, yet turned on their own citizens.

I said this same thing to my roomie tonight. It will only take him doing 1 thing right and Biden loses
As Biden says four Black women are on his VP list, here‚Äôs who he could choose
According to Biden, Cocaine
Because if Trump is the first then when Biden wins he can put an asterisk next to Trump‚Äôs name for popular vote + impeachment and claim number 1 himself
This isn‚Äôt Joe Biden‚Äôs America this is the America the inept asshole in the WH has created and supported by yellow bellied ass kissing cowards called congressional republicans. People like you make me want to vomit.
Biden doesn't think Woodrow Wilson re-segregating the federal government &amp; showing the pro-KKK film Birth of a Nation at the WH was racist, doesn't think FDR throwing Japanese-Americans in internment camps was racist, but Trump saying "China virus" makes him the only racist POTUS
This is why I am not at all excited like Joe Biden. He‚Äôs just fundamentally wrong about so much basic shit.
You‚Äôre not stupid, Soledad. Biden and the far left calls this peaceful protesting. Trump wants to send backup to stop the violence.
We have heard those lies that you are saying on Twitter a hundred times. Yes, I retweeted the post because it means a lot. I am confident that Biden will do well as President. At least, there will be diversity and calm in Government again. Right now Government is in chaos.
Biden's America: #Biden2020 #Safe #prosperity
Joe Biden calls Trump the country's 'first' racist president
You people better wake up and ck out Biden‚Äôs history!!!! Jus sayin
Those are some terrible photos. I take it you do not object to protests but just to violence that may come from it. I have never heard Joe Biden endorse violence. Have I missed something?
Will he wish Biden‚Äôs America well after he has savaged it for 4 years
Hmmmm don‚Äôt really remember any of that from the Obama/Biden days
Pelosi didn‚Äôt seem concerned about the Wuhan Virus when she was encouraging Chinatown tourism in March. Biden didn‚Äôt seem concerned when he said the China travel ban was xenophobic and racist on Feb. 1st. Both are most hypocritical politicians ever. #maga
Ps girl if Biden picks you TAKE it we need you!!!!!
Thank you, Joe Biden. Tell it like it is.  Trump is racist and many other once shameful racists are now shamelessly proud of their own racism.
Sir, I only made a statement about you claiming Biden was diagnosed (has) Alzheimer's...and I merely asked for facts supporting you saying that, for a fact, he was diagnosed (has) Alzheimer's...and then you took it from there with your plentiful tangents, remember?
