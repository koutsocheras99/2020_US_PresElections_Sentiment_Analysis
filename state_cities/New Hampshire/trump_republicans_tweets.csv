Hybrid #Trump2020/#SupportTheBlue rally descends upon city hall
"Section 230 does not permit social media companies that alter or editorialize users’ speech to escape civil liability." "President Trump will continue to fight back against unfair, un-American, and politically biased censorship of Americans online."
Trump + COVID-19 + economic conflagration + election +  lies +  conspiracies = Unprecedented social unrest and upheaval in Q4. This is what we have to look forward to. 😔
Why is Trump responsible?? What about the Chinese??? They let it get out of the lab!!! Why aren’t they front and center in the real world today.
Doesn't change the fact, he attended a Trump rally, was infected with Covid-19 and now is dead. #TrumpFlu
Breaking: Donald Trump says tropical storm Isaias will also hit Alabama.
Look at all president Trump accomplished the first 2 years with a republican capital &amp; he even had traitors burrowed in the senate 👎😀🇺🇸
It’s how our friends justify/justified voting for Trump. Just like Hillary. They don’t even know why they don’t like her.
I completely agree obama being quite on uyghurs, But trump is using them for trade is worse.
Thanks for the ride Team Trump! IFBAP 🇺🇸❤️🇺🇸
I would much prefer a big deal and I think that’s what we’re shooting for,” Trump
While I loath Trump, and the Bush terms were not fun either, I honestly have to say it was Ronald Reagan who pushed us into the Republican upside-down. He constantly spoke (sappy sweet happy talk) about a real America oppressed by (the duly elected representatives in) Washington.
President Trump works hard to protect women from the evils of abortion. He knows that every successful abortion results in the death of at least one human, or more if the mother is pregnant with multiples. Abortion doesn't solve problems. It only creates new ones. #nhpolitics
You get out. Trump allowed Putin to put bounties on our soldiers. He’s un-American and a traitor. You too for supporting him
Was gonna buy the person behind me in the drive-thru his coffee but he gives me trump vibes so nevermind
Answer to How much damage can Donald Trump inflict on the United States of America by November 3rd, 2020? by Henry R. Greenfield
Yep Hydroxychloroquine now proven to work! Democrats still trying to shut it down! Just proves that the corruption from the democrats is still showing they will do anything to destroy America. They will allow people to die to make trump look bad.
No the world doesn't miss him. They may not like Trump but they don't miss this guy. He will rate middle of the pack at best..
I didn't vote for  nor did I  always agree with his politics. Today I think I miss having him as President. He never acted the way the current one does. I'm just incredibly saddened by Trump's words today and blatant attacks on our rights as Americans. #MyPresident
President Trump does all those things for me.
Didn't Cain contract the #TrumpFlu from a Trump rally?
Ask all Democrats you know this simple question. If Trump wins reelection, will you pause and think that perhaps just perhaps, it is you who are out of step? Just curious
Please try. I am amazed how you assume everyone just agrees. Impeach him - guarantee his reelection. A legitimate question. If Trump wins reelection will you pause and consider you are the one out of step?
Ever notice Trump always says alot of people are saying 28 million ballots mailed in California, they say it's going to be a corrupt election. Who the hell are alot of people, who's they, I want friggin names, not they, them, people. Are THEY PUTIN? Your own staff. #TrumpKillsUS
LOL Is this the new stratagy Thanks now I know President Trump is not part of the evil empire 😀🇺🇸
He died foolishly attending trump’s rally with no masks required. That should have been a red flag as his age and health history.
Why does MSNBC let Trump spred lies on mail in voting. Anarchy, agitators, open schools. He's dangerous. #TrumpKillsUS
#Angry  is what our country needs now. #RIP &amp; thanks for your service,  Obama's jab at Trump gets standing ovation
So UNH's survey of New Hampshire has... -Biden up 53%/40% on Trump -Gov. Sununu (R) up by like 30% -Sen. Shaheen (D) up almost 20% I think it's possible Biden's lead in NH may be a bit smaller right now than this (maybe like 8-10% or so,) but the rest checks out decently well.
He loves trump way to much
Karen here is a racist JPS trump supporter
That Donald Trump economy was not raising wages and pulling the inner city resident up and investors were not making vapor improve the to building business
Petty and irrelevant. Only JPS trump supporters care about emails. What crime was committed? I’ll be waiting a long time for you to answer with facts to back it up
#MasksSaveLives #MaskUpAmerica there is no law mandating masks in this state! We are self governing because our gov is a trump hooker
Trump cannot hold a candle to this man, no way, no how!
Schiffs offspring
Why wasn’t trump there
Donald Trump, president of the US, isn’t doing his job. He must clear out, and in all cases have arrested, the anarchists and traitors in the White House, including himself. Since he won’t do it, the citizens of the US will do it for him. You will be leaving so there is safety!
It's Unsettling.  Watching and waiting for the Pressure cooker to explode. I unfortunately don't think Trump will go away quietly.  It's gonna get uglier.  Sorry but that's what I see.
I guess JPS trump supporters say something stupid after first saying something stupid. Well done. Spanky
JPS trump supporters. You’re detached from reality
Name one. Just one. You can’t because you’re a JPS trump supporter
Pusillanimous JPS trump supporter says what?
All presidents have to be somewhat arrogant to run for office. Some more that others like trump. Ya fool
Boot kicking JPS trump supporters should be deported
Looks like you're trying to change the news cycle.   #TrumpEconomy
But it’s coherent unlike trump. Boot licker
I’m thinking you can’t tell the difference between facts and lies. That makes you a JPS trump cultist. Psst. He’s a confirmed pathological lier. Bless your brain
Why are all you JPS trump supporters azzholes too?
I take back many of the insults I have delivered in the past. THIS GUY is the really THE stupidest human ever. Says he got #Covid from rubbing the germs ON HIS HANDS against his mask. The mask was the problem. #TX1 seriously?!? #trump #coolade
I'm staying right here and fighting. Fuck Trump! #DumpTrump2020
Yes I do his name was Ronald Reagan and now we have Donald Trump what did we have in between that time sheep 🐑 we had sheep 🐑 now we have a real man 👨 running agaist a sheep 🐑 vote red vote TRUMP
As Trump continues to troll, giving him even more power🙄
Donald Trump, It must be killing you to see what a smart. black man President Obama is.  You can't find your way out of a paper bag.  We went from a wonderful orator to a stupid, stupid liar who we may have to arrest to leave the white house.  This is crazy and so are you!
the same people who call trump unfit to hold office are the same people who will cast a vote for a guy with diminished motor skills. unreal
Anti-fascist  And you think that's a bad thing.  Who is your favorite fascist leader in history?  Hitler? Mussolini?  No. I'm sure it's Trump.
Two Trump events set for today
Oh wait. Never mind. I was just trying to troll people who are for Trump. 😐
Not like we didn't see this one coming . . . BBC News - Donald Trump suggests delay to 2020 US presidential election
You have a large number of dems that will vote trump or stay home-they don’t endorse the rioting at all
#fundTheUSPS     We need attention on this.
David, can we harp on getting funding for the USPS? Trump has been pulling funding for it and we need to shine a light on it. #fundTheUSPS
My trump loving neighbor won’t even say hi back to us anymore and we have never even talked politics before...guessing it’s our democratic lawn signs. Sad state of civil discourse.
to cover all bases in assuring you win this election, please enlist the help of George W. Bush and any other Republican politicians to speak to their party about the dangers of reelecting Trump. Leave no stone unturned....this is too important!
donald trump is a douche
As the most respected Republican in this country, I BEG you to reach out to Republican voters and convince them not to reelect Trump! You know  he dishonors this country, Please, PLEASE don't let him do any more damage!!!
I think it's JL Caulvin, who is one of the best impersonators. He gets the cadence, and vocabulary, and narcissism.  He started Trump the Internet YT channel
So... you agree that Donald Trump now has traitorous intent? Good talk.
I’m voting for President Trump from NH as well as Don Bolduc for NH!
He caught that at a Trump rally!!!!  I thought the virus would just go away, right!!!
This is great. These guy had an accumulative 296 years plus Trump’s 3.5 years to create this mess but these same people are trying to convince us that Trump is responsible for it. Dems lie all the time but they can only convince some of us.  #Trump2020Landslide
This was more important than attending the funeral. right?  I will not support Patio Pizza nor you!!   Good bye Mr. Trump!!  Have fun in prison!!!!
No. The goal is to get Trump out. Nor a third party in. We can talk about that after. It’s basic triage. Stop the bleeding, then focus on smaller cuts.
If it’s so safe why is Trump’s kid not going to school in person??!!
What else do you blame it on. Look at his DEATH RECORDS. He died of CORONAVIRUS. Where did he get it?!? The #Trump RALLY!!
We need to start amplifying that we need to increase funding for the USPS that Trump has cut.
Herman Cain was a huge #Trump supporter. He went to his rally in #Tulsa with no mask. He caught #coronavirus.   After about 4 weeks in the hospital, he suddenly died this morning from COVID.   Donald Trump cannot be found at fault (waivers, free risk). #WearAMask #SocialDistance

Let’s see how long it takes trump to tweet. Still waiting for his condolences for the 150,000 victims to his incompetence!!!
Only a fool would be a moronic Q following, JPS trump supporter. You believe trump tells the truth and he’s a confirmed pathological lier. I’m thinking what you like best about trump is that’s he’s a sexual predator
If you support Trump, you share his mental instability.
Uh-huh.
This is too many steps ahead thinking for Trump.
If Trump puts up a ton of fights for #SCOTUS this is actually possible for a short time 😑
Trump is sayin' #NobodyLikesMe and I believe #NobodyLikesTrump
No way!!!  Good bye Mr. Trump!
No weed or bath salts for me- just logic and compassion.   Two things you clearly lack.   You should get back to work- Trump's ball aren't going to lick themselves.
I agree Trump will probably destroy Biden in the debates... What does that have to do with someone disingenuously  interpreting someone elses statements?
Here's an absolute truth of the universe:   Trump supporters have a second grade level mastery of grammar.
This asshole voted to impeach Trump because he asked #Ukraine about #CrookedJoe Biden’s #crooked son Hunter. It’s time to #ReclaimNH! #nhpolitics
Yes, President Trump took it, and he didn't catch it.
Another incompetent Trump hack.
Trump is a reality TV person and maybe saying he is against mail-in voting when it really benefits him.
So if your Republican or  a Democrat   Would you let Trump babysit your babies?
Yes I’d help them. When I was running across America, I was helped by many Trump supporters. Can’t let hate change you.
Trump doesn’t care what happens to Americans. He is working with Russia. Stop the madness. Protect your babies. Please
I think it underscores that this race hasn't been about Biden, and still isn't really. It's about if people want trump back in or not... and right now, it sure doesn't look like they do. COVID and the BLM protests helped push Trump's JAs back to where they have been for awhile.
Trump loves pedophiles. Are you ok with this
Yeah, well supporting Trump can get you fired, injured, canceled, or killed.
From this, it almost begs the question if people have made up their minds about Trump. For all that has happened over the last 9 months, the horse race and Trump's approvals really haven't budged THAT much overall. Polarization is setting in.
Par for the course for the left. They have proven again and again that nothing is beneath them if it means gaining power and eliminating Trump.
Donald Trump is a rapist. He likes the youngest of our children.
The state of the National Presidential Race with Biden and Trump over the last 9 months in RCP:  October 29th, 2019: Biden 50.1%, Trump 43.4% Trump approval: Disapprove 53.9%, Approve 42.4%  July 29th, 2020: Biden 50.1%, Trump 41.7% Trump approval: Disapprove 55.8%, Approve 42.9%
Trump loves his daughter,  are you uncomfortable. Is am
Instead of trying to sneak in $1.7 billion for the FBI building, Congress should use that money to fund the USPS. Or privatize it and say fuck you to Trump. The infrastructure is there.
Hey Trump supporters:  This is what he thinks of you. #NobodyLikesTrump
Trump 2020 baby!!!
I'm amazed at the number of Trump supporters I've talked to recently that are absolutely convinced that this thing is a media creation that will disappear on November 4th.   They think the numbers are exaggerated and it's not a big deal.

Funny thing about hats. If I wore my Trump hat some would flip me off some thumbs up.  But my Miami Dolphins hat they start throwing staff at me.
No president Trump, probably busy on Twitter!  No surprise, he hates Black people!  So if you are african-american and vote for him, remember John Lewis!!!!
What happened to presidential kids who kept quiet and didn't get involved with elections???  Only a big mouth Trump kid would; like father, like sin, oh I meant son!!!
When I moved to New Hampshire I thought this would be a great place to raise our son. Didn’t know trump stashes his criminal friends here. #badneighborhood
Biden for president!  Your dad has done nothing but make America the laughing stock of the world! My cat would make a better president than Trump!!!!
President Trump will fix our economy better than ever. If people want better paying jobs they should get a better job! Or go back to school and get a better education so they can get better job. How’s that for a solution? You are a joke and people see through you
Let’s hope this propaganda cycle mercifully ends quickly, like Trump throwing out first pitch at Yankees game.
I need a Biden yard sign ! The asshole neighbor just put up his trump flag! Help!!!
I think Sununu is a safe choice for re-election. He did a good job at distancing himself from Trump, and right now, he could emerge as a moderate in the Republican Party. To be fair, if the two party system is to survive, we need Rep leaders moving a little closer to the middle.
Trump is hated by the whole world, except Russia.  They see him as useful idiot!!  Like his teachers.
Am currently enjoying my 74th revolution around the sun! Seen and done a lot . BUT MY GOD! WTF? Is the USA TOTALLY CRAZY! Can’t believe what I’m seeing! Trump must be re elected or we’re FOOKED!
WHY ARE PEOPLE SO AGGRAVATING ?!!!?!!!!!!!!! STUPID TRUMP SUPPORTER NEXT DOOR IS TRYING TO TAKE OVER PART OF OUR LAND BY HAVING A GHETTO ASS "SURVEYOR" COME OUT AND JUST LAY STICKS IN A STRAIGHT LINE WHERE HE SAID TO. THE SURVEYOR DIDN'T EVEN SURVEY THE LAND.
Followed all! Thank you 💕 for the ride!! TRUMP 2020!!🇺🇸
Sad and weary that this awful man is our Attorney General. Praying all good people vote Trump and his circus performancer out in November.
Mr Vp we the nation know that will never happen with Trump in the Whitehouse. The US needs you to save us from him. Send help please!!!!!!!
Another Trump kiss asser
Hey  Trump take a good look in the mirror. This country is in state of  distress because of you!!!!!
I have seen no credible evidence of Biden's supposed cognitive impairment.  Trump, on the other hand, could be used as a casebook study for FTD/PSP.
This has aged well...

In the realignment that happened as a result of the 2016 election and Donald Trump, the Democrats have become the war-mongering hawk party. Strange thing for those of us who were active in politics in the early 2000’s.
Trump didn’t need to bring up an issue that he didn’t consider an issue and that happened with his blessing-
WOW. my neighbor who has the Trump flag was outside putting the trash out. I was outside at the same time checking my mail. I said hi! Thinking, ahh what the hell? We are neighbors. She fucking GHOSTED ME. What a bitch! I said "okayy." lol  #nhpolitics
Free speech is actually a thing.  Protestors have called for worse to happen to Trump, and his family without consequences.  Difference between MI and Portland, one is violent and happening on Federal property.
Trump criticizes those "protestors" that damage property and incite violence, but you know what? He's right there with them. His tweet is meant to create even chaos and divisiveness in the hopes he can profit from it politically. 2/2
has partnered with artists to #ArtTheVote and show the world that we’ve had #EnoughOfTrump. It’s time to vote Trump out!
Not the first time I've heard a sentiment like this from a Catholic priest: "suggested without evidence that the media have inflated the severity of the pandemic to unseat President Donald Trump"
Why? Are you racist or un-American or both. Don’t be a fascist like trump and please support the 1st amendment
Fake patriot. Learn about and respect the 1st amendment. Don’t be a fascist like trump
That trump with Epstein
You should stop being a fascist like trump
I never once mentioned Trump in the whole thread so clearly you like to group people who disagree with you togather and call them Nazis. You yes are the real Nazi here.
Because I disagree with you I'm a Trump Nazi dam lol man XD. Coming from a dude with his head so far up his own ass he's in an echo chamber. I never said I liked or hated Trump.
All of Michigan's 16 Electoral College votes were assigned to Trump, significantly contributing to his 2016 national electoral victory.  But, but, it's 2020 and Trump won't win this time...👌👌👌
We lose 3.5 million Americans each year on average.   Coronavirus has killed 4.5% of that. The death rate in total of the virus is around 4.5%   If Trump loses by around 4.5%....my work is done.
Trump is heading to Texas. He better wear the mask. They have it tough right now.
Anyone else watching Trump whine, it's worth a laugh, Calling out Germany for being late on their NATO fees, sick and tired of being taken advantage of. With Biden we don't stand a chance. I had my laugh for the day 😅.

Ok now I know your ill-informed. Legit Trump in  that same clip even stated basically not the kkk or any of that hit the actual peolle there not apart of either of those 2 extremist groups.
All Trump is doing right now is protecting federal property. He is playing the law &amp; order card while democrats tell their local P.D to stand down and basically tell the citizens their on their own, however if you fight the police will arrest YOU instead for protecting yourself
We will wait and see. Top level non political economists all agree that the 600$ is what’s best for the economy. Knowing trump he is extremely narcissistic and he’s going to pretend like he’s not for it and last second sign it so people think he saved the day.
I would honestly be surprised if this does not cost Trump re-elections. Here in New England if it was not for the man that invented the Segway and  Mr Kraft we would have been totally screwed!!!  They got the gear that was needed &amp; NY also!
These lunatics are never wearing Trump hats, but if the were, oh boy! The media would be blasting this racist nonsense around the country.
It's scary t hff at we have so many racist authoritarian (nazi) politicians in power licking Trump (Putins) bitthole. This isn't America I hope and dream of. Hate is America apparently.
You guys need to apologize for creating this monster. Starting with Reagan who kicked off his campaign in racist south and with his "welfare queen" bs, you guys have Trump on your hands. I'm a white 54 yo and I see poor black and Hispanics work hard as hell. FU.

I just can't contain my laughter that the best the Democrats have to go against Trump is an old, racist, bumbling, white guy who never knows where he is.
Dems hurt their chances by not nominating someone moderate and who could come out and take questions etc. Klobuchar would have walked over Trump. If Joe debates, it's over. I'm not happy about that. (Not overly sad) they messed up..peace

"But Trump's economy is booming"   Shove that lie into the empty space where a brain and dignity used to reside.
Shaheen's not losing, and the state isn't gonna be close at the Presidential level either unless Trump sees some huge upswing in his overall approval ratings. Trump could lose NH by double-digits.
“Bro Trump is a good business man” voters are awfully quiet
Honest question: Does anyone here really believe that Collins has a good shot to win most of the undecideds in these #MEsen polls? She's roughly around Trump's share of support, is trailing, and the vast majority of undecideds are gonna back Biden. And they don't approve of her.

In 2016, Trump was up in the polls in Texas by an average of 11.7... he eventually won by 9. Polls had predicted he would win in Texas by a LARGER margin than he did in 2016.  Right now, Trump is up in Texas by .2, according to all poll averages. It’s a swing state in 2020.

I can't believe we have to wait until November to get rid of another corrupt Trump appointee, Barr is a scum bag. Trump's fixer. Add an "S" to his name. That's where him and Trump belong. Behind Bars.
They’re glorified security guards with no jurisdiction outside of their dumb little exclusion zone that the city already said was established illegally. When, eventually, Trump is out of office there will be lawsuits out the wazoo against these guys.

I wished you cared more about America and less about Trump.
These violent protests are going 2 have the opposite effect: they make #maga  think that #trump is right- we need law and order. Rational centrists might actually drift back if this is condoned. Rioting is NOT protesting. I understand the hurt, but be smart, yur making it worse
Romney won more of the popular vote in 2012 than Trump did in 2016, and I think that's very easy to forget sometimes.

Yes, when a physician dies of COVID or influenza, it is obviously the fault of the President of the United States. It’s a worldwide pandemic with health care workers dying all over the world, but Trump should’ve passed a law against dying of COVID. or something.

Eh, I want someone further right than trump. But I’m not voting for a pedo or a woman so he’s the best we got currently, and I’ll support my president regardless of whether or not I agree with everything he may do
Eh, trump took proactive steps for covid and the left deemed him a bigot and racist for actions like banning flights in and out of China and Europe
I voted for trump because democrats destroy our major cities, take away our gun control rights, and want bigger government with more taxes. Trump is kinda a meme, but I’ll vote red til I croak

President Trump..a legend in his own mind!
Governors need to listen to their local experts and base their decisions on real time stats. Every state is different, but the need to take the surrounding states stats into consideration is important too. Trump wants a blanket, nationwide response.

Trump was briefed for weeks on Covid and ignored it when we had cases back in Feb. He thanked China for it's dilegence and stated we had it under control instead of taking it seriously from the beginning. He still downplays it and he and other Republicans compared it to the flu.
It's literally breathing down his neck....Trump's national security adviser tests positive for Covid-19
It would be fascinating to see if Trump, his administration, or his supporters, could go a single day without lying to the American public.

Let's face it, they're criminals. Protests are not violent, and they certainly don't barricade people in federal buildings and try and set them on fire. What President Trump and DHS are trying to do is save the law abiding citizens of your state. Who you should be representing?!
Trump is the CAUSE OF THE VIOLENCE.
All I see is COVID, trump, and anti police when I watch the news. So I stopped.
Ya but Trump went on—Biden is in hiding-
There's fraud and corruption on both sides and I'll vote for which ever candidate is best regardless of party affiliation. And that candidate is not Trump. Also Pelosi went to Chinatown in Feb, well before lockdown, all the while Trump was saying the virus was under control.
I don't believe it will end in November no matter who wins. Trump wins (which he better) it will get worse . Basement boy gets in , it will continue. They let the animals loose and what they want wont fly with the rest of us!  Black the blue  screw their green deal!

I think they are trying to raise panic and fear in the American public, in my opinion, in an effort to help unseat Trump.  And unfortunately they appear to be succeeding.
If some people are MAGA Trump Supporters, doesn’t that make them MAGATS?   Give it a minute.

Trump!
So I think the greater question would be: Just what DO you read??  And further, do you know how to interpret data, and critically think for yourself? My guess is no, if you are saying Trump said to inject urself with bleach, because those words NEVER CAME OUT OF HIS MOUTH

They are trying to stop us from driving &amp; using up the gasoline that’s also why they burn cars It’s all about oil &amp; resources to them That’s why Saddam Hussein burnt the oil fields &amp; president Trump preserved them Even Donald knows the importance of oil for our survival 👎😀🇺🇸
Also funny thing I notice about this - if the popular vote were exactly tied in 2016, Trump would've won MN and NH in addition to all the others he carried, and would've won 320 to 218 in the electoral college. The EC undoubtedly has an R bend to it these days.

They know the world is tired of of the dictatorial behavior of Trump AND Putin!
I completely disagree with the sentiment that enthusiasm for Trump is higher than for Biden. Enthusiasm on the Trump side is for what Trump hates, not Trump himself. On the Biden side, there is a ton of enthusiasm for an empathetic President.

US Intelligence has reported that trump had 7 phone calls with Putin since March and never once discussed the Russian bounties they are paying for killing American servicemen and servicewomen. And not one word of condemnation of Putin's Rusdian bounty program in all this time!
In 2016, Trump won AZ by 3.5%. Remembering that Clinton won nationwide by 2.1%, that would mean AZ voted about 5.6% more R than the nation as a whole - if it's similar this time, these polls further confirm Biden's 9-10% lead in national polling.
HOW IS THE COVID PROBLEM ALL ON TRUMP WHEN PPL HAVE BEEN DOING THIS FOR 2 months? And the Dems are cheering them on with the media. how is this the admins fault? Gaslighting..

An enduring historical fact will be the magnificent effort the Trump Administration has made to enhance and protect the credibility of government and its deep commitment to honest media. Trump is truly a gift from God.
Look at all president Trump accomplished the first 2 years with a republican capital &amp; he even had traitors burrowed in the senate 👎😀🇺🇸

So UNH's survey of New Hampshire has... -Biden up 53%/40% on Trump -Gov. Sununu (R) up by like 30% -Sen. Shaheen (D) up almost 20% I think it's possible Biden's lead in NH may be a bit smaller right now than this (maybe like 8-10% or so,) but the rest checks out decently well.
+60M voted for Trump. Assume Americans know nothing.
He loves trump way to much

By we, you mean Biden right? Because the only big thing Donny Traitor Trump will be winning is a jail sentence.
No, I agree the election should go forward, but I also think Sununu's refusal to say Trump should not be reelected despite, well, everything, is a case of putting Trump over country. Or Sununu's own career over country. Or both.
Obviously he’ll stick to the schedule unless Trump is coming to town and there is a chance he’ll be held accountable for risking the lives of Granite Staters   #nhpolitics

I had no idea it was that high. 40% of the black vote for Trump is remarkable. Now, If we can only  help black mothers understand how important it is to not listen to the democrats +keep + love their precious babies instead of aborting them.

And shame on those who try to shift blame away from Trump. Mr. Cain didn't need to attend such a large gathering when his immune system was compromised. But he did it to stroke the ego of our spoiled child president. It's a pointless loss of life. #trumpkilledhermancain
Just in:  poll shows  ahead of  in NH, 53%-40%, unchanged since June; Among women, Biden leads 63%-32%, while Trump leads among men, 49%-42% #nhpolitics #WMUR
Hermain Cain was a million times the businessman that Trump thinks he is. He was an example of black entrepreneurship and did more for his community than any one of his Republican peers. Sadly, he lost his life in the service of a spoiled child of a president. An avoidable death.
Gave up his life for Trump's ego.
Jesus, you have less class then Trump
That is not even remotely what he said. This sounds like a fiction someone in the Trump campaign might try to spin.
to cover all bases in assuring you win this election, please enlist the help of George W. Bush and any other Republican politicians to speak to their party about the dangers of reelecting Trump. Leave no stone unturned....this is too important!
As the most respected Republican in this country, I BEG you to reach out to Republican voters and convince them not to reelect Trump! You know  he dishonors this country, Please, PLEASE don't let him do any more damage!!!

This is some HOA bull right here. She can't have a BLM sign but her neighbor can fly a giant trump flag. #BLM
What else do you blame it on. Look at his DEATH RECORDS. He died of CORONAVIRUS. Where did he get it?!? The #Trump RALLY!!
Yesterday’s Globe reported on high level bipartisan meetings discussing scenarios where Trump loses but won’t leave. It mentioned Republican governors colluding with Trump to steal the election in the weeks after. Will you pledge to abide by NH’s certified results? #nhpolitics
Herman Cain was a huge #Trump supporter. He went to his rally in #Tulsa with no mask. He caught #coronavirus.   After about 4 weeks in the hospital, he suddenly died this morning from COVID.   Donald Trump cannot be found at fault (waivers, free risk). #WearAMask #SocialDistance
When "Keeping It Real" Goes Wrong, Trump Edition
He’s deflecting the conversation. He knows it can’t happen. Herman Caine just died of Covid after being at Trump Tesla rally. He doesn’t want that to be the news
My POTUS, Donald J. Trump, is  for the people. That's why he has my vote in November.
Herman Cain died not because of COVID - 19 but because of his membership status of the bleach drinking Trump cult.
He actually died because of his Trump cult membership. Let's be real.
Hiring a youth organizer is a waste of money when  platform is fundamentally opposed to action on the issues young people care about. The #Youthvote doesn't want a rubber stamp for Trump we want someone like  who will fight for us.  #nhpolitics

Trump would really hate if you requested your absentee ballot today! Learn how here:  #NHpolitics
I'm always sad when someone unnecessarily dies as has Herman Cain. However, Cain was a Trump cult member and promoted going to the Tulsa rally. I guess we reap what we sow. I just wonder how many other people's death Cain is responsible for.

Makes you wonder what Russia JUST did for the Trump campaign?! Election interference 2.0....

Between now and election day what odds will you give that Donald Trump retweets someone saying or conspicuously displaying the n-word?
Holy fuck. I read some comments. It’s really nothing but sheepism. Whoever tRump backs or says he believes!theyll all believe that person and turn on the actual person who’s the person we all should be trusting. I’ve lost faith in humanity with these ignorant clowns
I think it underscores that this race hasn't been about Biden, and still isn't really. It's about if people want trump back in or not... and right now, it sure doesn't look like they do. COVID and the BLM protests helped push Trump's JAs back to where they have been for awhile.
From this, it almost begs the question if people have made up their minds about Trump. For all that has happened over the last 9 months, the horse race and Trump's approvals really haven't budged THAT much overall. Polarization is setting in.
The state of the National Presidential Race with Biden and Trump over the last 9 months in RCP:  October 29th, 2019: Biden 50.1%, Trump 43.4% Trump approval: Disapprove 53.9%, Approve 42.4%  July 29th, 2020: Biden 50.1%, Trump 41.7% Trump approval: Disapprove 55.8%, Approve 42.9%
I would be more inclined to look at the Chinese communist party angle. They are in line to lose trillions if Trump gets elected.
This has nothing to do with Germany and Russia ignoring Trump's sancaton of the Russian natural gas line.  Russian connection conspiracy theorist: Nope, he wants Russia to invade.

This sounds terrible. That's like saying we really do have Trump judges, and Obama judges, and Bush judges. That by definition is not blind justice.
It's a mistake to dismiss what CA did. They didn't influence voters. They provided the Trump campaign with good data on where and how to message voters in important battlegrounds states, states Clinton was ignoring.
So all you trumpers If trump is a racist and a traitor, and you vote for him, are you comfortable being racist traitors as well?
President Trump will fix our economy better than ever. If people want better paying jobs they should get a better job! Or go back to school and get a better education so they can get better job. How’s that for a solution? You are a joke and people see through you

WHY ARE PEOPLE SO AGGRAVATING ?!!!?!!!!!!!!! STUPID TRUMP SUPPORTER NEXT DOOR IS TRYING TO TAKE OVER PART OF OUR LAND BY HAVING A GHETTO ASS "SURVEYOR" COME OUT AND JUST LAY STICKS IN A STRAIGHT LINE WHERE HE SAID TO. THE SURVEYOR DIDN'T EVEN SURVEY THE LAND.
Be glad you weren't flying Trump Air!
So, the guy from CO has invested millions into his campaign for US Senate, but his unfavorables have gone up 11 points (!), and he gets the exact polling % as General Bolduc.  So, I guess that Trump endorsement was a big nothingburger for NH voters. #nhpolitics

Free speech is actually a thing.  Protestors have called for worse to happen to Trump, and his family without consequences.  Difference between MI and Portland, one is violent and happening on Federal property.
Wait!  Biden is a racist but Trump is not?    You are no better than CNN.  Do you understand?
Trump criticizes those "protestors" that damage property and incite violence, but you know what? He's right there with them. His tweet is meant to create even chaos and divisiveness in the hopes he can profit from it politically. 2/2
Yeah, I can not and will not defend Trump
Yeah, in general I believe sports and politics should not interfere with each other...however, Trump is such a hateful, dangerous, racist piece of excrement I have to unfollow even Vikings fans that retweet or like his bullshit.
There's a reason you don't build low income housing in the country, you are literally beyond where the buses run which is quite apt for Trump, It's definitely his neighborhood
He thinks this is the 1970s where the state is going to build "projects" in your neighborhood. Nobody wants to take an hour bus ride to get the groceries low income housing doesn't work in the suburbs Trump is literally beyond where the buses run
No one said they did, I'm sure the silent majority will vote in the same % as the rest of the country 52% Biden  38% Trump 10% other

First Thing: Trump's 'serious' approach to Covid-19 lasted a week
Fact check: Trump falsely says 'large portions' of the US are 'corona-free,' repeats claim that protests are leading to rising cases
I’m not sure why your bar number hasn’t been suspended.   You lied under Oath to Congress.   Certainly you must know the consequences?  You don’t seem to see or feel the gravity of what you’ve done?   You consistently side with Trump who has no care for Americans
We will wait and see. Top level non political economists all agree that the 600$ is what’s best for the economy. Knowing trump he is extremely narcissistic and he’s going to pretend like he’s not for it and last second sign it so people think he saved the day.
Trump does not care if you and yours die of #TrumpVirus . Trump does not care if you and yours is evicted. Trump does not care if you can not feed your family. Trump does not care what happens to Americans. Trump cares what happens to Trump. #TrumpThreatensAmerica

#WhyIDontLikeTrump  Because.......trump. There's everything he has done,  But it's deeper than that. If he wasn't the president and I met him on the street I would still hate him. He is that disgusting macho guy that should have died with the seventys. It's not even real macho.
Trump murdered 1244 people today. Canada lost 11 people to Covid today.
How can Trump be expected to respond 3 years in to his presidency*?   The cupboards were bare, 3 YEARS in to his presidency*
Dems eliminating dept ceiling for the rest of Trump term was a mistake. It returns next year when Biden is elected. Would've forced GOP Senators to raise the dept ceiling for Covid bills? Should've eliminated  permanently or not at all,allowed deficit hawk hypocrites to skate

Miles of tape on you ripping apart the fabric of our country. This is the Trump version of making America great again.
DUMBOCRATS WITH THEIR TERRORISTS COMRADES HAVE "TRUMP DERANGEMENT SYNDROME". IN OTHER WORDS THEY ARE CRAZY. BRAINLESS!!!
They know they can't lie about it being peaceful anymore so now they have to find another way to blame Trump.
"Biden wins CA regardless" Yep  "She was a lousy campaigner" Yep  "She flopped with Blacks" Not *with* Biden and *against* Trump. This will be her value add   "There's her whole "racist" attack on Joe" That was politics, badly done (see lousy campaigner)
Not even the worse move. Dems giving away the dept ceiling for the rest of Trump term was worse. Since it returns next year when Biden is elected. Imagine forcing GOP Senators to raise the dept ceiling for Covid bills? Either should have eliminated  permanently  or not at all.

Shaheen's not losing, and the state isn't gonna be close at the Presidential level either unless Trump sees some huge upswing in his overall approval ratings. Trump could lose NH by double-digits.
“Bro Trump is a good business man” voters are awfully quiet
Honest question: Does anyone here really believe that Collins has a good shot to win most of the undecideds in these #MEsen polls? She's roughly around Trump's share of support, is trailing, and the vast majority of undecideds are gonna back Biden. And they don't approve of her.
Barr was repeating what trump said when asked that same question!

You might ask your folks, do either of you buy expensive drugs? If so, how much? Then see if any of what Trump supposedly did can help.  Seriously, first hand "test" for any BS. Then, if true, spread the word how you did it. Possibly help your friends, family and neighbors.
I would be asking them why would they support Donald Trump?
Here is the truth, ready?  NO ONE IN THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION WILL TAKE BLAME FOR ANYTHING!  THEY WILL NOT ADMIT TO MISTAKES OF ANY KIND.    What can we do about it?  VOTE THEM ALL OUT!

What a line of baloney. You lie thru your teeth. Look at VIDEOS!! Communist agitators..all of you! We the American people want these thugs arrested. Justice!! No dear its all YOUR COMMIE POLITICS!!.I 🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲🙏🙏🙏Trump,NO Communism!!
Prolly?   Anyways, we'll see in November. I think you're going to be surprised by the result. I think Trump has a bigger win than he had against Hillary.
You need to vote for Biden and the demand electoral reform to remove the two party hegemony. Sanders, Yang, Warren, Harris, Trump, and Kasich should all be standing, and then a run-off election can ensure a majority support the winner.
Romney won more of the popular vote in 2012 than Trump did in 2016, and I think that's very easy to forget sometimes.
Because if it does have benefits then Trump was right. They can't have that because then they lose the election.
They're not. You're delusional that you'd rather Trump be wrong than potentially save lives. Think about that. You're perfectly ok with discrediting a drug, that has been shown by countless studies to be effective, and letting people die so that you can say Trump is bad.
I agree with the ads, if only because it's opposed to trump
It’s important to check the stats in the poll.  Considering most Trump supporters refuse to poll, swing voters change their minds, and first time voters can’t be polled, I find these numbers dubious.

There are any # of ways Trump will dispute the election. (even in a landslide Biden win).  He will not go quietly.
SCOTUS case applies to delegates to EC. This scenario has Trump challenging vote totals based on (non) fraudulent mail in ballots. Court cases extend past EC voting day. Prez vote goes to House, Trump wins.
Believing one man caused all this and relaxing they day he is not in office will be our downfall.  Thinking Trump will not be still working some puppets in November is naive. We have to pay attention for the rest of our lives. We forgot to be patriots.

Barr is laying the groundwork to question accuracy of vote counts -- briefs with R courts. Trump will use this to throw vote to House. Trump wins with vote in House.
Because they'd rather kill people to win an election than admit Trump was right
Because if Trump was right all along Democrats lose the election.
He means “Thanks for sticking with Trump no matter how many of your citizens die.”
Because Lewis’s family hate trumps racism and don’t want trump there!!!
Trump has blood on his hands, plenty!   Thousands have filed lawsuits against him for allowing their loved ones to die while trump sat back and did nothing calling Covid a hoax!!!!!  Stick a fork in him, he’s done.
Trump surely profits from it but he doesn’t hate it.   He’s in bed with big pharma, always has been.

Maybe they are fed up with a government that does not respect them, shows more concern for a building then people's lives.  Honestly I don't know.  I am fed up with the government, fed up with trump, and if he sent troops to my town, I might just go show my anger.
Trump is still polling in the 40s. Nevermind the slice of GOP that may not vote for him again. There are millions still on board with the demonstrably worst President in American history. Ask yourself, what would it take for him to lose those votes? Being a decent human being?
Trump's hand gesture symbolizes his commanding resolution to the Covid crisis: to stick his thumb up his ass.
Usurper fraud President Trump has been gazing in the mirror so long he thinks everybody has his values. As far as America-hating, predatory sedition, nobody has pissed on the Constitution with more contempt and disrespect. Go suckle a dictator, Donnie.
Governors need to listen to their local experts and base their decisions on real time stats. Every state is different, but the need to take the surrounding states stats into consideration is important too. Trump wants a blanket, nationwide response.
Deport the trump family!
Show me one athlete who waves a Confederate or Nazi flag. From what I see, trump supports the Confederate flag, and his maga followers wear the Nazi swastika.  So by your argument, trump and magas are Traitors and fools.  I agree with you on this.

Not true at all. I’ve talked to people in the UK, Australia etc who are trump supporters. It’s all just racists supporting a racist in power to validate being a racist
Thinking peripherally, Trump will likely end up being the only president in memory who doesn't have a presidential library. He doesn't write and he's never had an original thought.
Ebony please trump is the idiot reporting anything else is funny. We are not that stupid. But I guess you think we are. Terrible retweet

Nicole, your words about trump were so right on; maddening, heartbreaking, overwhelmingly frustrating, but very,very true.
This is all happening in largely democratic cities. Its obvious you don't like Trump. But at least be honest with yourself. It is not his supporters that are burning, looting, rioting and killing. It's the left.

Trump was briefed for weeks on Covid and ignored it when we had cases back in Feb. He thanked China for it's dilegence and stated we had it under control instead of taking it seriously from the beginning. He still downplays it and he and other Republicans compared it to the flu.

I would never troll my president but happy to troll trump .
Let's face it, they're criminals. Protests are not violent, and they certainly don't barricade people in federal buildings and try and set them on fire. What President Trump and DHS are trying to do is save the law abiding citizens of your state. Who you should be representing?!

Does DHS have field Agents like the FBI? Or NCIS ? If so why would it hire a private mercenary force? Donald Trump doesn't trust law enforcement at any level.
You can, with a straight face, say trump is all about unity?  Kneeling before a game is to bring attention to police brutality to black people, hence BLM. If you want to claim that has nothing to do with race it's an interesting argument.

Actually not crying, trump is the worst president ever, but if you don't agree that's fine.
It is often said on here that the fish rots from the head. Getting rid of Trump, Barr and Wolf (if he's still in charge over at DHS - what is it Sunday?) is part of it. But when you hear abolish ICE - what they really mean is top to bottom reform and a change in admin culture.
Remember how trump threw those paper towels? Guarantee he couldn’t get the ball all the way to catcher even accounting for the roll.
I appreciate the trump supporters actually proving they are nazis.
I vote anyway. Even if it makes only a minuscule amount of difference. I fully admit my vote is basically because I don’t want Trump to get a second term. I also believe Biden would be leagues better.

Also funny thing I notice about this - if the popular vote were exactly tied in 2016, Trump would've won MN and NH in addition to all the others he carried, and would've won 320 to 218 in the electoral college. The EC undoubtedly has an R bend to it these days.
If DHS could do that, they’d have to arrest Trump. 😏
Is it because they like trump, because they’re racist, because they won’t put on a mask or all of the above?

Remember when Trump hid in his basement? Pepperidge Farm remembers.
In 2016, Trump won AZ by 3.5%. Remembering that Clinton won nationwide by 2.1%, that would mean AZ voted about 5.6% more R than the nation as a whole - if it's similar this time, these polls further confirm Biden's 9-10% lead in national polling.

It is you people that don't like it when we vote for someone who wants to make America great. And he is working for free! I voted for Donald J. Trump in 2016 and will do it again in 2020! Thanks to you Democrats!
First, I have the right to speak my opinions! Second, you have right to say what you just said! I am proud to be American, and a Christian and also I'm voting for Trump in November 2020. No one can change my mind! This is what makes America great.
Lastly, sure would an N95 for everyone be great, which protects you AND others? Absolutely. Is it feasible to supply those to 331 million people and change it daily while keeping some for healthcare workers? Hell no. Why don't you ask Trump why we aren't producing more.
One is inappropriate language the other is glorifying the fascism that caused endless millions in war and the holocaust. If you’re more upset by swearing than you are the deaths of millions your moral compass is broken. #nhpolitics (Nazi guy has Trump shirt on)

That part I remember. He got numbers from the Panhandle, Villages, and South West Florida I didn't think were possible.  I always used to say the Florida GOP was the most competent Republican operation in the country. Hopefully Trump and Desantis will run it into the ground.Thousands of people are buried there. They lost their lives in the two world wars. Some fought for the Kaiser, others for the Nazi regime. There were no Nazis around in WWI and Hitler and his criminals got in the last free election 33% of the vote. He got less than Trump.
In June, Trump decided to hold a rally in Tulsa. Some Republicans attended out of a sense of defiance, including Cain, who was photographed—like most  without a mask. Nine days later, he was hospitalized with COVID-19. Today, he died at a hospital
Or Trump orders Postal Service, which his crony now controls, to stop delivering mail because of some irregularity; lawsuits filed to order mail to be delivered; appeals; this is far from over......
Most people are so obsessed with Trump now that political beliefs don't matter.
Nobody deserves it. They shouldn't be blaming him, his blood is on Trump's hands.
On NH call, Trump is saying stuff about health care.   TL;DR: HE WANTS TO REPEAL THE ACA which would: - Kick 105,000 Granite Staters off plans - Kick 57,000 on Medicaid Expansion off their plan - End protections for 572,000 Granite Staters with pre-existing conditions #nhpolitics

Trump loves creating doubt. He believes his disciples will do anything to keep him in power.
A hallmark of authoritarianism is having democratic processes that are just for show to enact the despot's will. Trump is giving a signal to his Congressional loyalists. He can't do this himself, but they will.

Since when does Trump care what the Constitution says though??
If you had asked me in 2016 if Trump would try and delay the 2020 election because he was responsible for 30 million people being out of work and causing massive social unrest, I would have said that seemed like you were low balling it.
We always knew that Trump would try to find a reason to attempt to delay or cancel the election that would boot him out of office, but his own chaotic mismanagement of a global pandemic that killed 150,000 Americans was not on my bingo card.

Are we in the 1950s/60s? This is exactly the same sort of fearmongering, hateful rhetoric. Trump has also called women “housewives.” I feel like I should put on my house dress and curlers and make a casserole topped w/ crumbled Ritz crackers!  Actually the casserole sounds good.
Yeah, in general I believe sports and politics should not interfere with each other...however, Trump is such a hateful, dangerous, racist piece of excrement I have to unfollow even Vikings fans that retweet or like his bullshit.

What you fail to understand is that everything Donald Trump does is spectacular, special and successful. In the interview with Wallace, Wallace proves Trump wrong about some COVID stats, then a few minutes later Trump says he'd been proven right. The delusions...
COVID is being made worse by the media and the radical left. Because a miserable country wants change. Make its citizens miserable and you get change. Did I dumb that down enough for ya? Tell me again how Trump made everything worse.

We do need better masks but the mask on the lower right is better protection from this deadly virus than no mask at all !  trump needs to get off his ass and come up with a plan to save American lives!  All of the deaths so far are his fault, I hope he and his family burn.

It's National Guard. The states' run their elections. I'm an independent, formerly a life-long Republican, and this is pure bullshit! Voter suppression affects Democrats &amp; POC more than anyone, period! Trump's numbers are so low,  Dems don't need to cheat. That's a  tactic.

I don't think it's Trump. Obama and Biden started spying on the Trump people. There is a string of documents that show how corrupt they are. The media of the left doesn't report it.  The Steele dossier paid for by the DNC and Hillary for starters.
And people wonder why Trump supporters don't like to do it in the open.
My neighbor took down his Trump flag sometime in the past couple weeks. Now an American flag hangs in its place.  I accept that apology.

Not the ACTUAL safety of the attendees, mind you. Just how the media would view things.  This is how powerful the media is to Trump. He has always been moved to act, or act differently, based on how he is portrayed by the press.  USE YOUR POWER. NOW. While you still have it.
