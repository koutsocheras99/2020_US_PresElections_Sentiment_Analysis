My age doesn‚Äôt matter, especially since nowadays age can easily be discarded or used to support positions on matters like these when it‚Äôs convenient   You also forget that Trump was born and grew up in a time where racism and sexism was a lot more acceptable

an endorsement from President Trump, wow how great is that.
Who says we have to hear from a elected official only through official channels or the MSM. Trump's tweets are not for the elites they're for us. HE replies to us. Those living in the ivory tower of government are deaf to those of us in the trenches.  DJT isn't. And he responds.

Laughable...Trump has decimated China's ecomony and is forming an Easter bloc alliance with Poland and others to counter Russian reunification.  Mittens dits around making faces and acting like he's relevent.  #Mittsadouche
I think we all seen that coming.   Herman Cain May very well caught Covid at a Trump rally as well as at Walmart.   Bottom line is Herman Cain made decisions on where and when he would go somewhere and knew the risks associated with his travels.
Trump has given you so many specifics your head should be spinning.  Did you vote for Trump before? If not, why did you not vote or vote 3rd party?  This is not about anything but right now. Any excuses are to justify your feelings for another 4 years of destroying democracy.

We will not fall for the Trump con
This, coupled with his earlier abandonment of #Michigan bodes ill for Trump's campaign. Or maybe he's using reverse psychology. If he pulls his ads, maybe we'll miss him and love him again. Or, he knows he's going to lose and he wants to walk out with as much cash as possible.

There's legal and moral responsibility. #HermanCain ultimately made the decision to tempt fate and attend Trump's rally. It stands to reason that's where he was infected. But it was Trump, who for political self-preservation, summoned his "friend" to #Tulsa and to an early grave.

So, they are aware of the crime and death being perpetrated by Trump's bungling incompetence.  They just aren't sure if they'll vote for the guy responsible for 150K+ (and counting) deaths  OR  The guy who will effectively combat it.  Choose.
The real tale to be told here is how much Trump will be able to screw over the incoming Democrats with his remaining 2.5 months and total lack of cooperation on the transition
Thank you to the past administration for the wall
Nice idea, but you don't just open your doors at full capacity. Thats why we have a advertising/mktg budget. Of course this shutdown is why so many co's will not be able to reopen - period. The pipeline is empty, the referrals gone. It can be rebuilt but how long to scale?
Really weird that Trump doesn't enforce mask at his rallies. He's literally killing the few voters he has left
I could swear I read this same article in 2016
I just heard with my own ears u say Dr. Fauchi wants us to "wear goggles". You're disgusting.. #DrFauchi did not make a recommendation for everyone 2 wear goggles. He said if you have a pair it doesn't hurt to use them. You distort the truth, like Trump. Go to church... u need it
I'm a union guy local 797 out of Las Vegas we're all tired of the Democratic party you've got my vote I'll tell you right now sick of this BS hard working man thank God for Donald Trump
I remember something like that from before
Love when the trump trolls out themselvesüòÇBYE
When #cancelculture gets what‚Äôs coming to them. I‚Äôm so sick of these petulant little punk ass ‚ùÑÔ∏è children. Just fuck off already. New York restaurant owner canceled for flying Trump flag. Good! Cancel this you bitches. üñïüèº
Sure #TrumpHatesScience , but did everyone know trump and his supporters also hate big mean celebrities?? üòÇ
Law &amp; Order, right? Besides lying to the FBI, have you conveniently forgot about him representing Turkey WHILE being Trump‚Äôs NSA?
Compare him to Trump. Everyone looks better when you do that.
You were really cruel to Obama.  People like you caused the hate that led to Trump. Thanks for ruining America
Good for you &amp; I'm all in!  Since becoming disabled.. I also vote by mail &amp; it's great to have that choice &amp; it's safe!  President tRump &amp; many politicians voted by mail but now claim it's unsafe? BS!  Scare tactics won't stop me from voting.. by mail! #WeWillVote #SaveAmerica
I resign immediately,the only thing we want to hear from Trump.
GOP governors mostly stuck to Trump's approach to #COVID. Democratic governors mostly went with the most extreme lockdowns. Guess which states have the highest death rate? Democratic states have more than double the death rate from #COVID
They show how crazy Trump is!
At this point ANY 'friends' that still support #Trump ... do not deserve your friendship. Tell them good-bye, but leave the door open, say, "when you see the light and actually start to care about what is best for our nation PLEASE give me a call. Until then just wear your mask!"
Trump advertising on Worldometer Covid site. That‚Äôs some genius marketing there. Next up: ads on unemployment websites.
Trump means soon like he will announce something that probably doesn't exist before the election.

Just so you know, Republicans who hate Trump are always welcome in my feed!
He really loves Trump
Not surprised the lady deadlifting next to me wearing the Trump mask and Blue Lives Matter shirt, can only pull 70 lbs. Pussy.
Is Trump's sheer incompetence now being referred to as the "Invisible Enemy?"
44,000 tweets in a year.  Bots are all Trump has left. And they aren‚Äôt getting it done.
Amen to that! tRump‚Äôs dangerous ass should have never...NEVER cross the doorstep of the People‚Äôs WH!
Cohen is as good a lawyer as you are an actor...  You two jokers won't be the first to try to enrich yourself off of Trump and you won't be the last...  Bottom Feeders....
Yes- this is definitely on Trump and his grossly negligent mishandling of COVID19.

But who decides what is/isn‚Äôt false info? Not you. Politicians &amp; ‚ÄúFact checkers‚Äù who AOC clearly shows in this video are not infallible. Say this bill passes and trump is elected. How much of the existing media in the US do you think he can deem as fake? Slippery slope my friend

‚ÄúDo I want to see a date change? No, but I don‚Äôt want to see a crooked election,‚Äù Trump said. Then take the crook out of the election and announce your concession now. #VoteTrumpOut
Seems like Obama is anxious to talk maybe this is the time for someone to ask him about spying on Trump. No one in the media has the balls.
I'll be back in 20 minutes. I just listened to 32 minutes of Trump crazy and now I'll have to spend the next 20 minutes pouring disinfectant into each ear hole.üëÇüëÇ  #trumppresser ü§¢

By definition  Biden isn‚Äôt a fascist  And trump is  Biden is just some corporate neo lib stooge and trump literally wants to try and rebirth America from a sense of loss the ‚Äúothers‚Äù gave him by expelling those ‚Äúothers‚Äù  So, let‚Äôs not be silly now
Are you as concerned about Donald Trump‚Äôs assault on our democracy? It‚Äôs hard to take your expressions of concern seriously given the NV GOP radio silence regarding his lawless actions and life-threatening incompetence related to COVID.
Too coincidental &amp; right after the impeachment fails... who the hell knows what they have in store next?  Something big, I‚Äôm sure.  It‚Äôs scary.  We‚Äôre sitting ducks.  I think they thought even Trump supporters would be tired of the chaos, but it only made me a stronger supporter.
Of course - TRUMP‚Äôs Plan is to SABOTAGE the USPS and suppress our VOTES!!!
As much as I despise Varad, I admire his faith in Trump. He cherry picks good news when he can find them.
Oh ffs  Trump campaign hosting 'Evangelicals for Trump' event in Las Vegas on Aug. 6

Trump has got to go even if you have call secret service to throw his ass outü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨
Trump‚Äôs in deep shit. These people are starting to wake up.
While Trump tries to distract us from the bad economic report that came out this morning you should know the facts: (1) The president does not have the authority to change the date of the election. (2) #VoteByMail has been proven to be secure &amp; accessible.
Confirmation of what many of us suspected: in the early days of the pandemic‚Äîand probably still now‚Äîif you lived in a blue state Donald Trump didn't think you were worth saving. #TrumpVirus #TrumpFailedAmerica #LockHimUp
How are those unemployment numbers? How‚Äôs the GDP? How‚Äôs the death toll from the Trump Virus? Stop drinking bleach, it‚Äôs messing with your already limited intelligence
FACT: President Trump cannot postpone, delay, or cancel the election. Election Day is set by act of Congress and only Congress can change the date.
President Trump is trying to confuse people about his powers on the timing of the election. The facts are clear: the president does not have the constitutional authority to move or delay the election. We follow the Constitution, not Trump's tweets
Hahahahaha!!!!!  You think that because trump killed Herman Cain there‚Äôs going to be a civil war?  Hahahahaha!!!!!  You people are funny
What I don‚Äôt get is why everyone around Trump gets the coronavirus but not him‚ÅâÔ∏è‚ÅâÔ∏è‚ÅâÔ∏èü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨
When it comes to Trump you can never says it is "the dumbest thing I have ever heard' - Trump will always trump his last dumb action guaranteed.
‚Å¶ I mean...
TRUMP is DELIBERATELY sabotaging the USPS!  TRUMP is DISPARAGING MAIL-IN BALLOTS!  Because VOTERS won‚Äôt need POLLING STATIONS - that REPUBLICANS love to close!  VOTERS won‚Äôt need time off work or have to wait in LONG LINES!  REPUBLICANS can‚Äôt CORRUPT the VOTING MACHINES!
When Trump says he's put America first, keep in mind his defense for his perfect call with Ukraine was that 'he' meant America. So when he says that, he means him first. Every single act by him for the last three and a half years has proven that.
absolutely right joe... he should not be the president‚Äôs ‚Äúwing man‚Äù  oops... my bad... that was eric holder who said that:/   democrats are clowns ü§°   TRUMP 2020!!! üá∫üá∏üáµüá∑
Let's get Trump out of office now.  time for you to have "the talk" w/  &amp; explain to him why he must resign immediately. Trump has lost it before, but right now he is self destructing &amp; actually showing how racist, unfit, &amp; incompetent he is.
His blood is on Trump‚Äôs tiny hands.
Finally, Trump says something that I can consider the truth.
Joe Biden has a pretty long list of accomplishments, lol.  The only thing Trump has over Biden is the presidency, as Biden has never been President
100% agree with your sentiment.  Nobody who wants Trump out (like I do, passionately) should get complacent about this regardless of published polling or odds.
Since Donald Trump wants to move the election back, let's start a #movetheelectionup  no need to wait until November!!
Its only convenient now that the Democrats realized people don't like riots and Trump is gaining popularity points.
This is why big business, the establishment, the derp state and the corrupt politicians all in cahoots, hate Trump. Cause he has the brass balls to do what no other weak politician would do.  #MAGA2020Landslide

Wow! You might have found Trump‚Äôs burner account
He died from complications of Coronavirus. Don‚Äôt gloss over it. He got or had Coronavirus from the Trump Tulsa rally.
Yes, it currently is very terrifying. Youre correct... thats why we need Trump out of office so the adult can take over and actually get things done.

Considering what Trump has done to this country, and is doing, I would hate to think that nobody hated him.
We are superior. Especially to you. HE DID GET THE #TRUMP VIRUS AT THE RALLY!
Poor tRump.. he's finally realizing &amp; scared if everyone is allowed to vote.. his reign is finally over! Bad news.. it's over either way! üòâ  I'm disabled w/severe neuropathy but I would mount a horse &amp; stand in line to VOTE &amp; STOP this GOP insanity! üòâ #WeWillVote #SaveAmerica
Where are the female reporters Alcindor, Reid and Wei.  These softball questions by these men are fragile.  These women put Trump on blast.  Maybe they are there and he avoids them for the 5 questions he allows.  His bragging is revealing; he's in another time dimension.
President Trump is trying to confuse people about his powers on the timing of the election. The facts are clear: the president does not have the constitutional authority to move or delay the election. We follow the Constitution, not Trump's tweets
FACT: President Trump cannot postpone, delay, or cancel the election. Election Day is set by act of Congress and only Congress can change the date.
The Great Depression was created by a 15% decrease in the US economy.  The 2d quarter of 2020 experienced a massive 33% decline; twice as bad.  40 million people lost their jobs.  At the same time, 152,000 people died due to COVID-19. The Trump Depression?
Proof #Trump is a racist. He killed his only black supporter.
Not sure what you mean.  The odds of Biden winning are currently much better than marginal.  Of course so much can change by November.   If you truly believe this, you should immediately get on a betting site and put big $ on Trump.  He‚Äôs a +150 dog right now.
Trump: "Herman who?"

Done! Pompeo - Barr - Trump all must resign immediately.
The fact that Trump refused to attend the funeral of the late John Lewis should speak volumes.  Nov 3rd this nightmare of a president will be shown the door!  #racist #bigot
Today‚Äôs BS BO‚Äôs press conference aka eulogy at a FUNERAL reminded me why YOUR POTUS Trump is vilified and attacked daily. Many of you cannot accept POTUS Trumps brutal truths and prefer BO‚Äôs eloquent lies. How sad and troubling
Thanks for endorsing Trump!   Biden sure doesn't speak in complete sentences
Ok I'm not going to read any responses but my guess is they are all anti Trump... let's see how rite I am.........
Haha. Trump will cure the plandemic. Smart move!!! Watch the numbers lowering into nothingness :)))
From what I've seen, I'm not sure he ever went. Maybe Trump's entire school records were "Fake Education".
Damn, that's funny. I like to rewatch the looks on their faces when one state after another fell to Trump. "Well, golly Lucy, how's Hillary gonna pull off this one." "Oh, Ricky! I KNOW she will." And in other news...Wisconsin just announced...
If Americans want to honor Lewis, we need to get Trump out and his followers üò°
That crowd would not fill the front bar at an Applebee's. #trumpLoser
Fuck it let him delay it.. lol.. Pelosi comes in.. Removes tRump for the wh, bare from Doj, and devos from Doe..
Yes, I do, but I'll be extremely happy when I no longer see a single sign of Trump.
Maybe, just maybe, someday president* Trump will be able to complete a thought or a sentence.

That is a stupid Tweet. He is more cognizant than Trump.  You really have fallen low
So,  and Trump are being briefed.... So basically Biden is our President, right?
Geezus tons of weak excuses and petty jabs.  What does that accomplish?    Did Trump write this for you?
üî•WELL DONEüî• trump and the #GOP will DEFINITELY LOSE in November. They just lost 30 MILLION votes from unemployed workers.  üó£üì¢ trump lost the popular vote by only 3 million votes in 2016. #TrumpIsALoser  #GOPLosers
So Trump wants to move the election from Nov. to some other unknown date to protect from ‚Äúfraudulent mail in ballots‚Äù, but he votes by mail himself.  Takes a vote to do it and the answer is no wannabe dictator Trump.  In other news, Kelly Ann Conway wants Christmas moved to May.
I don't think Calabresi saw the ??? on Trump's tweet. He didn't call for anything.
Great job chuck since trump says he wants bigger stimulus checks for americans get more for us then 1200. And the countless americans suffering and grieving during this virus
You don't know that. Herman Cain another Republican was at Trump's Tulsa, Oklahoma rally two weeks later he's in the hospital. He died today from the Coronavirus. He wasn't wearing a mask. Coronavirus is a equal opportunity killer. No matter your race or age
Been thinking. I see others saying Trump won't leave office  peacefully, but I can't imagine him staying after the he loses the election. That would give Pence &amp; congress time to do a lot of damage during the lame duck, no?
Trump doesn‚Äôt have that much power. God decides when a person takes their LAST Breath!!!
trump is also a pedophile so you‚Äôd be voting for that too but we don‚Äôt want biden either, but we have to settle, it‚Äôs better than trump.
I voted for Trump...he won...I'm smart

trump has 43 rape allegations against him (including minors) and has sexualized his daughter countless times (even when she was a minor)
Trump turns a press conference into a rally and how dare he fool us all. Obama picks a funeral and its ‚ÄúAll Hail The Black Christ has spoken!!!‚Äù Good God this country is twisted up right now.
Oh well, shows we‚Äôre willing to do anything to get rid of Trump.üòò
Oops &amp; what about this. What a forceful response by our leader. So tough. Trump is all talk. No action. #JustLikeABully
It's sad this could have all been prevented.  I lived in Thailand &amp; hear their news. They took the virus seriously.. immediately asked Thais to wear mask, checked temps &amp; tested.. out of 70 million ONLY 58 deaths!  But tRump &amp; his stooges still DO NOT believe mask &amp; test help?
It's a bot....
They are already prepping you for Biden to win even though you know the majority voted for Trump. Looks like you're all going to have to fight for freedom this time!!!
WTH?!? Like we don‚Äôt have enough problems here...Trump campaign hosting 'Evangelicals for Trump' event in Las Vegas on Aug. 6
Super  stressed. I can‚Äôt handle 4 more years of this dictatorship. My anxiety is out of control. I‚Äôm at the end of my rope with trump, the GOP and his horrible supporters. I have NEVER felt this with any other president.
Trump Stooge  via  #iamnottrump
And there‚Äôs Iraq &amp; Russia. So much more. You want to start comparing. Trump is as corrupt as they come. Even trying to cover it up.
They are already prepping you for Biden to win even though you know the majority voted for Trump. Biden will not defend the police he will make sure they have lots of guns and tanks to kill  anyone that wants freedom #RedFlagLaws
I agree. And yet, I spent two days trying to explain how he was not credible to ardent trump followers. It was a huge waste of time. They are convinced we are the ones with our heads in the sand, and just refuse to think we've looked into it objectively. It's frustrating.
This nothing more but a Biden flip of you ain‚Äôt black if you don‚Äôt know to vote for Biden  I‚Äôm not Christian enough if I vote for Trump?  Total BS and already used  Find yourself new material or set down and shut up
And for the record more civilians killed in drone strikes than under other Presidents. I‚Äôm sure there is corruption on both sides, all levels. Trump is even worse so don‚Äôt start that convo.
They want to replace Trump because he‚Äôs going to get crushed in November. It‚Äôs not a good faith realization.
Says a Dem, yeah right pal  There are two choices Trump or Biden  I can handle 4 more of Trump but not 1 week of Biden  What now pal? Suck your thumb sitting on the sidelines or MAGA
Because of the fact that Trump refuses to question Putin about the claim of him paying Talibans for killing American Soldiers, I don't understand how so many military people still support him. Don't you Military people care?   via
What would Trump gain by delaying an election?
The Republicans in the House and Senate are just as guilty as trump...should we assume you're voting for Democrats for Congress as well?
Big f.....g deal. Barr is as corrupt as Trump and the whole country knows it by now, not to mention the most incompetent and out of touch president in the history of US.
His paranoia. This tells me he thinks Trump is gonna lose
Having a safety net is such a bad thing. You like Trump cuz he keeps ‚Äúminorities‚Äù in line. You want the republic or democracy to die so Trump can be leader for life. We are gonna become Russia people like you‚Äôs biggest fear. I‚Äôm educated I see a Nazi when I see one. Trumps Hitler

Trump has no power to delay election, experts say
This is from April
Folks. Forget impeaching Trump. Let‚Äôs just whip his tail with the election. It will be here soon enough, Nov 3rd!
Because she would have to actually work. Trump pass the buck hacky.
I truly believe Herman Cain, a vibrant 74 year old politician, would be alive if he had worn a mask &amp; practiced social distancing/small groups. There are many others like him. This didn‚Äôt have to become a political issue. Thank you Trump.
I thought that was pudgy trump standing there.
So we‚Äôre probably gonna miss Trump‚Äôs goal of 5 percent per year GDP growth this year by at least a bit.
Ok. Well good luck. Trump wins we may not make it to a 2024 election. Or if we do, the system will be so rigged that Republicans will run the country with a 40% plurality. Trump will get worse, not better.
Does anyone else think that Putin could wake up one morning and decide to just slap a black, spiked dog-collar on Donald Trump and force him to walk down Main Street on all fours, barking vile obscenities in Russian? I mean, if he really wanted to, he could, right? #PutinsPuppet
America‚Äôs second civil war will begins Nov 5/20 after President Donald Trump wins the Federal election in a landslide. The cucks will start the war. There will be liberal progressive cucks killed by the hundreds of thousands per week until every last one of them is eradicated.

Good. Lewis disrespected Trump and Bush but Trump is not a hypocrite like Bush
Look up Bills &amp; Executive Orders that President Trump has signed. There‚Äôs lots of them &amp; he‚Äôs signing more.
"Trump Might Try to Postpone the Election. That‚Äôs Unconstitutional."  "He should be removed unless he relents."  Here we go again with the NYT and its liberal op-ed writers.
Trump has come to realize that he cannot defeat Biden. He's grabbing at straws, seeking a way to stay in power.
We never had a fraud con man fascist putin puppet like trump either. My point is consider the source and dump trump 2020 before he causes more damage.
0.00005% This is the percentage of fraudulent mailed in ballots according to an MIT study that looked at HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS of votes spanning DECADES. Trump is full of shit. He knows he is losing and he's looking for excuses and justification to challenge the election results.
I listened to President Obama give a eulogy for John Lewis today. I hung onto his every word. I find it very difficult to listen to Trump. He sounds so ignorant and repetitive.    via
Dude- He died because he was a fool who belittled, like 45 himself, the COVID guidelines of Trump‚Äôs WH. He was extremely irresponsible which, in turn, put his entire family and close associates at risk. This is the cost of the conspiracy theories endorsed by conservative media üëé
My 5 year old student said this to me today:   ‚ÄúMs. Ashley, do you know who the worst president is especially during this time? Donald Trump because he‚Äôs careless and doesn‚Äôt care about us!‚Äù
Why does the left hate Trump? Because he's not a long term politician who is a member of the insiders club. No one owns him. They can't control him. He's a threat to their power, status quo &amp; wealth. Why else would they lie &amp; cheat for the world to see just before the election?
If Donald Trump thinks we can move the election back, what‚Äôs stopping us from moving the election up?   I‚Äôd gladly vote his ass out of office in August; there‚Äôs no need to wait until November.
Another number pulled out of an ass.  You want schools to open because Trump thinks it will help his chances in an election he knows he is losing. Shut up and sit down.
tRump does not nor did he ever Care about the Military #TraitorTrump
This is an honest competent poll that weights sample to Census Bureau data on 2016 turnout.  However, it's been shown that CB data undersamples GOP demographics by 2-3 pts.  Reality is more like Trump 50%, Biden 45%.
The fact that you can‚Äôt see the threat to our democracy is scary but I bet you think single payer health care is evil. You are part of the problem. Trump wants to destroy America he wants to be Putin.
And you think he did that willingly? You dont think Trump, who could fire him at any moment, had or has a muzzle on him and controls what he does or does not say? We've already seen Trump fire cabinet members for disagreeing with him.
Cain was photographed at TRUMP‚Äôs FAILED TULSA RALLY!  NO mask NO social distancing  Cain KNEW the risks! Cain paid the price I‚Äôd listen to TRUMP and NOT common sense!!!  There are 150,000+ DEAD AMERICANS because TRUMP did NOT listen!!!
is Trump's tweet about delaying elections cool with you?
That's what Trump wants. He wants to sow doubt about the election. Making it an all mail in election plays to him.   We should put on masks, social distance, and go to the polls to vote whenever possible.   Whoever wins should win with as little doubt as possible.
#Trump Nobody likes you and nobody wants you to be president.  Stop messing with the #USPS, the #election2020 and the #AmericanPeople.  WE have the power, and we will NOT tolerate any more of your nonsense.
If we hold off we will never vote again don‚Äôt underestimate Trump he wants to be a dictator
John Prine was one of the first celebrities to die. He was no trump supporter
It has nothing to do with Trump. I agree with your first statement. The person you are replying to says they are a leftist in their bio. Maybe wrong thread?
Next week Biden announces his VP pick.  Hoping it's Kamala Harris.  She is awesome and won't take any crap for trump and his loonies.
Trump -vs-  Whoever they get to run the country if Joe wins.
the Democratic party screwed you out of your nomination but it wouldn't have mattered any way because the American people see through the Democratic party &amp; how they're willing to destroy America just to get in the White House which is why Trump will be re-elected in a landslide
Are you really that blind to the political environment right now that you don't think making sure the presidential election is as doubt free as possible should be uppermost in everyone's mind?  Doubt is pernicious. We all should not want to give Trump any toehold to that.
He just now realized?  Either this brilliant man is a complete moron, or this is just the continued baby step distancing of the GOP from Trump.
You still can read any bills or executive orders signed by President trump. So who‚Äôs the cop out? Not me.
Correct. Trump is so incompetent that they think competence, speaking above an elementary level, and believing science makes you the greatest president ever.
you'd think he'd chill on the Dr Trump stuff...

The Memo: Trump's real target is election's legitimacy
It's clear Trump has no intention of leaving office even if he loses in a landslide (which looks likely). His plan is to use the military to terrorize US citizens that don't agree with him. This is an attack on the very existence of the US. He should be removed him from office.
This is what Mr. Calabresi is really concerned with. He doesn't want to risk Nancy Pelosi becoming president. He'd rather see Trump impeached and Pence take over than risk a Pelosi presidency.
Wrong. The Cato Institute did a poll last week which said 62 percent of Americans will not disclose who they support for fear of retribution. Translation: there are more voters voting for Trump than their are voting for Biden.
Par for the course. No sense of decorum with Trump. He is a walking talking living breathing disgrace to the Presidency of the United States. No respect for anything and clearly out of his depth as President of the United States.
Rep. John Lewis devoted his life to fighting for the right to vote and Trump has devoted his presidency to waging war on it.
This is literally the dumbest thing I've read today, and I've read all of tRump's tweets.
I have made it my duty to blast FDT any time I can be anywhere near a car with a trump sticker, today was at sonic üòÇ
What Trump is saying is "if I don't win then the election is rigged and invalid."   Don't, for one second, think that he is leaving willingly or peacefully.  #
All of our intelligence agencies proved Russia interfered or attempted to interfere with the 2016 election in favor of #trump. They gained access to our voting machines. Yet, here you are fear mongering #MailInBallots and accusing Democrats of a future crime based on what Intel?

Now. you are an open minded voter. We need more people like that. I would also not vote for a dangerous and ignorant fool like Trump even if he was in my party. Patriots vote for a candidate who puts country over his own interests. That is essential qualification for a leader.

Stop normalizing Trump‚Äôs call to delay the election. Are remotely aware how unconstitutional and dangerous this is? This is full blown Fascism and Blitzer is talking like it‚Äôs a legitimate idea! Holy shit, guy. This is NOT normal.
The pattern is the Democrats are mocking the death fellow human beings while denying them access to simple drugs like hydroxychloroquine/chloroquine which have been proven safe and effective at treating covid-19. The pattern is Dems are evil &amp; exploding a pandemic to oust Trump
I believe that‚Äôs the point Trump is trying to make Dan. Support having fair elections, no mail in voting changes this close to the elections.
You way overestimate American's feelings about Obama.  He was the most divisive president since before the Civil War.  He has no power anymore and no relevance.  Trump IS the thunder.
I'm thrilled about the president's tweet.  Dems intend to use a virus with a death rate 1/10th the death rate of the flu to conduct mass vote fraud in conjunction with foreign countries.  We are under a state of national emergency &amp; Trump must use his power to delay the election.

Donald Trump is not just unfit, he is clinically insane and dangerous. At what point does someone, anyone, invoke the #25thAmendmentNow

I see that you haven‚Äôt read one bill or executive order that President Trump signed. Too lazy to debate with me.
I find it odd that he continues to call it the China Virus and China hasn't pulled Ivanka's Trademarks.  What's the connection?  Trump sold out Americans &amp; Democracy for trademarks?    Carried out Putin (&amp; Xi's) plan to destroy democracy. Create chaos &amp; division!
Golly gee willikers. Look what happens when the GOP actually gives him the merest of push backs.  They could control him if they wanted to.
So it's not necessarily that you want to vote for Biden but because of how you feel toward Trump?
Republicans may be trying to hide bad poll numbers from Trump by simply not asking about him
George you can accuse Trump of anything Right ?
Trump goes around saying "China Virus" the way a little child says naughty words to get negative attention. Saying that I still can't believe he said it in this context. He can't be dignified for a second.
This tweet represents how angry and frustrated most of us are when we watch Trump on TV. To stay sane I turn him off before I kick the screen.

Not everything is some master distraction plan, y'all give Trump's brain a lot more credit than it deserves. A sitting president who's already taken multiple autocratic actions talking about postponing a national election is pretty huge and scary news even if its unsurprising

We're under a state of national emergency.  So under Directive 51, Trump can delay the election.  And he should.  We can't have mail-in voting with its mass vote fraud.

The reason trump let him in the front for so long. If trump said he was not good and a clown, left would fight for him much more than they are. By letting him get in front of cameras, Fauci himself is proving the idiot he is and deep state shill, money hack he is.
Herman Cain dying from covid, previously attending a trump rally and refusing to wear a mask is the exact fate I'm hoping for all these out of control trumpsters. I said what the fuck I said.
How can any moral person vote for trump?
On the other hand, Trump himself could have prevented all of this by just fully embracing the science, doing all his rallies by Zoom, telling people to shelter in place to save his beautiful economy, and selling MAGA and KAG branded masks.  Cain would have lived then.
Sorry. Trump hurts Trump. He has failed at everything he touches. Couldn‚Äôt even take his own SATs.

Trump is back with that bullshit that Democrats don't love America!!!  The traitor who doesn't care if our U.S. Troops have bounties on their heads because he wants to be Vladimir Putin. What a dangerous nutjob!

He is the leader of the White Supremacists in the United States of America.  I mean, who can the rich white people flaunt their wealth and amazingness in front of if there isn't dirty, filty, poor people, begging them to throw them a crumb. Trump's USA..

Your secret is out so you can come out of the closet because most of us already know you‚Äôre a Trump supporter. You demonize Democrats and are willing to let Trump take over our country and indefinitely because Democrats are not bending to your every want. You‚Äôre just plain evil!!

Trump said. ‚ÄúYou work on the payments for the people, and the rest of it we're so far apart we don't care. We really don't care.‚Äù  This is the perfect quote that nails the priorities of Mr. Trump. Give people money, put my name on it, and to hell with everything else.

Trump is not a suburbanite and doesn't know a thing about suburbanites.  Most of us WANT our communities to be inclusive, diverse, and affordable. It's one of the reasons the GOP keeps losing the suburban vote by more and more each year.

And Trump only won by 306 (not counting the two faithless electors who bolted from him.)  306 - 38 = 268 = Losing the Electoral College."Until recently, I had taken as political hyperbole the Democrats‚Äô assertion that President Trump is a fascist. But this latest tweet is fascistic and is itself grounds for the president‚Äôs immediate impeachment again ... and his removal from office"

I think we all seen that coming.   Herman Cain May very well caught Covid at a Trump rally as well as at Walmart.   Bottom line is Herman Cain made decisions on where and when he would go somewhere and knew the risks associated with his travels.
A vote for joe is a vote for socialism! Vote Trump and conservative Republicans only!

We will not fall for the Trump con
This, coupled with his earlier abandonment of #Michigan bodes ill for Trump's campaign. Or maybe he's using reverse psychology. If he pulls his ads, maybe we'll miss him and love him again. Or, he knows he's going to lose and he wants to walk out with as much cash as possible.

Funny that you think I don't do research. I ain't for Trump. A lot of people in this country have a higher level of intelligence than he does. A lot of people KNOW BETTER.  Trump is enabling the cops to be violent which is why people are pissed. Have you been paying attention?

There's legal and moral responsibility. #HermanCain ultimately made the decision to tempt fate and attend Trump's rally. It stands to reason that's where he was infected. But it was Trump, who for political self-preservation, summoned his "friend" to #Tulsa and to an early grave.
That is fair. I see no problem with that. But I feel like twitter causes people to sometimes have visceral reactions to other wise ordinary situations. I am a liberal, but regardless of what I think Trump is president. Who am I to hate people that want to meet the president...

Lol! There's more photos of Trump and Malaria with her and Epstein than Clinton, but you keep that ideology going. If he goes down, fine, but sure as hell Trump &amp; mail order bride will too if it gets to that point.
Trump will admit his whole presidency was just a joke and he didn‚Äôt understand why we took it all so seriously. He was just out for $hits and giggles.

True, however, if a state with a trump supporting governor refuses to hold an election, the justice department would be the only enforcement mechanism. Since it won‚Äôt do anything, we have a fallback as is stated above. There are still ways he can prevent people from voting though

FAKE NEWS. But, it's anti-Trump, so Twitter won't do a fuckin thing will they? Meanwhile  gets put in timeout for reiterating something a medical professional stated in a press conference. Shocking..

Thank you to the past administration for the wall
Nice idea, but you don't just open your doors at full capacity. Thats why we have a advertising/mktg budget. Of course this shutdown is why so many co's will not be able to reopen - period. The pipeline is empty, the referrals gone. It can be rebuilt but how long to scale?
Really weird that Trump doesn't enforce mask at his rallies. He's literally killing the few voters he has left

GOP governors mostly stuck to Trump's approach to #COVID. Democratic governors mostly went with the most extreme lockdowns. Guess which states have the highest death rate? Democratic states have more than double the death rate from #COVID

Are you as concerned about Donald Trump‚Äôs assault on our democracy? It‚Äôs hard to take your expressions of concern seriously given the NV GOP radio silence regarding his lawless actions and life-threatening incompetence related to COVID.
Too coincidental &amp; right after the impeachment fails... who the hell knows what they have in store next?  Something big, I‚Äôm sure.  It‚Äôs scary.  We‚Äôre sitting ducks.  I think they thought even Trump supporters would be tired of the chaos, but it only made me a stronger supporter.
Of course - TRUMP‚Äôs Plan is to SABOTAGE the USPS and suppress our VOTES!!!

While Trump tries to distract us from the bad economic report that came out this morning you should know the facts: (1) The president does not have the authority to change the date of the election. (2) #VoteByMail has been proven to be secure &amp; accessible.
Confirmation of what many of us suspected: in the early days of the pandemic‚Äîand probably still now‚Äîif you lived in a blue state Donald Trump didn't think you were worth saving. #TrumpVirus #TrumpFailedAmerica #LockHimUp
How are those unemployment numbers? How‚Äôs the GDP? How‚Äôs the death toll from the Trump Virus? Stop drinking bleach, it‚Äôs messing with your already limited intelligence
FACT: President Trump cannot postpone, delay, or cancel the election. Election Day is set by act of Congress and only Congress can change the date.
President Trump is trying to confuse people about his powers on the timing of the election. The facts are clear: the president does not have the constitutional authority to move or delay the election. We follow the Constitution, not Trump's tweets
Hahahahaha!!!!!  You think that because trump killed Herman Cain there‚Äôs going to be a civil war?  Hahahahaha!!!!!  You people are funny
When it comes to Trump you can never says it is "the dumbest thing I have ever heard' - Trump will always trump his last dumb action guaranteed.

TRUMP is DELIBERATELY sabotaging the USPS!  TRUMP is DISPARAGING MAIL-IN BALLOTS!  Because VOTERS won‚Äôt need POLLING STATIONS - that REPUBLICANS love to close!  VOTERS won‚Äôt need time off work or have to wait in LONG LINES!  REPUBLICANS can‚Äôt CORRUPT the VOTING MACHINES!
When Trump says he's put America first, keep in mind his defense for his perfect call with Ukraine was that 'he' meant America. So when he says that, he means him first. Every single act by him for the last three and a half years has proven that.
absolutely right joe... he should not be the president‚Äôs ‚Äúwing man‚Äù  oops... my bad... that was eric holder who said that:/   democrats are clowns ü§°   TRUMP 2020!!! üá∫üá∏üáµüá∑
Let's get Trump out of office now.  time for you to have "the talk" w/  &amp; explain to him why he must resign immediately. Trump has lost it before, but right now he is self destructing &amp; actually showing how racist, unfit, &amp; incompetent he is.
His blood is on Trump‚Äôs tiny hands.
Finally, Trump says something that I can consider the truth.
Joe Biden has a pretty long list of accomplishments, lol.  The only thing Trump has over Biden is the presidency, as Biden has never been President
100% agree with your sentiment.  Nobody who wants Trump out (like I do, passionately) should get complacent about this regardless of published polling or odds.
Its only convenient now that the Democrats realized people don't like riots and Trump is gaining popularity points.
This is why big business, the establishment, the derp state and the corrupt politicians all in cahoots, hate Trump. Cause he has the brass balls to do what no other weak politician would do.  #MAGA2020Landslide

Where are the female reporters Alcindor, Reid and Wei.  These softball questions by these men are fragile.  These women put Trump on blast.  Maybe they are there and he avoids them for the 5 questions he allows.  His bragging is revealing; he's in another time dimension.

FACT: President Trump cannot postpone, delay, or cancel the election. Election Day is set by act of Congress and only Congress can change the date.
The Great Depression was created by a 15% decrease in the US economy.  The 2d quarter of 2020 experienced a massive 33% decline; twice as bad.  40 million people lost their jobs.  At the same time, 152,000 people died due to COVID-19. The Trump Depression?
Proof #Trump is a racist. He killed his only black supporter.
Not sure what you mean.  The odds of Biden winning are currently much better than marginal.  Of course so much can change by November.   If you truly believe this, you should immediately get on a betting site and put big $ on Trump.  He‚Äôs a +150 dog right now.

Ok I'm not going to read any responses but my guess is they are all anti Trump... let's see how rite I am.........
Haha. Trump will cure the plandemic. Smart move!!! Watch the numbers lowering into nothingness :)))
From what I've seen, I'm not sure he ever went. Maybe Trump's entire school records were "Fake Education".

So Trump wants to move the election from Nov. to some other unknown date to protect from ‚Äúfraudulent mail in ballots‚Äù, but he votes by mail himself.  Takes a vote to do it and the answer is no wannabe dictator Trump.  In other news, Kelly Ann Conway wants Christmas moved to May.
I don't think Calabresi saw the ??? on Trump's tweet. He didn't call for anything.
Great job chuck since trump says he wants bigger stimulus checks for americans get more for us then 1200. And the countless americans suffering and grieving during this virus
You don't know that. Herman Cain another Republican was at Trump's Tulsa, Oklahoma rally two weeks later he's in the hospital. He died today from the Coronavirus. He wasn't wearing a mask. Coronavirus is a equal opportunity killer. No matter your race or age
Been thinking. I see others saying Trump won't leave office  peacefully, but I can't imagine him staying after the he loses the election. That would give Pence &amp; congress time to do a lot of damage during the lame duck, no?
Trump doesn‚Äôt have that much power. God decides when a person takes their LAST Breath!!!

I agree. And yet, I spent two days trying to explain how he was not credible to ardent trump followers. It was a huge waste of time. They are convinced we are the ones with our heads in the sand, and just refuse to think we've looked into it objectively. It's frustrating.
They want to replace Trump because he‚Äôs going to get crushed in November. It‚Äôs not a good faith realization.
Because of the fact that Trump refuses to question Putin about the claim of him paying Talibans for killing American Soldiers, I don't understand how so many military people still support him. Don't you Military people care?   via
What would Trump gain by delaying an election?
The Republicans in the House and Senate are just as guilty as trump...should we assume you're voting for Democrats for Congress as well?
Big f.....g deal. Barr is as corrupt as Trump and the whole country knows it by now, not to mention the most incompetent and out of touch president in the history of US.
His paranoia. This tells me he thinks Trump is gonna lose
Having a safety net is such a bad thing. You like Trump cuz he keeps ‚Äúminorities‚Äù in line. You want the republic or democracy to die so Trump can be leader for life. We are gonna become Russia people like you‚Äôs biggest fear. I‚Äôm educated I see a Nazi when I see one. Trumps Hitler

Good. Lewis disrespected Trump and Bush but Trump is not a hypocrite like Bush
Look up Bills &amp; Executive Orders that President Trump has signed. There‚Äôs lots of them &amp; he‚Äôs signing more.
"Trump Might Try to Postpone the Election. That‚Äôs Unconstitutional."  "He should be removed unless he relents."  Here we go again with the NYT and its liberal op-ed writers.
Trump has come to realize that he cannot defeat Biden. He's grabbing at straws, seeking a way to stay in power.
We never had a fraud con man fascist putin puppet like trump either. My point is consider the source and dump trump 2020 before he causes more damage.
0.00005% This is the percentage of fraudulent mailed in ballots according to an MIT study that looked at HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS of votes spanning DECADES. Trump is full of shit. He knows he is losing and he's looking for excuses and justification to challenge the election results.
I listened to President Obama give a eulogy for John Lewis today. I hung onto his every word. I find it very difficult to listen to Trump. He sounds so ignorant and repetitive.    via
Dude- He died because he was a fool who belittled, like 45 himself, the COVID guidelines of Trump‚Äôs WH. He was extremely irresponsible which, in turn, put his entire family and close associates at risk. This is the cost of the conspiracy theories endorsed by conservative media üëé
My 5 year old student said this to me today:   ‚ÄúMs. Ashley, do you know who the worst president is especially during this time? Donald Trump because he‚Äôs careless and doesn‚Äôt care about us!‚Äù
Why does the left hate Trump? Because he's not a long term politician who is a member of the insiders club. No one owns him. They can't control him. He's a threat to their power, status quo &amp; wealth. Why else would they lie &amp; cheat for the world to see just before the election?
If Donald Trump thinks we can move the election back, what‚Äôs stopping us from moving the election up?   I‚Äôd gladly vote his ass out of office in August; there‚Äôs no need to wait until November.
Another number pulled out of an ass.  You want schools to open because Trump thinks it will help his chances in an election he knows he is losing. Shut up and sit down.
tRump does not nor did he ever Care about the Military #TraitorTrump
This is an honest competent poll that weights sample to Census Bureau data on 2016 turnout.  However, it's been shown that CB data undersamples GOP demographics by 2-3 pts.  Reality is more like Trump 50%, Biden 45%.
The fact that you can‚Äôt see the threat to our democracy is scary but I bet you think single payer health care is evil. You are part of the problem. Trump wants to destroy America he wants to be Putin.
And you think he did that willingly? You dont think Trump, who could fire him at any moment, had or has a muzzle on him and controls what he does or does not say? We've already seen Trump fire cabinet members for disagreeing with him.
Cain was photographed at TRUMP‚Äôs FAILED TULSA RALLY!  NO mask NO social distancing  Cain KNEW the risks! Cain paid the price I‚Äôd listen to TRUMP and NOT common sense!!!  There are 150,000+ DEAD AMERICANS because TRUMP did NOT listen!!!
is Trump's tweet about delaying elections cool with you?
That's what Trump wants. He wants to sow doubt about the election. Making it an all mail in election plays to him.   We should put on masks, social distance, and go to the polls to vote whenever possible.   Whoever wins should win with as little doubt as possible.
#Trump Nobody likes you and nobody wants you to be president.  Stop messing with the #USPS, the #election2020 and the #AmericanPeople.  WE have the power, and we will NOT tolerate any more of your nonsense.
If we hold off we will never vote again don‚Äôt underestimate Trump he wants to be a dictator
John Prine was one of the first celebrities to die. He was no trump supporter
It has nothing to do with Trump. I agree with your first statement. The person you are replying to says they are a leftist in their bio. Maybe wrong thread?
Next week Biden announces his VP pick.  Hoping it's Kamala Harris.  She is awesome and won't take any crap for trump and his loonies.
Trump -vs-  Whoever they get to run the country if Joe wins.
Are you really that blind to the political environment right now that you don't think making sure the presidential election is as doubt free as possible should be uppermost in everyone's mind?  Doubt is pernicious. We all should not want to give Trump any toehold to that.
He just now realized?  Either this brilliant man is a complete moron, or this is just the continued baby step distancing of the GOP from Trump.
You still can read any bills or executive orders signed by President trump. So who‚Äôs the cop out? Not me.
Correct. Trump is so incompetent that they think competence, speaking above an elementary level, and believing science makes you the greatest president ever.

It's clear Trump has no intention of leaving office even if he loses in a landslide (which looks likely). His plan is to use the military to terrorize US citizens that don't agree with him. This is an attack on the very existence of the US. He should be removed him from office.
This is what Mr. Calabresi is really concerned with. He doesn't want to risk Nancy Pelosi becoming president. He'd rather see Trump impeached and Pence take over than risk a Pelosi presidency.
Wrong. The Cato Institute did a poll last week which said 62 percent of Americans will not disclose who they support for fear of retribution. Translation: there are more voters voting for Trump than their are voting for Biden.
Rep. John Lewis devoted his life to fighting for the right to vote and Trump has devoted his presidency to waging war on it.
This is literally the dumbest thing I've read today, and I've read all of tRump's tweets.
I have made it my duty to blast FDT any time I can be anywhere near a car with a trump sticker, today was at sonic üòÇ
What Trump is saying is "if I don't win then the election is rigged and invalid."   Don't, for one second, think that he is leaving willingly or peacefully.  #
All of our intelligence agencies proved Russia interfered or attempted to interfere with the 2016 election in favor of #trump. They gained access to our voting machines. Yet, here you are fear mongering #MailInBallots and accusing Democrats of a future crime based on what Intel?

Now. you are an open minded voter. We need more people like that. I would also not vote for a dangerous and ignorant fool like Trump even if he was in my party. Patriots vote for a candidate who puts country over his own interests. That is essential qualification for a leader.
You need to use the term.. President! When speaking about‚ÄùMr. Trump‚Äù.

Stop normalizing Trump‚Äôs call to delay the election. Are remotely aware how unconstitutional and dangerous this is? This is full blown Fascism and Blitzer is talking like it‚Äôs a legitimate idea! Holy shit, guy. This is NOT normal.
I believe that‚Äôs the point Trump is trying to make Dan. Support having fair elections, no mail in voting changes this close to the elections.
You way overestimate American's feelings about Obama.  He was the most divisive president since before the Civil War.  He has no power anymore and no relevance.  Trump IS the thunder.
I'm thrilled about the president's tweet.  Dems intend to use a virus with a death rate 1/10th the death rate of the flu to conduct mass vote fraud in conjunction with foreign countries.  We are under a state of national emergency &amp; Trump must use his power to delay the election.
Makes you wonder what Trump and Putin has on Miss Thang!!!
Donald Trump is not just unfit, he is clinically insane and dangerous. At what point does someone, anyone, invoke the #25thAmendmentNow

Another one too dumb to get it. The trump administration is the one mimicking the movie. YOU GUYS are the ones doing it. How funny to make fun of a movie reference, when you are the one displaying the ridiculous behavior. üòÇ
I see that you haven‚Äôt read one bill or executive order that President Trump signed. Too lazy to debate with me.
I find it odd that he continues to call it the China Virus and China hasn't pulled Ivanka's Trademarks.  What's the connection?  Trump sold out Americans &amp; Democracy for trademarks?    Carried out Putin (&amp; Xi's) plan to destroy democracy. Create chaos &amp; division!
Golly gee willikers. Look what happens when the GOP actually gives him the merest of push backs.  They could control him if they wanted to.
So it's not necessarily that you want to vote for Biden but because of how you feel toward Trump?
Republicans may be trying to hide bad poll numbers from Trump by simply not asking about him
George you can accuse Trump of anything Right ?
Trump goes around saying "China Virus" the way a little child says naughty words to get negative attention. Saying that I still can't believe he said it in this context. He can't be dignified for a second.
This tweet represents how angry and frustrated most of us are when we watch Trump on TV. To stay sane I turn him off before I kick the screen.

Not everything is some master distraction plan, y'all give Trump's brain a lot more credit than it deserves. A sitting president who's already taken multiple autocratic actions talking about postponing a national election is pretty huge and scary news even if its unsurprising

We're under a state of national emergency.  So under Directive 51, Trump can delay the election.  And he should.  We can't have mail-in voting with its mass vote fraud.

It would be a good idea if all of you started taking it! You gonna own the libs like no other! Cmon! President trump is counting on you... take it ;)
trump must go. He is not your president, he is your master!
You use the MAGA mantra ‚Äúfake news.‚Äù NBC isn‚Äôt out to make Trump look bad. Nor good. They report what‚Äôs happening.  What‚Äôs happening is this president is destroying everything our country has been built upon. Do you even read US news reports from outside the US? They pity us.
I don‚Äôt even know what to say to this. The middle lost the left awhile ago, Trump certainly doesn‚Äôt have the middle, and why won‚Äôt Tesla pay more taxes in the communities where the plants are? Is that too leftist an ideal?
We need to delay elections until we can be sure elections are secure, says the party that delayed any and all election security legislation.
Hey Bill:  Trump should not suggest that the election be delayed. OMG, the Socialists and Fake News will go crazy for the next month.   It will be non stop TDS 7/24.   There will be no other news Fake or otherwise.  MJ

Trump is all that is saving us from the Pelosis of the world. She harvested 300 plus million off of USA while in office. She does 0 for taxpayers: She favors over running USA with illegals, taxing us  40% + to pay for them so she can buy their votes with welfare. .

The reason trump let him in the front for so long. If trump said he was not good and a clown, left would fight for him much more than they are. By letting him get in front of cameras, Fauci himself is proving the idiot he is and deep state shill, money hack he is.
Herman Cain dying from covid, previously attending a trump rally and refusing to wear a mask is the exact fate I'm hoping for all these out of control trumpsters. I said what the fuck I said.
How can any moral person vote for trump?
On the other hand, Trump himself could have prevented all of this by just fully embracing the science, doing all his rallies by Zoom, telling people to shelter in place to save his beautiful economy, and selling MAGA and KAG branded masks.  Cain would have lived then.
Sorry. Trump hurts Trump. He has failed at everything he touches. Couldn‚Äôt even take his own SATs.
I hope Dems don‚Äôt gloat or blame an invisible force like karma for Cain‚Äôs death. This death lies squarely with Trump

Hopefully Trump will be next.

True. There was no Deep State. Under Trump there is.
Who says we have to hear from a elected official only through official channels or the MSM. Trump's tweets are not for the elites they're for us. HE replies to us. Those living in the ivory tower of government are deaf to those of us in the trenches.  DJT isn't. And he responds.

Laughable...Trump has decimated China's ecomony and is forming an Easter bloc alliance with Poland and others to counter Russian reunification.  Mittens dits around making faces and acting like he's relevent.  #Mittsadouche
I think we all seen that coming.   Herman Cain May very well caught Covid at a Trump rally as well as at Walmart.   Bottom line is Herman Cain made decisions on where and when he would go somewhere and knew the risks associated with his travels.

We will not fall for the Trump con
This, coupled with his earlier abandonment of #Michigan bodes ill for Trump's campaign. Or maybe he's using reverse psychology. If he pulls his ads, maybe we'll miss him and love him again. Or, he knows he's going to lose and he wants to walk out with as much cash as possible.

There's legal and moral responsibility. #HermanCain ultimately made the decision to tempt fate and attend Trump's rally. It stands to reason that's where he was infected. But it was Trump, who for political self-preservation, summoned his "friend" to #Tulsa and to an early grave.
That is fair. I see no problem with that. But I feel like twitter causes people to sometimes have visceral reactions to other wise ordinary situations. I am a liberal, but regardless of what I think Trump is president. Who am I to hate people that want to meet the president...

Just stop. They don‚Äôt understand anything unless Trump lies to them. Facts doesn‚Äôt process for them. The founder of the GOP in the biggest war in our country the civil war didn‚Äôt stop the election. A real wartime president has never moved the date. Why start now.
Trump walks back election delay and successfully  buries the real news that our GDP shrank 32%.  He buried the biggest economic drop in history and  you all fell for it.
Should be OUTRAGED at GOP politicians for not removing Trump from office. They let Trump cause Mass deaths in America. We must Protest GOP politicians to remove Trump from office immediately!
Republican party politicians is complicit spineless cowards they're weak they don't deserve to run the Senate, we must Vote them Out. #TrumpVirusKills150K killed Herman Cain and thousands more people. Trump could have lead people and saved thousands of people lives. People
I would respect Pence more if he resigned as soon as possible. I don't think Trump likes Pence and there's a chance he might replace him on the ticket with Nikki Haley.

Trump will admit his whole presidency was just a joke and he didn‚Äôt understand why we took it all so seriously. He was just out for $hits and giggles.

True, however, if a state with a trump supporting governor refuses to hold an election, the justice department would be the only enforcement mechanism. Since it won‚Äôt do anything, we have a fallback as is stated above. There are still ways he can prevent people from voting though
If more Republicans speak out like we saw today after trumps election postpone BS...  As a former Republican I can guarantee their future in their job will become more important than trump, fox is about survival in the end.

I think Trump just hit the nerve of the Dems wanting mail-in ballots. It might take so long to get it ballot count that Dems would claim while we are waiting that Trump is not the legitimately elected President.

FAKE NEWS. But, it's anti-Trump, so Twitter won't do a fuckin thing will they? Meanwhile  gets put in timeout for reiterating something a medical professional stated in a press conference. Shocking..

So, they are aware of the crime and death being perpetrated by Trump's bungling incompetence.  They just aren't sure if they'll vote for the guy responsible for 150K+ (and counting) deaths  OR  The guy who will effectively combat it.  Choose.
The real tale to be told here is how much Trump will be able to screw over the incoming Democrats with his remaining 2.5 months and total lack of cooperation on the transition
Thank you to the past administration for the wall
Nice idea, but you don't just open your doors at full capacity. Thats why we have a advertising/mktg budget. Of course this shutdown is why so many co's will not be able to reopen - period. The pipeline is empty, the referrals gone. It can be rebuilt but how long to scale?
Really weird that Trump doesn't enforce mask at his rallies. He's literally killing the few voters he has left

Are you as concerned about Donald Trump‚Äôs assault on our democracy? It‚Äôs hard to take your expressions of concern seriously given the NV GOP radio silence regarding his lawless actions and life-threatening incompetence related to COVID.
Too coincidental &amp; right after the impeachment fails... who the hell knows what they have in store next?  Something big, I‚Äôm sure.  It‚Äôs scary.  We‚Äôre sitting ducks.  I think they thought even Trump supporters would be tired of the chaos, but it only made me a stronger supporter.

While Trump tries to distract us from the bad economic report that came out this morning you should know the facts: (1) The president does not have the authority to change the date of the election. (2) #VoteByMail has been proven to be secure &amp; accessible.
Confirmation of what many of us suspected: in the early days of the pandemic‚Äîand probably still now‚Äîif you lived in a blue state Donald Trump didn't think you were worth saving. #TrumpVirus #TrumpFailedAmerica #LockHimUp
How are those unemployment numbers? How‚Äôs the GDP? How‚Äôs the death toll from the Trump Virus? Stop drinking bleach, it‚Äôs messing with your already limited intelligence
FACT: President Trump cannot postpone, delay, or cancel the election. Election Day is set by act of Congress and only Congress can change the date.
President Trump is trying to confuse people about his powers on the timing of the election. The facts are clear: the president does not have the constitutional authority to move or delay the election. We follow the Constitution, not Trump's tweets

When Trump says he's put America first, keep in mind his defense for his perfect call with Ukraine was that 'he' meant America. So when he says that, he means him first. Every single act by him for the last three and a half years has proven that.

Finally, Trump says something that I can consider the truth.
Joe Biden has a pretty long list of accomplishments, lol.  The only thing Trump has over Biden is the presidency, as Biden has never been President
100% agree with your sentiment.  Nobody who wants Trump out (like I do, passionately) should get complacent about this regardless of published polling or odds.
Since Donald Trump wants to move the election back, let's start a #movetheelectionup  no need to wait until November!!
Its only convenient now that the Democrats realized people don't like riots and Trump is gaining popularity points.

So Trump wants to move the election from Nov. to some other unknown date to protect from ‚Äúfraudulent mail in ballots‚Äù, but he votes by mail himself.  Takes a vote to do it and the answer is no wannabe dictator Trump.  In other news, Kelly Ann Conway wants Christmas moved to May.
I don't think Calabresi saw the ??? on Trump's tweet. He didn't call for anything.
Great job chuck since trump says he wants bigger stimulus checks for americans get more for us then 1200. And the countless americans suffering and grieving during this virus
You don't know that. Herman Cain another Republican was at Trump's Tulsa, Oklahoma rally two weeks later he's in the hospital. He died today from the Coronavirus. He wasn't wearing a mask. Coronavirus is a equal opportunity killer. No matter your race or age
Been thinking. I see others saying Trump won't leave office  peacefully, but I can't imagine him staying after the he loses the election. That would give Pence &amp; congress time to do a lot of damage during the lame duck, no?
Trump doesn‚Äôt have that much power. God decides when a person takes their LAST Breath!!!

I agree. And yet, I spent two days trying to explain how he was not credible to ardent trump followers. It was a huge waste of time. They are convinced we are the ones with our heads in the sand, and just refuse to think we've looked into it objectively. It's frustrating.
This nothing more but a Biden flip of you ain‚Äôt black if you don‚Äôt know to vote for Biden  I‚Äôm not Christian enough if I vote for Trump?  Total BS and already used  Find yourself new material or set down and shut up
And for the record more civilians killed in drone strikes than under other Presidents. I‚Äôm sure there is corruption on both sides, all levels. Trump is even worse so don‚Äôt start that convo.

Because she would have to actually work. Trump pass the buck hacky.

Ok. Well good luck. Trump wins we may not make it to a 2024 election. Or if we do, the system will be so rigged that Republicans will run the country with a 40% plurality. Trump will get worse, not better.
Does anyone else think that Putin could wake up one morning and decide to just slap a black, spiked dog-collar on Donald Trump and force him to walk down Main Street on all fours, barking vile obscenities in Russian? I mean, if he really wanted to, he could, right? #PutinsPuppet
America‚Äôs second civil war will begins Nov 5/20 after President Donald Trump wins the Federal election in a landslide. The cucks will start the war. There will be liberal progressive cucks killed by the hundreds of thousands per week until every last one of them is eradicated.

Good. Lewis disrespected Trump and Bush but Trump is not a hypocrite like Bush
Look up Bills &amp; Executive Orders that President Trump has signed. There‚Äôs lots of them &amp; he‚Äôs signing more.
"Trump Might Try to Postpone the Election. That‚Äôs Unconstitutional."  "He should be removed unless he relents."  Here we go again with the NYT and its liberal op-ed writers.
Trump has come to realize that he cannot defeat Biden. He's grabbing at straws, seeking a way to stay in power.
We never had a fraud con man fascist putin puppet like trump either. My point is consider the source and dump trump 2020 before he causes more damage.
0.00005% This is the percentage of fraudulent mailed in ballots according to an MIT study that looked at HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS of votes spanning DECADES. Trump is full of shit. He knows he is losing and he's looking for excuses and justification to challenge the election results.
I listened to President Obama give a eulogy for John Lewis today. I hung onto his every word. I find it very difficult to listen to Trump. He sounds so ignorant and repetitive.    via
Dude- He died because he was a fool who belittled, like 45 himself, the COVID guidelines of Trump‚Äôs WH. He was extremely irresponsible which, in turn, put his entire family and close associates at risk. This is the cost of the conspiracy theories endorsed by conservative media üëé
My 5 year old student said this to me today:   ‚ÄúMs. Ashley, do you know who the worst president is especially during this time? Donald Trump because he‚Äôs careless and doesn‚Äôt care about us!‚Äù
Why does the left hate Trump? Because he's not a long term politician who is a member of the insiders club. No one owns him. They can't control him. He's a threat to their power, status quo &amp; wealth. Why else would they lie &amp; cheat for the world to see just before the election?
If Donald Trump thinks we can move the election back, what‚Äôs stopping us from moving the election up?   I‚Äôd gladly vote his ass out of office in August; there‚Äôs no need to wait until November.
Another number pulled out of an ass.  You want schools to open because Trump thinks it will help his chances in an election he knows he is losing. Shut up and sit down.
tRump does not nor did he ever Care about the Military #TraitorTrump
This is an honest competent poll that weights sample to Census Bureau data on 2016 turnout.  However, it's been shown that CB data undersamples GOP demographics by 2-3 pts.  Reality is more like Trump 50%, Biden 45%.
The fact that you can‚Äôt see the threat to our democracy is scary but I bet you think single payer health care is evil. You are part of the problem. Trump wants to destroy America he wants to be Putin.
And you think he did that willingly? You dont think Trump, who could fire him at any moment, had or has a muzzle on him and controls what he does or does not say? We've already seen Trump fire cabinet members for disagreeing with him.
Cain was photographed at TRUMP‚Äôs FAILED TULSA RALLY!  NO mask NO social distancing  Cain KNEW the risks! Cain paid the price I‚Äôd listen to TRUMP and NOT common sense!!!  There are 150,000+ DEAD AMERICANS because TRUMP did NOT listen!!!
is Trump's tweet about delaying elections cool with you?
That's what Trump wants. He wants to sow doubt about the election. Making it an all mail in election plays to him.   We should put on masks, social distance, and go to the polls to vote whenever possible.   Whoever wins should win with as little doubt as possible.
#Trump Nobody likes you and nobody wants you to be president.  Stop messing with the #USPS, the #election2020 and the #AmericanPeople.  WE have the power, and we will NOT tolerate any more of your nonsense.
If we hold off we will never vote again don‚Äôt underestimate Trump he wants to be a dictator
John Prine was one of the first celebrities to die. He was no trump supporter
It has nothing to do with Trump. I agree with your first statement. The person you are replying to says they are a leftist in their bio. Maybe wrong thread?
Next week Biden announces his VP pick.  Hoping it's Kamala Harris.  She is awesome and won't take any crap for trump and his loonies.
Trump -vs-  Whoever they get to run the country if Joe wins.
the Democratic party screwed you out of your nomination but it wouldn't have mattered any way because the American people see through the Democratic party &amp; how they're willing to destroy America just to get in the White House which is why Trump will be re-elected in a landslide
Are you really that blind to the political environment right now that you don't think making sure the presidential election is as doubt free as possible should be uppermost in everyone's mind?  Doubt is pernicious. We all should not want to give Trump any toehold to that.
He just now realized?  Either this brilliant man is a complete moron, or this is just the continued baby step distancing of the GOP from Trump.
You still can read any bills or executive orders signed by President trump. So who‚Äôs the cop out? Not me.
Correct. Trump is so incompetent that they think competence, speaking above an elementary level, and believing science makes you the greatest president ever.
you'd think he'd chill on the Dr Trump stuff...

The Memo: Trump's real target is election's legitimacy
It's clear Trump has no intention of leaving office even if he loses in a landslide (which looks likely). His plan is to use the military to terrorize US citizens that don't agree with him. This is an attack on the very existence of the US. He should be removed him from office.
This is what Mr. Calabresi is really concerned with. He doesn't want to risk Nancy Pelosi becoming president. He'd rather see Trump impeached and Pence take over than risk a Pelosi presidency.
Wrong. The Cato Institute did a poll last week which said 62 percent of Americans will not disclose who they support for fear of retribution. Translation: there are more voters voting for Trump than their are voting for Biden.
Par for the course. No sense of decorum with Trump. He is a walking talking living breathing disgrace to the Presidency of the United States. No respect for anything and clearly out of his depth as President of the United States.
Rep. John Lewis devoted his life to fighting for the right to vote and Trump has devoted his presidency to waging war on it.
This is literally the dumbest thing I've read today, and I've read all of tRump's tweets.
I have made it my duty to blast FDT any time I can be anywhere near a car with a trump sticker, today was at sonic üòÇ

You need to use the term.. President! When speaking about‚ÄùMr. Trump‚Äù.

Stop normalizing Trump‚Äôs call to delay the election. Are remotely aware how unconstitutional and dangerous this is? This is full blown Fascism and Blitzer is talking like it‚Äôs a legitimate idea! Holy shit, guy. This is NOT normal.
The pattern is the Democrats are mocking the death fellow human beings while denying them access to simple drugs like hydroxychloroquine/chloroquine which have been proven safe and effective at treating covid-19. The pattern is Dems are evil &amp; exploding a pandemic to oust Trump
I believe that‚Äôs the point Trump is trying to make Dan. Support having fair elections, no mail in voting changes this close to the elections.
You way overestimate American's feelings about Obama.  He was the most divisive president since before the Civil War.  He has no power anymore and no relevance.  Trump IS the thunder.
I'm thrilled about the president's tweet.  Dems intend to use a virus with a death rate 1/10th the death rate of the flu to conduct mass vote fraud in conjunction with foreign countries.  We are under a state of national emergency &amp; Trump must use his power to delay the election.
Makes you wonder what Trump and Putin has on Miss Thang!!!
Donald Trump is not just unfit, he is clinically insane and dangerous. At what point does someone, anyone, invoke the #25thAmendmentNow
That‚Äôs great Marco but as you‚Äôre well aware, Trump‚Äôs policy is whatever whim he has this week and he has signaled a willingness to negotiate with Maduro. #SpinelessGOP #Biden2020

Actually, you‚Äôre a hack Alice. If it wasn‚Äôt CBS, it would be CNN and so on. Anyone who things Trump is a complete hack.
Another one too dumb to get it. The trump administration is the one mimicking the movie. YOU GUYS are the ones doing it. How funny to make fun of a movie reference, when you are the one displaying the ridiculous behavior. üòÇ
I see that you haven‚Äôt read one bill or executive order that President Trump signed. Too lazy to debate with me.
I find it odd that he continues to call it the China Virus and China hasn't pulled Ivanka's Trademarks.  What's the connection?  Trump sold out Americans &amp; Democracy for trademarks?    Carried out Putin (&amp; Xi's) plan to destroy democracy. Create chaos &amp; division!
Golly gee willikers. Look what happens when the GOP actually gives him the merest of push backs.  They could control him if they wanted to.
So it's not necessarily that you want to vote for Biden but because of how you feel toward Trump?
Republicans may be trying to hide bad poll numbers from Trump by simply not asking about him
George you can accuse Trump of anything Right ?
Trump goes around saying "China Virus" the way a little child says naughty words to get negative attention. Saying that I still can't believe he said it in this context. He can't be dignified for a second.
This tweet represents how angry and frustrated most of us are when we watch Trump on TV. To stay sane I turn him off before I kick the screen.
Starving to death if Trump steals the election again
Trump proposes delay federal elections until it's 'safe'‚Äîsomething he doesn't have the power to do

FOCUS: Trump Floats Whether to 'Delay the Election,' Something He Cannot Legally Do
Trump declares Fox News unwatchable
When it comes to the protests in Oregon, Pres. Trump said, Homeland Security has done a fantastic job &amp; that "Portland was just a disaster." He said they went there &amp; saved a federal courthouse. He says the governor of Oregon &amp; Mayor or Portland don't know what they are doing.
Not everything is some master distraction plan, y'all give Trump's brain a lot more credit than it deserves. A sitting president who's already taken multiple autocratic actions talking about postponing a national election is pretty huge and scary news even if its unsurprising
A trump
We're under a state of national emergency.  So under Directive 51, Trump can delay the election.  And he should.  We can't have mail-in voting with its mass vote fraud.

Their fate, like Trump's, has been deeply affected by their collective incompetence in handling the COVID-19 pandemic
Chad you're saying Trump can?  He can't even read a sentence that someone else has put together. No 1 in what class at what school. He disproves that everytime he speaks into a microphone.
Trump starts COVID-19 briefing by remembering #HermanCaine. "Expressing our sadness at the passing of a wonderful man &amp; a dear friend of mine, Herman Caine. He was a very special man &amp; I got to know him very well. Unfortunately he passed away from a thing called the China Virus."

More Trump disinformation.
Democrats and China are not going to be allowed to commit mass vote fraud with mail-in voting.  We're under a state of emergency because of Covid and Trump may need to delay the election until people can vote in person.  He has that right under Directive 51.
Like rats from a sinking ship, they'll start running in droves, but we will never forget or forgive those who enabled Trump. There will be no public redemption for these cowards. They will be mocked and ridiculed until their dying days.
LoL, it's funny and sad that people think calling me out for having low followers is an insult, and means my posts have no merit or value. I mean, look at how many followers Trump has, and everything he says is garbage.

I think Trump resigns before Election Day.
He's nice enough to not call attention to your father's 32.9 % reduction of the US economy that was already in recession.  And 150,000 dead from COVID-19. And Trump's declining cognitive skills.  And what's with the face makeup?
In Trump delusional mind, he thinks he must be the center of attention.
Don‚Äôt vote for Biden he has done nothing for the USA. Vote Trump he has done more for the people than Biden &amp; Obama.
If Donald Trump thinks we can move the election back, what‚Äôs stopping us from moving the election up?  I‚Äôd gladly vote his ass out of office in August; there‚Äôs no need to wait until November.

Yes . Trump killed Herman Cain . It was a reckless homicide .
LOL Biden has been in the government for years has done nothing for you or the people of the USA. I know you researched all the bills &amp; executive orders that President Trump signed. More than Obama did in the 8 years he was president. Trump still signing more for us.
Trump knows how to get the dems riled up
What if Trump suggesting that the election be delayed is his way of making sure it DOESN'T get delayed? He just made it an unpopular idea by being the one to bring it up.

Absolutely.   Trump voters have a shockingly naive worldview that when the President says or does crazy stuff (Let‚Äôs Buy Greenland!) that the media has an obligation NOT to cover it  They blame the media for Trump‚Äôs lunacy while also demanding ‚Äú4 More Years!‚Äù of the dumpster fire
Half of Americans have gone insane and immeasurably stupid under President Trump, and it's their fault, not his.
It‚Äôs very predictable that the media will publicize the inevitable dead teachers.   Back in the old days, Trump used to be a master at manipulating the media. Now he‚Äôs a gullible imbecile making a series of unforced errors that guarantee bad coverage
All hell will break loose if his dumbass does
THIS is #trump's America! #VoteBlueToEndThisNightmare #VoteBiden2020
Except for Trump branded products, which are MADE IN CHINA!!!  #LincolnProject
...tho right, cuz THAT is what a PATHETIC EXCUSE for a JOURNALIST you are. Once we re elect Donald Trump for the next 4 yrs, we're going to start investigating the "investigative journalists". It's time to REALLY get the WHO'S WHO in American Journalism and find out EXACTLY...
SO MUCH B.S.! Any TRUE believer KNOWS the only way to vote is TRUMP. President Trump has been walking with God since the beginning and that walk continues to grow ever longer, and ever stronger. Wonder how long it took  to find someone stupid enough to vote for Pedo Joe?
Democrats LOVE spending OUR MONEY. An "investigation" now being done of the Justice Department by who? Horowitz ? Most likely. Wonder what he'll find? THAT'S RIGHT, NOTHING! He'll fing absolutely 0. The Trump Administration isn't stupid. The rule of law will be found to be up...
Yeah as a pioneer descendant I take exception! Trump‚Äôs Grandpa got kicked out of Bavaria after he escaped to dodge the draft during WWI and they didn‚Äôt want him back. And his dad was in the Klan! That‚Äôs not Pioneer stock.
Perhaps in the first few weeks of the pandemic, we could blame Trump‚Äôs covid failures on incompetence. But by July, Trump was proposing zero funding for testing &amp; tracing. The GOP‚Äôs silence while the President actively sabotages efforts to end the pandemic is unforgivable
There is is...TDS. I love my life as a housewife. I pity you that you don't. What will you be offended by next? What word will trigger you? Oh wait...you have for President Trump to say it first before you're triggered by it. Good grief, get over yourself.
No. I can‚Äôt forgive GOP Senators who voted to prevent witnesses from testifying at an impeachment trial. And when Trump fired inspectors general and sent secret police to Portland and called Jews ‚Äúdisloyal‚Äù and cut funding for covid testing, the rest of the GOP was silent...
whole damn campaign is a mess of chaos and corruption!  #TrumpCrimeFamily
For years we've seen story after story exposing  corruption! Do you want to live in #trump's fucked up America another 4 years? HELL NO! #VoteBidenToSaveAmerica2020
We bypassed the murder hornets and bubonic plague squirrels. Maybe we'll go the fake alien invasion next. The Left is so crazy, next they'll run in circles and stab themselves to spite Trump.

Trump is the sleaziest person ever! #TrumpSleaze #TrumpIsUnfitForOffice
Yeah... none of that disputes the fact that Trump was childishly trying to upstage Fauci by inviting a baseball player to a White House podium to talk about a pandemic (and announcing that Trump would be throwing out a pitch) on the same day that Fauci threw out a first pitch.
Exactly. Fauci was announced days ago. Which drove Trump nuts and caused Trump to invite a Yankee to the White House (to talk about a virus(?)) and then announce that he'd ALSO be throwing out a pitch.
Be careful  those wore Trump people.
1,000,000 new #TrumpVirus cases in 15 days!!!  This is trump's America!
Things Trump definitely had right in front of him during this interview from left to right: a person, a woman, a man, a camera and a TV.
Trump gave them a free pass to be honest he was probably in on it from the start
Trump should be be arrested
They should be arrested immediately along with trump

Pelosi could call off the riots, arson, and looting if she wanted. She likes destruction because she believes it hurts Trump's re-election.

"Trump cancels the Jacksonville component of the Republican convention"
I do not like Chris Wallace.  He is part of the DC establishment supporting the Deep State members who hate conservatives and the common man.  He seems to be harder on Trump then he ever was on Obama.  I watched him to hear the President but otherwise, do not watch him.
Mary Trump is a hater!  I do not believe a word she said.  President Trump has done great things for the American people.  I will vote for him in November because creepy Joe Biden would be a disaster!
Trump is jealous that Fauci is throwing out the first pitch tonight. So, being the child that he is, Trump thought getting a baseball player to talk about COVID would be a way to "get back" at Fauci.
Wow, #DictatorTrump, this one backfired! Others will, too!  #TrumpIsLosing
If this virus is much ado about nothing.... why did Trump cancel the Republican Convention in Florida? ü§î
Trump‚Äôs new campaign slogan:  ‚ÄúKill The Kids, Save The Politicians, Trump 2020!‚Äù
Trump lies Americans die. #TrumpFailedAmerica #TrumpVirus
Niece, book, narcissist, crook, Trump.
Look at this news article from The Daily Caller: EXCLUSIVE: Trump, Ben Carson Are ‚ÄôTearing Down‚Äô An Obama-Era Housing Rule Accused Of Funneling Money Into Wealthy Areas
Considering the amount of money the crime syndicate family has ripped off the American public ‚Äì this is chump change. Anybody want to guess how much we‚Äôve spent at trump properties in the last 3 1/2 years?
