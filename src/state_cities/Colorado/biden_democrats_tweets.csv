Swing Voters in Michigan Just Offered the WORST News for Joe Biden!  via
Scott, you know you are not voting for Biden but you are voting for the VP.
Team Trump .... If Biden knew how to fix America, why didn't he tell Obama?🤷‍♀️
Senator Jones... if Alabamaians are not smart enough to re-elect you... it will be their loss! However... Joe Biden will need an excellent Attorney General to right the wrongs and represent all Americans in our fight for a more just America! Can’t wait!
Translation - big tech is stealing the election for Biden
He never got to talk they were all to busy campaigning for Biden
She is too old for Biden so who 😮
…but the rest of the Dem party didn't agree, and Biden is STILL better than Trump, as long as he selects a reasonable VP. He'll LISTEN to the advisors trying to manipulate him, rather than actively ignoring anything that wasn't already in his head.
Biden should make it known that, if/when elected should Russia continue with their brazen behavior he will not only restore troop levels but increase them.
Are they all going to write a book 😂😂😂😂😂what a scam we use to have a force called the FBI that help keep America safe but Obama and Biden ruined that
They will call for peace if Biden wins
And you still haven't said what constitutional rights you've lost.   I lost a chunk of my business, but I'm not blaming POTUS. You put Biden's handlers in office and l really will be out of job. Good chance you'll be too, even longer than needed.
And Biden is the poster boy for Mensa? Pfft, the GOP pork is nothing compared to what the Dems want.   You appear to have time on your hands so maybe expanding your reading selections might be good.
Our country  will fall and handed to the new world order by Biden and Obama
As long as the Electoral College outcome is not close, there is no reason to allow any challenge to the results, no matter what Trump claims. Biden will be sworn in on January 20th. Immediately thereafter, the Secret Service will remove Trump from the White House as a trespasser.
A bipartisan group secretly gathered to game out a contested Trump-Biden election. It wasn’t pretty
And here's how they begin to cancel the debates between Biden and Trump...
Georgia: Trump 49, Biden 46 Kentucky: Trump 60, Biden 34 Michigan: Trump 50, Biden 45 Montana: Trump 52, Biden 42 North Carolina: Trump 49, Biden 46 Pennsylvania: Trump 48, Biden 47 Texas: Trump 49, Biden 45 take our poll - story
It’s far past time for Americans to know the real polling numbers. And these are likely to cause Democrats to heat up the suicide hotline. It’s definitely bad news for Camp Biden. Because President Trump is crushing creepy Joe, especially in swing states where it matters most.
Wow it's almost like Biden was the wrong choice
Nope. And a lot more comes with Biden than just that.
The man who told millions of Americans,"you ain't black," and used the term "Blafrican American," said that OUR President is RACIST. Joe Biden has ABSOLUTELY lost his mind. President Trump is a champion for Black Voices. He always has been and he always will be.
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.

Our state senate election is basically minor league Trump v Biden. Hickenlooper is also a hack so there's not really a win here
No, i'm going where the evidence leads, which so far is all in his favor. if you can show some evidence to the contrary, show it. And please leave out hearsay, circumstantial, or indirect evidence, none of those prove guilt, unless you have direct proof to back up the above.
What and be replaced with plugs Biden won’t happen.
Once trump finds out that Biden VP is going to be a black women. Is trump going to have Pence do blackface with a dress on?
That's why Warren should be Biden's Veep choice.  She'd mop the floor with Pence and never need to raise her voice.
Karen Bass would be a disaster. With her on the ticket, Trump might be able to play his hail mary ‘law and order’ campaign just right enough to squeak through another win. It would be the dumbest thing Biden could do.
I'd vote for a big yellow dog over Trump for POTUS. VP? Who cares?  Conversation about it is just bull session fodder. If Spanky can make news with BS, so can Biden.
Harris calling out Biden during the debates is an argument FOR her to be the Veep … not against.  You need diversity of thought.  And you really need someone who understands what it is like to be both Black and a Woman!!
Will Joe Biden be rubbing her shoulders, making the rest of the nation cringe?
A lot of people thinks #Biden is just acting.
Oh jeez, not a Dem version of Sarah Palin - please god, no.  Biden needs to hit this one right down the middle of the fairway.  No wildcards, no surprises.

Why Hilton and Other Hotels May Not Like This Joe Biden Tax Proposal
Not. One. Bit.
This is the most important hiring decision he will have to make.  Her qualifications will include strengths and experiences that complement his own.  Biden will work with this person daily, so there must be trust and connection.  He will choose wisely on our behalf.
I was at JLA, the 1980 convention, (volunteer concessions) when Reagan chose Bush.
I know Biden is a few years older than Trump but he is much better health. If Trump can make it through a term, Biden can too. So maybe lets not worry about who the VP pick is that much.
What an asshole. Biden is not defunding the police. This is just one of the reasons why you're losing LYING

Biden’s Platform is ending the Rule of Law? And that’s a winner? Are Democrat voters that easily led around by their own blind rage and bruised 2016 egos? Such a simple herd
Counter-argument: Biden’s team is using the VP process to highlight incredible female leaders, some of whom have not had national attention.
Am I the only one that heard him on Stern back then?!
Their “power” goes to their head too much.
Biden will be running on the most progressive platform our party has put forth and I’m so happy about that 💙
I would think Biden's been around the block enough to know that's a bad idea. I have to think it's misdirection.
aka - “He’s not picking who she wants”
So, why doesn't trump put money into mail in voting instead of whining about it. Because their is zero evidence that their is fraud. Joe Biden Biden doesn't mind waiting for his winning results
This is a classic no heroes situation—it’s clear from the way Biden’s team is talking that they hate her in nakedly racist and sexist ways, but also she sucks ass and would be an absolutely insane VP choice

Yup.  Also putting Biden in a tough spot - making it harder for him to NOT pick Harris if he decided he wanted to go a different route.
Kinda like the rupugnants videos of soon to be president Biden ?

Clyburn to Biden: Put a stop to this shit
Right, I am a witness already in the primary. My wife got a ballot and not a citizen. She has a permanent residency card  that we pay 1000s of dollars to renew it every 10 years. I am glad she did that so if Biden gets elected I am moving to Europe. I was soo mad.
I think of Biden as being...not necessarily chaotic, but not predictable enough to keep up with paladin requirements. Maybe a tanky cleric?
I'm not a Kamala fan and think Warren, Demmings, or Castro would be the better picks but I almost want Biden to pick Harris and put all his old buddies out to pasture just to make a point.   I'm sure he won't, but I'd like to see it.
They hate the truth XDDDDDDDDD I love it i roll around in it like a field of flowers.
Every penny you dont donate to biden you are donating to trump.

I'm not "justifying" the law is the law, Trump didn't break it, so your opinion on the matter is irrelevant.

Truman, LBJ, Humphrey, Mondale, Gore, Biden: complete this sequence.
I wish Joe Biden was anywhere near as cool as you claim him to be.
The TV doesn't share facts, they push narratives. I get my information from court documents, science papers, and sources with weight, not dipshit talking puppets on tv like a pleb.
New campaign tack: “JOE BIDEN WILL LEAVE AMERICA DANGEROUSLY UNPREPARED FOR A PANDEMIC“
that's in the epstein case, the case where a girl was pressing charges was dropped, no evidence, no record to corroborate the claims, just claims.
again she was legally, and materially a woman. case closed.
Sternis the one saying she's hot, Trump's response is "you have to like freckles though"
The fake libertarian democrat op? no thanks, registered card carrying  libertarian, and i'm voting trump. We had our change with Ron Paul but the libtards blew it, Trump is the next best thing. Above all i will always vote for the most individualist candidate, collectivism sucks.
a few photo ops at expensive public gatherings is not proof Trump diddled kids.
He said it last time and they showed up. We must vote for Biden.
Trump is mentioned by interviewer, witness denies ever seeing trump, and on page two which you didn't post clarifies that the only reason she thought they were friends is because epstein claimed they were.
Trump was mentioned by the interviewer, which the witness denies, read it again
proof of death threats? proof of incident? oh there is none, i've already looked at it, sorry but none of that proves anything, you're just jumping to conclusions that support your spoonfed orange man bad narrative
the only evidence they had any kind of friendship was from Epstein's mouth. Where's the proof he went to the island? Not in the unsealed documents, in fact they suggest the opposite according to an interview with one victim. You can only bring down someone with proof.
he didn't bring her up, listen again. the other guy brought her up, saying she was hot and all this, Trump sounds like he's uncomfortably trying to change subject.
Lol, so he thinks California is really in doubt pending VP pick. He can’t possibly be that stupid. Even considering he is Joe Biden.
I’m a progressive but Bernie Sanders people make progressives look bad. They honestly embarrass me ...
And Biden hats
Oh please tell me, an actual researcher how to do "research properly" Is it ignoring the record to feed a narrative that supports prior assumptions? because that's what you're doing right now.
Respect is earned not given, and besides that love is a truer virtue than respect which is transient and impersonal. I refuse to elect someone to manage a system on subjective grounds that is stupid, You would do that looking for a wife or a babysitter, not a president.
Overdramatic, Trump was the first to even desire to take action against CV, while Trump was imposing travel bans to infected areas, nancy was promoting trips to chinatown.
decreases in  taxation and regulation freeing up incentivising funds for business.
Biden is a Democrat. If you don't like the job he does, you can vote him out in 4 years. Trump is neither a Dem. nor a Rep. If he wins, there will not be a second chance. The gates of Auschwitz and the swatiska exploding at Nuremberg.
Obama's increases in taxation, and regulation crashed the economy, because that shit stifles small business, and restricts the flow of funds in the market. Happens every time a dem is elected. Only when Trump announced he was running to decrease taxes, and cut regs did it upturn.
Turn off the TV, Trump made his fortune contracting construction of suburbs, the man spawned entire industries, no on one off side projects the left keeps highlighting. Business has a luck factor, trump nets waay into the positive, and the proof is in his bank acct.
Trump is speculating about a Tilden/Hayes type election. But it won't be close. Biden will have +330 EC votes.
cw uspol  God I really hope his criminality catches up with him
this also applies to the prinzipulled leftys who feel it necessary to spend all of their time on here letting everyone know that they hate biden and aren't voting. we fucking get it already talk about something else there's a million hundred other things going on in the country
Duncan Hunter, not Hunter Biden. Two different people.
you guys are stretching making this about Trump, totally ignoring others who were proven involved. why are you ignoring proof for speculation, because your TV told you to? the same industry that has an employee get arrested for sex crimes every other week?
Enough already! We have to vote for Biden. So his VP is really inconsequential if you wanna keep America a democracy. Irony? Maybe. I prefer Kamala, but in the end, I prefer the slew of legislation to right America that we WON’T GET if we keep bitching about something/anything
They don't because they were dropped with no evidence. and proof he went to the island? The flight logs state he had a few hour connecting flight on one of his planes once on a business trip, no record of minors there either. No where do i see where he made a trip to the island.
For bad people, no. For the rest of us that work hard, and love our families, yes.
Newest polls show Biden leading by 8pts. I truly don’t get it.  Biden clearly is struggling cognitively.  How can he lead against China &amp; Russia or make strong economic decisions? Why would anyone vote for him? #2020Election
i'm supposed to feel sorry for a business who's whole model is scamming people out of money with statistics? as for what he did, his policies got my brother in law an awesome paying job, with bigger wages, got us into a nicer house, got me a raise, rounding up sex traffickers etc
He started this w/ bringing up Abram's name from the get-go, followed by all you listed. It's one Biden item that has disappointed me - AND, I'm voting for Biden and SCOTUS.
Legally she was past the threshold, and listening to this, he was steering the conversation away from her. Sounds like you want to increase age of consent, which I might agree with if you increase voting age along with it.
I don’t see an end in sight. Even if 45 loses this election (swear to God y’all better vote him out), how long will it be before Biden can even change anything?
And, if their desired candidate isn't chosen, what? They won't vote for Biden and SCOTUS?
"Uhhhh  du ud durrr, yu no liek kintens? yu dummy hurr"
No, in the epstein case there are rooms filled with evidence that condemn these guys, except Trump who has been exonerated by witness testimony. It the case against them there was 0 evidence, and charges were dropped.
Indeed. I think all hell will break loose no matter who he chooses. Biden should never have started this ridiculous public 🐎 race.
i condemn those who abused children in clear violation of age of consent, Trump didn't, witness testimony exonerates him.
not according to the law.
just in time for the 2016 election, with no proof, and charges dropped entirely. we have receipts for the other guys you're ignoring to try to make this about Trump. Next.
blind speculation has no value in a battle for truth.
Hick and Bullock never caught on because the voter who wanted a moderate white man decided to stick with Biden. If either had caught on, they would have loved it. And if someone like Harris is running, they're going to step in as moderate white man options again.
There have been thousands of protests. A couple violent acts. Biden condemned the violent protests, including in a statement this week.
I don't "trust" anything, trust is for fools. I voted for him because of his background in business, and making difficult deals, He's a businessman, and that is reflected in the current state of the economy, in spite of covid. The left was saying the economy would never recover
No matter who he chooses, I'm voting for Biden and SCOTUS - just sayin'.
True. But then why does anyone listen to any politician re: "govt created jobs"? I guarantee as soon as Biden is President there will be any number of Rs deriding him for "failing to create jobs".
The only ones drawing lines around race are the left.
Despite my numerous phone notifications, I am skeptical of the claim that speculation regarding Biden's VP pick is breaking news worthy of an interruption into my day. If we know who, then sure, that's major news. But theories and speculation - how is that news?
The only thing that matters is who will motivate voters and help Biden win. And the 'playing women off against each other' are sexist and gross.
Florida starts counting mail in ballots early. As do some other states. They actually get counted in FL before ED voting. Biden wins Florida, everything else is moot.
I'm not going to bother to convince a bunch of anti-social posers on here to vote for Biden.
during your debates with trump i need you to say "I've been "Biden" my time!" please do it
Biden supporters like donuts and cops like donuts so Biden supporters is a cop!
I'm voting for Joe Biden in November. I like the Blue Angels and the Thunderbirds and I love the smell of burning jet fuel and afterburner noise.
Can't tell you how many times I've stayed awake at night worrying about what good ol Ed Rendell was thinking. 🙄
Oh, haven’t you heard?  Trump executed him with Bill, Hillary, Tom Hanks, Rita Wilson, Biden, and a few hundred others. Those are doubles you see now.
"Twitter suffered a major security breach on 15 July that saw hackers take control of the accounts of major public figures and corporations, including Joe Biden, Barack Obama, Elon Musk, Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos and Apple."
Biden was like the squarest Democratic Party candidate in 2008. Like, square man. Not far-out, man.
Generally agree, but I think it matters in this case. Biden has basically said he will be a one-term President and it's not certain he can even fulfill four years. Throw in the BLM movement and the pandemic, which has limited anything Biden has done/said publicly, and it matters.
honestly will not be surprised if Biden’s VP pick is Željko Buvač it’s been that kind of wild year
Trump is going to try and paint Biden supporters as hippies, yippies and anarchists.
Anarchists don't like Democrats let alone Biden. Maybe there's a few out there like a "pragmatic anarchist." Otherwise, anarchists and general hooligans aren't into Biden. Maybe Bernie Sanders or Ron Paul.
Many old African-American Biden supporters go to church every Sunday. Especially in the south. The Sunday go-to-meeting old church ladies in fact.
I'm a Biden supporters and I sit around the house minding my own business and don't even play loud music. I think the rioters, looters and arsonists when they occur are assholes. I don't like cancel culture and I'm into old school country music now.
That is not in any way to diminish the credentials of Karen Bass ... but what does that do for you for an election? It doesn't provide a younger fallback option if Biden cannot complete a term, it doesn't help you win a competitive state(s), and it doesn't have any national buzz.
Biden supporters don't riot or set fire to building. They live quiet lives and shop at Trader Joe's, REI, and Home Depot and do a lot of gardening, home improvement projects, take their dogs for a walk and pet their cats.
People are losing it over the prospects of Biden's VP pick.
I hope this is true. But also plenty of casual voters who are planning to vote Biden and aren't on Twitter are likely planning to drop their ballot in the mail at the deadline. (See: taxes)
Thanks to the predictable idiocy of Ed Rendell and Chris Dodd, the Biden team is going to have one helluva time explaining why they didn't pick Senator Harris if they don't pick Senator Harris.
"2020 Election Live Updates: Trump Administration Continues Attacks on Mail-In Voting" by Unknown Author via NYT
you can feel that way, but it's still not illegal. I don't really care how he "thinks and feel about women" because i'm not a subjective person, my feelings are not my master. I want him to represent this country because he can twist arms and get shit done, and does.
🤣🤣🤣 wow. But when he's talking about crime bills and "predators" he has no issue talking normally. You're just as delusional as Biden.
her only notion of a connection is because "jeffery told [her ]" Jeffry also told a reporter he was connected to Elon Musk which was a total fabrication.
The phrase "not that i can remember" is to shield her from legal perjury. if she said "no" plainly, and it turned out he visited, and it came out later, she could be legally liable. so what we have here is limited to what she's seen, and can remember, being high traffic.
you can read right, the people were fishing for something on Trump, but she made clear he was never on the island, corroborating the flight logs. The crime here isn't knowing epstein, it's sexual abuse of little kids, of which Trump is clearly vindicated.
not even close to a smoking gun, rich people go to expensive parties, it's common knowledge, i would be more surprised if they hadn't been in photos together, further the accusation is whether or not he touched these girls, and he didn't.
Most Americans DGAF what they accept or not, we had Trump for four years - New Yahoo News/YouGov poll: Most Trump voters say they will not accept the 2020 results if Biden wins because of mail-in ballots
keep in mind this a legal adult were are talking about here, a fully developed woman, not a child.
This is nothing compared to epstein and the clintons, Trump was vindicated, and at the end of the day, he might say some crass things, but he didn't break the law.

Running on the soul basis of “conservative good/ liberal evil” and “I hate joe Biden” doesn’t make you a good political candidate, It makes you a fear monger. What are your stances on issues, except for on 2nd amendment we all know that one.
"Make due" biden wants to arrest me for my thoughts. I'm going to pass on that fascist thanks.
Hate to be the bearer of bad news but Biden won’t be sympathetic to any attempt to disrupt the status quo. He will just be a friendly face on the same old bullshit.
We could do with less exciting and more maturity.  Biden is our next president.
Oh it’ll be longer than that, in either case. Must flip the senate too. My newest nightmare is a Biden victory paired with a republican senate hell bent on making sure the recovery doesn’t happen so they can elect someone else in ‘24.
lol umm, like targeting his political enemies? That fairness? Muller didn't even know what was in his own report! It's like Biden if he wins.
Yeah he wants to delay the election, only a dictator will do that. He doesn't have the right to it,  YOU ARE NOT MY PRESIDENT! I AM VOTING BIDEN
How much is in the pockets of a Biden.
Does he say it’s rigged if he somehow wins?! We have seen act, it’s boring. What’s different this time is how he’s throwing in the towel himself and keeps bringing up that he’s going to lose. LOVE seeing the fear in his eyes.
DT’s sinking at the polls. Sane supporters doubt his ability. He has divided us, cost us many lives, our economy &amp; our Allies. We cannot sit back &amp; “know” he will lose. We must gently embrace Repubs who doubt him. Biden must choose a strong VP. And we must vote as never before.
The original premise was no election, in which no house members would be elected. I absolutely agree that the election will happen. If red states start opting out, then it will just go to Biden who will get a vast majority of however much of the electoral college actually votes.

Biden’s campaign consists of trump making a jackass of himself on a minutely basis. The fewest minutes Joe is in the spotlight the better.
I think they dropped out because they saw they couldn't steal the moderate label from Biden and didn't want Sanders to be the nominee. I don't think a puppetmaster pulled their strings.
I think #SusanRice is the better choice. They have a working history together. She can navigate division intelligently and unify with diplomacy here and abroad. Most importantly, Biden trusts Rice. Our allies do too. She is ready to step in if needed.
I heard the My Pillow guy is making a mattress resembling the sprawl of the Crucifixion, so people don't forget.  Your arms fit right into the slots.  Unless you get the Biden version.  Arm slots like wagon wheels.  It's called 'the good riddance'
There's hundreds of Joe Biden creepy photos even video of him touching girls sniffing girls
Biden’s campaign, just as Hilary’s was, is a sham from a corrupt DNC that has drown out Bernie twice now. Only a slight bump in the road in the timeframe needed to establish a more progressive nation.
My theory is they keep Trump because they find Obama to valuable and he'll be pretty exposed if Biden gets back in as the riots continue
If Biden’s a liberal, then my name is Greg. #BernieScrewedAgain
I think trump is absolute shit but he has a cult following with no real competition on the republican side and a majority of the left doesn’t really feel much for Biden as to his allegations actions and such if only the dems found a better candidate shitty
All these black athletes kneeling haven't learned a damn thing and they disrespect their own family tree.  So ignorantly disappointing.  They are pussy whipped by Joe Biden.  Makes me sick

Levin bashes Obama eulogy for John Lewis, calls Biden 'a quasi-Bull Connor and a quasi-George Wallace'
Biden has run for president three different times, so I think we can assume he's ambitious as well!
You don't think President Biden will pardon him? 😂
True! Though it might depend on Biden's class.   Obama is likely an INT or CHA based caster, so I'm assuming Biden is probably melee?
This is right on - failure of imagination. She was gambling for a mandate against a GOP congress and couldn't conceive of enough 'deplorables' to give EC to Trump.  Biden will be fine if he balances sincere effort to appeal to all w/ practical focus to assure EC win.
Save it from the catastrophic state Trump is responsible for putting the USA in?  Vote for Joe Biden!!!
And organizing just like we are now. How many days into a Biden presidency before fed troops mace citizens?
Yes.  For Biden
no, see, if we all just vote then biden will have a chance to fix all of this by, like, next march. That's soon enough, right? *checks notes* oh. oh nooo
It’s not Biden’s tweets that worry me.
Elections are run by states though. I thought  was all about states rights. Imagine red states delaying, blue states voting and putting Biden over the top.
I can’t bring myself to vote for Biden. He’ll be a puppet of the left and appoint crazy SCOTUS. #Trump2020
Why would Q (or “the cabal” as you’re saying) expose Hillary, Epstein, Weinstein, Hollywood, pedos, Obama, Biden, Comey, Clapper, Brennan, etc???  And NOT Trump (since he’s taking them all down)  And why aren’t any of them exposing Q as fake since Q is outing them ALL???  🤷‍♂️🤔
It’s a sizable part of Trump’s base, yes.  Just like there’s a sizable chunk of Marxists who will vote for Biden and believe capitalism is evil   Lots of dummies in the electorate who believe in their values over evidence

And he was roundly criticized as a promoting a conspiracy and being a nutcase.  We all knew Biden was right. Of course Trump is going to try to void an election he is sure to lose unless the Russians step in and help him and the GOP ratfucks voter registration and voting places.
Protestors not a political ideology like biden did.
Biden listens to scientists on when it will be safe to send the kids to school. Biden doesn’t sniff Lysol and take magic pills to make his decision.
Serious question. Do you think if he loses Nov. 3 he will stay in office until the inauguration? Or will he cut out early?  Regardless, do you think he would go to the inauguration of Joe Biden?
Kamala's record as prosecutor and state AG and her senate record including voting against a 10% military cut a few days ago are FAR more of a problem than her attack on Biden
Has he yet named a Democrat that he’s asked if they were a paid flunky for the Democrat party or for Joe Biden? We’ll wait. ⏱🤔😮🤭🥱😴
Last night, my 90+ yr. old Trumpist friend said, "I'm so worried that the cities will all be on fire after the election. All of those angry Biden people."  Where the hell is she hearing that?

and you think those obama to trump voters are coming back to mush brain biden? lol
No, they really don't   #Biden
So would a biden presidency. You have given nothing other than orange man bad. If trump is so terrible, give me 5 things he has done that no other president has?
Dear Congressman John Lewis,  You make me want to be a better person and a better American.  I wish you could have lived long enough to witness Joe Biden inaugurated as our next President.  We are all going to get this right.  Rest In Peace.
Biden is clearly in no shape physically or mentally to run. I can’t believe people are content with him as a puppet, I mean candidate.
Well I'm not convinced that Biden wins the election anyway, so I wouldn't be satisfied with a simple loss with a Biden Harris ticket. I'd need to see him win with a different VP pick too.
No. All the moms I know will crawl over glass to vote for Joe Biden. The moms I know stood in line for hours to vote for him in the primary. Kimberly...you are a smart gal(sketchy choice w/ Jr🙄) it is over for DJT. Way too late for over 150,000 families who have lost loved ones.

Nice work!
Well that fight is being told to vote biden/harris.... so good luck with effecting change with an architect of the system and and a D.A prosecutor.
Not dumb. They have just been fed a life time of propaganda. Although they do think biden is fascist and are still voting for them...

What part of biden wants to arrest me dont you understand. You are just lucky I dont vote for evil.
When people vote! I will make as many trips to the polls as needed to get this piece of shit out!! If you can’t mail in your ballot, or just want to have the satisfaction of checking Biden’s name in person, I’ll drive you! Hell, I’ll carry you on my back if needed!!

Let’s get this straight.  In 2016, We went for the red curtain.  This year, there is no curtain.  We know you and your character.  No longer are we blind.  We choose the blue stage.  Biden and trump are both known to us now.
Liz, you want Biden to win, admit it.
Obama’s eloquence and relatability makes me very embarrassed for the current leadership of our country, David. Good news it’s gonna be a Biden landslide. #TrumpOut2020
Now your getting it. It was never about liberation, and was always about control. Guess who is being controlled? Hint: not the Biden/lead prosecutor (harris) ticket...certainly not the act blue donation platform utilized by the BLM official foundation. Malcom X over MLK.
If he can stand up to Jim Crow laws, everything that he did, sacrifice what he gave, we can surely stand up to Trump.  Follow his example and lead.  He showed us the way, and did it with love.
Do people actually think that Biden is going to move LEFT if he gets into office?   No, he is not “Progressive”. #NeverBiden
But it doesn't matter. Even if Biden for some bizarre reason couldn't assume office, the Constitution already provides for multiple avenues of recourse, and none of them include "just staying POTUS".
I’m a Dad for Biden.
So how much did Biden pay you  For your nasty botox face lift
I’m gonna seriously start busting ass when Biden is POTUS and Dems have the House and Senate that we need DC and PR to have statehood!!!!
His game is pathetic and we all know what he's doing. I feel for Biden and all he will have to address after the last 4 years. Biden will conduct transition regardless of Trump's tantrums. What's going to be horrifying is Trump and a lameduck GOP Senate and what they will attempt
Are you scared? Americans already know...Joe Biden wins!

Cool, vote third party and watch when Biden or Trump is elected
It really isn’t. Trump is unhinged and Biden’s not a threat.
I'm not blinded.  Biden is not the best speaker and often makes gaffs.  Trump is WILLFULLY IGNORANT. He is an unintelligent grifter...and you are the mark.  You are being used.

Agree.  I went thru it w/ grandpa, &amp; there's this curious slackness of facial "affect" that happens.  Hard to describe, but I've seen it several times w/Biden, and it means he's not in early stages, as many claim.   Also, everything we see is sanitized.
There are ZERO Biden signs in Colorado. A few Bernie and way more Trump that’s last election.
My tears started forming as he walked to the podium - because we've lost so much and we need his help so badly now. I must believe that when Biden is elected he'll turn to Obama for  insight and inspiration.
Liberal logic: If you vote for Trump you're a racist and a white supremacist, even if you are black! In fact, if they don't vote for Biden then "you ain't black" and a white Biden voter is blacker on the inside than you are! You can't debate rationally with that level of crazy.
True, Biden doesn't come close to Obama on any level. And, in many ways, Biden is a HUGE mistake as a candidate. Obama tipped the scales. It's Obama's fault we've got Biden. Stupid Obama for pushing Biden on us, after the Hillary fiasco.
The only way he would do this is if he can make a deal that nobody (SDNY) will prosecute him.  If we see Biden winning in a landslide I can’t see anyone being willing to let Trump get out of jail free
biden needs support from the left to win, cuz the right has dug in on trump. people are less motivated overall to go out and vote than they were in 2016. i hate trump but i think having any kind of confidence that biden’s got this in the bag is insane.

Hey  what's your take on this now? Is Biden still "going low"?
Vote Biden,  but appealing to the military industrial hierarchy is not the way forward. Slandering protesters, dealing with Larry Summers and all the scumbags that engineer American austerity

Soooo - it’s MAGA TRUMP 2020 onward and upward! HOOORRRRA!
It's fascinating that Biden gets an intelligence briefing, right away tells his people to stop using Tik Tok, then like a week later Trump is like 'Oh $hit! People shouldn't use Tik tok!'
This is not an accurate account of the article. It's not saying she'll be disloyal, just distracted by the fact that her own campaign will begin about 2 years into the new Biden administration.
A veep candidate with less national ambition could act more freely and more deferentially toward Biden. The “anointed front runner” baggage won’t be as heavy. These advantages could help Biden with his agenda without hurting the party’s prospects in 2024.
Wait, so Trump literally is friends with the horrible people. But then you say Biden is disqualified because he's in the same party as someone associated with the horrible people? Terrific stuff.

Really, huh?  Trump has murdered everyone who has died in the US the last 3.5 yrs.  Talk about bloody tiny hands. ❤️.  MAGA bc Biden has nothing in his brain!
Delay and automatically put in Biden the poll leader
I've no doubt there are racially insensitive videos of Biden.  He's been in government since the 70's.  Do you have any racially insensitive videos of Biden in the last 20 years; since the millennium?  We've all learned, grown and changed in the intervening decades.
You think Biden isn't going to ask?  The scenario here is Trump trying to remain in office beyond his Constitutionally mandated term end on Jan 20th, at which point Biden or Pelosi (most likely) would take the oath. Then they're going to be issuing orders.
Donald Trump’s threat to delay or change the 2020 election is empty and absurd. Our election will be on November 3rd and it’s more important than ever to get out to vote and elect Joe Biden.

You would make a fantastic vice president. I hope Biden picks you.
Here's hoping.
“Debates” are just another chance for Trump to rant and lie in the spotlight. Excepting the unlikely scenario where numbers show debates could help Dems lock up the Senate, Biden should pass. Make embedded fact checkers a condition so Trump will chicken out.

Bullshit on this your ads about defunding the police are false and you know it because you can't get the suburban white woman vote away from Biden. Biden is middle ground democrat that will units the US not divide  it like you have.
It’s Joe Biden under that mask.  “You ain’t black if you don’t vote for me”.
You forget, whether it’s true or not, he does whatever he wants...until his regime gets voted out. Vote Biden.
All true, but doesn’t change anything boy Biden’s mental state. Good diversion though
Biden was clear and coherent. Laid out how he would help revive the economy and contain the virus. He didn't lie, he didn't call people names, and he didn't rant incoherently about injecting disinfectants.

Not malicious intent but literally what happens if Joe Biden were to pass away before November? Does Bernie get the bid bc most delegates or????
Wow. Does that mean you are voting for that man in the White House?  Wish I could have threatened my vote all of those years my voting selections lost. I’m guessing Warren would want you to vote Biden. Good luck.
Funny - I have watched Biden speaking at several different events/locations. And being interviewed on different shows.
Just saw a Trump ad that started with text "Biden wants to defund police" &amp; featured a grandma calling 911 during a burglary. The voice on the other end was an answering machine that said something akin to "we can't answer the phone because our budget was cut".  She was attacked
Does anyone wonder why republicans are harping Joe's age and cognitive abilities while Joe is saying he is going to choose a female VP?? That looks like they want momen to vote Biden just in case something happens to him.
If Biden should be elected he would be a place holder president.  Bernie, AOC, Squad, Pelosi &amp; other far left progressives would run the country.  No one believes Biden is capable of being the leader of the free world.  Big trouble for us if he is elected.
Biden will only get worse. Anyone who votes for him irrationally hates Trump more than they care about the future of us &amp; our country.  Bernie will be pulling Biden’s strings - he already is.
I’m sure Biden is being given something for his memory. He knows questions in advance, notes/script in front of him. Talks incredibly slow &amp; wanders off topic. He couldn’t debate me.
Colorado for Biden and WE are going to vote out Senator Cory Gardner out too!
Not going to happen. He’s got nothing to lose and he is going to get worse. I always thought this was why the United States of America has checks and balance. Why isn’t it working?  Vote Biden!
I understand why they don’t want Biden to be questioned with even the most simple, no follow-up questions &amp; his hometown press.

Person, woman, man, camera, tv . . . Biden is going to cream Trump.
I don't think Joe Biden ought to debate Donald Trump until Trump's tax returns are released.   The left?  Who is the left?
The Left isn't running.  is running against Donald Trump. The polls show Biden capturing most Dem voters and a majority of Independent voters. If voter turnout is strong, as is expected, Biden should win going away.
Biden should choose Val.
I’m hearing that from all my contacts as well.  Can’t find one person in my circle that supports Biden.
You mischaracterize Biden. But I’d still vote for your distorted Biden over Trump.
Trump is a pussy and so is Biden
Unfortunately he stole military funds (tax payer money) to build this shoddy wall. Makes me mad. How about you?
They won't be voting against Biden, they get to vote for a number of things at the convention and they are saying they will vote against the platform when it's up for vote. It's not what you are getting at...
Uh.......when did Biden hire you to handle his media responses?
Biden will lose big.  He can’t hide in his basement another three months.
Hey Trump.  Joe Biden was born in Pennsylvania.  I’ll bet they like him lots better than you.   Especially in town, where they remember your lies about building new steel markets.

Oooooohhhh, I’m so scared Gingrich.  That’s really all you’ve got left...fear.  You can’t run on the merits of the Republican Party and it’s leader, Donald Trump.  So, just try bending Biden’s words and scare us.  Your guy (and many of the R’s down ballot) are TOAST.

It’s more than enthusiasm that I will feel when voting for Biden, it will be jubilation. The election will be like completing the Boston Maraton, it will be like winning the lottery, it will be like going on a year long vacation or actually a four year long vacation.
If they are voting third party and voted for trump last time, that helps Biden. Lots are doing this.

Biden has never and will never be asked anything but softball questions.  It continues to amaze me the difference in the way the media treats democrats vs Republicans.  We need a fair press, real journalists, not political activists. They have become a joke.
Americans will never elect Joe Biden.  Everything is against Trump but he will prevail.  We do not want anarchists destroying cities. We don’t want Socialism.  We’ve had Obama &amp; don’t want him again, or Bernie, AOC, or Warren. We’re sick of the deep state.

His reasoning “Dave has always been about comedy first”. So PFT isn’t about comedy 1st? And he can interview dems? Doesn’t really answer the question imo. In his defense, he said he turned down a Biden interview, so that holds water if true.
Let's unpack this. You say Biden is being controlled by other Americans? I'm pretty sure that would be better than being controlled by Russia. Tell your dad [if he answers your calls] golden showers are not taboo anymore? No need to defund the military because of a sex tape.

Biden doesn’t give a damn because he is being manipulated by Communist handlers!!! All he knows is they say oh boy you gonna be President if you announce and sign into dis!! We will control da country as nd ruin the freedoms!! Sign here Joe!!!
At what point will the democrats demand Biden be removed from the nomination?  They know he’s a farce.  Now nurses blew into his nostrils?? He’s not all there.  Why is his wife allowing this charade to continue?
Interesting what-ifs: Would Biden have beaten Trump in '16? I think probably. If Biden ran and lost in '16, would Hillary be running against Trump now?
Awesome!  Looking forward to another ad for Biden 2020.
Look at what Trump says, when reading them start with Things Biden would never do or say, insert every time Trumps name is mentioned. That helps tell the story with  the best view.
Just a friendly reminder Biden woren a mask before trump
How about if Trump and Biden both sit down for the same cognitive tests - and release the results to the public? (I'd like to see even one of Trump's critics other than me suggest this.)
True, but that is the legacy of 45. It is why it is so important that Biden wins. He will restore our relationships with our allies and other countries.
I'm voting because I want to be part of the election that gives Biden 50 states and Trump 0.  Every time I read about Biden's lead, I'm more encouraged.  I wish I could save a ticket stub from the shutout.  I want to make Trump the Biggest Loser in American history.
yeah perhaps he does, but it's clear in any interview with Biden something is off..
Today I receive this thank-you letter from Joe Biden.   You are welcome!  He is asking for more, and I will give, gladly!
Go Biden!! Hey Trump are you watching the polls? Maybe you cannot read....your push to open schools is not well received by Republicans or Democrats. Keep pushing to open schools I love it... BIDEN will certainly get elected.
Lol but Biden who is clearly on the verge of Alzheimer’s is going to? The dude doesn’t even know what he himself is saying half the time. This is a joke.
Kamala Harris was a mainstream competitor for the Dem nomination, right?  She might even be Biden’s VP choice (making her de facto POTUS) with Biden’s senility.
When Biden wins. Remember. He would have never been president if Trump had never won the election. Biden would never have been president if Trump was never president...
Please vote for Biden. It’s important.
Why was nothing done when armed racists stormed the Michigan Capital Building? Nothing not a fucking thing. Not a word from the dictator. You all better pray that the next president does not treat R states like that. Oh that’s right Biden would never behave like Ahole.
Thank you VP Biden and Mr President for speaking with honor, passion and love for ALL the people of our country!   You are missed Mr President but know that Mr Biden will put us back on track. God Bless you both! #VoteJoeBidenToSaveAmerica #VoteJoeBiden #BarackObama
This woman is in a Trump bubble totally unconscious to the real world. Her description of Biden is a perfect description of Trump. No doubt she is a brainwashed Trumpbot 🤣🌹💋
We are past due for a woman as president or VP. There have been many qualified women throughout our history that would have been better than the men who got elected.  If Biden does pick a black woman, she does need to be qualified. Our leaders should be more than old white men.
Presidents don't give back power. Ever. Once they are given a tool, they keep it. So I hope all you people cheering what DHS and Trump are doing, including their new mandate that they can go anywhere 'beyond protecting federal property', are okay with Biden having these powers.
The quote that got me was Trump is unable to string sentences that parse...ah Democrats, you need to listen to your candidate.  Biden is sounding more like a 2 year old every day.  It's sad to see anyone in decline but whats more sad is the push to get that in power.
This is Trump’s America. Biden’s not responsible. The frustration finally became too much. Trump has to go.
For the 20th century, it's tough to beat Woodrow Wilson.  It really comes down to 2nd place, where I put Richard Nixon.  Biden needs to open a history book.  Bottom line, I'd much rather have a POTUS that puts his foot in his own mouth than shoving it up every American's ass.
I will also be voting Biden. Thank you, for your service and a big thank you for your explanation.
I believe Never Trumpers would stay home rather than vote for Biden.  Biden will not win this election - the cat is totally out of the bag.  What the country has seen &amp; heard can’t be undone. And Trump is the best President in my lifetime.
Biden has become the laughingstock of America.
Biden’s wife could end this nightmare if she put Joe’s well-being above her ambition. Biden has made enough off the taxpayers the last 40 yrs so it’s time to hang it up.
Biden hallucinates. Does that worry anyone?
Biden just talked at length about vetting his running mate on ReidOut. There are four black women in the running. But the vetting process is still ongoing, so it's not time for him to announce.
Mueller was used just as Biden is.  Both obviously senile and being manipulated and held up by their handlers.
I trust Biden to put qualified people in cabinet positions and as heads of departments - something Trump hasn't done. Trump has had the largest exodus of people in his administration than any president before him.
Have you listened to Trump? How he calls people names? How uninformed and ignorant he sounds? How he refuses to listen to experts?   Biden wasn't my first choice but he's light years ahead of Trump.
I don't get on Facebook.  Biden was my second to last choice. I guess people wen the safe route with an old white guy.   But he is still a thousand times better than Trump. Trump is mean-spirited and a bully.
Ummmmm... Trump is president dumb a**, not Biden. This is literally how stupid the Republican Party is.
I personally love  finally telling people to do the exact thing he blasted Joe Biden for. Very sound re-election reversal. #WearADamnMask
Agreed, but also Kanye is a person that was aligned more with Trump. You can have goofy people who are disappointed with Trump that would write in Kanye before people who are weighing Biden WITH KANYE. I would write in Castro, Warren, Booker before I write in Kanye.
Frank, that is a second question.  I think you are exaggerating where the Dems are at. After all Joe Biden was the choice: not Bernie or the other far leftists.  The party is going to push to the left but they won't push out capitalism.  They said the same thing about Obama. 1/
Let me get this straight. The current  re-election strategy is to simultaneously say "forget everything I have said for the last 6 months. Believe what I say now" and Biden is not competent enough to identify an elephant, but is competent enough to wear a mask?Joe Biden is not for universal income.
Joe Biden has not authority to impact current legislation.
Our state senate election is basically minor league Trump v Biden. Hickenlooper is also a hack so there's not really a win here
No, i'm going where the evidence leads, which so far is all in his favor. if you can show some evidence to the contrary, show it. And please leave out hearsay, circumstantial, or indirect evidence, none of those prove guilt, unless you have direct proof to back up the above.
What and be replaced with plugs Biden won’t happen.
Once trump finds out that Biden VP is going to be a black women. Is trump going to have Pence do blackface with a dress on?
That's why Warren should be Biden's Veep choice.  She'd mop the floor with Pence and never need to raise her voice.
Karen Bass would be a disaster. With her on the ticket, Trump might be able to play his hail mary ‘law and order’ campaign just right enough to squeak through another win. It would be the dumbest thing Biden could do.
I'd vote for a big yellow dog over Trump for POTUS. VP? Who cares?  Conversation about it is just bull session fodder. If Spanky can make news with BS, so can Biden.
Harris calling out Biden during the debates is an argument FOR her to be the Veep … not against.  You need diversity of thought.  And you really need someone who understands what it is like to be both Black and a Woman!!
Oh my my my !!!! The latest in sad Liberal Socialist quantum arguing with those who are real Americans and are tired of Democrats base line to get Biden elected at any cost even utilizing Marxist orgs to do their bidding! Soooo - it’s MAGA TRUMP 2020 onward and upward! HOOORRRRA!
Will Joe Biden be rubbing her shoulders, making the rest of the nation cringe?
A lot of people thinks #Biden is just acting.
Oh jeez, not a Dem version of Sarah Palin - please god, no.  Biden needs to hit this one right down the middle of the fairway.  No wildcards, no surprises.
Not only is Max riding with Biden he’s with Ringo too!! Dump Trump!!
No plan. That's par for the course with this administration.  House hearing finds US no closer to plan as coronavirus is 'raging out of control' – live

It's fascinating that Biden gets an intelligence briefing, right away tells his people to stop using Tik Tok, then like a week later Trump is like 'Oh $hit! People shouldn't use Tik tok!'
Do your research. Trump is not involved. Also, you haven’t answered my question, What has Joe Biden done for you or anyone for that matter?
Biden v. Trump is Democracy v. fascism.  There, fixed it for you.
GOP scare tactics. It’s all they’ve got. Desperate. #Biden #SupportUSPS

You are a clown 🤡 with the fake memes!  He’s talking to YOU about what Biden thinks of all Americans.   Name just one thing Biden has done to help you? 🤔🤔🤔
RBG is a 3 time cancer survivor.  She has metastatic pancreatic ca to her liver.  She's trying to hang on until after 11/3 in hopes that DJT is not re-elected, but Biden will not win w his dementia.  DJT will end up appointing the next jurist on his list, a woman from Indiana.
Pretty sure joe biden doesnt give a flying fuck if you donate to him, that's what the billionaires are for,  and you've already pledged your vote. You have 0 leverage. Good luck with the tantrum though.
Sir, thanks for your mental statistics and cave man logic. Your seismic pronouncements swell the BLUE TIDE. Thank you for proving you are undesirable! Appreciate your strengthening Biden as #46‼️

Why Hilton and Other Hotels May Not Like This Joe Biden Tax Proposal
Not. One. Bit.
This is the most important hiring decision he will have to make.  Her qualifications will include strengths and experiences that complement his own.  Biden will work with this person daily, so there must be trust and connection.  He will choose wisely on our behalf.
I was at JLA, the 1980 convention, (volunteer concessions) when Reagan chose Bush.
Some advice to team Biden - get this shit under control. It’s undermining your appearance of leadership. And if you’re going to have a cabinet that looks like America why not your VP vetting team?
Postpone the Election? That Could Mean President Biden  via
I know Biden is a few years older than Trump but he is much better health. If Trump can make it through a term, Biden can too. So maybe lets not worry about who the VP pick is that much.
What an asshole. Biden is not defunding the police. This is just one of the reasons why you're losing LYING
Sooo I take it all of Biden’s supporters have really great health care, right?   Because if y’all are expecting expecting major changes regarding affordable........  There’s a bridge in Brooklyn I’d like to sell you!
Biden’s Platform is ending the Rule of Law? And that’s a winner? Are Democrat voters that easily led around by their own blind rage and bruised 2016 egos? Such a simple herd
Counter-argument: Biden’s team is using the VP process to highlight incredible female leaders, some of whom have not had national attention.
Am I the only one that heard him on Stern back then?!
Their “power” goes to their head too much.
Biden will be running on the most progressive platform our party has put forth and I’m so happy about that 💙
I would think Biden's been around the block enough to know that's a bad idea. I have to think it's misdirection.
aka - “He’s not picking who she wants”
So, why doesn't trump put money into mail in voting instead of whining about it. Because their is zero evidence that their is fraud. Joe Biden Biden doesn't mind waiting for his winning results
Joe Biden will reform the police not defund the police. Get that straight you lying fascist pig.
I know nobody is really interested in my take but:  I am willing to vote for Biden bc he’s not Trump. If I can put my views aside, how come “professional and influential” people can’t?  That being said, bc of these actions  goes anyone but  I will not vote.
This is a classic no heroes situation—it’s clear from the way Biden’s team is talking that they hate her in nakedly racist and sexist ways, but also she sucks ass and would be an absolutely insane VP choice

No old out of touch white guys are going to keep her from reaching the office she has earned! She is the most qualified candidate and will bring an energy to the ticket that the Dems need not only to elect Biden, but to also down ticket Dems.
Remember when you validated Biden’s accuser? Oh ... I do
This is not an accurate account of the article. It's not saying she'll be disloyal, just distracted by the fact that her own campaign will begin about 2 years into the new Biden administration.

Biden and Michelle Obama would be a steamroller. And yes, I know she has said she has no interest. But a person can dream, no?
We ended up with Trump v Hillary and now Trump v Biden because we've accepted the lesser of two evils paradigm.
A veep candidate with less national ambition could act more freely and more deferentially toward Biden. The “anointed front runner” baggage won’t be as heavy. These advantages could help Biden with his agenda without hurting the party’s prospects in 2024.
And if Biden brought it on himself then so did Kamala.. go look at some of the cases she convicted as AG and tell me she’s any better than Klobuchar...I’ll wait.
Five more Biden press conferences and Trump will be at 75%
A Biden win would make Mexico and Canada to build or finish the wall to keep US Patriots from fleeing our country lol. Many people are already fleeing their liberal cities to safer places. All states will be lawless and the mass tax increase will make America a 3rd world country.
Yup.  Also putting Biden in a tough spot - making it harder for him to NOT pick Harris if he decided he wanted to go a different route.
Kinda like the rupugnants videos of soon to be president Biden ?
Also Ro Khanna was big for Bernie. Sour grapes?
I think some vague stuff is being fomented because tRump and others are most afraid of Kamala as Joe’s running mate. Don’t listen! Don’t boo! Vote!
Can't stand when they do this.
There’s no way you’re a Christian and vote for killing babies (Democrats - Biden)!
Clyburn to Biden: Put a stop to this shit
Right, I am a witness already in the primary. My wife got a ballot and not a citizen. She has a permanent residency card  that we pay 1000s of dollars to renew it every 10 years. I am glad she did that so if Biden gets elected I am moving to Europe. I was soo mad.
I think of Biden as being...not necessarily chaotic, but not predictable enough to keep up with paladin requirements. Maybe a tanky cleric?
I'm not a Kamala fan and think Warren, Demmings, or Castro would be the better picks but I almost want Biden to pick Harris and put all his old buddies out to pasture just to make a point.   I'm sure he won't, but I'd like to see it.
They hate the truth XDDDDDDDDD I love it i roll around in it like a field of flowers.
Every penny you dont donate to biden you are donating to trump.
also if china keeps screwing around, we might cut them off entirely, and not give them a cent anyway.
Wait, so Trump literally is friends with the horrible people. But then you say Biden is disqualified because he's in the same party as someone associated with the horrible people? Terrific stuff.
at this rate of increase however we will have little trouble repaying the debt.
if joe biden can run from beyond the grave so can our boy
voted for by dems who control the house.
I'm not "justifying" the law is the law, Trump didn't break it, so your opinion on the matter is irrelevant.
well when you lower taxes, and decrease regulations that means more wine, enough wine fills all glasses, that's the entire point of the trick.

Seriously stupid fucking people  New Yahoo News/YouGov poll: Most Trump voters say they will not accept the 2020 results if Biden wins because of mail-in ballots
We both know they aren't
facts
Trump is exonerated by the witness in your first doc
Truman, LBJ, Humphrey, Mondale, Gore, Biden: complete this sequence.
I wish Joe Biden was anywhere near as cool as you claim him to be.
The TV doesn't share facts, they push narratives. I get my information from court documents, science papers, and sources with weight, not dipshit talking puppets on tv like a pleb.
New campaign tack: “JOE BIDEN WILL LEAVE AMERICA DANGEROUSLY UNPREPARED FOR A PANDEMIC“
that's in the epstein case, the case where a girl was pressing charges was dropped, no evidence, no record to corroborate the claims, just claims.
again she was legally, and materially a woman. case closed.
Sternis the one saying she's hot, Trump's response is "you have to like freckles though"
The fake libertarian democrat op? no thanks, registered card carrying  libertarian, and i'm voting trump. We had our change with Ron Paul but the libtards blew it, Trump is the next best thing. Above all i will always vote for the most individualist candidate, collectivism sucks.
a few photo ops at expensive public gatherings is not proof Trump diddled kids.
He could run with a bag of sand as his running mate and I’ll STILL vote Biden
He said it last time and they showed up. We must vote for Biden.
Trump is mentioned by interviewer, witness denies ever seeing trump, and on page two which you didn't post clarifies that the only reason she thought they were friends is because epstein claimed they were.
Trump was mentioned by the interviewer, which the witness denies, read it again
proof of death threats? proof of incident? oh there is none, i've already looked at it, sorry but none of that proves anything, you're just jumping to conclusions that support your spoonfed orange man bad narrative
the only evidence they had any kind of friendship was from Epstein's mouth. Where's the proof he went to the island? Not in the unsealed documents, in fact they suggest the opposite according to an interview with one victim. You can only bring down someone with proof.
he didn't bring her up, listen again. the other guy brought her up, saying she was hot and all this, Trump sounds like he's uncomfortably trying to change subject.
Lol, so he thinks California is really in doubt pending VP pick. He can’t possibly be that stupid. Even considering he is Joe Biden.
I’m a progressive but Bernie Sanders people make progressives look bad. They honestly embarrass me ...
And Biden hats
Oh please tell me, an actual researcher how to do "research properly" Is it ignoring the record to feed a narrative that supports prior assumptions? because that's what you're doing right now.
Respect is earned not given, and besides that love is a truer virtue than respect which is transient and impersonal. I refuse to elect someone to manage a system on subjective grounds that is stupid, You would do that looking for a wife or a babysitter, not a president.
Overdramatic, Trump was the first to even desire to take action against CV, while Trump was imposing travel bans to infected areas, nancy was promoting trips to chinatown.
decreases in  taxation and regulation freeing up incentivising funds for business.
Biden is a Democrat. If you don't like the job he does, you can vote him out in 4 years. Trump is neither a Dem. nor a Rep. If he wins, there will not be a second chance. The gates of Auschwitz and the swatiska exploding at Nuremberg.
Obama's increases in taxation, and regulation crashed the economy, because that shit stifles small business, and restricts the flow of funds in the market. Happens every time a dem is elected. Only when Trump announced he was running to decrease taxes, and cut regs did it upturn.
Turn off the TV, Trump made his fortune contracting construction of suburbs, the man spawned entire industries, no on one off side projects the left keeps highlighting. Business has a luck factor, trump nets waay into the positive, and the proof is in his bank acct.
Trump is speculating about a Tilden/Hayes type election. But it won't be close. Biden will have +330 EC votes.
cw uspol  God I really hope his criminality catches up with him
this also applies to the prinzipulled leftys who feel it necessary to spend all of their time on here letting everyone know that they hate biden and aren't voting. we fucking get it already talk about something else there's a million hundred other things going on in the country
Duncan Hunter, not Hunter Biden. Two different people.
you guys are stretching making this about Trump, totally ignoring others who were proven involved. why are you ignoring proof for speculation, because your TV told you to? the same industry that has an employee get arrested for sex crimes every other week?
Enough already! We have to vote for Biden. So his VP is really inconsequential if you wanna keep America a democracy. Irony? Maybe. I prefer Kamala, but in the end, I prefer the slew of legislation to right America that we WON’T GET if we keep bitching about something/anything
They don't because they were dropped with no evidence. and proof he went to the island? The flight logs state he had a few hour connecting flight on one of his planes once on a business trip, no record of minors there either. No where do i see where he made a trip to the island.
For bad people, no. For the rest of us that work hard, and love our families, yes.
Newest polls show Biden leading by 8pts. I truly don’t get it.  Biden clearly is struggling cognitively.  How can he lead against China &amp; Russia or make strong economic decisions? Why would anyone vote for him? #2020Election
i'm supposed to feel sorry for a business who's whole model is scamming people out of money with statistics? as for what he did, his policies got my brother in law an awesome paying job, with bigger wages, got us into a nicer house, got me a raise, rounding up sex traffickers etc
He started this w/ bringing up Abram's name from the get-go, followed by all you listed. It's one Biden item that has disappointed me - AND, I'm voting for Biden and SCOTUS.
Legally she was past the threshold, and listening to this, he was steering the conversation away from her. Sounds like you want to increase age of consent, which I might agree with if you increase voting age along with it.
I don’t see an end in sight. Even if 45 loses this election (swear to God y’all better vote him out), how long will it be before Biden can even change anything?
And, if their desired candidate isn't chosen, what? They won't vote for Biden and SCOTUS?
"Uhhhh  du ud durrr, yu no liek kintens? yu dummy hurr"
No, in the epstein case there are rooms filled with evidence that condemn these guys, except Trump who has been exonerated by witness testimony. It the case against them there was 0 evidence, and charges were dropped.
Indeed. I think all hell will break loose no matter who he chooses. Biden should never have started this ridiculous public 🐎 race.
i condemn those who abused children in clear violation of age of consent, Trump didn't, witness testimony exonerates him.
not according to the law.
just in time for the 2016 election, with no proof, and charges dropped entirely. we have receipts for the other guys you're ignoring to try to make this about Trump. Next.
blind speculation has no value in a battle for truth.
Hick and Bullock never caught on because the voter who wanted a moderate white man decided to stick with Biden. If either had caught on, they would have loved it. And if someone like Harris is running, they're going to step in as moderate white man options again.
There have been thousands of protests. A couple violent acts. Biden condemned the violent protests, including in a statement this week.
I don't "trust" anything, trust is for fools. I voted for him because of his background in business, and making difficult deals, He's a businessman, and that is reflected in the current state of the economy, in spite of covid. The left was saying the economy would never recover
No matter who he chooses, I'm voting for Biden and SCOTUS - just sayin'.
True. But then why does anyone listen to any politician re: "govt created jobs"? I guarantee as soon as Biden is President there will be any number of Rs deriding him for "failing to create jobs".
The only ones drawing lines around race are the left.
Despite my numerous phone notifications, I am skeptical of the claim that speculation regarding Biden's VP pick is breaking news worthy of an interruption into my day. If we know who, then sure, that's major news. But theories and speculation - how is that news?
The only thing that matters is who will motivate voters and help Biden win. And the 'playing women off against each other' are sexist and gross.
Florida starts counting mail in ballots early. As do some other states. They actually get counted in FL before ED voting. Biden wins Florida, everything else is moot.
I'm not going to bother to convince a bunch of anti-social posers on here to vote for Biden.
during your debates with trump i need you to say "I've been "Biden" my time!" please do it
Biden supporters like donuts and cops like donuts so Biden supporters is a cop!
I'm voting for Joe Biden in November. I like the Blue Angels and the Thunderbirds and I love the smell of burning jet fuel and afterburner noise.
Can't tell you how many times I've stayed awake at night worrying about what good ol Ed Rendell was thinking. 🙄
Oh, haven’t you heard?  Trump executed him with Bill, Hillary, Tom Hanks, Rita Wilson, Biden, and a few hundred others. Those are doubles you see now.
"Twitter suffered a major security breach on 15 July that saw hackers take control of the accounts of major public figures and corporations, including Joe Biden, Barack Obama, Elon Musk, Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos and Apple."
Biden was like the squarest Democratic Party candidate in 2008. Like, square man. Not far-out, man.
Generally agree, but I think it matters in this case. Biden has basically said he will be a one-term President and it's not certain he can even fulfill four years. Throw in the BLM movement and the pandemic, which has limited anything Biden has done/said publicly, and it matters.
honestly will not be surprised if Biden’s VP pick is Željko Buvač it’s been that kind of wild year
Trump is going to try and paint Biden supporters as hippies, yippies and anarchists.
Anarchists don't like Democrats let alone Biden. Maybe there's a few out there like a "pragmatic anarchist." Otherwise, anarchists and general hooligans aren't into Biden. Maybe Bernie Sanders or Ron Paul.
Many old African-American Biden supporters go to church every Sunday. Especially in the south. The Sunday go-to-meeting old church ladies in fact.
I'm a Biden supporters and I sit around the house minding my own business and don't even play loud music. I think the rioters, looters and arsonists when they occur are assholes. I don't like cancel culture and I'm into old school country music now.
That is not in any way to diminish the credentials of Karen Bass ... but what does that do for you for an election? It doesn't provide a younger fallback option if Biden cannot complete a term, it doesn't help you win a competitive state(s), and it doesn't have any national buzz.
Biden supporters don't riot or set fire to building. They live quiet lives and shop at Trader Joe's, REI, and Home Depot and do a lot of gardening, home improvement projects, take their dogs for a walk and pet their cats.
People are losing it over the prospects of Biden's VP pick.
I hope this is true. But also plenty of casual voters who are planning to vote Biden and aren't on Twitter are likely planning to drop their ballot in the mail at the deadline. (See: taxes)
Indeed.  It’s a bad choice but clearly Biden is better
Thanks to the predictable idiocy of Ed Rendell and Chris Dodd, the Biden team is going to have one helluva time explaining why they didn't pick Senator Harris if they don't pick Senator Harris.
"2020 Election Live Updates: Trump Administration Continues Attacks on Mail-In Voting" by Unknown Author via NYT
you can feel that way, but it's still not illegal. I don't really care how he "thinks and feel about women" because i'm not a subjective person, my feelings are not my master. I want him to represent this country because he can twist arms and get shit done, and does.
🤣🤣🤣 wow. But when he's talking about crime bills and "predators" he has no issue talking normally. You're just as delusional as Biden.
her only notion of a connection is because "jeffery told [her ]" Jeffry also told a reporter he was connected to Elon Musk which was a total fabrication.
The phrase "not that i can remember" is to shield her from legal perjury. if she said "no" plainly, and it turned out he visited, and it came out later, she could be legally liable. so what we have here is limited to what she's seen, and can remember, being high traffic.
you can read right, the people were fishing for something on Trump, but she made clear he was never on the island, corroborating the flight logs. The crime here isn't knowing epstein, it's sexual abuse of little kids, of which Trump is clearly vindicated.
not even close to a smoking gun, rich people go to expensive parties, it's common knowledge, i would be more surprised if they hadn't been in photos together, further the accusation is whether or not he touched these girls, and he didn't.
Most Americans DGAF what they accept or not, we had Trump for four years - New Yahoo News/YouGov poll: Most Trump voters say they will not accept the 2020 results if Biden wins because of mail-in ballots
keep in mind this a legal adult were are talking about here, a fully developed woman, not a child.
This is nothing compared to epstein and the clintons, Trump was vindicated, and at the end of the day, he might say some crass things, but he didn't break the law.
Biden will make the best decision
Let's go.  Time to stop this once and for all.  Any person who votes for Biden to appease these a$$#0!3$ is an idiot.
Any chance you want to comment about Biden observation around 4/24 that Trump will want to delay the election?  Made Biden look like Nostradamus.
Biden is a joke.
I know Biden will make the right decision. What do you think?
Trump IS worse.  You guys are worse with Benghazi, Hillary's emails and Hunter Biden.  Also, 'libtard' shows you to be a #Cult45 member.  If you want to be taken seriously, drop the Qanon rhetoric.
Pompeo hit with subpoena after he’s caught assisting Senate GOP’s political smear of Biden -
Them and the Lincoln Project. Come Nov. 4, they’ll be attacking Biden before he’s even sworn in.
America has nothing to do with communism. Socialism is NOT communism. Dems are NOT communists. Biden is not even on the left of the spectrum. Keep spreading your propaganda but it won’t work on educated people.
I'm not scared, he's lost his element of surprise and shock that he enjoyed in 2016.  We're onto him, and more importantly, so are the dems and the Biden campaign.
“Biden may take up to August 10th” !!!!
Oh no, poor man. He seems to have caught what Biden’s got.
How many consecutive mos did the Obama/Biden admin have positive job growth? How many years did the economy grow under their admin? Since we’re now down 30m jobs (including mine) &amp; only trending worse, &amp; we just posted the worst economic quarter in history, you should shut up.
Biden oversaw implementation of Obama’s Stimulus Plan after the economy crashed under another Republican president. Millions of jobs added. Now under this Republican President all that gain is gone
It’s going to be a landslide—say hello to President Biden!! #2020Election  #NovemberIsComing #NobodyLikesTrump
Biden will have a higher body count than Trump. Bowing to the desires of billionaires and corporations doesn’t make you brave, fascist enabler.
Hickenlooper might be a poor Senate candidate, but at least the Senate PAC runs terrible ads for him.  Yikes.  And this coming after a poll found him lagging Biden's #s by quite a bit.
Nancy Pelosi just endorsed Rashida Tlaib in her primary on the same day that Rashida Tlaib refused to endorse Joe Biden, the Democratic nominee for President of the United States.
imagine the doomsday-scenario discussions Biden must be having with [redacted] to prepare for trump going full colonel kurtz / jim jones  deeply unsettling but almost certainly occurring
I like you posted your centrist creds😂 Fellow centrists who agrees with you on Biden. I remember the last few years of Regan’s presidency after he mentally checked out. It was a mess and that’s putting it mildly.
What exactly is Trump’s “good American policy?”  He rode the wave of good economic recovery Biden and Obama created. And now that Trump has to make decisions and lead, OUR 👏🏻 ECONOMY 👏🏻 IS 👏🏻 IN 👏🏻 RUINS!!  #TrumpFailsAmerica
Biden wants to arrest people for their political ideology. Thanks for wanting fascism.

I think the first challenge for Joe Biden, If he wins, will be remembering what day it is.
I wanted to hear if Joe could give eulogy. Where is Joe Biden?
You really think trump or Biden can fix this?
Biden having a stroke
Running on the soul basis of “conservative good/ liberal evil” and “I hate joe Biden” doesn’t make you a good political candidate, It makes you a fear monger. What are your stances on issues, except for on 2nd amendment we all know that one.
"Make due" biden wants to arrest me for my thoughts. I'm going to pass on that fascist thanks.
Hate to be the bearer of bad news but Biden won’t be sympathetic to any attempt to disrupt the status quo. He will just be a friendly face on the same old bullshit.
We could do with less exciting and more maturity.  Biden is our next president.
Don't most states, except for around 8, have at-will employment? It's fantastic that you want more rights for employees! Joe Biden appreciates your vote.
Oh it’ll be longer than that, in either case. Must flip the senate too. My newest nightmare is a Biden victory paired with a republican senate hell bent on making sure the recovery doesn’t happen so they can elect someone else in ‘24.
Lol 😂😂😂😂 good lord the Democrats are concerned about Joe Biden! The one candidate literally worse than Hillary Clinton! Good job Dimms
lol umm, like targeting his political enemies? That fairness? Muller didn't even know what was in his own report! It's like Biden if he wins.
Yeah he wants to delay the election, only a dictator will do that. He doesn't have the right to it,  YOU ARE NOT MY PRESIDENT! I AM VOTING BIDEN
How much is in the pockets of a Biden.
Does he say it’s rigged if he somehow wins?! We have seen act, it’s boring. What’s different this time is how he’s throwing in the towel himself and keeps bringing up that he’s going to lose. LOVE seeing the fear in his eyes.
DT’s sinking at the polls. Sane supporters doubt his ability. He has divided us, cost us many lives, our economy &amp; our Allies. We cannot sit back &amp; “know” he will lose. We must gently embrace Repubs who doubt him. Biden must choose a strong VP. And we must vote as never before.
The original premise was no election, in which no house members would be elected. I absolutely agree that the election will happen. If red states start opting out, then it will just go to Biden who will get a vast majority of however much of the electoral college actually votes.

Biden’s campaign consists of trump making a jackass of himself on a minutely basis. The fewest minutes Joe is in the spotlight the better.
I think they dropped out because they saw they couldn't steal the moderate label from Biden and didn't want Sanders to be the nominee. I don't think a puppetmaster pulled their strings.
I think #SusanRice is the better choice. They have a working history together. She can navigate division intelligently and unify with diplomacy here and abroad. Most importantly, Biden trusts Rice. Our allies do too. She is ready to step in if needed.

There's hundreds of Joe Biden creepy photos even video of him touching girls sniffing girls
Biden’s campaign, just as Hilary’s was, is a sham from a corrupt DNC that has drown out Bernie twice now. Only a slight bump in the road in the timeframe needed to establish a more progressive nation.
My theory is they keep Trump because they find Obama to valuable and he'll be pretty exposed if Biden gets back in as the riots continue
If Biden’s a liberal, then my name is Greg. #BernieScrewedAgain
I think trump is absolute shit but he has a cult following with no real competition on the republican side and a majority of the left doesn’t really feel much for Biden as to his allegations actions and such if only the dems found a better candidate shitty

True! Though it might depend on Biden's class.   Obama is likely an INT or CHA based caster, so I'm assuming Biden is probably melee?
As if it is any surprise that the Russians will interfere in this election and try to to the so-called "October Surprise". No surprise either that the Republicans will help.
Biden does not utter racial slurs.
This is right on - failure of imagination. She was gambling for a mandate against a GOP congress and couldn't conceive of enough 'deplorables' to give EC to Trump.  Biden will be fine if he balances sincere effort to appeal to all w/ practical focus to assure EC win.
Save it from the catastrophic state Trump is responsible for putting the USA in?  Vote for Joe Biden!!!
And organizing just like we are now. How many days into a Biden presidency before fed troops mace citizens?

This is BS using the Eulogy for John Lewis to campaign for Biden through Obama? Why isn't Biden out there speaking? Being in office 47 years I am sure he knew John Lewis very well.The Demos do not want you to see how incompetent Biden really is. WOW They stoop so low. Trump 2020
Yes.  For Biden
no, see, if we all just vote then biden will have a chance to fix all of this by, like, next march. That's soon enough, right? *checks notes* oh. oh nooo
It’s not Biden’s tweets that worry me.
Elections are run by states though. I thought  was all about states rights. Imagine red states delaying, blue states voting and putting Biden over the top.
I can’t bring myself to vote for Biden. He’ll be a puppet of the left and appoint crazy SCOTUS. #Trump2020
Why would Q (or “the cabal” as you’re saying) expose Hillary, Epstein, Weinstein, Hollywood, pedos, Obama, Biden, Comey, Clapper, Brennan, etc???  And NOT Trump (since he’s taking them all down)  And why aren’t any of them exposing Q as fake since Q is outing them ALL???  🤷‍♂️🤔

And he was roundly criticized as a promoting a conspiracy and being a nutcase.  We all knew Biden was right. Of course Trump is going to try to void an election he is sure to lose unless the Russians step in and help him and the GOP ratfucks voter registration and voting places.
Protestors not a political ideology like biden did.
Biden listens to scientists on when it will be safe to send the kids to school. Biden doesn’t sniff Lysol and take magic pills to make his decision.
you are so right young lady. Biden forgets where he is half the time. We’re screwed either way
Serious question. Do you think if he loses Nov. 3 he will stay in office until the inauguration? Or will he cut out early?  Regardless, do you think he would go to the inauguration of Joe Biden?
Kamala's record as prosecutor and state AG and her senate record including voting against a 10% military cut a few days ago are FAR more of a problem than her attack on Biden

Well I'm not convinced that Biden wins the election anyway, so I wouldn't be satisfied with a simple loss with a Biden Harris ticket. I'd need to see him win with a different VP pick too.
No. All the moms I know will crawl over glass to vote for Joe Biden. The moms I know stood in line for hours to vote for him in the primary. Kimberly...you are a smart gal(sketchy choice w/ Jr🙄) it is over for DJT. Way too late for over 150,000 families who have lost loved ones.

Agree.  I went thru it w/ grandpa, &amp; there's this curious slackness of facial "affect" that happens.  Hard to describe, but I've seen it several times w/Biden, and it means he's not in early stages, as many claim.   Also, everything we see is sanitized.

My tears started forming as he walked to the podium - because we've lost so much and we need his help so badly now. I must believe that when Biden is elected he'll turn to Obama for  insight and inspiration.
Delay and automatically put in Biden the poll leader
Liberal logic: If you vote for Trump you're a racist and a white supremacist, even if you are black! In fact, if they don't vote for Biden then "you ain't black" and a white Biden voter is blacker on the inside than you are! You can't debate rationally with that level of crazy.
I've no doubt there are racially insensitive videos of Biden.  He's been in government since the 70's.  Do you have any racially insensitive videos of Biden in the last 20 years; since the millennium?  We've all learned, grown and changed in the intervening decades.
True, Biden doesn't come close to Obama on any level. And, in many ways, Biden is a HUGE mistake as a candidate. Obama tipped the scales. It's Obama's fault we've got Biden. Stupid Obama for pushing Biden on us, after the Hillary fiasco.
The only way he would do this is if he can make a deal that nobody (SDNY) will prosecute him.  If we see Biden winning in a landslide I can’t see anyone being willing to let Trump get out of jail free
biden needs support from the left to win, cuz the right has dug in on trump. people are less motivated overall to go out and vote than they were in 2016. i hate trump but i think having any kind of confidence that biden’s got this in the bag is insane.

It is the Democrats and Republicans responsibility to gives us deserving qualified candidates from which to vote on and you cannot tell me President Trump and former VP Joe Biden are the best our great country can come up with to run for the highest office!
Why didn’t Biden speak, he’s the Democrat nominee? This was a racist, partisan rant at an honorable mans funeral. Gross
Then President Biden will call out the military to put down the insurrection (as the Constitution allows).

Say it ain't so, Joe...
Obama and Biden controlled both houses of congress in 2010 Yet they didn't pass anything close to M4A.  They passed a bill which was originally thought up by a conservative think tank. Same BS every cycle. You all act like Dems will bring socialism.  Scare tactics.
You think Biden isn't going to ask?  The scenario here is Trump trying to remain in office beyond his Constitutionally mandated term end on Jan 20th, at which point Biden or Pelosi (most likely) would take the oath. Then they're going to be issuing orders.
You got Biden.  I think you can sit down now.  Also this:

Yup. Formerly-Warren husband and I are waiting for a Biden-Harris sign.
I think that to frame it that way is a false dichotomy. Everyone accepting the VP job is ambitious and has dreams of being president. See: Joe Biden. You can have that ambition and also be equally focused on doing the best possible job as president. Ambition is not a dirty word.
If we are going to make a the vice presidency a springboard for the presidency after this election, I would rather prosecutors of any kind be barred from the position. Probably not Biden’s reasoning. But it is mine.

…can't even land on platforms like    ✔️ Democrats don't support pedophilia (Remember IT WAS BIDEN who proposed #VAWA &amp; got it passed into law. Do you think #HumptyDumptyDonaldTrump would do THAT??)   Now #STFU &amp; SAY THE NAMES of those NEEDLESSLY MURDERED BY POLICE
Establish Dems came together, finally, &amp; backed their most realistic candidate in Biden &amp; had Boot and Klob back out. SC voted for the man they trusted most, not surprising, &amp; then the media blew it up to make sure "BIDEN IS BACK!". Bernie needed to do more &amp; it didn't happen.
But.. question is.. can you give me any logical or legitimate reasons you would vote for Biden?
Could a Dem gov appoint Biden and then colleagues name him PPT ?
#WeWillVote  #WeWillVoteByMail  From CO here &amp; we will hand deliver our vote for Joe Biden to the local ballot drop-off, trump may try to fuck with the USPS but there are ways to be sure your vote counts. Do what you have to &amp; vote this ass out before he destroys our democracy.
Apparently Joe Biden’s press conference on his economic plan, racial inequality was over James’s head as well. The President  is tweeting today about pizza. Perhaps that is easier for you to grasp. We expect that from Jr.I am old enough to remember when I thought of you as smart
Republicans are about to destroy the USPS but we still have people on the fence about voting for Biden.
No one Biden is sworn in he no longer has any say about anything
Where is all the evidence that Giuliani promised to release implicating Hunter and Joe Biden? Can’t release what he doesn’t have!!
GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT drops in 2nd quarter...DELAY THE ELECTION 🤦🏾‍♂️ NOOOOOO MORE FAKE NEWS...keep that MFing election going! Give me Biden, Kanye, or even that little monkey that dances with the symbols but this so called “HUMAN” in office right now 🤮 ITS A SETUP 🗺 #literally
it’s a sealed ballot, how on Earth would they know if it’s a Trump or Biden vote? Chill on the paranoia
Trump would need the military to back his c*up, and I just don't see that happening when Joe Biden is the other choice. Biden would be great for the military industrial complex, even better than Trump in many ways.
And yes I would vote for him before Biden. A vote for Biden is a vote for his VP and the communist agenda of the far left. No thanks
Both parties are completely corrupt and only care about their corporate interest.  Congress is in control of our policies. for president I am more concerned with someone respected by the world. The face of our nation. Granted Biden is a horrific choice. Just not as horrific
Biden supports fascism. There is no choice.
No you are being a child. 4 more years of GOP gives us a one party system. And then any progressive will be jailed or otherwise eliminated.  Biden still keeps the democracy intact.  If you don't see the difference, then you are the who is a freaking idiot.
He could tweet that he likes strawberries and it would be used against him. Unwise tweets are an expected part of the package, and are not going to sway Trump voters to not vote or vote Biden.
Who helps Biden the most in CA, NV, AZ, which is greater CA? Who helps the most in TX and FL?
So, like LBJ, Hubert Humphrey, Walter Mondale, Al Gore, Joe  Biden? Or different because she has two X sex chromosomes?
I could of voted  for Tulsi. Can’t vote for Biden.....sorry
Unfortunately, I'm on the Biden sheep track as of now. I really want to support other candidates, but I can't in good faith unless their presence was rock solid/I stop seeing articles about mail-in voter suppression/youth not having adequate voting measures
Hey    Absentee Ballots ARE Mail In Ballots.  Election Dates are Federal Law and you can't EO your way around it.  YOU killed Herman Cain.  You're the worst thing to ever happen to the United States of America... But we will Build Back Better with #Biden.
Joe Biden speaks at a campaign stop in Hampton, N.H.  It’s looking entirely possible that Democrats will emerge from November with unified control of the White House and Congress. There’s a lot of time until Election Day, but no one expects Republicans to threaten in the Hou…
Why? Biden can govern without the WH, while one support after another is pulled away from the White House. Soon, no one will show up to change the sheets and check on the electrical generators.
Whoever the vp choice is, Biden will be removed from office for being mentally unfit when she invokes the 25th Amendment.
Obama Unleashes on Trump Privately as He Raises $24 Million for Biden #Biden2020
“Those are the incoherent, conspiracy-theory ramblings of a lost candidate who is out of touch with reality. President Trump has been clear that the election will happen on Nov. 3.” - Trump campaign spokesman Tim Murtaugh to CNN re: Biden’s comments that Trump would try this. 🤪
Are you kidding me? Not a “typical polished politician?” Trump’s rhetoric is best described as BABBLING. You realize Trump speaks at a 4th-grade level, right?He’s unintelligent AND unintelligible. For you to say Biden can’t speak and Trump can, is the height of disingenuousness.
October 12, 2020. Donald Trump resigns from the presidency stating that the election is rigged and doesn’t want to be a “loser”. Republicans scramble to get another candidate but it’s too late. Joe Biden wins the largest electoral victory in history.
Oh hell no!!! Already heard you're slowing down the mail around that time.  We want you OUT ASAP.  you can always just resign to save yourself the embarrassment of getting worked by Biden
...that lead slowly trickles away, as ballot by ballot is counted and rallied for Joe Biden. If there’s a realistic scenario for the worst fear of Democrats (Trump protesting and not leaving office) it would be THIS.
This is my friend, Beth, just having a conversation with Biden and Obama. 🤩
Imagine the real progress you could make if you did actual organizing instead of screaming at people to suck it up and vote for Biden.
You forgot the rest of the plan. Train workers for new energy jobs. Hire people to repair the infrastructure. Look to the future. Guess you guys cannot face the reality that your guy is stuck in early 20 century Germany. And he is killing the citizens of the US for profit. #Biden
I see. Just saw various well-known Kamala people disputing the claims of one tweeter that it’s a common position among the KHive. I am not on here much anymore but I have not encountered any KHive anti-Biden tweets.
👏🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻absolutely correct. I am a moderate and I struggle to call myself a Dem or Rep.. I just can’t call myself a Trump base. He’s scary.. Biden is only mildly less scary for different reasons. I began an anti-trump so the assumption is I’m liberal. It’s not binary!
Yeah and we all better vote (for Biden) in November to make sure it stays that way.  Please.
So this tweet.. Are you going to delete it? Or perform some back-breaking spin talk to twist it? Looks like Biden knows Trump better than you, that must be embarrassing for you given your blind, lap dog devotion to a wanna be dictator.
Because a millionaire with a net worth between himself and his wife of $9 million totally related to the struggle of paying exorbitant insurance and rent prices. Uh-huh.   Yeah, more so than trump. But come on, my income is less than $30k a year.
Heads up! Another obvious, blatant deep state move coming. Durham, almost certain, won't release his report until after election to protect Dems. Says don't want to interfere with results. He prefers we elect Biden, a big part of spygate.
Great thread of commentators that went after Biden for suggesting 45 would try to delay the election
I'd say yes, but doubt they'd do much to alleviate the suffering once in power. We'll have more testing and masks will be cool but Joe Biden ain't singing no 1200 dollar check
Even if that were true (it's not, you're a liar), I'd still trust Biden to surround himself with experts and professionals. What we have now is a wanna-be dictator who surrounds himself with loyalists who will do and say anything to please their leader.
Hey  do you now feel pretty stupid for chastising Biden when Trump was so obviously going to try and find a way to push back the election?  Will you tweet a video of you eating crow?
Also, you’re got some radical assumptions about me.   1. I’m unaffiliated  2. I voted for Yang in the primaries 3. I’m not a “Berner” or “Bernie bro” or whatever you call a Bernie supporter.  4. Obviously I’m not voting for Trump. Criticizing Biden doesn’t make me a trumper.
It doesn't concern you that it was only an allegation started by liberal leftist.  The truth is such a bothersome issue for most liberal democRATs.  Does it concern you that sleepy joey Biden fondles little girls?
He said as much in March. Even if by some miracle it did make it through both houses, he said he would veto it based on the estimated price tag. Of course, politicians don’t always do what they say, but suffice that he’s satisfied with the status quo.
Obviously because:  Corporate and insurance company donors don’t want it. And they have influence.   The DNC sabotaged Sanders’ campaign in 2016 and 2020. He also had a heart attack, it scared people off.   Biden was the “safer” pick. 65+ voter turnout. 45 and under didnt show up
If Trump truly believes he will win the in-person voting there is only one way we win this straight out and that's beat him in both in-person and mail in votes. It's possible. There will be suppression, obstruction, harassment, intimidation but we can do this. #Biden  #Biden2020
Rashida Tlaib declines to back Biden amid tough House reelection fight: report
I don't care how much you don't like Joe Biden. If you don't vote for him this year, you are complicit in the destruction of our democracy. Trump needs to go NOW.
Biden said that in 1989. 31 years ago why not talk about what he said about it 31 days ago. You are simply a reg hat goon spreading lies and disinformation.  You are the enemy. YOU
That's the point of a primary and debate! Show that you can throw some punches, land them and defend against attacks. "unfair and pre-planned" 🙄  If nothing else, she revealed a chink in Biden's armor that he should now be prepared for in the general - right?
im aligned with neither. what does that have to do with any of it? if not voting biden = voting trump, therefore not voting trump = voting biden. simple math bud. too hard for u?
Flashback to April: Joe Biden says Trump will seek to postpone the election. The Trump campaign called Biden’s claims “incoherent conspiracy theory ramblings.”
Good tweet. Helps keep Americans informed about how sick you are. It makes more and more Americans deciding to vote for Joe Biden for President.
nice projection. ur loterally aaying voting for trump is voting for biden somehow
Hey khive, I won’t vote for a ticket that includes Kamala, even IF Biden shapes up. Fuck around and find out!
wait how would voting for trump be a vote for biden hahahhaahahahahaha dude do u hear yourself? are you fucking serious? what fantasmatic level of thinking do you operate on? holy fuck dude please have the waltons hurt you? are they making u type this? pls leave the walmart sir
fact check  The former vice president said most of the demonstrators are “peaceful protesters” who aren’t a threat to be met by federal power. “Arsonists and anarchists should be prosecuted,” Biden said, but added that “local law enforcement can do that.  Wall Street Journal
Keep tweeting tweets like this. It helps more Americans make their decision to vote for Joe Biden.
.   So Biden was crazy to suggest Trump would seek to delay the election hey...  You must be a real high character individual to stand idly by and allow this to occur
Every time I get a text from the Biden campaign I answer it: Pick Liz.
You know what’s more likely than canceling the election? Biden wins decisively, but trump whines about imaginary fraud, so Biden unifies the country by instructing his electors to defect to trump, and democrats rejoice at such leadership and civility for the common good.
Or distract us from the 32% contraction in GDP.  That pretty much sealed the deal for him in November if you look at the cards.
actually if i dont vote for trump im helping biden
2020 Election Live Updates: Trump Floats Whether to ‘Delay the Election,’ Something He Cannot Legally Do
Nothing will stop me from voting for Biden. I quit the GOP because of you. I voted against you last time and I’ll do it again. Even if you infect me with your virus, I will do everything I can to hold on until I can vote Biden for the sake of everyone I love.
Trump on April 27: “I never even thought of changing the date of the election. Why would I do that? November 3rd. It’s a good number. No, I look forward to that election.”  He said Biden’s suggestion that he might attempt to delay it “was just made-up propaganda.”
dude I hate the fact that I'm going to vote for Biden but I will do anything in my power to get that man child out of office
White House Spiritual Advisor Blasts Biden’s Marijuana Policy Record - We Didn't Know That The President Actually Had Any Spiritual Or Religious Convictions Other Than For A Photo Op.  #Biden #Biden2020 #CannabisCommunity #marijuana #legalizeit

I remember Biden/Ryan.  Ryan was supposed to be "wonder boy" and Biden kicked his ass
Hey Suburban Voters, Joe Biden's Housing Policies Will Ruin Your Communities  #SuburbanitesAgainstTrump
Prediction: in 2022 GOP will launch investigations into Biden family’s role in Ukraine. They’ll never let up.
Hey Suburban Voters, Joe Biden's Housing Policies Will Ruin Your Communities
Vote Biden lose your suburbs Read the AFFH see what it really does.
You want top lose your suburbs? Vote Biden.
Alert: Biden will go on an apology tour. If you don’t like it, stop electing Rs that are so woefully inept they require an apology to the entire World.
Lol I think you meant Pedophile Biden
I'm still undecided as to whether I will leave the Presidential section on my ballot blank or if I'll vote for #JoeBiden----if Biden picks  or  for his VP, I'll vote for him....not sure how I feel about the rest of the VP candidates.
Coloradans and Americans need a President like Joe Biden. Joe understands how economic justice for all and a strong working class are key to our economy. Joe will make sure we have an economy that works for everyone.  It is with great honor that I endorse Joe Biden for President.
Susan Rice was the White House national security advisor when Hunter Biden struck lucrative deals overseas that raised red flags in several U.S. agencies.  It’s still unknown what she knew at the time and whether she discussed with the VP ⁦
Sedition in the Obama Oval Office?   Obama, Joe Biden, and their top intelligence officers huddled in the Oval Office shortly before Donald Trump was inaugurated to discuss what they would do about this new President they despised.   via
All Biden needs to do is sit back and watch this corrupt and incompetent administration implode. Silence is golden, as well as an effective strategy when your opponent is tanking.
Agreed, better to delete or point out.
It’s not real someone mixed in audio of  with this video.   However, Trump still stands and moves like an inebriated Sasquatch!
Trump would use this as ammunition for his whole Deep Fakes excuses... maybe better to just delete this crap!
Oh yeah it’s  I remember he did a comedy video impersonation exactly like this. Someone toon the audio from his video and used some digital effects to make it sound live and mixed it, this is fake please don’t retweet! Don’t let Trump claim Fake News!!!
It sounds a lot like that guy who does a great impersonation of Trump and is hilarious. I can’t remember his name at the moment but, even though I can’t stand Trump, I don’t think is real. Also, that funny guy didn’t make this either, it’s one of his existing impersonations.
Won't need to. President Trump will convince biden to take HCQ. That shows you how compassionate President Trump is.
Yes! Biden &amp; Mrs #BHO
I think it is very likely that Biden will lose. Dems might get the senate anyways, but those odds go down w/ Biden's polls.  is soooooo stubborn. They still haven't given me a reason to vote for Joe -- I'm a white senior college grad in suburbs
But if it's happening now under Trump already.... What's the difference?  We had Biden as VP for 8 years already, but this all didn't start getting this crazy until Trump... Weird. 🤷
AOC Puts Biden &amp; Party Ahead of People!  via
Also, isn’t Biden considering only serving one term? I know that was an off the record rumor, so maybe BS, but rap for Biden, you want someone ready &amp; willing to follow him.   Doesn’t mean I’m certain that Harris is it (I like her, but...). But this is a dumb line of attack.
Hey,   Morning inspiration: Dem House + Dem Senate + Trump  Wouldn't that be fun? I'll get just as much of what I want as a progressive from this set up as I will if Biden if the f______g president?
Why should I vote for Biden? He doesn't support M4A, defunding the police, free college/debt forgiveness, green energy or low income housing.  He supports Corporations. I hate  more than Trump.  He's insane,  has no such excuse.
We had that with Biden and I know he’ll pick someone that fits that description. Kamala Harris fits that description.
Trump vs. Biden: Where they stand on health, economy, more
Let's just call them Biden Bronards. IDK. They have no principles, so what do you expect?
Biden’s the real patriot when it comes saving American lifes
It was proven false biden supports defunding the police
Yeah, I mean you wouldn't want a former Vice President running for President! That's just crazy, right Vice President Biden?
The riots and violence is not Biden’s fault
Settlers for Biden!
This is such garbage. Let her live!
Bring it on and let’s see it!  I would buy tickets to watch the blood bath on a debate... exactly why thw Dems don’t want it!  It’s so sad to see what they are doing to Presidential Candidate Biden!  Abuse in many eyes!
No.  anyone but trump. Then it will work itself out. Vote biden please
I dont understand your point. Biden is as much of a jackwagon as trump is. Neither of the two major parties want change. If they did, things would have changed decades ago. You want to suggest a solution to our nations inequality problems or keep posting memes with no relevance?
RIGHT, its wild to me that biden is trying so hard to hand this election to trump!
There won't be a debate. Too dangerous. Not because of COVID but because of Biden's tendency to wander far off topic then say something ridiculously racist or otherwise offensive.
Joe Biden is a pedophile, if you support him you are also a pedophile.
Settling for Biden like I'm a wannabr 1950s housewife ho yeah
Joe Biden has already committed to selecting a VP candidate who is a non-white woman. Why is nobody calling that racist and sexist? He has essentially eliminated ~83% of viable candidates right off the bat. Imagine in 2024 if a POTUS candidate vowed early to pick a white male VP!
I don't know if any of that is true but I will 💯 save it and use it when the next MAGAt brings up Biden's health.
It's as if every male Vice President in history didn't have ambition for the Presidency, including, well, Joe Biden...
You’d think dems would agree Kamala Harris becoming next POTUS after Biden would be a GREAT thing... such hypocrites.
Of course, Biden hasn’t “vaulted” at all - he has ALWAYS polled far ahead.   In contrast, Memorial Day 4 years ago, Trump was polling ahead. At no time has Trump ever polled close to Biden let alone been ahead.  If &gt;50% of voters say they’ll NEVER vote Trump, it’s hard to win.
What a fake, just like his dumb ass brother on CNN.  Why can’t Democrats just admit that masks are useless, and it’s a ploy to agitate and scare the public for as long as possible and keep Biden off the debate stage.  Admit it!
Let’s just wait and let President-Elect Biden weigh in on this first.
“He doesn’t have to win the election. He just has to create a plausible narrative that he didn’t lose.” (Correction: It doesn't need to be plausible. Nothing in his alt reality is plausible yet his cult buys it no matter what.)
Don't spend it all in one place now lol
Whoo hoo!!!! New friends. #Resist bitches!
Wasn't that bizarre? You're right, he seemed happy about it. Great timing, just as the eviction moratorium ends!   Still, I wouldn't put it past Biden and  to yet find a way to blow this election. Remember 2016?
So he supports illegal immigration? So Biden is for no immigration laws and 100% open borders! #Ludicrous
Weekend at Biden’s
Where are their masks? Didn’t Biden recently state that he would have a national mandate to require every American were a mask? #Hypocrite
i just feel us all going down this exact same path again. Their campaign is moving. And if you want to talk about a "bunker bitch" well, Biden hasn't really been anywhere to be found. If he was formidable he'd be on tv every single day.
Texas would be dead without Trump. The O&amp;G hub of the world would be decimated under a Biden win. You care for your state, you want a job, you like your standard of living? Then you must vote👇
Biden needs to pick the person he believes will help him best get the job done - a herculean task, to say the least. And yes, that means taking the feelings of his constituency into account - but it can't be the only factor.
*presumptive*....the VP candidate will take his place by Election Day. Biden won’t cognitively make it until 11/4. Back room Dems will install who THEY want to be President. The most corrupt election cycle we have ever seen. Dems are short circuiting the entire process
Without thinking, I immediately assumed this was about Biden - oops!
You can see in the window its Biden for  Iowa, its from last year.
Mr. Biden has made a good step, yes — but I suspect his vice presidential pick and most of his cabinet won’t follow through even a little bit.
I mean dude the Bush era right is literally rallying around biden. Liberals are slowly making excuses to move right. It’s insane.
#Biden  LOOK AT THIS ! HE HAS TO BE LED AROUND !  IF ELECTED HE WILL BE REMOVED BY THE 25th AMENDMENT AND THE VP WILL BE IN !
Allegations. I never claimed Trump diddle kids, you assert without any facts or knowledge that Biden is a pedophile. He hasn't even had a lawsuit for any sexual misconduct brought against him or allegations. So where is your proof ?
Her ambition and brains are exactly why Biden will choose her. He is smart enough to know that he needs that balance.
I voted for Mr. Biden in the Democratic primary. However, I remain uncommitted for the general election.
All of these amazing women will be needed in the Biden administration.
God you make me want to puke. Right now we have TWO choices.  1- trump (or whatever lackey replaces him) on the march to a Dictatorship. Then you progressives are truly fucked. 2- Biden who has agreed to work with Bernie and Warren.  Quit being so God damn melodramatic.
#IngrahamAngle  running for president is a marathon run and I do not think Biden can finish the run
I like that.   Linda Sarsour is saying that Biden is an opponent we would rather have then Trump but it is also true that Chuck and Nancy wouldn't have anyone to blame.
Totally agree John. I didnt want to say it because God forbid something should happen, Biden is 77.  So with out saying it, I feel most comfortable with a Sen Harris or Susan Rice. They are both ready now.
It’s shit like this that makes me really worried if biden actually wins tbh
Lol it’s not like she would asassinate him. Who cares if she wants to be POTUS after Biden?!
I'm not claiming anything. Do you want the lawsuits ? You're the one saying Joe Biden is a pedophile so I ask where is your evidence?
Pretend that's you out there protesting president Biden's new law forcing you to become vegan and worship Islam. Do you still have no problem with cops violently assaulting you, running you over, gassing you, and imprisoning you w/o charge?
Biden Allies Try to Derail Kamala Harris Pick
Joe Biden has promised to pick a woman as his running mate. Political experts predict he'll choose someone much younger and more energetic than he is in order to provide balance. "Ladies and gentlemen, Vice President Ruth Bader Ginsburg!"
Sen Kamala Harris is ambitious, and by all rights should be. To be honest, as a voter supporting Joe Biden,  I feel the most comfortable with a VP that is ready to be president.
I'm not and Weinstein was convicted as he should of been, Spacey is facing charges. Clinton, Kennedy cheated on their wives and have different sexual fetishes doesn't make them criminals. Bill Cosby should be locked up and their was evidence against him. What do you have on Biden
I would not vote for biden in any other election. But fuck he’s not making it any easier.
Ever since Biden sewed up the nomination, I thought Kamala Harris was the right choice for VP. Those saying she is too ambitious can stuff it.
He hasn't. Neither has Biden. I can show you where Trump paid of a porn star
'It's absolutely serious': Susan Rice vaults to the top of the VP heap
#IngrahamAngle  I see no Trump yard signs or Biden yard signs for obvious reasons, no one wants to become a senseless victim
They are fighting for Joe Biden. They nees the buildings shut down through the election so they cannot be used as voting places
Madonna would work too. Just saying. ;)   Republicans Salivate Over Possibility Joe Biden Might Pick Susan Rice For Vice President
Not sure. But Biden can drink a glass of water with one hand like a big boy, and walk down a ramp by himself, so he has that going for him.
They want Biden to win. That’s what this is about. Keeping schools, parks, Rec centers closed so voting places cannot be set up.
Facebook started banning me, censoring me and shadow banning me after I came out vocally against Joe Biden.  I was going to vote as follows: 1. Bernie Sanders 2. Andrew Yang 3. Tulsi Gabbard 4. Now I'm voting Trump
And what proof do you have of Biden being a pedophile? Or any of the people you have accused of being a pedophile? Keep to the boy scout leaders and the Catholic Church at least there is evidence for those sick bastards
Twitter is an echo chamber for all the idiots who are going to vote for Biden while diddling the Democrats.
#Hannity  Would not surprise me one bit that Biden does not make it to Nov 3rd
#Hannity  the Dem plan is to make things so bad the voters will vote for Biden hoping it will be better than Trump
WHY DO YOU HATE MY CHOICE FOR BIDEN'S VP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Guaranteed that guy is voting for Biden.
Biden will win Texas
Stop pretending like we don’t all know Biden’s VP will 100% end up being the president if he wins the election.  If people wanted President Harris, they would’ve given her more than zero votes in the primaries.
WATCH: Google CEO Squirms as Jim Jordan Asks if Google Will 'Tailor Its Features' to Help Joe Biden
I'm all in for Harris... But at the end of the day it won't matter. I'm #AmericaOrTrump , which means Biden can pick an unknown and I'll still vote for him. There are no other choices.
There are plenty of reasons to not support Harris as VP - I think there are legit criticisms to level at her. This isn't one of them. What VP hasn't focused on becoming pres? Biden pledged to be a one-term president, so... if his term goes halfway decently it would make sense.
i have doubts there will be history to look back on... meaning we are heading right for a cliff (global collapse of our food system due to climate change) and trump is hitting the gas, while biden is fiddling with the radio.
Some very Biden or Pete tier platitudes here
I've been gone for hours only to come back to a wall of naysayers talking about set backs, Biden losing November, and saying today was disheartening for our country.  I don't know what I missed, but fuck that shit!   We don't have time for that nonsense! Get it together people!!
Particularly when much of Biden's core message is based on the idea that the current president values loyalty to HIM over loyalty to the country. What bullshit complaints, these are.
This just in, The ghost writer of Joe Biden’s tweets used to write “daily affirmations”
Joe Biden’s climate bet: putting jobs first will bring historic change
They care about the debt again because they are getting ready to lose. They’ll be back to fiscal conservatism to fight Biden after eating at the Trump trough for the last 4 years piling up debt.
If Biden picks John McCain's corpse to be his VP I'm still voting for Biden.
. Thank you. We no longer have to worry about Obama’s evil AFFH rule to destroy our neighborhoods.  Biden has promised to continue Obama’s AFFH if elected.  We will re-elect #Trump2020
"Biden allies" is apparently 3 guys that CNBC sought after.
Rose Twitter is getting triggered already at the prospect of a Kamala Harris VP. Which is weird because they said they're not voting for Biden so why should they even give a fuck?
Because the Democrats want to win the next election. There will be no good news, efforts to use HCQ or any other drug until Joe Biden is elected. The media is complicit. COVID will be lied about until Trump loses
with Stanely Kurtz explains these details of how the Obama, Biden program would have destroyed neighbors and suburbs nation wide.
AFFH would have destroyed communities nation wide. Taken away the the single family home as it was designed to do under OBAMA, Biden. Stanley Kurtz  Ethics Public policy.
The reason this won't work is republicans have been telling us for years that they're all the same -- corrupt.  Even if Americans think that maybe the Obama administration did something wrong, they'll figure Trump is way worse and Biden will be better for America!
It would be good to incorporate some of those moderate Rs into the Dem party in Texas and FL. A few would do it. Biden would be the guy to create the entrance ramp, but I don't know how he would do it.
As far as Biden's legacy, if he can defeat Trump and lead to the 1st woman President, that's darn good.
And  supports Biden’s plan (which is really just  plan). Bad for Coloradans and all Americans. #COPolitics
I would like to save this kind of energy for the other side
Who gives a rats ass what Biden does. The guy is a faker. Nothing wrong with him,. It is a dodge to keep him from answering questions.
Well apparently it’s going to be President Harris anyway, I don’t give Biden 3 months in office if he wins.
This Was John Lewis' Final Message To Joe Biden | HuffPost
Biden is not the best. That doesn’t mean we should leave the worst stay in office.
Why is this a bad thing?  Biden is a weak candidate and the best thing he can do for the country is pick a strong, young, VP to carry the torch in four years
Get educated and try to understand the words you’re saying before shoving them into other people’s ears. If anything, Biden is not even left of the spectrum. He’s moderate as best if not a little right.
That was the Biden porridge that you have taken. GREAT JOB!!
So yeah, time tell the swing voters to fuck themselves. What do we really have to lose? You think Biden is going to fix anything? Why didn't Obama do anything about the DHS? 8 years of letting it slide so he could pass a health insurance company subsidy. Fucking thanks.
Mind games forever..... Republicans Salivate Over Possibility Joe Biden Might Pick Susan Rice For Vice President
Whatever he decides.  His campaign effort has been aces so far.
If Biden knows what to do why hasn't he done it in the past 40 plus years he has been in Government? 😂
A POS is what MAGAT's voted for. I'm happy to inform all  the people living their Suburban Lifestyle Dream you will no longer be bothered/financially hurt by having low income housing built in your neighborhood crime will go down. I've rescinded the Obama-Biden AFFH Rule. Enjoy!
Joe Biden ads at the gym 🤮
So, shut down American Coal and Pander to the Chinese to enrich themselves? Sounds typical Biden! Didn’t he make Millions from them already? He’s a Tool, isn’t he? Wow! And losing his mind won’t help him to even enjoy ALL the Filthy Lucre he’s made at exploiting American workers!
- Trump trails Biden by 10%.   - Only issue Trump wins on is handling economy, which is the 2nd most important issue for voters, behind the pandemic.   - 70% support voting by mail, though 60% believe ballots will be sent to deceased voters and to old addresses (integrity?)
Biden is faking his illness.
Im losing faith in Biden.
Fossil fuels are killing our planet. Biden wants to train workers for the future in renewable energy. You want to keep citizens in coal mines.  #Biden
With an opponent defeating themselves the way trump is, it would make sense to push for more things in your agenda like M4A, cancelling student debt, and raising taxes on the ultra wealthy to pay for it. Instead Biden is campaigning on “nothing will fundamentally change”
If it gets you out of office I’m good with that.  We’ll have Biden fix it later!
Whoever becomes the vice president will hopefully replace Biden in 4 years, regardless.
Not excited about Joe Biden? Not excited that you may not like his VP pick? Then grit your teeth and vote for for him anyway or it will be another very exciting and horrible 4+ years.
Idk AfQ Cheney was selected bc of gravitas (which W lacked &amp; Biden doesn't; latter needs vibrance, youth). Also..
I’m waiting for the market to turn down right before election. Will be a lot of talk saying Biden is winning or neck and neck. That’s the time to load up. When Trump wins, the markets will rocket again. Think about how many times Americans have voted for another pres after 4 yrs.
So ... maybe a politics editor shouldn’t plan to take a Christmas vacation? 😭
That's ageism.  Stop with that.
Oil &amp; gas are life blood of the US economy &amp; necessary to the recovery! How does Biden plan to pay for AOC's Green New Deal or Bernie's socialist agenda? TAX INCREASES! I don't know about you but I have enjoyed the lower tax rates these past 3 years. It's my money not giverments!
Kamala hasn't stopped being my number 1 pick for VP, but I'm not picking.  Joe is and I'm behind his choice.
#LittleDonnieDictator, #FatNixon, is jealous as hell of Obama and Biden and Fauci.
#NobodyLikesTrump Just a joke of a frail, sniveling loser. Vote Biden 2020 &amp; let’s make this country BETTER!!
Biden’s your guy, not ours.
MSM getting in their last digs for creating chaos and clickbait before Biden announces his VP. Dissent is natural and groups of people are like herding cats. I wouldn't worry about this.
Biden is LITERALLY A FORMER VP EYEING THE PRESIDENCY Jesus Christ these people
Biden Proposes Federal Aid To Help States Expunge Marijuana Records  #Biden2020 #Marijuana #CannabisCommunity #LegalizeIt
Trump is warning white suburbanites that Biden wants low-income Americans to move into their suburbs and that they will hang out in the back seat of their Cadillacs eating steak and a can of beans for dinner while listening to Tupac Shakur with the volume all the way up.
Yeah because trump will be treating biden with kids gloves (because of his tiny hands) and wouldnt ever make the claim that "biden is beholden to the far left" even now without him doing anything left.
Biden slams Trump for promoting false COVID-19 claims from 'crazy woman'
Especially when they are telling you to get over your policies and vote for biden. They are literally screaming "it's my way or the highway" and when we choose the highway, they are offended.
Alright, we need to work on this. You have had “Sleepy” for way too long. You could try Average Joe Biden? Or... Generic Joe Biden? Or... Sour Cream and Ranch Joe Biden?  Ask Fauci, he seems plugged in to the words the kids are using.
Biden wants to arrest me because of my political ideology...
I'm not voting for biden either way, dont worry.
So, is it like right after Biden's inauguration that they take  into custody or will we have to wait a few days?
Great work again, Joe. After your questioning of Barr yesterday I was ready to suggest you be the next AG under Biden. Now you’re looking like a Secretary of Commerce. Or are you thinking higher? Keep up the great work. You do your homework.
In Biden’s basement.
The girl is literally guiding Biden, hanging on to him! Can you imagine if that was Trump?!?!
Shut the fuck man 🤨like honestly you care about he left so much why like honestly biden doesn’t say shit like this
And that new path begins when Joe Biden is elected!
Is it too late for #JoeKelly to be Biden’s vp? That pouty face might get my vote. Wonder what face he’d give Putin.
This guy and Sleepy Joe Biden should never operate a vehicle together! 😳😳😳
I like her too, although you don't have to particularly like her to notice the sexism here
Biden was VP and now he wants to be President = well qualified  Kamala Harris as VP might later want to be President = overly ambitious, opportunistic, ugh can't stand her
Got a text from the #biden campaign asking if I wanted to spend some time with Joe &amp; Liz Warren   I replied no but I'd like to spend time with Joe and VP nominee #KamalaHarris   #BidenHarris2020 #KHive #VoteBidenToSaveAmerica
Y'all belive this?
VP BIDEN looks incredible in this clip thank you
I think Biden is pretending he is ill just to dodge hard questions.
It will take years and the asshole will be gone in 97 days so Biden will reverse it.
#TheFive The Dems plan is to make it so bad for the voters hoping that they blame Trump and they resort to Biden
I still think Joe Biden is pretending he is ill.
I mean, so what? Homie should be a one-term president, max (not that she's my first choice)
That's a part of it yeah. Obama placed Biden in charge of our withdrawal from the ME too, but we are still there. That "war" was based on a lie. A lie that as VP he should've known. Obama started 5 different conflicts while in office, do you know how many trump has started?
can't wait to glue humongous joe biden chompers onto bob odenkirk
Exactly. If someone wants to say something nice about their favorite VP candidate, whoever it is, no need to try to cut them down. Here, “If you can’t say something nice, don’t say anything at all” applies. Biden’s not picking a running mate based on Twitter comments. 🤷🏼‍♂️✌️😷
The only way Biden gets my vote is if HRC is his VP pick!
His Freudian slip is showing.
If Biden is committing to only serving one term, then wouldn't he *want* a VP who's ready and willing to take the mantle in four years?
wonder if Joe Biden will tell her on live TV that she wont be VP either
Are you sure they’re Biden allies⁉️ This sure stinks of Trump/Putin‼️‼️
So you admit that biden is right wing?
they will vote Biden in November
Please show where Biden is forcing Islam on schools! That’s the same sort of bullshit Chris Wallace called putting Trump on regarding defunding police. Why are religious zealots also the biggest agitators in misrepresenting the truth. Perhaps because the truth is inconvenient!
p.s. take down the “blm or bust” from your handle coz if you’re voting Biden&amp;shaming others 4not when he’s a racist who drafted the 94 crime bill, is responsible4mass incarceration, modern day slavery, refuses 2end qualified immunity&amp;legalize weed!
And an especially hypocritical one when they’re supporting Joe Biden.
Trump is losing 2020 Welcome President Joe Biden
Honestly, the presidential election is where your vote counts least, especially bc of electoral college.   More important are who are you congressmen and senators, and how did you vote for local laws and referendums.   Biden’s got my vote bc I hate Trump, not bc I like him.
Where did you answer how biden will change anything? Or that he wants to arrest people who think like me? You are a LIAR! Stop LIEING!
Please provide evidence of this claim that prices will quadruple under a Biden led United States.  Feels... somewhat exaggerated
Okay biden bro
I highly doubt  or  are phone banking for biden...

I wouldn’t be surprised if Trump supporters being polled are lying and saying they’re voting for Biden to skew polls just to “own the libs”
Like I said just keep resting on those laurels. From what I've heard biden has the same team helping him as hillary did. Hopefully biden will campaign in the midwest, that was a major factor in her loss.
It’s not like Biden’s going to run for a second term

Only Biden’s inauguration can stop it
We should have four parties. Trump - Romney - Biden - Sanders. Sad that the list is all white men, but it’s the US so.   A bunch of other countries have four parties and make it work.
No fault lies on Biden though, who is actually just a moderate Republican masquerading as a Democrat. Yes, let me vote for someone that literally offers nothing to earn my vote, and even campaigns against the policies over 75%  of the country supports.
Oh look! They took Biden’s husk out for a walk
Sometimes you have to admit biden doesnt either.
Lol #BlueMAGA thinks they are morally superior while supporting biden
Why do neoliberals think anyone that cant stand biden for being a rapist and rapist think they would support trump. Use your brain I'm sure you are smarter than that!
Yep trump is bad. That does not address ANY of the bad things about biden.
It just goes to show they had planned for and expected Bernie to win, so all their attacks are wayyyy off. Biden is as close to a socialist as Bush.
Just Remember, on July 27th 2016 the RCP Average Poll had Hillary up by 6.7,  Biden is up now by only 8.  This is far from over and I will say right now Trump will end up crushing Biden. #DurhamIsComing
We are going broke because of trump not Germany. So he should go first. Am I right?  Vote Biden!
yes, we will see so many things come out about his crimes and corruption over the next couple of months. whatever lies he says about Biden and the Dems will be completely overshadowed by his factual crimes that he has committed.
As a former Portlander, I agree with Joe Biden 100%.  1) Feds need to back off in Portland 2) Portlanders protesting need to be peaceful and not destructive  Both need to happen.
How in the world do people support that old creep?  Rephrased it for Biden:  How in the world do people support that old creep?
Yeah right, because the 150K deaths because the ineptitud of your genius shows what??? Looks like the corruption doesn’t bother the corrupt 🤢🤢🤢 any day Biden is a decent person and that is a change
and then there's Jim Jordan......."Are you planning on not helping Joe Biden campaign?"  A circus, every fucking hearing with these clowns.
Biden and Dems Are Set to Abolish the SuburbsWhat and be replaced with plugs Biden won’t happen.
Some advice to team Biden - get this shit under control. It’s undermining your appearance of leadership. And if you’re going to have a cabinet that looks like America why not your VP vetting team?
Postpone the Election? That Could Mean President Biden  via
Lol, so he thinks California is really in doubt pending VP pick. He can’t possibly be that stupid. Even considering he is Joe Biden.
this also applies to the prinzipulled leftys who feel it necessary to spend all of their time on here letting everyone know that they hate biden and aren't voting. we fucking get it already talk about something else there's a million hundred other things going on in the country
True. But then why does anyone listen to any politician re: "govt created jobs"? I guarantee as soon as Biden is President there will be any number of Rs deriding him for "failing to create jobs".
Oh, haven’t you heard?  Trump executed him with Bill, Hillary, Tom Hanks, Rita Wilson, Biden, and a few hundred others. Those are doubles you see now.
Indeed.  It’s a bad choice but clearly Biden is better
Any chance you want to comment about Biden observation around 4/24 that Trump will want to delay the election?  Made Biden look like Nostradamus.
No worries everytime Biden opens his mouth he puts his foot in it.
Right MN is Trumps fault, so tired of Obama/Biden political BS
Jason, millions of folks believe Trump is the worse President in history and a lying criminal. When asked about Biden’s qualifications to be President, you replied “better than Trump”. That’s quite the endorsement!  Biden’s better than a criminal.
I think they will respond either way, unless Biden commits to Medicare 4 all, open Borders, abortion until birth, defunding the police, student loan forgiveness and universal income, they are going to riot.
Offset by the many republicans who will vote for Biden. You’re boy just ain’t that popular.
Are you scared? Americans already know...Joe Biden wins!
Why wasn’t Biden there, he’s the nominee, not Obama? He’s the one who should have spoke.
The Marxist puppet Biden will never debate President Trump.
It was a Democrat rally since they are having to go virtual next month. Where was Biden?
Why didn’t Biden speak, he’s the Democrat nominee? This was a racist, partisan rant at an honorable mans funeral. Gross
8 years Obama/Biden administration and between the two of them they never accomplished crap.
So is Biden next with his political rally speech, oh wait he was in his basement this morning. Why wasn’t he a speaker, he’s the Democrat nominee?
They have to keep Flynn quite until after the election, he knows far to much about the Obama/Biden corruption
…can't even land on platforms like    ✔️ Democrats don't support pedophilia (Remember IT WAS BIDEN who proposed #VAWA &amp; got it passed into law. Do you think #HumptyDumptyDonaldTrump would do THAT??)   Now #STFU &amp; SAY THE NAMES of those NEEDLESSLY MURDERED BY POLICE
.   So Biden was crazy to suggest Trump would seek to delay the election hey...  You must be a real high character individual to stand idly by and allow this to occur
Agreed, better to delete or point out.
It’s not real someone mixed in audio of  with this video.   However, Trump still stands and moves like an inebriated Sasquatch!
Trump would use this as ammunition for his whole Deep Fakes excuses... maybe better to just delete this crap!
Oh yeah it’s  I remember he did a comedy video impersonation exactly like this. Someone toon the audio from his video and used some digital effects to make it sound live and mixed it, this is fake please don’t retweet! Don’t let Trump claim Fake News!!!
It sounds a lot like that guy who does a great impersonation of Trump and is hilarious. I can’t remember his name at the moment but, even though I can’t stand Trump, I don’t think is real. Also, that funny guy didn’t make this either, it’s one of his existing impersonations.
We had that with Biden and I know he’ll pick someone that fits that description. Kamala Harris fits that description.
I would not vote for biden in any other election. But fuck he’s not making it any easier.
Well apparently it’s going to be President Harris anyway, I don’t give Biden 3 months in office if he wins.
That was the Biden porridge that you have taken. GREAT JOB!!
Not excited about Joe Biden? Not excited that you may not like his VP pick? Then grit your teeth and vote for for him anyway or it will be another very exciting and horrible 4+ years.

I wonder if he said this because VP BIDEN called him out yesterday about not being prepared to distribute the VACCINE rapidly when it’s available?
You are the voice of reason and calm! Riden with Biden! 💙💙💙
Joe Biden is not a Radical! If you think he is, you’re stupid like Trump!
The DNC manipulated the electoral process. Election reform must be addressed. I agree the Dems need to find a way to walk back Biden. Republicans need to walk back Trump.
The Dems put on another media event for political propaganda purposes. They never intended to have a hearing. We get all this BS from the Marxist Democrats, while Biden hides in his basement. Biden’s a disgrace to himself and the  country that he fleeced for 45 years.
Joe Biden's competence isn't a question   Nice parrot though but try again
You're irrelevant and Biden will lose lol.
You turned your serious piece on COVID19 into a get-Trump political hit piece. Subtle digs at the Trump admin turned into typical mainstream media propaganda. Jon Karl was almost gleeful. Nice pix of Biden too. U R corrupt. #mondaythoughts
Absolutely and an excuse to get Biden out of debates
America will be GREAT with Biden as POTUS and Trump in jail!
You spelled Biden wrong..
I'm convinced this should be Biden's opening line of the first debate
I really can’t think of anything that could be revealed about Biden that would change my mind to not vote for him. Trump is so vile, unworthy and unprepared to be president. There’s little chance of major skeletons in Biden’s closet after his long tenure in public life.
Biden‘s limited press conference today  looked like an elderly patient in an assisted living facility being spoon fed soft food.  Not one tough question and the cadence in his voice made it seem like there was someone in his ear telling him what to say.
Biden calls on predetermined questions.  What a loser!
Joe Biden should NOT debate Trump. Debating a pathological liar who relies on outrageous conspiracy theories to galvanize a rabidly bigoted base is harmful to America's best interests.  #NoDebateNeeded  #NoDebateNeededLetsVote
Biden doesn’t even wipe himself, he has no clue what this tweet is even about.
Totally disagree, I think there's a lot of people that will vote for Biden just because who he chooses, especially if it is a black woman, she will likely bring together a huge part of the voters that is needed to end this dictatorship. America needs a woman And of color for VP
No body asked for his stupid gestapo to begin with. Face it. He isn’t rebuilding shit. Biden will rebuild EVERYTHING he broke in his 4yrs the same way Obama had to fix EVERYTHING W broke and that just hurts fragile little republican egos.
Not sure Joe Biden really IS in the race at this point... Sure seems to be a placeholder is all...
A school in TX, Florida or SD are the only States that will allow a debate. Biden probably won’t show up, but they can ask Trump questions and Biden’s handlers will send in written answers.
Make no mistake about it, the New Socialists are Marxists who are in bed with the CCP in China. Obama, HRC and Biden all profited from their cozy relationship with the CCP.
Good luck, Chris Wallace. Unlike President Trump, Biden is hiding in plain sight. He and his puppeteers are afraid that his incompetence will be revealed more than it already has been. Vote Trump and Republican in November.
Joe Biden’s public persona is far from the one portrayed by Robert Redford in the 1972 movie “The Candidate.” Biden’s portrayal of his candidacy is much closer to Lawrence Harvey’s 1962 portrayal of “The Manchurian Candidate.” As Shakespeare said it, “All the world’s a stage.”
Why does yet another septuagenarian white guy have any say in this at all? Ffs Biden.
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
I agree! He got one from President Bush but given the current air at WH I don't see current pres doing it or not making it seem phony. Biden should once in office.
Biden’s puppeteers are keeping him locked in his storage box in the basement of the mansion in Delaware that he built while feeding at the public trough for nearly 50 years. Vote Trump and Republican in November. Drain the swamp of corrupt Democrats.
No contest in the match up of Biden vs Trump. Biden’s a loser every time. He couldn’t even win the Democrat nomination in 2016 over Crooked Hillary. Vote Trump and Republican in November. Save our constitutional republic from the Manchurian Candidate and his socialist agenda.
Biden is a no-show physically and mentally. Vote Trump and Republican in November.
Trump Tailors Conflicting Ads to Blacks, Whites on Biden Record  no surprise the trump campaign has to use negative advertising because there are no good things to say about the clown they are trying to promote.
Basement Biden?  Where you been Rudy you waiting to release your Ukraine horseshit soon we know you have the goods on Biden bahaha haha
Just less of them.   Biden supporters don't need to jump up and down screaming WHITE POWER to be heard in November.
Biden’s America
Pelosi is beginning to look like the Marxist Apparatchik that she’s become, as she runs cover for Biden’s and Nadler’s screw-ups. Vote Trump and Republican in November. Take back the House and Senate. Make America Great Again.
It’s the party of peace, Democrats and Biden supporters who want to destroy our country, sicking group
Biden voters will destroy America, they are criminals and promote this behavior
You mean the Democrat rioters and Biden supporters who have been looting, smashing windows, lighting fires, shooting people, the destruction of the US is all on your party!
Repeat after me:   Pro-fracking means you support man made earthquakes.   Joe Biden said he will ban fracking, killing man made earthquake jobs across PA.
Pennsylvania is going to turn blue for Biden in November. The silent majority is strong there.
There is no Muslim ban. There was a ban from terrorist hot spots that have no real functioning government. So Biden is saying he’s going to end that ban? Seems kinda stupid.   So Biden’s security plan is to defund police and let in terrorists. Remember that when you vote.........
succession but with joe biden
Biden is a chicken 🐓. Vote Trump and Republican in November.
Biden and his handlers are afraid to expose Biden’s level of cognitive impairment to the public any more than his declining mental functions have already been revealed. The Democrats ought to be ashamed of running him as their candidate. He’s clearly a Manchurian Candidate.
Now do Joe Biden...
I posted that yesterday. Biden supporters will have to wear blue MAGA hats.
trump can’t “DEFINE” Joe Biden as a EVIL WOMAN or a SECRET MUSLIM, so he’s decided to make every DEMOCRAT his opponent.  But if he loses, it won’t be because he didn’t get enough VOTES, it’s because TOO MANY AMERICANS were allowed to vote in his opinion
You mean some one who cares about our safety and property?   Biden looks at the violent protestors as his base and hasn’t said a peep.
Rigged eh? You mean like having Kanye West run to pull votes away from Biden? That kind of Rigged?
We need you!!!    Save us by joining Joe Biden as his Vice President.
AND THEY ALL FALL DOWN. Poor Donald can’t BEAT JOE BIDEN, so he’s running against these imaginary “PUPPETEERS”? He’s a sad morbidly obese man
But Wallace is a Democrat so he would give Biden softball questions, there really is no reason Biden should not let Wallace interview him unless he has something to hide.
Registered and waiting for my mail in ballot so I can vote for Biden
Jake is biased, encourage Biden to let Wallace interview him, he’s your candidate. PS, the Intel Community  never confirmed the reports which is why Trump was never told.
Biden campaign declines 'Fox News Sunday' interview, 1 week after Chris Wallace's Trump sitdown   No surprise
I do think that biden is going to win but also the fact that everyone has just resigned to that being the reality and no one seems to have a plan b in case of a trump upset is uhh... alarming
progressives can't even get a senate candidate nominated and we're still doing the "_______ 2024" thing like a left challenge to biden('s vp) would be anything other than a huge waste of resources at this point
Dear god no. I saw what she did when I lived in SF Bay Area. I know a lot of people who won’t vote for Biden if he picks het
Headwinds?  What headwinds?  What does that say about Biden?
Crazy Me said Myself made a mistake when I banned people from infected China from entering the U.S. in January.   Turns out it made no difference as Me, Myself &amp; I all FAILED to act to stop the spread of #Coronavirus   Because of that, we all have Biden wanting to overthrow us
Ohh you mean like  does??   Well at least  doesn't have HIS PHONE surgically attached to HIS HAND   Biden can ACTUALLY PUT HIS PHONE DOWN 🤣😂
Biden/Bernie supporters
The problem is it’s all Democrats and Biden’s supporters who are starting the fires, looting, shooting people and want to defund the police. They are so stupid and vile that they can’t control themselves and find a way to become a member of society

Yes I can't wait to Mark the Spot for Biden😷
Only 100 days until the people of Colorado vote to re-elect President  Senator  and Republicans across the state.   Coloradans know that Biden's socialist agenda would destroy jobs, raise taxes, and make us less safe. #LeadRight

JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
I will vote Biden for all of the solid reasons, but I am so looking forward to not having to see trump’s gawd awful combover, weave, plugged hair or whatever that shit is he calls hair, ever again at or near our White House.
Biden, the Manchurian Candidate, has no idea of what’s going on Portland. He’s hiding out in his basement in Delaware, while his strings are being pulled by the Marxist Democrats Sanders, Warren and AOC.
This is akin to someone putting a TRUMP yard sign in front of their home. It’s one sign in usually a street of 20-25 homes. I’m not a statistician, but that’s potentially 24 BIDEN VOTERS

I read someone else's comment that thinks it's BO, because there is no law against him being VP, now. But I didn't think it all the way through, like, what that would mean in February/March when "all of a sudden" Biden is unable to discharge the duties of his office.. 🤯🤯
PMT turned down an interview with Biden...not PFT.
When Biden wins we’ll have to wear blue MAGA hats.
Obama/Biden were made aware of Russia trying to interfere in our elections in 2015 and decided it wasn’t worth their time to take action
I’d be way more concerned about Biden winning and Democrats defunding the police.
For 45+ years Biden was in the Congress and served as Obama’s VP during which time he accomplished nothing. Now he want to be POTUS. Fool me once. Shame on you. Fool me twice. Shame on me. Vote Trump in November. Make America Great Again.
The Marxist Democrats in the US are in bed with their political brothers and sisters in the CCP in China and are likely getting paid to collude with them to elect Biden. Follow the money.
Biden has no plan. It’s his puppet masters who do.
Did you make a song for Joe Biden?
The Deep State in the FBI is slow moving this legal process, thinking that it will all go away if Biden wins the Presidential election in November.  And, they are right. Should the Dems win, America will be a lawless country with a Manchurian Candidate as President.
Biden promises to continue the Democratic Party's crusade against Catholics   is not a Catholic, he is not a man of faith!
Joe Biden is a puppet for the Marxist Democrats in Congress, including Sanders, Warren, AOC, and Pelosi who are being sponsored by the Communist Party in China. The CCP wants Biden to be POTUS.
Funny how Trump and his supporters started talking about Biden being in a "basement" after Trump literally hiding in bunker came out. Projection is typical for Trump, he accuses others of what he has done and hopes that people won't notice
I’m voting for him too.  If you want to see America fail vote for Biden and if Biden wins buy all the gold you can afford.
President Trump said tonight on Hannity that Biden is controlled like a puppet.
Woodrow Wilson was a Democrat and a well known elitist bigot. Biden has lost his game, if he ever had one.
What a PERFECT statement. "They are literally biding their time with Biden." 100%
Biden is a puppet for the Marxist Democrats in Congress who are controlled by the CCP in China. He is truly the first legendary “Manchurian Candidate.” Vote Trump and Republican in November. Save our constitutional democracy and our liberty. Make America Great Again

That’s a joke, he said he’s the first racist President, Biden is a racist with Dementia
Honestly, I  feel like both Biden and Trump are suffering from dementia or something of that sort. I wish that we had better options, but I can not vote for Trump this time around.
Housewives eh?  Will Biden prevent them from pleasing their man?
It’s literally Trump’s America lol he’s the current president and this shit is happening now. I’m still not voting for Biden, but let’s be honest with ourselves here.

Biden is simply a crook, having extorted  a fortune from the Ukraine and China with the help of his son, Hunter Biden. BTW: Where’s Hunter?
Just out of curiosity, you do realize socialism is the BIGGEST form of government?  You do realize “big spending” is nothing compared to socialism?  Joe Biden has already said he would get rid of Trump tax cuts for more big government!
AG, it’s obvious and completely clear that VP BIDEN is saying that trump referring to COVID-19 as the “Chinese Virus”, puts a TARGET 🎯 on the back of every ASIAN DECENT AMERICAN. His followers aren’t smart enough to distinguish the difference in their nationalities,how about you
The nurse must have been blowing pot smoke up Biden’s nose. He’s hallucinating.
Biden is one scary Dude, and the Marxist Democrats who are pulling his strings will destroy our constitutional republic and our liberty. Vote Trump and Republican in November.

I guess if I was a BETTING PERSON, given that the BIDEN CAMPAIGN wrote a Political Plan with the SANDERS CAMPAIGN, they aren’t looking to Senator Warren for IDEAS? That would of been their biggest opportunityJoe Biden is not for universal income.
Joe Biden has not authority to impact current legislation.
Our state senate election is basically minor league Trump v Biden. Hickenlooper is also a hack so there's not really a win here
No, i'm going where the evidence leads, which so far is all in his favor. if you can show some evidence to the contrary, show it. And please leave out hearsay, circumstantial, or indirect evidence, none of those prove guilt, unless you have direct proof to back up the above.
What and be replaced with plugs Biden won’t happen.
Once trump finds out that Biden VP is going to be a black women. Is trump going to have Pence do blackface with a dress on?
That's why Warren should be Biden's Veep choice.  She'd mop the floor with Pence and never need to raise her voice.
Karen Bass would be a disaster. With her on the ticket, Trump might be able to play his hail mary ‘law and order’ campaign just right enough to squeak through another win. It would be the dumbest thing Biden could do.
I'd vote for a big yellow dog over Trump for POTUS. VP? Who cares?  Conversation about it is just bull session fodder. If Spanky can make news with BS, so can Biden.
Harris calling out Biden during the debates is an argument FOR her to be the Veep … not against.  You need diversity of thought.  And you really need someone who understands what it is like to be both Black and a Woman!!
Oh my my my !!!! The latest in sad Liberal Socialist quantum arguing with those who are real Americans and are tired of Democrats base line to get Biden elected at any cost even utilizing Marxist orgs to do their bidding! Soooo - it’s MAGA TRUMP 2020 onward and upward! HOOORRRRA!
Will Joe Biden be rubbing her shoulders, making the rest of the nation cringe?
A lot of people thinks #Biden is just acting.
Oh jeez, not a Dem version of Sarah Palin - please god, no.  Biden needs to hit this one right down the middle of the fairway.  No wildcards, no surprises.
Not only is Max riding with Biden he’s with Ringo too!! Dump Trump!!

It's fascinating that Biden gets an intelligence briefing, right away tells his people to stop using Tik Tok, then like a week later Trump is like 'Oh $hit! People shouldn't use Tik tok!'
Do your research. Trump is not involved. Also, you haven’t answered my question, What has Joe Biden done for you or anyone for that matter?
Biden v. Trump is Democracy v. fascism.  There, fixed it for you.

Pretty sure joe biden doesnt give a flying fuck if you donate to him, that's what the billionaires are for,  and you've already pledged your vote. You have 0 leverage. Good luck with the tantrum though.

Not. One. Bit.
This is the most important hiring decision he will have to make.  Her qualifications will include strengths and experiences that complement his own.  Biden will work with this person daily, so there must be trust and connection.  He will choose wisely on our behalf.

Postpone the Election? That Could Mean President Biden  via
I know Biden is a few years older than Trump but he is much better health. If Trump can make it through a term, Biden can too. So maybe lets not worry about who the VP pick is that much.
What an asshole. Biden is not defunding the police. This is just one of the reasons why you're losing LYING

Biden’s Platform is ending the Rule of Law? And that’s a winner? Are Democrat voters that easily led around by their own blind rage and bruised 2016 egos? Such a simple herd
Counter-argument: Biden’s team is using the VP process to highlight incredible female leaders, some of whom have not had national attention.
Am I the only one that heard him on Stern back then?!
Their “power” goes to their head too much.
Biden will be running on the most progressive platform our party has put forth and I’m so happy about that 💙
I would think Biden's been around the block enough to know that's a bad idea. I have to think it's misdirection.
aka - “He’s not picking who she wants”
So, why doesn't trump put money into mail in voting instead of whining about it. Because their is zero evidence that their is fraud. Joe Biden Biden doesn't mind waiting for his winning results
Joe Biden will reform the police not defund the police. Get that straight you lying fascist pig.
I know nobody is really interested in my take but:  I am willing to vote for Biden bc he’s not Trump. If I can put my views aside, how come “professional and influential” people can’t?  That being said, bc of these actions  goes anyone but  I will not vote.
This is a classic no heroes situation—it’s clear from the way Biden’s team is talking that they hate her in nakedly racist and sexist ways, but also she sucks ass and would be an absolutely insane VP choice

We ended up with Trump v Hillary and now Trump v Biden because we've accepted the lesser of two evils paradigm.
A veep candidate with less national ambition could act more freely and more deferentially toward Biden. The “anointed front runner” baggage won’t be as heavy. These advantages could help Biden with his agenda without hurting the party’s prospects in 2024.

I hope he is recalled by President Biden and made a General.  He, and you, are truly American heroes!
Yup.  Also putting Biden in a tough spot - making it harder for him to NOT pick Harris if he decided he wanted to go a different route.
Kinda like the rupugnants videos of soon to be president Biden ?
Also Ro Khanna was big for Bernie. Sour grapes?
I think some vague stuff is being fomented because tRump and others are most afraid of Kamala as Joe’s running mate. Don’t listen! Don’t boo! Vote!

Clyburn to Biden: Put a stop to this shit
Right, I am a witness already in the primary. My wife got a ballot and not a citizen. She has a permanent residency card  that we pay 1000s of dollars to renew it every 10 years. I am glad she did that so if Biden gets elected I am moving to Europe. I was soo mad.
I think of Biden as being...not necessarily chaotic, but not predictable enough to keep up with paladin requirements. Maybe a tanky cleric?
I'm not a Kamala fan and think Warren, Demmings, or Castro would be the better picks but I almost want Biden to pick Harris and put all his old buddies out to pasture just to make a point.   I'm sure he won't, but I'd like to see it.
They hate the truth XDDDDDDDDD I love it i roll around in it like a field of flowers.
Every penny you dont donate to biden you are donating to trump.
also if china keeps screwing around, we might cut them off entirely, and not give them a cent anyway.
Wait, so Trump literally is friends with the horrible people. But then you say Biden is disqualified because he's in the same party as someone associated with the horrible people? Terrific stuff.
at this rate of increase however we will have little trouble repaying the debt.
if joe biden can run from beyond the grave so can our boy
voted for by dems who control the house.
I'm not "justifying" the law is the law, Trump didn't break it, so your opinion on the matter is irrelevant.
well when you lower taxes, and decrease regulations that means more wine, enough wine fills all glasses, that's the entire point of the trick.

Seriously stupid fucking people  New Yahoo News/YouGov poll: Most Trump voters say they will not accept the 2020 results if Biden wins because of mail-in ballots
We both know they aren't
facts
Trump is exonerated by the witness in your first doc
Truman, LBJ, Humphrey, Mondale, Gore, Biden: complete this sequence.
I wish Joe Biden was anywhere near as cool as you claim him to be.
The TV doesn't share facts, they push narratives. I get my information from court documents, science papers, and sources with weight, not dipshit talking puppets on tv like a pleb.
New campaign tack: “JOE BIDEN WILL LEAVE AMERICA DANGEROUSLY UNPREPARED FOR A PANDEMIC“
that's in the epstein case, the case where a girl was pressing charges was dropped, no evidence, no record to corroborate the claims, just claims.
again she was legally, and materially a woman. case closed.
Sternis the one saying she's hot, Trump's response is "you have to like freckles though"
The fake libertarian democrat op? no thanks, registered card carrying  libertarian, and i'm voting trump. We had our change with Ron Paul but the libtards blew it, Trump is the next best thing. Above all i will always vote for the most individualist candidate, collectivism sucks.
a few photo ops at expensive public gatherings is not proof Trump diddled kids.
He could run with a bag of sand as his running mate and I’ll STILL vote Biden
He said it last time and they showed up. We must vote for Biden.
Trump is mentioned by interviewer, witness denies ever seeing trump, and on page two which you didn't post clarifies that the only reason she thought they were friends is because epstein claimed they were.
Trump was mentioned by the interviewer, which the witness denies, read it again
proof of death threats? proof of incident? oh there is none, i've already looked at it, sorry but none of that proves anything, you're just jumping to conclusions that support your spoonfed orange man bad narrative
the only evidence they had any kind of friendship was from Epstein's mouth. Where's the proof he went to the island? Not in the unsealed documents, in fact they suggest the opposite according to an interview with one victim. You can only bring down someone with proof.
he didn't bring her up, listen again. the other guy brought her up, saying she was hot and all this, Trump sounds like he's uncomfortably trying to change subject.
Lol, so he thinks California is really in doubt pending VP pick. He can’t possibly be that stupid. Even considering he is Joe Biden.
I’m a progressive but Bernie Sanders people make progressives look bad. They honestly embarrass me ...
And Biden hats
Oh please tell me, an actual researcher how to do "research properly" Is it ignoring the record to feed a narrative that supports prior assumptions? because that's what you're doing right now.
Respect is earned not given, and besides that love is a truer virtue than respect which is transient and impersonal. I refuse to elect someone to manage a system on subjective grounds that is stupid, You would do that looking for a wife or a babysitter, not a president.
Overdramatic, Trump was the first to even desire to take action against CV, while Trump was imposing travel bans to infected areas, nancy was promoting trips to chinatown.
decreases in  taxation and regulation freeing up incentivising funds for business.
Biden is a Democrat. If you don't like the job he does, you can vote him out in 4 years. Trump is neither a Dem. nor a Rep. If he wins, there will not be a second chance. The gates of Auschwitz and the swatiska exploding at Nuremberg.
Obama's increases in taxation, and regulation crashed the economy, because that shit stifles small business, and restricts the flow of funds in the market. Happens every time a dem is elected. Only when Trump announced he was running to decrease taxes, and cut regs did it upturn.
Turn off the TV, Trump made his fortune contracting construction of suburbs, the man spawned entire industries, no on one off side projects the left keeps highlighting. Business has a luck factor, trump nets waay into the positive, and the proof is in his bank acct.
Trump is speculating about a Tilden/Hayes type election. But it won't be close. Biden will have +330 EC votes.
cw uspol  God I really hope his criminality catches up with him
this also applies to the prinzipulled leftys who feel it necessary to spend all of their time on here letting everyone know that they hate biden and aren't voting. we fucking get it already talk about something else there's a million hundred other things going on in the country
Duncan Hunter, not Hunter Biden. Two different people.
you guys are stretching making this about Trump, totally ignoring others who were proven involved. why are you ignoring proof for speculation, because your TV told you to? the same industry that has an employee get arrested for sex crimes every other week?
Enough already! We have to vote for Biden. So his VP is really inconsequential if you wanna keep America a democracy. Irony? Maybe. I prefer Kamala, but in the end, I prefer the slew of legislation to right America that we WON’T GET if we keep bitching about something/anything
They don't because they were dropped with no evidence. and proof he went to the island? The flight logs state he had a few hour connecting flight on one of his planes once on a business trip, no record of minors there either. No where do i see where he made a trip to the island.
For bad people, no. For the rest of us that work hard, and love our families, yes.
Newest polls show Biden leading by 8pts. I truly don’t get it.  Biden clearly is struggling cognitively.  How can he lead against China &amp; Russia or make strong economic decisions? Why would anyone vote for him? #2020Election
i'm supposed to feel sorry for a business who's whole model is scamming people out of money with statistics? as for what he did, his policies got my brother in law an awesome paying job, with bigger wages, got us into a nicer house, got me a raise, rounding up sex traffickers etc
He started this w/ bringing up Abram's name from the get-go, followed by all you listed. It's one Biden item that has disappointed me - AND, I'm voting for Biden and SCOTUS.
Legally she was past the threshold, and listening to this, he was steering the conversation away from her. Sounds like you want to increase age of consent, which I might agree with if you increase voting age along with it.
I don’t see an end in sight. Even if 45 loses this election (swear to God y’all better vote him out), how long will it be before Biden can even change anything?
And, if their desired candidate isn't chosen, what? They won't vote for Biden and SCOTUS?
"Uhhhh  du ud durrr, yu no liek kintens? yu dummy hurr"
No, in the epstein case there are rooms filled with evidence that condemn these guys, except Trump who has been exonerated by witness testimony. It the case against them there was 0 evidence, and charges were dropped.
Indeed. I think all hell will break loose no matter who he chooses. Biden should never have started this ridiculous public 🐎 race.
i condemn those who abused children in clear violation of age of consent, Trump didn't, witness testimony exonerates him.
not according to the law.
just in time for the 2016 election, with no proof, and charges dropped entirely. we have receipts for the other guys you're ignoring to try to make this about Trump. Next.
blind speculation has no value in a battle for truth.
Hick and Bullock never caught on because the voter who wanted a moderate white man decided to stick with Biden. If either had caught on, they would have loved it. And if someone like Harris is running, they're going to step in as moderate white man options again.
There have been thousands of protests. A couple violent acts. Biden condemned the violent protests, including in a statement this week.
I don't "trust" anything, trust is for fools. I voted for him because of his background in business, and making difficult deals, He's a businessman, and that is reflected in the current state of the economy, in spite of covid. The left was saying the economy would never recover
No matter who he chooses, I'm voting for Biden and SCOTUS - just sayin'.
True. But then why does anyone listen to any politician re: "govt created jobs"? I guarantee as soon as Biden is President there will be any number of Rs deriding him for "failing to create jobs".
The only ones drawing lines around race are the left.
Despite my numerous phone notifications, I am skeptical of the claim that speculation regarding Biden's VP pick is breaking news worthy of an interruption into my day. If we know who, then sure, that's major news. But theories and speculation - how is that news?
The only thing that matters is who will motivate voters and help Biden win. And the 'playing women off against each other' are sexist and gross.
Florida starts counting mail in ballots early. As do some other states. They actually get counted in FL before ED voting. Biden wins Florida, everything else is moot.
I'm not going to bother to convince a bunch of anti-social posers on here to vote for Biden.
during your debates with trump i need you to say "I've been "Biden" my time!" please do it
Biden supporters like donuts and cops like donuts so Biden supporters is a cop!
I'm voting for Joe Biden in November. I like the Blue Angels and the Thunderbirds and I love the smell of burning jet fuel and afterburner noise.
Can't tell you how many times I've stayed awake at night worrying about what good ol Ed Rendell was thinking. 🙄
Oh, haven’t you heard?  Trump executed him with Bill, Hillary, Tom Hanks, Rita Wilson, Biden, and a few hundred others. Those are doubles you see now.
"Twitter suffered a major security breach on 15 July that saw hackers take control of the accounts of major public figures and corporations, including Joe Biden, Barack Obama, Elon Musk, Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos and Apple."
Biden was like the squarest Democratic Party candidate in 2008. Like, square man. Not far-out, man.
Generally agree, but I think it matters in this case. Biden has basically said he will be a one-term President and it's not certain he can even fulfill four years. Throw in the BLM movement and the pandemic, which has limited anything Biden has done/said publicly, and it matters.
honestly will not be surprised if Biden’s VP pick is Željko Buvač it’s been that kind of wild year
Trump is going to try and paint Biden supporters as hippies, yippies and anarchists.
Anarchists don't like Democrats let alone Biden. Maybe there's a few out there like a "pragmatic anarchist." Otherwise, anarchists and general hooligans aren't into Biden. Maybe Bernie Sanders or Ron Paul.
Many old African-American Biden supporters go to church every Sunday. Especially in the south. The Sunday go-to-meeting old church ladies in fact.
I'm a Biden supporters and I sit around the house minding my own business and don't even play loud music. I think the rioters, looters and arsonists when they occur are assholes. I don't like cancel culture and I'm into old school country music now.
That is not in any way to diminish the credentials of Karen Bass ... but what does that do for you for an election? It doesn't provide a younger fallback option if Biden cannot complete a term, it doesn't help you win a competitive state(s), and it doesn't have any national buzz.
Biden supporters don't riot or set fire to building. They live quiet lives and shop at Trader Joe's, REI, and Home Depot and do a lot of gardening, home improvement projects, take their dogs for a walk and pet their cats.
People are losing it over the prospects of Biden's VP pick.
I hope this is true. But also plenty of casual voters who are planning to vote Biden and aren't on Twitter are likely planning to drop their ballot in the mail at the deadline. (See: taxes)
Indeed.  It’s a bad choice but clearly Biden is better
Thanks to the predictable idiocy of Ed Rendell and Chris Dodd, the Biden team is going to have one helluva time explaining why they didn't pick Senator Harris if they don't pick Senator Harris.
"2020 Election Live Updates: Trump Administration Continues Attacks on Mail-In Voting" by Unknown Author via NYT
you can feel that way, but it's still not illegal. I don't really care how he "thinks and feel about women" because i'm not a subjective person, my feelings are not my master. I want him to represent this country because he can twist arms and get shit done, and does.
🤣🤣🤣 wow. But when he's talking about crime bills and "predators" he has no issue talking normally. You're just as delusional as Biden.
her only notion of a connection is because "jeffery told [her ]" Jeffry also told a reporter he was connected to Elon Musk which was a total fabrication.
The phrase "not that i can remember" is to shield her from legal perjury. if she said "no" plainly, and it turned out he visited, and it came out later, she could be legally liable. so what we have here is limited to what she's seen, and can remember, being high traffic.
you can read right, the people were fishing for something on Trump, but she made clear he was never on the island, corroborating the flight logs. The crime here isn't knowing epstein, it's sexual abuse of little kids, of which Trump is clearly vindicated.
not even close to a smoking gun, rich people go to expensive parties, it's common knowledge, i would be more surprised if they hadn't been in photos together, further the accusation is whether or not he touched these girls, and he didn't.
Most Americans DGAF what they accept or not, we had Trump for four years - New Yahoo News/YouGov poll: Most Trump voters say they will not accept the 2020 results if Biden wins because of mail-in ballots
keep in mind this a legal adult were are talking about here, a fully developed woman, not a child.
This is nothing compared to epstein and the clintons, Trump was vindicated, and at the end of the day, he might say some crass things, but he didn't break the law.

Let's go.  Time to stop this once and for all.  Any person who votes for Biden to appease these a$$#0!3$ is an idiot.

Running on the soul basis of “conservative good/ liberal evil” and “I hate joe Biden” doesn’t make you a good political candidate, It makes you a fear monger. What are your stances on issues, except for on 2nd amendment we all know that one.
"Make due" biden wants to arrest me for my thoughts. I'm going to pass on that fascist thanks.
Hate to be the bearer of bad news but Biden won’t be sympathetic to any attempt to disrupt the status quo. He will just be a friendly face on the same old bullshit.
We could do with less exciting and more maturity.  Biden is our next president.
Don't most states, except for around 8, have at-will employment? It's fantastic that you want more rights for employees! Joe Biden appreciates your vote.
Oh it’ll be longer than that, in either case. Must flip the senate too. My newest nightmare is a Biden victory paired with a republican senate hell bent on making sure the recovery doesn’t happen so they can elect someone else in ‘24.
Lol 😂😂😂😂 good lord the Democrats are concerned about Joe Biden! The one candidate literally worse than Hillary Clinton! Good job Dimms
lol umm, like targeting his political enemies? That fairness? Muller didn't even know what was in his own report! It's like Biden if he wins.
Yeah he wants to delay the election, only a dictator will do that. He doesn't have the right to it,  YOU ARE NOT MY PRESIDENT! I AM VOTING BIDEN
How much is in the pockets of a Biden.
Does he say it’s rigged if he somehow wins?! We have seen act, it’s boring. What’s different this time is how he’s throwing in the towel himself and keeps bringing up that he’s going to lose. LOVE seeing the fear in his eyes.
DT’s sinking at the polls. Sane supporters doubt his ability. He has divided us, cost us many lives, our economy &amp; our Allies. We cannot sit back &amp; “know” he will lose. We must gently embrace Repubs who doubt him. Biden must choose a strong VP. And we must vote as never before.
The original premise was no election, in which no house members would be elected. I absolutely agree that the election will happen. If red states start opting out, then it will just go to Biden who will get a vast majority of however much of the electoral college actually votes.

Biden’s campaign consists of trump making a jackass of himself on a minutely basis. The fewest minutes Joe is in the spotlight the better.
I think they dropped out because they saw they couldn't steal the moderate label from Biden and didn't want Sanders to be the nominee. I don't think a puppetmaster pulled their strings.
I think #SusanRice is the better choice. They have a working history together. She can navigate division intelligently and unify with diplomacy here and abroad. Most importantly, Biden trusts Rice. Our allies do too. She is ready to step in if needed.

There's hundreds of Joe Biden creepy photos even video of him touching girls sniffing girls
Biden’s campaign, just as Hilary’s was, is a sham from a corrupt DNC that has drown out Bernie twice now. Only a slight bump in the road in the timeframe needed to establish a more progressive nation.
My theory is they keep Trump because they find Obama to valuable and he'll be pretty exposed if Biden gets back in as the riots continue
If Biden’s a liberal, then my name is Greg. #BernieScrewedAgain
I think trump is absolute shit but he has a cult following with no real competition on the republican side and a majority of the left doesn’t really feel much for Biden as to his allegations actions and such if only the dems found a better candidate shitty

True! Though it might depend on Biden's class.   Obama is likely an INT or CHA based caster, so I'm assuming Biden is probably melee?
As if it is any surprise that the Russians will interfere in this election and try to to the so-called "October Surprise". No surprise either that the Republicans will help.
Biden does not utter racial slurs.
This is right on - failure of imagination. She was gambling for a mandate against a GOP congress and couldn't conceive of enough 'deplorables' to give EC to Trump.  Biden will be fine if he balances sincere effort to appeal to all w/ practical focus to assure EC win.
Save it from the catastrophic state Trump is responsible for putting the USA in?  Vote for Joe Biden!!!

This is BS using the Eulogy for John Lewis to campaign for Biden through Obama? Why isn't Biden out there speaking? Being in office 47 years I am sure he knew John Lewis very well.The Demos do not want you to see how incompetent Biden really is. WOW They stoop so low. Trump 2020

no, see, if we all just vote then biden will have a chance to fix all of this by, like, next march. That's soon enough, right? *checks notes* oh. oh nooo
It’s not Biden’s tweets that worry me.
Elections are run by states though. I thought  was all about states rights. Imagine red states delaying, blue states voting and putting Biden over the top.
Scott, you know you are not voting for Biden but you are voting for the VP.
I can’t bring myself to vote for Biden. He’ll be a puppet of the left and appoint crazy SCOTUS. #Trump2020
Why would Q (or “the cabal” as you’re saying) expose Hillary, Epstein, Weinstein, Hollywood, pedos, Obama, Biden, Comey, Clapper, Brennan, etc???  And NOT Trump (since he’s taking them all down)  And why aren’t any of them exposing Q as fake since Q is outing them ALL???  🤷‍♂️🤔
It’s a sizable part of Trump’s base, yes.  Just like there’s a sizable chunk of Marxists who will vote for Biden and believe capitalism is evil   Lots of dummies in the electorate who believe in their values over evidence
Bernie Sanders Not So Subtly Hits Ex-Spokeswoman, Calls It 'Irresponsible' for Supporters to Refuse to Back Biden  via
I asked you to provide 5 things that NO OTHER PRESIDENT HAS DONE. You gave me appoint judges. Other presidents have appointed judges. You said it was about volume, but that biden should fill more seats if they are vacant. Then you said it's about who is appointing them...
And he was roundly criticized as a promoting a conspiracy and being a nutcase.  We all knew Biden was right. Of course Trump is going to try to void an election he is sure to lose unless the Russians step in and help him and the GOP ratfucks voter registration and voting places.
Protestors not a political ideology like biden did.
Biden listens to scientists on when it will be safe to send the kids to school. Biden doesn’t sniff Lysol and take magic pills to make his decision.
you are so right young lady. Biden forgets where he is half the time. We’re screwed either way
Serious question. Do you think if he loses Nov. 3 he will stay in office until the inauguration? Or will he cut out early?  Regardless, do you think he would go to the inauguration of Joe Biden?
Kamala's record as prosecutor and state AG and her senate record including voting against a 10% military cut a few days ago are FAR more of a problem than her attack on Biden
Has he yet named a Democrat that he’s asked if they were a paid flunky for the Democrat party or for Joe Biden? We’ll wait. ⏱🤔😮🤭🥱😴
Last night, my 90+ yr. old Trumpist friend said, "I'm so worried that the cities will all be on fire after the election. All of those angry Biden people."  Where the hell is she hearing that?
What is going to be your gripe when it's teachers for Biden? I honestly do not know if one mom or one teacher that isn't terribly conflicted about schools right now. Hey I know, sound decisive leadership would help! #BidenForPresident
“It was unfounded then” That’s literally how predictions work right? Based on evidence this seems likely in the future. He was dead right and you owe Biden an apology, yo.

Too much collagen. Apparently help your boobs but not your brain. Biden is a rational, kind and experienced leader. Where does your kid go to school?
Congratulations! You're now qualified to write speeches for Joe Biden! 👍
that doesn’t seem like an answer to my question lol. and the EC was a landslide dude. nothing better than the condescension from libs who think biden’s got this locked up, just like they thought hillary had it locked up, then were like “OMG HOW DID THIS HAPPEN”
30,000 votes and only 3% for Biden? Keep lying MSM this poll clearly has Trump way ahead. Better yet, make it fair and add Jo to it!
So biden is a bad choice?

Biden is gonna win believe it put 5 on it 😂
1 other president have killed millions of people. 2 the fact you think biden is a good choice proves that there are more than 1/3 brainwashed, and by other presidents than trump. 3 the president isnt solely responsible for the response, and trump didnt cause covid.
Right MN is Trumps fault, so tired of Obama/Biden political BS
Have you given him #Covid, death seems to follow you around.  #Biden
and you think those obama to trump voters are coming back to mush brain biden? lol
No, they really don't   #Biden
So would a biden presidency. You have given nothing other than orange man bad. If trump is so terrible, give me 5 things he has done that no other president has?
Dear Congressman John Lewis,  You make me want to be a better person and a better American.  I wish you could have lived long enough to witness Joe Biden inaugurated as our next President.  We are all going to get this right.  Rest In Peace.
Biden is clearly in no shape physically or mentally to run. I can’t believe people are content with him as a puppet, I mean candidate.
Well I'm not convinced that Biden wins the election anyway, so I wouldn't be satisfied with a simple loss with a Biden Harris ticket. I'd need to see him win with a different VP pick too.
No. All the moms I know will crawl over glass to vote for Joe Biden. The moms I know stood in line for hours to vote for him in the primary. Kimberly...you are a smart gal(sketchy choice w/ Jr🙄) it is over for DJT. Way too late for over 150,000 families who have lost loved ones.
Who Biden?
So....now that Hermain Cain tragically passed after catching COVID and not being careful, do you think that the Trump campaign complains about Biden being careful ("hiding in his basement") now?!
Opinion | Joe Biden accused Trump of trying to delay the election. He should know better. - The Washington Post. ⁦    Embarrassing eh.
The American Postal Workers Union endorsed Joe Biden.  And we're supposed to trust them with our Mail-In Ballots?
You *will* still have to worry about: medical bills, racial justice, climate death, endless war, wealth inequality, militarized police state, and the full fascism that comes after Biden’s non solutions!
Remember.. Biden couldve never won if it wasnt for the unbelievable stupidity of the common MAGA. &amp; Gray ! My man!!!  With out you conning these inbred idiots it couldnt have happened.. Your one of the best libs! 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂  Oh no! Ya just lost the federalist😂😂😂
Nice work!
Well that fight is being told to vote biden/harris.... so good luck with effecting change with an architect of the system and and a D.A prosecutor.
Not dumb. They have just been fed a life time of propaganda. Although they do think biden is fascist and are still voting for them...
Welcome, resisters!  Now the work starts. Hold your elected congress people accountable for stopping Cheeto Fat’s agenda now.  They are all on twitter. Make sure they hear from you, daily. We can do this together!
Jason, millions of folks believe Trump is the worse President in history and a lying criminal. When asked about Biden’s qualifications to be President, you replied “better than Trump”. That’s quite the endorsement!  Biden’s better than a criminal.
Obviously BIDEN didn't give you enough money Because your still blowing hot air
What part of biden wants to arrest me dont you understand. You are just lucky I dont vote for evil.
When people vote! I will make as many trips to the polls as needed to get this piece of shit out!! If you can’t mail in your ballot, or just want to have the satisfaction of checking Biden’s name in person, I’ll drive you! Hell, I’ll carry you on my back if needed!!
Biden wants to arrest me for my political views... yeah I'll pass on that.
When you lose the Federalist Society, you're skating on thin ice, #orangeidiot
Let’s get this straight.  In 2016, We went for the red curtain.  This year, there is no curtain.  We know you and your character.  No longer are we blind.  We choose the blue stage.  Biden and trump are both known to us now.
Liz, you want Biden to win, admit it.
Obama’s eloquence and relatability makes me very embarrassed for the current leadership of our country, David. Good news it’s gonna be a Biden landslide. #TrumpOut2020
Now your getting it. It was never about liberation, and was always about control. Guess who is being controlled? Hint: not the Biden/lead prosecutor (harris) ticket...certainly not the act blue donation platform utilized by the BLM official foundation. Malcom X over MLK.
If he can stand up to Jim Crow laws, everything that he did, sacrifice what he gave, we can surely stand up to Trump.  Follow his example and lead.  He showed us the way, and did it with love.
I think they will respond either way, unless Biden commits to Medicare 4 all, open Borders, abortion until birth, defunding the police, student loan forgiveness and universal income, they are going to riot.
Do people actually think that Biden is going to move LEFT if he gets into office?   No, he is not “Progressive”. #NeverBiden
But it doesn't matter. Even if Biden for some bizarre reason couldn't assume office, the Constitution already provides for multiple avenues of recourse, and none of them include "just staying POTUS".
I’m a Dad for Biden.
So how much did Biden pay you  For your nasty botox face lift
I’m gonna seriously start busting ass when Biden is POTUS and Dems have the House and Senate that we need DC and PR to have statehood!!!!
Fraud rate is .00004%. Almost all are by Republican. The Donald knows voter turnout will be better if vote by mail was achieved. More votes for Biden. I will crawl on razor blades if necessary, to cast my vote.
Offset by the many republicans who will vote for Biden. You’re boy just ain’t that popular.
His game is pathetic and we all know what he's doing. I feel for Biden and all he will have to address after the last 4 years. Biden will conduct transition regardless of Trump's tantrums. What's going to be horrifying is Trump and a lameduck GOP Senate and what they will attempt
Are you scared? Americans already know...Joe Biden wins!
The government can run with Trump sitting in the WH. Biden can probably run the government from home and a decent office building in Dover or Wilmington.
Why wasn’t Biden there, he’s the nominee, not Obama? He’s the one who should have spoke.
White House Spiritual Advisor Blasts Biden’s Marijuana Policy Record -

I think the Biden campaign shifted into a higher gear today with the remarks at John Lewis’s memorial service.
How? The transition starts. The Biden appointees take over the government. He can sit in the WH as long as he wants.
Sure he's looking for any kind of dirt he can use on Biden, and coming up clean.  Sounds like Biden's group has secured their data this time as well.

How Joe Biden's Policy Proposals Would Impact the Education Industry  via
I guess I don't see the point of your tweet either? Like Trump is gonna stop acting like a petty dictator because people are settling for biden? Or people who feel disenfranchised by the system are gonna be like "Wow they are being upfront the system sucks I am gonna vote now!"
Biden can make him a Supreme Court judge
So he wants schools to be reopened but wants voting to be delayed? I have to laugh. His ego can't handle that Joe Biden will beat him.
Cool, vote third party and watch when Biden or Trump is elected
It really isn’t. Trump is unhinged and Biden’s not a threat.
I'm not blinded.  Biden is not the best speaker and often makes gaffs.  Trump is WILLFULLY IGNORANT. He is an unintelligent grifter...and you are the mark.  You are being used.
The problem is that the remaining moderate Dems are believing that  Joe Biden will be a moderate Dem president and worth it to dump Trump.  The indications are that, even if he is able to remain competent and is not removed, he will have a far left VP and cow to the far left
Trump proved that Joe Biden was right in April. #MTPDaily #MSNBC
I don’t know who is worse - MAGAs or Bernie Bros refusing to vote for Biden unless he promises Medicare for all. So it’s ok with them if Trump gets re-elected so the poor and those with pre existing will not be able to get ANY insurance

Biden is receiving intelligence briefings. Which means he knows more about what’s going on than the current president. Simple because Biden reads and listens. Unlike our current president.

Agree.  I went thru it w/ grandpa, &amp; there's this curious slackness of facial "affect" that happens.  Hard to describe, but I've seen it several times w/Biden, and it means he's not in early stages, as many claim.   Also, everything we see is sanitized.
There are ZERO Biden signs in Colorado. A few Bernie and way more Trump that’s last election.
My tears started forming as he walked to the podium - because we've lost so much and we need his help so badly now. I must believe that when Biden is elected he'll turn to Obama for  insight and inspiration.
Delay and automatically put in Biden the poll leader
Liberal logic: If you vote for Trump you're a racist and a white supremacist, even if you are black! In fact, if they don't vote for Biden then "you ain't black" and a white Biden voter is blacker on the inside than you are! You can't debate rationally with that level of crazy.
True, Biden doesn't come close to Obama on any level. And, in many ways, Biden is a HUGE mistake as a candidate. Obama tipped the scales. It's Obama's fault we've got Biden. Stupid Obama for pushing Biden on us, after the Hillary fiasco.
The only way he would do this is if he can make a deal that nobody (SDNY) will prosecute him.  If we see Biden winning in a landslide I can’t see anyone being willing to let Trump get out of jail free
biden needs support from the left to win, cuz the right has dug in on trump. people are less motivated overall to go out and vote than they were in 2016. i hate trump but i think having any kind of confidence that biden’s got this in the bag is insane.

bro you’re going off the same polls that said trump had no chance of winning in 2016. at least hillary was able to put together a complete sentence and was visible, biden has literally nothing going for him besides “not trump” and we saw how that strategy worked for hillary
Hey  what's your take on this now? Is Biden still "going low"?
It was a Democrat rally since they are having to go virtual next month. Where was Biden?
Vote Biden,  but appealing to the military industrial hierarchy is not the way forward. Slandering protesters, dealing with Larry Summers and all the scumbags that engineer American austerity
Do you realize mail-in ballots will cause a MASSIVE delay in getting the results back? Results will be questioned even by Biden -- he's hired 100 lawyers to litigate on his behalf.
lol biden liked on both sides? the left sees him as a republican (true) and the right sees him as a corrupt career politician, like clinton. at least hillary had the whole “first woman president” thing going for her to motivate women voters, biden has nothing besides “not trump”
It is the Democrats and Republicans responsibility to gives us deserving qualified candidates from which to vote on and you cannot tell me President Trump and former VP Joe Biden are the best our great country can come up with to run for the highest office!
Why didn’t Biden speak, he’s the Democrat nominee? This was a racist, partisan rant at an honorable mans funeral. Gross
Then President Biden will call out the military to put down the insurrection (as the Constitution allows).
Yes, you will beat the right by allowing prominent members of the Bush administration to spend millions getting Biden elected and they are sure not to want anything in return.  It's no wonder you've all become '80s Republicans, you're all such easy marks.
How in the world do you know what I’m doing or not doing for Biden?  Ignorant tweet
so, so, so many people on the right think covid is overblown/“politicized” &amp; the resulting economic disaster is the fault of the dems for “forcing shutdowns”. trump voters from 16 are still trump voters in 20, but libs and leftists are less motivated for biden than for hillary
Say it ain't so, Joe...
Obama and Biden controlled both houses of congress in 2010 Yet they didn't pass anything close to M4A.  They passed a bill which was originally thought up by a conservative think tank. Same BS every cycle. You all act like Dems will bring socialism.  Scare tactics.
You think Biden isn't going to ask?  The scenario here is Trump trying to remain in office beyond his Constitutionally mandated term end on Jan 20th, at which point Biden or Pelosi (most likely) would take the oath. Then they're going to be issuing orders.
You got Biden.  I think you can sit down now.  Also this:
8 years Obama/Biden administration and between the two of them they never accomplished crap.
So is Biden next with his political rally speech, oh wait he was in his basement this morning. Why wasn’t he a speaker, he’s the Democrat nominee?

Donald Trump’s threat to delay or change the 2020 election is empty and absurd. Our election will be on November 3rd and it’s more important than ever to get out to vote and elect Joe Biden.
I don't remember hearing Biden speaking like this and he's the guy running for president.
Biden doesn't measure up to Obama's knee caps. This speech is wonderful, but not for Biden.
All the claims that Biden is a pedophile is baseless &amp; an attempt by the far right for you not to vote for him. I see it’s worked on you. Biden ain’t perfect at all but he’s far better than trump.
If #Biden cared anything about Blacks, he would have supported  or another POC candidate.  Listening to Obama, it struck me . . .
I mean, Biden isn't President. Not sure what you are on about, buster?
She’s not a smart human, but even she knows Biden is a fake candidate...a husk of skin with sunglasses and a mask
I don’t give any of my very few remaining fucks who Joe Biden picks to be VP. He’s going to be President. Because Joe is not a Nazi puppet of a Russian dictator. We can worry about the petty bullshit later.
#Obama speaking -- Biden really doesn't come close to Obama in any way shape or form Especially not as a speaker! Obama is so moving! Biden so blah!
So nice to hear a real president  giving the eulogy for  Obama to eulogize #JohnLewis a true leader... meanwhile the Orange fool #DrDeath pushes his #snakeoil as the covid deaths mount up.  November cannot come quick enough. #Biden
Biden Leading by alot more than 2pts
Yup. Formerly-Warren husband and I are waiting for a Biden-Harris sign.
I think that to frame it that way is a false dichotomy. Everyone accepting the VP job is ambitious and has dreams of being president. See: Joe Biden. You can have that ambition and also be equally focused on doing the best possible job as president. Ambition is not a dirty word.
If we are going to make a the vice presidency a springboard for the presidency after this election, I would rather prosecutors of any kind be barred from the position. Probably not Biden’s reasoning. But it is mine.

And I could be wrong Eve. I've certainly never lived thru anything like this either. It's just my sense of the forces at play. Trump isn't a necessary part of capitalism's continued power. Joe Biden works just as well.
This was on April 24th. Lot of right wing talking heads and the Trump campaign tried to paint Biden as a conspiracy theorist &amp; out of his mind for saying it.   💁‍♂️
Why are you supporting Biden?
🤦‍♀️we really need a Trump Biden debate!
They have to keep Flynn quite until after the election, he knows far to much about the Obama/Biden corruption

Establish Dems came together, finally, &amp; backed their most realistic candidate in Biden &amp; had Boot and Klob back out. SC voted for the man they trusted most, not surprising, &amp; then the media blew it up to make sure "BIDEN IS BACK!". Bernie needed to do more &amp; it didn't happen.
But.. question is.. can you give me any logical or legitimate reasons you would vote for Biden?
Could a Dem gov appoint Biden and then colleagues name him PPT ?

#WeWillVote  #WeWillVoteByMail  From CO here &amp; we will hand deliver our vote for Joe Biden to the local ballot drop-off, trump may try to fuck with the USPS but there are ways to be sure your vote counts. Do what you have to &amp; vote this ass out before he destroys our democracy.
Apparently Joe Biden’s press conference on his economic plan, racial inequality was over James’s head as well. The President  is tweeting today about pizza. Perhaps that is easier for you to grasp. We expect that from Jr.I am old enough to remember when I thought of you as smart
Republicans are about to destroy the USPS but we still have people on the fence about voting for Biden.
No one Biden is sworn in he no longer has any say about anything

it’s a sealed ballot, how on Earth would they know if it’s a Trump or Biden vote? Chill on the paranoia
Trump would need the military to back his c*up, and I just don't see that happening when Joe Biden is the other choice. Biden would be great for the military industrial complex, even better than Trump in many ways.
And yes I would vote for him before Biden. A vote for Biden is a vote for his VP and the communist agenda of the far left. No thanks
Both parties are completely corrupt and only care about their corporate interest.  Congress is in control of our policies. for president I am more concerned with someone respected by the world. The face of our nation. Granted Biden is a horrific choice. Just not as horrific
Biden supports fascism. There is no choice.
No you are being a child. 4 more years of GOP gives us a one party system. And then any progressive will be jailed or otherwise eliminated.  Biden still keeps the democracy intact.  If you don't see the difference, then you are the who is a freaking idiot.
Who helps Biden the most in CA, NV, AZ, which is greater CA? Who helps the most in TX and FL?

Hey    Absentee Ballots ARE Mail In Ballots.  Election Dates are Federal Law and you can't EO your way around it.  YOU killed Herman Cain.  You're the worst thing to ever happen to the United States of America... But we will Build Back Better with #Biden.
Joe Biden speaks at a campaign stop in Hampton, N.H.  It’s looking entirely possible that Democrats will emerge from November with unified control of the White House and Congress. There’s a lot of time until Election Day, but no one expects Republicans to threaten in the Hou…
Why? Biden can govern without the WH, while one support after another is pulled away from the White House. Soon, no one will show up to change the sheets and check on the electrical generators.
Whoever the vp choice is, Biden will be removed from office for being mentally unfit when she invokes the 25th Amendment.
“Those are the incoherent, conspiracy-theory ramblings of a lost candidate who is out of touch with reality. President Trump has been clear that the election will happen on Nov. 3.” - Trump campaign spokesman Tim Murtaugh to CNN re: Biden’s comments that Trump would try this. 🤪
Are you kidding me? Not a “typical polished politician?” Trump’s rhetoric is best described as BABBLING. You realize Trump speaks at a 4th-grade level, right?He’s unintelligent AND unintelligible. For you to say Biden can’t speak and Trump can, is the height of disingenuousness.
October 12, 2020. Donald Trump resigns from the presidency stating that the election is rigged and doesn’t want to be a “loser”. Republicans scramble to get another candidate but it’s too late. Joe Biden wins the largest electoral victory in history.
Oh hell no!!! Already heard you're slowing down the mail around that time.  We want you OUT ASAP.  you can always just resign to save yourself the embarrassment of getting worked by Biden
...that lead slowly trickles away, as ballot by ballot is counted and rallied for Joe Biden. If there’s a realistic scenario for the worst fear of Democrats (Trump protesting and not leaving office) it would be THIS.
This is my friend, Beth, just having a conversation with Biden and Obama. 🤩
Imagine the real progress you could make if you did actual organizing instead of screaming at people to suck it up and vote for Biden.
I see. Just saw various well-known Kamala people disputing the claims of one tweeter that it’s a common position among the KHive. I am not on here much anymore but I have not encountered any KHive anti-Biden tweets.
👏🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻absolutely correct. I am a moderate and I struggle to call myself a Dem or Rep.. I just can’t call myself a Trump base. He’s scary.. Biden is only mildly less scary for different reasons. I began an anti-trump so the assumption is I’m liberal. It’s not binary!
Yeah and we all better vote (for Biden) in November to make sure it stays that way.  Please.
So this tweet.. Are you going to delete it? Or perform some back-breaking spin talk to twist it? Looks like Biden knows Trump better than you, that must be embarrassing for you given your blind, lap dog devotion to a wanna be dictator.
Because a millionaire with a net worth between himself and his wife of $9 million totally related to the struggle of paying exorbitant insurance and rent prices. Uh-huh.   Yeah, more so than trump. But come on, my income is less than $30k a year.
Heads up! Another obvious, blatant deep state move coming. Durham, almost certain, won't release his report until after election to protect Dems. Says don't want to interfere with results. He prefers we elect Biden, a big part of spygate.
Great thread of commentators that went after Biden for suggesting 45 would try to delay the election
I'd say yes, but doubt they'd do much to alleviate the suffering once in power. We'll have more testing and masks will be cool but Joe Biden ain't singing no 1200 dollar check
Even if that were true (it's not, you're a liar), I'd still trust Biden to surround himself with experts and professionals. What we have now is a wanna-be dictator who surrounds himself with loyalists who will do and say anything to please their leader.
Hey  do you now feel pretty stupid for chastising Biden when Trump was so obviously going to try and find a way to push back the election?  Will you tweet a video of you eating crow?
Also, you’re got some radical assumptions about me.   1. I’m unaffiliated  2. I voted for Yang in the primaries 3. I’m not a “Berner” or “Bernie bro” or whatever you call a Bernie supporter.  4. Obviously I’m not voting for Trump. Criticizing Biden doesn’t make me a trumper.
It doesn't concern you that it was only an allegation started by liberal leftist.  The truth is such a bothersome issue for most liberal democRATs.  Does it concern you that sleepy joey Biden fondles little girls?
He said as much in March. Even if by some miracle it did make it through both houses, he said he would veto it based on the estimated price tag. Of course, politicians don’t always do what they say, but suffice that he’s satisfied with the status quo.
Obviously because:  Corporate and insurance company donors don’t want it. And they have influence.   The DNC sabotaged Sanders’ campaign in 2016 and 2020. He also had a heart attack, it scared people off.   Biden was the “safer” pick. 65+ voter turnout. 45 and under didnt show up
If Trump truly believes he will win the in-person voting there is only one way we win this straight out and that's beat him in both in-person and mail in votes. It's possible. There will be suppression, obstruction, harassment, intimidation but we can do this. #Biden  #Biden2020

I don't care how much you don't like Joe Biden. If you don't vote for him this year, you are complicit in the destruction of our democracy. Trump needs to go NOW.
Biden said that in 1989. 31 years ago why not talk about what he said about it 31 days ago. You are simply a reg hat goon spreading lies and disinformation.  You are the enemy. YOU
That's the point of a primary and debate! Show that you can throw some punches, land them and defend against attacks. "unfair and pre-planned" 🙄  If nothing else, she revealed a chink in Biden's armor that he should now be prepared for in the general - right?
im aligned with neither. what does that have to do with any of it? if not voting biden = voting trump, therefore not voting trump = voting biden. simple math bud. too hard for u?
Flashback to April: Joe Biden says Trump will seek to postpone the election. The Trump campaign called Biden’s claims “incoherent conspiracy theory ramblings.”
Good tweet. Helps keep Americans informed about how sick you are. It makes more and more Americans deciding to vote for Joe Biden for President.
nice projection. ur loterally aaying voting for trump is voting for biden somehow
Hey khive, I won’t vote for a ticket that includes Kamala, even IF Biden shapes up. Fuck around and find out!
wait how would voting for trump be a vote for biden hahahhaahahahahaha dude do u hear yourself? are you fucking serious? what fantasmatic level of thinking do you operate on? holy fuck dude please have the waltons hurt you? are they making u type this? pls leave the walmart sir
fact check  The former vice president said most of the demonstrators are “peaceful protesters” who aren’t a threat to be met by federal power. “Arsonists and anarchists should be prosecuted,” Biden said, but added that “local law enforcement can do that.  Wall Street Journal
Keep tweeting tweets like this. It helps more Americans make their decision to vote for Joe Biden.
.   So Biden was crazy to suggest Trump would seek to delay the election hey...  You must be a real high character individual to stand idly by and allow this to occur
Every time I get a text from the Biden campaign I answer it: Pick Liz.
You know what’s more likely than canceling the election? Biden wins decisively, but trump whines about imaginary fraud, so Biden unifies the country by instructing his electors to defect to trump, and democrats rejoice at such leadership and civility for the common good.
Or distract us from the 32% contraction in GDP.  That pretty much sealed the deal for him in November if you look at the cards.
actually if i dont vote for trump im helping biden
2020 Election Live Updates: Trump Floats Whether to ‘Delay the Election,’ Something He Cannot Legally Do
Nothing will stop me from voting for Biden. I quit the GOP because of you. I voted against you last time and I’ll do it again. Even if you infect me with your virus, I will do everything I can to hold on until I can vote Biden for the sake of everyone I love.
Trump on April 27: “I never even thought of changing the date of the election. Why would I do that? November 3rd. It’s a good number. No, I look forward to that election.”  He said Biden’s suggestion that he might attempt to delay it “was just made-up propaganda.”
dude I hate the fact that I'm going to vote for Biden but I will do anything in my power to get that man child out of office
White House Spiritual Advisor Blasts Biden’s Marijuana Policy Record - We Didn't Know That The President Actually Had Any Spiritual Or Religious Convictions Other Than For A Photo Op.  #Biden #Biden2020 #CannabisCommunity #marijuana #legalizeit
Once again, Joe Biden was right.
I remember Biden/Ryan.  Ryan was supposed to be "wonder boy" and Biden kicked his ass
Hey Suburban Voters, Joe Biden's Housing Policies Will Ruin Your Communities  #SuburbanitesAgainstTrump
Prediction: in 2022 GOP will launch investigations into Biden family’s role in Ukraine. They’ll never let up.
Hey Suburban Voters, Joe Biden's Housing Policies Will Ruin Your Communities
Senator Jones... if Alabamaians are not smart enough to re-elect you... it will be their loss! However... Joe Biden will need an excellent Attorney General to right the wrongs and represent all Americans in our fight for a more just America! Can’t wait!
Vote Biden lose your suburbs Read the AFFH see what it really does.
You want top lose your suburbs? Vote Biden.
Alert: Biden will go on an apology tour. If you don’t like it, stop electing Rs that are so woefully inept they require an apology to the entire World.
Lol I think you meant Pedophile Biden
I'm still undecided as to whether I will leave the Presidential section on my ballot blank or if I'll vote for #JoeBiden----if Biden picks  or  for his VP, I'll vote for him....not sure how I feel about the rest of the VP candidates.
Coloradans and Americans need a President like Joe Biden. Joe understands how economic justice for all and a strong working class are key to our economy. Joe will make sure we have an economy that works for everyone.  It is with great honor that I endorse Joe Biden for President.
Susan Rice was the White House national security advisor when Hunter Biden struck lucrative deals overseas that raised red flags in several U.S. agencies.  It’s still unknown what she knew at the time and whether she discussed with the VP ⁦
Sedition in the Obama Oval Office?   Obama, Joe Biden, and their top intelligence officers huddled in the Oval Office shortly before Donald Trump was inaugurated to discuss what they would do about this new President they despised.   via
All Biden needs to do is sit back and watch this corrupt and incompetent administration implode. Silence is golden, as well as an effective strategy when your opponent is tanking.
Agreed, better to delete or point out.
It’s not real someone mixed in audio of  with this video.   However, Trump still stands and moves like an inebriated Sasquatch!
Trump would use this as ammunition for his whole Deep Fakes excuses... maybe better to just delete this crap!
Oh yeah it’s  I remember he did a comedy video impersonation exactly like this. Someone toon the audio from his video and used some digital effects to make it sound live and mixed it, this is fake please don’t retweet! Don’t let Trump claim Fake News!!!
It sounds a lot like that guy who does a great impersonation of Trump and is hilarious. I can’t remember his name at the moment but, even though I can’t stand Trump, I don’t think is real. Also, that funny guy didn’t make this either, it’s one of his existing impersonations.
Won't need to. President Trump will convince biden to take HCQ. That shows you how compassionate President Trump is.
Yes! Biden &amp; Mrs #BHO
I think it is very likely that Biden will lose. Dems might get the senate anyways, but those odds go down w/ Biden's polls.  is soooooo stubborn. They still haven't given me a reason to vote for Joe -- I'm a white senior college grad in suburbs
But if it's happening now under Trump already.... What's the difference?  We had Biden as VP for 8 years already, but this all didn't start getting this crazy until Trump... Weird. 🤷
AOC Puts Biden &amp; Party Ahead of People!  via
Hey,   Morning inspiration: Dem House + Dem Senate + Trump  Wouldn't that be fun? I'll get just as much of what I want as a progressive from this set up as I will if Biden if the f______g president?
Why should I vote for Biden? He doesn't support M4A, defunding the police, free college/debt forgiveness, green energy or low income housing.  He supports Corporations. I hate  more than Trump.  He's insane,  has no such excuse.
We had that with Biden and I know he’ll pick someone that fits that description. Kamala Harris fits that description.
Trump vs. Biden: Where they stand on health, economy, more
Let's just call them Biden Bronards. IDK. They have no principles, so what do you expect?
Biden’s the real patriot when it comes saving American lifes
It was proven false biden supports defunding the police
Yeah, I mean you wouldn't want a former Vice President running for President! That's just crazy, right Vice President Biden?
The riots and violence is not Biden’s fault
Settlers for Biden!
This is such garbage. Let her live!
Bring it on and let’s see it!  I would buy tickets to watch the blood bath on a debate... exactly why thw Dems don’t want it!  It’s so sad to see what they are doing to Presidential Candidate Biden!  Abuse in many eyes!
No.  anyone but trump. Then it will work itself out. Vote biden please
I dont understand your point. Biden is as much of a jackwagon as trump is. Neither of the two major parties want change. If they did, things would have changed decades ago. You want to suggest a solution to our nations inequality problems or keep posting memes with no relevance?
RIGHT, its wild to me that biden is trying so hard to hand this election to trump!
There won't be a debate. Too dangerous. Not because of COVID but because of Biden's tendency to wander far off topic then say something ridiculously racist or otherwise offensive.
Joe Biden is a pedophile, if you support him you are also a pedophile.
Settling for Biden like I'm a wannabr 1950s housewife ho yeah
Joe Biden has already committed to selecting a VP candidate who is a non-white woman. Why is nobody calling that racist and sexist? He has essentially eliminated ~83% of viable candidates right off the bat. Imagine in 2024 if a POTUS candidate vowed early to pick a white male VP!
I don't know if any of that is true but I will 💯 save it and use it when the next MAGAt brings up Biden's health.
It's as if every male Vice President in history didn't have ambition for the Presidency, including, well, Joe Biden...
You’d think dems would agree Kamala Harris becoming next POTUS after Biden would be a GREAT thing... such hypocrites.
Of course, Biden hasn’t “vaulted” at all - he has ALWAYS polled far ahead.   In contrast, Memorial Day 4 years ago, Trump was polling ahead. At no time has Trump ever polled close to Biden let alone been ahead.  If &gt;50% of voters say they’ll NEVER vote Trump, it’s hard to win.
What a fake, just like his dumb ass brother on CNN.  Why can’t Democrats just admit that masks are useless, and it’s a ploy to agitate and scare the public for as long as possible and keep Biden off the debate stage.  Admit it!
Let’s just wait and let President-Elect Biden weigh in on this first.
“He doesn’t have to win the election. He just has to create a plausible narrative that he didn’t lose.” (Correction: It doesn't need to be plausible. Nothing in his alt reality is plausible yet his cult buys it no matter what.)
Don't spend it all in one place now lol
Whoo hoo!!!! New friends. #Resist bitches!
Wasn't that bizarre? You're right, he seemed happy about it. Great timing, just as the eviction moratorium ends!   Still, I wouldn't put it past Biden and  to yet find a way to blow this election. Remember 2016?
So he supports illegal immigration? So Biden is for no immigration laws and 100% open borders! #Ludicrous
Weekend at Biden’s
Where are their masks? Didn’t Biden recently state that he would have a national mandate to require every American were a mask? #Hypocrite
i just feel us all going down this exact same path again. Their campaign is moving. And if you want to talk about a "bunker bitch" well, Biden hasn't really been anywhere to be found. If he was formidable he'd be on tv every single day.
Texas would be dead without Trump. The O&amp;G hub of the world would be decimated under a Biden win. You care for your state, you want a job, you like your standard of living? Then you must vote👇
Biden needs to pick the person he believes will help him best get the job done - a herculean task, to say the least. And yes, that means taking the feelings of his constituency into account - but it can't be the only factor.
*presumptive*....the VP candidate will take his place by Election Day. Biden won’t cognitively make it until 11/4. Back room Dems will install who THEY want to be President. The most corrupt election cycle we have ever seen. Dems are short circuiting the entire process
Without thinking, I immediately assumed this was about Biden - oops!
You can see in the window its Biden for  Iowa, its from last year.
I mean dude the Bush era right is literally rallying around biden. Liberals are slowly making excuses to move right. It’s insane.
#Biden  LOOK AT THIS ! HE HAS TO BE LED AROUND !  IF ELECTED HE WILL BE REMOVED BY THE 25th AMENDMENT AND THE VP WILL BE IN !
Allegations. I never claimed Trump diddle kids, you assert without any facts or knowledge that Biden is a pedophile. He hasn't even had a lawsuit for any sexual misconduct brought against him or allegations. So where is your proof ?
Her ambition and brains are exactly why Biden will choose her. He is smart enough to know that he needs that balance.
All of these amazing women will be needed in the Biden administration.
God you make me want to puke. Right now we have TWO choices.  1- trump (or whatever lackey replaces him) on the march to a Dictatorship. Then you progressives are truly fucked. 2- Biden who has agreed to work with Bernie and Warren.  Quit being so God damn melodramatic.
#IngrahamAngle  running for president is a marathon run and I do not think Biden can finish the run
I like that.   Linda Sarsour is saying that Biden is an opponent we would rather have then Trump but it is also true that Chuck and Nancy wouldn't have anyone to blame.
Totally agree John. I didnt want to say it because God forbid something should happen, Biden is 77.  So with out saying it, I feel most comfortable with a Sen Harris or Susan Rice. They are both ready now.
It’s shit like this that makes me really worried if biden actually wins tbh
Lol it’s not like she would asassinate him. Who cares if she wants to be POTUS after Biden?!
I'm not claiming anything. Do you want the lawsuits ? You're the one saying Joe Biden is a pedophile so I ask where is your evidence?
Pretend that's you out there protesting president Biden's new law forcing you to become vegan and worship Islam. Do you still have no problem with cops violently assaulting you, running you over, gassing you, and imprisoning you w/o charge?
Biden Allies Try to Derail Kamala Harris Pick
Joe Biden has promised to pick a woman as his running mate. Political experts predict he'll choose someone much younger and more energetic than he is in order to provide balance. "Ladies and gentlemen, Vice President Ruth Bader Ginsburg!"
Sen Kamala Harris is ambitious, and by all rights should be. To be honest, as a voter supporting Joe Biden,  I feel the most comfortable with a VP that is ready to be president.
I'm not and Weinstein was convicted as he should of been, Spacey is facing charges. Clinton, Kennedy cheated on their wives and have different sexual fetishes doesn't make them criminals. Bill Cosby should be locked up and their was evidence against him. What do you have on Biden
I would not vote for biden in any other election. But fuck he’s not making it any easier.
Ever since Biden sewed up the nomination, I thought Kamala Harris was the right choice for VP. Those saying she is too ambitious can stuff it.
He hasn't. Neither has Biden. I can show you where Trump paid of a porn star
'It's absolutely serious': Susan Rice vaults to the top of the VP heap
#IngrahamAngle  I see no Trump yard signs or Biden yard signs for obvious reasons, no one wants to become a senseless victim
They are fighting for Joe Biden. They nees the buildings shut down through the election so they cannot be used as voting places
Madonna would work too. Just saying. ;)   Republicans Salivate Over Possibility Joe Biden Might Pick Susan Rice For Vice President
Not sure. But Biden can drink a glass of water with one hand like a big boy, and walk down a ramp by himself, so he has that going for him.
They want Biden to win. That’s what this is about. Keeping schools, parks, Rec centers closed so voting places cannot be set up.
Facebook started banning me, censoring me and shadow banning me after I came out vocally against Joe Biden.  I was going to vote as follows: 1. Bernie Sanders 2. Andrew Yang 3. Tulsi Gabbard 4. Now I'm voting Trump
And what proof do you have of Biden being a pedophile? Or any of the people you have accused of being a pedophile? Keep to the boy scout leaders and the Catholic Church at least there is evidence for those sick bastards
Twitter is an echo chamber for all the idiots who are going to vote for Biden while diddling the Democrats.
Translation - big tech is stealing the election for Biden
#Hannity  Would not surprise me one bit that Biden does not make it to Nov 3rd
He never got to talk they were all to busy campaigning for Biden
#Hannity  the Dem plan is to make things so bad the voters will vote for Biden hoping it will be better than Trump
WHY DO YOU HATE MY CHOICE FOR BIDEN'S VP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Guaranteed that guy is voting for Biden.
Biden will win Texas
Stop pretending like we don’t all know Biden’s VP will 100% end up being the president if he wins the election.  If people wanted President Harris, they would’ve given her more than zero votes in the primaries.
WATCH: Google CEO Squirms as Jim Jordan Asks if Google Will 'Tailor Its Features' to Help Joe Biden
I'm all in for Harris... But at the end of the day it won't matter. I'm #AmericaOrTrump , which means Biden can pick an unknown and I'll still vote for him. There are no other choices.
There are plenty of reasons to not support Harris as VP - I think there are legit criticisms to level at her. This isn't one of them. What VP hasn't focused on becoming pres? Biden pledged to be a one-term president, so... if his term goes halfway decently it would make sense.
i have doubts there will be history to look back on... meaning we are heading right for a cliff (global collapse of our food system due to climate change) and trump is hitting the gas, while biden is fiddling with the radio.
Some very Biden or Pete tier platitudes here
I've been gone for hours only to come back to a wall of naysayers talking about set backs, Biden losing November, and saying today was disheartening for our country.  I don't know what I missed, but fuck that shit!   We don't have time for that nonsense! Get it together people!!
Particularly when much of Biden's core message is based on the idea that the current president values loyalty to HIM over loyalty to the country. What bullshit complaints, these are.
This just in, The ghost writer of Joe Biden’s tweets used to write “daily affirmations”
Joe Biden’s climate bet: putting jobs first will bring historic change
They care about the debt again because they are getting ready to lose. They’ll be back to fiscal conservatism to fight Biden after eating at the Trump trough for the last 4 years piling up debt.
If Biden picks John McCain's corpse to be his VP I'm still voting for Biden.
. Thank you. We no longer have to worry about Obama’s evil AFFH rule to destroy our neighborhoods.  Biden has promised to continue Obama’s AFFH if elected.  We will re-elect #Trump2020
"Biden allies" is apparently 3 guys that CNBC sought after.
Rose Twitter is getting triggered already at the prospect of a Kamala Harris VP. Which is weird because they said they're not voting for Biden so why should they even give a fuck?
Because the Democrats want to win the next election. There will be no good news, efforts to use HCQ or any other drug until Joe Biden is elected. The media is complicit. COVID will be lied about until Trump loses
with Stanely Kurtz explains these details of how the Obama, Biden program would have destroyed neighbors and suburbs nation wide.
AFFH would have destroyed communities nation wide. Taken away the the single family home as it was designed to do under OBAMA, Biden. Stanley Kurtz  Ethics Public policy.
The reason this won't work is republicans have been telling us for years that they're all the same -- corrupt.  Even if Americans think that maybe the Obama administration did something wrong, they'll figure Trump is way worse and Biden will be better for America!
It would be good to incorporate some of those moderate Rs into the Dem party in Texas and FL. A few would do it. Biden would be the guy to create the entrance ramp, but I don't know how he would do it.
As far as Biden's legacy, if he can defeat Trump and lead to the 1st woman President, that's darn good.
I would like to save this kind of energy for the other side
Who gives a rats ass what Biden does. The guy is a faker. Nothing wrong with him,. It is a dodge to keep him from answering questions.
Well apparently it’s going to be President Harris anyway, I don’t give Biden 3 months in office if he wins.
This Was John Lewis' Final Message To Joe Biden | HuffPost
Biden is not the best. That doesn’t mean we should leave the worst stay in office.
Get educated and try to understand the words you’re saying before shoving them into other people’s ears. If anything, Biden is not even left of the spectrum. He’s moderate as best if not a little right.
That was the Biden porridge that you have taken. GREAT JOB!!
So yeah, time tell the swing voters to fuck themselves. What do we really have to lose? You think Biden is going to fix anything? Why didn't Obama do anything about the DHS? 8 years of letting it slide so he could pass a health insurance company subsidy. Fucking thanks.
Mind games forever..... Republicans Salivate Over Possibility Joe Biden Might Pick Susan Rice For Vice President
Whatever he decides.  His campaign effort has been aces so far.
If Biden knows what to do why hasn't he done it in the past 40 plus years he has been in Government? 😂
A POS is what MAGAT's voted for. I'm happy to inform all  the people living their Suburban Lifestyle Dream you will no longer be bothered/financially hurt by having low income housing built in your neighborhood crime will go down. I've rescinded the Obama-Biden AFFH Rule. Enjoy!
Joe Biden ads at the gym 🤮
So, shut down American Coal and Pander to the Chinese to enrich themselves? Sounds typical Biden! Didn’t he make Millions from them already? He’s a Tool, isn’t he? Wow! And losing his mind won’t help him to even enjoy ALL the Filthy Lucre he’s made at exploiting American workers!
- Trump trails Biden by 10%.   - Only issue Trump wins on is handling economy, which is the 2nd most important issue for voters, behind the pandemic.   - 70% support voting by mail, though 60% believe ballots will be sent to deceased voters and to old addresses (integrity?)
Biden is faking his illness.
Im losing faith in Biden.
With an opponent defeating themselves the way trump is, it would make sense to push for more things in your agenda like M4A, cancelling student debt, and raising taxes on the ultra wealthy to pay for it. Instead Biden is campaigning on “nothing will fundamentally change”
If it gets you out of office I’m good with that.  We’ll have Biden fix it later!
Whoever becomes the vice president will hopefully replace Biden in 4 years, regardless.
Not excited about Joe Biden? Not excited that you may not like his VP pick? Then grit your teeth and vote for for him anyway or it will be another very exciting and horrible 4+ years.
Idk AfQ Cheney was selected bc of gravitas (which W lacked &amp; Biden doesn't; latter needs vibrance, youth). Also..
I’m waiting for the market to turn down right before election. Will be a lot of talk saying Biden is winning or neck and neck. That’s the time to load up. When Trump wins, the markets will rocket again. Think about how many times Americans have voted for another pres after 4 yrs.
So ... maybe a politics editor shouldn’t plan to take a Christmas vacation? 😭
That's ageism.  Stop with that.
Oil &amp; gas are life blood of the US economy &amp; necessary to the recovery! How does Biden plan to pay for AOC's Green New Deal or Bernie's socialist agenda? TAX INCREASES! I don't know about you but I have enjoyed the lower tax rates these past 3 years. It's my money not giverments!
Kamala hasn't stopped being my number 1 pick for VP, but I'm not picking.  Joe is and I'm behind his choice.
#LittleDonnieDictator, #FatNixon, is jealous as hell of Obama and Biden and Fauci.
She is too old for Biden so who 😮
Biden’s your guy, not ours.
MSM getting in their last digs for creating chaos and clickbait before Biden announces his VP. Dissent is natural and groups of people are like herding cats. I wouldn't worry about this.
Biden is LITERALLY A FORMER VP EYEING THE PRESIDENCY Jesus Christ these peopleI figured out why there is such a coin shortage everyone is melting them down to make bullets in case biden gets elected I mean when biden gets done using black people for their votes and rigging the election
When the democrat's are done it will be the end of Our country won't be surprised if china's navy ends up on our shores if biden gets in
Wallace is just trying to egg Biden into coming on his show. Good for ratings and exposure.
Did I mention that obama brought in thousands of Muslim's and told them they don't have to obey American laws which means they can oppress women in America maybe that's why him and biden get along biden believes in that too
Late we have lost faith in you. I can't fathom why you ran for a position in leading and you won't lead. Good luck but I will be voting Biden. You could have been great
If biden wins will pelosi be saying this is the most fraudulent election in history I know I will the man should even be allowed to run for office bill got kicked out for less
A strong VP is far better than one perceived as a weak woman nicely put in her place. We want a woman being groomed to be President after Biden! Female deferring to anyman personna is not VP material.
So Biden is turning us into Wakanda? I'm down to giving it a go.
Hey  how about hiring a team of social workers for your convention. Or, just hold it in Biden’s basement, and keep the door locked.
Honest Question:  what specifically did Trump do wrong in relation to the Covid-19 response?  When Biden was asked what he would do, he failed to provide a single suggestion that hadn’t already been implemented, that is after he said Trump was xenophobic bc of travel bans.
More like dictatorship and domestic terrorism from you the scum of the the earth traitor in chief who WILL! be losing to law and order and the new sheriff in two Biden in November! Get packing!
First things first, sure. As long as there's a "second thing" next and it doesn't end there. Trump is a symptom – like leaky pus – but he isn't the disease, and Biden isn't going to be the great savior they are saying. He's a bandaid on our Democracy's hemorrhaging wound at best.
I wonder how people will feel if they have to pay another $5,000 in higher taxes for the average family under the #Biden plan. Seems to me a pandemic is not the time to raise taxes but to lower them. Trump's temporary payroll tax break seems sound to me all things considered.
Basically life long politicians like #Biden understand raising taxes better than job creation and growing an economy without raising taxes. Raising taxes is always the first thing they think of because to them its their money, not We The People's money.
Are you just mad that Bill Clinton is now pretty much confirmed to be a pedo?
The #Dems and #Biden want to raise taxes. What they don't tell people is most increases in taxes are offset by corporations by passing them on to those who can least afford them. If Biden undoes  tax cuts, will this include large family &amp; child credits too?!
Don't overthink this.  is combative, blunt, maybe not as likable as Bass, but great experience and 100 times the name recognition. I follow politics closely and had no idea who Bass was. Biden-Harris is the strongest possible ticket. Keep it simple.
Biden's go to "moves" are  wrong for everybody else ?
If you really think President Trump wants to postpone the election, you just don't get it. The Dems always do what's opposite. This is his way of getting them to cut their crap about mail in voting. Love this guy!  If he really wants to postpone until Biden debates him, I'm good.
Right!!! No way am I siding with Biden and Jo... Uh... I think the libertarian party is off its rails... Even What's his nuts that Mark endorsed is going a little nutty....
We are very pleased to have a President, Donald J. Trump,  who loves and serves the United States of America. He and his family are lifted to the Living God each and every day by our family. If Joe Biden becomes our president, our country is lost.
I don't think it's radical at all, but if you look at Biden's Climate Plan, it's a whole lot closer to The Green New Deal than his original plan after working with Bernie. So I think there's real hope of things getting done.
Biden's crime bill, Lyndon Johnson promoting welfare and encouraging single mother homes, destroying the nuclear families.
At least Trump isn’t in the Biden basement!
This is the last gasp of the DNC. "Settle for us!" I find it funny that Biden himself can't give a speech where he outlines how he'd be better than Trump.  If he really knew how to fix the US, why didn't he ever tell Obama?
98% of the black people I asked said they didn't vote for obama a second term and 99% of the people over all said they didn't so how did obama win a second term, obama is the most corrupt president We had and did nothing but take rights away from Us so will biden
Walmart great example of the obama administration taking Our rights away obama told them to down size slowly so Americans won't notice that the democrats are controlling what We buy and eat and We are letting it happen biden will continue with Obama's work
wake up America the obama administration started taking our rights away and biden and obama are bed buddies biden will continue to take Our rights away and use covid to do it with
She wants PEDO, dementia Biden running this country? How many decades in government. #TrumpLandslideVictory2020

GREAT POINT Bobby! BIDEN HAS A HISTORY OF FOOT IN MOUTH DISEASE AS WELL AS BEING PALS WITH THE LIKES OF KKK ROBERT BIRD AND HIS COMMENT ABOUT SEVEN ELEVENS AND WORKERS WITH A SLIGHT INDIAN ACCENT! OLD BOY BIDEN NEEDS TO BE HIDEN FROM HIS BIG MOUTH FROM BACK IN THE DAY!
A glimpse of life in America in 2021 if Biden wins. Biden has  already promised to recreate the Obama administration.
Qualified or not he was elected. You can be as upset as you want. The reality is Trump or Biden will win. I'd rather someone that at least knows who he is and where. It does sometimes come down to the lesser of evils.
I knew you HAD to reply Why? Deep down inside the truth hurts! Instead of posting cute little hand pictures or doom and gloom videos, try picturing your cup half full! You leftists Dems are angry and bitter people. Sorry Trump whooped your Chickie in 2016. Now? Sad pitiful Biden
What the far left don’t want to hear, is that Biden may actually be able to accomplish more left policies than Bernie ever could. Because you can accomplish more through comprise, than you can through purity.
At least you didn't fall for the sleepy Joe Biden. You should work on the rest though. There are a lot of things you believe that are just not so.
...... Well fuck me if I'm wrong, but seems like people don't actually LIKE Biden... They'll just vote him because he's not Trump.....
I really hope he chooses Susan Rice. She has national experience that Biden needs. She has a good reputation with other countries and the GOP too.
Why do all the Obama and Biden sheep keep trying to blame Trump for the cages that were built and used during the Obama administration??? 🤔
But you refuse to answer my question. When is a good time for a change? I'm not lecturing, I'm asking why should we settle for "Nothing will fundamentally change" Biden? The fact you think I am and refuse to answer tells me you know he's a bad option.
Witnesses should be called. Begin with Biden.  Appeals court schedules do-over for Flynn case.
Biden won't know if he's in a nursing home or the Oval Office. He has a handler.
That's funny, because you parrot everything the dems say. You don't have any trouble labeling me as a Trumper without knowing more, so I'm going to go with you are a stereotypical Democrat, Joe Biden lover. I think that's fair.
I’m not, your friend is. You love pedo Biden.
His enablers, the Repugs that support him scare me. People that use his ignorance to further their own agenda scare me. On his own, he’s a joke. But he has gotten away with stupid scary shit for years because of the people around him enabling him.
Great response Pickles! What is Biden talking about (top 5 questions of 2020)? So, he'll continue to hide what he's doing? He wants us to trust MSM? Heck no! I love #ourpresident speaks directly to the people.  Can't wait to vote #Trump2020LandslideVictory
Biden says you’re not Black enough if you’re not a Democrat.   I can only assume, in Herman’s case, if you’re a conservative and enormously successful, you’re not really Black at all.
obama guilty of treason, fail the black community with his broken promises, used the black community to get in office and now biden is doing the same thing Trump has done more for the black community then you ever did democrat's only know how to blame others
You Biden is a pedophile, rapist, lier ,racist and a thief, yet the democrats adore their drooling she'll of a person.
I got in trouble for just hugging a kiddo once. He ran up to me and wrapped his arms aroind me and I hugged him back. The princeple said that wasnt allowed anymore. Id never touch a kid the way Biden does
Who wants to bet John Lewis will vote for Biden...by mail?
Hey  I just wanted to know if you still stand by this
She didn't get Biden's VP choice so she's trying to get as many look at my DUMB ASS time as possible.
DAN YOU HAVE NAILED IT! AS AN 81 YEAR OLD LIFETIME REPUBLICAN; WHO REGISTERED IN THE SOUTH WHEN I REACHED VOTING AGE. THE REASON WAS THAT DEMOCRATS WERE THE KKK, SEGREGATIONIST, AND RACIST! BIDEN'S BEST FRIEND BACK IN THE DAY, ROBERT BIRD, A DEMOCRAT AND GRAND WIZARD IN THE KKK!
Make that Russia of bust since you blindly deport a traitor who sides wifi them and doesn't support our troops! American will be great again WHEN! Biden wins in November!
Did u just get off the phone with Putin &amp; he reassured u? If Biden doesn’t win, (He Will) since U said it’s going 2 be rigged maybe he should ask 4 a recount.  Did some1 tell u, U can’t stop an election? HTF did we get a fake patriot as POTUS who Doesn’t know the constitution
My Dad lived to 93, and had severe dementia for at least 8 yrs. suffice it to say, that he never appeared to be as “out of it” as Biden does every day.
Irony of ironies, “progressives” are the most regressive people you’ll ever encounter. Just in the last couple of months, they’ve transported race relations back to the 1940’s. I guess they want Biden to fix it again.
I pitied but admired the courage of Obama for stepping in to clean up Bush 43 mess. I now have the same feelings for Biden.
I don't know what is sadder, that you believe your crap, or the look you will have when Biden is trounced.
This is setting up so Trump can claim the election was rigged and he will fight it and refuse to give it up. He will not peacefully transfer power to Biden.
Lunatics.  Biden supporters.
When are the videos of Biden going full blown racial during his speeches about blacks going to go mainstream or has the Marxist LEFT forgiven THEIR PUPPET ???
About as offensive as Biden claiming that if you’re not Democrat, you’re not really Black.
It was Clyburn's backing of Biden in South Carolina. They f'd over Bernie with that endorsement. Sly Cly was paid off.
Nopety. If I was, I’d say Biden, like so many others are, just ta screw with em’. If you’re a reg. Rep, chances are very slim you’ll ever get polled. It’s how they do. 🙄🙄🙄
Fact Check: Biden Did NOT Kneel At An American Flag In His Hometown
Because then Biden couldn't be their presidential candidate.
Peter, I love you and made a lot of money following your advice with metals and miners but you have no idea what you are talking about when it comes to the re-election of trump. I literally agree with every single thing you say except that Biden will win the next election.
I think Biden can only win if he dyes his gray hair, so it looks like a cross between a dead blonde fox and a translucent tsunami.
You've expanded my Green Book theory of Biden's success. I'm more convinced now than ever.
I assume you’ve seen how many people I’ve contacted ⁦ in the government. Still, 0 views on most videos. The gov censoring my views was started by the Obama administration. Joe Biden is an extreme fascist. You can’t support him.
Ya it’s funny that you can edit Biden to look dumb, but all daddy has to do is open his mouth
Dear America:  It’s NOT about a virus  It’s NOT about Black lives  It’s NOT about Biden  It IS about removing Trump  Every voter needs to know why they need to vote FOR Trump, not against Biden.   #FeebleManBad ain’t gonna cut it!
Why? Give us your reasons for voting FOR Biden. Not reasons to vote against Trump. Explain what is so wonderful about an old man with dementia that Suddenly he is the answer?
Pelosi would lose her mind, twitching like she got tased by the Ice Cream Man. and the whole BLM Riots thing goes as limp as the Rioters at 6 am. The Squad would be sounding like Biden. Come on Man, take a shot, they aint done nothing for you.
Dry hump with Trump or sliden with Biden!
HAHA, that's what Biden wants, someone strong, able and willing to take on the Presidency understanding what it entails. Harris would also be great as the next att gen. Trump belittling Harris will go nowhere with her. Trump fears Harris!
Donald Jr...it is sad how pathetic you are...IF Biden was disabled, you would have no excuse for your comments.  IF Biden is not disabled, you would have no reason for your comments...Hmm I wonder what your motive could be, maybe power and domination?
And this has what to do with the elderly abuse they are putting Biden they??
The victim card. It’s pretty short sighted to say that. Hell I see more right wing white males crying about being oppressed than anyone right now. I’m not say Biden is the end all be all. I’m saying I’ve had four years of Trump and it sucked, he’s done nothing and it’s time to go
George HW Bush was Reagan’s main rival for president in 1980, before Reagan chose him to be VP. Gore ran for president before Clinton picked him for VP. Biden ran for president before Obama picked him for VP. Kennedy/LBJ too. Why would presidential ambition be an issue now? 🤔
Biden is all about secret laws. Biden used to stalk me after I did a hunger strike protesting the FBI giving middle schoolers free drugs. Robert Mueller got fired. Biden is going to prison. He is mediocre and greedy. We need a president who will save the planet.
This has been my prediction for how Biden's nomination was going to go from the very beginning. The running mate would assume office in his stead.  Initially, I thought it would be Hillary, but Michelle was my second guess.  Kamala Harris never registered on my radar.  We'll see.
The POTUS is asking Twitter what is going on with our allies.   Can you imagine if Obama or Biden asked suck a stupid question?
I’m sure obama is giving his input, too. I’ve read that he’s also met with many of them. I feel like Biden likes th idea that he’s passing the baton to the next generation. He got along so well with Obama. I can see him looking for someone he can mentor
I hope it’s not a secret to Biden, lol. I mean, that’s what I’m hoping for,  but will he really agree to only one term?
You need purpose. Come join my campaign. Seriously... You could be a speech writer. We’d be the funniest executive branch in history. Once the story comes out that there’s no Austin Bomber confession, neither Trump nor Biden have a shot.
Obama’s are very out of shape and Biden is 🤪🤪code 2 work out and the stimulant shots wearing off
It’s called an election. The higher the COVID death toll, the larger Biden’s margin of victory. It’s chapter 1 in the book entitled “How to destroy a nation with just a virus and some well orchestrated riots”.
Jill Biden
Biden slams Trump for promoting false COVID-19 claims from 'crazy woman'
You'll...beat Biden off?  Seriously, as one person with bipolar to another - take your meds. #MentalHealthMatters
Biden will never be an acting president.They will have him deemed unstable if he wins and his VP will actually be president.Think about that for a moment.If in fact Pelosi tells Biden to pick K. Harris(what? You actually thought Biden gets to pick. You funny)she will run things
Trump will turn on Pence and blame the terrible Covid response on him and then run Nikki Haley. Just to try and get some excitement going for his base.  I'm ready for Biden/Harris to happen.
Why are none of the Republicans working? I have heard nothing of them working to get the virus controlled or help the people struggling. Do they not have to work any more till Biden takes over? Because Trump's on his way out they don't work?
Joe Biden has been "fixing" things since the 1970s.  Do things look fixed to you?  This logic exercise didn't go the way you anticipated, I'm sure.
Now do Biden, a politician since the 70s.
Oh heck yeah and that is why he will never go on stage head to head with Trump. He would crush Biden and Biden would have to have a hidden screen in the podium!! Now he can do it in his basement.
Yeah.....Joe Biden.....he's a big thinker and a incredible speech maker.  Can't wait to see him against President Trump in a debate.  Then people will realize what a big thinker he is.  How could Trump compete with his level of intellect?
Trump is only person putting any real work into Biden’s campaign.
Biden photographed with Kamala Harris talking points as running mate speculation grows  #getwokeness
I mean Trump literally just tweeted TODAY that he is supporting the rollback of provisions meant to alleviate de jure segregation. Bringing up stuff Biden voted for 25 years ago isn't really going to prove your point when your guy is doing this stuff right now.
Biden repeatedly forgets his location and the subject on which he is speaking in mid-sentence. The most recent example was just yesterday. Slandering Trump will not change the fact your POTUS candidate is plainly descending into dementia.
Nice try. The same could be said about Biden and the Dems. Alinsky much?
Like Obama did when he had democratic majorities (or even supermajorities) in the house and senate? All we got then was watered down Romneycare which was a gift to the health insurance industry. Biden is to the right of Obama. You're delusional.
It's called exploitation and elder abuse.
Dem media polling evidence fully supports the shy Trump voter hypothesis. Despite Trump supporters being far more enthusiastic to vote than Biden supporters, the Dem media polling has Biden winning the horse race against Trump with Reagan level margins. Massive disconnect.
Will your taxes pay the extremely high welfare and food stamp program explosion that will happen if that perv Biden wins?  Oh yeah money is free for those programs, stupid me!
Where’s Biden’s mask?
You lack all the values and morals needed to serve this great diversified nation. Biden 2020!
#StillYourPresident  LOL  Y'all really should have put of a decent candidate in 2016.  Who are you gonna actually run in 2020, instead of biden?
Then we’ll either have a shitty president or a shitty president. There are no good options. I really wish you’d have attacked Biden as hard as you attacked Hillary then there might actually be hope for the future
1) Putin is having a party 2) The other countries have increased payment 5 yrs in a row. Biden was VP when it started.  Trump has used our $ has his personal account. He’s signed budgets for military funds then takes it back for his bs. He’s made the world less safe.
Totally agree. Trump campaign is as feeble as Biden, currently playing only defense, and playing it from the dugout. Pathetic.
It’s NOT Trump v. Biden. It’s Trump v. Never Trump.  Never Trump strategy =&gt; Hide, deny and distort every single Trump accomplishment.   Trump strategy =&gt; Biden has dementia.  Trump strategy should be to proclaim and explain every accomplishment, over, over, and over again 24x7!
It's ok, at least he doesn't think his Covid tests are cognitive tests like Biden.  "I get those daily", lol, Good Luck with your nominee if he isn't suicided before the convention.
I hate Biden but. Imagine if Biden said half the shit Trump says. Would #maga Support him?  #NobodyLikesMe
If the state of America on July 29, 2020 doesn’t put fire in the belly of every single Republican alive, nothing ever will. That said, they are doing absolutely NOTHING, and Trump’s campaign is still trying to convince us that Joe Biden might have dementia. 😞
I would have loved nothing more than for Bernie Sanders to be in Biden’s place. But the reality is this: The broken system that is in place had no room for Bernie. If you/we ever want someone like Bernie. WE HAVE TO THROW THE SYSTEM AWAY AND START OVER! #TheEnd
Officially, Joe Biden's net worth is nine million dollars.  Also official: i do not believe that.
Except rose Twitter wasn't like that and I'm still waiting for you to explain how Bernie is racist 😂 I mean, theres a huge list as to why biden is a racist piece of shit, but do go on how Bernie is racist

Breaking News: EVERYBODY knows Hydroxychloroquine works. Fauci knows it. Biden knows it. That is NOT the issue.  The issue is that OUR views/message are barely rattling around in our tiny little echo chamber. The debate is currently 97% being controlled/muted/retrofitted.
Biden is no better.
So you admit that Biden is racist? Thank fuck a Biden supporter could finally admit some sort of truth
'its your fault Trump lost because you didn't vote for him!' or maybe Biden lost because he didn't do enough to earn the votes from voters.
You and your clueless parent,  , need to figure out that Hickenlooper and Biden are NOT the opponents. They are mere distractions from the real enemies, and the real agenda.
Not at all funny. If you’re Dad could stop for one second, getting all lathered up over stupid Joe Biden, he’d realize who his real opposition is.
True, but millions of viewers thought Barr was rightfully humiliated, and the Trump Administration openly and justly condemned. Meanwhile, Trump and most of Twitter are blathering about stupid a Joe Biden.
You and your campaign better WAKE UP.   Joe Biden is NOT your opponent. Your opponent is “Never Trump”. It includes all Media, Hollywood, Big Tech, Democrats, Antifa, BLM, many Republicans, the Deep State, etc.   If you keep fixating on stupid Joe, you’re screwed.
If Joe Biden was calling the shots he would be fine. But everybody knows that Nancy Pelosi and the Democratic Party is using him as a puppet.

Joe Biden wants to cheat again
How you look blaming Biden for the state of our current affairs. You're the President, and look at the country.  Disease riddled. Economically devastated. Your stormtroopers beating up singing moms and veterans in the streets.  150,000 of us dead.  This is Trump's America.
#Biden #Biden2020 damn Biden supporters, there really isn't much of a difference between them and #trump supporters at this point.
Biden should pick Senator Duckworth for VP, but he’ll probably pick someone terrible.
Biden and Demorats are communist and wants to make the USA communist country!  Do you research!
I think Biden will pick Susan Rice for his VP because Obama will make him repay her for all the lies she told for them and all the cover she tried throw out there for them in their little plot.
Biden should tap Madeleine for VP.
I don’t ever condone pedo Biden’s actions, NEVER. .... I’m OVER the hill.
I believe that if Biden and his cronies take the White House... Every single person that the left can find that supported Trump, will have a Target on them. We have to stay strong and keep Donald Trump right where he is.
Don’t disagree that it’s a mess, but I still think it’s important to vote and that it’s important to vote for Biden. But that’s me.
for gods sake that was biden oboma with kids in the cages, did jesus not inform you.
WOW Biden came out of the basement and took some softball questions from preselected reporters. I wander how many drugs they had to give him to get through it.
So thankful it isn’t the 2.5 Million projected. Glad Trump ignored Fauci, Pelosi, and Biden when they called him xenophobic for closing flights from China. Now if Dem governors had the intelligence to keep nursing homes safe and Hydro hadn’t been blocked bc of politics...
Remember women if you vote for biden your saying it's alright for men to sexually assault women and alright for women to sexually assault men, bill clinton got kicked out for a blow job what will it take for biden to get kicked out
😂, can’t understand how people can vote for senile Biden.
i mean, to be fair, it's sorta like bernie comparing biden to FDR recently
i would say they [dems] they would say anything which they would,but its so much more sinister than that. but biden doesnt know we are not dependent for oil and gas? oohh re: UHKRAINIA.
News flash so does biden and the rest of the democrat's biden's whole campaign has been based on hate and lies even though he has been caught on video and yet women are still willing yo vote for him and yet want to cry about all these men sexually assaulting women
The Clintons brought him in , Obama and Biden fan the coals to start him back to life
Joe Biden has said he will choose a female running mate, and has faced pressure within the party to choose a woman of color.
I had to turn it off. Between talking to my liberal friends, watching the Barr “hearing” today and listening to Biden lie through his teeth, it is obvious that they aren’t interested in the truth.
It reads as if Biden named it himself with no staff input 😂
The best way I've heard it put is nobody knows anyone who voted for Trump planning to vote for Biden and as this cycle ramps up and Biden is forced to speak, more people on the fence will either not vote or vote against him.
Hasn’t Biden said he plans to add and or correct ACA, which is very popular, with private options? Neither party should go all the way to one side.
Biden taking questions from reporters by name. NOT one question about his dealings with Ukraine
If #WilliamBarr continues talking over the questions and evading answering he should be held in contempt. We’re so screwed if Trump loses the election. There’s no way Barr will force him out for Biden they don’t care about the first illegal act, they won’t care about the last.
Biden emphasizes Trump's mishandling of COVID-19 in new ad campaign targeting older voters
Biden tweeters are all full of 💩.
Joe Biden didn't speak to anyone but Corn Pop.
I'm failing to imagine the difference, since Biden has refused to condemn the Portland gestapo.
A potentially bigger question is what if the president loses the election but just refuses to leave?
I was told today that because I feel progressive  politicians voting against progressive policy does not make them progressive then because I'm not all in for Biden I'm a racist because I don't agree with the black vote. When I asked how framing the entirety of the democratic 1/2
i would quit giving biden this much air space  we know the dem party is lying to steal the election!
Going to Biden’s inauguration
must have taken “duck and cover” lessons from Biden. It’s actually encouraging seeing these cowards back on their heels.
I was going to vote Biden as the lesser of two evils, but now I can only vote green and cross my fingers, and hope the country becomes progressive after 4 years before we have a full economic and environmental disaster. Sigh.
Trump this. Trump that. Biden this. Biden that. Just another morning of bullshit on Twitter.  This Dark Magic coffee is pretty damn good though.
Joe Biden is a puppet you can’t vote for him. He copies everything Donald Trump says. As long as he does what the Democrats. Because you know he can’t think for himself.

democraps want to blame Trump for everything because pelosi and the media says he's the problem but do your research and see all the things the democrat's have done especially obama biden's buddy
Have Democrats and the media just become aware of these new discoveries called digital video and the internet?  Protests are “peaceful”? Antifa is a “myth”? BLM “cares” about Black lives? Hydroxychloroquine is “ineffective/dangerous”? Biden is “coherent”?
Imagine how much money would be raised for every tweet biden made for blaming Trump sorry one man does not run this country but one woman is trying like hell too that would be dictator pelosi
Do you really think Biden &amp; Trump are the same  The President appoints EVERYONE. Biden is still a fascist.  should call Joe “Sneaky Joe”. Trump’s appointments are destroying the economy.
Biden can’t win. Before the election, Biden will be arrested. Trump will also be arrested. The  is going to defend the Constitution and stop the traitors.
Trump is losing big to Biden in voter polls. Here’s how this will likely play out on Election Day
Things under Biden are bound to be better than under Trump. If you’re not voting for Biden, what are you going to do?

If I were a Biden supporter and I heard a bunch of Bush staffers were going to support Biden, wouldn't that be enough to know you're on the wrong side?
Regardless of your politics and whether you like Biden or not, we have to get the monster out of the Whitehouse.  He's a vile, disgusting piece of dirty scum and he needs to be gone just as soon as possible. #TrumpIsANationalDisgrace
Its worse w/ur goons. Their litterly beating moms,dads &amp; vets.Uv trashed USA.Biden will make it better it’ll take yrs 2 fix the disasters. He won’t gas,beat or shoot Americans.He won’t stay silent while Putin kills our soldiers. He won’t be so proud that he’d kill us 2 save face.
HIDIN' BIDEN 😂 Debate got u sweatin? Oh man, I really hope they debate. If the MLB can play a game, they can debate on a stage lol    Can't wait.
biden's commercial says I'm a leader who won't blame others and biden and pelosi's whole campaign has done nothing but blame others more lies by the democrat's
I wonder if biden's masks are made out of used panties
The whole scenario of #Trump not leaving office is ridiculous.   BIDEN NEEDS TO WIN THE ELECTION FIRST!   Democrats need to campaign like  is 10 points down.
NBC News/Marist poll: Biden leads in North Carolina by 7 points  via
This angers me so much! 1. As a woman, I've had more advantages than men at 99% of the jobs I've had.  2. Biden didn't write this.  He would never say "of color", he would have used a derogatory term.100% truth! Go take a nap Joe!
How is what I said any different from what you said? Not supporting Biden and "not being involved because you disagree", are basically the same exact statement.
Remember change is made in increments within a functioning and established government process.  What may be to the advantage of Biden’s administration is that lots of things have been broken and major change can occur.
Are you really claiming right now that Bernie didn't say it would be irresponsible for his supporters to not support Biden? And yes he said "if", regarding the FDR comment, but, why does that matter? Its not even true.
Something will happen that will prevent Biden from debating.  Democrats don’t want him up there.

He admitted in an interview that he is saying that because that's what Joe said. It's nonsense and you know it that Bernie is backing Biden.

Ghislaine Maxwell arrest sends tremors through Epstein’s celebrity circle. Madonna and Hanks left the USA for good. France and Greece do not extradite. Maxwell also said Biden and Fauci visited island numerous times. Democrats want Biden. I see plot now!
Chris Wallace is a douche but do u think the Biden campaign can keep him from speaking other than pre scripted lines for the entirety of the campaign? I mean at some point he’ll have to debate Trump, right?
He sounds like he’s trying to get at Joe Biden being the reason we’re in this shit vs Trump/Kanye being from the outside of the political crews that got us here.   But his words just say he’s here to sabotage shit cause he doesn’t like Joe.
“Biden has committed to selecting a woman to be his Vice President and an African American woman to be his first nominee to the U.S. Supreme Court”  Haha by all means just select them not because they’ve earned it, but simply bc they’re women, cuz that’s the woke thing to do 🤦🏻‍♂️

In 2016 HRC was extremely unpopular, many couldn’t bring themselves to vote for her and she still won the popular vote. People also thought Trump might be a moderate too. We now have seen Trump as ineffective, radical and corrupt and Biden is seen as much more palatable than HRC.
Trump isn’t running against Biden. He’s running against “Never Trump”, and I hope his campaign figures that out before November 3rd. The message needs to be “Only Trump”!
How can they hold her debates against her? Every1 did it. That’s what u do when ur competing. I’d think her record while DA would be the issue. Biden doesn’t need Any1 w/scandal around him, especially regarding woman. Please don’t screw it up Mr VP!

Ironic considering how much ink was spilled about Biden’s “articulate” comments about Obama In the 2008 primary.

Let it be so then hold on to your hats until Biden's swearing in, it's going to be a bumpy ride!
13 years of corrupt democrat's is enough a vote for biden is a vote saying We support sex offenders and corruption and We want Our rights taken away
His campaign needs to resist distraction, and focus on Trump’s accomplishments. Just calling Biden feeble isn’t going to be enough. The opponent isn’t Biden. The opponent is “Never Trump”.
Trump is president not Biden.
It can't. He'll do anything dirty to make it happen. Our DEMS will have to be willing to die to get Biden elected. His stupid people won't believe the virus is true and will come out in droves. I hope some of our stupid lazy people will realize that this is where we live or die.
Biden Goes Crazy, Says That Military Would Intervene Against Trump  via  Right Patriot

According to Biden you mean?? Its on record
Huge tax cut would be nice. Or at least don't tax us next year on this "covid income" stimulus money. But then again, that's already guaranteed if Biden reaninates long enough to win.
100 days to till We vote nadler, schumer, schiff, biden and pelosi out the 4 most corrupt politician's in office had enough of the corruption and lies all you guys do is act like kids and play the blame I can only pray that enough Americans opened their eyes to the truth
We have to stop the lies to the Democratic American people! They are NOT voting Joe Biden but rather the 25th amendment! He and the DNC HAS announced his VP pick, The 25th AMENDMENT
I'm sorry but his 40 years of history, intelligence, education and knowledge is there in his mind only at times. He has forgotten things and it is unfortunate that the Democratic party is using him. You're not voting for Biden you are voting for the 25th amendment. #sadbuttrue
Not a Biden supporter, but you just can’t not get a big smile and giggle from this.
Live in Colorado so mail in ballot as soon as I get it! Woo hoo Go Biden! BYEDON!
Your campaign needs to be 💯% focused on why America needs to vote FOR you. Don’t waste resources on Biden. His failings are obvious. Hiding in his basement, ducking legitimate interviews and refusing to debate.  ps. Don’t agree to ANY unfair debate terms or moderators.
Almost nobody will vote “for” Biden. Their strategy is all about how many people can they get to vote “against”    The Trump campaign seems to be almost oblivious to this. They need to devote ALL of their resources to showing America why they must vote FOR Trump.
If Trump wins they will sense they are losing and riot with five times the intensity of their current rage, but if Biden wins they will sense they are winning and riot with five times the intensity of their current rage.    This will not end 04 November 2020.
I’m surprised they don’t have cardboard cut outs of fans with Antifa, BLM, or Biden t-shirts, hats, or signs.
Yeah....we all remember 3 days before 2016 election that Trump was down 84 to 16 to Hillary. So..one has to be a a few cards short of a full deck to believe political polls. Of course it's hard to deny all the excitement Biden is generating with his powerful speeches. #3timeloser
You're right, Joe isn't, but Hunter sure is. How do you think that is happening? Could it be that Biden sold his influence to help his family? What do we call that? Quid pro quo?
Black people keep voting for all these black democrat's making promises believing they will help only to find out how empty they are so do you really think a white democrat like biden is going to keep them
Biden away in a crack den.
I regret having once admired Paul Ryan. Disillusionment began when he blew the debate with Biden the Bogus.

Over that senile pedo Biden? Well hell yes.
My fear is the red states that Biden and the Senate need to flip won't because of "law and order" fears.
yeah, what are we gonna do? Magically get all his constituents off the right wing prop? Biden's a reasonable, decent human being who restore balance in our country. You choose to be passionate about your candidate. I think there is plenty to be enthusiastic about his campaign.

Yeah, no thanks to you bud. Biden ain't that bad. You really think after 30 years of the GOP's scorched earth approach that taking on the oligarchy right away is going to win the election? He's smarter than you think.
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
look man, i get it, you hate on people who are enthusiastic about not letting our country slide into despotic authoritarian fascism, but if we don't elect Biden, our country is going to slide into despotic authoritarian fascism. so deal.
Neither will Joe Biden!
I think Americans will vote for the candidates who they feel best represents them... But then again, no blacks will vote for Trump... Remember......Biden will remove their race card.

For me it's as soon as I get a ballot. I KNOW whom I'm voting for: Joe Biden &amp; every dem on the ballot.
I just watched it, beyond awesome. "Fear City", then "Dirty Money", "Trump, the American Dream", and "Epstien", all of them exposed how corrupt and dirty Trump was, and also how much of a evil sociopath he is!
Yeah! Kanye can beat Biden off
I found them, it is called You-Tube and was one of the reason I did not vote for him, when I was a republican! The second reason which was harder to find and thanks to Netflix they have, is his criminal activities as a so called business man!
But how can this be, because according to the evangelicals out there, Trump is the second coming of Christ, almost! Only Trump can save Christianity---yes, they actually say that!
Believe it or not, there are many people enthusiastic about electing Biden, and there are enough swing voters who won’t vote for trump this time around.
You did well. I hope you end up in a WH national security job in a Biden administration. He (and all of us) will need people in there with your integrity.
And he calls Biden creepy, no he is the evil creepy......🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮 #Biden2020
Astonishingly infantile. That said, Joe Biden wouldn’t have even a 1 in 10 chance of comprehending what the debate is even about.
A die hard Trump supporter told me today that if Biden is elected, the country is going to fall apart.  Tell me what that looks like.  Will cities be burning for months as chaos reigns in the streets, government fails at all levels, and everyday citizens are terrorized by thugs?
Joe Biden could not even name his own top 10 policies. Suggesting that he’ll ambitiously implement them is just “out there”.
Tell me, “Genius”! What you think of Joe Biden! Please!!
Bit dog always barks FIRST, RUFF RUFF BIDEN.
It’s really sad that Black American politicians think that giving EVERY Black American $20,000 would HELP! This is just what Biden wants to do with his “Reparations”!!!

Something tells me basement Biden won’t be doing interviews with him
We get it. You have TDS and it's clouded your brain beyond reason. You can't see past the hatred and somehow think Biden is cognitive and will do a good job. You really are delusional.
Credit where credit is due! Obama was term-limited. So a new President was mandated. Also, Obama and Biden didn’t pander to the white nationalism and white supremacy crowd. You did a heckuva job stirring up a nest of snakes. So yeah, in way, Obama and Biden are to blame for you!
We are going to vote for Biden in November. That is how bad we think Trump is.

Haaaa!! I thought so as it is obvious!! You are sooooo like the rest of the Biden sheep. You all know Biden is having memory and cognitive issues but oh well let’s vote for him. Well..... good luck with that!
Thats why its all about Biden for them. Over a thousand candidates and all they talked about were the establishment stooges.
SORRY Calling BS. Trump is the President right now. Not Elmo Biden. Fix the problem NOW and quit yapping about it. Please

Or We can choose four years of corruption and biden crying it's Trump's fault I'm failing as a leader, it's Trump's fault The People rebelled against me but at least obama was right you can make millions
Coming from a man who made millions, violated the Constitution and took rights away away from people, committed treason and gave terrorists millions, gave guns to Mexico which ended back up on Our streets let's all listen to him apparently biden is
Does Biden remember reading his?

In a way I hope biden wins so America can see how corrupt he is
If biden wins the democrat's will emerge strong while AMERICAN'S lose Our rights
And out of those how many show no signs of being sick and how many have died, biden also forgets We are one of the most populated country with large over crowded cities
And btw Biden never said he wanted to defund the police and I have no clue where you're getting abolishing Independence Day from, so if those are the things you think are going to lose him support, you're in for a pretty big surprise come November.
Hillary was historically disliked by a lot of people on the left even and still got almost 66 million votes. Biden doesn’t have decades of dislike to contend with. So yea he’s got more support than Hillary. It’s going to be a landslide all right, just not the way you’re thinking
Fucking brilliant! Im still voting for Biden... but, I'm game for you to be VP 😊
Their vote is for Biden! And “Walks on Eggshells” Lightfoot!!
#nolivesmatter black face n bomb hypocrisy. Get out of your basement baby Biden
Any thought that their opposition to Garland or any Supreme Court nominee under Obama was principled under the "Biden Rule" went away after that statement.
It is not, what these federal agents are doing is a violation of their oath to defend the Constitution, because they are violating it completely! Every one of them need to be fired after Biden gets into office and prosecuted!
If Biden wins, the Dems may not wait until January to “suddenly realize” that he is incompetent and move to replace himself with the VP. Regardless, if Biden wins, Pelisi will be the de facto President.
And it will be much better to see Biden and Obama unveil this one together

I'm not saying that  Biden is the better choice, just that a lot of people who were on the fence aren't enamored with Trump anymore. I don't like Trump, but he's doing a smidge better than Biden, but that's because Biden isn't doing anything, and his handlers are only pandering

Well a lot of people are losing trust in Trump, and his tarrifa against imports aren't helping. He might not tank as bad as Biden, but it might not be the boom he had first time around.
Has it occurred to anyone that maybe Biden and Trump are both idiots, people are projecting genius onto ineptitude, and we should shrink the influence of the Office of the President into a much less impactful factor in our daily lives?

Gonna be sad to see media run with Biden talking about Trump's racism over Trump sending his Gestapo troops into cities to quell protests.I'm sure it technically could be done, but it would be suicide for Biden to go anywhere near it. The Dem base wants to see trump tried for crimes against humanity.
Biden won't pardon him. trump might abdicate the throne to Pence at the last minute, though, so he can do it. And I'd bet Pence would.
This is taking on the proportions of predicting the NFL/NBA draft. Who’s the first, second, third pick and why? Biden needs to pick a VP, so they can begin to campaign, get their vision out there and defeat Trump and the party before country Republicans.
It won’t be even close. It’ll be a blowout Biden win.

If pointing out Biden’s position on universal healthcare, which is not a secret and which he has defended repeatedly and refuses to change, counts as “helping trump,” then may we not surmise that Biden’s policy itself is the problem here??? jfc
The level of vitriol coming from blue-no-matter-who twitter over a legitimate policy criticism against Biden is...hoo boy,
So, get on with it. Refer to Biden as Mr. Biden, Nancy as Ms. Pilosi be calm and DO NOT bring up anything that will not help win. Otherwise attack 12 hours per day and lay waste to the LEFT.... send this on to DJT.
No, it's not a useful thread. It plays right into Trump's hands, because there is no scenario short of a military coup where the GOP can unilaterally affect anything about election timing. And Biden can easily win without any state that has a GOP trifecta.
Florida is a Trump must-win state, NOT a Biden must-win. If Florida decides not to participate, Trump loses, period.

Endorse Biden. PLEASE help end the horror.
That time when a Joe Biden showed he studied up on authoritarianism, unlike others that might be caught unaware.
Have they? The economy is about to take a massive dump. And the population is beginning to wake up to the fact they’ve been duped.  That didn’t happen under Obama. Biden is a very safe bet right now, if I’m a billionaire. Let the people think they’re in control for a while.
But again, only if a certain handful of rich folks think they are actually better off with the loose orange cannon than with Biden, a guy who will still be in their pocket, anyway.
The GOP doesn’t matter. All that matters is who the capital police back. Don’t underestimate how many friends Biden has in Washington. The Dems picked him for a reason.
All that really matters is whether a handful of rich people believe they’ll be better off with Biden this time around. (It’s not like he’s going to rock their boat too hard.) Armed insurrections won’t last long. Especially those led by whiny white dudes.

I think Bo Biden's choice would be Kamala Harris. They were very close when they were both AGs. And in the end, I suspect that may be the most influential, albeit quiet, voice in Joe Biden's ear.
My gut reaction was that you were being a tad optimistic. if Biden wins, you may be right on the timing and the numbers. If Trump wins, God help us. He will never get that Viral Economics means you get the virus under control and then you get the economy moving again.
Good luck with that Liz. I'm sure throwing your political weight behind Joe "don't-worry-nothing-will-change" Biden was exactly the way to get this done and done quickly. You go 'em.
Total BS reasoning.  Harris is ambitious, as are almost all politicians that have reached that level of success.  Biden likely a 1-term president.  She'd be a great pick.
Kamala Harris is a badass and we wld be lucky to have her as VP. This year more than any other it's important to have someone who cld step into the role of president at a moment's notice and she is eminently capable. These "allies" shld be ashamed and I hope Biden ignores them.
Like you can do any of that "Basement Biden" or is that "Brain Dead Biden"?
One does not just take the Presidency. Biden will be 82 before he leaves office if elected. That would be only right for her to slot up. It makes the most sense. Can they not fuck this up? That’d be great.
P/1 DNC owned and operated by many of the monied interests that support Trump. Thats why if Biden gets elected the people will have to get together on massive demonstrations Democrats Vote AGAINST Including Popular Ideas In Their Platforms  via
Also, NO SHIT Kamala Harris wants to be president. SHE RAN FOR PRESIDENT THIS YEAR. That's partially WHY she's being vetted by the Biden team. That anyone thought saying this out loud would be helpful is shameful and proves that the Democratic party still has MILES to go.
This is misogynoir, full stop. Whether you like Kamala Harris or not, deriding her as a VP candidate as "too ambitious" is flat out sexist and racist. Whoever is spewing may be a Biden ally, but they're no ally of mine.
Practically salivating to hit the Hickenlooper and Biden buttons in November. I will crawl over broken glass if I have to, too.
Don't care if it's Biden +99, as long as people are voting in person during a pandemic the polls mean nothing.  If Dems are over confident it will be 2016 all over again.

Part of the issue the progressive left has with Biden is that he doesn’t support their agenda! This couldn’t be further from the truth. Then again, POTUS definition of radical left is anyone who thinks for themselves!

Nina Turner's analogy of Biden as "half a bowl of shit" is so out of line and reprehensible.  Biden is a full bowl of shit, and whitewashing down to half a bowl of shit is misrepresentation.
The next time you blame a leftist for withholding their Biden vote, recognize that the Joe Biden campaign is far more divisive to them in the first place.

Meanwhile Joe Biden remains silent on alien DNA.
‘In 2016, Trump barnstormed the industrial Midwest, arguing NAFTA and the decision to allow China to join the global trading system eliminated millions of American jobs. That position helped him capture Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin ... ‘
Biden absolutely.
In a probabilistic forecast, what would you consider a failure? If the model on Election Day gives Biden, say, a 95 percent chance of winning and Trump pulls it out, do you look at that as a model failure, or do you say, "Well, we said he had a five-percent shot?"
"The Latest: Biden Says He Hasn't Been Tested for Coronavirus" by The Associated Press via NYT
As if this wasn't already obvious. The left isn't concerned about capturing non existent centrist voters with Biden. We are living in a cartoon world.
Absolutely agree! We must get out and Vote! Thankful Bernie is supporting Biden, let’s all get this done. Ryan is just a pathetic loser and very similar baby fits like our President!
Truth.  I mean, does Cruz and Sasse come as hard on a no with any spending bills ... if Mitch greases those skids?  Of course not.  I hope Schumer reinstates ... especially as Biden doesn’t want to get rid of the filibuster. And he will need 5/7 GOP votes to get to 60.
We “hold women to higher and sometimes downright unrealistic standards of “niceness” and communality, which is a recipe for misogyny as soon as they make the slightest misstep.”    Damned if we do. Damned if we don’t. Damn.

Trump has political instincts.  Biden does not.  I am sticking with my earlier prediction. Biden will lose. Guaranteed.  This prediction is only valid if the revolution isn't before the election. If it is, I don't even have a guess. I hope it's someone I've never heard of.

Chip in to elect Joe Biden
To pay for Joe Biden's re-election just like the BLM protests took in 3.2 billion dollars exactly is Joe Biden took in 3.2 billion dollars even regular government funds are being put towards subverting our own system and paying outside agitators 2 come in break up stifle recovery
Once Biden takes office on Jan 21st, I look forward to focusing my energy back on our environment.
No no. The “people in school” is Biden in your analogy. Except for the “I’m sorry” part.
Trump wins, arrests Obama/Biden, sends troops everywgere to “keep the peace.” Next season starts in 2026: Trump still “President,” troops w/ new uniforms (maybe red white and black I don’t know), covid-ravaged streets are empty. Store fronts boarded up. People wish they’d voted.
She is so perfect for the position and for this time, that it almost seems like a gift from heaven. Hopefully, from my lips to Biden's ears!
I see no reason for a debate between Biden and Trump.
The fact that Biden is considered liberal is insane to me.
We will by voting for Joe Biden and every other Democrat on every ballot.  #ResignNowTrump
Well, gee, I'm not white and I agree. I didn't like the way she ambushed Biden. Everything with her was just too scripted, too made-for-tv "gotcha" lines, and -given her background as a prosecutor- seemed like she was trying to "chameleon" her way to the top.
But, really, this dynamic gives Biden cover not to pick her; which he doesn’t want to do.   And that’s ultimately why Elizabeth Warren won’t be our VP pick (even though she should really be the one at the top of the ticket.)  4/4
Which means it’s pretty unlikely that Biden picks her as the nominee (as much as I’d like her to be!). If he does, he is betting that Dems will win at least four other seats (and lose Alabama and Massachusetts).   That’s a big and risky bet.   3/
I find participating in local politics very rewarding.  I will say Biden was pushed further left by Warren, Bernie and their supporters. You might not get your personal pick, but you will be getting a more progressive candidate because of all the people that raised their voices.

How do you feel about Biden's current stance on the cannabis industry?
Why should she feel remorse? It was a criticism Biden should have been prepared for, delivered masterfully, in a contest for who should lead United States. She has nothing to feel bad about. Biden doesn't need a yes-woman, he needs someone unafraid to tell him when he's wrong.

Once the thaw hits next April or so, the Biden groundskeeping team will find a slew of bones and other weird items interred all over the lawn, despite the absence of any dogs during the period of the Trumps' occupancy. We already know he doesn't sleep much at night.
...and we’ve got to make this a landslide victory for Biden. There can be no doubt that Trump loses by millions!!!!
Agreed, once Biden wins in November, all the rioting will stop, and our economy will go back to normal. The virus will also go away.
I have never seen two candidates more unfit for the moment than Trump &amp; Biden.  100% utterly and completely unfit.

Listening to this makes me wonder if you could make an argument that Joe Biden is the most conservative candidate in the race.
Yes. Because it's a chance to wipe out Trump's only narrative: "Joe Biden is in hiding because he's too senile to answer questions. "  Get in there! Answer questions. Mike drop!
Yeah well, I live in a rural area and I’m surrounded by MAGA’s on all sides. I have a large Biden sign. They yell things and flip me off. Don’t care. But if they step one foot on my property, a red hat is going to be removed from 500yds away. No consultant needed.
Better alternative? Joe Biden in a Weekend At Bernie’s scenario could do a better fucking job than this dipshit. 40 million jobless? 150,000 dead in four months and getting worse? And don’t dare say it wasn’t his fault. He’s the president. It’s his job to protect us.
Can you just come out and call him fat? Next to photos of the very fit Obama &amp; also Biden actually looks pretty fit as well. Maybe show him getting fatter over the years. That will annoy him.

Biden has been the presumptive nominee since April. There have been many week to week polling swings that are more than 1% since then. The DOF do drop, but this model is very sensitive to factors outside of the typical nomination cycle
Irony about the “this would be Biden’s America” as it happens under Trump aside; If you dress as a Nazi, you’re definitely a Nazi.
Ah yes. The use of the term "Repug" allows me now to understand where you're coming from. You're clearly a tribalist. The absence of any evaluation of Biden relating to morality or ethics confirms that.

Central Pa: Biden 6%, Trump 85% - sad but true ....
Okay, so look at PA for example. 3 months ago, your weighted polling numbers showed it within 1% and today it is Biden +7%. How do you account for the uncertainty of changing polls in next 3 months?   I'd expect the likelihood of the election outcome to be lower (60% not 95%)
Ok. We may get a chance to find out who is right and who is not.  We have loads of Biden history to look at. But let's ignore all the rapes and the wars.

I think she'll be the best president if Biden doesn't make it through his term.  She has the policy chops to make real change.  I don't trust her political instincts - she had a lot of moves that backfired during the campaign - so maybe better to have her as VP than top of ticket

Biden, with whatever faults he has, is 1000 times better than Trump. Worst subhuman to ever get near the presidency
You want Biden to take a cognitive test to show he is mentally fit to be President. He has released years of his taxes to show he is fiscally honest. Why won’t you do that? RELEASE YOUR TAXES OR HUSH.
"Progressives hate incrementalism, but they’re learning to take what they can get from Joe Biden." writes   Really? Am I misunderstanding the meaning of the word "progressive"? Surely she means "centrists"?
Biden is largely adopting Inslee's climate plan. He has Bernie people on his policy teams for education and health care. He's behind the times on weed but he won't stop states from legalizing it and won't prosecute it federally. Those are all major steps in the right direction.
But since it's happening right now, it is LITERALLY Trump's America  I think it's hilarious that the GOP is highlighting  Trump's many and most egregious failures in an effort to discredit Biden. At this point, Biden doesn't even need a campaign, you're doing it for him

DNC picks who we vote for, they pick our VP, and with 85% of Democrats want M4A they voted no on that. So Democrats, they are not for the people, they are for themselves and money. I'm not voting for Biden. The DNC isn't telling me what to do. They are all rich white people.

When 45 says there will be violence in every town if Biden wins, he’s not talking about protesters. He’s talking about the violence he will ask for.
This is not an accurate account of the article. It's not saying she'll be disloyal, just distracted by the fact that her own campaign will begin about 2 years into the new Biden administration.
This is taking on the proportions of predicting the NFL/NBA draft. Who’s the first, second, third pick and why? Biden needs to pick a VP, so they can begin to campaign, get their vision out there and defeat Trump and the party before country Republicans.
It won’t be even close. It’ll be a blowout Biden win.
Seriously, A Karen Bass selection would signal that the Biden campaign is waving the white flag on Florida.
Keep in mind that people like him are calling BIDEN "far left", so their definition of "liberal" is gonna be way different than mine
This selection would have similar impact to Biden's campaign that Tim Kaine did for Clinton. 🥱
I'm registered &amp; will vote. I just hope that the administration hasn't crippled the postal service into oblivion by 11/3. I  hope not to get harassed by right wing goon squads at precincts.  I hope Biden is doing all he can to reach out to all who he needs to reach.

I've no doubt there are racially insensitive videos of Biden.  He's been in government since the 70's.  Do you have any racially insensitive videos of Biden in the last 20 years; since the millennium?  We've all learned, grown and changed in the intervening decades.
Yeah really. No offense to Joe Biden, but PRESIDENT Obama would be leading by 15+ % points right now. The election would be over for sure.

That time when a Joe Biden showed he studied up on authoritarianism, unlike others that might be caught unaware.
Total BS reasoning.  Harris is ambitious, as are almost all politicians that have reached that level of success.  Biden likely a 1-term president.  She'd be a great pick.
Kamala Harris is a badass and we wld be lucky to have her as VP. This year more than any other it's important to have someone who cld step into the role of president at a moment's notice and she is eminently capable. These "allies" shld be ashamed and I hope Biden ignores them.
#NobodyLikesTrump Just a joke of a frail, sniveling loser. Vote Biden 2020 &amp; let’s make this country BETTER!!
In Biden’s basement.
The girl is literally guiding Biden, hanging on to him! Can you imagine if that was Trump?!?!
Don't care if it's Biden +99, as long as people are voting in person during a pandemic the polls mean nothing.  If Dems are over confident it will be 2016 all over again.
Thanks for voting. My guess is Harris for veep or attorney general; Warren for senate majority leader; Rice, SOS. Some of the others will be judicial nominees or cabinet ministers. Eg mayor Pete cut a deal to endorse Biden at exactly right time. But for what - cabinet post(?).
It’s Joe Biden under that mask.  “You ain’t black if you don’t vote for me”.
You forget, whether it’s true or not, he does whatever he wants...until his regime gets voted out. Vote Biden.
Trump abruptly ends briefing after being pressed over retweeting misinformation                                        The guy (trump) is an idiot   Please VOTE BIDEN   Spare our country from being flushed
Wow. Does that mean you are voting for that man in the White House?  Wish I could have threatened my vote all of those years my voting selections lost. I’m guessing Warren would want you to vote Biden. Good luck.
They are all a pile of bricks short of a full load and Biden is missing the entire load
Does anyone wonder why republicans are harping Joe's age and cognitive abilities while Joe is saying he is going to choose a female VP?? That looks like they want momen to vote Biden just in case something happens to him.
Yeah he does...Archie and Jughead
If Biden should be elected he would be a place holder president.  Bernie, AOC, Squad, Pelosi &amp; other far left progressives would run the country.  No one believes Biden is capable of being the leader of the free world.  Big trouble for us if he is elected.
Biden will only get worse. Anyone who votes for him irrationally hates Trump more than they care about the future of us &amp; our country.  Bernie will be pulling Biden’s strings - he already is.
I’m sure Biden is being given something for his memory. He knows questions in advance, notes/script in front of him. Talks incredibly slow &amp; wanders off topic. He couldn’t debate me.
Colorado for Biden and WE are going to vote out Senator Cory Gardner out too!
Not going to happen. He’s got nothing to lose and he is going to get worse. I always thought this was why the United States of America has checks and balance. Why isn’t it working?  Vote Biden!
I understand why they don’t want Biden to be questioned with even the most simple, no follow-up questions &amp; his hometown press.
That's my game plan. Vote for Biden (as much as I hate it) and GOP the rest of the ballot.

I don't think Joe Biden ought to debate Donald Trump until Trump's tax returns are released.   The left?  Who is the left?
I find participating in local politics very rewarding.  I will say Biden was pushed further left by Warren, Bernie and their supporters. You might not get your personal pick, but you will be getting a more progressive candidate because of all the people that raised their voices.

Why should she feel remorse? It was a criticism Biden should have been prepared for, delivered masterfully, in a contest for who should lead United States. She has nothing to feel bad about. Biden doesn't need a yes-woman, he needs someone unafraid to tell him when he's wrong.
Listening to this makes me wonder if you could make an argument that Joe Biden is the most conservative candidate in the race.

Hey Trump.  Joe Biden was born in Pennsylvania.  I’ll bet they like him lots better than you.   Especially in town, where they remember your lies about building new steel markets.
I agree. The Biden campaign should have been *asking* to have Wallace interview him after Trump and Gingrich made it sound like he wasn't up to it.
Biden is NOT a moderate &amp; has no chance of becoming president.

Biden has never and will never be asked anything but softball questions.  It continues to amaze me the difference in the way the media treats democrats vs Republicans.  We need a fair press, real journalists, not political activists. They have become a joke.
Americans will never elect Joe Biden.  Everything is against Trump but he will prevail.  We do not want anarchists destroying cities. We don’t want Socialism.  We’ve had Obama &amp; don’t want him again, or Bernie, AOC, or Warren. We’re sick of the deep state.

Ask organizers. I hear all the time- “There’s no way Trump wins. I’m not wasting my time volunteering for Biden.”  And yes, I die a little bit inside every time I have to plead for someone to “Remember 2016.”
Look at what Trump says, when reading them start with Things Biden would never do or say, insert every time Trumps name is mentioned. That helps tell the story with  the best view.
Remember when Joe Biden threw a huge fit because a city wouldn’t let him have his convention the way he wanted it....then moved it. Oh no....WAIT that was  and now he still can’t have it how he wants it because he’s let #COVID19 get out of control.

Biden’s wife could end this nightmare if she put Joe’s well-being above her ambition. Biden has made enough off the taxpayers the last 40 yrs so it’s time to hang it up.
Biden hallucinates. Does that worry anyone?
Mueller was used just as Biden is.  Both obviously senile and being manipulated and held up by their handlers.
Biden is largely adopting Inslee's climate plan. He has Bernie people on his policy teams for education and health care. He's behind the times on weed but he won't stop states from legalizing it and won't prosecute it federally. Those are all major steps in the right direction.
But since it's happening right now, it is LITERALLY Trump's America  I think it's hilarious that the GOP is highlighting  Trump's many and most egregious failures in an effort to discredit Biden. At this point, Biden doesn't even need a campaign, you're doing it for him
going to try? Bernie is literally working with Biden on policy. But you don't accomplish ANYTHING if you constantly make enemies of the people you need in order to actually make progress. Kind of like Bernie Bros making enemies of the people they needed to vote for Bernie in the
I also think, unfortunately, that this whole "security message" will resonate with some of the "John Kasich voters" that Biden thinks he can reach. Expect the polls to tighten the next week or so... until trump inevitably implodes again.Joe Biden is not for universal income.

That's why Warren should be Biden's Veep choice.  She'd mop the floor with Pence and never need to raise her voice.
Karen Bass would be a disaster. With her on the ticket, Trump might be able to play his hail mary ‘law and order’ campaign just right enough to squeak through another win. It would be the dumbest thing Biden could do.
I'd vote for a big yellow dog over Trump for POTUS. VP? Who cares?  Conversation about it is just bull session fodder. If Spanky can make news with BS, so can Biden.
Harris calling out Biden during the debates is an argument FOR her to be the Veep … not against.  You need diversity of thought.  And you really need someone who understands what it is like to be both Black and a Woman!!

This is the most important hiring decision he will have to make.  Her qualifications will include strengths and experiences that complement his own.  Biden will work with this person daily, so there must be trust and connection.  He will choose wisely on our behalf.
I was at JLA, the 1980 convention, (volunteer concessions) when Reagan chose Bush.
I know Biden is a few years older than Trump but he is much better health. If Trump can make it through a term, Biden can too. So maybe lets not worry about who the VP pick is that much.

I think of Biden as being...not necessarily chaotic, but not predictable enough to keep up with paladin requirements. Maybe a tanky cleric?
I'm not a Kamala fan and think Warren, Demmings, or Castro would be the better picks but I almost want Biden to pick Harris and put all his old buddies out to pasture just to make a point.   I'm sure he won't, but I'd like to see it.

New campaign tack: “JOE BIDEN WILL LEAVE AMERICA DANGEROUSLY UNPREPARED FOR A PANDEMIC“
that's in the epstein case, the case where a girl was pressing charges was dropped, no evidence, no record to corroborate the claims, just claims.
again she was legally, and materially a woman. case closed.
Sternis the one saying she's hot, Trump's response is "you have to like freckles though"

He said it last time and they showed up. We must vote for Biden.
Trump is mentioned by interviewer, witness denies ever seeing trump, and on page two which you didn't post clarifies that the only reason she thought they were friends is because epstein claimed they were.
Trump was mentioned by the interviewer, which the witness denies, read it again
proof of death threats? proof of incident? oh there is none, i've already looked at it, sorry but none of that proves anything, you're just jumping to conclusions that support your spoonfed orange man bad narrative
the only evidence they had any kind of friendship was from Epstein's mouth. Where's the proof he went to the island? Not in the unsealed documents, in fact they suggest the opposite according to an interview with one victim. You can only bring down someone with proof.
he didn't bring her up, listen again. the other guy brought her up, saying she was hot and all this, Trump sounds like he's uncomfortably trying to change subject.
I’m a progressive but Bernie Sanders people make progressives look bad. They honestly embarrass me ...

decreases in  taxation and regulation freeing up incentivising funds for business.
Biden is a Democrat. If you don't like the job he does, you can vote him out in 4 years. Trump is neither a Dem. nor a Rep. If he wins, there will not be a second chance. The gates of Auschwitz and the swatiska exploding at Nuremberg.
Obama's increases in taxation, and regulation crashed the economy, because that shit stifles small business, and restricts the flow of funds in the market. Happens every time a dem is elected. Only when Trump announced he was running to decrease taxes, and cut regs did it upturn.
Turn off the TV, Trump made his fortune contracting construction of suburbs, the man spawned entire industries, no on one off side projects the left keeps highlighting. Business has a luck factor, trump nets waay into the positive, and the proof is in his bank acct.
Trump is speculating about a Tilden/Hayes type election. But it won't be close. Biden will have +330 EC votes.

Duncan Hunter, not Hunter Biden. Two different people.
you guys are stretching making this about Trump, totally ignoring others who were proven involved. why are you ignoring proof for speculation, because your TV told you to? the same industry that has an employee get arrested for sex crimes every other week?
Enough already! We have to vote for Biden. So his VP is really inconsequential if you wanna keep America a democracy. Irony? Maybe. I prefer Kamala, but in the end, I prefer the slew of legislation to right America that we WON’T GET if we keep bitching about something/anything
They don't because they were dropped with no evidence. and proof he went to the island? The flight logs state he had a few hour connecting flight on one of his planes once on a business trip, no record of minors there either. No where do i see where he made a trip to the island.
For bad people, no. For the rest of us that work hard, and love our families, yes.
Newest polls show Biden leading by 8pts. I truly don’t get it.  Biden clearly is struggling cognitively.  How can he lead against China &amp; Russia or make strong economic decisions? Why would anyone vote for him? #2020Election
i'm supposed to feel sorry for a business who's whole model is scamming people out of money with statistics? as for what he did, his policies got my brother in law an awesome paying job, with bigger wages, got us into a nicer house, got me a raise, rounding up sex traffickers etc
He started this w/ bringing up Abram's name from the get-go, followed by all you listed. It's one Biden item that has disappointed me - AND, I'm voting for Biden and SCOTUS.
Legally she was past the threshold, and listening to this, he was steering the conversation away from her. Sounds like you want to increase age of consent, which I might agree with if you increase voting age along with it.
I don’t see an end in sight. Even if 45 loses this election (swear to God y’all better vote him out), how long will it be before Biden can even change anything?
And, if their desired candidate isn't chosen, what? They won't vote for Biden and SCOTUS?
"Uhhhh  du ud durrr, yu no liek kintens? yu dummy hurr"
No, in the epstein case there are rooms filled with evidence that condemn these guys, except Trump who has been exonerated by witness testimony. It the case against them there was 0 evidence, and charges were dropped.
Indeed. I think all hell will break loose no matter who he chooses. Biden should never have started this ridiculous public 🐎 race.
i condemn those who abused children in clear violation of age of consent, Trump didn't, witness testimony exonerates him.
not according to the law.
just in time for the 2016 election, with no proof, and charges dropped entirely. we have receipts for the other guys you're ignoring to try to make this about Trump. Next.
blind speculation has no value in a battle for truth.
Hick and Bullock never caught on because the voter who wanted a moderate white man decided to stick with Biden. If either had caught on, they would have loved it. And if someone like Harris is running, they're going to step in as moderate white man options again.
There have been thousands of protests. A couple violent acts. Biden condemned the violent protests, including in a statement this week.
I don't "trust" anything, trust is for fools. I voted for him because of his background in business, and making difficult deals, He's a businessman, and that is reflected in the current state of the economy, in spite of covid. The left was saying the economy would never recover
No matter who he chooses, I'm voting for Biden and SCOTUS - just sayin'.
The only ones drawing lines around race are the left.
Despite my numerous phone notifications, I am skeptical of the claim that speculation regarding Biden's VP pick is breaking news worthy of an interruption into my day. If we know who, then sure, that's major news. But theories and speculation - how is that news?
The only thing that matters is who will motivate voters and help Biden win. And the 'playing women off against each other' are sexist and gross.
Florida starts counting mail in ballots early. As do some other states. They actually get counted in FL before ED voting. Biden wins Florida, everything else is moot.

during your debates with trump i need you to say "I've been "Biden" my time!" please do it
Biden supporters like donuts and cops like donuts so Biden supporters is a cop!
I'm voting for Joe Biden in November. I like the Blue Angels and the Thunderbirds and I love the smell of burning jet fuel and afterburner noise.
Can't tell you how many times I've stayed awake at night worrying about what good ol Ed Rendell was thinking. 🙄
"Twitter suffered a major security breach on 15 July that saw hackers take control of the accounts of major public figures and corporations, including Joe Biden, Barack Obama, Elon Musk, Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos and Apple."
Biden was like the squarest Democratic Party candidate in 2008. Like, square man. Not far-out, man.
Generally agree, but I think it matters in this case. Biden has basically said he will be a one-term President and it's not certain he can even fulfill four years. Throw in the BLM movement and the pandemic, which has limited anything Biden has done/said publicly, and it matters.
honestly will not be surprised if Biden’s VP pick is Željko Buvač it’s been that kind of wild year
Trump is going to try and paint Biden supporters as hippies, yippies and anarchists.
Anarchists don't like Democrats let alone Biden. Maybe there's a few out there like a "pragmatic anarchist." Otherwise, anarchists and general hooligans aren't into Biden. Maybe Bernie Sanders or Ron Paul.
Many old African-American Biden supporters go to church every Sunday. Especially in the south. The Sunday go-to-meeting old church ladies in fact.
I'm a Biden supporters and I sit around the house minding my own business and don't even play loud music. I think the rioters, looters and arsonists when they occur are assholes. I don't like cancel culture and I'm into old school country music now.
That is not in any way to diminish the credentials of Karen Bass ... but what does that do for you for an election? It doesn't provide a younger fallback option if Biden cannot complete a term, it doesn't help you win a competitive state(s), and it doesn't have any national buzz.
Biden supporters don't riot or set fire to building. They live quiet lives and shop at Trader Joe's, REI, and Home Depot and do a lot of gardening, home improvement projects, take their dogs for a walk and pet their cats.
People are losing it over the prospects of Biden's VP pick.
I hope this is true. But also plenty of casual voters who are planning to vote Biden and aren't on Twitter are likely planning to drop their ballot in the mail at the deadline. (See: taxes)
Thanks to the predictable idiocy of Ed Rendell and Chris Dodd, the Biden team is going to have one helluva time explaining why they didn't pick Senator Harris if they don't pick Senator Harris.
"2020 Election Live Updates: Trump Administration Continues Attacks on Mail-In Voting" by Unknown Author via NYT
you can feel that way, but it's still not illegal. I don't really care how he "thinks and feel about women" because i'm not a subjective person, my feelings are not my master. I want him to represent this country because he can twist arms and get shit done, and does.
🤣🤣🤣 wow. But when he's talking about crime bills and "predators" he has no issue talking normally. You're just as delusional as Biden.
her only notion of a connection is because "jeffery told [her ]" Jeffry also told a reporter he was connected to Elon Musk which was a total fabrication.
The phrase "not that i can remember" is to shield her from legal perjury. if she said "no" plainly, and it turned out he visited, and it came out later, she could be legally liable. so what we have here is limited to what she's seen, and can remember, being high traffic.
you can read right, the people were fishing for something on Trump, but she made clear he was never on the island, corroborating the flight logs. The crime here isn't knowing epstein, it's sexual abuse of little kids, of which Trump is clearly vindicated.
not even close to a smoking gun, rich people go to expensive parties, it's common knowledge, i would be more surprised if they hadn't been in photos together, further the accusation is whether or not he touched these girls, and he didn't.
Most Americans DGAF what they accept or not, we had Trump for four years - New Yahoo News/YouGov poll: Most Trump voters say they will not accept the 2020 results if Biden wins because of mail-in ballots
keep in mind this a legal adult were are talking about here, a fully developed woman, not a child.
This is nothing compared to epstein and the clintons, Trump was vindicated, and at the end of the day, he might say some crass things, but he didn't break the law.
Biden will make the best decision
Let's go.  Time to stop this once and for all.  Any person who votes for Biden to appease these a$$#0!3$ is an idiot.
Biden is a joke.
I know Biden will make the right decision. What do you think?

America has nothing to do with communism. Socialism is NOT communism. Dems are NOT communists. Biden is not even on the left of the spectrum. Keep spreading your propaganda but it won’t work on educated people.
I'm not scared, he's lost his element of surprise and shock that he enjoyed in 2016.  We're onto him, and more importantly, so are the dems and the Biden campaign.
“Biden may take up to August 10th” !!!!
Oh no, poor man. He seems to have caught what Biden’s got.
How many consecutive mos did the Obama/Biden admin have positive job growth? How many years did the economy grow under their admin? Since we’re now down 30m jobs (including mine) &amp; only trending worse, &amp; we just posted the worst economic quarter in history, you should shut up.

Biden will have a higher body count than Trump. Bowing to the desires of billionaires and corporations doesn’t make you brave, fascist enabler.
Hickenlooper might be a poor Senate candidate, but at least the Senate PAC runs terrible ads for him.  Yikes.  And this coming after a poll found him lagging Biden's #s by quite a bit.
Nancy Pelosi just endorsed Rashida Tlaib in her primary on the same day that Rashida Tlaib refused to endorse Joe Biden, the Democratic nominee for President of the United States.

I like you posted your centrist creds😂 Fellow centrists who agrees with you on Biden. I remember the last few years of Regan’s presidency after he mentally checked out. It was a mess and that’s putting it mildly.
What exactly is Trump’s “good American policy?”  He rode the wave of good economic recovery Biden and Obama created. And now that Trump has to make decisions and lead, OUR 👏🏻 ECONOMY 👏🏻 IS 👏🏻 IN 👏🏻 RUINS!!  #TrumpFailsAmerica

I think the first challenge for Joe Biden, If he wins, will be remembering what day it is.
I wanted to hear if Joe could give eulogy. Where is Joe Biden?
You really think trump or Biden can fix this?
Biden having a stroke
Running on the soul basis of “conservative good/ liberal evil” and “I hate joe Biden” doesn’t make you a good political candidate, It makes you a fear monger. What are your stances on issues, except for on 2nd amendment we all know that one.
"Make due" biden wants to arrest me for my thoughts. I'm going to pass on that fascist thanks.
Hate to be the bearer of bad news but Biden won’t be sympathetic to any attempt to disrupt the status quo. He will just be a friendly face on the same old bullshit.
We could do with less exciting and more maturity.  Biden is our next president.
Don't most states, except for around 8, have at-will employment? It's fantastic that you want more rights for employees! Joe Biden appreciates your vote.
Oh it’ll be longer than that, in either case. Must flip the senate too. My newest nightmare is a Biden victory paired with a republican senate hell bent on making sure the recovery doesn’t happen so they can elect someone else in ‘24.
lol umm, like targeting his political enemies? That fairness? Muller didn't even know what was in his own report! It's like Biden if he wins.
How much is in the pockets of a Biden.
Does he say it’s rigged if he somehow wins?! We have seen act, it’s boring. What’s different this time is how he’s throwing in the towel himself and keeps bringing up that he’s going to lose. LOVE seeing the fear in his eyes.
DT’s sinking at the polls. Sane supporters doubt his ability. He has divided us, cost us many lives, our economy &amp; our Allies. We cannot sit back &amp; “know” he will lose. We must gently embrace Repubs who doubt him. Biden must choose a strong VP. And we must vote as never before.
The original premise was no election, in which no house members would be elected. I absolutely agree that the election will happen. If red states start opting out, then it will just go to Biden who will get a vast majority of however much of the electoral college actually votes.

Biden’s campaign consists of trump making a jackass of himself on a minutely basis. The fewest minutes Joe is in the spotlight the better.
I think they dropped out because they saw they couldn't steal the moderate label from Biden and didn't want Sanders to be the nominee. I don't think a puppetmaster pulled their strings.
I think #SusanRice is the better choice. They have a working history together. She can navigate division intelligently and unify with diplomacy here and abroad. Most importantly, Biden trusts Rice. Our allies do too. She is ready to step in if needed.
I heard the My Pillow guy is making a mattress resembling the sprawl of the Crucifixion, so people don't forget.  Your arms fit right into the slots.  Unless you get the Biden version.  Arm slots like wagon wheels.  It's called 'the good riddance'
There's hundreds of Joe Biden creepy photos even video of him touching girls sniffing girls
Biden’s campaign, just as Hilary’s was, is a sham from a corrupt DNC that has drown out Bernie twice now. Only a slight bump in the road in the timeframe needed to establish a more progressive nation.
My theory is they keep Trump because they find Obama to valuable and he'll be pretty exposed if Biden gets back in as the riots continue
If Biden’s a liberal, then my name is Greg. #BernieScrewedAgain
I think trump is absolute shit but he has a cult following with no real competition on the republican side and a majority of the left doesn’t really feel much for Biden as to his allegations actions and such if only the dems found a better candidate shitty

Biden has run for president three different times, so I think we can assume he's ambitious as well!
You don't think President Biden will pardon him? 😂
True! Though it might depend on Biden's class.   Obama is likely an INT or CHA based caster, so I'm assuming Biden is probably melee?
Biden does not utter racial slurs.
This is right on - failure of imagination. She was gambling for a mandate against a GOP congress and couldn't conceive of enough 'deplorables' to give EC to Trump.  Biden will be fine if he balances sincere effort to appeal to all w/ practical focus to assure EC win.
Save it from the catastrophic state Trump is responsible for putting the USA in?  Vote for Joe Biden!!!
And organizing just like we are now. How many days into a Biden presidency before fed troops mace citizens?
Yes.  For Biden
no, see, if we all just vote then biden will have a chance to fix all of this by, like, next march. That's soon enough, right? *checks notes* oh. oh nooo
It’s not Biden’s tweets that worry me.
Elections are run by states though. I thought  was all about states rights. Imagine red states delaying, blue states voting and putting Biden over the top.
I can’t bring myself to vote for Biden. He’ll be a puppet of the left and appoint crazy SCOTUS. #Trump2020
Why would Q (or “the cabal” as you’re saying) expose Hillary, Epstein, Weinstein, Hollywood, pedos, Obama, Biden, Comey, Clapper, Brennan, etc???  And NOT Trump (since he’s taking them all down)  And why aren’t any of them exposing Q as fake since Q is outing them ALL???  🤷‍♂️🤔

And he was roundly criticized as a promoting a conspiracy and being a nutcase.  We all knew Biden was right. Of course Trump is going to try to void an election he is sure to lose unless the Russians step in and help him and the GOP ratfucks voter registration and voting places.
Protestors not a political ideology like biden did.
Biden listens to scientists on when it will be safe to send the kids to school. Biden doesn’t sniff Lysol and take magic pills to make his decision.
you are so right young lady. Biden forgets where he is half the time. We’re screwed either way
Serious question. Do you think if he loses Nov. 3 he will stay in office until the inauguration? Or will he cut out early?  Regardless, do you think he would go to the inauguration of Joe Biden?
Kamala's record as prosecutor and state AG and her senate record including voting against a 10% military cut a few days ago are FAR more of a problem than her attack on Biden
Has he yet named a Democrat that he’s asked if they were a paid flunky for the Democrat party or for Joe Biden? We’ll wait. ⏱🤔😮🤭🥱😴

Dear Congressman John Lewis,  You make me want to be a better person and a better American.  I wish you could have lived long enough to witness Joe Biden inaugurated as our next President.  We are all going to get this right.  Rest In Peace.
Biden is clearly in no shape physically or mentally to run. I can’t believe people are content with him as a puppet, I mean candidate.
Well I'm not convinced that Biden wins the election anyway, so I wouldn't be satisfied with a simple loss with a Biden Harris ticket. I'd need to see him win with a different VP pick too.
No. All the moms I know will crawl over glass to vote for Joe Biden. The moms I know stood in line for hours to vote for him in the primary. Kimberly...you are a smart gal(sketchy choice w/ Jr🙄) it is over for DJT. Way too late for over 150,000 families who have lost loved ones.

Once trump finds out that Biden VP is going to be a black women. Is trump going to have Pence do blackface with a dress on?
That's why Warren should be Biden's Veep choice.  She'd mop the floor with Pence and never need to raise her voice.
Karen Bass would be a disaster. With her on the ticket, Trump might be able to play his hail mary ‘law and order’ campaign just right enough to squeak through another win. It would be the dumbest thing Biden could do.
I'd vote for a big yellow dog over Trump for POTUS. VP? Who cares?  Conversation about it is just bull session fodder. If Spanky can make news with BS, so can Biden.
Harris calling out Biden during the debates is an argument FOR her to be the Veep … not against.  You need diversity of thought.  And you really need someone who understands what it is like to be both Black and a Woman!!

I know Biden is a few years older than Trump but he is much better health. If Trump can make it through a term, Biden can too. So maybe lets not worry about who the VP pick is that much.

I think of Biden as being...not necessarily chaotic, but not predictable enough to keep up with paladin requirements. Maybe a tanky cleric?
I'm not a Kamala fan and think Warren, Demmings, or Castro would be the better picks but I almost want Biden to pick Harris and put all his old buddies out to pasture just to make a point.   I'm sure he won't, but I'd like to see it.

that's in the epstein case, the case where a girl was pressing charges was dropped, no evidence, no record to corroborate the claims, just claims.

He said it last time and they showed up. We must vote for Biden.
Trump is mentioned by interviewer, witness denies ever seeing trump, and on page two which you didn't post clarifies that the only reason she thought they were friends is because epstein claimed they were.
Trump was mentioned by the interviewer, which the witness denies, read it again
proof of death threats? proof of incident? oh there is none, i've already looked at it, sorry but none of that proves anything, you're just jumping to conclusions that support your spoonfed orange man bad narrative
the only evidence they had any kind of friendship was from Epstein's mouth. Where's the proof he went to the island? Not in the unsealed documents, in fact they suggest the opposite according to an interview with one victim. You can only bring down someone with proof.
he didn't bring her up, listen again. the other guy brought her up, saying she was hot and all this, Trump sounds like he's uncomfortably trying to change subject.
I’m a progressive but Bernie Sanders people make progressives look bad. They honestly embarrass me ...

Respect is earned not given, and besides that love is a truer virtue than respect which is transient and impersonal. I refuse to elect someone to manage a system on subjective grounds that is stupid, You would do that looking for a wife or a babysitter, not a president.
Overdramatic, Trump was the first to even desire to take action against CV, while Trump was imposing travel bans to infected areas, nancy was promoting trips to chinatown.
decreases in  taxation and regulation freeing up incentivising funds for business.
Biden is a Democrat. If you don't like the job he does, you can vote him out in 4 years. Trump is neither a Dem. nor a Rep. If he wins, there will not be a second chance. The gates of Auschwitz and the swatiska exploding at Nuremberg.
Obama's increases in taxation, and regulation crashed the economy, because that shit stifles small business, and restricts the flow of funds in the market. Happens every time a dem is elected. Only when Trump announced he was running to decrease taxes, and cut regs did it upturn.
Turn off the TV, Trump made his fortune contracting construction of suburbs, the man spawned entire industries, no on one off side projects the left keeps highlighting. Business has a luck factor, trump nets waay into the positive, and the proof is in his bank acct.
Trump is speculating about a Tilden/Hayes type election. But it won't be close. Biden will have +330 EC votes.
cw uspol  God I really hope his criminality catches up with him
Duncan Hunter, not Hunter Biden. Two different people.
you guys are stretching making this about Trump, totally ignoring others who were proven involved. why are you ignoring proof for speculation, because your TV told you to? the same industry that has an employee get arrested for sex crimes every other week?
Enough already! We have to vote for Biden. So his VP is really inconsequential if you wanna keep America a democracy. Irony? Maybe. I prefer Kamala, but in the end, I prefer the slew of legislation to right America that we WON’T GET if we keep bitching about something/anything
They don't because they were dropped with no evidence. and proof he went to the island? The flight logs state he had a few hour connecting flight on one of his planes once on a business trip, no record of minors there either. No where do i see where he made a trip to the island.
For bad people, no. For the rest of us that work hard, and love our families, yes.
Newest polls show Biden leading by 8pts. I truly don’t get it.  Biden clearly is struggling cognitively.  How can he lead against China &amp; Russia or make strong economic decisions? Why would anyone vote for him? #2020Election
i'm supposed to feel sorry for a business who's whole model is scamming people out of money with statistics? as for what he did, his policies got my brother in law an awesome paying job, with bigger wages, got us into a nicer house, got me a raise, rounding up sex traffickers etc
He started this w/ bringing up Abram's name from the get-go, followed by all you listed. It's one Biden item that has disappointed me - AND, I'm voting for Biden and SCOTUS.
Legally she was past the threshold, and listening to this, he was steering the conversation away from her. Sounds like you want to increase age of consent, which I might agree with if you increase voting age along with it.
I don’t see an end in sight. Even if 45 loses this election (swear to God y’all better vote him out), how long will it be before Biden can even change anything?
And, if their desired candidate isn't chosen, what? They won't vote for Biden and SCOTUS?
"Uhhhh  du ud durrr, yu no liek kintens? yu dummy hurr"
No, in the epstein case there are rooms filled with evidence that condemn these guys, except Trump who has been exonerated by witness testimony. It the case against them there was 0 evidence, and charges were dropped.
Indeed. I think all hell will break loose no matter who he chooses. Biden should never have started this ridiculous public 🐎 race.
i condemn those who abused children in clear violation of age of consent, Trump didn't, witness testimony exonerates him.
not according to the law.
just in time for the 2016 election, with no proof, and charges dropped entirely. we have receipts for the other guys you're ignoring to try to make this about Trump. Next.
blind speculation has no value in a battle for truth.
Hick and Bullock never caught on because the voter who wanted a moderate white man decided to stick with Biden. If either had caught on, they would have loved it. And if someone like Harris is running, they're going to step in as moderate white man options again.
There have been thousands of protests. A couple violent acts. Biden condemned the violent protests, including in a statement this week.
I don't "trust" anything, trust is for fools. I voted for him because of his background in business, and making difficult deals, He's a businessman, and that is reflected in the current state of the economy, in spite of covid. The left was saying the economy would never recover
No matter who he chooses, I'm voting for Biden and SCOTUS - just sayin'.
The only ones drawing lines around race are the left.
Despite my numerous phone notifications, I am skeptical of the claim that speculation regarding Biden's VP pick is breaking news worthy of an interruption into my day. If we know who, then sure, that's major news. But theories and speculation - how is that news?
The only thing that matters is who will motivate voters and help Biden win. And the 'playing women off against each other' are sexist and gross.
Florida starts counting mail in ballots early. As do some other states. They actually get counted in FL before ED voting. Biden wins Florida, everything else is moot.
I'm not going to bother to convince a bunch of anti-social posers on here to vote for Biden.
during your debates with trump i need you to say "I've been "Biden" my time!" please do it
Biden supporters like donuts and cops like donuts so Biden supporters is a cop!
I'm voting for Joe Biden in November. I like the Blue Angels and the Thunderbirds and I love the smell of burning jet fuel and afterburner noise.
Can't tell you how many times I've stayed awake at night worrying about what good ol Ed Rendell was thinking. 🙄
"Twitter suffered a major security breach on 15 July that saw hackers take control of the accounts of major public figures and corporations, including Joe Biden, Barack Obama, Elon Musk, Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos and Apple."
Biden was like the squarest Democratic Party candidate in 2008. Like, square man. Not far-out, man.
Generally agree, but I think it matters in this case. Biden has basically said he will be a one-term President and it's not certain he can even fulfill four years. Throw in the BLM movement and the pandemic, which has limited anything Biden has done/said publicly, and it matters.
honestly will not be surprised if Biden’s VP pick is Željko Buvač it’s been that kind of wild year
Trump is going to try and paint Biden supporters as hippies, yippies and anarchists.
Anarchists don't like Democrats let alone Biden. Maybe there's a few out there like a "pragmatic anarchist." Otherwise, anarchists and general hooligans aren't into Biden. Maybe Bernie Sanders or Ron Paul.
Many old African-American Biden supporters go to church every Sunday. Especially in the south. The Sunday go-to-meeting old church ladies in fact.
I'm a Biden supporters and I sit around the house minding my own business and don't even play loud music. I think the rioters, looters and arsonists when they occur are assholes. I don't like cancel culture and I'm into old school country music now.
That is not in any way to diminish the credentials of Karen Bass ... but what does that do for you for an election? It doesn't provide a younger fallback option if Biden cannot complete a term, it doesn't help you win a competitive state(s), and it doesn't have any national buzz.
Biden supporters don't riot or set fire to building. They live quiet lives and shop at Trader Joe's, REI, and Home Depot and do a lot of gardening, home improvement projects, take their dogs for a walk and pet their cats.
People are losing it over the prospects of Biden's VP pick.
I hope this is true. But also plenty of casual voters who are planning to vote Biden and aren't on Twitter are likely planning to drop their ballot in the mail at the deadline. (See: taxes)
Thanks to the predictable idiocy of Ed Rendell and Chris Dodd, the Biden team is going to have one helluva time explaining why they didn't pick Senator Harris if they don't pick Senator Harris.
"2020 Election Live Updates: Trump Administration Continues Attacks on Mail-In Voting" by Unknown Author via NYT
you can feel that way, but it's still not illegal. I don't really care how he "thinks and feel about women" because i'm not a subjective person, my feelings are not my master. I want him to represent this country because he can twist arms and get shit done, and does.
🤣🤣🤣 wow. But when he's talking about crime bills and "predators" he has no issue talking normally. You're just as delusional as Biden.
her only notion of a connection is because "jeffery told [her ]" Jeffry also told a reporter he was connected to Elon Musk which was a total fabrication.
The phrase "not that i can remember" is to shield her from legal perjury. if she said "no" plainly, and it turned out he visited, and it came out later, she could be legally liable. so what we have here is limited to what she's seen, and can remember, being high traffic.
you can read right, the people were fishing for something on Trump, but she made clear he was never on the island, corroborating the flight logs. The crime here isn't knowing epstein, it's sexual abuse of little kids, of which Trump is clearly vindicated.
not even close to a smoking gun, rich people go to expensive parties, it's common knowledge, i would be more surprised if they hadn't been in photos together, further the accusation is whether or not he touched these girls, and he didn't.
Most Americans DGAF what they accept or not, we had Trump for four years - New Yahoo News/YouGov poll: Most Trump voters say they will not accept the 2020 results if Biden wins because of mail-in ballots
keep in mind this a legal adult were are talking about here, a fully developed woman, not a child.
This is nothing compared to epstein and the clintons, Trump was vindicated, and at the end of the day, he might say some crass things, but he didn't break the law.
Biden will make the best decision
Let's go.  Time to stop this once and for all.  Any person who votes for Biden to appease these a$$#0!3$ is an idiot.
Biden is a joke.
I know Biden will make the right decision. What do you think?
Pompeo hit with subpoena after he’s caught assisting Senate GOP’s political smear of Biden -
Them and the Lincoln Project. Come Nov. 4, they’ll be attacking Biden before he’s even sworn in.
America has nothing to do with communism. Socialism is NOT communism. Dems are NOT communists. Biden is not even on the left of the spectrum. Keep spreading your propaganda but it won’t work on educated people.
I'm not scared, he's lost his element of surprise and shock that he enjoyed in 2016.  We're onto him, and more importantly, so are the dems and the Biden campaign.
“Biden may take up to August 10th” !!!!
Oh no, poor man. He seems to have caught what Biden’s got.
How many consecutive mos did the Obama/Biden admin have positive job growth? How many years did the economy grow under their admin? Since we’re now down 30m jobs (including mine) &amp; only trending worse, &amp; we just posted the worst economic quarter in history, you should shut up.
It’s going to be a landslide—say hello to President Biden!! #2020Election  #NovemberIsComing #NobodyLikesTrump
Biden will have a higher body count than Trump. Bowing to the desires of billionaires and corporations doesn’t make you brave, fascist enabler.
Hickenlooper might be a poor Senate candidate, but at least the Senate PAC runs terrible ads for him.  Yikes.  And this coming after a poll found him lagging Biden's #s by quite a bit.
Nancy Pelosi just endorsed Rashida Tlaib in her primary on the same day that Rashida Tlaib refused to endorse Joe Biden, the Democratic nominee for President of the United States.Well that is a problem! Will have a problem voting for Biden if she is his BP choice.
Why did you tell us that you don't support Biden. Are you wanting to tell everyone I support Trump? Or is it in response to something I missed? Just wondering.
To all that are likely to vote Democrat in November. Please. Please let's agree right now to not bicker about Biden's choice for VP. The decision will have been made with input from many sides. Please. Don't attack and divide. #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica
Yes we need Joe Biden.
Liberals: third party vote is a vote for Trump.  Conservatives: third part vote is a vote for Biden.  Me: Yeah, who’s the sheeple? These people.
The bafoon (Trump) has already been listed in documents so your Playboy comments should go to the crapper. He would bone his own daughter if he could. The way he looks at and touches her is Joe Biden creepy.
Trump will beat Biden by at least 100 electoral votes and most likely more. Biden will lose by a much wider margin than Hillary did.
You've got a much better chance at curing Covid-19 by Nov 3rd than winning another term on Nov 3rd! Don't worry though! President Biden will have it completely under control by the time you figure out that magic demons are not controlling your lungs. Whew!
Dreams are GOOD to have. Some might say GREAT, but so is mental health,&amp; you've got some work to do. You wont win,&amp; you know it! You'll try some slimy cheat, blame Dems but it won't work, &amp; you'll be indicted &amp; convicted. Maybe be nicer to President Biden.(cough,cough pardon?)
This didn’t age very well
Let’s get Biden back in the White House!
Yea, your lack of spelling indicts you probably don’t read. Which probably means you can’t comprehend anything past twitter.   Good luck in life! Biden 2020.
The media never laid a hand on Hunter Biden, didn’t meet their criteria for investigation
I know, with all his “scandal”, Hunter Biden will never be elected President.
oh jesus, itll probably be something like biden+25
If you don’t vote for Biden you ain’t black
A bipartisan group secretly gathered to game out a contested Trump-Biden election. It wasn’t pretty - The Boston Globe.   This is a sobering read. #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica2020
Not thrilled about Biden, but if it gets the Cheeto in Chief out of office, I have no choice. I hate this
Biden is a real leader.  You, on the other hand...
The VP candidates are almost as exciting as Biden. It's going to be an historic defeat.
I knew it was Biden-Harris last summer (2019). The fact the fix was in long ago doesn’t even bother a 20-year Green Party member. Competency is the low bar.
I am with you on this but what is the alternative?  A question you must answer to yourself.   I don't want to vote Biden either but we need to stop getting comfortable,  we need to be uncomfortable being comfortable.
My guess is Harris or Rice. Demmings &amp; Duckworth are my tier 2. Abrams &amp; Escobar are personal favs but lack the fed govt experience. And I’m intrigued that so many Warren surrogates have joined the Biden team in the last week, although I can’t imagine him not selecting a WOC.
FOX News lies more and Biden lies less.
“Peo­ple don’t make a dis­tinc­tion—as you well know—from a South Ko­rean &amp; some­one from Bei­jing” ~ Joe #Biden  2020
“You can­not go to a 7-Eleven or a Dunkin’ Donuts un­less you have a slight In­dian ac­cent. I’m not jok­ing” ~ Joe #Biden  2006
I KEEP telling you that President Biden will do that! Then, you will see exactly how important competence &amp; intelligence are to America's leaders. Then you'll be like "WOW!" &amp; then your brain will cramp up b/c you'll finally understand. Then you'll be like "WOW"!
I would argue most of ya who are supporters of Bernie Sanders are generally progressive thinking humans and make decisions based on many things but I’m pretty certain we’re mostly set to vote Biden in
Biden will do that because you are running American into the toilet
The criticisms of VP picks based on idea they won’t bring in new voters seem misplaced to me. Isn’t it right that VPs rarely expand the candidate’s coalition? Certainly seems unlikely it will be decisive this time... Biden should just pick whoever would be best at the job.
Pres. debates have been quiet affairs in recent cycles. Far from a raucous atmosphere. Serious vibe. Arsht Center in Miami for 2nd debate will have 115 in audience all with masks. And Biden did lots of audience primary debates, some raucous. What is your question? Implication?
I personally think Biden just needs to walk out and open and close an umbrella.
I personally think Biden just needs to walk out and open and close an umbrella.
No VP pick is going to magically turn Biden into an appealing candidate.    His team needs to do what the rest of us are left to do: settle...
Joe Biden could debate Joe Biden and still lose.
Unless it is from Biden.
Vote for Biden. #SoManyReasons
The Biden campaign ads just make themselves!
Next year maybe, but it will be under President Biden and the Democratic Senate and House.   Thank you donald!
At the moment, the real people in America prefer Biden to Trump. Can’t dispute that.
excuse me but where the f*ck is Biden’s VP pick??!
Old clip of Biden.
To set the record straight, the number of tweets and lies coming from you and VP Biden are excessive and boring. The incompetence we’ve seen from your party goes beyond anything this country has ever seen.  A Biden victory would certainly destroy the American dream.
If Biden wins office we are going to have a debt jubilee, since the government can not take away gold, what do you think will happen? A few fund managers in my circle are swarming the idea of the new currency backed by gold and bitcoin.  What will you do if the government tries..
Seriously, who cares Biden’s “mental state?” He’s aging like a gentleman not a crazy uncle, and he will surround himself with competent, empathic servant leaders.
While I agree that the two party system here is stupid and I am not a fan of Biden at all... this is not the time to vote third party... Like, I understand the sentiment and I want the two party system gone, but we cannot split our votes up in November. It's too dangerous.
Biden sides with the criminals, illegals, arsonists, lawbreakers,and all who hate America. He’s set on cashing in on the backs of Americans and tearing the country down. That’s what’s the Democrats want. Total power. Socialism.
He's already said he won't vote for Biden.
RE:   "I wish all 350,000 of my followers would cut and paste this and tweet it out right now:  JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN."
You’re gonna beat Biden off? Dude, you’re kinky.
I've seen quite a few Biden supporters living in Trump areas &amp; they are nervous about showing their Biden support so that may just go both ways.  People in Trump families/households, neighborhoods, workplaces keeping quiet about voting for Biden.
I wonder how much Melania is praying for a BIDEN victory in November? She must be thinking, "Get me the hell outta here!"
Also, masks only hurt, they don’t help, Biden is the Anti-Christ, we should outlaw equality, being LGBTQ+ is a choice, and Elon Musk is most certainly an alien.
Susan E. Rice’s vice presidential chances rest on something others lack: A long relationship with Joe Biden
Trump will claim he had 500 million votes and Biden had 1. And will expect everyone to believe him.
And Joe Biden rode that corruption to China and cashed in big time. Sold out America
I trust Joe to pick the VP — in a CRITICAL ELECTION, he’s under pressure &amp; scrutiny to make a perfect call. On  tonight,  showed herself to be a powerhouse contender vs   All these good #Dems show up with #Biden for America in January 2021.
Prevent Biden from taking power would take care of that.
Yep just like I expected he sold out to the mullahs
Charlamagne Tha God says Biden should 'shut the eff up forever' after calling Trump 'first' racist POTUS
You’re another person without morals or conviction. You, after this mockery of the current administration, will not have any credibility left. How dare you use images of Trump’s America and project them unto Biden. Biden is not the President. Please answer.
In the words of  , replacing Trump with Biden is like shitting your pants and changing your shirt. Who cares?
Biden will make everything better the only thing you’re done is create the Trump Virus that is killing Americans
Do y'all have a reason besides 'Trump bad'? Why should we vote for Biden?
Biden doesn’t have dementia. A stutter he has had his whole life and forgetting words on occasion doesn’t mean you have dementia. Stop pushing that bullshit narrative
Like Joe Fucking Biden is any god damn better. Doesn't matter what color skin you got any one who runs does so with they're own intension in mind. When the skin is flayed off the bone we all look the same
Biden says Trump is America's first "racist" president ~Washington Post  I like Biden, but this is bullshit. There're at least a couple of dozen racists in the mix, even by the "standards of the day"measure. (Imagine a punchline here. I can' t think of one.)
You talk about a future that may not even yet exist-a BidenPresidency &amp; use your reverse crystal ball to intimate that what is ACTUALLY happening in Trump's America &amp; DIDN'T happen under Obama/Biden's 8 years running America is going to continue &amp; be worse under Biden. Nice try😝
As Biden says, if your black and don’t support him, then you ain’t black. He automatically assumes blacks will follow him over the cliff.
Woah, Biden is president already? Or is Obama still president.
Born a year later than Biden and three years earlier than Trump, I believe that this guy would be a superior presidential candidate in November. This will be my only tweet re: November 2020. #BillBradley2020.
hey Biden Twitter intern... you're affirming the consequent...  look it up and figure out what you did...
Biden said T was the first racist president. I think that is why... But I might be lying
These 5 words may cost Trump a second term  Analysis by Chris Cillizza, CNN Editor-at-large  Joe Biden Got More Votes?
“Everything we have done to this point as the majority has led the American public to be where it is in wanting to vote for Joe Biden.”        - Ted Cruz (translated)
The fight won't end with Trump alone next we will focus on the Biden Admin for sure! Keep reporting these things for all of us thank you!
Can you tell me what BLM means ? And what is their goal ? And can you tell me why  you support Biden?What and be replaced with plugs Biden won’t happen.
Hopefully Biden not paying attention to these guys.
Some advice to team Biden - get this shit under control. It’s undermining your appearance of leadership. And if you’re going to have a cabinet that looks like America why not your VP vetting team?
Postpone the Election? That Could Mean President Biden  via
Joe Biden will reform the police not defund the police. Get that straight you lying fascist pig.
I hope President Biden recalls him and makes him a General!
I hope he is recalled by President Biden and made a General.  He, and you, are truly American heroes!
Lol, so he thinks California is really in doubt pending VP pick. He can’t possibly be that stupid. Even considering he is Joe Biden.
this also applies to the prinzipulled leftys who feel it necessary to spend all of their time on here letting everyone know that they hate biden and aren't voting. we fucking get it already talk about something else there's a million hundred other things going on in the country
True. But then why does anyone listen to any politician re: "govt created jobs"? I guarantee as soon as Biden is President there will be any number of Rs deriding him for "failing to create jobs".
Oh, haven’t you heard?  Trump executed him with Bill, Hillary, Tom Hanks, Rita Wilson, Biden, and a few hundred others. Those are doubles you see now.
Indeed.  It’s a bad choice but clearly Biden is better
Any chance you want to comment about Biden observation around 4/24 that Trump will want to delay the election?  Made Biden look like Nostradamus.
Biden oversaw implementation of Obama’s Stimulus Plan after the economy crashed under another Republican president. Millions of jobs added. Now under this Republican President all that gain is gone
Lol 😂😂😂😂 good lord the Democrats are concerned about Joe Biden! The one candidate literally worse than Hillary Clinton! Good job Dimms
That’s what your boy Biden said
As if it is any surprise that the Russians will interfere in this election and try to to the so-called "October Surprise". No surprise either that the Republicans will help.
This is BS using the Eulogy for John Lewis to campaign for Biden through Obama? Why isn't Biden out there speaking? Being in office 47 years I am sure he knew John Lewis very well.The Demos do not want you to see how incompetent Biden really is. WOW They stoop so low. Trump 2020
Swing Voters in Michigan Just Offered the WORST News for Joe Biden!  via
Scott, you know you are not voting for Biden but you are voting for the VP.
No worries everytime Biden opens his mouth he puts his foot in it.
Right MN is Trumps fault, so tired of Obama/Biden political BS
Jason, millions of folks believe Trump is the worse President in history and a lying criminal. When asked about Biden’s qualifications to be President, you replied “better than Trump”. That’s quite the endorsement!  Biden’s better than a criminal.
I think they will respond either way, unless Biden commits to Medicare 4 all, open Borders, abortion until birth, defunding the police, student loan forgiveness and universal income, they are going to riot.
Offset by the many republicans who will vote for Biden. You’re boy just ain’t that popular.
Are you scared? Americans already know...Joe Biden wins!
Why wasn’t Biden there, he’s the nominee, not Obama? He’s the one who should have spoke.
I think the Biden campaign shifted into a higher gear today with the remarks at John Lewis’s memorial service.
The Marxist puppet Biden will never debate President Trump.
It was a Democrat rally since they are having to go virtual next month. Where was Biden?
Why didn’t Biden speak, he’s the Democrat nominee? This was a racist, partisan rant at an honorable mans funeral. Gross
8 years Obama/Biden administration and between the two of them they never accomplished crap.
So is Biden next with his political rally speech, oh wait he was in his basement this morning. Why wasn’t he a speaker, he’s the Democrat nominee?
I mean, Biden isn't President. Not sure what you are on about, buster?
They have to keep Flynn quite until after the election, he knows far to much about the Obama/Biden corruption
…can't even land on platforms like    ✔️ Democrats don't support pedophilia (Remember IT WAS BIDEN who proposed #VAWA &amp; got it passed into law. Do you think #HumptyDumptyDonaldTrump would do THAT??)   Now #STFU &amp; SAY THE NAMES of those NEEDLESSLY MURDERED BY POLICE
Team Trump .... If Biden knew how to fix America, why didn't he tell Obama?🤷‍♀️
No one Biden is sworn in he no longer has any say about anything
Good tweet. Helps keep Americans informed about how sick you are. It makes more and more Americans deciding to vote for Joe Biden for President.
Keep tweeting tweets like this. It helps more Americans make their decision to vote for Joe Biden.
.   So Biden was crazy to suggest Trump would seek to delay the election hey...  You must be a real high character individual to stand idly by and allow this to occur
Senator Jones... if Alabamaians are not smart enough to re-elect you... it will be their loss! However... Joe Biden will need an excellent Attorney General to right the wrongs and represent all Americans in our fight for a more just America! Can’t wait!
Agreed, better to delete or point out.
It’s not real someone mixed in audio of  with this video.   However, Trump still stands and moves like an inebriated Sasquatch!
Trump would use this as ammunition for his whole Deep Fakes excuses... maybe better to just delete this crap!
Oh yeah it’s  I remember he did a comedy video impersonation exactly like this. Someone toon the audio from his video and used some digital effects to make it sound live and mixed it, this is fake please don’t retweet! Don’t let Trump claim Fake News!!!
It sounds a lot like that guy who does a great impersonation of Trump and is hilarious. I can’t remember his name at the moment but, even though I can’t stand Trump, I don’t think is real. Also, that funny guy didn’t make this either, it’s one of his existing impersonations.
We had that with Biden and I know he’ll pick someone that fits that description. Kamala Harris fits that description.
“He doesn’t have to win the election. He just has to create a plausible narrative that he didn’t lose.” (Correction: It doesn't need to be plausible. Nothing in his alt reality is plausible yet his cult buys it no matter what.)
So he supports illegal immigration? So Biden is for no immigration laws and 100% open borders! #Ludicrous
Where are their masks? Didn’t Biden recently state that he would have a national mandate to require every American were a mask? #Hypocrite
Mr. Biden has made a good step, yes — but I suspect his vice presidential pick and most of his cabinet won’t follow through even a little bit.
I voted for Mr. Biden in the Democratic primary. However, I remain uncommitted for the general election.
I would not vote for biden in any other election. But fuck he’s not making it any easier.
Translation - big tech is stealing the election for Biden
He never got to talk they were all to busy campaigning for Biden
Well apparently it’s going to be President Harris anyway, I don’t give Biden 3 months in office if he wins.
Why is this a bad thing?  Biden is a weak candidate and the best thing he can do for the country is pick a strong, young, VP to carry the torch in four years
That was the Biden porridge that you have taken. GREAT JOB!!
Not excited about Joe Biden? Not excited that you may not like his VP pick? Then grit your teeth and vote for for him anyway or it will be another very exciting and horrible 4+ years.
She is too old for Biden so who 😮
This guy and Sleepy Joe Biden should never operate a vehicle together! 😳😳😳
…but the rest of the Dem party didn't agree, and Biden is STILL better than Trump, as long as he selects a reasonable VP. He'll LISTEN to the advisors trying to manipulate him, rather than actively ignoring anything that wasn't already in his head.
VP BIDEN looks incredible in this clip thank you
can't wait to glue humongous joe biden chompers onto bob odenkirk
Please provide evidence of this claim that prices will quadruple under a Biden led United States.  Feels... somewhat exaggerated
It’s not like Biden’s going to run for a second term
I wonder if he said this because VP BIDEN called him out yesterday about not being prepared to distribute the VACCINE rapidly when it’s available?
You are the voice of reason and calm! Riden with Biden! 💙💙💙
Biden should make it known that, if/when elected should Russia continue with their brazen behavior he will not only restore troop levels but increase them.
Joe Biden is not a Radical! If you think he is, you’re stupid like Trump!
The DNC manipulated the electoral process. Election reform must be addressed. I agree the Dems need to find a way to walk back Biden. Republicans need to walk back Trump.
The Dems put on another media event for political propaganda purposes. They never intended to have a hearing. We get all this BS from the Marxist Democrats, while Biden hides in his basement. Biden’s a disgrace to himself and the  country that he fleeced for 45 years.
Joe Biden's competence isn't a question   Nice parrot though but try again
You turned your serious piece on COVID19 into a get-Trump political hit piece. Subtle digs at the Trump admin turned into typical mainstream media propaganda. Jon Karl was almost gleeful. Nice pix of Biden too. U R corrupt. #mondaythoughts
Are they all going to write a book 😂😂😂😂😂what a scam we use to have a force called the FBI that help keep America safe but Obama and Biden ruined that
They will call for peace if Biden wins
Absolutely and an excuse to get Biden out of debates
America will be GREAT with Biden as POTUS and Trump in jail!
You spelled Biden wrong..
And you still haven't said what constitutional rights you've lost.   I lost a chunk of my business, but I'm not blaming POTUS. You put Biden's handlers in office and l really will be out of job. Good chance you'll be too, even longer than needed.
And Biden is the poster boy for Mensa? Pfft, the GOP pork is nothing compared to what the Dems want.   You appear to have time on your hands so maybe expanding your reading selections might be good.
I'm convinced this should be Biden's opening line of the first debate
I really can’t think of anything that could be revealed about Biden that would change my mind to not vote for him. Trump is so vile, unworthy and unprepared to be president. There’s little chance of major skeletons in Biden’s closet after his long tenure in public life.
Biden‘s limited press conference today  looked like an elderly patient in an assisted living facility being spoon fed soft food.  Not one tough question and the cadence in his voice made it seem like there was someone in his ear telling him what to say.
Biden calls on predetermined questions.  What a loser!
Joe Biden just said “crimate clisis.” Amazing. What a communicator. #bidengaffe
This is not a hearing. This is Dems doing Joe Biden’s election work!  All talking points that Biden can’t articulate. Obamacare, mail in voting, gun laws, what is this hearing for? Speeches by Dems that totally distort facts, without any rebuttal allowed!
Joe Biden should NOT debate Trump. Debating a pathological liar who relies on outrageous conspiracy theories to galvanize a rabidly bigoted base is harmful to America's best interests.  #NoDebateNeeded  #NoDebateNeededLetsVote
Our country  will fall and handed to the new world order by Biden and Obama
I loved this! Her sheer amazement at hearing President Barack Obama’s and Vice President Joe Biden’s voices brought me to huge happy tears! Then, to hear her tell us her age? I got down on my knees and thanked God for this generation! These are our future leaders. #VoteJoe
As long as the Electoral College outcome is not close, there is no reason to allow any challenge to the results, no matter what Trump claims. Biden will be sworn in on January 20th. Immediately thereafter, the Secret Service will remove Trump from the White House as a trespasser.
Biden won’t debate, anywhere, any time.
Look, Biden wasn't my first choice either. But he's the one that got here, and we won't get shit if Trump wins another 4 years. Trump is setting this election up so a peaceful transfer of power will never happen. Then we'll find ourselves in a police state.
Not a smart move Joe! Murder is against the law and the Catholic Church!  Radical Pro-Abortion Group Endorses Joe Biden: It Was an “Easy Decision”
Biden doesn’t even wipe himself, he has no clue what this tweet is even about.
What the hell is that that the black patriot is speaking to? I can’t determine if it’s male or female? Notice no response to his question about Biden and the 94 crime bill. I would be surprised if whatever that was knew anything about the crime bill.
Thinking about how every other democratic candidate would’ve mandated masks but we chose joe biden
Totally disagree, I think there's a lot of people that will vote for Biden just because who he chooses, especially if it is a black woman, she will likely bring together a huge part of the voters that is needed to end this dictatorship. America needs a woman And of color for VP
A bipartisan group secretly gathered to game out a contested Trump-Biden election. It wasn’t pretty
Not sure Joe Biden really IS in the race at this point... Sure seems to be a placeholder is all...
And here's how they begin to cancel the debates between Biden and Trump...
A school in TX, Florida or SD are the only States that will allow a debate. Biden probably won’t show up, but they can ask Trump questions and Biden’s handlers will send in written answers.
Make no mistake about it, the New Socialists are Marxists who are in bed with the CCP in China. Obama, HRC and Biden all profited from their cozy relationship with the CCP.
Good luck, Chris Wallace. Unlike President Trump, Biden is hiding in plain sight. He and his puppeteers are afraid that his incompetence will be revealed more than it already has been. Vote Trump and Republican in November.
Georgia: Trump 49, Biden 46 Kentucky: Trump 60, Biden 34 Michigan: Trump 50, Biden 45 Montana: Trump 52, Biden 42 North Carolina: Trump 49, Biden 46 Pennsylvania: Trump 48, Biden 47 Texas: Trump 49, Biden 45 take our poll - story
It’s far past time for Americans to know the real polling numbers. And these are likely to cause Democrats to heat up the suicide hotline. It’s definitely bad news for Camp Biden. Because President Trump is crushing creepy Joe, especially in swing states where it matters most.
Joe Biden’s public persona is far from the one portrayed by Robert Redford in the 1972 movie “The Candidate.” Biden’s portrayal of his candidacy is much closer to Lawrence Harvey’s 1962 portrayal of “The Manchurian Candidate.” As Shakespeare said it, “All the world’s a stage.”
Why does yet another septuagenarian white guy have any say in this at all? Ffs Biden.
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
I agree! He got one from President Bush but given the current air at WH I don't see current pres doing it or not making it seem phony. Biden should once in office.
Biden’s puppeteers are keeping him locked in his storage box in the basement of the mansion in Delaware that he built while feeding at the public trough for nearly 50 years. Vote Trump and Republican in November. Drain the swamp of corrupt Democrats.
No contest in the match up of Biden vs Trump. Biden’s a loser every time. He couldn’t even win the Democrat nomination in 2016 over Crooked Hillary. Vote Trump and Republican in November. Save our constitutional republic from the Manchurian Candidate and his socialist agenda.
He'll crush Biden in at least two debates. Can't wait to watch. By the way Jen, you'll be fortunate to navigate any walking surface as well as Trump when you're his age.
Wow it's almost like Biden was the wrong choice
Biden is a no-show physically and mentally. Vote Trump and Republican in November.
Trump Tailors Conflicting Ads to Blacks, Whites on Biden Record  no surprise the trump campaign has to use negative advertising because there are no good things to say about the clown they are trying to promote.
Basement Biden?  Where you been Rudy you waiting to release your Ukraine horseshit soon we know you have the goods on Biden bahaha haha
Just less of them.   Biden supporters don't need to jump up and down screaming WHITE POWER to be heard in November.
Biden’s America
Pelosi is beginning to look like the Marxist Apparatchik that she’s become, as she runs cover for Biden’s and Nadler’s screw-ups. Vote Trump and Republican in November. Take back the House and Senate. Make America Great Again.
Nope. And a lot more comes with Biden than just that.
It’s the party of peace, Democrats and Biden supporters who want to destroy our country, sicking group
Biden voters will destroy America, they are criminals and promote this behavior
You mean the Democrat rioters and Biden supporters who have been looting, smashing windows, lighting fires, shooting people, the destruction of the US is all on your party!
Repeat after me:   Pro-fracking means you support man made earthquakes.   Joe Biden said he will ban fracking, killing man made earthquake jobs across PA.
Pennsylvania is going to turn blue for Biden in November. The silent majority is strong there.
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
There is no Muslim ban. There was a ban from terrorist hot spots that have no real functioning government. So Biden is saying he’s going to end that ban? Seems kinda stupid.   So Biden’s security plan is to defund police and let in terrorists. Remember that when you vote.........
succession but with joe biden
Too busy donating to Biden and down ballot Democratic candidates. #BlueWave2020
Biden is a chicken 🐓. Vote Trump and Republican in November.
Biden and his handlers are afraid to expose Biden’s level of cognitive impairment to the public any more than his declining mental functions have already been revealed. The Democrats ought to be ashamed of running him as their candidate. He’s clearly a Manchurian Candidate.
Sir...all you do is discredit Biden if he would win....what will YOU do? Get a PLAN
Now do Joe Biden...
I posted that yesterday. Biden supporters will have to wear blue MAGA hats.
trump can’t “DEFINE” Joe Biden as a EVIL WOMAN or a SECRET MUSLIM, so he’s decided to make every DEMOCRAT his opponent.  But if he loses, it won’t be because he didn’t get enough VOTES, it’s because TOO MANY AMERICANS were allowed to vote in his opinion
You mean some one who cares about our safety and property?   Biden looks at the violent protestors as his base and hasn’t said a peep.
Rigged eh? You mean like having Kanye West run to pull votes away from Biden? That kind of Rigged?
We need you!!!    Save us by joining Joe Biden as his Vice President.
The man who told millions of Americans,"you ain't black," and used the term "Blafrican American," said that OUR President is RACIST. Joe Biden has ABSOLUTELY lost his mind. President Trump is a champion for Black Voices. He always has been and he always will be.
AND THEY ALL FALL DOWN. Poor Donald can’t BEAT JOE BIDEN, so he’s running against these imaginary “PUPPETEERS”? He’s a sad morbidly obese man
But Wallace is a Democrat so he would give Biden softball questions, there really is no reason Biden should not let Wallace interview him unless he has something to hide.
Registered and waiting for my mail in ballot so I can vote for Biden
Jake is biased, encourage Biden to let Wallace interview him, he’s your candidate. PS, the Intel Community  never confirmed the reports which is why Trump was never told.
Biden campaign declines 'Fox News Sunday' interview, 1 week after Chris Wallace's Trump sitdown   No surprise
I do think that biden is going to win but also the fact that everyone has just resigned to that being the reality and no one seems to have a plan b in case of a trump upset is uhh... alarming
progressives can't even get a senate candidate nominated and we're still doing the "_______ 2024" thing like a left challenge to biden('s vp) would be anything other than a huge waste of resources at this point
Dear god no. I saw what she did when I lived in SF Bay Area. I know a lot of people who won’t vote for Biden if he picks het
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
Headwinds?  What headwinds?  What does that say about Biden?
Crazy Me said Myself made a mistake when I banned people from infected China from entering the U.S. in January.   Turns out it made no difference as Me, Myself &amp; I all FAILED to act to stop the spread of #Coronavirus   Because of that, we all have Biden wanting to overthrow us
Ohh you mean like  does??   Well at least  doesn't have HIS PHONE surgically attached to HIS HAND   Biden can ACTUALLY PUT HIS PHONE DOWN 🤣😂
Biden/Bernie supporters
The problem is it’s all Democrats and Biden’s supporters who are starting the fires, looting, shooting people and want to defund the police. They are so stupid and vile that they can’t control themselves and find a way to become a member of society
Hear Joe Biden. He did not say he wanted to defund the police! Stop lying‼️
Joe Biden DID NOT SAY he wanted to defund the police. Stop lying. I know it’s your first impulse to lie, but you KNOW that’s not true!

Yes I can't wait to Mark the Spot for Biden😷
Only 100 days until the people of Colorado vote to re-elect President  Senator  and Republicans across the state.   Coloradans know that Biden's socialist agenda would destroy jobs, raise taxes, and make us less safe. #LeadRight
Joe Biden will not defund the police Donald Trump is lying to you again
No surprise here.  They'll eat their young for a win.  Biden organizers say campaign is 'suppressing the Hispanic vote' in Florida, mistreating staff

Pardoning Reality Winner must be one of Joe Biden's first official acts as President.
Biden will have nothing to do with his VP pick. The DNC will pick a black woman, hopefully he can correctly pronounce her name and likes the smell of her hair.
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
I will vote Biden for all of the solid reasons, but I am so looking forward to not having to see trump’s gawd awful combover, weave, plugged hair or whatever that shit is he calls hair, ever again at or near our White House.
They won't cover it because it will bring Biden down with the rest of them. Getting Trump out is their goal and like all things leftist, the ends justify the means.
Biden, the Manchurian Candidate, has no idea of what’s going on Portland. He’s hiding out in his basement in Delaware, while his strings are being pulled by the Marxist Democrats Sanders, Warren and AOC.
Check this out
Biden lies Americans die.
This is akin to someone putting a TRUMP yard sign in front of their home. It’s one sign in usually a street of 20-25 homes. I’m not a statistician, but that’s potentially 24 BIDEN VOTERS
Our favorite President, Obama and soon to be Biden, wouldn’t have killed so many Seniors with their incompetence. That’s why Seniors everywhere are #RidenWithBiden

Joe Biden's disastrous plans for America's suburbs  via
"regular republicans" - That's who supports trump. That's the party, there's no 'taking trump out of Rs'. They should back biden after the election and create a centrist party. Trumpism is over 90% of the republican party, they need to understand that.
NEWS FLASH 🚨⁦ SIGNED a OFFICIAL GOVERNMENT LETTER asking the UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT to do exactly what he is trying to “CLAIM” VP BIDEN did was a crime. The PROSECUTOR was a corrupt RUSSIAN HACK, we don’t support RUSSIANS RON
I read someone else's comment that thinks it's BO, because there is no law against him being VP, now. But I didn't think it all the way through, like, what that would mean in February/March when "all of a sudden" Biden is unable to discharge the duties of his office.. 🤯🤯
PMT turned down an interview with Biden...not PFT.
When Biden wins we’ll have to wear blue MAGA hats.
Obama/Biden were made aware of Russia trying to interfere in our elections in 2015 and decided it wasn’t worth their time to take action
I was so ready and then he endorsed biden over Bernie and it broke my heart
I’d be way more concerned about Biden winning and Democrats defunding the police.
You don't exactly make us feel safe either, pal.
For 45+ years Biden was in the Congress and served as Obama’s VP during which time he accomplished nothing. Now he want to be POTUS. Fool me once. Shame on you. Fool me twice. Shame on me. Vote Trump in November. Make America Great Again.
Joe Biden is up +15
The Marxist Democrats in the US are in bed with their political brothers and sisters in the CCP in China and are likely getting paid to collude with them to elect Biden. Follow the money.
Biden has no plan. It’s his puppet masters who do.
VPs mean very little. Fifteen minutes of Biden during debate should do it.
Of course they are Biden’s family needs more money
Did you make a song for Joe Biden?
The Deep State in the FBI is slow moving this legal process, thinking that it will all go away if Biden wins the Presidential election in November.  And, they are right. Should the Dems win, America will be a lawless country with a Manchurian Candidate as President.
Biden promises to continue the Democratic Party's crusade against Catholics   is not a Catholic, he is not a man of faith!
Joe Biden is a puppet for the Marxist Democrats in Congress, including Sanders, Warren, AOC, and Pelosi who are being sponsored by the Communist Party in China. The CCP wants Biden to be POTUS.
Funny how Trump and his supporters started talking about Biden being in a "basement" after Trump literally hiding in bunker came out. Projection is typical for Trump, he accuses others of what he has done and hopes that people won't notice
I’m voting for him too.  If you want to see America fail vote for Biden and if Biden wins buy all the gold you can afford.
President Trump said tonight on Hannity that Biden is controlled like a puppet.
Woodrow Wilson was a Democrat and a well known elitist bigot. Biden has lost his game, if he ever had one.
What a PERFECT statement. "They are literally biding their time with Biden." 100%
Biden is a puppet for the Marxist Democrats in Congress who are controlled by the CCP in China. He is truly the first legendary “Manchurian Candidate.” Vote Trump and Republican in November. Save our constitutional democracy and our liberty. Make America Great Again
Hold a candle to Biden or Obama 😂

Ask Obama/Biden, they are the ones who built the cages and wrote the bill.
That’s a joke, he said he’s the first racist President, Biden is a racist with Dementia
Honestly, I  feel like both Biden and Trump are suffering from dementia or something of that sort. I wish that we had better options, but I can not vote for Trump this time around.
Housewives eh?  Will Biden prevent them from pleasing their man?
Suburban Women Men For Biden
It’s literally Trump’s America lol he’s the current president and this shit is happening now. I’m still not voting for Biden, but let’s be honest with ourselves here.

Biden is simply a crook, having extorted  a fortune from the Ukraine and China with the help of his son, Hunter Biden. BTW: Where’s Hunter?
Just out of curiosity, you do realize socialism is the BIGGEST form of government?  You do realize “big spending” is nothing compared to socialism?  Joe Biden has already said he would get rid of Trump tax cuts for more big government!
AG, it’s obvious and completely clear that VP BIDEN is saying that trump referring to COVID-19 as the “Chinese Virus”, puts a TARGET 🎯 on the back of every ASIAN DECENT AMERICAN. His followers aren’t smart enough to distinguish the difference in their nationalities,how about you
The nurse must have been blowing pot smoke up Biden’s nose. He’s hallucinating.
So, you want Biden to “broadcast” his cognitive test results if he took one? I imagine it wasn’t any big deal to him. 45 thinks it was a huge deal and why not? He’s a “stable genius”. Just ask him. Bat crap crazy.
Did you hear that Joe Biden was indicted for criminal activity in Ukraine?
Biden is one scary Dude, and the Marxist Democrats who are pulling his strings will destroy our constitutional republic and our liberty. Vote Trump and Republican in November.

Biden will promise everything and do nothing. He did nothing during his 40+ years in the Congress and 8 years as Obama’s VP. Vote Trump and Republican in November.
I guess if I was a BETTING PERSON, given that the BIDEN CAMPAIGN wrote a Political Plan with the SANDERS CAMPAIGN, they aren’t looking to Senator Warren for IDEAS? That would of been their biggest opportunityIt’s a lie, just like Biden is ahead of Trump!!
Lol I believe you're talking about Biden when it comes to "dementia."
After Harris capitulated on her school busing attack on Biden, and later endorsed him. I interpret this charming star struck photo of Kamala Harris to mean.  I will do anything including allow you to touch my hair if you will choose me to be your running mate.

Biden gonna lose
Omg! Republicans for Biden. No! Nobody could be that stupid. Anyone who even considers Biden is not intelligent enough to vote. It is obvious that he is very sick. Cia/FBI should be vetting, &amp; telling him he cant run. Duh!
He babbles almost as bad as Biden!!
"A group of Biden allies, including a few of his top donors, initiated a campaign against Harris close to a month ago, just weeks before a decision is expected."  "The concerns focus on her attacks on Biden during a primary debate last year..."
Don’t get me wrong, it’s great Biden’s picking a woman for vp. but it feels like a little treat where a man is still wielding power. Then some editors write this crap... like don’t you want candidates to be ambitious?
Since Biden suffers from CRS, he won't have any strategy.
"New polls, at least one of which leans solidly leftward, show President Donald Trump gaining ground on presumptive 2020 Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden in nearly all “battleground” states ..."
"Carlson: Big Tech Engaging in Censorship on Coronavirus to Help Biden"

The real sadness is when Biden wins, and the rot Trump has laid out continues to spread. Which sets up the pendulum for another crazy authoritarian after Biden. Oh well you had a good run America.
The Trump admin is destroying 'hard working families' with everything you do. McConnell and Barr are doing everything they can to protect these abuses. I recommend that you shut up and hide until Biden takes over in January and you can go back to a private life.
A Bernie Sanders campaign co-chair says choosing between Trump and Biden is like having 'a bowl of s--- in front of you, and all you've got to do is eat half of it'    Having advisers like her  explains why Bernie lost.
did more for this country in only 3 1/2 years! While Joe Biden failed the American people for 40+ years!  This is why we must re-elect President Trump

Of course they'll vote for Biden, they're stoopid like the Democrats. This clown cost me money. Took away deductions so we paid more in taxes. The deficit tripled. Nancy bought a new gown every night of the week. If Biden wins, that'll cost me for the free stuff you want.

If you are not voting for Biden you are voting for Trump.
You show me this says medicare for all! Biden is all for healthcare for all! IT DOES NOT HAVE TO BE MEDICARE!
Yep. I want healthcare too. I know it is an issue. But those that won't for Biden because he won't back Medicare for all, well Trump wins. Then you get nothing. He will dismantle ACA. So you are willing to put trump in office for 4 more years (or more) for one issue?
You must have psychosis. This has nothing to do with Joe Biden. #TrumpIsACrybaby #TrumpFailsAmerica
I am not sure Joe Biden should even be driving a car, let alone running a country.  I am waiting for him to forget which country he lives in.  He has seemed to forget just about everything else.  I thought I was bad at public speaking.  I am looking pretty good.  And I am on Oxy.
the majority of us feel this way.  You’re attacking Biden’s health, age, etc., make you look scared and desperate.
This is not how we do things in this country. What if Joe Biden wouldn’t give relief to red states and cities after a disaster? What if congress passed a law where no state got back more than they give?  What then?
Joe Biden has a plan to tackle systemic racism, while you either promote White supremacy, or argue it doesn’t exist.
I can’t imagine how his handlers could agree to let him debate Joe Biden.
Why would people think the author of the "crime bill" has evolved? Biden has always been an authoritarian. Voting to put him in office will only allow him to embrace his inner dictator.
So you spoiled child, do you realize this is not about Joe Biden and your one issue stance. You are voting for: Women's right to choose, SCOTUS, Secretary of State, AG, IG, Federal Judges, Ambassadors, the Lt. Vindman's of the world, and the list goes on and on. Ridiculous!
If Biden is indeed elected President, who will be in charge in the White House? It sure as hell won't be Joe.
It would be interesting to hear how Biden squares his proposal to “help small business” with stories like this of the giants, not just tech companies, but others like Amazon/Walmart too, using their monopoly power to stomp on the little guys out there.
So Biden and his crack economic team believe "investing $150 billion of already allocated spending to help minority small businesses owners" is the answer to racial inequality. I never would have guessed
Not impressed.  Joe Biden has been quarantined for 5 months.   Take that Canada.
Here is my take. Read that 13 % of country is left undecided. Rest fixed. Biden debating trump scares the shit out of me.
How did he and Biden buy islands with military installations and submarine tunnels?

Your vid could just as well have bring taken during the Obama/Biden crackdown of the Occupy movement; neither the GOP nor the Dems tolerant dissent against their corrupt governing authority. Voting is useless. Stay in the streets. Organize against the ruling elites.

Is Joe Biden a rapist? Has he bragged about grabbing women’s genitals? Is he currently being sued by one of his rape victims? Is Biden suspected of raping a 13 year old? Bragged about walking in on naked teens in a jr. miss America?  No? Then I’m voting for Biden.

JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
It amazes me that so many "progressive" commentators unquestioningly accept the extremely improbable victory of Joe Biden on "Super Tuesday" buying the rational that "critical endorsements" and the "powerfully influential" corporate media swung the election. Yeah sure...
"Our vote"... You've got to be kidding me. Biden and most of Washington are thinking in terms of 30 years to address climate/ecological change. Voting is not going to change a damn thing. Stay in the streets. Disrupt business as usual. Organize.

Is Biden a rapist? Has he bragged about walking in on naked teens at a pagent? Has Biden been sued for lying about raping a woman in a dept store dressing room? How about raping a 13 year old with Epstein? Has Biden wished a child trafficker well?  No Sean? Then Biden has my vote
Which means illegal aliens, citizens of another country will be able to vote in OUR elections. Thus is what Dems wanted all along. More voter fraud. They know Biden can’t beat Trump in a fair election.
Biden is old and senile...f'ing clown show
I have a friend that just traveled 10 thousand miles across America. She saw Trump signs everywhere. Saw 1 small Biden  yard sign. November 3rd is going to be biblical.
Biden, 45%-47%, approval equal with Obama's in 2012 (This is interesting)
What has he done for anyone but his own party and family.  Remember the Biden mantra;  Family First.  😂
Biden has supporters?
Biden is not capable of rational thought… Same as you.
And we’re the racists? The way the left throws things around doesn’t this make Biden supporters racist pedophiles?If Trump resigns he doesn’t “lose”. Then Pence can pardon him as Ford did for Nixon. Win-win.  Pence gets to say he was Prez for a few months before Biden takes office.
He is trailing Biden by a lot right now. I really REALLY doubt he turns it around with so little time to go.
biden said his VP pick would be ready for the presidency “on day one.” Rice has never held elective office, has had no involvement in domestic policy. it will be a tough sell. but not the worst possible choice: that would be klobucop. that’s why my money is still on her.
I did that during the first Biden interview i watched after he became the nominee
A lot of people seem to act like Obama and Biden are perfect.   Yeah Trump is really fucking bad, but Obama and Joe have their flaws.
POTUS lays trap. "Delay election?" Libs lose their minds and come out in force. "No way! Election isn't moving! No authority!" Biden taken down, Dems in despair. Delay the election!! We need time for new candidate! POTUS (smirking): Sorry, you said no delays. Imma reclaim my time
We were until the Chinese Flu.  No one could sustain the prosperous economy through that. Biden has trouble with where he is and what year it is. You know it. You’re just too bias to think logically.
You'd better wake up and listen to this all you Christians and Americans...This election is about the future of our country! A vote for Biden is a vote for the downfall of our society!!!
Joe Biden for example.  And he ended up working very well together with Obama.
‘Your Daddy is a traitor’: Ex-tea party lawmaker slams Don Jr’s attempt to mock Joe Biden
You have no point here. Are you so myopic that names must be spelled one way? Utter Tripe. I suggest you spend some serious time actually reading the teachings of Jesus bc you dont appear to be walking in his shoes. Again, check out Joe Biden for how a President should act.
Campaign sent out an embargoed email to reporter’s today, then this happens. In related news, water is wet. There is obviously no choice who lines up better for Biden than Harris. She’s the right fighter, can be a transitional choice, and would be ready day one. It’s a good pick.
Let's move on to something tangible. What will be the impact of Joe Biden's tax policies to raise $10T?
I’m not sure how this is related to...anything?  Who the fuck cares how many people watched? Biden is a horrible choice for president....which is sadly still light years better than his competition.  So, yep, voting for him, because he’s the best of the viable options available.
I have lost all respect for anybody who thinks Biden is clear headed enough to be president. The poor man cannot even stay coherent; he should be navigating his mental deterioration in private and with dignity! I actually feel sorry for him forced on public display by the party!
How can Biden lose with Jay Leno on his side?
OK FYI there is a video going around of Biden saying the N-word a couple times. He is QUOTING another Senator in a hearing on complaints against the guy.  Just so you know if any of you have ignorant lame friends who post this as if Biden is saying it for himself.
Vote for Joe Biden
It’s fine. Joe Biden will be there to throw out the pitch
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU.  AGAIN.
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
Biden's path to the White House could hit a dead end on Facebook
You just need to shut your mouth and sit down Karyn. I don’t know how any God-fearing Republican can say those words out loud. Dump has nothing to do with God, make no mistake. If you’d like to see someone who does, consider visiting Joe Biden’s website
I hope you will copy and paste this because the GOP and Donald Trump is lying!!  JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
#EarlyMailInBallots  I’m electing Biden in October!  Who’s with me? #RidinWithBiden #GoJoe2020
so sorry these chuds have you defending biden, but totally understand: imagine any #MAGAt thinking they're capable of an opinion that's worth sharing in public
Did Joe Biden, Like Comet NEOWISE, Peak Too Soon?
I don't think Karen Bass has the same national standing as Kamala Harris; I would be astonished if Biden choose Bass. They're trying to make it lose-lose to choose the black woman b/c that is how they do.  You are so right.  Intersectional feminists need to call this shit out.
Not suburbs....but have a suburban! Does that count? And will vote for Joe Biden
so 👏 much 👏 party 👏 unity!!  biden campaign just bridging the hell out of those divides—with republicans
wow, loving this elevated discourse! joe biden is really bringing decency back, y’all
I bought my home bc of the $8000 first time home buyer tax credit 11years ago. Now I raise my 2 kids here. Thanks Obama Biden!
I don’t think Biden could do worse than a spiking pandemic, high unemployment and unsafe schools. I have my home bc of the $8000 first time home buyer tax credit brought to you by...wait for it...The Obama Biden ticket!  Thanks again guys!
That is well said and a fine goal. Can you help persuade Mr. Biden and his team to adapt their policies? $10T in taxes and spend/spend/spend government is not a winning formula.
So tRump is using video of HIS America and telling us this is what Biden's America will look like? He really does think we are all as stupid as he is. Sad!Oh my my my !!!! The latest in sad Liberal Socialist quantum arguing with those who are real Americans and are tired of Democrats base line to get Biden elected at any cost even utilizing Marxist orgs to do their bidding! Soooo - it’s MAGA TRUMP 2020 onward and upward! HOOORRRRA!
This is not an accurate account of the article. It's not saying she'll be disloyal, just distracted by the fact that her own campaign will begin about 2 years into the new Biden administration.
A veep candidate with less national ambition could act more freely and more deferentially toward Biden. The “anointed front runner” baggage won’t be as heavy. These advantages could help Biden with his agenda without hurting the party’s prospects in 2024.
Trump IS worse.  You guys are worse with Benghazi, Hillary's emails and Hunter Biden.  Also, 'libtard' shows you to be a #Cult45 member.  If you want to be taken seriously, drop the Qanon rhetoric.
Don't most states, except for around 8, have at-will employment? It's fantastic that you want more rights for employees! Joe Biden appreciates your vote.
Biden does not utter racial slurs.
you are so right young lady. Biden forgets where he is half the time. We’re screwed either way
Too much collagen. Apparently help your boobs but not your brain. Biden is a rational, kind and experienced leader. Where does your kid go to school?
Echoes of Biden’s 1987 plagiarism scandal continue to reverberate - The Washington Post
Delay and automatically put in Biden the poll leader
I've no doubt there are racially insensitive videos of Biden.  He's been in government since the 70's.  Do you have any racially insensitive videos of Biden in the last 20 years; since the millennium?  We've all learned, grown and changed in the intervening decades.
Heads up! Another obvious, blatant deep state move coming. Durham, almost certain, won't release his report until after election to protect Dems. Says don't want to interfere with results. He prefers we elect Biden, a big part of spygate.
The reason this won't work is republicans have been telling us for years that they're all the same -- corrupt.  Even if Americans think that maybe the Obama administration did something wrong, they'll figure Trump is way worse and Biden will be better for America!
#NobodyLikesTrump Just a joke of a frail, sniveling loser. Vote Biden 2020 &amp; let’s make this country BETTER!!
Are you sure they’re Biden allies⁉️ This sure stinks of Trump/Putin‼️‼️
You would make a fantastic vice president. I hope Biden picks you.
“Debates” are just another chance for Trump to rant and lie in the spotlight. Excepting the unlikely scenario where numbers show debates could help Dems lock up the Senate, Biden should pass. Make embedded fact checkers a condition so Trump will chicken out.
Fox news wants ratings. Biden is hot. Trump is losing. Like a dawg.
So this is your campaign strategy, huh? Poor me, Obama and Biden, Wah. Great choice. Go with that. #JoeBiden2020
What house? 50 million people are unemployed and facing eviction at the end of this week. What will be left when Biden takes over from "your reign?"
Bullshit on this your ads about defunding the police are false and you know it because you can't get the suburban white woman vote away from Biden. Biden is middle ground democrat that will units the US not divide  it like you have.
It’s Joe Biden under that mask.  “You ain’t black if you don’t vote for me”.
You forget, whether it’s true or not, he does whatever he wants...until his regime gets voted out. Vote Biden.
Biden was clear and coherent. Laid out how he would help revive the economy and contain the virus. He didn't lie, he didn't call people names, and he didn't rant incoherently about injecting disinfectants.
Trump abruptly ends briefing after being pressed over retweeting misinformation                                        The guy (trump) is an idiot   Please VOTE BIDEN   Spare our country from being flushed
Wow. Does that mean you are voting for that man in the White House?  Wish I could have threatened my vote all of those years my voting selections lost. I’m guessing Warren would want you to vote Biden. Good luck.
Funny - I have watched Biden speaking at several different events/locations. And being interviewed on different shows.
Just saw a Trump ad that started with text "Biden wants to defund police" &amp; featured a grandma calling 911 during a burglary. The voice on the other end was an answering machine that said something akin to "we can't answer the phone because our budget was cut".  She was attacked
Does anyone wonder why republicans are harping Joe's age and cognitive abilities while Joe is saying he is going to choose a female VP?? That looks like they want momen to vote Biden just in case something happens to him.
Colorado for Biden and WE are going to vote out Senator Cory Gardner out too!
Not going to happen. He’s got nothing to lose and he is going to get worse. I always thought this was why the United States of America has checks and balance. Why isn’t it working?  Vote Biden!
We need more women in positions of power, the highest positions of power, making decisions for our communities.
That may be the case, but it still emphasized how small and petty he is. While he was on Twitter complaining about what was trending, Biden was with the majority of our leaders mourning John Lewis. While he was clearing Lafayette Sq to hold a Bible backwards, Biden was in church.
Obama knew details of wiretapped Flynn phone calls, surprising top DOJ official in meeting with Biden, declassified docs show
If they haven't seen it with 143K+ deaths from COVID-19, kids in camps, tariffs bankrupting their farms, etc. they aren't ever going to change. We need to focus on getting all reasonable people to get out and vote for Biden. Then we can start in on re-education camps. 😉 😂
You mean suffering more than right now? You tend to forget that you are describing the country under your leadership. You have brought us bounties on the lives of our soldiers, 50 million unemployed, 150,44 dead &amp; nationwide civil unrest. . . "What do we have to lose" with Biden?
Reminds me of Nazi jackboots   Wake up America!  We are going in the wrong direction   The Republican Party has veered off the tracks and crashed down a ravine   How many lifelong republicans have said farewell?  Enough to elect Biden!
Person, woman, man, camera, tv . . . Biden is going to cream Trump.
I don't think Joe Biden ought to debate Donald Trump until Trump's tax returns are released.   The left?  Who is the left?
The Left isn't running.  is running against Donald Trump. The polls show Biden capturing most Dem voters and a majority of Independent voters. If voter turnout is strong, as is expected, Biden should win going away.
I’m hearing that from all my contacts as well.  Can’t find one person in my circle that supports Biden.
You mischaracterize Biden. But I’d still vote for your distorted Biden over Trump.
Trump is a pussy and so is Biden
Unfortunately he stole military funds (tax payer money) to build this shoddy wall. Makes me mad. How about you?
They won't be voting against Biden, they get to vote for a number of things at the convention and they are saying they will vote against the platform when it's up for vote. It's not what you are getting at...
I agree. The Biden campaign should have been *asking* to have Wallace interview him after Trump and Gingrich made it sound like he wasn't up to it.
I am and I plan to cast my ote for Joe Biden and every down ballot democratic candidate. In CO that means  A fuck you to
Thank GOODNESS when Biden wins and a NEW &amp; HEALTHY America emerges
A no vote for Biden is a vote for Trump. Can’t be any plainer than that.
Culmination in the last 4 years. The point is, Biden is better than the alternative.
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
Joe Biden debuted his face lift when he started his campaign.  Looks like Kamala will be Biden’s VP pick
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  TRUMP IS LYING TO YOU.
None of my last comment is a commentary on Biden's qualifications
Who does Hickenlooper remind us of?  (Another chicken Democrat hiding named Biden!)
Biden's creepy but he's far better than Trump, who goes far beyond creepy.  Don't sit this one out; vote for Biden!
Oooooohhhh, I’m so scared Gingrich.  That’s really all you’ve got left...fear.  You can’t run on the merits of the Republican Party and it’s leader, Donald Trump.  So, just try bending Biden’s words and scare us.  Your guy (and many of the R’s down ballot) are TOAST.
It’s more than enthusiasm that I will feel when voting for Biden, it will be jubilation. The election will be like completing the Boston Maraton, it will be like winning the lottery, it will be like going on a year long vacation or actually a four year long vacation.
If they are voting third party and voted for trump last time, that helps Biden. Lots are doing this.
The genuine joy that Joe Biden inspires!
All lives matter, i fought for everything u did 3x. Plaguing a race against a race in 2020 is rude, especially when all the rioters are white, blm is blm and i get it im for it, blm riots are wrong tearing down statues are wrong, u had obama and Biden, and they did ...nothing
Let's unpack this. You say Biden is being controlled by other Americans? I'm pretty sure that would be better than being controlled by Russia. Tell your dad [if he answers your calls] golden showers are not taboo anymore? No need to defund the military because of a sex tape.
They are making the HUGE mistake of talking about Biden’s big lead in the polls.  DID THEY LEARN NOTHING FROM 2016⁉️
They are making the HUGE mistake of talking about Biden’s big lead in the polls.  DID THEY LEARN NOTHING FROM 2016⁉️
Biden doesn’t give a damn because he is being manipulated by Communist handlers!!! All he knows is they say oh boy you gonna be President if you announce and sign into dis!! We will control da country as nd ruin the freedoms!! Sign here Joe!!!
Interesting what-ifs: Would Biden have beaten Trump in '16? I think probably. If Biden ran and lost in '16, would Hillary be running against Trump now?
Awesome!  Looking forward to another ad for Biden 2020.
Look at what Trump says, when reading them start with Things Biden would never do or say, insert every time Trumps name is mentioned. That helps tell the story with  the best view.
How about if Trump and Biden both sit down for the same cognitive tests - and release the results to the public? (I'd like to see even one of Trump's critics other than me suggest this.)
I'm voting because I want to be part of the election that gives Biden 50 states and Trump 0.  Every time I read about Biden's lead, I'm more encouraged.  I wish I could save a ticket stub from the shutout.  I want to make Trump the Biggest Loser in American history.
yeah perhaps he does, but it's clear in any interview with Biden something is off..
Today I receive this thank-you letter from Joe Biden.   You are welcome!  He is asking for more, and I will give, gladly!
Go Biden!! Hey Trump are you watching the polls? Maybe you cannot read....your push to open schools is not well received by Republicans or Democrats. Keep pushing to open schools I love it... BIDEN will certainly get elected.
Lol but Biden who is clearly on the verge of Alzheimer’s is going to? The dude doesn’t even know what he himself is saying half the time. This is a joke.
Kamala Harris was a mainstream competitor for the Dem nomination, right?  She might even be Biden’s VP choice (making her de facto POTUS) with Biden’s senility.
When Biden wins. Remember. He would have never been president if Trump had never won the election. Biden would never have been president if Trump was never president...
Please vote for Biden. It’s important.
Why was nothing done when armed racists stormed the Michigan Capital Building? Nothing not a fucking thing. Not a word from the dictator. You all better pray that the next president does not treat R states like that. Oh that’s right Biden would never behave like Ahole.
Thank you VP Biden and Mr President for speaking with honor, passion and love for ALL the people of our country!   You are missed Mr President but know that Mr Biden will put us back on track. God Bless you both! #VoteJoeBidenToSaveAmerica #VoteJoeBiden #BarackObama
We are past due for a woman as president or VP. There have been many qualified women throughout our history that would have been better than the men who got elected.  If Biden does pick a black woman, she does need to be qualified. Our leaders should be more than old white men.
This is Trump’s America. Biden’s not responsible. The frustration finally became too much. Trump has to go.
For the 20th century, it's tough to beat Woodrow Wilson.  It really comes down to 2nd place, where I put Richard Nixon.  Biden needs to open a history book.  Bottom line, I'd much rather have a POTUS that puts his foot in his own mouth than shoving it up every American's ass.
Biden just talked at length about vetting his running mate on ReidOut. There are four black women in the running. But the vetting process is still ongoing, so it's not time for him to announce.
I trust Biden to put qualified people in cabinet positions and as heads of departments - something Trump hasn't done. Trump has had the largest exodus of people in his administration than any president before him.
Have you listened to Trump? How he calls people names? How uninformed and ignorant he sounds? How he refuses to listen to experts?   Biden wasn't my first choice but he's light years ahead of Trump.
I don't get on Facebook.  Biden was my second to last choice. I guess people wen the safe route with an old white guy.   But he is still a thousand times better than Trump. Trump is mean-spirited and a bully.
Ummmmm... Trump is president dumb a**, not Biden. This is literally how stupid the Republican Party is.
I personally love  finally telling people to do the exact thing he blasted Joe Biden for. Very sound re-election reversal. #WearADamnMask
Agreed, but also Kanye is a person that was aligned more with Trump. You can have goofy people who are disappointed with Trump that would write in Kanye before people who are weighing Biden WITH KANYE. I would write in Castro, Warren, Booker before I write in Kanye.
Let me get this straight. The current  re-election strategy is to simultaneously say "forget everything I have said for the last 6 months. Believe what I say now" and Biden is not competent enough to identify an elephant, but is competent enough to wear a mask?Biden was right. I was wrong. I underestimated the depth of Trump's depravity. He will, in fact, try anything to retain power.  Fixed it for you.
Every Trump "deal" ever has been a failure, every business that produces a product or delivers a service. Only two "illusions", branding &amp; reality TV, haven't failed. You are the one with serious mental deterioration, not VP Biden.  But I don't feel sorry for you.
If we vote Biden, we get America back?
He never mentioned Biden.
I agree that this is dumb. Just like Biden saying that if you don't vote for Biden you are not black.
Yes it does. I’ve had Facebook censor 3 articles I posted. One was Joe Biden making a statement reasonable people can disagree what he said. The other was a scientific study that I posted that Facebook doesn’t like. We don’t hear much about liberals being censored by Big Tech.
People with brains lost faith in what Joe Biden said ages ago.
Please show us the evidence that drug prices will quadruple under Biden.  Just saying something doesn't make it true.
I doubt you compared Biden speech pattern from 10 years ago with today. If you did, and you were an honest person, you’d be scared to death of a Joe Biden presidency. Nearly 40% of Americans believe he’s in decline.
Lol.  “Nobody likes me”.  You cant make this up... Biden doesn’t have to say a word, just push play and you bury yourself is  his campaign ad.  Amazing!!
He’s absolutely correct. Donald Trump gets positive things done. Joe Biden will mess things up.
How does that distinguish Trump from Joe Biden? Congressional Democrats? Any other Democrat official?
Joe Biden Will Not Defund the Police !!!    Donald tRump is Lying to Americans Again !  Fact !
We can be sure that if Joe Biden wins and the investigation isn’t completed, he will end it.
His running mate will become known as Biden’s puppeteer.
A lot of people have no faith in what Joe Biden says. He’s changed so many lifetime positions in the last six months he doesn’t know who he is.
No one has ever said that Joe Biden looks like a strong candidate. The man has declining mental faculties. Often doesn’t know where he is. Won’t take any difficult questions because he doesn’t understand them.
I see that you’re feeding your obsession again today. Not a word about Joe Biden saying that the Department of Homeland Security is now a private militia.
The Department of Homeland Security is now a private militia according to Joe Biden? Not only is he mentally challenged, he sounds insane.
Biden’s campaign would never put him in front of an audience that might ask such a question.
Go away John, it is sickening you will support Biden and progressives which will destroy the republic because your feelings are hurt. Swamp republicans are disgusting to majority of conservatives and republicans.
That's the flag of Ukraine. I celebrated my 30th Birthday there, 11 years ago in July. Fun fact, VP Joe Biden was there with his son Hunter.
Want proof that the Left isn't thinking clearly? In the off-chance that  loses his reelection bid, he'd be eligible to run again in 2024. Then he could just point to a failed "Biden" term and say "See? I told you I could do it better." #MAGA2020
Based on the video of Biden calling Chris "Chuck" I wouldn't be surprised if called China "Korea" or vice-verse. #BidenIsCorrupt #MAGA2020 #WhoIsReallyRunningForPresident
Biden doesn’t have to!  Trump is a dumpster fire.  Just think of a sitting President losing in the polls to an aging ex VP who doesn’t make many appearances.  Biden is just letting Trump dig his own grave.
You fell for that blatant lie? Biden wants to increase funding for police; specifically for better training.  Rules of thumb: if Fox says it, it's probably wrong. If Trump says it, he's probably guilty of what he's accusing the other person of doing.
Why Joe Biden's so-called 'war on the suburbs' is not a real thing
Perhaps part of your problem is that you can’t distinguish when Trump is engaging in humor and Biden is displaying declining mental faculties.
Motive not clear? 60% of Biden supporters fine with Trump donors losing job, not a far stretch to assume motive here
Obviously his team doesn't even know it.  Biden's campaign is a grizzled retiree on a drifting raft.  I'm impressed at how inventive people are, though.
Yes Bernie Bros.  Definitely say no to Biden so Trump and Barr can gas you morons at your protests.  Most of you will be unemployed and homeless as Trump destroys the working class economy and pisses off our allies but you will have your principles. Sadly, you’ll deserve it.
Biden's campaign is out-raising Trump's right now and Trump is sinking in the polls.  This vaccine would have to garner significant votes.
I mean, the polls direct the popular vote and they weren't wrong in 2016.  Right now, the polls say Biden will likely win the popular vote.
Joe Biden claims he knows how to deal with pandemics. He obviously doesn’t.
During the Obama/Biden administration more than 60 million Americans contracted the swine flu. It would seem that the Trump administration looks like it’s doing an absolutely magnificent job in comparison.
And Joe Biden doesn’t?
The difference is that Joe Biden approves of this behavior while President Trump doesn’t.
But um...Joe Biden approves of this while President Trump doesn’t.Joe Biden is not for universal income.
Joe Biden has not authority to impact current legislation.
Our state senate election is basically minor league Trump v Biden. Hickenlooper is also a hack so there's not really a win here
No, i'm going where the evidence leads, which so far is all in his favor. if you can show some evidence to the contrary, show it. And please leave out hearsay, circumstantial, or indirect evidence, none of those prove guilt, unless you have direct proof to back up the above.
Once trump finds out that Biden VP is going to be a black women. Is trump going to have Pence do blackface with a dress on?
That's why Warren should be Biden's Veep choice.  She'd mop the floor with Pence and never need to raise her voice.
Karen Bass would be a disaster. With her on the ticket, Trump might be able to play his hail mary ‘law and order’ campaign just right enough to squeak through another win. It would be the dumbest thing Biden could do.
I'd vote for a big yellow dog over Trump for POTUS. VP? Who cares?  Conversation about it is just bull session fodder. If Spanky can make news with BS, so can Biden.
Harris calling out Biden during the debates is an argument FOR her to be the Veep … not against.  You need diversity of thought.  And you really need someone who understands what it is like to be both Black and a Woman!!
Oh my my my !!!! The latest in sad Liberal Socialist quantum arguing with those who are real Americans and are tired of Democrats base line to get Biden elected at any cost even utilizing Marxist orgs to do their bidding! Soooo - it’s MAGA TRUMP 2020 onward and upward! HOOORRRRA!
Will Joe Biden be rubbing her shoulders, making the rest of the nation cringe?
A lot of people thinks #Biden is just acting.
Oh jeez, not a Dem version of Sarah Palin - please god, no.  Biden needs to hit this one right down the middle of the fairway.  No wildcards, no surprises.
Not only is Max riding with Biden he’s with Ringo too!! Dump Trump!!
No plan. That's par for the course with this administration.  House hearing finds US no closer to plan as coronavirus is 'raging out of control' – live
I was hoping for a Biden Lance Bottoms ticket. . .
Darn those kids and their rock music!! *shakes fist furiously*  Florida Teen Charged in Twitter Hack of Barack Obama, Joe Biden, Kanye West, Other Prominent Accounts  via
It's fascinating that Biden gets an intelligence briefing, right away tells his people to stop using Tik Tok, then like a week later Trump is like 'Oh $hit! People shouldn't use Tik tok!'
Do your research. Trump is not involved. Also, you haven’t answered my question, What has Joe Biden done for you or anyone for that matter?
Biden v. Trump is Democracy v. fascism.  There, fixed it for you.
Amen brother you as well
You are a clown 🤡 with the fake memes!  He’s talking to YOU about what Biden thinks of all Americans.   Name just one thing Biden has done to help you? 🤔🤔🤔
RBG is a 3 time cancer survivor.  She has metastatic pancreatic ca to her liver.  She's trying to hang on until after 11/3 in hopes that DJT is not re-elected, but Biden will not win w his dementia.  DJT will end up appointing the next jurist on his list, a woman from Indiana.
Pretty sure joe biden doesnt give a flying fuck if you donate to him, that's what the billionaires are for,  and you've already pledged your vote. You have 0 leverage. Good luck with the tantrum though.
Sir, thanks for your mental statistics and cave man logic. Your seismic pronouncements swell the BLUE TIDE. Thank you for proving you are undesirable! Appreciate your strengthening Biden as #46‼️
I'm voting for Biden. I'm voting for America. I'm voting Democrat. I'm voting to save my country.   I will welcome any VP candidate #JoeBiden chooses with open arms.   #WeWillVote
Why Hilton and Other Hotels May Not Like This Joe Biden Tax Proposal
Not. One. Bit.
This is the most important hiring decision he will have to make.  Her qualifications will include strengths and experiences that complement his own.  Biden will work with this person daily, so there must be trust and connection.  He will choose wisely on our behalf.
I was at JLA, the 1980 convention, (volunteer concessions) when Reagan chose Bush.
I know Biden is a few years older than Trump but he is much better health. If Trump can make it through a term, Biden can too. So maybe lets not worry about who the VP pick is that much.
What an asshole. Biden is not defunding the police. This is just one of the reasons why you're losing LYING
Sooo I take it all of Biden’s supporters have really great health care, right?   Because if y’all are expecting expecting major changes regarding affordable........  There’s a bridge in Brooklyn I’d like to sell you!
Biden’s Platform is ending the Rule of Law? And that’s a winner? Are Democrat voters that easily led around by their own blind rage and bruised 2016 egos? Such a simple herd
Counter-argument: Biden’s team is using the VP process to highlight incredible female leaders, some of whom have not had national attention.
Am I the only one that heard him on Stern back then?!
Their “power” goes to their head too much.
Biden will be running on the most progressive platform our party has put forth and I’m so happy about that 💙
I would think Biden's been around the block enough to know that's a bad idea. I have to think it's misdirection.
aka - “He’s not picking who she wants”
So, why doesn't trump put money into mail in voting instead of whining about it. Because their is zero evidence that their is fraud. Joe Biden Biden doesn't mind waiting for his winning results
This is a classic no heroes situation—it’s clear from the way Biden’s team is talking that they hate her in nakedly racist and sexist ways, but also she sucks ass and would be an absolutely insane VP choice
House Democrats subpoena Pompeo for documents on Biden’s son

#DrDeath and his policies are what's killing people, no one is laughing at what is happening you fool   #BidenRepublicans #Biden
😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣😂🤣😂🤣🤣😂 Biden could pick someone no one has ever heard of and it wouldn’t matter... MAJORITY of population want Trump OUT!
No old out of touch white guys are going to keep her from reaching the office she has earned! She is the most qualified candidate and will bring an energy to the ticket that the Dems need not only to elect Biden, but to also down ticket Dems.
Remember when you validated Biden’s accuser? Oh ... I do
This is not an accurate account of the article. It's not saying she'll be disloyal, just distracted by the fact that her own campaign will begin about 2 years into the new Biden administration.

Biden and Michelle Obama would be a steamroller. And yes, I know she has said she has no interest. But a person can dream, no?
We ended up with Trump v Hillary and now Trump v Biden because we've accepted the lesser of two evils paradigm.
A veep candidate with less national ambition could act more freely and more deferentially toward Biden. The “anointed front runner” baggage won’t be as heavy. These advantages could help Biden with his agenda without hurting the party’s prospects in 2024.
And if Biden brought it on himself then so did Kamala.. go look at some of the cases she convicted as AG and tell me she’s any better than Klobuchar...I’ll wait.
Five more Biden press conferences and Trump will be at 75%
A Biden win would make Mexico and Canada to build or finish the wall to keep US Patriots from fleeing our country lol. Many people are already fleeing their liberal cities to safer places. All states will be lawless and the mass tax increase will make America a 3rd world country.
Yup.  Also putting Biden in a tough spot - making it harder for him to NOT pick Harris if he decided he wanted to go a different route.
Kinda like the rupugnants videos of soon to be president Biden ?
Also Ro Khanna was big for Bernie. Sour grapes?
I think some vague stuff is being fomented because tRump and others are most afraid of Kamala as Joe’s running mate. Don’t listen! Don’t boo! Vote!
Can't stand when they do this.

Clyburn to Biden: Put a stop to this shit
Right, I am a witness already in the primary. My wife got a ballot and not a citizen. She has a permanent residency card  that we pay 1000s of dollars to renew it every 10 years. I am glad she did that so if Biden gets elected I am moving to Europe. I was soo mad.
I think of Biden as being...not necessarily chaotic, but not predictable enough to keep up with paladin requirements. Maybe a tanky cleric?
I'm not a Kamala fan and think Warren, Demmings, or Castro would be the better picks but I almost want Biden to pick Harris and put all his old buddies out to pasture just to make a point.   I'm sure he won't, but I'd like to see it.
They hate the truth XDDDDDDDDD I love it i roll around in it like a field of flowers.
Every penny you dont donate to biden you are donating to trump.
also if china keeps screwing around, we might cut them off entirely, and not give them a cent anyway.
Wait, so Trump literally is friends with the horrible people. But then you say Biden is disqualified because he's in the same party as someone associated with the horrible people? Terrific stuff.
at this rate of increase however we will have little trouble repaying the debt.
if joe biden can run from beyond the grave so can our boy
voted for by dems who control the house.
I'm not "justifying" the law is the law, Trump didn't break it, so your opinion on the matter is irrelevant.
well when you lower taxes, and decrease regulations that means more wine, enough wine fills all glasses, that's the entire point of the trick.

facts
Trump is exonerated by the witness in your first doc
Truman, LBJ, Humphrey, Mondale, Gore, Biden: complete this sequence.
I wish Joe Biden was anywhere near as cool as you claim him to be.
The TV doesn't share facts, they push narratives. I get my information from court documents, science papers, and sources with weight, not dipshit talking puppets on tv like a pleb.
New campaign tack: “JOE BIDEN WILL LEAVE AMERICA DANGEROUSLY UNPREPARED FOR A PANDEMIC“
that's in the epstein case, the case where a girl was pressing charges was dropped, no evidence, no record to corroborate the claims, just claims.
again she was legally, and materially a woman. case closed.
Sternis the one saying she's hot, Trump's response is "you have to like freckles though"
The fake libertarian democrat op? no thanks, registered card carrying  libertarian, and i'm voting trump. We had our change with Ron Paul but the libtards blew it, Trump is the next best thing. Above all i will always vote for the most individualist candidate, collectivism sucks.
a few photo ops at expensive public gatherings is not proof Trump diddled kids.
He said it last time and they showed up. We must vote for Biden.
Trump is mentioned by interviewer, witness denies ever seeing trump, and on page two which you didn't post clarifies that the only reason she thought they were friends is because epstein claimed they were.
Trump was mentioned by the interviewer, which the witness denies, read it again
proof of death threats? proof of incident? oh there is none, i've already looked at it, sorry but none of that proves anything, you're just jumping to conclusions that support your spoonfed orange man bad narrative
the only evidence they had any kind of friendship was from Epstein's mouth. Where's the proof he went to the island? Not in the unsealed documents, in fact they suggest the opposite according to an interview with one victim. You can only bring down someone with proof.
he didn't bring her up, listen again. the other guy brought her up, saying she was hot and all this, Trump sounds like he's uncomfortably trying to change subject.
I’m a progressive but Bernie Sanders people make progressives look bad. They honestly embarrass me ...
And Biden hats
Oh please tell me, an actual researcher how to do "research properly" Is it ignoring the record to feed a narrative that supports prior assumptions? because that's what you're doing right now.
Respect is earned not given, and besides that love is a truer virtue than respect which is transient and impersonal. I refuse to elect someone to manage a system on subjective grounds that is stupid, You would do that looking for a wife or a babysitter, not a president.
Overdramatic, Trump was the first to even desire to take action against CV, while Trump was imposing travel bans to infected areas, nancy was promoting trips to chinatown.
decreases in  taxation and regulation freeing up incentivising funds for business.
Biden is a Democrat. If you don't like the job he does, you can vote him out in 4 years. Trump is neither a Dem. nor a Rep. If he wins, there will not be a second chance. The gates of Auschwitz and the swatiska exploding at Nuremberg.
Obama's increases in taxation, and regulation crashed the economy, because that shit stifles small business, and restricts the flow of funds in the market. Happens every time a dem is elected. Only when Trump announced he was running to decrease taxes, and cut regs did it upturn.
Turn off the TV, Trump made his fortune contracting construction of suburbs, the man spawned entire industries, no on one off side projects the left keeps highlighting. Business has a luck factor, trump nets waay into the positive, and the proof is in his bank acct.
Trump is speculating about a Tilden/Hayes type election. But it won't be close. Biden will have +330 EC votes.
cw uspol  God I really hope his criminality catches up with him
Duncan Hunter, not Hunter Biden. Two different people.
you guys are stretching making this about Trump, totally ignoring others who were proven involved. why are you ignoring proof for speculation, because your TV told you to? the same industry that has an employee get arrested for sex crimes every other week?
Enough already! We have to vote for Biden. So his VP is really inconsequential if you wanna keep America a democracy. Irony? Maybe. I prefer Kamala, but in the end, I prefer the slew of legislation to right America that we WON’T GET if we keep bitching about something/anything
They don't because they were dropped with no evidence. and proof he went to the island? The flight logs state he had a few hour connecting flight on one of his planes once on a business trip, no record of minors there either. No where do i see where he made a trip to the island.
For bad people, no. For the rest of us that work hard, and love our families, yes.
Newest polls show Biden leading by 8pts. I truly don’t get it.  Biden clearly is struggling cognitively.  How can he lead against China &amp; Russia or make strong economic decisions? Why would anyone vote for him? #2020Election
i'm supposed to feel sorry for a business who's whole model is scamming people out of money with statistics? as for what he did, his policies got my brother in law an awesome paying job, with bigger wages, got us into a nicer house, got me a raise, rounding up sex traffickers etc
He started this w/ bringing up Abram's name from the get-go, followed by all you listed. It's one Biden item that has disappointed me - AND, I'm voting for Biden and SCOTUS.
Legally she was past the threshold, and listening to this, he was steering the conversation away from her. Sounds like you want to increase age of consent, which I might agree with if you increase voting age along with it.
I don’t see an end in sight. Even if 45 loses this election (swear to God y’all better vote him out), how long will it be before Biden can even change anything?
And, if their desired candidate isn't chosen, what? They won't vote for Biden and SCOTUS?
"Uhhhh  du ud durrr, yu no liek kintens? yu dummy hurr"
No, in the epstein case there are rooms filled with evidence that condemn these guys, except Trump who has been exonerated by witness testimony. It the case against them there was 0 evidence, and charges were dropped.
Indeed. I think all hell will break loose no matter who he chooses. Biden should never have started this ridiculous public 🐎 race.
i condemn those who abused children in clear violation of age of consent, Trump didn't, witness testimony exonerates him.
not according to the law.
just in time for the 2016 election, with no proof, and charges dropped entirely. we have receipts for the other guys you're ignoring to try to make this about Trump. Next.
blind speculation has no value in a battle for truth.
Hick and Bullock never caught on because the voter who wanted a moderate white man decided to stick with Biden. If either had caught on, they would have loved it. And if someone like Harris is running, they're going to step in as moderate white man options again.
There have been thousands of protests. A couple violent acts. Biden condemned the violent protests, including in a statement this week.
I don't "trust" anything, trust is for fools. I voted for him because of his background in business, and making difficult deals, He's a businessman, and that is reflected in the current state of the economy, in spite of covid. The left was saying the economy would never recover
No matter who he chooses, I'm voting for Biden and SCOTUS - just sayin'.
The only ones drawing lines around race are the left.
Despite my numerous phone notifications, I am skeptical of the claim that speculation regarding Biden's VP pick is breaking news worthy of an interruption into my day. If we know who, then sure, that's major news. But theories and speculation - how is that news?
The only thing that matters is who will motivate voters and help Biden win. And the 'playing women off against each other' are sexist and gross.
Florida starts counting mail in ballots early. As do some other states. They actually get counted in FL before ED voting. Biden wins Florida, everything else is moot.
I'm not going to bother to convince a bunch of anti-social posers on here to vote for Biden.
during your debates with trump i need you to say "I've been "Biden" my time!" please do it
Biden supporters like donuts and cops like donuts so Biden supporters is a cop!
I'm voting for Joe Biden in November. I like the Blue Angels and the Thunderbirds and I love the smell of burning jet fuel and afterburner noise.
Can't tell you how many times I've stayed awake at night worrying about what good ol Ed Rendell was thinking. 🙄
"Twitter suffered a major security breach on 15 July that saw hackers take control of the accounts of major public figures and corporations, including Joe Biden, Barack Obama, Elon Musk, Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos and Apple."
Biden was like the squarest Democratic Party candidate in 2008. Like, square man. Not far-out, man.
Generally agree, but I think it matters in this case. Biden has basically said he will be a one-term President and it's not certain he can even fulfill four years. Throw in the BLM movement and the pandemic, which has limited anything Biden has done/said publicly, and it matters.
honestly will not be surprised if Biden’s VP pick is Željko Buvač it’s been that kind of wild year
Trump is going to try and paint Biden supporters as hippies, yippies and anarchists.
Anarchists don't like Democrats let alone Biden. Maybe there's a few out there like a "pragmatic anarchist." Otherwise, anarchists and general hooligans aren't into Biden. Maybe Bernie Sanders or Ron Paul.
Many old African-American Biden supporters go to church every Sunday. Especially in the south. The Sunday go-to-meeting old church ladies in fact.
I'm a Biden supporters and I sit around the house minding my own business and don't even play loud music. I think the rioters, looters and arsonists when they occur are assholes. I don't like cancel culture and I'm into old school country music now.
That is not in any way to diminish the credentials of Karen Bass ... but what does that do for you for an election? It doesn't provide a younger fallback option if Biden cannot complete a term, it doesn't help you win a competitive state(s), and it doesn't have any national buzz.
Biden supporters don't riot or set fire to building. They live quiet lives and shop at Trader Joe's, REI, and Home Depot and do a lot of gardening, home improvement projects, take their dogs for a walk and pet their cats.
People are losing it over the prospects of Biden's VP pick.
I hope this is true. But also plenty of casual voters who are planning to vote Biden and aren't on Twitter are likely planning to drop their ballot in the mail at the deadline. (See: taxes)
Thanks to the predictable idiocy of Ed Rendell and Chris Dodd, the Biden team is going to have one helluva time explaining why they didn't pick Senator Harris if they don't pick Senator Harris.
"2020 Election Live Updates: Trump Administration Continues Attacks on Mail-In Voting" by Unknown Author via NYT
you can feel that way, but it's still not illegal. I don't really care how he "thinks and feel about women" because i'm not a subjective person, my feelings are not my master. I want him to represent this country because he can twist arms and get shit done, and does.
🤣🤣🤣 wow. But when he's talking about crime bills and "predators" he has no issue talking normally. You're just as delusional as Biden.
her only notion of a connection is because "jeffery told [her ]" Jeffry also told a reporter he was connected to Elon Musk which was a total fabrication.
The phrase "not that i can remember" is to shield her from legal perjury. if she said "no" plainly, and it turned out he visited, and it came out later, she could be legally liable. so what we have here is limited to what she's seen, and can remember, being high traffic.
you can read right, the people were fishing for something on Trump, but she made clear he was never on the island, corroborating the flight logs. The crime here isn't knowing epstein, it's sexual abuse of little kids, of which Trump is clearly vindicated.
not even close to a smoking gun, rich people go to expensive parties, it's common knowledge, i would be more surprised if they hadn't been in photos together, further the accusation is whether or not he touched these girls, and he didn't.
Most Americans DGAF what they accept or not, we had Trump for four years - New Yahoo News/YouGov poll: Most Trump voters say they will not accept the 2020 results if Biden wins because of mail-in ballots
keep in mind this a legal adult were are talking about here, a fully developed woman, not a child.
This is nothing compared to epstein and the clintons, Trump was vindicated, and at the end of the day, he might say some crass things, but he didn't break the law.
Biden will make the best decision
Let's go.  Time to stop this once and for all.  Any person who votes for Biden to appease these a$$#0!3$ is an idiot.
Biden is a joke.
I know Biden will make the right decision. What do you think?
Trump IS worse.  You guys are worse with Benghazi, Hillary's emails and Hunter Biden.  Also, 'libtard' shows you to be a #Cult45 member.  If you want to be taken seriously, drop the Qanon rhetoric.
Pompeo hit with subpoena after he’s caught assisting Senate GOP’s political smear of Biden -

America has nothing to do with communism. Socialism is NOT communism. Dems are NOT communists. Biden is not even on the left of the spectrum. Keep spreading your propaganda but it won’t work on educated people.
I'm not scared, he's lost his element of surprise and shock that he enjoyed in 2016.  We're onto him, and more importantly, so are the dems and the Biden campaign.
“Biden may take up to August 10th” !!!!

I like you posted your centrist creds😂 Fellow centrists who agrees with you on Biden. I remember the last few years of Regan’s presidency after he mentally checked out. It was a mess and that’s putting it mildly.

Biden having a stroke
Running on the soul basis of “conservative good/ liberal evil” and “I hate joe Biden” doesn’t make you a good political candidate, It makes you a fear monger. What are your stances on issues, except for on 2nd amendment we all know that one.
"Make due" biden wants to arrest me for my thoughts. I'm going to pass on that fascist thanks.
Hate to be the bearer of bad news but Biden won’t be sympathetic to any attempt to disrupt the status quo. He will just be a friendly face on the same old bullshit.
We could do with less exciting and more maturity.  Biden is our next president.
Don't most states, except for around 8, have at-will employment? It's fantastic that you want more rights for employees! Joe Biden appreciates your vote.
Oh it’ll be longer than that, in either case. Must flip the senate too. My newest nightmare is a Biden victory paired with a republican senate hell bent on making sure the recovery doesn’t happen so they can elect someone else in ‘24.
lol umm, like targeting his political enemies? That fairness? Muller didn't even know what was in his own report! It's like Biden if he wins.
How much is in the pockets of a Biden.
Does he say it’s rigged if he somehow wins?! We have seen act, it’s boring. What’s different this time is how he’s throwing in the towel himself and keeps bringing up that he’s going to lose. LOVE seeing the fear in his eyes.
DT’s sinking at the polls. Sane supporters doubt his ability. He has divided us, cost us many lives, our economy &amp; our Allies. We cannot sit back &amp; “know” he will lose. We must gently embrace Repubs who doubt him. Biden must choose a strong VP. And we must vote as never before.
The original premise was no election, in which no house members would be elected. I absolutely agree that the election will happen. If red states start opting out, then it will just go to Biden who will get a vast majority of however much of the electoral college actually votes.

Biden’s campaign consists of trump making a jackass of himself on a minutely basis. The fewest minutes Joe is in the spotlight the better.
I think they dropped out because they saw they couldn't steal the moderate label from Biden and didn't want Sanders to be the nominee. I don't think a puppetmaster pulled their strings.
I think #SusanRice is the better choice. They have a working history together. She can navigate division intelligently and unify with diplomacy here and abroad. Most importantly, Biden trusts Rice. Our allies do too. She is ready to step in if needed.
I heard the My Pillow guy is making a mattress resembling the sprawl of the Crucifixion, so people don't forget.  Your arms fit right into the slots.  Unless you get the Biden version.  Arm slots like wagon wheels.  It's called 'the good riddance'
There's hundreds of Joe Biden creepy photos even video of him touching girls sniffing girls
Biden’s campaign, just as Hilary’s was, is a sham from a corrupt DNC that has drown out Bernie twice now. Only a slight bump in the road in the timeframe needed to establish a more progressive nation.
My theory is they keep Trump because they find Obama to valuable and he'll be pretty exposed if Biden gets back in as the riots continue
If Biden’s a liberal, then my name is Greg. #BernieScrewedAgain
I think trump is absolute shit but he has a cult following with no real competition on the republican side and a majority of the left doesn’t really feel much for Biden as to his allegations actions and such if only the dems found a better candidate shitty

True! Though it might depend on Biden's class.   Obama is likely an INT or CHA based caster, so I'm assuming Biden is probably melee?
Biden does not utter racial slurs.
This is right on - failure of imagination. She was gambling for a mandate against a GOP congress and couldn't conceive of enough 'deplorables' to give EC to Trump.  Biden will be fine if he balances sincere effort to appeal to all w/ practical focus to assure EC win.
Save it from the catastrophic state Trump is responsible for putting the USA in?  Vote for Joe Biden!!!

It’s not Biden’s tweets that worry me.
Elections are run by states though. I thought  was all about states rights. Imagine red states delaying, blue states voting and putting Biden over the top.

And he was roundly criticized as a promoting a conspiracy and being a nutcase.  We all knew Biden was right. Of course Trump is going to try to void an election he is sure to lose unless the Russians step in and help him and the GOP ratfucks voter registration and voting places.
Protestors not a political ideology like biden did.
Biden listens to scientists on when it will be safe to send the kids to school. Biden doesn’t sniff Lysol and take magic pills to make his decision.
you are so right young lady. Biden forgets where he is half the time. We’re screwed either way
Serious question. Do you think if he loses Nov. 3 he will stay in office until the inauguration? Or will he cut out early?  Regardless, do you think he would go to the inauguration of Joe Biden?
Kamala's record as prosecutor and state AG and her senate record including voting against a 10% military cut a few days ago are FAR more of a problem than her attack on Biden

Biden is clearly in no shape physically or mentally to run. I can’t believe people are content with him as a puppet, I mean candidate.
Well I'm not convinced that Biden wins the election anyway, so I wouldn't be satisfied with a simple loss with a Biden Harris ticket. I'd need to see him win with a different VP pick too.
No. All the moms I know will crawl over glass to vote for Joe Biden. The moms I know stood in line for hours to vote for him in the primary. Kimberly...you are a smart gal(sketchy choice w/ Jr🙄) it is over for DJT. Way too late for over 150,000 families who have lost loved ones.
