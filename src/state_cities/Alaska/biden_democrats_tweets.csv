Every metric will be abused. Liking someone as a person  doesn't mean you think they, or the policies they represent, will be good for an important job. (In long run perspective, Hillary's was in the stratosphere. Biden's is merely awfully high, as is Trump's.)
Devin Nunes refuses to admit that he received a package from Ukraine designed to smear Joe Biden.
Apparently, Biden locking up record numbers of POC with his crime bill was "for their own good" according to Karen here
I was going to make up my mind on who to vote for in October but as a single-issue email voter, I'm going to have to go Biden.
I have a similar situation, but I'd say I had far more friends on the left than right. But, I've seen a lot of those on the left (particularly 2016 Bernie fans) turn into big Trump supporters. Nobody talks about Biden unless they are making a sniffing joke.
Trying to re-elect Babyhands, of course. Biden is the guy who needs to worry about Russian interference.
I would gladly move up inauguration date. The way to achieve this is for Pence to resign after the election, he names Biden VP, and then he resigns.
lol   There she is folks...she's yelling,  'look ay me, Joe Biden!  Over here!  Over here, Joe!  Me! Me! Pick me, Joe!   meeeeeeeeee! waaaaaaaaa! waaaaaa!   lol  What a piece of work  lol
VP Biden is CORRECT: You have FAILED MISERABLY! #trumpresignnow
because China inprisoning people killing them for organs to sell around the world especially here in the United States all brought to you by the Democratic Party and Joe Biden wake up America the Democratic Party coruption is nobodies friend all they care about is money and power
You are right! President Trump is terrified of the damage Joe Biden (Obama really) will do if elected. Quite frankly, so am I and a majority of Americans! What is even more scary is whom ever he chooses as VP running mate. Whom ever it is will take this country extremely far left
Funny! Joe Hiden Biden probably thinks tweet(y) is a bird!
I’ll take every cent and still vote for Biden.
There is no tweeting allowed for Moneypockets Joe Biden in his BLM prison.  Joe's mummy will be seeking re-election in 2024 from his BLM grave.  Hillary as V-P.
Hmm. I guess maybe Biden and the media know tRump better than you.
She has the two most important qualifications I'm looking for in the next president: #1: Not Trump. #2 Not Biden.   So, yeah. I'm in. (But I'd vote for you over her).
For the record, Joe Biden could choose a kumquat as his running mate, and it wouldn’t affect my vote in the slightest.
Better talk to Biden! He's your guy!
No you’re not unless you cheat like you did in 2016. Polls show that Joe Biden is way ahead of you. Is this why you keep calling your puppet master Putin and cry to him. You’re extremely nuts and a total tool bag and you have screwed this country that people hate you. RESIGN!!!!!
When's the last time you heard anyone say Biden 2020?
To ALL MSM &amp; cable 'news' : assuming Biden wins &amp; somehow 'THING' escapes prison afterward, Ah don't think any of us that are interested in watching real news, and actually buy products from advertisers will want to see &amp; hear a FUCKING THING that the 'THING' has to 'say'. SHUN.
Do they think? ... The left don't.
Jill Biden
Sadly, I don’t see it happening. I wouldn’t put it past Biden to forgive Trump all his transgressions “in the interest of unity” ala President Ford and Nixon
No mining? No renewable energy. The impact of a Biden win on oil &amp; gas.
When Moscow Mitch rejects Trump's nonsense, you know it's some next-level nonsense!
President Donald Trump and his Democratic challenger, Joe Biden, both promise sweeping progress over the next four years — via starkly different paths.
Democrats and the Republicans have been sitting on their hands to long supporting the rich now the tables have turned dont think for a minute the country will heed to Joe Biden because he is Elected Remember what is really going on with the Protestors
Via the extra $600 UI, our US govt is printing more money daily and distributing  it to Biden voters who are burning and looting their way to the November election  #UBI
Hey Putin, Biden is not going to put up with your shit!
I will support whoever Biden picks. Kamala Harris has many good qualities. But personally, I'd like Karen Bass or Elizabeth Warren more. And Elizabeth Warren has seen her share of sexist treatment during the presidential primary.
Just because some of Biden's supporters don't favor Kamala Harris doesn't mean they are anti-female. What about choosing Elizabeth Warren, Susan Rice, Karen Bass, Stacey Abrams, etc.? You shouldn't propagate strawmen arguments.
That's not the issue. Joe Biden is committed to choosing a woman VP. There are a large number of potentially good choices. Some people are acting like it's Kamala Harris or nothing. What about Elizabeth Warren? Susan Rice? Karen Bass?
They are just preparing for when Biden wins and they have to pretend to care about the national debt again
I've worked in my husband's neurology practice and saw *many times* the same behaviors in his patients who had dementia. My MIL has alzheimers. When you see it in people you know, it's recognizable in other situations. Biden surely has the onset of dementia.
Joe Biden?  Did you mean the president?
How is Joe Biden picking court nominees for
Letters to the Editor: If Joe Biden picks Karen Bass as his VP, L.A.'s major loss would be America's gain
Those aren't Karens. They're your momma. There are thousands of different women named Karen. Your memes are stupid. Hopefully, this Karen will be our next VP.
This is up there with "how come Biden only wears a mask in public, not when he's filming a speech in his house?" in terms of coherent arguments.
I'll take lackluster Biden over shrill, cuckoo Trump any day: Trump's shortcomings make weak opponent Biden look strong  #Biden #Election2020
Joe Biden equals death, when it comes to the Environment. We need to use force if we are going to make lasting change. The 1% don’t seem to give a shit about melting the Earth. So, stop advocating for supporting the 1%//Biden.
Putting your hope in Joe Biden is foolish, Brother West. We’re not going to make any headway by kissing Corporate Ass. 🤨
Still trying to get me to vote for Biden. Nope, not happening.
I identify as center-left leaning, to your surprise. I strongly believe Biden is what America needs.   Though, I am extremely disappointed with the far left and many so called 'progressives.' The actions I've seen will no doubt move many centrists further right.
Trump 2020 and beyond only trump and the American citizens in November will say and it won’t be your Biden it will be a true American and that is our president trump win in a landslide
You sold out conservatives to big tech for a new house you’re no different than Biden or Bernie Sanders.
We’ll get four out for the vote of Biden in November.  #effecient
President Donald Trump is painting a dystopian portrait of what Joe Biden’s America might look like, asserting crime and chaos would ravage communities should the former vice president win the White House in November.
I was shocked that even Biden, in his Build Back Better speech Tuesday, referred to a trump change in tone.  To me, if there is any change in trump’s “tone”, it is a result of being tone deaf.
Yup I will when me and my family cast our vote for Joe Biden to help get rid of the crap hole we have now in the White House.
I may be a troll, but I'm an *American* troll. 😎  All the Putin/QAnon/MAGA/Communist/Scientologist trolls and cyberbullies can go fck themselves. ✊  We have to get Joe Biden into the White House ASAP- the United States and democracy depend on it! 🗽
Is this what Joe Biden said at a rally today? That man is losing his mind.
Yes! Susan Rice! That's my pick. She's foreign policy savvy, will allow Biden to concentrate on domestic issues, won't outshine the candidate and has virtually no baggage. Fingers crossed!Other choices are needed in the Senate &amp; Cabinet.
We shall—when President Joe Biden takes office! #Biden2020  #JoeBiden2020
No.  Biden’s VP pick should be a black woman.  Full. Stop.  Make no mistake he wouldn’t be the nominee if weren’t for black women in S.C.
It’s amazing how much assumption there is that Biden will be a one term president
I love my country. He loves my country. Democrats hate my country. Also I don’t have any idea who will be the president if Biden gets elected. Not that it would matter. 🇺🇸
Here’s a little summary of why I support our president and not DEEP STATE Joe Biden.
Biden showed COURAGE in face of physical disability of 'stuttering' to DELIVER speech and Q &amp;A session magnificently. Made anything 'THING' has EVER said on camera look like rambling utterances of 10 year old stupid unintelligent bully that needs their ass kicked on playground.
Biden: 7/10 Biden with Rice: 10/10
Joe Biden’s press conference is hard to watch. He had the questions in advance, but he still can’t provide a coherent answer. 🤦‍♂️ #Trump2020Landslide 🇺🇸
Unlike u obsessed folks who don't do their jobs but waste time &amp; money attacking Mr Trump as you've done for 4yrs. AG Barr is a very busy man...perhaps we should ask if he reads tweets of real criminals like HRC, Comey, Strozk, Hunter Biden, Pelosi et al grow up
lolololol   and if cows could fly  and Mr Biden could ad lib without help and if the FBI were honest and if the media weren't 92% anti Trump and If Obama were truly black and not clinically defined as a 'mulatto….dream on broomstick cowboys! BTW where is Joe?  lol
Lmao!!! Nina Turner is so awesome!!!
The Indigenous people of North America need to stop dealing with these racist, Ignoring us completely Don't vote for Biden let these white folks sort each other out
Where's Hiden Biden? Crickets. Now there's a fine example of dementia. I actually feel sorry for him being used as a tool by the Dems.
Biden will never get voted in if you fucks keep this up with natives they will vote trump in
are fucken Racist and America know when you fucken ignore this protest happening wont end when Biden gets in Office your party is after trumps
Cool story. So, Biden wins and guess who still has a job? The guys that did the stuff you're upset about. They worked for Obama too. On the bright side, full retirement at age 57. So those that joined under GW Bush are set to retire any day now.
She also asked for Biden’s &amp; Fauci’s ACTUAL piss. She wants them to send her their URINE so she can prove they don’t take it. Let me say this again. SHE WANTS THEM TO SEND HER URINE. I can’t anymore.
"Storm troopers"? Is that what you said Jan 2009-2017? Is that what you will say if Biden wins? Same people, same job. If a right wing vet gets in their face and pulls the same stunt will you cheer?
I just hope we can all look at the biggest issue right now - getting rid of Trump. I liked Buttigieg and Warren a lot but even during the Primary I wasn’t going all in for anyone emotionally because I wanted to support whoever won. Biden isn’t perfect. But he can dump Trump.
I’m Ridin’ with Biden. And love Pete.
neither here nor there but I don't think there's even a political left right now. Biden isn't some unreasonable communist that's pushing people toward trump, Biden is the middle.
I’d be embarrassed to put Biden on my truck too. That’s a big commitment and a big vote of confidence.
Funny how she's not running for office.  Next, you'll say you saw a video with KKK  supporting Biden, right?
Vote for Biden!
Vote yes Biden!
This must not happen!
You mean the cages that Obama and Biden created...
Biden supporters are the Trump supporters of the left. Where are the moderates?
This is the current lefty spank fantasy. The hilarious thing? If Biden does win the same guys you hate will still be doing the same job.
I'm very willing to take the largest fucking L for saying that biden couldn't beat trump, because honestly it's looking more and more likely every day that hes gonna win by a landslide victory in November lmfaooo, sorry 🌹twitter
Hey  here is the truth since the  move their convention from Milwaukee to hell.  My prediction is that  nominee will be replace by  #Election2020 #Biden #Democratic
That’s right!! Biden would never allow soldiers to be targeted by Putin! Or allow Russia to interfere in our elections! Biden would never call out soldiers against his own people! Let alone this kind!
Just 31% of Biden supporters say they're excited, compared with 42% of Trump supporters. Story:
WHY  she's only going to be there for 99 days..   Maybe  is sprucing it up for Dr. Jill Biden.
Stop being suckered by Biden. Christ on a cracker, he’s not moving left. He’s faking left for votes. 🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄
Can Biden have OBAMA as VP ?. Please
The simple truth is that this situation has gone beyond the point where voting can mitigate the damage-  Voting alone can't heal this nation.  The sooner  vacates the White House and we install Joe Biden as our President... the better.   Impeach him, again? 🙏🗽✊
Why do we have to "vote" for Joe Biden to release children from cages?   Why not free them NOW?   Why hasn't anyone freed these children BEFORE covid-19, BEFORE impeachment?   Democrats want our votes for doing alot of talking, yet doing almost nothing.  Action over talk NOW!✊😡
Biden wins the FEMA camps will be full and guillotines needing sharpening
Biden has had three strokes, it is like elder abuse having him as a candidate for presidency
Biden's path to the White House could hit a dead end on Facebook
Keep investing in that idea.  Tell Biden to go all in supporting anarchy.
I’m so confused. WHO is matching money? Like I don’t get that..maybe there is an obvious answer to this but I don’t get it lol- my Biden text literally said ‘could you please chip in even a few dollars’ which was less aggressive than this 😂
Well they need to get the devil out of the Whitehouse! I hope they see that. At least people can work with Biden! You are an evil man!
Lady was tryna say that's what's gonna happen if Biden is elected as if neo-nazis don't support Trump lol
Most Republicans in general are Joe Biden supporters
That's when Biden will change his tune and come out against it, too  Of course, we won't really be sure that's what he's saying, due to the confused ramblings and offensive gaffes, but we'll be assured that's what he meant
Gawd, is that the Biden Bill he doesn't regret any part of?
On the other hand, should Biden lose and there are lots of missing mail-in ballots and evidence of hacked voting machines, should he not challenge the results?
Biden will NOT Defund the Police.  Trump is Lying... AGAIN.
Isn't it nice that Biden (being a real man) can say "my bad" that was the right thing to do.
-“But do we agree that we can redirect some of the [police] funding?” Barkan asked Biden. -“Yes, absolutely,” said the former vice president. Biden went on to call for police reforms.  Seems “redirecting funds” doesn’t mean  “defund.” As evidence by folks leaving dem cities.
Florida breaks COVID-19 record with 872 deaths reported in one week; nearly 424K infected to date    So why would ANYONE in Florida vote for Trump?  Why should this state even be in play during the election?   Shouldn't the vote be 99.9%/Biden?  🤔🤔🤔
Hell yes, voting for Biden because Trump is destroying our Country.
Please, everyone in Ohio ,  vote for Biden.     does not know what he is doing.  I'm sure you are all smart enough to see this.
Trump was the only one that shut down travel but Biden cryed said no keep it opon pelosi said come down to China town como sent sick people back to nursing homes to kill the old and you people are the enemy to the citizens of the United States of America for doing treasonous acts
No.   Because I want Joe Biden to defund the police- they are trash.  Police are the Gestapo of the United States. Most of them are either loyal to Trump or loyal to bigotry- they're loyal to the abuse of power and violence that goes with it.  Fck the police.  #DefundThePolice ✊
There cannot be a better reason to vote for VP Biden!
Thanks, I’m honored. Lacking first hand knowledge, I have read reports addressing this particular point in detail. Trump and his crew are making many outlandish accusations about Biden somehow destroying the country without anything but their opinion to back it up.
Biden doesn’t support defunding the police, he supports improving them. If you are going to attack, don’t take trump’s word on anything.
Biden said he wants suberia to be the hell holes of Demorat cities. I am positive sure all the people love that thought.
Massive Biden crowd.
Still? What would change our minds? Trump’s “lucidity” test? As we know, he’s batshit crazy. Ridin’ With Biden!
President Joe Biden NOW! ✊🙏
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
Voting against Trump is more important than ever! If you think Biden is a landslide by the press, the only way that will be true is you have to vote for Biden, let's not repeat what happened 4 years ago!
Copy and paste this text and tweet it:  JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
Copy and paste this text and tweet it:  JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
The sooner Joe Biden is in the White House, the better. We have to get Joe in there ASAP. The United States cannot take 4 more months of this madness!  4 more DAYS of Trump and his MAGA cult is unbearable as is... 💔
Please retweet.  JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
Yup, the Murdochs donate heavily to Biden.  The establishment needs to be broken and Trump is well on his way. We live in an amazing time really, politically/scientifically/technologically. I personally think this election will have fundamental ramifications for years to come.
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
What will he do when Biden allows renters (who might have swarthy complexions) to move into the burbs?
Portland is the result of liberals being in full control.  Cater to the crazy, tell the normal citizens they deserve no protection.  Ban ability to help restore order.  will unfortunately have these types setting the national policy.  The younger Biden would stop this.
"Romney has no plans to vote for Donald Trump this fall, he’s not voting for Biden either, choosing instead to write in the name of his wife ... So, it’s really a vote for Trump."  Romney's no Saint.  He's a dangerous Politician &amp; playing political Chess.
A friend of mine I  saw a couple weeks ago said she was going to write in Mickey Mouse or something.  I said well then you’re voting for Trump. She said oh no. I said oh yeah, if you don’t vote for Biden you’re voting for Trump. She lives in AZ, by the way.
I hear no Democratic leaders or Joe Biden talking about this because they also are behind this
I echo the Benghazi concern. Repubs will have a Field Day replaying all the footage.  Highly qualified, but may cost Biden the election.
I wish Kamal Harris won the nomination. Biden has his pros and cons, but he’s a career politician, with a million pounds of baggage RNC will make a buffet of. This is going to be a sloppy, nearly violent amount of ads and hand wringing.
At least under Trump he’d get richer probably.  If we still have a country, and not ww3 of course. Biden has a lot of flaws that turn ppl off. He’s a trillion times better than Trump, but still vulnerable af to cheap attacks.
at first Carville wanted Biden to win now his stance changed because the truth is coming out about Congress
I believe this will keep going on because Congress is just sitting on the sidelines till the elections and thats not good at all for politicians even if Biden makes it into office AMERICA is tired and these news medias make this worse by wanting this
Good luck finding too much dirt on Biden.
Americans are tired of the same old bullshit Congress have done to the country and the taxpayers and Immigrants we are near a civil war I believe this will keep going even if Biden makes it into Office just because you voted him in this will stop
Fox news poll shows Joe Biden with a significant lead over Donald Trump in battleground states.
She stands for every Progressive Policy I’m for andopposed the extension of the Patriot Act. What She needs are Comrades.  I’m assuming that to get what we want, we’re going to have to fight for it by force.  Biden, Trump, Pelosi, McConnell, and Schumer are not going to help us.
Biden should be in a nursing home
Exactly how my family felt when my Neice ran into Joe when she was working at ski resort.  JOE called my sister, not once but twice.  Joe knew my sister was a fan and was not going to settle for leaving  her a voicemail message.  He is the best!  Biden Yeah in November!
Like Biden?
If somehow Biden is clearly the winner - even with a landslide victory - the Regime will contest it. They're already cooking up schemes to show "rampant voter fraud in these _______________ states." This is a no-brainer. The coup has already happened.
I'm not picking on this guy in particular, but the whole "I'm the expert on X state because I live here and haven't seen any Biden signs" is really bad.
Do you sniff him like Biden?
STOP WITH YOUR LIES BIDEN! YOU WILL NOT WIN
Let me guess. You’re registered to vote in Russian “elections.” I can understand people not liking Biden. Can you understand Trump is a dangerous sociopath beholden to your “president?”
They’re running the same old losing candidate again. That’s what I fear. He’s ran and lost many times for President. Cross our fingers and keep the outreach at least we won’t have trump. Biden is better than trump that’s for sure.
I almost worry that they purposely do this so we don’t continue our outreach. Hilary left out the most important places bcuz she underestimated trump. I hope Biden understands this. I’ll vote for biden but ugh. I fear this won’t end well.
TruthRuthie is trying without success to question Biden’s honesty and morals. She’s supporting Tara Reade’s slimy attempt to hurt Biden.
What are the inappropriate comments while he’s on stage doing what any grandparent does - touches her shoulder and says hello. Meanwhile, you’re defending someone who drools over Putin’s (flabby) bare chest and promises Bernie she’ll hurt Biden. You believe liars, Truthie Ruthie?
Also even according to that metaphor, Biden's refusal to support M4A is the equivalent of refusing to sell a cramped, moldy starter house in favor of a cheaper and way nicer home because they're too stubborn to admit that their starter home was a POS
If Biden’s running mate isn’t Harris or Duckworth, I will officially be a sad cookie
Lest we forget ~ Here's a reminder: 👇👇👇 "The Trump White House disbanded the National Security Council’s office overseeing responses to pandemics in 2018." #TrumpKillsUs  #Covid_19  #TrumpVirusCatastrophe
Obama was weak on Russia - IMHO. Biden ISN'T OBAMA.  Trump STILL DENIES Russian interference in our election (see Chris Wallace interview) AND he does Nothing while Russia pays Bounties on the deaths US soldiers!  Why support someone who's obviously in Putin's pocket?!
Here's the decision: Vote tRUMP for continued corruption, lies, denials, alienation of our Allies, and Russian interference ~  OR  Vote Biden to restore Constitutional law, Honesty, Integrity, a unified Pandemic Response Plan and a foreign policy that doesn't cater to Russia.
That's ok President Biden will restore America.
The reams of proposals reflect Biden’s belief that the nation faces immense challenges that require a far-reaching government response not seen since the New Deal.
Joe Biden wants to address health care disparities, toughen gun control, overhaul policing, provide free community college, erase student loan debt, invest in green energy and improve the nation's infrastructure.
Read it (or have someone read it to you) and WEEP, Fat Boy!
Lest we forget ~ Here's a reminder: 👇👇👇 "The Trump White House disbanded the National Security Council’s office overseeing responses to pandemics in 2018." #TrumpKillsUs  #Covid_19  #TrumpVirusCatastrophe
Does Biden want to be president or just enjoy nurses breathing in his nose for 4 years?
I hope that Chris Wallace is equally hard on Biden, as he was on President Trump.
Yeah, me too. Biden is smart, ethical and compassionate. It will be refreshing.
He just keeps writing Biden's campaign ads.
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣  I am a Suburban Housewife in America.  Joe Biden will restore honor, integrity, compassion and competency to the office of the Presidency.  All Republicans will be voted OUT!  #JoeBiden  #JoeBiden2020
Right, only an utter idiot would vote for Beijing Biden....then watch as he ships all manufacturing and other jobs overseas!!
You dumb ass Jimmy Dore Motherfuckers need to take a Civics Class. UBI and M4A will not come close to passing with Trump (or Biden) as POTUS, nor with a GOP controlled Senate with McConnell as leader. Wake the fuck up and get more real Progressives elected!
In new video Joe Biden and Barack Obama discuss how they would do a much better job of handling our current crises than Donald Trump.
2 months ago: DURRHURRR Biden looks so dumb in a mask! 2 weeks ago: It is very patriotic for Trump to wear a mask.  2 months ago: DURRHURR Dems are canceling their convention, what losers! 2 hours ago:
Biden out here pandering to dog lovers. Well, it worked because I actually opened that email.
I like that the main GOP strategy right now is broadcasting horror images of “Biden’s America” that are pulled from current Trump’s America.   They’ve already given up on Trump and are already shifting blame on Biden.   Wild stuff.
No trump signs, a few pick up trucks boldly flying giant US flags, sporting 2016 bumper stickers. Good time for Biden adds
Biden's education plan would level death blow to private and religious colleges
Biden holds 13-point lead over Trump in Florida: poll
Will Biden lead from the WH or from an assisted living nursing home? Why R none of u talking about the TWO IG reports PROVING Gen Flynn was framed &amp; Mr Trump was target of a coup by media, certain FBI, Obama admin. Ben Arnold now is Dem Party. shame on u all
Think Biden could do it? Full disclosure, not sure I could. I forget unnecessary details easily. Pass a test in college and forget it all after turning it in
Agreed, Cheri 100%!!  The 3 million that Biden is talking about would be low to medium wage earners....he wants to displace high wage earners with his war on energy and manufacturing!
Exactly, Cheri, and if I may add...the economy, under President Trump, will be able to support the wage increase...for everyone.  Under Biden, wage increase for only a few will make healthcare un-affordable for the majority!
Amen, Cheri!!  Biden - further indoctrination of the youth...at even an earlier age! The American people will not stand for this!
Great and tremendous points!!  Truth backed up by facts!!  President Trump - Law and order, America first; Biden - Lawlessness and globalism (America last)!
Exactly!!  Let the debates begin...part of the "normal" American presidential election process!  That way Beijing Biden will be displayed for the incompetent fraud he is!  Get the popcorn ready....
13 times Joe Biden used the N-word #BlackLives don't matter to him ... Only black votes
BEST BIDEN CAMPAIGN AD EVAH!!!!!
The meeting shown in the video illustrates the larger role Obama is expected to play for Biden in the months before November.
And Biden isn’t?
I finally saw some Biden signs. That’s the tweet.
Y is biden n obama lying so much???
That’s Trumpian AF. On a positive note, I saw a couple of Biden signs this morning.
Seems more lies n B S. coming from biden/obama camp
Climate scientists are very impressed by Joe Biden's plan to make electricity 100% clean by 2035.
Big papa Joe Biden 46th President of the United States. Successor to impeached failed 45th president Donald J Trump Trump was defeated in a landslide victory.
Biden is going to be faced with a monumental clean up task when he gets into office. Even a very average president is going to be so much better than what we've had. And many, MANY things will be better.
Name on thing he’s done for any American that doesn’t have the jade name if Biden
Yes, China would love to see Joe Biden, or really any adult person in charge.
Sure because Trump caused the Coronavirus and the economy won't go bankrupt with Biden as President.
I doubt he took it.  Just the main talking point about Biden “not knowing he’s alive”.
You or trump don't let reporters ask real question, Biden isn't president yet !!!
“There was no racism in America until Trump showed up” - This guy apparently. Biden thinks voters are f’ing morons.
Democrat Native Alaskan’s, for BIDEN! Thank you President Obama it was great hosting you at HCC! I miss you!
I am never going to get over the fact that out of the millions of people that could have been chosen to be president, we are left with Cheeto man and feely hands Biden. Unbelievable. Just dumb.
Does it seem biden pelosi schumer tell alot of LIES or is it just me?
Omg what a shit hole country this would be if police did that!   Heckin Biden!!! We should vert for Trump to bcome president for 2020, that way, he can unphuck everythang Biden is messing Up!!
C'mon Boris.... Do better, this is right now...... TODAY! Joe Biden has nothing to do with what's going on right now....
Can Biden please stfu for 100 days?
And they have the nerve to criticize Biden.
