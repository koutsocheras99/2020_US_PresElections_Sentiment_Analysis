Oh, I’m so, so relieved. Trump, Barr, Congressional Republicans, the conservative Supreme Court would NEVER skirt the law or Constitution. I can sleep easy. Good night, Bambi.
Thanks trump!
You started the “retired” bit. Yeah, I play poker. I watch for guys who don’t play by the rules, like Trump. And I’m hardly in hysterics — just pointing out naïveté when I see it. “Marines landing on the White House lawn to take him away in cuffs.” LOL.
Reading comprehension problems, kid? No predictions. But when Trump floats the idea &amp; Pompeo says it’s Barr’s call, &amp; Barr says the election is being rigged, all in a a 24 hour news cycle, you better think about it. Unless you’re the mark.
Why does asshole tRump keep lying about vote by mail?? Piece of shit!
Sorry if I disturbed your fantasy of the cavalry coming over the hill to save the day.  Not making predictions, just saying you children are hopelessly naive if you’re not thinking about this shit. Trusting Trump &amp; Barr to play by the rules makes you the mark at the table, son.
And the Biden ads say Pres Trump is the most divisive President in history - I don’t think so
So when will you hold the Trump administration accountable?
President Trump, You need to go to Herman Cains’s funeral
Yeah, yeah, until Trump takes you golfing again.
Voting for Trump, because he's NOT a politician!!

Wake Up  via  #trump #DumpTrump #DumpTrump2020 #WakeUpAmerica
More Zyrump stealing directly from taxpayers. Trump thdd Ed cRipper attacks against!
Many are in these comments. I’m responding to the legion of people in these comments saying ‘don’t worry, it can’t happen, the Constitution says he can’t do that.’ They apparently have great confidence Trump &amp; Barr will follow the law. Me, not so much.
(They donated to trump so keep the streak bro)
You envision that being a nice, bipartisan resolution?Or will the GOP minority hit the airwaves denouncing the “coup,” backing Trump &amp; Barr, supporting the storm troopers who surround the White House, demanding the Generals not intervene in this Constitutional dispute.Gets messy.
Trump should be impeached for calling out to illegally delay an election he can’t win. That is a direct attack on the First Amendment - Free Speech!
Trump is paying himself more than that.Has 2 family members on Parscale's payroll to disguise it.
You assume: 1) it’s clear to military Biden is CiC; Barr will issue multiple legal opinions saying opposite;   2) Congress GOP won’t further enable Trump. 3) military will attack rather than let courts decide; 4) Biden will issue order initiating combat &amp;casualties on WH grounds.
I hate the take of “it’s too late to join the fight against Trump because you’re only saving face”  No. We desperately need to defeat Trump and I’ll take help from anyone. It doesn’t eliminate past complicity, but let’s  open up the anti-Trump tent to anyone who will come.
No, you and any others will not be able to stop the Trump Tsunami!
I’ll be there with bells on! The Constitution says that is the legal way to remove a president stupid enough to refuse to leave.!?Unfirtunately Trump  is desecrating the White House interior as we speak. He should be removed along with the leeching crime family.
Well his campaign platform consists of "I'm not trump" and...thats all i can think of.
Tucker Carlson is suddenly concerned about politesse. Please, no one tell him the things that Trump has said over the last five years. He might need a fainting couch.
And if Trump refuses to leave, &amp; Barr supports him with storm troopers defending the White House, you’ll go explain it to them, right?
i could be convinced trump is intentionally undermining the legitimacy of the constitutional government in order to protect his own ego, and I'll concede it's an alpha move...  BBC News - Republicans to Trump: You can't delay 2020 election
Please let Trump express his thoughts.He is Biden’s best campaign strategy.
The military are honorable &amp; will do the right thing, but there are practicalities. If GOP state officials refuse to certify results, Barr supports Trump w/ legal opinions, &amp; Homeland Sec storm troopers mobilize? Don’t count on military to conduct an assault on the White House.
You are right, he will have no further legal authority. But Trump already flouts the Constitution. So if Trump just says “so what?” You think Nancy &amp; Joe will just part Barr’s storm troopers like Moses &amp; Red Sea? If Justice, Homeland Sec, &amp; Congress GOP back him, we have a mess.
Bo could beat trump in a debate.
With the increased noise about voting by mail, we can turn to  to explore the ludicrousness of Trump's position, that this multi-step, multi-felony process generating one purloined vote could impact the election. #VoteByMail #VoteByMail2020
You think Nancy can part Barr’s storm troopers like Moses &amp; the Red Sea? If Trump refuses to leave &amp; Barr / Homeland Security goons back his play, we’ve got trouble. You think GOP Senators will do anything other than enable? Even if the Supremes weigh in, they can’t enforce.
Trump’s America?  Really Matt?
A Seth indicates, that won’t matter to Trump. GOP state election officials don’t certify the results, Trump doesn’t leave, Barr backs him with spurious legal opinions, &amp; Barr’s storm troopers mobilize. GOP Senators enable, as usual. What then? Seth’s hypothetical is plausible.
No. Like you said, it has to go through Congress and to Trump first. But the Constitution also mandates that the new Congress must be sworn in on Jan. 3, and that the new president’s term must begin on Jan. 20. Those dates can’t be changed by normal legislation. (It’s impossible)
Trump's school re-opening will be just as disastrous as his economic re-opening.  We are in for some bad times before Biden takes office in January.  It now feels like July 1932.
Get your own Senators lined up &amp; then start begging. Remove Trump’s self serving get rich off America plans for a new FBI building near his hotel. For Christ Sake, Americans will be homeless &amp; starving while you make Trump a billionaire. #FMcConnell
Trump puts his spin on junk that has happened in the past. Repeats it week after week, month after month. He never updates us on plans or progress on correcting all requirements this country has needed to get through pandemic &amp; open safely. Fails every Fing day.
If Trump wins, what are the chances that he forces states that voted for Biden to nominate one boy and one girl between the ages of 12 and 18 to battle to the death in an elaborate arena as a form of penance?
As president I would love to see you pick AG Hillary ClintonHandling the prosecution of crimes committed by the Trump crime family. poetic justice. Just sayin.
Maybe Trump will do his eulogy.

I kind of wish you wouldn’t have mentioned that. I now have this vision of Trump gutting this just before a massive nuclear accident.
Correction: Pompeo just testified  under oath that he does not care about the constitution or democracy (which is pretty much like everyone else in the Trump administration).
He told his father he would 'take care of Trump'.
You must denounce Trumps mention of postponing the election! To not do so shows you support this ludicrous suggestion.  Be careful as you are about to be forever chained to Trump  as he’s about to be voted out November 3rd 2020!  Remember the RICO act!
You said Trump would win, or did you conveniently forget that?
Well, I think we're headed for a shooting civil war over this.  I believe Trump will win, and before midnight on November 2, our cities will start to burn.  Will vets and Oath Keepers act when that happens?  Or will I be busy bugging out with my family in order to avoid death?

Amazing! It appears Trump finally crossed the line with his delayed election tweet. Republicans are finding their spines and speaking out. Must've had a powwow first to see if it was permissible.
Patrick, don’t worry. Bacon will get re-elected, Trump will get re-elected, Eastman will go back to selling Amway or whatever she does and the economy is going to be just fine. 🙂
How bout some word's for Obama's great speech Britt??  are you afraid Trump will tweet at you and be mad?

Whereas America under Trump...  Need the public to wear a little piece of cloth and stay a few feet apart for a little while to stop a plague.  FUCK NO!
The "Trump's Tweets are Deflections. Keep Your Eye on the Ball SHEEPLE!" takes are a little exhausted.  Of course, he's creating force for his preferred frame. That's called communication.
We can hold multiple truths at one time:  1. Trump's tweet is reflecting a fascist reality without elections and   2. Deflecting a reality where the economy has shrunk, in part, due to his failed COVID response.
It is sad.  It’s sad that he did this to himself.  It’s sad he called COVID a hoax.  It’s sad he traded his life so he could kiss trump’s ass.  It’s sad that he used his position of power to deny science.  The science that killed him.    It’s all very sad.
No need to tell Trump that, as a president he should’ve memorized what the US constitution stands for.
To be clear, I am specifically referring to people INSIDE the administration. As in, they won't work in the White House or DC when Trump is gone. If they work regardless of who is president they aren't included. I feel absolutely awful for those people.
Now we only need to worry about the internal destruction of the USPS by the trump administration.
Are you honestly pimping for the antichrist? trump embodies the seven deadly sins.  Have you even read the New Testament?
He told people not to weak masks because COVID was a hoax.  And then he died, from COVID.   He could have helped people.  He chose to kiss trump’s ass.   Take a seat dear.
trump uses EVERYONE as a prop. Right now we have over 150,000 dead because the moron greedy grifter and traitor in charge doesn’t like how he looks in a mask and knows it will mess up his make up. Worst leadership in the world. Sorry anyone has to suffer for

A top journalistic construction of era is the "It was not clear from Trump's tweet whether ..." efforts to make sense of his stupider bursts of,well,stupidity,as if he's not just tweeting out his ass half the time &amp; we don't know it'll be followed by something like "DEMON SPERM!"
I feel this is trump’s version of “Wabbit season/duck season“; he just doesn’t know that he’s Daffy Duck.
Herman Cain attended the Trump rally in Tulsa, contracted #COVID19, and has died. Trump, before news could circulate, tweeted to suggest that we should postpone the election. We're headed for the most dangerous 6 mos in a century, and the man in charge doesn't care who gets hurt.
So does Putin’s killer  Lao dog Trump...
Just so we're clear: Trump doesn't have the authority to delay the election. Just another tally mark added to the long list of dumbass unconstitutional shit he's done or tried to do,

I feel that. I think the sort of conspiracy-mongering (don’t forget Donald said “someone should look into that!” about Ted Cruz’s dad murdering JFK) plays SO WELL to Trump’s most vociferous portion of his base. Not sure that’ll be enough to win.
With 150,000 Americans dead and the Trump/Barr tagteam wiping their ass with the constitution, watch Congress tear in the Apple because their iPhones are too expensive.
I don’t really consider myself liberal in the 2020 terms. 😇  I have a lot of Fox News peeps in my family. Trump was the first candidate I voted for who wasn’t third party since 2004. I think he’s a compulsive liar, sloppy, a pretty awful leader. But context is everything.
That’s fair. Honestly, it’s more embarrassing for Rand Pwho actually finally answered the “?” (“What crime?”) w/ “I have a hunch”. 🥴  I would posit that it would be very interesting to sit in on Trump/McEnany meetings. I think he prolly makes it a harder job than it usually is.

I am waiting for the Trump brand to be released.   Like the Flintstones Chewable vitamines,  I can get the Trump family!  Do you think Donald will be orange? What colors for the others?
What an asshole. He’s the only other moron besides Trump who thinks China is paying tariffs and they’re killing the farmers with NO TRADE DEALS...China’s buying all their products from Brazil.
Is team America a place where are you guys get concerned about Russians paying bounty for US soldier deaths and your boy Trump not commenting?
Trump chats with Putin how many times during this planning process? Putin &amp; Trump plotting &amp; planning is frightful &amp; treasonous of Trump.
No Trump knows the definition of the word fair, you go around re -tweeting  lunatic 's such as Dr.Stella Immanuel,(I use the term Dr. Questioning her actual degree) but what can you expect from a Trump they only believe in their own altered reality.
And there is an expiration date on those. No wonder Trump wants to push them. #TrumpthePusherman
So, am I to believe the Left is being encouraged to carry American flags to show resistance to Trump?  Wait....doesn’t the Left HATE the American flag?
Because Barr is a lying like Trump and your an enabler. All you do is spew conspiracies and you did more worthless investigations under Obama and had no problem with them. They should be investigating you for your past.
Republicans revolt against GOP's bill. Trump wants FBI building near his hotel. Senators pretend they don’t know why that’s in the bill...
I vote on policy, not character (why I avoid anti-environment, pro-abortion, pro-war candidates) yet, - even if I agree w/ some of Trump’s policies - failure to act in light of potential worst case scenarios in February was caused by his lack of character.He’s simply not a leader
WRONG. (Insert Trump Voice)
And trump’s question was “...are they paying Russia for the weapons?”

Barr had his hands all over face repeatedly during testimony. Gohmert walked directly behind Barr entering the hearings. #BarrPrimePatsy (for COVID or Trump crime syndicate!)

There's a nonzero chance Trump has asked Roger Stone to look into how he might go about grabbing some succubus p*ssy.
Maybe if he could have branded it “the Trump official day of mourning” or something like that he would’ve been all over it!
No worries! Trump can refer Gohmert to Dr Stella Immanuel, a very highly respected (according to Trump 🤷🏼‍♀️), physician.

So you are going to deliver us from that evil demon trump?  How soon?
I can’t help but think that #Barr’s sphincter tightened just a bit more than normal during that line of questioning. I think he came into those hearings thinking he had the same kind of immunity to justice in reality that Trump thinks he has. #SadlyMistaken

Trump makes terrible decisions some times that can end up endangering Americans.
Uh, this is an absolute lie. Straight up bullshit. Plenty of doctors with experience treating COVID-19 have spoke up about it.   Nothing else should be expected from Trump land at this point, but the level of dishonesty here is mind blowing.
But the possibility that Trump is a reptilian would explain many things.
What does "I'm done" mean here exactly?  Does it mean you're not voting for Trump in November? Or does it mean you're fine with all the people that are jammed into this clown car but you're done talking about it for today because it's extremely embarrassing?

John, Kudos to you for calling out Trump on his immaturity and lack of seriousness.  Most of the press normalizes Trump &amp; grades him on a curve.
Omg Trump was whining about "no one likes him" because Dr Fauci 's number are better than his. An he liked the female Dr's voice so to him it made sense to try an pus Hydroxchloroquine again!

I just watched your recent 538 chat with your team. Michelle Obama was suggested as a VP and the idea was laughed off. Why? It would mean a sure win for Biden. She would level Pence in a debate not to mention making life miserable for Trump. MichelleO#VP2020

Barr was campaigning for Trump’s re-election today. He is not about equal justice or protecting the constitution. So obvious. #ImpeachBarr
Spot on! Barr appears to be on the Trump re-election campaign committee.
Yep. When he hollers out BS in defense of Trump when not even being asked a question make it clear, Barr is a member of the Trump re-election campaign !

Biden will campaign as the least progressive Democrat since FDR. He dreams he can win over Trump votters.
Omg Obama wasn't in office ,Trump is at fault!!!!
It’s nakedly apparent to me now that the Dem strategy is to openly flip off the left, then when Trump wins because their garbage policies don’t excite voters to jump GOP “voter fraud” hurdles they can blame the Bros and permanently shift to centrist neoliberalism

Those people all cane from Trump.  He spews idiocy and they all think he is a genius.  I guess Ron White was right, You Can’t Fox Stupid
The republican talking points are on full display today at this Barr hearing. This is basically a reelection campaign event for Trump at this point.
These are the only words that come out of Donald Trump’s mouth. “Make America great again” he hasn’t moved a muscle to do anything except patronize, Dehumanize, disrespect and create racial divide. This is not how any country becomes great. He truly is the biggest loser.
If you are so worried about over/under performance in the polls, wouldn't you want the gap to be as wide as possible?   If Biden is +8 in the polls before election day, the poll would have had to be off by that much for Trump to win the state, which is historically rare.
Are you aware that Trump tweeted about Stone's refusal 2 testify, praising Stone for having "guts"?
AG Barr, you testified during your confirmation hearing that, if the Pres issued a pardon in exchange for the recipient's promise not to incriminate him, "that would be a crime."   Are you aware that Trump tweeted about Stone's refusal 2 testify, praising Stone for having "guts"?
It’s usual for a politician to have an agenda that benefits him/her but trump’s agenda is designed specifically to stroke his ego. He pays no attention to political benefit.
A standout contribution to the Trump Would Be Doing Better If He Weren't Trump trope. Well done, Ari.

Barr says justice should be equal for all. But he interjected himself in court cases of Trump’s friends, Flynn, Stone, Cohen. #BarrIsTrumpStooge
Watch out for the ‘mincer of words’ to say: “Yes, I feel it’s my job to ‘secure’ an election (*muttering*: secure it for my boss Donald Trump!).
Hopefully even trump supporters will see Barr for the power-hungry, democracy smashing roadie that he is.
Trump wants a civil war &amp; believes he will come out on top. He may get the war but will be mistaken about the outcome.   Too much to lose for democracy to go out quietly.
Trump?
Therein is the problem. Yku have taken the red pill and not remained an independent thinker. American values? I think not. Trimming the Constitution is quickly becomming a shredding party for Trump and company. Rule of law? Law and Order President? Really? Stand independent!

The asshole tRump just cannot tell the truth!
$1.75 billion for Trump’s personal benefit
Our military speak the truth. Plus Trump does not protect and defend them - he and Putin outs prices in American soldiers heads.
Who controlled the funds? Obviously Trumps corrupt family &amp; corrupt leaders who also stole taxpayer monies for themselves. Why isn’t RICO -US racketeering investigators - freezing Trump’s assets. Most mobsters get caught when their fraudulent  taxes are revealed.
Seriously, have a listen and a natter with your peers in  and the people who actually understand where footie that isn’t bankrolled by oligarchs like  and  and then tell us it’s fair afterwards.  As out of touch as Donald Trump at a BLM march
Trump, such a vile spirit of a person. Such inhumane person, too bad he's the president of the US, so embarrassing.
Trump's so proud that he's making lots of money from Saudi's.
Donald Trump forgets that he is not immortal. He too will die someday and he too will be disrespected and disregarded. His actions are deplorable

I used to think I was the most insecure man alive.
Trump obviously needs to read the bill of fights starting with FIRST AMENDMENT...Free Speech He’s trying to destroy speech for his personal gain /perversions. There are 300  million us citizens. We ALLhave a right to free speech. Trumps ugly terroristic threats are  illegal
To be so unaware of what drives Trump’s popularity astounds me. There is a large group of us who are sick of being made fun of.  Keep up the snarky comments!
If trump “wins” the next election That’ll be my last straw to believing in our check and balances

Every thing i want to call trump/barr/mconnell are all 86ed by those who enthusiastically use their brains.  And i don't want to make friends with deplorable people so i feel lonely and angry
I’m sorry but if you’re a trump supporter my whole view of you immediately changes. Like how can you still support a racist pedophile??? Make it make sense
Yes there are words. He doesn’t deserve to exist in the same universe as John Lewis. He is a bigoted racist narcissist. As I heard a colleague of John Lewis share today, we should not waste time or breath on Trump, this moment is about a great man, John Lewis.
Yeah, I don't trust never-trumpers with a ten-foot pole. Sure, they wanna get rid of Trump but certainly will go back to being Republican assholes after he's gone. My question is: Why were they Republicans in the first place? They've always been on the wrong side, before Trump!
She's the very reason Trump is president now so I don't see the national party allowing it to happen. And as mentally gone as he is i also dont think he wants to kill himself by doing that.

Well, the President has no authority to do that.  It would be in abject violation of the Interstate Commerce Clause of the Constitution in any case.  I therefore don't see how anyone can blame Trump for not doing something radically Unconstitutional.
Plus the established fact that they can't even say what they like about him except that he's not Trump.
Well, he did talk to Putin today. And we know who trump believes between Putin and American Intelligence.
Sadly, I find that I can't vote my conscience this time around. That hasn't happened for my entire adult life.  This time around I'm going to be forced to vote for Trump.  The Democrats have become outright communists. Under no circumstances can they be allowed to come to power.
4/ Republicans accept losses.  Democrats don't.  That much is crystal clear, and it's why the left will start a shooting war when Trump wins.
isn’t a supporter, she’s a bona fide tRump disciple. Kool-aid courses through her veins and if cut, she proudly bleeds Russian red.
Those who believe a senile old bat is a shoe-in for President "because Trump" better have a look at this.  All you've done is frighten people into clamming up. This will not translate to votes in November.  ITrump will win in a landslide, and then the left will start a civil war.
So many old people I talked to said that they’re voting for trump bc he’s Catholic. Like what... wall of separation people, what’s not clicking 🤡🤡🤡🤡
Linda just went full batshit, folks! I will admit she was correct on one statement...this IS tRump’s fault.  Thank you, Linda, for having the courage to admit that. 👏🏻👏🏻

And tRump loves you.  He even said it on national television.
I don’t think you understand what “influence” means, Linda. Keep doing you though, you’re definitely tRump’s favorite kind of disciple.
And yet you support the exact opposite of John Lewis' values by kissing up to Trump. Hypocrite.

The Republican base may be poisoned real estate -- polluted beyond anyone's ability to detoxify -- but it is also too valuable to abandon, which means that even after Trump is gone, somebody is going to build something on it.    Something terrible.

The Republicans want to cut unemployment benefits because they know Trump is toast.  The D.C. Republicans want to sabotage the economy and a Biden presidency.  At least in 2008, they had the courtesy to wait until after Obama won before they began to try to ruin his presidency.
The problem is not Trump.  Trump is a symptom.  And terrible, destructive, run-amok symptom, but a symptom nonetheless.    The Republican Party -- root and branch-- is the problem.

As Trump Implodes, Democrats Roll Out the Red Carpet for Bush Era Republicans – Due Dissidence
I always thought his core was proud of trump’s hook-ups, esp Stormy. They see him as virile and want to be like him. Ethics and morals don’t apply.
Glad to see Trump find another alleged child molester in he Nuge to come help home out.  Those probably are getting hard to come by.
If Dems get their way for taxes under a trump administration in four years from now, you're absolutely right. If Dems get their way under a Biden administration in four years from now, there won't be much left in his check after taxes are taken out.
Those are the internment camps that Trump thought we're a good idea.
Here's a good compilation to get you started
The biggest change since 2016 in most polls has been adjusting for and weighting responses by education. Poll respondents are disproportionately post-collegiate, which failed to capture Trump’s support among non-college voters in ‘16. This is being adjusted for in modern polls.

I love the passion you possess in hating Trump . My sentiments exactly! So much more meaningful when we can all loath Trumps together across the miles that separate us !!
God has mysterious ways (strong winds) to stop evil power hungry sadists who spend billions of dollars wasted on walls. Never put Trump in charge of protecting your chickens. He doesn't even know all they'd have to do is walk around it to get in or out.  Dumb is as dumb does.
I can't believe that so many Trump Supporter's could swim that fast... Their momma's should have spit...
Trump is the accelerant not the antidote. Americans will not tolerate an authoritarian government from the left or the right. Bank on it!
In MN I saw a homemade “Biden for Prison” sign...does that count?
By the time this is done Trump is going to throw his kids to the wolves if it means he has a shot!
They are building a wall in Portland, and Trump is paying for it. #Irony
Is Donald Trump trying to act human? This is cute though.
Is it rare to find Bacon and Trump signs placed in the same yard?
I'm a Hell of a lot more worried about trump and prince's jack-booted thugs throwing me into an unmarked van than anything Joe would ever do
Literally don’t care about the predictions. When trump is out of office and Biden is sworn in. I’ll believe it.
Wrong trumpet; last Trump is not the same trumpets of the pouring out of wrath.  2 separate events.
For months, Trump has tried to bullshit, bully, dismiss, lie and distract his way through the biggest public health crisis in a century. He feigns seriousness now only because his lizard brain senses danger to himself, this after 4 million infections, 145,000-plus deaths 1/4
If it weren't for trump, he would be the dumbest person alive
I mean this seems like weird speculation.  Trump canceled his appearance at Yankee Stadium because he realized there would be players kneeling during the anthem as several Yankees started doing it this weekend and at least one says he intends to continue it indefinitely
Another strong woman who doesn't listen to Trump...
Silence from Trump is two things- one he is afraid to discuss it. Two he’s hoping Americans will forget he is putting bounties on American soldiers with Russia. We won’t forget, Donald. Even some of your gun toters don’t like people who plot to kill American soldiers for profit.
That's also what Trump and the feds are telling them is true, right?  When you are in a bubble where everyone tells you what you already want to believe, most will believe it in defiance of reasoning.   Motivated reasoning is one of the most powerful human forces.
The DC Republicans know that Trump is toast and they're already beginning to sabotage the economy and a Biden presidency.
And that’s supposed to be a bad thing?  I’m disappointed Trump’s version of America ever existed in the first place
That sound you hear is  rushing to make another devastating anti-Trump video.
Trump is acting like a poor loser before the election even takes place.
Thanks, Trump.

Trump has broken the first rule of politics—don’t kill your voters in an election year!
I think a lot of trumpists continue to bluster out of peer pressure but they know Trump's full of shit. They won't admit they were wrong about him. Hopefully, they won't bother to vote for him again and better yet, once they're alone in the voting booth check the Biden box. ✅
Letting people die on his own state to appease Trump is pretty incredible.
I'm sure trump's followers will see this as "God's Will", she said sarcastically while rolling her eyes.🙄
You betcha I am. Freaking coolest person on the planet silly you. You also are a good joke teller. For instance saying trump isn’t a good president.. like comedy. Also it’s really funny how you freak out about this so called “global pandemic” ... 👏 A1 comedy 😅

Fits right in w what Mary Trump said about his father’s influence. He of course didn’t succeed at baseball but recently claimed he was player of the year and coach’s medal winner at school.
Irony here. Trump played baseball at prep school. Coach said he had some ability but was so aggressive he constantly struck out and had zero team skills.
Every day I’m scared as hell about what Trump and his cronies like William Barr are doing to this country. And then I see videos like this and I’m scared as hell what people actually seem to think that are allowing Trump and his cronies like William Barr destroy this country.
Trump likes to be one just like his role models.
Does it matter what the black candidate believes though? I mean, I wouldn't vote for Jesse Jackson over trump OR biden. NOW, WHEN tim scott is our nominee, I'm all in!

Not understanding you profile. You seem to support Trump, yet you sound more like a liberal by supporting bullshit reparations and talk about white privilege. My family never owned slaves so I don't owe you shit!
They didn't have to die. Trump has blood on his hands. He convinced a lot of voters with "What do you have to lose?" Now, we know.
Trying to cultivate the Trump vote won’t work. They don’t respect you.
Not gonna happen. Trump's anti-mask propaganda worked. Youth think they're bulletproof &amp; lot of people are just ignorant, irresponsible or don't care. The US is so fucked-up, even if the whole country were locked-down and mask mandates were put in place, we'd still be screwed.
That’s incredible! Hooray for the Reagan Foundation!  President Reagan would have never agreed with Trump’s idealogy.
Trump works hard at it - stupid to harm others and steal from taxpayers. He is stupid with a con man plan.
Why isn’t Trump and this supporter in jail right now? PleSe speed up your help, God, against those hated and wvil! PleAse!!!!

Jeh Johnson on Trump sending feds to cities: A militaristic presence ‘can make matters worse’

This is the America that the libs have wanted for 40 years, well before Trump came into the picture. Nice try though...
Trump does nothing for anything but political goals because he wants to keep stealing from taxpayers at will as he has done for four years.
In light of everything going on in our major metropolitan areas today, I have seen very little honest reporting regarding the terrible jobs long time Democratic leaders have been doing but I have seen several reports that it's all Trump's fault. How does this make sense to anyone
Worth repeating. After Trump is ousted it'd be great not to here his name again, unless he's reporting for prison.
Vets are targets of these illegal Trump hires mob goons.
But, hopefully, this isn't a typical election. Maybe Trump's slide in the polls will continue and his repudiation will result in a landslide victory for Joe.
“...we want to make sure they get less to go back to work in unsafe conditions and put their lives at risk so we can point and say ‘hey, Trump got people working gain!’ And even though it means more needless deaths we can at least still stay in power...”
Yep. Pollsters and election pundits are saying  best strategy is to virtually do nothing. Let Trump hang himself.
For example? Who is killing Trump supporters? Can you provide names of supporters killed?
What makes you think Trump will come up when every day he keeps losing ground? It seems like more and more Independents and Republicans are finally saying enough is enough.
It's definitely not.   It's also not hyperbole to start calling it the Trump regime rather than the Trump admin.
IMO, the conservative media bears a significant amount of responsibility for the current state of the GOP.  Trump is popular with GOP voters because his nasty persona resembles the likes of Limbaugh &amp; Hannity.  GOP voters have marinated in that hatred for 30 years.
Elementary, for certain. Linguists say Trump's vocabulary is third-grade level. The United States is being run by a grade school bully that strong-arms the smaller kids for lunch money.
Ben Sasse, Jeff Fortenberry &amp; Don Bacon are responsible for this disaster due to their support of Trump.  They support Trump's re-election &amp; apparently want 4 more years of this.  Fortenberry &amp; Bacon even took a pledge not to criticize Trump.  Vote them out!  #TrumpVirus

GDP PLUMMETS BY 33% - Trump's failed America again. His tax cuts for the rich! His trade war with China! Farmers filing bankruptcy!  is the failure of all Americans! He is a traitor for Putin sent to destroy America from within!
While it would not be a surprise if he tweeted something like this, it appears to be photoshopped.

She's just upset she sold her professional integrity to a moron like Trump.  Talk about never getting a job again.

Yeah it will, you tell them. 2020 Trump re-elected.

Too bad your side decided not to run a viable candidate.  Trump will win by more electoral votes than he did in ‘16
Trump is too incompetent to be a true threat to whatever but people elected Trump to break norms. Certain norms are too much for certain people.
Mail in voting has been a“legitimate”option since the civil war. Trump wants to act like this is some new strategy. It’s been around forever but he knows he’s getting his ass kicked so he is coming up with any excuse he can to delegitimize the election results. Pretty simple...
Trump is betraying the country &amp; constitution again. Now he's trying to pull a Putin.

Did Trump mastermind a 2nd Tulsa Massacre?
Nope, he absolutely is. They’re still feeling the ramifications of Bush’s decision to this day, just look at Syria. But I will absolutely say that trump has done more to harm our democracy than trump. In a just world neither one of them would be anywhere near holding the office.

Wonder what killed more Americans. The idiotic Iraq wars or the hapless Covid response. I couldn’t disagree more with the decision to go into Iraq, I’d still take Bush over trump, no question.
Are we surprised Trump is a pussy? Bunker boy bone spurs afraid to tell Putin to stop putting bounties on American troops. Sounds about right
Let’s use logic. He contracted covid after attending the trump rally in Tulsa at which masks were not required. He then died from covid related complications. Cain was responsible for not wearing a mask obviously. But this could have been easily prevented by masks or no rally.
Someone in the White House told Trump that he had to pretend to care about America's deaths.

Lol, pretty much every liberal would take Bush over Trump in a heartbeat. I disagreed with a great deal of Bushs policies but he at least brought some dignity to the position, and respected his opponents and his country.
You call it “A Trump”
Louis didn’t attend George Bush’s inauguration either. Bush still showed up and spoke at his funeral. Somethings are bigger than politics, Trump absolutely to his core doesn’t believe that.
You hooked your self to a real career ending grifter. You will be noted as a failure along with Trump in History books
Fuck that
Yet Trump got annihilated for giving a rally type message in the Rose Garden.
See, work is different than a rally. You have to go to work. They made you sign it because it’s a job. You are comparing a Trump rally to a job? What? I’m holding a big party that I know is dangerous, so sign a waiver at the door. That doesn’t equal employment
If only Trump didn’t order those COVID patients to go into nursing homes and killed all those old people.  Shit..that was the governor of NY, NJ, PA, and MI.  My bad.
In the coming weeks and months, Republicans may try to DISTANCE themselves from Donald Trump. But please remember this:  Public statements of Trump disapproval DON'T matter if you still wholeheartedly enable Trump's agenda.   And  does this in SPADES. 👍
So Trump praises that we are testing more than anyone in the world but a couple weeks ago he wanted to stop testing? What would he have to praise about us if we didn't have all that testing?
Travel ban not enough!  Trump is responsible for over 150,000 deaths!!!

WATCH -- Herman Cain was an outspoken backer of the president and was named by the campaign as a co-chair of Black Voices for Trump. Cain posted a photo to his Twitter account from the rally. He was not wearing a mask and not social distancing in the crowd of thousands.
Fact is, the US is the only country to let the loser of an election stay in office for 12 additional weeks!  What do you think Trump can do to American in 12 weeks while kissing the ass of Putin !?!?!?!!?!?!
Thank you, President Trump, sir.  As you said before your election, we will win so much we will get sick of winning.  You were right, because I'm absolutely sick of it all!!

No, the following day would be okay.  As long as Trump doesn't rig the voting process!!!
Don’t forget Mr. Constitutionalist  who is usually too busy giving us folksy lectures on what’s wrong with today’s youth, and occasionally trump, without actually putting any weight behind his words. #Nebraska deserves better than this ineffectual hypocrite.
Can you do tweets for the other 151, 569 Americans who have died from COVID-19?  Here's a reminder, Don.  The CDC issued its first warning on 1/8.  Trump held campaign rallies on 1/9, 1/14, 1/28, 1/30, 2/10, 2/19, 2/20, 2/21, and 2/28.
Are you related to former Rep. Doug Bereuter? I’ve been a registered Democrat since I was 18, but crossed party lines to vote for him a number of times when I lived in Lincoln. I can’t believe he would get in line to lick Trump’s boots the way Bacon does.

Trump only cares about himself. Trump has no empathy for the dead!!!
Is Trump still calling Covid 19 virus a HOAX???   Trump doesn't care about 150,000 dead Americans!  Trump is busy golfing and trying to rig the election!  Trump is busy following orders from Putin!!
There will be no delay in the 2020 election. John Cornyn says Donald Trump was joking. Ha, Ha. Get it?
Dr. Fauci is trusted and loved. Trump is hated and despised.
“Accept last election”?  Such a tired retort.  Don’t be mad because sane people call out trump’s every attempt to undermine our democracy.  Frankly, assuming your a US citizen you should be unhappy with his unethical behavior.
Trump’s prediction of a V shaped economic recovery is as false as his previous predictions that Coronavirus was under control and would magically disappear and his claims of approval by 96% of Republicans.
Only the Trump cult cares. The rest of us just watched the REAL President in action.
This is a great idea to have all the trump supporters refuse to vote on November 3rd. Protest the Election Day.
The silent majority you folks keep trying to push does not exist. Trump lost the popular vote to Hillary by almost 3 million votes. Do you understand what “majority” means? The country is far worse off then it was 4 years ago. Please keep pretending everything is great.
.  Herman Cain before the Trump Tulsa rally.
Because the timing fits as well as Trump campaign staffers were tested positive for the virus and kept working the rally. Of course it could have come from anywhere though.
Yet, they call us “Libtards” but they believe “Q” to be JFK’s deceased son &amp; Trump is their “chosen” one to bring down a massive Democratic Pedophile ring 🤦‍♀️😂
So you are separating yourself now from Trump. I don’t believe it. You voted not to impeach this nut and now we are suffering from the chaos of his ineptitude!
Let him move it to May of 2021. On January 20th President Nancy P will arrest former president trump, get ahold of his taxes, confiscate all his properties, and jail his whole family. Then  on the 21st , even more.
Got it at a Trump rally. Freedom!!

I'd never thought I'd see a Interracials for Trump account with no mention of Teanna. What a disappointment.
Exactly.  Bacon and Trump are both campaigning on issues that exist now, while they are in office.   Even issues they created themselves.  Fix it now.  If you can fix it, do it.  They don't because they won't.

Oh good! Hearing that blubbering fool after listen to President Obama’s soul moving eulogy is just what is needed to further show Trump’s ineptitude!

Do we need any further evidence that Trump is crapping himself daily. He is flailing uncontrollably.
The suspect is dead &amp; his girlfriend who helped dispose of her body is in custody, so how could Trump help get justice against the killer? Unless he's going to strengthen the military's stalking &amp; sexual assault laws, he's using this poor family's tragedy for political theater?
We need you to lead on this. Trump didn't accept the results of an election he won! He will no doubt use every apparatus his office grants to distort the result this time.  You need to speak, on the floor of the house, on NET, KETV, CNN, Fox, whoever will put you on camera.

Trump is trying to destroy the US Postal Service so he can say the voting is flawed and doesn't count.

That is not how it works. Trump won because he won a majority of electoral votes from states with large rural populations + key larger states. Most states have laws binding Electoral voters to vote the will of the people - so if a 3rd party candidate won a state - 1/2
A Biden Tulsi card might be the only way we can get trump out of office.

I get that we should try everything. The thing is, they have been trying it and it’s not working. At this point it’s a partisan idea because Trump is invested in it and has bought a ton via our government. But it is turning out to be more harmful than good.
They have, and it’s not working for everyone. Not even close. So many terrible side effects. No real evidence of working. Here’s the real reason they are touting that. It’s all about $$$ for Trump and his pals.

Hey Trump does that include the White Nationalist Racists going blackface who have been arrested in several cities already for violence rioting looting burnings attacking police and who are in Portland right now?
The mayor and the city Council are accomplices to terrorism. They should be arrested for being accomplices. They have told their officers to stand down. They are accomplices with the rioters. Trump could go in and arrest them for this!

Trump needs to listen to his damn experts. Science is a process, not an opinion nor a conclusion. Scientists give the most accurate information they can at the time that have it. Research scientists are willing to CHANGE what they recommend because they have new evidence.

The doctor has made other troubling claims, including medicine is being made by using alien DNA and sex with “tormenting spirits” is responsible for gynecological problems.
Since Putin is Trumps buddy, USA is turning it’s back on NATO and opening the gate for Soviet take over of Europe. When will Republicans start defending our Country instead of letting Trump destroy it?  😡
Keep pushing Trump, Kaitlin!
I would expect a much better graphic overlay from someone who grifted millions off the Trump campaign.

I was raised Republican but my family figured out awhile ago that the Republican Party was the party of hate and division. The GOP needs to die just like the know nothings before them. And good riddance when it happens.
Where you at trump supporters? Where's the defense for this? Fucking ridiculous.
NO, Let the trump supports take it first and if half of than die, who will miss then.
Interesting.  It makes you think about the future of a post-Trump world.
And the $1.75 billion that Trump wants to give FBI building so they can build a new building in D. C. So they don't move out, leaving a vacant spot across from one of his hotels. Can't have a competing hotel move in and add competition...
“The vast majority of Americans support protecting Dreamers. Now is not the time to upend their lives again.” And yet, that’s what the Trump administration is doing.  #HomeisHere #HeretoStay
Trust him or not, whatever the news outlet, just listen to what Trump says and you can tell he's vastly incompetent and dangerous.
"There is a collective blame to be shared by those of us who have created the modern Republican Party that has so egregiously betrayed the principles it claimed to represent."
People only know about nationwide protests and attempts to torch police stations and federal buildings bEcAuSe TrUmP. 🤣  #LiberalismIsAMentalDisorder  #Riots2020
That’s what’s wrong with you people. You know nothing about diplomacy. Bluster and brovado do not a foreign policy make. As Teddy Roosevelt said, “speak softly and carry a big stick.” Trump is like a bull in a china shop.
"Mr. Trump has served a useful purpose by exposing the deep flaws of a major American political party. Like a heavy truck driven over a bridge on the edge of failure, he has made it impossible to ignore the long-developing fault lines of the Rep Party"

Fauci ratings 👍 Trump ratings 👎 🖕🖕🖕Donald!
#NobodyLikesMe Dr Fauci actually lead the country during this pandemic  Trump on the other hand the suppose leader of the country said it was a hoax  IT'S THAT SIMPLE
This is just delusional. Trump has ensured a generation will not just oppose the  but be appalled by it.  But Trump is not an aberration - he's the culmination of what the party ethos has always been - selfishness - and they reject it.
I can’t wait for the debates. Trump is going to burry dementia Joe’
150,000 dead under trump and democrats have lost common sense? Are you on drugs?
Ha ha. No doubt about it; Sarpy Don Bacon is going off the rails with the Trump Train. Won't look good for the leaders of the Douglas County Republicans or the Nebraska Republican Party.   They lost District 2. Only one Dem in the last twenty years held that spot
If it's any consolation my 88 year old mother wears a mask and thinks Trump is an idiot.  She's also not on any social media.
Buy Mary Trump's book!  It helps explain why Donald is CRAZY!

Lady come on. Trump screwed people as a matter of course. He lied and cheated to try and get ahead. Read about his past. Listen to his niece a family member who tells all about it. Now he does the same thing in the WH. You’re right that he’s not perfect, he’s not even close.
Trump just can’t let go of the fake hydroxychloroquine cure. Can’t back off. Like when he ran a fake university &amp; a fake charity. He’s a con. Sure but just CAN’T be wrong, thinks he’s Sherlock Holmes arguing down every Dr. Watson. Diagnosis: chronic “knowitallwhiteman” syndrome.
Trump is Crazy!
Trump is Cra Cra!!!
the drive from Omaha to Lincoln and back includes one outlet mall, one huge Trump sign, a lot of construction, and a Catholic Church I can never stop thinking about
1. Why didn’t he reduce prescription prices 3 years ago if he could? His action will in reality do little to impact prices if at all. 2. The VA Choice bill was actually signed into law by Obama. Trump has tried to take credit for it. 3. 216 miles of unnecessary wall had been....
I’m just amazed that Biden is doing as “well” as he is.  He’s mentally challenged, he has no platform except he’s not Trump, and his four decade record in congress is as impressive as the Joe Philbin era.
The MORE CRIMES YOU CATCH TRUMP AND BARR AND MCCONNELL IN, THE MORE RACIST, DEVIANT CRIMES THEY COMMIT! I BET PUTIN IS BEHIND ALL OF THIS! LOCK THEM UP AND THIS WILL STOP! OBVIOUSLY RICH WHITE MEN ARE NOT AS SMART AS THE PRETEND TO BE, JUST BETTER THIEVES AND DON'T GO TO JAIL
The government will deny all new applications, limit renewals to one year instead of two, and deny requests by DACA recipients to visit their home countries unless there are “exceptional circumstances.”

Maybe Willam P(ussy) Barr doesn't know" he's stepping down, or being pushed" Like he said!  And COVID IS NOT GOING AWAY! THE TRUMP ADMINSTRATION IS ALL LIARS THE ONLY WAY TO BELIEVE ANY OF THEM IS TO VOTE THEN OUT AND DEMAND PROSECUTION! THEN, THEY'LL ALL FALL DOWN! IN JAIL

These guys speak for me. Perhaps they do for some of you, as well. There was a time when the      would support a statement like this. What happened to them? In a word, Trump.
My rep  said it was an "easy choice" to endorse Trump for another 4 years. Don is a retired 1 star. He's not dumb. He knows Trump is dangerously unfit for office. But he's willing to place the country in danger another 4 years to advance his own interests.
Listen to Trump and try to rationalize his subservient attitude toward Putin in a way in which he *isn't* being blackmailed. Hard to do.  The key to being a good bullshitter is to make accusations w/out being specific. Who said it was fake news? "Many people."
So frustrating that we are unable to recover from the virus because of the tyranny of the stupid, led by the leader of the stupid, Trump. Bleach injections and demon sperm?  #WearADamnMask

thank you and you family for everything you are doing.  I know it must be awful having to deal with the anti-american rabids . I  am  so sorry for what the demspots  are doing.  Trump 2020 all the way!!!
Trump campaigned in 2016 that he wouldn’t be bought by anyone and would return power back to the people.   Boeing and Lockheed aren’t “the people,” now in a pandemic, or ever. #TrumpSwamp #TrumpVirus
Oh man, I look forward to Boogey Man Trump being a thing this election, and us not giving a shit about HRCs, or whoever is running's, policies.  I bet it'll work.
I totally agree, and really needed that now. I’ve been crying and rewatching too. Sadly beautiful. Am keeping this for times ahead when I’ll need inspiration. Thank you so much for posting this &amp; the rainbow photo. So poetic. Hope we can collectively be as strong as he was.
This is really the doctor the Trump Administration is currently standing behind?  Seriously?  This is where we are at?
Trump and his family criminal syndicate hopefully won't need it in Federal Prison
WOW! This is one of the most powerful, poignant, inspirational things that I have seen in a very long time! I am angry, bitter, and I hate Trump. I’ll have to try to remember his beautiful words at the end of his speech. #JohnLewisRIP #BLM 🖤#Biden2020  Thanks
Not that Cory Booker would be a bad choice for Biden’s cabinet, it’s just that... HUD is the only role Trump can imagine a black man filling because Trump is a racist.
Other than Trump and his minions invested in the drug when there was a whisper of hope about it? Nah...I have no idea why.
Thank you! That’s the most powerful, poignant, inspirational thing that I have seen in a long time! SO hard for me to live up to the last part—I am angry, bitter, and hate Trump. I’ll have to try to remember his words. #JohnLewisRIP #BLM 🖤#Biden2020 #BlackLivesMatter #JoeBiden
Same rally where one of trumps allies caught the virus and has been hospitalized in the four weeks since? Same ally trump won’t even acknowledge? Sit down.
trump and his cronies will be labeling ABC fake news within the hour. Because no way could it be every major organization and medical expert in the world reporting facts while trump lies like it’s his fucking job.
Why is this happening on American soil?  This is Trump's America:  goon squads, daylight kidnappings, secret police.  Why is our leadership sitting on its hands while we turn into Nazi Germany?  Get off your ass.
But Trump was going to "be the oversite"...
Trump posing for his Presidential PortraitChina didn't control how we reacted to this, Trump did.
That's part of it.  And more boomers hot retirement.  And they changed some disability benchmarks.  There's a lot that went into those "amazing" numbers that Trump had.
Trump.
Obama created more Jobs than Trump did.  His economy was great.  That's one of the biggest right wing lies out there.
I'm well aware that Pres. Trump like to mess with the media. But journalists still have an obligation to accurately report things.
Trump says kids have to go to school regardless of virus status, but election that affects him isn't safe enough to do right now. WTF?
The dates of federal elections are enshrined in federal law and would require an act of Congress to change.
Pres. Trump suggests a delay of the 2020 election.  It’s important to note elections dates are set by law and Congress would have to act to move the date. Elections are also run locally, not by feds. There are several hurdles if the president is serious about this.

I'm so glad I had no idea this show existed.  I'm hoping after Trump we talk get back to ignoring them.
I am an Independent, but as an Independent, I am not allowed to vote in the Republican Primary election. It didn't matter this year, since Trump is the incumbent, running unopposed, but I may need to re-evaluate my status at another time.
Maybe you could get a movement going to oust trump He appears to be a Russian tool
My favorite thing right now: people wearing a Biden or Trump shirt and/or waiving a flag and then posting and complaining how someone said negative things towards them . The ONLY reason you bought it was to get a reaction.  FFS.  Call it a win. You got exactly what you wanted.
ahh so the people living in Suburban homes not just the housewives. good to know. and yes why would we want to offer low income housing? the rich are what’s important in this country right? as trump puts it-make america rich again! i mean great🙄

Trump is Frankenstein's monster, the media is the mad scientist.
The real question here is "What planet are you from?"
I will never forgive Trump, his administration, his sycophants in both chambers, and his deplorable human beings. Thank God they're the minority. But, they're killing us because of our so called leaders. Hope I'm here to read the history books about today. 1918 Flu vs 2020 Covid.
If Trump wasn't an incompetent, malignant narcissist, he could have kept on grifting in NY. Nope, a black man. Stop. A prestigious and educated black man elected twice as POTUS, made fun of Trump  2011 at the WH Correpondence Dinner. Trump raged. Like the pathetic child he is.
It is beyond maddening what so many elected politicians allow a lifelong serial conman and serial liar, over twenty thousand times, to get away with. Trump is doing what Putin hoped he do: bring America to it's breaking point. Trump's too stupid to realize why Putin installed him
All roads lead to Putin with Trump AND the Republican party.
*Grift! Damnit. However, a Trump gift is always a grift anyway.
Poor spineless Republicans are experiencing the Trump family gift like all of us regular Americans are. Thoughts and prayers, traitor.
Fauci is not holding a cell phone. He is casually watching a game. He is not following any rules to stop spread. It may be a photo taken out of context but again thus happens on a daily basis to Trump. So Fauci and you can suck it up and shut up.

The way Trump treats Pelosi is exactly why  speaks up. Trump's behavior has no place in society!
Joyce, I can simplify this by saying, Trump doesn't do anything lawful. What can we do about it? The Republicans have abdicated their duties to defend and protect Americans from foreign and domestic enemies so WE MUST VOTE! That's the sole solution to saving democracy. Period.

Quite telling that educated people hate Trump and uneducated deplorables worship him. That's exactly how it works.

Trump Virus, the buck stops at the leader.
Good response.  That means you agree that Trump is awful.
You do the same thing, that's her point.  Trump is dangerous.

Trump is too incompetent to be a true threat to whatever but people elected Trump to break norms. Certain norms are too much for certain people.
Mail in voting has been a“legitimate”option since the civil war. Trump wants to act like this is some new strategy. It’s been around forever but he knows he’s getting his ass kicked so he is coming up with any excuse he can to delegitimize the election results. Pretty simple...
Of all the things trump has done, THIS is the worst?  After 3.5 years of enabling the trump regime, NOW they’ve found a breaking point.  Give me a break.

Are we surprised Trump is a pussy? Bunker boy bone spurs afraid to tell Putin to stop putting bounties on American troops. Sounds about right
Let’s use logic. He contracted covid after attending the trump rally in Tulsa at which masks were not required. He then died from covid related complications. Cain was responsible for not wearing a mask obviously. But this could have been easily prevented by masks or no rally.

Lol, pretty much every liberal would take Bush over Trump in a heartbeat. I disagreed with a great deal of Bushs policies but he at least brought some dignity to the position, and respected his opponents and his country.
You call it “A Trump”
Louis didn’t attend George Bush’s inauguration either. Bush still showed up and spoke at his funeral. Somethings are bigger than politics, Trump absolutely to his core doesn’t believe that.
You hooked your self to a real career ending grifter. You will be noted as a failure along with Trump in History books

See, work is different than a rally. You have to go to work. They made you sign it because it’s a job. You are comparing a Trump rally to a job? What? I’m holding a big party that I know is dangerous, so sign a waiver at the door. That doesn’t equal employment
If only Trump didn’t order those COVID patients to go into nursing homes and killed all those old people.  Shit..that was the governor of NY, NJ, PA, and MI.  My bad.
In the coming weeks and months, Republicans may try to DISTANCE themselves from Donald Trump. But please remember this:  Public statements of Trump disapproval DON'T matter if you still wholeheartedly enable Trump's agenda.   And  does this in SPADES. 👍
So Trump praises that we are testing more than anyone in the world but a couple weeks ago he wanted to stop testing? What would he have to praise about us if we didn't have all that testing?
QUIT GETTING DISTRACTED! Why is it so hard for the media to recognize when Trump is playing you and distracting you from MUCH more important issues? Worst GDP drop, Cain dies from C-19 after attending Tulsa rally, so trump fires off an election tweet and everyone goes nuts
Why did Trump have him sign a waiver to attend the rally?
No doy.  Now tell that Trump person you support.
Then why did Trump make him sign a waiver to attend a rally ? A Covid waiver ?
So Trump is defunding the police?! 😉
WATCH -- Herman Cain was an outspoken backer of the president and was named by the campaign as a co-chair of Black Voices for Trump. Cain posted a photo to his Twitter account from the rally. He was not wearing a mask and not social distancing in the crowd of thousands.
Fact is, the US is the only country to let the loser of an election stay in office for 12 additional weeks!  What do you think Trump can do to American in 12 weeks while kissing the ass of Putin !?!?!?!!?!?!
Thank you, President Trump, sir.  As you said before your election, we will win so much we will get sick of winning.  You were right, because I'm absolutely sick of it all!!
Obama compares segregationist Jim Crow America to Trump's America – live
But we don’t need career politicians, we NEED people who haven’t been playing the game for decades.  I realize I’ve not been kind to your political posts and I’m sorry but Biden and trump arnt the answers and would love to discuss this with you
Nice distraction from your failures. Worst economic contraction in US history! The Trump Depression. #TrumpFailsAmerica #TrumpVirus #TrumpIsNotWell
What if Trump is trolling us this whole time and then when he’s out he says “see, politics is a joke”
Don’t forget Mr. Constitutionalist  who is usually too busy giving us folksy lectures on what’s wrong with today’s youth, and occasionally trump, without actually putting any weight behind his words. #Nebraska deserves better than this ineffectual hypocrite.
Can you do tweets for the other 151, 569 Americans who have died from COVID-19?  Here's a reminder, Don.  The CDC issued its first warning on 1/8.  Trump held campaign rallies on 1/9, 1/14, 1/28, 1/30, 2/10, 2/19, 2/20, 2/21, and 2/28.
Are you related to former Rep. Doug Bereuter? I’ve been a registered Democrat since I was 18, but crossed party lines to vote for him a number of times when I lived in Lincoln. I can’t believe he would get in line to lick Trump’s boots the way Bacon does.
Or Putin just showing what he can get away with while Trump is POTUS.
This decision won’t be made by the idiotclown brigade attached to Trump,!! TheAmerican people will not stand for their shenanigans! I’m surprised Guliani hasnt shown up yet!
Trump can't shift public attention from coronavirus to the streets of America | Robert Reich
Do you know how many absentee ballots there are? Do you have any proof of a "major issue" with mail-in voting? Trump has never said that volume was the issue btw.

What Trump would like to do to the Mask People!🤣🤣🤣Everyone try to stay cool.😎👍
It's easy. Trump himself votes by mail.
Imagine the media's reaction if Trump (or any Republican) turned a funeral into a campaign speech?
There will be no delay in the 2020 election. John Cornyn says Donald Trump was joking. Ha, Ha. Get it?
“Accept last election”?  Such a tired retort.  Don’t be mad because sane people call out trump’s every attempt to undermine our democracy.  Frankly, assuming your a US citizen you should be unhappy with his unethical behavior.
Trump’s prediction of a V shaped economic recovery is as false as his previous predictions that Coronavirus was under control and would magically disappear and his claims of approval by 96% of Republicans.
Only the Trump cult cares. The rest of us just watched the REAL President in action.
The silent majority you folks keep trying to push does not exist. Trump lost the popular vote to Hillary by almost 3 million votes. Do you understand what “majority” means? The country is far worse off then it was 4 years ago. Please keep pretending everything is great.
.  Herman Cain before the Trump Tulsa rally.
Because the timing fits as well as Trump campaign staffers were tested positive for the virus and kept working the rally. Of course it could have come from anywhere though.
Yet, they call us “Libtards” but they believe “Q” to be JFK’s deceased son &amp; Trump is their “chosen” one to bring down a massive Democratic Pedophile ring 🤦‍♀️😂
So you are separating yourself now from Trump. I don’t believe it. You voted not to impeach this nut and now we are suffering from the chaos of his ineptitude!
Got it at a Trump rally. Freedom!!
“Cain joined Trump in actively campaigning against masks. In a tweet sent just before he was admitted to the hospital earlier this month, he praised Trump’s decision not to mandate mask-wearing at the president’s July 4 outdoor rally at Mount Rushmore.”
How long would Trump last at Basic🤔
#WeWillVote and f*** you Trump!!
Trump is so guilty of leading so many gullible people to their deaths-please someone stop this Monster!
So funding the country directly responsible for 9/11 and human rights violations is good because??? Also here's a Fox News link for you since you are on uneducated on the issue and need more sources.
Lost in the news cycle of Trump's outrageous threat to cancel the election is this economic news. #Ne01 #NE02.
Even Mitch McConnell couldn’t get on board with Trump on this one
Things that could not stop American elections:  -Civil War -World War I -Spanish Flu -The Great Depression -World War II -Literally anything ever   Things Trump thinks should stop an American election -His dog shit polling numbers
Wikipedia is sourced.  May 20, 2017, President Trump and Saudi Arabia's Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud signed a series of letters of intent for the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to purchase arms from the United States totaling US$110 billion immediately, and $350 billion over 10 years.
Answers to questions you may have about the election.  #vote2020
Trump finally expresses condolences for a COVID-19 victim. But doesn't mention COVID lol
#WeWillVote . Even if mail in vote not allowed. I will don full PPE risk getting Covid just to vote Trump out.
Trump wanted to nuke a hurricane.
I'd never thought I'd see a Interracials for Trump account with no mention of Teanna. What a disappointment.
Exactly.  Bacon and Trump are both campaigning on issues that exist now, while they are in office.   Even issues they created themselves.  Fix it now.  If you can fix it, do it.  They don't because they won't.
Cessor called his father from Nebraska and said he was going to "take care of Trump." His father convinced him to return to Cheyenne and to go to a medical facility. 3/4
Repubs sued in WI when dem gov tried to hold the primary via mail. Forced everyone to vote in person. This is just an extraordinary sign of desperation by trump. The wheels are falling off the wagon.
Patriots go turn this poll around. Only 7hrs left.
Yet they bash Trump for saying stuff like this.
Oh good! Hearing that blubbering fool after listen to President Obama’s soul moving eulogy is just what is needed to further show Trump’s ineptitude!
But  has no right to question mail-in voting?  The Dems r agreeing with Trump that CBS is #FakeNews or is there a problem with mail-in voting?  U can't have it both ways!  CBS Mail-In Voting Experiment Shows Potentially Serious Issue
Then why is Trump talking about it today ? You people
I don’t think he’s making it clear today. Unbelievable foresight from Biden. Trump blasted him for suggesting a change to the convention and look what Trump did? Now this. You better apologize to Biden
Lol. I know the day our society has finally advanced will be the day we finally stop reacting to things Trump says and instead look for the hidden motive. I fall for this myself. He really isn’t stupid.
Heck even Bush sounds eloquent compared to Trump.
Ummm. So, I’m not affiliated with any religion, but I need to throw a big #WWJD on this one! And agree 100%...so he’s still in office?  Afew trenders for good measure, because it makes tRump angry, which gives me great pleasure!!!  #racist #NobodyLikesTrump #TrumpMeltdown
Um Hasn't Trump done the same thing? Asking foe a friend
Do we need any further evidence that Trump is crapping himself daily. He is flailing uncontrollably.
We need you to lead on this. Trump didn't accept the results of an election he won! He will no doubt use every apparatus his office grants to distort the result this time.  You need to speak, on the floor of the house, on NET, KETV, CNN, Fox, whoever will put you on camera.

To the people hyperventilating about Trump “postponing” the election:  1) He can’t 2) States run the elections  3) His current term expires in Jan 2021 regardless if he wins reelection or not. 4) A lot of people would have to conspire for this to work
You mean the handbook that allowed 16 million cases of h1n1? I also love that the left has adopted Trump's weird way of capitalizing one word to make your argument sound stronger
I didn't know Trump ran California, I guess you learn something new everyday. I also blame Elon musk for all the environmental damage that gas powered cars have made.
What happened to George Floyd and many others before him was a hate crime. Wait till it’s your time. Let’s see how the Trump’s treat you
You "took a knee" to a Traitor.....Trump Sold our servicemen out, DISSED war heros like John McCain and DISRESPECTED GOLD STAR FAMILIES...  HE Lies DAILY and to EVERYONE.  your voting record is Trumps LEGACY......  Get Out
‘On the golf course — I gotta go’: Republicans wimp out after being confronted with Trump’s call to delay elections  #SmartNews
John Cornyn says Trump’s call to delay the election until safe is a joke. Trump is known for his humor and light hearted approach to life. So he chose the day of John Lewis funeral for his voting FunnyBone routine calling for delay of 2020 election. Get it?
Suggesting a delay and a power grab aren’t the same thing. Mail in voting has already proven unreliable. Not saying I agree with Trump. Just saying you’re stretching because it’s Trump. Besides we all need to #VoteGold and get the change we’ve been waiting for.

Not a Trump supporter but I hate politics in sports. Sports in an escape from politics something to take your mind away from all the things going on in the world.  Not a good decision
Did Brad Perscale have to give all the money back he took from the Trump campaign while driving Trump’s approval to 38%?
Im voting for Donald J Trump 2020
Im voting for Donald J Trump lets keep this goin
Hilarious! He should do stand up instead of be President. Trump the election clown. And the press falls for it every time.
Are you actually going to stand up to Trump if he tries to push this idea? I will you follow in line like you have every other time you've said you disagreed with something he did then did nothing but tweet about it?
Trump is president Republicans control the senate, trumps whole cabinet is hand picked so how are Democrat’s destroying anything? Everything going on is under his watch.
Trump is advocating bringing back racial and economic Red Lining to prevent people of color from acquiring homes in the suburbs. Blatant racism.
Look I have #MAGAts flag too, only to burn this trash 🗑 on November 3rd....Keep thinking 🤔 that everyone that has Trump sign/flag has his vote 🗳
Trump desperately wants to be a #dictator and it's amazing how many are okay with it. #DictatorTrump #TrumpThreatensAmerica #Trump #VetsAgainstTrump
Biden gave an interview in June where he said he thinks the military would escort Trump from the WH. I am skeptical; every right winger everywhere will scream bloody murder about a coup, and the military knows it.
Trump's own crony, Postmaster General Louis Dejoy, is the one wreaking this havoc with Trump's blessing!

HAPPENING NOW: DCRP releases a statement condemning President Trump’s call to delay the election.   “While we understand the concerns of holding safe elections this fall, there are many opportunities for those who cannot safely make it to the polls to include mail-in voting.”
What is Cornyn going to say when Trump will be asked about it later and he doubles and triples down.....  still kidding just to get a reaction?
If President Trump is going to delay the election he will need to get much of the U.S. military and the majority of police on board. It may work but a lot of blood will have to be spilled.
I'm thinking Portland is a just a test run for what Trump plans to roll out across the U.S. when he refuses to leave office.
New Daily Kos/Civiqs poll: Most Americans say they oppose Trump and almost nothing could change that
Sadly, the GOP is filled with cowards these days.  It’s just awful when the BEST case scenario is “they are being blackmailed by Trump into staying silent”.

YOU ARE GOING TO LOSE!! YOUR PITIFUL!! President Donald Trump floated delaying the November presidential election — which he can't do — warning that mail-in voting will create a "fraudulent election."  # via
What I don’t understand is how it’s so easy for trump supporters to know what news is fake and what news is real. According to him all news is fake just believe him. Everyone close to him ended up a convicted felon. That’s not fake news that’s a fact.
Want to know how safe #VoteByMail is? Oregon has been all-mail since 2000. They’ve cast over 100 MILLION ballots. The number of confirmed fraudulent votes is 12.   Voting by mail is safe. Utah is the same way.  Don’t get played by #Trump AGAIN! He knows it’s over.
The President made Herman sign a waiver for attending a rally because the President knew how dangerous it was. The President convinced ignorant people, like Cain, not to wear a mask. Trump jr is still saying they are overrated. The POTUS politicized masks for so long.

But Trump can’t even show up.  #VOTEHIMOUT
He is talking about the “silent majority” so when Russian hackers (already inside numerous swing state voting systems) change the outcome of what should be an overwhelming win for Joe Biden, people will actually believe there was a huge silent faction for Trump. See
Trump interview six hours from now: I was serious about delaying the election
You can save those people from becoming martyrs for the worst cause we’ve ever seen in US history- like Herman Cain.  /6  PS-why didn’t Trump give Cain some Hydroxchloriquisnakeoilbullshitagain?
He might have had strong opinions about COIVD back in March/Feb but has cooled off since originally thinking it was a political move to make Trump look bad. He’ll still make Hail Mary defenses and excuses for the GOP, but only when prompted or challenged when not in the mood. /5
I watched a guy remove his own Trump yard sign &amp; his car no longer has a Trump sticker.  Maybe we can save a few of these people- keep reaching out! The lives we save will be worth it. Conservative voices deserve to be heard, they just got conned by Trump. 1/

Another example of fake news trying to demonize the President.  He said he did not know about any of her other views on anything other than the drug.  He said that at the time and not afterwards.  I saw the tape.  The left wing press is aligned with the Democrats to defeat Trump.

Trump proposes delay federal elections until it's 'safe'—something he doesn't have the power to do
Someone with skin this thin, is not qualified to ask questions of people in power. No wonder they don't ask the questions that they know will anger president Trump.
Can you imagine how the several tens of thousands of families also grieving the preventable death of their loved ones feel as trump goes on saying it’s not bad and there’s a cure and listen to the devil sperm lady? But you’re feelings 😭
Trump's own crony, Postmaster General Louis Dejoy, is the one wreaking this havoc!
Yeah. I guess the thing for me is: Trump has been denouncing vote by mail for months now. That's not new. The new thing is him raising the threat of delaying the election. That requires a response.
Elections are safe. You can vote by mail and not even leave your house.   Trump is scared because he knows he about to lose
Yes, the Trump administration lied and made this worse. I’ve been listening to experts since the beginning and have heard how wearing a mask reduces the spread.
It's true that Trump makes most intelligent people go, "Jesus Christ," every time he talks.
#WeWillVote  It’s gonna be crazy to see how many solid red states turn blue. I’ve watched neighbors remove Trump signs from their own yards in Nebraska.  NEBRASKA! So...let’s hope everyone shows up or mails in their ballots!
So is today one of the first quantifiable cases of “someone died because of trump” or did that already start .... I wonder how many people have been affected by that Tulsa rally .
Any day is a good day to cam for Trump’s resignation!Too bad there is not teeth to these days.Waiting for the election and then swearing in of Joe Biden is too long especially given Trump’s fickleness.
So what your saying in a delicate way is "TRUMP CAN GO F'K HIMSELF"! I would agree with that.
The only retaliation is Trump refusing to honor a great American while serving as president.  Again, Herman Cain spread pain and suffering and died for it.   I’m sad, but in the same way I’m sad when someone loses a voluntary game of Russian Roulette.
. and  are one of the few bright spots of the horror show that is Trump. Oh, TikTok kids and KPop too.
