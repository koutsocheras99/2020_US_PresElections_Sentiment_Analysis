No, but with Trump trailing Biden by double digits in the polls there aren't a lot of takers for the role.
Barr and Trump will collude to cancel elections based on the pandemic emergency and voter fraud;  So Far Trump has committed close to 100 illegal acts and has gotten away with everyone of them.
caught on to my goal. If they think it comes from Trump they not take it.
i wonder how much less our country would hate if god hadn't invented fox news.  trump couldn't have happened w/o them.  fox was john the baptist paving the way for the self-proclaimed chosen one donald trump.  he's the immaculate conception that should make everybody pro choice.
Maxine is the woman who's wig is too tight!  Thanks to the magic of Trump Dynamite!
More like trump is trying to distract from the Maxwell documents.
OpEd by co-founder of the Federalist Society.  Wow.
Embattled surgeon Dr. David Samadi has a new gig on Long Island  via    One of the "Experts" Trump brought in. Now people can  decide if they want to get their COVID advice from the worlds leading authority in epidemics or an "Embattled urologist."
Honest and serious question: is anyone else having panic and anxiety attacks about our country and the current political events happening? I legit started crying today when trump tweeted he wants to delay the election. How do we keep our mental health intact w/ all of this?
Hope you're keeping that same energy for Trump not pushing back on Russia for putting bounties on the heads of our troops.
This a great audition for the part of Trump's #1 bootlicker in the Senate. I'm positive he's going to be getting a callback for the role.
The White House and some of its Republican allies in the Senate are signaling they want to extend, at least temporarily, the $600-per-week unemployment benefit.
Such leadership.  Nothing trump says means anything.
Gotta love it when Trump is so bad that liberals are praising a war criminal. 🤦‍♂️
You're such a cock   #TrumpIsARacist
Better yet, take your weekly approval of tRump. 😂😂😂
Trump 2020
Not shocking.  Just disgusting.
Clyburn has challenged President Trump and McConnell to prove they hold Lewis in the same light as hundreds of other politicians in the country and work to pass the bill.
Drunk veteran me almost flipped out, but then I finished reading. Yeah, fuck Trump. And thank God for good, old school reporters like Jake, and the honored dead of the fourth estate, who have sacrificed their lives for their nation and truth.
that'll be the most confusing thing when we look back on this.  how did trump and Russia actually convince some Americans to fight on the side of the virus?  no masks and demon sperm &gt; Fauci
Leave it to Trump's ambassador to mourn the closest thing to a Confederate statue in Europe.
It is a 2 partY system that works because it requires compromise. Don't do Trump wants you do and fall into the Bernie or bust mess.
I thought the standing president wasn't allowed to have a personal account, and that's just ignored for Trump for some reason
So that's worse then tRUMP using the Oval Office to self benefit himself and his entire family.  #Hypocrite
Yes!!! TRUMP 2020!!!
And 1/3rd of Trump’s power along with it.
It's the Trumpvirus. Nobody is more responsible for spreading it in the US than Dirty Don Trump.
Kansans in recent weeks have faced increasingly aggressive political messages about the race for the Kansas Senate seat.  This reporting from  and  adds context about what’s promoting those campaign texts and calls to voters.
If trump was confident he was gonna win, he would not be suggesting delaying the election. Or do you think he just wanted to say something stupid to distract from the worst GDP report in American history?
This is why we need to remove Dirty Don Trump and make sure similar scoundrels never get elected - so little guys like this can grow up in a decent, just and prosperous land.
And in the meantime whose paying? 🙋‍♀️ And we have no idea what amount were each paying and what we should get back and when. Shady ass business. His family’s whole fucking job. You ever read about Fred Trump? It’s easy to see where Don gets it from.....
Follow the bouncing endorsement:  If Trump stays neutral  If that hurts Roger Marshall &amp; helps Kris Kobach  If Kobach wins GOP #kssen   Then Trump helps elect Democrat Barbara Bollier Nov. 3  Awesome move, Ted Cruz
I asked both Roger Marshall and Kris Kobach about the Trump controvery this week on 4Star Politics...
Kobach was Trump’s only endorsement heading into the caucus in 2016.
Trump Virus.  Fixed.
Trump needs more white vote to win, not more black vote
Trump about 50%. Tea Pain will delete this poll. Bank on it.
Trump's campaign paid Brad Parscale's firm $94 million.
This is terrifying. It is now right out in the open. Dog whistles have become blaring megaphones. And now what everyone feared is spoken outloud. Barr, Pompeo &amp; trump will do everything they can to steal the upcoming election.
YOU wrote: "If Trump weren’t in office life would not have changed."  Uh ... no. Wrong.  The implication is that it is ALL about Trump and the tens of thousands of deaths in Spain, Italy, and Iran - before the virus came to the states - meant nothing.
But couldn’t be bothered to talk about it in front of a microphone out of all the other dumb shit we have to hear him say. The full truth would’ve been a nice change of pace. He ran a scam on his own country. Go Trump. 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
No. I never thought Mexico would pay shit. Trump would make us do it and try to put a bow on it and hope we’re stupid.
the gag is, Dems enable Trump, whereas Republicans opposed Obama and still got what they wanted. its almost like.. Democrats don’t really CARE about all they posture for, because the end result still directly benefits them  this cult mentality around Obama is why Biden is the nom
eight years as president. eight years.  and yet we act as if Trump can somehow supersede all process and authority to get his terrible shit done.  so that tells me he’s either full of shit, or Democrats aren’t HALF the “opposition party” or “resistance” that Republicans are. sad.
Your silence on trump is dereliction of duty.
Liar! You 100% support trump and all of his treasonous decisions.
Instead of Trump trying to extend the voting date, why doesn’t congress open voting for the whole week before the traditional voting day. Due to Covid and not having enough voting booths this is a viable solution.
Bull, you fully support tRump. He is your leader and your brand.
Opinion | Trump’s suggestion to delay the election is the most anti-democratic thing any president ever said - The Washington Post
Actually, it matters bc ppl mistakenly believe that Trump is an aberration, that he didn’t inherit much of his powers from prior presidents (including Obama). So just getting rid of Trump isn’t enough and thinking Biden will simply erase the Trump legacy is incredibly naive.
trump already turned the game off
Totally silent on Trump. Even today. This is why you will lose your seat. Kansas will not forget this.
That is cool. Also, a metaphor for the Trump administration and 2020!!
#maxwelldocuments  Hmmmmmm. Looks like Trump has always been a good guy!!
Covering Climate Now: The terms of the Paris climate accord mean no country can leave before November this year, so due to a quirk of timing, the US will officially exit the Paris deal on November 4 – just one day after the 2020 presidential election.

Damn Don,   Even your friends are your enemies.   ⁦  ⁦
A good friend was in a medically induced coma from early November 2016 until late January 2017. Coming out of it, she heard a news report about “President” Trump. She sat bolt upright and said “President???Trump??? What the fuck happened??” True story.
If only someone would have given him some hydroxychloroquine.     Why didn’t Trump tell them??
Im not confident Trump knows what the filibuster is...but the fundemental issue is one party has perserved a system that even though they receive fewer votes they remain in power. That isn’t democracy. Something must change.
Trump was up +2 in florida the day before the election
Did Ted Cruz convince Trump stay neutral in race between Kobach and Marshall?
James, it’s simple brother. It’s common sense. Biden is in bed with china, they tried to take out Trump, it didn’t work, so China unleashed the virus. They figured the people they were paying here weren’t getting the job done, so they did it themselves
Everyone compared to Trump is a strong man.
Let's remove Parson he's a racist and licking Trump's a** you have my vote!!!!!🥰🥰🥰🥰💯%
Hey Herman Cain died from going to a trump rally but let's open up all the schools.
This evil man must go. Please vote on November 3rd. Don’t. Let. Up. Trump floats election delay, lawmakers in both parties reject idea
God knows who's right (and it ain't Flynn/Trump)!
1/ Can you imagine if, when cases first started to appear in February, Trump had given an Oval Office address to the country and told us that this moment had to transcend politics and that he was appointing  to head up a task force to come up with recommendations?
45 drops out at the last minute to give GOP boost in votes w/ Pence.   Maybe enough to beat a candidate like Biden who’s best attribute is that he’s better than 45  Barr charges Trump with all of his crimes, Pence pardons him allowing him to keep his stolen $ and stay out of jail
When I see people who support trump and say don’t wear a mask
In KS here we'd like Kobach to win the primary b/c  would definitely win running against this nutball... who was Trumpy before Trump  But man hearing his racists ads just sends shivers down my spine
I think Mitt Romney was the turning point; financial parasites switched sides and joined Democrat. Big tech, woke capital, selling country to China, it was all written in by then, making Trump inevitable. I gotta even reevaluate Trump now. I still hate him, but nobody else acted.
Trump has taken a sledgehammer to democracy.  Ignoring everything in the constitution except the 2nd amendment; he would toss that one out the window too if more non white non Christian citizens were to exercise their rights.   To say Biden is a bigger threat is ludicrous.
He's trolling so as to elevate the seriousness of potential wide-spread election fraud with mail-in ballots.  It wasn't a serious suggestion.  Classic Trump technique, which of course triggers the Left's collective heads to explode.
Lol... everything trump touches fails. The only thing he had success at was reality TV 📺.  You elected Snooki
Donald Trump found out that couldn't was putting a bounty on American soldiers so they're going to have a date at patio pizza and talk about it.

let’s not add up all the different policy positions each of us are “with Trump” on
You’re also with Trump, who also wants to get rid of the filibuster.  FYI.
In a really like gay wapo editorial way I am upset with the United States The secretary of treasury under trump is literally a jewish movie producer
This is NOT a department of "Homeland" security rather a department of trump security. (Cue in Fox-not-news.)
Weird.  I guess you and Obama forgot when John McCain gave a 👎🏼 to stop Trump and the majority party’s attempt to undo the Affordable Care Act. 🤔
Yep...and remember when they ridiculed Pres Trump who forewarned about that very thing, early on in this "plandemic"...and said we had to be careful that "the cure was not worse than the virus". Once again, Pres Trump was RIGHT!!!
Donald Trump should resign. Pass it on.
Not sure why this week's  episode features an ad from  I'm in KS and the ad was pro-Kobach, "the first statewide elected official to endorse Donald Trump". I was like whhhaaaa?? Alie would not endorse this!
I think Trump might know more than you and I would know. You are not in politics for 34 years and innocent. Our Govt was not designed to operate this way. Too much Lobbyist money to be innocent &amp; in politics that long to stay innocent.
The right wing has resorted to: "Oh... come on! Trump does not mean any of the things trump says!!!"  And this is their DEFENSE of trump.
Its ok though, because nothing trump says means anything.
This game of "trump didn't suggest the thing that trump suggested" is petty and pathetic.  Your tortured defense of a man with absolutely ZERO character is disheartening.
Democrat ballot harvesting?  You are no better than tRump.
Conservatives are now melting down about the nfl, mlb, and the nfl. You know that saying how if you run into assholes all day that you might be the asshole? Now that they don’t have sports all they have is trump. It’s gonna get worse.
I disagree. Haven’t we learned how much smoke he blows? The results will be convincing (Biden wins by at least 5 points) and Trump exits stage left.
You're absolutely right: Nothing trump says means anything.
Worse excuse of a man,That could not even walk away without being a Traitor &amp; Committing Treason on his own Country. So angry because not only did they lose. They even got caught cheating &amp; Spying. And They still Lost. They blame Trump &amp; the voters. For what the did to themselves
What's going on because I have already started my wine a hour ago. I can't take this waiting around for some good trouble against Trump and any other crooked Republican senators.
The elite hang together.  They cover up for each other.  Clinton is guilty.  Trump is guilty.  Hanks is guilty. Winfrey is guilty. Gates is guilty.  The list goes on.   It’s the elite and then the rest of us.  If you impede or mess with the elites bottom line, look OUT!!
Lol. Nope Trump does not.  But neither did
No, they're not. You need to look up what a red herring actually is. And we're not helping Trump, Joe Biden and the Democrats are.
The current KKK showed out for Trump in Charlotte and other places.  Nazi white supremacists were called "good people" by Trump.
So, FLOUTS renegotiated her contract with trump... I think it has something to do with being a couple. Anyway....!  How much will she get when she sues...?    trump must be scared out of his wig.
It is not  called China Virus!  I think we should call it the Trump Virus!
idk about y’all but i will be looking back fondly on our time with president Trump once the mole people successfully undermine the 2040 election and president Dirt Diggler takes power
I am not saying I agree with Trump.. im just clarifying the words he said without inserting my own perception of what they mean.
Trump is an a-hole joke, Biden is terrifying.
So much more Presidential that tRump already.
Doesn’t he think Trump isn’t that bad?
Trump listened to the Fuhrer and this is what happens. I imagine that many in his base that went to the rally will get COVID-19 as well. Who knows... some may die. A lesson is here for all... Don’t listen to Trump you just might die.

Opinion | What a tremendous burden it must be for you to still be defending Donald Trump - The Washington Post
They won't be sorry because Trump backs all the people. Where as the Democrats agree with Muslims &amp; Make no mistake The Muslims do what Allah says &amp; Which is no Homosexual or Lesbian.
You do realize that criticism of Obama doesn’t equal support for Trump, yeah?
I love how you think criticism of Obama = support for Trump. Can you not see beyond tribalistic partisanship?
I always give Trump a pass when he slurs his words because he's working 24/7 and is tired from talking all day. Biden does max 25 minutes and gafs it Everytime
He was on video in 2016 election memeing irl about how Trump will complete the philosophy of German idealism and raise Thule. It was pretty funny tbh and the reporter and ppl around him had no idea what he was talking about. I have faith he'll get his shit together

Trump is no conservative.   Your party was hijacked by an absent minded fool who thinks he knows better then every expert on every subject he has ever talked about.  Trump is a danger to everyone, especially the GOP.
Herman Cain died from Coronavirus. A great time for Trump to remind the public of just how deadly it can be. He didn’t even mention it.

If you were to squeeze Trump's 'big' brain with a vice the only things that would ease out of his ears is tough talk, bullsh!t and lies He's not very complicated
Trump admin openened an investigation into voter fraud, they found nothing. Millions &amp; millions already vote my mail. They found nothing. There is a pandemic, 150,000 dead &amp; surging, &amp;  would rather risk American lives than risk a fair election! Beyond disturbing.
If  is Biden’s VP choice, I will be SO EXCITED TO VOTE FOR BIDEN. If she’s not, I’ll still vote for Biden because, you know, he’s not Trump. I said what I said.

Millions of Americans became insured under Obama. Before Obama I had no access to healthcare. Now Trump has destroyed that system. As a single male I pay $650/month with $8,000 deductible. Trump has made ACA unaffordable to many. Where the eff is his "cheaper, better" healthcare?
Trump is done. If the GOP doesn't start standing up to Trump and take your party back, it will be a very long time before Republicans have any power again. You reap what you sow.

Thank you, President Trump!
He full of threats b/c he’s so desperate he’ll try to abuse his power.  He’s too unstable, to trust. He should have been impeached when they had the chance. There’s been so much corruption and obstruction of justice, within the Trump Gov’t, it’s hard to keep up.
There’s are protests not riots.  Trump keeps telling everyone that it’s way worse than it is.  He said my city was a mess and would have to have Federal Troops sent in.  We are not a mess, Trump lies.  It’s all he can do is lie.
Trump has stock in it. Why else would he be pushing it for months? So tired of it all. The election couldn't come sooner.
I can only 'watch' trump thru his threads. It's like a sterile filter. Now, next year I will continue to follow Aaron bc his daughter.
But supporting Trump is supporting the swamp-expansion project. I’m confused.

Donald Trump doesn’t know what he wants. He doesn’t really know reality. He just says whatever flows from his lips. But his GOP followers lap it up no matter what it is and no matter how farcical

Just remember if Biden happens to win, we need to treat him with the same respect and optimism that the left has treated Trump with.  It’s only fair to match their class.
Wondering if Republicans still think it’s treasonous to propose delaying the election...
Very sorry for Mr. Cain's family.  People said Trump's Tulsa rally was a failure because of low turnout.  Can you imagine the catastrophe if the place had been filled to capacity?   Looks like the TikTokkers may have save some lives, eh?
Is Trump drunk?? #orangevillan
What about the money that was given to millionaires? Kanye West, Elaine Cho's family for example! What about mail in ballots????? What about stop kissing Trump's butt? The buck stops with you for Missouri!!!
Unlike Donald Trump, our US Mail personnel are people of integrity and honor.
Trump needs to stop beating around the bush.😂 .
Really? Your "experts" said millions would die if Trump didn't act.  He did. Only thousands died.  You should be praising him.  #MAGA2020 right?
Trump: "U r sending out HUNDREDS of MILLIONS of mail-in ballots and the democrats know this Steve, the democrats know this...I want an election more than u but u have the fake polls and we have the REAL polls and I think we're doing really well."  We only have 350M people..WTF?😳
You are replying to a "petty" dem, who is arguing with a petty Trump. 🤪
I love President Trump, you’re coming back!!
I would ask Trump one question during a press conference.  “Why is every sentence you say a lie?” #TrumpIsANationalDisgrace #trumppresser
We have a state-wide mandate here in Kansas, TeeKay, thanks to our great governor and have not noticed that at all simply bc it's the LAW of the State.   Can u imagine how many lives could've been saved if Trump issued a NATION-WIDE mandate back in March, when he should have?😳
Trump has been president for almost 4 whole years. Why isn't freedom here yet?!
Trump is a pathological liar. He has to be to make up for his utter ignorance and natural tendency to cheat. The TrumpVirus rages across America due to his utter incompetence; Russian put bounties on our troops and he says nothing to stop it. He is an astoundingly bad president.
Trump is rambling and lying as usual so it's a waste of time.
It’s failing me? Lol. Ok you keep throwing assumptions on me so let me try.  You think I want COVID to kill people because I think that will cost Trump the election, right? Or I want the country to stay locked down cuz thatll make him lose?
I feel great! I knew 20 years ago the trump was a criminal bully. He fooled stupid people then and is doing it now. I feel sorry got you  and your family.
FAKE NEWS!!!  HER REAL BOYFRIEND IS DONALD TRUMP
4 American Presidents; Obama, Clinton, Bush, and Carter...were ALL HEARD today at John Lewis's funeral ceremony.  And they ALL were speaking about what this nation SHOULD BE doing, rather than what we ARE doing.  In simpler terms, they eviscerated Trump into a pathetic PULP.🤣👍
Petty dumbfuck trump tried to hijack Obama's eulogy of John Lewis by calling for an unscheduled press conference. CHRIST WHAT AN ASSHOLE. How can people condone this childish behavior?
i stopped following Trump months ago ,I realized I didnt need the aggravation
The people who cheer when I criticize Trump, fascists and bigots who involve themselves in other people's lives are gonne be upset when I also denounce socialism, attempts to circumvent the 2nd ammendment, and extreme taxation. News flash: I'm not a D or an R. I'm a Libertarian
Based on the GOP’s unwillingness to fight for almost anything I would rather get rid of the GOP than the President   It’s why I contribute to President Trump but NOT the GOP  Just Sayin
I heard or read this some time ago as trump has been asked this question multiple times. Like I said, better at math. Had I spent less time in the principal’s office I could have learned more. Teacher’s fault.🙄
Who thinks trump will look fetching in an orange jump suit?
Trump wants to kill USPS so that all the private mailing companies he has stock in will skyrocket. He literally only cares about himself and y’all want to re-elect him because “BiDeN iS dUmB aNd oLd”
Why has corrupt president trump still not addressed Russian bounties on American soldiers? Shame on all that ignore trumps crimes.
Take some no doze and wake up tRump. #AmericaOrTrump
Tom, isn't it reall a 24/7 show at this point? You know that line by Lloyd Bridges in "Airplane", "I picked a bad day to stop sniffing glue?". If Trump wins, I'm going to start.
I will never be able to square the circle on this, but Trump is a well-known germaphobe. How the shit did he flip the stance, just within his own head?
ROAST OBAMA FOR HAVING A LITERAL HATE TRUMP SPEECH AT A FUNERAL
Trump is very solemn in this press breifing  Cases up around the 🌎
Trump is attempting to read some wars. Turns quickly to word salad lies.
Not one legitimate source for flight logs and even on your fake flight logs, Obama hasn’t been listed.   Trump on the other hand has been photographed with Epstein dozens of times. But y’all don’t talk about that.
WATCH LIVE: President Trump talks from the White House.
Trump is going to be so, so small in this press conference. Obama's shadow today is far too long. Whatever Trump tries to do to steal the spotlight will be even more pathetic, especially if he comes out to pat himself on the back. Which...he will.
LAW AND ORDER! Trump 2020!
Nikki Haley has become very vocal lately. I'm wondering if the fix is in for trump to resign "due to health issues" and RNC selects Nikki, thinking a woman will draw Democrat women?  Not really wondering this - trump's desperate to win to stay out of jail
Trump 2020!
Trump dilly- dallied and denied that the TrumpVirus would be serious, that it would just disappear. He had disbanded the Pandemic Alert Team. He sent 8 tons of PPE to China and said China was doing a good job. He continues to confuse the public about masks &amp; medications.
But I wonder what the result would've been had the Democrat candidate been a man?  A lot of those trump votes were anti Hillary and anti woman
Thank you, Gregory. Trump doesn’t want to nor does he posses the ability to govern .
I will bet a lot of money on No!!
If Democrats are for it, I’m against it..... if Democrats are against it, I’m for it
True. The radical left is messing up the vote. I sure hope President Trump can win anyway.  It would only be fair.
The radical left is deliberately messing up the mail. They dream up messes to make - to try to blame other people, like President Trump.
So you still thing Trump is the issue? Why are  all complete morons?
... but instead, the President, Donald J. Trump, is out getting fucked by Russia. This is the man we chose, but unlike Melania – we won't choose to keep him. I don't know about you, but I won't be #dyingfortrump on Nov. 3rd. #VoteBiden2020 #Biden2020
All of America feels like Melania Trump must have felt in 2006 – a time when she needed her husband most. At home Melania sat, alone &amp; pregnant with Donald's 5th child, while he was out screwing a porn star. 14 years later, America needs presidential leadership now more than ever
'We will not allow you': Governors slam Trump for floating delay of presidential election  via
LMFAO... Did trump take down his "delay the election" tweet?  Someone must have paraphrased the Constitution to him
#ObamaWasABigMistake.  President Trump is the best president ever.
To be clear, Trump is not wanting to delay the election due to safety concerns. He wants to delay the election because he hopes a vaccine will be put out on the market and ultimately turn his bad polling around. It's endless political corruption from this administration.
Thank God we have Donald Trump to in no way try and profit from his political position, right?
This idiot, Biden isn't 1/10th the man  Trump is, and  you know it! There is no chance Biden wins in a fair election. AND, that is why you intend to cheat with mail in voting! #GruberLibs
As the  pointed out in May, "Trump Keeps Taking Pages from Joe McCarthy's Playbook." Are you tired of this? If so, please vote, thanks.
Number 3...to take away from the John Lewis funerals and Obama’s eulogy. That’s Racist 101 from the Trump playbook.
Lol. Way to change the topic from how Trump’s virus is killing his own supporters and brought about the complete destruction of the American economy.m
Top political editor at Fox News: Trump asking to delay election a ‘flagrant expression of his weakness’    Hey , Fox....Trumps entire presidency is an expression of his weakness. But thanks for  finally   noticing

Trump is squandering a chance to unify the country. Instead he leads with “ the democrats who run these major cities....”. I think he could be right BUT people shut down when it’s such an antogonostoc tone. That’s a bully not a leader.

Paging SEC investigators.  Why in the hell is Kodak, of all companies, receiving money to manufacture COVID drugs?  Could the fact that it's stock price rose 400% in a day after receiving a $765mm loan from the Trump administration have something to do with "why"?  Unreal!
Voters are concerned that Trump’s new Postmaster General will find a way to lose the ballots before they get back to election officials. Trump has already said this will be the most rigged election ever and will do everything he can to prove it.
I estimated nothing. And Trump himself went up to 2,000,000 when he started inching up on his previous 100,000. Then he throws out 2,000,000 cuz he knows we won’t get to that ridiculous number then later he can say “look how much I cut down from the expected 2M!”
Another proud Trump University graduate
Pence is one of the most insincere speakers in the world, surpassed only by Donald Trump himself. Take their microphones away.

People, this is the only thing el trumpo is good at: misdirection. Stop falling for this stuff. He wants attention away from deaths&amp; horrible economic news. Trump, who lacks the authority to do so, suggests delaying the election  via
Blatantly moving our country backwards. I’m reading ‘The Color of Law’ (you should too) and it’s an ugly but important history related to this topic. If you’re in the MAGA crowd just know that his ‘great again’ means back to division/disadvantage for many.
Preach it, Pete. Don't let Trump distract. Putin is calling the shots here anyway, not Trump. Trump is the latest Benedict Arnold and needs to be imprisoned for treason!
So Trump thinks we should delay the election. More advice from his mentor Putin?
If Trump attempts to remain in office upon losing the election, citizens will take to the streets en masse. I have already lived most of the life that I have on this earth. If it comes down to it, I will gladly take to the streets. 1/2
Wait, don’t you get paid by Soros? Why would Trump take responsibility?
This is more than he said about John Lewis.   Maybe that’s because Cain died because of Trump. Just add him to the list...
Only in America have we seen Donald Trump’s lack of leadership lead us to most cases and most deaths of any country in the world. Pence waves his arms and praises an incompetent president like this is a good thing.
Tough guy, who’s a “reply guy” to Trump and thinks he’s smart, blocks people for not accepting his soft minded group think! Btw,  we are still waiting for for proof of Russian Collusion?
trump set the no mask culture, but Cain was a grown man - he could've chosen responsibly
Yes. In the age of tRump it certainly is.
I'm kinda sick of  bitching and moaning about how awful tRump is when it was assholes like him and  who got us to a point where Donald tRump could steal power after losing the actual election by nearly 3million votes because Russia manipulated the e.c.

Your bizarre attack on Joe Biden in the primaries could have damaged our chances to beat Trump. Based on this, it seems you are not disciplined or dedicated enough to be the VP pick.  You seem more like a selfish opportunist than a future potus.
I already told Trump that there is a special place in hell for him! That's why he turn the Bible upside down
I will make sure that Putin doesn't interfere this time. God got this. Trump will not win. He will fall upon his own sword before he wins
That was Trump; our authoritarian, Fascist president. Trump doing worse things than Obama doesn’t mean that Obama didn’t do anything bad. My point is to get ppl to see that it’s the nature of the Presidency itself, not simply the individual presidents, that are the problem.
Trump is a pedophile I guess!!!

It’s hard sleeping at night when there’s so many trump supporters in my family 🥴
Trump did it.
They are simply a part of a propaganda machine being used by the Trump administration and campaign to inflate Trump's ego, while attempting to discredit Fauci because Trump was jealous of him, and give Trump public support to reopen completely. Against the advice of doctors.

It would be good for the corrupt   to cut their losses and separate themselves from Trump or their entire party will burn down this November.
and which do us fit into that supported what Trump was doing?
I believe it’s real but here are some alternative theories: 1. Zoom stakeholders wanted to ⬆️their yields 2. China is sick of America’s shit and wanted to laugh at us 3. Putin is mad that trump was impeached and unleashed hell  4. KU was trying to cover up their b-ball scandal
When had A presidential election ever been postponed delayed????? Never ! Trump is an idiot! His days are numbered
U know Trump endorses her right?
However, here he is standing with this alliance, claiming that we need to send our kids to school during this pandemic, just as Trump has said. Hamilton said, "We need to not act out of fear, we need to act out of science." As she stands with other physicians who say don't wear
So Trump really feels like his supporters are "balls deep" in their sisters? What a sick, sick man. That is the leader Evangelicals want to follow? The man the Christian Right has faith in? He's more like the Beast. More intent on killing Americans than leading and saving us.

So much more Presidential that tRump already.
Two choices. Joe Biden is Nostradamus, which would be a good characteristic for a president, or Donald Trump is incredibly predictable anytime but particularly when backed into a corner.
Millions of Americans became insured under Obama. Before Obama I had no access to healthcare. Now Trump has destroyed that system. As a single male I pay $650/month with $8,000 deductible. Trump has made ACA unaffordable to many. Where the eff is his "cheaper, better" healthcare?
Thank you, President Trump!
He full of threats b/c he’s so desperate he’ll try to abuse his power.  He’s too unstable, to trust. He should have been impeached when they had the chance. There’s been so much corruption and obstruction of justice, within the Trump Gov’t, it’s hard to keep up.
Trump has stock in it. Why else would he be pushing it for months? So tired of it all. The election couldn't come sooner.
But supporting Trump is supporting the swamp-expansion project. I’m confused.
Donald Trump doesn’t know what he wants. He doesn’t really know reality. He just says whatever flows from his lips. But his GOP followers lap it up no matter what it is and no matter how farcical
If course trump calls on oan reporter so he can talk about how lucky Portland is trying have feds there
It was all under Trump's guidance.   Had Trump banned flights from Europe at start of the virus spread, NY wouldn't have been seeded so much with the virus.   Had Trump prepared months earlier &amp; gotten enough tests for the country, virus in NYC would have been contained.
You are caving under the pressure of Trump and his cronies. How disappointing. What happened to your backbone?
Are we living in same country? Job prosperity plans - never implemented in 3 1/2 yrs. Billions in drug money? Where? What happened to it? Human &amp; child trafficking arrests - why haven’t I seen this or heard trump talk about rescues / sentences. Guess you’re not pro-life.

He knows whats going on is bullshit. It’s all a game and he knows what the media reaction will be. I follow economists that have predicted a ton of events including last election. Algo’s all saying Trump in a landslide. Social media algo also knows which is why all the censoring.
He got sick within the incubation period after having attended Trump’s pathetic Tulsa Rally with no mask. He was an anti-masker.
I asked in another thread if this was on video. The Secretary of State refuses to answer a simple question on Presidential authority to which we all know the answer. Trump can't delay the election but what could the entire GOP &amp; their 40% of Americans due collectively you think?
Trump stans crack me up.
The Constitution specifies that the Speaker of the House becomes acting President due to a delayed Election. As commander-in-chief, Pelosi could send the military to pull Trump out of the White House.
Trump can only be Trump with a supporting cast of a enablers. Mr. Cain chose his path and my thoughts are with the heartbroken family members he left behind.
I’m also noticing a lot more desperation from demoratic socialists as well. Bashing Biden and the DNC while praising Trump...
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 Waiting to catch a glimpse of Donald Trump?  😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
There's some irony to be mined from the fact that Herman Cain was killed by a Democratic Hoax he caught at a trump rally.
This implies that Trump knew who Herman Cain was, A level of attachment, totally false.  To trump he was just another mindless follower. And he will not give him another thought.
A Closer Look at Melania Trump’s Latest Cause: A Makeover of the White House Rose Garden
A lot of people on this site are saying to ignore Trump on this and it is just a distraction. Pompeo just told you that is wrong. They are 100% looking into this. We are witnessing a government taking a turn into fascism in real time.
It’s called “TRUMP VIRUS”  Thank you 👍🏻
Aw one of the coons dancing at the trump rally got corona virus and died?
He had attended the Tulsa Trump rally
Starting to think that #NFLTop100 putting Mahomes at 4 is the greatest gaslighting we've seen since the last time Trump tweeted out any of his vast conspiracy theories
It's insinuated by including both facts in the same tweet. If we are going to protect journalistic integrity (which Trump is trying to destroy), I just feel we should be careful not to give POTUS ammo for his "fake news" tirades...
He put himself at risk and his loved ones, just because Trump said Tulsa wasn’t a concern.
So the  is reporting he contracted it at the rally? If that's true, absolutely should be a news story. If not, than as a professional #journalist shouldn't you be careful with the speculation? Isn't this the thing we blast Trump for?
*Major Trump Virus
Should have been Trump.
The fact that that’s said out loud is so disturbing.  Knowledge of Trump's corruption is obvious but he’s still the president?  The election that put him in the WH was rigged and truth be known, Hillary Clinton is the true President.
Because they hate Trump. Period
Nope... and we all glad u do not have a #medicallicense ... is the PhD you claim to have from trump university?
Yeah right!!  Because America wants to delay getting rid of Trump! 🙄
Fact checked..true quote.. "Donald Trump was the dumbest g**&amp;***d student I ever had"..
imo Trump is trying to create chaos  and division in America by sending in Fed troops to cities and stoking fear.  Please continue peaceful protest, identify and discourage the outside agitators and we can get through Trump's last attempts at stealing an election.
Lest we forget, Cain came down with COVID right after attending Drumph’s Tulsa “rally.” Trump and MAGA stupidity killed this man.   Former Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain dies after battle with COVID-19  via
These ppl out here blaming Trump for EVERY thing!!!  Can you media types just stop with the narrative push for one fucking minute?!?!?  #TDS
And Trump thought Tulsa was a good idea.  It’s too bad Mr Cain didn’t think about the dangers.
Sad. Hope showing out for Trump was worth it
Democrats: we should think about moving the presidential election to a different day Republicans: that's ridiculous Trump: it might be a good idea to move the election up a day or two Republicans:
Donald Trump should resign. Pass it on.
It should be Trump.
That’s just it, Republicans shouldn’t be in office. Especially, with Trump at the helm!  Common trust &amp; decency have left, a once beautiful America.
You’re a little late, Trump’s been handing us to Putin since that first Oval Office mtg w/ Russians when he was sworn in.
Biden predicted in April that Trump would try to delay the election. April Response-Trump campaign spokesman Tim Murtaugh dismissed Biden's remarks Friday as "the incoherent, conspiracy theory ramblings of a lost candidate who is out of touch with reality."  Really now?
Trump game plan: “DEFLECTION”!  Like we haven’t figured out this game plan after 4 years of his fetid crap.
“Protect” is open to interpretation. How many times have agents been sent in against graffiti? Against protests in past years (1968? 1972?) that involved fed property? Trump’s “protect” = go provoke riots so I have reason to call off elections. And kill /maime while doing so.
Anyone still think Trump will exit quietly?
Say it again, Joe. April 2020:  Biden accuses Trump of trying to delay election
Trump has broken the law at least once a week since he took office. He knows he can’t legally delay the election, but he can declare a national emergency and issue an Executive Order to delay election which insures it will be tied up in courts for weeks or months. #CorruptTrump
Trump floats election 'delay' amid claims of voting fraud (from  Obviosly Trump has never read the US Constitution, he has no powers to delay either a vote or the inauguration #dumptrump
TRUMP VIRUS  Fixed.
It's a smear campaign against President Trump   Democrats in power and behind the scenes are praying for higher death counts.    They are sick!
Mr. Trump has 84M followers. The other guy has less than 800K. I don’t think that is a valid comparison.
Yep.  I am one of them .  Who else is with me?  Trailing badly in polls, Trump points to ‘hidden’ voters and the ‘silent majority’ as path to victory
You act like the only public housing has to resemble tenement housing or a trump property, underfunded and falling apart.  A responsible housing policy involves providing a home someone can be proud to live in and give them the confidence and self pride to better themselves.
It amazes me how lazy these GOP candidates are.  Each one of them are simply hooking their wagon to the Trump crazy train and calling it a campaign. No original thoughts or plans from what I can see.
$100,000 to sit with Trump? How much do you need to pony up for a hooker to piss on him?
Trump still worse.  He doesn't wear a mask   😎

Hoping that #Sharpton will give the eulogy for #BernellTremmell .  Pretty much crickets from  , #BLM, #SPLC, and ALL THE HACKS in the #MSM.  It’s as if, HIS black life didn’t matter because he was a #Trump supporter. Odd, the narrative. Or lack, thereof.  Some lives.
DJT had Another chance to do the right thing. Another failure, in a long line of failures. John Lewis was a Great man. Trump is a petty one, at best, who shows little respect for women and people of color. It’s embarrassing.
Their belief that they can yell/talk over opposition all the while, #fingerWagging and #AirStabbing.  Or using poor sales tactics:  “We all know this is not the case”. . .”We can all agree that healthcare for all is. . .”.  “Trump has caused more ______and the R’s ______ so”.
Gosh. When did we last have a VP who wasn't ambitious? Pence has ambitions of a cozy life deep in trump's ass. Biden clearly had ambitions. Cheney was a fucking megalomaniac. Gore wanted to be POTUS. So did Quayle. Why, this almost sounds like racist/misogynistic bullshit.
Oh deal lord, if I didn’t agree with your politics I’d assume you were a trump supporter...
Thoughts on this???? High on independents low on dems and Republicans.
YMCA as Trump exits. This has to be clipped for your show!
Ok, sooooo.........we can either physically INJECT ourselves with the coronavirus PLAGUE....  Orrrrrr......we can just all go to see Trump maskless and stand right next to each other within breathing range.  Take ur fucking pick.😳
You don't even make sense as usual. When did New Yorkers flee New York?   The virus spread is due to Trump not locking down the US soon enough. Trump allowed flights from Europe to New York which seeded the virus in New York. All the while claiming this will be over by Easter.
I’m luvin Biden’s campaign team right now bc they’re ostensibly advising him to “lay low” and see just how far Trump can sink himself.🧐👍
First you want troops in Michigan, but condone same BLM behavior, now want to put Trump followers in jail. Do you hear yourself. Wait till Trump wins again. Then what.

The  is giving GOP senators no incentive to vote against Trump’s next SC nominee.
“Too many of the Republicans were focused on playing put upon and abused. They seemed more interested in Trump Jr.’s Twitter habit and throwing out accusations of anti-Americanism at the only executive of color testifying.”
Trump is dishonest, corrupt and incompetent. Because of this no one trusts anything coming out of the Trump Administration. No one has any reason to believe the CDC and FDA will be allowed to function without Trump’s interference.
Trump is the reason a vaccine will not be trusted. In March he was insisting on a vaccine in weeks, even as CDC and FDA officials explained a safe vaccine would take 12-18 months. Trump has already contracted for millions of doses of a vaccine not even tested yet.
Well u can’t really argue with her that “Reptilians r in control”...I mean, that would certainly explain Trump’s senior writer and “kids in cages” architect, Stephen Miller.😳
It’s from the RNC. I think it’s a good experiment. But I’m not buying these results. Trump is trying to destroy the post office. It needs to come from an independent source for me to buy it.
Apparently an arrest and they did it very quick without squad cars.  Your just never happy and want a a SOCIALIST FASCIST STATE like the rest of you Democrats! #Orwellian   President Trump believes in Freedom if Soeech and #USConstitution
I remember this and have been thinking about it for some time. If EVERY person were to ask these questions and answers them HONESTLY, there is no one that could vote for trump.
Donald Trump makes me furious that I don't believe in hell.
Truth. And Trump would have been molesting the underage teen girls for sure-never would have lasted.
My friend lives in PA, in Philly, and he sees many Trump 2020 flags and signs everywhere. He says he sees 3 Biden signs out of 100 political flags of either Trump or Biden. And a majority of his friends are Trump supporters.
Trump had this doctor speak about COVID and she said all this dumb shit. Turns out she believes in demon semen too??

You mean Trump?  I mean for most people across the country, the results are taking at least a week.
Great point.  Thank you for making it.  I'd suspect Calabresi is just trying to stake out an early position of, "I had changed my mind on Trump."  He doesn't really want impeachment.  If he is serious, he should put his political capital on the line and bring 20 R Sens.
Um no you won't.  That's why you've tried to postpone it.  No Fuhrer Trump, your days are numbered.
At his press briefing, Trump said that the "China Virus" killed Herman Cain. Nah. If the popular vote mattered, Herman Cain would still be alive.
Kansas congressional delegation mostly silent on Trump’s call to delay Nov. 3 general election #ksleg
A statement that is both 100% true and paradoxical at the same time (since Trump would have never suggested delaying the election if he was winning). 🤔
He's just trying stake his early claim to the anti-Trump territory.  FTG
Way too little, way too late.  Hurd knows good and well what is going on and how dangerous Trump really is.    Now he is trying to exit stage quietly just like Paul Ryan.

Trump is pissing himself right now
Donald Trump tests everyone he comes in contact with. School teachers should have the same capability. Trump tests but doesn't care if anyone else can.
Trump's ego and lack of leadership is killing a bunch of people. Tracing Herman Cain's death back to Trump's actions doesn't require much fancy CSI technology.
I also think it's probably "none." I just don't see this country sending a former president to prison. Not even one as shitty as trump. I was wondering what others think.
What are the chances of trump ever seeing the inside of a prison?
You do realize Trump was trolling the Lefties...right?
When Trump was named GOP presidential candidate in 2016.
Yeah. The second worse outcome to Trump winning/refusing to leave office if he loses in November is that we'll have to deal with him as a major player and media influencer that will have a lot of soft power even of he's not President.
Republicans:  Herman Cain, dead after attending Trump rally.  Ari Fleischer, Henry Olsen &amp; "Trump War Room", who slammed Biden for saying Trump would try to delay the election.  Trump destroys everything he touches -- including your lives, careers &amp; reputations. Save yourselves.
Let’s see, there is no law stating that I have to go to a polling station to vote. Therefore I can vote by mail if I choose. I have done it before and I can do it again. Trump had no right nor the power to change elections.
all of these recent events politically/socially give me more of a French Revolution feel rather than an American Rev vibe. it's kind of trump's "let them eat cake" moment. you feel me? #TrumpIsNotWell
So hey... back in April, you posted this.   Given #DementiaDonny's tweet from earlier today, I'd have thought you'd go back and delete it, to avoid looking like idiots.  Guess not.  It appears that Trump isn't sending us his best people.
that's what trump said about Cain? but he couldn't pay simple condolences to John Lewis? SMMFH what a bitch.
Remain Cain chose to go to a trump rally without social distancing and without wearing a mask. Not to speak I'll of the dead, but he made his own choices.

That’s gibberish John shut up and watch the deal trump 2020
Do liberals think the constitution has some kind of intrinsic power?   That it’s gonna come to life like a Gundam and remove Trump from office on Jan 20th no matter what?
Any doubt now that Trump's Tulsa debacle has chalked up at least one fatality?    Everything Trump touches dies.
Cain contracted COVID-19 shortly after attending Trump's Tulsa rally.
Trump should be held partially responsible for the death of Herman Cain

In an opinion piece in today's  Jennifer Weiner describes Trump's appeal to "suburban housewives" as not just a racist dog whistle, but "someone on the porch bellowing, here Fido."
Biden can't get distracted by the 100s of other things that Trump has done wrong. He needs to focus on the U.S.'s relative failure to handle COVID-19 when compared to every other nation. Discussing issues like troops in Germany, the suburbs, or Portland plays into Trump's hands.

good move, bad reasoning -- as with quite a few decisions Trump has made with respect to the military
It is probably Trump’s stockpiled hydroxychloroquine in injection form. He has to get his money back somehow. Putin said,”Donald, don’t worry, just crush it and shoot it. You can count on me.”

President Trump's repeated suggestion the election will be rigged with all the "mail-in ballots" got me to thinking. Why not immediately activate the National Guard in each state to oversee this presidential election and ensure no one will be able claim it was rigged?
Jene Magania (Biden) speaks vaguely on immigration, diversity, Trump.  Rev. Wendell Anthony (Biden), pres of NAACP branch, endorses Dem platform.  Anastasia Somoza (Biden): 30th anniv of Am Disabilities Act. Every issue is a disabilities issue. Support caretakers/home services.
Our "President" is 74 years old and crying about Twitter. 150 thousand dead in his country from Covid. But to Donny his feelings Trump American lives.

No joke. The new postmaster General is a Trump toadie and it sure seems he’s intentionally disrupting mail streams so people won’t trust mail-in ballots or they won’t be delivered in time to count.
Biden person (Nina Hachigian, deputy mayor of int'l affairs) blabbering fluff about "universal values" in foreign policy: "reinvention of American leadership" and "renewal at home" and "America will be America once again" and accusing Trump of letting "China fill the void"

Co-Chair Julie Chavez Rodriguez just referred to this as "President Trump's recession." I just want to be clear that this recession has been building for years and it's because of Dems and Repubs alike making this country work for their donors, not their constituents.
Now Tom is just lamely dunking on Trump, which, let's be honest, is the Dems' only platform
blah blah blah.  Like Trump, no sense of modeling behavior. #kssen
If you read the revised pre-nup you will see Trump did, in fact, promise Melania a rose garden.
She may not sway any active military, but she might make a difference w/ veterans. Trump always champions "Choice" as his big legislative success (even though it was Obama's). Duckworth is the only person who can effectively attack his veteran's "accomplishments", imho.
Maybe I'm too optimistic, but I don't think Duckworth can be Swiftboated. And she has a legislative record and knowledge about veteran's issues that make her harder to attack. And as much as I like Warren (which is a lot), Trump's racial attacks against her have worked before.
Fwiw, Duckworth is the one that coined the label "Cadet Bone Spurs," is a genuine hero who highlights Trump's chickenhawk faux-toughness, and embarrassed a Trump-lite candidate Mark Kirk to win her Senate seat.
Today is the first day since June 2016 that I feel like Trump has only a 50% chance of winning the next election.  I hope that number decreases substantially by November.
YOU look at the data. Sex trafficking arrests are DOWN under trump. Every time a republican is accused of being a child fucker who do you people protect? The child fucker. Of Clinton is a child fucker he can rot in prison. If Obama is a child fucker he can rot in prison. 🙄

And? trump would still be cheating contractors out of their pay and laundering Russian mob money and raping children if he wasn’t in office too. CNN helped elect him by not reporting on his criminality before the election. Hopefully he’ll go to prison when we boot him out.

Seriously? One day we will call you collaborators. Millions of Democrats coming over to support Trump and you all supposed conservative's expose the lie you have been telling. That is a blessing.
The apportionment impact of this seems small, and Trump's position is likely more about virtue signaling to Rs. Of bigger impact might be R proposals from recent years to not count non-citizens and/or non-voters in drawing district lines, even if they're counted in apportionment.

Trump will expose a lot of these celebrities and politicians
If you voting for joe Biden. Just watch his last few debates. He’s not fit to run. A real racist. 1993 crime bill was made by him to jail blacks. Trump fought that bill and saved mike Tyson of a death penalty. Gotta do some research . He isn’t impeached
Nope,  take a read. They don’t want trump as president because he stops the child pedo of andrechrome
The biggest thing I pulled from that statement is basically "hey Joe, we need you to win but please be quiet."   He doesnt like Joe Biden but they hate Trump so much lol
First the plague, now this. Clearly god doesn’t want trump to be president.
He rubs a lot of people the wrong way, especially with Trump... but he has some good points.
We've been conditioned to forget what happened in the recent past with social media feeds etc, but I'm gonna remember that we had a pandemic safety net that was dismantled by trump and multiple GOP lawmakers sold stock when they knew about covid but before it was public

Trump racist? PleSe price that he actually said something racist to me.
If you say trump caused these deaths. Ignorant. CDC told everyone it’s just like the flu. Trump closed the border anyway.  CDC is influenced by China. CDC suppose to stop all diseases getting out of control. Literally their job and they failed us
I hope nation-wide protests pull Putin out of power and that the same happens here with Trump. Fuck dictators. Fuck fascism. Fuck the military police state.
Watch out! This screeching woman finished first in her fake class at Trump University Law Skool.
What amazes me is how recently that wasn't the case.  Take a place like Swift County (Benson). Obama beat McCain by 14% in '08. Trump won by 25% in '16. I'm not sure there's anywhere in the country that swung as drastically as western MN.
And to clarify, I dislike AOC as much as Trump or nearly any other politician.   They’re all equally unqualified to lead in their own unique ways. 👍  Usually, they failed at some other career... then went into politics.

Honest and serious question: is anyone else having panic and anxiety attacks about our country and the current political events happening? I legit started crying today when trump tweeted he wants to delay the election. How do we keep our mental health intact w/ all of this?
Hope you're keeping that same energy for Trump not pushing back on Russia for putting bounties on the heads of our troops.
This a great audition for the part of Trump's #1 bootlicker in the Senate. I'm positive he's going to be getting a callback for the role.

that'll be the most confusing thing when we look back on this.  how did trump and Russia actually convince some Americans to fight on the side of the virus?  no masks and demon sperm &gt; Fauci
Leave it to Trump's ambassador to mourn the closest thing to a Confederate statue in Europe.
It is a 2 partY system that works because it requires compromise. Don't do Trump wants you do and fall into the Bernie or bust mess.
I thought the standing president wasn't allowed to have a personal account, and that's just ignored for Trump for some reason
So that's worse then tRUMP using the Oval Office to self benefit himself and his entire family.  #Hypocrite
That’s funny. They would come unglued. As it is, they are numb to the evil now. History will write that Trump ran for the Presidency for an ego trip. He didn’t really want the job. Now he’s stuck with it. Or is he? Sabotaging his own re-election and taking down all his pals too.
It's the Trumpvirus. Nobody is more responsible for spreading it in the US than Dirty Don Trump.
Kansans in recent weeks have faced increasingly aggressive political messages about the race for the Kansas Senate seat.  This reporting from  and  adds context about what’s promoting those campaign texts and calls to voters.
If trump was confident he was gonna win, he would not be suggesting delaying the election. Or do you think he just wanted to say something stupid to distract from the worst GDP report in American history?
This is why we need to remove Dirty Don Trump and make sure similar scoundrels never get elected - so little guys like this can grow up in a decent, just and prosperous land.
And in the meantime whose paying? 🙋‍♀️ And we have no idea what amount were each paying and what we should get back and when. Shady ass business. His family’s whole fucking job. You ever read about Fred Trump? It’s easy to see where Don gets it from.....
Follow the bouncing endorsement:  If Trump stays neutral  If that hurts Roger Marshall &amp; helps Kris Kobach  If Kobach wins GOP #kssen   Then Trump helps elect Democrat Barbara Bollier Nov. 3  Awesome move, Ted Cruz
I asked both Roger Marshall and Kris Kobach about the Trump controvery this week on 4Star Politics...
I would like to think that Kansas Republicans are smart enough to refute Trumpism. But we will see. All of the  senate candidates, except one, kiss Trump’s ass. There is hope in the new generation  If they will step up and get serious.
Kobach was Trump’s only endorsement heading into the caucus in 2016.

This is terrifying. It is now right out in the open. Dog whistles have become blaring megaphones. And now what everyone feared is spoken outloud. Barr, Pompeo &amp; trump will do everything they can to steal the upcoming election.
YOU wrote: "If Trump weren’t in office life would not have changed."  Uh ... no. Wrong.  The implication is that it is ALL about Trump and the tens of thousands of deaths in Spain, Italy, and Iran - before the virus came to the states - meant nothing.
But couldn’t be bothered to talk about it in front of a microphone out of all the other dumb shit we have to hear him say. The full truth would’ve been a nice change of pace. He ran a scam on his own country. Go Trump. 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
No. I never thought Mexico would pay shit. Trump would make us do it and try to put a bow on it and hope we’re stupid.
the gag is, Dems enable Trump, whereas Republicans opposed Obama and still got what they wanted. its almost like.. Democrats don’t really CARE about all they posture for, because the end result still directly benefits them  this cult mentality around Obama is why Biden is the nom
eight years as president. eight years.  and yet we act as if Trump can somehow supersede all process and authority to get his terrible shit done.  so that tells me he’s either full of shit, or Democrats aren’t HALF the “opposition party” or “resistance” that Republicans are. sad.
Instead of Trump trying to extend the voting date, why doesn’t congress open voting for the whole week before the traditional voting day. Due to Covid and not having enough voting booths this is a viable solution.
Opinion | Trump’s suggestion to delay the election is the most anti-democratic thing any president ever said - The Washington Post
Actually, it matters bc ppl mistakenly believe that Trump is an aberration, that he didn’t inherit much of his powers from prior presidents (including Obama). So just getting rid of Trump isn’t enough and thinking Biden will simply erase the Trump legacy is incredibly naive.

Im not confident Trump knows what the filibuster is...but the fundemental issue is one party has perserved a system that even though they receive fewer votes they remain in power. That isn’t democracy. Something must change.
Trump was up +2 in florida the day before the election
Did Ted Cruz convince Trump stay neutral in race between Kobach and Marshall?
James, it’s simple brother. It’s common sense. Biden is in bed with china, they tried to take out Trump, it didn’t work, so China unleashed the virus. They figured the people they were paying here weren’t getting the job done, so they did it themselves

In KS here we'd like Kobach to win the primary b/c  would definitely win running against this nutball... who was Trumpy before Trump  But man hearing his racists ads just sends shivers down my spine
I think Mitt Romney was the turning point; financial parasites switched sides and joined Democrat. Big tech, woke capital, selling country to China, it was all written in by then, making Trump inevitable. I gotta even reevaluate Trump now. I still hate him, but nobody else acted.
Trump has taken a sledgehammer to democracy.  Ignoring everything in the constitution except the 2nd amendment; he would toss that one out the window too if more non white non Christian citizens were to exercise their rights.   To say Biden is a bigger threat is ludicrous.
He's trolling so as to elevate the seriousness of potential wide-spread election fraud with mail-in ballots.  It wasn't a serious suggestion.  Classic Trump technique, which of course triggers the Left's collective heads to explode.

Weird.  I guess you and Obama forgot when John McCain gave a 👎🏼 to stop Trump and the majority party’s attempt to undo the Affordable Care Act. 🤔
Yep...and remember when they ridiculed Pres Trump who forewarned about that very thing, early on in this "plandemic"...and said we had to be careful that "the cure was not worse than the virus". Once again, Pres Trump was RIGHT!!!
Donald Trump should resign. Pass it on.
I think Trump might know more than you and I would know. You are not in politics for 34 years and innocent. Our Govt was not designed to operate this way. Too much Lobbyist money to be innocent &amp; in politics that long to stay innocent.
The right wing has resorted to: "Oh... come on! Trump does not mean any of the things trump says!!!"  And this is their DEFENSE of trump.
Its ok though, because nothing trump says means anything.
This game of "trump didn't suggest the thing that trump suggested" is petty and pathetic.  Your tortured defense of a man with absolutely ZERO character is disheartening.

Lol. Nope Trump does not.  But neither did
No, they're not. You need to look up what a red herring actually is. And we're not helping Trump, Joe Biden and the Democrats are.
Trump is too transparent to be devious. He loves dictators and hates our Free world allies. No apologies. He wants us to like him but he insults people. So he gets back what he gives out.  was correct in her analysis. Unqualified to be President.
The current KKK showed out for Trump in Charlotte and other places.  Nazi white supremacists were called "good people" by Trump.
So, FLOUTS renegotiated her contract with trump... I think it has something to do with being a couple. Anyway....!  How much will she get when she sues...?    trump must be scared out of his wig.

Trump is an a-hole joke, Biden is terrifying.
Doesn’t he think Trump isn’t that bad?
Trump listened to the Fuhrer and this is what happens. I imagine that many in his base that went to the rally will get COVID-19 as well. Who knows... some may die. A lesson is here for all... Don’t listen to Trump you just might die.

We all wish schools could reopen but ONLY when it's safe. Suburban moms LOVE Joe. The same people screaming for schools to reopen, won't send their kids/grandkids. This is about Trump's agenda &amp; not about kids.  Is this how you earn your donor $ or is just servicing Junior?
Ted Lieu on twitter: Donald Trump, Sir! This is not a banana republic!  Ted Lieu in Congress (today): Votes to allow the armed forces to recruit children on Twitch.
The reason  is a national treasure is she adds something to Trump’s words - facial expression. She’s not hamming it up, just exaggerating enough in the right places to give you the visual hooks you are used to getting that help you really get what someone’s saying. 1/
Did you miss vets against trump or repubs against trump? I don’t play instruments, nor am I an actor. I live in Suburban KCMO, a grandmother with common sense. He was molded by a hateful man, I hate his lack of:compassion, integrity, communication skills, ability to tell truth ..

Riker's Island Blues...I'll write this song when Trump's cell is ready
Trump's been talking again. Here are just a few of the highlights, courtesy all the reporters who have no choice but to cover his every word (pulled from their Twitter feeds). Enjoy.

If you were to squeeze Trump's 'big' brain with a vice the only things that would ease out of his ears is tough talk, bullsh!t and lies He's not very complicated
Trump admin openened an investigation into voter fraud, they found nothing. Millions &amp; millions already vote my mail. They found nothing. There is a pandemic, 150,000 dead &amp; surging, &amp;  would rather risk American lives than risk a fair election! Beyond disturbing.
If  is Biden’s VP choice, I will be SO EXCITED TO VOTE FOR BIDEN. If she’s not, I’ll still vote for Biden because, you know, he’s not Trump. I said what I said.
Back in the days when he focused on blocking football players rather than people who didn't vote for Trump
Trump offers to pay for funeral of slain soldier Vanessa Guillen
Trump is done. If the GOP doesn't start standing up to Trump and take your party back, it will be a very long time before Republicans have any power again. You reap what you sow.
So  volunteered to give his life to make trump look bad. So THAT’s why he went to the Tulsa Rally without a mask. Thanks for clearing that up.🙄
I’d add “Voter Fraud”, “Ballot Harvesting” etc are just conspiracy theories pushed by Trump.  Unfortunately it’s very human to believe them, they resonate with us all, to some extent. It’s a defense mechanism, we’re primed to be suspicious of things that can’t easily be explained

Trump is clueless
He full of threats b/c he’s so desperate he’ll try to abuse his power.  He’s too unstable, to trust. He should have been impeached when they had the chance. There’s been so much corruption and obstruction of justice, within the Trump Gov’t, it’s hard to keep up.
There’s are protests not riots.  Trump keeps telling everyone that it’s way worse than it is.  He said my city was a mess and would have to have Federal Troops sent in.  We are not a mess, Trump lies.  It’s all he can do is lie.
I can only 'watch' trump thru his threads. It's like a sterile filter. Now, next year I will continue to follow Aaron bc his daughter.
But supporting Trump is supporting the swamp-expansion project. I’m confused.
Who will you vote for Biden or Trump?
In fairness, as long as Trump is President none of us can be sure of anything nor are any of his pronouncements reassuring.
Donald Trump doesn’t know what he wants. He doesn’t really know reality. He just says whatever flows from his lips. But his GOP followers lap it up no matter what it is and no matter how farcical
Trump has been "probing and testing" every firewall of democracy since before he was elected. We are going to need some security upgrades when he's gone.

Trump Teams up with Dr. Anthony Fauci to Promote Plasma Donations
The Issue Is Trump
Definitely didn’t tweet the initial response to get likes from the right or comments from the left. Trump is a moron. Just think it’s weird to hop on deaths for a political twitter war.
Trump: "We're coming in very soon, the National Guard, who r allowed to go forward and do what they have to do and I think that makes the governors and mayors jobs a lot easier so they're working to clean out this BEEHIVE of TERRORISTS and...I'm going to be very happy."  WTF???😳
President Trump has done more good for our country than all 3 of those democrats combined.
Going live on Instagram with  at 6:15 central tonight to discuss Trump’s threat to delay the election.
In other news.. water is wet.. fire is hot...and Trump is toast
Imagine actually thinking Joe Biden is going to win over Trump. I would honestly love to be that clueless.
#USPS #USPSSabotage The United States Post Office is ESSENTIAL for the safety of this country in peacetime and wartime - and Trump is attempting to sabotage it just before the election.  This is unconscionable!    We need our post office and we need to SUPPORT it, dammit!
You are right!  He was an adult!  Should not have listened to the Idiot Trump!
Hey, ex cops could get jobs in those big beautiful growing coal mining communities - oh, wait, Another Trump failure
Trump Will Do Whatever He Can Get Away With
Me too, but Trump's just digging a deeper and deeper ditch for his own grave, Julie, so cheer up...this insanity will all be over soon.👍
And is Trump so fucking STUPID that he's unaware of the Constitutional FACT that he doesn't have the ABSOLUTE POWER to postpone the election?  (That was a rhetorical question btw).🤣
…Because when the founder of the  is calling Trump a fascist worthy of impeachment, maybe it’s time all Republicans took this threat to democracy seriously:
Trump and his lackey postmaster general is trying to destroy the post office.
I'm ok with calling it the Trump virus.
where Trump goes the virus grows!!
Trump: "This election will be the most RIGGED election in history."  WTF is he doing? Priming his ''biker'' and ''deep woods people'' base for a REVOLT???  I mean this is absolutely HORRIFYING.😳
BREAKING NEWS. President Donald J. Trump just publicly announced that he whole heartedly agrees with the co-founder of The Federalist Society   ... delaying the 2020 election would be FANTASTIC!
Trump Might Try to Postpone the Election. That’s Unconstitutional.
Herman Cain died from following Trump's lead and ignoring mask &amp; social distancing. He died from Trumpvirus. You elect a monster-clown, expect chaos, confusion and death.

Whoa, agree w everyone on this thread that they took their  time coming to the conclusion we have a Fascist in charge... but wow this is a BFD.   The Federalist Society just called Trump a Fascist... something needs to be the tripwire for the R's to stop enabling this madness
Trump said we will be the laughing nation of the world if we have mail in ballots. He is lying again.  Voting by mail is safe. No mail fraud. By the way countries around the world are laughing at you, and your leadership.  Becky
Yeah bcuz revamping FBI bldg when a thousand Americans a day are dying and the creditors are stepping up their evictions next week as well as foreclosures just makes total sense.  Sit down.   stop caring about any American who aren't in the 1% the minute Trump took office.
wont let  do it. But, it is a very bad look. Kind of surprised Trump let this leak.
Trump: "I don't want to delay, I want to have the election but I also don't want to have to wait for 3 mths and find out that the ballots r missing and election doesn't MEAN anything...that's what's going to happen Steve, that's common sense, and everyone knows it."  WTF???????😳
Just remember if Biden happens to win, we need to treat him with the same respect and optimism that the left has treated Trump with.  It’s only fair to match their class.
Wondering if Republicans still think it’s treasonous to propose delaying the election...
Very sorry for Mr. Cain's family.  People said Trump's Tulsa rally was a failure because of low turnout.  Can you imagine the catastrophe if the place had been filled to capacity?   Looks like the TikTokkers may have save some lives, eh?
What about the money that was given to millionaires? Kanye West, Elaine Cho's family for example! What about mail in ballots????? What about stop kissing Trump's butt? The buck stops with you for Missouri!!!
Unlike Donald Trump, our US Mail personnel are people of integrity and honor.
Really? Your "experts" said millions would die if Trump didn't act.  He did. Only thousands died.  You should be praising him.  #MAGA2020 right?
Trump: "U r sending out HUNDREDS of MILLIONS of mail-in ballots and the democrats know this Steve, the democrats know this...I want an election more than u but u have the fake polls and we have the REAL polls and I think we're doing really well."  We only have 350M people..WTF?😳
The US has yet to do this, Trump can’t be bothered.
You are replying to a "petty" dem, who is arguing with a petty Trump. 🤪
I love President Trump, you’re coming back!!
I would ask Trump one question during a press conference.  “Why is every sentence you say a lie?” #TrumpIsANationalDisgrace #trumppresser
We have a state-wide mandate here in Kansas, TeeKay, thanks to our great governor and have not noticed that at all simply bc it's the LAW of the State.   Can u imagine how many lives could've been saved if Trump issued a NATION-WIDE mandate back in March, when he should have?😳
Trump has been president for almost 4 whole years. Why isn't freedom here yet?!
Trump is a pathological liar. He has to be to make up for his utter ignorance and natural tendency to cheat. The TrumpVirus rages across America due to his utter incompetence; Russian put bounties on our troops and he says nothing to stop it. He is an astoundingly bad president.
Trump is rambling and lying as usual so it's a waste of time.
It’s failing me? Lol. Ok you keep throwing assumptions on me so let me try.  You think I want COVID to kill people because I think that will cost Trump the election, right? Or I want the country to stay locked down cuz thatll make him lose?
FAKE NEWS!!!  HER REAL BOYFRIEND IS DONALD TRUMP
4 American Presidents; Obama, Clinton, Bush, and Carter...were ALL HEARD today at John Lewis's funeral ceremony.  And they ALL were speaking about what this nation SHOULD BE doing, rather than what we ARE doing.  In simpler terms, they eviscerated Trump into a pathetic PULP.🤣👍
Petty dumbfuck trump tried to hijack Obama's eulogy of John Lewis by calling for an unscheduled press conference. CHRIST WHAT AN ASSHOLE. How can people condone this childish behavior?
The people who cheer when I criticize Trump, fascists and bigots who involve themselves in other people's lives are gonne be upset when I also denounce socialism, attempts to circumvent the 2nd ammendment, and extreme taxation. News flash: I'm not a D or an R. I'm a Libertarian
Based on the GOP’s unwillingness to fight for almost anything I would rather get rid of the GOP than the President   It’s why I contribute to President Trump but NOT the GOP  Just Sayin
Who thinks trump will look fetching in an orange jump suit?
Trump wants to kill USPS so that all the private mailing companies he has stock in will skyrocket. He literally only cares about himself and y’all want to re-elect him because “BiDeN iS dUmB aNd oLd”
Why has corrupt president trump still not addressed Russian bounties on American soldiers? Shame on all that ignore trumps crimes.
I will never be able to square the circle on this, but Trump is a well-known germaphobe. How the shit did he flip the stance, just within his own head?
Trump is very solemn in this press breifing  Cases up around the 🌎
Trump is attempting to read some wars. Turns quickly to word salad lies.
Not one legitimate source for flight logs and even on your fake flight logs, Obama hasn’t been listed.   Trump on the other hand has been photographed with Epstein dozens of times. But y’all don’t talk about that.
WATCH LIVE: President Trump talks from the White House.
Trump is going to be so, so small in this press conference. Obama's shadow today is far too long. Whatever Trump tries to do to steal the spotlight will be even more pathetic, especially if he comes out to pat himself on the back. Which...he will.
LAW AND ORDER! Trump 2020!
Nikki Haley has become very vocal lately. I'm wondering if the fix is in for trump to resign "due to health issues" and RNC selects Nikki, thinking a woman will draw Democrat women?  Not really wondering this - trump's desperate to win to stay out of jail
Trump 2020!
Trump dilly- dallied and denied that the TrumpVirus would be serious, that it would just disappear. He had disbanded the Pandemic Alert Team. He sent 8 tons of PPE to China and said China was doing a good job. He continues to confuse the public about masks &amp; medications.
But I wonder what the result would've been had the Democrat candidate been a man?  A lot of those trump votes were anti Hillary and anti woman
Thank you, Gregory. Trump doesn’t want to nor does he posses the ability to govern .
... but instead, the President, Donald J. Trump, is out getting fucked by Russia. This is the man we chose, but unlike Melania – we won't choose to keep him. I don't know about you, but I won't be #dyingfortrump on Nov. 3rd. #VoteBiden2020 #Biden2020
All of America feels like Melania Trump must have felt in 2006 – a time when she needed her husband most. At home Melania sat, alone &amp; pregnant with Donald's 5th child, while he was out screwing a porn star. 14 years later, America needs presidential leadership now more than ever
'We will not allow you': Governors slam Trump for floating delay of presidential election  via
LMFAO... Did trump take down his "delay the election" tweet?  Someone must have paraphrased the Constitution to him
To be clear, Trump is not wanting to delay the election due to safety concerns. He wants to delay the election because he hopes a vaccine will be put out on the market and ultimately turn his bad polling around. It's endless political corruption from this administration.
Thank God we have Donald Trump to in no way try and profit from his political position, right?
Number 3...to take away from the John Lewis funerals and Obama’s eulogy. That’s Racist 101 from the Trump playbook.
Lol. Way to change the topic from how Trump’s virus is killing his own supporters and brought about the complete destruction of the American economy.m
What presidency used to look like? Urbane, civilized, erudite, caring, compassionate! Everything that Trump is not.
Just to count your internet faux pas: against making voting accesible, force poor people to pull themselves up by the boot strings AND you make fun of illiteracy. THIS, my friends, is the Democratic Party. Congrats, Trump.
Trump doesn't have a whole lot of problem with that
Ignorance like this just shocks me, it’s almost 4 years an none of ridiculous shit liberals have said Trump would do has happened. When is all this stuff Trump was gonna do for Russia gonna happen? I can’t wait to see all memes of crying liberals after he wins again, too funny.

Don’t be a douche. It’s COVID deaths or Corona virus. China virus is as tasteless as Trump virus. Cain died from Corona. And yes. Many people dying have comorbidities, but they were living with those comorbidities before they got sick with COVID. Take my patients for example. My
I estimated nothing. And Trump himself went up to 2,000,000 when he started inching up on his previous 100,000. Then he throws out 2,000,000 cuz he knows we won’t get to that ridiculous number then later he can say “look how much I cut down from the expected 2M!”
Who are these poor people. Look at them all! They look as if they really don't want to be there or were rushed in at the last minute. And as always Trump looks totally disinterested.
Thank YOU SO MUCH President Trump!!    Thank YOU SO MUCH President Trump!!    Thank YOU SO MUCH President Trump!!  #Trump2020🥊🥊🥊
Blatantly moving our country backwards. I’m reading ‘The Color of Law’ (you should too) and it’s an ugly but important history related to this topic. If you’re in the MAGA crowd just know that his ‘great again’ means back to division/disadvantage for many.
Preach it, Pete. Don't let Trump distract. Putin is calling the shots here anyway, not Trump. Trump is the latest Benedict Arnold and needs to be imprisoned for treason!
So Trump thinks we should delay the election. More advice from his mentor Putin?
If Trump attempts to remain in office upon losing the election, citizens will take to the streets en masse. I have already lived most of the life that I have on this earth. If it comes down to it, I will gladly take to the streets. 1/2
Wait, don’t you get paid by Soros? Why would Trump take responsibility?
This is more than he said about John Lewis.   Maybe that’s because Cain died because of Trump. Just add him to the list...
Tough guy, who’s a “reply guy” to Trump and thinks he’s smart, blocks people for not accepting his soft minded group think! Btw,  we are still waiting for for proof of Russian Collusion?
trump set the no mask culture, but Cain was a grown man - he could've chosen responsibly
Yes. In the age of tRump it certainly is.
I'm kinda sick of  bitching and moaning about how awful tRump is when it was assholes like him and  who got us to a point where Donald tRump could steal power after losing the actual election by nearly 3million votes because Russia manipulated the e.c.

Your bizarre attack on Joe Biden in the primaries could have damaged our chances to beat Trump. Based on this, it seems you are not disciplined or dedicated enough to be the VP pick.  You seem more like a selfish opportunist than a future potus.
I already told Trump that there is a special place in hell for him! That's why he turn the Bible upside down
I will make sure that Putin doesn't interfere this time. God got this. Trump will not win. He will fall upon his own sword before he wins
That was Trump; our authoritarian, Fascist president. Trump doing worse things than Obama doesn’t mean that Obama didn’t do anything bad. My point is to get ppl to see that it’s the nature of the Presidency itself, not simply the individual presidents, that are the problem.
Trump is a pedophile I guess!!!
Good god, man. Republicans have absolutely sold their souls to be on the Trump train and they all deserve the ruin headed their way. Fuck ‘em.

Diverting headlines... And you took the bait like everyone else. Say what we want about Trump but he is a master of manipulating media...
He becomes more like Trump all the time! A total Idiot!
I still get goose bumps when I listen to him speak. Whereas I just fight my impulse to hurl objects at the TV when Trump is speaking
He is indeed, Kath, and I'm proud of his speech today as well bc he was not holding any punches against Trump with his comments about the POLICE STATE we've, quite tragically turned into.
Phony. Statements too clever for Trump to have said. We shouldn't indulge in this kind of Republican-style crap.
Your last sentence is the point I was trying to make. Confused. Ps - not a trump guy
Mistrust in our own team of experts who have been working on this all along. All to support Trump's narrative. Our doctors and scientists have been working nonstop on this, looking for the answers. They have already looked at HCQ, and while finding positive data at times

It’s hard sleeping at night when there’s so many trump supporters in my family 🥴
Trump did it.
They are simply a part of a propaganda machine being used by the Trump administration and campaign to inflate Trump's ego, while attempting to discredit Fauci because Trump was jealous of him, and give Trump public support to reopen completely. Against the advice of doctors.

It would be good for the corrupt   to cut their losses and separate themselves from Trump or their entire party will burn down this November.
and which do us fit into that supported what Trump was doing?
I believe it’s real but here are some alternative theories: 1. Zoom stakeholders wanted to ⬆️their yields 2. China is sick of America’s shit and wanted to laugh at us 3. Putin is mad that trump was impeached and unleashed hell  4. KU was trying to cover up their b-ball scandal
When had A presidential election ever been postponed delayed????? Never ! Trump is an idiot! His days are numbered
U know Trump endorses her right?
However, here he is standing with this alliance, claiming that we need to send our kids to school during this pandemic, just as Trump has said. Hamilton said, "We need to not act out of fear, we need to act out of science." As she stands with other physicians who say don't wear
So Trump really feels like his supporters are "balls deep" in their sisters? What a sick, sick man. That is the leader Evangelicals want to follow? The man the Christian Right has faith in? He's more like the Beast. More intent on killing Americans than leading and saving us.
The economy was booming when President Obama left office. Now, we have the highest deficit ever. We have millions out of work, the worst GDP drop in our history, 150,000 dead from a global pandemic. “Small man” Trump has failed at everything.  #ObamaWasBetterAtEverything
If there's anything I've learned in the past 24hrs with Trump's tweet and the NFL top 100 list, it's that voting matters.
‘It hit me hard’ 🙄 OMG! As if that soulless man ever cared about anyone except himself.  And he picks this exact time to bring this to light?? Trump is so transparent and fake!
The thing that Obama forgot was that George Floyd was a thug and a criminal, regardless of his color.  Floyd has become a puppet for racist propaganda peddled by people like Obama in order to disguise their misdoings and cast blame on the Trump Administration.  Don’t be fooled!

Oh, one of Trump's boys who said coronavirus wasn't real died from the coronavirus. Go figure.
Hum, so the book is about the Trump administration...  As many here have pointed out pretty dense to tweet this while your guys threatens to delay an election
Great work. Keep it up. Four years ago, I told my friends, "If Trump's elected, there may never be another Presidential election." They laughed at me. Two years ago I said, "He won't concede if he loses," and they laughed again.   They've stopped laughing.
Why aren’t we all furious trump wants to be a dictator. Are republicans ok with, this hence their silence?
Um, chick your dude uses emergency health briefings for political purposes &amp; tear gasses peaceful protestors for a photo op.   HTF can you call Trump anything but divisive... Obama talks about voting rights  a funeral for a champion of voting rights and the R. loses their mind
We have to admit there's always been an element of "start raving madness" in our country - it was just hidden away and trump brought it out into the daylight
I like how Trump says that he is going to try to hold on to power anyway possible, and your reaction is "Well, this is Biden's fault for not stopping him"
Donald Trump voted by mail too...I’m confused on where the line is...🤷🏿‍♂️
HOLY SHIT, Obama SEIZED the moment to kick Trump in the fucking balls:😳👇  "...today we witness with our own eyes police officers kneeling on the necks of Black Americans...we can witness our federal government sending agents to use tear gas and batons on peaceful protesters..."Because self-interest Trump's National interest????
Doesn't matter one lick if Rs are in favor. Needs to change the law to change the date. Ds control the House. Constitution sets the date for Congress &amp; Pres to be sworn in.Trump is stymied. He tries it on his own and the Supremes will shut him down 9-0. He's desperate. Sad.

Well, that was nice. tRump just floated sending in the National Guard to Portland. I wonder if he has a modern day MacArthur to attack the modern bonus army.
Yes, you're right, the rest of the world is colluding with the Democrats. (Most of) Europe and Asia locked down, did irreparable harm to their economies, and buried thousands of their citizens b/c they don't like Trump. This is the only logical explanation.
Ew, no. I automatically assume anyone supporting trump has no knowledge of science, research, morals, or even knows how to read.

The NCAA is bent on being disbanded evidently.  What an illogical proposition. What is acceptable: F’Trump; Black Lives Matter; Pay Me?  Who makes the decision?
Kansas Secretary of State Scott Schwab says his office opposes President Donald Trump’s suggestion to postpone the November election. He urged the Kansas delegation to Congress to do the same.

So he’s flat out admitting this president is acting like an immature child. And Trump seriously thinks these kind of childish games are professional and becoming of a President Of The United States? For F$%K’s sake! 😡 #ComplicitCorruptGOP 🇺🇸🇺🇸 #Biden2020 🇺🇸🇺🇸 #TrumpForPrison2021

trump has told us, just a few weeks ago, he doesn’t joke. I remember that, why don’t you?
Exactly, trump told us, he doesn’t joke.
Honestly most of the "liberal" media Trump decries actually helped him, having these "both sides" debates for every issue, as if both positions are innately reasonable. Like here's a panel of expert doctors, but let's also hear out some crazy who thinks masks are an evil plot.
Trump isn't going to (or attempt to) delay the election. But by suggesting the possibility he's now made other, only slightly less insidious measures, e.g. restricting mail-in voting, seem like a compromise. And as always the media will attempt to be "objective" and gobble it up.
No Republican has won the presidency without Florida since Calvin Coolidge in 1924. Trump is currently losing Florida. #WeWillVote

This cannot be said enough: Trump is a lying weinie. That is all.
Did you just go out of your way to correlate the KKK with Trump
Over 70,000 Mental Health Professionals agree...he's nucking futz! #RemoveTrumpNow #Biden2020 #TrumpIsNotWell
Trump's move against cities with militarized force looks like a play right out of Putin's book to me. We need to stand up for the 1st Amendment and our fellow citizens! Barr and Trump are not going to take this country away from the people. This country belongs to us! #BLM #trump
Oh honey I hated Donald trump long before George Floyd lol I do my research 😇
Yes but not one who supports trump.

I didn’t even vote for trump last election. But if you really think this is how you win over the middle and the right, you’re wrong.
Exactly! Any trump supporter comes at me screaming or being an asshole even if they didn’t intend to touch me will most likely regret it.
Seriously..but remember when trump said there’s good people on both sides regarding white supremacists.
Don’t start something you can’t finish. Not everyone is afraid of getting a charge. Trump supporters are finding out what their bigotry is getting them. “Antifa” isn’t all talk- they’ll eff someone up.
Well you’re super rude &amp; im not a trump supporter lmao I literally said you can’t talk to them bc they’re the people defending attacking Americans who are exercising their constitutional rights aka peacefully protesting.
What part of my comment makes you think I’m a trump supporter?
So is trump
“School bus” filled with trump supporters who are no doubt shouting dumb shit at people and getting wrecked for it lmao
Trump literally lost the popular vote?
Trump spouts fake news all the time which is why he has to get fact checked by social media which is why he gets so mad.
We absolutely need to vote. Where have you seen Trump supporters getting killed for their beliefs? Because there are definitely protesters who are dying.
I can’t find the interview but it was when all of this was happening &amp; he was all mad about being fact checked.
So far off. Trump literally said he’d get rid of social media if he could and constantly attacks the media (dictator red flag) &amp; the armed left is a thing, they want gun control not guns to be taken away. Just to point out a few things that are wrong w/ that meme.
The same people who are cool w/ peaceful protestors getting gassed so trump can go take a picture in front of a church he doesn’t attend...for example. &amp; no, those people weren’t rioting.
You’re mistaking “anti trump” for anti America lmao we love our country. Which is why we are going to fix it.
I was being kind.  Perhaps Trump’s suburban housewife?
To all the people who had absolutely ZERO problem with president Trump giving Rush Limbaugh the Medal of Freedom 🥇 I can’t wait to see you go aoeshit over Anthony Fauci and Colin Kaepernick being selected to receive the Robert F. Kennedy Award 😆😂🤣

Oh buddy I’m not even engaging w/ you. I don’t have the energy to deal w/ someone who is so hard to understand and obviously isn’t American. Don’t worry about trump, he’s not your problem luckily.
This man really out here lying about being invited to throw the first pitch 😂   #TrumpleThinSkin
Just because trump is living in a day and age where if he didn’t allow women to be in positions of power it would be extremely abnormal. This does not mean he respects them.
“Too Much and Never Enough” by Mary Trump
Don’t let the  and  cowards propping up this failed president convince you of their lies about Portland and other cities with protests. The majority of the protesters ARE peaceful and NOT destructive and ARE being provoked by Trump’s uninvited DHS escalating things😡
The virus will be going strong through Trump's fall, too.
Bob Hamilton.....&amp; assume this is a wife. Really gross commercial, snarky, demeaning... oh yeah trump lovers=figures👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻 ⁦⁦⁦
Will trump sit for an interview with MSNBC or CNN? Usually, at the WH, he just calls CNN fake news as an answer to a question.
Why is  confirming the size of Trump's hand?
Billy Lee, when was the last time trump was interviewed on MSNBS or CNN?  Just sayin’
You must be done golfing for the day?  Gonna finally work on the Trump virus problem?  Well that's just peachy.   With your inaction only 150K have died so far.  Glad you have some time to work on it now.
Let’s talk about how your goons have purposely escalated the situations themselves. You, Trump &amp; everyone in the DHS has the blood on their hands. You don’t violate civil rights &amp; First Amendment freedoms with tear gas and rubber bullets then get to play the victim card 😡😡
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
They are members of a personality cult. They cannot leave until the leadership changes and they lose faith in the new leader. Fortunately Trump has gathered a slither of Wormtonges as sycophants. None of the next tier can maintain the mass delusion.
I wonder if Trump will get on the phone with his best buddy Putin and brag that he’s got more Americans protesting against him than there are Russians protesting. 🤣
The Portland protests ARE working &amp; ARE serving their purpose. Trump wouldn’t have called in his goons if they weren’t shining a bright light on a nationwide movement on behalf of #BLM &amp; #PoliceReform. May the intensity, perseverance &amp; overwhelming numbers send DHS home in shame!
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
Trump doesn't listen to music. Explains a lot, right? That's why I've pledged to #Vote46 on Nov. 3 with  Will you join me? #Propelling #Pledge46
Fascinating breakdown of Barstool/Portnoy visit to the White House, basically Trump was served a softball on a silver platter and still dropped it.
How many days went by before there was a presser with the press sec? How many days without a WH update on the coronavirus? How many days without a trump lie?
Donald Trump will NEVER take any accountability for any of his failures. Narcissists never do. He’ll just continue down his destructive path of making excuses and throwing once loyal pawns to the wayside. Our country is being ripped apart by this failure of a president! 😡
I wish trump would stick that thumb up his a$$, because there's no reason to give a thumbs-up in this country with all the damage he's done &amp; is doing. 145,000 COVID deaths. Wait, maybe that's what trump meant - deaths are going up &amp; up...on his watch.
Trump also stole from his veterans charity and got sued and has to pay back millions. He promised to bring troops home but sent an additional 12k of them to the Middle East instead. #VeteransAgainstTrump
Well he’s against trump so probably not, right?
Trump said that.
It’s better than the giant trump semi parked on the side of the road
Incompetent trump screwed up how the United States dealt with COVID. Pretty simple dude.
The mask mandate produced a speed up of the virus? How? The squelched economy, &amp; increased fear trails directly back to trump's mishandling of COVID. BTW, did you see trump is finally encouraging mask wearing &amp; he's called off the in-person RNC? All Governor Kelly's fault? 👍🏼
It’s political power expenditure. This isn’t something a president can do during the first half of their term. Passing a major pharmaceutical reform bill like this costs Trump a lot of power points. He’s been working on it for years and has the power to pass it now.
Oh yeah I don’t doubt if trump wins it’ll be due to some form of cheating.

Well it was bc you mentioned Donald trump in a positive manner when it came to pedos lmao
I agree, they’ve never lifted a finger for this country but try to negate the sacrifices others have made. Trump walks all over veterans too, just bc he’s POTUS doesn’t mean he gets your undying loyalty if you can think for yourself. A greater POTUS will come soon.
So clever bc when it comes to millions struggling to get their medicines and a puppet in office - shit like this is what’s important! Anyone else notice how low quality trump supporters always are?

AG Bill Barr is Trump’s hired gun.
The left has called this out; the Republican Senate under MCConnell is ignoring Trump’s state police action. It’s Friday night, let’s see who gets fired from Do J tonight? Four inspector generals gone in the last month.

that Trump has become an acceptable means for Christians. Honestly, it's despicable.
The last paragraph, you guys...   Heart-wrenching.  This article has me pondering the whole "lose the battle, win the war" expression. What battle have we lost? And why assume the battle is less important than the war? If some evangelicals believe Trump is fighting our cosmic
"[the] underlying assumption among her congregation that men should be in charge, that they would protect the women. She realized evangelicalism was no longer the place for her."
Well trump sure promoted that idea.
Please make Pres Trump go away-he’s insane!

There is just no way that Trump and Clinton aren’t in the redacted portion.  No way she wasn’t asked if she ever met either, or more.
I think you're conflating "religious people" with "white evangelicals." There have been plenty of religious people - officially and personally - speaking out against Trump.

Likely hidden in one of Obama’s obscure and numerous “executive orders”.  Eventually, President Trump will find it and put the torch to it.

Yeah and President Trump keeps praising America hater Fauci. LOSE!
I think instead of fact checking to name lies it be easier to fact check trump and name things hes said that are true... cuz there wouldn’t be much.

Lindsey Graham is dumb as the day is long.  He’s trying to lose his election because the ghost of McCain haunts him.  Trump was joking you joke.
In my opinion elections safety is very crucial and important so if those in charge don't feel like they can do that, I don't see why not but if they feel they can secure them properly then they should go ahead. President Trump normally don't tweet something if he's not briefed.
Obama doesn’t need to question anything trump does since he was a disgrace to this country when he was president and were still the affect of it with his black lives matter of racism which he made worse     More racism because of him.
Trump has uttered this lie too many times.  Every time he makes a tweet like this,  there needs to be strong rebuke, and Republicans should lead it.  In all things,  but especially matters pertaining to elections,  the truth matters.

And you can't state a single reason of why Biden over Trump. Other than your biased opinions. Nothing about policy. His (lackluster) history in politics. Just your TDS.  Like 99% of Democrats.  Congrats?
The Presidential Election and a State Election are two very different things. FWIW, I felt moving any election was wrong, point blank. But we all know that Evers did it for the public good and it was in his power. Trump does not have the power to do so you wanker.
Even most conservative voters are like “nah we’re not delaying shit.” Did Trump find the line?
tRump has voted by mail
The smartest thing that  could do right now is frame Trump's suggestion to 'delay' the election as him threatening the sacred right to vote.
i’m convinced some of y’all would suck trump off
The Senator knows full well that Trump wasn't joking about delaying the election. This is despicable.
There are no Biden 2020 signs anywhere. There are no supporters showing up for his appearances. Less than 30. He won't probably make it much further. Too embarrassing with his condition. Trump playing them like a fiddle. Suggesting postponing election, #NoMailInVoting

“Each of you should use whatever gift you have received to serve others, as faithful stewards of God’s grace in its various forms.” 1 Peter 4:10             Maybe Trump should use some of his considerable wealth to invest in a team of doctors and scientists to work on a vaccine

I spent years listening to people in my family talk about how Obama was going to declare martial law and steal a 3rd term and now the groundwork for such a thing is just casually happening for a Trump 2nd term
The media should stop giving them press, as well as Trump who continues to spew lies and misinformation. They have the power to do this, but they’d rather be entertaining and sensationalizing for ratings.

Trump wanted to create a crisis wherein he could delay or outright cancel the election. He's consistently pushed the idea that the virus isn't serious, despite us knowing better. It seems creating a crisis has been his goal. Pair that with his tweet this morning.
I'm borrowing this pic, girlfriend. I would like to think even the most uneducated of Trump's base can understand this.  Have a mahhhvelous day, my dear! 😘

These are the people running our country. No values, no morals. Just power hungry puppets to the biggest puppet himself, Trump. If you're not disturbed by this, I seriously question your mental health.

Cain attended Trump's ill-faded Tulsa rally w/ out a mask and likely contracted corona. The saddest part about this is it could have been prevented.
Trump wants to delay the election. Will Barr try to enable this ? Vote like our Democracy depends on it because we are in perilous times.
Another valid reason to make sure we vote Trump/Pence on Nov 3, 2020
It is worth noting here that if the Dems didn't gain control of the House in 2018, we might be faced with the prospect that a Republican controlled Congress would capitulate for Trump and vote to delay the election.  This just supports the idea that elections do have consequences
Trump suggests delaying 2020 election
don’t go to a trump rally. don’t do it. cain got the virus from tulsa.
It is too bad that Trump and his cult is too stupid and sadistic to know they can't cancel elections; this does not excuse you for not acting on impeachment of this grave danger to our nation.
So,  there is absolutely no precedent for delaying this election.  Trump will lose on this one.
It’s all THE story. But you’re right, Trump likely tweeted that out knowing the news about the GDP was coming.
The entire Trump Presidency has been one continuous string of "He can't do that" followed by Trump doing it and no one holding him accountable. He's got like half a dozen interim dept heads serving indefinitely without going through an approval.

It may be silly, most goper stuff is, but it reminds me of Hitler's sudden rise to dictatorial power in the 30's; and of course it is an illegal power grab he's proposing right out in the open that would transform our government into a Trump holding.
President Trump floats idea of delaying the November election.    #KAKENews
If there's fraud in the process, it's because Trump has placed one of his buddies in charge of the post office....we all need to remember that tampering with the US mail is a federal crime .
President Trump suggests a delay to the presidential election. It's important to note:  while states have the authority to delay their primary elections, only Congress can change the date for the general election for president.
The mail in ballot process will be flawed for sure because Trump has placed one of his buddies in charge. Remember,Trump ALWAYS tells us what he's doing or gonna do
Every Republican in Congress should be publicly reminding Trump that,  since the date for the election is "set" in the Constitution we will not be delaying it. He is intentionally sewing doubt and confusion.  This error on his part must be made clear.
I'm more worried about keeping Trump out of my suburban neighborhoods! With his alien DNA &amp; his drug pushing, our property values wouldn't stand a chance!!
Yes! This is it.  The Paul Revere Ride.  The gopers are coming. The gopers are coming with Trump.

Trump knows he is going to lose— so start up the propaganda

Something I haven't heard talked about much. Deaths from terrorism peaked in 2014 under Obama. Since Trump became President that number has been cut in half... Worldwide. Peace through strength! #Trump2020Landslide

What did you do? Shame on you! You’re going into trump territory!
Martial law is ok if Trump wants it, I believe is the message here. Be afraid, be very very afraid because this man has no concept of how a free democracy is supposed to work and is more likely to take Putin’s advice than his own experts...
In case Trump's racism wasn't blatant enough for you:
Because they spent so much airtime and printing space making fun of Pres Trump when he suggested that it would work several months ago.
Who knows what all Trump has done vis a vis Russia?  The worst thing,  other than the bounties of course, is that we have no way of knowing to what extent Russia is interfering with the November election. But, you can be certain they ARE interfering.
Maybe try the light inside the body thing Trump recommends....
I am so excited to see heads explode when trump is reelected!
Thanks to Republican Senators,  Trump learned that he can pretty much do anything he wants to as president. Thanks for nothing Senators.  Those of you up for reelection deserve to lose.

I assume the military chiefs would have objected to the withdrawal.  So,  apparently,  Trump doesn't listen to their advice.  That is troubling.
In which   normalizes the idea of trump holding a political rally at the WH. Authoritarianism is aided and abetted by those complicit in excusing/ignoring abhorrent behavior.
So.....basically you're fine with the current system.....goes without saying that a vote for anyone other than Biden is indeed a vote for Trump. That vote would in fact give Trump a MANDATE
Wonder how much Trump got for Europe?  Art of the deal.
He is a traitor to the US. Note also sanctions on Deripaska were recently lifted. trump spoke to Putin the following day. Sadly the press ignores important actual news like that while reporting on shiny objects like him whining about ratings.
Trump has no concept of logistics or logistcal needs.  And he doesn't care.
Yet you support Putin's puppet trump. Hypocrite. We see you.  You and your colleagues are complicit and own every treasonous thing he does. You chose a corrupt criminal over your country. gfy
Donald Trump was just a Trojan Horse for the Radical Right Agenda. They will do whatever they can to take over America but they will ultimately lose and do serious damage to the Republican Party.
Bounties on American heads. tRUmp says he doesn't care RU arms Taliban to kill US soldiers. Sanctions just lifted on Deripaska. Now this.  tRUmp is a traitor to the USA. Press needs to stop treating him like a legitimate normal potus.
Treasury lifted sanctions on Deripaska day before last trump/Putin call and it hasn't even been reported. Please call attention to this! He's rewarding Russia while saying he won't do anything about bounties and doesn't care that RU gives weapons to Taliban to kill US military.

We're in a global pandemic. Key word: global.  You honestly think Joe would've done better? Called Trump every name in the book for his travel ban.  Biden's former COS said they got lucky with H1N1.  Trump can't control states. Especially when they resist him at every turn.
Trump jumped over the moon to defend Russia in that AXIOS INTERVIEW. why?

It's astounding the way cable news is reporting on the Constitutional crisis of trump refusing to follow SCOTUS ruling on DACA - simply repeating his disinfo calling the program illegal &amp; his lie re the decision giving him 'power.' He breaks the law and they basically shrug.
Off topic but did y'all see Treasury lifted sanctions on Deripaska July 22? Latest trump/Putin call was July 23. Apparently our press doesn't think that's worth reporting on.
trump spoke to Putin July 23, day after sanctions were lifted. Who wants to bet they didn't just talk about ventilators, as reported?
Yes they are.. That's why President Trump has just let them roll, right into the sewer
Someone needs to find out who made it for them, considering trump's press propagandist used a video at briefing created by the far right/neo-nazi propagandist Andy Ngo.
can you help out the USPS? You said you would help out in this election and that's what the American people need . Please anything to beat Trump right?
Remember gop's claim ACA created 'death panels?' Now because of trump's purposeful incompetence and Abbott's sycophancy TX, tragically, does have actual death panels. Crickets from gop.
And another thing, Trump.... I love America and Americans. I don't hate my country or want to destroy it. I just want to leave now. Can you loan me $10,000,000 to get the f**k out??? LMAO!
To Trump: If I dont like America I can leave??? Well, frankly, NO, I CAN'T. My lack of travel money, travel restrictions due to covid bullshit, etc. make it impossible. I'm not a billionaire.
Man I'd like to just rip that black bitch's weave off..... #LucyMcBath #BillBarr #WW3
That is extemely true. Also, I don't think the polls have had a good pulse on the people for awhile now. They have been unable to track new voters that trump brought in for 2016 and I think it's only been growing. I'll say it I didn't vote in 2016 because I thought it was rigged.

That’s okay Trump. He wouldn’t want you there anyways.
If we have to explain to Trump why we like Fauci more than him,  he is even more clueless and out of touch with Americans than I thought.
Barr,  with his broad interpretation of presidential powers,  and his willingness to use DOJ as a tool for Trump to advance those powers; is our nation's worse nightmare. Trump must be defeated to ensure that Barr isn't allowed to further damage our justice system beyond repair.

Trump's continued silence about Putin's bounties tells us all we need to know.  Trump is a Putin asset,  and he has been since he came down that escalator. It is time for a president whose loyalty is to the nation he leads and,  more importantly,  to it's constitution.
trump now needs to spend in texas which has got to be debilitating cause if biden wins texas it’s all over.
The Trump administration has formally asked the FCC to develop regulations that could apply to Facebook, Twitter and other social platforms.  #KAKEnews
Complete and total failures. Enjoy Trump for 4 more years.
can someone watch this and still legitimately, objectively vote for trump?  i guess someone without any empathy.
Trump was right. #Hydroxychloroquine
Thank you Kellie!
Come on people.  He just touched his mask and uncovered his face when he thought cameras weren’t on.  🤬.  This is the fear mongering control freak that tells us what to do.  🤬.  Trump needs to dump him!!!!  NOW!
The Trump crop top makes this so much more funny. Jesus.
Shouldn't be ignored that clearing the protesters using violence was part of the photo op. trump wanted those pics to make himself feel better about being mocked over the bunker and to present himself as an authoritarian strongman for his magat cult.
You stupid woman! The violence is your fault! Quit trying to blame President Trump for every thing.  He has tried to help but you have refused.
trump’s campaign is trying SOOOOO hard to get him to message positively on the pandemic, and then he starts peddling the hydroxychloroquine stuff again.  maddening.
I think any Trumpers who want to take it should be allowed to take it. If you're willing to get your medical advice from Trump, more power to you, fewer votes in Nov. I know it's harsh, but at this point, that's really how I feel.
Trump 2020.  Thanks for being on the team!  Go get 'em!
Lol imagine being so insecure that you have to lie about throwing out a first pitch of a baseball game because you were jealous somebody else did. But then again if that doesn't sound like something Trump would do, you clearly don't know him
He assured reporters he hadn’t been near Robert O’Brien later. That’s not good for two reasons, and trump can’t figure out either one. He’s such an idiot.
Trump needs no help in looking bad.  He does a great job of making himself look bad daily.  He is an expert in that.
Has press already forgot Pres O signed agreement to build new complex in suburbs &amp; lease old building as hotel? trump ended it (1 of 1st things he did) to protect his private business. Press needs to put things in context rather than frame as unfounded claim by Dems.
trump wants to tear down the old building (it sounds like) and rebuild in same location. Don't forget Pres O signed deal to lease old building out as hotel &amp; build complex in suburb. trump stopped it since it might affect his personal business. Press shouldn't ignore.
just found out Matthew McConaughey is a Trump supporter   disappointed but not surprised
Does Trump have a terrible track record with woman, yes.  He's all about image and making sure the product he's putting forth is top tier. He's harsh on both men and woman.  I believe that some are telling the truth, but it's tough to know who.
Obama let more loons out than Trump has. Check you facts before running your mouth!
They are looking to get Trump voters who are anti-maskers... science ignored for some votes in November... Appalling!
Trump out here throwing MAGA hats like a guitarist tossing guitar picks at the end of the show lol
Please show the advertisements from Republicans Voters Against TRump in Kansas. Lots of KS Republicans are sick and tired of what the president is doing and not doing. THX!
FB sure manages to censor anti-trump ads quickly, despite them not violating TOS (and they refuse to tell the makers just what the violation is). If they wanted to stop stuff like that they could. Zuck knows extremism makes him money.
Now that would be a celebration that Trump could say was the biggest EVER!!!
this is exactly why candace owens said she flipped to the republican party...
“[The CBP] don’t exist within the realm of civilian law enforcement. They view people they encounter in the military sense as enemy combatants, meaning they have virtually no rights.”
He said the let him, unfortunately that implies consent  Miss California, Carrie Prejean  “To paint Mr Trump as someone who would purposely walk into a women’s dressing room and ask women to come impress him is the most disgusting accusation so far,” she said.  Who do we believe?
Here I thought that Melania was building a bigger bunker so the whole TRUMP family could hide   Silly of me.
Trump is having a tantrum about trending for all the wrong reasons. All the while 150k Americans are dead. He doesn’t care about you. Only about himself. #trumpthinskin #lyingTrump #TrumpIsACompleteFailure #COVID19
Be lookin like Donald Trump at the end. :o
Yet,  knowing what he knows about Trump,  why would he even make a remark like that?  Hogan knows as well as anyone that Trump isn't going to change and suddenly become the competent president he has never been.
I think Obama doesn’t want Flynn talking.   But I heard Sullivan’s son did something bad.  If it was pedo.  Trump Is over the target on that.
So who are you planning to be president in 2020. Your train has left the station sir. Trump it is then.
Of course, Trump caught in another big fat lie.
That’s the dumbest post I’ve seen in a long time.  Trump has no need to impress Red states, and pissing off blue states just costs votes in battle ground states.
One sure way to ensure Maxwell's safety -- hire former Afganastan soldiers to guard her 24/7 -- They will make sure Trump or his Mafia can't get to her.
And Trump.
This smart, classy lady needs to be your VP choice. Makes me smile.   Biden/Rice vs.  Trump/Pence  #VoteBlueNoMatterWho  #VoteBlueNoMatterWhoYouAre
Fair point — “(Trump) was very turned off by the fact that Schmidt had turned on McCain, his former boss, for the money,” the source alleged, referring to Schmidt’s decision to dish dirt on the 2008 campaign he helped guide to doom in a lengthy interview...”
Illegal??!! 🤣 🤣 #TrumpMeltdown guess he doesn’t like #DicatorTrump #DictatorDon or #TrumpsGestapo 🤣 this tweet below HAS to be one of my faves! #Trending #Trump bahahahaha
Y'all want to talk about boats? Cool cool. Let's talk about the Red Sea deal made on a yacht.  It isn't just Russia trump's owned by. He's selling our national security out to whoever can line his pockets.
If you want a glimpse into how the election will go in November, check out these comments and the numbers behind them. People want law and order. Antifa and BLM will sway the election to Trump.
Trump &amp; Barr sent phony trouble makers to stir up the pot in Portland so they could send in their Stormtroopers. They got that from their man Hitler. He will do anything to get votes!!!
As we watch what's going on in Portland &amp; other cities, a reminder trump praised what happened in Tiannanmen Square while criticizing Russia for not cracking down on pro-demoracy protesters. Press should keep that in mind while reporting.
Melania.  Is.  Just.  Like.  Trump.
We've had all kinds of presidents in US history. What is it about this one that's generating such a pathological response? I think the left thought it was on a path, until.... Trump, and they've just gone nuts. For me, it just makes the case for the second bomb. (re-election)
Trump is Putin’s puppet just like HRC said.
Trump in Helsinki. No reason not to believe Putin. Trump is a Russian patriot!!! Go Home and play with your penis, I mean Putin!! Traitor!!!
Actually  is not capable of telling the truth &amp; if every single news channel reports the same thing about  failures lies &amp; piss poor job trump has done well it doesn't take a genius to see what the problem is!
#trumplethinskin, please, whatever you do don’t make tRump do this:
I'm speechless 😲  #SmartNews
trump saying its illegal to trend negative hashtags of him is not only completely false, but the fact he thinks it isnt enforces this idea that he can’t be slandered bc he’s in power, and consequences should come to who is slandering him.  huh. sounds like another country i know.
No, if they were rapped they should be believed and they should go sue. The same rule applies to Trump, if they settle then nether one of us knows what actually happened and we can't guess.
Today the justice department announced the findings on the Clinton Campaign.  Comey and high level officials of the Obama team did attempt to overthrow the government before and after Trump was elected. The plan was to create a totalitarian country run by Clinton.
It shouldn't be ignored trump created the circumstance (sanctions) which allowed money laundering to happen in 1st place. He was previously in business with Iran Revolutionary Guard. Really think he hasn't profited from the Halkbank stuff?
Is he serious?  A pink Trump Putin hat.  He’s so funny, I mean  in a gay way.  He’s thinks he looks like the bomb in that.  I am sick.  Pink?  It will  go with his Ed Buck and Adam Schiff matching bow ties.  🤡
No, what I'm saying you have to look at things critically and objectionabley. I'm unsure of the charities, so I cannot speak on that. The kids in cages were pictures from the Obama administration, and lastly Trump is New York businessman who plays the game.
Who the hell wants an openly racist person at the funeral of one of the most important black activists of his time? Thank God trump backed down. He always does. FKing coward.
Trump has never been convicted of rape, nor has he killed anyone. Also, you never consider the environment in which Trump was in, people throwing themselves at you constantly for money and as a means of coming up in the world. There is so much behind the scenes than we know.
I mean, they know it's so obvious what they're trying to do, right? Tho it is funny they're trying to discredit you by linking you with trump's campaign.
They recited an oath to to Constitution and yet they are OK with Trump's and Barr's illegal goon squads. Silence at a blatant abuse of power.
This just shows how selfish,  scheming,  and corrupt Trump is,  and why he and his party must be thoroughly rebuked in November.
Trump is a racist Trump is anti-science Trump is a criminal
Trump created the best economy America has ever had! You’re welcome for voting for him! I’ll do the same in November. #Trump2020 #WalkAway
If enough Kansans voted this Nov. our ENTIRE CONGRESSIONAL DELEGATION and one of our Senators could be women.  I get where some people will say 'we shouldn't just vote for them because they're women,' but I have only this to say - whom gave us Trump - men.   #TheFutureisFemale
So just because he runs multiple business that makes him an expert on everything?? What a weird way to gauge a person's intelligence, then again that is the exact same reason people voted for Trump so maybe that isn't the best way to knowledge a person is about everything.
If there’s one thing Trump will never be accused of being, its being the bigger man.
...its still primary season, dear.  Also, the last time Delaware vote for a Republican was in 1988.   Also, its Biden's home state.  Also, there aren't any Trump signs (see the first point).   Ugh.
All of the media should be put in jail for murder.  praised hydroxychloroquine, Z-pack, and zinc from day one, but because he’s Trump they knowingly demonized something that could save lives. #TrumpLandslide2020!
It should be given to the TRUMP family first. But maybe add a little bleach first. Just saying.
The only thing President Trump has destroyed is your fragile psyche...
this sound like a whole set up to say votes got “lost in the mail” or some shit and keep Trump in the White House to me...🤔
Don’t need research to KNOW that the TRUMP Administration is corrupt and treasonous. Just watch them. You’ll see for yourself. VOTE THEM ALL OUT. Please please please.
Jason. Is. Dumb. Like. Trump.
That’s you. You’re the one who brought up the Kroger vs strip club argument. Plus he went to get food from the strip club with a mask on. But continue to not answer the question
I’m following the context of the conversation you are bringing in stuff that’s not relevant. If he had chose to shop at a grocery store instead of a strip club. Would you be upset?
We are strictly talking about where he chose to get dinner. While he was wearing a mask. The uproar is about him getting food from a Strip Club.
What really is his agenda as AG? Who is he working for the American people or Trump. Why did he return to politics in the first place? Is the goal to destroy America as we know it today?
Trump seems to be counting on the idea that intubated voters won't vote; but discounts their relatives, as he does his own.
I saw  a 14 year old girl, who was simply walking and watching, violently thrown to the ground and clobbered by several of trump's goon squad.
Desperation is rampant with you David.  You’re losing.  So you’re lying.  Trump hasn’t done one thing.
Still didn’t answer the question lol
So if he had went to his favorite grocery to get his wings would that have been better. You’re mad because he went to a strip club to buy something to eat vs a grocery store
John Ratcliffe just declassified docs proving Comey spied on candidate Trump during intel briefings in August 2016  via
Either carry the same amount of contracting the virus..
America has 330 million people, and the best we could come up with are Donald Trump and Joe Biden? Seriously?
I'll bet you wish trump hadn't ignored and lied about COVID19. No state would have needed as many body bags if we'd had real leadership.
1 minute afternoon on January 20,2021 no matter where the president is physically the military is ordered to take orders from the new president and trump is trespassing on privat property as any ordinary citizen would be. Case closed!
Christie says Americans do not think Portland, Seattle riots are ‘acceptable,’ Trump has to ‘deal with it’  #FoxNews
Well if you haven’t noticed sweetheart we don’t have to bring out Joe Biden we just have to let Donald Trump talk and we can win on that
I know trump will contest the results if he does not win but what i really want is for someone to ask the republican leaders what they would do would they support trump or the constitution that is the real question?
I blocked. A true resister won’t defend Ivanka.  I 🤮 at anything with that last name except Mary Trump.
It’s a shame 150,000 dead didn’t motivate trump and the republicans it was terrible polling that got their attention. #BlueTsunami2020
Someone had to Stand Up
Kansas will go for Trump.   Kansas City can be stupid at times but won’t carry the rest of the state into their stupidity
Fair enough, I'm willing to heap equal shit on Obama for it too. Hating Trump hasn't dulled my disdain for that asshole.
Grrr. Curiously, many of these Trump followers are not afraid of a virus.
The Lincoln Project has people on their project with ties to Russia, financial troubles.  The Lincoln project is a joke.  Rick Wilson, a confederate in disguise, Conway is a piece of trash with a grudge his wife got a job with Trump, the other two one has Russian ties. Losers.
Trump's America.  Putin told him to do this -- to "dominate"
Trump doing judo. didn’t know I needed that visualization today, but thank you. I agree bc you can make your own community on the internet this is potentially the end of nations’ orthodoxies. It’s not you stand for something in particular, it’s just THAT you stand UP FOR ANYTHING
Christian atheist vegan carnivores for Trump!
What is wrong with you David Axelrod?  Saying stuff like that only incites the crazies.  Trump hasn’t lit one fire and tried to stop it before it got like this.  You wanted this not Trump.  I’m going to see if I can sue you for flat out lying to America.  Pathetic.
Let's see, here we see Kudlow, not an economist, 69 degree in history, wearing the mask in an ineffective, dangerous manner, spewing crap both literally and verbally; a fitting Trump cult member.
Seeing as how you have no point other than inexplicably bringing up Trump multiple times and once again fixating on semantics over word choice it appears you have no actual argument.  Good talk.
What does this mean? It appears that Trump is forcing the Federal Reserve to buy up all of the bad loans that are out there and own the debt under stocks through BlackRock’s trading.
The fact is more people support Trump than are comfortable to admit publicly whether that is due to fear of media/public backlash or basic belief they are choosing the lesser of two evils voting conservative.  This line-up however is incredibly telling about 2016 vs 2020.
Because the White House can't multi task? Knowing perfectly well that the Republicans were going to acquit him. Come up with a better excuse. But I get it, Trump was going to use January and February to deny the existence of the virus as opposed to doing it in March and April.
I'm not a polling expert, and we're 3 months from the election, but here's a current picture of the electoral map based on compiled polling data from 538.  (No lead in TX, Trump 0.2 lead in IA)
They won't. I remember reading an article about Trump's budget proposal to cut programs that help his supporters. So, they interview some and one lady said, "I could die without this government program, but as long as he kicks the the illegals out, it would be worth it."
Dear Trump Supporters -  When you finally contract Covid. Or the police kill someone you love. Or you lose your healthcare. Just remember we fought just as much for the rights of YOU and YOUR family as we did for US &amp; OUR family. And you fought hard against us the whole time.
The only one who said "a lot of people say" was you. Nice one. If you want to actually discuss something, cool. If you just want a way to bring Trump into a conversation when he has no bearing on what's being discussed, talk to you later.
hey can are you sure we can’t amend the deadpool rules and put Trump on?
This is a good look back on some of the influencers around COVID lockdown decisions in mid-March, how they were boosted by right-wing commentators, and how they were wrong then, and wrong now.
As we seen in the last election money dont matter. Trump supporters are dedicated! #Trump2020
Another winning weekend for  ! 51 wounded and 3 dead in Chicago this weekend...but please, keep blaming Trump.
are my senators &amp; I write them often.  They NEVER reply. They have, however, given my contact info to gop fundraising lists including trump campaign WITHOUT MY PERMISSION. What corrupt complicit pos they are.
Trump’s national security adviser has coronavirus
The Courthouse is a huge marble and concrete structure which is not going to be destroyed by protesters with firecrackers. However, trump's pathetic border fence got blown over by a little cat 1 hurricane.  It didn't last an hour much less a day. Sad!
Exactly, Trump screams about these so called crimes but acts powerless..if there were crimes his justice dept would be on it
Way to read the room, Melanoma.
The stress of living in Trump USA brought back cancer I beat 14 years ago, but couldn’t complete all my chemo due to Trumpvirus. If I could focus my hate of him into a laser, I could burn down his world.
Yeah , at least Trump is coherent enough to do interviews . Joe cant go ten minutes without dementia kicking in .
President Trump's national security adviser has coronavirus:  #KAKEnews
Trump’s secret police force, coming soon to a city near you.
Is everyone EXCITED??  I know I sure am!!   promised us all a new healthcare plan tomorrow!!!  On July 14th, in the Chris Wallace interview, he said it’d be TWO WEEKS   Surely Donald Trump wouldn’t make something like that UP would he??
Good grief.  150k+ dead from covid, and Trump is waisting time and money (tax payer) on roses.   🥀🥀🥀🥀🥀
This Can't be Good  USA TODAY: Robert O'Brien, Trump's security aide, has COVID
John Oliver calls out Nike, VW, Trump for ignoring Chinese Uighur concentration camps
This pic does my grandfather no justice. 95yro died in March. #democrat with PhD in biology, hated #trump. Hated DeVos &amp; rick Perry, Scott Pruitt too. Served Korea &amp; wwII.  Wish he'd lived to see dotard lose election. #resistance #BlueWave
Numbers,  The numbers have to go down. Trump said so 🤣
we are in the heels of a monumental tax cut for the wealthy, and now need to spend to keep working americans afloat... it’s no mystery as to why trump is trying to scale it back. #Biden #Election2020 #CNN
But Trump said it was a hoax. Didn’t he? It’ll just magically go away?
How the Republican Party opened itself up to the Trump takeover - CNNPolitics ...”they've now curdled into content-free bludgeons to preserve power for the dwindling ranks of white conservatives in a rapidly-diversifying America.”
You know there are journalists on the ground filming and we can see for outselves that's not true,  right? And BOUNCY BALL!!?? Oh noes! Protesters have also blown bubbles and trolled trump's thugs with music. The horror!
Maybe it's just me but if the biggest con man grifter in the world did get conned and grifted I really don't give a fuck. Trump built his entire brand off of fucking people over, it's called karma.
Interesting that that when the radical right commentators and trump makes outlandish claims or poll numbers there is never a reference or link to a article. #onetermtrump
Stanley Kurtz on Trump's latest 'tremendous accomplishment' and why media largely overlooked it
Welp Mr. #Trump ...you got some splannin to Do
This is why I don't understand why trump (or anyone else) wasn't charged with conspiracy. Wikileaks is Russia and they were an arm of trump's campaign.
Hey peons, who cares if you get evicted, don't have money for bills or food, and your kids can't go to school because trump refuses to fund them - 1st escort needs that money to redecorate.
oh look, a media outfit which is in trump's pocket is smearing our VP and trying to create narrative of division before she's even named.  gfy with this biased shit. 1/
Well that's not creepy at all. (also the founders were for the most part diests, if they were religious at all, JFK was Catholic, Lincoln was a skeptic who mocked people like the Xian fundies who flock to trump, and so on)
Not PR angle, but propaganda. That's what trump is creating.
FB was bailed out by the same people who bailed out the bankrupt trump. It's Russian malware.
Weekend Roundup: "Trump's week of retreat" and other embarrassments, as well as the occasional high crimes &amp; misdemeanors:
News media amplifying tRUmp disinfo and normalizing the idea that maybe he can just reject the results. As  says, don't obey in advance. And he and his campaign want to talk about that rather than the people dying due to his purposeful incompetence, or RU bounties.
So do all the rest..I'm in When I see BLM DONATE to a food bank, fund a rec center, provide a home , start a work program, promote reading skills, help secure college educations, educate youth on birth control, not attack bl police officers, bl Trump supporters and bl businesses
Get used to it.. From the looks of those people, if Trump wins, there will be Heart Attacks Everywhere
Trump's America.  It's hard to believe it's come to this.
39% of Texans who answered a Quinnipiac  University poll say Trump is the better choice over Biden for Addressing Racial Inequality. I'm hoping only 20 old white guys did that poll.
Dude. This is a bad take. I expected better from you. This isn't "powerful". This is pro Trump policy propaganda. In what world is it beneficial to anyone other than those already in power to read an article decrying the woes of those in power?
Exactly. My friend (no longer friend because of Trump) literally brags about Trump not taking a salary. I was like you fucking idiot! The cost of all of his golfing is more then like 30 years of presidential salary
Remember that time, Trump invited the taliban to camp david?
Trump said, “It’s the most powerful and comprehensive border wall structure anywhere in the world. It has technology that nobody would even believe.”
Another day another 1000 dead Americans on Trump's watch as Trump builds a wall around the people's house in DC and uses federal agents to cause division throughout the country.
Trump in Helsinki….believes Putin…POTUS is a patriot of Russia!!!
I live in Wichita, KS and sadly I know many people that will freely tell jokes or stories that have a horrible racist slur pop out in the middle of them.  A lot of them are even more emboldened to do so since getting dog whistles (and barks) from Trump.
ignore the near execution of black President Trump supporter Drew Duncomb
they ignore the execution of black President Trump supporter Bernell Trammell
There is still time to stop it!  The UN literally has their employees on the ground working with the "protesters" trying to kill these officers and burn down the courthouse.
Isn't this just typical of a stupid, STUPID liberal! They don't care about people committing crimes until it happens to THEM! Karma!
Wrong..No Bounties. Rioting is not about President Trump genius 🙄 150k hasn’t happened yet... But I see how you like the Dems never let a crisis go to waste. This is happening because of a virus you all weren’t talking about jobs, economy, unemployment when it didn’t suit you
Half of American would say it's Trump's fault. The far left is full of so many idiotic people they'll blame anything on him. They don't just hate Trump, they're genuinely anti-american at this point.
Doesn't need to be the next Donald Trump, I'm sure Cotton is angling for McConnell's role as the manipulator in control of the party.
The. Former. President. Donald. Trump.
The HRC campaign played like all politicians have played. No one would have beat Trump with the help he received from foreign countries. That’s not how it’s supposed to work. Votes were stolen and we know it.
President Trump now says he won't throw first pitch at Yankees game
You were NOT wrong. Makes you wonder how many of the 145,000 would still be alive if Trump had taken this virus seriously, instead of worrying about his ratings.
She's using Trump's words against him. She is making fun of Trump, not the immigrants.
I think I learned that in perhaps second grade. Trump es un poco Bobo.
I’m starting to believe Trump’s “Fence” is a money laundering scheme.
I am not feeling too safe in trump’s America. What a fucking  mess.
Chief of staff: "President Trump won't extend the weekly unemployment boost: it paid people to stay home"
Get them at the Trump rally if you want.
Joe, congrats on writing the first-known biography of our greatest President, Donald J. Trump. #FuckSilence is a tour-de-force education in how government actually works, but most of all, the definitive story of how Trump tested the limits of U.S. presidency to save America #MAGA
That's not what he said. He made the point that things were under control UNTIL Trump sent his goons out there.
Amen to that. So long president trump. Hello President Biden.
Lol trump Bezos benefits more from your tax cut than anyone in this country!
Those who oppose trump are anarchists. Putin puts a bounty on the heads of our troops and trump refuses to acknowledge it. #TrumpHasNoCredibility
You are turning your President’s offer of Federal help against crime in KS City political - not Trump. - so own it. You are flat out lying. Trump isn’t exploiting any thing - You Are.   Playing the Democrat’s poisonous play book.  🤮
I wouldn't put it past Trump to con his cult members into being fake protesters to stir pot in Portland and other cities to justify sending in his stormtroopers!!  All a phony act to get votes. I'm serious the man is crazy enough to try anything!!!
Top story: Radio host mocks Trump by claiming Seattle is peaceful, then rioters torched his apartment building - The Post Millennial - News, Politics, Culture, and Lifestyle  see more
You’re doing the right thing President Trump. We need law and order in these ravaged cities. Thank you for bringing in your federal agents
five states conduct all their elections by mail and di in 2016 but ok.  not to mention trump himself votes by mail.
Trump has endorsed it. It must be demonized at all costs. And I do mean ALL costs.
doesn’t need the Reagan legacy. Our President’s current legacy is as good as Reagan’s ever was (and that’s saying something. Reagan - Russia; Trump - China). These 2 Presidents will have defeated America’s 2 greatest enemies. Trump needs 4 more years.
I knew Trump would try something drastic to stay in power.
Abolish CBP, ICE, and DHS all of which have been used by Trump as essentially a militia to beat down dissenters. Hell no. They can try to step on our necks but will be in for a fight!
I think I need to be more clear with what I mean by “Trump didn’t win.” Many people voted for Trump (or didn’t vote at all) basically as a non-vote for Clinton. Even a lot of democrats. Even though it looks like history is repeating itself I still think trump is more unpopular.
Exactly.  Couldn’t show respect for President Trump, or the office, so none, zip, zero respect for Rep John Lewis. Like John McCain, did something right once; road it’s coattail for celebrity for decades.  🤮🤮
Hurricane Hanna helps Dems. TRump’s ratings go down further and he must now take dementia test again. Can he do it again?🤔
Yeah, that’s true. It doesn’t exist. Trump didn’t win in 2016, Hillary lost. I don’t think people dislike the DNC candidate nearly as much this time and I have faith Biden won’t “win” but Trump will lose because of just how unpopular he is amongst almost everyone in every party.
You know Patrice she is getting a little old for trump and kinda high mileage. You think he will send her down the road after election and get some new ‘talent’ in from Vegas ?
You ought to get off Twitter and study up for the next person woman man camera tv elephant test trump ..
I don't think you realize how country Andale is. You will be in the very very few minority if a Confederate flag bothers you. You will see more of those and Trump flags than you've probably ever seen.
No, you are ignorant. This is Trump’s America.
It's why Trump needs to be crushed in November. Leave no doubt
Just like trumpers have been saying for 4 years that is elections have consequences so when trump loses he may have to be tear gassed to leave the white House but we will get it ready for Joe Biden to move in. #OneTermTrump
This is the TRUMP VIRUS!!! He has let it kill over 140,000 Americans.
Trump was right when he said fake news was the enemy of the people.
and the  know that the only way to steal THIS election is to cheat, so they’re disenfranchising as many Democratic voters as possible   Trump is going ALL IN on authoritarianism, nationalism, and fascism    And #Cult45 cheers him on....
I wouldn't put it past Trump to hire fake protesters to cause trouble in Portland or anywhere else to justify sending in his stormtroopers!!!
It's not a choice.  Stop treating it as such. Funny how news media can't bother investigating why he's allowing Putin to put bounties on our soldiers' heads but is happy to promote trump's propaganda.
Uh oh.  #TrumpIsACompleteFailure
The wall being blown down in anticipation of trump's defeat.
Trump’s skin tone is all wrong, he is far more orange than that
Oh, NOW you are focused on the Trump Virus? Maybe, if you had been focused in March, there would be 100, 000 fewer deaths.  You made this country a horrible place to live.  178 days.
Trump’s tweets 2day alone show he knows zero about political science (doesn’t know difference campaigning 4 pres &amp; being prez),political theory (Leftists tend NOT 2 b “anarchists”),&amp; how schedules work (he can’t throw out 1st pitch n NY even though he literally has his own plane)
July 25, 2020 at 3:43 p.m They are the most highly trained members of the Border Patrol, agents who confront drug traffickers along the U.S.-Mexico border and track down dangerous fugitives in rugged terrain.
But Trump has been a loser his entire life!
Yes another lie from Trump
Who would want to go to the WH with Trump there???
Like President Trump  blames everyone from the Chinese to Democrats for his pandemic response failures????
Let me tell what Lori really said.  I have no control over my city and I hate Trump so much I’d rather see more shootings than have him help me get control of my beautiful city.  Lori is a drug addict.
Think 4 years of Obama and you’ll vote for Trump.  Joe can’t run the country but Obama will just he's been doing the last 4 years.
Probably photo shopped to make Trump look better!
That would make Trump 6’0 and 334#.   Bet I’m pretty close.
lincoln would bitch slap trump if he were alive
Maybe Shrek will represent this POS.  She had better be prosecuted. What about the lying Ambassador?  She told tall tales under oath too.  Trump was onto her quick.
Hmmm. Oddly enough President Trump wasn't on a single plane, unlike Clinton who was logged on 29 flights.. There is a reason those Dirtbags got away with it, yet under Trump this came back to light.. Trump is responsible for taking them out.. Again educate yourself
Good luck with that. Because even though you are a Trump supporter, I'm not, the president listens to idiots like Stephen Moore who doesn't even want 100 dollars extra for unemployment.
What about the man shot to death for supporting Trump?  They can be whoever they want to be.  Lewis was the biggest race baiter ever.  How long is his funeral?  All week?

They take his sarcasm and off the cuff remarks as facts and then turn around and say he lies.. Well politicians lie.. OH BUT Trump really lies!!! He makes fun of that in his speeches “if I say 150 showed up, but they’ll count 151, Liar!” He doesn’t use a scripted speech like O

Fake News is the enemy of the people.. Media; Donald J Trump or President Trump said “All media is the enemy of the people..” There has been lots of edited,altered,misrepresented, forged, or flat out lies by the media! And guess what? It never is to the positive always negative
That actually hurt to read! LOL. I don't believe any poll. I don't think anyone is being honest I mean would you if you got blasted for telling pollsters you support Trump and Repubs in this environment with the unhinged cancel culture left However I myself would tell the truth!
Ask Trump. His goons only come out at night. The protests start long before dark.
trump killed 150,000 Americans.  trump killed our economy.  trump killed our democracy.
Doesn't fit the "Trump is killing us all" narrative.
Hahaha YES the trump voters do!! They need their hand held through out the entire process all the way to the hospital when they cry for mommy and say "I should have worn a mask". Oh and the kicker is that most of these idiots dont have insurance so we foot the bill. Idiots!

biden is not better than trump
Clearly you are not following anyone that actually lives in Portland and is reporting live. You don't have to believe ME. And the only PROPAGANDA is put out by Trump and Wolf. #AnyoneButTrump2020
is absolutely correct. People need to start watching what's happening from the live videos that are posted every single night and not just blindly believing what Trump and his goons are saying.
Democrats are dropping the ball big time on this.. they could use legalization to help beat Trump but are too beholden to their special interests. Pathetic.
Chaos gets rid of Trump.  That’s the objective.  Collateral damage is justified, in their minds, to achieve their objective.  They’re so woke they’re blind.

What the military personnel are doing is illegal. We can’t fight back without being jailed. This is straight up fascism. Do we need to go to war against our government? trump needs to be removed from office. Right effing now.

I have to wonder what the bigger play by Trump is here. Why is he sabotaging the health of his own voters?

You ungrateful pos. Government and Trump don’t owe you or anybody else support, get a job. Try that for a change.
As both Trump and Putin feel backed in to a corner politically, I worry about what kind of chaos they could conspire to create.
What the Fark?  Look at Trump's neck! Is he struggling to keep from shitting himself or is he trying to suck in his belly so hard that his head is ready to explode?
WTF are you talking about?  Any money given to them was done with a GOP majority Senate and signed off by Donald Trump because he is personally responsible for the US being the death capital of the world.
RIP Bernell Trammell.  He was “just full of love.”  Imagine the media frenzy and public outcry if a BLM protestor was shot in broad daylight holding a sign in front of his storefront.
It's not the job of the federal government to fund local police forces.  It's a non-issue.  Neither Trump or Biden should ever consider using federal tax dollars to fund local police that enforce state, county, and city laws.
Because Trump supporters wear Nazi symbols at literally rally or event... because US Neo Nazi chapters support Trump. 🤷🏻‍♂️

The fact that Donald Trump got elected is proof that time travel will never exist.

Putin is making sure Trump’s payment are not going to bounce!
Of course not, states can't even keep up with regular unemployment claims. It's just Mnuchin's way of passing the responsibility to the states. It's analogous to Trump claiming anyone who wants a COVID test can get it, when it's obviously not true.

45 drops out at the last minute to give GOP boost in votes w/ Pence.   Maybe enough to beat a candidate like Biden who’s best attribute is that he’s better than 45  Barr charges Trump with all of his crimes, Pence pardons him allowing him to keep his stolen $ and stay out of jail
This is NOT a department of "Homeland" security rather a department of trump security. (Cue in Fox-not-news.)

Two choices. Joe Biden is Nostradamus, which would be a good characteristic for a president, or Donald Trump is incredibly predictable anytime but particularly when backed into a corner.
Millions of Americans became insured under Obama. Before Obama I had no access to healthcare. Now Trump has destroyed that system. As a single male I pay $650/month with $8,000 deductible. Trump has made ACA unaffordable to many. Where the eff is his "cheaper, better" healthcare?

People, this is the only thing el trumpo is good at: misdirection. Stop falling for this stuff. He wants attention away from deaths&amp; horrible economic news. Trump, who lacks the authority to do so, suggests delaying the election  via
Trump strategy:
🚨Powerful, Amazing and I miss hearing him🚨  BREAKING: Obama, eulogizing John Lewis, harshly criticizes Trump's actions on voting rights, protest response
He says "no one reads more than I do". Yet, he hasn't read that Congress is the only body that can approve any change in voting laws or dates.  President Trump suggests delay to November election, though experts say he lacks the authority to do so"
Look at those Trump voters! #MAGA
Spot on.  I was thinking the same when the news broke of Trump trying to delay the election. Man-child cannot stand former presidents are speaking at one of the greats and he's standing outside pouting because he didn't get invited 🙄
“Misled donors and misdirected funds, funneling them into Trump properties” .....You have to read the whole Snopes article. It’s false in the wording only. Trumps are all cons, grifters, and thieves.
Keep in mind, I say that in disagreeance with this stance. I have no issue walking in maskless to vote for Trump in November.
Add in top of this Biden’s soft ban through taxation of firearms and “high capacity magazines” why would any 2A advocate oppose Trump? He not trying to strip their rights or censor their speech. They know that he can’t delay the election. This is all talk eck.
He knows whats going on is bullshit. It’s all a game and he knows what the media reaction will be. I follow economists that have predicted a ton of events including last election. Algo’s all saying Trump in a landslide. Social media algo also knows which is why all the censoring.
Trump right now!!👇
I asked in another thread if this was on video. The Secretary of State refuses to answer a simple question on Presidential authority to which we all know the answer. Trump can't delay the election but what could the entire GOP &amp; their 40% of Americans due collectively you think?
Trump stans crack me up.
I’ll take “terrifying things that will 100% be attempted by Trump” for 500, please
Yes and he was probably wrong. But please, refrain from “ I told you so” on the very day of his death.  But his inherent message I believe is accurate.  The never trumpers crowd has proven to stop at nothing ....they/you know if the economy can be brought down then Trump’s out.
The Constitution specifies that the Speaker of the House becomes acting President due to a delayed Election. As commander-in-chief, Pelosi could send the military to pull Trump out of the White House.
I think Trump is setting the stage for the launch of his own cable news network in 2020 or 2024.  If he loses, that's fine, because he'll see his next (TV) project as So Much Winning.
Like so many other things, anything Trump does is good, anything his opponents do is bad, even when they are exactly the same things.
Stupidest Donald Trump is all fault and heartless.
Didn't the Dems get exposed for selling Uranium to Russia while trying to blame the Trump administration for Russian collusion only to find out the White House as well as the Dems current presidential candidate illegally spied on someone else's campaign to plant disinformation?
Didn't the Democrats literally rig the last election by ignoring the people's vote for Bernie Sanders who was projected higher than Hillary vs Trump? Weren't the Democrats the ones who funded and armed ISIS in a 3 way bid for Syria with Turkey and Russia?

To be clear though, the GOP has been trying to destroy USPS for well over a decade. This has been exacerbated by Trump being in office, but it's hardly new.

Trump’s back to peddling lies causing Dr. Fauci to, once again, clarify the truth.
Trump’s base trusts him more than science, medical experts, and common sense.   He doesn’t care that his arrogance is most dangerous to his strongest supporters.
DJT had Another chance to do the right thing. Another failure, in a long line of failures. John Lewis was a Great man. Trump is a petty one, at best, who shows little respect for women and people of color. It’s embarrassing.
You don't even make sense as usual. When did New Yorkers flee New York?   The virus spread is due to Trump not locking down the US soon enough. Trump allowed flights from Europe to New York which seeded the virus in New York. All the while claiming this will be over by Easter.
Except when Trump breaks the law
Correlation does not mean causation. He indicated short comings in our pandemic response/CDC. Which makes sense because Trump literally fired the pandemic division of the CDC. There's not one thing wrong he said. The fact that he's being treated like a criminal is ridiculous.

This evil man must go. Please vote on November 3rd. Don’t. Let. Up. Trump floats election delay, lawmakers in both parties reject idea
He's trolling so as to elevate the seriousness of potential wide-spread election fraud with mail-in ballots.  It wasn't a serious suggestion.  Classic Trump technique, which of course triggers the Left's collective heads to explode.
THIS! Trump 2020
Reporter asks Trump to explain his election tweet. See his response         We will drag this motherfucker out -
Obama's jab at Trump gets standing ovation
In my book... anyone....ANYONE...who agrees to have their picture made with Dotard J Trump is a flat-out IDIOT!!!  If I was asked to be in a picture with him, I would say: "FUCK YOU DOTARD"!  Then use sign language - you know - double bird!
Not sure why this week's  episode features an ad from  I'm in KS and the ad was pro-Kobach, "the first statewide elected official to endorse Donald Trump". I was like whhhaaaa?? Alie would not endorse this!
So much more Presidential that tRump already.
Thank you, President Trump!
He full of threats b/c he’s so desperate he’ll try to abuse his power.  He’s too unstable, to trust. He should have been impeached when they had the chance. There’s been so much corruption and obstruction of justice, within the Trump Gov’t, it’s hard to keep up.
Trump has stock in it. Why else would he be pushing it for months? So tired of it all. The election couldn't come sooner.
But supporting Trump is supporting the swamp-expansion project. I’m confused.
Donald Trump doesn’t know what he wants. He doesn’t really know reality. He just says whatever flows from his lips. But his GOP followers lap it up no matter what it is and no matter how farcical
If course trump calls on oan reporter so he can talk about how lucky Portland is trying have feds there
You are caving under the pressure of Trump and his cronies. How disappointing. What happened to your backbone?
Are we living in same country? Job prosperity plans - never implemented in 3 1/2 yrs. Billions in drug money? Where? What happened to it? Human &amp; child trafficking arrests - why haven’t I seen this or heard trump talk about rescues / sentences. Guess you’re not pro-life.
Trump Might Try to Postpone the Election. That’s Unconstitutional.
Is Trump drunk?? #orangevillan
Trump needs to stop beating around the bush.😂 .
I feel great! I knew 20 years ago the trump was a criminal bully. He fooled stupid people then and is doing it now. I feel sorry got you  and your family.
I heard or read this some time ago as trump has been asked this question multiple times. Like I said, better at math. Had I spent less time in the principal’s office I could have learned more. Teacher’s fault.🙄
Take some no doze and wake up tRump. #AmericaOrTrump
Tom, isn't it reall a 24/7 show at this point? You know that line by Lloyd Bridges in "Airplane", "I picked a bad day to stop sniffing glue?". If Trump wins, I'm going to start.
ROAST OBAMA FOR HAVING A LITERAL HATE TRUMP SPEECH AT A FUNERAL
Not one legitimate source for flight logs and even on your fake flight logs, Obama hasn’t been listed.   Trump on the other hand has been photographed with Epstein dozens of times. But y’all don’t talk about that.
If Democrats are for it, I’m against it..... if Democrats are against it, I’m for it
True. The radical left is messing up the vote. I sure hope President Trump can win anyway.  It would only be fair.
The radical left is deliberately messing up the mail. They dream up messes to make - to try to blame other people, like President Trump.
So you still thing Trump is the issue? Why are  all complete morons?
'We will not allow you': Governors slam Trump for floating delay of presidential election  via
#ObamaWasABigMistake.  President Trump is the best president ever.
This idiot, Biden isn't 1/10th the man  Trump is, and  you know it! There is no chance Biden wins in a fair election. AND, that is why you intend to cheat with mail in voting! #GruberLibs
What presidency used to look like? Urbane, civilized, erudite, caring, compassionate! Everything that Trump is not.
That’s 68% of the voters on Trump’s campaign staff.
Paging SEC investigators.  Why in the hell is Kodak, of all companies, receiving money to manufacture COVID drugs?  Could the fact that it's stock price rose 400% in a day after receiving a $765mm loan from the Trump administration have something to do with "why"?  Unreal!
Voters are concerned that Trump’s new Postmaster General will find a way to lose the ballots before they get back to election officials. Trump has already said this will be the most rigged election ever and will do everything he can to prove it.
Pence is one of the most insincere speakers in the world, surpassed only by Donald Trump himself. Take their microphones away.
Who are these poor people. Look at them all! They look as if they really don't want to be there or were rushed in at the last minute. And as always Trump looks totally disinterested.
A 33% drop in GDP is called The Trump Economy.
So Trump thinks we should delay the election. More advice from his mentor Putin?
Only in America have we seen Donald Trump’s lack of leadership lead us to most cases and most deaths of any country in the world. Pence waves his arms and praises an incompetent president like this is a good thing.
Labor Department announced today unemployment rate above 14%. These 8,000 jobs are return to work of a small portion of over 40 million jobs lost due to Trump’s great leadership.
Absolutely NOT!!! If I have to crawl over broken glass to defeat Trump, I will.
The #COVID-19 pandemic has had an unprecedented impact on the construction industry. Tell Congress and President Trump to include significant construction investment for transportation, schools, water, and broadband infrastructure in relief legislation.
Trump has fake Magazine covers hanging at his Golf Courses. 😂😂😂
The economy was booming when President Obama left office. Now, we have the highest deficit ever. We have millions out of work, the worst GDP drop in our history, 150,000 dead from a global pandemic. “Small man” Trump has failed at everything.  #ObamaWasBetterAtEverything
‘It hit me hard’ 🙄 OMG! As if that soulless man ever cared about anyone except himself.  And he picks this exact time to bring this to light?? Trump is so transparent and fake!
I am going to drive my absentee ballot to the election office, because now you can’t trust the US mail with trump’s crony in charge of it.
Nothing nor nobody can be ruder than Donald Trump.  Hit him!
That was Trump not the Chinese.
Trump can’t do that!!
The only embarrassment is Trump!  Why is he constantly ranting on about the election voting?   Calling it fraudulent haha  When he loses and as they’re tossing him out, he’ll be yelling “I won this election”   Remember he wouldn’t shut up when Hillary won the popular vote! 🙄
Why isn't this funeral a "super spreader event" like Libs claimed of Trump's rally? #GruberLibs
It's like Herman Cain will just disappear some day. Trump is a psycho
‘Dominate the streets’  ‘Democrats are animals’  Trump is dictating this garbage  He’s so full of hate   It’s not fully understandable why he wasn’t impeached but if he isn’t removed, America will suffer far worse than it already has.
Trump like 150K others
Trump is doing the  a favor by suggesting delaying the election. They need someone who can stand, speak and be coherent. #GruberLibs
Trump playing the  again, and they have no clue. The DEMS are the ones that planned to steal an election, with mail in voting.  #GruberLibs
Look at those Trump voters! #MAGA
Why isn't the John Lewis funeral a "super spreader event" like Liberals claimed of Trump's rally? And, WHY do  Liberals get funerals when average Americans do not?  #GruberLibs
Haven't been that moved since Adam Schiff gave closing argument in Trump's impeachment.
His suggestion came minutes after the Commerce Department announced that the nation’s GDP, the broadest measure of goods and services produced, fell 9.5 percent during the three months ending June 30, the largest quarterly drop on record.
“Misled donors and misdirected funds, funneling them into Trump properties” .....You have to read the whole Snopes article. It’s false in the wording only. Trumps are all cons, grifters, and thieves.
Trump's exposed and sadistically using his position can't be over soon enough.
I read your article in our local, biased paper in KC.  While you can explain away Trump and slam him all you wish, I’m not quite sure you can explain how, by requiring #VoterID that it makes it harder for minorities to vote.  No one has fully explained this yet.
My President just poked trump in the eye!
Killed by Trump ego and the maskless Tulsa rally
Why are  hacks having a funeral for a man, when we cannot? And, didn't Lewis refuse to go to POTUS Trump's? inauguration? Why special rules for DEMS
Trump chooses to believe a doctor/preacher from a strip mall over Dr. Fauci. The rest of the world no longer respects us. They aren't even laughing at us anymore. They pity us.
Case of ex-Trump aide Flynn to be reheard by full U.S. appeals court
Add in top of this Biden’s soft ban through taxation of firearms and “high capacity magazines” why would any 2A advocate oppose Trump? He not trying to strip their rights or censor their speech. They know that he can’t delay the election. This is all talk eck.
Trump should provide assistance to those that remain and need to get out first
Didn’t Marco Rubio try this tactic on something outrageous Trump said before?
Kris Kobach headed a commission creat by Trump to investigate an alleged 3 million cases of voting fraud. They found nothing, and disbanded. Kobach investigated voter fraud here in Kansas, claim tens of thousands of cases. He found 12. In 8 years.
Hey  - cash me on 5th Avenue.   How bout dat?   *Donald Trump can't delay November's presidential election without Congress, partially controlled by the Democrats, first approving the decision. If he didn't already know this, someone has certainly told him by now!
Some folks can’t stop watching trump fuck up 🤣🤣🤣
You act surprised that there is a bias in the media but you are biased every day you are on the air.  Why not just start off every broadcast with "I hate Trump, so consider my comments in that context".  Be transparent.
Trump's politicization of mask wearing is probably his greatest crime.
He knows whats going on is bullshit. It’s all a game and he knows what the media reaction will be. I follow economists that have predicted a ton of events including last election. Algo’s all saying Trump in a landslide. Social media algo also knows which is why all the censoring.
Trump's politicization of mask wearing is probably his greatest crime.
When they arrest Trump finally for one of his numerous crimes, let’s pray it’s done like his secret police have been assaulting people on the street to arrest them during the protests.  Wouldn’t that be karma! #DumpTrump2020
it’s not unlikely Cain got this at the rally. Trump is killing people; whether through rallies or his complete failure to manage the pandemic on a nat’l level or through abandoning the most vulnerable (low-income communities have alarming mortality rates:
He got sick within the incubation period after having attended Trump’s pathetic Tulsa Rally with no mask. He was an anti-masker.
I asked in another thread if this was on video. The Secretary of State refuses to answer a simple question on Presidential authority to which we all know the answer. Trump can't delay the election but what could the entire GOP &amp; their 40% of Americans due collectively you think?
Trump stans crack me up.
Amen. Trump is a blight
Trump is disturbed.
He praised Trump for not requiring masks at the rally that he went to. The one where it looks like he caught the virus. And then died.  Herman Cain politicized his own death.
it's a particularly bad day for Trump. Look forward to the ads!  McCain, Lewis, GDP, the economy, 152,000 dead, Plantation capitalism, Pence unmasked get together today in Pa, James Lawson, postpone the election! #GoodTrouble
The Constitution specifies that the Speaker of the House becomes acting President due to a delayed Election. As commander-in-chief, Pelosi could send the military to pull Trump out of the White House.
Trump can only be Trump with a supporting cast of a enablers. Mr. Cain chose his path and my thoughts are with the heartbroken family members he left behind.
Trump's tweet about possibly delaying the election because of mailin ballots may just be the final straw for many people.  A lifelong Republican I may be, but there does come a point...
I’m also noticing a lot more desperation from demoratic socialists as well. Bashing Biden and the DNC while praising Trump...
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 Waiting to catch a glimpse of Donald Trump?  😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Don't distory the narrative with exaggerated positions. Yes, Trump's negligence has caused thouthands of deaths during this pandemic. That's not the same thing as premeditated murder.
There's some irony to be mined from the fact that Herman Cain was killed by a Democratic Hoax he caught at a trump rally.
This implies that Trump knew who Herman Cain was, A level of attachment, totally false.  To trump he was just another mindless follower. And he will not give him another thought.
A Closer Look at Melania Trump’s Latest Cause: A Makeover of the White House Rose Garden
A lot of people on this site are saying to ignore Trump on this and it is just a distraction. Pompeo just told you that is wrong. They are 100% looking into this. We are witnessing a government taking a turn into fascism in real time.
It’s called “TRUMP VIRUS”  Thank you 👍🏻
Aw one of the coons dancing at the trump rally got corona virus and died?
He had attended the Tulsa Trump rally
Starting to think that #NFLTop100 putting Mahomes at 4 is the greatest gaslighting we've seen since the last time Trump tweeted out any of his vast conspiracy theories
It's insinuated by including both facts in the same tweet. If we are going to protect journalistic integrity (which Trump is trying to destroy), I just feel we should be careful not to give POTUS ammo for his "fake news" tirades...
Trump is so obviously out of it he needs to be hospitalized IMMEDIATELY!   #TrumpMeltdown  #TrumpIsANationalDisgrace  #TrumpIsUnwell
He put himself at risk and his loved ones, just because Trump said Tulsa wasn’t a concern.
So the  is reporting he contracted it at the rally? If that's true, absolutely should be a news story. If not, than as a professional #journalist shouldn't you be careful with the speculation? Isn't this the thing we blast Trump for?
America is coming for you Trump! Not to mention the many years you will spend in prison.
GDP shrinks by 33% in the second quarter. Trump has ruined the economy. America is voting for
*Major Trump Virus
Should have been Trump.
Trump says COVID-19 is a hoax and we don’t need to mandate masks in March.  said in January it was a real threat and we needed to prepare for it. Joe leads. Trump follows. Vote for Joe.
Maybe Donald Trump should read the entire constitution sometime
The fact that that’s said out loud is so disturbing.  Knowledge of Trump's corruption is obvious but he’s still the president?  The election that put him in the WH was rigged and truth be known, Hillary Clinton is the true President.
Because they hate Trump. Period
Nope... and we all glad u do not have a #medicallicense ... is the PhD you claim to have from trump university?
Yeah right!!  Because America wants to delay getting rid of Trump! 🙄
imo Trump is trying to create chaos  and division in America by sending in Fed troops to cities and stoking fear.  Please continue peaceful protest, identify and discourage the outside agitators and we can get through Trump's last attempts at stealing an election.
These ppl out here blaming Trump for EVERY thing!!!  Can you media types just stop with the narrative push for one fucking minute?!?!?  #TDS
The Ghislaine Maxwell sealed documents get released today. Ignore every single thing from the enemy, (Trump and the GOP) today.
And Trump thought Tulsa was a good idea.  It’s too bad Mr Cain didn’t think about the dangers.
Democrats: we should think about moving the presidential election to a different day Republicans: that's ridiculous Trump: it might be a good idea to move the election up a day or two Republicans:
“Small man”  cannot delay the election. Also.... Tue economy shrank by a record number under Trump.
It should be Trump.
That’s just it, Republicans shouldn’t be in office. Especially, with Trump at the helm!  Common trust &amp; decency have left, a once beautiful America.
Trump the Cain Killer!
Trump just called for delaying the 2020 election. The criminal you covered for during impeachment is now attacking my right to vote.
Trump just called for delaying the 2020 election. The criminal you covered for during impeachment is now attacking my right to vote.
Herman Cain has pasted away from Covid-19 AFTER attending a Trump rally. There should be a message in there some where. RIP Herman.....
You’re a little late, Trump’s been handing us to Putin since that first Oval Office mtg w/ Russians when he was sworn in.
Biden predicted in April that Trump would try to delay the election. April Response-Trump campaign spokesman Tim Murtaugh dismissed Biden's remarks Friday as "the incoherent, conspiracy theory ramblings of a lost candidate who is out of touch with reality."  Really now?
Trump can’t change the election. If no election is held, Speaker becomes POTUS. If anything, people need to take advantage of early voting at the polls. There is usually no wait. If some states don’t offer it, they need to.
Like, it will come down to if enough federal law enforcement sides with Trump or sits it out, vs upholding the law. Decent chance: where the Army falls on the matter, and they have to march in and evict him, or… disband congress.   No reason this doesn’t end in fire and blood.
Hell no. Nope.  We've been suffering since Trump's inauguration. It's HIS turn.
Trump game plan: “DEFLECTION”!  Like we haven’t figured out this game plan after 4 years of his fetid crap.
“Protect” is open to interpretation. How many times have agents been sent in against graffiti? Against protests in past years (1968? 1972?) that involved fed property? Trump’s “protect” = go provoke riots so I have reason to call off elections. And kill /maime while doing so.
Anyone still think Trump will exit quietly?
Oh he’s a racist, you can choose to ignore it, you can excuse it, you can even condone it - doing so says who you are. But here’s who he is in all his racist glory.    Educate yourself.
Someone out there help US with this one. Can Trump actually postpone or cancel the election?
Say it again, Joe. April 2020:  Biden accuses Trump of trying to delay election
Trump has broken the law at least once a week since he took office. He knows he can’t legally delay the election, but he can declare a national emergency and issue an Executive Order to delay election which insures it will be tied up in courts for weeks or months. #CorruptTrump
Trump
Folks!! If you haven't figured it out by now. The only person we have to worry about corrupting our election is Trump. He will completely dismantle our voting systems and the USPS so voters can't vote and votes can not be counted.
Trump floats election 'delay' amid claims of voting fraud (from  Obviosly Trump has never read the US Constitution, he has no powers to delay either a vote or the inauguration #dumptrump
TRUMP VIRUS  Fixed.
It's a smear campaign against President Trump   Democrats in power and behind the scenes are praying for higher death counts.    They are sick!
Mr. Trump has 84M followers. The other guy has less than 800K. I don’t think that is a valid comparison.
Yep.  I am one of them .  Who else is with me?  Trailing badly in polls, Trump points to ‘hidden’ voters and the ‘silent majority’ as path to victory
It amazes me how lazy these GOP candidates are.  Each one of them are simply hooking their wagon to the Trump crazy train and calling it a campaign. No original thoughts or plans from what I can see.
$100,000 to sit with Trump? How much do you need to pony up for a hooker to piss on him?
Trump still worse.  He doesn't wear a mask   😎
Trump’s back to peddling lies causing Dr. Fauci to, once again, clarify the truth.
He can get it directly from trump and the stockpile
The Trump survey in front of the video did not help to sleep, however
Trump ain't gonna blow you, homie
Hoping that #Sharpton will give the eulogy for #BernellTremmell .  Pretty much crickets from  , #BLM, #SPLC, and ALL THE HACKS in the #MSM.  It’s as if, HIS black life didn’t matter because he was a #Trump supporter. Odd, the narrative. Or lack, thereof.  Some lives.
DJT had Another chance to do the right thing. Another failure, in a long line of failures. John Lewis was a Great man. Trump is a petty one, at best, who shows little respect for women and people of color. It’s embarrassing.
Their belief that they can yell/talk over opposition all the while, #fingerWagging and #AirStabbing.  Or using poor sales tactics:  “We all know this is not the case”. . .”We can all agree that healthcare for all is. . .”.  “Trump has caused more ______and the R’s ______ so”.
Gosh. When did we last have a VP who wasn't ambitious? Pence has ambitions of a cozy life deep in trump's ass. Biden clearly had ambitions. Cheney was a fucking megalomaniac. Gore wanted to be POTUS. So did Quayle. Why, this almost sounds like racist/misogynistic bullshit.
Oh deal lord, if I didn’t agree with your politics I’d assume you were a trump supporter...
Right wing loons are all hawks until Trump says to pull troops from Germany, then it’s a good idea.  100% believe his 2% target rants so assume Italy and Belgium are on target as they get more troops. Which… is utterly not true.
Thoughts on this???? High on independents low on dems and Republicans.
YMCA as Trump exits. This has to be clipped for your show!
Wonder if  has his sharpie ready?
Did he and Donald Trump attend the same medical school?!
Am I wrong to think this is perjury and lying to Congress? Those are STILL against the law, right?? Barr Repeats Trump Falsehoods in Congressional Testimony
First you want troops in Michigan, but condone same BLM behavior, now want to put Trump followers in jail. Do you hear yourself. Wait till Trump wins again. Then what.
“Trump apologists say that before covid-19, all was well. ‘All’ means only economic metrics: An American is supposedly Homo economicus, interested only in consumption, to the exclusion of civic culture.”— George F. Will
It’s time that we all need to come together, Democrats and Republicans alike, in a bi-partisan effort for America. If you support Donald Trump, please drive with your headlights ON during the day. If you support Joe Biden, please drive with your lights OFF at night.
Hold on Satan just got in touch with me and said a Trump is a Satan “Worshipper”.  Now that sounds more like it🤬
The bad news is trump may soon moving to to your white privileged neighborhood
I just did it and got the same results.  Is this where we ask you to tell Trump? Disturbing.
I spoke to God and he doesn’t know who “this Trump guy” is🤬
The  is giving GOP senators no incentive to vote against Trump’s next SC nominee.
“Too many of the Republicans were focused on playing put upon and abused. They seemed more interested in Trump Jr.’s Twitter habit and throwing out accusations of anti-Americanism at the only executive of color testifying.”
Trump is dishonest, corrupt and incompetent. Because of this no one trusts anything coming out of the Trump Administration. No one has any reason to believe the CDC and FDA will be allowed to function without Trump’s interference.
I’ll just leave this here.
Trump is the reason a vaccine will not be trusted. In March he was insisting on a vaccine in weeks, even as CDC and FDA officials explained a safe vaccine would take 12-18 months. Trump has already contracted for millions of doses of a vaccine not even tested yet.
Apparently an arrest and they did it very quick without squad cars.  Your just never happy and want a a SOCIALIST FASCIST STATE like the rest of you Democrats! #Orwellian   President Trump believes in Freedom if Soeech and #USConstitution
I remember this and have been thinking about it for some time. If EVERY person were to ask these questions and answers them HONESTLY, there is no one that could vote for trump.
Donald Trump makes me furious that I don't believe in hell.
Truth. And Trump would have been molesting the underage teen girls for sure-never would have lasted.
The only thing Trump’s cognitive test shows is that he’ll be able to stand trial.
I try to avoid acting shocked at anything that Trump does, because he's just always been this way, but sometimes I still get caught off guard by how open he is about some of the shit he does.
"Unimaginable"? Heck, no. I hope the military wouldn't support a guy who passed on questioning Putin about bounties. As Trump demurs, an unimaginable question forms: Could the president reach for the military in a disputed election?
My friend lives in PA, in Philly, and he sees many Trump 2020 flags and signs everywhere. He says he sees 3 Biden signs out of 100 political flags of either Trump or Biden. And a majority of his friends are Trump supporters.
Trump had this doctor speak about COVID and she said all this dumb shit. Turns out she believes in demon semen too??
Under Trump’s (lack of) leadership America has the greatest number of Coronavirus cases and the greatest number of Coronavirus deaths of any country in the world.

Schwab opposes Trump's suggestion to delay Nov. election
Cain risked his life to go to a Trump rally. John Lewis risked his life for AAs to have equal rights and justice. But knowing you I can see why you hold Herman up to such high esteem.
Definently made me want to vote for trump
"I'm not a pedophile I'm just voting for one." The right can say the same shit about the left. I don't get why we continue to rip Trump like Biden is any better. Both are horrible individuals that SHOULDN'T even be running for president.
Trump’s been playing rope a dope with you guys since at least 2015. We the people are just tired of it. Why don’t you write a story about that?  Write about OUR change in tone.
To have it all end because he was following Trump and chose not to wear a mask. Gotta go. Obama’s on.
So are you ready to jump in the race to help your party? I’m sure you can handle losing 3 times. Twice to Trump. Nobody will go for the Biden/Harris ticket tho. Only you can save the day. You need to do it before your court date on Sept.9th tho.
It won’t wake them up. Cain was IN the hospital when he tweeted masks aren’t mandatory at Trump’s July 4th event. In all caps he said “PEOPLE ARE FED UP”. He was encouraging people to go to an event that wasn’t safe.
Donald Trump MUST resign.
Donald Trump: We will vote you out of office.
So, hows that demon sperm taste, Trump? #NoOneLikesTrump
Umm, thinking Roger Marshall is a contender. He’s forgotten great chunks of medical school in service of Trump sycophancy.
Means no one will come to work so I’m exhausted. Means you keep unemployment high so people won’t vote for trump. Means you and all ur friends are lazy and selfish.

When I was volunteering in hospitals and needed help and supplies, I reached out to    He delivered for Kansas immediately.  The work continues, and I’m glad President Trump is filling the cubboards and getting a vaccine in record time.
These guys are really going to entice suburban white wonen to vote for Trump.
Basically the Trump “sources” feed to the media like Haberman, Costa, etc whatever narrative they want out there and the “journalists” just regurgitate whatever they’re fed.
You will destroy Trump If you could get Alec Baldwin to do an ad as Trump. He would crawl into Melania’s rose garden and cry.
Ooooooohhh. Trump gona be pissed.
🎙 Kobach not banking on Trump endorsement in U.S. Senate race
Trump admin wants to cut off unemployment benefits, thus putting millions of Americans out on the street.  But has no problem taking money from taxpayers so Melania can have a project to keep her busy.
It’s actually insulting for the campaign of the confederate flag to think they can sway black and brown Americans to vote for Trump.
You might want to also investigate Trump and his use of Epstein and Maxwells services.
Just a heads up to anyone that has me on facebook. As of the 1st I am abandoning that social platform due to the political ties that Mark Zuckerburg has to Trump and his administration. Argue as you will, I feel it must be done.
This might not be entirely the case if enough people wake up and bail off of Facebook in recognition of Mark's clear ties to Trump and his complicity at this point.
THIS IS HOW TRUMP TREATS HIS VETERANS
If my vote goes to trump because Russia rigged this election again I will sue the trump administration for not taking the action to secure our election

This was literally tweeted at the same time Trump was tweeting crazy stuff.
Trump is going to focus? Really?
via  “Trump is stunningly incompetent..., ruthlessness of federal forces has inflamed the protests..., huge throngs of Portlanders..., protect their city..., jackbooted federal thugs....  This is a democracy and not a dictatorship.”
Covid should be the top of mind but he should get those kids out of the cages and reunite their families. Then go about overturning all Trump’s executive orders.
Yah, we’ll see how tough he is when the money runs out and Trump’s poll numbers drop even more.  can get what Americans need by holding out and making sure republicans get the blame.
I think the train has left the station. Unwillingness of Republicans to hold Trump accountable will write the story.
I’ve been really disappointed with my family members who are die hard Trumpers. I try hard to stay away from politics with them even though they try to suck me in. What really hurts is my brother and I are bi-racial and the  excuses they use for Trump’s racism is appalling.
Until it's been passed by the Senate and signed by President Trump, it's not yet law.  It's a great bill, though, and will benefit Republicans in blue states as well as Democrats in red ones.
Lol what a creepy old dude
Wow!  A black man blasting Dems while cussing is really going to make me, a black woman, vote for Trump. Not!
IF YOU EVER WANT TO PREDICT HOW THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA WILL LOOK LIKE IN ANOTHER 4 YEARS OF TRUMP'S PRESIDENCY, LOOK AT NORTH AND SOUTH KOREA. THERE IS A REASON, WHY SOUTH KOREA'S FLAG IS FULL OF OCCULT AND DIVINATION SYMBOLS.

via  MUST WATCH. Immigration Nation. On Netflix August 3, 2020.
The word is that Trump likes sadism, having power over people’s survival. And he likes making choices that reward loyalty to him. Sick situation.
I think he’s using reverse psychology. He wants Trump to lose.
President Trump 😎 🙏 is a good President Wise up 😎 👁️♥️🙏
If no reporter asks Trump about his call with Putin today and why he didn’t bring up the bounties (cause we all know he didn’t), you should be fired.
It’s funny how he and his family have spent so much time saying Biden isn’t all there, yet Trump’s the one taking the cognitive tests and defending his own mental agility.
I really don’t this is going to increase Trump’s poll numbers. But whose gona tell him?
He did the same thing to HC. And from the beginning of the re-election campaign, he’s been saying Trump was going to win and without a doubt Biden will lose. Maybe he’s trying to help prove himself right.
Trump is the first OPENLY racist president. He’s the first to say the quiet part out loud.
From day one you said Trump would win re-election. You said it constantly. You dogged on Biden everyday saying he could never win. You dogged on HC and did your part to suppress the black vote. Now you’re on to Obama. Why don’t you be a leader instead of a whiner? Getting old.
She’s the one who gave Trump cover to open the economy up too early. Now that Trump wants to pretend to act like a president she wants to pretend to act like a scientist. She has no credibility.
This IS Trump’s America. He’s the president NOW and it’s happening NOW.
I DON'T CARE, IF YOU ARE DEMOCRAT, REPUBLICAN, OR UNAFFILIATED, THE WAY DONALD J TRUMP IS HANDLING PORTLAND, OREGON IS EXTREMELY UN-AMERICAN.
This IS Trump’s America, moron.
A pox upon Trump and his family, A curse upon the administration and any that support them, A hex upon the house that aligns with Trump and his people. None shall escape the wrath of a people seeking justice.

Trump 2020
Too little, too late? Trump embraces masks in an about-faceTrump really can go catch COVID anytime now. I'm not holding him back.
the Republican Party no longer exists.  You and your trump cult followers have totally killed a once proud party. A party that stood for things Americans could be proud of. Hard work. Strong military. Family. Now it’s just a cult. #Congrats
Karen, the second part of your statement would apply so aptly to Trump. Talk about hatred for others.
They were actually going to do something but abandoned plans because of bullshit political pettiness. Trump could've been a hero and be coasting to reelection but now is struggling and threatening to upend our democracy because he's a failure.
I’d be curious how veterans that support Trump can still do so after seeing this.
Kansas secretary of state says no to Trump’s proposed delay of the November election.
How can trump say the jobs report looks good but over a million people filled for unemployment.
Kansas Secretary of State Scott Schwab opposes Pres. Trump's request to encourage the delay of November elections...
He committed treason by ordering the spying on the Trump campaign.  He also ordered the targeting of Michael Flynn for destruction.
1-877-Cops For Trump  C-O-P-S Cops For Trump
Trump has no power to delay the upcoming election. This is just a desperate plea because he knows he is losing.
Apparently you have arrived. Trump is a new Christian, stop hating and pray for him. Do you still drink milk? He does. What a pity your going to use the word of God to condemn, that’s not at all what that scripture is referring to. Ok, be perfect!
Look at handle. Not actual trump. Parody account.
The Republican sycophants should have realized by now that Trump doesn't joke.
Dumbasses. Virus came from Europe too...no ban. Thousands still came from China AFTER the ban. Just like trump...blame everybody else. #NoBallsGOP
No, I would resign if my boss required me to stand up and greet Trump.  Or perhaps call in deathly ill that day.
After President Trump suggests delaying the November election, Republican Kansas Secretary of State Scott Schwab issues a statement asking the state's congressional delegation not to move the election. #ksleg
Cal Thomas: If Trump Doesn't Intervene, Seditionists Will Destroy America
So who thinks that waiver of liability Herman Cain signed to go to the trump rally is gonna hold up? #contractlaw
Isn’t Trump the anarchist if he tries to ignore the Constitution and the law in order to delay the election? He’s already ignored or broken so many laws he probably thinks one more won’t matter. WRONG!!!!
“The son of real-estate magnate Donald Trump was bashed in the head with a beer stein early yesterday morning in a dispute at a Manhattan comedy club that was no laughing matter.”
You also must avoid common sense, peer reviewed studies &amp; anyone who doesn't buy into political lies.   N95 masks are the only actual help in contaminated areas.   You can riot/protest w/o masks in the 1000s, but don't dare sing in church, go to a Trump rally or a hair salon. TDS
Trump because of US bases in Germany are spreading virus. Let's bring them home.
We don't need Trump in office one day longer.

"it's not fair! the sun is made of florescent light! get me my lantern!" -- Trump tweet sitting in his drafts
I’m sure it helps Biden that he’s been involved in something like this before. They passed along a playbook and a team of people to Trump administration it shouldn’t be too hard for Biden to get that set up again/
Go to hell, Pelosi! If you think President Trump is going to just surrender the USA to you and let it be Deep State and let Hillary Rodham Clinton be Supreme Leader instead of horror of horrors POTUS...you’re Nutsy!
Is it weird that I still text my deceased husband? So much going on today, he'd be fired up for Trump.  #MAGA #Trump2020 #Trump2020LetsSaveAmerica
"Trump tells voters in suburbs they will ‘no longer be bothered’ by low-income housing"
Maxwell is a monster and she will lead to other high profile monsters. tRump has already established himself as monster.
The Trump suit is just *chef’s kiss*.
Or what? Vote Trump? It’s obvious to me Joe Biden can take us down a path to clam..we won’t have constant worry everyday..we won’t have an idiot in the WH..if that’s not enough to vote for him..then vote for your buddy in the WH..
MJF wearing a Trump suit tonight.
I was not under the impression that you supported Trump.
Trump
I nominate Donald J Trump.
I love my diverse neighborhood with lower and moderately priced homes and rentals. What I want to keep out are the racists and grifters like the people Trump constantly tries to purchase.
Have you not heard Trump talk recently he couldn’t even give you a simple answer to a simple question. He talks like a third grader he can’t complete a sentence. I don’t even think he could tell you what comma slices is. He is the dumbest person on the planet
I’ve not heard anyone who has any authority over anything say this other than Republicans acting like democrats are wanting to abolish the police to try and scare people. Have you seen the Trump campaign ad about this?
Wait, didn’t trump take and support this months ago? 🤔 #fishyfishy
I don't see how sending unneeded and unwanted troops into sovereign states will help Trump's reelection but that's what happens when you have a fascist dictator as president.
Seems like it’s not Dems that can’t hear the truth. It’s sad that after 4 years you still can’t tell that Trump is nothing but a conman robbing us blind. His AG works as his lapdog yet still no arrests on the Dems side while the repubs around the pres are dropping like flies.
I'm finally back to writing.  It's my first serious work in the scholarship of teaching and learning.  It's called "Bring Back the Trivium! Rhetoric and the Backfire Effect in the Biblical Studies Syllabus."  It's about how I responded as a teacher to Trump's election.
I’m not saying it’s all Trump’s fault, but would we be here if we had a different president. Would we be talking about a woman that thinks alien dna is used in medicine?
The Repub primary ads here boil down to “I love Trump more than the other people running and I’ve committed fewer/less severe crimes than they have.”
At the pace Democrats are increasing their hyperbole, by October they’re gonna be telling us President Trump single handedly killed every black person in America.   #PutThatInYourPipe
If Trump is so bad, why do you have to lie to attack him?
What will they do about it? Absolutely nothing .. Vote Trump out is the answer ..
She needs to get over Sanders not being the nominee and support Biden. The other option is Trump and Barr.. what will she do?
Biden is a good man.. Enough said .. if your such a proud socialist..support this man and perhaps you might be surprised what gets done. The other option for you is Trump .. What will you do?
So why the strong interest in the US? Looking from the outside you should see the pain Trump has caused. He stokes the desire that many conservatives have of America changing back into some kind of imagined 1950’s dreamland of perfection (that never existed)
Since we’re talking, I’m curious about what specific policies of the Trump administration or the Republican Party in general that you think have improved the nation?  There’s a lot of social, environmental and international stuff I don’t like about them.
I’ll disagree on your views of Trump. I look collectively on his actions &amp; think he’s done far more damage than good. His temperament seems unsuited for the job.I don’t know if he’s racist BUT if you look at a lot of MAGA accounts A LOT of RACISTS think he supports their views.
“More enterprising than Donald trump”  😐
coming soon to a fascist Trump-istan near you: Trump cancels general election, declares martial law.  he's watching Hong Kong to get tips, not because he's concerned.
I've rarely seen where he's not.  he does need to toss in a few more, uh, colorful adjectives once in a while. the G**a "bullshit" spot was an amazing massacre of Trump's inability to focus on anything other than himself.
No, I was responding to your premise that Democrats are the only ones pushing a narrative that is not true or not completely true. Certainly Republicans and more specifically Trump Republicans have done much of the same.
Mister trump is failing health wise whatch closely.  Lost concentration during press conference. Wooble when he leaves the conference.
When Does America Reckon with the Gravity of Donald Trump's Alleged Rapes? | GQ  #TrumpEpstein #ChildTrafficking
this is Trump's America. a journalist reports fact and is accosted by Twitter idiots.  LPT: never apologise for giving facts which can save lives. there are no "alternative facts".
YOU DIDNT LET THE MAN SPEAK. BUT IT DOESNT MATTER BECAUSE YOU WEREN’T LISTENING ANYWAYS. Ya’ll people need to wake up and see what the fuck is going on. People think Trump is the enemy. But let me tell you. He’s the only one fighting for you.
remember the War of 1812? the White House burned to the ground. if Trump attempts any of that crap, it's going to be all of America.  personally, I'm joining the Coalition of United Western States.
Trump will build it all and some democrat will try and take credit for it in 2024.
TRUMP IN ASIA" — A Bad Lip Reading  oh damn, I wish this was actually our potus #TrumpleThinSkin #BunkerBoy #FredsFailure
Definitely applies to Trump
The WORLD is sure doing a great job working together to make tRump look bad. #TrumpleThinSkin
The only reason Trump is trying to get rid of Obamacare is because it has the name Obama. He has yet to come up with a healthcare plan of his own this is a vindictive strike by the pinhead. Period
If Biden wins COVID-19 will suddenly disappear from the headlines. If Trump wins it will stick around like a bad virus.
Barr also said it's fine for a president to accept foreign help in elections depending on the type of help before revising his answer as no, it's not acceptable.  He also hinted that Trump could move election day, something given to Congress in the Constitution.
Barr also mentioned he's talked with Trump about reelection--something Hillary got in trouble for (Bill and AG Lynch)  Barr doesn't think taking someone into custody and questioning them is an arrest, SCOTUS says otherwise.
That's not the scene I'm seeing. They're holding his feet to the fire and he's flinching on numerous questions, lying about things we have on record from him. Ex: Barr said he didn't know Trump tweeted about Roger Stone having guts but it's in the Mueller Report Barr approved.
what are you going to due for Mr. Trammell
If trump wins she won’t have a choice
what do we call you? Mr. Return - we know what is going on in DC - to bad  does not know what is going on in #Portland he say Antifa is a myth. I'm sure you don't know shit about what is decent. Where is the outrage about Mr. Trammell
Again, Trump is above the law!
where is the justice
Where is the justice
the GOP failed all of America in January with their sham impeachment trial. there is no possible way that any sane human could read the case against Trump and not vote guilty. but the GOP lost their minds and remained Trump's personal shit-shiners.
who needs a lie detector? his own statement a couple months ago about Trump's tweets verifies he is lying.
and that's a lie. Barr said Trump's tweets were a problem for the doj.
Tired of listening to Barr   And Jordan who wants to keeping fighting with Obama and Clinton. Detractors and liars for Trump.  Won’t end till we throw out these mobsters in November
A federal court ruled that Trump's twitter feed is a "public forum" and is therefore subject to the First Amendment. It is literally illegal to censor Trump's twitter.
They are sacrificing their own cities. They don’t want to accept the help. In their minds it would make Trump look good. You have to acknowledge that’s very fucked up. And on that point how does burning down a federal building help anything?
Can you at least see the extreme media bias towards the left right now? Look at all the cities that have rioting/looting right now. What’s the one thing they all have in common? The answer is Democrat mayors: These mayors are denying federal help just to make Trump look bad
Must have received her degree from Trump University.
Exactly. And that is one of the things that I am disappointed in Trump with. He is arresting some people but I can count on my fingers how many and he really isn't breaking up these riots.

Story:
Trump lies about everything..#LyingTrump
If that’s true, and he wants to work in Hollywood, seems to me the dumbass would quit supporting trump.  #DumberNJamesWoods
assignation - this should be the biggest news - he just gave an interview supporting Trump and they killed him for that.
Trump's best tweet of the decade. #LyingTrump
I just want to point that Trump's attack on mail-in voting is an attack on your local post office, your elected election officer, the people volunteering their time to count ballots, your county commission, and your secretary of state.
Putting her pride above her citizens and that’s pretty messed up. God forbid she accepts federal help, in her eyes that would make Trump look good. If you don’t believe Chicago is a problem I really don’t know what to tell you. And I’m not saying this because the mayor is black
So I agree with pretty much everything you just said except the Chicago thing. If I was black I would be petrified to live in Chicago and the main reason is because of the mayor. She would rather fight with Trump and make him look bad then accept his help. See to me she’s
What is your solution, get the Trump supporters one at at time?   Are you telling me the Federal Government does not have the right to protect our property?
I’m sorry speaker Pelosi correctly termed what it is… It’s the Trump Virus... You’ve accomplished more than Dr. Kevorkian ever did illegally.
Another solution: The algorithm works on how much YOU talk about something. If Trump doesn't want to see terrible trends about himself then he needs to quit tweeting about himself.
Jared should explain how algorithms work.  Doesn't Trump get most, if not all, of his Twitter from his phone where you have to go to a different screen to see the trending topics? Easy solution to not see what people are talking about: Don't press the 🔍 button.
So...turns out the reason Trump is not throwing out the first pitch for the Yankees on August 15 is because he was never actually asked to do it. What a surprise.
Trump isn’t an actor.  At least Reagan had that.
The assassination of a Trump supporter should be bigger news.
Fuck Trump
West of Salina is Kobach country, nonstop Kobach signs. You might be overestimating Marshall’s appeal out there versus the Trump effect. Kobach is the Trump candidate for most Rs.
Bs info just to scare ppl like you, look at the states that have those “outbreaks”. Their republican states and all this is to get trump out
it would be a hard pass for me as well.  Trump supporter is tolerable if they are doing the right thing and wearing a mask. I mean, even the idiot in chief has begrudgingly endorsed mask wearing.
That’s why I’m voting Trump!!!
That Trump has paid at least one woman to have an abortion and considered himself pro-choice until 2016, it's very strange pro-lifers rally so hard around him. But not surprising considering Trump's disregard for life outside the womb.
Pure trump logic..repeat it often enough some idiot will believe it!
Our latest podcast features  who says he hasn't asked  for an endorsement, and doesn't expect one, ahead of the GOP primary for U.S. Senate seat #ksleg #kssen
Trump has zero idea of what unity is. He chooses hate and division. The fact he does not see the harm he is doing is scary to this country. If he would just stop looking at a mirror and actually look outside, things may improve. Less than 100 days and his mirror gets shattered.
Actor Tom Selleck: ‘I Would Say “F*ck You” To Anyone Who Wants Donald Trump To…’
Watching the Jeffrey Epstein Netflix Doc and all of that is DISGUSTING!!!  Another fact: Trump has always been an ugly ass mother fucker and a piece of shit who loves children, or to touch them
No the only way President Trump can win is by cheating so he needs everybody to vote at the election booth so he can have somebody hack into the booths and change the results just like last election! No your fax get off your Fox News Juicebox!#facts
Only by PRESIDENT Trump to stop the domestic terrorist in our streets
😢 FUCK YOU TRUMP,  I am sick of seeing this fucked up BULLSHIT, since you took office!!! We want and need our country back and you and your fucked up clan of idiots gone!!! #TrumpCantKeepItUp
He was promoting it. He was just talking that it looked promising. The fake news made it political and then the democrats jumped and continued on. Really look at the history.  I remember back in 2016 there was a saying “President Trump could find a cure for cancer and still gripe
Imagine if this was a trump rally. Still waiting to hear something positive BLM has done with the tens of millions of dollars they’ve received in the last 3 months? #Hypocrisy
Everything wrong with America under trump, in one picture!
Exactly.  I don’t support the violent protestors, but I support them more than the police firing rubber bullets into the crowd.    Protests were dying down.  That wasn’t good for a Trump, so he sent the secret police in.  Predictably, now they are violent again.  It’s on Trump.
Trump will be demanding Mexico refund the money he spent on that atrocious piece of crap.
Interestingly, if Trump was wise, he’d do everything he can to stay out of the news so the media has to focus on Biden.  But he’s an attention whore, so that won’t happen. 😂
Letting Trump stay front and center is working for him, so I don’t really see the benefit.  Quite a bit of that vote isn’t voting for Biden, but against Trump, so his best strategy is to let Trump ruin himself.  This year, the media’s obsession with Trump is working against him.
That’s the problem with Trump’s short attention span, he never finished the last tome of The Three Little Pigs.
Creepier yet...Epstein had Donald Trump's daughter Ivanka in his black book...very #Suspish.  Considering how far back he knew Trump...all the more gross...that he's watched her grow up...🤮
Thank you.  Trump has an excuse, but we all know who pulled the strings:  President Donald Trump has backed out of throwing the first pitch at the New York Yankees’ Aug. 15 game, citing what he called his “strong focus” on solving the coronavirus crisis.
Black trump supporter gets killed no news coverage f reversed would be all over the news
my maternal great-grandfather fought Nazis. my paternal great-grandfather fought the confederacy.  Fascist, racist Trump and his fascist, racist supporters make me sick to my stomach.
Trump was asked to draw "Martial Law"
I am here to adjudicate you.  Marco Rubio, in the matter of The United States of America v Donald John Trump, you have been found guilty of conspiracy to commit crimes against America and American citizens.
Because they are stupid just like Trump..
Trump is a bitch! There is nothing anyone can say that prove otherwise. This racist POS needs to go in November!  He's the laughing stock of the world. #fredsfailure #VoteBlue2020 #maskup
I had a joke about Donald Trump, but you have to give me something to hear it.

These are no longer protest for they are a riots. Everyone who joins in is part of the riot. Trump should bring on the 82nd airborne Rangers. No one can be allowed to lot and burn.
We need to go to the polls for voting. Give 1 week time to get it done, otherwise wise trump will ask for a recount of mail in ballot and that could take a lot longer.
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
Is that Robert E. Lee in the back? I'd think he's a Trump supporter.
Why so angry? I’m just pointing out the statistical truth.The nation’s problems won’t be solved unless we understand problems all people  a”deplorable” don’t you feel you have unique problems that have been overlooked? Isn’t that why you support Pres. Trump
I just got an oximeter yesterday.  Brother-in-law has been very sick with Covid.  Testing very tough to get in Topeka and results are taking longer than 14 day quarantine.  We need a national testing program but Trump is too inept and doesn’t give a damn.
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
If you can't see the totalitarianism from #trump you may also be Evil. #powertothepeople #occupylove
You are overestimating the wrongness of the polls.  Trump narrowly won a few states that were polling close.  That was a lucky draw for him, but it was entirely predicted by 538 as a likely outcome. Bit just wasn’t the most likely outcome.
Could you imagine a Trump v Biden? Winner gets the White House for 4 years. Trump throwin’ haymakers.
Dementia Donald Jim Jones comrade fascist Trump... sweetheart to Putin, Xi and Kim Jung-Un... The opposite of George Washington
Idk that it’s COVID, but that Trump has been slowing them down on purpose 🤷🏻‍♂️
I remember posting that if you support tRump you support racism back in February &amp; some of my friends spammed me with hate. Guess what folks, it's still true!
All of her tweets read like Donald Trump wrote them
🤣🤣🤣 I didn't vote for Trump, won't be voting for Trump in November, but you guys are pathetic.
Obviously we are both passionate about our causes. I appreciate yours because it’s honorable and important, but I am worried anout the whole world, or at least our country, and how the Trump/MAGA movement is destroying it. So I’ll leave you to your mission. Peace!
Everyone in incensed by what’s going on in this country. But some of us realize it’s Trump and the conservatives fault. End the failed Trump experiment.
Trump has changed or achieved nothing for the positive. Worst and most failed president of all time. Experiment over. Time for the deluded and hypocritical conservative movement to dissolve into obscurity forever.
When trump looses he is going to incite a civil war.  It's going to be ugly
real women vote for trump stuck in my head....
Trump is possibly the most prolific liar of all time. If he says something, the opposite is most certainly true. All politicians may be corrupt, but he is infinitely more corrupt than the worst politician.
I’m not screaming against Trump like a liberal, I’m doing it AS one. Proudly. And if you think a video of Trump proclaiming that he left the “insiders” to fight for the people is going to do anything but convince me of the exact opposite, you’re wrong.
Well it’s funny how I don’t hear all you Anti pedo crusaders railing against Trump and his inner circle since he’s OBVIOUSLY one of the biggest members of this secret ring. I’m not against stopping anyone hurting the innocent, but it’s about priorities. Trump out first!
Does he not know he’s going against all of his self interests? Assuming he’s not straight, he’s not welcomed by republicans and or trump admin. But I bet being him must be real lucrative and provides for his family for generations to come. Fuck him too 🤷🏽‍♂️
is a complete idiot!  should be ashamed. Very negative, nasty, and STUPID reporter that wants Trump to look bad. Cry “polls, polls, polls” little baby. You’re going to cry election night when Trump gets 4 more years.  deserves better.
Sorry but it all ties together. Pizza gate was a right wing Qanon fake conspiracy theory designed to submarine Hillary using gullible people like you. And it’s only gotten crazier from there. No Trump, no hellish 2020.
Because the Governor of the State and MLB have decided to take reasonable precautions in spite of Trump’s blustering idiocy.
as a Yankees fan could you please help amplify the signal of those many Yankees fans that don’t want Donald Trump to throw out the first pitch at Yankees stadium
My favorite team since I first started watching baseball in 1976. They need to disinvite Donald Trump from throwing out the first pitch at Yankee stadium. New Yorkers do not like Trump. He is only willing to come to the stadium because he knows it will be empty.
Donald Trump is a white supremacists. Full stop, If you vote for him again you’re a white supremacists. Full stop.
every time I see a trump bumper sticker it makes me wanna ram right fucking into them but uhh I’m too broke for dat
5) In December the House passed HR3, which had a much better chance of reducing drug prices and bringing the change that Trump is supposedly trying to bring now, but McConnell has said that the bill won’t be considered in the Senate.
4) We shouldn’t applaud the president for finally taking action on a campaign promise 3.5 years into his term in what clearly is an effort to get voter approval by doing the bare minimum. Big Pharma leaders also have until Aug 24th to negotiate with Trump.
What? Trump and his people aren't out there to help other Republicans? They just want the money for themselves? What a shock.
2) Making prescription drugs economically accessible is part of the progressive agenda. How can you only support socialist policies when Trump is the one that is making them?
I feel like this like an example of something conservatives would look at and say “The Left just ignores the good things Trump does!” 1) This doesn’t excuse the last four years of unethical policies and behavior.
It’s KKKobach signs in my patch of the country and not a lot.  I have seen no Trump signs yet in Topeka, which is unusual. Walking the dog the other day, as I was flipping the bird at a neighbor’s Kobach sign, I noticed someone sitting on the front porch.  Oh, well. 🖕
I have a Trump joke but it's offensive.
the face you make when you think you're taking a giant Trump, but it turns out it was just a Kushner.
Fauci took his mask down for a drink of water outside with family. Starnes is desperate for a trump retweet. Starnes is a fraud.

June 1, 2020. Trump has made 19,127 false or misleading claims since taking office, according to a database maintained by our Fact Checker team, including more than 800 related to the novel coronavirus.
I see tRump is trying to reach that rarely talked about demographic of the 2-6 year old. At least he's starting to speak to within his own peer group, wtg donnie. #dumbass #TrumpVirus #voteblue2020 #FredsFailure
I think you’re only seeing as a benefit to those that make less than or at minimum wages. But many of them are back working according to Trump. But the reality is that many high paying jobs were lost and if those families can’t make their bills, it’s more troubling to the gov
I honestly thought u were one of the few GOPers who actually could think rationally...and saw thru trump’s 💩.  Damn, u r just like the rest of the sheep.
Just think if Biden wins the election Covid 19 will end on 11/4/20 If Trump wins it wil go on until the American people rise up and quit being sheep!
Todd bows down - cradles the boys and works the shaft - on trump, for a retweet everyday. Would amp up his idiot demographic to sale his stooge book to.
trump  portland, chicago, nyc, etc.
Trump's solved the problem! Just become successful and...then I can show my displeasure? Then I won't be dissatisfied?  Whatever. Just become successful. Can't believe it's that easy.
Isn't trying to falsely tie Trump to Epstein to cover Clinton, obstruction of justice per The Lincoln Projects own definition of obstruction during the Russia hoax?
Hey Dementia J comrade Trump, a tax cut doesn’t pay the bills. Stimulus checks do. Too bad that was part of your little test you took… No doubt there was no math to do... you don’t even know how to balance a checkbook. King of debt!
Don’t worry Dementia J comrade Trump… The names will get changed after you leave office right around 100 days be packing your bags.
Why does Trump look like this?
Having a huge racially insensitive past, but calling Trump a racist #JoeBidenJob
We moved from “ya but Trump” to “ya but BLM” as an excuse to just be an abhorrent human being.    #PutThatInYourPipe
Trump is LOSING it.
Trump sending Federal enforcement units to cities is a trial run for him. Preparing his options in case he loses in November. The nation needs to be ready for a constitutional crisis! This corrupt abomination needs reigned in NOW!!!!

what do they have in common? none of these losers said a word about Putin's bounties on American soldiers, they support Trump teargassing peaceful protesters for a church photo-op, they support kidnapping of American citizens by #TrumpsGestapo. they hate Americans. they hate you!
Trump's gonna grab cities by the pussy. When you're a dictator they just let you do it.
It’s not trump supporters burning, looting and murdering everyone in the country.
Imagine twitter sgowing its leftist tendencies when it decides not to diacuss how Obama and Biden Colluded in 2016 to stop Trump from getting elected. Great job twitter. Obama and Biden are Scum.
Then open ur eyes to the fascist president u have! Trump. This is how hitler took over. Read!
This is some actual trump logic right here.
I don’t think trump actually took a cognitive test. I think he asked what a cognitive test is and he’s just repeating what he thinks he heard.
two of those people that bullied me are racists. and all of them are trump supporters. look at my last tweet ???
Man you see that laser trump threw?
Trump
patriots like the twins will keep Trump in the White House.
Interesting to see Mike Reynolds next to Ivanka Trump.
I am not a trump fan at all but there has to be a hard line stance taken in Portland. Not bye trump but by local police.
You can not foster this lawlessness, I'm sure your tone would change if the dipshits were destroying your  "summer camp ".   You don't care about lives or property unless it's your own.   Trump is just showing you how a normal society works democratic or not it ends now.
The smartest guy in the room is not Donald trump.
trump supporters love to claim they’re the “silent majority” but do everything they can to ignore the fact that he couldn’t even win the popular vote in 2016
Day 3 This is not a #covidupdate This is Primetime Trump campaign rambling! He's bouncing topics like a Frog on Meth!! WTF?
trump ordered “slow the testing down,” and the COVID testing is slow. Very slow! #TrumpVirus #TrumpKillsUs #VoteBlue2020
Donald Trump‘s new campaign platform is if you can’t dazzle them with brilliance baffle them with bullshit.
Buckle up! The American Gestapo is coming. 😡 They're already in KC...  Trump announces increase in federal law enforcement in more U.S. cities
White House, GOP kill payroll tax cut but flounder over broader coronavirus bill
I'm liking this purely because Trump lost
Trump's New Ad Is Amazing - The Bulwark
He's setting it up for the rioters to shoot first tonight under the cover of "we were told feds were going to shoot us", they are looking to escalate this and try to get people killed and then blame Trump. Soros marching orders.
It will be so one-sided, Trump will over-play it and come across as a bully beating up a grandpa.   He can’t help himself.
America elected Hillary Clinton. The electoral college put Trump in office.
Trump said to Chris Wallace he’d have to consider the circumstances of accepting an election loss and he keeps projecting unsubstantiated and untrue rumors of voter fraud.
Your letter to President Trump and Acting Secretary Wolf is ironic as you being a Democrat don't believe in States' Rights. You and your party only use the Constitution and the Bill of Rights when it works as a tool to further your Socialist Communist agenda.
Lincoln Project hits Trump’s biggest ‘failure’ in new ad
Pats Trump impersonation sounds like a Dr evil Michael Jackson mash up.   #PutThatInYourPipe
So Trump is Humperdink...Pompeo is Count Rugen...Barr is Yeltsin? And now they’ve recruited themselves a brute squad. Great. Who will be our Inigo, Fezzik and Westley???? #LifeImitatingArt
Garden City, KS sure had their Trump flags waving last weekend!
Trump's Gestapo, or Trump's American Taliban, or Trump's al-Qaeda? all are government supported terrorist groups.
You aiding and abetting a criminal by supporting trump!  You will be voted out in November!!
it's not just defeating Trump, but a complete beating. the outcome in November needs to be both an electoral and popular vote burial of Trump and his cronies. Trump must have no alternative than tucking tail &amp; crawling away, whimpering into a corner.
You tell ‘em, Mayor Lightfoot! Trump can just keep his jack-booted, anonymous thugs out of the city of my birth! Also, could you please get me your brother Gordon’s autograph?
why? it's under control. gee wiz... totally under control. lots of control. bigly under control. you can't see how under control it is because it's so under control. greatest under control the world, the universe, has ever witnessed. don't doubt Trump.
someone please explain to that dummy that he's just not that smart. love how the interviewer is just nodding in agreement. this is the interview that Trump really wanted. Chris Wallace needs to grill the interviewer in live TV.
he's a Trump/Epstein fan-fic writer. he's pissed because he can't be within 200 feet of a playground.
Did you just equate Trump to Jesus?
Trump is ignorant
You have a right to criticize Chuck..Trump shouldn’t get a star by his name because he talks about masks. Trump doesn’t care that people are dying...
This is because of Trump’s recent executive order which eliminated some of the mandates on COVID-19 tracking be sent to the CDC. I’d recommend going to  which is the most up to date source, here is its updated number.
Lol I legit said the same thing. How did those win an election? It’s unbelievable. In July alone six children have been murdered in Chicago, but she wants to fight with Trump than address Chi-raq
It’s absolutely pathetic. Seattle is getting rid of its jails and courts. You have a legit war zone in Chicago and the mayor is more concerned with fighting with Trump and dressing up as a cowboy. And then you have the idiot mayor of NYC threatening to take the president to court
He has nothing! He had nothing when he was surprised to win in 2016. No preparation to form a government - still hasn’t gotten that one figured out. He had no idea in response to Wallace’s question about that. That’s going to be history’s epitaph for Trump’s reign - Nothing !
Despicable Trump and Barr..#GestapoTrump
Totally..I think I need an adjustment..because I shake my head everytime Trump babbles..
you are absolutely pathetic!!! The citizens that you are supposed to serve are getting gunned down on a daily basis and you would rather fight with Trump. 6 small children have died in July alone!! DO YOUR JOB!!!
To save America, Trump needs to let the Blue States, Counties and Cities implode.
This is tRump’s United States right NOW. Stop projecting!!!
You only mentioned your hate for Trump. Are you not one of the very enthusiastic Biden supporters?
Make Trump answer for his comment on Maxwell !
Trump sending Feds into cities is a political move that disregards the 1st &amp; 10th amendments. It's a police action that's illegal, and that gives Trump a woody! VOTE HIM OUT!
Through no help with yours… You take the lazy way out… Is now known as the Trump virus
What would be a duh… You have Park Rangers Demented Jim Jones comrade Trump!
The Trump comedy hour is on CBS and is streaming it
Time for the tRump shit show once again
So we're gonna fixate on Joe Biden's poor choice of words about what constitutes a racist president then? The Trump campaign thanks you for writing their next donor email for them.
What a JOKE of a human.. let alone the President of the US... you're a POS tRump #FredsFailure #TrumpIsARacist #TrumpVirus #VoteBlue2020
Contact your local school district if you have questions or concerns about opening/not opening for school in the fall.  Contact your Congresspeople to voice questions or concerns about whatever the hell is going on in the Trump administration.  Stay safe out there.
Given Trumps' history with women, it's not such a stretch to believe Trump was in deep with Epstein and Maxwell. One thing is certain, Trump needs to be questioned emphatically about his involvement with both!
Perhaps Maxwell could implicate Trump. Probably could and will if Trump doesn't play ball.
Did Trump send Maxwell a message? Probably!
Trump wishes Ghislaine Maxwell well? An alleged co-conspirator to child sexual abuse? REALLY? What the hell is that all about? A message ala Roger Stone?
When Trump wins the election in 2020. The left is going to absolutely lose their fucking minds.
Hydroxychlooquine is a preventative not a cure. All evidence says that if you take it at the beginning then that will help but if you take when you have advanced stages of it then it will not. Trump is right but acting like it is a cure is wrong.
Oh wait, trump needs a dementia unit!
He needs to check himself in, maybe trump will go with him.
Did trump finally join the real world and recommend wearing masks when needed wow he must’ve taken a brain pill last night
Here’s a little nugget for ya: Trump makes Trump look bad. Biden could possibly win the election by staying in his basement and allow trump to self destroy. Just sayin.
Time for Kayleigh to resign. She said she'd never lie. She said Trump gets tested everyday, sometimes multiple times per day.  Trump said he gets tested about everyday, maybe every other day, but not multiple times a day. Of course he lies a lot too.
It would seem the Guardian is blaming Trump for what is taking place in democrat ran cities. Trump has been in office for just about 3 years. Some of these cities have been ran by democrats for over 40 years.
hmm... maybe the best way would have been to tell your Dear Leader to do something back in January.  how about convening a hearing on Putin's bounties that Dear Leader knew about but did nothing. or, maybe Trump's use of shadow troops to kidnap Americans. or....
Jan 2017: GOP Majority in House GOP Majority in Senate GOP in WH Conservative majority on SCOTUS  Look where it’s gotten us.  Kinda hope Trump wins in ‘20, then we get to hear him blame the “previous admin” for how bad of shape the country is in.  #GOPClowns
I firmly believe that there are 3 types of people complaining about this. 1. Racist trash 2.die hard Trump supporters (not all conservatives are in this category) 3. Trolls
This is what you get if you don’t like trump.
