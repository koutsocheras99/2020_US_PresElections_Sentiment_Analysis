Trump is to blame for Herman Cain’s death because he insisted on having his stupid Tulsa rally, and gave people a hard time about wearing a life-saving mask.   Trump’s ignorance and narcissism kills.
Life in Trump and Jared Kushner’s America!
Trump knows he is in trouble which is why he is doubling down on his fake claims of massive fraud through mail in voting. He is also suing Oregon for their program, and his forcing his newly appointed Post Office General to slow down and  dismantle operations. Trump is a monster.

Trump's plague
As a member of one of the initial blue states, it was a blessing in disguise that Trump just shrugged his shoulders. Our governor took better care of us than Trump ever could.
Trump’s “delay the election” tweet was just another distract from more important matters, in this case, John Lewis’s funeral and the #COVIDcatastrophe. It is meaningless noise, like so much of what   tweets. #DontBeDistracted.
I’m wondering if you’re regretting that so-called rally where Trump killed old Herm....
I hear President Trump taking live about Coronavirus and all I can think: "Gee, I can't wait for the Sarah Cooper video."
also i’m genuinely wondering why trump is against mail in ballots but not absentee. from everything i can find, they both go through the mail. just because you need a reason for the absentee ballot... how does that make it less likely to be fake??
Co-sign that. The claim that Trump will, with Barr and SCOTUS’s help, either cancel or subvert the election through strategic chaos is NOT hyperbole. The details of their intentions are being said out loud. Our democracy is on the line

This is so obviously an effort to distract from the news of Obama eulogizing John Lewis, the awful jobs report, Trump’s lack of care / plan for Covid...did I miss anything else?
Indeed. Whether he actually manages to delay the election or not, this plays into his plan to dismantle the USPS and to contest a loss if it happens. It will also leave any successor with a huge problem of legitimacy among Trump voters.
Trump's ego killed Herman Cain.
Trump's ego did this. Herman attended the Tulsa rally and has been sick ever since.

The good news: The President can't delay the election, only an act of Congress can do that.  The bad news: Trump would do more than just delay the election if given the power to do so, no doubt in my mind he'd declare himself supreme leader for life if he could.

I have to wonder why trump would be ramping up production on this malaria drug. Do you suppose maybe he - in addition to claiming it is a cure for covid-19 (which it isn't) he also has secret plans to invade some country with high amounts of malaria? Like maybe Guyana?
The way that Kevin Stitt or Brian Kemp has been derelict in their duties to please Trump during a pandemic is disgusting.  The way that Marsha Blackburn attacked Alexander Vindman was disgusting regardless of how bad Democrats are.
Even after Trump is gone, there are so many GOP officials that I could not possibly support that I probably won’t be calling myself a Republican. I will certainly support many Republicans in certain elections, but the Republican Party has drifted far away from the Reaganism
I have to ask this: was Trump saying nice things about you worth the stain on your conscience?
From Lindsey Graham to Louie Gohmert to Kevin McCarthy to Marsha Blackburn to many more that I won’t name, I cannot imagine voting for or supporting these officials after seeing how they behaved in the Trump presidency.
The way many GOP officials have behaved themselves since 2015 has been frankly disgusting. The total capitulation to Trump and the total lack of spine or integrity has been really disappointing. The GOP is a horrendous vehicle to further Buckleyite conservatism.
Was listening to Kevin Williamson and  podcast and Williamson made a point about GOP politics after Trump that I want to expand on.   If (when) Trump loses, the GOP won’t go back to its 2012 state and I won’t be hopping right back on the GOP bandwagon.

Bill Barr wasn’t aware of Trump’s tweets, things going on in his own department, status of reports, firings, etc. He even said that Obama was responsible for the coronavirus even though he hadn’t been president for 3 1/2 years! Bill Barr is nothing but a corrupt partisan.
Bill Barr couldn’t answer a straight forward question if you paid him. All he knows how to do is obfuscate. He has to be the most evil man in America because unlike Trump, he is no dummy.
I've given up on government as a solution.  I tried to build private solutions.  it would be great if Trump would stop helping them make things worse.
🇺🇸 TRUMPGATE USA 🇺🇸    VOTE JOE BIDEN HE IS NOT FAKE. How is the virus the economy and jobless rate shit sleepy Donald Trump. The first president to work against the people not for the American people.
Trump makes our economic problems much worse, and you ignore them.
my exact thought when I watched him answer. of course he knows, just doesn’t want to go on record that trump can’t in case that POS tries.
I hope this hearing cements the Republicans taking back the House,keeping the Senate and re-electing President Trump on Nov. 3rd. Dems are liars. We must vote Red IN PERSON! Save a vacation or personal day and take Nov. 3rd off if that is the only way you can vote IN PERSON.
National Guard officer says Trump and AG Barr are lying about his botched Bible photo op
They are afraid of going to prison!  When Trump gets re-elected. The gloves are coming off!   Trump will be going after them!
I can't to wait vote for President Trump and every other Republican on the ballot in November after watching all these POS DemocRats at the Barr hearing today. The DemocRats are a disgusting bunch of criminals who hate our republic!
Ultimately it comes down to the character of the people with power, and what they value.  Trump finds people who value money most, and gives them power.
🇺🇸 TRUMPGATE USA 🇺🇸  Everyone he is cutting Medicare and social security. Trump don't trust him. He is going to screw with health care VOTE JOE BIDEN HE DOESN'T LIE ABOUT EVERYTHING.
no, he's there to answer questions posed by congress, not to "tell his [trump's] story"!
The Fed did it. Encouraged by Trump.  Because both of them are obsessed with money.
Meanwhile, Trump has given them an additional $5 trillion, and as our new mortgage crisis hits after Covid, they're going to use it to buy up more real estate.
And Wall funds are likely redirected to the Trump covert army of federal cops, largely CBP/DHS officers and contractors.
True.  Trump does it on a different scale though.
Trump takes those bankers and puts them in his administration to let them write tax code, and control commerce.

Fascists come out of the woodwork; as soon as one "sees the light" and breaks with Trump, several more careerists pop up to take their place. An army of people who can't wait to sell their country out.

This is the United States of America states govern themselves if trump forces everyone to do one thing he would be a fascist the fact that 4 states run by democrats make up 45% of the deaths because they put covid paitents in nursing homes and that is trumps fault is asinine
Trump loves to talk about how high he makes the stock market, as if that was the economy.
I think we should cut way back on international trade.  That's a decision the people should make, not the military.  Trump doesn't want to stop international trade. He wants to renegotiate the term so that we make more money on it.  "We" means Wall Street, practically speaking.
Bullshit.  Trump abandoned our ally to die in Syria.  And then committed a war crime by going after the oil.
Isis grew out of George Bush destroying Iraq on a lie, and Obama certainly didn't make it better.  Now Trump tries to extort Iraq by demanding payment for our base before we will leave, even though they want us gone.
Those are the types of people who can afford to buy Trump's overpriced real estate.  That, and organized crime.
Never. Trump's cowardice is matched only by his hatred of America.
I agree we have been using and not giving back to the middle class for a long time now trump made more jobs but ddnt do much besides have more people working. Some big changes need to come soon

Trump saved 2 million people don’t for get.
The American educational system is so bad - it allowed millions to be manipulated by a grifter. The folks who support Trump are white men who are not college educated and are easily manipulated. These men relate to Trump and his racism, and like him, want to return to 1955.
yes trump virus. But if democrat goveners ddnt put covid paitents in nursing homes we would be at flu like death numbers 🤔
Trump is deliberately slowing down the mail by way of his new post master general sychophant he put in place. Trump continues  to mess with our election. Congress must step in.

Trump's attacks on the election must - MUST - always be framed first and foremost as tactical moves in Operation November the Fourth. He doesn't want to move the election or to ban mail-in voting. He wants those things to happen so he can wake the next day and reject the results.
Thank you,  Have you read Gary Hart's recent op-ed about presidential emergency powers? Please read &amp; share with your colleagues and begin an investigation asap regarding the scope of these powers and how they might impact the election.
Trump wants to delay the November election until  - to use  his word -   it's "safe" . Presumably he means "safe" for him. For the rest of the country the word to be applied is "disastrous". Witness the pandemic. He must not be allowed to get away with this insanity!
If even ONE Senator or Representative, Republican or Democrat says, We'll look into this, you WILL resign. There is NO looking into it..its a law! Trump cannot change a law. Stop enabling this fascist pig.

And there it is...This is why Trump has done little to stop the spread of COVID-19 and has even taken steps to worsen the pandemic. He will use this pandemic to pressure governors &amp; Congress to delay the election, at which point our descent into fascism will be complete.
Thank you for standing up to Trump, but we need to do a lot more to protect our elections from foreign interference and to fight voter suppression tactics.
Donald Trump should resign. Pass it on.

Trump will be fine with it, he loves "acting" appointments!
We both know why Gerry. Trump won 4 years ago. They failed to have him impeached, so they waited for his last year of term 1 to cause anarchy before the election. They care more about getting him out, than they do about the health of the country.
they (Republicans) just decided to use Trump the same way he uses others. honestly they sold their soul long before Trump.

Is every member of  trying to lose?  Most of us in this country support BLM,  and are dead set against losing our health insurance because of the Republican party's attempts to repeal the ACA.  Trump supporters need to open their eyes!
I believe that trump is the only person Putin has something really big on.  I bet trump's financial records would reveal a lot in that area.
You mean the idiots in his district. Who also support Trump.
There will be millions like her dancing in the streets when  loses.  All cities should start organizing their "Good Riddance Trump" celebrations now.  That will be the biggest party ever!  I'm going to buy the best party clothes I can find.😊
And you have to use that data, because Trump won't let the CDC have or distribute that information anymore.
"In America if you are white, you should not have to set eyes on a brown person who isn't working for you," Trump continued. "I said it like I just think poor people are disgusting, but you all know what I meant."
"I know it sounds like I'm talking exclusively to white people," Trump continued, "But that's only because I want white people who are afraid of browns to vote for me. Because whites are scared of browns, and that's good for me."
"You will never again see a poor or be bothered by knowing they exist," Trump continued. "you will never need to wonder about where Low incomes live or how they survive outside your Suburban Lifestyle Dream. We won't allow them to trouble you.They will disappear like a miracle."

I'm not as concerned about a delay as much as I am concerned about Trump claiming it was fraudulent.  MAIL IN VOTING (IE ABSENTEE BALLOTING) IS *NOT* VOTER FRAUD!! GOT THAT,
Thank you!  Absentee Ballot = Mail-In voting.  They are synonyms. Someone tell Trump.
I'm sure this is not a pleasing thing to hear, much less a pleasing thing to say, but... IMO, it means the powerful and the elites have more in common with each other than they have differences. In a few years, Trump will be among them.
trump is not a no child left behind guy, he's entering the school year knowing there will be causalities
the thing trump does after a night out? 🥽⛷️
Can you imagine if Trump was President during WWII? How many different ways would he have screwed up? No doubt he would’ve been jealous of famous generals like Eisenhower and MacArthur. He would’ve pushed them out and replaced them with incompetent toadies.
“Trump also feared that more testing would only lead to higher case counts and more bad publicity”
There are really 50 separate elections and I am assuming that (1) Congress will not vote to change the day, (2) if Trump pushes delay any way, only red states will agree, so (3) blue states like CA will elect representatives and senators on November 3rd either way.
It’s probably because Trump sucks!
Republicans openly challenge Trump's tweet on delaying election. Great! It’s about time.They realize Trump will likely lose, so now they are less afraid of him &amp; out to protect themselves from disaster. But they should lose after more than 150,000 are dead

Is there anything that you don't blame on Trump?? Just curious....
Ha ha ha!!!  Ha ha!!! I love watching Trump squirm while he looks for ways to cheat so he can win. He made his own noose.  First term FAIL! BIDEN 2020!

I don't agree with that. But I also believe that mail in voting opens the door to to many fraud issues! For instance,if someone votes Trump,before it's counted some could easily mark it for Biden making that voting ballet void!Nevermind being lost in the mail!
Everything is political for progressives. John Lewis' funeral is mostly an occasion to attack Republicans. Herman Cain's death an occasion for snarky "serves him rights" and a denunciation of Trump's Covid-19 policies.
I agree with the diagnosis. I also think it’s vital that the Greens campaign hard for Presidential votes in non-swing states, but not further endanger the world with Trump. As a green supporter, I believe it’s vital for all Greens in swing states to hold their noses and vote Dem.
We can’t send our kids to school, we can’t go back to work... you think you’ve done enough TELL THAT TO THE 150,000 DEAD AND THE FOUR PLUS MILLION THAT ARE INFECTED! Your all hypocrites, take out the bullshit in the bill Trump wants!You all took a oath..DO YOUR G.D. JOBS!
Once again, Trump has managed to distract the public and media from the most important story of the day: the GDP numbers and his failing response to COVID.
Another valid reason to vote for Trump!
Every time Trump proposes to do something massively illegal, he’s really asking “Who’s going to stop me?”  I wish I knew.
*Trump is putting USPS over a barrel lately and the current postmaster general is a Trump lackey. Expect issues with mail-in voting.

If you never agreed with a single thing a person said and those things were vile, you can call him a piece of shit. Trump supporters would be dancing on Pelosi's grave, and at least that shows some clarity of purpose
Consistency: Folks freaking out about Obama because they "knew" he secretly believed things/had plans he didn't say in public then not freaking out about Trump because they "know" he doesn't believe/can't do what he says in public. 🤔
So. Herman Cain. Went to Tulsa rally. Herman Cain contracted COVID. Herman Cain is now dead. How has Trump not caught this thing? 🤷🏻‍♀️🤷🏻‍♀️🤷🏻‍♀️
With Trump now floating an election delay, let me re-up this tweet. I’ve just finished a DRG assessment of Congo, where the president also uses delayed elections to extend his mandate. I am not joking when I say the US is creeping toward authoritarianism.
Trump’s rally killed Cain.  When will people awaken
Talk to Herman Cain. Oh wait you can’t because he died from attending a Trump rally.
To me, it appears as Trump’s desperate, depraved attempt to discredit and/or prevent an election, and subsequent persecution for unlawful acts, where all indicators point to resounding defeat. Nevertheless, we must prepare.
What about  calling Trump xenophobic &amp; a 'fear mongerer' over  closing of travel from China &amp; Europe? The Democraps hypocrisy, sanctimony &amp; lack of decency &amp; fair play is beyond appalling!

Trump floats idea of delaying the November election, a power granted to Congress, as he ramps up attacks on voting…
President Trump, lagging in the polls, floats idea of delaying election
No, folks, Trump can’t delay the election, hence the “???” at the end of his tweet. What he CAN do is undermine faith in the results. Also, gosh, why might he be saying scary stuff right now?
FOCUS. ON. THIS. The election day delay stuff is Trump deflecting and trying to take attention away from this - Don't let him do it!!!
Gosh I wonder why Trump is distracting us with scary tweets!!!!
Also call on Charlie Baker to stop fundraising with Mike Pence. Also  and  how could you both not commit to voting for the Democratic nominee if Baker runs again? He is complicit in this embarrassment as is everyone raising money for Trump’s “reelection.”
This what happens when GDP falls by 33%. What was Susan Collins saying about how Trump learned his lesson? Impeach him again, but more importantly vote out every Republican enabling the further destruction of our already limited democracy.

Because McConnell knows trump can't do it and doesn't want to contradict or lie.
DISTRACTION Trump is the master of it!
Trump Boasts Of Pushing Low-Income Housing Out Of Suburbs | Morning Joe ...  via    I suppose that Old Man #Trump knows just how much #racial hate He stirred up in that blood-pot of human hearts  When he draw-ed that color line. ~words Woody Guthrie
Very sad to hear this news.  This one is on Trump. Removed social distancing stickers from all seating in the arena, did not enforce wearing masks. Herman, why weren't you wearing a mask? Guess the dead cannot answer that question. This is a tragedy, my deepest condolences.
a family member just told me that the LGBTQ+ community ENDORSES TRUMP and he couldnt be further away from the truth and it baffles me that people believe that shit
And your boy Trump wants to postpone the election!  His corruption has no borders.
Trump Suggests Delaying Presidential Election Due To Mail-In Voting
Trump is a pitBULL.....and my apologies to that loving breed with a tough reputation......
Mary L. Trump book explains the Trumps (from Queens) never felt accepted by the Manhattan elite....he was an outsider....you have to be a New Yorker to get this....malignant narcissist speaking again here....a RACIST malignant narcissist.....
So thats what Trump does in his spear time
I am not surprised at all and no one else should be this is America that's why we got Trump it was always about rascism and if you cant see it you are living in fantasy land.
Thinking out loud: the responses to this tweet make me wonder if one casualty of the Trump era could be the "Five Non-Negotiables" paradigm for some Catholic voters. A lot has happened since 2016. It'll be interesting to see how it all shakes out. #CatholicTwitter #Election2020
Now we know trump is a clone of George Wallace. He is a segregationist. His tweet today that “people living their Suburban dream” no longer have to worry about low income housing in their neighborhood proves it. Good Lord.
Trump plans to make room for “those people” in Trump Tower....apply now for 1/3 priced apartments!!!!
Oh. My. God.  And Trump asked Black America “what do you have to lose?”. The closest dictator I can think of, comparable to Donald,is Gaddafi........
trumpsters love their fellow americans! but only if theyre white, men, and upper middle class+ (and only if they also worship trump) #dumptrump #BunkerBoy
What I really don’t her about trump is he goes on live tv &amp; calls low income cities rat infested shit holes &amp; then blocks measures taken to help people get out of those cities... he’s shown time &amp; time again that he’s more concerned with putting people down rather than helping
Trump on racism I am the least Racist person you have ever met.

Props to  of    for setting the record straight (to a Dem from Georgia who supports Trump) on the #economy that was built by the Obama admin. And Trump has been taking credit for. 1st time I've heard a journalist mention it.

Trump's approval rating sinks to 17-month low as election looms closer  #TrumpFailedAmerica #VoteTrumpOut
Nope many of the same player's that were around for the Bush versus Gore debacle are right around Trump in his ear and on the Supreme Court.
Stupid tweet. Of course trump approved it.
FYI people who so desperately defend trump and their precious constitution....This shit right here is ILLEGAL 🚫  5 C.F.R.  2635.702 (Subpart G) Misuse of position; use of public office for private gain ....for his personal benefit or the benefit of others.
Me to ex-Republican hubby:  “Trump hasn’t said one word about Rep. John Lewis....is it because he was black or because he was a Democrat?” Hubby: with no hesitation.....”both.” A remarkably unfit president who wants to be loved....incapable of love himself....sad.
Please, God.....do what you have to do to rid us of Trump.  He is not Republican....he is Satan.
Translation of Trump’s railing against Democrat mayor cities: “If you want federal help, you better get rid of your Democrats running cities:  vote Republican, and vote for me. And then I will give you money.”
Trump has been president for almost four years yet still wants to blame Obama - just another excuse for his LACK OF LEADERSHIP.   Barr is putting his political career in the hands of a criminal and I hope he’s locked up right next to the president he so truly loves and defends.
Stephen Miller is just one more sleaze ball in the trump circus.   Unbelievable that he’s so clearly supporting his racist, white supremacy-VOTE IN NOVEMBER AND GET THEM ALL OUT
They did it with Bush versus Gore and it will keep doing it as long as they can get away with it we have had two illegitimate presidents Bush and Trump.
EXCLUSIVE: How Brett Kavanaugh tried to sidestep abortion and Trump financial docs cases
I mean, I’m thinking “Reichstag fire” impending doom.  Trump is going to destroy something major.....and put the blame elsewhere . He is desperate.....and not beyond attempting some horror.....
Oh, and don’t forget Trump has already stated he doesn’t take responsibility for ANYTHING!!!!!!
Wow.....wait ‘til Trump is gone.  We can blame EVERTHING on him, too!  Easy peasy!!!!
I have a feeling of impending doom ..... we are leaderless in a world with Covid, Putin.......and Trump.  I have never had this feeling before.  Not a good feeling.
Americans we can't let that happen, vote Trump 2020 🇺🇸🙏😇
I'm sure you do. Which obviously means you dont want our government to be able to regulate prices like every other country. Unless of course Trump says it. Then you're all in UNTIL of course he says he's reconsidered and that's socialism UNLESS of course he reconsiders again...
I keep wondering why Barr wanted this job something tells me the connection between Epstein Trump and his father is the clue.
I just read a tweet that said Trump didn't want to run for President but he owed Putin too many favors. You know I listen to Trump supporters and at times it seems clear they're the dumb ones, but then I'll see shit like this and think there's WAY to much stupidity to handle.
He won’t just like trump won’t and hasn’t we all have to vote.
AmericanCatastrophe... brought to you by BLM and friends for Biden 2020. Remember ABC, just because your network is and has been #3 among top 3 major networks, does not mean you have to resort to their same tactics. It is so obvious the goal of the show was to bury Trump
Can’t wait to vote for Trump
Congratulations, . .  You have still failed to take leadaership in the Coronavirus epidemic....oh, excuse me, it is at this point the TRUMP pandemic!  You will be responsible for hundreds of thousands of American deaths.  How’s THAT for winning re-election in Nov.
Good time to do it. Trump won’t raise a finger.
President Trump please meet with Dr. Stella Immanuel she has information about hydroxychloroquine concerning COVID-19 and replace Dr. Anthony Fauci.
President Trump please meet with Dr. Stella Immanuel she has information about hydroxychloroquine concerning COVID-19 and replace Dr. Anthony Fauci.
He has issues like Trump both of their fathers were weird with a lot of baggage.
It would be funny because during the primaries Biden campaigned on the idea that he was the only one who could beat trump
Trump breeds them. He shouldn't be surprised.
150,000 deaths from Coronavirus and there is still NO national strategy.  We are on our own. Trump does nothing to plan a strategy. We are on our own.   Time to elect a president who will initiate a national strategy on COVID!  That person would be..... #JoeBidenForPresident2020

Listening to VP Joe Biden.....a rational, smart, caring human being....with the experience necessary to get the job done.....gives me hope that there will be real leadership in handling Covid and BLM and future crises. After listening to AG Barr, a Trump lackey...good grief.....
Trump has signed 151 in 4 years. He’s on track to surpass Obama if he wins a second term

I like how he answered i dont know when Trump tweets but then says he tweeted about Stone at 1.30 am when asked about it.

I wish someone would ask him about why he wanted the job i still think it's his father's connection to Epstein and Trump.
Too bad Trump himself can't get put into Twitter jail.
There is nothing on Trump's public schedule today, per Politico. Which only means one thing......

I suppose calling Donald Trump the offspring of an orange orangutan is hurtful and now deemed illegal because he says so. NOT !
Careful. It isn’t over until the fat trump cries.
TRUMP is freaking nuts,  plain and simple.
It’s gonna be so funny when Trump gets him arrested before Hillary Clinton
Funny. Now several retired IS Military Generals that filtered through the Trump adminstration all call Trump the idiot.
Depends what you consider anti fascist. I know of at least two Trump supporters who have been killed for their ignorant opinions. I am antifascist, but I am also opposed to anyone hurting or killing innocent people over political beliefs.
Trump is taking the knee to Putin... #TrumpKnewAboutRussianBounty #TrumpKillsUSTroops #TrumpFailedAmerica #TraitorInChief #TrumpThreatensAmerica #TrumpSoldUsOut
Do we think Trump is a pathological liar? Or has he been living in Trump Land for so long he actually believes everything he says? Who lies about throwing out the first pitch at Yankee Stadium? For a guy so self-conscious, he doesn't seem to worry much about being humiliated...
There’s nothing right about Trump
What the hell, burn it down, steal it, sell it to foreign adversaries....then get pardoned by Trump.
Btw, were the viewers told that Coach Holtz is on the advisory board of Catholics for Trump?

Totally misleading headline. "Won't" isn't "hasn't yet."  "When I focus on turnout, we will deliver Michigan to Joe Biden. Trump only won Michigan by 10,000 votes. When I turn out my folks and my district, we'll be able to take back the state." - Tlaib

You know saying the word minstrel isn't inherently racist. You also know no one in this thread even mentioned Biden until you, she hes living rent free in your brain which is wild.    If you want im sure in 30 seconds on Google I can find pictures of Trump with KKK members too
Trump national security adviser O'Brien has the coronavirus
Because the news is running with the narrative that trump is sending in feds like Hitler sent in the gestapo. And showing people throw fireworks, frozen water bottles, and point lasers at said Feds doesn’t fit their narrative.
She wants to just keep ruining the economy she only gives a s*** about getting Trump out of office.
Why anyone would act suprised that Donald Trump won't be paying his respects to congressman John Lewis is laughable. Trump is a fucking racial arsonist who's just full of hate . Full stop!
Trump says he won’t go and pay respects to John Lewis at Capitol
It would be the ultimate Trump card  See what I did there...
Yes, I remember calling Trump a racist  loooooooong before this.
So Trump cares about Covid only when it starts to affect RED states?  There is no RED state without blue people in it, and no BLUE state without red people in it.  What kind of world does Trump think he lives in?
Trump will never be 1/10 the man that John Lewis was.  Difference is John Lewis lived with love in his heart.  Trump is incapable of love.
Trump’s latest crackdown is a political stunt — Democrats should impeach him again
This time is far, far, worse......the system, our government, worked to assess, plan, and work together to solve  the problem.   Now is ......  chaos.....total chaos and no management of the real problem, Trump, at all. (And HE in turn is not managing the COVID problem!)
But Harris hasn't from what I've seen done anything to make herself an anathema to moderate voters who dislike Trump but can also be made afraid of radical left personalities and positions...4/
We are not safe right now I’ll take Biden or anybody over the crazy Trump and his crazy enabler’s.
The attack against Biden by Trump is that he is mentally declining is BS but likely Trump voters I've spoken with believe it, and probably some of his suburbs supporters too. So no matter who the VP nom is they will be forced to combat that narrative...2/
Also where does it say in any of our comments "all black people hate Trump"
Trump has alot of Pedophile friends wonder why they all belong in jail.
Im afraid of Trump’s neck
a trump supporter trying to be nice to me? 🤮
I feel like diamond and silk are a minstrel show for white trump supporters to think they understand black people but they are playing into every stereotype they can.   I feel like they sold their souls for some views.
This is what you achieved with Trump. You are just as guilty.
It’s all true but in the meantime until we get Joe Biden how many more people will die how sad and avoidable if we didn’t have Trump.

It's sad the options are Orange Twitter Troll, Racist Hair Sniffer, or Beyonces Video Was Better.  Could have ran a flaming bag of shit and beat Trump, instead they went with Biden 😆

If Putin needs any help, Trump has a bunch of nondescript federal troops he can loan him.....would be nice to the them out of Portland!!
Sadly part of me has to question if this was all recorded to be anti trump propaganda. Hey look trump shirt and swastika. Neener Neener  Still cant believe the choices are really the Twitter Troll, Is that L'oreal?, or Beyonces video was better?

I miss him so much. I miss his integrity, his sense of humor, his dignity, his sense of responsibility, his willingness, even in the teeth of obdurate resistance, to search for common ground, and his respect for the Office he held. With Trump? None of that.
no, actually not true. i’m a bernie girl. but i’d just rather prevent trump. that is all it is. no emotions. just not trump. i believe we the people are at war with trump and that we only have one shot. and it’s too late for new tactics. for me it’s simple as that. prevent 2016

I might be misinterpreting it, but I don’t think the fictional patient has COVID; he’s just been in a coma for 3 1/2 years due to a car accident, has woken up, and has no idea what Trump has done. The family is wearing masks to protect him from COVID.
We’re just asking you to stay on course and not let manipulator Trump divert you with his daily (hourly?) shiny object distractions.
You need to click on the tweet and look what he is retweeting. A major Trump supporter switching up
It really is unbelievable how the media portrays this. They want trump out so bad they are willing to lie and have no journalistic integrity what so ever. it really is pathetic.
Steve can blow it out his ear.  I could not care less that suddenly one more ridiculous distraction comment has got his attention.  Trump was a trainwreck, lying, misogynistic, xenophobic, racist con man danger to America from day one.

This is absolutely harrowing. It is just so hard to read. And my brain is on fire knowing that Trump was wishing these people well.
Only an idiot would ever let a narcissistic psychopath ever occupy the highest office in the land without some basic safeguards. Only good thing Trump has done is show how badly we need to properly vet our candidates for POTUS. Can't wait for him behind bars in NY!
Trump supporters love to say “politics don’t define character” or “respect other people’s beliefs” as if supporting a racist, misogynist, and rapist isn’t wrong?? or a violation of basic human rights &amp; decency?? So yes it does define ur character AND your view on women &amp; POC smh
Trump was aptly called "the chaos candidate" but I think he's graduated to "the scorched earth president". Leaves nothing but destruction in his wake....Putin's got his money's worth.

We can do it now.  See
Not suggesting that if anyone chose not to go public with their stories that they are not telling the truth if they did now, of course (I hope that’s clear). I just would have expected SOMEONE to have brought Trump’s name up with specific accusations by now.
3. Using a foreign government to influence his elections. The dude has commended Putin and Kim Jong for God’s sakes.  4. Using his platform to ridicule the media while they are only exercising their first amendment rights. 5. Trump was literally IMPEACHED for abuse of power.
Trump Might Try to Postpone the Election. That’s Unconstitutional.
I sorta believe this in my gut as well. It doesn’t make sense to me why ANY other victims of Epstein wouldn’t have come forward accusing Trump when many of the others accusing Trump did, or when people started going more public with Epstein accusations.

The thing about Trump is that he is extremely evil but also extremely fucking stupid.
Especially critical when it comes to flipping the senate! Even if everything went to hell and Trump got re-elected, a Democratic majority senate would make a world of difference.
For a second there I thought you might address R voter suppression, or McConnell’s refusal to deal with Russian interference, but those are probably “partisan issues” to you.  In the old days we were all Americans.  It took trump to decide those who disagree “hate America”.

I used to think just mentioning the name Rush Limbaugh would put liberals into orbit. But for the past 4 years the Trump name sends these left-holes seeking Uranis. The Trump derangement syndrome should be listed in the DSM.
Why is trump pushing a legal drug? I don’t see him pushing asprin, Tylenol. They are prescribed for covid19 to reduce pain, right? Why is trump not pushing disinfectants for treating covid19? I am not saying you lack logic skills but anyone would as you equate equador to USA

Leave it to this windbag to politicize Herman Cain's death by invoking a Trump rally to allege, without verification, that Cain contracted coronavirus from his presence there. The amorality of some political consultants knows no bounds.
Why because it’s something Trump is doing? I’m assuming it’s a bad thing for the USA to make its own meds here

We will vote for President Trump again!!  He's a brilliant president who's putting the USA first and foremost.  So many have become disenfranchised with the Democratic Party.  They have become a communist party, set out to destroy our happiness.

Every one wants schools to reopen - when it’s safe to do so. Biden can be trusted to do that. Trump emphatically cannot.
Yes—Trump, destroy America—Biden, Revive the rule of law.
Trump could make cadets go back to West Point so he could give the commencement address uninvited. He could weasel his way to first pitching at Yankee Stadium uninvited.  But he couldn’t go to John Lewis’s Funeral uninvited.
I’m pretty sure liberals would be less offended if NeverBiden lefties voted for Trump, which mathematically *would* be a vote for Trump, because they’re fixated on binary thinking and find a non-big party vote cognitively dissonant.

I'll have to agree on that. Nobody could've done damage to our country like Trump has done.

Ben this is an atypical election year. This is not the normal left/right divide. Trump is a clear and present danger to the fabric of the Republic. He derides our allies, warms up to despots, has an antiquated sense of economics, casts doubt on our institutions.1/
Well said. Up until the Orange Cheeto, I always respected the man occupying the Oval office. I wasn't huge fans of both Bushes, Romney, John McCain to name a few prominent Repubs, but I knew deep down they were all good guys who cared deeply about the US. Trump ruined the GOP!

What’s on? The Election?  If Biden makes a splash with his already-later-than-Hillary-did-it-in-2016 VP announcement, Trump will have to keep up amid the hype.
Change is incremental. And right now the biggest most pressing change needed is getting trump out
* Trump isn’t spineless, he’s an evil narcisist. * “Limp-dicked” is as ableist as it is gratuitous for criticizing a genuine monster * The idea that America smelled like a rose before Trump’s election is beyond ahistorical * Biden would likely pardon Trump in seconds

Trump jumping into this DESTROYED the conversation.
Trump lies about everything except who he is. He's never pretended to be decent; and he's been remarkably consistent about it. Unless this guy has been in a coma since 2015, he cannot credibly claim to be surprised about who Trump is. He knew and didn't care.
No thank you. I’ve had more than enough of Trump’s divisive destructive rhetoric.

Here's a wild theory for you: Trump tweets outrageous things he know will never happen so that he can sit back and watch heads explode.   Meanwhile, he continues to work his agenda out of the limelight, with attention focused elsewhere. I'd say you are one of many taking the bait

Trump violates the Constitution on a daily basis, but that isn't relevant to you.
Donald Trump loves America.
This is exactly what he is doing. He’s taking about court litigation. Litigation which is Trump’s playbook in business and the WH. He’ll have his 38 percent and GOP going right along with him. GOP pretent to fall on a sword to protect Election Day- HA. GOP will contest it too.

Trump Voted absentee in NY in 2018 and in FL March primary, despite being in the area and driving past early voting locations.He also listed the wrong birth date on a 2017 absentee ballot for New York mayor and tried to register to vote in FL in 2019 with an out-of-state address.
Reminder. Trump killed Herman Cain. There is film of him doing it. It’s stronger evidence than the Zapruder film. Trump murdered a human being on live tv. This is all that matters right now

Like when you see Democratic politicians ignore violent protesters who are hurting and maiming our police officers and destroying cities. The Democrats remain silent hopeful the anarchists will do enough damage to our great country so President Trump won’t get re-elected.

Trump is not America. He will learn the hard way come November 3rd.  Anyone delaying mails, anyone blocking polling stations... We don’t want any disruption in  exercising our votes. Count on it... Trump is warned and so are his armed supporters as well.  Barr is warned too.

Can you imagine if Trump was President during WWII? How many different ways would he have screwed up? No doubt he would’ve been jealous of famous generals like Eisenhower and MacArthur. He would’ve pushed them out and replaced them with incompetent toadies.

Democrats cheating to win an election. Absolutely!! They would clear out the cemetery’s and drag corpses to vote if they could. They already have all the MSM’s votes in their pockets. The Democrats have tried everything already to remove Trump so what’s ballot cheating.
The importance of what  says here cannot be overstated. Any discussion of Trump's attacks on vote-by-mail or any other electoral process that does not focus on Operation November the 4th is doing the country a grave disservice.
I looked it up. Looks like Melania put the wrong birthdate. Ha!
Yes but there is film of him killing Herman Cain. It’s like the Zapruder film. But trump is on the film killing Herman Cain. No pics of Oswald shooting Kennedy
Imagine having Trump's cock so far down your throat that you think it's perfectly acceptable for the leader of the most powerful country on Earth to "joke" by actively undermining our democracy and threatening to delay a free and fair election because he's afraid he'll lose.
At a sleepover, my friends mom told us she was ordering pizza and zero irony made frozen pizza in the oven then tried to play it off as delivery so when you tell me Donald Trump is the worst con artist of all time forgive me if I disagree
Erin, you and your network and hosts are evil dispicable people. What you all did today by using Herman Cains death to blame Trump. Sad that Mr Cain passed, but he was a big boy, and made his own choices about how to live, TRUMP didn’t make choices for him. Evil
What a tremendous burden it must be for you to still be defending Donald Trump
Donald Trump is just sent up a trial balloon to see if republicans will continue to support him if he rejects the core democratic principals of America. --&gt; Support for Donald Trump is now mutually exclusive with support for the US Constitution and America.
Let’s not allow Trump to move the goalposts. A win is a win even if it’s by one vote
I have not yet had any dreams about the upcoming election, but that doesn't mean that I won't. I did have a dream of Trump standing next to Putin, and I think that it's telling me that Trump is loyal to Putin, and not the people of the United States.
This is very real. I had this called not soon after he took office. It all added up for me. I did the research. I have always been ahead of the curve. Trump cannot reveal his taxes because he has loans from Russia for his failures. This is how he is paying Putin back.
Just an idea....what if Amazon, UPS, and FedEx pulled together to deliver all our mail-in ballots. All private companies, trump wouldnt be able to 'slow' delivery of our votes.

Maybe we should kill all people who support Trump?  (Don't see what want to see! I just posted a question in response bro!)  He's floating anti-American ideas with a question mark as a cheap get out of jail free card.   And for posterity: no, we obviously do not kill anyone.
Why ? Did trump kill Ben Carson like he killed Herman Cain?
Herman Cain dies from coronavirus  Cain was one of the surrogates at President Donald Trump's June 20 rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma -- which saw at least eight Trump advance team staffers in attendance test positive for coronavirus  They didn’t wear masks
One thing we we've experienced 1000s of time and should be prepared for, Trump doesn't need to do anything "legally".
I think he was doing the same thing then. Lol.  I don't think he expected to be the nominee.   Trump is about Trump first.  He has to feel like a winner.  Also don't get me wrong, I voted for him and think he did a lot of good things.
Of course they were.  Arkansas' governor is a Republican and hardline evangelical. I wonder if Trump will send in his thugs when the protests start?
He’s winded.  Trump is grossly overweight.
We all said people would die. Trump’s campaign knew that’s why people signed waivers but because of Trump’s narcissism and Trump’s need for applause, they continued with the Trump Tulsa Coronavirus Rally. #TrumpVirus #RIPHermanCain

You are right.Obama was much more than a pretty face.He led the country out of an economic crisis. Took out Bin Ladin.Was tough &amp; yet not cruel on illegal immigration &amp; was an important player on the world stage.Trump on the other hand looks like crap &amp; has destroyed our country!

Joe Biden doesn't even run his own twitter page, let alone tweet his own messages.  At least Trump can write his own tweet. But, I'll never forget how Biden criticized Trump for using Twitter only to have someone create a page for him. Talk about a follower.....  TRUMP2020🇺🇸
No masks. No distancing.  Remember when the media was so impressed when Trump finally recommended that people wear masks?  Also, why is he so stupid?
He's getting everyone on record insisting the election happens on 11/3 and not a month later. This is classic Trump.
Herman Cain either died by suicide brought on by stupidity,  or was killed by Trump. Take your pick. #TrumpVirusDeathToll150K

Thank you to   and  for joining us to talk about mail-in voting and  tweet about postponing the election today.  Terrific conversation that you can listen to here.
There are really 50 separate elections and I am assuming that (1) Congress will not vote to change the day, (2) if Trump pushes delay any way, only red states will agree, so (3) blue states like CA will elect representatives and senators on November 3rd either way.

He seems steady to me. Ready for August, which looks to be the first month of the Election in earnest.  Everything is practice up until then.  Awareness of Universal Mail-In (my state is allowing Excuse-Free Absentee) and what it means isn’t all about Trump’s campaign. Important.
I hate political giving &amp; wish it wasn’t important, but it is.   I’m horrified by trump presidency &amp; don’t want to wake up in a few months &amp; wish I had done more. I just gave &amp; will continue to btwn now &amp; Nov.  If you feel the same, pls do the same! 🙏  Thx  for the prompt.

Oh stop lying.  No one in the US DQs the candidates for not supporting the 'patriot act', thinking California should be a country, or disagreeing with 2nd amendment.    And there's no sedition of any of these HK candidates.  Just stop lying like trump 🤣
Trump doesn't give a damn about the Constitution &amp; who's going to stop him! No one has stopped him for 4 years!
If Trump had worn a mask Cain might still be alive.
I am tired of the  and  of saying Trump’s statements are “false”. Call them what they are: LIES. He lies. Often, and repeatedly. It’s what he does. Call a spade a spade. Quit with the weird deference to a monstrous man.
Well Lauralie if you do follow sports you can see that the 60 game MLB season isn't going to last much longer! Maybe if Trump sent the pandemic team to China in Jan? Oh forgot he dismantled Obama's pandemic team
Saying we aren’t moving the election but we have to stop the Democrats from committing fraud is just pathetic because it aids Trump’s desire to not concede a lost election. Vote her out also.
I think you missed (as did Trump) the point of the story. It was from CBS News and was more about how reliable/timely is the USPS. They didn’t actually mail ballots so the postal workers had no reason to do anything.
Do you mean concerned about trump killing Herman Cain?

Lady G, you need to get off the sinking trump ship fast.
Yes. I am glad Biden waited until August to announce, less time to attack. I like something about every choice, but I thought Tammy Duckworth would be the toughest for Trump to go after. And he already tried, so no one is safe
Obama is so corrupt, taking millions of dollars to roast Trump LOL
Forget that. Trump killed Herman Cain. That is the only thing that should be talked about tonight. George Floyd and Herman Cain are both dead bc an ignorant piece of shit killed them. Why aren’t there protesters carrying signs saying that
He was talking about a simulation if Trump didn’t leave. CIA bullshit.
It’s probably because Trump sucks!
Yup. He did turn it into a political rally. But he was on point with what he was talking about. And it is funny that as soon as Obama started walking up to the pulpit, Trump called in the WH Press Corps.
😁Going to the TRUMP bld lol. Yup. Tomorrow.  Well not that part of hospital. But still. Driving bye it. I always see sign smile.  Can't believe they named parking lot ...Trump lot. Too. Lol.

No, it’s the way it is because Donald Trump failed when the country needed a leader. #VoteBlue
When you look at Trump who went to a great school and you hear him speak he lacks intelligence, emotional intelligence as well as a moral compass. So I don’t put much weight in what school people attended or the degrees they hold even though I have advanced degrees.
Regardless of whether we have a Biden victory and a “Green Energy Initiative” or a Trump victory and an “Infrastructure Package”   U.S. Markets will win &amp; are going much higher in 2-3 yrs
Trump is incapable of any human emotion.
Interesting. I’d just read he was Trump’s biggest defender in the silly, costly, impeachment hearing &amp; I donated $5 and then...there he was last night!
Though Trump’s idea is ludicrous, it speaks to our deepest fears as Americans. Let’s reform our elections &amp; protect our democracy. #mapoli #ma04 5/5
Today Trump “floated” the idea that we might need to postpone the November election. No matter how ridiculous and illegal it may be, we have to be prepared.  As the only candidate in this race who has sued the Trump Administration over 50 times, here’s what we need to do: 1/5
Remember trump bragging at some point that the virus wasn't going to kill 100k people. That it was going to be only 60k or so.
At the risk of sounding naive, I really believe that the Majority of Senate and House Republicans are hoping Trump loses in November. I think they've had it with him, they just don't have the balls to speak up and alienate their own bases at home.
Trump Brags About His Reading Comprehension  via
I thought the same. Can’t help thinking this is conservatives recognizing that Trump is going down in flames and trying to force him out of the election.

Let’s see if the Congress does something about it. The Republicans gain from vote by mail (old people), so all the GOP is wishing that Trump would STFU.
From there, Joy hit the devastating US GDP numbers, then discussed Trump's threats to delay the election, and brought on Senator     #TheReidOut
No, we can lay this at Trump’s feet, and the sycophant GOP who obey him. #Sociopath45
Uh oh!
Wonder how many people not named Herman Cain died from Covid after being exposed at a trump rally.
This woman is on absolute crack if she actually thinks there's a chance the military will run a coup with Trump.  Give me a fucking break.
Anyone who claims they didn't know who Trump was from the very beginning is full of shit. They knew and didn't care. They tossed a grenade into the White House and blithely figured the shrapnel would hit someone else.
This quote from the cofounder of the Federalist Society will go down as a marker in the Trump era.
Today, when President Obama was ready to speak at the John Lewis memorial, Trump quickly scheduled a Press conference to say nothing. How will Trump handle Harris,  Biden and President Obama during the next months? We’ll see.
All the more reason which proves Trump's failure, no?  I don't remember unemployment going up to 15% or GDP dropping 9% during H1N1.  Amazing what competent leadership can do during a crisis!
Yeah, that makes sense. What if they want to ignore all the rules?  Oh wait. That’s Trump.
Like a lot of the narrative around Trump's repeal of the AFFH rule this thread focuses on the suburbs. It's understandable because that's the political context he's making the move in. But it will also affect cities' ability to provide housing for other vulnerable populations.
“You were all celebrating” Jesus Christ you are f’d in the head. There were as many people celebrating that as when Trump said he saw crowds of people dancing on rooftops when the twin towers collapsed (none)
I guess we have different perspectives on that one. As bad as wills may get he will never compare to trump. A meglomaniacal wannabe dictator. At least i hope. I saw what he said as simpleton bs not as racist. Did we see a POC as the uber driver? No. JMO 1/2
Trump’s entire worldview is rooted in combatively exploiting divisions: native against immigrant, rich against poor, and now city against suburb, writes
Republicans openly challenge Trump's tweet on delaying election. Great! It’s about time.They realize Trump will likely lose, so now they are less afraid of him &amp; out to protect themselves from disaster. But they should lose after more than 150,000 are dead
Except for when the law is applied to Trump and his friends, Grassley.
This Trump thing has ended up so much worse than I feared. Wow. Oh my fucking God
"Mark Zuckerberg says" is like "Donald Trump says". You just ignore everything that follows for the next couple of minutes.
Did you even watch or listen to the eulogy?  Your trump ignorance is showing by your comment.
This is my shocked face re: Trump trying to postpone/stop/etc the 2020 election: 😐
Fairly certain that burning the flag would not be something Trump supporters would do in masse. Just a wild guess
That’s called FACTS. He attended Trump’s campaign rally in Tulsa and didn’t wear a mask. Nine days later he tested positive and now he’s dead. FACT
No my vote is my vote. I'm not voting for Trump or Biden. I'll take my chances with Sedinam and Mark.
i really like our owner so i would respectfully say i chose not to. If our owner insisted, I would have to say i am exercising my right not to meet Trump
Trump fckn hated them.  No wonder why. Hello. They act like over the phone.  They deserve firing and suied.
Trump said we are the laughingstock of the world I think he is the laughingstock world feels  sorry for us and 152,000 dead because of trump
Hernan Cains death wont effect trump bc trump has no pulse. He is the anti-Christ.
#Repost  with  ・・・ This is America.   We are a democracy, not a dictatorship.   The Constitution sets the date for the election in November. Nothing President Trump says, does, or tweets can change that.
Trump is standing up telling lie after lie when he ever put the country before himself no
Didn’t Trump say it was the “China virus”? Are you disputing the all knowing Trump?
Maybe McConnell is only 99.9999% bad.   But he should have stood up sooner.   Republicans to Trump: You can't delay 2020 election
It's mildly encouraging. Too bad the politicians he's unerringly voted for will do nothing of the sort. Also, anyone who claims they didn't know who Trump was from the very beginning is full of shit. They knew and didn't care.
please declare a cease and desist for Trump using your song. It’s too good to be tarnished, especially considering its meaning.
Trump seen wearing a mask for 4th time.  CDC recommended wearing a mask 118 days ago.   Trump says he's saved millions of lives. The reality is that he's killed tens of thousands, likely to be hundreds of thousands.
Trump First
Correct. Their terms are up, just like Trump’s.  67 Senators would be left as Congress.
best path would be to impeach and remove before election.  i don't think anybody--even Trump--has any idea what he wouldn't do.  hide the nuclear footballs.  who would Putin tell him to Nuke?
THANKS TO THE TRUMP VIRUS OUR COUNTRY IS IN SHAMBLES AND IT'S NOT STOPPING THERE.
Great speeches from all three Presidents. Trump should take note.
Trump loves walls so much this is a beautiful thing to watch as they are closing in. Can I help pay for it?
Wonder what would happen if all the votes were counted by people who went to the polls &amp; Trump lost big time, would he then insist on waiting for the mailed votes? Would he insist on just the absentee ballots be counted &amp; not the rest of the mailed votes?
I’ll believe it when any actual Republican elected officials turns on Trump
I have never seen so many hateful people as I saw when Democrats blame President Trump for coronavirus, violent protests, and even the bad weather!  It’s the usual Finger Pointing Democrats’ SLANDER STRATEGY for which they’re famous!

Anyone betting on you for anything is throwing good money after bad. The meaning of trump is useless, valueless. Sorry.
America has never delayed a presidential election, even during war
Point is the media is pushing two of the worse candidates in history we need to save ourselves Biden doesn’t have an idea what he’s doing. Trump is only seeing the 💰
A YouGov poll found that 57% of Americans declared Clinton the winner, while 30% declared Trump the winner. A Politico/Morning Consult poll showed that 49% of likely voters thought that Clinton won the debate, while 26% thought that Trump won, and 25% were undecided.
the message is crafted for the audience, like the Nigerian prince email scam, it's only looking for the dumbest, to reduce the pipeline, so it disqualifies anyone who realizes that its a scam. Trump is comprising a list of the dumbest of the dumb.
You want dementia Biden? He’s clearly showing the signs of it. Or do you want Trump who’d rather be a celeberity than president
Sometimes I slap my knees during Trump’s briefings. Today I think I may have fractured a bone.
Trump the imbecile killed over 151,000 Americans and destroyed the economy, made the USA a worldwide laughingstock and still thinks he’s right about everything.  #TrumpIsNotWell
Can imagine if Trump does that everyday, how many souls will be saved.
Only anger coming from me is directed toward Trump / GOP party. ☺️
I’m sure there won’t be anything said about this by Trump
Trump killed him with his lies and abject stupidity during this pandemic.
You must have dementia, considering your statement. Have you heard any statements Trump has made in the last few months?
You should be allowed to do that. Since trump was allowed to kill Herman Cain
My own mother (who suffers from TDS) told me she is prepared to die of Covid before taking HCQ because it’s touted by Trump. This is what mainlining CNN does to people...
He doesn't actually say he won't vote for Trump.
It's going to be even worse now that there's a friend of the WH in the top spot, too.
literally every single criticism, big or small, against biden will be met with "lol remember trump tho be grateful" i feel a lot of despair thinking about it and just wanna move to the middle of the woods
Trump has killed Herman Cain indirectly and 150,000 more Americans.
Aren’t those the same people who created systematic racism whilst blaming trump
Strange that someone complained about that but nobody seems to be complaining about trump killing Herman Cain
Governor Raimondo on Trump’s tweet to delay elections: ‘He’s insane’

Again, if I were Biden, I wouldn't do anything till the debates, Trump can't save himself from himself, we just need to crack is base of uneducated idiots.

i talk about trump wanting to stay but the REALLY depressing feeling is that itll still be bad, biden will win, and everyone will just pretend its normal again
Trump doesn’t need to actually delay the election. He just needs to have the idea out there so when he loses he can use it to justify why he won’t accept the results.
Trump is killing Americans.
RACIST Trump was nowhere to be found at John Lewis’ funeral where all real presidents were.
The constitution. It’s clear. No grey areas. No competing interpretations. And even McConnell spoke up. trump’s tweet was just to keep the conversation away from the horrible economy, job loss, and plummeting GDP. And it worked.
Thank you. The only thing anyone should be talking about tonight is that trump killed Herman Cain

Trump killed Herman Cain
Ya.  At what point does 🇺🇸 #Military look at one another &amp; say enough?   Trump needs be escorted out of our White House in handcuffs, he’s killed 150k + Americans, is turning America into Russia 2.0 &amp; is ALLOWING PUTIN TO PUT BOUNTIES ON OUR SOLDIERS HEADS! What the actual fuck?!
I'm sorry, who is president?  I do believe it's Trump and not Pelosi. So what does the speaker of the house have to do with influence on Trump stopping covid?  If anything, he should have done it and stopped the virus and made her look bad for interfering.
This is called Desperation. Trump’s days are coming to end even with him trying to Hijack the Election
In other words, she accepts the death of any number of children so long as Donald Trump tells her she’s pretty
is one of the few journalists who honestly reports trump’s mental decline. It’s a scandal that    and other media won’t report or analyze it; instead report his lies and craziness as if he’s normal.
Continue....so "When the river sounds something brings!" Trump is already contesting an election that hasn't taken place so expect the worst. In his mind, he isn't going anywhere. Trump declared Biden/Trump election results may take years so be aware a dictatorship ahead.....
No he deserves to be tried for war crimes and should be shunned by everyone for the damage he caused which far outweighs what trump could ever do
trump is an embarrassment!!
Hello Folks, Trump is very stupid. Media sets a trap and he falls into it like a very dumb fish caught with a hook. Street folks sit looking at ways trump can react to elections. He can delay. Great idea, Trump tweets...delay elections. An intellegent man will consult his lawyer
I’m Mail in voting this year only bc Trump is so adamant people don’t!
Pathalogical liar.  #LiarInChief #Trump
Hey have you mentioned trump killing Herman Cain
OK. Just spitballin’ here:  Trump gets reelected and has 4 years to say whatever crazy shit comes into his crazy brain.  MAGA believes it all and does the crazy shit and their mortality rate spikes dramatically.  Not really the worst possible outcome, right?
That show trial was embarressing to the Democrat party.  Thanks for bringing the Trump election home!

And he can reminisce about trump killing Herman Cain
Everyone follows Dr. Fauci's advice tRUMP and his cronies voted out by a disgraceful landslide tacos
I believe Trump made this statement to take attention away from Congressman Lewis’ funeral and to give Republicans an issue on which they could say they stood up to him.  It was a gift to Republican incumbents  in Congress and they are taking full advantage of it.
Thanks man. Way pass on some seriously fucked up shit. So what are those exactly? GILFT’s. Grandma’s in lineto fuck trump. Lining up for the toadstool.

Would have been better if someone talked about trump killing Herman Cain
Disappointed that he didn’t mention trump killing Herman Cain
We need to make sure Trump knows that Pelosi will be president after 1/21/21 and until a replacement is determined.
Not just Trump. I hold McConnell  and Mnuchin responsible for enabling him. And Varr and countless other greedy ones.
We're gonna find some interesting shit, Trump had nothing to do with epstein for good reason!
Did you notice that trump killed Herman Cain
Is there anything that you don't blame on Trump?? Just curious....
We are at the point in history where the  should ask Trump to resign
trump’s speech tonight was like Ross from Friends practicing his speech for Barbados
They certainly aren’t Trump supporters you imbecile. And there’s plenty of new ones with all the Biden-voters trying to burn down buildings, assaulting police, and beating people on streets.
Your numbers are a bit off, Dear.

How does #Trump not watch  and think:   "Ohhhhhhh.  Right. I get it now. Im really not even close to being qualified for this position. I will never be a leader like Obama. I resign effective immediately."
Dude you literally admitted to accidentally voting in favor of giving Trump access to more nuclear weapons because you forgot to read the bill...
The most fraudulent election was the one Donald Trump “WON”
Bill Clinton supports Civil Rights. Marc is being needlessly critical. Focus on voting for Biden and kicking Trump out of the White House. Marc didn't vote for Hillary.
I saw this on the news last night and will NEVER EVER EVER WATCH THIS MAN AGAIN he is insinuating Jones HAS TO BE GETTING PAID TO SUPPORT TRUMP! A  BLACK MAN TO ANOTHER BLACK MAN MAKING AN ACCUSATION AS SUCH ESPECIALLY  TODAYS ENVIRONMENT...disgusting &amp; MELVIN should be fired!
More likely distracting from the crushing economy. 1.4 million newly unemployed. A loss of GDP of 33%. That’s the story he was trying to bury. trump couldn’t care less about Herman Cain.
He cares so much about Herman Cain he needs to read a quick prepared statement about his passing which occurred due to a virus he caught at a Trump rally. #TrumpVirus
Me in jail after slapping trump
Trump appears to be General Custer realizing it over
I wonder that everyday when the left keeps the cure of Covid out the people's hands, and the only person who has told us some truth, "Trump"we are going against him because we're brainwashed by the mainstream media. We can't think for ourselves cause sheep only follow.🐏🐏🐏
That’s assuming we still have a Constitutional Gvt &amp; Trump has not seized power. Who will stop the CIC? How many divisions does Pelosi have?
Trump will be most remembered for this eloquent statement
The Judiciary the Answer to The rogue Leader Donald Trump not Accepting of Defeat in the 2020 Election 💓❓☮️
This is good analysis/summary of the situation. I don't think Trump has the political capital with the right people to be able to pull off something like this. I do think there is danger in his supporters rushing to the streets to defend him and starting to do bad things
Doing everything he can Brian. Why do think the Republicans want the USPS to go bankrupt. (A word Trump knows all to well)
Totally staged. 12,000 troops for one prisoner to make Trump look like he freed him.
What these patsies don't understand is it's much easier for Biden to adopt progressive policies now, not "after getting rid of Trump" -- the pressure to go right will only be more intense if/when he's PotUS...
Trump wants the protests to turn violent.  Don’t give him what he wants.
We are in this because of the  They enabled this &amp; used Trump &amp; his cronies to execute their divisive vision.  Instead of improving the country they have sold it out for their own ideology. No one should look at this as anything but an irresponsible statement on their mess

You could protect the country by expanding the Medicare program to be more of an all encompassing #MedicareForAll.  That would put the pursuit of happiness within the reach of ALL Americans.  It would have the added benefit of guaranteeing your win over Trump in November.

💯% Clueless SHEEPS! I hate Trump, so I'm gonna blame everything that happens to grown adults on him, because I'm a big baby and I need my masters who control the mainstream media to tell me how &amp; what to think. Because God forbid I use my own brain. I'm to dumb to think 4 myself
Trump's Covid19 briefing is more about him and voter fraud than the 4.5 million Americans infected and the 154 thousand already dead.

Trump and the GOP will do everything they can to derail the election, from letting a virus spread like wildfire to planting seeds of fraud and doubt. It’s only going to get worse. Every action from them from now until Nov. 03 is only about stealing the election.
Trump is garbage
I’m sorry but some folks are acting like Trump hasn’t been shitting all over the Constitution for 4 years, with zero consequences. So, the “he can’t cancel the election, calm down” gaslighting needs to stop. He only “can’t” if people stop him. Otherwise, it’s a paper fence.
What happens if Trump supporters boycott the rigged election? Anything besides a blue wave and greater political division?
The guy who rigged his own Foundation and Trump University is, as usual, accusing others of things that he himself, has done.
If you discredit the process more and more, people will believe it to be true.  Dont let Donald Trump's words dismay you. We need the USPS up and running by November. #VoteHimOut
I hate Trump so much, that like a child I'm gonna blame everything that happens to grown adults who make decisions on him. Like my masters who control the mainstream media do. I'm a Big Baby and I need the MSM to tell me what to think because God forbid I use my brain #HermanCain

After watching these 3 former presidents speak at Ebenezer church earlier, I just couldn't stomach more than 5 min of Trump's Coronavirus Briefing on now.
At the very least, wouldn’t Trump announcing that he’s delaying the election be election tampering?Not having to think about Trump
I'm not responsible for Trump
Do you think Herman Cain knew he was signing his DEATH WARRANT when he signed the COVID waiver at Trump’s Arizona rally?😳
I hate Trump and the Republican Party. I also hate the Clintons. Case in point why...
Awesome! Love President Trump! ❤️
I am challenging all of you to go back to Washington and take up the Democrats Cares Act ASAP this weekend and pass it without issues and tell Trump to sign it now..If you don't..your done
Ben this is an atypical election year. This is not the normal left/right divide. Trump is a clear and present danger to the fabric of the Republic. He derides our allies, warms up to despots, has an antiquated sense of economics, casts doubt on our institutions.1/
Don't forget Trump Glenn...I know Im not your fav follower..not sure why..So I'll jus sit in the back of your legal room and observe..no worries
What’s on? The Election?  If Biden makes a splash with his already-later-than-Hillary-did-it-in-2016 VP announcement, Trump will have to keep up amid the hype.
Trump lies about everything except who he is. He's never pretended to be decent; and he's been remarkably consistent about it. Unless this guy has been in a coma since 2015, he cannot credibly claim to be surprised about who Trump is. He knew and didn't care.
How can you be proud of the #Bladen use of using Corgess man the Horrible John Lewis furanel as if he was still president or running. It shouldn't be all about trashing the police! He's still the most curport Pres in history. We do and he didn't send all the jobs to China TRUMP
Fuck this guy for pretending he didn't know who Trump was.
I think he was doing the same thing then. Lol.  I don't think he expected to be the nominee.   Trump is about Trump first.  He has to feel like a winner.  Also don't get me wrong, I voted for him and think he did a lot of good things.
He seems steady to me. Ready for August, which looks to be the first month of the Election in earnest.  Everything is practice up until then.  Awareness of Universal Mail-In (my state is allowing Excuse-Free Absentee) and what it means isn’t all about Trump’s campaign. Important.
Little did Congressman Hurd how many Americans Trump’s incompetence would kill when he voted against Impeachment.
Anyone who claims they didn't know who Trump was from the very beginning is full of shit. They knew and didn't care. They tossed a grenade into the White House and blithely figured the shrapnel would hit someone else.

Trump matters about as much as the dead ant on the bottom of my shoe.
not liking that another country interfered with the candidates help and blessing is knee thing, not accepting is another or Trump wouldn't be in the White House - how do you not understand the difference? Trump is seeing he isn't leaving  no matter the results

White House visitor logs say otherwise, something that is archived and unaltered. Trump outted him to the feds and Miami PD in the late 90s for going after an employees underage daughter. Reported him and banned him from his clubs that was the last of their connection
In today’s world where politics seems to be such a big deal maybe, but when he met his wife maybe politics wasn’t such a big deal and at this point hes not wanting to divorce a woman because of her political beliefs. With that said he could be a Trump supporter, who knows, not us
Trump is the only “politician” who outted Epstein for the scum he was.  had the story for years and squashed  who wanted to put it out. That was done to protect people like     why did Epstein see Obama 3 times at the WH

I was talking about Biden the actual pedofile, Trump has signed more executive orders than any other president to protect children and prevent sex trafficking to the point where he declared January prevention of human trafficking month. Do some research outside the fake news!
We need to get Trump out of office! Our country is suffering under his leadership.
Trump isnt losing
This is not a dog whistle, this is him telling us what he is going to do. Trump wants to be a dictator. He will not give up the White House. This should scare and infuriate every American #Totalitarianism #trumpsadictator #votesaveamerica #TrumpThreatensAmerica
Remember when they didn’t let trump institute a travel ban in January when he wanted to. I do
He also won't say he will accept the results. Several states ONLY vote by mail. Trump has done it. Barr has done it. This is NOT how we handle elections in America. This is how a dictator acts, not a President.

It doesn't help that unlike Donald Trump or Bob Arum, Vince is so out of tough with today's audiences. Watching RAW and Smackdown feels like I am loosing brain cells and even the wrestlers and staff realize Vince is the main problem. He has become Al Davis in the 2010's.
She is a fake. A phony. She will say what ever she thinks you want to hear to be relevant.  Teresa is a Trump supporter so Jennifer will do whatever Teresa does. This does not surprise me at all.
Im not friends with a childhood friend because of political rants that he wanted social media applause for ... he’s a lefty and hates trump. I asked for examples of the topic he was railing against. I got threats and called really horrible things. That’s the go to for them.
Rep. Nadler I forwarded that to you today. Its outragous. I am disabled and so is my wife of 35 years. We are low income. I am asking you to call Out or even ask Twitter's  To testify on Trumps racist tweets and suspend Trump or remove him from Twitter. This is wrong

YOU HAVE TO REMOVE TRUMP FROM YOUR TWITTER PLATFORM. YOU CANNOT ALLOW THIS.. A reminder that back in 1973 Donald Trump's company was charged by the Justice Department with violating the Fair Housing Act by discriminating against black rental applicants.
I want Trump removed from Twitter and so should you! This is racism. Plain and simple. When does it stop!
Has anyone checked if Kelly Loeffler or Richard Burr recently bought Kodak stock? How about Trump's family or Louise Linton?
Nothing is illegal in the Trump Administration. Every loss in court is defied and spun as a victory. Everything else is swept under the rug by Mitch and given lip service by Nancy.
Lawless Trump administration makes its Supreme Court defiance official
I am pleading with you to suspend Mr.Trump from Twitter.Racism. I am happy to inform all of the people living their Suburban Lifestyle Dream that you will no longer be bothered or financially hurt by having low income housing built in your neighborhood...
The  has spent decades stoking racial resentment in coded and subliminal ways (mostly), but Trump's uncut raw way of saying the unsaid part out loud will backfire on him, pushing many in the opposite direction.
Those were conclusions shared with the President by medical professionals. He chose to share some hope with the country. Turns out more and more doctors are agreeing with him. If you don't like the news because President Trump is saying it, that's got nothing to do with him.
At this point, saying anything about Trump is just pointing out the obvious. Time to start pointing out the people who enabled him.
It needs to be a decisive victory, not a skin of the teeth one. Just winning those would be a win on paper, but "unclear" enough for Trump to challenge the results and cause a constitutional crisis far worse than Bush v Gore.

Trump losing 2020 will feel even more hopeless than him winning 2016. The idea of him losing should be a joyous one but we've been robbed of anything to celebrate in it.

Trump's new fab-fav Covid-19 medical doctor, also a preacher, apparently holds a position relative to "demon sperm." Although the below song I wrote has a lot in it, the last verse seems applicable to both Trump and his new MD fav who he retweeted.
Lol,  talk to me in November.  We heard this before.  There is no way trump can win the electoral college, blah blah blah.   Your just setting your lunatic base up for heartbreak and it will be great to see
His parents raised him better also. I look at him the same way I looked a Trump.
That’s what he get for being a republican. 🤷🏾‍♂️ Wasn’t he put in the colored section at a Trump rally???

From day 1 you have done zip for the american people but for Trump only.. You have covered up for him for every crime Trump committed in the WH.  You said Trump is above the law or his false immunity. Neither Trump or you are above the law per the SCJ !
I’d tell an inappropriate polish joke but he already follows Trump.

keep thinking about how Joe Biden wouldn't let Ady Barkan do an endorsement video for him without humiliating the guy in a show of callousness that rivaled many of the worst displays of the Trump presidency
The vaccine not ready yet ...saving years Yah Sure Tremendous pressure to get a vaccine out there. The Trump administration is guaranteed to screw it up more people died unnecessary. 145,000 Americans died from the #coronavirus on baby Donald watch! I really don’t care, do you?
Ok an actual idiot in  thought that  - a man who ran a national campaign and a gubernatorial Race in the largest state was an idiot? This is pure propaganda from  - mudslinger for the Trump family
Trump can stay far away..
All-star?  More like no-star.  So Trump team is not trying to win new voters with that line up but just hold the diehard red hatters.
A vote for trump is literally dangerous and treasonous Trump supporters and voters should be charged with treason and/or locked up in homes for the deranged and mentally dangerous. No one really wants Biden but it’s either politics as usual or the end of days.
Look at Trump try to spin away a humiliating defeat on his convention
Cartoon: The unbelievable Trump
Facebook has repeatedly refused to hold Donald Trump to any sort of standard on its platform. It's time for federal regulators to investigate #Facebook and act!
because Mr. Lewis did nothing to aid Trump. That's it.
They would never fire him.  Can you imagine the book he would write exposing CNN and how it was his job to push anti trump news
He doesn't care whether residents of the red states live or die either - other than the fact that he understands it will hurt he re-election chances.  Labeling Trump a sociopathic narcissist honestly barely even scratches the surface of how damaged he is.

Trump Suggests Replacing Unfair Elections With New System Where Eligible Male Heir Inherits The Presidency  via
Every one wants schools to reopen - when it’s safe to do so. Biden can be trusted to do that. Trump emphatically cannot.
You mean Trump, who’s doing more to make Americans unsafe than any president in history?
For those who think Trump has ever pivoted, changed his tone, become presidential, grown into the job, or responded to the gravity of the situation, you need to read this piece by the great
I'm sure this is not a pleasing thing to hear, much less a pleasing thing to say, but... IMO, it means the powerful and the elites have more in common with each other than they have differences. In a few years, Trump will be among them.
trump is not a no child left behind guy, he's entering the school year knowing there will be causalities

Can you imagine if Trump was President during WWII? How many different ways would he have screwed up? No doubt he would’ve been jealous of famous generals like Eisenhower and MacArthur. He would’ve pushed them out and replaced them with incompetent toadies.
Our ongoing and unnecessary national tragedy is not a matter that will be settled or fixed with an intemperate tweetstorm. But bygones will not be bygones when Trump leaves the stage.
According to #Trump, after 4 years of #MAGA, the country still isn't sophisticated enough to have voting by snail mail.  Why is that exactly
Remember that time Trump wanted to invite the Taliban to Camp David?
I've got no objection to parental support. Comes in all forms.   But, the pro-Jake Super PAC includes million-dollar Trump supporter -- Bob Kraft -- as a supporter.  Do the math.
Cause it's safer in Mexico with the Trump virus in America
Oh it's bigger than that. That's like only focusing on Trump. Bad? Sure. But the fetish lets people absolve themselves of inaction at best. Lots else is wrong here. See my earlier post about our school committee. Or look at the state of journalism here. Look at towns around us.
Yes. Trump supporters should take hydroxy, just like supporter  #MAGA
I thought the same. Can’t help thinking this is conservatives recognizing that Trump is going down in flames and trying to force him out of the election.
please declare a cease and desist for Trump using your song. It’s too good to be tarnished, especially considering its meaning.
I have never seen so many hateful people as I saw when Democrats blame President Trump for coronavirus, violent protests, and even the bad weather!  It’s the usual Finger Pointing Democrats’ SLANDER STRATEGY for which they’re famous!
It's going to be even worse now that there's a friend of the WH in the top spot, too.
How does #Trump not watch  and think:   "Ohhhhhhh.  Right. I get it now. Im really not even close to being qualified for this position. I will never be a leader like Obama. I resign effective immediately."
What happens if Trump supporters boycott the rigged election? Anything besides a blue wave and greater political division?
Donald J. Trump murdered Herman Cain. Everything he touches dies. ☠️  #HermanCainRIP #HermanCain
Hey #MAGA cunts, be sure not to send a mail in ballot to vote for #Trump since it's so rife with fraud. Do the right thing morons.
Trump, possibly the dumbest person alive, tonight at his press conference:  "Young people are almost immune to [#COVID19]".
Jeez this bootlicker is still covering for Trump. I thought he resigned over the Nazi stuff.
I’m shocked - these people actually DO have a line that Trump can cross that will make them want to impeach!
Trump gave a eulogy today after all
Listen to #Trump at his press conference. He is entirely defeated. Sounds like he is drunk and reading a Hooters menu out loud to his table.  So low energy. So incompetent. So dumb. So done!  #TrumpIsNotWell
To paraphrase President Andrew Shepherd, the United States of America is way out of Donald Trump’s league...
Sent in my #VoteByMail ballot application today! Trump can pry my vote from my cold dead hands
Maybe, but he's also not using the official POTUS Twitter account that has public records &amp; security requirements. Team could be "foldering" tweets in Trump's personal Twitter account for him to send, or sending them on his behalf. It's a great way to prop up a doddering Don.
May 25: The day the House passed the HEROES Act. Since then, clueless Trump and feckless Republicans in the Senate have done nothing. And since then 60,000 Americans have died. #thecantbebotheredtoprotectusparty
Yeah not really. He tweeted about this guy cause cancel culture was going after him for flying a trump flag.

here's a source, tailored for the trump supporter over there
The Senate map in 2022 for Dems isn't anywhere remotely as favorable as the map in 2018 was for Republicans, where Dems had to defend 25 seats -- 5 in states Trump won by 15+ -- and Republicans had to defend just 8 seats -- only one who represented a barely HRC state.
Trump killed Herman Cain
I have explained so many times how this makes us complicit in their facist attitudes and I am told we must talk to them and explore differences. Bitch the difference is I know how to care about people. Now we are gonna die of corona BC dad vacationed with the trump supporters
The Trump/ war on Medicare, Social Security, the ACA, and especially Medicaid cruelly harms 1.75 MILLION vets: “veterans who require intensive care for conditions like traumatic brain injuries..are at particular risk if the program is cut.“

Aaah...so when Trump is out of office for sure. 🤔
“CNN's Dana Bash: You said in 2014 that Obama showed ‘failed leadership’ with Ebola, when only 2 Americans died. Would you say Trump's showed failed leadership with coronavirus as 130,000 Americans have died? Sen. Joni Ernst: ‘No, I think that the president is stepping forward’”
Ohhhhhhhh I didn't know PRESIDENT TRUMP WAS THERE??? AWESOME!!!
Thanks to the Trump/ trade/tariff debacle, we’ve paid farmers $16? 12? 28 BILLION, borrowed from China,  for not selling crops to China. And now poor, weak Joni Ernst won’t comment on Trump’s threat to delay the election. “Not answering any questions,” said Ernst
Trump can’t carry Obama’s bags. He can’t lift, anyway.
Hey Ms Lindsey, please just STFU and let the grown ups talk. That "abuse" came from Trumps DOJ. Flynn pleaded guilty twice. Trump fired him within the first 20 days. A corrupt AG comes in and all of a sudden Flynn case gets dropped?🤔
I’m not sure - in what way is Will responsible? Trump isn’t really a product of the traditional Rep Party.
Trump had a lot of help in his wrecking mission from Republican Senators.
Trump's people are telling us they are planning a takeover. The issue is, who can stop this? People have to stop being surprised at this behavior and plan for it.
Everything is political for progressives. John Lewis' funeral is mostly an occasion to attack Republicans. Herman Cain's death an occasion for snarky "serves him rights" and a denunciation of Trump's Covid-19 policies.
Even Rubio and Moscow Mitch. The media should give Trump's stupid tweets less and less play.
I agree with the diagnosis. I also think it’s vital that the Greens campaign hard for Presidential votes in non-swing states, but not further endanger the world with Trump. As a green supporter, I believe it’s vital for all Greens in swing states to hold their noses and vote Dem.
First name on your charging document: Trump -discarded the Obama pandemic playbook in Jan ‘17 -dissolved the NSC pandemic defense office in May ‘18 -eliminated the post for the American in Beijing tasked with detecting pandemic in ‘19 -ignored multiple urgent mentions in his PDB

Opinion | Joe Biden accused Trump of trying to delay the election. He should know better.

I don’t think Trump understands how government works. He puts his foot in his mouth every time he opens it. He makes claims that are totally unfounded. What are his principles?
Oh yes but you have any level of confidence in Trump? I’ve always been more than William F Buckley conservative Trump is an Archie Bunker conservative at best.
So #trump cannot delay the election but congress can. Hypothetically, if republicans flip the house they can hold on to power forever. The cost of insuring extreme possiblities is increasing !
Trump is a buffoon and he’s no statesman. He applied dictators for being dictators.
The establishment dems don't care about beating Trump. That's why they chose Biden over democracy.
He came out of that Trump Rally with more than just his dick in his hand. 🙏
This does seem within the MoE, though.  Biden is likely to get at the very most 53% in FL.  Trump is likely to get at least 45-46% in FL.
Trump: "It [$1200 stimulus check] may go higher than that actually. I'd like to see it be very high because I love the people. I want the people to get it."  As always during election season, 'Republicans' discover their love for giving people free money.
Do you think that Trump should be able to delay the elections?
That seems like a pretty good strategy. Let's just sit back and wait to see what happens Nov. 3rd. After all, Trump hasn't f*cked up everything else he's touched. It's no big deal. It's just a distraction.
Seriously though, Donald Trump is trying to make Election Day as disruptive as possible.
Did you know Trump is the one that pushed for golf courses in Florida to bo opened to blacks and Jews? Did you know Jessie Jackson and the NAACP praised his accomplishments in the black community? No? Didn’t think so
4/ of 4 Hence, it’s in my blood not to sit by idly and let our glorious 244 year-old Democracy, The #USA, die an ignoble death...at the hands of #Trump &amp; his fascist wannabe cronies...people who don’t care whether U, me, or our democracy dies. Silence is not an option. #Vote 🙏🇺🇸
Trump is a DANGEROUS MORON with an agenda beholding to Putin. January 3rd can't arrive soon enough.
Do you think Trump is intending fo incite disruptive violence and/or chaos on Election Day?
Consistency: Folks freaking out about Obama because they "knew" he secretly believed things/had plans he didn't say in public then not freaking out about Trump because they "know" he doesn't believe/can't do what he says in public. 🤔
She may actually be suggesting that the Trump campaign planned it. Either way it’s lunacy
How do you know he got it at the Trump rally? It has a 7-14 day lag time to diagnosis. I guess if you get Covid and went to a rally that’s the only place he could get it!! Ya, right
Obituary: Distinguished business man. Former Head of KC Federal Reserve and former President of the American Restaurant Association. Died needlessly after a month long battle with a hoax that was contracted at a maskless #Trump Tulsa rally.  #RIPHermanCain
Then stop Trump and his newly appointed  crony Postmaster from purposely destroying the #USPS
Let me be absolutely clear.  Donald Trump killed Herman Cain.
Trump is just trying to distract from the economic numbers.
He was at Trump rallies without mask May his soul Rest In Peace
Talk to Herman Cain. Oh wait you can’t because he died from attending a Trump rally.
To me, it appears as Trump’s desperate, depraved attempt to discredit and/or prevent an election, and subsequent persecution for unlawful acts, where all indicators point to resounding defeat. Nevertheless, we must prepare.
Going to that Trump rally maskless wasn’t such a good idea huh? #JackieLaugh
Trump wanting to delay the election?  Guess who spotted this coming.   Back in April.
What about  calling Trump xenophobic &amp; a 'fear mongerer' over  closing of travel from China &amp; Europe? The Democraps hypocrisy, sanctimony &amp; lack of decency &amp; fair play is beyond appalling!
Trump killed Herman Cain.
Trump killed Herman Cain
Please don’t give trump any ideas.
Trump raises idea of delaying election. DELAY?…SCREW HIM!
States rights and small government used to be the foundation of the GOP. Trump Republicans have thrown out the playbook and plan to hold American Democracy hostage to maintain power.

Part of that is supporting Joe Biden regardless of whether he misspeaks or we don't prefer his VP choice.  America or Trump.  95 days until the election.
Donald Trump does not have the power to delay the election and he knows it. This is an empty threat.  #November3rd2020 will be a political Reckoning for him and any Republicans who still back him.
America has the worst response by far. Yes. This is now Trump and his administrations fault.
From  Trump is threatening to delay the election! We need all hands on deck for   #TeamJoe #JoeBiden2020 #MAforJoeBiden
Why won’t Trump confront Putin about the bounties on US troops? How does that support or military?
The president knows that he’s in trouble this November, and dirty tricks like this won’t save him. The Constitution is clear that Trump has absolutely no authority to delay the election. Anyone who cares about protecting our democracy must immediately reject this. #mapoli #ma04
Donald Trump isn't doing his job. With over 150K dead because of the pandemic response by your administration. Americans fear for their lives until you and your administration leaves office.
Trump was always extremely disliked.  It’s how he lost the vote by 3 million.

I’m pretty sure that Donald Trump was the Fredo of the family.
Bush is like Trump, Aryan is a concealed carry
One of the unfortunate side effects of gerrymandering.
Would anyone be surprised if it turns out Wilbur Ross’s canasta partner or  ‘s 2nd cousin knew about this before it happened? And that the money got back to Trump?
It’s the party of Alex Jones, not Donald trump
Biden will apologize to our friends, stop the pull-back &amp; recommit to our shared defense  Trump &amp; his ghouls will be nothing but a painful footnote in history His descendants will change their name. Those old enough to remember will spit at the mention of trump  #TraitorTrump
Moreover these countries are ALLIES. We share values in peace, trade &amp; commitment to democracy.  We’ve fought &amp; bled together for 70 years!  Trump, the fat lazy know-nothing coward moron, insults these friends w his retarded nonsense, while serving Putin like a dog.
They have been sitting on their hands, playing Trump orange ball, passing nothing meaningful so they are going to pay for what 2018 outlined for the House, now it’s going to be the Senate. Democrat President too. They did it to themselves. The cries are going to be caterwauling.
#Trump lacks #empathy  Cheating on taxes and using people   #FailureInChief   Like Father, Like Son: President Trump Lets Others Mourn
Trump is doing black face again.
Oh yes Kaitlan, the one talking about being impregnated by aliens. Yes that one. Is she the new west wing physician in chief, per Trump’s troglodytes ?! 😷🤷‍♂️
The black lives most at risk are inner-city school children. A Biden presidency won’t help them, writes
That comment was racist!  Trump is trying to make people afraid- “they” are coming for your wealth, your home values will plummet.   The way the economy is going Trump supporters are going to need low income housing as they get evicted and foreclose on
They’re all in for Trump/Russia/Putin. How much more evidence do you need?
By pulling troops from Germany, President Trump will weaken America’s military posture and get nothing in return.
Trump only liked Germans and Germany prior to 1945.
There is an ongoing crisis in their eyes: Trump’s tanking re-election odds
Denis, you rube.  Also, the choice between Trump and any Democrat was going to be stark. Sadly, it's turning out to be not as stark as some us had hoped.   But, more than stark enough. Not nearly in the same restaurant.
There’s absolutely NO chance that schools is starting up in September! The doctors now know that the virus spreads a lot faster inside than it does outside.. there’s no freaking way if can happen! Trump REALLY needs to back off on that! It’s going to be SO bad not only for the
The corruption is so deep. And Trump continues to exploit loopholes or erase people or measures aimed at reining in abuses. Why has election security not gotten the funding needed- still on Mitch McConnell's desk?
This is how I feel about a lot of what we are talking about. All this mass death mass incarceration, Biden doesn’t want to change it, he created it. The idea of “lesser evil” is hard in that Trump utilizes the systemic racism that Biden helped expand in the 90s &amp; 2000s
The CEO is a big Trump supporter?
The Trump gym needs to open already bro I da feel like my fitness level has been on a sharp decline since my ulnar nerve injury two years ago
Is it at all possible that trump’s covid actions are exclusively at the behest of Putin?
This is absolutely ridiculous. I’ve listened to complete Trump press conferences and speeches many many times. He sounds much much worse in context. The man is an imbecile. You have got to be joking.
Trump is in Texas and COVID-19 is raging in Texas... 🤔
And you also believe that there is a global conspiracy to make Donald Trump look bad. This fuels the idea that this is just a hoax and not really dangerous.
Check out this cartoon  via
There’s no such thing as a Republican city. There’s not a single city in the United States that voted for Trump.  As soon as you hit 800 people per share mile, we vote dem.
Expect Trump's gifts to Putin to become frequent and more lavish.
So THAT explains why tRUmp likes him.
I have yet to see a single issue which Trump and Biden aren't on the same side of.
You’re right and it is almost unbelievable but then again this is Trump.
looks terrific. Who doesn't want these things? They can ALL be priorities! Has #SusanCollins comms team "gone rogue" &amp; just decided to put out an ad for Gideon?  stands for nothing and caves to Trump on everything. #VoteSaraGideon
Remember: The Trump/ Tax Giveaway to Donors, Billionaires and Corporations gave us $$TRILLION deficits as far as the eye can see, which is making Trump’s lazy, dishonest response to CV-19 even worse: as if costing 150000 lives wasn’t tragic enough, we have unprecedented debt.
Trump won't do anything to fix it, but let's not forget that it was Bush and the 2006 Republican controlled congress that put the USPS in this position in the first place. The entire republican establishment of the last several decades is to blame.
This is what Putin charged Trump for advising him in on Portland
it's like the entire admin purchased stock in the manufacturer based on trump's recommendation (order?)  #TrumpVirus
#Trump to  discussing #Russia and the #Taliban: “I think a lot of people, if you look at some of the wonderful folks from the Bush Administration, some of them — not any friends of mine — were saying it’s a fake issue. But a lot of people said it’s a fake issue.”
This is just a story made up by Afghani officials. If it wasn't for Trump Derangement Syndrome,  no one would even be talking about this. Trump.wants to bring our troops home, and Congress wants to stop him, which should be the real scandal.
Did you see that clip from Barbara Walters interviewing tRUmp in the 1980s? She nailed him on his financial fraud but her reference to Don Jr as a problem hardly got any attention.
Dear Maine please vote out this Trump stooge
Donald J. Trump is a Trojan Horse for Vladimir Putin and Russia.  He has and will continue to do whatever Putin wants.
Remember that when Trump accuses someone, it's likely he's done it himself. So, this should read, "With Trump--our country doesn't have a chance." #BidenCoalition #TeamJoe
07/29/20: President Trump Delivers Remarks Upon Departure  via
Could this even happen before Trump leaves office in January?
New Rule: Bible Trumpers | Real Time with Bill Maher (HBO)  ABOUT 🤡🤡 TRUMP…!  via
Yeah , this guy was never going to vote blue. He will put Trump in office again if given the chance. Pretty sure he ain't getting any love from republicans either
You show Trump up nine points among 65+. Monmouth had him up ten. Fox has him up by one. Yet Quinnipiac has Biden leading in this group by fourteen. Is this just sampling variability in a smaller subgroup? Given how reliably seniors vote, this divergence is pretty important.
Unfortunately for them Trump University is now defunct.
Maine voters are concerned, troubled, and deserve a leader instead of this Trump stooge.
When?!?! When does the Trump team expose this? When????
Enthusiasm for Biden is tempered by differences over policies between him and those to his left. Enthusiasm for Trump has no policy basis, just cultish love.
Trump doesn't see the bases as having any role in our self defense. To him, they are some sort of protection racket for our Allies.  Japan and South Korea will be next.
I agree. Non violent protests will deny the Trump cult what it wants. Violent civil war and suppression of rights so authoritarianism will take over. Hasn’t it been clear since his election speech where he talked about carnage in the streets?
"The Left" must be pretty large. Today's 538 composite has Trump's disapproval rating at 55.8 percent.
Consistently denying Russia has influence over him. The universal with people caught up in the Trump cult: deny or minimize that Putin not only influenced Trump’s election but has been continually influencing decisions- all aimed at America’s demise.I like Obama...W was the 2nd worst President in history,  after Trump
Trump is to blame for Herman Cain’s death because he insisted on having his stupid Tulsa rally, and gave people a hard time about wearing a life-saving mask.   Trump’s ignorance and narcissism kills.
Life in Trump and Jared Kushner’s America!
Trump knows he is in trouble which is why he is doubling down on his fake claims of massive fraud through mail in voting. He is also suing Oregon for their program, and his forcing his newly appointed Post Office General to slow down and  dismantle operations. Trump is a monster.
And only about tRUmp
Um, so it turns out that Trump has decided to ignore her and stay , since he gets to believe he's somehow winning if he attacks his own citizens
Is it to much to ask that we have 1 day without some fakakta tweet from Trump that consumes the day?   Asking for a friend
Trump-cession
It is a shame that Herman Cain chose not to wear a face mask at Trump's Tulsa rally.  If he had, he might still be alive today -- and he would have driven a conversation that might have saved many more people.
They will think Democrats made the virus to make Trump look bad and accuse Democrats of murder
That’s kind of a weird reaction considering that you agreed with her and just ripped into her. She’s commenting negatively against Trump because he’s trying to dismantle the post office.
You realize of course by not voting for either man, you are giving a vote to Trump!
Trump has made not only America weaker, but our allies as well. He is a fool, a Russian asset and a disgrace to all Americans and the world.
Trump, a failed businessman of epic proportions and a reality TV star, has made us a laughing stock the world over...
Moron, madman, incompetent, corrupt, Trump
Does anyone believe that NATO charges a fee to be a member? Trump is as corrupt as a three dollar bill.
Why do people hate Trump and love Fauci? Because Fauci is the anti-Trump. He is brilliant, nice, sane, ethical, and obviously cares about the health of Americans! #FauciIsTheAntiTrump #FauciIsAHero
No one is more whiney than Trump supporters.  They're miserable
Here’s a friendly reminder that if you don’t support Trump and you’re not voting for Biden whatever you think of him then you’re supporting Trump.    Kthxbai.
I supposed that it was Trump’s fault that the “chair” didn’t act sooner. What a broken House we have.
Trump is a moron - only cares about pleasing Putin, never mind the damage he is perpetrating on our country and our allies. And he wonders why everyone hates him...
No one like Trump because he is a Russian asset who only cares about pleasing his boss, Putin.
Trump only cares about pleasing Putin, not doing the right thing for America, our soldiers and our allies. He is a Russian asset.
The day Trump rode down the gilded escalator.
Trump wonders why Fauci has a higher approval rating than he has - BECAUSE FAUCI IS SMART, HONEST AND OBVIOUSLY CARES ABOUT AMERICANS!!!
I think Fox was around a lot longer than Trump was a politician, but in Trump’s world, everything starts with him...
The GOP is in the swamp with Trump. They have showed us all who they are - weak, corrupt, evil and spineless.
We have quite enough racism baked into our institutions already.  Congress must reassert its authority and check the office of the president. Trump is a problem but he’s not the problem. Our 20th century trend towards dictatorship via a too powerful president is the problem
Germany doesn’t “owe” NATO anything. They just were supposed to spend a certain amount to protect their OWN country. Trump is just Putin’s bitch.
Our racist president strikes again. I guess it wasn’t bad enough that he is in Putin’s back pocket. Trump is destroying America, Americans, democracy, the rule of law, POC, as well as the damn truth. When Trump leaves office, we will need a truth and reconciliation commission.
Trump is in Putin’s back pocket. Putin is his boss and America, Americans and our allies are paying the consequences.
Without presidential leadership more Americans will die. Trump’s negligence kills. #TrumpKills
(I mean, I know this is petty as fuck, and ultimately not important, but, holy shit, what the hell is going on with Trump's orange paint. I use the word "paint" deliberately)
WHAAAAT???? 10 years? Thats just unamerican, Trump will deport you for that 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Top 10 anime betrayals is Goya products endorsing Trump.
Trump just wants to make sure no hotel is built near his hotel.  So corrupt
Yes, if he violated the law, Mr. Barr! Why is there one set of rules for Trump and his cronies, and another set for the rest of us? Barr is a sinister political agent for the most corrupt president in American history.
Didn't we find out this week that the Trump reelection campaign and the RNC are not supporting house races, and providing insufficient support to the Senate?  I guess it's because they're shoveling money out the back door to line their own pockets.
Do we think it’s possible for his judgment to become even more impaired?   I would trust many stroke survivors over Trump, regardless of his condition.
I'll never forget that Ron's death was all Trump's fault
History will not be kind to Bill Barr - Trump’s protector and prime corrupter of America’s democracy.
You talk about “law &amp; order” and you have a picture of a guy in your profile whose been defrauding people his entire life. You must have a degree from trump university.
Yes.   Would I date a Trump supporter?   Nope.
The most disgusting people are these rude, arrogant and moronic DUMBOCRATS on earth Just one more BIG push to elect  Our Pres. Donald J Trump.  #Trump2020VictoryNowMoreThanEver #MAGA #KAG
Bill Barr wasn’t aware of Trump’s tweets, things going on in his own department, status of reports, firings, etc. He even said that Obama was responsible for the coronavirus even though he hadn’t been president for 3 1/2 years! Bill Barr is nothing but a corrupt partisan.
Bill Barr couldn’t answer a straight forward question if you paid him. All he knows how to do is obfuscate. He has to be the most evil man in America because unlike Trump, he is no dummy.
yeah, there's a guy in my neighborhood who has a Trump flag and an American flag. Of course, the nitwit doesn't know enough to bring his American flag in every night as you're not supposed to fly the flag in darkness. Trump voters in a nutshell.
D'not De-Newsa loves to lie for his living.  And as Trump's following proves, there's a sucker born every minute
This was brought forth awhile ago and its disgusting that she continues to abuse this. No wonder she has a disdain/hatred for Pres. Trump~
Tom Cotten calls slavery “a necessary evil”.  What is necessary is that Trump and every single Republican is voted out of power. We don’t want racists to manage our government!
Russia put Trump over the edge- not American voters.
The American educational system is so bad - it allowed millions to be manipulated by a grifter. The folks who support Trump are white men who are not college educated and are easily manipulated. These men relate to Trump and his racism, and like him, want to return to 1955.
Trump is deliberately slowing down the mail by way of his new post master general sychophant he put in place. Trump continues  to mess with our election. Congress must step in.
Want to get back to normal? Vote our Trump - he is killing us, along with the economy, our jobs, education and sports.
America needs to ask Trump where the hell our rapid coronavirus tests are. Waiting 10 - 14 days for results is utterly useless, and that is why so many of us are dying. Trump and his Administration have rapid testing - where are ours????
Dear Mr. Trump, how the hell do you face yourself every morning? You have destroyed almost 150,000 American lives, our economy and jobs for millions. Your incompetence knows no bounds.
South Korea had their first coronavirus infection the same day the US had their’s. Baseball is back there, but because we have the most incompetent president in the world, nothing is safely back in the US. TRUMP MUST GO.
Trump will be so mad...
National Security Advisor - the most likely not to have seen Trump ever
Oh and black wages were up under trump
This says it all. Trump refuses to honor a black civil rights leader and long term representative because Trump is a racist POS. Never forget the birther hoax he perpetrated against this nation’s first black president.
Trump is always about the cruelty and the brutality against people who don’t look like him, or kiss his fat ass.
Donald J. Trump
I despise Melania tRump. I have no sympathy for her. She is not a victim &amp; is just as bad as her husband. Still, if people tweet misogynistic crap about her, I unfollow them. I am not going to be a hypocrite and applaud AOC 1 day and then excuse misogyny the next.
Seriously! Why would they call it that? It doesn’t look the least bit like Donald Trump.
Whoa whoa what?!?! I thought the protestors were all peaceful and that trump was talking smack. No? Did you change your mind cuz now you are directly affected? Hypocrisy at it is best.
At least Biden doesn't start off with "I hear by proclaim " with his statements,  unlike Trump's executive orders.  It's like Trump quotes the kings from his favorite childhood cartoons.
Hey now. It could be that trump can’t maintain an erection.
This load of misinformation is all this is. No one tell the truth so take that into consideration when reading this line of bull.. But history will show this has no validity!  den holds daunting lead over Trump as US election enters final stretch
Trump ultimately destroys everything he touches.
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
I have a Trump joke but it doesn’t hold water
Oh look another shoddy trump project. How expected
Funny how the rule of law applies to protestors and not corporations, the federal govt, the trump “empire”, the trump family, roger stone, etc...
Wear a mask daily and will vote TRUMP 2020
Federal agents should never be used as your own personal army against the citizens of the United States. Trump must go.
There's dirt.  Russia hacked the RNC also.  I think they found some interesting kompromat on Graham. They shared it with Trump who revealed it on a golf outing. Graham has been subservient since
Trump is not deserving of sympathy.   Plenty of people grow up neglected.  They don't turn into Trump.
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
I think he means if you’re a non racist trump supporter it’s past time you realize you can’t be both
It didn’t have to be like this. Trump did everything wrong during the pandemic and now Americans, our economy, our jobs and our kid’s education are at stake. Trump is an incompetent moron. 148,000 dead Americans and counting.
Yah but he's my fraud. WE VOTE TRUMP
148,000 dead Americans. Trump and the Republicans are basically mass murderers.
Trump and his Administration are corruption on steroids.
Black Trump supporter Bernell Trammell shot dead in Milwaukee
Donald Trump and selfless?  Definition of oxymoron.   Or just moron
This is my favorite ad by  Dora and Trump are a perfect combo.
I’d stand in line for 8 hours during a firefight to vote Trump out.   Which looks like it might actually happen, the way things are going.
Trump is having his goons gass innocent Americans.
Moe. Larry. Curly. Shemp. Trump.
Donald Trump and his family are a cesspool of corruption. Trump has moved nearly $400,000 of campaign donations into his private business. Nice.
I have been saying for weeks and tweeting  that Trump and McConnell plan to shut down the post office leading into the election so they can say all the Republican vote are not counted creating conditions to dispute the election.
The Trump admin seems extremely eager to provoke exactly this response, so they can justify full-on military occupation, so I feel like we might as well think through it now.
"In massive capitulation to the Trump Admin, that goes against the entire point of their existence, which is evident in their goddamn name, the CDC..."
Maybe Maxwell bought her for Trump.  Just sayin'
Chris Wallace is so determined to undermine Our President Trump. How can he possibly think Biden can debate? Is he really believing this? If so he is delusional. #TrumpPense2020 #MAGA
Trump supporters don’t know enough about grammar to know it is wrong, yet think they are smart enough about science to know what is best for children
you and trump should follow each other on here,  i dare you!  :D
Fantastic! I am positive there will be many more dollars ahead! What more can we ask for than to elect Our President Trump. #TrumpPense2020
I’m so sorry! I hope she and her mom are feeling better soon! This idea that tRump and his enablers are pushing that children are practically immune or will recover almost instantly is dangerous!
Lots to take away here
Now it's not just Trump who needs reelection to avoid prison.   Barr too.
Who's gonna tell him that it's actually Trump's America? Use small words, he doesn't sound too sharp.
I never heard such absolute BS in my entire life. The GOP and Donald Trump are a blight on America.
But, according to trump-humpers, the peaceful protesters are not ‘following the rules’!!!
joe biden literally said “in order to work at a dunkin donuts or 7/11 you have to have an indian accent”...... how is he not getting killed for that? trump says that it’s the end of the world.... double standard
Except this is Trump's America,  here and now!  How ridiculous!
I’ll bet trump never read Croy Doctorow’s “Little Brother” book.
2/2 you can "read all the science" you haven't believed for months, but you'll always be remembered for the "Trump Virus" you a-hole
Trump’s Request of an Ambassador: Get the British Open for Me - The New York Times
Trump reassured her.  Now she's less likely to flip.  Can they withhold charges until Trump is gone?
This weekend Trump called Dr. Fauci an "alarmist" and that our national health crisis, "Is what it is."  Clearly, Trump is not alarmed enough. Stop "alarming" Trump Dr. Fauci, and kick his rear to get him going....and yes, I will hold your jacket for this.
"Trump does a thing that will almost certainly be struck down as unconstitutional."  FTFY
Yes, he wishes her well.  Her raping and trafficking children matters not to Trump. I wonder why?
Beginning to think everyone in the Trump cult has a cluster B personality disorder.Trump’s resignation is the only chance GOP has of keeping the WH and the Senate.
Sad for you to assume I’m jaded by opinion pieces when they aren’t in fact opinions but facts. I honestly feel sorry for you Derek, that you actually think Trump is a truthful and innocent man.
Everyone who is part of the  is a Republican but anti-Trump and his Congressional supporters/enablers
The only fraud in the next election is Trump.
#DeathSantis knows trump will lose Florida and the presidency so he’s afraid to alienate more voters by trying to prevent them from voting.  will see more GOP “leaders” throwing him under the bus in coming days.
Trump asks a question and the press short-circuits for an entire day
i am not pro biden.  i am kontra trump.
Fauci, an American physician and immunologist served as Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases since 1984. Do you not believe in science? Do you not believe in what doctors who have dedicated their whole lives to the medical field. Trump doesn’t
Well, we know Trump is!!!
Trump to resign
no, actually not true. i’m a bernie girl. but i’d just rather prevent trump. that is all it is. no emotions. just not trump. i believe we the people are at war with trump and that we only have one shot. and it’s too late for new tactics. for me it’s simple as that. prevent 2016
This feels like the Oct 7th acess Hollywood day when the most catastrophic news warning about russian interference just flew under the radar..Amidst the job no's,Obama speech, trump tweets,no one is paying attention to this    plz sound the alarm bells
I might be misinterpreting it, but I don’t think the fictional patient has COVID; he’s just been in a coma for 3 1/2 years due to a car accident, has woken up, and has no idea what Trump has done. The family is wearing masks to protect him from COVID.
We’re just asking you to stay on course and not let manipulator Trump divert you with his daily (hourly?) shiny object distractions.
You need to click on the tweet and look what he is retweeting. A major Trump supporter switching up
It really is unbelievable how the media portrays this. They want trump out so bad they are willing to lie and have no journalistic integrity what so ever. it really is pathetic.
Steve can blow it out his ear.  I could not care less that suddenly one more ridiculous distraction comment has got his attention.  Trump was a trainwreck, lying, misogynistic, xenophobic, racist con man danger to America from day one.
It is critical that we pray every day morning ,noon, night FYI President Trump to be re-elected 2020. By Gods Grace #prayforPresidetTrump
Don’t tell Trump. He’ll probably try to contest that election too.
Maybe you should ask Mr. Hurd if he regrets voting against the articles of impeachment against Trump.
Trump is very much involved. Very!
"Having a fantastic time," said #HermanCain at the Trump rally without his mask. Thanks to Dr. #DemonSperm, a lot more people will be having a "fantastic time" without masks now, too.
At least you owned up to your shit take about Biden saying Trump would try to delay the election. The bar is never too low for Trump.
Two of my siblings are big Trump supporters. My sis, is posting the crap touted by that crazy minister &amp; then saying their belief in Jesus will save them. My bro, says Covid is a bio weapon sent by the Chinese govt. What the hell happened to us?
A three year old uses way too many words that Trump doesn’t understand.
Mitch McConnell postures to get people to not take Trump so seriously in the short term.
She don’t look black she look orange giving me very much Donald trump✨
A few months ago KUSHNER floated out the notion that TRUMP will cancel November's election.  I have been writing for the past year this Election is in Danger.  #ThinkTheUnimaginable  #Putin2020

Trump Suggests Election Delay, Pompeo Questioned About US Democracy
I’m so sick and tired of trumps tweets and lying. I want to be able to go through a day with nothing about trump. #evictTrump
There’s one. Americans first Trump second.
If COVID is a hoax, if it's just like the flu, if it's all just fearmongering to bring down Trump then you have nothing to worry about-- it can't be a "horrible statement" because COVID won't have an effect on Trumpkin's health
Hillarious that THIS is the breaking point and the face that the Federalist Society is one of the main reasons trump was elected
OMG. Could the  possibly get any smaller or more childish!You have all turned into Trump.
It’s going to be quite the twist at the end of the movie when Billy Bush brings forth the tapes of Trump’s conversations with Putin and saves America
To Trump the average American is expendable, including our children.
Don’t waste your time with these trump supporters
States will certify their election results &amp; Trump will have nothing but conspiracy theories &amp; conjecture.
OMG.  I didn't know.  I have a Trump bling hate a t shirt. Watch and pin. I had a bumper sticker ,Trump one scratched out. Noticed someone keyed my car.  But need new one. Already got screamed at 2 yrs ago about Trump. Sooo risk it or wear the stuff?
Now the whole country’s a ghetto, thanks Trump.
In his eulogy, Obama called MLK the greatest pastor at Ebenezer and said John Lewis was his first disciple. Similarly, Obama seemed to parallel George Wallace as a racist demagogue and suggested Donald Trump is his disciple. Join me and  as we discuss on
Don’t vote the Chinese friend, Biden❗️ We need the Patriot President  Trump❣️
Even the eagle on your header thinks Trump sucks.  Sorry, not sorry.
This is absolutely harrowing. It is just so hard to read. And my brain is on fire knowing that Trump was wishing these people well.
Only an idiot would ever let a narcissistic psychopath ever occupy the highest office in the land without some basic safeguards. Only good thing Trump has done is show how badly we need to properly vet our candidates for POTUS. Can't wait for him behind bars in NY!
Trump supporters love to say “politics don’t define character” or “respect other people’s beliefs” as if supporting a racist, misogynist, and rapist isn’t wrong?? or a violation of basic human rights &amp; decency?? So yes it does define ur character AND your view on women &amp; POC smh
Trump was aptly called "the chaos candidate" but I think he's graduated to "the scorched earth president". Leaves nothing but destruction in his wake....Putin's got his money's worth.
Funny feeling you would not get so indignant about Micheal Cohen. Your guy Brett appears to white knuckling it through every Trump related decision. He thinks it will prevent him from disbarred for lying to Congress twice.
FUCK TRUMP.
When TRUMP comes to New Hampshire.  You going? If he does.  Probably.  I might this time.
I will never change anything I stand for just because I like you. I could fall in love with your personality, friendship etc and still block you the second I find out your a Trump supporter. It’s not about having “different political views”, you’re legit a white supremacist. Yuck
Trump is so bad that you all forget Obama was dropping bombs on whole villages of families in the Middle East
it was an honest mistake. shit happens, you know.   while i appreciate that i didn’t bother you i would like to reject one point only in your introduction: i’m not pro biden - i am contra trump.   big difference.
We can do it now.  See
Not suggesting that if anyone chose not to go public with their stories that they are not telling the truth if they did now, of course (I hope that’s clear). I just would have expected SOMEONE to have brought Trump’s name up with specific accusations by now.
3. Using a foreign government to influence his elections. The dude has commended Putin and Kim Jong for God’s sakes.  4. Using his platform to ridicule the media while they are only exercising their first amendment rights. 5. Trump was literally IMPEACHED for abuse of power.
Trump Might Try to Postpone the Election. That’s Unconstitutional.
I sorta believe this in my gut as well. It doesn’t make sense to me why ANY other victims of Epstein wouldn’t have come forward accusing Trump when many of the others accusing Trump did, or when people started going more public with Epstein accusations.
Got that right!  See
Jim, admit it ... ALL YOUR HEADS BLEW UP. Trump fucks with you all the time, and you ALL fall for it.
The Republican governor from MA responding to President Trump:
How Dare You RUDY!  The teachers in this Country are the backbone of our society. Just because you represent an Imbecile aka TRUMP, DO NOT Disparage the Un-sung Heroes of our Country. 👇
Remember when Trump said "I could stand in the middle of Fifth ave and shoot someone and not lose voters" Well, he's killed over 150 Mill now and not lost voters.
"Postal employees and union officials say the changes implemented by Trump fundraiser-turned-postmaster general Louis DeJoy are contributing to a growing perception that mail delays are the result of a political effort to undermine absentee voting."

Trump still thinks it’s a very nice shark, good people.
Biden.  Leading.  See
Been trying to get back into twitter and unfortunately had to start cleaning up who I'm following. Two things I honestly have no time for:  1. Those that still support Trump (I understand if people may have at one point years ago)  2. Coronavirus denial &amp; conspiracy bullshit
Remember when everyone was hype about Trump being evicted?
This is outrageous! Hold Trump and every Republican who does not denounce this accountable by voting them from office.  Postal Service backlog sparks worries that ballot delivery could be delayed in November

And prepared for Trump’s October Surprise. It’s his only hope, so he’s counting on it.
This is technically Trump’s district, too 🤔🤔
The LP is run, staffed and supported by a bunch of ruthless fothermuckers and America absolutely needs everyone one (1) of them at the top of their Trump-ass-kicking game right now.  Go, LP!
McConnell can’t get the votes for his own relief bill. You think we can get 20 GOP votes to convict Trump?
#trump is right ... We don't like him ... because of his personality ...
Stay at home and produce less babies... #MAGA #winning Trump is the anti-orgasm.
The only thing that was disappointing is that your #tinyhands weren't underneath each and everyone of their knees. Your a small man with a small mind and a small .... BTW, #BunkerBoy Trump just isnt into you.
TRUMP, as usual is preparing us for the Chaos planned for 3 November by his team and PUTIN...
#trump knows nothing ... #trump learns nothing ... #trump does nothing ... 150,000 dead ...
Trump thinks he’s a star. He thinks he’s the best thing since sliced bread.  “Waaaah why do people like Fauci but not meeeee?! Waaaah!”   Because Fauci actually uses science and medical reasoning while Trump employs a secretary of Education that’s never worked a day in a school.
Please, go on.   Then tell me all the ways Trump is different in supporting the military. I’ll wait 😂
Hah. So funny and soooo true. Trump sucks.
NOT TRUMP TRYING TO DELAY THE ELECTION IS THIS REAL LIFE??? HE CANT DO THAT RIGHT
PENNSYLVANIA: uh, no, we’re good.  See

“Where’s Trump’s abuse of power?” Lmfao I can’t 😂😂😂😂 I don’t like Joe or Clinton either.
Jail ,Trump and Barr not surprised I'm sure. Defund the FBI.
Last time I checked ... October 2019 ... The #trump administration owed the United Nations ... $1 billion ... He always has ulterior motives ... This one is again ... to help ... #putin ...
There is ‘Presidential Lack of Leadership 101.’  Dumb Donnie holds a rally and doesn’t wear a mask, do you really think a high ranking member of the Trump Party would wear a mask if the Devine Leader didn’t?
“TRUMP/PENCE: believe it or not, America can be even worse than it is right now so vote for us even though we screwed it up.”  Paid for by the Campaign to Gaslight America.
The pettiness of the Trump family focuses on revenge for not enough praise and/or shifting blame.
I heard Baron's school isn't opening up. Maybe Trump should send his DHS goons to the school to make them reopen?
Trump doesn’t want science to get in the way of reopening the schools.  He doesn’t want CDC guidance to get in the way of opening the schools.  He caused the deaths of tens of thousands of Americans.  Don’t let him kill your kids.  #TrumpHatesScience
If Trump was not President, Herman Cain would not be dead. If Hillary Clinton were president, Herman Cain would have been wearing a mask.
THE AMERICAN PPL SHOULD NOT BE PUNISHED CUS OF TRUMP’S SLOW TOURTOISE RESPONSE TO COVID AND HIS INACTIONS. Anyone who doesn’t agree with this isn’t a true American and u have no idea what the reality is for the majority nor do u care.
You cant even pick a running mate. Youre about as competent as Trump.
Obama compares segregationist Jim Crow America to Trump's America – as it happened
Trump has blood on his hands.
Blocked him regardless tho, I don’t suffer Trump supporters or COVID conspiracy theorists lol.
Trump is that kid you hated playing games with because they always changed the rules so they would maybe win.
As a country, we all need to come together to get Trump out.  Welcome  and thank you for your announcement.
Trump's stance toward Putin undermines diplomacy in ex-Marine's case, says former Amb.

I wouldn't ignore it either Chris. Please watch this quick video. I believe Justin King  is on to something. Trump is not a regular president, he's a wounded fascist. He's showing his hand.
In 2017, Eric Trump’s visit to a Trump building under construction in Uruguay cost taxpayers $97,000.” Last September, the Secret Service also put in a bid to buy Jet Skis, so that federal agents could protect the Trump family off the shore of Mar-a-Lago.
Another murder by tRump
The thing about Trump is that he is extremely evil but also extremely fucking stupid.
Especially critical when it comes to flipping the senate! Even if everything went to hell and Trump got re-elected, a Democratic majority senate would make a world of difference.
For a second there I thought you might address R voter suppression, or McConnell’s refusal to deal with Russian interference, but those are probably “partisan issues” to you.  In the old days we were all Americans.  It took trump to decide those who disagree “hate America”.
Chances are pretty good that he died for a trump hate rally. At least he didn’t have to wear a mask. #TrumpPandemic

In another tweet worth repeating: "Trump having fun with the laser pointer watching the pearl clutchers chase the red dot."
Trump cannot be fighting for an authorized treatment for covid19. FDA authorizes drugs for x with strict instructions. FDA will not authorize laxative for treating malaria.
Jared Kushner and by extension Donald Trump were willing to sacrifice the lives of HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS of Americans just to make Democratic governors look bad.  This is sociopathic.  It is fucking inhuman.
I saw your show tonight. Please don't let up on Trump. Don't get to comfortable with his text walk back

7/30 Trump says he might postpone the election. Anti masker Herman Cain dies from covid, probably infected at Tulsa rally Pelosi, Clinton, Obama speak at John Lewis service. Rep. Lewis’s final letter in NYT Hands down Dem 15 GOP 0
7/29 Anti masker Louis Gohmert tests positive for Covid trying to go to Texas with Trump. DHS says troops are or are ‘t Leaving Portland. No GOP bill Dems did nothing of note, but win by default Dems 14 - GOP 0
Remember when Trump talked "bullshit" and politics at a friggen boy scout jamboree?
He seemed like a great guy. His downfall was trusting in impeached president* trump, who killed him in Tulsa.   #TrumpPandemic
I used to think just mentioning the name Rush Limbaugh would put liberals into orbit. But for the past 4 years the Trump name sends these left-holes seeking Uranis. The Trump derangement syndrome should be listed in the DSM.
Why is trump pushing a legal drug? I don’t see him pushing asprin, Tylenol. They are prescribed for covid19 to reduce pain, right? Why is trump not pushing disinfectants for treating covid19? I am not saying you lack logic skills but anyone would as you equate equador to USA
Barack Obama,   Go home to your multi million Martha's Vineyard home please!  Stay out of politics.  You've never helped the black race by promises promises and then never help them get and stay out of poverty.   Always feeding them lies. Trump 2020!!!
This is Trump’s America 2020 in a nutshell!
I would rather chew glass then sit to this fiasco.
Most of what Trump has done since his first acquittal is grounds for impeachment.   don’t have the courage to act. America, remember the enablers and remove them. Their UN-AMERICAN.
Leave it to this windbag to politicize Herman Cain's death by invoking a Trump rally to allege, without verification, that Cain contracted coronavirus from his presence there. The amorality of some political consultants knows no bounds.
Why because it’s something Trump is doing? I’m assuming it’s a bad thing for the USA to make its own meds here
trump is literally going to do whatever he can to stay in presidency and it’s fucking terrifying
Good, nobody wants to see Trump let alone hear him speak.
Until we elected Trump.  Now we’re a joke.

Trump Storms Out Of Briefing After Reporter Blasts Him For Retweeting 'Alien DNA' Doctor's Claims
Frankly, everyday trump/Putin take out a hammer and saw and attack our constitution.  (“I should be in office for 20 years...” emoluments... foreign interference in 2016, requesting it from Ukraine in 2020 by leveraging approved self-defense weapons...).
Not specifically Trump's administration, but he said for years that a pandemic was the greatest danger to our country and possibly the world. The next outbreak? We're not ready | Bill Gates - YouTube

I’m starting to get the vibe Trump is gonna win. It’s a gut feeling I don’t have hard evidence for it, all these dumbasses planning their victory out in late July just makes me sense it
Wow the fuckin nitwit had a decent idea and Trump fucking ruined it.
FALSE. Having spent my entire career in both State &amp; Federal Law Enforcement, I Can State Unequivocally,  Is The Only Real Supporter of the Rule of Law &amp; supports police. BTW: I have put more people in prison for a fraction of what Impeached TRUMP does on a weekly basis.
It’s going to be interesting what Trump has to say about the #NBA kneeling down during the national anthem.
I'm guessing it's during tRUMP's daily briefings....wait, i thought it said finger PAINTING! Sorry.
Smarter than Trump and will surround himself with decent people
You speak Trump?
The damn finally broke! But I got ask, of all of the crap that’s gone on, children separated from their parents, Russia putting bounties on US soldiers, the handling this pandemic, lives could have been saved. I know there’s more. Why is this the one that trump crossed the line?
it is not your message it’s the Candidate Dump Trump and run Pence/ Baker. You’ll have the GOP never trumps come back. You might lose some Maga idiots but you won’t loss the Senate. If you keep Trump the senate is gone along with White House. #DumpTrump2020
Thank you!  Absentee Ballot = Mail-In voting.  They are synonyms. Someone tell Trump.

As predictable as the sunrise.  As I was watching i knew this was coming.  This was not a campaign speech, this was eulogy honoring the mans lifes work.  To ignore that would have diminished #JohnLewis' life.  #Trump enabler. #JohnLewisFuneral  #JohnLewisRIP  #ObamaEulogy
I have idiots trying to fight with me now about it. How anyone could think Trump is an innocent, caring, loyal, intelligent, and trustworthy man is beyond me
But what does he even do?! This is just starting to get really fucked. His mind is worse then trump’s

The Trump Administration forced meatpacking workers back to plants that are COVID death traps. 1 in 10 meatpacking workers (who are mostly Black, immigrants, or both) had COVID as of last month.
Don't forget a black TRUMP supporter who was a presidential hopeful died as well!
The Trump Adminsitration is trying to slash UI and give corporations sweeping immunity from worker safety laws.   I’m not going to shed a tear for Trump aides that were just fine sending low-wage workers to their deaths till the virus came to their workplace too.
Woke you up? You’re still dreaming! You live in a world where you think Trump is a honest, caring, loyal, and intelligent man.

Dino C. You didn’t address the one question. What is Trump hiding? And Why?  You afraid to open eyes and ears?
Our economy is tanking worse than it ever has under Trump. If you think this is a matter of belief, then you're not actually paying attention to the facts.   Furthermore, the Clintons had nothing to do with what anyone is talking about.
Your ability to disregard what Trump is doing to our country.... ouch. I guess you’re cool w/ Sexual Harassment &amp; Bullying  – White Supremacy, Racism, Homophobia, Transphobia, &amp; Xenophobia  – His idiotic tweets   – His Obstruction of Justice with Russia -Abuse of power
There are those in power who're doing their darndest to discourage people from voting': Obama excoriates Trump and compares him to George Wallace during eulogy to John Lewis and calls for new Voting Rights Act 'to truly honor' civil rights icon

Thanks Democratic party. Ruin America. If trump doesn’t win this country is gonna be shit real fastTrump’s resignation is the only chance GOP has of keeping the WH and the Senate.
Sad for you to assume I’m jaded by opinion pieces when they aren’t in fact opinions but facts. I honestly feel sorry for you Derek, that you actually think Trump is a truthful and innocent man.
Everyone who is part of the  is a Republican but anti-Trump and his Congressional supporters/enablers
The only fraud in the next election is Trump.
#DeathSantis knows trump will lose Florida and the presidency so he’s afraid to alienate more voters by trying to prevent them from voting.  will see more GOP “leaders” throwing him under the bus in coming days.

Fauci, an American physician and immunologist served as Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases since 1984. Do you not believe in science? Do you not believe in what doctors who have dedicated their whole lives to the medical field. Trump doesn’t
Well, we know Trump is!!!
Trump to resign
no, actually not true. i’m a bernie girl. but i’d just rather prevent trump. that is all it is. no emotions. just not trump. i believe we the people are at war with trump and that we only have one shot. and it’s too late for new tactics. for me it’s simple as that. prevent 2016
This feels like the Oct 7th acess Hollywood day when the most catastrophic news warning about russian interference just flew under the radar..Amidst the job no's,Obama speech, trump tweets,no one is paying attention to this    plz sound the alarm bells
I might be misinterpreting it, but I don’t think the fictional patient has COVID; he’s just been in a coma for 3 1/2 years due to a car accident, has woken up, and has no idea what Trump has done. The family is wearing masks to protect him from COVID.
We’re just asking you to stay on course and not let manipulator Trump divert you with his daily (hourly?) shiny object distractions.
You need to click on the tweet and look what he is retweeting. A major Trump supporter switching up
It really is unbelievable how the media portrays this. They want trump out so bad they are willing to lie and have no journalistic integrity what so ever. it really is pathetic.
Steve can blow it out his ear.  I could not care less that suddenly one more ridiculous distraction comment has got his attention.  Trump was a trainwreck, lying, misogynistic, xenophobic, racist con man danger to America from day one.
It is critical that we pray every day morning ,noon, night FYI President Trump to be re-elected 2020. By Gods Grace #prayforPresidetTrump
Don’t tell Trump. He’ll probably try to contest that election too.
Maybe you should ask Mr. Hurd if he regrets voting against the articles of impeachment against Trump.
Trump is very much involved. Very!
"Having a fantastic time," said #HermanCain at the Trump rally without his mask. Thanks to Dr. #DemonSperm, a lot more people will be having a "fantastic time" without masks now, too.
At least you owned up to your shit take about Biden saying Trump would try to delay the election. The bar is never too low for Trump.
Two of my siblings are big Trump supporters. My sis, is posting the crap touted by that crazy minister &amp; then saying their belief in Jesus will save them. My bro, says Covid is a bio weapon sent by the Chinese govt. What the hell happened to us?

If COVID is a hoax, if it's just like the flu, if it's all just fearmongering to bring down Trump then you have nothing to worry about-- it can't be a "horrible statement" because COVID won't have an effect on Trumpkin's health
Hillarious that THIS is the breaking point and the face that the Federalist Society is one of the main reasons trump was elected

It’s going to be quite the twist at the end of the movie when Billy Bush brings forth the tapes of Trump’s conversations with Putin and saves America

Now the whole country’s a ghetto, thanks Trump.
In his eulogy, Obama called MLK the greatest pastor at Ebenezer and said John Lewis was his first disciple. Similarly, Obama seemed to parallel George Wallace as a racist demagogue and suggested Donald Trump is his disciple. Join me and  as we discuss on

Even the eagle on your header thinks Trump sucks.  Sorry, not sorry.
This is absolutely harrowing. It is just so hard to read. And my brain is on fire knowing that Trump was wishing these people well.
Only an idiot would ever let a narcissistic psychopath ever occupy the highest office in the land without some basic safeguards. Only good thing Trump has done is show how badly we need to properly vet our candidates for POTUS. Can't wait for him behind bars in NY!
Trump supporters love to say “politics don’t define character” or “respect other people’s beliefs” as if supporting a racist, misogynist, and rapist isn’t wrong?? or a violation of basic human rights &amp; decency?? So yes it does define ur character AND your view on women &amp; POC smh
Trump was aptly called "the chaos candidate" but I think he's graduated to "the scorched earth president". Leaves nothing but destruction in his wake....Putin's got his money's worth.
Funny feeling you would not get so indignant about Micheal Cohen. Your guy Brett appears to white knuckling it through every Trump related decision. He thinks it will prevent him from disbarred for lying to Congress twice.

Trump is so bad that you all forget Obama was dropping bombs on whole villages of families in the Middle East
it was an honest mistake. shit happens, you know.   while i appreciate that i didn’t bother you i would like to reject one point only in your introduction: i’m not pro biden - i am contra trump.   big difference.
We can do it now.  See
Not suggesting that if anyone chose not to go public with their stories that they are not telling the truth if they did now, of course (I hope that’s clear). I just would have expected SOMEONE to have brought Trump’s name up with specific accusations by now.
3. Using a foreign government to influence his elections. The dude has commended Putin and Kim Jong for God’s sakes.  4. Using his platform to ridicule the media while they are only exercising their first amendment rights. 5. Trump was literally IMPEACHED for abuse of power.
Trump Might Try to Postpone the Election. That’s Unconstitutional.
I sorta believe this in my gut as well. It doesn’t make sense to me why ANY other victims of Epstein wouldn’t have come forward accusing Trump when many of the others accusing Trump did, or when people started going more public with Epstein accusations.

I saw your show tonight. Please don't let up on Trump. Don't get to comfortable with his text walk back

7/30 Trump says he might postpone the election. Anti masker Herman Cain dies from covid, probably infected at Tulsa rally Pelosi, Clinton, Obama speak at John Lewis service. Rep. Lewis’s final letter in NYT Hands down Dem 15 GOP 0
7/29 Anti masker Louis Gohmert tests positive for Covid trying to go to Texas with Trump. DHS says troops are or are ‘t Leaving Portland. No GOP bill Dems did nothing of note, but win by default Dems 14 - GOP 0
Remember when Trump talked "bullshit" and politics at a friggen boy scout jamboree?
He seemed like a great guy. His downfall was trusting in impeached president* trump, who killed him in Tulsa.   #TrumpPandemic
I used to think just mentioning the name Rush Limbaugh would put liberals into orbit. But for the past 4 years the Trump name sends these left-holes seeking Uranis. The Trump derangement syndrome should be listed in the DSM.
Why is trump pushing a legal drug? I don’t see him pushing asprin, Tylenol. They are prescribed for covid19 to reduce pain, right? Why is trump not pushing disinfectants for treating covid19? I am not saying you lack logic skills but anyone would as you equate equador to USA
Barack Obama,   Go home to your multi million Martha's Vineyard home please!  Stay out of politics.  You've never helped the black race by promises promises and then never help them get and stay out of poverty.   Always feeding them lies. Trump 2020!!!
This is Trump’s America 2020 in a nutshell!
I would rather chew glass then sit to this fiasco.
Most of what Trump has done since his first acquittal is grounds for impeachment.   don’t have the courage to act. America, remember the enablers and remove them. Their UN-AMERICAN.
Leave it to this windbag to politicize Herman Cain's death by invoking a Trump rally to allege, without verification, that Cain contracted coronavirus from his presence there. The amorality of some political consultants knows no bounds.
Why because it’s something Trump is doing? I’m assuming it’s a bad thing for the USA to make its own meds here
trump is literally going to do whatever he can to stay in presidency and it’s fucking terrifying
Good, nobody wants to see Trump let alone hear him speak.
Until we elected Trump.  Now we’re a joke.

Consider it illegal now. Why is Trump and this moron pushing a legal drug? Lawyerly question?
Looks like Trump’s approach of making obviously exaggerated claims has reached my local pizza place
She is worth over $90M off of public "service". Would love to see her, Pelosi, et al, investigated with 1% of the vigor as Trump. But we keep playing the game.
Call us when Baron Trump’s school opens.
“Until recently, I had taken as political hyperbole Democrats' assertion President Trump is a fascist. But latest tweet is fascistic &amp; itself grounds for president's immediate impeachment again by House of Representatives &amp; removal from office by Senate”
That made my heart happy. Joe, I know you have some pretty amazing policy ideas but after being beaten up all day by Trump’s rhetoric I just want to feel good again and you do that. We need that. We all need to heal.

Trump Storms Out Of Briefing After Reporter Blasts Him For Retweeting 'Alien DNA' Doctor's Claims
Frankly, everyday trump/Putin take out a hammer and saw and attack our constitution.  (“I should be in office for 20 years...” emoluments... foreign interference in 2016, requesting it from Ukraine in 2020 by leveraging approved self-defense weapons...).
Not specifically Trump's administration, but he said for years that a pandemic was the greatest danger to our country and possibly the world. The next outbreak? We're not ready | Bill Gates - YouTubeTrump’s resignation is the only chance GOP has of keeping the WH and the Senate.
Sad for you to assume I’m jaded by opinion pieces when they aren’t in fact opinions but facts. I honestly feel sorry for you Derek, that you actually think Trump is a truthful and innocent man.
Everyone who is part of the  is a Republican but anti-Trump and his Congressional supporters/enablers
The only fraud in the next election is Trump.
#DeathSantis knows trump will lose Florida and the presidency so he’s afraid to alienate more voters by trying to prevent them from voting.  will see more GOP “leaders” throwing him under the bus in coming days.
Trump asks a question and the press short-circuits for an entire day
i am not pro biden.  i am kontra trump.
Fauci, an American physician and immunologist served as Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases since 1984. Do you not believe in science? Do you not believe in what doctors who have dedicated their whole lives to the medical field. Trump doesn’t
Well, we know Trump is!!!
Trump to resign
no, actually not true. i’m a bernie girl. but i’d just rather prevent trump. that is all it is. no emotions. just not trump. i believe we the people are at war with trump and that we only have one shot. and it’s too late for new tactics. for me it’s simple as that. prevent 2016
This feels like the Oct 7th acess Hollywood day when the most catastrophic news warning about russian interference just flew under the radar..Amidst the job no's,Obama speech, trump tweets,no one is paying attention to this    plz sound the alarm bells
I might be misinterpreting it, but I don’t think the fictional patient has COVID; he’s just been in a coma for 3 1/2 years due to a car accident, has woken up, and has no idea what Trump has done. The family is wearing masks to protect him from COVID.
We’re just asking you to stay on course and not let manipulator Trump divert you with his daily (hourly?) shiny object distractions.
You need to click on the tweet and look what he is retweeting. A major Trump supporter switching up
It really is unbelievable how the media portrays this. They want trump out so bad they are willing to lie and have no journalistic integrity what so ever. it really is pathetic.
Steve can blow it out his ear.  I could not care less that suddenly one more ridiculous distraction comment has got his attention.  Trump was a trainwreck, lying, misogynistic, xenophobic, racist con man danger to America from day one.
It is critical that we pray every day morning ,noon, night FYI President Trump to be re-elected 2020. By Gods Grace #prayforPresidetTrump
Don’t tell Trump. He’ll probably try to contest that election too.
Maybe you should ask Mr. Hurd if he regrets voting against the articles of impeachment against Trump.
Trump is very much involved. Very!
"Having a fantastic time," said #HermanCain at the Trump rally without his mask. Thanks to Dr. #DemonSperm, a lot more people will be having a "fantastic time" without masks now, too.
At least you owned up to your shit take about Biden saying Trump would try to delay the election. The bar is never too low for Trump.
Two of my siblings are big Trump supporters. My sis, is posting the crap touted by that crazy minister &amp; then saying their belief in Jesus will save them. My bro, says Covid is a bio weapon sent by the Chinese govt. What the hell happened to us?
A three year old uses way too many words that Trump doesn’t understand.
Mitch McConnell postures to get people to not take Trump so seriously in the short term.
She don’t look black she look orange giving me very much Donald trump✨

Trump Suggests Election Delay, Pompeo Questioned About US Democracy
I’m so sick and tired of trumps tweets and lying. I want to be able to go through a day with nothing about trump. #evictTrump
There’s one. Americans first Trump second.
If COVID is a hoax, if it's just like the flu, if it's all just fearmongering to bring down Trump then you have nothing to worry about-- it can't be a "horrible statement" because COVID won't have an effect on Trumpkin's health
Hillarious that THIS is the breaking point and the face that the Federalist Society is one of the main reasons trump was elected
OMG. Could the  possibly get any smaller or more childish!You have all turned into Trump.
It’s going to be quite the twist at the end of the movie when Billy Bush brings forth the tapes of Trump’s conversations with Putin and saves America
To Trump the average American is expendable, including our children.
Don’t waste your time with these trump supporters
States will certify their election results &amp; Trump will have nothing but conspiracy theories &amp; conjecture.
OMG.  I didn't know.  I have a Trump bling hate a t shirt. Watch and pin. I had a bumper sticker ,Trump one scratched out. Noticed someone keyed my car.  But need new one. Already got screamed at 2 yrs ago about Trump. Sooo risk it or wear the stuff?
Now the whole country’s a ghetto, thanks Trump.
In his eulogy, Obama called MLK the greatest pastor at Ebenezer and said John Lewis was his first disciple. Similarly, Obama seemed to parallel George Wallace as a racist demagogue and suggested Donald Trump is his disciple. Join me and  as we discuss on
Don’t vote the Chinese friend, Biden❗️ We need the Patriot President  Trump❣️
Even the eagle on your header thinks Trump sucks.  Sorry, not sorry.
This is absolutely harrowing. It is just so hard to read. And my brain is on fire knowing that Trump was wishing these people well.
Only an idiot would ever let a narcissistic psychopath ever occupy the highest office in the land without some basic safeguards. Only good thing Trump has done is show how badly we need to properly vet our candidates for POTUS. Can't wait for him behind bars in NY!
Trump supporters love to say “politics don’t define character” or “respect other people’s beliefs” as if supporting a racist, misogynist, and rapist isn’t wrong?? or a violation of basic human rights &amp; decency?? So yes it does define ur character AND your view on women &amp; POC smh
Trump was aptly called "the chaos candidate" but I think he's graduated to "the scorched earth president". Leaves nothing but destruction in his wake....Putin's got his money's worth.
Funny feeling you would not get so indignant about Micheal Cohen. Your guy Brett appears to white knuckling it through every Trump related decision. He thinks it will prevent him from disbarred for lying to Congress twice.
FUCK TRUMP.
When TRUMP comes to New Hampshire.  You going? If he does.  Probably.  I might this time.
Trump is so bad that you all forget Obama was dropping bombs on whole villages of families in the Middle East
it was an honest mistake. shit happens, you know.   while i appreciate that i didn’t bother you i would like to reject one point only in your introduction: i’m not pro biden - i am contra trump.   big difference.
We can do it now.  See
Not suggesting that if anyone chose not to go public with their stories that they are not telling the truth if they did now, of course (I hope that’s clear). I just would have expected SOMEONE to have brought Trump’s name up with specific accusations by now.
3. Using a foreign government to influence his elections. The dude has commended Putin and Kim Jong for God’s sakes.  4. Using his platform to ridicule the media while they are only exercising their first amendment rights. 5. Trump was literally IMPEACHED for abuse of power.
Trump Might Try to Postpone the Election. That’s Unconstitutional.
I sorta believe this in my gut as well. It doesn’t make sense to me why ANY other victims of Epstein wouldn’t have come forward accusing Trump when many of the others accusing Trump did, or when people started going more public with Epstein accusations.
Got that right!  See
Jim, admit it ... ALL YOUR HEADS BLEW UP. Trump fucks with you all the time, and you ALL fall for it.
The Republican governor from MA responding to President Trump:
How Dare You RUDY!  The teachers in this Country are the backbone of our society. Just because you represent an Imbecile aka TRUMP, DO NOT Disparage the Un-sung Heroes of our Country. 👇
Remember when Trump said "I could stand in the middle of Fifth ave and shoot someone and not lose voters" Well, he's killed over 150 Mill now and not lost voters.
"Postal employees and union officials say the changes implemented by Trump fundraiser-turned-postmaster general Louis DeJoy are contributing to a growing perception that mail delays are the result of a political effort to undermine absentee voting."
President Trump
Trump still thinks it’s a very nice shark, good people.
Biden.  Leading.  See
Been trying to get back into twitter and unfortunately had to start cleaning up who I'm following. Two things I honestly have no time for:  1. Those that still support Trump (I understand if people may have at one point years ago)  2. Coronavirus denial &amp; conspiracy bullshit
Remember when everyone was hype about Trump being evicted?
This is outrageous! Hold Trump and every Republican who does not denounce this accountable by voting them from office.  Postal Service backlog sparks worries that ballot delivery could be delayed in November

This is technically Trump’s district, too 🤔🤔
The LP is run, staffed and supported by a bunch of ruthless fothermuckers and America absolutely needs everyone one (1) of them at the top of their Trump-ass-kicking game right now.  Go, LP!
McConnell can’t get the votes for his own relief bill. You think we can get 20 GOP votes to convict Trump?

The only thing that was disappointing is that your #tinyhands weren't underneath each and everyone of their knees. Your a small man with a small mind and a small .... BTW, #BunkerBoy Trump just isnt into you.
TRUMP, as usual is preparing us for the Chaos planned for 3 November by his team and PUTIN...
#trump knows nothing ... #trump learns nothing ... #trump does nothing ... 150,000 dead ...
Trump thinks he’s a star. He thinks he’s the best thing since sliced bread.  “Waaaah why do people like Fauci but not meeeee?! Waaaah!”   Because Fauci actually uses science and medical reasoning while Trump employs a secretary of Education that’s never worked a day in a school.
Please, go on.   Then tell me all the ways Trump is different in supporting the military. I’ll wait 😂
Hah. So funny and soooo true. Trump sucks.

There is ‘Presidential Lack of Leadership 101.’  Dumb Donnie holds a rally and doesn’t wear a mask, do you really think a high ranking member of the Trump Party would wear a mask if the Devine Leader didn’t?
“TRUMP/PENCE: believe it or not, America can be even worse than it is right now so vote for us even though we screwed it up.”  Paid for by the Campaign to Gaslight America.
The pettiness of the Trump family focuses on revenge for not enough praise and/or shifting blame.
I heard Baron's school isn't opening up. Maybe Trump should send his DHS goons to the school to make them reopen?
Trump doesn’t want science to get in the way of reopening the schools.  He doesn’t want CDC guidance to get in the way of opening the schools.  He caused the deaths of tens of thousands of Americans.  Don’t let him kill your kids.  #TrumpHatesScience
If Trump was not President, Herman Cain would not be dead. If Hillary Clinton were president, Herman Cain would have been wearing a mask.
THE AMERICAN PPL SHOULD NOT BE PUNISHED CUS OF TRUMP’S SLOW TOURTOISE RESPONSE TO COVID AND HIS INACTIONS. Anyone who doesn’t agree with this isn’t a true American and u have no idea what the reality is for the majority nor do u care.
You cant even pick a running mate. Youre about as competent as Trump.
Obama compares segregationist Jim Crow America to Trump's America – as it happened
Trump has blood on his hands.
Blocked him regardless tho, I don’t suffer Trump supporters or COVID conspiracy theorists lol.

4D chess: Trump agrees to Democrats’ national moratorium on evictions, loses election, refuses to move out...BAM, Prez4Life!!!
I wouldn't ignore it either Chris. Please watch this quick video. I believe Justin King  is on to something. Trump is not a regular president, he's a wounded fascist. He's showing his hand.
In 2017, Eric Trump’s visit to a Trump building under construction in Uruguay cost taxpayers $97,000.” Last September, the Secret Service also put in a bid to buy Jet Skis, so that federal agents could protect the Trump family off the shore of Mar-a-Lago.
Another murder by tRump
The thing about Trump is that he is extremely evil but also extremely fucking stupid.
Especially critical when it comes to flipping the senate! Even if everything went to hell and Trump got re-elected, a Democratic majority senate would make a world of difference.
For a second there I thought you might address R voter suppression, or McConnell’s refusal to deal with Russian interference, but those are probably “partisan issues” to you.  In the old days we were all Americans.  It took trump to decide those who disagree “hate America”.
Chances are pretty good that he died for a trump hate rally. At least he didn’t have to wear a mask. #TrumpPandemic
July 30 - part 3 IA - Federalist Society guy says Trump should be impeached DC - McConnell sends Senate home for weekend (it)p’s Thursday) with no relief bill IA - Ghislaine Maxwell documents unsealed

Smarter than Trump and will surround himself with decent people
You speak Trump?
The damn finally broke! But I got ask, of all of the crap that’s gone on, children separated from their parents, Russia putting bounties on US soldiers, the handling this pandemic, lives could have been saved. I know there’s more. Why is this the one that trump crossed the line?

The Trump Administration forced meatpacking workers back to plants that are COVID death traps. 1 in 10 meatpacking workers (who are mostly Black, immigrants, or both) had COVID as of last month.
Don't forget a black TRUMP supporter who was a presidential hopeful died as well!
The Trump Adminsitration is trying to slash UI and give corporations sweeping immunity from worker safety laws.   I’m not going to shed a tear for Trump aides that were just fine sending low-wage workers to their deaths till the virus came to their workplace too.
Woke you up? You’re still dreaming! You live in a world where you think Trump is a honest, caring, loyal, and intelligent man.

Dino C. You didn’t address the one question. What is Trump hiding? And Why?  You afraid to open eyes and ears?
Our economy is tanking worse than it ever has under Trump. If you think this is a matter of belief, then you're not actually paying attention to the facts.   Furthermore, the Clintons had nothing to do with what anyone is talking about.It actually was moved.  Schumer spoke so long the last time, Trump wasn't actually sworn in until a couple minutes after noon.
I just got an email from the Census Bureau.  They claimed that they were sending it to areas with lower than 50% resp. rate.  They are not supposed to have this info.  Further proof that Trump already has our info, &amp; will use it as he wants.  But you Democrats all fell for it.
Nothing would make me happier (except when Trump loses) to see good old condescending Martha take an ass whupping from Mark Kelly.
seeing all those blondes at Trump rallies makes me glad that my hair darkened to brown once I hit puberty
Aww biased data - no wonder.. you think for half a second joe Biden is going to say how great Trump is? 😂 Where do you think there publications get their money from legacy OEMs. If you want to actually understand whats gonna on you'll have to do a way better job..
Trump is every bit as responsible for the death of Cain as obama and clinton were for the deaths of the Benghazi Four after refusing to bolster security for weeks!! Common sense safety ignored in both situations . If that escapes you, your ignorance is willful.
Herman Cain attended the June 20 Tulsa Rally where no one was required to wear masks. He was diagnosed June 29. Hospitalized July 2. Now dead. No one should blame trump for this plague . But the death of Cain, and others at that rally, create a blood trail straight to trump.
We need to get rid of Trump immediately
I’m sure thousands of doctors and researchers are letting people die because they are part of the deep state and “want to hurt trump.” Or maybe there have been conflicting studies . But hey, what do I know. I’m just a journalist that does research .
So Herman Cain threw away the remaining years of his life attempting to ingratiate himself to Trump buy attending a rally without a mask during a pandemic.  I bet he’ll never do that again. 😒  #HermanCain #ShuckyDucky

This guy could hide his own Easter Eggs.    You cannot make this up.   Some how, he’ll blame Trump!   Inexcusable when you’re 100 miles fro LIZZY’s front door.
“Opposition of Trump” my point is that if Trump never took office in 2016 than we wouldn’t need anyone to oppose trump, making 2016 the worst election, Bc it set us up to need “opposition of trump”, which we didn’t need prior to the 2016 election
And also would Biden even be running if he did not feel the pressure from the left to take down Trump?
Yeah but that brings up another argument, would we even be dealing with the pandemic this bad has Trump not taken office.
President Donald Trump dismissed Democratic demands to include aid for cash-strapped cities in a new coronavirus relief package and he lashed out at Republicans, saying they should “go back to school” if they reject money for a new FBI headquarters
President Donald Trump is painting a dystopian portrait of what Joe Biden’s America might look like, asserting crime and chaos would ravage communities should the former vice president win the White House in November.
Kennedy is running an absolutely vile campaign against one of the few progressives we have. It’s Trump style politics. All posturing, and it’s sickening.
Nope, Covid-19 spread is coming down, don’t listen to Fauci &amp; the fake news. Trump, go away, please. Why wait, you’re already Toast.
The Trump administration has started talks with the Oregon governor’s office and indicated that it would begin to draw down the presence of federal agents sent to quell two months of chaotic protests in Portland if the state stepped up its own enforcement
I can prove you wrong on everything you say. You look foolish trying to hate on Trump. It’s as if you’re jealous of him.  And for god sake, leave Sanjay alone! Please leave the poor man alone. He doesn’t really like you that way ‘love you brother’ he said never.
Should President Trump attend Rep. John Lewis’ funeral?
the argument that none of this matters, Trump must be defeated is, if not one I'm ready to buy, at least a valid and coherent one  but look what "Vote Blue No Matter Who" leads to - a DNC that can look at the will of the people and say "they have to vote for us, so fuck 'em"
Jim Jordan is an embarrassment to this country. He should be locked up for not reporting child abuse! Trump is probably protecting him.
Massachusetts. Charlie Baker a Rep Gov, doing a great job.  has not once made it about politics, has not pandered to Trump, made his decisions  on Science, numbers, &amp; what was best for containing  virus. Some in Mass (Reps) think he’s too cautious. The proof is in the results

November 3rd will be the time to say goodbye to trump...
y'all realize that Trump is obsessed with "the boaters" because to him, "owns a boat" is basically synonymous with "rich person, probably Old Money rich," and he cares desperately about their approval because his nouveau riche ass has always longed for their acceptance, right?
Deep-pocketed and often anonymous donors are pouring over $100 million into an intensifying dispute about whether it should be easier to vote by mail, a fight that could determine President Donald Trump's fate in the November election.
It's simple.  Answer anything for Trump, and he will use it for his own sake.  He already has.  But you Democrats all fell for it.

AP-NORC poll: Anxiety props up Biden, Trump voters fervent
Trump’s “Trumpers” are Bankruptcy surrogates that enable the colossal mess befalling The U.S. laying at the foot of THE WORST POTUS IN US HISTORY. “In The Garden of Eden it wasn’t the forbidden fruit on the tree, it was The PAIR on The aground”
I was just thinking about this, and the formulation I've come up with is that leftists reject existing authority (they can still be authoritarian (tankies) but it's the existing authority they fight against), while to a lib, the "appeal to authority" is the unbeatable trump card
Even mother nature told Trump she is sick of his walls.
I'm voting Trump Massachusetts
That monologue was just as damning to Democrats as it is to Trump.
I watched it will shock you and then show you the Trump Adminstration to out another pedo who for years molested children.
My faith in this company ranges over 15 years but is legit shook. I have many a shirt and sent many a donation. But  seemed genuinely hurt. I was shocked to learn that PFT turned down an interview with Biden.  could have done the same with Trump.
ME: *strolling down the sidewalk and sees pro Trump graffiti* Oh my, who is this Trump fellow? Clearly I must vote for him based on this bright red graffiti! Only good things can come from a man with constituents like this!
Obama. Kennedy Eisenhower. Almost all but tRump
A bipartisan group secretly gathered to game out a contested Trump-Biden election. It wasn’t pretty.
... And of course  , you know that sir. There was evidence members of his team were dirty and might be in league with russia. It was imperative to know if a major party nominee or his team were traitors. with Trump’s shady business track record, the odds were good
I’m assuming  , that you’ve been promised a seat on  for your #trump propoganda. Lying is naughty, sir. To be clear, it’s not called “spying” when investigating a suspected criminal. It’s called surveillance. The  had good reason to be concerned ...
Trump is the GOAT
Me too, I've read it going back to around 2009.  Its not simply him getting mad at Trump that bothers me, but that he started giving the looney left a pass.

National poll - new 5 factor model predicts Donald Trump victory - Joe Biden gaining  . . #Trump2020  #Biden2020
Nothing interesting or entertaining about trump lying about events he never attended and things that never happened and Portnoy licking the boots of his idol. But it’s all good. They can enjoy their wealth and fame now. They will pay an eternal price .
I don’t hide that I’m a conservative . I don’t hide that I’m a born again evangelical Christian. And I have never hidden my disdain for both Portnoy and trump. They are both greedy liars who treat women as meat to be used and discarded like garbage. Nothing entertaining.
Go campaign for Trump somewhere else, transphobe
"This is what Democracy looks like' Also, this is what trump has created by trying to divide America. trumpublicans must lose across the board this November, or we have no country.
Trump is out right racist and this proves it It it’s true

The dems or rhinos dont care about you and hard working Americans. To them you are collateral damage in there efforts to take out President Trump. This has made me so disgusted with Washington elites, the media, dems, rhinos. I will never vote for a democrat ever.
Totally agree. Laura I support President Trump however the GOP are whimps no back bone to fight for there principals. Always afraid the dems and media will lie about them and call them names. Newsflash they'll do it anyways. Just once I wish they would just grow a pair.
You are so pro Trump it really shows with your words you spit out trying to stir up race fights. What is your problem?

A judge ordered the release from prison of President Donald Trump’s former personal lawyer on Thursday, saying he believes the government retaliated against him for planning to release a book about Trump before November’s election.
I wonder if Trumpy actually mandates masks, and the “never maskers”  start protesting with AR15 at Various State houses if Trump will use his goons to arrest them. I think not
Trump 2020. Nancy needs to go into retirement with her stupid remarks.
Obama blasts Trump, praises Biden in new 2020 campaign video
Based on Trump’s previous reaction to the Portland mayor &amp; Oregon governor, I would assume he’d not care or go so far as be happy they were harmed or worse.
The mayor of Portland, Oregon, was tear gassed by the U.S. government late Wednesday as he stood at a fence guarding a federal courthouse during another night of protest against the presence of federal agents sent by President Donald Trump
Worst case scenario:   Feds provoke a reaction and are confronted with overwhelming violence in cities and election takes place in war zone. Trump remains in power.   Given that scenario, what is the probability of a coup occurring in the US?   Is this on the board in Vegas?
I can’t sit at the bar at my favorite breweries because of trump.
This actually is Donald Trump’s America. This video was taken yesterday.
I bet trump won’t send a “surge” of troops to Boston. We kinda have a history if chasing troops out.
Did your parents or teachers never explain how to make an apology. You state what you did. You show remorse. You ask how you can make things right.   You seem to have forgotten all of those things. Remorse, empathy and redress are not the way of Trump, or you.
So if you believe this doctored headline and story are true (they’re not) you must believe trump and his team are morons for putting him in charge .
President Donald Trump and Attorney General William Barr are expected to announce Wednesday that federal agents will surge into several American cities including Chicago to help combat rising crime

The Trump administration is detaining immigrant children as young as 1 in hotels, sometimes for weeks, before deporting them to their home countries under policies that have effectively shut down the nation’s asylum system during the coronavirus pandemic
Trump has been on both sides of the states’ rights argument To battle the coronavirus, he’s told states they’re largely on their own. But when it comes to stamping out protests in cities led by Democrats, Trump is sending in federal troops and agents
I think that Dana is too smart to be a Trump supporter......it’s a job and she hide her disgust very well
The Trump administration is facing growing pushback — in the courts and on the streets — to sending federal agents to Portland, Oregon, where protests have spiraled into violence, and vowing to do the same in other Democratic-led cities.
I won’t watch him either today I switch to Grey’s Anatomy as soon as he came on. When he shows up on a news clip I hit the mute button Trump is no less A virus himself then is COVID-19If and when Trump loses, can we insist that Ivanka, Eric, JNR, and Melania bugger off somewhere and not be seen for a while. we need a well earned break from these pilocks!
"Having a fantastic time," said #HermanCain at the Trump rally without his mask. Thanks to Dr. #DemonSperm, a lot more people will be having a "fantastic time" without masks now, too.

In his eulogy, Obama called MLK the greatest pastor at Ebenezer and said John Lewis was his first disciple. Similarly, Obama seemed to parallel George Wallace as a racist demagogue and suggested Donald Trump is his disciple. Join me and  as we discuss on
Funny feeling you would not get so indignant about Micheal Cohen. Your guy Brett appears to white knuckling it through every Trump related decision. He thinks it will prevent him from disbarred for lying to Congress twice.

Why Trump’s Protest Crackdown Keeps Blowing Up in His Face
If Trump resigns pence can give him a pardon
NOT TRUMP TRYING TO DELAY THE ELECTION IS THIS REAL LIFE??? HE CANT DO THAT RIGHT
nope. just not having access to universal healthcare, nothing being done about systematic racism, zero accountability on wall street, and the same cast of ghouls running things.   the only thing you have to offer as better than trump is not tweeting. whoopty fucking doo
THE AMERICAN PPL SHOULD NOT BE PUNISHED CUS OF TRUMP’S SLOW TOURTOISE RESPONSE TO COVID AND HIS INACTIONS. Anyone who doesn’t agree with this isn’t a true American and u have no idea what the reality is for the majority nor do u care.
Probably the same logic trump uses everyday when he applied his orange coating on in the morning.

Stop drinking Trump’s Kool -Aid. You embarrassed yourself on Cuomo. ... how sad !!
Jared Kushner and by extension Donald Trump were willing to sacrifice the lives of HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS of Americans just to make Democratic governors look bad.  This is sociopathic.  It is fucking inhuman.
She is worth over $90M off of public "service". Would love to see her, Pelosi, et al, investigated with 1% of the vigor as Trump. But we keep playing the game.
FALSE. Having spent my entire career in both State &amp; Federal Law Enforcement, I Can State Unequivocally,  Is The Only Real Supporter of the Rule of Law &amp; supports police. BTW: I have put more people in prison for a fraction of what Impeached TRUMP does on a weekly basis.

I'm sure this is not a pleasing thing to hear, much less a pleasing thing to say, but... IMO, it means the powerful and the elites have more in common with each other than they have differences. In a few years, Trump will be among them.

What does Trump have to do with Trudeau wearing blackface every now and again like a tuxedo?
Been pretty lucky with my covid interactions to date but did get "What is this a hospital? This is why Trump is going to win!" because we require people to use hand sanitizer that we give them for free.
Trump Voted absentee in NY in 2018 and in FL March primary, despite being in the area and driving past early voting locations.He also listed the wrong birth date on a 2017 absentee ballot for New York mayor and tried to register to vote in FL in 2019 with an out-of-state address.
part of trump’s executive PACT order had some subtle phrasing on expanded surveillance which seemed to overstep what fisa even allowed
Can you imagine if Trump was President during WWII? How many different ways would he have screwed up? No doubt he would’ve been jealous of famous generals like Eisenhower and MacArthur. He would’ve pushed them out and replaced them with incompetent toadies.
I looked it up. Looks like Melania put the wrong birthdate. Ha!
Our ongoing and unnecessary national tragedy is not a matter that will be settled or fixed with an intemperate tweetstorm. But bygones will not be bygones when Trump leaves the stage.
Donald Trump is responsible for American lives lost to COVID-19.  Republicans  are responsible for not removing him when impeached.
Not out to get conservatives at all. Just blocking vapid trump sycophants from spreading dangerous disinformation. They have right to do so. Just as publishers don't have to publish garbage and restaurants can turn people away.   I thought you people were all for privatization.
According to #Trump, after 4 years of #MAGA, the country still isn't sophisticated enough to have voting by snail mail.  Why is that exactly
Monarch butterflies may be gone in thirty years. Saving them seems apolitical, but environmentalists have faced death threats and more from drug cartels, illegal loggers, Trump supporters, and even clandestine avocado farmers.
Remember that time Trump wanted to invite the Taliban to Camp David?
I've got no objection to parental support. Comes in all forms.   But, the pro-Jake Super PAC includes million-dollar Trump supporter -- Bob Kraft -- as a supporter.  Do the math.
Oh stop lying.  No one in the US DQs the candidates for not supporting the 'patriot act', thinking California should be a country, or disagreeing with 2nd amendment.    And there's no sedition of any of these HK candidates.  Just stop lying like trump 🤣
I am tired of the  and  of saying Trump’s statements are “false”. Call them what they are: LIES. He lies. Often, and repeatedly. It’s what he does. Call a spade a spade. Quit with the weird deference to a monstrous man.
Cause it's safer in Mexico with the Trump virus in America
Oh it's bigger than that. That's like only focusing on Trump. Bad? Sure. But the fetish lets people absolve themselves of inaction at best. Lots else is wrong here. See my earlier post about our school committee. Or look at the state of journalism here. Look at towns around us.
Yes. Trump supporters should take hydroxy, just like supporter  #MAGA
Please go tell that to Mr. Trump.  At least AOC's tweets make sense.
He voted for Trump and opposed impeachment. Now, he calls the president a fascist for suggesting the election be postponed, and suggests that Trump be impeached again.
Like Trump has a chance in CA or NY.
For better or worse, I've posted my own take on President Trump's tweet this morning about mail voting. Bottom line:  Escherian logic is a distraction.  Get back to work.
What do you expect from someone with ties to Epstein and Trump? I'm a dumb white plebe and this was also my reaction:
Though Trump’s idea is ludicrous, it speaks to our deepest fears as Americans. Let’s reform our elections &amp; protect our democracy. #mapoli #ma04 5/5
Today Trump “floated” the idea that we might need to postpone the November election. No matter how ridiculous and illegal it may be, we have to be prepared.  As the only candidate in this race who has sued the Trump Administration over 50 times, here’s what we need to do: 1/5
I thought the same. Can’t help thinking this is conservatives recognizing that Trump is going down in flames and trying to force him out of the election.
Uh oh!
This quote from the cofounder of the Federalist Society will go down as a marker in the Trump era.
Fairly certain that burning the flag would not be something Trump supporters would do in masse. Just a wild guess
Trump said we are the laughingstock of the world I think he is the laughingstock world feels  sorry for us and 152,000 dead because of trump
Trump is standing up telling lie after lie when he ever put the country before himself no
please declare a cease and desist for Trump using your song. It’s too good to be tarnished, especially considering its meaning.
Trump loves walls so much this is a beautiful thing to watch as they are closing in. Can I help pay for it?
I have never seen so many hateful people as I saw when Democrats blame President Trump for coronavirus, violent protests, and even the bad weather!  It’s the usual Finger Pointing Democrats’ SLANDER STRATEGY for which they’re famous!
You must have dementia, considering your statement. Have you heard any statements Trump has made in the last few months?
It's going to be even worse now that there's a friend of the WH in the top spot, too.
trump wants to delay election because of covid-19, yet it's fine to hold rallies and open schools.
Everyone follows Dr. Fauci's advice tRUMP and his cronies voted out by a disgraceful landslide tacos
They certainly aren’t Trump supporters you imbecile. And there’s plenty of new ones with all the Biden-voters trying to burn down buildings, assaulting police, and beating people on streets.
How does #Trump not watch  and think:   "Ohhhhhhh.  Right. I get it now. Im really not even close to being qualified for this position. I will never be a leader like Obama. I resign effective immediately."
Trump wants the protests to turn violent.  Don’t give him what he wants.
What happens if Trump supporters boycott the rigged election? Anything besides a blue wave and greater political division?
Maybe I was wrong that Trump tweeting about delaying the election was mostly meant as a distraction from 150K Covid dead and 32.9% decrease in GDP.  Maybe Orange Julius really means he wants to delay the election.  SMH.
Shorter Trump: I’ll retroactively postpone the election.
Donald J. Trump murdered Herman Cain. Everything he touches dies. ☠️  #HermanCainRIP #HermanCain
Hey #MAGA cunts, be sure not to send a mail in ballot to vote for #Trump since it's so rife with fraud. Do the right thing morons.
Annnnnddddd it starts 🙄🙄🙄 these trump supporters and their conspiracies 🙄🙄🙄... i mean... maybe God don’t like ugly 👀👀👀. In all seriousness. COVID IS REAL! It does not pick and choose ppl. The guidelines he chose to ignore were to protect him. He ignored them 🤷🏽‍♀️🤷🏽‍♀️
Trump, possibly the dumbest person alive, tonight at his press conference:  "Young people are almost immune to [#COVID19]".
At the beginning of 2020, I made a big bingo card with like 20 different things I thought trump would do during the year. It was all crossed off by the 2nd week of April
Trump just threatened using military force against his own citizens.
Jeez this bootlicker is still covering for Trump. I thought he resigned over the Nazi stuff.
I’m shocked - these people actually DO have a line that Trump can cross that will make them want to impeach!
How many Americans have died thus far from the coronavirus? How many more Americans are going to die because the Republican Party is going to sit back on their ass and let Trump not give a shit! We are a joke to the world because  are wimps! We need leadership!
I doubt this would be the endgame Trump has in mind 🤔 But it would be kinda funny.
why is Trump saying that the Democrats should work with Republicans when the Republicans wants to reduce the PUA from $600 to $200 while millions are unemployed!!
Why is . broadcasting a Trump campaign speech?
Trump gave a eulogy today after all
Listen to #Trump at his press conference. He is entirely defeated. Sounds like he is drunk and reading a Hooters menu out loud to his table.  So low energy. So incompetent. So dumb. So done!  #TrumpIsNotWell
"I had taken as political hyperbole the Democrats’ assertion that President Trump is a fascist. But this latest tweet is fascistic and is itself grounds for the president’s immediate impeachment again" and BLABLABLA.   Too little, too late. #ETTD
To paraphrase President Andrew Shepherd, the United States of America is way out of Donald Trump’s league...
Sent in my #VoteByMail ballot application today! Trump can pry my vote from my cold dead hands
Anyone ask Trump whether he has any responsibility for Cain’s death?
Trump.
So when are are you going to tell President Trump this? He has spent a lot of his time retweeting a number of inaccurate, racist or downright bizarre tweets.
Trump's really just mailing it in now
Maybe, but he's also not using the official POTUS Twitter account that has public records &amp; security requirements. Team could be "foldering" tweets in Trump's personal Twitter account for him to send, or sending them on his behalf. It's a great way to prop up a doddering Don.
"Donald Trump is terrified."  Aren't we all. Trmp is a terrfyingly terrified terrorist.
Vote by mail in MA. Already submitted my mail-in ballot request and will vote in the Dem primary and GE.  gets my vote and it’s likely the only one that might make a difference. Trump loses MA 70-30. #Joe2020
May 25: The day the House passed the HEROES Act. Since then, clueless Trump and feckless Republicans in the Senate have done nothing. And since then 60,000 Americans have died. #thecantbebotheredtoprotectusparty
Yeah not really. He tweeted about this guy cause cancel culture was going after him for flying a trump flag.
No it’s cool because you can’t associate the cart with Trump. At least not yet
Alas the article continues "I find myself recognizing this culture in the U.S. now, when, for example, I read a report in the Times on how the Trump Administration convinced itself, back in April, that the covid-19 pandemic was on the wane."
Nope.  Our knowledge of the virus has evolved over time.  That’s not the problem.  The problem has been different members of the Trump administration giving totally contradictory messages at the same time.  Just agreeing with your meme that the administration sucks at this.
The most amazing picture of trump I’ve ever seen 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 #AlienDNA
Evil. Shameless. Damaging. Incompetent. Hypocrites: The Trump Administration is a Study In Contrasts. In my essay I will... [Term papers of the future]
REQUEST AND SUBMIT YOUR BALLOT AS SOON AS YOU CAN. Trump is tying USPS’s hands so millions of votes aren’t counted
unclear to me why "postpone the election" inspired the Federalist Society co-chair to run and get an NYT op-ed published within 8 hours demanding impeachment, but I guess all cult rejection stories are their own story
He’s worked for Trump for three and half years. Shame that in all that time Trump hasn’t been able to put together a team capable of constant messaging
The crisis in our country is created by Antifa terrorist group support by Democrats ...!  Why is President Trump faults ????
But continue to S Trump’s D on every other issue.
#TrumpIsNotWell  Can someone tell me why Trump is tweeting about a f&amp;% king PIZZA joint?  Pandemic in US JohnLewis’s Memorial  Unemployment $$ is running out Trump has to be impeached !
Herman Cain attended Trump's Tulsa rally without a mask as his token black friend, then DIED of COVID-19. This is the sickest of jokes. #WearAMask  #PEAK2020
True.  It’s crazy how inconsistent the Trump administration’s messaging has been in the midst of a pandemic
trump is like the kid who throws his video game controller through the tv screen because "the game cheated"
here's a source, tailored for the trump supporter over there
The Senate map in 2022 for Dems isn't anywhere remotely as favorable as the map in 2018 was for Republicans, where Dems had to defend 25 seats -- 5 in states Trump won by 15+ -- and Republicans had to defend just 8 seats -- only one who represented a barely HRC state.
96 days, motherf*cker. 96 days. The stench of Trump sweat wafting over Twitter more and more with each passing day.
Trump killed Herman Cain
Sat down with  to debrief last night's #MA04Debate and the clear differences in this race. I'm the proven progressive candidate who's ready to lead on our values and take on Donald Trump. #mapoli #ma04
I have explained so many times how this makes us complicit in their facist attitudes and I am told we must talk to them and explore differences. Bitch the difference is I know how to care about people. Now we are gonna die of corona BC dad vacationed with the trump supporters
The Trump/ war on Medicare, Social Security, the ACA, and especially Medicaid cruelly harms 1.75 MILLION vets: “veterans who require intensive care for conditions like traumatic brain injuries..are at particular risk if the program is cut.“
Though I wouldn't put it past Trump to try to delay election, I wonder if today's trial balloon tweet about election postponement was mostly an intentional distraction.  We're all talking about his tweet instead of about the disastrous economic news.
150,000 dead Americans, 40 million unemployed, we’ve abandoned our allies, sold out to dictators, trump and friends gave the Saudis nuclear tech, they abandoned the Paris climate accord..hell, first thing on the chopping block was meals on wheels, not to mention all those Nazis
Universal mail-in voting is what we need for our upcoming election cycle. Delaying the election only delays the people’s voice. Putting #PeopleBeforePolitics means ensuring a safe voting process that allows everyone to vote safely.    #ma04 #mapoli
Hi how do I convince my family we have to stop being friends with a COP AND HIS RACIST FAMILY they fled to MI bc they needed to “escape anti-cop propaganda” to their trump loving vacation town and now my dad is going on VACATION THERE?! In a PANDEMIC?? FoR: we are currently in CA
Typhoid Trump killed him.
Typhoid Trump killed him.
It's not very funny to have to explain jokes. The situation is inherently funny for anyone familiar so simply explaining the situation would be boring and hacky. Tying the fact that he contracted the virus while stumping for Trump back to his failed 2012 run is the unique aspect
May 25: The day the House passed the HEROES Act. Since then, clueless Trump and feckless republicans in the Senate have done nothing. Since then 60,000 Americans have died. #thecantbebotheredtoprotectusparty
The Hoover- economy is a disaster. People are hurting.  We must pass the #HEROESAct, Emergency Wage Support and the   #CORPSAct Now.  Please call  and tell him to move these important bills forward now.
Trump is a horrible human being, that is all.
Keep in mind that the dis-information sock puppets have been spun up again for the summer and fall. If it is unbelievable, either Trump did it, or it's not real.
Aaah...so when Trump is out of office for sure. 🤔
Lady G, you’re so screwed even if you hold onto your seat.  Senate minority more losses in the House and the Trump loss will lead to major investigations and we all know you’re compromised. PS Flynn said under oath he was guilty.
Monarch butterflies may be gone in thirty years. Saving them seems apolitical, but environmentalists have landed in the sights of drug cartels, illegal loggers, Trump supporters, and even clandestine avocado farmers.
These are the faces &amp; stories of a true POTUS - one who thought of Americans first &amp; put the needs of others before himself. It’s a face of #truth #integrity #strength #CadetBoneSpurs Trump is a #failure. Time for #TrumpResignNow  #Enoughfailure
Shame on USA today -- calling Trump's illegal provocation of protesters "crime fighting".  Call it what it is: tax dollars deployed for political gain, just like sending the army to the border in 2018.  Political theater.
“CNN's Dana Bash: You said in 2014 that Obama showed ‘failed leadership’ with Ebola, when only 2 Americans died. Would you say Trump's showed failed leadership with coronavirus as 130,000 Americans have died? Sen. Joni Ernst: ‘No, I think that the president is stepping forward’”
&amp;  If any of you #fools had shown an ounce of competence we wldn’t be in this situation. Over 150K dead - including Herman Cain who went to Trump’s #moronic Tulsa rally. The world is closed &amp; Americans r dying. The #failure is catastrophic.
Ohhhhhhhh I didn't know PRESIDENT TRUMP WAS THERE??? AWESOME!!!
Thanks to the Trump/ trade/tariff debacle, we’ve paid farmers $16? 12? 28 BILLION, borrowed from China,  for not selling crops to China. And now poor, weak Joni Ernst won’t comment on Trump’s threat to delay the election. “Not answering any questions,” said Ernst
Trump can’t carry Obama’s bags. He can’t lift, anyway.
Hey Ms Lindsey, please just STFU and let the grown ups talk. That "abuse" came from Trumps DOJ. Flynn pleaded guilty twice. Trump fired him within the first 20 days. A corrupt AG comes in and all of a sudden Flynn case gets dropped?🤔
There is no long-term logic to Trump's plan that Does Trump any good at all.  But it does help out our enemies.
The election is run by the state governments.  Trump can't stop them holding it; and they have a legal duty to do it regardless of any federal executive action.
😃Thanks, Glynn! Hey - ppl may not know it, but when Trump leaves office there will still be a security industry here that operates like the one that operated on the Pine Ridge Reservation in the ‘70s &amp; everywhere else since the ‘50s. Political Prisoner
I’m not sure - in what way is Will responsible? Trump isn’t really a product of the traditional Rep Party.
It is surprising how little journalist talk about it. It seems they hoped it would just go away. Also surprised we never heard anything more about Epstein's suicide. How could all the prison cameras have broken on the same day? Think Trump is covering it up?
Here’s my audition to host the late night show:   “Trump did something stupid again”  *uproarious laughter*
Trump had a lot of help in his wrecking mission from Republican Senators.
Trump's people are telling us they are planning a takeover. The issue is, who can stop this? People have to stop being surprised at this behavior and plan for it.
Basically the map Parscale and Trump dreamed of and could never achieve
11.  Challenge the validity of only blue state elections.  This could create a Republican majority House (due to empty Dem seats), and they could then elect Trump as Speaker of the House.  Absent a valid Presidential election (due to missing states), Trump becomes President.
Everything is political for progressives. John Lewis' funeral is mostly an occasion to attack Republicans. Herman Cain's death an occasion for snarky "serves him rights" and a denunciation of Trump's Covid-19 policies.
US Ambassador to the Netherlands mourns invading Nazis in his plea for peace.   We need to vote Trump and his fascist minions out.
It seems that option 3.a. (the scary path to Trump staying President), is not actually possible, because Grassley would no longer be in line to be President.
As well as the opportunities to manipulate for his personal benefit. Force transparency now, do not wait! When Trump does leave the WH, someone better check the silverware!
Unless Trump resigns in December he’s president until January 20th
Aside from not legally being able to do it, Trump would have a very hard time “delaying” the election.  Ballots are going out in SEPTEMBER in some states.  Once those are in the election has already began.
Even Rubio and Moscow Mitch. The media should give Trump's stupid tweets less and less play.
Please advise why President Trump said that he wished an accused sex trafficker well during a press briefing? This is no joke.While there are significant actions against world sex trafficking,our current President says that? It does not inspire confidence in his administration
I agree with the diagnosis. I also think it’s vital that the Greens campaign hard for Presidential votes in non-swing states, but not further endanger the world with Trump. As a green supporter, I believe it’s vital for all Greens in swing states to hold their noses and vote Dem.
“Trump’s appeals to the suburbs won’t work as well as Nixon’s because ... Nixon already succeeded too well.”
First name on your charging document: Trump -discarded the Obama pandemic playbook in Jan ‘17 -dissolved the NSC pandemic defense office in May ‘18 -eliminated the post for the American in Beijing tasked with detecting pandemic in ‘19 -ignored multiple urgent mentions in his PDB
I'm sure she would know that President Trump never learned a lesson.
For those wondering about this whole "Trump wants to delay the election" thing:  1. He can't. Congress has the power to do this, not the President. 2. Congress won't. There is literally no reason to. 3. Trump's term ends at noon on January 20 whether there is an election or not.
It's always been about him. No empathy, sympathy, nothing. #Biden2020 Like Father, Like Son: President Trump Lets Others Mourn
So sad that Herman Cain didn't take Covid seriously and trusted Trump.
The Chicago Marathon a year before the last election featured a run past the Chicago Trump building. It was amusing to watch how many of us stopped to express ourselves with our digits as we ran past. Sign of what was to come in the years since
I think his wife's pro trump stance really hurts him in this situation
Don’t even think about. It’s time for this damn #fool to go. The US can’t take another day with Trump as potus. #TrumpResignNow #RussianBounty #TrumpFailure
President Trump floats delaying the election and you’re spending airtime interviewing a candidate for Senate? Are you kidding me?
This isn’t a normal election. Normally, there are those of us who are rampant liberals and those who disagree, but we meet in the middle. With Trump, there is no middle. He is fundamentally bad for this country and must be defeated. I’ll be phone banking and doing whatever I can!
The scared to lose Trump.
Pay attention
my own obi included, but certainly i'm referring to trump's
Trump works to destroy our imperfect union. We need leaders who will work to perfect it!
I’ve a suggestion for Trump supporters who want to unlawfully delay the election: you can always skip voting
I’m getting a lot of dejected responses to this one, mostly about how Trump has gutted the Post Office. I get it, I do. It’s easy to get down because everything is a dumpster fire right now. But let’s not throw up our hands and assume that they’ve already won, okay? Take. Action.
That is tragic news. Perhaps President Trump will finally understand his political gamesmanship in how he deals with the Coronavirus is not just inadequate for America but also dangerous for all Americans in violation of his oath to protect the citizenry.
If elections aren't valid, then Trump doesn't get to stay on as President.  Pelosi becomes President.
“The vote is the most powerful nonviolent change agent you have in a democratic society. You must use it because it is not guaranteed. You can lose it.” -John Lewis in his last letter. (See NYT 7.30.20) We must make “good trouble” and not let Trump interfere!
It’s breathtaking to see the diversity in that crowd. The massive tent that is the Trump movement...
Enticing, but unfortunately it is claimed and governed by the Marshall Islands. We'd need its government's permission to settle Trump there, and frankly I doubt the Marshallese want anymore of America's radioactive garbage then they've already recieved.
This is where you're lost.  On January 20th, if we have non valid election result, we do have a line of succession.  Trump is no longer President.  Nancy Pelosi is.  And the military will side with Pelosi.  So will the courts, and so will the deep state.
Look, if Trump’s followers want to believe that he can delay the election, that’s fine by me—they don’t have to vote. I’ll be mailing in my ballot by November 3rd.
Nice cut and paste. It’s clear you didn’t write this. Too coherent and too many big words. What will you be doing after Jan 2021?  Fox gig or OAN... maybe Trump TV?  You won’t be desecrating the WH anymore for sure.
Nothing wrong in anything Seth and other people are saying.  But they're all forgetting that Trump's term ends on January 20th.  Regardless of political maneuvering and courts, the U.S. military will not recognize Trump as commander-in-chief.  This carries massive weight.
Obama deliver eulogy  funeral &amp; can’t stop crying. #JohnLewis’ death=huge loss. &amp; SO miss Obama. Proud on day Obama inaugurated. PROUD. Then we allow Trump / Putin to take a brilliant woman away from US, rig 2016, install a racist &amp; a moron #ShameOnUs  #Biden2020
He died doing what he loved being another Trump stooge. #TrumpVirus #TrumpStooge
Trump’s a disgrace! Surely, even the sycophants have enough residual brains to acknowledge the truth of Trump’s psychopathology!
If Trump is not President, he's not the only one at risk.  There's a chance that prison is the destination of a lot of his closest advisors, and this will weigh on their minds and on the advice they give Trump.
I left Facebook amd Instagram early in Trump’s presidency and assume most of my contacts have forgotten about me. Just can’t enrich Zuck &amp; Trump as they torch the country &amp; planet.
To be fair though I have suggested in the past one absolutely crazy scenario that keeps Trump in the Presidency without valid election results.
A Judge Blocked The Administration’s Public Charge" Policy On Immigrants During The Pandemic #GoodNews #SupportSurvivors
Trump may well be a complete moron.  I don't even care about the moron vs. evil genius theories now.  But he is without a doubt surrounded with a handful of evil geniuses.  None of them (except Putin and Bannon) would argue in favor of this move.
At every point in Trump's presidency, I've been able to see some end game(s), however unlikely, that lets Trump preserve his power.  I just don't see one here, and that's very troubling to me.
I'm just confused about what this buys Trump.  He's going to be gone.  On the other hand, the ensuing chaos will be a big win for Putin.
Let us know- in my town a trump sign might get my house egged it worse 🙄
And yes, Trump can use his broad emergency powers to screw up elections royally and probably delay them, or at least get his supporting states to delay them, and create a giant-assed mess.  But since he NEEDS a valid election to stay in office, I don't see the point.
Absent a valid election result that shows Trump winning, his term ends on January 20th, regardless of elections.  After that date, anyone still pretending he is President would be explicitly violating their oath to the Constitution.  You were in the military.  How will that go?
Stating the obvious is not politicization.   Here's politicization: Trump &amp; political figures who dangerously spread misinformation about the virus and ignore public health safety measures are responsible for the deaths of 150K+ Americans, including members of their party.
My favorite theory on how Trump could guarantee himself an election result would be that he could buy out or blackmail electors in the electoral college post election, and get them to cast their vote for him instead of their intended recipient.  But how does less time help that?
It really isn't clear to me what a delay buys Trump.  Maybe one could argue that with a shorter period between election and inauguration, it's easier for Trump to ram something bogus through the courts?  But I don't think that really pans out.
Or to put it another way, Trump NEEDS a valid election result — that shows him winning — in order to remain President after January 20th.
Is Trump going to give a white supremacist speech during John Lewis’ memorial?
It is hard to have sympathy for a man who died of COVID after telling his 500K followers that he's "fed up" wearing masks at public events. (He got COVID at Trump's Tulsa rally). Hopefully his death will inspire more GOPers to take it seriously.
Once again the  defense of Trump is that nobody should take the President seriously.  does not joke.
⁦ breaks it down.
Trump can't figure out how to vote in person, then takes a provisional ballot, mistakenly calls it a mail in vote. Trump doesn't even know what a mail in ballot is, thinks it's somehow different than absentee! He's so uninformed that he doesn't even know what he's against!
Herman Cain went to the Trump rally in Tulsa he did not wear a mask his death falls directly on Donald Trump his blood is on trumps hands
Imagine being  pretending Donald Trump is literally suggesting we upend our democracy as a joke, and then defending that joke.  The door is that way, Cornyn, you'll be getting kicked out of it very shortly.
Biden called Trump the “first” racist to be elected president. That’s not just ahistorical, it’s a statement that should be disqualifying for a leader of the Democratic party. My latest:
He died because he listen to trump did not wear a mask and expose himself to the Covid He’s just is on your hands And trumps
It’s hard to discount to zero the possibility trump’s mix of idleness &amp; unequaled ineptitudes re: COVID have been intentional in order to delay the election &amp; whatever justice awaits him.
Reminder:  While Trump does not have explicit power to delay elections (which are state run), his emergency powers may still effectively let him do it.  BUT HIS TERM OF OFFICE ENDS ON JANUARY 20TH NO MATTER WHAT.  Absent a valid election result, Nancy Pelosi becomes President.
Monarch butterflies may be gone in thirty years. Saving them seems apolitical, but environmentalists have landed in the sights of drug cartels, illegal loggers, Trump supporters, and even clandestine avocado farmers.

Shhhh! Say nothing about this. Let the Trump supporters believe the election is postponed. #WeWillVote on November 3 and release our nation from this curse.

But she still hates President Trump !
#VoteTheBumOut | President Trump, lagging in the polls, floats idea of delaying electionThe protests have been outside, in the summer. Contagion risk is totally different than a Highschool gym with dozens of other voters. And most protestors wear masks, unless we can ban trump supporters we can expect about 46% of voters won’t be.
Well obviously we’re just having a cultural misunderstanding here. We liberal coastal elites don’t understand what Joe means by “vote for” or “Biden” and “Trump.” This is one of those off color jokes maybe.
Normalize laughing at people who die for supporting Trump #HermanCain
The feeling you get any time after trump speaks
Trump + COVID-19 + economic conflagration + election +  lies +  conspiracies = Unprecedented social unrest and upheaval in Q4. This is what we have to look forward to. 😔
Trump and Biden are both authoritarians. It is happening here.
Maybe Congress should delay the Presidental election like Trump want, if they move it to the 22nd of January then we get the joy of seeing President Pelosi sworn in
#Trump can’t win unless he wins every single state he won last time and that will NOT happen. He then would have to pick up snother state he lost last time and he can NOT!   #PresidentJoeBiden
Focused my ass! You dropped the ball 6 months ago when you called it a hoax, and named it the China Virus. It's the Trump virus. Get it right! You're the laughing stock of the planet now. Thanks for saving us and making America great again... Not!!!!
If Trump wins again, the kids won’t be in school for another 4 years
I think he knows that Trump has been doing all the things that they always pretended Democrats would do. He just saw an easy jumping off point, not that I’m not pleased but just saying.
Will Trump cash in some Putin chips to free this American citizen?
It will show us their power and that combined with fewer seats in both houses will allow us to feel really good about ourselves when trump opens the “re-education” camps. And then too we’ll be blamed for losing so many seats and “letting” the GOP do whatever they want.
For those saying Ed isn’t calling out Trump enough (a thread)
It’s been documented that Trump Properties has billed the Secret Service approx $670. A night per room exceeding over $167 million per documents given to Congress. And Ivanka’s Trademarks?
What about the millions that the Secret Service ( the taxpayers) have paid to Trump properties for hotel rooms? Or the money Ivanka is making off the Trademarks she got from China?
And yet they passed their Bill in May while you “ Paused” &amp; did nothing but confirm Trump Judges
Right listen to Trump suggesting you believe a doctor who says alien DNA cures corona virus. You are sooo much smarter than Biden
The fact that Trump continues to congratulate himself on the useless travel restrictions from January is embarrassing. What has he done lately? Nothing? No plan, no national testing strategy.
The Trump campaign sends out Mail in Ballots. But Dumbass says it’s not safe!!
Are you guys gonna cover the 32% drop in GDP??  Trump got you on the Election day thing.  Report what's important!!  Our country is failing because of him!!
Eventually they label misinformation as real information, programming you to believe what they want you to believe. I promise you it will come back to bite the American people. Imagine Trump won again with that label misinformation bill passing. I’m for freedom of speech, period.
He followed your lead so essentially trump you killed your friend!!!
Oh oh, sounds like Trump will be shopping around for a new "acting" FEC commissioner.
trump killed Herman Cain!!!
Love the shots taken at trump!!!
How much money did the Trump Co.’s make over the past 3 years? How much has Ivanka made off her Chinese Trademarks?
What has Trump done except let 150,000 Americans Die? STFU
And he's got no one else to thank, but Donald Trump. Had he not gone to your Tulsa rally, unmasked as most, he would be alive today! Good job, Mr. Trump, you're killing off your own tribe...
that being said, I don't think this actually is a political question - the constitution delegates that power to Congress. However, who is gonna enforce the courts decisions? They have no enforcement. The idea Trump will obey the rule of law is preposterous - he never has before
LOL   It's not 2016...   It's not 1974..   Trump is so out of touch with most Americans want that I feel like I am watching F Troop.   His big problem, of course, are the bodies.  Even his daily dumpster fires can't help hide them. 152,000
Every day Trump proves his mental illness makes him unfit for office.  Vote by mail and put Trump out of his misery
To be fair, I think if anyone catches it after April, it's Trump's fault. Other countries with far better leadership had this dealt with much more quickly.
Trump floats idea of delaying the November election, a power granted to Congress, as he ramps up attacks on voting by mail
It wouldn’t surprise me if Trump tried to make new Red states to fudge the Electoral College (like Lincoln did with Nevada).   Expect West Dakota and Pennsyltucky to be admitted in October.
Donald Trump is #terrifying !
I tried to stake out the mailbox to watch the fraud taking place.  Kept tripping over dead bodies from the Trump virus.
I have been told that - about the head space.  Is that a thing Trump supporters say ?
How sad, Donald Trump couldn't find enough dignity to attend this great man's funeral. I this his absence should speak volumes of his character. Bravo Mr. Bush!
The Trump Legacy
Donald Trump suggests delay to 2020 US presidential election - BBC News
My step aunt just said she’s a trump supporter 🤢
yeah, the law isn't decisive enough to make it clear who should be President, and thats all the excuse Trump needs to stay in power, and Dems don't have the spines to stop him.
Its on fairly shaky precedential grounds tho. Ultimately, I think it will come to competing claims, and the winner will be whoever seizes power and controls the narrative - i.e., Trump.
Yes it is but this is what Trump has done to this country
ALL THE LIVING PRESIDENTS WILL SPEAK EXCEPT JIMMY CARTER 🥜 &amp; DONALD TRUMP 🏨! AWESOME 👏🏾! THE BLACK CHURCH ⛪️ THE CHURCH! SOME THINGS YOU CAN’T PUT A PRICE ON IN AMERICA! IT’S LIKE A NATIONAL “FRATERNITY”! THE “REAL” PRESIDENTS KNOW HOW MUCH IT MEAN TO THE CORE OF THE NATION! 🇺🇸
Why are you anti trump???? Trump says patriots wear a mask! Wow Kelly I thought you were a Trump fan. Sad !
President Trump on Thursday suggested a “delay” to the November election, claiming a shift to mail-in voting would make it the most “fraudulent election in history.”
Day 96: Barely 3 weeks after the election, Trump claimed with zero evidence, that millions voted illegally (they didn't) and without them HE won the popular vote. (He lost the popular vote by 3 million.) This claim would be repeated numerous times months into his administration.
The coronavirus destroyed lots of jobs anyway. Even without any lockdowns, 40 million high risk Americans (elderly retirees, diabetics, etc.) would sharply restrict travel, going to restaurants, etc. No matter what, business as usual was not an option.
installing Nancy Pelosi off this spurious interpretation of the Constitution is just as extralegal as delaying the election. this is so dumb. and would mean giving Trump two months to solidify his coup
There’s always the fraud of mail-in ballots to offset the flat-tires of Democrat enthusiasm in the election. You forgot the down ticket races. ‘Look man’ there’s all those cabinet posts to fill. Donors need favors.  Trump is such a Nazi and eats babies.
So his death is REALLY at Trump's handz
And Democracy is a threat to Donald Trump.
Of course!.  Dumpster fires everywhere.   Ignore.  Here is Trump's downfall - speaking of embarrassments
Dr. Birx: I suppose the White House is exempt; King Trump and Pence/Devoss in a classroom of young children.
As Trump said, the more people who vote, the more likely the Dems will win the presidential election. (That's not always true at the local level, but it's true at the presidential election level.)
he has done so many obviously unconstitutional things since being impeached and Democrats haven't even threatened to try again. If Trump decides to move the election, or do anything else to make sure he stays in power, nobody in Washington is gonna stop him.
The only fraud is trump!!!
Who was crazier than Trump?
It may be more simple.  They want to keep their jobs and maintain power without doing anything.    Republicans are tapping their fingers and planning the date, time and conditions under which they dump Trump.  Treason requires a commitment to something and some effort.
Good thing trump has so much respect for the law or we would be in trouble.
Trump saying he wants to delay the elections is the least surprising thing about 2020. It's something everyone who’s been vocal against him has been saying since day one of his election- even before COVID-19. This fucker doesn't want have another election and risk his power.
Trump must be having cognitive issues not being able to distinguish between absentee &amp; mailing ballots.
Are you fucking kidding me! #Donald Trump calls for delay to 2020 US presidential election
The only fires burning in this country are Trump dumpster fires. Incessant chatter online or off as he leads the media he LOVES on another goose stepping chase.  Don't let it distract you from 152,000 dead bodies and a bankrupt country he created.
Donald Trump votes by mail. #VoteByMail2020 #VoteByMail #ByeDon2020
Unfortunately Trump made the catastrophic decision to put the economy before public health &amp; public safety.
Have to wonder how much Moderna stock Trump and his family cesspool own.
Welcome to Trump Hospital Dr. Stella Immanual - Director No masks - No pesky tests! Hydroxy vending machines Free Alien and Demon seed scans
I wonder - of ALL those lives that matter to Trump and his cast of enablers - which of those are the lives that are responsible for lowering property values in the suburbs?  Nobody in that group even attempts to hide what they mean - they keep saying the quiet parts out loud !
Dude, you said the inside words on the outside again!
And the Trump Administration will say “ He has a Ventilator because  made sure they were available”
President Donald Trump and his Democratic challenger, Joe Biden, both promise sweeping progress over the next four years –- via starkly different paths.
The Trump administration and Oregon leaders declared victory after it was announced that U.S. agents guarding a federal courthouse during violent demonstrations in Portland will pull back
trump has not made sure we have enough for testing let alone what will be needed for distribution of the vaccine!!!
Trump is a COWARD HE IS SCARED OF putin THAT IS WHY HE DOES NOT SPEAK UP ABOUT THE BOUNTY ON OUR BRAVE MEN AND WOMEN WHO ARE SERVING FOR OUR COUNTRY!!!
What their would NEVER be Trump /Hillary ticket lol... hell hasn't frozen over yet 😂😂😂
Can you even believe that trump got impeached THIS year?
no, if you vote for either main party candidate, you are failing to oppose this malevolence. Democrats are signing Trump's checks. There is no true opposition in our government.
Yup. I don't think Trump took it either.
That's horrific.  I am sorry for your loss.  Saw a sign yesterday "Save lives; dump Trump."  That's not even metaphorical.
tbh it would not surprise me one bit if coronavirus pushing turnout down plus Trump supporters passion makes him win a landslide despite the polls indicating otherwise.
Trump 2020 baby!!!
Yes, except in Trump's America.
This is such the opposite of truth it hurts.  Thinking Biden is an accetable option is the privileged position. The Democrats are enabling Trump's fascism. Electing Biden isn't gonna stop America's fall into totalitarianism.
democrats are funding Trump's fascism and doing nothing for the poor. If Trump wants to bribe people to win the election 🤷‍♀️ at least people will be able to eat. Things won't get any better under Biden, either.
I call it the Trump mumps.
The Trump Administration should just give the supply free of charge to patients like yourself.
There are legitimate uses for that drug. Patients with lupus couldn't get doses because Trump got Americans to buy it for COVID-19. The White House should just give the drug to lupus patients, for whom it could actually do some good.
You can't save Trump from a landslide defeat this coming Election Day. You don't have to sacrifice your integrity by lying on his behalf anymore.
So the question arises as to why #NobodyLikesTrump (love this hashtag)   Maybe cuz trump doesn’t like anyone but himself?   Respect is a two way street.  They teach you that when you’re 5..
In fairness, Trump and the GOP didn't create this virus, nor are they responsible for the hundreds of thousands of deaths in other countries. That part of the story, you really can attribute to the gods, or Nature, or whatever.
PUTIN IS A HAPPY MURDERING DICTATOR TODAY... (Its just more 'Fake News' didnt ya'll hear?) TRUMP DOESNT CARE TO CK FACTS, ITS ALL JUST HIS USUAL SMOKE N' MIRRORS! WE R SO SCREWED... HE MUST BE REMOVED
Silent  #ComplicitCowards
Trump n ye?!!!?
Trumps mental capacity has diminished rapidly the past year.   He clearly has no clue what is going on.  Trump is being managed so he does as little damage as possible before November.  Trump is unfit.
Followed all! Thank you 💕 for the ride!! TRUMP 2020!!🇺🇸
It would work in favor of the wealthy and against Middle class folks. Trump just wants to undo everything Obama, Good or not.
Democrat cities are transferring their costs to working-class suburbs. And, no way, were people of any race or low-income be moving into a Democrat affluent suburb. It's not a Trump Thing, as you may like, it's a Democrat Thing, that you don't like.
The left is falling apart. 2, maybe 3 different ideas what the dem party should be. I'll be shocked if they can all come together to challenge Trump. The right is all on the same page.
Donald Trump and his father were slum lords, you know that right‽ And let me tell you poor people work harder for their American nightmare than you do for your American Dream.
Most terrifying is that Trump gave her more publicity than she could have ever dreamed of.
You are so right Steve Schmidt.... Trump is unworthy to be anywhere near the body of John Lewis....
I'm with you steve schmidt.... I would NEVER work for a corrupt guy like TRUMP!   Those who do should be ashamed of themselves.....
steve schmidt is so right about the incompetent and corrupt Trump....
So true.... the fault lies with the corrupt Trump....
In the realignment that happened as a result of the 2016 election and Donald Trump, the Democrats have become the war-mongering hawk party. Strange thing for those of us who were active in politics in the early 2000’s.
President Donald Trump dismissed Democratic demands to include aid for cash-strapped cities in a new coronavirus relief package and he lashed out at Republicans, saying they should “go back to school” if they reject money for a new FBI headquarters
No, they know who the real Donald Trump is now. Start packing your bags!
But it was ok when Trump accused people in Healthcare of stealing PPE?
I’m guessing that Trump, his kids &amp; a lot of Republicans got in on it.
No matter how hard they try, the radical left can't stump the Trump!
Of course in the Trump administration,SNAFU applies as well.
Say what you will about Joe Biden being a Trojan Horse, you can't deny that he's going senile.   What sort of presidential candidate has to be led by his hand so he doesn't say something stupid to the press? Is hand-holder lady going to save him from the debates with Trump too?
Day 97: ONE WEEK after the election, Trump agreed to pay $25 million to settle a fraud case involving the for-profit Trump University regarding its shady recruiting practices and peddling an unaccredited real estate program.
Reject cancel culture and the "woke" blacklisting of conservatives. Fear of living under "woke" blacklisting will keep even some anti-Trump conservatives from ever voting for a Democrat.  #RepublicansForBiden
Ridiculous. Conservatives who sucked up to Trump were the ones who got access to the Executive Branch and all the power perks that come with that. The conservatives at the Bulwark have gotten absolutely no benefit. Leftists don't trust them and Trump supporters hate them. 1/
So now he’s taking advice from Colin Powell. So he has access to our intelligence? Maybe tRump should stick to “many people say”.
President Donald Trump is painting a dystopian portrait of what Joe Biden’s America might look like, asserting crime and chaos would ravage communities should the former vice president win the White House in November.
The only reason trump is doing that is he thinks it will help his re election,don’t be fooled!!!
And Putin just lifted another glass of vodka to trump
It’s not a blame game. It’s called presenting facts. You want to blame past presidents for being concerned about the lives of Americans?  You want to blame Trump for ignoring a plan that was handed to him &amp; he tossed it in the trash &amp; did nothing to save lives?  Your choice.
WTF IS HAPPENING 2R COUNTRY? TRUMPS DESTROYING IT ALL, ITS TRUE... HE DONT CARE ABOUT ANYONE! WE R DISPOSABLE LIKE  EVERYONE ELSE IN HIS LIFE, SADLY! Im upset because no one will do anything to stop this fkn maniac! We coulda removed Trump b4 all this death &amp; destruction!
you’re a piece of shit! You’re a insult to Americans of every color and nationality. Stop trying to steal votes away from  so your little orange faced girlfriend Trump can win. Bro take your meds and stay in your fucking lane stick to making ass music 🙏🏽🖕🏽
Because if there's a miracle cure, then we can safely reopen the economy, reopen the schools, get back to normal, and re-elect Trump.

The Trump administration has started talks with the Oregon governor’s office and indicated that it would begin to draw down the presence of federal agents sent to quell two months of chaotic protests in Portland if the state stepped up its own enforcement
Because Trump is fearful of competition
What next? Trump promoting Dr. Immanuel performing a Covid-exorcism?
Trump may not be familiar with phrase "Mean People Suck" He's mean. People don't like him. Simple.
Here’s something that neither Trump, the GOP or Fox “ News” will never comment on
Trump’s America
See a good example of Trump’s Facist illegal and secret use of technology to spy on peaceful protesters. He is was protecting private property. See you in court.
Trump has crossed the line from incompetent to criminal.  His buddies DeSantis and McConnell should join Trump in jail.
BLAME YOURSELF "LIL' MARCO" FOR LETTING TRUMP DESTROY WHAT REALLY MAKES AMERICA TRULY SPECIAL... OUR UNITY!
GET IT TRENDING!! The Trump Admins new Nickname is out there trending i hope... I loved it when Barr said Meat &amp; Potato Crimes... Hes such a LOSER, LIAR &amp; BOOT LICKER! Sounds like an act at Mar-a-lago...LMFAO! "Trumps Meat &amp; Potato Heads!" Such idiots, smh! 🌊🌊 #MeatnPotatoHeads
Trump is moderate for the most part, in any event. It’s the Dems leftward lurch that makes him look “conservative.” The post-Trump GOP will be to his right...
Gotta love a good laugh at the expense of Trump
Eric Trump, you are almost as miserable and delusional as your daddy. Don't worry, there's still time......
Just a delusional Trump supporter.
Press Secretary is nothing more than Trump's puppet.
Should President Trump attend Rep. John Lewis’ funeral?
Nah. If the death toll from COVID-19 is approaching 200,000 on Election Day, Trump will be toast regardless of anything else that happens. This will truly be the coronavirus election.
Antifa is not even a group... Wtf r u ppl talking about? The conspiracy theorist in this country are going to be what kills us all! Trump's the worst president in US history! I can't wait 4 him to just go far far away!
Thank trump POS!!!
This is a blessing. No Trump media = no lies, no propoganda.
Trump abruptly ends briefing after being pressed over retweeting misinformation  RUN LITTLE BOY!!!
Maybe not this virus specifically. But when Trump was elected, I was positive we wouldn't get through his first time without some God-awful devastating catastrophe.
Blaming evil spirits for plagues was quite common in centuries past. If Trump wins a second term, maybe he'll even bring back Maypole dancing. (Of course, this is the 21st century, so this time it will be Maypole hip-hop dancing.)
Trump Is So Jealous of Dr. Anthony Fauci That He Lied About Throwing Out the Yankees' First Pitch  via
You tweet this like the  family name holds to a higher standard than the Gold Reserve.
You tweet this like the  family name holds to a higher standard than the Gold Reserve.
I guess you forget the 8 years prior to Obama. Two wars in countries that had zero to do with 9/11 and a gigantic market crash. Obama got us out of that disaster and left Trump with an economy that was in a clear incline. He wasn't perfect by any means but Trump is terrible
I am at a loss for how to speak with trump supporters to get them to actually listen and understand. they are genuinely incapable of empathy, understanding, and compassion.
yeah, I fully expect Trump to not step down, and seize power with the armed mercenaries currently arresting protestors.
Really not that surprising Trump-the- fraud would endorse a doctor who's a fraud.  Hydroxychloroquin is crap. Does not work.
You're 100% a Trump fan. It's 3.5 years past "just give the guy a shot". If you haven't figured that out then you're a card carrying member of MAGA
Kaitlan is one of bright points of the briefings. Thx for holding Trump's feet to the fire with your challenging questions.
Kayleigh, bunker boy Trump is pushing drugs again.
Trump is disconnected from reality.  Very disturbing
Reclaiming my time 😂😂😂  TRUMP 2020🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
Trump retweets "A great doctor said that masks don't work, and there's a cure for Covid 19, and that doctors make medicine from DNA from ALIENS and that they're trying to make a vaccine to make you immune from becoming religious" And the President says she was very impressive???
That would be their reasoning. Charlie clearly has issues with the Trump admin. He's reaching across the aisle.
MLB commish says this is not a nightmare ,he clearly hangs with Donald Trump WTF #clown
Not for nothing, but Eric Trump is one goofy looking individual.  That being said, bravo, Twitter, for the 12 hour slap on the wrist for his continuous spread of misleading information on Covid.
We have actual science. We also have desperate political activists who are doing everything they can to undercut the science to get Trump re-elected.
How is Donald Trump allowed to continue spreading misinformation about Hydroxycloroquine? 150,000 dead Americans, and this guy continuously spreads bad information. The President of the United States is not a friggin' doctor! Please reprimand this behavior on Twitter!
Amazing what a bloated bag of crap AG Barr is! This administration is more corrupt than anyone could have ever imagined.  This isn't America anymore. And it won't be until we vote Donald Trump out in November!!!
everyone should report Trump's tweets. Let's kick him off social media
Well then Trump fits into the over 70 and can commit crimes category!
Isn't it funny how no one really cared about politics before? Presidents did their jobs and people went about their jobs. And because Presidents did their jobs we didn't have to worry about them doing theirs while doing our ours. And now we have a chump named Trump.
Here’s how Trump’s opposition to mail voting hurts the GOP
The Trump virus thanks you!  150,000 and counting.
Deranged Trump Says Its ILLEGAL For Negative News About Him To Trend On ...  via  lol
It's not going well. If Trump was good at his house Sessions would still be there and he'd be dancing on them
Was she referring to guns legally obtained, or the rash of illegal guns out on the streets?  tRump/Barr has 3.5 yrs to tackle the gun trade. Why haven’t they? Too busy covering up and interfering in tRump trials.
1. Trump capitalized on both racist backlash that we had a Black president for 8 years &amp; that the 2008 recovery was uneven. People were mad. She was part of that administration. 2. ~70% of the country votes for their party no matter what. 3. A lot of people REALLY hated Hillary.
Trump. Someone mix his spray tan with paint remover.
It’s President Trump to you
its President Trump to you
Damn #TrumpIsALoser
Hey look, a statement from a Dr. who doesn’t believe in Aliens! Unlike the nut job that Trump &amp; Jr were tweeting about yesterday.
Day 98: Since the 1970s more than 25 women have accused Trump of sexual harassment or sexual assault, including at least 16 who accused him publicly in 2016. In Oct 2016 came the Access Hollywood tape of tacit admission.  (41% of women still voted for him, inc 53% of white women)
I've been center-right for decades. My views haven't changed much. But Trump and his followers have redefined "conservative" to be practically synonymous with "ultra-right lunatic fringe." And that isn't me.
Fauci finally threw Trump under the bus.  Trump is a very sick man.
Might make a good title for an anti-Trump documentary.
Because Trump promoted it at the start. Rather than evolving with the science, because that is seen as weakness, he is doubling and tripling down on it.
Nothing you can say or do will help Trump get re-elected. The sooner you reconcile yourself to that, the sooner we can have a sincere discussion.
But it is politicized. Trump's followers are following his playbook of rapid-fire lies.
Even before I looked, I predicted that you would have retweeted Trump favorably. Not every Trump supporter is a COVID denier. But every COVID denier is a Trump supporter. Trump isn't worth even one American life.
It's not callousness. It's desperation. All they can think about is "Re-elect Trump! Re-elect Trump!" And they're afraid that the deaths of brave men like this doctor will cause American voters to base their November vote on the state of the pandemic.
Be patient. I'm positive that the denialist bots and trolls infesting Twitter will vanish the morning after Trump loses the election. That has been, of course, their priority: Convince people that COVID is no big deal because they know it hurts Trump's re-election chances.
They are increasingly desperate and frantic to re-elect Trump. They are frantically trying to change the subject away from COVID and Trump's response to it because they know it will hurt Trump's re-election chances.
Trump again pushes unproven drug as COVID-19 treatment
Did you see that Trump was invited by the Yankees to throw out a first pitch? No? Well neither had the Yankees.
Why should we put ourselves at risk of death from COVID-19 just to help Trump get re-elected? Donald Trump is not worth even one human life.
...and letting THEM (doctor and patient together) make that decision?  Nobody is dying en masse from taking it.  It indeed might not been Trump’s best decision to tweet numerous times about it last night, which took away momentum he had from visiting a vaccine plant earlier...
Why the fuck is Trump so ignorant?
Can you just imagine how Trump &amp; the GOP would have reacted if President Obama had written such a tweet while in office?
Do you believe Trump is actually the one Tweeting on  ?
The Trump Administration’s Corruption knows No Bounds
why are you allowing a Trump add on your tv station that's lying and saying that Biden is for Defunding the police?
148, 213 dead Americans. Thank you Mr. Trump for caring more about getting re - elected than whether or not Americans live or die from COVID. So good to see you at John Lewis' funeral today. Oh wait, you couldn't be bothered with that either... Schmuck!!!
See what happens when you follow Idiot Trump’s directions
In a word TRUMP
Trump is an incredible Menace to every American
So, youre willing to believe tens of thousands of nurses &amp; doctors the world over are in cahoots to undermine the healthcare system &amp; make Trump look bad but ten doctors &amp; nurses cobbled together by Breitbart are beyond reproach? Your bias is showing.
This is what Trump, Trump Jr, Republicans &amp; their goons call Violent Protesters! I’m sorry who started the violence??
I see you’re rewriting history again Mitch. Let me remind you that Republicans held up the Cares Act because they Demanded that Corporations get $$&amp; out of the Bill. And you all bitched because the Democrats demanded Oversight, which Trump got rid of anyway.
Yes!! If the adults cannot follow protocol, how an we expect kids too?  Notice that tRump’s sons school is not fully opening. Where’s the outrage? Right, different rules for private schools.
I can refute them in just one sentence: "Donald Trump is not worth a single American life." Because that's what is really on their mind.
Trump would end him
She will vote against anything Trump. She is in a tough race in ME.
Trump's been wrong for almost 4 years.
The goal is to re-elect Trump. And since Trump screwed up the COVID-19 response, they know that they have to deny the whole COVID-19 pandemic and change the subject to something else. They know that if the voters think too long about COVID-19, Trump is toast.
Once the Trump supporters no longer need to lie and obfuscate to save their hero from an electoral defeat (because the defeat already happened), we may be able to achieve some consensus in this country.
It's impossible to agree on a course of action against COVID in the middle of a presidential campaign. Trump's supporters are so desperate to see him re-elected that they'll lie, deny, obfuscate, etc. Once Trump loses and the election is over, we may have a productive debate.
Trump isn't going to the funeral because it would put undo stress on John Lewis' family...
A Trump.
WHAT’S TRUMP HIDING??
JFC! Trump rembered 5 words!  can hold a glass w/1 hand, easily walk down a ramp, say the words Anonymous, Origins, States etc. Donnie? Not so much...
Yeah but Republicans aren’t racist!! Between shit like this and Trump’s antics how can anyone take this party seriously anymore?
Well, maybe you’re right. But Neither Bush or Trump won by popular vote. The majority was silenced. How’s that helpful?
Trump would be Pitiful if he weren’t so Sub-Human.
THREAD: Im Angry for States in the South, if Trump had done his job, listened 2 scientist NY/NE areas should've been the end of ALL huge outbreaks! If we shutdown, got control, set up tracers 2 keep track of outbreaks, it wouldn't have devoured so many of u, like it did us! /1
It’s not perfect, far from it! I think the majority of the country didn’t want Trump or Bush as presidents, nevertheless that horrendous situation happened. Something must be done. Almost everywhere the vote 🗳 is direct.
Of course not...Trump is RACIST!!!
Absolutely disgusted by my fellow Americans. That we should even be having the discussion of who to vote for is insanity! That Americans would even consider voting for Trump despite his absolute failure on every level possible is unimaginable! It's un - American!
Absolutely!  I personally think people should be asking these questions when looking for a good woman. "What's your favorite food, what kind of music do you like, are you a Trump supporter". If she answers yes to the 3rd question, keep looking...
How can that be true? Trump &amp; Pence said it was safe to congregate for Religious Services!
I like George Carlin. However, this is a horrible take. yes he is a comedian and probably is joking, but voter apathy is a real problem. Carlin was alive during a different time. Trump's America is dangerous
Every single anti-masker is a Trump supporter. No exceptions. They are frantic to deny COVID-19 because they know it hurts Trump's re-election chances.
Deep-pocketed and often anonymous donors are pouring over $100 million into an intensifying dispute about whether it should be easier to vote by mail, a fight that could determine President Donald Trump's fate in the November election.
This time Trump will recommend drinking Mr. Clean.
Under President Trump the Death rate from covid eclipsed 146000.
If you're in the space of, "how could this possibly get better for Trump," I get it. But if you look at this historically, the political environment predicts the outcome of elections more than the candidates. This one has a multidimensional awfulness for the incumbent
All of this is to say that the President is doomed, electorally. And there are particular reasons why Trump's response has been very bad, but I really believe if you created some kind of American Super-President in a lab, they'd also be doomed. The virus is too wily.
Day 99: During the 2016 campaign, Trump made headlines (and fans) by insulting -among others- Mexican immigrants, John McCain, the Khan family, a federal judge, disabled people, all of his primary opponents (esp Ted Cruz), journalists &amp; the media, and several female celebrities
Trump’s America, where Americans are an afterthought.
My 2cents... I think the clock is up. Vaccine news is not real until people can start altering their behavior. Trump will certainly claim victory on a vaccine as he has on falling unemployment, but I just don't think it will matter if it's not altering day to to day life.
The Trump Virus has killed 150,000 Americans and your Dad is a Traitor. You stole money from a children’s cancer charity. But yeah, let’s talk about that one block in Portland. 🙄#TrumpIsACompleteFailure #TrumpCrimeFamily
#DicatorTrump is trending. I feel the spelling speaks for itself.  In case it doesn't though, how is Trump a dictator when riots have been going on for months? Wouldn't a dictator have crushed all dissent? It's not the right-wing burning buildings, it's radical leftists!
Probably a lie Mr or Ms not the Real Donald Trump! Someone should look into who is really running your site. Nothing about Trump is True or Good!
No flu pandemic in a hundred years ever killed 140,000 people in five months. That you are clinging to this "COVID is just like flu" theme shows how desperate you are to get Trump re-elected.
Trump is finished no matter what you do.
It’s been over 6 months &amp; over 145,000 Americans have died &amp; Donald Trump STILL DOESN’T HAVE A NATIONAL TESTING PLAN. How many more Americans have to die before he finally implements one??
Excellent. I had forgotten some of the sins that Trump has committed against Native Americans and the environment they protect.
This may shock you, but I give Trump's advisers credit for finding a ploy that would finally get him to take action. He's been impervious to appeals based on science, mass death and suffering, etc. But when he heard that his loyal voters may be unable to vote, he acted!
It's not just Trump. The American Right has been opposing science and scientists in several disciplines as a way of heading off its policy implications: Biological evolution by natural selection; anthropogenic global warming; and now epidemiology.
I don’t trust Trump to run a bath
President Donald Trump's National Security Adviser Robert O'Brien has tested positive for the coronavirus — making him the highest-ranking official to test positive so far.
I have been a conservative since the late 1970s. (Sometimes as Republican, sometimes as Independent.) Voted for Reagan twice, Bush 41 twice. I'm voting for Biden because I've seen what Trump and his supporters think of the COVID-19 pandemic.
AP-NORC poll: Anxiety props up Biden, Trump voters fervent
As we drop below 100 days until the election - no matter what the polls are saying - we still have to keep fighting!!  This country cannot take 4 more years of trump!
I hope the DeathSantis nickname sticks for this mini-Trump. Flabbergasting that – assuming he doesn't resign – some will still vote for the person whose policies directly killed Floridians.
People on the right keep calling ANTIFA a fascist organization and Trump keeps retweeting them. Whoever interviews him next should ask him for the definition of fascism and then walk off the interview when he can't answer correctly. #fucktrump #TrumpMeltdown
If I am  I don’t even bother to debate Trump. I think it’s clear to most Americans that Trump doesn’t even belong on the same stage as #JoeBiden
I don't know where the 7.2 million number came from, obviously there's far more than that. But we need a president who will address the problem, and acknowledge the problem. The one we had has failed us miserably. If you ever wanna see another concert, vote Trump out in November!
Trump is truly an idiot.   Mail in voting is as safe as in person. Trumps administration all vote by mail including Trump.
Another Trump Failure!
...recently.  I hope voters can see through the #MainstreamMedia doom and gloom, see how much progress has been made in both fighting the virus, and growing the economy, and give Trump some credit, and hopefully, consideration for their vote this fall. #Election2020
I think they are trying to raise panic and fear in the American public, in my opinion, in an effort to help unseat Trump.  And unfortunately they appear to be succeeding.
Pro Life , Pro Law Enforcement, Pro military , an America loving patriot and a trump supporter unfollow me I DON’T CARE. I’m proud to be an American in the land of the free🇺🇸.
This is not funny, productive, constructive or really helpful in any way. Trump and his oppression tactics won't be stopped by twitter dunks and shitty nicknames. Show up and do something.
Trump gasses peaceful protesters, Moms, Dads, Grandparents, Vets.
Wait, doesn't Trump say that to reporters during his press conferences? Oh I get it now...
I’m sorry who made it political? I distinctly remember Trump talking about it at a press conference before ANY studies had been done. Oh &amp; he had stock in a company that made it.Donald Trump Ripped After Calling Surprise Press Conference During Barack Obama’s Eulogy For John Lewis This to RADICAL Media but it Seem ok for OBAMA to mention Vote by MAIL in which is totally  disgraceful disgusting  unacceptable and WRONG at FUNERAL!

It doesn't matter what the drug is Laura. They don't want to conquer the virus on Trump's watch. If some how if "M+M's" was a cure they would band them! It's all B.S. like most things are becoming in this country. The country is so full of lies..it really is a SIN!

u are right with the numbers Laura but sadly they are not heard or even understood by the left+their thugs. They do not care any way. I could running against Trump+win. As long as Trump loses they don't care of the cost of money, life, or destroying America PEROID!
Ameba has way more brains than TRAITOR Trump..

That Barr hearing was a total charade. Some say HE was disrespectful when THEY were. They were awful. They should be impeached! How on earth can they justify what's been going on+blame everything on Trump. It's absurd!
So....someone who Trump wouldn't allow to stay in the US
Hmmm...I wonder if Trump bought any stock. .
No shit...
If it helps Trump (in Barr's opinion), he'll release it.  If it doesn't help, he won't.   It's pretty simple

Because Trump and his campaign will just say Biden is not mentally fit to debate. Not a good idea
I think Pence's disgusting, nauseating sycophancy is tied to him desperately trying to keep the VP spot. I still feel like Trump will dump him for Nikki Haley once Biden announces his pick.
Maybe now Trump will start to take COVID-19 seriously?
I love u...still my favorite singer...but yourTrump hating tweets have turned me off...not because it's Trump...but because of the hate...very disappointed...thought I had better thoughts...

you look like you run like Barron Trump i don’t believe you
WHY DON'T YOU STAY OUT OF ELECTIONS LIKE EVERY OTHER PRESIDENT WHO PROCEEDED YOU. NEVER IN THE HISTORY OF AMERICA HAS A PREVIOUS PRESIDENT, OPENLY HELPED A CANDIDATE RUN. WORRIED HE CANT HANDLE THE DEBATES. TRUMP WILL EAT HIM ALIVE!
Reagan paved the way for Trump..
Well Trump will be re elected I am positive he won’t have a problem with that.
He's the one who started us toward the cliff. We're all still waiting for that "trickle down"...SMH. I find it hilarious that his estate is against Trump using his image when he's the one who paved the way..
The country's been crumbling for decades. Trump's just exponentially accelerated the process. The corruption is nearly complete. This is our very last chance, and I'm not hopeful.
I still think Trump's gonna dump Pence and name Nikki Haley as VP. Just a feeling...
like the decades long relationship/friendship shared between Trump and Pence
Massachusetts for Trump
And because most of his supporters can’t read or write or spell. Trump can’t spell

That great economy Trump has bragged about was built by Obama and Biden and TRAITOR, Rapist Trump had nothing to do with it....
Trump isn't  and never has been pro-life. He's pro-Trump only.
Hmmm....this seems relevant..
Can't be a Christian and support Trump.  Nice try.
That may not be true:
Sadly, it doesn't matter what Biden says or does. He can B in the ICU +people will vote 4 him cause the hate 4 Trump. This whole political, virus, violence, hate, lies+twisted comments would never been believed 30 yrs ago. U know y? People wouldn't let evil happen.
The bad people are getting more+more momentum each day. By Nov US will be a total mess+ the bad guys would have succeeded+Biden will win. Trump has to clean the streets NOW of all the thugs. Call in the military. It's come time to fight violence with violence.
#Cuomovirus is more correct.... he mismanaged his state and caused a mass exodus of his citizens to other states...  then blames trump for killing his elderly by introducing the virus into nursing homes
Looks like he's using Trump's face paint
I guarantee if trump throws out the first pitch at the Yankees game he’ll compare it to Fauci
Mad TAXPAYERS just had ENOUGH of the DEMOCRATS in the HOUSE and SENATE for saying this that PRESIDENT Trump is FIRST President to be call RACIST This totally Wrong its other way around! All you DEMOCRATS been Racist since the beginning of his term! Biden need to shut up his mouth
Nothing like pissing off somebody who's writing a book about you...I'm no fan of this guy but anything that pisses off Trump and Barr is A-OK with me.
People listen if a sign bothers you. Whether it says Black Lives Matter, All Lives Matter, Blue Lives Matter, Trump Pence, Biden, Obama. There is one thing you can do...drive past it.
OMG, what is Trump smoking?
None of you morons are doing anything about the violence. These are federal agents cleaning up your mess. Just because Trump is sending them in, it’s racist. Typical Liberal response! Good luck to the law abiding citizens that have to live there!
This complete administration lies every time they speak...Including you..because Trump lies about everything and all you do is lie right with him!
These are the kind of people that we don’t need in politics she obviously supports Trump but she thinks if she comes out and says directly that she supports him she’ll lose votes that’s disgusting and that’s politics in a nutshell
Once Trump is out of office, this fella right there should be charged with crimes against humanity.

Meaning they don’t want people that will question Trump. Just shut up and go along with the bullshit
why didn't you mention on CNN today that the ONLY reason Trump wants the payroll tax cut is to defund Social Security which he wants to destroy like everything else. No one ever mentions this fact...SMH
One day deep in the future we’re going to get an expose about why Trump and people politically allied to him so violently pushed for hydroxychloroquine during the 2019-2021 COVID pandemic despite all evidence that it’s at best useless.

Smart ,I accept this GOP who is country over party any day. Please encourage other GOP not to vote for Trump  an extremely dangerous man.
You do not know anything. I hate GOP who are complicit with Trump.
Fire the governor .Get a governor that care about the people ,not just about himself and who love Trump.
ONLY THE democratic IDIOTS were there!! How many KNEES were taken?? I DIDN'T WATCH MORE IMPORTANT THINGS TO DO!! OH 4 MORE YEARS PRESIDENT TRUMP 🇺🇸
Will we honestly be any better with Pence? Pence will also pardon Trump if the opportunity or need arises.
Well its a GOOD THING only democrats were watching!! The Rest Of Us Were BUSY Doing More IMPORTANT Things !! 4 MORE YEARS PRESIDENT TRUMP 🇺🇸
Trump mentioned Johnson and Johnson.  $VXRT 🚀
GOP support of Trump so short sighted. Any semi-competent Republican would win Nov easily imo but the need to get rid of Trump overrides the awfulness of this coalition, giving them an opportunity they may not get again for a while.
Why is Trump urging any actions for which he has made clear he takes no responsibility for whatever consequences result?

Yeah, exactly, they’re trying to stop Trump from getting in the way of their agenda of chaos. Making it look like it’s Trump, and people like you are the sheep that believe it.
There was no excuse for the Trump administration to not send a representative to pay respect to John Lewis. Pence served with him in Congress, he could have made an appearance. We need respect and decency back in the White House. #JohnLewisMemorial

So right how can any church going person approve of trump? HOW?
I’ve literally been screaming this from the rooftops since he did that “President 4eva” video tweet, long before impeachment. Trump is not going to leave the White House willingly and do whatever he can to stop it from ever happening.
Republican legislative leadership firmly rejects Trump suggestion of postponing election.
And another unqualified spokesperson spouting nonsense so that she can benefit from the Trump grift. Enough. These people all have to go ASAP.
Lincoln jailed a serious number of journalists too during the Civil War. I think Trump should emulate him! Want to continue with those lines of reasoning?
No but FDR got an extra term! Does that mean it’s ok for Trump then?
Oh Karen, you poor dear.  You poor sad dear.  Of course the numbers are skewed.  It's reality and reality skews everything trump does.  I mean, just ask Herman Cain, right?

Holy crap!!  Trump killed Herman Cain!!
The Dems embrace the far left, will kill jobs, raise taxes. Equality alright-in poverty! Jobs will go back overseas. Dems are the enemy!  Trump created jobs, lowered taxes, forced companies home, better trade deals, etc.   Doubts? Vote Trump. Enemy of my enemy is my friend!
What if Congress (aka trump's republican sycophants) delays the election? Is that even a remote possibility?

Very sneaky response from Barr....laying the groundwork for trump to either try to delay the election or contest the results. The entire nation will need to rise up in protest.
oh wait, didn’t President Trump suggest this a while ago....oh yeah, that’s right, he doesn’t get credit for anything!

Why does trump always look like he'd prefer to be sitting on  a toilet?
Wow! Biden is now trying to change his tune and sound more like Trump!   What does that tell you? He’s a liar. Just look at the low life liars he’s considering for VP!
Not only that money but the millions of taxpayer dollars spent on trump's golf outings, etc....He owes us!
If you want America to become Russia, China, Cuba, Venezuela then vote for Biden. You see what Dem rule looks like!  If you want safety, law and order, a quality life for you and your family, then vote TRUMP 2020!
I'll take a deep breath then watch Trump diligently because he can do a lot of harm between the election and inauguration day.
Trump is a traitor.
Did you ask him why not? Trump needs to be cornered on this...are we going to continue to think it's okay for putin to pay for dead American soldiers?????
When the killing of people begins... trump’s street parades  will need tanks and the national guard
Let get this straight $1.75 billion to build a FBI building, money for Pentagon that Trump used for border wall, but the GOP can't support the unemployed? What do the GOP has to do for poor people to get that, republicans don't fucking care about the poor!
Trump supporter bot with only 23 followers... you are not the base
Trump is in control not the fed. This has been communicated for the past few years now
So, Lady G, while you’re going down on Trump, does Barr give you a warning before sticking his dick in your ass, or are you always ready for it? Speaking of auditioning...
Someone as childish and ignorant as Trump?
No one likes Trump, and he knows it.
Yes. Obviously a rhetorical question but yes.  What else can any MAGA mean at this point except that.  Trump’s delivered on that campaign promise.  It’s shocking to see it happening but no surprise.
This is a huge problem today. The people who oppose Trump are not Anti American. Unfortunately, if you dislike the leadership of Israel today and oppose the treatment of Palestinians then you are anti-Semitic. This involves both sides of the political spectrum.
Yup.  They’re not into debates and reasoning from evidence.  They could be but they’re not. And if Trump calls them to action, they’re on it, like the open carry crowd who heeded the tweet to liberate Michigan.
Trump is no Christian.
And what the heck would you have done better than Trump.   Obama and you stifled SARS testing to falsely keep the numbers low. Have some nerve talking about not abandoning people. China lover. You took their $ to pad your own accounts didn’t you!
That is a very political attitude.  Sounds like he not care about the people of U.S including Trump's fan.
There are not enough hours in the day for me to say why no thinking person likes trump!
Was hoping for Warren as well. This changes everything. Guess I’ll have to not vote for Trump anyway.

SCREW her!! she LOST ALL CONTROL of that City!! PRETTY BAD WHEN THE PRESIDENT HAS TO STEP IN.  PRESIDENT TRUMP IS THE ONLY PRESIDENT THAT CAN SAVE OUR COUNTRY
Apparently Trump said yesterday that negative tweets about him are illegal.  😟
Can Time Magazine just name Dr. Fauci their "Person of the Year" now just to really rub it in Trump's face?
Always hopeful, but Biden suddenly tacking left is only slightly more realistic than Trump maturing into his job.
If Trump making up an invitation to throw the opening pitch for the Yankees isn't a sign of his mental disability, I don't know what is. This is how the president of the US behaves? Who does that when it's going to be exposed as a lie as sure as the nose on his face.
We in the USA have become powerless. We will get nothing fixed until the Trump is out of here. As evidenced by the circumstances at the protests, we cannot change things until then. Protesting is not working when he has stormtroopers responding and abusing the people there.
AND...didn’t trump buy up a whole bunch of it?
This is why some Americans may not be willing to take a vaccine developed underthe Trump asministration. How can we trust the Federal government?
Those tech companies would rather see American die than let licensed doctors share their frontline experience that could potentially save thousands of lives. All these follies are for just one purpose: try to stop Trump from being re-elected
White fence for the White supremacists in the White House...I hope Biden has it torn down as trump is marched down the driveway into prison.

Trump can’t go anywhere he’s not the center of attention - Quite a genius.  Stable, too.

Youre such a fool. Pres Trump has done NOTHING to divide Americans. That is all courtesy of the Democrats and the mental Pygmy  ! That is a FACT
How can Trump have possibly avoided this virus with all those around him dropping like flies. Perhaps he’s a carrier. Typhoid Donnie.
Pretty good chance Trump will no longer be in office when the vaccine becomes available.

You hate the truth
Should we really believe that Trump has turned around on masks and distancing, or is there some other more dastardly plan afoot to rock our boat and sink it. I don’t trust him one iota.
Trump  sorry to tell you,you are the the most corrupt president in  will be in history book when you pass away.  You made America worse ,not great.
Michael, it seems that local Portland officials were getting this under control before Trump sent his federal gestapo troops into the city to ‘dominate the streets.’ Moms, veterans, BLM protestors are not the folks destroying property late at night. He’s only inflamed tensions.
those are JUST FINE people according D.J.Trump
trump just signed 4 executive orders lowering the cost of insulin to pennies a day so hopefully the price gets lowered soon 😔

Can you people ever portray Trump’s body for real?! Or do you need to copy and paste his face onto somebody else’s body to make you feel better about your Dear Leader?
Donald Trump bought ads on #Facebook making false statements about vote-by-mail in an effort to suppress the vote. I want key federal regulators to investigate.

Come on Michael. I can’t believe how much credibility you give to an obvious attempt by Trump to change the subject.  To the extent there is more violence, it’s driven by Trump.
As Trump ignores laws, decorum, traditions &amp; has no moral compass whatsoever. Americans will rectify this horrible mistake in November.
AS PRESIDENT, JOE BIDEN WOULD NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS LYING TO YOU, AGAIN.   SHOCKER
Oh, Nikki, bad move.  EVERYTHING Trump touches dies.
There was no ‘shy’ Trump vote in 2016. There was a depressed Democratic turnout among left leaning voters who either didn’t like Hillary or thought she would win anyway so they didn’t vote. Left leaning voters learned their lesson, and will flock to the polls come November. Bet.
“...They are also spreading the falsehood that the state guidelines were the secret brainchild of the Trump Education Department when in fact the consulting firm involved has been doing this kind of work dating back to the Obama administration.” #NHPolitics

Yes and the real human, well the other people the 52 million out of work and no plan and what is trump doing. Why of course another day at the golf course, So tell me who has more respect?
Harry you said at the end there that there’s still a large amount of undecideds which could swing the race either way. In many polls Biden is over 50 percent, so in that scenario wouldn’t Biden still win if Trump won 100 percent of the undecideds? Just curious.

Trump’s been president for 3 3/4 years yet the Covfefe Cult still absolves him from any blame. Government assistance to farmers under Trump is socialism.  Surprised you’re bringing it up. I thought Trumers hated socialism.  Did you send back your stimulus check?
Even before the COVID-19 pandemic there were twice as many farm bankruptcies under Trump than under President Obama.
So Trump will force the USPS to fail, just to get his own way.

Just chaff from the WH to try to interfere with people’s ability to focus on the 150,000 deaths and astonishing collapse in the economy due to Trump’s astonishing incompetence.
Disregarding people like me, independent voters, is a great way to lose this election. I hate Trump, just look at my tweets, but I dislike K. Harris about as much. I do love Kiesha Lance Bottoms, however. I can have an opinion and not be a bot.
Another turd floating in the Trump Bowl.  Just chaff to try to interfere with people’s ability to focus on the 150,000 deaths and a record setting drop in the economy due to Trump’s astonishing incompetence.
Herman Cain was a covid denier.  He went to the Oklahoma rally without a mask. He was a tRump supporter to the end.  If he had used the smarts God gave him he would not be dead.
We should simply ignore all this chaff and focus on health, the economic collapse, and the things we’ve lost due to Trump’s astonishing incompetence.

Pop-up Trump stand sparks political friction in North Falmouth:  #capecod
I mean, seriously, I get why Trump doesn't bother you that much. You made your career at NR. What's racism and incompetence after that? But for those of us who aren't fans of those traits in the White House, what is you suggestion?
I strongly believe that you should learn to either write better or make better arguments, then because I read it and that's your position. Republicans helped Trump, but that's not a reason to vote against them. That's what you said. Yes or no?
Have you’ve seen the black Americans murdered because they support Donald Trump??? Doesn’t matter what side your on , this should not happen !!! But u are just a puppet for them ... sad
Gotta be tough admitting you were the mark in a grift, Barry. Your donations to Trump were skimmed and redistributed to family members.  It will take a while but soon you'll admit you were conned and eventually will forgive Trump but you won't forgive those who made you feel dumb
Trump’s supporters go out of their way to propagate the narrative that they are astonishingly half-witted.
The one thing the Trump administration will accomplish is setting a record for being on the losing side of the most court cases.
And Trump supporters never want to discuss how Russia is destroying our democracy with Trumps assistance... you seem to be only able to focus on small issues.. Like Trump and his very tiny small little issue...
Do you think it’s ok for Putin to put bounties on our American Soldiers and Trump say nothing to confront Putin?
Trump is reserving housing in the suburbs for his Russian pals.  Real estate is a great way to launder money.
Think of how astonishingly obtuse these people think Trump’s followers are.  They really believe they’re gullible to buy this load of horse shit.
Trump is the most incurious president in history.  He actually resents men and women in the military because their commitment to duty and country stand in contrast to his lack of duty.  His only interest is in how much taxpayer and donor money he can skim before he’s booted.
How would we know since there is no coverage of Barron? We know Trump is never pictured with his son. Not one shot of him doing any Father activity with his son
Trump surrenders so quickly you’d think he was the French army.
Trump is the most incurious president in our history.  The only thing that interests him is how to skim as much taxpayer and donor money as he can before he gets the boot.
Playing right into Putin’s hands. Trump’s understanding of the world would get him an F in a 6th grade civics class.  How much havoc  will this guy wreak in the next few months?
Blame it on the Adderall Trump takes that is made from alien DNA.
Well thanks to the Republicans and their latest COVID package - more people will be evicted, foreclosed on while Trump hotel receives millions....
How are GOP Senators who knuckled under to Trump at every turn (some, Hawley/Cotton/etc. with enthusiasm) not "true culprits?" If they opposed Trump, what would support look like to you?
Lewis was a man who was subjected to the most vile forms of hate and bigotry and rose above it and had no malice in his heart. Trump was born into privilege and harbors nothing but hate, malice, and a desire for revenge. The contrast between these two men couldn't be greater.
She made him look like an idiot, and secure job or not no misogynist likes it when a woman is smarter than he and makes him sound like a half-wit.  Witness the way Trump talks to female reporters.
Trump himself is a product of alien DNA.
Apparently, there are a lot of Lotus Eaters in the Trump administration.
He is so partisan,  there can be no denying it.  He is tRump,s boy.
Trump and Epstein were on indictments raping children.. Your point?
Donald Trump’s response “So?”
You can bet that will be the direction of the Trump campaign from now on.   Demagoguery 101: Make the free press the enemy  Create bogeymen that only you can defeat
Will you ever get your head out of tRump’s ass?
Flynn was fired by tRump.  That was not made clear.
So let’s close the world up tight &amp; not continue to live our lives?? We can all cower in our basements like Biden did!   Such a true leader he is!!! 🙄   Thank God Trump didn’t do that or we would all b dead!  Vote Trump! 🇺🇸 Keep Biden in his cellar.😡
Please explain to me how Billionaire Donald Trump is in this presidency, for himself? The statement is comical! 🤣  Trump is trying to save America from democrats wanting Socialism, no law &amp; order, free benefits &amp;  no one has to work!  Let the gov take care of us!  Get Woke!
Trump would have to climb up a few levels of Hell to reach vile.
Trump's stream of unconsciousness at work again.
Doubt that Trump whose brain lies dormant most of the day could summon up enough cognitive ability to post anything.  My guess is that Kushner and Miller are behind most of this drivel.
Yes! VOTE BIDEN FOR PRESIDENT! Let’s fix what Trump broke! #Biden2020
Trump hasn’t the cognitive complexity to do this.  This is probably the work of Kushner.
My tweet was clear. You either do/don't believe protestors handed Trump an excuse on a silver platter. I simply made an assumption.  The second part was a direct question. I described the status quo  What is the end game? Feds take down the fence and leave?
Actually, I've never got an answer:  How does repeatedly targetting a fed courthouse since June 1st advance reforming state and local policing? But anyways. What's the end game? Feds remove fencing and simply leave? Trump will concede defeat? Already 4 facing 20 years.
You dispute that repeated targetting a fed courthouse from June 1st on didn't give Trump an excuse on a silver platter? Ok. Fine. Repeated frontal assaults on a fortified building, protected by an overwhelming force which is not about to abandon same  What's the end game?
Depise Trump. Charlottesville sickened me. Courthouse was targeted as far back as June 1st, long before reinforcements arrived. Portland covers 148 square miles, courthouse covers a blick. 4 protestors now face up to 20 years for assaulting a fed officers. I agree with NAACP.
Comparing the vandalizing a federal courthouse to the Holocaust is absolutely disgusting. Pictures below are from long before Trump's forces were gifted an excuse to arrive. "Kill cops" adjacent to "BLM" dishonors the memory of George Floyd.
So let me get this straight the #AAT’s (/anti-anti-Trump)are crying about  and our Allies for wanting to “ burn down Trump and the GOP”, but are willing to allow and encourage   to do it himself.
Trump is sociopathic.  No one expects him to act normally and no one thought he would rise to the level expected from the title he has.
Give her some slack.  Word around the water cooler is that she is pregnant with Trump’s next wife.
Trump bobble head day.
There are approximately 50M K-12 public school students. Trump Admin's $105 billion in Covid-related aid is $2,100 per student, $42K for each classroom of twenty.
If Diamond &amp; Silk performed their exact same routines in black face they would be permanently done within minutes. People don't "reflect on" why Trump's base find them entertaining?
You just had to hit Trump below the nipple didn't you? Abandoning the last shred of your journalistic integrity...
Trump hates people who have served their country because they are a constant reminder that he hid behind a fake bruised Fallopian tube in order to avoid serving.
Nadler waste of time and energy. He has a vendeta against President Trump which i believe he will never achieve what President Trump did with his life. Semper Fi Mark
Actually I'd go further and say I'm not sure I see an alternative to one. We could have avoided that months ago, but Trump happened. Now I'm not sure how we get around it.
President tRump said that it would just disappear. So you're saying that he's lying to the American people????!!!!!
If Trump approved it, it contains illegally dumped Chinese steel and aluminum; his favorite project materials.
If she insults your wife and father will you become her most devoted admirer the way your old boss did with Trump?
Trump thinks all mothers are a scam.  He only seeks approval from daddies.
Nothing else explains Haley's complete departure from reality and her distorted view of Trump's first and only term.
Hey,  if you want to begin censoring political ads, such as from  don’t be hypocritical and continue to let the racist, false, horrid drivel from Trump et al continue to play adnauseaum across your sites. Right now, you look like nothing but a Trump fanatic!
How did repeatedly targetting a fed courthouse even prior to Trump's forces arriving advance reforming of state/local policing? BTW Protestors couldn't have handed Mr. "Law and Order" a better talking point if they tried. Fed budget only $ 4.5 trillion. Trump's 'losing money".
Because Zuck's face is this color from being crammed too far up Donald Trump's rear-end, that's why.
Facebook needs to just go, shutdown, disappear, etc.. It has done nothing but slowly decay and destroy society, and just like Trump, their stance is “We take responsibility for nothing!”
What a DISGUSTING line up... All liars and Trump’s cult followers...
The best thing about America is that leadership has to change every 4 years. We are not so concerned about Trump as his days are numbered. We are more concerned about our burning west coast cities.
How does repeatedly targetting a federal courthouse (which began weeks m before the arrival of Trump's forces) advance reforming of state and local policing? BTW Congrats. Protestors couldn't have given Mr. "Law And Order" a better gift if they tried.
Portland police? Or you're claiming fed forces since "day one"?  Again: Courthouse repeatedly targeted prior to recent arrival of Trump's forces. How did targetting a fed courthouse advance reforming of state/local policing? Why clearly so hard a ? BTW Portland NAACP head is😉.
Sorry. Repeated targetting of courthouse began before arrival of Trump's forces. But of course you can state how targetting a fed property advances reforming state/local policing? Admittedly it did nicely hand Trump an excuse on a silver platter. Good strategy. Nice "spectacle,"
We no longer recognize our country. Trump and Putin are stroking each other over the phone.
♫Move to the stage where the man waddles out on small feet There's a podium and a white haired man And he starts to sing  Telling you and me It's Trump, Donald Trump Say Donald Trump's Traveling Medicine Show  Holy, Holy
Purposefully ignoring the question. Protestors repeatedly trashed a fed courthouse prior to Trump's forces arriving. Handing Trump an excuse and a continuing talking point. But I'm all ears. Again: how is trashing a fed courthouse connected to reforming state/local policing?
An equally valid "perspective". The fed courthouse. What literally trashing it has do with reforming state/local policing honestly escapes me. It was repeatedly targeted long before Trump's forces arrived. Though protestors nicely handed Trump an excuse on a silver platter.
Waiting for Trump to defend not sending FEMA to Hawaii because they're an island surrounded by water.
Exactly. Arrest and injury will invariably be the end and BBC basically only result. Again, the courthouse was repeatedly targeted prior to the arrival of Trump's forces. How is trashing a federal courthouse connected to reforming state/local policing? Sincerely interested.
Again, courthouse was a target long before Trump's forces arrived. What connection did/does it have to reforming state/local policing? Are protestors not handing Trump an excuse/talking point on a silver platter? Are real battlegrounds not now Statehouses/city council meetings?
There is a virus for which Trump is patient zero that attacks the prefrontal cortex and causes people to sound like half-wits.
Portland covers 418 square miles. Federal courthouse covers one block. Protestors are handing Trump an excuse/continuing "Law And Order" talking point on a silver platter. Repeatedly targetting a fed courthouse has what connection to reforming state/local policing?
Has Trump wished him well in the afterlife yet?
Wasn’t it Republicans who vehemently stated it would be Democrats that created death councils/committees?! Isn’t it a tad ironic that it is due to Republican actions, looking at you Trump &amp; McConnell, that death councils are now becoming an actual thing?
A. Do you want to line up at the Trump Rx POP-UP station pay a $50 copay (in addition to the $300 fee Trump Inc will charge your insurance company (Trump)OR B: able to go to your Dr ,clinic, Drug Store, school, Workplace, town hall etc to get it FREE of charge (BIDEN)
Think of the meals that could be provided to homeless vets using just the money it cost American taxpayers for Trump's Secret Service lodgings at his properties while he waddles around the golf course.
Trump said he was in favor of the parents of privileged children to pay other kids to go to in person classes for them.
I think Trump is actually a hologram created by the same people who reanimated Tupac at Coachella.  No real human could be this whacked.
Know you know which was why I asked why fed courthouse became a target, more importantly why they now won't leave it alone? Sad reality is truism "It's all just fun &amp; games until someone gets hurt". They will and are now knowingly providing footage for WH briefings and Trump ads.
Asking why courthouse was repeatedly targeted prior to Trump's forces arriving isn't splitting hairs. Highly relevant as it handed Trump an excuse on a silver platter. Portland covers 400M+ sq. miles. Leave fed properties alone = feds have no jurisdiction. But also no excitement.
We can likely agree there's politics on both sides. E.g. Trump recentky announced $105B in Covid-19 aid to schools,  $2,100+/- per student,  $45K per average elementary school classroom. Even discussed as to potential increased risk mitigation?
Agreed, but Inauguration Day can’t come even faster. I imagine the world will never have seen an angrier, more destructive entity with gobs of power, than Trump if he loses in November. Lots can be wraught between Nov. and Jan. :-(
For the love of God! These people saying this extra $600 in unemployment is making people not want to go back to work, are morons. You know what’s making people not want to go back to work?!? A deadly virus Trump et al ingnored and fanned the flames of through inaction!
Neither defended Trump admin nor criticized those stating schools should stay closed until COVID-19 is "under control" in U.S. MA isn't FL,  risk profiles of elementary and high schools aren't the same. Local decisions based on local conditions and sound science. Not politics.
Steve.. Haley keeps praising Trump simply because Biden will select an amazing Woman As his VP.. Trump will pivot and dump Pence and put Haley on his ticket as VP.. so predictable....
Documents of Trump raping 13 year old along with Epstein being released...
Trump is at least 1 and a 1/2 times the man that Redford will ever be. 😉
What I find surprising is the number of businesses with Trump signs out. How dumb can they be? I'm sure there are a lot of people like me who refuse to shop at such places.....
Well, for four months Redfield has looked like a bobble head doll stand next to Trump.  Why would anyone give gravitas to anything he says?
Lying with ease is the primary prerequisite for serving in the Trump administration.
Trump resents the men and women who show the desire and courage to serve simply because he possesses neither.  He’s a coward who hid behind an alleged bruised Fallopian tube and compared avoiding STDs to combat duty in Vietnam.
Didn’t Trump use sports to espouse his political views or did the whole vilification and blacklisting of Colin Kaepernick not happening?
Obviously in either a Trump owned or Trump supporter own property and we the taxpayers are footing the bill! The money better be coming out of the DOJ’s budget! And when they run out..too bad! No more
Can someone please find and post the video of Trump complaining about how much golf President Obama played!
For those who feel our country is slowly devolving into a fascist, dystopian state, I have news for you. It is here and now. We're in it. Trump is in a "nothing to lose" mode.
This is the hate Trump fosters and feeds off of.  Trump is smugly satisfied only when he can get a segment of Americans to hate another segment of Americans. He is everything we are taught as children not to be.
He’s always been a Trump supporter
“It’s going to disappear.” D. Trump “We have it totally under control. It’s one person coming in from China,..." Donald Trump “Looks like by April, you know, in theory, when it gets a little warmer, it miraculously goes away.” D. Trump "like a miracle, it will disappear.” D.Trump
Doesn't interest Trump.  Secretly Trump resents people who have the courage and dedication to serve in the military because he had neither the courage or the desire to serve.
please stop running the Fear mongering, lying Trump campaign ads. You know what  means when he says defund the policy. Have some integrity FFS.
Reporter's account and AOC's conflicts. Anyways the the dispute was about spiking crime rates. House is doing what to assist States/Cities while also hopefully displacing Trump's forces? Will concede Yoho/AOC more important than Portland, Chicago, NYC, etc.
Absolutely historic. Unfortunately Trump wasn't available to administer the oath of office.
Trump wasn't available to personally swear you into office?
Sadly they even saved the GOP production costs. Trump et al couldn't have hoped for better.
You nailed it. "My pitch is faster than Fauci's pitch". Trump's still stuck in 4th grade.
Trump will always resent the men and women who possessed the desire and courage to serve in the military because he knows he possessed neither.
The money that funds Social Security and Medicare... so yeah, the Democrats are against cutting it.  And BTW, many Republicans were against it also.  You're hurting all Americans by your inaction on the Trump Virus.
Anyone overhear him besides a reporter even that perhaps accidentally? As far as his response, then hers, admittedly haven't followed. To me typical D.C. Original topic was spikes in crime. Actions House is taking to assist NYC, Chicago, Portland, etc.and displace Trump's forces?
Forget wages which are typically last to rise. Trump's "Greatest Economy Ever" had GDP growth under your 2.2% (2.1%) from July-December of 2019. At least better than Trump's dismal Q4 2018. Source: Trump Administration.
Almost adult Cosplay? Repeatedly graffiting same building hands Trump excuses and continuing talking points on a silver platter. Nearly 2 months after Floyd's  murder battlegrounds are now state houses/city council meetings. Granted streets more exciting.
What accouts for the lack of outrage from members of Congress and the House speaker?  Are they waiting for Trump to sign a new stimulus package?  Nothing else explains it.
If only.  At this point I’d vote for the carrot in my refrigerator before I’d vote for Trump. Unlike Trump the carrot is actually beneficial to my health.
I love that the GOP is starting to fracture. They deserve it.  I won't sympathize with any of them as they all are enabling the trash trump. #GestapoTrump #Biden2020  #MoscowMitch
143,000 DEAD AMERICANS UNDER TRUMP! 1,000 DEATHS DAILY! Leadership Failure under Trump!
The thing to bear in mind is that Trump was bragging about his score on Fox whose demographic is comprised mostly of people who have taken a dementia test and 25% of them remember taking the test and identify with Trump.
The thing to bear in mind is that Trump was bragging about his score on Fox whose demographic is comprised mostly of people who have taken a dementia test and 25% of them remember taking the test and identify with Trump.
Did you listen to Trump’s news conference yesterday on the virus.  He said this new escalation was from the protesters.  REALLY,  New York, New Jersry, Ma etc.  had bigger marches than most.  Their virus numbers are way way down.
is taking on the whole deep state cabal for the 🇺🇸 ppl and those around the world who seek freedom..The #AmericanDream is coming back ladies and gents..I cannot wait..Trump will deliver..but he needs our help to push back against the deep state scumbags
This simply cannot be our reality:  a self-proclaimed "stable genius" of a president boasting about remembering 5 words. Every single day Trump digs the ditch even deeper.
Valid point. Repeatedly graffitiiing same courthouse, tearing down same fencing accomplishes little regarding policing reform. Portland covers 148 square miles. By not leaving fed properties alone  protestors are handing Trump a continuing talking point on a silver platter.
Yesterday's remarks categorized as "Healthcare", today's "Law and Justice". A tell. Trump's forces lack jurisdiction except for fed properties and investigating crimes against same. Protestors indeed  handing Trump an excuse and a continuing talking point on a silver platter.
Come on you know in your heart that Trump is a complete cretin and will do more harm to the country and political process if he wins reelection.
By far one of the most fucked up things that Trump and his party do is try to blame Democrats/liberals for things that Trump himself is responsible for. Until the stock market goes up - then it’s Trump again. The stupidity here is incredible.
This literally is Donald Trump's America. Right now. Today. Damn, man, how are you this bad at this?
Trump can't remember what he did before breakfast, so I don't expect him to remember his numerous conversations with Woody.
Lindsey, it's 2020.  No one cares that you play for the other team, so don't let Trump blackmail you anymore with those pictures from Mar-a-Lago.  Lot's of people sing YMCA in their hotel rooms dressed as a shirtless biker.
I think she secretly suffers from hybristophilia and hopes she can arrange conjugal visits with Trump at Rikers.
Yeah, either they're trying to sabotage Trump or they think members of the Covfefe Cult are as astonishingly undereducated and gullible as we think they are.
Simply avoid federal buildings/ properties and they will have absolutely no jurisdiction. No reason to hand Trump excuses and continuing talking points on a silver platter.
He doesn’t care about anyone except himself and anything except the bottom line of Trump Inc.
Howie, Remember when you had your fans guessed how many times Ted Kennedy said um when speaking. How about a new game where people guess a how many times Trump lies during one of his press events.
He’ll fit right in the Trump administration.
Levin is like the guy, who when all the evidence proves he overpaid boasts that he screwed the dealer when he bought his new car. Admitting that he is the mark in Trump’s grift is unthinkable because then he’d have to admit his gullibility and naïveté.
The Covfefe Cult has always been chronologically challenged.  Something to do with general relativity and the fact that the closer you get to Trump the slower your watch runs.Don’t absolve Cain of responsibility. Trump put people in danger but Cain went to the danger willingly. His death is sad and tragic.  But actions have consequences.
Biden said it months ago that Trump was gonna pull this shit- And 🌟🌟SURPRISE🌟🌟 He did! Even Republicans Said NO delaying or postponing It was NEVER done through wars &amp; all It's NOT gonna happen now!!
If everything Trump says that has to be defended later by every right wing pundit and everyone that works for him because “he didn’t mean it “ or he was “just kidding”. His ball busting is just as horrible as him being president and he needs to just... Eat some demon semen...
Unfortunately, Herman Cain was murdered by Donald Trump.
There will be zero Presidents at Trump's funeral, and that includes Trump. He's no President.
So, as my son pointed out, under the 20th amendment  ‘s term ends on January 20th. Delaying the election would not extend his term. ( my son has read the constitution way more than Trump has).
Did Trump teach you that ?
Ur going to lose Trump !!!! Vote blue or anyone other than Trump
Ur going down Trump we and I DONT LIKE UR LIEING *SS
Trump only puts Trump first. #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica
I really can't believe that Trump doesn't bring him up more often You know that was what did it
President Trump needs to outlaw anyone wearing a mask in public for good. Too many of these SCUMBAGS are getting away w/ all kinds of crime w/out being able to be identified covering up for their crimes. Covid19=HOAX!
Er - the US doesn’t have “an approach”, a “plan”, “testing”, “tracing”, marshalling of resources.  Trump’s plan? Live (or die) with it.  So, obviously, there’s nothing to reset.
Half and half Trump is a monster that wants to destroy the ACA. We have to have some debate though the ACA doesn’t mean insurance for all and millions of Americans are still uninsured under the ACA. We should be able to have #M4A which is feasible.
He is right! trump has killed our democracy!
Trump has no respect for the law???? Remember when you lied on your bar exam application??? Just in case you forgot.
This is all on Trump! Trump can’t spin death.

The Trump/GOP attack on the USPS is outrageous and we won’t stand for it. That’s why democratic leadership is insisting on aid for USPS in the COVID Relief Bill.
If Republicans had removed Trump from office they could have had all their judges and simmered down the blue tsunami coming in November. Live by the sword, die by the sword.

I would love to be a fly on the wall when Clinton, Bush, and Obama are together in private.  I'd love to hear their REAL thoughts about Trump!!!!

Trump is throwing a temper tantrum inside the White House right now.
Mr. President trump as the president who’s claim he’s improved the economy let me help some more. To make this the best economy in the world you’re going to have to heavily tax the rich  so that money can flow into poor communities and raise their property value
Too much winning, Huh Trump?
Hearing 3 REAL Presidents is sooooooooooooo refreshing. Gives me hope!!!!  How did we ever sink to the level of voting Trump into office????
I’m sure you are working on a corrupt way to use it to your advantage.  Worst president ever!!!  Trump for prison 2020.
Obama does not  need a teleprompter or script like Trump. He actually speaks from the heart
It's amazing how Trump can dictate the new story of the day or week.
This is why Trump left it up to the states because Trump didn't want to break his oath to the Constitution as easily as the Democrats were.
“‘Never in the history of the country, through wars, depressions, and the Civil War have we ever not had a federally scheduled election on time, and we’ll find a way to do that again this Nov. 3,’ Mr. McConnell said.”  Small mercies.
Boy! Trump looks pretty scared and nervous. But, that’s what happens when your a 3 yr old.
No no. Not the covid virus.. the Trump Virus 🦠
The issue is he’s one of these white guys that is very nice to those in his circle but claims Democrats will tax him more (yet he’s working class), so Trump is better. And despite being “nice” is inexplicably unphased by all the evil shit.
. does not have the power himself to move the date of the 2020 #election, which was set by an 1845 federal law placing it the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November.
#IReclaimMyTime  Democrats lost my vote.  now it is possible for Trump to Win in 2020 Why are the Democrats trying to throw the 2020 Election? Biden Trump Bernie  Kamala
Knowing there are people there voting for Trump just to make “the libs” angry or to “get revenge” for having had a Black president makes me sad for humanity. They don’t support Trump for what he does FOR them but because they take pleasure in the evil he does TO others.
Anyone who has common sense, critical thinking ability and understands Trump wants to be a "King"(or tyrant(however you want to address it up)). He is a psychopath, no different than the ELITES' who put him into office.
LOL, it's just too easy for Trump to bait Nancy. She fell for it Hook, line and sinker. As you can see Trump asked it as a question he didn't say he would change the date because he knows he can't but now the question of it being changed is now open for debate.
Trolls have no power. They try to gain power by messing with people.   Trump has power. So by definition he can’t be a troll. He is a dangerous man and it would be foolhardy to write him off as a powerless troll.   The sick fuck has caused a lot of death with his words already.
Did Trump say he would change the election day or did he ask a question? I love how you all use this Dictator bs with no real proof of him being a dictator. It makes me laugh.
“He attended Trump’s disastrous   rally before coming down with symptoms?” Wow.
And for you, it’s TIMES UP. No more trump rallies, big guy.
Yeah, Trump read a poem a few years back stating: " I am  snake", people who droll over him missed that memo!  My opine.
President Trump cited concerns over election fraud and mail-in voting.
So Trump killed his former rival Herman Cain through his incompetence and insistence on a no mask rally.  Think he feels guilty?
I do wish his family well, and hope they find comfort in their grief. It must be pointed out though that he attended Trump’s Tulsa rally last month, where few wore masks and signs on seats encouraging distancing were all removed prior to the event.
But, how can he die from a hoax? I feel bad for his family, but he was a friggin’ idiot who put his faith in trump. If an idiot puts his health in the hands of another, bigger idiot, the results are foreseeable.
If you thought he was arrogant before this..  Trump floats November election delay - but he can't do that
Trump's fascist coup is progessing as planned
Ms Carpenter, do you have any idea why people cower to Trump???? What is it about him that prominent people are so afraid of????  I can't figure it out.  Maybe I'm missing something but he doesn't seem very smart.
I am loathe to retweet President Trump, but I can already hear the defense of his tweet now: "He's simply asking a question! It's not like him saying this will lead to some states trying to actually delay the election! He's just curious if it could be done!"
. is an idiot!
With Clinton, Bush, and Obama attending the funeral of John Lewis, and Obama giving the eulogy, it was inevitable that Trump was going to say something outrageous. He can't have Obama in the news cycle.
Trump installed an ally as postmaster general in an attempt to screw everything up. Dems are asking for a lot of money in the new aid package to fix it. R's are holding it up
Congress could delay the election, did Trump say he would delay the election? No, as you can see he put it out as a question .

Ugh, dilemma. My sister got engaged (somewhat unexpectedly) to her Trump voter boyfriend who will mostly likely vote for Trump again and his whole circle is Trump supporters. Hoping they break up before the nuptials and if not, pray for divorce.
There’s only one reason for this, Trump touts HCQ that it works. That’s all they needed to hear, that makes it a bad drug and anyone touting it as not knowing what they’re talking about.
What state and what city did this happen in? Bet it's Democratic run. Trump has offered help to any state that has the protests get out of control if these states deny the help this all falls on them.
I bet this happened in a Democratic run state with a Democratic Mayor and now you try to blame Trump and not the people who run the state.

How many times and how many warnings did Trump have to give? This now puts all other nations that aren't paying that agreement of 2% they made on notice. It doesn't mean we are leaving NATO.
Neil what you haven't figured out is this is Trump playing politics, he led with his best hand "If countries don't pay their way we will leave NATO" then 2 years later he pulls out of Germany forcing them to pay the 2%.

Run Trump the Rump out of WH, send him rolling down the Lawn; #America doesn't want him, give him a Ticket to MoscowLand
No I don't think so either, Trump used saying we will pull out of NATO as a negotiation, there was a big if to that pulling out, the IF was if they don't start paying their way and stop sucking off the American people.

As if Trump has ever BEEN in a suburb. 😒
Trump is sending storm troopers to Detroit, instead.
Trump is trying to make these NATO countries keep to the agreement they signed and actually make it where our soldiers aren't the police of the world whenever NATO gets involved in a conflict. Good luck in November because he will still be your President.

Hilary is the reason trump is in office and Biden is the reason he will be re-elected.   Our options are very grim this time around too.  We shouldn’t have to vote for the lesser of two evils.   Hopefully 2024 will produce better options.

ANTIFA is the military of the Left now. Why else would they deny the violence or denounce them? Simple, they’re using them to show the country the consequences of 4 more years of Trump. If he wins these riots will be in every major D city the next day. Guaranteed
These aren’t Leftists anymore. It’s the Left. Dems are denying the violence because ANTIFA is now their military. They’ve unleashed them to intimidate voters and show the country what 4 more years of Trump will look like if he wins. This is  the new mainstream Left
Trump probably already promised the weaponry to Saudi Arabia.
Trump winning will not surprise me. The DNC is losing the young base and this Biden and Trump is gonna be a showdown to the last state.....new battleground state Texas, Pennsylvania and Florida

Trump Bends To Reality, Buckles Under Political Pressure
Careful Gary, can't say Trump's name without someone making similarities to Biden 🤦🏼‍♂️. It's time for people to realize to blame those that are spoken of, instead of making them less evil by comparison. You simply spoke of Trump, let's talk Trump. Guess that's hard for some to do.
Trump 2020 is boring and has no platform.
Joe, you are contributing to the violence around the country by not speaking out against it. Have some guts, or are you afraid to be "canceled out". Trump has our back - not you.
If only there was some way of knowing a trump presidency would a corrupt endeavor, other than looking at his business dealings, political allies, personal life, etc...
Bannon told us all that Trump was the blunt instrument being used to deconstruct - that is to say destroy - the federal government infrastructure. Nothing is more key than USPS, but you can also see this with State, Justice, EPA.  And oh yeah, this is not only bad, it’s dangerous
Just remember that in 2016 a lot of you voted for Trump as a joke… Do not do the same for Kanye!

There’s A Major Scandal Brewing In Trump’s Kodak Pharmaceutical Award
Ever heard of the Trump virus????
I’ve watched the HCQ story since before Elon and Trump caught wind. It works when given early. This is the rule with antivirals ...not the exception.  But government is a generic drug neutralizing racket. Always building regulatory grease for less effective patented compounds.
Trump said that it would work. Half of the u.s.a (liberals) went mental. Good luck
Not sure where you are getting that 56% number. Mom of 3, voting for Biden and NOT sending my kids to school during this pandemic with Trump as president.  My kids will not be sacrificed.
Mel there's still time to delete this  Yes Trump and his family sucks.  But they even said this was supposed to symbolize equality and the BLM movement beforehand...
Top story: Trump Might Try to Postpone the Election. That’s Unconstitutional.  see more
Trump is setting himself up to wake up the day after and launch a scorched earth "toldja so" campaign to get the results thrown out. He will stoke the rage of his pandemic-addled base, encouraging the boogaloos to march on state capitals and provoking more street violence. /2
C'mon,  Trump does *not* want to ban vote-by-mail, and he does not want to move the date of the election. He wants us to vote on Nov 3, and he wants *lots* of us to vote by mail. This is all about Operation November the Fourth. /1
trump and the Republican clowns have sent the economy down the sewer. #AmericaStrongerWithBiden
The importance of what  says here cannot be overstated. Any discussion of Trump's attacks on vote-by-mail or any other electoral process that does not focus on Operation November the 4th is doing the country a grave disservice.
Herman Cain either died by suicide brought on by stupidity,  or was killed by Trump. Take your pick. #TrumpVirusDeathToll150K
I guess we have different perspectives on that one. As bad as wills may get he will never compare to trump. A meglomaniacal wannabe dictator. At least i hope. I saw what he said as simpleton bs not as racist. Did we see a POC as the uber driver? No. JMO 1/2
Your numbers are a bit off, Dear.
They do it all the time and I can't blame them because it works. I think any token resistance Romney puts up to Trump is 100% party approved so that in 4 years they can trot him out for president again and say "Look, we've always been opposed to Trumpism" and they'd win
Hey, kids! "Dr. Trump, TV Epidemiologist" is on!!
Trump pretends a LOT!
Virus killed him, no masks was due to Trump.
To be fair, would Lewis have really wanted Trump talking about ratings, saying racist shit, and generally embarrassing everyone?

Opinion | Trump's tweet about delaying the election was intended to make us ignore the horrible economic numbers - The Washington Post
All Trump needs is a handful of sycophant Govs to delay their elections to sow chaos, and manufacture a crisis.  Imagine GA, FL, NC, AZ  all postpone, and Biden gets to 267 electoral votes on Nov 3.
Trump/gop policies continue to increase deaths.They WANT people to die off to keep control over all.  We can't sit back and watch like a DP that sabotaged the one politician capable of pulling us out of this terrifying mess.  They rig &amp; offer weak unfit Biden. We can't cave. Act.
The only reason not to pick Warren is a tactical one. Our governor here in Ma is still a republican. No matter how much Baker hates Trump, having another R in the senate could be dangerous if the numbers are close. Personally I love her and voted for her in our primary.
One less vote for Trump. I'm guessing his rallies are going to cause a lot of that.
Listen. Trump does not want to move the date of the election. He does not want to eliminate vote-by-mail. He very much wants *other* people to want those things. This is Operation November the Fourth.   He expects to lose. /1
So out of all things to worry about in this world rn Trump wants to delay the election????????????
Listening to President Obama is such a breath of fresh air after these past four years.   It doesn’t surprise me that Trump is the worst president possible in the 21st century, it just stresses me out thinking how much more damage his administration can and will do.  Soon. VOTE!!
Bush was so happy Trump got elected so he could be rehabbed like Reagan was.
Republicans resistance to Trump's vileness, corruption, and divisiveness has been underwhelming. Republicans could stop their strategy of disenfranchisement. Or pass bills to protect our elections from foreign intervention. Pass the #JohnLewisVotingRightsAct you cowards!
Donald Trump should resign. Pass it on.
Now do the part about how you'll handle Trump's "toldja so" 4th of November operation to get the results overturned. He doesn't really want the date changed, you ninny, anymore than he really wants to ban mail-in voting. He wants excuses to reject the outcome.
Your fragile ego and gross incompetence led to his death.  You lie about the severity of Trump Virus, hold super-spreader rallies, and people die.  But then again, 152,000 deaths means nothing to you.  You are responsible for these deaths.

You are only saying this because you hope to remain above the law yourself. I'd be worried if I were you. Trump is only this loyal to followers who have more on him than he does on them. That's not you, Lindsey. You're disposable.
It's sweet, though, that well after he knew Cain, the former CEO of Godfather's Pizza, had died, Trump tweeted a glowing endorsement for a Trumper who runs a pizza joint. Guess which of those tweets it's more likely Trump actually wrote himself?
You congratulated a Trump supporting Pizzeria owner hours before acknowledging that Cain, the former CEO of Godfather's Pizza and also a supporter, died of a disease he caught attending your wantonly dangerous and unnecessary rally.

We need to go out and vote and ensure that Trump is voted out of office, but, considering the fact he said he will ignore the results of the election, we're gonna need to do more than vote and protest; revolution is very possibly coming my friends

Trump floats idea of delaying the November election, a power granted to Congress, as he ramps up attacks on voting…
Mike Pompeo just testified under oath that *Barr* will decide if Trump—despite having no constitutional authority to do so—can *announce* he's moving the election.  Read that multiple times and then retweet this. We're witnessing a historic threat to rule of law.  Keep this going
Trump's attacks on the election must - MUST - always be framed first and foremost as tactical moves in Operation November the Fourth. He doesn't want to move the election or to ban mail-in voting. He wants those things to happen so he can wake the next day and reject the results.
Thank you,  Have you read Gary Hart's recent op-ed about presidential emergency powers? Please read &amp; share with your colleagues and begin an investigation asap regarding the scope of these powers and how they might impact the election.
Trump wants to delay the November election until  - to use  his word -   it's "safe" . Presumably he means "safe" for him. For the rest of the country the word to be applied is "disastrous". Witness the pandemic. He must not be allowed to get away with this insanity!
If even ONE Senator or Representative, Republican or Democrat says, We'll look into this, you WILL resign. There is NO looking into it..its a law! Trump cannot change a law. Stop enabling this fascist pig.
goes into trump crime family pockets?
the gop is in with Trump and Putin.
Trump is too busy ignoring the John Lewis memorial to post anything about Herman Cain.
Do these cheating rules apply to Colorado, Hawaii, Washington State, Oregon and the whole Trump family who vote by mail everytime? Just asking for the rest of America. On November 3, 3020 #Biden2020ToSaveAmerica will win.
anyone still in denial about trump working for putin?
Safe? Presumably Trump  means  safe for him . Clearly  it would  be totally unsafe - ie disastrous - for the rest of the country!
Trump proposes to delay federal elections until it's 'safe'
Mail-in voting is not fraudulent, but Trump is!  Evidently you are as well!  It is far safer than the alternative, especially during this pandemic.
While Trump is distracting us by talking about delaying the election:
Its so weird, the way they dance just screams black trump supporters. Lmfao. Cornballs.
Herman Cain is dead from Covid-19. Donald Trump killed him! Please, everyone, come to your senses.   How many need to die for Donald Trump?
Yes that’s where all Trump supporters should go.  Their values are the opposite of what being an American is all about. #BlackLivesMatter #WeAreAmericans

Regardless of flare-ups in other countries, the TRUMP VIRUS is worse in this country, and continues to grow out of control.  Your incompetence and greed got us to where we are. #TrumpVirus
But Trump can't.
And there it is...This is why Trump has done little to stop the spread of COVID-19 and has even taken steps to worsen the pandemic. He will use this pandemic to pressure governors &amp; Congress to delay the election, at which point our descent into fascism will be complete.
Thank you for standing up to Trump, but we need to do a lot more to protect our elections from foreign interference and to fight voter suppression tactics.
Donald Trump should resign. Pass it on.
What are you doing to protect our Election from attacks from Russia, China and other countries? Very little has been done since 2016 because Trump and the Republicans have no desire to have fair elections.
Trump will be fine with it, he loves "acting" appointments!
We both know why Gerry. Trump won 4 years ago. They failed to have him impeached, so they waited for his last year of term 1 to cause anarchy before the election. They care more about getting him out, than they do about the health of the country.
they (Republicans) just decided to use Trump the same way he uses others. honestly they sold their soul long before Trump.
BOTH parties made Trump possible.
It’s really good news if tRump is on it.

We can do it now.  See
Not suggesting that if anyone chose not to go public with their stories that they are not telling the truth if they did now, of course (I hope that’s clear). I just would have expected SOMEONE to have brought Trump’s name up with specific accusations by now.
3. Using a foreign government to influence his elections. The dude has commended Putin and Kim Jong for God’s sakes.  4. Using his platform to ridicule the media while they are only exercising their first amendment rights. 5. Trump was literally IMPEACHED for abuse of power.
Trump Might Try to Postpone the Election. That’s Unconstitutional.
I sorta believe this in my gut as well. It doesn’t make sense to me why ANY other victims of Epstein wouldn’t have come forward accusing Trump when many of the others accusing Trump did, or when people started going more public with Epstein accusations.
Got that right!  See
Jim, admit it ... ALL YOUR HEADS BLEW UP. Trump fucks with you all the time, and you ALL fall for it.
The Republican governor from MA responding to President Trump:
How Dare You RUDY!  The teachers in this Country are the backbone of our society. Just because you represent an Imbecile aka TRUMP, DO NOT Disparage the Un-sung Heroes of our Country. 👇
Remember when Trump said "I could stand in the middle of Fifth ave and shoot someone and not lose voters" Well, he's killed over 150 Mill now and not lost voters.
"Postal employees and union officials say the changes implemented by Trump fundraiser-turned-postmaster general Louis DeJoy are contributing to a growing perception that mail delays are the result of a political effort to undermine absentee voting."
President Trump
Trump still thinks it’s a very nice shark, good people.
Biden.  Leading.  See
Been trying to get back into twitter and unfortunately had to start cleaning up who I'm following. Two things I honestly have no time for:  1. Those that still support Trump (I understand if people may have at one point years ago)  2. Coronavirus denial &amp; conspiracy bullshit
Remember when everyone was hype about Trump being evicted?
This is outrageous! Hold Trump and every Republican who does not denounce this accountable by voting them from office.  Postal Service backlog sparks worries that ballot delivery could be delayed in November

The LP is run, staffed and supported by a bunch of ruthless fothermuckers and America absolutely needs everyone one (1) of them at the top of their Trump-ass-kicking game right now.  Go, LP!
McConnell can’t get the votes for his own relief bill. You think we can get 20 GOP votes to convict Trump?

The only thing that was disappointing is that your #tinyhands weren't underneath each and everyone of their knees. Your a small man with a small mind and a small .... BTW, #BunkerBoy Trump just isnt into you.
TRUMP, as usual is preparing us for the Chaos planned for 3 November by his team and PUTIN...
#trump knows nothing ... #trump learns nothing ... #trump does nothing ... 150,000 dead ...
Trump thinks he’s a star. He thinks he’s the best thing since sliced bread.  “Waaaah why do people like Fauci but not meeeee?! Waaaah!”   Because Fauci actually uses science and medical reasoning while Trump employs a secretary of Education that’s never worked a day in a school.
Please, go on.   Then tell me all the ways Trump is different in supporting the military. I’ll wait 😂
Hah. So funny and soooo true. Trump sucks.
NOT TRUMP TRYING TO DELAY THE ELECTION IS THIS REAL LIFE??? HE CANT DO THAT RIGHT

Last time I checked ... October 2019 ... The #trump administration owed the United Nations ... $1 billion ... He always has ulterior motives ... This one is again ... to help ... #putin ...
There is ‘Presidential Lack of Leadership 101.’  Dumb Donnie holds a rally and doesn’t wear a mask, do you really think a high ranking member of the Trump Party would wear a mask if the Devine Leader didn’t?
“TRUMP/PENCE: believe it or not, America can be even worse than it is right now so vote for us even though we screwed it up.”  Paid for by the Campaign to Gaslight America.
The pettiness of the Trump family focuses on revenge for not enough praise and/or shifting blame.
I heard Baron's school isn't opening up. Maybe Trump should send his DHS goons to the school to make them reopen?
Trump doesn’t want science to get in the way of reopening the schools.  He doesn’t want CDC guidance to get in the way of opening the schools.  He caused the deaths of tens of thousands of Americans.  Don’t let him kill your kids.  #TrumpHatesScience
If Trump was not President, Herman Cain would not be dead. If Hillary Clinton were president, Herman Cain would have been wearing a mask.
THE AMERICAN PPL SHOULD NOT BE PUNISHED CUS OF TRUMP’S SLOW TOURTOISE RESPONSE TO COVID AND HIS INACTIONS. Anyone who doesn’t agree with this isn’t a true American and u have no idea what the reality is for the majority nor do u care.
You cant even pick a running mate. Youre about as competent as Trump.
Obama compares segregationist Jim Crow America to Trump's America – as it happened
Trump has blood on his hands.
Blocked him regardless tho, I don’t suffer Trump supporters or COVID conspiracy theorists lol.
Trump is that kid you hated playing games with because they always changed the rules so they would maybe win.
As a country, we all need to come together to get Trump out.  Welcome  and thank you for your announcement.
Trump's stance toward Putin undermines diplomacy in ex-Marine's case, says former Amb.
You didn’t honor him with your speech ... it was a hate speech again Trump and the Republicans. You FRAUD!
Seems like Trump is trying to insure as big a dem majority as possible.  Trump/OAN/KKK  News is going to be lit.  If Tucker isn't racist enough for you. C'mon over to the Stephen Miller white power hour at 9.
Epstein was banned from mar-a-lago. Probably makes sense why the past 3 years trump has been fighting against child trafficking.
Trump has no message - he is a total failure. #150KDead #VoteBlue

Donald Trump and the voters have placed you on the Democrat garbage heap -where you will soon be joined by Joey Biden and whoever else y’all roll out ...
4D chess: Trump agrees to Democrats’ national moratorium on evictions, loses election, refuses to move out...BAM, Prez4Life!!!
I wouldn't ignore it either Chris. Please watch this quick video. I believe Justin King  is on to something. Trump is not a regular president, he's a wounded fascist. He's showing his hand.
In 2017, Eric Trump’s visit to a Trump building under construction in Uruguay cost taxpayers $97,000.” Last September, the Secret Service also put in a bid to buy Jet Skis, so that federal agents could protect the Trump family off the shore of Mar-a-Lago.
Another murder by tRump
The thing about Trump is that he is extremely evil but also extremely fucking stupid.
Especially critical when it comes to flipping the senate! Even if everything went to hell and Trump got re-elected, a Democratic majority senate would make a world of difference.
For a second there I thought you might address R voter suppression, or McConnell’s refusal to deal with Russian interference, but those are probably “partisan issues” to you.  In the old days we were all Americans.  It took trump to decide those who disagree “hate America”.
Chances are pretty good that he died for a trump hate rally. At least he didn’t have to wear a mask. #TrumpPandemic
July 30 - part 3 IA - Federalist Society guy says Trump should be impeached DC - McConnell sends Senate home for weekend (it)p’s Thursday) with no relief bill IA - Ghislaine Maxwell documents unsealed
Trump fear tactics and Kool Aid.
In another tweet worth repeating: "Trump having fun with the laser pointer watching the pearl clutchers chase the red dot."
Trump cannot be fighting for an authorized treatment for covid19. FDA authorizes drugs for x with strict instructions. FDA will not authorize laxative for treating malaria.
Jared Kushner and by extension Donald Trump were willing to sacrifice the lives of HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS of Americans just to make Democratic governors look bad.  This is sociopathic.  It is fucking inhuman.

Remember when Trump talked "bullshit" and politics at a friggen boy scout jamboree?
He seemed like a great guy. His downfall was trusting in impeached president* trump, who killed him in Tulsa.   #TrumpPandemic
I used to think just mentioning the name Rush Limbaugh would put liberals into orbit. But for the past 4 years the Trump name sends these left-holes seeking Uranis. The Trump derangement syndrome should be listed in the DSM.
Why is trump pushing a legal drug? I don’t see him pushing asprin, Tylenol. They are prescribed for covid19 to reduce pain, right? Why is trump not pushing disinfectants for treating covid19? I am not saying you lack logic skills but anyone would as you equate equador to USA
Barack Obama,   Go home to your multi million Martha's Vineyard home please!  Stay out of politics.  You've never helped the black race by promises promises and then never help them get and stay out of poverty.   Always feeding them lies. Trump 2020!!!
This is Trump’s America 2020 in a nutshell!
I would rather chew glass then sit to this fiasco.
Most of what Trump has done since his first acquittal is grounds for impeachment.   don’t have the courage to act. America, remember the enablers and remove them. Their UN-AMERICAN.
Leave it to this windbag to politicize Herman Cain's death by invoking a Trump rally to allege, without verification, that Cain contracted coronavirus from his presence there. The amorality of some political consultants knows no bounds.
Why because it’s something Trump is doing? I’m assuming it’s a bad thing for the USA to make its own meds here
trump is literally going to do whatever he can to stay in presidency and it’s fucking terrifying
Good, nobody wants to see Trump let alone hear him speak.
Until we elected Trump.  Now we’re a joke.

Consider it illegal now. Why is Trump and this moron pushing a legal drug? Lawyerly question?
Looks like Trump’s approach of making obviously exaggerated claims has reached my local pizza place
She is worth over $90M off of public "service". Would love to see her, Pelosi, et al, investigated with 1% of the vigor as Trump. But we keep playing the game.

“Until recently, I had taken as political hyperbole Democrats' assertion President Trump is a fascist. But latest tweet is fascistic &amp; itself grounds for president's immediate impeachment again by House of Representatives &amp; removal from office by Senate”

Trump Storms Out Of Briefing After Reporter Blasts Him For Retweeting 'Alien DNA' Doctor's Claims
Frankly, everyday trump/Putin take out a hammer and saw and attack our constitution.  (“I should be in office for 20 years...” emoluments... foreign interference in 2016, requesting it from Ukraine in 2020 by leveraging approved self-defense weapons...).

I’m starting to get the vibe Trump is gonna win. It’s a gut feeling I don’t have hard evidence for it, all these dumbasses planning their victory out in late July just makes me sense it
Wow the fuckin nitwit had a decent idea and Trump fucking ruined it.
FALSE. Having spent my entire career in both State &amp; Federal Law Enforcement, I Can State Unequivocally,  Is The Only Real Supporter of the Rule of Law &amp; supports police. BTW: I have put more people in prison for a fraction of what Impeached TRUMP does on a weekly basis.
It’s going to be interesting what Trump has to say about the #NBA kneeling down during the national anthem.
I'm guessing it's during tRUMP's daily briefings....wait, i thought it said finger PAINTING! Sorry.
Smarter than Trump and will surround himself with decent people
You speak Trump?
The damn finally broke! But I got ask, of all of the crap that’s gone on, children separated from their parents, Russia putting bounties on US soldiers, the handling this pandemic, lives could have been saved. I know there’s more. Why is this the one that trump crossed the line?
it is not your message it’s the Candidate Dump Trump and run Pence/ Baker. You’ll have the GOP never trumps come back. You might lose some Maga idiots but you won’t loss the Senate. If you keep Trump the senate is gone along with White House. #DumpTrump2020
Thank you!  Absentee Ballot = Mail-In voting.  They are synonyms. Someone tell Trump.

As predictable as the sunrise.  As I was watching i knew this was coming.  This was not a campaign speech, this was eulogy honoring the mans lifes work.  To ignore that would have diminished #JohnLewis' life.  #Trump enabler. #JohnLewisFuneral  #JohnLewisRIP  #ObamaEulogy
I have idiots trying to fight with me now about it. How anyone could think Trump is an innocent, caring, loyal, intelligent, and trustworthy man is beyond me
But what does he even do?! This is just starting to get really fucked. His mind is worse then trump’s

The Trump Administration forced meatpacking workers back to plants that are COVID death traps. 1 in 10 meatpacking workers (who are mostly Black, immigrants, or both) had COVID as of last month.
Don't forget a black TRUMP supporter who was a presidential hopeful died as well!
The Trump Adminsitration is trying to slash UI and give corporations sweeping immunity from worker safety laws.   I’m not going to shed a tear for Trump aides that were just fine sending low-wage workers to their deaths till the virus came to their workplace too.
Woke you up? You’re still dreaming! You live in a world where you think Trump is a honest, caring, loyal, and intelligent man.Not having to think about Trump
I'm not responsible for Trump
Trump is president.  You think if it was Bush not Clinton it would be any different?
Do you think Herman Cain knew he was signing his DEATH WARRANT when he signed the COVID waiver at Trump’s Arizona rally?😳
I hate Trump and the Republican Party. I also hate the Clintons. Case in point why...
Awesome! Love President Trump! ❤️
Who's the new co-chair for Blacks for Trump? Have the others got the message that their lives are expendable yet?
If Trump resigns pence can give him a pardon
nope. just not having access to universal healthcare, nothing being done about systematic racism, zero accountability on wall street, and the same cast of ghouls running things.   the only thing you have to offer as better than trump is not tweeting. whoopty fucking doo
Probably the same logic trump uses everyday when he applied his orange coating on in the morning.
Trump must go! #TrumpHatesScience #TrumpThreatensAmerica #TrumpIsARacist #TrumpCrimeFamily
Stop drinking Trump’s Kool -Aid. You embarrassed yourself on Cuomo. ... how sad !!
I am challenging all of you to go back to Washington and take up the Democrats Cares Act ASAP this weekend and pass it without issues and tell Trump to sign it now..If you don't..your done
Where do I sign up for the newsletter where Trump tells people which company he's giving money to next so subscribers can buy the stock the day before?
Ben this is an atypical election year. This is not the normal left/right divide. Trump is a clear and present danger to the fabric of the Republic. He derides our allies, warms up to despots, has an antiquated sense of economics, casts doubt on our institutions.1/
Don't forget Trump Glenn...I know Im not your fav follower..not sure why..So I'll jus sit in the back of your legal room and observe..no worries
What’s on? The Election?  If Biden makes a splash with his already-later-than-Hillary-did-it-in-2016 VP announcement, Trump will have to keep up amid the hype.
Trump lies about everything except who he is. He's never pretended to be decent; and he's been remarkably consistent about it. Unless this guy has been in a coma since 2015, he cannot credibly claim to be surprised about who Trump is. He knew and didn't care.
How can you be proud of the #Bladen use of using Corgess man the Horrible John Lewis furanel as if he was still president or running. It shouldn't be all about trashing the police! He's still the most curport Pres in history. We do and he didn't send all the jobs to China TRUMP
Fuck this guy for pretending he didn't know who Trump was.
Donald Trump is responsible for American lives lost to COVID-19.  Republicans  are responsible for not removing him when impeached.
I think he was doing the same thing then. Lol.  I don't think he expected to be the nominee.   Trump is about Trump first.  He has to feel like a winner.  Also don't get me wrong, I voted for him and think he did a lot of good things.
He seems steady to me. Ready for August, which looks to be the first month of the Election in earnest.  Everything is practice up until then.  Awareness of Universal Mail-In (my state is allowing Excuse-Free Absentee) and what it means isn’t all about Trump’s campaign. Important.
He voted for Trump and opposed impeachment. Now, he calls the president a fascist for suggesting the election be postponed, and suggests that Trump be impeached again.
Little did Congressman Hurd how many Americans Trump’s incompetence would kill when he voted against Impeachment.
Anyone who claims they didn't know who Trump was from the very beginning is full of shit. They knew and didn't care. They tossed a grenade into the White House and blithely figured the shrapnel would hit someone else.
Trump said we are the laughingstock of the world I think he is the laughingstock world feels  sorry for us and 152,000 dead because of trump
Trump is standing up telling lie after lie when he ever put the country before himself no
It's mildly encouraging. Too bad the politicians he's unerringly voted for will do nothing of the sort. Also, anyone who claims they didn't know who Trump was from the very beginning is full of shit. They knew and didn't care.
Trump loves walls so much this is a beautiful thing to watch as they are closing in. Can I help pay for it?
Trump trying to cancel election and proclaim himself "King"
MA must go with delaying election.Pres. Trump is right. No rigged elections.
Trump just threatened using military force against his own citizens.
How many Americans have died thus far from the coronavirus? How many more Americans are going to die because the Republican Party is going to sit back on their ass and let Trump not give a shit! We are a joke to the world because  are wimps! We need leadership!
Trump says “we’re doing things with our country that frankly no one could’ve done” oh boy! Did he get that right! Who would’ve thought, in February and March, that we’ve had 150k dead from his incompetence? #RememberInNovember #VoteHimOut #LockHimUp
Democrats when they lose to trump 🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡
No dip shit.. Trump tried to slide a 354 million FBI building and you guys giving money to corporate sleeze bags..Shit Mitch Dems did not say they were giving tax cuts to big companies..Your a dillusional twit...96 days and your gone..You'll pay for this Mitch. Its now over for U
Why is . broadcasting a Trump campaign speech?
All it took a horrific, ongoing pandemic, the worst economy since WWII and Trump trying to postpone the presidential election. Don't forget who voted for this #fascist
I thought we were calling it the TRUMP VIRUS. Certainly, he should be responsible for the 151,000 victims.
If he does this, it would be downright decent. If. He's broken a lot of promises that sounded just like this one.
And Trump murdered 150,000 Americans. Way to go Trump.  The tax breaks you refer to are for big business and the rich 🤦‍♀️😢

Trump installed an unqualified toady just a couple months ago for this exact reason.
The election is run by the state governments.  Trump can't stop them holding it; and they have a legal duty to do it regardless of any federal executive action.
#Trump suggesting he plans 2 delay elections on very day we lay our beloved John Lewis to rest is beyond disrespectful. It is a hateful attack 2 discredit the life &amp; legacy of a man who was willing to lay down his life for the right to vote! Trump has NO POWER to do such a thing.
US Ambassador to the Netherlands mourns invading Nazis in his plea for peace.   We need to vote Trump and his fascist minions out.
As well as the opportunities to manipulate for his personal benefit. Force transparency now, do not wait! When Trump does leave the WH, someone better check the silverware!
Unless Trump resigns in December he’s president until January 20th
Trump matters about as much as the dead ant on the bottom of my shoe.
not liking that another country interfered with the candidates help and blessing is knee thing, not accepting is another or Trump wouldn't be in the White House - how do you not understand the difference? Trump is seeing he isn't leaving  no matter the results
If you signed a COVID death waiver, and attended a Trump rally, you *kinda* got what you deserved.
Can you fucking imagine Trump even TRYING to read the speech that #Obama just gave in honor or Mr. Lewis?! #GoodTrouble #TrumpIsNotWell #JohnLewisRIP
The scared to lose Trump.
Trump works to destroy our imperfect union. We need leaders who will work to perfect it!
That is tragic news. Perhaps President Trump will finally understand his political gamesmanship in how he deals with the Coronavirus is not just inadequate for America but also dangerous for all Americans in violation of his oath to protect the citizenry.
Donald Trump should resign. Pass it on.
He died doing what he loved being another Trump stooge. #TrumpVirus #TrumpStooge
We all worry about a Democrat version of Donald Trump but... man... that Clinton eulogy... maybe  we already had Democrat Trump
That’s because Trump really is a President of  the US. He is #PutinsPuppet
Herman Cain went to the Trump rally in Tulsa he did not wear a mask his death falls directly on Donald Trump his blood is on trumps hands
Kind of like that scumbag Antifa punk that said Trump supporters were P*****s got shot to death by one that same day,you guys were all upset for people making jokes about that, but this is okay. Hypocrites...
He died because he listen to trump did not wear a mask and expose himself to the Covid He’s just is on your hands And trumps
This is what Trump is trying to distract us from with his delay the election BS.

It’s not 100% perfect, but it’s not the south. Growing up in Louisiana was horrible. I just feel like because of Trump, the south feels like the sixties.

I know it’s something new every week, but Herman Cain taking an L and dying for Trump was absolutely not on my 2020 bingo
Serious question,  if Trump loses the popular vote again (which, Most analysts are predicting he will) but still manages to ✌🏿win✌🏿the election. What then?
Your stuck with Trump who is a pathological liar. The AG is his on personal man He screwed this virus to the max. Your boy Donnie as Rick Wilson says everything he touches turns to shit.

Good day Twitter..and  .. Another day another day of  Misinformation Tweet..What are you waiting for..Time to ban or remove or severely censor Trump for these tweets of our 2020 Election November 3rd.
Donald Trump’s pathological need for attention killed Herman Cain. Toxic masculinity encourages an invincibility despite clear risks. Ask yourself if feeling tough by not wearing a mask is worth losing your life. Herman painfully fought for his life in a hospital for 25+ days. 😔
Donald Trump should resign. Pass it on.
Only Congress has the Constitutional power to change the date of the November general election. Mr. Trump cannot do so on his own.  The Constitition also mandates the President’s term, if they’re not re-elected, must end Jan. 20 of the following year.
Trump is trying to lose and he is still only down 8
Hm I really do wonder why Trump tries to label something literally called “anti-Fascism” as the enemy. It’s quite a mystery.
Mueller slammed for not charging Trump with obstruction: ‘Unconscionable’ to ‘let him ‘get away with lying’
Knowing that you need to use leverage when you have it, could we start a petition that demands  change its platform to reflect progressive agenda or we will vote for TRUMP. Thinking they don’t need our votes means neutral would be a mistake!   Just spitballing here.
well, you are talking about Trump, Mr. Mariotti......
When when are we going to invoke the 25th ammendment to remove Trump from Office..Why not before Election Day..If we don't it will be to late..He will steal the election and we will move into dictatorship..ot won't end well. Hoping not..But
Wicked racist.. everybody loved him and touted their friendships to the amazing Donald Trump and begged for donations to their political campaigns until he announced his presidency. Then he became a threat
All early photos when they were acquaintances.. also the photo you used with the young girl is photo shopped, it’s literally two in one. It’s trump and young Ivanka at a Harley Davidson event with epstein dubbed in..
White House visitor logs say otherwise, something that is archived and unaltered. Trump outted him to the feds and Miami PD in the late 90s for going after an employees underage daughter. Reported him and banned him from his clubs that was the last of their connection
You can almost hear him saying, “I’ve got the best economy, nobody has done more for the economy than me” in this cover photo. Then you read the headline. Disaster.  you are a dumpster fire.
In today’s world where politics seems to be such a big deal maybe, but when he met his wife maybe politics wasn’t such a big deal and at this point hes not wanting to divorce a woman because of her political beliefs. With that said he could be a Trump supporter, who knows, not us
Fuck that noise. I'll get in line and vote if needed.
Trump is the only “politician” who outted Epstein for the scum he was.  had the story for years and squashed  who wanted to put it out. That was done to protect people like     why did Epstein see Obama 3 times at the WH
So many good candidates. And we are poised to have Biden and Kamala. Not surprised we are gonna have Trump for another 4 years ......
Hi - glad to see you're back! Do you think the media should ignore trump's trial balloon about delaying the election. I feel like if we keep giving it oxygen it fuels it. Like a nasty toddler we should ignore him on this?

This is not a dog whistle, this is him telling us what he is going to do. Trump wants to be a dictator. He will not give up the White House. This should scare and infuriate every American #Totalitarianism #trumpsadictator #votesaveamerica #TrumpThreatensAmerica
Remember when they didn’t let trump institute a travel ban in January when he wanted to. I do
He also won't say he will accept the results. Several states ONLY vote by mail. Trump has done it. Barr has done it. This is NOT how we handle elections in America. This is how a dictator acts, not a President.
The only thing that’s ever truly secure is “people talking about another Trump tweet all day.” 📲
Let's make Trump disappear
If Trump can “postpone” the election due to fraud and COVID and If this is allowed we will never vote again. The oligarchs will have won. Our Constitution will have been overturned.   CONGRESS NEEDS TO ACT!
Just a reminder: Republicans are currently trying to take away unemployment stimulus.
Great article. Disgusting situation. 🤢 😡  'These are his people': inside the elite border patrol unit Trump sent to Portland
Trump is setting the stage for when he declares him losing the election fraudulent
I am a former republican. You're NOT alone. The Republican party I joined back in 1988, no longer exists. This is now the party of Trump. And I can assure you George H.W. Bush would be supporting the  right now if he were still alive. Welcome to the resistance. 🇺🇸
God forbid Trump gets proven correct, AGAIN.
Democrats are despicable. Trump 2020 God save America

There’s a debate to be had about U.S. troop deployments. But this impulsive decision doesn’t accomplish anything.   via
Hmmm...most every barn that I pass have a Trump flag flying...My mistake.
Trump would never harm our troops!   America First!  Just stop!
As the door closes on the Trump presidency, unfinished gift getting races against the clock not to miss the unique  opportunities Trump presents!! God knows and Americans will find out what the unfinished corruption is and who will benefit AND what it will cost the nation!
Putin has to give Trump his instructions that’s why they’re talking so often
#TheNewAbnormal is my new favorite podcast. This week I learned how eels can be even more slippery, what shouldn’t be stuck in a light socket, and what  can’t do in his backyard without the Trump campaign knowing.
Madonna will realize the left is dangerous and come out in support of Donald Trump.  All her fans go nuts and threaten her but Madonna stands strong and tries to help the left open their eyes, her career is revived.
Trump is destroying the post office again is another way to steal the election
Trump is always sending his storm troopers to democratic cities it’s a practice run for suppressing the vote
If Donald Trump believed in Law and order  no he would stop breaking the law and stop having his people break the law How many of trumps people have been indicted
Wouldn’t it be great for UPS and FedX if they delivered ALL the mail. Their gratitude to Trump would be unmeasurable for letting them deliver a letter with their $10 stamp!
Trump knows Russians are putting bounties on American soldiers hands how many spoke to Putin he didn’t even bring it up Trump is afraid of Putin
Trump promotes a Doctor Who believes in alien DNA
Take Take Take aka Trump family.
Putin has wanted those troops out of Germany for quite a while he instructed Trump to take them out and that’s what Trump is doing
Watch Trump give all his inheritance to Barron and all the other Trumps sue the kid
And Boston’s NPR   did an episode yesterday also.  Listen to "This 'War Game' Maps Out What Happens If The President Contests The Election" on WBUR.
As justifiably mad as you may be about #Trump remarks on affordable housing, you should be even more angry about everyone in his party NOT saying anything to acknowledge and challenge it. Enablers are responsible too.
Mr Barr and tRump executed2Prisoner in Federal Prison! The Pope condemns  Capital Punishment! Barr is a Catholic and defies the teaching of the Church! tRump is a Pro Life President?  4 yrs. of war and capital punishment too!  Ha Ha Ha

You honk and hollar bout democrats doing their part on the covid relief..What have you done mitch? Go to your desk now and find the dems propasal and give it to Trump to sign..Americans are waiting. You blow it..its over for you. You do this Mitch. No more time 4 U
Guy in my feed who once offered a deal where he'd make $500 as the booker and the band would make $100 is voting for Trump and that basically sums that up.
Bye Trump. YOU HAVEN'T MENTIONED NOTHING ABOUT ALL THE CHAOS IN THE WORLD, YOU ARE CONTRIBUTING MORE HATE, YOU HAVEN'T EVEN GIVE SYMPATHY TO THE FAMILIES WHO ARE LOSING LIVES TO THIS VIRUS. YOU ARE WORRIED ABOUT VOTES? GET OUT THE HOUSE WE PAY FOR 🗣🚶🏽‍♀️😤
Great book by Mary Trump..great read..loved the Mashed Potato bowl part.. Maybe Nancy Pelosi should do that to you for you to stop your racist tweets and your hell bent Mail in ballot rants. By the way I contacted Jack Dorsey on your racist tweet today
Trump does the #GreenNewDeal
If Trump has DHS agents swamp polling places in November to scare off voters we don't need to call its fascism, we can just call it good old American Jim Crow gone national. We could also call it fascism just for kicks.
Trump spends American taxpayers money as his own as if he has a Master key to U.S. Treasury
Please post this Joy..two tweets from  Today..Call out Jack Dorsey CEO of Twitter to ban Trump from Twitter..this has to stop!
Mr Trump is in a tweet rage today..First a severe racist tweet and just now a voter supression on NY' mail in ballot Twitter message. I want you to call upon  to remove  From Twitter asap. He is making things worse! Enough
Trump twice violated your policies today..Once for a severe racist tweet and on supression on mail in ballots..He has been warned and flagged multiple times. Please for the sake of the country..Ban or suspend or remove Trump today.
Once again Trump is attempting to spread disinformation on mail in voting in New York 8 min ago. And trying to supress the vote!!  I just reported his tweet to Twitter. BAN HIM!I have contacted Congressional members to call on you to ban or remove

Good Evening Mr.Lieu. I am strongly urging you to call upon your congressional friends and colleagues to call out Twitters Ceo  To remove Donald Trump from Twitter for his damaging Public Twitter racist messages. He is making things worse with these tweets
Hello Mrs.Jayapal I have also posted the racist tweet from  today on Twitter  CEO and am strongly urging you to call out Twitter to ban Trump and remove his remarks..messages. Its wrong. And must be stopped.
If the president/Government can send Trillions to save banks(bailouts) &amp; to save the stock market(what trump did a couple months ago) then they can afford literally anything. Don’t come at me with anything, if they can funnel trillions then they can make it afford for us to live
Hi Eric..First grand job on grilling Barr yesterday. So I am calling upon you to call out Trump on a congressional level as well as other members in Congress to Call for Twitter's CEO  To remove  From Twitter for his continued racist tweets
It doesn't help that unlike Donald Trump or Bob Arum, Vince is so out of tough with today's audiences. Watching RAW and Smackdown feels like I am loosing brain cells and even the wrestlers and staff realize Vince is the main problem. He has become Al Davis in the 2010's.
They also don't like you. Nobody likes you.  tRump puts the Sauer in Sauerkraut.  He puts both the Brat and the Wurst into Bratwurst.  #NobodyLikesMe  #OrangeMonster
Might fuck around and dead every even remotely trump supporting human I know
She is a fake. A phony. She will say what ever she thinks you want to hear to be relevant.  Teresa is a Trump supporter so Jennifer will do whatever Teresa does. This does not surprise me at all.
Im not friends with a childhood friend because of political rants that he wanted social media applause for ... he’s a lefty and hates trump. I asked for examples of the topic he was railing against. I got threats and called really horrible things. That’s the go to for them.
You shouldn’t be surprised. Democrats agenda is to block, destroy, make false accusations to anyone in their way.  They are walking dead people. I am glad in November I will vote for president Trump.  If I was dead I will vote for Democrats.  Awful but true.
Rep. Nadler I forwarded that to you today. Its outragous. I am disabled and so is my wife of 35 years. We are low income. I am asking you to call Out or even ask Twitter's  To testify on Trumps racist tweets and suspend Trump or remove him from Twitter. This is wrong
"Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh tried to sidestep abortion and Trump financial document cases, CNN reports"
"Trump tells voters in suburbs they will ‘no longer be bothered’ by low-income housing"

Please please report on this tweet of Trumps today.. Appauling racist tweet..I want  of Twitter to remove Trump from Twitter asap for this twitter message. It must stop.
Another corrupt working for Trump.
Donald Trump is a NIMBY. Interpret however you would like  #HousingForAll
YOU HAVE TO REMOVE TRUMP FROM YOUR TWITTER PLATFORM. YOU CANNOT ALLOW THIS.. A reminder that back in 1973 Donald Trump's company was charged by the Justice Department with violating the Fair Housing Act by discriminating against black rental applicants.
I want Trump removed from Twitter and so should you! This is racism. Plain and simple. When does it stop!
I don't believe you. Obviously you are some kind of anti-Trump antifa rabble rouser.
Also, while we’re on the subject of hell, why did Trump’s crazy doctor go for demon sperm when demon semen was right there? Honestly, these people are tearing the country apart, and they aren’t even enjoying themselves while they do it.
Has anyone checked if Kelly Loeffler or Richard Burr recently bought Kodak stock? How about Trump's family or Louise Linton?
Nothing is illegal in the Trump Administration. Every loss in court is defied and spun as a victory. Everything else is swept under the rug by Mitch and given lip service by Nancy.
Lawless Trump administration makes its Supreme Court defiance official
I am pleading with you to suspend Mr.Trump from Twitter.Racism. I am happy to inform all of the people living their Suburban Lifestyle Dream that you will no longer be bothered or financially hurt by having low income housing built in your neighborhood...
The  has spent decades stoking racial resentment in coded and subliminal ways (mostly), but Trump's uncut raw way of saying the unsaid part out loud will backfire on him, pushing many in the opposite direction.
You should be refuting the accusations of  that Trump is a racist. I don't believe that! And I don't like it!
I don't think Trump would stop at getting rid of low income housing, given the opportunity the return of all the tools of residential segregation is entirely within the scope of this administration's desired outcomes.  Redlining, racial covenants, all that.
Those were conclusions shared with the President by medical professionals. He chose to share some hope with the country. Turns out more and more doctors are agreeing with him. If you don't like the news because President Trump is saying it, that's got nothing to do with him.
Remember the "Trump is a YIMBY" toxic bullshit from those anti-YIMBY accounts? Hard to believe it was only a few months ago.
I love President Trump and Guthrie's pre-show rant is funny he makes fun of the Fake news.  only person on the show I think is a deceiver is Quan he can't be that delusional. If he thinks  can beat  hes
At this point, saying anything about Trump is just pointing out the obvious. Time to start pointing out the people who enabled him.
It needs to be a decisive victory, not a skin of the teeth one. Just winning those would be a win on paper, but "unclear" enough for Trump to challenge the results and cause a constitutional crisis far worse than Bush v Gore.
Barr walks like Trump.
The Trump administration’s brazen lawlessness puts DACA beneficiaries in peril.

He and Trump have endangered the senate,he house and everyday Americans Now he wants our children
Hello America, every time Trump talks badly about people that came before him or he’s not a big fan. Former Presidents, all living mind you. Colin Powell &amp; other very intelligent &amp; respected former high-ranking officials. Maybe  is the problem. Just saying?
Well, this puts a damper on Trump’s Texas Trip! Still want to show up, big donors? 😷
No problem bud! Were you ok with Obama golfing and his numerous trips to Martha’s Vineyard? If Trump wanted to golf every weekend he could’ve he literally has his own courses. Instead he became President to fix this country and doesn’t take the POTUS salary while doing so.👍🏻🐑🤡
American fascism has arrived, and the danger is real — but it's not too late to defeat it. Trump's form of fascism may not look like earlier models — but it's the real thing and it's happening right now
If you watch this and still vote for trump I hate you
Trump losing 2020 will feel even more hopeless than him winning 2016. The idea of him losing should be a joyous one but we've been robbed of anything to celebrate in it.
Trump politicized it? What does that mean?
“I just want to apologize to the world,” said Julie, a fraud manager from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, who asked that the Guardian not use her real name.  “I feel so guilty for having a part in voting this moron in.”
The only thing I would’ve added is Collins saying she thought Trump learned a lesson.

So how did the FBI building money get into the GOP bill if none of them know how it got there? Magic? It's hard to believe that #MoscowMitch &amp; #LeningradLindsey were out of the loop. They meet with trump, $ appears in bill, then they play dumb. It's all a game to them. Deplorable
By the end of the day, COVID-19 will have killed 150,000 Americans, but Trump’s central concern is that people don’t like him.
Kudos to  for not bursting into laughter when trump says these ridiculous things.
This is what you’re supporting America? Racism is racism. God save America! Trump 2020
Peaceful protesters? God save America! Trump 2020
Coming to a city near you. Careful what you wish for. Is this really what you want America?!? This is the democrat agenda? God save America! Trump 2020
And just like that, the left &amp; Big Tech all of a sudden have NO problem censoring &amp; ridiculing a Black Woman.  All because she agrees with Trump on #covid &amp; #Hydroxychloroquine.  Amazing.
Yep calling it now: edc 2021 if it happens looks more likely October I’m praying with the vaccines and hoping trump is voted out but at this point we can only hope people gotta wake up (tho now I think some are slowly realizing)
Gotta LOVE two things abouts this tweet. 1. TRUMP WAS RIGHT ALL ALONG.  2.  They posted this at 4am on a Friday morning of a long weekend for most families.
Despots have a bunker shelter. As Berlin was invaded by the Russians, the Fuhrer, comfortable in his bunker, believed he still would win because of his new wonder weapons.They arrived too late. Trump’s wonder weapon is a vaccine. When safe to use, it will be too late to save him!

Do you think Spanky Trump gets aroused looking at a Russian Nesting Doll with Putin’s image?
We all want the same outcome, and no need fighting about it, that’s the problem if trump and congress would work together for the people and not trying to ruin the other side things would be so much better
No it’s not that’s why doctors are not using it and Trump is mad because he can’t make money if they don’t use it
No there is no research that shows it helps that’s why doctors don’t use it. I work at 2 of the best hospitals in the world in Boston and not one doctor would ever use that. Trump have a financial stake in it that’s why he is promoting it so he can make money
That’s all lies it’s propaganda doctors paid by trump look at the site it’s on it’s a right wing propaganda site it’s not a legitimate site
#CNNTownHall can we have the election next week to save our country! #Biden2020ToSaveAmerica #fauci commit trump to a ward !!#25thAmendmentBeforeWeAllDie #eyeshields on planes first!!
Or the scientists who actually know what they are talking about. Trump doesn’t know anything about anything but acts like he knows everything
Wrong it doesn’t not help against covid that’s another right lie. I’m a respiratory therapist and treat covid patients and none have ever got that medication, all doctors say it doesn’t work. That’s the problem trump and the right don’t listen to the doctors
Trump lies about everything except who he is. He's never pretended to be decent; and he's been remarkably consistent about it. Unless this guy has been in a coma since 2015, he cannot credibly claim to be surprised about who Trump is. He knew and didn't care.
Care about America and the poor and middle class not the rich. Trump’s version of republicans are all about Russia and wants best for Trump and getting rid of immigrants, lgbtq, women’s right and African American rights
It’s not all republicans that hate minorities it’s Trumps republicans. And why would tut think trump would have anything to do with the America dream. Republicans politicians only care about the rich they don’t care about America or the people. The Democrats

And he had trump fire the IG investigating his corruption
Little did Congressman Hurd how many Americans Trump’s incompetence would kill when he voted against Impeachment.
Anyone who claims they didn't know who Trump was from the very beginning is full of shit. They knew and didn't care. They tossed a grenade into the White House and blithely figured the shrapnel would hit someone else.
Trump will lose for that false threat
It's mildly encouraging. Too bad the politicians he's unerringly voted for will do nothing of the sort. Also, anyone who claims they didn't know who Trump was from the very beginning is full of shit. They knew and didn't care.
Epstein met with many philanthropists not just sexual predators sometimes common sense goes a long way, he met gates and other famous people to keep his name out there and make himself look important! Now trump is guilty as fuck 15 years just like prince Andrew guilty as fuck!
TRUMP 4 MORE YEARS
Time to start charging these criminals under the Biden administration I better see Crimes for any trump official that broke the law, im demanding justice they break laws and money can’t save them! We need to set examples and this house arrest shit like Epstein better not happen!
Trump is right doing things with our country that has never done before
Trump has been smoking weed today
Trump is throwing Republicans who listened to him under the bus. Oh and 1917 again.
Yuck. Worse president ever. More gov involvement &amp; regulations on small businesses, my health Ins premiums tripled while others got “free” healthcare 🤷🏻‍♀️ I don’t wish him ill will, but happy he’s gone and Trump has made good on his promises &amp; has got my back! #Trump2020🇺🇸
If he does this, it would be downright decent. If. He's broken a lot of promises that sounded just like this one.
After watching Trump W is an elequent speaker. Clinton and Obama are always well spoken.

And Trump murdered 150,000 Americans. Way to go Trump.  The tax breaks you refer to are for big business and the rich 🤦‍♀️😢
You did the “Yah but Hillary”, I believe she would have handled this pandemic much better than Trump. You happy with his handling of it?
Bengazi vs Russian bounty Clinton Foundation vs Trump Foundation Uranium one signed off by ALL cabinet members Not charged with mishandling info  Typical Fox news conspiracy theories
It’s all about hate, I have lost a lot of longtime friends since Trump got elected because their hate came out toward others, I never seen this in my friends in all the years I knew them. Trump enabled all the closet racist to come out
It's not a sign of virtue. It's a sign you listen to medical experts not idiots like Trump.
Definitely Trump and his kids and Barr are trying to stay out of prison, I wouldn’t be surprised that when he loses in November that he resigns so that Pence and pardon him
The three Presidents who spoke today highlight Trump’s inadequacies. He’s an utter failure. A man with no empathy. A man with no love other than self love. A man with no vision for a thriving country. A poor excuse for a human being. #TrumpThreatensAmerica
Trump didn't send anyone from the administration to represent the White House. I hate him with every part of my soul.
Keep following trump tho ...
They can't. They would have to call out some in the White community as a threat to our country. They have to erase all their reporting and commentary about the Trump voter as the real American. White people can't be called out or chastised in this America. It's not allowed.
Poor #HermanCain and the rest of the trump followers who listen to a deranged self serving man! #DontDrinkTheCoolAid #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica2020 #Biden
Anything against trump is great they trying to steal the election
I laugh at all Trump’s brilliant ideas because if I didn’t I’d be crying and sick 24/7.
With Trump who really knows, hard to tell what’s real now a days
So trump can spread 20,000 lies and the one video that shows him being true is fake or altered? How about the video that trump said he would grab women by the pussy is that altered as well? Is someone supporting Trump, you have me confused!?!
Please explain how this is fake? Trump is a tyrant and I’m willing to help spread the word that he is a tyrant and needs to go
How is that fake? Trump talking bad about his supporters really is it that hard to believe?
Trump killed Herman Cain. Damn.
You can’t even save your own from trump  we need real leaders like
People really come on here and turn people’s death’s into meme’s and jokes.  I fucking hate Trump with every fiber of my being, but i wouldn’t stoop down to cracking jokes about another Man’s death just cause he supported him smh  You niggas be weirdos.
The media is dumb. Trump could give a shit about Cain passing.
It has been a slow decent into madness beginning with Reagan and hitting its nadir with Sarah Palin. Trump represents the sewer beneath that bottom.
He had to sign a waiver to go to Trump's rally. He accepted the risk.
Another needless death because of Trump’s incompetence. He should have shut the whole country down, mandate masks and social distancing. I think we’re going to have to do that soon.
Or the bad GDP numbers. He could give a shit about Cain. He wouldn't even cross his mind to tie this to his rally. Trump is a sociopath.
No shit,  kills another American, when will trump fans wake the fuck up!?!
Trump had people sign waivers so they couldn't sue
Good point, after Trump is defeated I think Crayola should retire their orange crayon.

Finally seeing some stances against trump that I believe are necessary great job let’s hold this tyrant accountable
Trumps doctor told us all a bold face lie when he says Trump is in great health. No one that works at the WH knows what the word “truth” means.
how will you protect trump when he is so compromised that he is willing to not only jeopardize our  but will suggest moving the election date!?! Suggesting this is treason by itself! We need leaders to defend this so we can elect a REAL LEADER

you people better do something or by the time King Trump is removed the US will be an impoverished 3rd rate nation with no allies.
I think Trump’s going to stick it out, I think they’re cooking up Obamagate, probably announce it mid September. If he loses, and I hope Biden wins in a landslide, I see him resigning and have Pence pardon him.
Trump is a clown!
USPS has been falling apart for decades. Not much Trump, or anybody, could do to make it worse.
Also nothing trump has done will bring about true change towards equality which is what is actually needed. No other president has had the opportunity that Trump has currently the entire world is rethinking the way the deal with black and brown ppl trump has
Bro what has trump done for us please enlighten me. Was it when he called white spremacist good ppl even after they killed someone? Or Were you impressed with his thoughts on the George Floyd killing?
We need trump... A president with out dementia
Don't you mean Trump and many republicans
Sounds like Trump made some calls
We have a president who refuses to acknowledge any wrong and is willing to speak with dictators instead of listening to his own people, this is the day that President Trump has kept me awake because of the fears I share with my fellow Americans because he truly is trying to,
Hand accounts from citizens across the country demonstrates the attacks that this puppet of the USPS is already doing from day 1, to limit and delay our  mail on Election Day to interfere with the votes so Donal J Trump can illegaly interfere in another election but still have
Trump attacks all of over institutions on a daily basis and I fear that attacking the post office before an election and to hire a man that has only pushed his agenda and has repeatedly attacked the USPS is a direct violation and attack on a postal system, the news and first
a dictator, after viewing the entire testimony from AG Barr I no longer just fear the foreign assistance from a foreign government but fear for the AG Barr assistance in every possible way to help Trump stay reflected as he sends his SS Gestapo troops to more cities!
I am voting for president Donald J Trump I live in Massachusetts
Watch Trump give all his inheritance to Barron and all the other Trumps sue the kid
Seriously no reporter can find out what Putin has on Trump?
Your thinking of Trump Why do you people say Trump inherited Obama’s accomplishments when Obama never accomplished anything Did Obama start the First Step Act Prison Reform Give Millions $$ to Black Colleges and Universities? Enable many Black Americans to buy homes NO TRUMP DID
I’m driving to work here In Massachusetts and some fool has this in their front yard, and inflatable Trump
I think after a 150,000 people have died it’s the Trump virus.
That's right. That's why we must re-elect President Trump and vote out all the democratic terrorists
They should have arrested  already for the same crime that  committed trump yelled at his dog Barr and they arrested burr
that was the best interview I have seen with Mary Trump. She seemed less cautious and comfortable with you. Good job😊
You honestly believe that incompetent Idiot Biden should be President ? And do better than Trump has done for this economy and the Americans people 😂😂😂😂😂 that says it all about you Best 3 years all while being attacked by the left since he before he was even inaugurated
Always the same remarks from the left it’s embarrassing Trump had our country doing greater than it ever was until the virus was created for political reasons and millions of dollars The Democratic Party was involved Look who was in China before the outbreak
Your comment makes me think of the old Grass Roots song “Where were you when I needed you” during the Trump impeachment hearings.

serious question and hope you can answer, why did FBI investigate  after going against trump for insider trading but  did the exact same thing and  didn’t suck his Dog Barr on her, what’s the double standards and why?  ?
If the president/Government can send Trillions to save banks(bailouts) &amp; to save the stock market(what trump did a couple months ago) then they can afford literally anything. Don’t come at me with anything, if they can funnel trillions then they can make it afford for us to live

Trump installs his own Post master general and now they are trying to interfere in the elections using a rigges system! Only if America has an attorney general who was unbiased to politics and worked for AMERICA!!!
Do you have prove of that? The only people the media talks to are Trump supporters. There is never a discussion about poor and middle class that live in the most populated parts of the country.
#TraitorTrump ignores the  why would Trump listen to the voters when he loses the election, Barr already accepts he might ignore the results when trump loses! He breaks the laws and no one holds his traitorous ass accountable! We need  to do Mitches Job!
Lies corruption death comes from TRUMP WHOS A TRAITOR
Hopefully they don’t have the redactions like Barr did to the mueller case, as barr agrees trump can get any foriegn help to win an election... this man is a traitor

You are such a disappointment to the people of MA, Elizabeth.  You lied your way through school and lifeto get ahead by using a false heritage card until Trump called you out on it.  Is that why you despise him?  He called your bluff.
Not me. America and what I should be and whatnot really is FAR outweighs Trump and the very UN-American folks who have tried to co-opt it.

Trump said he would Drain the Swamp. What did hr do, placed stoplogs  the low points and raised the Swamp even higher.
Republicans would have impeached a democrats ten times already for 1/3 of the things Trump has done.

You'd think Trump - being in Twitter constantly - would read some of the tweets about him and MAYBE take a moment to reflect and see things outside of him and his bubble. Innumerable tweets begging him to help us. Do better. Be better... And he just won't.  It's unfathomable Ego

Look if people don't want Trump in office. You have to take a look at what got him there.  The broke down political system so corrupt anyone looks great compared to what was out there.  Come on Hillary?  She married a rapist, defended him.  And had american citizens murdered.

If Trump hasn't been shamed into being better by now then nothing will do it.  I wish he'd have an Ebenezer Scrooge-type experience and spend the rest of his life trying to do good. Sadly that's a work of fiction and this is all too real.    It's never too late...
If you’re a Republican and Donald Trump’s presidency doesn’t cause you great shame then you really need to do some serious self-examination.

So upset right now! Fox News cut some of President Trump's  Covid 19 briefing. I like The Five but if Fox News thinks any of their programming is as important as hearing from The President they are dead wrong! Especially these days!

#BillBarr majority of Americans supports the protesters. Yes we know Republicans are afraid of the protesters. That's the whole point Trump is pushing. In the mid-terms  Trump made them afraid of caravans.
If the major media companies had their way not only would this terrible virus continue indefinitely but also the country wide riots any thing to hurt Trump and promote their doomsday agenda. In their eyes as long as it's good for ratings who cares who gets hurt.

I’ll bet he’s a Trump University graduate.
Funny how everyone is complaining about Trump  but noone has dared to visit the reasons why Trump was elected in the first place.   Basically the complete and utter failure of the democratic party to serve all of the people not just a select group.
He tried that and no one listened Those people go against everything Trump wants to do

I mean it does make sense right? Trump has used this Presidency as a business, like most of his business they end up shutdown....pretty similar looking, huh?
Agree. Listened to her read it on Audible. I think about every time I see a Trump clip.
I honestly don’t think Biden will ever Debate Trump anyway It will just help seal his fate as an incompetent candidate on National Television I hope and Pray he does though it’ll be very entertaining and hilarious to watch him stumble and mumble his way and not make any sense
That’s bullshit This is exactly what the Democrats want They don’t want Biden Debating Trump Live in stage They know he’ll get laughed off of it It’s going to be a humiliating embarrassment for Biden more so than the many embarrassing things he’s been doing for months now
Historically it never seems to be the most expected!  The trump team has been ready to attack Harris, I am thinking a lesser known.

15 years with Epstein and Maxwell, Trump didn’t participate in any rapes or sexual assaults of women 🧐, oh wait there are plenty of cases against him that show he has and was willing to engage in acts with them! Only reason he isn’t in jail is because trump has lawyers $$$

But did trump open the Bible? Did he say any verses lol what was his favorite bible verse... oh wait it’s a propaganda tool to entice god loving folks.. silent your a fool
Silence is bliss, you have no resources just lke trump has none lol. Let’s ignore all intelligence briefings and call Putin for advice and then completely disregard the constitution because Putin says so lol silent your truly dilusional
You speak like a true tyrant who plays too many video games watches and drink cool aid from Fox News, do yourself a favor silent and change the name your a warrior of shit and trump wants to be a dictator
There was a reason for not to tell general population to wear masks, first trump had 3 years to increase stock pile of supplies and failed to do it! We can’t have everyone buying up all the masks when hospitals don’t even have enough while working with covid patients
Jimmy, if only we could fix the stupid ones. These traitors will learn nov 3 that America is done with traitors like trump and the race war that trump is trying to create! 3.7 years of failed guidance by a Russian Puppet
Let’s put some sanctions on Russia oh wait the last time that happened was under President Obama and Trump ordered Traitor Flynn to tell Kislyak to tell Putin to ignore the sanctions, your just a puppet or a Bot, your intelligence is beyond inferior and should be examined by a Dr

Love this PR Stunt photo for Walter Reed, this is the one time he respected the wounded warriors that were probably put there because Putin put bounties on American Soldeirs and trump just says Fake news! Firing all inspector generals that investigate corruption.. hiding nothing!

I’ve watched the HCQ story since before Elon and Trump caught wind. It works when given early. This is the rule with antivirals ...not the exception.  But government is a generic drug neutralizing racket. Always building regulatory grease for less effective patented compounds.

C'mon,  Trump does *not* want to ban vote-by-mail, and he does not want to move the date of the election. He wants us to vote on Nov 3, and he wants *lots* of us to vote by mail. This is all about Operation November the Fourth. /1

They do it all the time and I can't blame them because it works. I think any token resistance Romney puts up to Trump is 100% party approved so that in 4 years they can trot him out for president again and say "Look, we've always been opposed to Trumpism" and they'd win

Trump's attacks on the election must - MUST - always be framed first and foremost as tactical moves in Operation November the Fourth. He doesn't want to move the election or to ban mail-in voting. He wants those things to happen so he can wake the next day and reject the results.
Thank you,  Have you read Gary Hart's recent op-ed about presidential emergency powers? Please read &amp; share with your colleagues and begin an investigation asap regarding the scope of these powers and how they might impact the election.
Trump wants to delay the November election until  - to use  his word -   it's "safe" . Presumably he means "safe" for him. For the rest of the country the word to be applied is "disastrous". Witness the pandemic. He must not be allowed to get away with this insanity!
If even ONE Senator or Representative, Republican or Democrat says, We'll look into this, you WILL resign. There is NO looking into it..its a law! Trump cannot change a law. Stop enabling this fascist pig.
goes into trump crime family pockets?
the gop is in with Trump and Putin.

But Trump can't.
And there it is...This is why Trump has done little to stop the spread of COVID-19 and has even taken steps to worsen the pandemic. He will use this pandemic to pressure governors &amp; Congress to delay the election, at which point our descent into fascism will be complete.
Thank you for standing up to Trump, but we need to do a lot more to protect our elections from foreign interference and to fight voter suppression tactics.
Donald Trump should resign. Pass it on.
What are you doing to protect our Election from attacks from Russia, China and other countries? Very little has been done since 2016 because Trump and the Republicans have no desire to have fair elections.
Trump will be fine with it, he loves "acting" appointments!
We both know why Gerry. Trump won 4 years ago. They failed to have him impeached, so they waited for his last year of term 1 to cause anarchy before the election. They care more about getting him out, than they do about the health of the country.
they (Republicans) just decided to use Trump the same way he uses others. honestly they sold their soul long before Trump.
BOTH parties made Trump possible.

The Nazis were sent by Trump. There were about 100 protesters until the #TrumpGestapo showed up &amp; started escalating the violence.  Then more arrived to protest the #TrumpGestapo #TrumpThreatensAmerica
I mean, is it true that Trump is a fucking Lizard monster in an orange human skin-suit who's broken so many laws (with impunity!) that he should be in jail rather than the oval office? Yes. Sorry. I couldn't hold that in anymore. But, I did give you facts on Biden first. Lol

I don't. Because that didn't happen. Trumps long history of racism is well documented:
The Senate is gone.  Trump can still pull it out if Biden goes all Biden in the debates
I don,t because that was Trump not the WHO:

Is every member of  trying to lose?  Most of us in this country support BLM,  and are dead set against losing our health insurance because of the Republican party's attempts to repeal the ACA.  Trump supporters need to open their eyes!
I believe that trump is the only person Putin has something really big on.  I bet trump's financial records would reveal a lot in that area.
You mean the idiots in his district. Who also support Trump.
There will be millions like her dancing in the streets when  loses.  All cities should start organizing their "Good Riddance Trump" celebrations now.  That will be the biggest party ever!  I'm going to buy the best party clothes I can find.😊
And you have to use that data, because Trump won't let the CDC have or distribute that information anymore.
"In America if you are white, you should not have to set eyes on a brown person who isn't working for you," Trump continued. "I said it like I just think poor people are disgusting, but you all know what I meant."
"I know it sounds like I'm talking exclusively to white people," Trump continued, "But that's only because I want white people who are afraid of browns to vote for me. Because whites are scared of browns, and that's good for me."
"You will never again see a poor or be bothered by knowing they exist," Trump continued. "you will never need to wonder about where Low incomes live or how they survive outside your Suburban Lifestyle Dream. We won't allow them to trouble you.They will disappear like a miracle."
Maybe when Gohmert was gargling Trump's balls, a virus was passed along. Pretty sure neither was wearing a mask.  Sorry...I'm fed up.

TBH I usually don't care one bit about anything Madonna has to say. But then I found out that Trump re-tweeted her video, then instagram and twitter both deleting the video. Now I really want to see it! Anybody got a link to it?
Why would the Russians stop? Trump has absolutely given them a green light to continue paying the Taliban to kill US soldiers.
Ignoring a court order you don’t like because you lost your xenophobic challenge to Congress’s law isn’t an option. I’m going to fight for Dreamers and to make sure the president follows the rule of law.
Sure, but where does he stand on alien DNA, sex demons, and how unfair it is the everybody likes him and nobody like Trump?
Failing up has always been Trump's greatest skill. Promoting and empowering failure is just Trump's version of paying it forward. He wants totally unqualified people to have the same chance to ruin things he had. It's kind of sweet, really
Small businesses are vital to our economy but are being forced to close at an alarming rate.   Why does the HEALS Act include $18 billion for the military, and $1.75 billion for a new FBI Headquarters?  Neither of these items are related to Covid 19 and we all know why Trump (2)

Yes, because “no more tweeting” is the most concerning thing about a potential Biden presidency. 🙄 You’re going to need a better tactic than, “I won’t tweet like Trump does.” We all know that technological advances of the last 10 years befuddle you, and that’s no malarkey!
How many times since he became president could Trump write “WW” in his scorecard?
So it’s not safe if your not going to vote for him?🤷🏻‍♂️

Donny consider this... right now you are almost universally hated by the entire younger generation.  It will take years for the name Trump to not be a shameful disgrace and reviled.  The longer you are in office the longer it will take to rebuild your brand. Resign. #DumpTrump
Beat cancer but couldn't beat the Trump virus.
At Trump’s direction, no doubt.
Shh, don’t tell Trump, and all the other perps.
Oh shut up and stop trying to deflect the heat from the Trump family circus!!!
Trump will never "learn his lesson." because he has no soul or conscience. He'll go to his grave thinking he did a "great job." He's delusional.
Trump must be awfully proud of the "terrific" job he's doing.
Then they will blame the spike in virus on republicans and Trump.
Good news is we test more than any other country, our death rate is lower and still way less than the 2 million Dr Fauci said we would have.  People may not like Trump personally, but 150K with no vaccine is a success story to this point.
😂 don’t act like you know me. I’m the furthest thing from a racist and I hate Trump
I still can’t believe we are deciding between him and trump. This sucks.
What are your thoughts on that murderous Trump regime? 153,000 and counting!
Of course he did, but he’s willfully ignorant, much like Trump.
But you want to give the money to unemployment so they can stay home and collect more money then they would be making working. But it’s trump fault.
Bounties on military gets dismissed as fake news by Trump.
Trump and Russia. Thread is long but worth the read.
At this point he’s even turning on Fox, and you have to think that it’s probably  unlikely that every major media outlet is fake news as Trump would suggest. Especially when half the time these outlets are simply reporting the exact things that come out of his mouth.
hire me on Trump's watch!
They want the country to be destroyed so they can turn around and blame trump for it.
I mean...unidentifiable police officers who abduct people and throw them into unmarked vans are pretty “secret police” like...  All it took the “militia” to look the other way at Fascism was for Trump to tell you that what they’re doing is necessary. Seriously. That was it.
This is like saying George Floyd deserved to die because of something he did 15 years ago. What he did 15 years ago is not relevant to the circumstances surrounding his murder.  Which reminds me - why don’t you ever hold Trump accountable for his decades of misdeeds?
Forgiveness and grace has nothing to do with voting for Trump and hating Obama. It is the product of hate and that is not what God deals in.
“You do not get to violate others rights here in America...unless you’re a cop. Then you can show up in riot gear to escalate a peaceful protest and that’s cool. It’s the protesters’ fault though daddy Trump said so”
is day one ready! Not only has he taken on ExxonMobil, and Perdue Pharma, he has sued  50+ times! All the other candidates in the #MA04 race can say that they will stand up to Trump all they want, but Dave has the experience doing it.
It confirms he’s a chronic liar, will defend Trump even if it means sacrificing the constitution and citizens, believes Kremlin over US Intel, is not working for the people but is working for Trump.
Screen shot of recent text messages from Trump Campaign. They’re morons! I only get them because I reserved tickets to a rally as a joke.
Does anyone besides me who thinks Trump is having a nervous breakdown. He sure hasn't been steady these days.
EVERYONE WANTS TO BLAME PRESIDENT TRUMP FOR THE DEATH ILOF BLACKS, BUT PLEASE REVIEW THE STATISTICS OF BLACK DEATH DURING THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION AND THE COUNT CONTINUED RISING BEFORE OUR PRESIDENT TOOK OFFICE!
Wrong Frank!   It’s used by hundreds of doctors across the country even before studies showing it works and safe.  You are just a Trump hater.  Fauci has been wrong many many times.
No. Dt is working for Putin. Federal forces attacking American citizens? Trump Virus out of control.
I agree with I voted against trump
Unequivocally, yes. There's not even a question in my mind about that. Trump throws out a lot of ideas but doesn't realize he can't always act on them. Pence is equally if not more evil but is smart enough to know his way around the political machine to put his ideas into action.
Trump arranged to stockpile millions of doses of hydroxychloroquine, as usual pissing away our money needlessly.
How can he pardon them if he doesn’t believe they did nothing wrong? 🤔 Again, Trump admin ignoring US Intel and going with Kremlin Intel...
I disagree. The extremes on both sides are nuts but given a center left candidate like Biden doesn’t need to do anything to open up a 10 point lead over Trump tells me the right is losing the middle.
It's officially the Trump Virus.
trump the coward that would not go to war,  get's his enjoyment having storm troopers beat up a  woman, who did nothing but legal protest. I t is now an embarrassment to be know9n as an american

the voter fraud will be from trump preventing people to vote
Donald Trump and Jeffrey Epstein competed for the virginity of a 13 year old girl. Trump tied her to a bed, raped her, and said if she told anyone he’d kill her.  Also, he said this to the BIPOC community: “If You Don’t Understand Your History, You Will Go Back To It”.
Yeah trump said they were coming out in two weeks about two months ago.  I’m sure they are really close to releasing them.

Wow!!! Just like a Trump rally!!!!
Yeah you’re right - Hitler’s secret police is nothing like Trump’s. The Gestapo would investigate anybody that they deemed subversive, then hunt them down and apprehend them without cause.  Oh, wait...
Someone should ask Trump hypothetically if he was our "leader" in 1942 or 45 when Hitler was in power, what would Trump say to him. Curious as to the rambling answer he would have?
That's big 'ol middle finger to Trump!

Trump talked to Putin today to get his marching orders. Russian bounty on military was not discussed.
He got $1 Million for every product on MY FUCKING WHITE HOUSE DESK. So much for not using a Government office for Profit!!!!  LMFAO ON AMERICA!!!!! -Trump (lol)

You guys are a trip. You give credit to Donald Trump for Obama’s great economy and you fault Obama for the mess Trump is creating in Portland. Those moms and dads look super scary.
Trump like immigrants, just not the illeagle ones who rape and kill our people.
At least Cohen has admitted to his crimes, and trying to make amends. He was exploited by Trump, in much the same way Trump exploits everyone around him.
I hold Pres Trump accountable for the American People suffering. Now won’t sign anything until they put a payroll tax cut. Makes me laugh, because we have millions of people unemployed. Virus spike More unemployed. So how is that helping. We are suffering &amp; no one wants to help!
Maybe the word you missed was DID now nothing! All of the American Politians don’t give a dam about the AMERICAN PEOPLE! I have never been more ashamed of our government then I am these days. Pres. Trump you better get your shit together because u r going to lose to a imbecile!
what is wrong with our government that you guys can sit on your asses, while Americans are suffering because we have no $! For once think about the American People. President Trump u are going to lose election to an imbecile if u don’t get us money to live.
i’m not arguing fr i’m agreeing with you about biden but trump just as bad if not worse fr
basically it is a group of republicans who don't like trump and produce "slick" video content and information with the stated purpose of preventing the re-election of trump, but the founders are people with ties to the iraq war era republican establishment
My taxes went up, thanks Donald! The idea that trump took this because CNN was on him about mental decline does not add up. His pat response for anything negative is WITCH HUNT!

Trump ads showing videos with current violence durring his own presidency. Does he know Joe is not the current president? This is happening on his watch.
I hope when Trump gets re-elected &amp; starts to clean house, he needs to work on the education curriculum nationwide to prevent this Marxist attack from happening in the future.
I actually can’t believe we have to decide between this guy and trump. What a joke.
Trump might reinstate secret service for rich ones.
Are you one of those Jill Stein voters who gave us Trump in the first place? Thanks for your idiocy. Can’t believe you’re a nurse. Don’t you want everyone to have healthcare? Trump’s not giving anyone that.
Rough men? Trump’s a pussy, and everyone knows it.
If Trump was a Democrat all these pathetic politicians would be stating how great the President is handling these violent people and what a success his handling of the virus has been.   Proves Democrats and the media elites don’t care about ALL Americans.
“”Get a mask,” Trump said. “ Thanks POTUS 👍 😷They must have miss named it. It should read the Covid for Trump event.

Will we honestly be any better with Pence? Pence will also pardon Trump if the opportunity or need arises.
Trump mentioned Johnson and Johnson.  $VXRT 🚀
GOP support of Trump so short sighted. Any semi-competent Republican would win Nov easily imo but the need to get rid of Trump overrides the awfulness of this coalition, giving them an opportunity they may not get again for a while.
Why is Trump urging any actions for which he has made clear he takes no responsibility for whatever consequences result?

Yes, I’m encouraging my wife , son and daughter-in-law to vote this November, too. But they all are going to vote Trump “out” of office as I am also voting him out.
Republican legislative leadership firmly rejects Trump suggestion of postponing election.
And another unqualified spokesperson spouting nonsense so that she can benefit from the Trump grift. Enough. These people all have to go ASAP.
Lincoln jailed a serious number of journalists too during the Civil War. I think Trump should emulate him! Want to continue with those lines of reasoning?
No but FDR got an extra term! Does that mean it’s ok for Trump then?
Oh Karen, you poor dear.  You poor sad dear.  Of course the numbers are skewed.  It's reality and reality skews everything trump does.  I mean, just ask Herman Cain, right?
You are absolutely right.   I am neither a Collins nor a Horn fan.  But Collin's is closer to Horn than she is to President Trump  from what I see.  Neither tows the party line.   President Trump is the head of the Republican Party.  This add is nuts.

For those who can’t/won’t vote in person, can’t we vote using ZOOM? Hold SS card/ ID up to screen, have RMV agent verify it’s you, cast vote by saying it out loud.  “Trump” or “Biden”.  Agent cast vote in the box for you, all live streamed/recorded.
The Dems embrace the far left, will kill jobs, raise taxes. Equality alright-in poverty! Jobs will go back overseas. Dems are the enemy!  Trump created jobs, lowered taxes, forced companies home, better trade deals, etc.   Doubts? Vote Trump. Enemy of my enemy is my friend!
What if Congress (aka trump's republican sycophants) delays the election? Is that even a remote possibility?

Yes. Obviously a rhetorical question but yes.  What else can any MAGA mean at this point except that.  Trump’s delivered on that campaign promise.  It’s shocking to see it happening but no surprise.
Yup.  They’re not into debates and reasoning from evidence.  They could be but they’re not. And if Trump calls them to action, they’re on it, like the open carry crowd who heeded the tweet to liberate Michigan.

Can Time Magazine just name Dr. Fauci their "Person of the Year" now just to really rub it in Trump's face?
Always hopeful, but Biden suddenly tacking left is only slightly more realistic than Trump maturing into his job.
If Trump making up an invitation to throw the opening pitch for the Yankees isn't a sign of his mental disability, I don't know what is. This is how the president of the US behaves? Who does that when it's going to be exposed as a lie as sure as the nose on his face.
We in the USA have become powerless. We will get nothing fixed until the Trump is out of here. As evidenced by the circumstances at the protests, we cannot change things until then. Protesting is not working when he has stormtroopers responding and abusing the people there.
AND...didn’t trump buy up a whole bunch of it?
This is why some Americans may not be willing to take a vaccine developed underthe Trump asministration. How can we trust the Federal government?
Those tech companies would rather see American die than let licensed doctors share their frontline experience that could potentially save thousands of lives. All these follies are for just one purpose: try to stop Trump from being re-elected

President Trump and his son, Baron.
Great words, Mr. Bruni. TRUTH THAT.  Donald Trump Is the Best Ever President in the History of the Cosmos
Not anarchist violence, the lawlessness of Trump and Barr is both the cause and effect.
Can we recognize the Trump trooper based on his tattoo?
Trump:
Trump will dismiss the couple of found guilty which is totally insane?
That’s my be gods work against trump. He can’t even building a good wall  #TrumpIsACompleteFailure #TrumpFailedAmerica
Right, I’m the ignorant one 😂
Trump supporters her a nazi mask 😷 and them tell is Biden’s fault what world is this please tell me   #maga  #kkk #Democrats #usa
The funny part is you wearing a zwastika and then tell people if you vote for Biden than what gonna happen ( but you vote for trump right)
The opposite of everything people like you believe to be true...like believing the protests are peaceful and Trump is a racist, stuff like that. Snowflake
You hate the truth
Should we really believe that Trump has turned around on masks and distancing, or is there some other more dastardly plan afoot to rock our boat and sink it. I don’t trust him one iota.
those are JUST FINE people according D.J.Trump
just saw a trump commercial in which an old woman is watching the news about lawlessness in Trump's America and a man breaks in and murders her??? and at the end it says "you won't be safe in Joe Biden's America" and I guess I'm just wondering what's happening????
Reagan Foundation to Trump, RNC: Quit raising money off Ronald Reagan’s legacy
For Balz, Trump’s noble reminders on July 4 both that “we are one family and one nation … [which] belongs to every citizen, young and old, first-generation American and tenth-generation American” and that “no matter our race, color, religion, or creed, we are one America”...
A Feb. 2017 NYT story alleging constant contact between Trump and Russia was completely false. It didn't matter.
I can't wait for trump's version of America to end up in the trash where it rightfully belongs.
For those of you who believe the polls, read this piece:  Opinion | Donald Trump Is the Best Ever President in the History of the Cosmos - The New York Times
Come on Michael. I can’t believe how much credibility you give to an obvious attempt by Trump to change the subject.  To the extent there is more violence, it’s driven by Trump.
AS PRESIDENT, JOE BIDEN WOULD NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS LYING TO YOU, AGAIN.   SHOCKER
Oh, Nikki, bad move.  EVERYTHING Trump touches dies.
“...They are also spreading the falsehood that the state guidelines were the secret brainchild of the Trump Education Department when in fact the consulting firm involved has been doing this kind of work dating back to the Obama administration.” #NHPolitics
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
Antifa militant arrested for stabbing black Trump supporter in Portland
Good, we haven’t had enough of these trump voters bios! Definitely a great thing to focus your time on. Keep it up
Absolutely right. That nuclear button is still on the list of Trump options.
Trump has every right to protect the federal buildings from the city of Portland who will not protect it themselves.
Imagine trump lol
Antifa militant and convicted pedophile Blake David Hampe was arrested in the early hours of Saturday following his alleged stabbing of a black Trump supporter in Portland.
A vote for a third-party candidate is a vote for tRump and his overlord, Putin.

Trump announces series of executive orders aimed at lowering drug costs
Hohoho,  Trump has never done a selfless act in his life.  Screwing a pornstar without protection, as his wife is nursing his child...
Didn’t take long for Trump’s minion to ruin one of the most reliable services we have. My residential mail has never been so slow and slipshod. Dropping off bulk mail now takes an hour as opposed to 10 minutes, no one individual works the bulk mail window.
This makes me so sad. Everyone could talk about Will &amp; Jada, Trump, Kim and Kanye. Kids are missing !
...Says "they're not going to be so rich anymore."President Trump says he is ordering Medicare to buy Rx drugs at the prices other countries pay. Says it will "end global freeloading" on the backs of American seniors.
But now that I have seen Trump, I regret my decision.   Not that I voted for Trump, I didn't.  I would have voted for Hillary.
America supports trump!
Trump's biggest lie of all.

You were fine with Trump calling out your Father and Wife so how are you any different Ted?
We've been waiting for Trump to be held accountable for a looooong time.  Hasn't happened yet.
“Make no mistake, Trump is %100 controlled by the Russian mob. Aside from wanting to destroy Democracy, now he supports the little brown men in our cities kidnapping people. Unreal... “ Fixed it for you.
No kidding---trump is the reason America has been ostracized by the entire world.

Trump did worse as a businessman.  Until money laundering heated up.
And if Clinton slept with underage women, he zhould go to jail.  Will Barr let evidence come out on Clinton, but protect Trump?
Never voted for Obama or any Clinton myself.  I will probably never vote for a Republican again.
No it’s Ryun. Much as I’d like Trump to be wrong.
Release the transcripts from Trump meeting with #Putin in #Helsinki. Ask for the translator to come forward and testify...have a drink of water~with one hand~you and your  have destroyed America...highest #NationalDebt, highest #unemployment, out of control #Pandemic
It's the Trump effect
Please 😭😭😭 Trump was everything bad but he never took Alcohol away from us 😭😭😭😭 even when shit went South in America 😭😭😭
And these are just polls! I’ll bet in reality President Trump is even much further ahead! I predict a landslide!
Trump right now
Trump actually likes the violence, but never gets close to it because he is a blatant coward.

We should at least get reimbursed for all the money that went to Trump, Inc.
This shows just how much contempt that the Dems have for families especially women in families unless you kowtow...  One Twitter user joked that the anachronistic tweet would help the president "win the 1956 presidential election."  via
Agreed.  Violent protestors should be arrested and prosecuted.  We just do not think Trump is helping, on the contrary he is agitating.
Evidently Putin told Trump this virus is real - so now he believes it ?
God chose Trump and Obama
Trump will turn your strip malls into massage parlors, poison your air and water, and let Russian oligarchs launder their gains by buying his garish condos.
Yeah, none of us libbers want that.  We like a sucky economy and social unrest, too.  WE SHOULD ALL VOTE FOR TRUMP!
Any respect I had for Mariano Rivera is now gone after he supported clueless tRump in his briefing/campaign speech.
Please tell me no one is really shocked by any of this? Trump’s are nothing but snobbish trash who could care less about anyone outside their circle.  People are disposable when no longer useful.
Aren’t you missing the point that this is Trump’s America. Biden is not presently President so don’t blame him.
What grade would you give Trump himself?
WTH is wrong with you - you do know this is happening now and Trump is president and making the situation worse.  Right?  Or are you that brainwashed that you have no functioning cells left?Why didn’t trump talk about how he was flagged for voter fraud or his kids
trump DOES NOT HAVE THE POWER OR AUTHORITY TO DELAY THE ELECTION.
BBC News - US election: Does Trump have power to delay it?
So let me get this straight, Trump wants to delay the election due to the coronavirus but wants to start schools and encourage an open economy due to the coronavirus?!?!
Why blame China for what happened here??? Trump dropped the ball on us, knew it was coming and how bad it was and did absolutely nothing to protect the US citizens. It’s 100% trumps fault we’re in this predicament.
"Soon" Trump-speak for "never".
GTFO of my hometown TRUMP! Hey everyone matts pizza is down the street and with even more delicious pizza and better crust, buhbye

Trump Pushes Fake COVID Cure From Fringe Doctors, Banned by Facebook  via
Trump tags an Ohio heating and air conditioning company called Air Force One by mistake instead of his plane of the same name. As one does.
FISH&amp;CHIPS am I playing this right Mr trump ?? 🙄🙄
Not inexplicable. Mary Trump tells us, the past three-plus years have shown us - Trump can never admit he's made a mistake. Never! So thousands more must die to protect his fragile ego.
Never forget. The cruelty of the Trump administration is not a bug but a feature.
I don't like Trump. For the record.
Donald John Trump is only relying on foreign nations to get him elected like a true patriot.
THE HELP DONALD JOHN TRUMP HAS BEEN DESPERATELY SEEKING:
is no trump supporter
I’m always amazed how dumb wanna be reality stars r for trump like he doesn’t care about you or for Rosie her own rights as a Lgbtq 🏳️‍🌈 woman
Trump says he will not pay respects at ceremony for John Lewis
Absolutely ridiculous how loyal Barr is to Trump. Jim Jordan started right in with his lies and conspiracy theories too. The entire GOP crew is swirling the drain now anyway so not much longer and this nightmare will be over, then the prosecution  begins.
Vote for Donald Trump, or any Republican, ever.
Follow both Adolf Trump and Barr right into the toilet. Get ready for a reboot of politics in the US. You guys have screwed things up for fa r to long. Blue tsunami in November.
via  Baseball is really Mr. Potato-head... he couldn’t get a position on Charlie Brown’s team and they lose every game! This guy is nuts...
Trump is consistently a disgrace. His style hasn't changed.
Goodnight everybody. I'd love to stay on and do whatever it is we do here, but Mary Trump's book came a couple of days ago, and I can't put it down. I know, pray for my self-care, such as it is.
WHAT DOES RUSSIA HAVE OVER donald trump? ANY TAKERS? WELL I HAPPEN TO KNOW. DOES THE TERM ‘ GOLDEN SHOWERS’ RING A BELL? EMBARRASSING AT BEST FOR A PRESIDENT WHO DIDN’T HAVE THE POPULAR VOTE.
Trump to send 'surge' of hundreds of federal agents to cities
The people who have been attacked for no reason during these protest. That’s who these athletes are hurting. People look up to them and if they do it. Then it must be ok and they protest. The one woman who dumped paint on blm in front of trump plaza gets it. And she was arrested
I’m not sure that John Lewis would have wanted him there but it is a simple matter of respect. Trump does not have the least bit of respect for a true American hero
Susan Rice trolling Trump. #SusanRice

trump’s plan to reduce protesters IS A HUMONGOUS FAILURE!!!!
question if the covid 19 came and u was still president would u give everyone stemuls checks like trump is doing proving my facts on something.
No one is undecided who has a TV and/or can read. It’s an old media thing to signal fairness and objectivity, but in the time of Trump it’s a journalistic failing.
trump’s gassing his own citizens! Does the name Assad  ‘ring a bell?
Become an expert in everything you don't know about so you can be a Trump administration aide.
Thanks for what you are doing! Next time you're on, please give us three concrete actions we can take to help suppress the spread. We are desperate for a sense of personal agency. Mary Trump is right - Trump will do nothing to save us.
Perhaps.
Not going to happen. Trust me.

The last time I checked this country is a democracy not a dictatorship.The preamble of The Constitution starts with these 3 words WE THE PEOPLE not with donald trump is all that matters. Perhaps one of his people could read and explain to him the Constitution &amp; Bill of Rights.

Bye bye Susan. Many of us once respected you, so you’ve got that going for you. But you went with Trump, and neither history nor the voters of Maine will be kind to you.
Childish to call this pandemic the “Trump” virus 🦠  Even the Democratic base is smarter than to accept that from the third person in line to the Presidency.  Seriously!Trump’s resignation is the only chance GOP has of keeping the WH and the Senate.
Sad for you to assume I’m jaded by opinion pieces when they aren’t in fact opinions but facts. I honestly feel sorry for you Derek, that you actually think Trump is a truthful and innocent man.
Everyone who is part of the  is a Republican but anti-Trump and his Congressional supporters/enablers

Trump to resign
no, actually not true. i’m a bernie girl. but i’d just rather prevent trump. that is all it is. no emotions. just not trump. i believe we the people are at war with trump and that we only have one shot. and it’s too late for new tactics. for me it’s simple as that. prevent 2016
This feels like the Oct 7th acess Hollywood day when the most catastrophic news warning about russian interference just flew under the radar..Amidst the job no's,Obama speech, trump tweets,no one is paying attention to this    plz sound the alarm bells
I might be misinterpreting it, but I don’t think the fictional patient has COVID; he’s just been in a coma for 3 1/2 years due to a car accident, has woken up, and has no idea what Trump has done. The family is wearing masks to protect him from COVID.
We’re just asking you to stay on course and not let manipulator Trump divert you with his daily (hourly?) shiny object distractions.
You need to click on the tweet and look what he is retweeting. A major Trump supporter switching up
It really is unbelievable how the media portrays this. They want trump out so bad they are willing to lie and have no journalistic integrity what so ever. it really is pathetic.
Steve can blow it out his ear.  I could not care less that suddenly one more ridiculous distraction comment has got his attention.  Trump was a trainwreck, lying, misogynistic, xenophobic, racist con man danger to America from day one.
It is critical that we pray every day morning ,noon, night FYI President Trump to be re-elected 2020. By Gods Grace #prayforPresidetTrump
Don’t tell Trump. He’ll probably try to contest that election too.

Trump is very much involved. Very!
"Having a fantastic time," said #HermanCain at the Trump rally without his mask. Thanks to Dr. #DemonSperm, a lot more people will be having a "fantastic time" without masks now, too.
At least you owned up to your shit take about Biden saying Trump would try to delay the election. The bar is never too low for Trump.
Two of my siblings are big Trump supporters. My sis, is posting the crap touted by that crazy minister &amp; then saying their belief in Jesus will save them. My bro, says Covid is a bio weapon sent by the Chinese govt. What the hell happened to us?

Hillarious that THIS is the breaking point and the face that the Federalist Society is one of the main reasons trump was elected

OMG.  I didn't know.  I have a Trump bling hate a t shirt. Watch and pin. I had a bumper sticker ,Trump one scratched out. Noticed someone keyed my car.  But need new one. Already got screamed at 2 yrs ago about Trump. Sooo risk it or wear the stuff?
Now the whole country’s a ghetto, thanks Trump.
In his eulogy, Obama called MLK the greatest pastor at Ebenezer and said John Lewis was his first disciple. Similarly, Obama seemed to parallel George Wallace as a racist demagogue and suggested Donald Trump is his disciple. Join me and  as we discuss on
Don’t vote the Chinese friend, Biden❗️ We need the Patriot President  Trump❣️
Even the eagle on your header thinks Trump sucks.  Sorry, not sorry.
This is absolutely harrowing. It is just so hard to read. And my brain is on fire knowing that Trump was wishing these people well.
Only an idiot would ever let a narcissistic psychopath ever occupy the highest office in the land without some basic safeguards. Only good thing Trump has done is show how badly we need to properly vet our candidates for POTUS. Can't wait for him behind bars in NY!
Trump supporters love to say “politics don’t define character” or “respect other people’s beliefs” as if supporting a racist, misogynist, and rapist isn’t wrong?? or a violation of basic human rights &amp; decency?? So yes it does define ur character AND your view on women &amp; POC smh
Trump was aptly called "the chaos candidate" but I think he's graduated to "the scorched earth president". Leaves nothing but destruction in his wake....Putin's got his money's worth.
Funny feeling you would not get so indignant about Micheal Cohen. Your guy Brett appears to white knuckling it through every Trump related decision. He thinks it will prevent him from disbarred for lying to Congress twice.

I will never change anything I stand for just because I like you. I could fall in love with your personality, friendship etc and still block you the second I find out your a Trump supporter. It’s not about having “different political views”, you’re legit a white supremacist. Yuck
Trump is so bad that you all forget Obama was dropping bombs on whole villages of families in the Middle East
it was an honest mistake. shit happens, you know.   while i appreciate that i didn’t bother you i would like to reject one point only in your introduction: i’m not pro biden - i am contra trump.   big difference.
We can do it now.  See
Not suggesting that if anyone chose not to go public with their stories that they are not telling the truth if they did now, of course (I hope that’s clear). I just would have expected SOMEONE to have brought Trump’s name up with specific accusations by now.
3. Using a foreign government to influence his elections. The dude has commended Putin and Kim Jong for God’s sakes.  4. Using his platform to ridicule the media while they are only exercising their first amendment rights. 5. Trump was literally IMPEACHED for abuse of power.
Trump Might Try to Postpone the Election. That’s Unconstitutional.
I sorta believe this in my gut as well. It doesn’t make sense to me why ANY other victims of Epstein wouldn’t have come forward accusing Trump when many of the others accusing Trump did, or when people started going more public with Epstein accusations.

Trump thinks he’s a star. He thinks he’s the best thing since sliced bread.  “Waaaah why do people like Fauci but not meeeee?! Waaaah!”   Because Fauci actually uses science and medical reasoning while Trump employs a secretary of Education that’s never worked a day in a school.

I heard Baron's school isn't opening up. Maybe Trump should send his DHS goons to the school to make them reopen?
Trump doesn’t want science to get in the way of reopening the schools.  He doesn’t want CDC guidance to get in the way of opening the schools.  He caused the deaths of tens of thousands of Americans.  Don’t let him kill your kids.  #TrumpHatesScience
nope. just not having access to universal healthcare, nothing being done about systematic racism, zero accountability on wall street, and the same cast of ghouls running things.   the only thing you have to offer as better than trump is not tweeting. whoopty fucking doo

Seems like Trump is trying to insure as big a dem majority as possible.  Trump/OAN/KKK  News is going to be lit.  If Tucker isn't racist enough for you. C'mon over to the Stephen Miller white power hour at 9.
Epstein was banned from mar-a-lago. Probably makes sense why the past 3 years trump has been fighting against child trafficking.
Trump has no message - he is a total failure. #150KDead #VoteBlue
And see. Trump loves you too. Now please do your self a favor and educate yourself please
Donald Trump and the voters have placed you on the Democrat garbage heap -where you will soon be joined by Joey Biden and whoever else y’all roll out ...
4D chess: Trump agrees to Democrats’ national moratorium on evictions, loses election, refuses to move out...BAM, Prez4Life!!!
I wouldn't ignore it either Chris. Please watch this quick video. I believe Justin King  is on to something. Trump is not a regular president, he's a wounded fascist. He's showing his hand.
In 2017, Eric Trump’s visit to a Trump building under construction in Uruguay cost taxpayers $97,000.” Last September, the Secret Service also put in a bid to buy Jet Skis, so that federal agents could protect the Trump family off the shore of Mar-a-Lago.

Trump must go! #TrumpHatesScience #TrumpThreatensAmerica #TrumpIsARacist #TrumpCrimeFamily
The thing about Trump is that he is extremely evil but also extremely fucking stupid.
Especially critical when it comes to flipping the senate! Even if everything went to hell and Trump got re-elected, a Democratic majority senate would make a world of difference.
For a second there I thought you might address R voter suppression, or McConnell’s refusal to deal with Russian interference, but those are probably “partisan issues” to you.  In the old days we were all Americans.  It took trump to decide those who disagree “hate America”.
Chances are pretty good that he died for a trump hate rally. At least he didn’t have to wear a mask. #TrumpPandemic

Stop drinking Trump’s Kool -Aid. You embarrassed yourself on Cuomo. ... how sad !!
In another tweet worth repeating: "Trump having fun with the laser pointer watching the pearl clutchers chase the red dot."
Trump cannot be fighting for an authorized treatment for covid19. FDA authorizes drugs for x with strict instructions. FDA will not authorize laxative for treating malaria.
Jared Kushner and by extension Donald Trump were willing to sacrifice the lives of HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS of Americans just to make Democratic governors look bad.  This is sociopathic.  It is fucking inhuman.
I saw your show tonight. Please don't let up on Trump. Don't get to comfortable with his text walk back

Remember when Trump talked "bullshit" and politics at a friggen boy scout jamboree?
He seemed like a great guy. His downfall was trusting in impeached president* trump, who killed him in Tulsa.   #TrumpPandemic
I used to think just mentioning the name Rush Limbaugh would put liberals into orbit. But for the past 4 years the Trump name sends these left-holes seeking Uranis. The Trump derangement syndrome should be listed in the DSM.
Why is trump pushing a legal drug? I don’t see him pushing asprin, Tylenol. They are prescribed for covid19 to reduce pain, right? Why is trump not pushing disinfectants for treating covid19? I am not saying you lack logic skills but anyone would as you equate equador to USA
Barack Obama,   Go home to your multi million Martha's Vineyard home please!  Stay out of politics.  You've never helped the black race by promises promises and then never help them get and stay out of poverty.   Always feeding them lies. Trump 2020!!!
This is Trump’s America 2020 in a nutshell!
I would rather chew glass then sit to this fiasco.
Most of what Trump has done since his first acquittal is grounds for impeachment.   don’t have the courage to act. America, remember the enablers and remove them. Their UN-AMERICAN.
Leave it to this windbag to politicize Herman Cain's death by invoking a Trump rally to allege, without verification, that Cain contracted coronavirus from his presence there. The amorality of some political consultants knows no bounds.
Why because it’s something Trump is doing? I’m assuming it’s a bad thing for the USA to make its own meds here
trump is literally going to do whatever he can to stay in presidency and it’s fucking terrifying
Good, nobody wants to see Trump let alone hear him speak.
Until we elected Trump.  Now we’re a joke.

Looks like Trump’s approach of making obviously exaggerated claims has reached my local pizza place
She is worth over $90M off of public "service". Would love to see her, Pelosi, et al, investigated with 1% of the vigor as Trump. But we keep playing the game.

“Until recently, I had taken as political hyperbole Democrats' assertion President Trump is a fascist. But latest tweet is fascistic &amp; itself grounds for president's immediate impeachment again by House of Representatives &amp; removal from office by Senate”
That made my heart happy. Joe, I know you have some pretty amazing policy ideas but after being beaten up all day by Trump’s rhetoric I just want to feel good again and you do that. We need that. We all need to heal.

Trump Storms Out Of Briefing After Reporter Blasts Him For Retweeting 'Alien DNA' Doctor's Claims
Frankly, everyday trump/Putin take out a hammer and saw and attack our constitution.  (“I should be in office for 20 years...” emoluments... foreign interference in 2016, requesting it from Ukraine in 2020 by leveraging approved self-defense weapons...).
Not specifically Trump's administration, but he said for years that a pandemic was the greatest danger to our country and possibly the world. The next outbreak? We're not ready | Bill Gates - YouTube

Wow the fuckin nitwit had a decent idea and Trump fucking ruined it.

Smarter than Trump and will surround himself with decent people
You speak Trump?
The damn finally broke! But I got ask, of all of the crap that’s gone on, children separated from their parents, Russia putting bounties on US soldiers, the handling this pandemic, lives could have been saved. I know there’s more. Why is this the one that trump crossed the line?
it is not your message it’s the Candidate Dump Trump and run Pence/ Baker. You’ll have the GOP never trumps come back. You might lose some Maga idiots but you won’t loss the Senate. If you keep Trump the senate is gone along with White House. #DumpTrump2020

The Trump Administration forced meatpacking workers back to plants that are COVID death traps. 1 in 10 meatpacking workers (who are mostly Black, immigrants, or both) had COVID as of last month.
Don't forget a black TRUMP supporter who was a presidential hopeful died as well!
The Trump Adminsitration is trying to slash UI and give corporations sweeping immunity from worker safety laws.   I’m not going to shed a tear for Trump aides that were just fine sending low-wage workers to their deaths till the virus came to their workplace too.

Our economy is tanking worse than it ever has under Trump. If you think this is a matter of belief, then you're not actually paying attention to the facts.   Furthermore, the Clintons had nothing to do with what anyone is talking about.

There is something poetic in Rudy Gobert playing in the first game back for the NBA. He was a jerk but I credit him with saving lives  because the NBA shutdown was the catalyst in March.  Too bad Trump squandered the time.

That's what I suspect Baker/Riley are doing too. Everyone is holding their breath because trump/devos keep threatening to pull money. We are going through the motions to p/u fed money. Any chance of opening safely went out when the aerosols came in.
I wonder what would happen if the GOP decided to nominate someone else. After all, they set the rules for their convention and there is nothing to make them choose Trump.
Simple Answer:  He is a Trump Cult member.
We will vote for President Trump again!!  He's a brilliant president who's putting the USA first and foremost.  So many have become disenfranchised with the Democratic Party.  They have become a communist party, set out to destroy our happiness.

What total tosh, you're just making stuff up - here are the charges.   Show us where he is charged with covering up Trump perjuring himself?   If what you claim were true, since he was convicted of all charges, why isn't Trump now up on charges of perjury?
Yes—Trump, destroy America—Biden, Revive the rule of law.
Trump could make cadets go back to West Point so he could give the commencement address uninvited. He could weasel his way to first pitching at Yankee Stadium uninvited.  But he couldn’t go to John Lewis’s Funeral uninvited.
I’m pretty sure liberals would be less offended if NeverBiden lefties voted for Trump, which mathematically *would* be a vote for Trump, because they’re fixated on binary thinking and find a non-big party vote cognitively dissonant.

Mel there's still time to delete this  Yes Trump and his family sucks.  But they even said this was supposed to symbolize equality and the BLM movement beforehand...
Trump is setting himself up to wake up the day after and launch a scorched earth "toldja so" campaign to get the results thrown out. He will stoke the rage of his pandemic-addled base, encouraging the boogaloos to march on state capitals and provoking more street violence. /2
C'mon,  Trump does *not* want to ban vote-by-mail, and he does not want to move the date of the election. He wants us to vote on Nov 3, and he wants *lots* of us to vote by mail. This is all about Operation November the Fourth. /1
trump and the Republican clowns have sent the economy down the sewer. #AmericaStrongerWithBiden
The importance of what  says here cannot be overstated. Any discussion of Trump's attacks on vote-by-mail or any other electoral process that does not focus on Operation November the 4th is doing the country a grave disservice.

When trump speaks Live on TV, I wonder how many people are cussing and yelling at their TV?
They do it all the time and I can't blame them because it works. I think any token resistance Romney puts up to Trump is 100% party approved so that in 4 years they can trot him out for president again and say "Look, we've always been opposed to Trumpism" and they'd win

All Trump needs is a handful of sycophant Govs to delay their elections to sow chaos, and manufacture a crisis.  Imagine GA, FL, NC, AZ  all postpone, and Biden gets to 267 electoral votes on Nov 3.
Trump/gop policies continue to increase deaths.They WANT people to die off to keep control over all.  We can't sit back and watch like a DP that sabotaged the one politician capable of pulling us out of this terrifying mess.  They rig &amp; offer weak unfit Biden. We can't cave. Act.
One less vote for Trump. I'm guessing his rallies are going to cause a lot of that.
Listen. Trump does not want to move the date of the election. He does not want to eliminate vote-by-mail. He very much wants *other* people to want those things. This is Operation November the Fourth.   He expects to lose. /1
So out of all things to worry about in this world rn Trump wants to delay the election????????????
Listening to President Obama is such a breath of fresh air after these past four years.   It doesn’t surprise me that Trump is the worst president possible in the 21st century, it just stresses me out thinking how much more damage his administration can and will do.  Soon. VOTE!!
Why didn't u believe your estimable colleagues &amp; compatriots who understood this was clearly coming. UR just like  unwilling to see that Trump has unabashedly shown who he is, &amp; that he'll never change! U &amp; your  have let America slide so far already. Wake up!

Trump has telegraphed multiple times his intent to somehow block the election. And if it happens, he is unlikely to except a defeat.
Your fragile ego and gross incompetence led to his death.  You lie about the severity of Trump Virus, hold super-spreader rallies, and people die.  But then again, 152,000 deaths means nothing to you.  You are responsible for these deaths.

If you had asked any Republican congressperson two weeks ago about Trump floating the idea of unmarked vans with unidentified 'federal' agents abducting demonstrators like out of a banana republic, not a one would acknowledge the possibility of it as anything other than a joke.
So Trump now suggests delaying the election for "safety reasons".  COVID went from "a hoax" to so serious we should DELAY THE ELECTION in 2 weeks.
GODDAMN The Headlines for that Trump BS are so vile and anemic, so weak-kneed and pusillanimous.
The only issue I have with Herman Cain getting owned by covid, is that he is the only one in the trump administration who has, so far. not going to say fingers crossed because laws but... you never know.
You are only saying this because you hope to remain above the law yourself. I'd be worried if I were you. Trump is only this loyal to followers who have more on him than he does on them. That's not you, Lindsey. You're disposable.
It's sweet, though, that well after he knew Cain, the former CEO of Godfather's Pizza, had died, Trump tweeted a glowing endorsement for a Trumper who runs a pizza joint. Guess which of those tweets it's more likely Trump actually wrote himself?
You congratulated a Trump supporting Pizzeria owner hours before acknowledging that Cain, the former CEO of Godfather's Pizza and also a supporter, died of a disease he caught attending your wantonly dangerous and unnecessary rally.
Too bad drug addicts can't donate.  Trump needs to be piss jarred.

Mike Pompeo just testified under oath that *Barr* will decide if Trump—despite having no constitutional authority to do so—can *announce* he's moving the election.  Read that multiple times and then retweet this. We're witnessing a historic threat to rule of law.  Keep this going
Trump's attacks on the election must - MUST - always be framed first and foremost as tactical moves in Operation November the Fourth. He doesn't want to move the election or to ban mail-in voting. He wants those things to happen so he can wake the next day and reject the results.
Thank you,  Have you read Gary Hart's recent op-ed about presidential emergency powers? Please read &amp; share with your colleagues and begin an investigation asap regarding the scope of these powers and how they might impact the election.
Trump wants to delay the November election until  - to use  his word -   it's "safe" . Presumably he means "safe" for him. For the rest of the country the word to be applied is "disastrous". Witness the pandemic. He must not be allowed to get away with this insanity!

That is nothing compared to the amount of money ivanka, Don Jr. Eric and their spouses have gotten. A pittance in company to the tens of millions Trump has  grifted. The big difference is that w/ Trunp it is U.S. Taxplayer money or campaign contributions illegally paid.

Thank you for standing up to Trump, but we need to do a lot more to protect our elections from foreign interference and to fight voter suppression tactics.
What are you doing to protect our Election from attacks from Russia, China and other countries? Very little has been done since 2016 because Trump and the Republicans have no desire to have fair elections.

Yeah I think that our generation is definitely cynical. But if people had to put money down on trump or Biden as much as they’d like to make a hot take about society they’d put it on Biden. You can’t look at evidence and say w a straight face that Trump has better than 50% odds.
You threw America under a bus once Trump became elected. #Resign #TrumpPandemicFailure
But did they get rid of sanctions on Russia? Did any of them spend years trying to build a hotel in Moscow in partnership w/ Putin? Did any of them sell real estate at a grossly inflated profit to Russians w/ ties to Putin? Trump did. Fact. Truth. Look into it.

Is every member of  trying to lose?  Most of us in this country support BLM,  and are dead set against losing our health insurance because of the Republican party's attempts to repeal the ACA.  Trump supporters need to open their eyes!
I believe that trump is the only person Putin has something really big on.  I bet trump's financial records would reveal a lot in that area.
You mean the idiots in his district. Who also support Trump.
There will be millions like her dancing in the streets when  loses.  All cities should start organizing their "Good Riddance Trump" celebrations now.  That will be the biggest party ever!  I'm going to buy the best party clothes I can find.😊
And you have to use that data, because Trump won't let the CDC have or distribute that information anymore.
"In America if you are white, you should not have to set eyes on a brown person who isn't working for you," Trump continued. "I said it like I just think poor people are disgusting, but you all know what I meant."
"I know it sounds like I'm talking exclusively to white people," Trump continued, "But that's only because I want white people who are afraid of browns to vote for me. Because whites are scared of browns, and that's good for me."
"You will never again see a poor or be bothered by knowing they exist," Trump continued. "you will never need to wonder about where Low incomes live or how they survive outside your Suburban Lifestyle Dream. We won't allow them to trouble you.They will disappear like a miracle."
Well if you think about it Kodak made some pretty nasty photographic chemicals in their day.  So bleach is not that far off.  They also made various flash products so I am sure they can build one that you can shove up your ass and let her rip.  Trump is a fucking idiot.

You really believe that mitchy? Then give back all of the tax bonuses trump provided to the top 1% for sitting home and doing $hit while the rest of us worked our asses off for miniumum wage so we wouldn't  be homeless.
Failing up has always been Trump's greatest skill. Promoting and empowering failure is just Trump's version of paying it forward. He wants totally unqualified people to have the same chance to ruin things he had. It's kind of sweet, really
Small businesses are vital to our economy but are being forced to close at an alarming rate.   Why does the HEALS Act include $18 billion for the military, and $1.75 billion for a new FBI Headquarters?  Neither of these items are related to Covid 19 and we all know why Trump (2)

Too bad the bulk of the media still doesn't know or doesn't want to report anything negative on issues surrounding Trump, Barr, etc. Accountability seems a dirty word.
If you are a Trump supporter/apologist then I assume you already had sex with a demon. Why else would you continue to support him after (points to the last 3+ years) this.
well, maybe its because hes abused and gotten away with power because of the office...it makes sense if you think about it. Idk man, my fam knows trump, mans a pedo and a racist and yall gargle him up like hes jesus and i laugh so fucking hard

There’s no such thing as “Democrat Ballot Harvesting”. You’re just doing the same shady shit as Trump.
And u know this,how? Perhaps u believe the(Witch)Dr. Stella Immanuel(who tRUMP doesn’t know).He speaks highly of her because she claims the use of hydroxychloroquine cures the COVID Virus &amp; he has promoted its use,even though the CDC &amp; Dr. Fauci have cited tests to disprove this.
Trump's use of the Socratic Method are the most triggering.
Trump’s use of the Socratic Method in his tweets are the most triggering.

Save it DR BUCK TOOTH!  Sounds like a smart Board of Pharmacy to me!  It’s well known that hydroxychloroquine does not help with the coronavirus!!  It’s just the puppet herself spreading Trump FAKE PROPAGANDA!! Save your breath nobody cares what your opinion is anyway!!
My thoughts exactly, especially when I seen the clip of Warlord bullying a black wrestler into being an MJF Supporter.. Is this how they see Anti Trump supporters?
Say the complete facts BUCK TOOTH! Herman Cain a staunch Trump supporter who followed him to Tulsa for his rally wearing no mask &amp; diagnosed two weeks later with Covid-19! He now is gone! How many other people who attended Trump’s STUPID rally have suffered the same fate!!
This MJF shit rubs me the wrong way, not his fault but the  fault of Tony Khan. MJF is suppose to be anti-Trumpers and Moxleys suppose to be trump? A little tone deaf imo but maybe I'm looking too into this.

WHEN I HEAR  SAY I'M AS RACIST AND CORRUPTED AS THE  THAT I REPRESENT I SAY THAT HE IS TELLING THE TRUTH. HAVE YOU EVER STOP AND THINK PEOPLE CAN AND WILL PAY ATTENTION JUST TO SEE HOW LOW CAN YOU GO? CASE IN POINT ; APPLES
The Green Party has the better platform.  Biden is a Republican.  Look at his history and platform. If that doesn’t convince you, perhaps the large number of republicans backing him will. If so many republicans are against Trump, why didn’t they run an alternate candidate?
Then why did Trump &amp; his father block Blacks from renting their apartments (for which they were sued &amp; lost)?  Even a “successful Black American”!
Great to be in the land of the great spread of COVID &amp; see every person in that crowd not wear a mask! 150,000 total deaths in this country today! I think we should rename this the TRUMP VIRUS, as Don Lemon says!
We must DUMP TRUMP!
Trump &amp; Barr are corrupting our right to free elections.
If Trump is breaking our laws &amp; attempting to disrupt the voting process in his favor. He needs to be prosecuted for breaking our laws and disrupting our voting process!  Trump MUST be removed from Office!  He is UnAmerican!
Trump is violating our laws is he is ordering the slowing of the mail service!
Trump would jail us in mass.  Greed is his game.
Dump Trump!
Trump is trying to prevent people from legally voting!  Wants to cheat to win!  We don’t need or want dictatorship in the USA 🇺🇸!  Dump Trump!
Make this go viral.  Trump is trying to affect the outcome of our Presidential Election.  Trump is undermining Americans voting rights!    Trump so disrespects our free election process, he has said he might not accept the results if he loses. The military may have to remove him.
Does the President have the legal right to do this?  Especially is it affects people’s right to vote?  Sure Trump is violating some law!    Dump Trump!  He tearing at the fabric of our system because he wants to be an authoritarian dictator.  We need to save the USA from Trump!
i believe kanye really still on trump side and he only running to take away votes from biden so trump wins again. a JOKE

Epstein was a slime ball &amp; everyone knew it! Trump  was busy building things &amp; well, we know what Epstein was doing! Trump threw him out of Mar a Lago for unfit behavior! Trump had a real estate course, his Casinos weren’t a good investment. He is not a criminal!

Um...this is actually Trump's America. Biden isn't the President yet as far as I know.
Mo and others keep saying that Trump is intentionally being divisive. Some will say it “plays to his base”, but Trump knows that he needs more than his base. He would only get HALF of the votes!!
Rand Paul is a buffoon just like trump.
Fuck Joe Biden, but this guy is literally using a video of Trump’s CURRENT America saying it “would be” Joe Biden’s America, and a few people are rocking with it. Sheep. Fucking sheep.

How can you claim Trump”continues to provide leadership on a daily basis”?When is he going to start? Where’s the leadership to provide the tools to fight this pandemic(provide testing &amp; PPE’s),to help open the schools, to confront Putin about paying to have our soldiers killed!
It IS gonna take a long time to make America great AGAIN! Biden might need two terms to undo the damage tRUMP has done!
I think you left caps on bud. But um... Did you not see the fox interview with Pres. Trump recently? He was asked why he was going to veto a bill that included relief to solders, even though they were heavily in favor of it. He replied with,"I don't care what the military says."

Seriously over 140,000 dead and Trump wishes a know sex trafficker well ! This is how I feel 🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
I can’t even with you idiots anymore. Trump put him up there to only contradict everything he said. Why because he was overshadowing poor trumpy and he couldn’t take it. When Fauci got better ratings he was pulled.  He hasn’t gone anywhere. He just doesn’t care for T’s narrative.
Fauci isn’t our leader. He heads the CDC which tRump refuses to acknowledge as having any intelligence or experience in their respected lifelong fields. The president repeatedly contradicted Fauci within minutes of him speaking then refusing questions! Come on! It was televised.
Oh last I checked tRump stopped listening to Fauco so who are you really pissed at?

If everything Trump says that has to be defended later by every right wing pundit and everyone that works for him because “he didn’t mean it “ or he was “just kidding”. His ball busting is just as horrible as him being president and he needs to just... Eat some demon semen...
Unfortunately, Herman Cain was murdered by Donald Trump.

So, as my son pointed out, under the 20th amendment  ‘s term ends on January 20th. Delaying the election would not extend his term. ( my son has read the constitution way more than Trump has).

Too much winning, Huh Trump?
I’m sure you are working on a corrupt way to use it to your advantage.  Worst president ever!!!  Trump for prison 2020.
This is why Trump left it up to the states because Trump didn't want to break his oath to the Constitution as easily as the Democrats were.
“‘Never in the history of the country, through wars, depressions, and the Civil War have we ever not had a federally scheduled election on time, and we’ll find a way to do that again this Nov. 3,’ Mr. McConnell said.”  Small mercies.

No no. Not the covid virus.. the Trump Virus 🦠
The issue is he’s one of these white guys that is very nice to those in his circle but claims Democrats will tax him more (yet he’s working class), so Trump is better. And despite being “nice” is inexplicably unphased by all the evil shit.

Knowing there are people there voting for Trump just to make “the libs” angry or to “get revenge” for having had a Black president makes me sad for humanity. They don’t support Trump for what he does FOR them but because they take pleasure in the evil he does TO others.
Anyone who has common sense, critical thinking ability and understands Trump wants to be a "King"(or tyrant(however you want to address it up)). He is a psychopath, no different than the ELITES' who put him into office.
LOL, it's just too easy for Trump to bait Nancy. She fell for it Hook, line and sinker. As you can see Trump asked it as a question he didn't say he would change the date because he knows he can't but now the question of it being changed is now open for debate.
Did Trump say he would change the election day or did he ask a question? I love how you all use this Dictator bs with no real proof of him being a dictator. It makes me laugh.
“He attended Trump’s disastrous   rally before coming down with symptoms?” Wow.
And for you, it’s TIMES UP. No more trump rallies, big guy.
Yeah, Trump read a poem a few years back stating: " I am  snake", people who droll over him missed that memo!  My opine.
President Trump cited concerns over election fraud and mail-in voting.
I do wish his family well, and hope they find comfort in their grief. It must be pointed out though that he attended Trump’s Tulsa rally last month, where few wore masks and signs on seats encouraging distancing were all removed prior to the event.
But, how can he die from a hoax? I feel bad for his family, but he was a friggin’ idiot who put his faith in trump. If an idiot puts his health in the hands of another, bigger idiot, the results are foreseeable.
If you thought he was arrogant before this..  Trump floats November election delay - but he can't do that
I am loathe to retweet President Trump, but I can already hear the defense of his tweet now: "He's simply asking a question! It's not like him saying this will lead to some states trying to actually delay the election! He's just curious if it could be done!"

Trump installed an ally as postmaster general in an attempt to screw everything up. Dems are asking for a lot of money in the new aid package to fix it. R's are holding it up

Ugh, dilemma. My sister got engaged (somewhat unexpectedly) to her Trump voter boyfriend who will mostly likely vote for Trump again and his whole circle is Trump supporters. Hoping they break up before the nuptials and if not, pray for divorce.
There’s only one reason for this, Trump touts HCQ that it works. That’s all they needed to hear, that makes it a bad drug and anyone touting it as not knowing what they’re talking about.
What state and what city did this happen in? Bet it's Democratic run. Trump has offered help to any state that has the protests get out of control if these states deny the help this all falls on them.
I bet this happened in a Democratic run state with a Democratic Mayor and now you try to blame Trump and not the people who run the state.

How many times and how many warnings did Trump have to give? This now puts all other nations that aren't paying that agreement of 2% they made on notice. It doesn't mean we are leaving NATO.
Neil what you haven't figured out is this is Trump playing politics, he led with his best hand "If countries don't pay their way we will leave NATO" then 2 years later he pulls out of Germany forcing them to pay the 2%.
Trump 2020 but it’s better than being a Democrat who has their head up their ass .

No I don't think so either, Trump used saying we will pull out of NATO as a negotiation, there was a big if to that pulling out, the IF was if they don't start paying their way and stop sucking off the American people.

As if Trump has ever BEEN in a suburb. 😒
Trump is sending storm troopers to Detroit, instead.
Trump is trying to make these NATO countries keep to the agreement they signed and actually make it where our soldiers aren't the police of the world whenever NATO gets involved in a conflict. Good luck in November because he will still be your President.

ANTIFA is the military of the Left now. Why else would they deny the violence or denounce them? Simple, they’re using them to show the country the consequences of 4 more years of Trump. If he wins these riots will be in every major D city the next day. Guaranteed
These aren’t Leftists anymore. It’s the Left. Dems are denying the violence because ANTIFA is now their military. They’ve unleashed them to intimidate voters and show the country what 4 more years of Trump will look like if he wins. This is  the new mainstream Left
Trump winning will not surprise me. The DNC is losing the young base and this Biden and Trump is gonna be a showdown to the last state.....new battleground state Texas, Pennsylvania and Florida

What have you done lately?  Just more lies and distractions. Trump for prison 2020
Tom Hanks done with Trump
On the verge of donating $100 to Biden because Trump is just that bad.  (Queue targeted ads...)
Trump is stuck with millions of pills of  #Hydroxychloroquine and needs to unload them . Bunker baby and his team have lied so often even it is true no one will believe  it. He is the president that cried wolf.
I’m a little scared that Biden went to the Capital. I got a black mask when Trump made fun of his.

Importantly for. 45  and co she appears blond and realitively young more trump type casting
How exactly do you “deal with a pandemic”? If Trump made everyone stay inside you’d call him a Fascist. Open the country up, he’s a murder. There’s no reasoning with people like you, which doesn’t make Trump the problem. It makes you the problem.

Oh that investigation that proved Trump did nothing wrong and Democrats were spying on his campaign? The one still being investigated as we speak? That backfired a little bit, would you say?
Democrats are burning down their cities and blaming Trump but we lost our way? If I burn down my house do I get to blame the Governor? I voted for Obama because I BELIEVED in what he was selling, 8 years of things only getting worse. Democrats turned me Republican. Find your way
What’s the scoreboard right now with Democrats investigating Trump again?
The fact that Democratic leaders are not just allowing but aiding in burning down their cities just to try and win an election is insane. More insane, the people who don’t see that’s what’s happening. They blame Trump? If I burn my house down, can I blame the Governor for it?
De Blasio rips Yankees for allowing Trump to throw first pitch at Yankee Stadium  via
You all better know the Constitution if you come at me because I know it in and out up and down. I know exactly what powers a President has and powers a President does not have. So you all better come with facts because nothing Trump has done is illegal or unconstitutional.
Too bad
I would really love to hear you all explain how Trump has overstepped his power  as a President and what he has done to make him a Dictator? I want facts.
No he is not a dictator because we have 3 branches of Government , you can tell me he's a dictator when he somehow gets rid of the legislative and judicial. Everything Trump has done is well in the power of any President. You all need to learn what a dictatorship is.
Trump intends to restore the space to more resemble the original design and formation of the Rose Garden, established by President John F. Kennedy, and implemented in 1962.
What a FRUMP that Trump is 😂
Trump will work in the prison laundry.
Me, sensually: Trump Pence 2020  You:
will you lift the travel ban for the Northeast US states where Covid is under control?  I’m a Canadian living in Mass and want to bring my US partner to buy real estate! And if you do that it will tweak Trump so that’s a bonus.
That should tell you something Trump doesn't care about veterans or anybody else for that matterHow many KNEES were taken??  SCREW obama.  Funny the only ones watching were democrats!!  The Rest Of Us Were BUSY Doing More IMPORTANT Things!! 4 MORE YEARS PRESIDENT TRUMP 🇺🇸
THANK GOD FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP!! HE  IS THE ONLY PRESIDENT THAT CAN SAVE OUR COUNTRY!! 4 MORE YEARS PRESIDENT TRUMP
You mean Trump, right?  Putin’s butt boy in DC.  That traitor.  Treasonous by the way. There’s an “a” in there.  You already know that.  Still, you spell it wrong.  Why?
Yet look who’s in office! Electoral voting system worked as it should have. Trump 2020
Smart ,I accept this GOP who is country over party any day. Please encourage other GOP not to vote for Trump  an extremely dangerous man.
You do not know anything. I hate GOP who are complicit with Trump.
Fire the governor .Get a governor that care about the people ,not just about himself and who love Trump.
ONLY THE democratic IDIOTS were there!! How many KNEES were taken?? I DIDN'T WATCH MORE IMPORTANT THINGS TO DO!! OH 4 MORE YEARS PRESIDENT TRUMP 🇺🇸
Well its a GOOD THING only democrats were watching!! The Rest Of Us Were BUSY Doing More IMPORTANT Things !! 4 MORE YEARS PRESIDENT TRUMP 🇺🇸
There was no excuse for the Trump administration to not send a representative to pay respect to John Lewis. Pence served with him in Congress, he could have made an appearance. We need respect and decency back in the White House. #JohnLewisMemorial
PRESIDENT TRUMP IS THE ONLY PRESIDENT THAT CAN SAVE OUR COUNTRY!! 4 MORE YEARS PRESIDENT TRUMP 🇺🇸
Sorry Every Street has One of THOSE nabors!!  4 MORE YEARS PRESIDENT TRUMP! BEST PRESIDENT EVER 🇺🇸
Trump signed executive order and ramps up fight against human trafficking... crickets...
US economy has worst-ever quarter with epic 32.9% dive in Q2 GDP  Thanks Trump
Coronavirus: US economy sees sharpest contraction in decades Thanks Trump!
So right how can any church going person approve of trump? HOW?
I’ve literally been screaming this from the rooftops since he did that “President 4eva” video tweet, long before impeachment. Trump is not going to leave the White House willingly and do whatever he can to stop it from ever happening.
After what you’ve done to your state not that they’re going to reelect President Trump you’re gonna be kicked out
For those who can’t/won’t vote in person, can’t we vote using ZOOM? Hold SS card/ ID up to screen, have RMV agent verify it’s you, cast vote by saying it out loud.  “Trump” or “Biden”.  Agent cast vote in the box for you, all live streamed/recorded.
Holy crap!!  Trump killed Herman Cain!!
How transparent is this? You will see millions marching in protest in every major city in the U.S. if #Trump tries to pull this bogus stunt. He know he will lose and go down as the most corrupt and incompetent president in history. #election2020
Holy shit: Herman Cain, a former GOP presidential candidate and Trump campaign surrogate, has died after being hospitalized with COVID-19.  via
What if Congress (aka trump's republican sycophants) delays the election? Is that even a remote possibility?
Very sneaky response from Barr....laying the groundwork for trump to either try to delay the election or contest the results. The entire nation will need to rise up in protest.
hate that I have to settle on voting for this dude but it would be so degrading and compromising for so many people if Trump wins again— policy truly affects people
Trump is a pig and if you support him I suggest you unfollow me. This is blatant racism. This is America.
Trump thinks we need him to admit to the corrupt and immortal things that we all know are true for them to be believed him and that Fake news rubbish
BEST PRESIDENT EVER!! 4 MORE YEARS PRESIDENT TRUMP 🇺🇸
Trump’s latest crime? Sweetheart contract to the company HE hired to report whatever HE says about the number of people DEAD or SICK from a disease HE tried to IGNORE, then blame on CHINA.  #MAGA #MOG
Right?  I laugh every time I see "silent majority."  A silent Trump supporter is an oxymoron.  Actual/outspoken Trump supporters lose the oxy.
Stop blaming Trump. So tired of the idiocy
Tricky Trump makes tricky Dick look like carter
I mean, we don't have Trump's precious wall, so if these guys are in Portland, who's protecting our borders?  Oh...
For the love of god, someone start feeding Trump bogus professional takes from one Dr. Nicholas Riviera.
Saw this on tRump’s trip to the Ash-heap of History 👇🏼👇🏼👇🏼
We are never going to be able to break out of this hellhole trump prison.
Why does trump always look like he'd prefer to be sitting on  a toilet?
Not only that money but the millions of taxpayer dollars spent on trump's golf outings, etc....He owes us!
Again I ask - When is the washington times going to be forced to file with FARA?
Trump is a traitor.
Did you ask him why not? Trump needs to be cornered on this...are we going to continue to think it's okay for putin to pay for dead American soldiers?????
Trump made it ok?? You must also be part of the group that said trump created coronavirus and unemployment.. ignorance
4: So my theory is that Devos and Pence and Conway and Bannon (all CNP) did this to make Trump look like an idiot. After all, the public isn’t going to blame the group who organized it...they’re going to blame the guy hawking it like a miracle cure.
Thread: ive been thinking a lot about this and I have thoughts.  First, it’s totally a Trumpian oops to use this person as a representative for this drug that has not been proven to work, BUT Trump and his merry band of deplorables didn’t find them.
Trump supporter bot with only 23 followers... you are not the base
Trump is in control not the fed. This has been communicated for the past few years now
Everyone needs to vote like there’s is the one that removes Trump
Yes. Obviously a rhetorical question but yes.  What else can any MAGA mean at this point except that.  Trump’s delivered on that campaign promise.  It’s shocking to see it happening but no surprise.
This is a huge problem today. The people who oppose Trump are not Anti American. Unfortunately, if you dislike the leadership of Israel today and oppose the treatment of Palestinians then you are anti-Semitic. This involves both sides of the political spectrum.
I think about the same time the Trump hung out with Jeffrey Epstein merch comes out
Yup.  They’re not into debates and reasoning from evidence.  They could be but they’re not. And if Trump calls them to action, they’re on it, like the open carry crowd who heeded the tweet to liberate Michigan.
Trump is no Christian.
You will never accomplish what President Trump has in 3 1/2 years you had 50 did nothing
That is a very political attitude.  Sounds like he not care about the people of U.S including Trump's fan.
I must have joined the Trump mailing list when I joined the prank of registering for his event, and used a name like Dick Hurtz 😂
There are not enough hours in the day for me to say why no thinking person likes trump!
Sooner or later the taxes will be had the inevitable will happen Trump needs to face that fact
THATS WHY DONALD J. TRUMP IS OUR PRESIDENT..........      THANK "GOD"
Just being aggregating for no reason. Yes this sucks. Yes it's 'unfair' but your issue is Trump and Gov Lee. It is not SCS or teachers trying not to die.
Thanks #Twitter. Science and #Fauci will prevail. But who is this Nigerian doctor who calls herself a “Deliverance Minister” who is “God’s battle axe and weapon of war." She got a medical license in Texas?!
While Trump and Barr are cheering China putting Muslims in concentration camps and ignoring Russua putting bounties on our military
Define antifa...Trump and Barr are the Enemies of America
Trump is ramping up his ad buys on #Facebook. His ads have included false content. Facebook can't be trusted to do the right thing. Feds must investigate and act!
This has to be an ethics violation.  Trump HSN.
Can Time Magazine just name Dr. Fauci their "Person of the Year" now just to really rub it in Trump's face?
Always hopeful, but Biden suddenly tacking left is only slightly more realistic than Trump maturing into his job.
Why is the Council for National Policy spearheading a doctors group aimed at opening the country and creating more problems?
Everything a Trump supporter does is manipulative they know there on the loosing side of the equation
AND...didn’t trump buy up a whole bunch of it?
Anything related to Trump is either illegal immoral corrupt hateful violent murderous untrue cowardly and fake
White fence for the White supremacists in the White House...I hope Biden has it torn down as trump is marched down the driveway into prison.
Trump knows he can’t win , it’s like he is just riding this out
Trump can’t go anywhere he’s not the center of attention - Quite a genius.  Stable, too.
And Trump and the Republicans are against minorities because there all ways talking about white people and letting minorities be brutalized and killed by law enforcement
He lies about EVERYTHING! Trump Announced, Then Canceled, a Yankees Pitch. Both Came as a Surprise.
The #GOP call for an investigation?! Haha. With a pathetically few exceptions, they are as corrupt #Trump.
Whatever people hear on TV then get indignant. Whatever TV wants to spew. Not the merits of of the issue. Hell— diplomats were killed during the trump administration in Niger.  Not on TV.  crickets.
So Trump is on Twitter wining about the things that are trending about him are untrue unfair and illegal WoW isn’t that a little hypocritical coming from him who uses racist slurs to describe attacks everyone that is not with him and lets face it has done a lot of illegal things
Personally, I'm hoping some gardener plants some poison ivy near trump's path...
Kamala is hands down the best at calling out trump... n biden is not picking someone who they can't agree on much
LOVE OUR PROUD AMERICANS!! 4 MORE YEARS PRESIDENT TRUMP
Your completely delusional Trump and his Radical far right have done nothing for Americans he’s done everything for his wealthy friends and himself with his so called tax reform wake up!
Pretty good chance Trump will no longer be in office when the vaccine becomes available.
Trump is building his equivalent of a pillow fort.
4 months too late, 140K people dead &amp; we’re worse off in all aspects of life. F Trump.

President Donald Trump decides not to throw out first pitch at  Red Sox-Yankees game because of ‘strong focus’ on coronavirus
Trump  sorry to tell you,you are the the most corrupt president in  will be in history book when you pass away.  You made America worse ,not great.
White House economic advisor fits right in he’s a great liar and as dumb as Trump
Michael, it seems that local Portland officials were getting this under control before Trump sent his federal gestapo troops into the city to ‘dominate the streets.’ Moms, veterans, BLM protestors are not the folks destroying property late at night. He’s only inflamed tensions.
trump just signed 4 executive orders lowering the cost of insulin to pennies a day so hopefully the price gets lowered soon 😔
After this they May Lose their Jobs.
Kinda reminds you of a Trump rally except there’s is thousands more people and there wearing masks
Can you people ever portray Trump’s body for real?! Or do you need to copy and paste his face onto somebody else’s body to make you feel better about your Dear Leader?
“Alleged Trump supporter”..... really. Is there proof of that or are you just saying it to push an agenda?
Donald Trump bought ads on #Facebook making false statements about vote-by-mail in an effort to suppress the vote. I want key federal regulators to investigate.
just saw a trump commercial in which an old woman is watching the news about lawlessness in Trump's America and a man breaks in and murders her??? and at the end it says "you won't be safe in Joe Biden's America" and I guess I'm just wondering what's happening????
I can't wait for trump's version of America to end up in the trash where it rightfully belongs.
If course Trump put himself in the center like there all praising him
As Trump ignores laws, decorum, traditions &amp; has no moral compass whatsoever. Americans will rectify this horrible mistake in November.
There was no ‘shy’ Trump vote in 2016. There was a depressed Democratic turnout among left leaning voters who either didn’t like Hillary or thought she would win anyway so they didn’t vote. Left leaning voters learned their lesson, and will flock to the polls come November. Bet.
New campaign slogan: "If you like getting your mail on time, vote for    I bet if an ad explained how rural areas get no delivery from FedEx and Trump is trying to ruin their ability to get mail..... gotta play political chess and not checkers. 🙃🙃🙃🙃
I WATCHED REGIS on TV for many years. I saw DONALD TRUMP on as a guest MANY times. I loved every show that was aired. I was so saddened when REGIS retired. Loved him &amp; Joy when they appeared together..so many memories!!! Loved them. R.I.P. MY FRIEND.
Pence was here with Charlie Baker in Massachusetts ( in case anyone is under the well contrived illusion that his friend, our governor, is a moderate republican.  Re Trump wonder who pretends they never knew him—can’t forgive or forget his gang in the Senate.
Good, we haven’t had enough of these trump voters bios! Definitely a great thing to focus your time on. Keep it up
BEST PRESIDENT EVER!! 4 MORE YEARS PRESIDENT TRUMP
It is IRRESPONSIBLE journalism to air such complete and utter garbage. Get your head out of trump/Putin’s ass.
Yes and the real human, well the other people the 52 million out of work and no plan and what is trump doing. Why of course another day at the golf course, So tell me who has more respect?
Yes, the #Trump virus. #COVID19
Harry you said at the end there that there’s still a large amount of undecideds which could swing the race either way. In many polls Biden is over 50 percent, so in that scenario wouldn’t Biden still win if Trump won 100 percent of the undecideds? Just curious.

Trump is going to do this singlehandedly? Why didn’t he do all that in the first 4 years? Why take the risk of another election?
Didn’t take long for Trump’s minion to ruin one of the most reliable services we have. My residential mail has never been so slow and slipshod. Dropping off bulk mail now takes an hour as opposed to 10 minutes, no one individual works the bulk mail window.
Russia hacked our election with the blessing of the trump campaign in 2016 and Russia is doing it again. I thought twitter got rid of all the Q crazies??? 🙄
if Trump has the nerve to golf tomorrow...
Lets Thank Trump, because it didnt happen under Obama..
I saw a sign that I thought was a pro Trump sign until I got close enough and saw that it read, 'Trump For Prison.'  😄
Let me fix that for you: “One day, an ad showing how Nikki Haley supported Trump’s ‘selfless leadership’ will be used to win her the Presidency in a landslide, but not quite the landslide that led Trump into his second term.”   earns my appreciation!
I asked my buddy if he was voting for Trump
Trump's biggest lie of all.
Yeah. That means trump could have 100 or more allegations. Works either way.
You listen to him talk you want to cheer for the future, then you listen to trump and it Oh No!
Your whole family’s on welfare.  That’s how you dooze the Trump Grift. #grifters
No kidding---trump is the reason America has been ostracized by the entire world.
Very clever. #Trump #Dylan
Republicans going after Trump is expected.  “Republicans” going after GOP senators...I don’t like it, but I guess i see the potential logic. But I think Collins, Gardner, et al will be good post-Trump legislators.  Going after Mitt? C’mon. You’re just being a dink at that point.
Mitt Romney, one of Donald Trump's biggest Republican critics, still thinks the president will win in November.  via
You know Trump every failure is someone else’s fault unfortunately it’s his America he caused it he owns it and President Biden will clean up his mess
These are the same people that put that idiot in office. Why the U.S. Chamber of Commerce Is Suing the Trump Administration
Ahhahahaha could this election cycle be going any worse for Trump? Disaster after disaster. Absolutely love it. #DumpTrump
I don’t give a fuck if you don’t believe the way I do. If Donald Trump wins the 2020 election, there is no hope for America. We are experiencing beginning stages of a dictatorship that may take place if his policies continue to go through. We are in hell and must vote our way out
Had anyone seen the latest propaganda commercial from Trump it puts forth the idea that Joe Biden is going to get rid of the police Trump is really getting desperate you would have to be pretty dumb to believe that fiction
I didn’t support Biden in the primary, but AA voters saw something in him, that he was the most electable. Bernie would not be ahead in GA, TX, OH, IA, Trump would have reframed the debate from Covid to ‘scary socialism’ and it would have been harder to win. They were right!
Becaus Trump is clown and always  one from other countries can take him seriously.  Many people here in U.S cannot take him seriously
The PGA needs to get out of that Newark Trump tournament too.
No. Not even close except in MAGA COVID truther circles - whose main goal is to protect Trump’s inaction &amp; defend their own laziness &amp; selfishness. Also their unwillingness to take action for the common good, which is communism or something.
Haha - one of the dumbest parts of the dumbest state in the country choking on this Trump pageant. Serves them well, especially when the Jaguars leave that redneck paradise too.
You are a liar.This definitely Trump war on protesters.
The GOP might want to follow Liz Cheney she’s thinking about the future of her party after Trump is gone
Does Trump understand that we live in the same country as he does so when he tells us that there are things happening that only he sees does he understand that’s just nuts Barr and Trump are using the made up mob violence in democratic cities to attack the protesters
trump can't read. Haven't you ever noticed his finger moving from letter to letter, trying to read like a first grader?
I have been severely depressed, demoralized and given up hope since November 2016. I now have hope...Joe Biden! Democrats winning the Senate! I can't wait to get trump out of office---his administration is a toxic waste dump.
TRUMP actually made public safety worse.
Trump is an animal.He is a monster.Get police to beat him up.
The 🤡 has spoken 😆😆 Now the ONLY PRESIDENT THAT CAN SAVE OUR COUNTRY Will Step in  THANK GOD FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP
Under his eye: Trump to send 'surge' of hundred of federal agents to cities
Apparently Trump doesn’t know we have more armed civilians than any other country on the planet our country will not be overcome by a dictator
Now imagine federal agents swarming polling stations in swing states on Election Day for "safety reasons."
Hey  what the hell is going on in Ohio!? Second corrupt State House Speaker in a row! Do you think Trump will possibly lose Ohio this time? I hear  is speaking  for  next month, at least something’s going right in Ohio, lol!!!

Anatomy of a Clusterfuck White House, GOP in disarray over coronavirus spending plan as deadline nears on expiring emergency aid By Erica Werner, Jeff Stein and Seung Min Kim
We are all in a trump prison.
What is more disgraceful, that CNN failed to carry Trump's Covid press conference or that they aren't covering the shooting of 17 people at a funeral tonight in democrat-run Chicago?
Nobody..it's just come to the point where if I'm debating the honor of Trump v Biden..what's the point? I don't care your politics but if we can't agree on basic human decency then..  ?? I'm heartbroken. HonestlyTrump’s resignation is the only chance GOP has of keeping the WH and the Senate.
Sad for you to assume I’m jaded by opinion pieces when they aren’t in fact opinions but facts. I honestly feel sorry for you Derek, that you actually think Trump is a truthful and innocent man.
If and when Trump loses, can we insist that Ivanka, Eric, JNR, and Melania bugger off somewhere and not be seen for a while. we need a well earned break from these pilocks!

Fauci, an American physician and immunologist served as Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases since 1984. Do you not believe in science? Do you not believe in what doctors who have dedicated their whole lives to the medical field. Trump doesn’t
Well, we know Trump is!!!
Trump to resign
no, actually not true. i’m a bernie girl. but i’d just rather prevent trump. that is all it is. no emotions. just not trump. i believe we the people are at war with trump and that we only have one shot. and it’s too late for new tactics. for me it’s simple as that. prevent 2016
This feels like the Oct 7th acess Hollywood day when the most catastrophic news warning about russian interference just flew under the radar..Amidst the job no's,Obama speech, trump tweets,no one is paying attention to this    plz sound the alarm bells
I might be misinterpreting it, but I don’t think the fictional patient has COVID; he’s just been in a coma for 3 1/2 years due to a car accident, has woken up, and has no idea what Trump has done. The family is wearing masks to protect him from COVID.
We’re just asking you to stay on course and not let manipulator Trump divert you with his daily (hourly?) shiny object distractions.
You need to click on the tweet and look what he is retweeting. A major Trump supporter switching up
It really is unbelievable how the media portrays this. They want trump out so bad they are willing to lie and have no journalistic integrity what so ever. it really is pathetic.
Steve can blow it out his ear.  I could not care less that suddenly one more ridiculous distraction comment has got his attention.  Trump was a trainwreck, lying, misogynistic, xenophobic, racist con man danger to America from day one.
It is critical that we pray every day morning ,noon, night FYI President Trump to be re-elected 2020. By Gods Grace #prayforPresidetTrump
Don’t tell Trump. He’ll probably try to contest that election too.
Maybe you should ask Mr. Hurd if he regrets voting against the articles of impeachment against Trump.
Trump is very much involved. Very!
"Having a fantastic time," said #HermanCain at the Trump rally without his mask. Thanks to Dr. #DemonSperm, a lot more people will be having a "fantastic time" without masks now, too.
At least you owned up to your shit take about Biden saying Trump would try to delay the election. The bar is never too low for Trump.
Two of my siblings are big Trump supporters. My sis, is posting the crap touted by that crazy minister &amp; then saying their belief in Jesus will save them. My bro, says Covid is a bio weapon sent by the Chinese govt. What the hell happened to us?

There’s one. Americans first Trump second.
If COVID is a hoax, if it's just like the flu, if it's all just fearmongering to bring down Trump then you have nothing to worry about-- it can't be a "horrible statement" because COVID won't have an effect on Trumpkin's health
Hillarious that THIS is the breaking point and the face that the Federalist Society is one of the main reasons trump was elected
OMG. Could the  possibly get any smaller or more childish!You have all turned into Trump.
It’s going to be quite the twist at the end of the movie when Billy Bush brings forth the tapes of Trump’s conversations with Putin and saves America
To Trump the average American is expendable, including our children.
Don’t waste your time with these trump supporters
States will certify their election results &amp; Trump will have nothing but conspiracy theories &amp; conjecture.
OMG.  I didn't know.  I have a Trump bling hate a t shirt. Watch and pin. I had a bumper sticker ,Trump one scratched out. Noticed someone keyed my car.  But need new one. Already got screamed at 2 yrs ago about Trump. Sooo risk it or wear the stuff?
Now the whole country’s a ghetto, thanks Trump.
In his eulogy, Obama called MLK the greatest pastor at Ebenezer and said John Lewis was his first disciple. Similarly, Obama seemed to parallel George Wallace as a racist demagogue and suggested Donald Trump is his disciple. Join me and  as we discuss on
Don’t vote the Chinese friend, Biden❗️ We need the Patriot President  Trump❣️
Even the eagle on your header thinks Trump sucks.  Sorry, not sorry.
This is absolutely harrowing. It is just so hard to read. And my brain is on fire knowing that Trump was wishing these people well.
Only an idiot would ever let a narcissistic psychopath ever occupy the highest office in the land without some basic safeguards. Only good thing Trump has done is show how badly we need to properly vet our candidates for POTUS. Can't wait for him behind bars in NY!
Trump supporters love to say “politics don’t define character” or “respect other people’s beliefs” as if supporting a racist, misogynist, and rapist isn’t wrong?? or a violation of basic human rights &amp; decency?? So yes it does define ur character AND your view on women &amp; POC smh
Trump was aptly called "the chaos candidate" but I think he's graduated to "the scorched earth president". Leaves nothing but destruction in his wake....Putin's got his money's worth.
Funny feeling you would not get so indignant about Micheal Cohen. Your guy Brett appears to white knuckling it through every Trump related decision. He thinks it will prevent him from disbarred for lying to Congress twice.
FUCK TRUMP.
When TRUMP comes to New Hampshire.  You going? If he does.  Probably.  I might this time.
I will never change anything I stand for just because I like you. I could fall in love with your personality, friendship etc and still block you the second I find out your a Trump supporter. It’s not about having “different political views”, you’re legit a white supremacist. Yuck
Trump is so bad that you all forget Obama was dropping bombs on whole villages of families in the Middle East
it was an honest mistake. shit happens, you know.   while i appreciate that i didn’t bother you i would like to reject one point only in your introduction: i’m not pro biden - i am contra trump.   big difference.
We can do it now.  See
Not suggesting that if anyone chose not to go public with their stories that they are not telling the truth if they did now, of course (I hope that’s clear). I just would have expected SOMEONE to have brought Trump’s name up with specific accusations by now.
3. Using a foreign government to influence his elections. The dude has commended Putin and Kim Jong for God’s sakes.  4. Using his platform to ridicule the media while they are only exercising their first amendment rights. 5. Trump was literally IMPEACHED for abuse of power.
Trump Might Try to Postpone the Election. That’s Unconstitutional.
I sorta believe this in my gut as well. It doesn’t make sense to me why ANY other victims of Epstein wouldn’t have come forward accusing Trump when many of the others accusing Trump did, or when people started going more public with Epstein accusations.
Got that right!  See

Trump doesn’t want science to get in the way of reopening the schools.  He doesn’t want CDC guidance to get in the way of opening the schools.  He caused the deaths of tens of thousands of Americans.  Don’t let him kill your kids.  #TrumpHatesScience
nope. just not having access to universal healthcare, nothing being done about systematic racism, zero accountability on wall street, and the same cast of ghouls running things.   the only thing you have to offer as better than trump is not tweeting. whoopty fucking doo

I wouldn't ignore it either Chris. Please watch this quick video. I believe Justin King  is on to something. Trump is not a regular president, he's a wounded fascist. He's showing his hand.
In 2017, Eric Trump’s visit to a Trump building under construction in Uruguay cost taxpayers $97,000.” Last September, the Secret Service also put in a bid to buy Jet Skis, so that federal agents could protect the Trump family off the shore of Mar-a-Lago.

The thing about Trump is that he is extremely evil but also extremely fucking stupid.
Especially critical when it comes to flipping the senate! Even if everything went to hell and Trump got re-elected, a Democratic majority senate would make a world of difference.
For a second there I thought you might address R voter suppression, or McConnell’s refusal to deal with Russian interference, but those are probably “partisan issues” to you.  In the old days we were all Americans.  It took trump to decide those who disagree “hate America”.
Chances are pretty good that he died for a trump hate rally. At least he didn’t have to wear a mask. #TrumpPandemic

In another tweet worth repeating: "Trump having fun with the laser pointer watching the pearl clutchers chase the red dot."
Trump cannot be fighting for an authorized treatment for covid19. FDA authorizes drugs for x with strict instructions. FDA will not authorize laxative for treating malaria.
Jared Kushner and by extension Donald Trump were willing to sacrifice the lives of HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS of Americans just to make Democratic governors look bad.  This is sociopathic.  It is fucking inhuman.

Remember when Trump talked "bullshit" and politics at a friggen boy scout jamboree?
He seemed like a great guy. His downfall was trusting in impeached president* trump, who killed him in Tulsa.   #TrumpPandemic
I used to think just mentioning the name Rush Limbaugh would put liberals into orbit. But for the past 4 years the Trump name sends these left-holes seeking Uranis. The Trump derangement syndrome should be listed in the DSM.
Why is trump pushing a legal drug? I don’t see him pushing asprin, Tylenol. They are prescribed for covid19 to reduce pain, right? Why is trump not pushing disinfectants for treating covid19? I am not saying you lack logic skills but anyone would as you equate equador to USA
Barack Obama,   Go home to your multi million Martha's Vineyard home please!  Stay out of politics.  You've never helped the black race by promises promises and then never help them get and stay out of poverty.   Always feeding them lies. Trump 2020!!!
This is Trump’s America 2020 in a nutshell!
I would rather chew glass then sit to this fiasco.
Most of what Trump has done since his first acquittal is grounds for impeachment.   don’t have the courage to act. America, remember the enablers and remove them. Their UN-AMERICAN.
Leave it to this windbag to politicize Herman Cain's death by invoking a Trump rally to allege, without verification, that Cain contracted coronavirus from his presence there. The amorality of some political consultants knows no bounds.
Why because it’s something Trump is doing? I’m assuming it’s a bad thing for the USA to make its own meds here
trump is literally going to do whatever he can to stay in presidency and it’s fucking terrifying
Good, nobody wants to see Trump let alone hear him speak.

The Trump Adminsitration is trying to slash UI and give corporations sweeping immunity from worker safety laws.   I’m not going to shed a tear for Trump aides that were just fine sending low-wage workers to their deaths till the virus came to their workplace too.

Simple Answer:  He is a Trump Cult member.
We will vote for President Trump again!!  He's a brilliant president who's putting the USA first and foremost.  So many have become disenfranchised with the Democratic Party.  They have become a communist party, set out to destroy our happiness.

What total tosh, you're just making stuff up - here are the charges.   Show us where he is charged with covering up Trump perjuring himself?   If what you claim were true, since he was convicted of all charges, why isn't Trump now up on charges of perjury?
Every one wants schools to reopen - when it’s safe to do so. Biden can be trusted to do that. Trump emphatically cannot.
Yes—Trump, destroy America—Biden, Revive the rule of law.
Trump could make cadets go back to West Point so he could give the commencement address uninvited. He could weasel his way to first pitching at Yankee Stadium uninvited.  But he couldn’t go to John Lewis’s Funeral uninvited.
I’m pretty sure liberals would be less offended if NeverBiden lefties voted for Trump, which mathematically *would* be a vote for Trump, because they’re fixated on binary thinking and find a non-big party vote cognitively dissonant.

OMG.  I didn't know.  I have a Trump bling hate a t shirt. Watch and pin. I had a bumper sticker ,Trump one scratched out. Noticed someone keyed my car.  But need new one. Already got screamed at 2 yrs ago about Trump. Sooo risk it or wear the stuff?
Now the whole country’s a ghetto, thanks Trump.
In his eulogy, Obama called MLK the greatest pastor at Ebenezer and said John Lewis was his first disciple. Similarly, Obama seemed to parallel George Wallace as a racist demagogue and suggested Donald Trump is his disciple. Join me and  as we discuss on
Don’t vote the Chinese friend, Biden❗️ We need the Patriot President  Trump❣️
Even the eagle on your header thinks Trump sucks.  Sorry, not sorry.
This is absolutely harrowing. It is just so hard to read. And my brain is on fire knowing that Trump was wishing these people well.
Only an idiot would ever let a narcissistic psychopath ever occupy the highest office in the land without some basic safeguards. Only good thing Trump has done is show how badly we need to properly vet our candidates for POTUS. Can't wait for him behind bars in NY!
Trump supporters love to say “politics don’t define character” or “respect other people’s beliefs” as if supporting a racist, misogynist, and rapist isn’t wrong?? or a violation of basic human rights &amp; decency?? So yes it does define ur character AND your view on women &amp; POC smh
Trump was aptly called "the chaos candidate" but I think he's graduated to "the scorched earth president". Leaves nothing but destruction in his wake....Putin's got his money's worth.
Funny feeling you would not get so indignant about Micheal Cohen. Your guy Brett appears to white knuckling it through every Trump related decision. He thinks it will prevent him from disbarred for lying to Congress twice.
FUCK TRUMP.
When TRUMP comes to New Hampshire.  You going? If he does.  Probably.  I might this time.
I will never change anything I stand for just because I like you. I could fall in love with your personality, friendship etc and still block you the second I find out your a Trump supporter. It’s not about having “different political views”, you’re legit a white supremacist. Yuck
Trump is so bad that you all forget Obama was dropping bombs on whole villages of families in the Middle East
it was an honest mistake. shit happens, you know.   while i appreciate that i didn’t bother you i would like to reject one point only in your introduction: i’m not pro biden - i am contra trump.   big difference.
We can do it now.  See
Not suggesting that if anyone chose not to go public with their stories that they are not telling the truth if they did now, of course (I hope that’s clear). I just would have expected SOMEONE to have brought Trump’s name up with specific accusations by now.
3. Using a foreign government to influence his elections. The dude has commended Putin and Kim Jong for God’s sakes.  4. Using his platform to ridicule the media while they are only exercising their first amendment rights. 5. Trump was literally IMPEACHED for abuse of power.
Trump Might Try to Postpone the Election. That’s Unconstitutional.
I sorta believe this in my gut as well. It doesn’t make sense to me why ANY other victims of Epstein wouldn’t have come forward accusing Trump when many of the others accusing Trump did, or when people started going more public with Epstein accusations.
Got that right!  See
Jim, admit it ... ALL YOUR HEADS BLEW UP. Trump fucks with you all the time, and you ALL fall for it.
The Republican governor from MA responding to President Trump:
How Dare You RUDY!  The teachers in this Country are the backbone of our society. Just because you represent an Imbecile aka TRUMP, DO NOT Disparage the Un-sung Heroes of our Country. 👇
Remember when Trump said "I could stand in the middle of Fifth ave and shoot someone and not lose voters" Well, he's killed over 150 Mill now and not lost voters.
"Postal employees and union officials say the changes implemented by Trump fundraiser-turned-postmaster general Louis DeJoy are contributing to a growing perception that mail delays are the result of a political effort to undermine absentee voting."

Trump still thinks it’s a very nice shark, good people.

Trump thinks he’s a star. He thinks he’s the best thing since sliced bread.  “Waaaah why do people like Fauci but not meeeee?! Waaaah!”   Because Fauci actually uses science and medical reasoning while Trump employs a secretary of Education that’s never worked a day in a school.
Please, go on.   Then tell me all the ways Trump is different in supporting the military. I’ll wait 😂

“TRUMP/PENCE: believe it or not, America can be even worse than it is right now so vote for us even though we screwed it up.”  Paid for by the Campaign to Gaslight America.
The pettiness of the Trump family focuses on revenge for not enough praise and/or shifting blame.
I heard Baron's school isn't opening up. Maybe Trump should send his DHS goons to the school to make them reopen?
Trump doesn’t want science to get in the way of reopening the schools.  He doesn’t want CDC guidance to get in the way of opening the schools.  He caused the deaths of tens of thousands of Americans.  Don’t let him kill your kids.  #TrumpHatesScience
If Trump was not President, Herman Cain would not be dead. If Hillary Clinton were president, Herman Cain would have been wearing a mask.

I wouldn't ignore it either Chris. Please watch this quick video. I believe Justin King  is on to something. Trump is not a regular president, he's a wounded fascist. He's showing his hand.
In 2017, Eric Trump’s visit to a Trump building under construction in Uruguay cost taxpayers $97,000.” Last September, the Secret Service also put in a bid to buy Jet Skis, so that federal agents could protect the Trump family off the shore of Mar-a-Lago.
Another murder by tRump
The thing about Trump is that he is extremely evil but also extremely fucking stupid.
Especially critical when it comes to flipping the senate! Even if everything went to hell and Trump got re-elected, a Democratic majority senate would make a world of difference.
For a second there I thought you might address R voter suppression, or McConnell’s refusal to deal with Russian interference, but those are probably “partisan issues” to you.  In the old days we were all Americans.  It took trump to decide those who disagree “hate America”.
Chances are pretty good that he died for a trump hate rally. At least he didn’t have to wear a mask. #TrumpPandemic

Trump cannot be fighting for an authorized treatment for covid19. FDA authorizes drugs for x with strict instructions. FDA will not authorize laxative for treating malaria.
Jared Kushner and by extension Donald Trump were willing to sacrifice the lives of HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS of Americans just to make Democratic governors look bad.  This is sociopathic.  It is fucking inhuman.

Remember when Trump talked "bullshit" and politics at a friggen boy scout jamboree?
He seemed like a great guy. His downfall was trusting in impeached president* trump, who killed him in Tulsa.   #TrumpPandemic
I used to think just mentioning the name Rush Limbaugh would put liberals into orbit. But for the past 4 years the Trump name sends these left-holes seeking Uranis. The Trump derangement syndrome should be listed in the DSM.
Why is trump pushing a legal drug? I don’t see him pushing asprin, Tylenol. They are prescribed for covid19 to reduce pain, right? Why is trump not pushing disinfectants for treating covid19? I am not saying you lack logic skills but anyone would as you equate equador to USA
Barack Obama,   Go home to your multi million Martha's Vineyard home please!  Stay out of politics.  You've never helped the black race by promises promises and then never help them get and stay out of poverty.   Always feeding them lies. Trump 2020!!!
This is Trump’s America 2020 in a nutshell!
I would rather chew glass then sit to this fiasco.
Most of what Trump has done since his first acquittal is grounds for impeachment.   don’t have the courage to act. America, remember the enablers and remove them. Their UN-AMERICAN.
Leave it to this windbag to politicize Herman Cain's death by invoking a Trump rally to allege, without verification, that Cain contracted coronavirus from his presence there. The amorality of some political consultants knows no bounds.
Why because it’s something Trump is doing? I’m assuming it’s a bad thing for the USA to make its own meds here
trump is literally going to do whatever he can to stay in presidency and it’s fucking terrifying
Good, nobody wants to see Trump let alone hear him speak.
Until we elected Trump.  Now we’re a joke.

Frankly, everyday trump/Putin take out a hammer and saw and attack our constitution.  (“I should be in office for 20 years...” emoluments... foreign interference in 2016, requesting it from Ukraine in 2020 by leveraging approved self-defense weapons...).

I’m starting to get the vibe Trump is gonna win. It’s a gut feeling I don’t have hard evidence for it, all these dumbasses planning their victory out in late July just makes me sense it
Wow the fuckin nitwit had a decent idea and Trump fucking ruined it.Unfortunately, Herman Cain was murdered by Donald Trump.
There will be zero Presidents at Trump's funeral, and that includes Trump. He's no President.
President Trump needs to outlaw anyone wearing a mask in public for good. Too many of these SCUMBAGS are getting away w/ all kinds of crime w/out being able to be identified covering up for their crimes. Covid19=HOAX!
This is what it took to realize Trump is a fascist?   I mean we will take everyone who finally comes to this realization, but how you just get there now is wild.
The Trump/GOP attack on the USPS is outrageous and we won’t stand for it. That’s why democratic leadership is insisting on aid for USPS in the COVID Relief Bill.

I’m sure you are working on a corrupt way to use it to your advantage.  Worst president ever!!!  Trump for prison 2020.
This is why Trump left it up to the states because Trump didn't want to break his oath to the Constitution as easily as the Democrats were.
Knowing there are people there voting for Trump just to make “the libs” angry or to “get revenge” for having had a Black president makes me sad for humanity. They don’t support Trump for what he does FOR them but because they take pleasure in the evil he does TO others.
Anyone who has common sense, critical thinking ability and understands Trump wants to be a "King"(or tyrant(however you want to address it up)). He is a psychopath, no different than the ELITES' who put him into office.
LOL, it's just too easy for Trump to bait Nancy. She fell for it Hook, line and sinker. As you can see Trump asked it as a question he didn't say he would change the date because he knows he can't but now the question of it being changed is now open for debate.
Did Trump say he would change the election day or did he ask a question? I love how you all use this Dictator bs with no real proof of him being a dictator. It makes me laugh.
And for you, it’s TIMES UP. No more trump rallies, big guy.
I do wish his family well, and hope they find comfort in their grief. It must be pointed out though that he attended Trump’s Tulsa rally last month, where few wore masks and signs on seats encouraging distancing were all removed prior to the event.
But, how can he die from a hoax? I feel bad for his family, but he was a friggin’ idiot who put his faith in trump. If an idiot puts his health in the hands of another, bigger idiot, the results are foreseeable.
Invoking the constitution will surely keep trump in line
. is an idiot!
Trump installed an ally as postmaster general in an attempt to screw everything up. Dems are asking for a lot of money in the new aid package to fix it. R's are holding it up
Congress could delay the election, did Trump say he would delay the election? No, as you can see he put it out as a question .
Trump has an unmarked secret police force. You think law will stop him from attempting to seize ballots and close in-person voting sites?
Let's not confuse these "federal forces" with the military. They're Erik Prince's unmarked mercenaries. Can we all agree on that? What else has Prince been doing the last few years, meeting with Trump and Kushner? He's been creating his private gestapo.
It's not wishful thinking. The problem is that there's going to be a civil war WITHIN the military because many of the rank and file and top brass despise him. There's even a backup football, so theoretically you could have both Biden and Trump with the nuclear codes.

Does anybody even know why they were there in the first place??? People seem to forget that back in February, Trump sent 30,000 troops to Germany for a NATO exercise. they showcased their plan of moving 10-15,000 pieces of war equipment across the country. They prob just done lol
How many times and how many warnings did Trump have to give? This now puts all other nations that aren't paying that agreement of 2% they made on notice. It doesn't mean we are leaving NATO.
Neil what you haven't figured out is this is Trump playing politics, he led with his best hand "If countries don't pay their way we will leave NATO" then 2 years later he pulls out of Germany forcing them to pay the 2%.
Trump 2020 but it’s better than being a Democrat who has their head up their ass .
Run Trump the Rump out of WH, send him rolling down the Lawn; #America doesn't want him, give him a Ticket to MoscowLand
No I don't think so either, Trump used saying we will pull out of NATO as a negotiation, there was a big if to that pulling out, the IF was if they don't start paying their way and stop sucking off the American people.
We are not pulling out of NATO, so what is your point? Are you mad that we are pulling out of Germany? Are you mad that Trump is telling these countries to actually keep to the agreement they made ? What is your point?
LMAO, what does that have anything to do with what we are talking about ? I asked for facts that show Trump is Putin's guy and you give this for a fact to prove that? How does you being born British prove anything? Stay on the subject at hand.
What does Putin being happy or not about anything show Trump is his guy? This shows your ignorance,. You have no real facts to show anything so it's just you whining. I want facts but all it is is what you feel.
LOL, show me how Trump is Putin's guy, I want real facts not no media BS, I want facts that prove that because the whole Russian collusion fell apart and then this whole Putin is putting hits on soldiers fell apart so where is any proof?
"Dear American workers: I, Donald Trump, will make sure you never own a home."
(Of course, I'm sure Mr. Trump and his ilk will have no problem finding Russians to buy their properties, and hold them, unoccupied, for decades, in a financial arrangement that definitely has nothing to do with money laundering or human trafficking.)
It's worked so far with the trade agreements he has renegotiated, Also you are trying to knock Trump for calling out countries that have broken their agreement , they agreed to spend 2% on armed forces and they aren't holding to that and never have.
Trump is sending storm troopers to Detroit, instead.
Trump is trying to make these NATO countries keep to the agreement they signed and actually make it where our soldiers aren't the police of the world whenever NATO gets involved in a conflict. Good luck in November because he will still be your President.
"We don't care". Finally, Trump admits the truth.

Ok. Everyone should read the book by Mary L. Trump Ph.D. "Too Much and Never Enough". It. Is. Lit. Also it is not a time consuming read, and is well composed and written. Literally can be read in less than 24hrs. Totally worth it.
Did you read the entire article? The Intel was in the written briefings. But we all no Trump doesn't read either. And btw, caring about our troops shouldn't be partisan and the average American at the very least should be a skeptic and want to see this investigated.

You call Trump sexist yet that's hate directed at a woman.

Exactly why we have had no federal guidance.  He made sure that he wouldn’t be blamed,  the governors would.  I live in MA and our “liberal” state has a republican governor.  He has done a great job because he listened to science, not Trump.  Btw, YOU just smeared gov and mayors.

Not if you wear primer and use setting spray- maybe if Trump knew that he would be more supportive of wearing? Ahh... he hates anything a woman or LGBTQ individual would recommend, because he doesn't recognize us, so he'll continue on in ignorance... mainstay of his campaign.

You all better know the Constitution if you come at me because I know it in and out up and down. I know exactly what powers a President has and powers a President does not have. So you all better come with facts because nothing Trump has done is illegal or unconstitutional.
I would really love to hear you all explain how Trump has overstepped his power  as a President and what he has done to make him a Dictator? I want facts.
No he is not a dictator because we have 3 branches of Government , you can tell me he's a dictator when he somehow gets rid of the legislative and judicial. Everything Trump has done is well in the power of any President. You all need to learn what a dictatorship is.
A lot of people talk about Dukakis' post-convention 17-point lead, but it was only 6 points before the convention. And there was *dramatically* less polarization.  I mean, Bush carried CA that year. Is that remotely thinkable for Trump, even if he sat his ass on the scale?
What a FRUMP that Trump is 😂
Trump will work in the prison laundry.

You can't pass off to the public this being a "Trump Virus" when you were the one holding a party in Chinatown and scolding  for shutting down flights from China.
We did it in MA and right now the five hospitals in western MA where I live have only four COVID patients total.  Masks are mandatory. Shows it could’ve been done.  Of course trump didn’t tweet Liberate MA!
If you think that we're a country built upon religion - even though we're not, we're a secular nation - wouldn't you want an actual person of faith to represent you? Trump is the antithesis that.

No, but I would stand in line for 8 hours during a pandemic to keep President Trump in office.
Either it's cause and effect or just bad timing, but Trump's rally seems to have set off a pandemic.
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
Maybe Trump sneezed.
We really have to stop giving Trump a pass by assigning him labels like idiot, or fool, or moron, as if you can trip and fall into fascism. Sure he lacks a modicum of the wisdom and intelligence needed to lead well, but sowing chaos and division are expert level skills for him.
I really dislike trump but I hate biden more
Wow it really looks like we gonna have Trump for another 4 years. Man fuck you Kanye
There is no need to worry. Trump will change its course with a Sharpie.

Trump bought his way into Wharton (like lots of folks, to be fair) and threatens to sue anyone who discusses his grades. That Reagan was the best president is a matter of opinion, surely.
Donald Trump couldn”t possibly have done a better job handling this pandemic, by which I mean he completely lacked the capacity to do any better. And that’s as damning of an indictment I can think of.
File this under "Caravan Hordes and Great Health Care".  It's the GOP bullshit that Trump spouts off prior to an election.
Donald Trump should not be reelected this November.

I agree on this. Tho Klobuchar isn’t my #1 if he picked I would understand &amp; support. The fact is we would have a woman VP in the running. I’d prefer Warren, but the people he’s considering I would consider capable for the job. Either way it’s better than Trump 😅🤷🏻‍♀️

Also take into account timing of #COVID19 ? As it supposedly hit, Trump ordered 5G towers to be installed and others upgraded, and 5G wifi for schools, exposing children directly to radiation caused by microwaves.
That's how Obama treated the left, too. Trump didn't make it, he's just using the system as it existed. #Neverforget #Occupy

Hitler smiled more than Trump.It actually was moved.  Schumer spoke so long the last time, Trump wasn't actually sworn in until a couple minutes after noon.
I just got an email from the Census Bureau.  They claimed that they were sending it to areas with lower than 50% resp. rate.  They are not supposed to have this info.  Further proof that Trump already has our info, &amp; will use it as he wants.  But you Democrats all fell for it.
Nothing would make me happier (except when Trump loses) to see good old condescending Martha take an ass whupping from Mark Kelly.
seeing all those blondes at Trump rallies makes me glad that my hair darkened to brown once I hit puberty
Aww biased data - no wonder.. you think for half a second joe Biden is going to say how great Trump is? 😂 Where do you think there publications get their money from legacy OEMs. If you want to actually understand whats gonna on you'll have to do a way better job..
Trump is every bit as responsible for the death of Cain as obama and clinton were for the deaths of the Benghazi Four after refusing to bolster security for weeks!! Common sense safety ignored in both situations . If that escapes you, your ignorance is willful.
Herman Cain attended the June 20 Tulsa Rally where no one was required to wear masks. He was diagnosed June 29. Hospitalized July 2. Now dead. No one should blame trump for this plague . But the death of Cain, and others at that rally, create a blood trail straight to trump.
We need to get rid of Trump immediately
I’m sure thousands of doctors and researchers are letting people die because they are part of the deep state and “want to hurt trump.” Or maybe there have been conflicting studies . But hey, what do I know. I’m just a journalist that does research .
So Herman Cain threw away the remaining years of his life attempting to ingratiate himself to Trump buy attending a rally without a mask during a pandemic.  I bet he’ll never do that again. 😒  #HermanCain #ShuckyDucky

This guy could hide his own Easter Eggs.    You cannot make this up.   Some how, he’ll blame Trump!   Inexcusable when you’re 100 miles fro LIZZY’s front door.
“Opposition of Trump” my point is that if Trump never took office in 2016 than we wouldn’t need anyone to oppose trump, making 2016 the worst election, Bc it set us up to need “opposition of trump”, which we didn’t need prior to the 2016 election
And also would Biden even be running if he did not feel the pressure from the left to take down Trump?
Yeah but that brings up another argument, would we even be dealing with the pandemic this bad has Trump not taken office.
President Donald Trump dismissed Democratic demands to include aid for cash-strapped cities in a new coronavirus relief package and he lashed out at Republicans, saying they should “go back to school” if they reject money for a new FBI headquarters
President Donald Trump is painting a dystopian portrait of what Joe Biden’s America might look like, asserting crime and chaos would ravage communities should the former vice president win the White House in November.
Kennedy is running an absolutely vile campaign against one of the few progressives we have. It’s Trump style politics. All posturing, and it’s sickening.
Nope, Covid-19 spread is coming down, don’t listen to Fauci &amp; the fake news. Trump, go away, please. Why wait, you’re already Toast.
The Trump administration has started talks with the Oregon governor’s office and indicated that it would begin to draw down the presence of federal agents sent to quell two months of chaotic protests in Portland if the state stepped up its own enforcement
I can prove you wrong on everything you say. You look foolish trying to hate on Trump. It’s as if you’re jealous of him.  And for god sake, leave Sanjay alone! Please leave the poor man alone. He doesn’t really like you that way ‘love you brother’ he said never.
Should President Trump attend Rep. John Lewis’ funeral?
the argument that none of this matters, Trump must be defeated is, if not one I'm ready to buy, at least a valid and coherent one  but look what "Vote Blue No Matter Who" leads to - a DNC that can look at the will of the people and say "they have to vote for us, so fuck 'em"
Jim Jordan is an embarrassment to this country. He should be locked up for not reporting child abuse! Trump is probably protecting him.
