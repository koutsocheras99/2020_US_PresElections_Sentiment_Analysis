So predictable. Today, the man who spied on and attempted to delegitimize the Trump presidency, defying the peaceful transition of power, used the John Lewis funeral to throw gas on the fire of racial deviciveness, defamation of police and fan the flames of hatred of America.ü§¨
Obama can't stand that Trump beat him in 2016 now he looks like he will beat him again in 2020.!!
So, has anyone considered the massive disconnect between Trump‚Äôs suggestion of postponing the election and his insistence that schools reopen on time? Probably not because there is no disconnect. His disgusting self-serving motives are clear on both counts.
LEAKED: The Proud Boys will lead  convention-goers in a swelling rendition of "He's a Jolly Good Fellow" prior to Donald Trump's acceptance speech.

If you support Trump, I highly suggest you should stay at home on November 3rd.  Show your MAGA support to delay the election!!! #MAGA #Trump2020
I wonder if when they have the debates, will the candidates talk about what they will do to help this country (Biden)or will one of them(Trump)just talk about nothing because he knows Nothing?ü§î
One wonders if Trump may eventually get to the point of encouraging them not to participate if it's clear he's going to lose, so he can trade on this conspiracy in his post-presidency.
I will say that altho i believe trump, in his ignorance and  ' i alone can fix it' stance, screwed the whole situation up.. It's not easy for any pres to stand by with economy imploding versus risking peoples' lives.. I detest the guy but I dont envy his position.
Frankly i dont understand the 'defund police'..situation  Except it seems to be a question of redistributing the funds...but how exactly ? i dunno. And btw Biden doesn't go along with it  (Despite trump and most of his supporters claming he does)
...and the blm funds going to dnc Is just another of the conspiracy theories which you soak up and love so much.. A question for you.. Do you support the wearing of masks or not? Trump is on the fence-  but you?
Can we just send all of these Confederate monuments to Trump golf courses? It would both send them to someone who loves them and in a remote location where no one wants to go.

He's evil personified. I called him our "antichrist". Obama got many of the tenets of socialism started. We're fighting alongside Trump to stop it; thus the nonstop efforts to take him out since '16 &amp; defeat him in Nov &amp; Obama, Soros &amp; co are fighting like hell to defeat us!
Gov. John Carney (D-Delaware) was at the Delaware State Fair today. I asked him what he thought about President Trump's tweet about delaying the U.S. Presidential Election. #NetDE  #Election2020
If Trump makes that happens, I can't think what the outcome would I think that he would regrate that move. He should do himself and this country a big favor, pack his bags and disappear, don't care where just GO!!!!
Cuomo acted (not perfectly) as he thought best with the info he had.. and without any guidance from trump admin, who were busy brushing off the threat, saying it was under control. that it was from china when most cases in NY(the nation's major hub) were arriving from europe.
No one likes riots ..except maybe the rioters -who are not a dem controlled mob as trump wants us to believe  but simply some random idiots out of a group of protestors who want to be heard... stirred on further by presence of military... (and not only in dem cities)
No Cain decided to buy into Trump's false narrative.
Well US  currency needs to be stabilized.  it is losing its position as the world's benchmark  i'd say that's because of trump causing worldwide loss of faith in the country.

This is Trump‚Äôs America.    Are we winning yet?    Let‚Äôs ask Trump‚Äôs boss, Putin
Thank god he doesn‚Äôt have the power to move the election.  It‚Äôs up to Congress, and Nancy Pelosi will never agree to it.    But it‚Äôs ok for kids to go to school.    But to dangerous for people to vote.    Remember Trump said covid 19 was a hoax.    Trump still has time for golf.
IMO it is a distraction by Trump from his failures and incompetence and low polls. Republicans, in general, can‚Äôt compete in a level playing field. Then, too, he is right, we don‚Äôt like him.
He is a fascist who is not protecting our troops It is his fault economy tanked due to tariffs and abysmal response to the Trump Virus Getting him out will improve the sanity of America Dont know whatANITFA is but I am more scared of Trump's WHITE NATIONALISM Naziesque  rants
Just remember though that Trump has supporters like Barr and Prince, who could give orders to "militia" to patrol streets and by whipping up the right wing voters he could create a situation where he tries to cling to power no matter how illegally
And I have to wipe my mouth cause I kissed Putin's ass again. Punish Germany but conveniently forget to bring up Russian bounty issue. WTF are you angling for Trump Tower Moscow? CONFRONT PUTIN ABOUT THE BOUNTIES NOW!!!
Why doesn‚Äôt she say this when Trump is around - too little too late from her
Very hypercritical to talk about morals and bullying when Trump supporters lack basic human empathy but ok
He was not a great american, he was an idiot that followed what Trump pushed and didn't wear a mask.  It's one thing to die when you have tried to help yourself, now that is sad.  Doing what Cain did was just plain stupid.  Another death on Trumps watch!
After everything trump has done so far and you still somehow find the way to support him and defend him I honestly don‚Äôt care what your ‚Äúside of  the story‚Äù is .
I proudly support bullying against trump supporters
I dont pretend to understand the workings of the fed. and not really interested sonce it has nothing to do with our exchanges about trump. Or trump himself except that he seems to want to swing their decisions to his advantage But if u insist on sharing your knowledge -go ahead.

If you're  talking about obamagate my view is that durham report is being dangled out their to fire up trump base and deflect from his and barr's corrupt release of flynn and stone ..we shall see.
Peace is great but that's not what russia is looking for.. Their aim is to break up the western alliances; a goal which trump is helping along by withdrawing the US  from intl. agreements and fighting with US allies. while believing putin &amp;  standing back from russian intrusions

I'm guessing  that this is what you are supporting with your open borders &amp; stance against any of the President's orders to control the border? The reelection commercials for Trump write themselves. Just show the Dems supporters on all their glory(?). #AntiAmericanDems

Conjecture to you because it doesn't fit your image of trump.
Intel community is apparently split on tbe bounty sitn.  Trump and team claimed he hadn't  been informed (duh!) But he was given written report in feb. But made no move to condemn or even approach russia on the subject. Why?  What you 'know' is only trump's version of events
100% proven...??? Nonsense! only according to trump and his stooge barr... mueller (the actual unvestigator) Reported it differently and protested barr's account..  US intel confirmed russian interference but trump believed russia.
But if trump and his team had listened and acted instead of denying lots of US lives could have been saved. they failed the country... again.
You and your ilk are the saddest and most frightening thing to come out of Trump‚Äôs legacy. Born from the dark net and right wing rants and too uneducated to know it.
trump asked  for putin help in 2016 Didn't protest russian interference in election Nor russia paying to have US troops killed Believed putin over US  intel. Only trump wants russia back in g8 Trump family gets massive financing from russia. Trump lied abt mtgs.with russians.
You're more than ready... you're outright delusional.. God and trump in the same sentence? he hasn't done a single christian thing in his life!
Very patriotic ... trump or war ... You should move to russia or n.korea...putin or kim  would love you.
Patriots?? Thats not patriotism pal  ..that's treason and  blind trump adoration..
Very patriotic!!  Well, i guess trump's kind of patriotism... ME ME and ME  or nothing!!
Keep russia in check..? Are you serious man? Trump asked for their help in 2016.. Said nothing when they interfered in our election and reportedly paid to have US troops killed.. Trump is a russian asset and traitor. (With your support)

It will be deep state conspiracies/Benghazi 24/7. But...that stuff barely broke through with persuadable voters when it was actually relevant. If this becomes Trump's primary focus will COVID/unemployment remain unaddressed, it just makes him look like a clown.
Question of the day for Trump:  Its been almost 30 days since the public learned of Russia paying bounties to the Taliban for violence against U.S. soldiers.  When you publicly denounce Russia?

Trump has never ever been a nice guy, that tv show portrayed him to be an honest business man. He has never been that guy, he‚Äôs always been dishonest &amp; lawless in his business dealings. His morals are lower than low. He‚Äôs capable of things a normal person wouldn‚Äôt think of or do.
Who is that stupid. Really! Trump is a psychopath who has the ability to influence and persuade people to believe in him and become his most loyal followers. He used them to spread the virus, getting rid of black/brown people ...just another way to suppress their vote.
That was brought on by liberals and Democrats to ruin Trump‚Äôs chances of re-election. These Democratic mayors could care less about black people
what did we miss? Trump walking on the sea, changing water to wine? Saying something to unite the people instead of his 'us and them' approach? Offering words of sympathy to victims of covid and their families? Admitting 'he alone' CANNOT fix it ? Listening  to   'ANYONE' ?

Republicans ain‚Äôt doing the same thing? üòÇüòÇüòÇ listen. I‚Äôm not arguing what either party does is right all the time. It‚Äôs not. But come on man, Trump built a whole 2016 campaign on fear mongering Mexicans immigration. Republicans ran the war on Iraq for WMD‚Äôs that didn‚Äôt exist

Hey I'm sorry John Lewis died- but if we was so Christ-like he never should've boycotted Trump's inauguration and state of the unions. I just cant get past that about him.
It was probably a white Trump supporter who killed him because they want to Make America White again.
I hate to say it, but Trump might actually be the most accurate representation of US policy we've ever had in office.
Covid has been debunked! If you can't see the truth by now then that's on you. Covid was a hoax to destroy Trump's record setting economy. When the Democrats saw blacks getting jobs under Trump watch their lids flew off! Democrats are the party of racism
Nearly one-third of Delaware renters are facing eviction, millions of families across the country are relying on unemployment benefits, and President Trump and Republicans can‚Äôt even agree on a proposal to BEGIN negotiating with Democrats.
Yeah but he turned his back on everything that got him there and embraced full racist misogynistic fascism with tRump. He made his choice to now follow the science,  but follow his fascist cult leader. Sad that a human passed away from this virus, not sad cuz he chose his cult.
Jeff Bezos is only one vote and it's not going to Trump.

This is trump redirecting the media coverage away from the dismal GDP report.
Plus states run the elections. Plus if it went to the Supreme Court, they ruled against Trump this term, and Roberts seems pretty committed to American institutions.
Worried about Trump delaying the election?   Well then you'd better VOTE in November!

Thread by  Fascism. Authoritarianism. The question has always been, could it happen here? Because the answer has been NO doeat it will always be so. It is happening here. It is happening right now. Trump crossed the rubicon this morning.‚Ä¶
No. Make calls. Put up signs. Talk to people. Defeat Trump. Make America Proud Again

Pointing out that he foolishly went maskless to an indoor Trump rally isn't dancing on his grave. It's stating facts. Hilarious that a person that supports the party of voter suppression and systemic racism wants to talk about not controlling black people.
Seems to me that the Americans and the rest of the world should be terrified.  This looks like Trump paving the way for delaying the election.
I love a political ad with a cliffhanger. Will she or won't she?   #trump #trump2020 #republican #democrat #VoteByMail
Trump is an idiot. Period. He will never ever get my support ever again. He needs to be gone in Nov.
Wait what?  I think you meant to say a Trump to the USA
The guy in my station sure was- so much so that he *printed Trump memes out a home and taped them up in the station*.
Just watched a great doc on 'flix about New York &amp; the Mafia. They were talking about the boom in skyscraper buildings in the early 80s - including one Trump Tower!
Trump has already stated ‚ÄúNobody likes him‚Äù. He‚Äôs essentially said he will challenge any vote that doesn‚Äôt re-elect him. He wants to delay the election (something you would never do, if you think you‚Äôd win). He‚Äôs trying to stop vote-by-mail. Does that sound like a winner?

‚ÄúJoe Biden‚Äôs unfounded accusation Thursday that President Trump wants to delay November‚Äôs election was not only clearly over the line but also unmasks how low the supposedly moderate Biden will go to win.‚Äù  Maybe Joe wasn‚Äôt wrong??
President Donald Trump explicitly floated delaying November's presidential election on Thursday, lending extraordinary voice to persistent concerns that he would seek to circumvent voting in a contest where he currently trails his opponent by double‚Ä¶
Fail. Trump ended his tweet statement with question marks. You should have done the same:. "Trump calls for postponement of US Presidential Election???"
If you support trump fuckk off
I don‚Äôt cheer for anyone‚Äôs death. Herman Cain died because he was convinced by Trump, Hannity, and the rest of the anti-science, anti-intellectual right wing machine that masks were bad and that holding rallies without masks was safe. But he was complicit in spreading these lies.

President Trump Suggests Delaying Election Until Americans Can Vote in Person  via
He pinned the tweet too so you know he‚Äôs going ride or die on this issue now.   Contested election 2020 will happen. No shot trump accepts the results.  My fear is his potential ability to incite violence among his die hard base come Nov 4th...
Why do you have to lie about people to win?  I would rather hear you talk about your policies and how do you feel about rioters burning down court houses and committing crime.  You know Trump isn't corrupt!  He maybe alot of other things but not corrupt.
Your entire statement. The entire trump family is wrapped up in China. Ivankas patents, trump praising Xi for concentration camps, money, buildings, etc. But sure, bIDeN, lmao!
Yeah,  how did this shoddy hit piece age, you dilapidated excuse of a journalist?
The president has few if any legal options with respect to elections, which are run by the different states.
Democrats election strategy is ‚Äúinflect enough pain on American citizens‚Äù to scare them into voting Trump out. Kinda like Obama shutting down State Parks over Government funding...
Dear Media,   After Trump is out of office he's not owed time. This will not be the last time he mentions the election should be delayed (or should have been, after the fact). Don't give him an added platform upon which to whine. Let him tweet of its unfairness forever.
Absurd, unconstitutional etc etc, but Trump is also effectively declaring a vested interest in the pandemic continuing and that is declared a vested interest in Americans dying.
"Trump campaign hasn't yet figured out how to tamper with mail-in voting."  There, I fixed your headline.
trump is already claiming the 2020 election will be tampered with, and proposing we delay it.  this is dictator behavior. he is undermining democracy right before our eyes. we need to vote him out
Will any Republicans in Congress challenge Trump's tweet about moving election back? Romney will, my bet is the rest will be silent.
So kids, what did we learn yesterday? We learned that the Tech Giants are raging liberals pushing Biden and bashing Trump. We learned that they are choosing what information you are given about Covid 19 and labeling any dissenting  information as false.
All the blind Trump supporters are not paying attention and most of whom are already down bad and don‚Äôt have a job right now (but he‚Äôs good for business right lol) Trump‚Äôs presidential actions have been lousy. And the biggest mistake was dismantling the pandemic team.
Trump basically said  he need an extra month to catch up on the rent. #eviction

I like the spirit, but we have to return to normalcy. Unless he is indicted, Trump needs to be afforded all the rights of a former potus. Malice toward none, etc.
This is the lunacy of the modern GOP, where "American exceptionalism" has morphed into low-level elected officials covering up for Trump's epic failure of leadership by snarling, "The US is a big country, so bad things are going to happen. Get over it."
Obviously, because Trump has been pressuring them to pay more to NATO, and now he's pulling 12,000 troops.

He is retweeting a video showing that there is a chance one of your years never got counted bc it never arrived.  Trump didn‚Äôt mail the 100 vote experiment a news org did.   Plus absentee isnt same as mass mailing everyone a vote.

Not true. We profit very nicely on our business to our allies.   You hear trump and then you believe it. No study, no thought, no plan.   You just wait to parrot his next lie.
TRUMP TRASHES OUR ALLIES Germany is supposed to be one of the USA‚Äôs allies through NATO. But Trump is forever trashing Germany (basically all of America‚Äôs allies). When was the last time u heard Trump criticize RUSSIA? Or criticize Putin? Never does it. Why not?
No president has done such a horrible job as trump.
i figured you hate Trump so much that whatever he says u will disapprove!!! like if he say poop smell bad you will say it smell like Chanel No.5!!!
He deserves a statue. Reagan has statues in Eastern Europe commemorating his opposition to Russian imperialism. Trump should have one in Moscow commemorating his support for Russian imperialism.
Actually, I think her first priority is to get media attention by pretending that she won‚Äôt necessarily do trump‚Äôs bidding.  She waits until she‚Äôs gotten every last possible appearance on camera before following orders just as she always intended.
Good. I hope they arrest him and Trump. And I hope you've stopped saving pictures of random kids on your iphone.

Good for them.  It‚Äôs a worthless drug and also causes harm in covid patience.   I‚Äôm sad you can figure this out, trump and his admin invested millions of $ in the drug.  They fucked up! Now they‚Äôre doing anything to unload the pills.  Including killing Americans over it  Wake up!
Because you're a creepy Trump supporter
Trump terminated the pandemic team and gave away the PPE. He called it a hoax that 15 people would get sick, it will be gone by spring in warm weather. We are at 150,000 + dead because nothing is being done. I lost a family member who worked in a store. Trump failed.
Another one of Trump's many big lies and also, Trump is being a hyprocrit again who doesn't practice with he preaches (especially, about pharmacistical companies on the price of prepriction drugs keep going up and up).
You e been duped by the qanot creeps. Trump is a failure.  He got his ass kicked in an interview today by the BBC. He‚Äôs getting our boys killed and Americans are dying by the 100‚Äôs of thousands&amp; Raping or children.  Not Q conspiracies, these are Facts!
Trump has said equally if not worse things. He wished a women on trial for child sex trafficking well like two weeks ago. He has not and does not denounce anything to his express benefit. He‚Äôs routinely disrespectful to women in the press and denies facts in favor of his own lies
I‚Äôve seen that bullshit.  Epstien and trump were long time friends.  They had minors flown over from Russia  for a party of Two. Him and Epstien.  A rat: that is trump, tell on or blame someone for the same thing you‚Äôre guilty of. Trumps a pedo, a violent pedo!
He is right because when you are elected to be one of the justices of the Supreme Court, you go by what the Constitution and the rule of law says and not what politcians and Trump say.
I trust what Dr. Fauci, the scientific evidence and research say, that is what we (including Trump) should go by and fellow, and Trump, you are not a sciencent so, stop trying to act like one.
Once again, Trump is still so out of touch of reality and can't grasp the truth about the ongoing Coronavirus and the COVID 19 disease pandemic, face masks do work and how much did Trump pay her to lie for him?
Also, Trump's startegy is not working and making it easier for us Democrats when he should listening and taking the advice from other people.
Once again, Trump is using fear mongering, dishonesty and a propaganda of lies and misleading information and continues to attack African Americans and women (because Trump is also, a racist and sexist pig) with disgusting and disgraceful comments and remarks that are lies.
Mr. King, the trump crime family has been doing whatever they want &amp; no one is doing shit about...
Obama left a pandemic response group/plan after the Ebola outbreak and trump removed it within his first year. Would of been pretty useful
Do not underestimate the depths to which Trump will go until January 20. Not November 3, JANUARY 20.  If he's voted out and doesn't find a way to stay there, my bet is on Biden actually being 47, not 46 -- after Trump resigns in late January to Pence to get himself a full pardon.
Kentucky hated their last GOP Governor so much that the Democrat won by a very, very small margin. All the rest of the state officials are Republicans. Trump polls high in the state and McConnell is double digits ahead of McGrath. I don‚Äôt like it, but facts matter.

Not to mention, the number started to drop as soon as trump started getting data sent to the Whitehouse instead of the cdc. This is obviously him manipulating the numbers.

I can't wait for Dave, being the California liberal that he is, to knock that MJF promo for being too much like Trump.
I guess it is more accurate to state- Trump is as creepy as Epstein was. OMG- how can anyone stand having a pedophile in the WH. They were the only ones at risk in the prison where i worked- everyone hated them.
Ali, serious question. Without saying anything about Trump can you please tell me why someone should vote for Biden? The only reason anyone has ever given me is "because he isn't Trump"...
Who thinks Trump and his administration want to keep up the killing of Americans over 65 and minorities by COVID? I‚Äôd estimate a savings of $360 million per month in SS, Medicare and Medicaid payments. #COVID19
B) terrible analogy. Even if the same deep state anti Trump medical community didn't fuck with the numbers, the number of missing children trounces the actual  mortality rate and in my opinion is equal to if not more relevant. Maybe not to you.
Barr was the worst of humanity on capital hill and he is Trump's personal lackey as they work together to violate every tenet of the constitution! Do tell what exactly has Barr or Trump done that is good for the whole country! 150000 dead and counting
A) No one is beating Trump. Period. The country is littered with tests which are providing false positives and I'm positive that was the case in the beginning with post mortem tests. Who would be there to argue?  I think it will be exposed.
Trump is implicated in this.   She has a video of him.   Can‚Äôt wait to hear what the magats say when it‚Äôs released.
Trump has 7 rape accusation, violent rape accusations on children.  On live tv he wished a pedophile and sex trafficker, ‚Äúwell‚Äù.  Twice!  He has 25 accusations of sexual assault. He admitted on camera that he rapes women ‚Äúgrab them by the pussy‚Äù  You‚Äôre really lost here!

There is no way he just cut him off from being his friend. You must believe a lot of things you‚Äôre told. Trump said he wished Ghislaine Maxwell well, but called NFL players taking a knee ‚Äúsons of b******s‚Äù. He‚Äôs still a friend of those kind of people.

Wow and kudos to the interviewer- that is how you do it. Trump reveals himself to be an ignorant fool trying to tap dance around an issue of National Security. He is unable or unwilling to confront Putin on behalf of the United States.
Joe- All jokes aside, President Trump is showing crystal clear signs of dementia. This is more than funny, it‚Äôs frightening. Is there nothing to be done before November? He will do some much more damage by then.
We need every single soul on our side standing shoulder to shoulder, if we are going to defeat fascism in America. Let's not help Trump to divide and conquer by calling potential allies "sheep" just because they are late to the party. I for one, am happy they have arrived.
#97Days   The president *DOES NOT* have the power to move the date of the election.   Only Congress can do that.   YOU have the power to #RegisterToVote #VoteByMail #VOTE   We have the power.

Please have something in the law that does not allow Trump or members of his family or cabinet to profit or even apply for aid under any of this. The $2B for his hotels alone reeks of golden parachute.

New  / SSRS polls from AZ, FL, and MI show Biden ahead in all three states. Trump's approval ratings overall, for handling coronavirus, and for handling racial inequality break negative. Full results:
Biden was right about covid. And on and on. Take some alien piss from trumps crack head doctor.
It‚Äôs trump. He‚Äôs an embarrassment
In January, Biden warned us of exactly what is happening.  You‚Äôre the worst leader in our countries history and you‚Äôll fail with the covid 19 crisis. He said, IN JANUARY, ‚Äúit‚Äôs serious‚Äù.  You failed, trump. Resign!
Resign trump, today! GOP stop the silence on trump‚Äôs betrayal!
President Trump. Why not call meeting hrtween front line drs and task force? If three well known safe drugs can save lives in early Covid why not use them ?
It is a myth.  Trump failed Again.  Major backfire.  They‚Äôre packing up and leaving.   We‚Äôll fuck up any threat to our democracy.   We have the numbers.  Calling you people deplorable, was, hear me! CHARITABLE!!

How did trump pay his loans to china?
Trump is owned by China.   This post is a lie.   Read this!üëá
Trump owed 27 million to Bank Of China,  rumor is he still owes more than 100 million to Bank of China, owned by the Chinese government and to Russia aka Putin.  Trump was impeached.  Senate republicans didn‚Äôt do their job. They‚Äôll pay 11-3-20!
... ummm... and now she's dead, Charles married a Catholic (a big thing for Monarchists).We have an allegedly pedophile prince, and some bastards in the mix!  But hey... Our Royal Family are STILL better than the Trump family!

Both Trump and Piers Corbyn are fans of Stella Immanuel, advocate hydroxychloroquine and much else. Great minds think alike!
Trump can‚Äôt handle a real question.
The fact is that you turn a blind eye when it comes to sexual assault allegations about Joe Biden, but you don‚Äôt care because your asinine hatred of Trump is more important.
I don't know how much Trump is paying you, but honestly, it can not be enough.  You embarrass yourself on a daily basis, and history will not be kind to you. Money isn't everything and you're about to find that out the hard way.
Fact Check: True! ‚ÄòNobody Likes Me,‚Äô #NotMyPresident complains, renewing Defense of Scientific Ignorance

Maybe he has room in his bunker for you?  ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Tick tick tick......   We left, millions and millions of Republicans have left.   Why? Simple  Country over Party.   Trump and his administration can‚Äôt lead, they blame, lie and divide.  We aren‚Äôt turning from the truth. He has no plan
They're escalating tensions everywhere they go, and Trump knows it.  He knows exactly what he's doing. He knows that he is losing, and he's doing everything he can to demonize the left and set the stage for November 3rd.  Vote like your life depends on it, because it does.
I agree, Dr. Fauci has not "misled us" about the ongoing Coronavirus and the COVID 19 disease pandemic when Trump has and again, Trump is a idiot who is so out of touch of reality and can't grasp the truth about the ongoing Coronavirus and the COVID 19 disease pandemic.
And stop believing crazy fairytales like Trump is killing Americans.
After Trump is voted in again for a second term, will you keep your promise to all of us and move to Canada like you said four years ago, If you hate living under Trump‚Äôs  presidency then get the hell out.
Anything living, moving, and breathing that is not Trump lol
At this point, it would not surprise me if the answer is 'they are planning to weaponize malaria at the protests and want to keep Trump's instigators safe'.  I'm 99.75% kidding.

It is a long and depressing article to read- so much more inference that Trump was as sick as Epstein.
Wah wah  "He's got this high approval rating, so why don't I have a high approval rating ... with respect to the virus?" Trump wondered aloud
Well, trump is right for once that his personality is the problem.
