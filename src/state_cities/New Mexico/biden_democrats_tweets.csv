So voting is how Biden wins and Trump loses. So nobody votes, right? Trump now wants to delay the election. Come noon January 20, 2021 Trump is FIRED if no election occurs. The Constitution says so. Founding Fathers thought this through 240 years ago.
It wasn't middle-aged Black voters in South Carolina that "chose" Biden. It was big $$$ donors well ahead of SC.
Sanders crushed Biden in California and Nevada, despite seven hour lines on several college campuses. He swept the Latino vote in both of those states and Florida. Note: much larger demographic than the AA vote. That used to matter, but now?
What about the Latino vote, which is a far larger demographic? Biden's campaign is badly mishandling them, unlike Sanders who crushed Biden in California and Nevada partially due to that vote.
And now Biden's campaign is badly mishandling the Latino vote, a demographic that Sanders handily won in Nevada, California, and Florida.
Either it doesn't matter who Biden picks as his running mate, or the vast majority of respondents had no idea who these potential VPs are.

Biden isn't going to survive. He has maybe 2 months of energy left in him.
Biden is fine and is definitely all there despite what #Teump desperately is trying to make you believe to the contrary. Not sure he'll do 2 terms, so he'll be a steady, reliable hand to restore and then transition to a new generation.

The headline is deceptive as hell, but technically neither it nor the article is inaccurate. It‚Äôs up to those of us who want Biden to win to not falsely divide the vote (no one hates Stein/Nader more than I do, btw, and I also don‚Äôt have a candidate here)
Rice has deep background in foreign affairs. Obama wanted her as SOS but caved when R's threw a fit. Biden should name her SOS.
She supports Biden and said so
That‚Äôs a pretty deceptive headline. She clearly will support Biden and wants him to win, but doesn‚Äôt want a distraction before her Aug. 4th primary. Lots of people running stay out of others‚Äô races at least until their primary is over. Nothing to see here

Sen Amy Klobuchar introduced a bill to subsidize indie music venues, reason enough for Pres Biden to have her as the VP. As he vets his partners, this issue should be on a list of questions. Plus the right answer to the question: Dylan, Stones, or Beatles?

So where is the FBI investigation into candidate Biden as a potential blackmail target regarding the Biden family relationship with both China &amp; Ukraine?

Additionally, the claim in their original post that the vast majority of Americans are centrist is absurd--so assuming every one of Biden's policies were indeed perfectly centrist would mean having an agenda that does not, in fact, represent most of the country.

This country has no chance whatsoever if Joe Biden is elected. An old cheap retail political  hack who has had his fat hands in everyone's pockets for part of two centuries. If you want to know what it was like last century vote for Joe. He was among the worst in the worst of all
Imagine thinking that anyone is so pro Biden that theyd go ahead and find a recently deceased person who is still somehow registered to vote along with their social security and ID info and perfecting a forgery of their signature in order to vote for him twice instead of once
Dude you can‚Äôt really make fun of joe Biden‚Äôs fumbles. Let‚Äôs not forget the ‚Äúoranges‚Äù situation with trump or any of the other idiotic statements
Yes but I‚Äôll make sure it‚Äôs Biden !
Except decades of mail in voting has proven that it is a safe way to vote with minimal to no fraud.  What I said was true,what you said is a lie.  In person, mail in, it‚Äôs all the same. Just vote. For Biden.
Trump's inaction, incompetence and failed leadership has cost 150,000 American lives.  We need strong, effective leaders who listen to science.  We need Joe Biden.
So those who are responsible for the delivery of this election's ballots are endorsing a candidate... interesting.
Wow that's honesty that tells me why a vote for anyone other than Howie Hawkins is a waste of my vote.  Biden dummies seems about right.
God bless President Biden,yes I said President Biden ,the blue waves making this happen ,and God bless you all and the Vets ,because we love America And so do real vets and real blue American people oh there‚Äôs a lot of red caps that are with the blue now!
Honestly, I hope trump postpones the election, congress doesnt recognize it, Pelosi and trump both claim to be president, the new election date comes, Biden wins, dies in 100 days &amp; VP becomes prez. I'm over american politics but I could use a good soap opera
I do personally cringe a bit when I read those types of posts BUT THAT'S ON ME. For fuck's sake we know who we're following here so why are people trying to mold you into our vision. (See also "Biden's a rapist" posts.) MOVE ALONG, OTHER NORMIES WHO CAN'T HANDLE THE TRUTH.
So u r voting 4 Biden?
Only OBama and  BIDEN  did that ! OUR President was  worth  billions , he  doesn‚Äôt get PAID money , HE Works  for  Free!!!!
And Biden will have the receipts...
First of all, he can‚Äôt do it. Second, if he could Biden would really wipe the floor with him.

To Biden? I dunno, it‚Äôs close. Read Biden‚Äôs views on segregation and his crime bills, their both horrible people. Biden sniffs kids so he‚Äôs got the pedo angle. I would actually prefer Jo Jorgensen. She never raped anyone, and that‚Äôs big in my book...
Define like. If I had to choose between him or Biden? It‚Äôs close. I dunno. Compared to Biden maybe, but I like a steaming pile of shit over Biden so it‚Äôs not a high bar.
Yup. WH goes without saying. But if we don't flip the Senate it's going to be extremely difficult for Biden.
I know it's not going to happen but could you imagine a Biden Michelle Obama ticket oh my God it that would be so powerful. Trump would just walk out of the White House getting the station wagon and the kids and all the shitthy people and leave WOW !

Wasted potential is all over the world, but 4 years of Biden pushes us in a general direction that you generally agree with as opposed to 4 years of trump which I fear could legitimately end in a civil war.

It looks like he and Joe Biden are suffering from the same mental disorder. Bidens is just further along
not smart going after FNC, if they change to Biden you‚Äôll have every major news organization in the country against you. Saying you made FNC is one of the biggest crocks of excrement the world has ever heard...actually FNC made you...grow the f**k up.
The minute Biden announces his running mate and she is a woman the  will start spouting lies 24/7 no matter who she is or her background. All choices are strong it‚Äôs our job to spot and refute the lies and support our candidate.
Progressives dislike Harris because of her record as a prosecutor   Liberals dislike Harris because she's too ambitious for a black woman and doesnt regret calling out Biden on racist policy
I...um...yeah. Lol. (Yes, I‚Äôm going to vote for Biden.)
He‚Äôs wasting President Biden‚Äôs budget!  We are in the middle of a pandemic! There‚Äôs how many COVID-19 deaths? There‚Äôs how many unemployed? Some jobs are never coming back! Many Americans don‚Äôt have HC! HC workers stretched to limits! We are headed for a Trump Recession $377M?!

You mean Biden's not obsessively checking Twitter for the latest threads on why each of the candidates should be VP?
In the majority of discussions long before, back when we were still planning out the various candidates path to victory, we were giving it to Biden
On a positive note I took a 6.5 mile walk through my neighborhood and surrounding area I passed hundreds if not a thousand + houses from well to do area to low dollar rentals.   All I saw was Biden and Democratic signs. Not a single Trump sign.  This nightmare will be over soon.
You always choose Russia, who is not our friend, over our allies who historically have been our friends.  I hope they will be our friends again when Joe Biden becomes the 46th President of the United States.

If Biden did choose MLG, it would go a little something like this
Is she also not allowed to talk about race issues? Richard Spencer was comfortable enough to say that the Trump campaign is the first time that an identity politics for non ppl of color is on the rise, so maybe check your perverted, bigoted president.
Both of these so-called criticisms would be just fine if she was a man. Hopefully Biden won‚Äôt listen.
Yea, he help create this BS, and he promises he is the best choice for Americans? If you are planning to vote for Slime Bag Biden, I've got some prime ocean front property right here in Albuquerque, New Mexico, I'll give you a great deal on it.
Loyalty to America and opposition to fascism are the defining characteristics of Biden voters.
And yet she has to be ready at a moment‚Äôs notice to take on the mantle if ‚Äúanythingüò±‚Äù happens. This is just patently obvious racist misogyny.

Joe Biden Says Women Need His Help to Succeed in America
I‚Äôm not going to be ageist as some of the sharpest people I‚Äôve met in my work the last couple of years are up at Trump/Biden type of ages. He does have a family history of that though so I do hope they are staying on top of anything like that.
I am confused. This is happening in Trumps America, not Biden‚Äôs. Facts matter!
And Joe Biden took questions immediately after his speech yesterday in Delaware.  Literally minutes before Trump stormed out of his question/answer period.
He is telling you how to make sure Biden wins. It‚Äôs simple. Because don‚Äôt assume he will win otherwise, and ask yourself why the  is okay risking this.
Are you still sleeping with Willy Brown?  Joe Biden now?
I'm sure the Biden allies think a vice president shouldn't later run for president.

Good lord, this is a pathetic response. Most Bidenbros at least have a talent for being offensive dickheads. You, on the other hand, just make me shake my head and feel sad for you.  Joe Biden has a decades-long history of being a leading architect of systemic racism in the US.
You are totally correct that a black person could be anything. The discussion is of Biden's VP short list. A couple are prosecutes and very bad ones, like Kamala Harris, tht treats inmates as slave labor, Hides eviednce that would get people on death row free

MLG is clearly a very popular Governor right now and seems very likely to win reelection unless she winds up in a Biden cabinet before then.

Let's be honest here:  Biden is definitely the lesser of two evils.  He is far past his prime.  No one would vote for Biden over a more qualified candidate as he offers NOTHING to our political society except a rehash of past centric philosophies.

Of course you‚Äôd idolize serial groper &amp; woman abuser Asimov ‚Äî you‚Äôre a Biden supporter:
‚ÄúTrump and Republican Party leaders have decided to adopt the party's 2016 platform in full at their convention next month, rather than craft new language.‚Äù
‚Äúwe should never confuse unity with unanimity, nor should we confuse debate with division."
We will, on November 3rd when we elect Joe Biden as the 46th President of the United States.
‚ÄúIt also calls for a $15 minimum wage, mandatory paid family leave, more federal gun control, broad changes to federal sentencing guidelines and drug laws‚Äù
‚ÄúThe platform also sets aggressive goals for combating climate change, including making all American power plants carbon neutral by 2035 and adding 500million solar panels and 60,000wind turbines to the country's electricity grid within the next five years
‚ÄúRather than backing a single mandatory government-run health insurance program, however, it calls for adding a public option to the existing Affordable Care Act.‚Äù
‚ÄúThe draft party document released last week endorses universal health care and makes it clear that low- or no-cost coverage for every American is the party's eventual goal.‚Äù
I'm all for a woman's right to vote, because Im pretty sure she just said that she's ok with nobody advocating for that right. If you want to talk shit about Biden, then go ahead, but really? Y'all have to hate his plan to get more women to vote?

#Trump2020KAG Biden won't even let himself be interviewed or debate President Trump. He is not fit to be manager at Dairy Queen, let alone President of the United States. Besides, #DemocratsAreMarxistsDestroyingAmerica
The Biden pedos are all in:
The Next President of the United States paying Respects to REP.John Lewis like a real President would do BRAVO JOE AND JILL BIDEN
Specifically he stated in his testimony that Trump demanded an investigation of Biden im the Zelensky call  With the transcript released &amp; clearly no demand ever made, at best Vindman was simply wrong. But ever since bogus allegations that Flynn ‚Äúlied‚Äù the word does a lot of work

We said it in 2016: the difference between the candidates could not be more stark. But Sanders supporters said "oh, they are exactly the same." They were wrong then, they are wrong now.  If you say there is no difference between Biden and Trump you are purposely lying.
I'm voting for  because he knows that women and particularly women of color have never had their fair share. Joe Biden's agenda for women is a comprehensive and aggressive plan to ensure all women are afforded their economic and civil rights. #Biden2020
Same in 2016, Plus Hillary is twice the man Biden is and Trump still made her cry.
Do y‚Äôall actually believe Mitch McConnell will ratify Biden in case of a contested slate of electors?

I can't get medical marijuana (for my neuropathy) because this facility receives federal funding, hence ruled by federal prohibition. Biden campaign platform includes legalization at the fed level. Let's hope.
I hope President Biden has it removed once he's sworn in!
Biden is tough and serious about foreign policy and national defense. That is why China, Russia, and Iran all want Trump to win.   As does ISIS, NAMBLA, and MS13.
I feel like Biden‚Äôs only politically wise move now is to choose Senator Harris.
Today is demoralizing. These ‚Äúvetting process leak‚Äù articles are all smears against Harris and they make Biden look petty and small.
Especially because now they are allowing smears against Senator Harris to stand, and it makes Biden look petty and thin-skinned.   That's not the Joe Biden we know.

Like AOC and the Squad, Joe Biden supports cutting police funding and has said the police ‚Äúhave become the enemy.‚Äù #VoteRedToSaveAmerica2020 #Leadright
Joe Biden has embraced the policies of üëâBernie Sanders and the radical left-wing mob. üëâBiden supports $4 trillion in new tax hikes which would crush middle class jobs and devastate our energy industry. #VoteTrump2020
Within hours of Biden's inauguration, they will be screaming about the deficit.  Every Republican, at every level of governance, should be removed from office if they are up for election this fall.  Each one is a wolf in wolf's clothing.
Biden doesn‚Äôt know what day it is or where is at most of the time. Very concerning if he is elected POTUS! The Democrats couldn‚Äôt even come up with a candidate that doesn‚Äôt have dementia... or maybe this is by design. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüòí
DEM'S DISINGENUOUS SWITCHEROO, WORST SCENARIO: If Hillary is Biden's running mate, &amp; Democrat's devious plan all along was to have him step down if he wins, then their original wish from 2016 election will come to fruition. As of today, she doesn't meet the criteria for his VP.
I‚Äôm worried. These supposed leaks about the vetting process are demoralizing and divisive. It‚Äôs beginning to look like Biden may pass on the strongest running mate over bitterness about a primary debate and fear of being ‚Äòoutshone‚Äô. Bad.

This is becoming a problem. It‚Äôs a bad look for this campaign if it appears Biden passed on the strongest running mate because he‚Äôs bitter about a debate moment in the primaries and he‚Äôs afraid about being ‚Äòoutshined‚Äô.
First Lady Dr. Jill Biden will have to fix it I'm sure! I'm down to donate to the cause!
Legislation doesn't come from the president. If we win down ticket, he won't not sign it. Right now we need Biden because we can't lose any more court appointments or M4A will absolutely never happen.
And that should tell you everything you need to know about Biden.
Biden choosing anyone but  is 'tinkering around the edges.'

That‚Äôs exactly what I have seen. In the private sector no one would hire either Biden nor Trump. Two old and two crazies.
We are much more likely to guarantee healthcare under  than under Trump, even if Biden doesn't outright support it now. Also we will need the supreme court and down-ballot Dems. Biden would sign the legislation if it passed in congress, guaranteed.
Democratic Marxism is authentic Marxism‚Äîthe Marxism which emphasizes the necessity for revolutionary action. Loyalty to the movement, not loyalty to any particular doctrine, is characteristic of the orthodox democratic Marxist.  Hmmm Not sure this fits Biden, LOL
They can't let Biden debate Trump. Either their VP nominee will step in or they will find a body double.

Wait what? Biden is an Establishment Politician just like Hillary was. Granted he may not be as corrupt (which isn't saying much that's a low bar to be above you can be very corrupt and still less corrupt than Hillary)  I think voters that hated Hillary aren't thrilled about him.
Respect is not voting for Trump or Biden.
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN. #JoeBiden2020
No one outside of Biden's inner circle has any idea about the running mate, the conventions could go off badly for either side, and the debates are anyones guess.   These are all known unknowns.
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
Three million background checks for gun purchases are out there right now. If I were Biden or Trump I would be worried if I did win.
When Biden wins, he has to promise the American people they will be welcomed to bring a hammer and knock that wall around the white house and if he doesn‚Äôt join I‚Äôll call him sleepy Joe until the end of times. ‚úåüèΩ
Yeah because Biden never lies. Democrats never lie either.  ONLY TRUMP LIES.  LOL ok Don, whatever you say.  The worst part about a guy like you is your hapless manipulation strategies.
Truthfully I really don't care who he picks okay. I'm going to stand by him and do all I can to support him. No negative input or sideways and put on his choice No. I'm just going to keep my eye on the prize and that is electing Joe Biden president in 2020 he's been doing a
hell yeah mad at Joe Biden hell yeah for him to sit there and suppress the Latino vote in Florida and South Florida those are my brothers and my sisters man but you know what at the end of the day I woke for Joe Biden before I vote for Donald Trump
Wait, did Biden really name Gabbard as his running mate?
and that's their own fault so when the f****** when it's time to announce Joe Biden as an ex-president they can only blame their stupidity on themselves Novak last no other s*** because we're doing it right. Them Trump you're going to lose
You sure? David Duke has Trump as his header photo, not Biden. I'm no Biden supporter but ijs.
The whole of America and the entire fucking WORLD want JOE BIDEN TO WIN ü§®
Biden should pick a running mate that accelerates the contradictions and prevents any single negative frame from congealing.  I feel as though a woman with a background in prosecution and law enforcement might be ideal for this.
You're in competition is what's killing Americans. All you do is golf tweet and watch cable news we need a real president like Joe Biden
It's curious. Holmes would take note of the dog that didn't bark...  What say you   Giving Michelle the ol' Biden Basement treatment?  I'm ok with that.

Harris has stated that when (wishful thinking) they take their rightful place in the White House, they're coming for Trump supporters. Anyone that votes for Biden, and believes her BS, has got to be delusional, since no one will be spared from their destruction of America.

Elbaum provides some insightful analysis of our current political moment  - the interview centers around some recent articles Elbaum has written for  particularly:
He learned it and he wants it. I know it's completely backwards but they are using protest footage to scare people into thinking this is what america will be like "if Biden wins". Yet of course its trump's america, now.
So is Biden a radical leftist stoking riots in exclusively dem cities, or is he a secret conservative who will continue Trump's terrible agenda? I get confused.  More to your point, most of this does not sound moderate to me:
Not so fast.  I don't trust Trump.  I say we don't stop til Biden is sworn into office and Trump leaves.
You need to leave your house to see Biden supporters you are only seeing your yard!
Says the girl that claims to disavow Trump &amp; support Biden. Why doesn‚Äôt she just put her MAGA hat on &amp; STFU! She‚Äôs part of the problem!  Don‚Äôt tread on me, live free or die, apparently only applies to Republicans, because Trump is invading American cities &amp; shes cool w it.

Trump was compelled to test because of liberal idiots like you to prove he's fine.Joe Biden is a sick man it's so apparent. Trump will destroy him on stage but I don't believe DNC will let Biden debate. Hence continuing to keep us locked down like Joe. Wake up.
Goes hand-in-hand with them locking Michael Cohen up to keep him from writing a book because he wouldn't say that he wouldn't write it so Fascism at its best and there's only one way to take down a tyrant... Get him out anyway possible so has to be massive Biden landslide!
so if we really wanna be the better people I think the posts like this ought to stop. Nobody cares if Biden can throw a ball better than trump. I‚Äôm more concerned that Trump knew about Russian bounties on american troops and did nothing and that nobody has crucified him for it.
Trump is in league with very disturbed sick individuals  Vote Joe Biden for President
I hope so. I worry.  They love spinning everything to create a horse-race, that means amplifying Biden gaffes and fake scandals and pushing the 'Trump comeback, Trump grows into the presidency' narrative.

"Rigged" election, kinda like how Hillary AND biden had it rigged to remove bernie eh?
Joe Biden is the right choice. However difficult it would be for me to vote for a Republican for POTUS I would do if that was the better choice for the country.  It's the honorable thing to do. Thanks for being honorable.

TYT running Joe Biden ads on FB. Lmao
He was literally on the floor of the Senate yesterday trying to divert funds to help the communities in this country that have been devastated by COVID-19. Not to mention he is working hard to get people to unite behind Biden. Do your research before spouting toxic nonsense

FBI Investigated Biden Campaign for Delaware Way Corruption
BOMBSHELL: FBI Investigated Joe Biden's Campaign for Corruption
I think people feel that this is his form of fear mongering. He doesn‚Äôt want people to feel like Biden being elected is a sure thing. Like the polls said Hillary was a sure thing &amp; because people felt like there was no way Trump would win, it suppressed D voter turnout. Guessing.
Common sense is one big thing that the #GOPTraitors and #BenedictDonald have lost. We'll get it back again come November, so check back in after President Biden takes over...
Didn't your poor excuse of a President (Biden's BBF) have his mail forwarded to Golf Courses, since he spent more time golfing than a fish spends swimming in water.
Anyone buying thus crap that  is putting out about Biden having a lead over Trump in 3 battle ground states. I don't believe polls anymore.    Fox News Poll: Biden tops Trump in battlegrounds Michigan, Minnesota, Pennsylvania
Go Tony, your answer? (to the last #Biden Q)  #ReidOut
Everybody's pissed off at #michaelmoore, but he's actually making some sense right now on #TheReidOut. He's saying Biden should just start acting like he's president already, from the basement. He can be annoying, but remember, he didn't WANT DONALD to win. Or win AGAIN.

Within 24 hours of Biden's inauguration they will be screaming about the deficit.
Mueller was less aware of his questions than Biden. Dems knew he was waining terribly  And yet they used him
Wait, so Biden could carry every county in Florida?
Lmao too many damn leftist talking about voting for Biden and then ‚Äúholding him accountable‚Äù. How??? Oh like Occupy did with Obama? As if he didn‚Äôt beat and gas the shit out of those protesters and didn‚Äôt do shit to address their demands other than bullshit performative speeches.
If debates look questionable, maybe  can meet Biden at the Delaware gym.  They can separate the Biden &amp; Trump by using plastic cubes and have the panel separated with partions.
Is there any reason that Biden can just go if invited instead of Trump?
Donald you are the destructor.  Biden has my vote all the way. Watching you go down is going to be the greatest day of the American public
I'll either vote for the Green Party or the Libertarian one. Neither Trump nor Biden are impressive.

Biden teams up with Obama in 2020 campaign video
Biden‚Äîfar from my first choice but for whom I will be voting‚Äîat least regarding nuclear weapons has demonstrated interest, awareness, &amp; supported &amp; advanced positive policy agendas as VP.  Many of y‚Äôall might be surprised at how relatively unusual that is for POTUSs or VPs.
Yeah, polling has shown that this isn‚Äôt 2016 in the least. Way fewer undecideds, the ones that exist tend to favor Biden, and to top all of that off ‚Äî Dem complacency not really a factor this year (though I can‚Äôt quantify this fully).
Media is determined to help Trump close his deficit with Biden in any way they can.
Why are you gassing "suburban housewives?" You seem to be the problem. Joe Biden is the solution.
Biden must be listened to. He could become the first senile President. Joe 30330 has forgotten more than most people ever knew. With Joe Biden, every day is a new beginning. He just won‚Äôt remember yesterday!
If they don't do the same to the Biden campaign, they should be sued!
Trump holding true to form, blaming everything on Biden &amp; Obama.  Sadly, his followers will believe he had to do this to keep Biden &amp; Obama supporters in line.
We need to turnout and vote like Biden is so far underwater he can‚Äôt see the surface!
And she‚Äôs on the short list of Biden‚Äôs pick for running mates
In 2016, Clinton led Trump by 6 or more points in just four polls after June 1. This Quinnipiac poll makes it nine since June 1 for Biden. (using RCP's list of polls)
Seriously, though, this might be an outlier, but besides a Republican poll (Trafalgar group), Biden has been up 5-10 points since the start of June.
O come on Biden is wack  U all know it
What happens on Nov. 4th? Biden loses and Dems drop COVID and pivot to new attack on Trump. Biden wins and COVID news immediately becomes all good news so they claim economic recovery?
REMEMBER THE 150 THOUSAND AMERICANS YOU MURDERED WELL THE REST OF THE WORLD AND OUR COUNTRY DOES AND THAT IS PRECISELY WHY ALL OF YOUR REPUBLICAN PARTY IS NOT VOTING FOR YOU BUT FOR BIDEN YOUR PRISON CELL IS PRIMED AND WAITING FOR YOU AND YOUR FAMILY AND FRIENDS DEATH BECOMES U

Is Guest in the pay of the Biden campaign?  He keeps drawing attention to things that remind us that Biden is essentially a good human being who cares about the people around him and respects the people he grew up with.
Videos of what is actually happening under Trump to say what will happen under Biden. Does anyone have discernment anymore?
Maybe they mean that part of Biden's first term will be defined by how he managed to clean up the chaos created by Trump
At over 1,000 deaths per day, it is not ‚Äúworking out.‚Äù Time for change. #TrumpVirus #Biden #JoeBidenForPresident2020
It is disappointing. And, to try to stay positive, 4 of the candidates for his VP are Black. We are definitely at the bottom of the pendulum's swing as we recover from Trump. Biden has nver been the best candidate for progrsive moves forward, unless we ac'nt 4 how far we fallen.
Sleepy Joe Biden attracted 19 Viewers !
I agree fully, although I‚Äôd like to see some sort of proactive, preemptive moves against senate republicans and Rudy Giuliani‚Äôs efforts to manufacture fake Biden-Obama scandals. Taint the investigations now to blunt its ‚ÄòOctober Surprise‚Äô impact when it starts to hit.

Black lives in the womb won‚Äôt be safe in Joe Biden‚Äôs America. Just sayin.  #PutThatInYourPipe
When Biden is sworn in then the Orange Buffoons order is null an void. Making Biden the only legal President.
I don't know if this is a greater indictment of Biden's worldview or liberal patriotism but whatever it is it's pretty fuckin bad
Biden on Que !
Biden called like it is !!  A racist is a racist.  It‚Äôs hard to change that skin !
Agreed, but are liberals just defending a status quo for own comforts? Is Wheeler only defending his own authority (autonomy)? After trust is violated it's not readily granted again, for real reasons.  Compare to dynamics around Biden's Dem candidacy.   We're in a narrow pass.Thank you for your service Lt. Col. Vindman. You were treated so unfairly by Trump and members of his administration. When Vice President Biden wins the Presidency I hope that he will award you the ‚ÄúPresidential Medal of Freedom‚Äù
Biden‚Äôs turd is a better leader than the Dicktator üí©I thought this was a eulogy why is this a political rally. You had 8 years to fix shit and the only thing you did was enrich your family and the Biden‚Äôs. Shut up and go away. You are sounding more and more like Hillary.
Somebody tell Biden...I think he has forgotten...
Shouldn't you be planning your next act after Joe Biden is elected president?
Matel did it.  It's a Biden blow up.  :)
Does Joe Biden even know he has a Twitter? Asking for a friend...
It will be a character-making four years for all of us, not only for Biden. There will hard, often choice-less decisions to make. And there will be recalcitrance to be overcome.

If you betray your party, why wouldn't you betray your country. Republicans for biden are traitors to their party, and will be traitors to their country.
Has Joe Biden ( ever responded to any of Trump's derelict Tweets?  That would be a good idea now.
Oh, please. I am a Warren Democrat, and I will crawl over broken glass to vote for Joe Biden regardless of his VP pick. Don‚Äôt take one jerk and make it a thing.
‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to have a choice in the first week in August," Biden said. "I promise I‚Äôll let you know when I do."
Another difference between creepy joe biden and  is that creepy joe authored a crime bill that put thousands of blacks and Hispanics in prison for extremely minor crimes. To include single black mothers who were suffering economically in democratic lead cities.
COVID-19 was China's fault,  invited everyone to Chinatown when  put travel ban on China to prevent it spreading here. Service members LOVE him more than biden! Commuted a black lady who was overcharged, previously ignored by biden/obama!

Lastly, the ‚Äúhe‚Äôs wearing a mask to be politically correct‚Äù woman. There you have it folks. Can‚Äôt have a focus group w/o one QAnon conspiracist who doesn‚Äôt take the pandemic seriously.  BTW I‚Äôm voting Biden cuz I‚Äôm anti-Trump. Biden is a corporate stooge like HRC.
2/ And the ‚Äúeconomy was good before the pandemic‚Äù guy easily forgets the economy was all doing well before Trump under an Obama-Biden Admin.
1/ Some definite Trumpers in that group. Look at the context. They watch videos of Biden &amp; think he gets lost in speech. We‚Äôre expected to believe they have watched clips of Trump &amp; think he‚Äôs all there in his rhetoric ü§î

Looking more like he really likes her policies. She also helped with budget plan for Biden.
Trump campaign hits pause on TV ad spending for 'review' of messaging strategy  The move comes after the demotion of campaign manager Brad Parscale and polls showing the president trailing Biden. I guess they saw those ads weren't working for him very well
It is the same with Joe Biden.  He should be at home, but he thinks he must hold that spot for whoever the Dems intend to be their real candidate.
I'll just leave this here!
The VP doesn't control the purse strings and you know it. You and your cronies were in charge during that time because the GOP controlled both the House &amp; the Senate. So, sorry, this bogus BS is on your heads, not Biden's.

This country has no chance whatsoever if Joe Biden is elected. An old cheap retail political  hack who has had his fat hands in everyone's pockets for part of two centuries. If you want to know what it was like last century vote for Joe. He was among the worst in the worst of all
Absolute BS! Polls show 99% of Warren supporters will vote for Biden regardless of VP choice.
You mean Biden's not obsessively checking Twitter for the latest threads on why each of the candidates should be VP?
(2/2)... The turmoil (including the threat of national safety) left behind will be at the seat of president Biden and he will be mocked and attacked by Trump puppeteres left behind. Extreme Rightists will blame Biden for what Trump left behind and Civil War pt. 2 will commence.
I wish he would pick someone more in the middle.  I'm a GOP lifer.  I can't stand Trump and am seriously considering voting for Biden.  I just need a little hope that he won't be run over by the squad and their ilk.
Are you still sleeping with Willy Brown?  Joe Biden now?
Biden is owned by Russia and China.
So I genuinely want to know how Joe Biden is better? Joe Biden is racist, against gay marriage (so is Obama), is a pedophile, owns one of the Virgin Islands right next to Epstein‚Äôs, is a Liar, and can‚Äôt even make one speech with facts or knowledge...
I'm taking issue with on this Dan.  He might be sick but I really think he's acting the old feeble guy just as Muller did at the hearing so he's let off the hook for his actions.  we'll see if Biden does the crying jag like the "queen of mean " did  after her conviction.   üòÄ
You should check your facts. It wasn't the President that shut down the economy. IT was the Democrats. Speaking of morons, isn't it your party that is trying to make Biden the president?
He's declining first pitch invites that weren't made, but Biden is the one with dementia problems. Sure.
He is only an avatar for the real Democrat Candidate.  Real death and destruction come behind a Biden win.
I hope President Biden has it removed once he's sworn in!
