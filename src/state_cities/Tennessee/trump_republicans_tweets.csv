Trump set us on this path with his tariffs &amp; other stupid trade policies such as pulling out of the TPP, etc. But the addition of the COVID pandemic during an election year will be, I hope, only semi-disastrous. An excess of uncertainty &amp; sick workers is terrible for business.
Fuckin trump. Herman died a poisoned sycophant. He died showing us a great example of the sacrifice trumpism is. Kills the foolish. The myopic. The blind. The dead. The tragedy of denial. Let him serve as a glaring  example of the pitfalls that are inherent to trump and his ilk.
So, if Trump hadn’t sent his fake police cronies into Oregon, he wouldn’t have had anything to run on? 🤔🤔🤔
Wrong.  You are pulling a Trump and using a quote from Obama out of context.  I'll say again, your leader is telling you TO YOUR FACE the election is going to be rigged.  Do not trust it.  So....how can you trust it if he wins?
President Donald Trump and his Democratic challenger, Joe Biden, both promise sweeping progress over the next four years –- via starkly different paths.

I think Kamala needs to hold her Senate seat.  I’m leaning toward Susan Rice.  We will need a majority in both houses to clean up the tRump mess.
It’s evidence of how real fake news is that u even considered that to be real....or just such a personal disdain for Trump that you are borderline TDS
Regarding Trump decision to move US troops from Germany.
This is among the many reasons Trump is using his twitter to distract his base. His rallies are killing people.
Leadership pearl: Be consistent!! If you say masks and physical distancing are good and "patriotic" then you have to role model that behavior. Trump attended a fundraiser in Texas without a mask on the day the US hit 150,000 coronavirus deaths
Trump wants his followers to riot. He wants to use them as a political weapon for his agenda. If he loses in November and the margin is not wide enough, he will refuse to leave and say that the results were tampered with or hacked. This is terrifying people.
The dates of presidential elections — the Tuesday after the first Monday in November in every fourth year — are enshrined in federal law and would require an act of Congress to change.

Plz President Trump isn’t there a way to stop this.  We must not be cheated out of ur re-election.
Trump Dump
Looks like somebody at Kodak and/or in the Trump administration got word of this deal a little early. 🧐
No liberal watches CNN. Trump and his Alt-Reich choose to attack the centrist news channel in order to paint facts as biased. It's a textbook tactic for personality cults the world over.

Well, if Donald Trump turns out to just be cake (carrot cake, I'm guessing), then that means we can literally eat the rich, so it won't be all bad.

They are only trying to pull attention off of Trump with his current new issues.
The ones that are rooting for sports not to come back are doing it because at this point a lot of those people would rather spite Trump even if it has a negative effect on our country. I assume they think anything to get rid of Trump is the lesser evil than 4 more yrs. it’s sad

Write in  as Presidential nominee and then  could pick  as running mate. Unfortunately the news media selects who are candidates are—remember Trump? Sorry, Biden has had his shot. Anyone else for term limits for Congress and Senate?
and the notion that someone should have to leave the country if they don’t support fascist Trump is absurd and unamerican. It’s even anti Trump lol, cause yannow when other people wanna leave their “shitholes” the Trump administration turns them away.
only 61% of the US population voted in 2016 and of that 61% only 46% voted for Trump. That’s not half, definitely not over half. Guarantee more people vote this year and that number is going to be lower in 98 days.

Stop tRump by protesting away from Federal properties.  He’s using your pain for photo ops.

Trump has NO respect, therefore how could he even show any?
I agree with others on Twitter who think Trump &amp; Pence have received plasma injections.
If I were part of the Lewis family, I wouldn't want Trump anywhere near John's casket.
yea i don’t know how people say that about Trump, quality of life in the country has gone down and people say ‘well Trump helped my community’ but can’t really tell you how....
The Biden strategy is an interesting one. We all know that he’s running so there’s really no need to seriously campaign. He’s just laying in the weeds and letting Trump fail on his own. And it seems to be working.

Trump also stated the same about Charlottesville (where Heather was killed).
Me to I loved watching NFL NBA MLB alot of sports but due to the country hating millionaire sports athletes good luck filling those big empty stadiums.hey maybe you could have Trump rally that would fill it .but my money will not support your hate of America

Unfortunately the mayors and governors are sympathetic to the far-left movement.  If Trump took decisive actions he would be demonized by them, the Dems and the MSM.  Feds should protect Federal properties.  Let the mayors deal with the rest.  It falls on them.
Yeah, all this started because of Trump. Who has been in Politics for 4 years. You just made the stupidest comment on Twitter today.
It's because President Trump finally said we should wear masks, you know they are against whatever he is for, so that's why they are changing their minds now....🤫
Rather amazing this is still an issue. Masks for Covid-19 protection: Why the issue is still politicized in America - Vox
A truth perfectly stated. There's 1 question that I wish I could get even a yes or no answer on. "Is there anyone who will stop Trump from continuing the use of illegitimate, paid, armed men to infiltrate and terrorize local  leaders/citizens of cities who do not support him?"
And it has been three and a have years since you said you had evidence of Trump colluding with the Russians.  Now would be a great time to release it.
One thing that is racist is trump. There is no defense on that. Refusal to see it supports his racism. Supporting racism makes you a racist

Wonder if putin put trump up to it?
How does #Trump accomplish all he has under such treasonous and unAmerican US Gov officials ‘working’ for him.? Barr and Durham twiddling their thumbs same as Sessions, it seems!?  No indictments in a nation full of crime.
I read on twitter feeds from news sources in China and followed Dr. Li Wenliang story of virus and then he 😳 died from it.  Knew it was bad, but hoped USA had failsafes in place.  Were we every wrong!  tRump could have mitigated it and we wouldn’t have been in this mess!
The fact that Trump’s cronies were present made the entire situation worse because they were grabbing peaceful people walking down street.  Of course this made the others more angry.

Trump is a racist  Supporting him supports racism  Supporting racism makes you a racist.  Have a great day, racist.
Oh yeah, agree, but Trump was not so much a GOP candidate as "something different" under the GOP banner. Even some previous Obama voters, for only God knows why, voted for this mess.

Mr. Trump before you get elected again keep this one thing mind for Americans keep America going strong. Everyone wants to down trodding you no matter what you do. To me your the under dog that fights for all of us that means a lot from a country boy in Tn keep up the good work
Absolutely disgusting. Millions are going to Trumps secret police while he expects the unemployed to live off of 400 a month? Trump and the GOP have truly killed whatever apathy was left.
Barr and Trump have officially created their gestapo. The US is turning into an a authoritarian state and no one is stopping it.
This is a goddamn war crime and Congress is letting Trump get away with it.
For someone who’s supposedly fair to all, she’s turned it into petty race and now gender accusations. She needs to stop and thank Trump for helping her fight crime and violence in Chicago
Ty President Trump for ur common sense action to stop ppl from destroying our history. We all know that some of history wasn’t fair to all ppl but thankfully we’ve learned from our negative actions.

friendly reminder, this IS Donald Trump’s America. It’s scary.
The Turnberry in Scotland is on the Open rota! But they haven’t played it there since Trump bought it that’s seems a little biased if you ask me.
This stuff is a huge self own. Want to say it will be worse under Biden? Ok, that could float, but this is literally happening right now under Trump.
Yes and I believe that might have been when Trump told him to leave and banned him from ever coming back. The pictures are of all rich people at different events, those were probably before he banned him too...
You shared a video of America while Trump is currently in the White House and blamed a Democrat who isn't in office

We are not doing well against the "Trump Virus!"
It starts with patient zero. Wherever that was, it was that countries responsibility to report it when they knew it could be passed human to human, but Yes--after that Leaders let their people down--including Trump.
Now would be a great time to release the evidence you said you had on Trump colluding with the Russians.
So instead of being tired of it...look at your options...trump or biden. Biden wants eco friendly make 100 jobs to lose a million. No guns and no cops...criminals will keep theirs i promise.biden isa puppet. Trump is ego maniac no resp for women..but good business sense leader.
And the alternative? Biden? You cant boast about him so you resort to attacking trump...see thats what people do when they cant defend biden...when they cant come up with a legit discussion on why biden should be president.they revert back to elementary mentality divert attentionNOBODY:  LITERALLY NOBODY:  NOT A SINGLE SOUL:  NOT A SINGLE SOLITARY SOUL IN THIS ENTIRE WORLD, SENTIENT OR NOT:  NOT EVEN BUGS:  NOT EVEN ANIMALS:  NOT EVEN PLANTS:  NOT EVEN MICROORGANISMS:  NOT EVEN TRUMP:  NOT EVEN OBAMA:  NOT EVEN GEORGE W.

Bud, Trump has cowered down to just about everything China has brought to him. He’s in the hands of the Chinese and the Russians and you still claim he’s as American as apple pie.  Check your facts, check your beliefs, and try again.
And this was amongst the backdrop of Trump suggesting the election should be delayed.  Which power grab again was he talking about?
For me...like many others, was when it was all but certain that Trump was getting the nomination. As other elected officials acquiesced &amp; enabled Trump, it was all but certain to me that the party was done. I wanted no more. #UsedToBeGOP  #RVAT #CountryOverParty
Admittedly, I’m not the sharpest kid on this block, however, I’m amazed at how quickly people jump down my throat for expressing the slightest disapproval of Trump. I truly hope he is “winning” that 5-D chess game... ♟
Stopping COVID-19 was a national security issue, and the Trump administration failed.

Basically trump killed him!
You write that as if Trump is coherent...ever. He can lie well... can’t speak intelligently on anything.
The liberals has done much more damage to this country than Trump has
But Trump doesn’t get to decide the date Congress(which includes Dems and Repubs) does. And they decided on November 3rd, 2020.  This power is stated specifically in the Constituition.

When did Jo say Trump said he was going to personally delay the election? What's your point?
Obama &amp;Trump are very much the same person. Both are narcissists and thin skin ego maniacs, who like to throw bombs. 2 big diff. is that Obama is able to think before he speaks which Trump often has difficulty doing, and Trump can answer 100 questions in an hour. Obama just 3.
Apparently it’s fraud only when It’s not Trump and his family casting mail-in ballots.
to me, it's a shame about the adultery issue he had because otherwise he would have made a terrific presidential nominee over romney or a cabinet member to Trump,
Trump can’t delay the election, experts say - The Washington Post. Trump will get his way with Congress or claiming another Pandemic to keep folks home.
Just wait until Trump threatens his wife’s job, or finally uncovers something negative is found by his intelligence agencies that he can weaponize against Mitch. That will change his tune.
Of course they do. Whatever Trump says, they embrace.

He has NO plans he pladgerized them all from Trump like he has done his entire career! He cannot even so a press conference without a teleprompter! PATHETIC. What is even worse are people that would vote for someone that is being balatantly abused by the Democrats for power
Yes! Biden is the one with problems! Trump does NOT get questions beforehand and does not use a teleprompter to answer.

you all think all of America is so dumb we don’t see that over 145,000 deaths and counting happened on your watch  ? We all aren’t in the Fox News Trump fantasy bubble. #TrumpLiesPeopleDie
I’m so tired of living in TN the stuck on stupid state.   red state, Trump puppydog Governor; and you thought Fl and Ga were bad.
Democrats Start to Worry Support for Portland Riots Will Help Trump

Would love to see Kanye outperforming Trump in polls. That wouldn’t be embarrassing in the slightest.
For individuals like Congressman John R. Lewis and the capability to grasp what they have done and have to the United States Of America. John Lewis spent just life giving to others, where Donald Trump has spent his taking from others they are not the same men.
Listen just like when John McCain die and Donald Trump wasn’t invited. This is the same time no one wants  coming to pay fake respect to a true American Hero who actually shed blood for people he didn’t even know. Donald Trump like many others don’t have respect
Why would throwing out a pitch for 5 minutes take time away from working on the trump virus, as you said🙄than 4-6 hour game of golf 2 days in a row! 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣  the stupidity is amaaaazing    OMG
Shame on you   both for standing with trump &amp; Barr when they had the military attack peaceful Americans citizens for a photo op! A huge disgrace  to you all!
There are a lot of people who would consider fraudulent voting a small price to pay to get rid of Trump.
For a Republican Party devoid of reason,integrity, honesty, patriotism, If Republicans had insight they would realize and admit trump is corrupt,  a liar, racist, a conman, a criminal and a traitor-forgot Sociopath!
Yay trump, your Finaly happy
The entire trump family is to e dead and don’t give a hoot!  have no taste but gaudy
We used to believe Rs had integrity and believed in true conservative principles. Their shift to white nationalism and blind loyalty to Trump has proven they seek power &amp; self preservation over country. They are rotten and until they are gone, the Rs will be opportunistic shells.
Explain exactly how Trumps phone spreads virus?  Does he infect the phone and pass it around?  Your type can’t help themselves with the Trump hate.  You had some valid points it your hate comes out which totally devalues your points.  Get over your hate, you’ll be more effective.

Hey brother...simply put, u don’t have to vote for them. You do you.Yesterday was just one of those days (&amp; I’ve heard it countless times) where numerous ppl told me that all Dems were anti-Christian &amp; w/o Trump, Christianity was in trouble. Small sample size, but wild thinking.
He will never debate trump.
because Trump will have more difficulty trying to tamper with those votes &amp; won’t be able to claim fraud bc of mail in ballots (I.e. lets make sure the margin is HUGE so absentee don’t even matter)…3 #TrumpGestapo #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica #VoteBlueToEndThisNightmare #VoteOutTheGOP
Attention all #protesters against Trumpism, federal authorities, racism, etc - if you want Trump out of power (as I desperately do) please either (1) use only non-violent means as the great John Lewis taught…/1
to draw attention to the cause. It will expose Trump as the dictator he’s trying to be and more people, like me (50+ woman) would feel safer joining in the protests for what we see as a just cause. Also it would clarify where the real violence is coming from. #TrumpGestapo
Here’s the problem with Trump running a #LawAndOrder campaign: unlike Nixon, he’s the incumbent who incited the riots &amp; who can’t quell them. A President respected by the people could calm tensions. He stokes division; he wants #Riots.
And our current  run administration can’t bear to spend $600 wk for people to get more unemployment  that were made unemployed by this pandemic. If Trump snd  aren’t voted out we are screwed.
I hope we take greater respect for Constitution as well but I also hope we move to codify some of the norms Trump has broken (such as firing IG’s, appointing ‘acting’ officials to skip Senate- &amp; others we now realize hang by a thread.  #TrumpLessonsLearned
I assume it was my "Dump Trump but don't burn down the GOP" piece. I enjoyed your discussion about it with  on the Bulwark pod. Heck, you're with George Will, and that is formidable, formidable company.
Democratic cities that run by democrats that will not protect their citizens at the hands of lawless mobs. Can't wait for Trump to bring the hammer down.
Trump will win 2020.
Insane - Trump needs to come down hard on these Dem mayors &amp; governors that won't lift a finger to defend their citizens. They have basically ceded the city to a terrorist organization.

That's your story but the ones of us that can think for ourselves know the truth and will vote Trump in November.  No way we can give up to the liberals again.
As do I...it’s truly disheartening. It will be a slow process, but when Trump is defeated in Nov, hopefully we’ll be able to start ushering in truly #PrinciplesFirst conservatives

1) Endless spew of manufactured or hyper-edited stories = enemy. Press’ fault not Trump’s.  2) Fed forces to protect Fed property &amp; civilians whose Mayors won’t protect them vs violent criminals ≠ crush dissent   You are clearly unqualified to run CFR. Resign.

One hundred percent True.  and Trump show this everyday
Amen. The  raised the deficit to give top 1% huge tax cut and now they can’t stand that unemployed people who got that way due to pandemic Trump ignored get $600 wk. if these people had a living wage the $600 wk wouldn’t be increase. That shows how working poor are screwed.
No a President is the executive branch. The local government as in mayors governors and state legislators take care of their people. The fed is there to support and give the local gov what they request. How exactly is Trump responsible for the covid-19 deaths?
Trump hasn’t had the support of anyone including fully the republicans since he was election.  Ergo, by your logic, you are giving him a pass
Congress is not going to remove trump so we have to vote him out. Let’s make it the most humiliating defeat in American history.
If Democrats "don’t challenge the GOP’s exaggerated depiction of the China threat, they will be pushed rightward by the political tides,"  writes:
By all means, let’s talk about effective leadership
Trump didn't start the virus the Chinese did with some help from the democratic party it got blown into a full pandemic
Donald Trump is the best thing that ever happened to the American people
So...does that mean you’re saying that Trump is an establishment Republican/RINO, since he backed your opponent?
so you basically just gave Trump a free pass.
one of most dishonest sychophants lying to Americans ever time U open UR mouth! A disgrace to the uniform! Yes, we R in the middle of a pandemic for months  called a hoax &amp; still says will disappear🤣the bullshit never ends-Trump virus is  out of control
Sorry  a really bad liar!  knew about covid way before trump did anything and then lied &amp; said it was a hoax! He praised China Jan thru April🤣 Pure dereliction of duty by an incompetent president &amp; administration
So your proof of that is where? So you approve of Trump playing while country is in crisis?
Your right.... I’m speaking to the idea that “Trump caused all this” (narrative).  I believe Trumps the one who can turn this economy and such around. Absolutely need a vaccine STAT! For so many reasons. VOTETRUMP2020 😉
Drug out by the hair on her back
I have a joke about Donald J Trump, but it Sucks!!
I agree. Some folks will stay home and feel their vote doesn’t count. We need every single vote! But I’m concerned that there will be riots either way. VOTE Trump 2020!
Dont buy into the liberal narrative. Where were you a year ago? The pandemic is bad no doubt but it will pass. More lives will be lost and that’s horrible. We will get a vaccine and better treatment every day.  We can’t let the  last 6 months drive our votes. VOTE! Trump 2020!

His friend died. He tweeted a paragraph paying his respects. One sentence mentions that Regis urged him to run for potus and that’s what your stomping your foot in righteous indignation at? The person who made it all about Trump was you buddy.
Just your regular pro life racist Evangelical. She will be toting her Bible into the Right wing evangelicals church tomorrow declaring how Trump  is a gift from God.
God please please let it be. If Trump gets re elected I can’t live in my home state red brain dead TN anymore. I swear I will go to Canada or Europe if we can ever be unbanned from there
Yes only Racists and sociopaths and some right wing lol pro life translation pro fetus support Trump now. Many in red state TN sadly
It’s come to this. Agree with Steve. He acts like a car salesman. I’d vote for a baked potato before I’d vote for Trump and his con men
My only hope is that enough Trump supporters will buy one  and end up using it ironically.
And if Regis wasn’t a Trump supporter, he wouldn’t have said anything about him either!
I have a Trump joke, but it SUCKS.
Surprised   have sat silently as Putin placed bounties on the heads of our soldiers while Trump has known for months and has done and is doing NOTHING! How many soldiers have died and you both still pledge your fealty to a corrupt traitor🤮
I have been a devout  fan for 55 years😱but asking trump to throw out the first pitch at Yankee stadium-DONE............. Makes me sick!
Trump &amp; the Gastapo are out of control!👇
No more Trump jokes? Cold turkey? Just like that? That’s gonna be hard, but I’ll look forward to all the recipes and Dad jokes!
I will vote for Trump in November best thing to ever happen to us
Get your people to stop bombarding me with overly aggressive and desperate fundraising texts. I have blocked over 15 numbers. It’s a definite turn off, and I’m a Trump supporter!

So many gullible, ignorant people believe in this qanon conspiracy, anti-mask, anti-vaxxer video. It has caused actual harm already, but is part of Trump’s “dual message” strategy on Fauci and the virus. Trump is #TrumpLiesAboutCoronavirus
I do not trust Trump until he explains MAGA I cannot justify any of his actions towards the Black community.
thank you for taking a stand on eradicating Trump’s secret police patrolling our communities.
You are cut from the same cloth as your father.  So tired of the lies and the childish tweets.  The Trump family is the no class family.  What a disgrace to humanity.

I tweeted days ago that he was probably behind that mess. No one paid any attention to me. I've thought from the beginning there was something fishy about her getting her position. trump likes his cronies related.
Were you &amp; your accountants watching Trump economy? Historic until pandemic.  Look at NYC slaughterhouse - that’s COVID19 under Biden.  Have you seen Chicago violence? That’s criminal justice under Biden.  Have you seen Portland/Minneapolis? That’s every USA city under Biden.
Neither has Illuminati channel; Reptillian Shapeshiftrr channel; Ancient Aliens channel; Oxford/CDC model of 20M then 2M dead; the February “masks are bad” stories; nearly four years of Russia nonsense all a big nothing; Jade Helm fears; Trump kids in cages; chem trails; etc.
Joint Chiefs Chairman General Milley points out 20-30% of the related army troops are African American and their ancestors might well have been enslaved under the confederacy; the US military cares about their troops. Trump just wants to sew divisiveness (nothing new)

History didn’t end in 1860 sweetie. David Duke and other KKK leaders endorse Trump, run as Republicans today. They’ve issued several new editions to those history books over the years. How many Democrats you see getting elected in the old Confederate states?

Not any more-

Glad there's not many of you then. Trump will win big in November
No VP option is going to be perfect and without some sort of criticism. So I am supporting whomever he chooses. 💙💙💙
I love her and think she would be great. But NPR reminds us of her initial response to Benghazi was to say it was an act of spontaneous violence.
Agree. Trump is a timeshare salesman. Americans are buyers. We love a good crazy storyGrifters for Trump
Real trump follwer,no one matters but him
Does Trump realize all our troops that are not home do Mail in ballets? This man is not right!!! He’s just not!! I live in Memphis Tenn. in the SOUTH &amp; a Democrat! Alot of the South are REPUBLICANS I WAS until Barack Obama &amp; from then on DEMOCRATE. You have to win Mr. Joe Biden!
Man...I need an idiot interpreter to understand Trump and his actions.
Stop gaslighting. He recovered from cancer a decade ago. His own website said he was in good health. He went to a Trump rally mask-less during a Pandemic while being in a high risk group, because you and the MAGA crowd made common sense political. RIP
White Americans are defending USPS like it’s a damn trump rally lmao
And in the last year... 7,200 Pennsylvanians dead. 12.5% unemployment in Pittsburg alone because of a botched Pandemic response by Trump/Pence.
I’m convinced we haven’t grasped exactly who we’re dealing with re: the November election. During pres Trump’s 5:30 news conference, I was assured there’s going 2b chaos in November.
Trump lies and lies we need more fact checkers everytime he speaks
I don't know why everyone always talks about "Big Dick Energy" after 4 years of Trump. "Tiny Dick Energy" is FAR more brazen.  #TrumpPressConference
Friends have encouraged me to do an open mic but  I never did. Currently watching Trump bomb at his open mic, which happens to be a FUCKING PRESIDENTIAL PRESS CONFERENCE, makes me feel like I could have told a couple dick jokes in front of people who wouldn't have cared anyways.
Trump is a lunatic crazy insane president, ok press ask him do not sit there and listen to his crap
Seems some Republicans see the trump ship is sinking
TLT....Too late Trump, your damage has been done. Europe was able to get a hold on the Coronavirus, you called it a hoax. Bye!
And on the flip side like yes voting is such a huge gamble and in this current election, the options look real similar, but that is simply the reality and we have to work with what we have till we can get slightly more cause with trump we ain’t getting shit at all
Stupid trump and his stupid enablers
The American people are going to say you are fired trump
Good because trump is just an extension of putin
Trump will go live with Putin
Wasn't Trump touting the economy the other day...
Trump really put us in a depression greater than the great depression........   and there’s still people out here who wanna vote for him?!?! lmao 🤦🏽‍♀️
The only way Trump will view this is, did it hurt my reelection chances or not?  Period.
This happens every time. Trump will shortly say he wasn't joking and his cult will have to do a 180 to defend it.
I couldn't help but be reminded that Donald Trump is profoundly incapable of delivering this kind of eulogy.
Trump Trolling Level 1000
Vote Biden 2020 trump is fired
So President Obama is about to speak and Trump has called the press pool to gather. He is a petty mf. #TrumpFailsAmerica #petty #RacistInChief
If Trump really felt the overwhelming pressure that he would be indicted after his presidency on numerous federal charges, there is only one country in which he could flee.  And they are our #1 geopolitical enemy.  That should tell you a lot.
Trump wants to delay the election. That proves he didn't pay attention in 12th grade civics.  If he delays the election? The Speaker of the House becomes the interim President.   God he is so fucking stupid.
Yes vote Biden 2020 and get rid of traitor trump
Donald trump needs to resign  now
Trumps tries to distract us trump the traitor is an extension of putin
If he does that the Republican party is over ended because trump is an extension of Putin
People trump is trying to control our tweets and the news today he does this craziness to distract us keep your eyes open he is again trying to hind things
I wonder how long til Trump Covid Hoaxers start saying that Herman Cain was actually in the secret Muslim Brotherhood with Obama and that he really died of something else?
Trump must think we on Pushback Records. Hell naw that November 3rd date is solid. I'm throwing a release party!!!
I loved Mary Trump’s book. She even gave us the name of the man Trump paid to take his SAT test. #TrumpIsANationalDisgrace  #BenedictDonald
This is Real Leadership Mr. Trump. Take notes Sir.
I bet Trump feels terrible about Herman Cain’s death.   Just kidding. He feels nothing.
So Herman Cain caught COVID because he wanted to own the libs by going to a Trump rally.  He’s dead now.
Donald Trump suggests delay to 2020 US presidential election
Let’s all just be content that Trump decided to not attend Lewis’ funeral.  Narcissistic sociopaths need the spotlight on them. They sow confusion and chaos in all they touch. And Trump is a special kind of sociopath.  Let this be a special day for a true American hero.
Trump is chipping away at his massive debt to Putin. He does as he is told.

Didn’t you just talk about this
Stats show blacks are more commonly in lower income neighborhoods and it’s largely because white and wealthy society has made it difficult to get out. But Trump’s using the same language that’s always been used when people move to the suburbs b/c it’s a way to segregate legally.
Well it looks like Trump learned his lesson retweeting videos and... oh, never mind.
We’re days a way from Trump boasting that the bounties were his idea to keep our troops “frosty.”
This Mary Trump girl is disgusting what lies!!!
Let them all move into trump dump!!!
Why do you suppose the violence and etc..is happening continuously...the left and mindless demorats....easiest way to destroy the country and blame President Trump... Same for the crazy spending called stimulus...will give them more reason to raise our taxes...
We the people will drag him and the Trump Mafia out by their hair!!!
We wouldn't be in this predicament if Trump's father had used a Trojan.

TRUMP GIRRRRLLLL 2020
I would bet a large sum this guy did not vote for trump in 2016
Fascinating that a moribund photography company is now making generic drug chemicals when they have no expertise or manufacturing base to do so. Who’s monitoring these DPA “deals” Trump has announced? Are they real? What has been produced?
Another bad Trump investment 🥴
While I support freedom of speech, I don’t support wanton destruction. What’s happening in cities like Portland &amp; Seattle are contrary to the ideas of Dr. Martin Luther King. We don’t need Trump Troopers here in Memphis.
Of course. Trump is Putin’s best employee. He is delivering America to the Kremlin’s door.
So if Biden wins, Harris becomes our new President - just let that soak in for a moment - then either stay home or go vote for Trump.
just to 2015 in hopes of stopping trump from being elected

There are puppeteers pulling strings I am convinced of that and they may have bad motives or not. We may never know what those are. Is this all to smear Trump or is it Illuminati reptiles? Who knows (please don't take that serious).

Dear President Trump if Ronald Reagan was able to sign a law making pharmaceutical not liable for vaccines can you please sign it back into law? That would change everything!
Perhaps you should try to strike a similar professional and tempered tone toward the President and Republicans rather than your constant haranguing and whining about anything Trump.
DEAR PRESIDENT TRUMP WE THE WOKE PEOPLE WILL NOT BE TAKING ANY MANDATORY VACCINE REGARDLESS OF ANY VOTE! IT IS POISON, CELL CHANGING AND NO DOT TATTOO IS GOING IN MOST INTELLIGENT AMERICANS! PLEASE STOP THIS EVIL WICKED MADNESS IMMEDIATELY!
Trump is such trash the worse
Well get a more competent trump which is much more terrifying-like a Tom cotton
Let's vote trump out and save America
And what the hell are you doing from your bed room to help! Trump has done an incredible job with this Dem manufactured crises - an issue for sure, but never exceeded flu, etc.  DEMS just forced a panic on the world.
Nate, I gotta tell ya.  Stick with sports.  No one gives a sht about your opines on covid testing, masks, the criminal Trump, science, or really, anything else.  Who the eff are you to question any of these issues?  Perhaps you wanna talk to all of your 150 hourly listeners, huh?

Trump wants to prop up the fossil fuel industry while ignoring the present &amp; future of green energy &amp; green jobs. Investing in the small sector “clean ( no such thing) coal” for votes, instead of jobs trading for the future.
Trump is cozy with the world’s dictators. He covered for the Saudi killing of journalist Khashoggi in the interest of an arms deal &amp; his son in law’s real estate/loans.
Trump wants education dollars redirected away from public schools to private schools than can discriminate against children of color, LGBTQ &amp; the disabled.
Trump only stands for law &amp; order when it’s oppressing others. He routinely criticizes the  when it investigates him &amp; pardons &amp; commutes his felonious friends.
Trump gave tax cuts to the rich blowing out the deficit.
Trump Enacted tariffs that hurt farmers and other small businesses with spikes in steel &amp; aluminum pricing passed on to American consumers.

No, we need that money to go into the pockets of the Trump crime family.
If and when Trump loses this election, his biggest mistake will be having waged war on the media. Because it will launch a non-stop smear campaign on whatever you choose to say or do.

Trump is facing a wall of moms and a wall of veterans tonight. They all, like most of us, hate him.  Time for him to go back to his bunker and think about whether it’s all worth it.

Oh absolutely yes for Trump and Republicans down the ticket.
Democrats think by pandering for a very small part of a population that in total is 13% of the general population they will win over the black votes and keep Trump from being re-elected. As usual they are completely wrong and their totally incompetent mayors and governors prove
It's the only thing Trump understands.

Why are we not demanding answers about putin putting a bounty on American troops and trump not doing anything about it
We got trump we have no help here
I wonder if Clay Travis considers Trump a “Coronabro” for canceling the RNC convention in Jacksonville?
Dang. Way to bring it. Funny that the Nationals last few games had Trump in attendance. Wonder what he will think about that one?
tRump will not accept the nomination in Florida. Does he have to accept it at all?
Yup. But Trump wasn't put in the Whitehouse to make Dems happy. He was voted into there to make we, the people, happy and prosperous.
Trump is going to tweet about that pitch
Oh they all took a knee. Guess trump is turning baseball off.
Obama didn’t endorse  PUBLICLY until later because he didn’t want to sway anyone’s opinion!! There’s people that didn’t like Obama but would support Biden.    is smart. Unlike trump who doesn’t seem to understand political strategies.Yet he’s the president?

What has Donald Trump done to unify Americans  #TrumpVirus
Yes of course..he's part of the swamp...as is the judge that wants to set him free... President Trump needs to replace AG Barr...he smells swampy too...not doing what needs to be done.

You know how much I’ve done this. I don’t even have to talk details, integrity will always trump quick come ups!
If Trump was concerned about respect for our country; why didn't he join the fight with the rest of us during the Vietnam war. He took the the rich white boy deferment. He don't care what the military say on renaming army forts. He fought in no wars. Leave it to those who have !Bulshit! TRUMP was on Epstein island!
Did anyone straight up ask him this question?  If Trump loses the election, will he leave the White House on January 20, 2021?
I realize you’re an author; but,  also wrote books on Trump.   It’s Even Worse Than You Think was appropriately titled for a reason.  Nothing. I mean absolutely nothing shocks or surprises me anymore from the maniacal, sociopathic &amp; now autocrat “leader.”
How did he do that smart guy?
Ok y’all, for real: Trump will never be able to top Obama’s sermon today obvi. But WHO’s famous funeral would Trump preach at?   My bets are on Kid Rock. Your guesses?
how about the killing of US troops by Russian bounties with Trump knowing is that f****** funny?  Trump is the human garbage that America must take out if we want to survive!  170 million dollars campaign finance violation money laundering by his campaign!  Sdny! TAXES SDNY!
Amen. Trump is trying to stop the voting. He knows he will lose

Straight up election interference by Trump.  He PINNED his ridiculous tweet!
The Chinese have done more to prop up the USPS than Trump by sending seeds to America. How many maskless idiots do you think planted them in spite of health and safety warnings?
Trump is in the tweet- can I just have one outlet without this dude’s name?
Trump will most likely use the USPS to delay ballots so they cannot be counted- it depends on your state there are rules for return ballot delivery. TN allows carriers other than USPS so I plan to use UPS overnight!   #Trumps a dumbass  we can outsmart this idiot! #TrumpIsLosing
“Blind devotion”, that’s what you are going with? Opinions....just check the Ukraine governments website. I know you people think anyone supporting Trump is all this crazy 💩, most of us seek the truth and we have been lied to by the Democrats for way too long.
He realizes that’s why trump wasn’t invited right?
He turned John Lewis’ funeral into a campaign speech and made it all about the election. The guy has absolutely no shame. And people call Trump narcissistic.🤦🏻‍♀️
Well, we all knew the Trump years would not be boring.

Say no to Trump and Pence, vote
First, I think Trump was stirring the pot. I wouldn't have said it, though, given the media culture. Now, is this guy a friend of yours? I've heard of several down there who are good &amp; bad, but never heard of this guy before.
At this point, they’d just get angry and cancel CNN for supporting Trump.
I bet he voted Trump/Pence
This guy already said he wasn’t voting for Trump before the tweet. Yes he did oppose the impeachment earlier this year as there was no basis for it.
They murdered people to make Trump look bad. Change my mind...
Trump's 32.9% drop in GDP is the worst in American History.  Jared told us they "won", and Ivanka tells the unemployed to just do something else.  Worst GDP in history.  It's not because of the virus, it's because of his inability to deal with the virus.  #worstGDPinhistory

Any... Other reports or studies outside of the ’Trump War Room’?
I don't think Trump is setting this to keep control. I think he hates being POTUS. I think it's setting the stage to save face when he loses.
Tattoo it on Trump and roll his wackaloon arse over to my house?
I know. As it becomes increasingly clear Trump will lose and becomes more ridiculous, GOPers up for re-election should consider at least pretending they care about being Americans. But, maybe not....sad.
This coming from a woman who has been around the block one too many times and involved with the corrrupt trump family🙄
Wow. Just ... wow.
what bothers me, even more, is Congress is not doing a damn thing about it. Trump just does what he wants. His goon overseeing the USPS is blatantly violating federal law.
Problem running against a really unpopular guy like Trump is that Dems don't wanna risk *anything* and let him sink himself. But there's so much to take a stand on. Biden needs to start trying to build movement *now*, not after Trump gets a whole campaign tossing shit in the air

No. I have had two tests related to Trump/WH events. Everyone in the photo tested negative hours before the event.

Maybe not, but if trump isn’t re-elected, we might be surprised. Some might try and save face Why is so important to more than win it.

Gotta love Trump, he showed everyone who WHO is.  i knew there was an incredible amount of liberals in the republican party, which is why i stopped voting for them after the mistake of '88, its sure nice to have a real conservative back at the helm. its like having Reagan back.
We need to work hard for the senate. They could not only block any judges, but act on a house impeachment and remove trump before inarguration.
I’m sorry, did Trump do something of importance today? No? Back to honoring Mr. Lewis.
No, that’s not clear from his tweet. He shouldn’t have said anything about delaying and he shouldn’t be discrediting vote by mail. I’m w you when you point out trump derangement reactions from msm...but this wasn’t one of them.

Trump on delaying 2020 election: “I don't want to have to wait for 3 months and then find out the ballots are all missing and the election doesn't mean anything. That is what is going to happen."  It will be the “most rigged election in history” if mail-in voting is allowed.

Since trump loves Russia so much and wants to establish trumpistan, after he loses In November, let’s give him, his entire crime family and his willing accomplices a good old fashioned purge..expunge his name from history and relegate him to where he belongs. In the rubbish bin.

I think the Trump News Network was Plan A in 2016 and there was no Plan B. Winning made him more vulnerable, in the long term, than he's ever been. Perhaps he'll resign after he loses so Pence can pardon him b/w November and January. Maybe they've already worked it out.
How am I lost? When was the last time you heard Trump talk about any normal policies that actually improve the quality of your life? Education, infrastructure, healthcare? What kind of leader doesn't hold themselves accountable and spends all day pointing fingers?
Because Trump. Thank him for that, Ted.
People are lambasting him because he didn’t do this earlier. But I’m not ready to look a gift horse in the mouth if it means helping to get rid of trump.
Words &amp; actions have meaning. If you think the words &amp; actions of Obama are the same as Trump, you’re deaf, dumb and blind. Reluctantly sending Nat Guard Troops isn’t the same as creating a secret police force. Are they both bad? Yes, but they’re orders of magnitude apart.

The co-founder of the Federalist Society - the organization that backed Kavanaugh for Supreme Court - has called for Trump's removal as President if he doesn't immediately relent on his call to delay the election.
Casting a ballot by mail is quickly becoming the norm and quickly becoming politically charged as some Republicans — specifically President Trump — fight against the mail-voting expansion happening nationwide.

It's amazing that what finally seems to be getting prominent Republicans to question Trump is his threat to move the election.  Don't get me wrong, that's an insane, dictator-like move. But he has done something impeachable, despicable, &amp; tyrannical literally every day in office.

Donald Trump is a great President and has improved America. (Biggest lie of all).
Trump is falling apart on live tv... he then calls on OAN... he has a practiced answer... if he mispronounces Oregon again I will scream!!!
Also, a reporter at the same rally wore a mask and still contracted COVID-19.
Alt-Left trolls and Soros bots are trending the hashtag #MyPresident. Report ALL liberal propaganda!  In reality, their president is Donald Trump, the GREATEST PRESIDENT OF ALL TIME!
Ha! So Trump is responsible for people dying? He's been pushing hydroxy, which we're now learning was the answer early on, but the libs and lib media tried to destroy it. Imagine how many people died because libs lied and said it was dangerous.
You are right about that Jeff!   I’m ashamed of being a republican my whole life.  Trump is the worst president of our lifetime. Cuomo 2024!!
Now Trump is quoting the Washington Post? Said that they are fake news but not about this. Since it was about mail in ballots. But absentee ballots are MAILED!!!! #TrumpTurds #Vote
So oppressed,so brave by working hard and being able to go to medical school and becoming a doctor and using the first amendment on social media. At least politics can’t interfere with you actually saving a life, it’d be great to see you help save a trump supporter or billionaire
Trump accuses everyone who doesn't do what he wants to be politically motivated because he can only think in terms of "his side" or the "enemy"

And let’s stop being so dramatic, Trump isn’t cancelling the election, instituting martial law, etc
Trump will enact martial law and postpone the election.
The problem isn’t trump. The problem is with a system that produces so few viable options. 80yr old man, trump, Hillary...

Looks like Trump's tactic today is to show how other countries COVID19 numbers are on the rise, as if that is a justification for ours. Doesn't he realize that his followers don't "care" what happens elsewhere because they believe his MAGA rhetoric. #TrumpTurds #VOTE
Can you think of a time you were sent a dead person’s ballot? Any of your friends or family?  I have never received a ballot randomly in the mail. Don’t know many that have.  This wasn’t a problem until trump wanted to make it one.

I mean if common knowledge Trump campaign was totally illegal and corruption by GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS the FBI and CIA..are you in belief or disbelieve this statement?
hahaha. No I tried and it’s not funny. Just like every other time Trump said something absurd &amp; the GOP said it was a joke I never saw anyone actually laugh about it.
I wasn't a fan of Hillary either; but, Trump is probably the worst person on the planet to be leading this country in the situation we are currently in.
Well, at least Joe understands his limitations. When will Trump accept the fact that he can’t do it either?

Trump voters! Remember he has delayed the election so don’t go on November 3rd!
Politics is the art of the possible. Obama used that knowledge to try to advance the country, Trump is using that knowledge to exploit every resource and every loophole his advisors and enablers can find.
So because Trump felt slighted by Pelosi, that justifies him calling it a hoax? I'm not tracking.
She is telling the truth.
Imagine waking up on 11/4 and Trump has won again and the GOP maintains the senate. Don’t let this nightmare be a reality, swing states! We’re counting on you.

Furthermore, Trump continues to force soldiers into cities and continues to slam the media for fake reporting. Even Fox News, which has become his biggest support base since 2016.
This morning, Trump threatened to delay the election, which he has no authority to do. No president in the history of the United States has ever threatened such a thing.
Trump is loopholing the system.I urge everyone who is 18+ to get out and vote this year, because quite frankly, the US could cease to exhibit democratic values if Trump is elected for another 4 years. This kind of act of power is not normal.
Saw some of your work while in line to vote today. Thank you for being a powerful force in ridding us of Trump.
Come on man, he called it a hoax for two weeks on national TV. Trump has never been held accountable for anything in his life. I wasn't even into politics until I saw how shitty of a person he was. Why do you love him so much? Is there anything you don't like about Trump?
Hope you get your little pat on your head by your Russian boss, Trump.
Bill Clinton shared the Stage with Louis Farakan I guess that makes him a Anti-Semite, Joe Biden praised Robert Byrd when he died! That makes him a racist because Byrd was once Grand Wizard of the KKK? All are true if guilty by association! Trump kicked Epstein out of his Resort!
Exactly!!
They thought what they did to Trump was okay also.
As an American, I am totally embarrassed that our president refused to pay his respects to Rep. John Lewis. But it’s probably for the best that Trump didn’t attend the funeral because he’d make it all about himself

This is FEC commissioner Ellen Weintraub. Today, she told  Trump to sit down and follow the Constitution he swore to uphold. Very satisfying. Didn't even let that crap get a root down. An election CAN be delayed - but  does NOT have the power to do it.
We had a hunch the left was rooting for death for Trump supporters. Here's proof. Democrats have become the party of lucifer.
There's a reason Trump/GOP has actively spread COVID among the MAGA base of Evangelicals and Red State voters. Trump just held a rally at a dadgum church in AZ! Spread the virus to his faithful to drum up support for postponing the election at the state level.
Sorry, but you have to compare apples to apples. They said that it treats Malaria and a few other things, but not cleared for Covid-19 yet. But trump invested in it prematurely and is now trying to peddle it off the back of his truck like Mr. Haney.
Only death would prevent me from helping vote out Donald J Trump

I don’t think that’s what he meant.  Trump is not the one who has to cheat to win.
Yes, he’s doing this on purpose. It was his platform when he ran for office - how can I ruin Nashville. He actually released the COVID in the city so that he can fulfill his dream of ruining Nashville. Just like Trump planned it to ruin the USA. Are you just stupid? Or what?
It's because Trump calls a spade a spade. He doesn't sugar-coat to be politically correct.
Tax evasion, treason, locking kids in cages and violating international law in the process, negligence that has lead to 150k deaths, violating the emuluments clause, fraud at Trump University, obstruction of Justice. Options are endless.

Not sure about that. Reading twitter, it appears people don't know the rules. I have no reason to doubt what McConnell said this morning. Similarly, McConnell has refused Trump's multiple pushes to remove the legislative filibuster.
Trump would definitely risk that. lol   What Trump do you know? I think we're experiencing different Trumps.
He won’t and even if he does it won’t matter. The establishment R Party is complicit and the architect of the Trump strategy to undermine democracy. They can’t win elections anymore so they have decided to embrace authoritarianism instead. Welcome to the new era of Fascism.

The truth is in front of you.  Covid is all political.  Trump is right. Never give GOP a dime.  Frauds.
That’s my point. With the electoral college, if you live in an overwhelmingly Red or Blue state, a presidential vote means little. I mean, Trump will win TN by a billion. If I vote ASP or Constitution, it’s noticable.
🗣 and if it didnt go to trump, it went to organizations here and overseas that actively murder and harm LGBT people 🗣
From the Article: Right now, that would mean 13 of the Trump task force’s 21 red-zone states returning to lockdown: Florida (with a staggering 48.1 new daily cases per 100,000 people)...Tennessee (34.1)...

Smh. You can't delay the election,you orange pos. Moreover, your denigration of mail-in voting hurts Republicans as much as Democrats. Your assault on the USPS hurts the Republicans as much as Democrats. YOU ARE SO F'ING STUPID! How does Vlad put up w/you?
Donald Trump is a damn fraud. 96 days until the election. Let’s do this.
“Any more? “🤣 trump cultists are seriously bad actors.
You will really get this November.  I can't wait to see how the bunch of cry babies act when Trump win again.
John Roberts, shouldn't regret anything because he the pain in TRUMP's side.
President Obama, President Bush, and President Clinton all attended John Lewis’ funeral. Donald Trump was busy tweeting and playing with himself #JohnLewisRIP oh and Herman Cain died being a good soldier #RIPHermanCain
Trump is totally out of contact with reality. ONLY Congress can delay the election. Do these supposedly college educated even know about ANYTHING about Civics? Did they fail this class?
Let that fool do it, he doesn't mind killing himself for demon #TRUMP.
poor man. So scared so hurt. Crushed by Trump deranged syndrome
This is a silly, non-sequitir response to a very direct statement. Trump thinks passing a dementia test is impressive. He thinks he’s a genius because he can remember five words. No attack on Biden is gonna stick under these circumstances.
TRUMP 👊.  I WISH SOMEONE LOVED ME THE WAY DEMOCRATS LOVE COMMUNISM
Wait 20 minutes, kneel before trump, and I am sure you will change your mind.
Nope. It was Covid from the Trump rally according to CNN and they are the most trusted name in news.
Ma’am, Trump spent the last week bragging about passing a “very tough” dementia test. He thinks being able to remember five words is impressive.
Looks like #Parler or #Parlor (whatever it is) didn’t want the crazy right wing on their site.  Didn’t realize they hate Mika almost as much as they hate Hillary.  All of these loving “non racist” Trump supporters, except they hate anything, everything to help the black plight.🙄
Trump: Hold my mask
President Trump knows (or he should know) that he has no control over an election date. He is pandering to his crowd just like the ones on the left when they tweet about what might happen if Trump delays the election. It isn’t happening. Nor should it.

TRUMP, I support not going to the funeral. Best place to instigate his perspective and still get drilled for something he stated.
Biden went to the service on Capitol Hill. Trump did not.
Wouldn't it be amazing if those who object to Trump's vile and racist acts would simply refuse to be complicit in carrying them out?

haha i wasn’t sure either

Now you see why Donald Trump wants the country to stay sick. Bet he tries to shut down voting...please retweet..

Trump suggests delaying 2020 election
That's bullshit. Neither Pompeo, Barr nor Trump have that power. Trump's term ends January 2021. And guess who's POTUS if there's no election?
Another vote that Trump lost.
If that was the genuine reason this was tweeted then fair.  I don’t believe it was, could have left out the Trump commentary.
I have to hand it to Trump. Where previous GOP presidents tried to play nice with Democrats (and got savagely attacked by them), he has caused them to reveal just how radically Left they truly are.
Truth:  The slow response by  to the covid-19 pandemic contributed greatly to the economic downturn we are experiencing.  Don't let Trump's misdirection obscure the facts.
Anything you can do to get China to pay these bonds they owe to my wife’s family and all other bond holders would be greatly appreciated. If litigation is the only way, we will proceed when that Avenue is possible.
I think you've got to assume he'll talk to some of us every day.  But Trump is trying to distract. Stay tuned in. Also, listen to local elected officials.
Obama: basically gives a sermon at John Lewis’ funeral littered with scripture (used in context).   Trump: “Two Corinthians”
Lots of Mika haters, yet they follow her just to be trolls.  1 thing to learn from today’s episode of “Trump Cult Have Trouble Understanding What Words Mean” - today’s Word of the Day is “Racist.”  They can’t be racist, bigoted, xenophobic while trying to assign the same word.
The trump dump today is about power he thinks he has. Mr. Obama reminds us the real power is real courage &amp; justice.
I mailed a card from Nash to Louisville 6/15 and it arrived 7/21. It was a birthday card for a child. Real pleased about that.
Let’s be clear.  The country who continues to pay and support your family members, CHINA, caused this escalation.   Trump is working hard on the recovery.   Trumps economy...BEST EVER!    Time for the v shaped curve.
i've noticed too that the presidency hasn't aged trump because like he literally doesn't care. meanwhile, we turned obama into a grandpa before his time.

Trump could have saved the economy if he would have asked everyone in the country to wear a mask as a sign of patriotism back in March.
What? But you're not in the libertarian ginger army!!
Crazy talk from the White House while Americans are out of a job and losing loved ones due to #COVID19. Disgusting.
Trump has NO power to delay the election. Only Congress can do so – as expressly stated in the Constitution – and there is no chance that Congress will delay the election.
So, you're scared of gingers?

SCHUMER: "President Trump, the election will be in November, on November 3rd, and you will not change it. Stop diverting attention President Trump."
According to dipshit Republican senators like   Trump is always joking until he's not. I really wish he'd stop governing based on his goofs.
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH. Biden was right on the money months ahead of time. Go ahead, delay the election and we'll inaugurate Pelosi when Trump's term is up.
No my disdain for Trump stems from his actions &amp; the things he’s said. This isn’t media. This is the problem with social media platforms &amp; how hard it is to keep people from sharing false things like this. I’d expect Twitter to flag this with a note about it being inaccurate
To be fair Biden was completely correct and knew exactly what he was talking about. Eh, though, if there is no election President Pelosi will be inaugurated when Trump's term ends.

DELAY THE ELECTION? President Trump has floated the idea of delaying the November election, a power granted to Congress. MTSU Political Science Professor Dr. Michael Federici discusses this with Reporter Harriet Wallace:
The right claiming "silent majority" is silly to me, considering Trump didn't win the majority in 2016. I believe in the electoral college, but I'm saying there are more Americans against him than for him and all it takes is a couple states to flip and it's all over for MAGA.
Donald Trump needs to resign. Pass it on.

Just another trump lie.

I hope Trump supporters will see #HermanCain’s death, reconsider their opposition to masks and science, and take the pandemic seriously. If that happens then something positive can come from this tragedy /end
I’m not going to dump on #HermanCain. No doubt he (and Trump) are responsible for the decision to go unmasked at his age and with his health background. I didn't like his politics but I am saddened by his death...particularly when it was 100% preventable. /1

Republicans you guys don’t have no one to BLAME but yourself for not holding tRump accountable,y’all could’ve put him out of office but you didn’t,that’s on you. so the VOTERS will decide in November.
Trump recently said Democrats will open the country right after the election b/c it’s all about politics.   Mail-in ballots have been proven to be a disaster and Democrats have been caught cheating.  They can open the country (they won’t) or own every ballot problem in November.
I truly feel Trump will lose and I’m so scared. I’ll be damned if Biden wins.
Someone doesn’t understand how covid takes advantage.  Then again, Trump had to backpedal (due to low polling numbers) and pivot how masks are good now.  Yeah. It’s a lot of catching up to do, especially the reading part. 😆
Fake.
CCP is party to blame but the real blame belongs to Trump. He has undermined the science at ever turn.
Good call. It’s fake.  probably speaks to more the fact that Trump says some stupid shit than it does me for believing that.

Hoping they just keep dragging it out and by the time he is actually sentenced, trump will be out of office!
They adhere to different laws and guidelines. Online platforms accomplished this by insisting they’re a 3rd party platform which - by their governing law- prohibits them from censoring posts that are not “lewd/lascivious.” Its a very easy thing to look up. Trump’s exec order...
Valid but I bet Trump is equally glad though he got the waiver signed.
Make no mistake, people who say things like ‘both options are equally bad’ or ‘two sides of the same coin’ are 100% voting for Trump.

Trump's defense/defenders will say: 1) He didn't say he was going to delay election, was suggesting an idea for safety; 2) He's focused on election health &amp; safety; 3) Dems want to ram through mail-in ballot initiatives with few checks, which endangers electoral sanctity

Tell your conservative leaders to get on it. If he doesn’t, that’s more about how your leaders felt about him than what your question seems to be implying. He was important in business no doubt. It is applaudable &amp; commendable. Beyond that, holla at ya boy Trump.
I'd have a better chance of getting ice water in hell than of Trump resigning.
Supposedly Regis left the trump campaign 20 mil.  trump may prefer they go ahead and die so they can’t change their mind.

Trump earned this!
Nah man. Donald Trump was his killer—he just was an accomplice in his own murder.
Literally no one thinks that Donald Trump can hold back the election anyway. This is all a troll to the left because the Supreme Court is going to hold that mass mail in voting is not required to have safe elections.
By the way the #trump gathering yesterday in Texas was appalling..more #republicans will catch #Covid by attending that rally besides continuing the exponential surge in Texas..us democrats are staying at home shaking our heads..
Too late for Herman Cain and tens of thousands of Americans who’ve died due to Trump’s incompetence and GOP bootlicking. The amount of arrogance, ignorance, selfishness, and lies coming from people like you is depressing, but America will survive the likes of you.

Conservative National Review writer shreds Trump’s ‘weak, self-defeating call for delaying the election’ -
It seems obvious to me. They are all involved. Putin and Trump have private conversations so the GOP probably do too. We have troops pull out of Germany, push on hydro, misinformation push underway again, &amp; gestapo troops in Detroit and other cities. Honey, we are Russian now.
4) #Trump made this statement while pushing for children to go back to school ...
3) #Trump is not constitutionally empowered to delay the election ...
1) #Trump: "With Universal #MailInVoting (not Absentee Voting, which is good), 2020 will be the most INACCURATE &amp; FRAUDULENT Election in history. It will be a great embarrassment to the USA. Delay the Election until people can properly, securely and safely vote???"
Left is Best.  #sameteam  Do you think the progressive caucus will be more effective with a Trump white house or a Biden white house??
The anarchists and Leftists have the same philosophy about tearing it all down to build back. Either way, Trump is POTUS and this is on his watch. The responsibility falls on him to protect and build the US; meanwhile, he's busy whining in tweets.
yep lmao and hershel is a huge trump supporter too
And for the 3rd day in a row he's saying the quiet parts out loud.  Truth, mail in voting and absentee voting are the same thing... Trump and many of his WH officials used mail in voting without excuse in the last 2 elections.
If this was true we would not have trump.
Just give it up Mr Trump. The power is not worth it. This is our Democracy. Let Mr. Biden take over it will be OK!
What I saw yesterday in Texas at #trumps campaign event was appalling..two weeks from now people WILL be sick from attending that cult meeting..#trump is KILLING the voters he needs in November..stupidest political strategy ever from America’s stupidest President
It’s sad that Herman Cane died, or when anyone dies of COVID, no matter their poitics or personal character. But he went to Trump’s Tulsa rally with no mask and sat in a close crowd, which is behavior that when you’re 74 is like playing Russian roulette. WEAR A MASK. STAY HOME.
The ONLY THING that FAT DONALD TRUMP has said in 4 years that has been true is - " If you vote for Hillary Clinton there will be endless investigations and scandals " well,,we DID VOTE for Clinton by 3 million votes. 😂😂 Fat Donald Trump 😂

Sad. Did they give him Hydroxyq? Zinc? Zithromiacin? Trump says that it works every time. This proves it doesn’t.
So, I am wondering if sending #AGBarr’s thugs into #portland &amp; other cities is a dress rehearsal for the total rebellion that will occur when trump tries to delay or eliminate #Election2020. If we vote, he loses  If he’s really concerned about safety, why demand opening schools?
Herman Cain died COVID likely from attending the Trump Oklahoma Rally... The time lines up with not wearing a mask, large gatherings, and his contraction/hospitalization.
Can it be overturned? Can we regain our position in the world? Not if trump is re elected and the senate remains Republican. We absolutely have to vote trump out and regain the senate.
Keep thinking about that video in which Trump's campaign ordered Tulsa event staff to remove signs keeping seats open for social distancing. Trump didn't want the room to look empty.  He then complained that the rally flopped b/c his supporters feared COVID, and blamed the media.
a distraction from the economic report today, a distraction from Herman Cain dying because he got Covid at Trump's Tulsa rally, a distraction from Obama giving Lewis' eulogy later today.   he is a ghoul.
To say Trump turned our shithole country into a banana republic is insulting to bananas.
All these purest progressives in Blue/Red states projecting their moral superiority by not voting for Biden in a non competitive state.  Voter Privilege.    We're more likely to succeed in a Biden lead govt than a Trump govt.  This isnt rocket Science guys. #SameTeam #Biden2020

2) Prior to his hospitalization 6 weeks ago, #HermanCain appeared at Donald #Trump’s Tulsa rally without a #mask, and had expressed his frustration about mask-wearing requirements. “People are fed up!” Cain said of mask mandates on July 1; later that day he was hospitalized.
He wouldn’t be dead if Trump didn’t hold his rally and n Tulsa. #supportingtrumpgetsyoukilled
If Trump wore a mask, Herman Cain might still be alive.
Sometimes I wonder why hasn't God punished Trump...
tRump's tweet on delaying election is a distraction from his failures!   Here's a few: #RussiaBountyUSTroops #GDP33%drop #UnemploymentRate #Covid19  #Racism  &amp; Herman Cain has died from Corona virus!   attended the tRump #SuperSpreader event in Tulsa OK!

Even the Trump PAC says he can't delay the election.
That’s my problem, I get mad and start tweeting and hitting reply before I think. But Trump did it today. I don’t know what he was thinking.

Like he got it at a trump meetingBREAKING: The 100 Day Siege Begins!  "They will be targeting Trump's poll workers saying they are targeting minorities"
Twitter stinks. However I want to stick around when the lose it after  Trump victory.
So sad to hear this he was a voice of conservatives. He will be missed by us. For those who spout obscenities consider the source and move on. I believe that’s what Herman would want us to do. Let’s make sure we vote for Donald Trump one last thing for Herman. He would be pleased
Perfect interview, Steve! Powerful words. We’re not going to take Trump’s pathetic attempt to hold on to power.
Have no dog in this fight, but I’m guessing you’re against Trump...what exactly do you think “your side” has been doing the last 3 1/2 years?
#WeWillVote as it’s never been more important. Voting out Trump and Trumpism is VITAL for this nation to survive.
I know someone who was dying of COVID AND double pneumonia, was praying with a fried of mine on phone over this woman, she was 72 but had been active and in decent health, same week Trump mentioned HCQ she got HCQ, she went home within the week and is fine now
I can see the smile on your face when you tweeted this. You want to get rid of Trump so much you don’t care if it hurts Americans. Hope you feel good about yourself. Btw Trump will win in November
Mr. Clyburn, Shelby County, Tennessee has seen a 96% increase in July of the trump virus.  is praying the trump virus away. He likely won't tell you that.  And  blames the trump virus on China. Welcome to my life.
Yeah, that’s not happening. We have the obvious shy Trump voter plus just garbage polls in general.
Maybe they should undo those ridiculous tax cuts they gave out when trump took over. 🤦🏼‍♂️
This is what we’re up against.   There could literally be a stone rock vs Trump and that rock would get some votes just because people hate Trump.   It’s insane.
Red State governors could have acted like SD governor and the nation would be in such better shape, unfortunately they don’t want Trump re-elected...what would they be doing differently if not?
Lol. Of course. We still have a little over 4 months to put up with the nonsense and they can get back to start trying to impeach a trump for the next 4 years.
I wish re could go back in time to March and Trump didn't listen to Tucker and the many of the biggest SM accounts on shutdowns because none of this would have happened without that
AG are you aware of the black man who was killed in a political execution because he is a Trump supporter?  Barr “I’ve read about it”  SERIOUSLY!?!
“developing key ingredients for a vaccine for Novavax, Trump touted the significant federal investment in vaccine development, including $1.6 billion to Novavax and $483 million to Moderna.”  Gee I wonder why Dr Doom &amp; Gloom is pushing Moderna Vaccine...its a mysterieeee to me
Imagine how many people would have died if Trump had not gone out and talked about HCQ at one of his press conferences and made it available to pharmacies every where....the fact that talking points have all gone out and MSM all on the same page...HCQ bad....revealing indeed
President Trump shared video later taken down for providing 'false information' about COVID-19  BUT IT’S NOT FALSE INFORMATION!!!!
the Trump Virus. You are complicit.
There's a lot of people who hold a lot of influence on this platform and brag about it, and rightly so, they helped get Trump elected in 2016, they also influenced Trump to shutdown which was the biggest mistake any president has ever made
Wow  you gonna correct you’re false reporting on Trump Russia young got an award for ?
DR "I have put 350 patients on HCQ and ALL of them got better"  me thinks there was a reason Fauci and friends lied about HCQ from the get go, remember too that Trump accidentally found out about this drug, it interfered with their #Plandemic
Conservatives like Mitch McConnell? Mitt Romney? the sad thing about your fundraising is that it will go towards electing the Chamber Commerse endorsed Republicans...the least MAGA Trump people of all
Yeah trump 2020
THe mayor of CHICAGO is guilty of INCITING VIOLENCE AND MUST BE ARRESTED!  THIS WAS AN UNLAWFUL ACT--AND PRES. TRUMP...IT IS PAST TIME TO STOP THIS
All of those vaccines will be using fetal tissue , Trump shouldn’t be pushing any of this
Why on earth would Trump be jealous of Fauci. This is just stupid. Congrats!
Decent, honest,... no of those words describe Biden. I thought you were going to say Trump.
Wages were up and unemployment was at record lows with Trump. Taxes down. Joe will give you the opposite.
Trump pushing fast tracked vaccines was not what we voted for
You’re brainwashed by the mainstream media. I feel sorry for you. You’ve been given multiple facts and all you come back with is this fake narrative that Trump is this and that. Trump is not perfect at all, but he is much better than the competition and is what this country needs
Trump--Love him or don't like the "man"...But "THE PRESIDENT" he is, is historical. He has not been motivated by Politics as usual--thats what angers Congressional Hill--ALL -Republican/DEMS.  Trump is "in this" for WE THE PEOPLE!. Like no other President before, 2020-Vote Trump
On Me this my same attitude if I’m EVER in the same building as trump😂
The only thing to Trump that hoax has been the hysteria  on Corona....as bad as the Flynn firing was it’s got nothing on the disaster shutdowns are still wrecking on this country
Trump needs to tweet this
If you don't consider "yourself" a dumbass?   Then you will Vote Trump 2020.  Now if you wish to declare to the World You Are a dumbass...we now who u r!
If trump wins the left will peacefully protest. If trump loses the right will march around with their Huns while the rest of us sit inside and ignore them.   There’s no war coming. There will never be a second civil war.
UF freedom and rights only go as far until U infringe on my freedom &amp; rights!  Do U get it People!  Hate is not of God but of the devilish Democrats who feed HATE AS OFTEN AS POSSIBLE. I HAVE TO STATE: I NOW NOT A REPUBLICAN &amp; DEFINITELY NEVER A DEMOCRAT. I WILL VOTE 4 TRUMP 2020
Trump is definitely Shang Tsung
He’s made the economy! None of these deaths are his fault, but are Chinas! Go Trump!!
She will claim one of them is Trump, there will never be one produced because it doesn't exist
Dr. Doom and Gloom is praising Trump for shutting down GOP convention and wearing the mask...meanwhile he's laughing his a$$ off
You can tell the ones who really dont want Trump re-elected
Trump said Hillary would wind up in jail....turns out the jokes on us....those of us resisting tyranny of new normal rules end up in jail...can't make this stuff up
Trump is really missing the opportunity to expose there isn't really a deadly pandemic...why won't he?
Reading the majority of the responses the media and the CDC have been successful in their attempt to scare Americans and shut down normal life for the hope it helps remove Trump from office. Pathetic
Here's Why Mitt Romney Thinks Donald Trump Will Win Reelection  via  THE ONLY WAY TO STOP THIS FROM HAPPENING IS GO AND VOTE ON NOV 3rd #stopTRUMP #StopTrumpFascism
It’s never going to end until Trump starts exposing the lies of Covid
And yet strangely enough everyone and their brother are telling you to wear the mask...including Trump....really makes you think
Based on what? He was VP for eight years and we were just fine. It’s only under Trump that the government is attacking its citizens.
Mnuchin works for  about Trump have the forgotten man's back again? That's what got him elected the 1st time
Because Trump is still buying into the false narrative on COVID, there's going to be Pandemic 2.0 and governors will shutdown again, how are we going to vote during shutdowns?
Hope this Judge is watching his back.... Among the documents are transcripts from Maxwell's depositions from the case which had previously been kept confidential.  Maxwell's attorneys have one week in which to file an appeal on Judge Preska's decision.
Trump looks to be about early 50’s in that. How old is he now?
What's true is they would have attacked anything Trump did so it would have been nice if we didn't kill 100k businesses and cost 40 millions jobs
Trump needs to expose the lies about COVID and stop telling people to wear the mask, his poll numbers would skyrocket
LOL they still don't understand why we elected Trump
Dude simmer down.....do you have Trump confused with Hillary
Dustin Rayburn &amp; TJ Berens of Carnation, WA Exposed for Hanging Photo on Facebook  via
Folks this really can happen. It's scary as he'll if they removed Trump or kill him Pence would be the 46th president. Soon after that he died from coronavirus. Then Nancy Pelosi will be the new president.
That’s exactly how I feel about the current Republican Party of Trump - a mob of evildoers.
Politics aside, can u blame him?  Having half the country whining &amp; pissing/moaning any time u do/say anything?  I’m torn. I don’t want Biden. I don’t care 4 Trump. But the left just whined for 4 yrs &amp; are going to get “their way” bc we gave in - Stuff parents r taught not to do
Your boy doesn’t want another 4 years Jesse. What he is doing now &amp; past few months is WAY beyond “normal Trump stuff”.  He is doing shit to ensure no re-election. Biden sucks ass too, but anyone w/any sense wouldn’t act the way DT is acting without trying to “throw the game”
I also  2 other reasons why Trump pivoted to pro mask  1) With masks, no need for mail-in voting    2) wearing a mask creates a need for voter ID  Who knows?
He doesn't control Trump, but all the governors are listening to him so he might as well
So funny that Trump thought wearing the mask and telling people to wear the mask would change anything
'I wanted to take action': behind the 'Wall of Moms' protecting Portland's protesters | This is a seminal moment for the ⁦ ⁦ Just think about #Chicago democratic convention in 1968. ⁦
At one time I thought Trump would change it, after all both parties hated him, I no longer think that, no one man is ever going to save us, we the people are going to have to do it
Kanye West sets out his 2020 election platform  “West said he envisions a White House management model based on the secret country of Wakanda in the film Black Panther. “
Reporter: “Black people are being killed 7x as much as white people”   Trump: “many many white people are killed”  Boy they sure don’t assassinate like they use too😕  Can we at least impeach AND CONVICT him of the crimes we’ve SEEN him commit  Sick of this nigga mane😒
He likes pedophiles. Trump’s Warm Words for Ghislaine Maxwell: ‘I Just Wish Her Well’
Let’s be real: I don’t care about the British Open. We all knew Trump was going to use the office to build his wealth.   But federal police forces in American cities and sending well wishes to a known child sex trafficker? Should unquestionably be top stories today and everyday.
Trump also realized he cannot/does not want to do this anthr 4 yrs &amp; is self-sabotaging himself &amp; campaign WAY more than usual to ensure he isn’t elected again. Tell me I’m wrong. He is def not normal, but even then he wouldn’t do the shit he is doing if he wanted re-elected.
OK Sean....then why do you continue promoting the idea Trump is saving us from a virus less deadly than the flu?Why is delaying voting more important than opening school's? Mr. Trump tweeted, "properly, securely &amp; safely"! I know the reason it's all about you not our most precious resource: our children! BBC News - Republicans to Trump: You can't delay 2020 election
When Trump first began his campaign, he was touting a 6% gdp growth goal....  that’s always stuck with me as such a gross overestimate of his influence on the country’s economy
Nichole Williams says she never wants to fight for toilet paper again. She says the economy doesn’t need to be shut down again and she thinks Trump did the best he could. She says she declared in August of last year and has been everywhere and answered to everyone.
Trump has NO friends .  .  .
Funding isn’t going to stop trump from slowing down the mail &amp; preventing ballots from being counted. He’s installed his crony and he has already started slowing down mail delivery and cutting hours.   will have to restore service along with the funding.
The Dems will now stop at nothing to destroy our nation just to get rid of Trump. We are in a fight for our lives.
Well Done JW! I hope to see you with a presidential award after Trump wins again.
I always want to know what they look like. No one has ever been outside when I drive by a trump house. There are a lot less trump signs out compared with this time in 2016. I find that encouraging. I don’t get mad when I see them but my anxiety goes way up.
Watch Live: President Trump to hold press conference
But it did accomplish changing the news cycle from record low GDP to trump’s tweet. Most of what he does or says is diversion and you all fall for it.
What a petty insecure child. Why did Republicans  think THIS was the best person for the job of president? I’m suffering from culture shock going from President Obama to trump!
Journalist shot in the face with impact munition by federal agents during Portland protest. #TrumpsGestapo #LawlessFeds #HiredThugs #HELP Federal cowards shoot unarmed people running away from their violent behavior!  Trump’s gestapo...gutless mercenaries!
In case it gets overlooked, you should know that today the GDP reported the worst numbers in the history of the United States so that when your meemaw says "TrUmP iS DoInG sO MuCh FoR tHe EcOnOmY!" you can tell her our economy is worst than THE GREAT DEPRESSION.
Fulling funding of the  will not stop them from delaying mail delivery and reducing hours of operation. The Postmaster trump installed was selected for this very reason.     you have the power to stop the destruction of our USPS.
This is the perfect summation of the Trump Presidency
If only he had killed innocent civilians, trump would fight for him to be pardoned by Putin.
Follow the money! Of course the new company that will have control over COVID-19 data is one of trump’s people &amp; has NO experience in this kind of work. Anyone surprised?
The sad truth about how Trump snookered the endlessly gullible mainstream media – Raw Story #TrumpVirus #CorruptGOP  Will the press fix this? CNN is working on it... False choice adopted by trump, his minions &amp; the press.
And here we are... Everything should be open....except elections.
He’s also trying to divert the media away from John Lewis’ funeral today where our true presidents, Clinton, Bush &amp; Obama will be speaking. Unfortunately, they buy into any shiny object trump tosses out.
It’s hilarious that everyone is torn up about Trump just mentioning a delay in voting.  #Trump2020.
“The Lord has historically used military ministry to not only touch American lives, but thousands of Germans,” a Pentecostal minister in Heidelberg told  Chapter of that history closes with announcement of troop withdraw
I'm talking about today. You realize he does not hold political office right now. Another thing. Bernie is not going to be President in 2021. It's just not going to happen. I wanted Warren myself but they didn't get the votes in the primary. Joe is our best hope. tRump must go.
Trump suggests delaying 2020 election amid claims of inaccuracy
He cares more than tRump. Just sayin.
Ten GOP Senators want COVID aid linked to policies allowing churches to reopen
Texas has more than 420,000 cases - the 2nd most in the US, and is in the midst of a surge.   *rump traveled there for a fundraiser. Did not wear a mask. Addressed a packed room without masks. #IdiotInChief #unpresidential #darwinaward
I think Trump should legalize it across the Country, Sessions was against it, Barr I'm unsure, but most Liberal cities have legalize it, including States. I say fuck the red and blue, go with gold!  Very Good Weed looks golden 😁😁
Shortly after Trump lauded the possibility that HCQ &amp; Z-pak could work, Dr.  Siegel’s 90 yo father got COVID.  He gave him the HCQ+ - and he survived. NINETY years old!
Trump has done everything right with covid or many millions would have died, especially in democrat ran cities and states! Thank god you was not president when this hit!!!!
This is how trump attempts to rig the election
So yes, Trump was right, mail in voting will be rigged. By his big donor in charge of the usps suddenly closing offices and cutting staff. How is this not a major headline across all channels right now?
Trump 2020
So does that mean that doctors can’t prescribe to their patients???  OMG....it IS a scam.  I am absolutely livid that this is happening to our country.  The left hates Trump so much.....they are willing to let people die and totally destroy our country.  I want to spit!! 🤬
President Trump says second stimulus check ‘may go higher’ than $1,200
Trump violated the constitutional rights of the people his secret police arrested. They did not properly identify, did not read rights, and could not articulate what crime was committed or about to be committed. Trump is for Big Gov, the exact opposite of Republican values.
Looks like a boat parade for President Donald Trump is being held Sept. 5 on Watauga Lake.
UM WE HAVE THE BEST RUNNING....TRUMP 2020 COMRADE HUME!!!
We'll give you Joe Biden as a gift of surrender. Then in the middle of the night Bernie will climb out of Biden's broken open body and fuck you up while you sleep-off the inevitable global drunken celebration following Trump losing 2020.  Fuck metaphors. That's the literal plan.
Trump- like minds.
Oh god . . . a grassroots group of former Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders supporters who recognize Joe Biden's flaws but know that our nation will not survive four more years of Donald Trump.
Too many Trump supporters aren't. They have a lot of hate inside.
This will have a major impact on churches that minister to US soldiers and their families. They've been bracing for the news.
Thank you for speaking up.  I wish your Republican colleagues shared your patriotism.  They are so terrified by Trump, they fall in line even when his actions are detrimental to the country.  I am embarrassed by  who won’t push back even though he’s retiring.
He is so afraid to do anything to upset trump. All of the Republicans are afraid of him, this isn’t democracy, it’s a cult. Elect   for a change,  for someone who will represent TN not special interests. Vote Democratic!

Here's why this is so sinister: "His approach would provide an off-ramp for one of the imminent confrontations between Trump and the court."  Abortion would become, or start to become a State's Rights issue, which is what they've always wanted. Justice for SOME, nothing for all.

Trump administration weighing drug testing for food stamps
This should be a poster for ALL Dems! That military clad dude with his weapon aimed at that scary, unarmed girl! My God, trump has made us a shithole country! #WhyIDontLikeTrump
Good thing you did nothing to help Hong Kong so that Trump could grovel for election interference. Glad to see you can be a twitter warrior but when the time comes to do something in Congress you shrivel like the worm you really are.
I get the idea from this tweet that they are talking about charging Obama and his administration with treason, not trump.
Poor lil Trump. Only took 3.5 years for it to finally hit home that no one likes him...
Trump 2020!
Trump 2020!
Trump 2020!
Trump 2020
President Trump  said "It's going to get worse before it gets better" is true!   If the protests keep going and Trump is reselected as President, then the protesters are going to really lose their minds.
Trump says we have more COVID cases because of more tests. Schools and jobs opening causes fewer tests, causing fewer confirmed cases before the election.  If people take Hydroxychloroquine before that dip, it will look like a cure. Then he'll claim he singlehandedly cured COVID.
Trump 2020!
Quacks disguised as doctors-
If the shelves were empty, they had 3 1/2 years to restock it. They dismantled the pandemic response team long before we were hit with this. Where did the supplies come from that were shipped to China in February/March? Trump is incapable of accepting responsibility for ANYTHING!
Hearings held on U.S. Park Police behavior before Trump’s church photo
And his number is the number of Trump Tower...
Trump campaign needs to produce commercials that cut from these idiots telling us that these are peaceful protests to the scenes of destruction, violence and murder. This needs to be made the face of the Democrat Party. They do this, Trump wins
Call Trump’s Tactics What They Are: Fascist
They will. The pressure will be immense. They just have to look like they listened to Gov Lee so that he provides funding. He has to look like he's listening to Trump so the state gets fed funding. We are all dying for Trump's daily quid pro quos and mob tactic politics.
America would be Great Again if Trump Lost all Power and Authority today
Or a damned Trump rally.....right
Northam said that while Dr. Birx commended the steps Northam's administration has taken, President Trump has been calling to "free Virginia."   "There's a disconnect when we're all trying to deal with this and work together and have a good end result, it's unfortunate."
How in the hell is anyone, even in rural America, where Republicant's seem so concerned about the suffering of, going to survive on $200 a month from Unemployment while their jobs were shifted oversea by Trump and corporate capitalism or won't be back for 6+ months due to Covid?
I don't believe a word that comes out of Biden's mouth. It's all scripted and a known liar, which no one seems to give a shit about. The only thing maybe changing my mind is Trump sending secret police. That is just in fucking sane. Biden will not support a green deal, at all.
I've never seen this country so close to 1938 Germany. The Congresswoman from Arizona repeated Fascist talking points from that era, complaining about "that other party" refusing "law and order" &amp; not standing behind Hitler/Trump when the PEOPLE protest, legally, in the streets.
It should be the Confederate flag trump loves so dearly not the American flag he has dishonored.
Because he doesn’t care. Trump is not working for the American people. He never has. People need to wake up and realize that.
A surgeon who goes maskless to his rallies, no less.  I voted for Flinn - snowball's chance, but not a total Trump goosestepper.
I never recovered from 2007 (Bush), and now I have to recover from 2020 (Trump).
Ralph Reed rallies evangelicals in Georgia to re-election Trump "to glorify God and make sure that Christians are the head and not the tail, and the top and not the bottom of our political system.”
But trump retweeted it, what happened to his account  .
Trump is about to add him to that star studded RNC event. Hahaha
He can do a lot more damage to our justice system in 6 months (so can trump).
This is what President Trump is defending America against
Just PLEASE don’t run clips of trump, you can tell us what nonsense he’s spouting.  , for the most part, spares those of us who are traumatized by hearing his propaganda. If he comes on, we turn off. Wish you the best!
Sorry to tell you trump has given citizens permission to hate. No other president has done that before   #TrumpFailedAmerica #TrumpVirus
Are you bimbo's The Daughters of Russian Parents, Or you just trying to give women a bad name. Real Women can read a book and make "Real decisions about TRUMP" And real Women Won't Vote Gump. They #VoteBlueNoMatterWho #VoteTrumpOut #VoteBiden
But it won't happen. If for no other reason than that Trump literally planted his flag there. But it isn't just that, it's that despite itself, South FL just can't get it together, the Poll tax on an otherwise great referendum, and Jacksonville, which speaks for itself.
Nowadays, she's more likely to be visited with a medal from tRump
Yeah feds are absolutely there to escalate. Trump's relying on footage to keep up the "look what liberals want!" angle.  I'm just worried about a jumpy cop firing a live round, setting off a powder keg of cops panic-firing in the same general direction. Feels almost inevitable.
Florida is already Lean Trump, he's planted his flag there now and seeing 2018 plus the poll tax on the new law allowing former felons to vote is just icing for them. It's not a state to be up in arms over rn.
The election is rigged unless he wins then he knew it all along. Just you watch....I'm hoping for anyone but trump
The   should reject this being part of COVID-19 relief. This is strictly to benefit trump financially- have some decency and remove it. People are desperate for aid and you want to put more money in his pocket. And corporate deductions? Unbelievable!
Ballad cares and offers unlimited tests. The delay isn't a lack of testing but for lack of COVID labs. Leadership at the State or Fed level has the power to remedy this. Ballad is badly handicapped by Trump &amp; Lee who hate tests. Answer is rapid testing, even  agrees.
Lol the swamp existed decades before Trump even got into politics
She needs to get her ass to the food pantry lines people. Do something humanitarian. Jesus, Trump and Co truly, truly, truly suck ass.
People like this are all over TN. They won’t wear a mask and laugh and say it’s a hoax to make trump look bad. This is trumps fault. He politicized this and people are dying.
The man is dead.  I don’t think they’ll be a friendship.  It would be a sign of respect, but that’s a concept Trump doesn’t understand.
Melania Trump has announced plans to redo the White House Rose Garden to make it more in line with the original design implemented during the 1960s Kennedy administration.
Let em try we all know they can't cancel Dave   I think it's hilarious nobody says a bad word about this guy until he sits down with trump just for an interview 😂
Biden emphasizes Trump's mishandling of COVID-19 in new ad campaign targeting older voters. GOOD! #Biden2020 #VoteBlueToEndThisNightmare #TrumpVirusKills145K
Brother Kent, I would urge you to replace the phrase #BlackLivesMatter or #BLM with something that describes what you desire to communicate. My recent poll of the main goal of BLM resulted in 2% to end racism or injustice, 98% defeat Trump or create chaos. 1/2

Hundreds participate in boat parade for President Trump in Myrtle Beach
Sure glad we spent all that money and labor on a useless wall that is only 46 miles long and is now falling down because of bad weather. This is the kind of shoddy work Trump does.
I think Trump has experience in politics.  I think he even donated money to the clintons.  He used politician.  Most of the politicians are for hire. They sale their soul for that money and re-election.  Trump’s net worth has decreased.  I’m not sure why he even wanted the Job.
While Sethi has Cruz's backing, his opponent, Bill Hagerty, has the support of President Trump.
We are ALL watching the Biblical fight between GOOD (God, Trump Administration, Patriotic Americans) and EVIL (Satan, Marxists Communists Democrats, Soros, Antifa). Pick a side.. Time is short.
I vote for this! Dump Trump.
This “art” makes me disappointed in liberals.
It isn’t just trump but other  running for office- it’s almost Iike they know they have the election rigged and don’t have to worry about winning votes.
They, being the trump administration, yes.
Jesus. And a portion of our citizens think those numbers are exaggerated to make trump look bad. And they believe it.
I had a Trump wall joke but I couldn’t quite finish it.
Ive seen 1 and about 3 bumper stickers.
I thought I would give you something to make you smile (and perhaps laugh out loud). I normally wouldn't find this funny but God is the author of poetic justice so my laughter is a celebration of Him and His sense of humor.
The intensity with which the MAGA bots and trolls are lying about #PortlandProtest in good evidence that Sending the DHS was yet another one of Trump’s endless string of mistakes.
I wish they would all go home before sunset. Leave the hooligans on the street to deal with trump’s stormtroopers.
This is psychology 101. The Trump campaign has no enthusiasm. You’re projecting again, Donny. 😆
She should be more mature. Like trump. He would never call anyone names.. oh wait
I had a joke about Trump’s glass of water, but I tossed it aside.
This isn’t a test he took recently. He took it two years ago for his 2018 physical. A person can develop clinical dementia in as little as 1-2 years. Their diet can actually increase the rate of decline and we all know what Trump’s diet looks like.
What joke! Lol! We already have that in the White House! But, I am assuming that the next GOP presidential nominee will be worse than the last; its a trend—Dubya, Trump, maybe Alex Jones will be the GOP nominee? #StupidIsAsStupidDoes!
I own a 1990 book called AIDS Demo Graphics that focuses on visual protest from ACT UP when the U.S. government was deliberately failing to address the AIDS epidemic. Many could easily be about Trump or red state governors and COVID-19 with only slight changes.
The first of the year, Democrats were in panic mode over losing a substantial amount of the black vote to Trump.   If you go back, you will notice story after story attempting to instigate black protest.  2/
Want to know why the riots and #BLM movement continues?   Stories like this from December.   1/
Me too!
Watching the senate race in TN,  went way up in the polls because of the hit job on Kavanaugh and Trump support. I really think that Trump will win huge and bring some Trump Republicans will tide the wave.
Trump is both successful at marketing and getting things done. That is why he will win in a landslide.
The endless, trump scum sucking local political ads on a Sunday morning are vomit inducing.             (Have I left any of the fools out?)
You can the liberal America hating communist are trolling our great president with their ignorance on full display for all to see!!! TRUMP 2020!
Trump is still your president!!!!
No, the Democrats did this. The ferals in the street murdering and looting are being egged on by the likes of CNN to make Trump look bad. Oh, and I missed the part of where Trump "promised" a civil war. When did that happen?
They worship at the altar of Trump
This is totally BS and Ridiculous but stupidly Funny Trump a Spy for the US lmao 🤣😂🤣more like Russia.
Donald Trump’s ‘Operation Legend’ named after 4-year-old boy killed while sleeping at home

President Trump goes one-on-one with Chris Wallace | Full Interview  via
Are you REALLY thinking Trump is all of a sudden taking this virus seriously?
The next president,  which I pray its trump, may get as many as 5 scotus picks during the next 4 years....let that sink in.
For the sake of our democracy,  MUST stop trump from sending stormtroopers to American cities to incite violence. Vandalism &amp; violence is coming from the right-wing Boogaloos, Proud Boys, Neo-Nazis to create chaos. Typical fascist tactics.
If it’s Trump;it’s not selfless!
The problem for me is that people were saying that up until hours before Trump won 2016.  I'm refusing to trust any political polls until they've proven some credibility again.
I’ve seriously wondered what I’ll do if the election is rigged or there is no election and trump stays on. We will no longer be a democracy, we will be a fascist autocracy, we are well on our way now. I don’t want to live under a corrupt dictator. I’ve lived 73 years.
Me too, I wanted her 1st as President but the way things shook out so far, at this point I want her as the Attorney General to straighten out the terrible mess left by Barr, Trump, Sessions.   I also want her in the drivers seat to prosecute the former President, the #OrangeLoser
Please if you are a Republican, don’t go. President Trump, please don’t go
It's the same as voting for Trump and Voting for Independent is saying what Trump and GOP has got away with past 4 yrs is ok and we can't afford anymore F U votes it's what's got us here #VoteTrumpOut2020
New York City had one of the highest  COVID death rates in the world. It is Democrat run. Yet it is Trump’s fault.  If Democrats are such better at governing, why are the results in the Democrat run cities abysmal?
First they're rioters, not "peaceful protesters'. Second, they are the Federal Protective service and their job is to protect Federal property. Since the mayor is not doing this, they must protect the Federal Buildings from the mob of ferals. Third, this will help Trump win again
Indictments by Labor Day, Ratcliffe Massive Declass, Trump Blasts Obama/...  via
How do people know they are part of trump’s troops? They have no identification and they dress the same as right-wing extremists like the Proud Boys &amp; Boogaloos. You could be abducted by one of them. This is frightening.
Portland is Fucked then!!!... Because Trump is gonna WIN REELECTION!!... TRUMP 2020!!!
we love you but cannot stand to watch trump &amp; have to turn it off. We have suffered enough for 3 1/2 years, please don’t promote his propaganda by continually airing clips of him.  We are pretty much down to watching  &amp;  because they skip trump.
Friday, President Donald Trump awarded former Olympic runner and ex-Kansas Congressman Jim Ryun the Presidential Medal of Freedom.
I understand why they are protesting but this is what trump wants. In the meantime, there are far-right antagonist who are committing violence and destruction and blaming it on the peaceful protesters. Please go home and stay safe!
You can’t have it both ways either you are anti-racist then there is no way in hell you can support trump or you support racism when you support him
I SO agree, and he Might do it to get brownie points (And Millions of Votes) that's why if Biden strikes the match first it doesn't matter as much what Trump Does!  I DOUBT the #OrangeLoser would pull the trigger then - because it was Biden's Idea (Bad, of course!)
Happening soon: President Trump expected to sign executive orders on drug pricing &amp; health care
Fix it now while there’s something left.  There may be nothing left in the future in a second Trump term. The Dem’s have been woefully inadequate with their messaging.  Lincoln Project has reached independents and dissatisfied Republicans, who they need to win.  Say thank you.

President Trump and his pathetic group of southern Republican governors are now trying to save people? Governor Lee has failed the state of Tennessee. Wear your masks.
I said the same thing about  but they altered a weather forecast to cover for trump’s screwup. That can also be a life and death situation if people don’t trust them to report accurate forecasts. Every government agency has been corrupted by trump and his sycophants.
In shift, Trump says some schools may need to delay opening
Here's what's so funny: airdropped cash would be the closest thing to a campaign promise Trump has kept since he was elected. It's why half of the Midwest and Appalachia voted for him in the first place; PEOPLE ARE POOR.
GOP racing against clock to get coronavirus relief package on President Trump’s desk
BECAUSE HE HAS BEEN WRONG THE WHOLE TIME, JUST LIKE YOU AND THE FAKE NEWS CNN! TRUMP 2020!!!
Trump to visit North Carolina, cite work on COVID-19 vaccine
He did not. He did not find it or report it. A member of the crew reported and NASCAR did exactly what it should by launching an investigation. But of course, you don’t do any real research and only believe what trump tells you.
The seventh trumpet is not the Trump of God signifying the Rapture, along with the shout, and voice of the archangel.
Trump is using Putin’s playbook and receiving instructions on how to proceed. It’s a damn shame elected congressmen are so afraid to stand up to him.
White supremists, KKK, Neo-Nazis, Proud Boys- the far-right inciting violence to fit trump’s narrative.   I wish ALL the peaceful protestors would go home and leave these hooligans on the streets to be picked up by trump’s Gestapo.
We are and I bet they are work for Erik Prince. He tried to get them hired when trump first took office.
I was Republican; turned Independent when Reagan Rode in on a horse, cross-in-hand. I would've long ago turned Dem but they don't fucking fight back! Weak! They need to SET the Pace, #1. start calling a Lie a Lie! #2. Remove Pot from Sched 1 #3. REPEAT Sexual Allegations V Trump!
Lol where did you find these people? You lie like trump. Take that somewhere else
Pres. Trump holds White House coronavirus briefing, cancels Florida RNC events
Also you look like you're having deep thoughts on how to get rid of Trump... Just my observation of course!

Governor of Oregon should bring in the National Guard to Evict Trump's Brown Shirts.
I am voting for Trump. I don’t care- being called a racist means nothing to me
He ought to bring in the National Guard to Evict Trump's Brown Shirts then turn toward the Police Union and ask a simple Question, WTF?
Deflect so the dumb people that voted for you believe trump is the problem
One thing Biden needs to do Right Now is steal  the thunder out from under Trump by Committing to take Marijuana OFF the Schedule 1 List on Day 1.   This will create tens of thousands of jobs and Open Up legal banking for all these industries.
you were once a man of integrity &amp; I voted for you. Now, you are part of the Republican cult who blindly follow the most corrupt, immoral, racist man to ever hold the office of president. None of you who are subservient to trump are living up to your oaths of office.
Y’all hate the rioters and looters but I don’t see y’all retweeting trump saying he’s going to stop crime in cities. Cause y’all know it’s fucked up and unnecessary. It never bothers y’all if it doesn’t affect you personally but BLM starts up again and y’all get shitty.
I made a post that no Trump supporter can argue... He should not have wished a child sex trafficker "well".   Instead of saying, "I agree", they keep scrolling. Usually they wanna fight me about how great he is. Weird, huh? 🙃
Andrew Jackson was openly racist towards First Nations. Any President who owned a slave was openly racist. Any president who used racial slurs or pointed towards minorities as “the cause of problems” was racist. Trump isn’t the first and isn’t even the worst. Just the dumbest.
I SAY FUCK TRUMP &amp; ALL HIS BRAINWASHED SUPPORTERS...THEY ALL MAKE ME SICK
Oh man. It's getting really Crazy. I hope we vote trump out and he leaves. There's a petition to sign to make sure he leaves saying that we the people will remove him if he don't Exit on Biden's Inaguration, Let the Military know we want stand 4 him not leaving.
Although, I do have hope because the country couldn't stomach Trump and Barr violently clearing out Lafayette Square for a photo op with an upside-down bible in front of a church he doesn't attend. The country wouldn't stomach a dronestrike, either, but will that stop them?
So what I support trump, so what if I don’t agree with things you agree with.. what happened to the world where everyone could enjoy each other’s company regardless of their views...
Trump is not the right person to lead anyone....PERIOD!
After all the good will I've recently spotted this guy in comparison with Trump, it's good to feel some disdain again

Exactly. unfortunately there are too many housewives which Trump sings Love that value their husband's opinion more than any opinion they would ever dream of having for them self
Yeah trump and Biden will not move left I know that’s why I’m not voting for them
Trump made heads explode today by asking a question about maybe delaying the election until people can vote in person...that question was directly aimed at Democrats that want mail-in voting and they took it hook, line and sinker🤣🤣🤣🤣
you know, I didn't realize that someone could be a bigger loser than Trump but you have done it. You have proved me wrong. Brad, you're a loser. And what the real kicker is is that you got fired by that loser. So yeah I think that makes you the bigger loser or The biggest loser
Hey what about the Trump pompeo Barr regime in the United States?
Trump knows there won't be a delay..he's playing you fools
The reason for all this crap is Trump is draining the swam and it will soon hit them very hard. OH! Ya Epstein killed himself, if you believe that you're not using your brainpower, Hill hit squad, just follow the money. Like what did Bill do on his island fish or talk about ???
Remember Dems blame Trump 4 things they did or do like he is dividing the country when if U R stupid U think that but smart people know the truth. Like Russia spent $100,000.00 on FaceBook adds 2 influence our vote, so how many votes did it get him one, two. Hill paid $4million.
Is it just me but I think these polls are fake and the News know it that is way as we get closer to election day they will move Trump closer to make it look neck &amp; neck yet they know Trump is in the lead but Tv want the viewers
This is what I'm talking about. If Kelly is up 53 to 35, I have a hard time seeing Trump winning AZ.
No you are a troll. I’m a Socialist voting for another socialist. I’m not voting for right wing Biden or trump

Trump bad is not a policy.
I love Trump
Did he even mention Hermain Cain,a Republicain partner, why he doing pizza commercials and advertising, he could have thrown Godfathers pizza in, Herman was former Ceo of Godfather pizza and supported Trump, show him respect.
Because trump sees you as a colony to the USA now.
It cannot happen as he has no control, but trump is testing his base for other evil actions to follow.
Since trump is not going to be there in January let’s vote for James Mackler  an not put another Moscow Marsha in office. Come on Tennessee use your brains. Put a man in office that will help Tennessee
Trump as President of the United States didn't have class enough to send a representative too Rep John Lewis service
I can agree with this, and Im not even a Trump fan, or a Republican....
I want liberals to sign a contract saying they will vote green no matter what in 2024. I don’t believe them when they say..2020 is not the time...that after trump...we can fix it... ok so sign a contract then we can talk about a possible Biden vote from me
I'm not a polling expert but if the Kelly vs McSally polls are right, it's hard to see Trump winning here just because Kelly seems so popular, McSally seems so unpopular (she's already lost the last election), and the splits to vote Kelly (D) and Trump (R) would have to he high.
Lathan is capping  We all know his favorite Trump is
That is sad. Poor man believed in trump and cost him his life. As many others are. 150,000 dead.
Herman Cain arrogant attitude killed him. Didn't he say the virus was a hoax. Trump just provided the place
Pence and the others are using Trump. If their coats catch on fire watch how fast they will pull a Joe McCarthy on his ass. Self preservation is a bitch
Not really, always Trump first
74 year old with some health problems going to show us he didn't have to wear a mask, he is a Trump supporter and the devil takes care of their own
Delay the election because of the pandemic. That's a good one, considering we are in this mess because having Trump as President during a pandemic put us in this mess.  Over 150 thousand + deaths so far
Herman Cain, Mr 999 Republican presidential candidate has died from COVID-19. He attended the rally in OK, the no mask rally. Good thing Trump had everyone sign a waiver not holding him responsible for sickness and death. Money can't save U from this virus
25A your friend and savior trump.
Trump is floating the idea of delay election because of his so-called mail in voter fraud. WTF? He, some of his staff, daughter Ivanka, Jared all mailed in their voting ballot. Did they try to cheat &amp; found this wasn’t a good idea? I am counting the days U FAKE PRESIDENT
Well i am consulting the Lizard people Overlords about this in their Alien DNA medical clinic, next to the Church of Demon Sex. You know the ones from trump's top Doctor.
U aren’t doing YOUR job! From the start you didn’t! 150,000 dead!
We aren’t voting trump. Focus your attention on getting Biden to support progressive policies NOW. If you can’t do it now you won’t be doing it after November.
This exchange is awesome!!! Georgia Democrat who was elected to the Georgia House of Representatives supports Trump and Craig Melvin with NBC asks him if he is being paid to support Trump! #Trump2020 #DemocratsforTrump

Who cares, covid is here now, Im 39 years old, I make less on unemployment, I have paid taxes scence 18, I deserve 600 every week, did you ask the government why they didnt save our taxes for a rainy day, hopfully the generations down the road will learn what not to do from Trump
I have always LOVED goats... until now. Thanks a lot  for adding one more to my "I can't un-see this list" . It almost tops Trump's racist tweet.
I'm most definitely betting on trump and racism if that's what you are asking though
I actually don't play those stupid games hun, but I do bet on elections though, and yes I am betting on trump though if that's what you are getting at. You guys hand picked the wrong candidate you were suppose to pick ol' Bernie
I am voting for Trump
Trump and his son have it......
Well well well, look at Trump, trian to buy votes today.........
It wouldnt matter, everybody has their own opinion, but I feel at this point, if you are still voting for trump, nothing he says or anybody else says will bring them back to reality.....they are gone, lost, done with
You know, trump is living in subsidized housing complements of the American taxpayer.

I wonder if  would have preferred they didn't test anyone this morning.  Then Gohmert could hsve gotten on the plane, and trump could have tested his Hydroxychloroquine regimen.
These are the poor people who think trump is for them. When they wake up it will be to late
Because they haven’t had a real get your hands dirty work in years. Notice Trump WH is filled with people who hardly had too work
Trump is speaking before going to TX. Won’t acknowledge Russia put bounties on our troops. Has no 20/20 plan for the Country. Doesn’t mind putting our children &amp; teachers in harms way. A big orange bully inflicting pain on his citizens. 149,000+dead from virus &amp; counting.
Maybe Trump and Barr can share a cell after jan 21 2021
Great she’s gonna hunt all the President Trump supporters down!!! Lol I’ll give you my address to help you find me!!!
I mean I don’t totally think he’s wrong here: Biden is up by 8, and realistically Trump could win with Biden being +2.5, and the election is more than three months away.
Because he was black, a Trump supporter and it doesn't fit their narrative
Oh crap.. I wonder if this will make Trump fire Barr now for making him look bad. LOL
Im not voting for Trump or Biden so November 3rd is going to be a very entertaining day on this app for me and honestly I can’t wait.
Just remember that Trump has about 88 million Twitter followers and Biden has about 8 million.
Trump will go down as the most progressive President in history. Be apart of it!

Trump wants kids back to school. Will the parents have to sign a waiver like his followers at his OK rally have to sign a waiver stating they won't hold him responsible if the contract the Coronavirus? Wait For It😜
My boy donald trump made it political and I trust him so I'm going with its political
Jim Jordan is doing his usual show for trump. He is so laughable, it is a damn shame that there is few if any Honorable Republicans anymore. One thing trump has accomplished is showing Americans the faces of Evil.

Still, I am trying to understand your point, but the federal government has done plenty regarding COVID; some of the work is to the states to do. Secondly, the virus is not Trump's fault? Early on the travel bans, they were calling him racists. Hydroxychloroquine works got bashed
No unfortunately my boy trump turned it into a political football and since I like trump I'm going to go with what he thinks. So could you please dance, sing and salute your flags and national theme songs at home before coming out to the stadium?

You are always more worried about how your hair looks on TV than anything else.  No wonder it looks the way it does, you have been up Trump's ass for the last three years.
Do you what I've realized? Trump has about 88 million Twitter followers and Biden has about 8 million. A really good disparity.
Trump supporters keep saying this maniac is going to win in a landslide LOL he never enjoyed the luxury of the popular vote and he won’t in November. They are going to “BuT 2016” themselves into never having a republican president again and I’m here for it.
Because you wanna shut our great country down! And pout in a corner with your cronies because President Trump is doing what you can’t do!!
Ah, I see. So Trump taught you how to rudely call somebody a fool.  Classy, very classy.
I won’t be voting for Biden or trump in November. Neo libs chose a right winger. Don’t come asking us for help. You got this all on your own don’t worry.

TDS, all of you. You beleave all the BS the MSM. Have feed you. Research Trump, the man is so far removed from being a racist it's no funny. He was never called a racist untill he ran agenst Clinton.
Never in history have so many evil powers come together against one man..and yet he prevails against them. Every time. Trump 2020..and beyond!

How could you possibly go play golf and have pictures made with Trump?  How could you support such a narcissistic, racist, sexist, liar?
Why would anything change? The number of people infected or dead won't change. Trump has nothing to do with the vaccine. The 4 years he's been President have been a disaster COVID or not.
Must win states for Trump: WI, AZ, NC, FL, OH, IA, GA, and TX. If he loses any of those states he will likely have to win a state Hillary won which would be unlikely if he lost any of those states.
Rep John Lewis does haven't seen any thing from Trump. 4,238,500 infected with 146,068 dead. President goes golfing.
Well, not surprised. Trump can't do anything right.
I believe Trump endorsed Hagerty before Sethi was even a blip on the screen, and would not want to reverse that early endorsement. Either would be good Trump soldiers, but each are accusing the other of formerly supporting liberals.

Let me get this straight. Those 2 trump relatives each lost a child to Rona and they still refuse to wear a mask. You did exactly right. What are they trying to do? Kill your mother??
What difference at this point does it make? LOL She lied her pants off. Why would Trump bother with a shame investigation and the documentation proves there was no evidence at all, Schiff lied. That is called sedition.
Um President Trump been telling thrse morons in the cities and states to take care of the people and stop playing games.  Not one has listen. They just cry and complain.  Maybe scroll the tweets little more before sticking a foot in your mouth.
Probably y Trump doesn’t have coronavirus 🤷🏼‍♀️
Please vote him out, dont trust the polls, theres alot of people , doesnt matter what race, that voted for Trump, secret Trumpers, thats embarrassed to say, they are a Trump supporter.
Teanna Trump too much beloved for ya?
Y'all ever notice how bitchy libertarians get when they think you assume they're going to vote for Donald Trump? Like there's some sort of libertarian pissing contest for who can find the least noteworthy person to vote for.   Libertarians are just special snowflake republicans.
I saw one but quickly disappeared, could be all the Trump2020 signs all around them
Omg, you are so right, some people also think Black voters want vote for trump, they also helped him get in the whitehouse.
What will they say when the protestors want to burn his Museum, "oh please stop" yea right. What idiots we have in this world. I love Regan but outdid him already it will be a long time to find one as good as Trump. Maybe in his family...
My birthday is 10 days after the election, what would make the perfect gift is to vote trump out of the office and get rid of the GOP politicians that are up for re-election. okay thanks bye
OMG you people kill me! 8 mnths in A warns of false info and after tells the story of Diana fleeing her satanic family she was not fleeing her satanic family she was fleeing her Nazi family. Trump = Hitler but suggest axis of power never died tinfoil hat time
If Joe wants to guarantee that half the country votes for Trump all he has to do is ask Kamala to be his VP
Everyone can call Trump Hitler yet no one can fathom The Axis of power never was defeated. Q and his drops were extremely clear with false flags and false information. It started with Princess Diana. She was fleeing Nazi Prince not Satan.
Wasn't that still a thing even before Trump though?
That’s fucking crazy that you can be so quick as to make being a pedophile about political affiliation. I suppose we can all sleep tonight under the assumption that Trump lived a mile from Epstein, partied with young women together, and NEVER touched one. ✨
Probably to protect themselves against trump and his dictatorship.
Trump hasn't killed anyone, PP, BLM and ANTIFA have.
Redirect funds it's common sense. So if you deposit your money into your savings and your money is redirected to someone else's account what does that mean? Trump is right and he always speak his mind.
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
You have the power to endorse Biden and make a real difference just by doing that so we can get rid of this Trump nightmare but instead you decide to siphon votes away from Biden to ensure a trump win. ☹️
Copy and paste this text and tweet it:  JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
He will, after he wins in Nov. The more these idiots show their ass the more they turn Dem voters to either vote Trump or not at all.
To all the trump haters when will you decide to use the information right in front of you to remove him? ABC CBS NBC during the Impeachment gave you the biggest Epstein info and you all missed it.
Again over and over demonstrate ignorane ABC CBS NBC hugest cover up in American History with Epstein during The Impeachment could stop Trump in his tracks and you all cry over cartoons but not this idiots
Say it again your all idiots biggest news cover up which would eliminate Trump NBC CBS ABC and you all just run around crying about a cartoon lie. When all of this was released during Impeachment.
Your an idiot! You get mad over her lying over a Cartoon yet all of you ignore the biggest lie and cover-up in U.S. history that could actually remove Trump Permanently. ABC CBS NBC during impeachment broke HUGE EPSTEIN stuff.
You all crack me up the greatest lie ever told and covered up was NBC, ABC, CBS during The Impeachment. You get angry over a cartoon lie but you ignore MAJOR NETWORKS LIES that could elminate Trump permenantly!
It's funny you say that because didn't Trump want to take them out of the Middle East? If what you say is true they wouldn't it be a good idea to pull them out of the Middle East instead of keeping them there but fuck trump try to keep up
Public pressure the mob is a scary thing and you can't just open fire on the mob so the only thing you can do is either fight back as an individual and face whatever repercussion comes forward or lay down and die
Trump also claims to be a billionaire but offers no proof. But hey they did steal mo way from kids with cancer.
Sounds more like the Democratic Party interference tactics than anything Russian related to me. Why  are Schiff and Pelosi warning about Trump not winning and not leaving the office? They have a crystal ball or extra ballots up their sleeve or have they set the stage for this?
I chose my Country and people over Trump. I chose FREEDOM
GOP is dead. Trump/ Russia destroyed that along with everything else. When you back someone who is a traitor, you become a traitor as well.
The real patriots will vote, and vote blue. Trump and GOP have been a miserable draconian epic failure.
Ik everyone has the right to their own political beliefs but in all honesty... if you post about adoring Trump..you will be unadded :)
LOL HAHA WAY TO GO! You got them to go against the MSM! Trump says we all wear a mask and MSM will say no masks. She says PawPatrol is cancelled they come back and say it is not cancelled LOL LOL LOL LOL AWESOME JOB! YOU FREAKING ROCK!

I think they are trying to show a "softer" "understanding" side of Trump in order to appeal to women, Independents and moderate Dems. I don't necessarily care as long as Trump wins in November.
If Trump did as much in his presidency as he does telling Americans what Obama/Biden didn't do. Where would we be?

Yeah, they trust that Trump will provide them with a good laugh
Epstein * Trump * Maxwell * Camera * TV
All you Trump haters. Why is it no one brings up Amy Robach, Nick Farrow, or the fired CBS Whistle Blower? Our three major networks covered up Epstein. Why if Trump is innocent doesn't he bring this up? Your all corrupt period.
The Trump administration is pressing forward with policies limiting transgender rights. Many rules that have been in development for years have now either been finalized or have gone into effect.

Ill say it again. Covid = Dems. and Q = Repubs. Both parties are wagin a psych war on The American People. Trump can tweet about Bubba Wallace. He can stand around and say fake news. All he gotta do is Say ABC  CBS NBC covered up Epstein GAME OVER.
Trump got no problem fake news and tweet all kinds of crap. So Trump could easily tweet out NBC , ABC, CBS covered up Epstein. Or have a reporter or some person that is in public eye staged to do it for him.
Trump might notta done the epstein party but he had the money he didn't need to aint none of the idiots who are innocent period.
Trump is gonna roast the shit out of Fausi for this and he’ll deserve it 🤣🤣🤣
So Folks Q anon or President Orange Trump enough of this crap from both sides. Put the supposed resurrected JFK JR on the tv for us or put the damn video of Hilary Clinton killing some girl in 2008 on the internet otherwise everyone STFU and ignore the idiots

All Biden can do is criticize Trump on the virus actions, and besides he’s been a total failure in his almost 59 years in politics. He’s been wrong on ALL foreign affairs for that long per Gates!!
From my perspective Bill, I’d say clearly yes, but Trump has been pulling some low poll numbers and the suburban white women are killing him. Why? I can’t figure this out.

What I want to see is what Marsha Blackburn has to say about this. Lord knows that she, and her Williamson County confidant (if he wins the GOP Primary) Bill Haggerty are nothing more than silent votes for Trump if he gets another term.
So what if the law says Trump can’t postpone the election? What if he issued a clearly illegal EO, like banning Muslim refugees? Remember the chaos that caused? Sure, he watered it down enough to pass SCOTUS; but that was after 18 months of lawsuits and uncertainty. #Election2020

Trump named a new head of the PO, so he has a plan B if whining about election fraud doesn't pan out. He'll just make sure the ballots never make it. Not to mention whatever Putin has up his sleeve.
I am sure that Mr Cain made his own decisions when it came to wearing a mask. If he chose not to wear a mask it was HIS decision. Just like it is my decision to wear one even though I do agree with president Trump about not wearing them and I "follow" Trump.
And you know this how? From what Terrence posted he is Covid free and was with Herman Cain the entire time. Useless trump rally? Sounds like hatred to me! Mr Cain could have caught it anywhere at anytime before the rally.
My favorite pander is the senate candidate who is currently putting up split billboards with his branding on one side and the Trump/Pence slogan on the other side.
Oh I see. Trump FORCED those people to attend the rally. Everyone who went to rally went there because they CHOSE to. Because someone sets up an event does that mean you HAVE to attend? Because someone says something does not mean you HAVE to do it does it?
Just like Trump. Twist and turn it until you can make it fit. He died of Covid regardless. If Cheeto man has of encouraged masks would he still be alive or would he still have caught it? No one knows that but what we DO know: Trump disregarded his life and didn’t even try

Herman Cain, RIP. He went unmasked to the Trump "rally" in Tulsa and caught Covid virus. He passed after a month in ICU. Even though the "rally" was sparsely attended, Cain sat in a crowded section.
Trump appears to be happily killing his voters, seems like a horrible strategy to win.
No, Herman Cain didn't take it seriously, but Trump enables these views. He gives them legitimacy. And people die because of it.
Basically every left-leaning under-35 actually fully believes Trump is a fascist in cahoots with the GOP and big corps, and a true fascist takeover is occurring right beneath our noses with nothing that can be done about save, apparently, twerking in the streets and riots/arson.
When I didn't hear anything about him for a month after he was diagnosed, I was a little concerned. He went to Trump's rally, caught coronavirus, and now he is dead. It's a shame. Trump's narcissism has directly killed this man, and that is disgusting.
Trump was absolutely gaslighting the media with that tweet...many are falling for it

the only ones that lost there food stamps under trump was the ones that could work but would not  most people that are on food stamps are getting more stamps now then they was getting a year ago
Thankfully you won't have to do either, as how long a president's term lasts is explicitly stated in the constitution, so even if the election somehow got delayed, Trump would be kicked out and be replaced by the speaker of the house (presumably pelosi) on inauguration day
Trump advocates HCQ, every left wing media hack and politician is now vehemently anti HCQ. Not to mention big pharma that is facing billions of dollars in profit evaporating if it works. Full on smear campaign engaged.
When you claim that Trump will call people out on lies, I assume you think he is more honest than the people he is calling out.  Was that a fair assumption?
YOu are as insane as the news you listen to and as an insane as the woman in this video.  Do you have any idea who much the news media controls you and how much it has brainwashed weak-minded people in this country?  Trump is NOT causing division, its your news media that is!

My state passed a resolution congratulating Trump for beating impeachment and chastising the "fake news" for overblowing the pandemic. Declaring in 2021 that the state doesn't recognize Biden as the legitimate President? I can absolutely see that
Every senator and representative need to remind trump he’s not allowed to delay the election.
I constantly ask myself how do these complete morons ever get in Congress then I remember all Marsha had to do was say I’m for Trump and she won a senate seat
The first three are related don’t you think. Blaming Trump for that would be akin to blaming W for Katrina. As for the riots, that’s a left wing thing, not a Trump thing. No president is responsible for law enforcement training techniques.
Hey,  and  as my state senators, I need you to tell Trump that he can’t delay the election.   Sincerely,  one of your constituents
Trump Floats Delaying The Election. It Would Require A Change In Law
If Trump somehow postpones this election the Democrats will be even more determined and he will lose anyway. Then the Democrats will never give up the office!
The president lacks the legal authority to delay elections on his own.
My best twitter decision by far was muting Trump. Seeing his tweets on my timeline simply irritated me.
Most of us saw this coming.   With well-researched evidence pointing to extremely low chance of voter fraud (&amp; extremely high chance of voter suppression), I am quite curious to how Trump supporters will react to this.
These  tweets about delaying the #novemberelections are ONLY a ploy to divert attention away from the REAL plan of his allowing #Russia &amp; #Putin to completely to interfere in them to ensure a #Trump #ILLEGAL #victory in #November. #Congress MUST be tough on #Putin
Fascinating Mary, as mail in voting is likely to increase the number of young voters who most likely won’t be voting for Trump.
If the  truly stands for the protection of Americans’ liberty (as it claims) and not just a single liberty (#secondamendment rights), then it should loudly denounce Mr. #Trump’s suggestion of delaying the #November2020 presidential election.
Here's to all US media reacting to Trump's nonsensical shit spray about delaying the election like this ...
Also, what is your deal with China. Trump is America’s scourge. I pay taxes and I vote. He is a fraud.
We will, even if we don't. Trump will claim millions of votes for Biden were cast illegally, millions of votes for Trump were lost in the mail, we'll have Trump fans taking over courthouses to prevent counts from being certified.......
One more reason to vote straight Dem in November.
This pandemic is on china, not trump
Please explain to me why Absentee Voting isn’t subject to fraud but Universal Mail-In Voting will make this “the most INACCURATE &amp; FRAUDULENT” election?   Trump is positioning himself to have an excuse if, hopefully when, he loses the election. It’s childish and embarrassing.

Funny how nothing is ever Trump's fault but everything was Obama's fault.  •150,000+ dead from covid19 under Trump's administration •12,471 deaths under Obama during Ebola and h1n1 outbreaks.  Leadership (or lack there of) is a driving factor.
Incorrect.  Trump doesn’t even take a salary.  He donates it back to America.
Or the $325 MILLION Trump wants to remodel the West Wing.
And......... what....... All these riots is because of Trump. Your talking idiocy.
3 mos from an election that is a referendum on rampant republican malfeasance, that the dems are even considering handing Trump/McConnell a $2 Trillion bailout is just mind boggling.     That they are considering compromising in any way on key demands is political malpractice.
Russia can’t hack mail in ballots. tRump needs people voting by machine to cheat!!!!!! #RiggerTrump

Hey  what happens from this point on with regards to the economy, is on YOU.  If you can build a new FBI building for Trump gain you can pay Americans $600 per week unemployment. It's OUR FUCKING MONEY!!!
This is why  sent in federal marshals to protect the federal courthouse in Portland. Local authorities would not stop them and the ‘protesters’ would burn the building down. What’s so hard to understand? Trump has made some bad decisions. This isn’t one of them.
I agree, trump is a crybaby the way he is whining all the time.
Of COURSE BLAME TRUMP!  why doesn’t this surprise me?
Short elections guide: Donald Trump hates black and coloroured people, smart people, poor people, positive people. He likes grabbing pussies, raping women, underaged children, and being get peed on by Russian prostitutes an Putin, Kim and Xi Jinping.
Don't worry because the fack polls are not true president trump will win by a land slide anyone who would vote for Biden wants to end America
Trump’s actions have left Germany more dependent on Russian oil- another gift to Putin.
Nothing Trump does, promotes or says surprises me.  Hillary warned us and she was correct!!!!
Trump actually said he’s never asked for forgiveness &amp; has never been wrong. He also apparently takes medical advice from a witch doctor, that doesn’t seem very Christian. He also had a priest gassed so he could do a photo opp.
Trump has literally never said one honest thing in his whole life.
Umm. Steve Jobs had a brain. Trump has no brain. Thank you! I bet Tim Apple does as well.
Trump loves our enemies and hates our allies.
How Trump Could Win Reelection - The Atlantic
His father would be so proud, even more than he was when the two denied housing to blacks sixty years ago. Trump believes in segregation.  He likes it. He's just afraid to say so. He's a racist AND a coward.
I know, my mom is one of them. She believes ANY THING bad said about him is fake news.  She is literally indoctrinated into the Trump cult.  And it IS a cult.
Sorry #MAGA your gonna have to stay in your trailer parks and dilapidated homes because Trump don't want you offending the middle class folk. I think it's safe to assume none of the billions he claims to have will be trickling down to make your life any better. 🤣🤣🤣
Yes, You may love Trump or dislike him but he is no hypocrite like the rest of DC.
I believe in doing spiteful good, so we should absolutely seize Trump’s towers in CHI + NY after this is over and turn them into massive multi-use affordable housing developments, and community centers.
Democrats killing Democrats because they hate Trump... To anyone else that would make absolutely no sense...but we're talking about Deep State controlled Democrats who hate Americans of every party...it makes sense to them.
my feeling rn is that it’s going to be 4 more of Trump

Yeah Whatever!!   What has he done other then golf with Trump??
I voted for the Stoner who didn't know what an Aleppo was. But I have been extremely reluctantly red-pilled due to the absolute unhinged behavior of the Dems/Media (repeating myself). Trump is the only speedbump to throw in front of the runaway train. Am I alone in feeling this?
Conclusion: This man is a doctor and respectable. Two things that Trump isn’t!
I am appalled at the citizens here not wearing masks.I asked one man (who was working behind a store counter)why he wasn’t wearing one he said it’s “unconstitutional” and “everybody has got to die from something”.  Too many ignorant Trump supporters here.

Trump doesn’t even know Joe Biden, much less what he’ll do as President. I’m certain Joe won’t follow any of Trump’s very poor decisions!
You have accepted the fact that Trump constantly lies? Why?!  Religious texts tell you it's okay to lie to heathens?  No morals?  I'm curious.
Look at stand pretty much right in the middle when it comes to policies because I’m a female and can’t decide on shit. I’m kidding, but for real I’m a moderate, but these damn Trump lovers in my mentions are going to push me so far left it’s not even funny!
To be sure, tRump’s only job, as he sees it, is a desperate attempt at reelection, if only to delay the ultimate prosecution for multiple criminal offenses and/or complete the ambitious plans of Vladimir Putin for the despised West.
My Trump loyalist business partner has Covid.  When he asked his physician about it, his doc just smirked and prescribed Tylenol with Codeine.
So basically...  Astros = Roger Stone Rob Manfred = Trump Joe Kelly = Protestors.  Sports really do mirror real life.  #freejoekelly
Part of the reason Trump name calling Hillary in 2016 (Crooked Hillary/Nasty Woman) worked and name calling Biden in 2020 (Sleepy/Senile Joe) isn't working is because Hillary is a woman and Biden is a man. Remember, double standards are very alive in politics.
Its fascinating watching 'woke' white liberals attempt to make this racist, when Trump never suggested or mentioned race. But true to form, the soft bigotry of low expectation caused them to jump to the conclusion that 'low income' equates automatically to black people.

So you admit that you was wrong. You admit some lost funding. You are also saying trump is right. Glad you admit the truth. Good day
OPINION: President Donald Trump has been on a crusade against the “fake news” media seemingly since he was a presidential candidate. At the very least, he’s been using the term “fake news” and “enemy of the people” since February 17, 2017.
Not really.  He puts Trump first then Trump second.
“You know, you don’t want to live with them either.” Comment by Trump to a lawyer in the housing discrimination case brought against him in 1973.
I am convinced that if there is an in person debate between  and  Biden will end up punching Trump in the face. #2020Election #JoeBiden #JoeBidenForPresident2020
Seeing the commercials where Hagerty and Sethi try to out Trump and out conservative each other is going to make me break my tv. It’s already breaking my brain.
Trump cut funding to PP though.
Forget everything else. There are now 150,062 reasons Trump should not be in the White House and must be removed. #VoteBlueToEndThisNightmare
I’m almost thing that the Trump cult is worse than any other I have seen. I’m not talking about the ones that support the president, I am talking about the ones that hang on his every word. The ones that wish he was grabbing their junk.
That’s pretty funny Coming from a Trump supporter!
What’s funny is Trump hasn’t killed anyone. COVID has. If Trump killed anyone he wouldn’t be president so get your facts right. Also Texas isn’t your state. You don’t own it you just love there. So also get your facts straight.
After being given the opportunity to address an assertion, you instead ignore it all together &amp; push forward with silly accusations.  So typical for people who don't really understand what they're talking about.  Do you understand  the crazy Covid response is an attack on Trump?

Trump votes by mail. The RNC is trying to suppress votes and this is their last sad attempt to do so.
It is truly unfortunate that half of the electorate in Tennessee makes candidates stoop to such a low level in order to have any shot at winning here nowadays. It’s Trump’s GOP for now.
Unless you have an argument for why the VP would turn people away from Biden or toward Trump, then the polls suggest his current floor. And I have a hard time imagining someone *already concerned* with his cog. state will move further *against* Biden based on VP. So, floor.

Never fear Trump will send his Voodoo Priestess with a truck load of hydroxychloroquine. If COVID does not get you the drug side effects will.    I feel for teachers and school administrators. I have a wife and 2 daughters that work in 3 different school systems in TN.

Or takes them from "voting Biden, despite 'dementia'" to not voting, voting 3rd party, or voting Trump? Because, again, otherwise, I don't see how the VP nomination affects this in any way other than *improving* Biden's numbers.
He still can, trump took his wonder cure he should be fine.
Not what Pres Trump stated.....Fed officers will not leave until the City is under control.
This is exactly what I’m worried about. Trump wants to be Putin, he sees it as his only way to not be strung up once the regime has changed. After November if Trump is still sitting there I think this conversation changes. Then we are either dissidents or refugees
He should take large quantities of trump’s wonder drug.
Do you have an argument that these polls are excluding the people like yourself who "know what dementia looks like"? If not, it seems like Biden's numbers will only get better, right? What VP choice do you see taking someone from "undecided, because 'dementia'" to "voting Trump"?
Or in trump’s case, a teleprompter.
That's not "false." It's a judgment that many people have reached. You just disagree.  CNN has its faults, but they do actual reporting.   doesn't. It just throws stones.  Conservative media watchdogs used to perform useful services. Now they shill for Trump.
If you really believe Trump campaign is loosing then I have some swamp and in FL that I would like for you to buy.

I don’t think we should fall for rhe public polls again. People will say they support Biden in public but then vote Trump in private. We were sure Clinton would win. We need to fight harder than ever, especially in swing states.
How is living in cultist fantasy land? You dream of fellating Trump and licking boots all day?
I get the hesitation from Dems, but a simple extension to unemployment and evictions seems like a smart move while the rest of the larger package is negotiated.

You don’t respect an AG who politicizes everything &amp; reduces sentences of potus cronies who have been convicted of felonies. Trump has been in office 4 years- done nothing but destroy this country &amp; the rule of law. Big Blue Wave will send all the ethically challenged gop home.
One thing he’s extremely consistent on: even when presented with ample evidence, Trump ALWAYS gives Putin the benefit of the doubt.  You just have to keep asking youself... why???
Wake up, folks. It's happening right before our eyes. Trump is destroying our country. Not only is he allowing this, he's PROUD of it. #BunkerBaby #OneTermLoser

Trump is rejecting all new DACA applicants, will rescind the illegal program again, and instead of a 2 year protection from deportation, it’s down to one.  This is very very good.  It’s time for Americans to dream, not everyone else.

By far and without any doubt I would say Trump cannot pass as a decent human. He is the dregs of humanity.
Let’s put the blame where it belongs, AT TRUMP FEET #TrumpIsACompleteFailure
This is a great take since Trump has caused many deaths by suppressing that masks work. So we can sue him?
Hey, disliking Trump's economic policies doesn't mean I approve of Obama's.
Gosh, it probably depends on how “everything going on” affects turnout demographics (older voters will more likely follow Trump endorsement). But feels like Manny’s got the momentum.  TBH I‘ve been renovating a newly-bought house, so I haven’t paid as much attention as I should.
I’m really thinking that Trump will try to get the Edmund Pettus Bridge renamed the Donald J. Trump Bridge...
I wouldn’t either! Good call, ⁦ ⁦ 🇺🇸
So you’re saying that Trump should hold the convention in Florida sometime in 2021 several months after a vaccine is widely available? Good plan...
Why can’t we say something nice about Trump?  I’ll start. “At least he’s not a twin.”
You wasted your time. Should of looked up Trump tweets on your phone.
It goes for them too. The difference between Trump and Democrats in matters like this is, Trump has disavowed and condemned white supremacist and neo nazis while Democrats call antifa a myth.
That’s OK. I won’t visit Trump’s grave unless there’s a way to piss on it. (So glad I caught that autocorrect had changed piss to kiss).
Is it anything like the Free hat that the Trump campaign offered for a $35 donation?
When I say that it seems our governor is banking on a position in a potential second Trump administration, I meaning “banking” in more than one way.
Only could Trump hates women trend while the left also calls Melania #MarieAntoinette The left hates women.
It doesn’t matter because we are dropping trump as president 👎
Lisa bloom paid those women. Stormy Daniels lost her case. Obama is the one that put kids in cages. In fact, Trump signed an EO to keep families together, in his second year. After schumer said they would not make legislation.
We need an ad where Trump goes on and on about what a great builder he is and how huge his wall will be interspersed with the video of the wall blowing over...
You really are insane! REALLY!!! TRUMP DIDN'T WRECK THE ECONOMY!
You do realize that I don't like him. In the last election, we had... Donald Trump Hillary Clinton That's like having to choose between John Wayne Gacy and Ted Bundy.  In this election we have... Donald Trump Joe Biden That's like choosing between Gary Ridgeway and Samuel Little.
Sure seems like God doesn’t like Trump OR that wall...
How is she wrong? No democrat has condemned the rioting. They encourage it bc they think it hurts Trump. Since they can control the narrative, they think they can control the rioters. They are mistaken.
I agree but a border wall has been in place a lot longer than we've been alive for a reason. It's not as if there wasn't a wall/fence between the USA and Mexico before Trump was elected President of the United States.
Have you ever been on a reality TV show? That's more of an accomplishment than you or me. I personally don't like President Trump. I'm just saying that he's accomplished a lot in his life. He embarrasses himself all the time. But his accomplishments are pretty incredible.
Look I'm not a Trump fan, but he's accomplished a lot more than you and me and that's a fact.
President Trump, don't worry for God Almighty is with you and YOU sir WILL win the 2020 Presidential Election!!! I decree &amp; declare it, in the Name above all names--Jesus Christ, the Son of The Living God Almighty!
I guess we should vote President Trump out and VOTE SATAN IN???  I don’t think so!!!
Obama used them! Trump said there needed to be new legislation on that. Schumer wouldn't do it and told Trump to just do an executive order. Since it was clear Schumer wouldn't do anything, Trump did an executive order stopping that. And he did it within his first year!
And what about that wall of bricks that donors had their names put on? Let’s see a picture of one of those people who won the dinner with Trump! 😂
Weird...it doesn’t even say TRUMP on it. That’s not like Trump to miss an opportunity to put his name on something tacky...
Idk about that hashtag at the end. Shits looking pretty rough for ol Trump in the polls right now.
Yes I am a Trump supporter Rick. I never said it was a hoax, nor did the President. I am saying this was man made, set up to release when it was. Simple as that.
I’ve been asked to join the “Trump 100 Club” something like 5X. What...they can’t get 100 people to join in all this time? They need to retire a few of those emails...
Why is Trump suddenly more skinny than the last time he golfed? I don't doubt Brett golfing today, I just don't believe the photo was taken in the past two years
Hoooooow is he related to Angelina Jolie 😩 it’s so funny how he mentioned God and how great this country is throughout the video, &amp; then the last few seconds mentioning Trump just completely contradicted every point he was trying to make #JonVoight
Evangelicals say Trump was elected by god.
School should resume as usual. Mask are a joke and you people know it. Once Trump wins again C-19 will be a thing of the past. Parents should be able the sign a weaver in order for their child to NOT wear a mask. There is a biblical war going on and GOD WILL WIN!!!!! #TRUMP2020
Heads up: sane people hate Trump and recognize Biden as a good person.  Just imagine being a person who had his wife insulted and father disparaged by Trump then how would YOU feel?
Hey, I live in Tennessee and while the numbers are low (lower than 2016) it’s still startling.  Then there’s the house with the American flag...a Confederate flag, a Trump 2020 flag, a lawn jockey and a pickaninny statue... 😡
It’s true that Trump has given a lot of money to women but that’s just the result of lawsuits...
Yep. Everything has worked out exactly how you would expect if Trump was Putin’s puppet...
If you explain to people Hanks was a pedo and everything else he was... Then everybody would except the truth... Who is in charge of these clones? Trump. .
The CDC and the American Association of Pediatrics has said its safe for kids to go back to school. And obama is the one that built the cages and deported more people than any other president. Trump fought for better facilities during the shutdown, but dems resisted.
They are MORE than wasting their votes. They aren’t allowing themselves to be as politically aware as a responsible person should (and Trump sucks).
Or maybe they wouldn’t help Trump get re-elected...
For the rest of the year y'all kneel for Trump before every game i want to see this start now.
In reverse order, name 5 things that scare Trump
They thought Obama was the anti-Christ and Trump is the second-coming of Jesus... 🙄
Trump is winning in November
I agree. Bush and John Kerry were in the skull and bones society. You can tell the establishment hates Trump bc of all the hate they push. Hillary was part of the establishment, can we agree on that?
I think you can say that Trump has done a lot for Trump...wait...is that the same person? I get so confused with that second-person thing...
Yeah...that’s a problem. This is Trump’s army for hire paid to beat up non-supporters.
We have four more years of safety then Trump is gone but he can't hold off all that evil by himself .
Trump 2020
You wonder why the establishment hates him. President Trump signs Executive Order to lower drug prices! This includes Insulin and other drugs that are sold for much lower prices in other countries than within the U.S.
Trump will probably move the convention to Alabama and get people sick there...
Yeah...I definitely hated Trump even back when he was a Democrat.

He did a hell of a lot better job than Trump ever would, or could. Rand Paul needs to go home and stay there !!!
I can imagine Trump driving the Lex Express.....
Someone has stolen his phone, no way Trump wrote this.
Trump cares for BLACK LIVES bc he is sending police to stop the killings of POC in Chicago! Too many POC are killed in Chicago everyday. BLM doesn't march for these people.
Yes they have. Trump even did an executive order on police reform. There are many tweets about George Floyd from Trump on here. Pelosi can't even remember his name!

He had Jenna Jameson in his promos and she's a crazy Trump bootlicker as well. Last year I got into a straight up argument with her cuz she said Trump had higher approval ratings than Obama. I told her she's just pissed Stormy got to bang Trump before her and she blocked me.
Well sweet cheeks it’s called taking out the trash.. do you really want murderers running around your neighborhood where your kids play... trumps apparently got a better plan than lightfoot as she’s doing nothing to stop/slow the craze.. not a trump fan boy but common sense shows
What is up with the older generation messaging me out of the blue to tell me "If Biden gets elected the world is going to end"? I'm increasingly convinced these ppl are just trying to validate their own support of an immoral and hateful man 😂 #Biden #Trump
It came from China. Pelosi is calling it the Trump virus. That is absolutely false. I don’t understand why Dems hate the truth and facts so much.
Stir the pot!  His JOB is to protect American citizens and when those in charge put citizens at risk in the name of politics he HAS to step in. Obama turned a deaf ear to the pleas of his city, as did the last 5 presidents. Trump actually cares. I hope he goes into Chicago.

We’re all used to Adderal Trump, this is #PrinceValium #BenzoTrump
Only because Trump is calling anti facism - facism and people are believing his crazy!
People become all "Holy Cow Batman" when Trump does some outrage. Calm down, he does that crap on purpose and he lives to stir the OMG kettle.   His day; watches Fox "news," does his hair and make-up. Gets cranked on Adderall. Goes out and make a fool. Enjoys the meltdown.
That’s exactly what it looked like to me. That’s Benzo Trump!
Apparently it hasn't occurred to any of you media people that maybe the video about witches and demons was a joke. Maybe the people who made it wanted to see if Trump would fall for it. You people are taking it seriously just because he does.

Just say no!!!! BBC News - Donald Trump suggests delay to 2020 US presidential election
Too bad the vaccines will not be cleared for distribution until WAY after the US election. You lose Trump

My thoughts also. Trump is there to act outrageous. The real puppet Masters remain behind the stage
President Trump is going to win the election!
Just like Trump, he knows nothing.
Donald Trump is a desperate man therefore he should be given Das boot from the presidency a.k.a. 25th amendment what are we waiting for?

I think Trump’s should fire Fauchi and replace him with her.
why is Reality Winner  in jail without a fucking trial I know the answer and so do you! It’s because Donald Trump is guilty as fuck for treason and why shouldn’t the American public charge you as an accomplice?
On a day when so many pay tribute to John Lewis, Trump has to be sure it ends with the focus on him (even if most of us don't want him/won't watch).

And everyone said Obama was going to try and give himself another term using Marshall Law. Right now, before our very eyes, Trump’s using Marshall Law in various cities and now calling to delay our elections. He’s doing everything he accused Obama of doing— in plane site!

Wrong. The US soldiers o have spoken with are pretty upset with Trump. The to has loved ones and family affected by his lack of leadership.
Why would you believe he actually means that. It’s his cycle... media talks about how scared they are that trump will do “certain thing” trump suggests he will do “certain thing” media panics and bad mouths him and then never does it.... it’s 🤯🤯
Yes, leadership matters, that is the very reason that I will vote once again for Donald Trump! You complain about 150000 death but neither you or Creepy Joe can provide a better plan.
NEW:  President Donald Trump is for the first time floating a “delay” to the Nov. 3 presidential election, as he makes unsubstantiated allegations that increased mail-in voting will result in fraud.

I feel like Trump bout to scam the whole USA 🙃 ion know how but it’s gone be some bull shit.
He doesn’t care about the constitution, he stomps on it daily. All he cares about is the law of trump.  #Trumpstitution

STIMULUS CHECKS: President Trump says he wants the next coronavirus relief package to be "very generous" with direct stimulus payments to Americans that are potentially more than $1,200.
The presidential election cannot be delayed without congress. Would have to clear Democratic House first. Even if delayed, Trump/Pence term still expires because of 20th Amendment: “the terms of the President and the Vice President shall end at noon on the 20th day of January.”

I agree with you. Trump didn’t make that call, nor did he try to. Trump was against the Middle East wars. It’s very public and not hard to find.
I just want Michael Avenatti to be Attorney General for one or two “Scaramucci’s” just so he can make Trump have an aneurism 🤣 it would be the ultimate payback!

TROOPS WITHDRAWN: The US is moving forward with President Donald Trump's plan to withdraw nearly 12,000 troops from Germany, a decision that has attracted bipartisan congressional opposition and roiled key allies who see the move as a blow to NATO.
U.S. Rep. Clyburn sent letters to Tennessee Gov. Lee and Georgia Gov. Kemp seeking documents on recommendations the Trump administration privately made on the states' respective COVID-19 surges and whether the states followed them.
K! Thanks for the invite, but I'll be passing the Indian woven basket to collect donations for the Trump Campaign. If you can have a gathering and  can't, We'll politely intrude on your rally &amp; intercede with Pro-Trump! #ThanksJoe #WWG1WGAWORLDWIDE 🇺🇸😉🇺🇸
Trump's goon squad. BTW  Martin, how are you feeling these days?
NEW: House Speaker Nancy Pelosi will require that masks be worn on the House floor after a Republican member of Congress tested positive for COVID-19. The member, Texas Rep. Louie Gohmert, often shunned wearing masks and was known to vote without one.

Are you also upset with  for saying that Covid was nothing to worry about while encouraging people to come to China Town cause the virus can't be spread by human contact as she called Trump a racist for shutting down air traffic from China? No it's all Trump. Right?
Can't wait to vote for  President Trump on 11/3🇺🇸
You and President p-grabber erect straw men, knock them down and try to tel us how great you are. You care NOTHING for the state of TN, only about your daddy, Trump
You are so ridiculous. You have your nose so far up Trump's rump (that's a good nickname for you btw) you can probably tell us what he had for lunch
Biden isnt able to speak without a teleprompter. Dude is literally only able to repeat what he is told to say. Not to mention he literally has implemented racially motivated laws. Trump has deregulation things to allow people freedom. Trump took palm beach to court because he
Trump’s deployment of feds to American cities is a continuation of bipartisan police repression. But make no mistake: he’s also tapping into the darkest corners of far-right authoritarianism, which seek to stamp out the radical “enemy from within.”

This guy just blocked me. He went on and on bashing Trump. Saying Trump praised a sex trafficker. I responded and you support creepy joe. I was blocked hahahahaahhaah guess truth hurts

FAUCI DISAGREES: Dr. Anthony Fauci, said Wednesday that trials have shown "consistently" that hydroxychloroquine is "not effective" in treating coronavirus. President Trump since deleted a video with a doctor claimed that it is a cure for COVID-19.
That, and maybe Putin detailed his planned invasion of the Ukraine. Trump is anxious to build hotels there.
You can retweet MAGA bullshit all you want Trump is never going to be your friend.
Censorship is done by the government. You've been in public office long enough to know that. You're just playing to the least informed Trump sycophants.   If you don't think private property or orgs. can censor their own domain, let me know when I can put some signs in your yard.
A vaccine is the only thing that will save your bacon Mike, and you and Trump know it.   Not gonna happen.
Would love some Evangelical Christian who is voting for Trump to reply to my tweet trying to explain why you're still voting for him, when he has no concern for human life that isn't at least middle class.   Also, r e d l i n i n g
It is important for Conservatives to remain at war with the greatest threat to democracy since the Civil War. Fight on against Trump and Vichy Republicans.
We won't let him? We are determined to vote Trump to the curb on November Third
So, Trump is the president only of well-off white ppl, not the rest of America. Is anybody surprised?
We have the best President in America we have had in decades.  Stop listening to American Trump hating media.  And CNN is Democrat propaganda and on the left, as is MSNBC.  We live here, you don’t.
Nobody knows about taking advantage better than a Trump.
This is also related to a narrative intentionally started by the right, that Trump was "never given a chance from the start." He doesn't realize how much some us have had to bend to even call him the President. Ugh!
NEW: The Trump administration wants $377 million in the next coronavirus relief bill for a long-delayed modernization of the West Wing, but the timetable for construction is yet to be determined.
Something Trump and Barr made up with fake evidence because he's scared he's gonna loose and go to prison for reason.
I've been a suburbanite my entire life. Contrary to Trump's dog-whistling, to me suburbia mean green lawns, not white faces. The more diverse the community (ethnically, culturally, economically), the better. We see his racist actions &amp; tirades for what they are and are disgusted.
Trump can stick it where the sun never shines.
Couldn't agree more?   Vote Trump the mud on November Third !
have you ever talked to someone on the phone, and you don’t know them, but they just sound like trump supporter?
Trump will bow and go DOWN!
The companies face legal and political offensives on multiplying fronts, from Congress, the Trump administration, federal and state regulators and European watchdogs.
NEW: Rep. Louie Gohmert, R-Texas, tested positive Wednesday for the coronavirus, forcing him to abruptly cancel his plan to travel to his home state with President Trump aboard Air Force One.
President Trump opposed the loan in May unless USPS raised the prices it charges Amazon for parcel delivery.
You’re calling people crazy the same fucking jerk off nut face who said to fucking inject disinfectants fuck you trump
Trump is a modern day segregationist in the model of George Wallace, Lester Maddox et als.   I wonder how the history books will explain how the country went from a competent, popular African American President to a bigot.
#Collins remains a #Trump stooge. Hopefully #Maine voters kick her out this fall. She’s been a failure! Served only one master — ⁦
UPDATE: President Trump again on Wednesday defended his decision to promote Dr. Stella Immanuel, who pushed hydroxychloroquine as a cure for the coronavirus.
NEW: President Trump dismissed Democratic demands to include aid for cash-strapped cities in a new coronavirus relief package and he lashed out at Republicans, saying they should "go back to school" if they reject money for a new FBI headquarters in DC.
Russian oligarchs. Putin's puppets, and the ones most likely to have something major on Trump. Calling Putin could be considered a direct line to those oligarchs.   Why did Trump order his recent conversation transcript to be hidden?
I’ve never felt more unsafe in my life as I do now with Trump as president. His reckless comments and criticisms make him the #1 Bully in the US.  We are more divided than ever in my lifetime. We have never had the amount of chaos that we have now. It is literally in every state.
Do you presume the angry anti-Trump mourners actually want Trump attending?  Every eulogy is going to contain vicious slander against Trump and his supporters.  Even John McCains daughter used her podium time at Daddy’s funeral to swipe at Trump while praising her father.
The Speeches at the funeral will consist of hyperbolic anti Trump screeds anyway. Why should he attend and present himself as a target?
Trump was not the person who FORCED covid patients into the HOMES of the most vulnerable people in the state. NOTHING the president has done comes anywhere in the same galaxy as 'close'
Making threats of a seize on an American City is or should be an immediate cause for the 25th amendment. Laws must change as to how the people can deal with a lawless president. If we don’t we will have another Trump.
Tough! The virus happened on his watch which made it his responsibility to do all he could to lessen its effects.   He abdicated all responsibility early on. Because of him our country is still stalled at "go."  Vote Trump to the curb on November Third.
It’s just a never ending grift for Trump and his wealthy friends. It’s staggering how much money has been “given out” in one way or another to the 1%.  Most of us can’t cover a $400 unexpected expense, yet obscene amts of $ is being stolen.
Lmao, darn... He sooo wanted to fly on AF One with Trump today. Now he needs The Treatment! Best rest &amp; bleach
Just another way he intends to determine who lives and who dies. If you don’t support him you die. I can see it now, the Administrator of the Hospital comes in, before we can give you this life saving drug, do you support Trump?
Ex-CIA director Brennan writes in upcoming memoir that Trump blocked access to records and notes - The Washington Post
Do executive orders now   This will be seen as a huge win for Trump.  And this should kick Congress into action to steal this win from you on these egregious abuses by Big Tech.
You did your best to get an answer but this trump guy was scared for his job.
Or if Trump loses in November does Haggerty have a game plan? Can he think for himself?
This along with Trump’s lack of dealing with Russian bounties on American soldiers shows his utter incompetence. I doubt he even consulted his NSA or his Joint Chiefs of Staff.  He is giving Putin everything he wants. #NATO #TRE45ON
Trump dismantled the pandemic response plan set up by Obama, not the WHO, not China, or any other country. Trump also cut funding to the CDC leaving them less prepared for a pandemic.
Good point, Trump should absolutely refuse to communicate with the members of our duly elected legislature, that’ll teach everybody.

There’s an end in sight.  November when when we reflect President Trump and kick all the Dems our office.  America needs to work not taking handouts.
Many in the mainstream of this country musicians, actors, politicans(both sides), business people are involved with sex/child trafficking and trump has disrupted that. Look into Gitmo. Obama all but shut it down. Now its rebuilt and looks like new... wonder why... hint hint
I'm voting for Trump no matter what.. How about you?
Trump was universally loved until 2015 when he wanted to run for president. He was in movies, hip hop songs etc because he was the "goal". People aspired to be him. Since he was elected he wanted to rid the world of sex/child trafficking and that's why the MSM hates him.
NEW: Spurred on by President Trump's demand to pull troops out of Germany, the U.S. will bring about 6,400 forces home and shift about 5,400 to other countries in Europe, U.S. defense officials said Wednesday.
I've got an idea to help pay for the cost of the pandemic. How about we charge 100 bucks a pop for worldwide pay per view when the military has to go drag the Trump grifter family out of The White House in handcuffs after he loses and refuses to leave office. I'd gladly pay it.
His presidency is like the first stage of grief. We’re in never ending denial.  When a loved one dies it takes months to wrap your brain about that but eventually you do move on. Not with Trump, we can’t move on.
If you want to talk policies of what trump/pence vs a biden/harris campaign will be I'm game. You say when.
She also says that endometriosis is caused by sex with demons, the government uses alien DNA to make vaccines, and that vaccines are being developed to make people less-religious.   Another valid and trustworthy source on public health brought to you by Donald J. Trump
yes the same one who is convinced that the government uses alien DNA in our vaccines, and the one who thinks vaccines are being developed that make a people anti-religious.   Seems like a very valid and trustworthy source for public health info! Thanks again Trump 👍
Pres. Trump's painting a dystopian portrait of what Biden’s America might look like, saying crime would ravage communities if he wins the White House.  Left unsaid: A recent surge in violent crime in several American cities has happened on his watch.
Use it. Sorry but I thought you were a trump bot

From one Irishman to another: Trump is probably WORSE than he appears to be!!  But more importantly, Rory Gallagher was incredible!!!😎😁
President Trump's visit to a U.S. fracking hub on the West Texas plains comes during the state's fierce coronavirus outbreak and a global oil and gas glut that is putting the squeeze on his loyal donors in the petroleum industry.
Trump,  I think realizes we’re at an impasse. The wall around the WH is going up for a reason. I think he believes we will become so incensed at what he’s doing we will come for him.
UPDATE: The Trump administration has started talks with the Oregon governor’s office &amp; indicated it would begin to draw down the presence of federal agents sent to quell 2 months of chaotic protests in Portland-if the state stepped up its own enforcement,
You asked him 3 times if trump wanted to stop DACA. This acting liar never gave a straight answer.  Typical administration BS.
FYI yes Russia may “have things” over Trump but mostly Trump sides with Russia because that’s who he is. He’s a traitor and sells to the highest bidder because in the end it’s all about destroying USA for the grift. That’s it he’s a common thief.
Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden slammed President Trump's handling of the pandemic Tuesday, &amp; he pushed back against claims by the president's campaign that he condones violent protests against law enforcement.
Where’s the part of the Consititution that says this is a Senator’s top job?   “I think the very first issue is supporting Pres. Trump. That's the big issue here in TN. Folks in TN — want a senator that's going to support Pres. Trump.” -
This may be the first accurate portrayal of
What do you think Barr is investigating? Obama illegally obtained FISA warrants to listen to the Trump campaign. If Trump were  doing this to Biden right now, you would hit the ceiling.
You'll have to argue that with the medical pros, but why would the FDA revoke it's approval as a CV19 treatment if it was beneficial and the risks were tolerable?   I don't believe in conspiracy theories, including the one about Trump having a financial interest in CQ.
You believe that they are baseless because you only listen to one side. Be objective, open your mind. Get past your hatred of Trump. If laws truly matter over politics, you might find some interesting perspective

“But not only is COVID-19's mortality rate not as low as Trump has claimed; this study proves there are far more consequences of catching coronavirus than just dying of it.” #WearAMask 😷

I can almost believe in the demon sperm when it comes to Trump, there’s no better explanation for him. #TrumpDemonSperm
I am no Trump lover, let's be clear. Beating him in Nov is a layup for Biden, but the Dems will somehow find a way to fuck it up.
I think it's worse than that.  knows exactly what's going on because it's his party that's perpetuating the violence and division. Ironically, Joe is blaming Trump for the actions and manipulations of

150,000+ dead, a 1000 dying each day...  Now tell me about all the wonderful things trump did for America as this virus rages on.
I'm surprised Trump hasn't whined that he doesn't have a rainbow over him
It has been a relatively active morning on President Trump's Twitter feed, with him retweeting several tweets (more than a dozen) in rapid-fire fashion, plus this:
Have we not found a cure for the diarrhea that comes out of tRump’s mouth? Maybe that hydroxychoriquin can help him with that 🤷🏻‍♀️ #DumpThetRump
I wouldn't be surprised if it is as simple as Trump tripling down. Mary Trump said that being wrong in the Trump family is the same as death.   What a horrible world Donald Trump lives in. I will be so glad when we can all leave that world.

He’s willing to sacrifice a percentage of kids to please Trump and open schools. Not willing to postpone till cases stop daily increasing-often doubling in TN.
Any primary voter who voted for Trump has to live with their own conscience. But media including CNN gave him priceless free coverage when he was still a comic sideshow.
Oh I get it now. You call me out I apologize, but now you want to Trumpaphize. (Preach the gospel of Trump and Barr) no thank you .

Joe Biden is on his last leg. Let the man have his retirement in peace. He is obviously mentally deficient.  Do a cognitive skills assessment, publish it, and move on to a more viable candidate for President Trump to actually debate.
It's a cheap drug that's out of patent you can buy 100 for about $37.00 - there's no money to be made there IMO.   I think Trump's fascination with that drug was based on early reports that it could be an effective treatment, which would benefit him politically.
Sorry June, but you have Dr King's message wrong. He wasn't all about "dignity culture". Go study his message a bit more.
Yea, just like McCarthy knew what communist ment in his context.   This is literally the same shit as Trump classifying antifa as terrorists.  You should call your guy out on this. It's setting a dangerous preseden.

🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 Russian collusion was debunked by the Democrats who investigated it for 2 years, spent hundreds of millions of tax payer $$ but since you have nothing else you gotta go back to old talking points. Oh and I didn't vote for Trump. But I can see what's going on.
EXACTLY! I just don't understand why they can't see Trump is the best ever. He's honest, mature, loving, oh just perfect in every way. TRUMPS FOREVER!!
Just another opportunity for you haters to trash Trump.  None of you at ABC or any of your watchers care about a cure.  Some of these loons saying "WE" were prepared.  No, you were not.  You don't know anymore about this stuff than anyone else so quit pretending like you do.
Because they're Trump supporters.
President Trump sent troops to Portland to help control the riots and violence that have shaken the city for 2 mos. The United Nations told him he can't do it! Who's behind the #riots? How will the US will lose its sovereignty to the #NWO?
Unfucking believable! Trump spends the people's money like it was his. We, however, will most certainly pay. National debt: 25.5 trillion dollars and rising exponentially.
Nice to see a Trump treated like the rest of for once.

A non-biased tweet would read: “A week after projecting a more serious tone, President Trump is now making claims that an anti-malaria drug is an effective treatment &amp; challenging the credibility of the nation's leading infectious disease expert.” Please proofread before posting!
YOU ARE CORRECT! NOBODY LIKES YOU; BUT I THINK “HATES YOU” WOULD BE A LITTLE MORE ACCURATE OF A DESCRIPTION 🖕
President Trump has a Mutual Fund, that fund invests in many things. One of them actually makes generic HCQ. Big deal. The estimate of what profits he’s received from that portion of the fund is under $500.00. HCQ is extremely inexpensive, get your facts.
Twitter has already deleted my retweet of this news conference as "in violation of Twitter standards."  I guess their standards allow the potential deaths of thousands -- all because Trump has endorsed an inexpensive answer to a difficult question.  #NoSoupForTrump
Trump is doing what he excells at...  Bankrupting America. Our national debt is 26.5 trillion dollars and climbing exponentially.   VOTE Trump to the curb on November Third

So you therefore think you can assume anyone who seems well adjusted and happy is suffering from Stockholm syndrome only because you despise conservatives?  In this case only because you despise the Trump family?
Also, the information that Donald Trump Jr. shared was accurate. It wasn't misinformation at all. Here's the source so that you can correct your mistake:

It was the Democrats that established the “three strikes” laws that sent people to prison for life even if their third crime was stealing a pack of cigarettes.  Hillary amd Biden were supportive of that.  Trump has gotten those people out of prison and is working to free more.
So you are saying that Trump should send in the troops to put a stop to this? You people are all over the place.
Before or after Trump turns the military on us?
Obama set the Federal agencies against political opponent Donald Trump.  The paper proof is being released, item by item.  He set the IRS against the Tea Party and the Intelligence agencies against Trump.  Swallwell is even praising Obama for having done so, saying it was needed.
I think often about what a post-presidency Trump will be like with his access to the media and his devoted base.
Trump basically ran what he expected to be a losing bid for the presidency in hopes of building a media empire to rival Fox News.
Can you blame them? After what they’ve seen with Trump and him not getting the popular vote they probably think it doesn’t matter.
Funny that their counter protest to BLM is always “Trump 2020” and “blue lives matter” ... Thanks for more evidence that Trump, his supporters and the police system are racist.

1) Under the 20th Amendment to the Constitution, which was ratified in 1933, the president’s term “shall end at noon on the 20th day of January.” At that point, if he has lost the election, Donald Trump would no longer be the president of the United States. Period.
Instigate riots and protest to spread the virus to use as political warfare against trump. There is no low the Democrats won’t go to win.

Why I quit watching fox is things like  saying trump is behinds in Texas...
If Trump pulls off a win in November, expect the media hysteria over the pandemic to continue and, perhaps, even translate into a newfound fear of seasonal flu. Fear will be their perpetual goal. If Biden wins, different story.

Have their issues. Trump thinks he’s above the law. Taking people’s first amendment rights away. He worries more about monuments of dead people than he actually ever cared about alive people in the US. He thinks his team succeeds if 200,000 people died.

He’s also a dumbass because the only thing his campaign talks about is trump. Couldn’t tell you what his stance is on any major issue lol
It's good to see Democrats starting to distance themselves from the riots (two months in). It's a sign they don't have the narrative under control, which means, of course, it's time to blame Trump.
...our federal government has fallen down on a responsibility more basic to its function than even the military defense of our land.  So, thanks again, Donald Trump.  Am I sick of all this "winning?"  You betcha!
We might have been too stupid then, but those 200 Fed judges plus 2 Supremes taught us better.  And I hate to break it to you, but Biden is the republican in this race.  republican.  Small "r" as he believe in our republic.  Trump wants to be a dictator.  Always has.

It doesn’t matter whether or not Trump accepts the election results. In January, John Roberts will swear in the winner. Period. During the swearing in ceremony, if Trump loses, movers will have gone in &amp; cleaned everything out &amp; set the Bidens up. It’s done. Period.

If it came down to resignations. Trump is more likely to step down so Pence can pardon him. He’s much more concerned about saving himself than saving the RNC. Forget Nikki Haley.
He didn't, because he's a republican.  So is George W. Bush.  And Bill Clinton.  And so were Reagan and George H. W. Bush.  All republicans.  republicans.  Small "r."  They believed in and pledged to defend our republic.  Trump is not a republican.

There are few things that depress me as much as the realization that many of the adults who taught me values in my formative years have been willing if not eager to cast those values aside to excuse Trump and other conservatives.
Are you suggesting that we wouldn’t have had COVID-19 if Trump had not been president? Wow! Lots of implications there! lol 😂
On January 20th, 2021, Trump's term ends. He will have zero power to do anything. If he refuses to leave, the military will escort him out immediately under Biden's order. I think it is more likely he flees the country because of the avalanche of lawsuits piling up against him.
This was a peaceful protest until tRump's secret police showed up and started snatching people off the street.
But it IS tRump's America. How can anyone blame Biden, who hasn't taken office (YET!), on people protesting tRump and his insane policies?

President Trump,  Could we cut the unemployment benefit by $150 and extend it? But take that $150 and use it as an incentive for people to return to work (for those who can)? Just extend it long enough for unemployment to drop to normal percentages and lower covid rates!

You Democrats that think Trump is “Putin’s puppet” are going to be amazed when you see what  Ventriloquist Vladimir can do with his dummy Biden.... you’ll swear it was Joe talking!
But what this demon fool #TRUMP doesn't know we the young will stand in the cold,with our very old sitting in cars, until one of Us the young or mid-old can step into that building, then let the very old come vote before Us and we the young &amp; mid-old will come behind them voting.
Why everyone hating trump he doing the best he can
Her rant today about Trump not accepting the election outcome was her giving him DIRE Warning!!!! She looked ridiculous😩
Don't close down, just don't agree to be part of the mail in Voting System, b/c my friend #JoeBiden is gone fix the Postal service,ya'll will take AMERICA into the new decade. Just refuse to be part of the mail in Voting System. This way ya'll will smack demon #TRUMP n his mouth.
Elizabeth Warren is on the warpath! She thinks throwing down the Tomahawk on Trump will move her up the totem pole into the VP spot!
Demon #TRUMP attack the Post office b/c this how he's planning on corrupting the mail in Voting System. He will attack the Public Voting System by trying to get his followers to vote twice, through mail in and Public Voting. Our Voting System must be prepared.
Anyone else?!? Just me?!? #tRump
Voting System leaders,demon #TRUMP is going to rig the mail in voting system&amp;the Public Voting System.This is why the GOP is trying to overtake the United States Postal Service.Wakeup Voting System leaders.Voters make sure U are Prepared. Voting System leaders Prepare yourselves.
People n AMERICA, get ready demon #TRUMP will have his followers mailing in Votes and then going out Publicly Voting. #TRUMP is going 2rig the Voting System. So he can make the mail in Voting system look corrupt, at the same time trying 2make the whole Voting system look corrupt.
Jussie Smollett Mattered Bubba Wallace Mattered Tawana Brawley Mattered  Bernell Tremmell  DOESN’T MATTER He was a Trump supporter  He was murdered He was REAL IT HAPPENED IT MATTERS
Guess Russia will be very happy that Trump stopped Germany from paying them millions!  Putin will be so pleased with that loss of income he’ll, probably, give his puppet an award!
The demon doctor, demon #TRUMP chose to believe, instead of a educated sound minded scientists, who have worked with many epidemic.
get your stuff pack, b/c we are going to send you Packaging home with your demon boss #TRUMP. You eat his from his fruit of the vine, so you should ride that vine into retirement. Bye bye
It would have been,  had Trump not been elected.
I will try, but we may want have a functional economy. The Bible tells us no day is promise, with #TRUMP lying using witchcraft doctors, GOP leaders trying not to help the Citizens. August is almost too far away to buy a ticket and use it.
So, I guess you would rather that Trump win &amp; GOP win, because you know they will continue to gut the ACA, not to mention further pack the courts with right wing judges.
People n AMERICA, who should we believe. #A #Dr_Fauci or #B #TRUMP #T_Party backed #Witchcraft_lady=#Doctors. Pick People n AMERICA, #A or #B.
what about #Dr_Fauci or #TRUMP *lady Witchcraft* doctor. Who should Americans believe.
No! What should affect demon #TRUMP re-election is knowing we have a President that's compromise by Russia.He's willing 2Close his eyes while Russia put bounties on soldiers he command. He turns his back on the Country Allies. So why would Americans Voters, Vote for a traitor.
What little that I was able to make myself watch of that made me so angry at the disrespect that they showed AG Barr. He is a true gentleman that showed what lying assholes they all were. They only convinced more voters to vote for Trump because their true colors were showing.
I think we know what trump and putin's phone call was all about.
You have that Right President Trump!
The ones responsible for the deaths are the Democrats who let the violence happen and protected the murderers, looters and arsonists.  Trump offered them help and they refused.  Do you think we don’t see what is going on?
She is one of the Tea Party People doctors. This is why demon #TRUMP says even the Bush People believe in these doctors.
This is the whichcraft doctor woman demon #TRUMP says the tea Party People under Bush administration took advice from.
So now we know why demon #TRUMP supported that black lady demon doctor word, demon #TRUMP saying Bush People believe in them, talking about the tea Party People.
Everything trump says is a lie. That’s all we need to know.
That, and because we have the Greatest President in our History with President Trump!!
I hope someone terrible slips through the net...Boris becomes more like Trump every day
First of all using the word stupid with this argument might not be in your best interest. Secondly, Trump’s style is not anger and lack of control but rather humor and wit. Check the Trump- HRC debates, they’re hilarious. Once again, Biden’s handlers will never let him onstage...
Christians ✝️ look at this mess, ya'll know as followers of Christ, we are not to dab in witchcraft in anyform, b/c it dangerous and uncontrollable. This is why demon #TRUMP call Jesus weak.
Demon #TRUMP shows Us the American People, he will dabble in witchcraft, just as he believes in this witch doctor.
Hydroxychloroquine is a relatively cheap generic drug made by multiple manufacturers all over the world. Trump isn’t promoting it to make billions of dollars off of it. It’s just another Us vs. Them nonsense war like canned beans to him. It’s a loyalty test.
People n AMERICA, their are real evilness in this world with People of all walk dealing in witchcraft. The Holy Bible teaches us to not play with this evilness.
Christian leaders know this is Witch Craft. The Christian Bible tells us to stay away from this wickedness, this could be the reason why we have this Virus.
People n AMERICA, demon #TRUMP gas always dabble in witch craft.
How can we as Americans not be outrage, that demon #TRUMP is letting our Military troops become  big targets to killed.
Demon #TRUMP says he never saw the Intel reports,but his own intel agency says,the report on Russia paying bounties to have Americans soldiers killed,was reported in the intelligence briefs,letting demon #TRUMP know about the situation and the Intel info did reach his desk.
Oh yes they have know that the patriotic people of America love this President and they are trying everything to get rid of him their producing riotshas only helped President Trump even some dems are now voting for President Trump they don't want to see this country go socialist
Oh man and it’s so packed now that they bully sky rise condos and more high end shopping all on or adjacent to Hillsboro Rd. I miss going to Trump’s and getting my hair bashed around tho. They were great. Just too much traffic.
The thing is that for the DNC, the only objective is protecting their revenue stream from their donors.  Effectively, this means the main objective was just to stop Bernie.  They picked their most corporate-friendly choice and beating Trump would just be a coincidence.
People can you believe that these demon nature GOP leaders put monies in their Coronavirus package to benefit one of demon #TRUMP Hotels.
Trump stewing is over again and again and again
Barr is just as guilty as Trump regarding the rule of law and he knows how to evade answering direct questions!
If you think Biden and Trump are equally bad for our country, then  I cannot support you, but I will say Sen E. Warren was my first choice for President!  If we elect Trump we can say goodbye to our Republic and the Democratic Rule of Law and hand the keys to Putin!
You can be trump’s friend...
Yea and that’s a matter of opinion, but I think Trump needs to refocus his attention to the stuff that truly matters in this country. His approval rating compared to any doctor should be pretty low on the list in my opinion.
Republican Convention..... Have an auditorium. Trump does televised Rally, Social distance with look-alike Democrats in seats... Pelosi, Biden, Schiff &amp; Nadler... that clap &amp; give standing ovations at his every word! Wouldn’t that be fun?

Demon #TRUMP lies when he says, he's taken Hydroxychloroquine.
That's one thing demon #TRUMP you are correct on, we will have a good economy next year, b/c you want be in the Presidential seat.
Watching Democrats trying to take down Trump... is just like watching the Coyote after the Roadrunner.  Every time the Coyote thinks he’s got him in his clutches... the Roadrunner outsmarts him!
Don’t get your way impeach or try to make people quit, I wish I cld have done that when Obama care was forced on us, meanwhile you morons were trying so hard to impeach trump while COVID-19 started instead of protecting America and then you blame trump for COVID-19 #ridiculous
It’s a BAD tactic... BAD for Democrats  Great for Trump! 🇺🇸trump2020🇺🇸
We are being lied to about real treatment plans for #COVID19. Social Media outlets don’t want the truth to be told because it does not support the discredit Trump narrative
Do Presidents usually appoint their enemies to serve them? Democrats seem to be making a point of Trump appointing friends?  Are they mad Trump won’t hire them?
It will still happen at Belmont. The governor will see to that if his master, Trump, tells him too.

A doctor Trump retweeted or endorsed says that’s what women do- have sex with those demon spirit men in their dreams &amp; that’s why they have yeast infections or whatever. It’s not actually YI, but it’s something similar
To ALL Rioters, Democrats &amp; Soros.... THANK YOU for the footage that will be used to Re-Elect Trump! Such a gift! Democrats STRUGGLE with words &amp; definitions like LEGAL &amp; ILLEGAL, PROTESTERS &amp; RIOTERS...bless their hearts!
Our Democrat leaders need to raise their Voices, take the damn lead making him answer the damn questions, instead of letting him talk that bull shit trash, Barr knows about #TRUMP tweets to Roger Stone.
Why the hell are Democrats SO WORRIED that Trump “won’t leave office, peacefully”? Is it because HRC &amp; Democrats didn’t? Are they worried karma will bite them in the ass?
Just another trump lie. (It's difficult to tell when both are liars)

Because President Trump said it works and they are so blinded by hatred they are grasping at anything to speak out against him!
Do the Brits still have that giant floating Trump baby blimp? We could use it right now. #TrumpIsASillyBuffoon and #WhinyLittleBitch!
Trump is a disgusting man!
Huh? So only experts, doctors and the like who vote the way you like and/or that say they hate Trump have an oppinion that should be discussed. That’s a recipe for disaster. The only way for extensive research is to hear how people have successfully treated patients &amp; research.
There are no words...this is what we’ve come to?
My feelings also. That’s why I’m voting Trump.
Trump has to tread lightly here. No one in there right mind is taking Fauci’s vaccine. But the left is looking for any crack to spread false narratives. It’s a chess match. Luckily, we’re playing morons.
And...  the plot becomes more stupid! Leave it to baby trump.
“If you have a problem figuring out whether you're for me or Trump, then you ain't a woman.”

Now, I've seen trump and even Mitch on video promoting mask wearing. I wonder how that's making trump's legions feel. Are they even getting it, yet?
You are correct. It's not that hard to figure out who is telling the truth here. The scientists' predictions are coming true. Trump's? None are working out. None. Remember, we were going to all be in church by Easter? Hmm...
This demon holds a Bible in his hands,that he doesn't understand or believes, b/c that bible says forgive your enemies,love them as God love U.This demon #TRUMP stood before the World between Heaven&amp;Earth. Now he makes a statement&amp;refuses 2do GOD will. He shows,he's a hypocrite.
People n AMERICA, #TRUMP holds up a Bible &amp; in that Bible it says to love your enemies, Jesus himself said on the cross just as that cruel soldier perse him in his side, he ask his father to forgive them for they know not what they do. But demon #TRUMP call himself a Christian.
People n AMERICA,this statement #TRUMP made shows he has no empty in his soul,it shows he's missing the most cognitive skill of them all,knowing right from wrong. No matter how U feel about a Person.U must have respect 4the departed. To demand respect &amp;honor U give respect&amp;honor.

Just another trump lie. #TrumpVirus
I wish all of my followers would cut and paste this and tweet it out right now:  JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
I doubt it. A lot of really conservative evangelicals put stock in Trump because Pence was 2nd in line. When Trump actually won the electoral college, they so much enjoyed seeing the media lose &amp; get bullied that their allegiance to a “winner” had been solidified
Maybe I need to send it to Trump!
Said by a Trump supporter! 🤣
Lisa supports all democrat candidates accused of sexual assaults, harassments and violent rapes. She spends her day on twitter finding people to harass who like Trump or may have said he’s better than the devil because she has a “life” and “heart”. Haha
Trump should not send Feds to Dem cities. He should take a page out of Soros handbook. Form a task force, round up rowdy, patriots &amp; freedom fighters, join with locals and send them in to run those hoodlums outta town...problem solved!

I didn’t agree with him politically, but I never doubted his humanity. I understand the criticism of Trump for not attending, but I’m glad he skipped it. His presence would be an affront.
Well Trump has done so much on his own, even w/o some GOP help, you know those swamp RINOs, but I can't see where the Democrats have done anything for America except sew division &amp; encourage riots in minority communities across the country.   Blue Koolaid will kill you. 🤪
I prefer to call it Covid-Dem because they were all in denial when Trump was talking about it in the SOTU address + acting racist by instilling a travel ban.  Pay attention dweeb.
Mr. Cain likely contracted the virus that killed him at trump’s death rally, &amp;  still hasn’t seen fit to offer a single condolence. So shameful &amp; tragic, all the way around.
Herman Cain passed away today form Covid. He advocated for not wearing masks during the Trump campagin rally in Tulsa.  May his family find peace during this hard time.  Covid is real and denying it and it’s safety…

Without a mask  "But it is not known for sure where Cain, chair of Black Voices for Trump, was infected. He had been on a whirlwind travel schedule in June, stopping in multiple cities."  If he was already infected I hope the people not 6' away are tested and OK.
Sad news.  A victim of  narcissism.   Trump's News Source:    "He was admitted on July 1, two days after being diagnosed with COVID-19.  Ten days before, Cain had attended a rally for President Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma."
Only 59 more days for the Biden camp to find a way NOT to debate Our President Trump!!!....
I’m old enough to remember when Fauci said the Wuhan Virus didn’t pose a threat to the US, and that Trump’s travel ban was unnecessary.
No...The election date is set and folks are preparing to go to the polls. Trump is just afraid of the very public butt kicking Joe Biden is going to give him.
Susan Rice, what you showed in the Benghazi massacre shows how you work under pressure. You want to be VP. Susan Rice or not everyone will lose if Joe Biden wins in 2020. Mostly our country. Vote Donald Trump 20/20 to save our country.  🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲

People know who Trump is. They either like him or they don’t. No advertisement is going to change their minds.
Conservative thinks “this is good because Israel is good.” Liberal doesn’t really think about the specifics of it but instead just says “but trump is hurting our status abroad! He works for Putin” and that’s basically it.  Neither one thinks “what’s up with all the israel stuff?”
Problem is we have a lot of just stupid Democrats in these blue states. 80% of these blue voters are in the big cities. They have out numbered rural America. We all must get out and vote for Trump or civil war will be here fast.
Can you imagine how batshit lame duck Trump is going to be after his humiliating loss on Nov. 3rd, but two months before he has to leave the White House?  174 days 18 hours 2 minutes from now.
kim it's not ok. Biden will never debate Trump.
Trump goes everywete not becuse a state might go purple dumb ass people have no clue
Democrats - Wuhan Virus isn’t threat to US. Also democrats - Trump’s travel ban is racist! Also democrats - Trump’s virus!
No, you're not heartless. You're just pissed, like the rest of us. I wouldn't lose any sleep if every one of those GOP bastards choked on their own phlegm... except for Trump. I don't want him getting any pity points. Let Nero keep fiddlin' 'til the election.
Thank you Deebs! You are wasting breath conversing with trump suptrs. 😂😂  No individual thought only pied piper mentality.  We must pull together to remove the biggest threat to our democracy we have ever faced.

Presidents since Washington have sent federal agents to cities across the country. Kind of shows you how stupid Democrats are today. They want to change the names of military bases. They ought to change the name Democrats to liberal pansies. Boat Trump 20/20. Save the country.
Every Democrat has been a total ass. AG Barr has been steady and truthful, but he is not allowed to even speak while the left make this about President Trump.
This is what constitues as a "win" this deep into the Trump presidency.  Let that sink in.
Getting Trump out wont help much if we cant get the Senate back as well.
Yes.  Donald J Trump

This administration has done so much to challenge and tear down processes, institutional norms, etc that if Trump wins again we won’t recognize this country. I don’t mean to sound gloom and doom, but these people want to rule. Not govern. Just look at COVID response.
Yes, same here. But I also can’t watch, Trump, McConnell, or Devos. They are lying so much that the “look” they put on their face to try and hide their lying gives me the “creeps”
Biden is lying about President Trump. Obama was one of the most racist presidents. Obama caused all this hatred towards police officers and caused the division in this country. Obama did nothing to improve the lives of minorities and he kept them in bondage to the government
Again Biden and Democratic Party lie about President Trump. He is the only President that has improved the life and job status of all minorities. He is the only President that has not done identity politics and does not pander to any one group. He has improved all lives
Your cast of characters started out wrong. Antifa=anti fascist. You called them a fascist organization. The fascist is Trump.
I don't think Barr or Trump realizes what they're doing. T/American revolution happened because a whole country was financially abusing its pple. T/Civil war started because t/south didn't want to go t/North's way. People aren't just going to sit here and take it#BarrHearing

What is sad       is that there are more minorities in this painting than in all four of these images combined:  I have spotted a pattern!    Count the minorities:
*Republicans surveying the country, see anarchists toppling statues and courthouses, Trump down double-digits, tens of millions out of work, social fabric fraying*  "Hmm yes I've figured out our election strategy. We're gonna cut benefits to the unemployed by 2/3rds."
This will be the democrat strategy for ducking out of the debates. They will never allow Trump to embarrass Biden...which everyone knows is what would happen.
What is Donald trump knows Covid really isn’t that life threatening and that why he’s forcing schools to open to show us that everything’s okay. To then slowly start to uncover WHAT THE ACTUAL ISSUE IS!!!!  Sex trafficking, Pedophilia, Adrenachrome, Fetal cells... SO MUCH SHIT.
Trump to snub John Lewis memorial service. I guess he's working on his fastball for that Bunker Bitch First Pitch moment for the upcoming game.  Oh wait...   Maybe Malaria's Rose Garden "renewal" will include a major league pitching mound so he can practice.
One simple thing to do to maybe try to tone down the 'Trump is racist' narrative, and he chooses this option. Telling.
The riots will continue as long as the election is up for grab wake up people that's why the Democrats are letting them run a bit they think and probably true that people will vote Democratic because Trump can't stop it unless he declares martial law which also would hurt him.
Yea, and you know some contractor got paid $$$ to build that. They built it cheaply for show not for strength. The contractor got rich and I’m sure some of the $$$ was siphoned off back into Trump’s pocket.

And the left claims it has only gotten violent because Trump sent in agents after 50 days of riots. The only thing that changed is officials started calling them riots after agents got there.
This is war. We should take all the help we can get. Defeating Trump and his GOP allies is the only thing that matters.

Well, that's possible. For people who are 12 or younger, Trump is most certainly the best president, it's probably the same for people who are even older than that.

⬇️⬇️ tRump is and has been a willing participant in the "parties" hosted by Jeffrey Epstein and #GhislaineMaxwell for years, along with #princeandrew, and our very own FLOTUS #melaniatrump  We can only imagine
Who gives a shit if DeNiro moves to Italy that prick said he was going to move because of President Trump was elected president he didn’t leave then why believe he will now
Joe sniffing hair publicly makes the claims against him much more credible. He's openly pedophillic and perverted, Trump is not. Biden's actions make claims against him much more credible.
That actually wouldn’t surprise me. As much as Trump is hated by people that have close proximity, I’m surprised there hasn’t been an attempt on his life. Secret service must like him.
Yes, Ms. Haley, Donald turned our economy DOWNWARD, and destroyed our foreign policy. If you wish to kowtow to Russia, then I am sure you ARE happy to support Trump’s policies of treason and corruption.
Pharma stocks fall with Trump set to sign executive orders targeting drug prices
ICE agents do no see themselves as civil servants constrained by the law and the constitution, but as modern day Knights Templar in Trump’s holy war against immigration. They will literally do whatever they can get away with.
Please God let this happening at the Yankee game Trump is going to. Please.
But at the same time Trump says parents should be able to have school choice???  So Democrat CDC about stepped into it, paving the way for it and had to back off the fear tactics. Funny how that works.
Bet Trump won’t throw his that far.
Trump will tell you what you need to know.
And if you don’t plan to vote for Trump but don’t vote for Biden, or you would vote for Biden but are too lazy to make the effort go to hell.
But Donald Trump is President now🤷🏽‍♀️
The Americans people are sick and tired of the democrats trying to find something President Trump did wrong. When I first wrote this Twitter changed democrats to the people Twitter is so bogus
No they aren’t. They are afraid if they really challenge Trump in anything (like Dan Rather did yo Nixon) that they will loss “access.”
WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO SAY? 8 TONS is a whole lot of Chinese Goods bought by tRump Organization "buy american"
Can you with Trump?
YES WE DO OR OUR DEMOCRACY WILL FOREVER BE LOST. THE UNITED STATES DOES NOT NEED A DICTATOR ( DONALD TRUMP ) THIS MAN IS EVIL &amp; VERY SICK UPSTAIRS!!!!!!
You don’t need Trump, your citizens are terrorized already. Do your damn job.
Also in a further shift in tone Trump wishes alleged sex trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell "well" (twice) after being asked about her case.Nah.  People are responding to tweets re: the Maxwell documents saying Trump is one too. He ain’t. I felt like shouting it for all to hear. Haha
DONALD TRUMP IS NOT A PEDOPHILE
Trump has a consistent MO: Commit crimes with your buddies, but keep your ear to the ground as law enforcement closes in, then turn a rat to satisfy law enforcement with a few prosecutions, and in the process get your own butt off scott-free.  NOT THIS TIME
it’s not an incident, but a pandemic situation spiraling out of control due to several poor decisions made by THE PRESIDENT. trump is one person, but he‘s the person responsible for the American people’s health and safety. and he’s failing.
the protests are 1) outdoors, and 2) necessary to evoke change. trump rallies are neither.  also no one said that people didn’t catch the virus at the protests.
Who is the ignorant one 🤔
We gonna find out (Volume 5, anyone?) that, in the Trump presidency, it's blackmail all the way down.
So, if Trump blackmail  to be his legal attack dog, we really supposed to doubt he would blackmail Justice Kennedy to retire by threatening to indict his son for Deutsche Bank?
Big OOF Hutchyboi. Daddy Trump ain’t gonna like that. You done GOOFED.
You mean to tell me all of  legal theories in support of Trump haven't been genuine but have been blackmailed out of him? NO!
Some things you say have merit. There are some evil bastards in government. That I agree. Trump's working hard to eliminate as many as he can find. The Deep State is huge and Trump's finding these scum. He has annilated most of the FBI's leadership and most at CIA. More remains.

You say that before you realize that Mueller witness George Nader, the convicted pedophile, donated to BOTH Trump and Clinton.
No one believes you. That is the reward for attaching yourself to Trump.
Possibly the only hope of normality here is if a critical mass within the GOP decides not to take Trump seriously if Biden wins and he refuses to concede. If they won’t fight his civil war with him, I doubt he can create a groundswell on his own.
But Trump's Twitter account lets him reveal and incriminate himself every day, so...
I bought n95 mask, paid to much,but wanted to make sure I could go out and vote, I would walk on glass and threw fire to vote for anyone other then Trump 😷😷😷
lewis &amp; others are nonbelievers because trump said so. he ignored briefings and thought covid-19 would go away. he continues to not wear a mask and has no real plan for handling covid.  the covid-19 situation makes trump look bad, so he denies it. his followers drink the koolaid.
I'm Democrat and I want to go to the polls, so I don't know where you are getting your information from. If trump wants to delay the election than great. Then as another post said we will go by the constitution, but then again if we did that then the election will not be delayed.
As Maria Butina's lover and CEO of Overstock Patrick Byrne said: Political espionage against both Trump and Clinton. Clinton knew the election was rigged, but didn't challenge the results because of what the Russians knew about Bill.
Give loyalty to the serious folks, real journalists, folks with proven track records, stay hopeful but realistic and fight like hell in every way u can to defeat trump, just don’t fall for the divisive distractions.
rolls. The game plan is, gain legitimacy gradually over time by criticizing trump, maybe one account is cynical, the other wildly optimistic, but then in crunch time, with election looming, start bickering amongst themselves to sew discord among the left/ Trump’s enemies.🤷🏻‍♂️
uh there are definitely many trump supporters who think the pandemic is a hoax and that most reported coronavirus deaths are fake.
The trump vaccine for the #trumpvirus
Well that and Biden doesn't even tweet. The one Trump account is definitely him
Honestly kinda hope President Trump wins just so we can all scream “rigged!” &amp; ask him how come it was “rigged” if Biden would win but fair if he wins. Can’t wait.
There is nobody else to vote for. Trump Jr 2024
yeah, you were the one wearing the vagina hat and whining about Trump's morals. that was you. I'm sure of it.    I gave an example. where's your rambling tirade?
I ain't never cared for TRUMP. I just think they all in bed with each other and in the end its all about their agenda. Left Wing or Right Wing its still part of the same bird. I just want what's right for people and those who in office don't care about us at all.
She blinked once right at the beginning and that was it!
LMAO. I can't stand him and I definitely don't care for TRUMP EVER!!!
I checked the timeline. Herman Cain went into the hospital about 10 days after the Trump rally in Tulsa. Cain died of the #TrumpRallyVirus
The only proven examples of this were corrupt Republican candidates. Because the  is a crime syndicate and the Trump family is going to jail in 2021

I agree and I don’t say that lightly. The rehabilitation campaign he’s undergone post-presidency has been a case study in our short collective memories. Again, just better than Trump isn’t the bar we should be setting for aspirational leadership.
You could say the DHS office is the Donald Trump of the American intelligence world.
GDP drop to a number unheard of! Another 3 million claims in unemployment! My best friend three year old niece died! All because of Trump!

We don’t worry about them now, especially when you have a staff person write and post them for you! It’s nice to have a transparent president that writes his own post like President Trump.
Stop gaslighting. He recovered from cancer a decade ago. His own website said he was in good health. He went to a Trump rally mask-less during a Pandemic while being in a high risk group, because you and the MAGA crowd made common sense political. RIP

Trump will never be 1% of the man Obama is. Never.
The conversation about Trump not leaving office after losing the election is stupid. I mean dumb as hell. If it's that difficult to figure out what to do, this country is a dayum illusion. If his own party doesn't go in and escort him out, Biden can get crew together to do it.
Trump haters think they have the moral high ground even though they are spiteful, petty, deceitful and violent. They don’t.
You really think if Trump is in office four more years Black life will fair better? It’s crap! Under Trump it’s crappier and will be crap for ALL!   GOP seizes opportunity under Trump and is reversing all little gains Blacks et al accomplished. Least we get to fight another day.
The GNP is dropped more than any other time in HISTORY—32.9%. Ask trump and his drooling minions about that!!!!
And in the last year... 7,200 Pennsylvanians dead. 12.5% unemployment in Pittsburg alone because of a botched Pandemic response by Trump/Pence.
Both equally. I think Cain wanted to be a loyal republican &amp; trump was willing to take advantage of that, all the while knowing that Cain was a cancer survivor with a compromised immune system. Trump should have counseled his entire staff to stay at home if they were compromised.

The protesters all wore masks, and studies have shown that those protests did not cause outbreaks.   Trump's Tulsa rally was a super spreader event, however.  Trump's staff ripped social distancing stickers off seats and didn't wear masks. Fucking morons.
The last time I checked voter fraud is a republican practice.
If Trump supporters are willing to let citizens die from a pandemic virus with a significantly higher death rate, perhaps they will let our democracy live despite this fraud rate?

Cain was hospitalized with #covid_19 shortly after being photographed maskless at President Trump’s Tulsa rally.
That Trump stink never washes off. We'll remember in 2024.
Watching Trump today proves that he is certifiably evil and monumentally stupid.
George W Bush has class and dignity enough to eulogize a man who refused to go to his inauguration in protest of his election. I don’t think Dondal Trump would do the same. Of the former Presidents he by far has the most grace.

As soon as enough Trump zombies tell him they love it he’ll be claiming it again.
Actually fracking died months ago with low oil prices. Trump does have a clue. Fracking is the most expensive way to get oil and low oil prices killed it, along with all other oil production in US
Fracking is already a dead horse. It’s expensive way to pull out oil. Low oil prices killed fracking a LONG time ago. Tell Trump that his buddies Russia and Saudi Arabia killed American oil.
Even if cancer was n remission, it &amp; the plethora of chems would still have ravaged his body &amp; weakened his immune system. I hope his passing is a strong message to those in similar situations. I still blame Trump however 4 manipulating people to go against their better judgement

A Trump Disaster.
Wait, so, Herman Cain beat stage 4 cancer, and still went to a Trump rally, during a pandemic, without wearing a mask? 🥴

Trump floats election ‘delay’ amid claims of voting fraud
If Trump really felt the overwhelming pressure that he would be indicted after his presidency on numerous federal charges, there is only one country in which he could flee.  And they are our #1 geopolitical enemy.  That should tell you a lot.
Trump wants to delay the election. That proves he didn't pay attention in 12th grade civics.  If he delays the election? The Speaker of the House becomes the interim President.   God he is so fucking stupid.
Yes vote Biden 2020 and get rid of traitor trump

Herman Cain was grinning like a possum at Trump’s death rally in Tulsa
Always blame Trump...Herman was a big boy, making big boy decisions! Great man!
GOP Senators had Trump in their hands, #IMPOTUS45 They let him off the hook. #GOPGenocide #GOPCowards
People trump is trying to control our tweets and the news today he does this craziness to distract us keep your eyes open he is again trying to hind things
Herman Cain has died of COVID-19 after attending Donald Trump’s MAGA Campaign Rally in Tulsa. I am offering my deepest condolences to his family here in Memphis. We lost a trailblazer today. #COVID19
That's a great dream. How about organizing something. A few months before the national election is a bit late. Your 3rd party vote this election is a defacto vote FOR trump. No other way to see that, except in your imagination.
Then we need to revisit 2016 election results. Trump may be illegitimate based on your distrust with the USPS.
I wonder how long til Trump Covid Hoaxers start saying that Herman Cain was actually in the secret Muslim Brotherhood with Obama and that he really died of something else?
😆😆😆😆 #Trump beat the leftist to the voting day question ... #HairOnFire 😄😄😄
Please pursue defunding or freezing funds for these out of control goons!
Trump Administration Submits Petition To FCC In Bid To Prevent Online Censorship - Conservative Brief
Long-term killing of the environment and extinguishing life on the planet aside for a moment, this tweet is ironic given Trump's plan for the past 6 months has caused an economic meltdown, record unemployment 150,000+ deaths while holding mask-less rallies with deadly results.
And so begins the coup. What remains of the American republic is at serious risk.
Trump floats idea of delaying the November election, a power granted to Congress, as he ramps up attacks on voting…
Jason, I have a long list of words for trump. Words my mother would not approve of at all.
The GNP dropped 32.9%--the worst drop in US history. THAT'S what trump does not want you to focus on. That's why he floated this stupid election notion.
Herman Cain had terminal cancer. Immunocompromised people are more vulnerable. He knew the risk involved- but keep following the script and blame Trump for everything.  This pandemic is a governmental failure across the board - at every level. Local, State &amp; Federal all failed.

No. Ignore it. Don't even begin to let Trump litigate the issue.

Sad he had to lose his life.  The lesson is that you take guidance from competent people.  Another one for Comrade Trump #150,001

Trump floats November election delay - but he can’t do that #SmartNews   Put him in a rowboat off Puget Sound bound for Vladivostok, with a cache of frozen Big Macs, and tell Putin that his new butler is en route, ETA “not soon enough.”
It's really sad to me that Trump supporters care more about $$ than they do actual lives. Herman Cain just died of Covid 19 after over a month in the hispital. It's very possible he contracted the virus at Trump's Tulsa rally, where he was pictured not wearing a mask.
Trump is serious. Believe that he is serious and act accordingly.
Donald Trump just suggested the Presidential election be delayed. Do you agree with this?
I loved Mary Trump’s book. She even gave us the name of the man Trump paid to take his SAT test. #TrumpIsANationalDisgrace  #BenedictDonald
I’m confused, I didn’t think President Trump wanted to follow CDC guidelines?  Why the change?  I thought he knew better who to combat this virus?
Yep, he caught covid at that Trump Tulsa Oklahoma Event after saying he wasn’t going to wear a mask. He died today...
As long as Trump is gone on January 20th, they can delay the election to January 19th for all I care.
"trump doesn't have the authority to delay the election! it's in the constitution!" yeah and we all know that this administration would never do anything unconstitutional! stop fact-checking and start demanding resignations.   do your fucking jobs.
Herman Cain died today of complications from the coronavirus. Remember, he and 6000 others at the Trump rally in Tulsa, most not wearing a mask?  This virus is real. Stop playing with it.  For the love of God please wear a mask 😷!
trump suggested delaying the 2020 election because of “mail-in voting fraud.” if that doesn’t terrify you, idk what will.
Another ass-kissing tweet by Turley. It was clear back in April and before that Trump planned to impede a free and fair election. And confirmed again by Trump’s tweets on 7/30.

Can you believe it’s only year 4 of trump? It feels like a fucking lifetime.

It's the Economy, stupid
Cain was hospitalized at the beginning of July after developing coronavirus symptoms. He attended President Donald Trump's rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma at the end of June.
It’s all about trump. Everything to these people.
I bet Trump feels terrible about Herman Cain’s death.   Just kidding. He feels nothing.
He attended Trump’s Tulsa rally without a mask 😣
Anyway, all of this was predicted and predictable as early as 2015 just as it is being rightly predicted now based on Trump’s own words that he will try to stop/contest the election or refuse /question the result. Our checks and balances have mostly failed thus far; so.
What you guys talking about? Trump loves poor people. In fact he was poor before he got a small loan of a million dollars from his dad.
What does this have to do with the sick and elderly who weren’t at protest? People just be out here dumb for free because Trump said so 🤦🏾‍♀️
Just thinking about I how I begged my brother not to vote for Trump in 2016 because of all the quite clear signals of fascism and he literally said, “it’s not as if people in black vans are gonna snatch you from the street.”
Yes maam. After Trump was elected,  I thought about it All The Time... like damn *student* should've been the person doing all the media rounds, the expert on this, writing the book. But nope 😭
re: trump postponing the election  can he: legally no  could he: hypothetically, he would have to be willing to arrest members of congress to do so, at least to effectively get the second term, which is presumably what he wants  will he: probably not
As a co-chair of Black Voices for Trump, Cain was one of the surrogates at President Donald Trump's June 20 rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma -- which saw at least eight Trump advance team staffers in attendance test positive for coronavirus.  — CNN

John Lewis hated his guts and led the impeachment against him. Is trump supposed to be crying in the street?
No, the American population will speak by their vote, not the hacks of the Trump Abomination (Administration).  should realize that he does not have authority over this and needs to step off.
Herman Cain really died from catching Covid at that Trump rally in Tulsa????? Wow
so basically 21% of this handle’s twitter followers are Russian/Ukranian/Trump bots
Trump is a pedophile confirmed. Something something pizzagate etc etc
This Herman Cain news got me shook for real though... Brother was at the Trump Rally in Tulsa with no mask on! And caught it there- never recovered.
Oh yes they would have been different.  A LOT WORSE. HE called Trump a racist for closing border to China.
He got it after Trump's Tulsa really, right?
The incredible irony of the head of Black Voices for Trump dying of COVID.
So Herman Cain caught COVID because he wanted to own the libs by going to a Trump rally.  He’s dead now.
Not sure if you're arguing for or against Trump lol. He REALLY stuck his foot in his mouth now by saying it's not safe
It’s day 1287 of the hostage situation aka Trump presidency and he is trying to distract us from the economy by threatening the election date, flood your senators with calls. Get loud. #Resist
From April.   Trump has moved CDC reporting to HHS to control it.  "two deaths of children between the ages of 1 and 4, one death of a child between 5 and 14 years old, and 17 deaths of people between 15 and 24." - CDC
Trump killed that man but that ain't my business.
First question at the briefing tonight should be: "President Trump, if it's too risky to vote, how is it safe enough to open schools?"
Trump’s racist tweet about Obama’s birth certificate is what launched his political career, and now just a few years later, he’s trying to use it to make himself president for life.
What are your thoughts on  wanting to delay #2020election ?
Trump floats delaying the election, but he can't do that
Trump is now suggesting delaying the November election.  Politically speaking, this would give him a chance to try to bounce back the economy before voters hit the polls, as he’s now trailing Biden by double digits.  However, he has no authority to do so.
Until now I have been pretty confident that Trump was going to win again. I am starting to think there is a "silent majority" building that will vote for Biden instead of Trump and just not tell anyone. Even down here in the South.
I'm certain the methods he's used against American citizens exercising their rights in Portland, et. al., will be effective at flushing this turd  out of The White House  via

There is more involved than just the virus. Voter suppression, lack of voting stations in certain areas, gerrymandered districts. We want equitable and easy voting for all Americans. Trump is afraid of that.

Rocky, The Terminator, Chuck Norris, Donald Trump. All cut from the same cloth.
Would folks in the CIA understand his references to the "invisible enemy" as a reference to them since they are widely known as the "invisible government"? Would this be Trump himself signalling or would it be his foreign intelligence handlers signalling through him?
I need some input from intelligence professionals on this, but am I crazy to think Trump may be sending coded signals to the FBI and the CIA? Would folks in the FBI understand his constant references to 1917 as a reference to their counterintelligence division?
My Suburban Lifestyle Dream would be to move to Terre Haute and live next door to the prison there where Trump would be incarcerated. I could put up a sound system and play "I'm In The Jailhouse Now" every morning for him.
Agreed part of freedom is the freedom to choose not to vote. People gave me so much shit for not voting in 2016 blaming Trump on me. I didn’t like either candidate if I voted it would have been Johnson or Stein anyways. My state is more red than Texas so not like it would matter
There was very fine ppl on both sides.  Trump was correct.  As usual.

This is simple.  The most liberal judges we have are Kagan, Sotomayor and Ginsberg. All appointed by Democtrats.  In the end you it is a simple choice. Do I prefer Trump or Obama.   That argument is not close.
what do you think about Trump pulling all of the troops out of Germany.  I mean, the war ended 75 years ago.  you people can't protect yourselves yet?
Cmon OAN. This is fake news. Why do you keep repeating it? Why are you so giddy to push the left’s narrative? The headline should read. “DHS and President Trump  is to keep federal police in Portland until the violence has ended.”
It's a ball futon for Trump.
Why do you suppose the violence and etc..is happening continuously...the left and mindless demorats....easiest way to destroy the country and blame President Trump... Same for the crazy spending called stimulus...will give them more reason to raise our taxes...

Aren’t you worried Trump is gonna read this?  He reads more than anyone ever has in the history of the planet.  I mean he’s probably reading anytime he’s not at his one, or maybe sometimes 2 or 3 meetings a week.
You have no evidence to prove that because Trump stopped the policy where he had to report🤷🏿‍♂️
Smart of them, but what a mess if something happens. However it should be placed on the Democrats head because they are the ones who’ve created this situation. We all know that the Democrats are already preparing the spin machines to blame Trump. Prayers for the country 🇺🇸🥰🙏✨

I do believe trump has had the vaccine since day 1 which is why him and his family haven’t had it and he will pull it out to save himself the presidency
So Pres. Trump is pulling all these troops out of Germany, and a significant number of them are coming stateside. Do you think he hopes to use them for putting down BLM protests or for suppressing democracy come election time?

Job 1 of the next US President will be to try to repair the damage done by Trump to the western alliance. I suspect it is too late.  Won't be long before Putin starts trying to exert extra influence on his western border to push limits and norms.
Depends. Was he shunned by the family?   Lewis never paid Trump or Bush respect while he was living. i heard he told his interns to 'never be bitter' while he remained bitter. He stayed in congress to enrich himself not the neighborhoods and ppl he passionately claimed to ❤

Recodify and ban drilling in national monuments. Create an intelligent plan do deal with environmental issues. Fund green projects (all renewables). Undo the myriad of Trump initiatives dealing with cities and mass transit. End holding federal funds hostage.

So, Cohen handed off his phone and its info to the Flynn Intel Group so they could take it to Prague and use its info in concert with Russian intelligence to silence Trump's victims. Remember, the rape accusor Katie Johnson says she was threatened. Russian thugs?
As far as the question goes of whether Michael Cohen's phone went to Prague, I have argued they were finalizing in Prague a legal agreement in which Trump would drop the Magnitsky sanctions if sex trafficking charges were withheld.

That’s rich coming from the most partisan corrupt divisive man in the Senate! Where you been Mitchy! Dems have been waiting for you &amp; you’re still trying to screw Americans! How many bills do you have stored away, voting rights,Election lnterfernce, covering for traitor trump!
Moscow Mitch and all of the GOP trump enablers are clueless because they are blinded by their ideology and corrupted by money. Hey, Mitch, STFU!
Shutdowns, economic crash will/is be blamed on Trump. Mail in voting, potentially no debates. The pandemic is fully weaponized at this point aimed at the president
FIXED IT: President Trump’s racist regulatory reform will set back progress for everyday Americans!
Why would the United States of America w American values bend over to aid Russia, do NOTHING to stop Putins bounties on the lives of our soldiers&amp; allow them to mess with our election! 🤔 U just accused google of treason w China🤔what about trump’s treasonous behavior?
TikTok is a national security issue, so I get that.  And yes, Trump is my president the same as Obama was my president. I haven’t moved .
Second Stimulus Check: Donald Trump Claims Republicans and Democrats Are 'So Far Apart' on Another Payment
Can MS Obama please be the VP just for a little while? Maybe a year or two? That would seal the deal for Biden. We can’t take chances now. Trump and the  are going to cheat. 🙏
Just read of trump expansion of dictatorial power grab in more cities.  Without double checking bet all are governed by democrats.  America be warned. Trump is attempting to take over as dictator with unlimited power.  ALERT!!
Yes, no blacks. Trump says “I am happy to inform all of the people living their Suburban Lifestyle Dream that you will no longer be bothered or financially hurt by having low income housing built in your neighborhood.”
“The hard truth is that Trump was not exceptional. He was just another amoral Western businessman, one of many whom the ex-KGB elite..promoted and sponsored around the world, with the hope that they might eventually be of some political or commercial use.”
#SCOTUS recently upheld the Trump administration’s broad exemptions for employers w/ religious/moral objections to covering contraception, as normally required by the #ACA.  David Slaughter explains what this means moving forward:  #HR #EmpLaw
On July 28, Trump again doubled down on hydroxychloroquine and cited Dr. Stella Immanuel, who believes in alien DNA and sex with demons. Even Twitter &amp; FB are taking down his dangerous BS. Yet this dangerous fool remains president until next January 20, in the best case scenario.
Trump admits he spoke to Putin but didn’t discuss the #RussianBounty on our troops &amp; immediately deflects to fake news &amp; China.  Imagine being in the military, putting your life on the line for this country &amp; hearing the President doesn’t have your back?!

So what if they kill America soldiers. They knew what they signed up for. (Trump’s words not mine) My kid made it out alive after 5 years sad to know our president could care less.
Do you support like your Republican colleagues and Trump elimination of the Affordable Care Act in the middle of A pandemic. Blackburn is on board. No replacemen!!!!!
2 people died with Ebola and trump has allowed 151,000 Americans to needlessly die from trump virus, 4.2 million Americans are sick and   40 million are out of work!  Zip it ass!!
I am critical of Trump but he has my vote.  I expect more from him and am still pissed at some of his weak moves.  But until Chuck Norris runs, he’s all I’ve got.
The Democrats will lose big in 2020.  Their insistence that there are no riots and the gatherings in Portland and Seattle are peaceful will scare most non-extremist Democrats who hate Trump into Trump voters.  It’s a clown world we live in.
Trump is on his knees for Putin-he’s terrified of Putin &amp; will defend Putin before America! Our soldiers have bounties on their heads &amp; trump doesn’t give a shit!👇
No it really is. Orange man says open schools, all the liberals scream to close them. Orange man says open economy, all the liberals scream close it. No school + lockdowns = crashed economy (blame Trump), mall in voting, no debates

Too bad you weren’t here for past 4 years.  Investigate Trump &amp; Impeach Trump is all the socialist Democrats and their media slaves could say or do. They would have more success investigating a dead mule.  The country is sick of it.

Let’s not mince words,Barr is a LIAR and he’s lying under oath as he parses his words!  asked if trump ever asked him to interfere in a case, could have been any one of his flunkies asking!Barr is Sly
Don’t remember seeing any redneck Trump supporters looting, rioting and burning the Courthouse but I guess that’s okay....
Twitter removes video retweeted by Donald Trump falsely claiming #coronavirus 'cure'
Social media explodes after Twitter temporarily suspends Donald Trump Jr.'s account
Isn’t this video of Trump’s America?
The video they are showing is Trump’s America....
EXACTLY!  To be honest, I think Trump is a pompous prick and never liked him. I never watched his show and always thought he had a punchable face.  BUT he has my vote for president because he is better than Biden.  He's done some good and a lot of bad, and I'll call him on all.
I have stated 200 times I am voting for Trump.  But to not call him out for his weaknesses would make me a simp like 95% of MAGA.
New York Yankees Reportedly Never Invited Trump to Throw First Pitch:
The lockdowns were never gonna be only two weeks. Trump kept extending it  I’m spewing facts and truth
Calling it for what it is.  He’s not the messiah. Trump is weak
trump and his enablers, especially bill barr, are a clear and present danger to our safety and security and GOP lawmakers are both clueless and corrupt. They are all destroying America in their desperate attempt to  retain power at the expense of average Americans. VOTE BLUE!

Trump ain’t doing shit lol
I’m voting Trump but his shutting down the economy was the biggest mistake in modern presidential history
Trump started the lockdowns!!
Trump shut it down in the first place and now his people are telling states to shut down again. Birx just told our governor to shut down bars. He said NO.
Trump supporters are too blinded by allegiance to admit that he started the lockdowns and is the driver for mandatory Covid vaccinations.  I’m voting for the guy because Biden BUT let’s be honest, he kinda sucks.
Yet the lockdowns are still here. Curve has been flattened.  Trump is weak
Has Trump called for 6 months lockdowns?  No, but his 15 day BS led to this.  Trump is either weak or dumb
Trump also said “15 days to flatten the curve.”  How’s that going?
Conservatives on here complaining about a forced Covid vaccine.   Who is the biggest cheerleader for a Covid vaccine?  Donald Trump.  Trump started the lockdowns and is the reason you’ll be forced to take a vaccine.
That's  Trump's answer to it will disappear one day. He's not very smart!
Bill Lee is as loss as Donald Trump. The blind leading the blind. He does not know how to fight COVID-19. Another of Tennessee’s people will get sick and a lot will die. It is truly dangerous to elect an unqualified person to lead our State.

Whatever happened to #FreeTibet? It’s funny, it used to be the lefty cool cause. Now it’s not just Tibet, it is Hong Kong, Taiwan, India, the Uighurs, and on and on. And all we get is crickets. Because orange man bad. Standing up against China does not have to = supporting Trump.
Is Covid is cured the country roars back and Trump gets re-elected.   Democrats don’t want a cure

For a Republican Party devoid of reason,integrity, honesty, patriotism, If Republicans had insight they would realize and admit trump is corrupt,  a liar, racist, a conman, a criminal and a traitor-forgot Sociopath!
Maybe he will actually do something?  Trump started the lockdowns, don't forget that when you put your mask on and whine about it. Now he is supporting masks with NO science backing it.  Trump is WEAK!
I am voting for Trump. The Cernovich comment was playing on my man writing himself in.  But Trump has been extremely weak on issues and quiet on matters that matter.
But....Trump is weak
The entire trump family is to e dead and don’t give a hoot!  have no taste but gaudy
Yet small business are still shut down and business owners are getting arrested.  Trump started the lockdowns. How's that curve going?  I am voting for Trump, but don't act like he doesn't suck. Biden just sucks more.
Trump can do a LOT to help prevent this.   Speak up against it is one.   But oh yeah, Trump kinda started the lockdowns with the 15 days to flatten the curve.  Has it been 15 days yet?  Trump is weak
America has everything to do with Trump. he can withhold Federal Funds or even just SHAME governors for doing this.  He's the fucking president.
Riots. Small Business Owners being shut down.   Federalism or not, Trump is WEAK!
And yet does nothing for this. He CAN step in and bring attention to matters.  But Trump is weak.
Actually this is Trump's America.  People keep saying this is how it will be with Biden. Well, it's like that now.  Trump is weak and is too busy sparring on Twitter to do any real work.   I am over it. Voting  2020.

You know Trump is going to blame you for the Covid disaster and replace you.
...did ...did you just retweet yourself... and comment on the supposed truthiness of your own tweet...? Compelling stuff, bro. But let’s be clear. There were moms and vets protecting protesting citizens from a Trump-sanctioned goon squad.
You mean the mayhem Trump is creating?
One word to describe trump and his GOP enablers’ management of their response to the Corona virus: LAME!
trump’s enablers on the Sunday AM news shows saying what happened didn’t happen, what they said they didn’t say, etc. GASLIGHTING BIG TIME BECAUSE THAT’S ALL THEY’VE GOT AFTER THEIR INCOMPETENT, POLITICIZED RESPONSE TO CORONA VIRUS. VOTE BLUE IN 2020!
Nobody builds a wall like Trump, for good reason
Allowing trump &amp; friends to get away with this is insane! All we get from Dems lately- lots of Yada Yada Yada! Must be something that can be done to STOP this!
1) Endless spew of manufactured or hyper-edited stories = enemy. Press’ fault not Trump’s.  2) Fed forces to protect Fed property &amp; civilians whose Mayors won’t protect them vs violent criminals ≠ crush dissent   You are clearly unqualified to run CFR. Resign.
Likely he is coordinating with Trump so he can distract from problems at home.
Total bullshit. If trump had done job at any point in the last seven and not actively undermined the science and health advisers we would not be in this shape. Even Italy got this under control. Zero leadership from our president. He still thinks this is a PR problem
George Washington never had a boat parade. He did however assault and capture airports from the British(or maybe the Canadians) Trump wasn’t clear on that point,

We believe in competence, embodied by one who will execute what he promises to try to improve America for all, of any background--so we'll vote for Trump. Despite what you state, the reality is Pres. Trump is a clear choice to pursuit of happiness. Biden=more taxes, less freedom
All of Milwaukee should vote Trump  in a show of solidarity that the evil fucks who did won’t win by killing the opposition. This should send a chill down the spine of anyone who feels our vote is sacred. #JesusMatters #RIPwarrior

The US government or Trump admin should look into outlawing, either by legislative or executive fiat, political activities of unions. Esp in business /social sectors of employment where political ambition disenfranchises the recipients of services that federal monies subsidize.
