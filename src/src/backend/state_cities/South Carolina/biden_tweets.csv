Ah the Russians the ones advising Biden to go on TV and speak off the cuff?
Nov. 2nd, 2020: “sources say Biden’s running mate might’ve been chosen”
Russia is telling Biden to go on TV and speak off the cuff.
There are many “cafeteria Catholics” out there.  If Joe Biden feels that the greater good is the Marxist takeover of America, then he’s singing the right tune.
Why didn't Biden supporters go with the 🚄 emoji instead of the drums?
US intelligence says Russia seeking to 'denigrate' Biden
My take is we might be able to move Biden left.  Trump is not moving left
That's fine, but they're a very small percentage of U.S. Latinos, and you're missing the broader point, which is Biden talking nonsense.
“I know Joe Biden’s heart, and more importantly, he knows us,” said Seawright, who is Black. “I’m happy with who I think he’ll be as president on the issues that matter to our community.”
“People are going to use this, particularly Joe Biden’s adversaries. Even those who are not 100% on board with Joe Biden’s candidacy are going to look for reasons not to support him,” said Antjuan Seawright, a Democratic consultant Biden in South Carolina
Anyone please explain Biden as choice to run our country?I have no idea  who thinks he qualified
Me too. The idea is "voting Trump out", but that's the wrong way to look at it. The election isn't whether Trump stays or goes, it's who should be President. And I cannot endorse Joe Biden or any corporate Democrat after what they did to Bernie and our movement.
Biden didn't promise that, trump just said he did, you know, politics
Top GOP senators give Trump the Biden probe he got impeached for trying to force on Ukraine
I see people asking what will happen between the election and inauguration when Trump loses. The answer is our worst nightmare. He won't even pretend to govern. He will make moves to make matters worse. His goal will be to leave as big a mess as possible for Biden.
Figured out a new plan for electing our president for 2020. Fight island Trump vs Biden to the death. Who y’all got?
He will do as much harm as possible to try to screw over Biden. He won't even pretend to try to do the honorable thing. It will be an all out forest fire.

No-one thinks Biden is in control of any of this.
The VP pick is a clear signal to the electorate of who the Pres views as torch bearer of the party with the possibility of being the next Pres.  Biden especially. He’s old and barely hanging in there. He won’t be a 2 term President. So yes his VP pick really matters.
If you believe that who you pick for VP doesn’t matter, you’re dumb.  Ex A: Biden. If he was never Obama’s VP, he would never have rode those coattails to winning 2020 Dem primary.  VP picks, while not determinative, gives whoever they are, high chances of being Pres. nominee.
No, but Biden sure is. It’s not Trump who said “You ain’t black!”
no it’s not. you’re taking votes from Biden, ultimately giving Trump the upper hand.
Hahahaha imagine being this bad at history and geography, all while defending Biden's racism. You should feel bad.
On the surface, I think you’re right here. But it’ll be interesting if the Senate flips Dem to see how much Biden tries to really raise taxes... to be fair, what he were to try on taxes in a non-pandemic world may be different than what we tries in this world.
Let’s talk about your comments that Biden will hurt God. How will that work exactly? Fireballs from his fingertips? Some sort of death ray from his eyeballs?
Surely you’re not suggesting that Biden is somehow better
Joe Biden hates this. 😡
Biden says he would stop border wall construction if elected president

She means Khive and Warren supporters. No-one seriously thinks Biden is considering Bernie or anyone close to Bernie as a running mate.
After the President’s attack on Biden’s faith, I think it’s important to look at how politics and faith blend. The idea that Republicans are Christians and Democrats are Atheists is absurd. The fact is that some denominations are very conservative. And others aren’t.
As a politician who has listened to pollsters for over 40 years, Biden absolutely considers the African American community a monolith to be appeased every 4 years and ignored the rest of the time.  It's what he meant by 'you ain't black" the last time he said something offensive.
Charlottesville, Donnie, Charlottesville. Sh!thole countries, Donnie, sh!thole countries. Central Park 5, Donnie, Central Park 5. Should I go on? Biden, ride or die.

I will vote Biden, no matter vp,  because anybody/everybody is better than the destructive corrupt person we have now.

Republicans push Kanye 2020. But will it really hurt Biden?
For the democrats 100% but I strongly believe two party voting is fucking our country. Trump and Biden are far from the best we have to offer from either party.
There wouldn’t be any investigations if the Democratic Party hadn’t won the House is 2018, no checks on Trump at all. I’m a conservative voting for Biden but I’m also voting dem down ballot.

Biden has no choice but to select a black VP candidate with all these foot in the mouth comments he keeps making about black folk smh.

Democrats: Trump’s a racist!  Biden: Hold my beer   November is going to be interesting.
So Biden is against God having guns., and if God doesn't give up his guns Biden is going to hurt him. Meanwhile Trump expects to win Thighland in a landslide of KFC chicken.   That's what I learned on Twitter today. 😳😳😳
Playing electoral defense, Trump claims Biden opposes God
So if Biden loses do you think liberals are going to blame it on bernie supporters again
I think a paragraph is missing. I.e. the paragraph that explains why Harris would bring you to vote for Biden and Rice wouldn't.   That part is potentially a huge part of the argument, and this piece just never made that argument.
People looked at us with straight faces and said Biden was a better candidate than Bernie. It’s funny, but I hope I’m still able to laugh about it on Thanksgiving.

Biden’s Racism Reminds Me of Al Campanis
Too bad Biden supports abortion.
You attacked Biden based on a 14 second video and just won't admit you're wrong.
So your defence of Biden is, "he's a racist, but that's better than a socialist"?  And for what it's worth, Biden's claim the black community in America isn't diverse is a textbook definition of racism.
Biden's whole campaign is predicated on the notion that a few of Jim Clyburn's cronies in SC, a state that hasn't elected a Democrat since Carter, spoke for all black people everywhere in America.
Karl Rove is definitely working with the Trump campaign. The lie that Biden disrespected black people is from his manual.
Cupp's a gettable Republican vote, if Biden chooses Kamala Harris as his running mate. She's not a Democrat. It's silly to expect Republicans to vote for just any Democratic ticket.

Maybe Meghan knows a vote for Biden - isn’t exactly a vote for Biden. Thus the delay in announcing his running mate.
the question isn't "but how can I justify voting for biden when he's not a great option? :/" it's "how many more people do we want to watch die?" how is this even a question?? "I won't vote because both guys are bad!" um, one of them wants to stay president forever. so...?!

One candidate spent a week trying to convince the country that the "I don't have dementia" test is really hard. Then went on an interview and couldn't complete a thought without large print anchor charts.  That campaign is trying to say Biden can't hack it cognitively.

My motivation is driven on getting Trump out of office. I didn’t vote for Biden in the primary. But he doesn’t have raging dementia. If you keep saying that, you’re only going to help him. 🤷🏻‍♂️
Biden doesn’t even know where he is.  I guess you trust someone so utterly incompetent to run our Great Country. Explain please
The move is the latest example of the pandemic’s sweeping effects on the 2020 presidential election.
He has specifically said that he's not going to say he'd only serve one term. And why would he? He'd be a lame duck before he was elected. Here's hoping for two terms of a Biden presidency.
I plugged the state odds into my simple SQL electoral simulation and it spits out 82% chance of Biden victory. But one of the flaws of my simulation is it assumes perfect correlation, meaning in a state of the world where a state with, say, 60% Trump odds goes Trump... 1/2
when did Biden say he’s announcing his running mate?
The former vice president, who is 77, also tried to turn the matter back around on the 74-year-old president.
Just saw MSNBC interview with Tom Perez.  Shown was a clip of Joe Biden saying “no I haven’t taken a test; why would I take a test?” No context given.  I thought they were talking about a COVID test and the we’re talking about the cognitive test.  Shouldn’t confuse viewers.
I wonder if Obama is watching Biden on TV, being unable to say "my mental health" in the middle of several broken sentences denying that he's in cognitive decline, and thinking everything's going to be alright.

Why should Biden debate him .. Trump doesn't need any help losing the election...he's doing a great job of it all his own.
This has gotten boring and redundant.  We will know soon enough.  Just stop.
I will say though that a GOP senate run my Mitch means Biden may not be able to get any judges in. And if we really want balanced government, we need some more moderate judges as the GOP has been adding theirs like crazy, some bad/questionable/some not.
One should not underestimate the degree to which folks like Rick Tyler who want a future in Republican Party politics don't want a sweeping Democratic victory this year. Which is what could happen with a Biden-Harris ticket.
Though I expect the presidential debates to be hilarious for a variety of reasons, including  would serve as a great contrast to the ridiculousness that's sure to come from Trump and Biden. I think we need and deserve that contrast.
Meanwhile,   is trying to push some new false crap about Biden. I guess he doesn't have any children. Or care about them . . .
My concern over picking Harris or Rice is that our country has a huge problem with black women in positions of authority. If Biden only has one term and they are supposed to be the standard bearer, well...racism and sexism are going to make this ugly. (1/2)

Hillary Clinton, in a more competitive primary in 2016, didn't give Bernie veto power over her VP choice. Biden didn't give him that on the platform. He's clearly not going to do it on his VP choice. But white liberal male reporters are going to white liberal male reporter.
The legacy of the racist, failed war on drugs. And Dems resoundingly voted to continue the injustice of this system. Biden delegates showing you loud and clear what they stand for as they continue voting and developing the party platform.
Lol, Trump just essentially reenacted segregation laws and you think joe biden is racist?
Joe Biden’s not giving Bernie Sanders veto power over his VP choice.
Biden’s against legalizing, the  is against legalizing, literally what the fuck I’m tired of this shit
A lot of people need a reason to vote for Biden other than "he might be less horrible than Trump." I'm one of those people. If he picks Tammy Duckworth as VP, I'm on board.
"Give him that platform" He already has The Platform. Biden is  talking from his basement and needs the exposure. If he can handle it.
Joe Biden nears final decision on running mate
“But Hunter Biden....”
No, Biden shouldn’t debate Trump! It will be a circus, Trump will claim himself as the best, #1 in every category and lead with false claims and misinformation. Biden will get exasperated trying to defend nonsence, which will appear as weak. Just not worth it!
I know where he stands. Still trying to figure out if you are still pushing Biden... Because he is not the answer for black america.
I am a Reagan Conservative and was a lifelong Republican but will vote for Biden because the GOP has abandoned the moral character of our nation.  I can no longer trust them to lead!
How about Iran Deal, spying on Trump with a false document for a FISA warrant, or Biden holding a billion dollars to get Ukraine to fire the investigation against his son? How much evidence do you need?
What has Biden done in 48 years lmao. I thought Democrats were against racism
The chart was exactly as Trump said. Told my wife it was a poor chart. But hey you can make a chart or skow data to get any answer you want. Just ask HRC what the charts didn’t show. You’ll wonder how Biden lost after the polled show he shoulda won w 99% of the vote but lost
Not trying to speculate anything but  had the 2nd highest support from the  behind Biden when she was running for President. She also visited South Carolina more than any other candidate. This is the state that propelled Biden to the nomination. 👀 🤔
Mitch McConnell has been more consequential in the last 4 years than Mike Pence.  Whoever is going to be Senate Majority Leader under a Biden presidency is going to have to be simply historic to move this country forward. We really need to talk about who is up to that challenge.
I'm voting for Biden no matter who he picks. I trust him to make the right choice.
No Biden signs in my heavily Democrat part of Columbia, SC. But, no Republican dare put a Trump sign out, either.
Why Presidential candidate Joe Biden is not denouncing this type of attacks on the police, rioters, shooting, burning, looting, etc! WHY??? And he’s running for president! I’ll be voting four more years! TRUMP LANDSLIDE 2020
But practically speaking Biden is going to need a Dem Senate to get judges appointed in this environment, I think. We’ll see. Maybe I’m wrong. Maybe Mitch would show some moderation.
One problem with this is the court. If Biden wins, and Senate remains R, McConnell can just refuse to bring any candidates to the Senate floor. And I sure as hell am not voting for Lindsey Graham. If it were a GOP House and Dem senate/Pres then maybe I’d be ok with that.
You go Joe this Republicans Ridin with Biden
joe biden tryna get us to vote for him like:
That's interesting. He and his wife have donated to Biden's campaign.
Biden becoming President
According to this story, Ed Rendell's dream ticket this year was a Biden-Klobuchar ticket because they would appeal to white voters.
Blacks overwhelming back Biden. As they should.
My guess is they need someone on the record because they can't write an article with just anonymous quotes. And this guy, who is obviously very far from Biden's inner orbit, is someone they know they can get a quote from.
WHO are these idiots running about creating public division about Karen Bass and Kamala Harris? Keep that shyte silent. We don't have to know how Biden is picking his VP.
Tbf though Clyburn is clearly much more loyal and did way more to help Biden win the primary. Kamala is acting like she's just owed this shit.
Would be hilarious if Biden appoints him head of the CIA
Oh honey. Keep beating the Hunter Biden angle. Precisely NO voters even care.
And impeaching Trump now is the best hope the GOP has of winning in November, since Biden has no response to an opponent who is also "anyone but Trump".
Biden struggled to find the right words to say his whole career. He stutters. Trump has always been well spoken. His decline verbally is dramatic, just over the last couple of years.
The Democrats aren't going to impeach because their whole election campaign is based on Biden not being Trump. They've got nothing if he's running against Pence and a GOP claiming it's returning to normal.

Joe Biden cannot keep it together long enough to make one complete sentence.
Have you really listen to or watched Biden?
Okay, u NEED to publicly apologize to Biden.
There's 0 chances of Trump winning 2020, even if Joe Biden runs out of his basement Naked!
For those that need to hear this: rich old white men should NEVER stand up and tell anyone how Black men should do (or have done) their fighting for civil rights. If Bill could shut up and sit down next to Biden, that would be great.
So the Biden campaign expects there will be a Democratic primary in 2024? Even Biden's own campaign thinks he will lose the election in 2020 or the country before 2024?!
I'm with you! Just call me and I'll be there!! If you want bells on my toes I'll put them bells on my toes! I'll do anything to get him the hell out of there! I'll even help disinfect the White House for Joe Biden! You know there will be some bugs left behind! The electronic kind
Love the idea that even if Biden wins 50 states and Trump concedes we'll still have like 3 months of lame duck where he'll absolutely just shoot RBG in the face and name Eric to the supreme court.
Either of the first 2 are fine. Harris went hard at Biden over bussing not sure if he will hold it against her.
Girl one of my coworkers legit said COVID will be over November 4th if Biden wins and masks are a way for the government to control us. I was like were you dropped on your head as a baby?? 🤦🏼‍♀️
We will accept ANY VP of Biden’s choosing. Period!

ARIZONA GOV to BIDEN: ‘Come on Man, Get Out of Your Basement Joe!’
Trump said Biden ‘hurt God.’ Biden has spent his life drawing from his Catholic faith.
Those close to Biden encouraging (or even allowing) him to speak publicly, staged as a potential pick for next president, are cruel human beings. I oppose most of the principles he loves.  He is no hero. Regardless, his interviews are hard to watch.  Biden is clearly not well.
Once again, foot-in-mouth Biden speaks and pisses off a whole ethnic community!

Joe Biden said a little while ago, he was looking forward to tromping Trump on stage in the debates.  So, lets have one before September 1.  BEFORE anyone votes!  Go for it Joe!
But the great thing about Biden is he has really good relationships on both sides.  And he’s not too vain to listen to people smarter than him.   And he is humble enough to give others  credit.   He knows how to bring smart people and experts into the room
Biden did not apologize. He revised and extended his remarks.

So selective religious sin is for Trump who claims to be Christian but doesn’t go to church except for photo opts vs Biden a practicing Catholic.    I have nothing against any religion.  I have issue with those that think their religion is better than others.  THAT’s judgement.
Out of over 140,000,000 people that over the age of 35... Trump and Biden are really the only two options that we the people could put forward as presidential candidates... 🤦‍♂️
YOU are the one pointing out which party has more athesist and shutting down worship which is about religion and not political agenda.  And yes, I’m going to point out his faults if he’s going to accuse Biden of not being religious.
Lol Biden what state are you in? Guam!
Once again at each phase the pundits under estimated African-Americans. Before it was Sanders &amp; Biden, it was black folk wouldn’t vote for white men. Younger minorities eventually supported the Dem nominee. In Georgia, the Dems exceeded the Republicans during the primaries by 24%
I guess you'd rather watch a Biden interview?? Where he constantly says racist things.  Poor kids can be just as smart as white kids- said Biden, if you don't vote for me then you ain't black- said Biden.  While Trump has done more for Americans than any president in the past
Why do I think this is a microcosm of the entirety of Joe Biden's presidential campaign?  "Earlier today, I fvcked up. But I didn't mean a word of it. So, trust me, don't believe a word that comes out of my filthy mouth, and know that I have your best interest at ... uh ...

This is a horrible take. If getting trump out of office depends on Biden’s vp pick for you, you are saying “eh, trump’s not so bad.”  People like you are a big part of the problem.
I am not sure how close it is, but I see some positive signs. For instance, my 75-year-old mother, who has never voted for a Democratic presidential candidate, intends to vote for Biden. She is not impressed with Lindsey because of his sycophant act.

Here's the link to the article and ... holy crap, man, please don't let this man be elected President.  It's not going to get better for him.
He would say the same things about Demings , Bass, and Lance-Bottoms if they were the favorites. No one who was already voting for Biden will choose differently if Harris is the VP. And she will be.
Omg, thanks Skinny, I forgot about young Dracula and the female embodiment of Botox.  Those two are the worst and laughing all the way to the bank as these Trumpers are grasping at the Hunter Biden straws.  The hypicroay is stunning.
If you vote for #Biden or any other #Democrats, #COVID is the least of our problems.
I hope not, I just hope those people are over confident that pedophile Joe will win and it all goes away! And then the unthinkable, TRUMP stumps Biden’s ass wins and we go after these traitors!

Biden should not debate this man at all
Honestly, I’m confused about this. . I’m not a Trump thumper by any means &amp; he can talk crazy as well but what in the world is Biden talking about? Why did he mention cocaine?? #hidenbiden
the joe biden hiding narrative from the trump campaign seems odd
So what will voting for Biden will achieve for Black Americans???
Hey mr. jack: did Biden pick Susan rice for his vp ? Lol this is gonna fun !!
Biden's policies make it harder for many black people to vote him. Biden want to give funding to the police. Not surprised at all.
Trump requires a MRI brain scan as well as Biden to end cognitive health issue once and for all.
Ride with Biden.
Biden should pause all debates until Trump releases his taxes. That’ll shut Trump’s mouth.
Biden has a history of prevarication. Anyone who believes Biden's brain is not in cognitive decline is delusional.
I didn’t hear Joe Biden wish Ghislaine Maxwell well and downplaying her role.
I know what a few are thinking. Assuming that those electors vote for Biden. Once Biden takes that oath from the Chief Justice, the USA will have a new POTUS46. If necessary federal officials will escort Trump out of the White House.
Is it possible to have one without trump or Biden I only say them so much bc I shit on them 🥺
THIS COUNTRY IS DOOMED WITH BIDEN IN CHARGE!!! TAXES,TAXES,TAXES AND MORE TAXES!!! THE PLAN IS THIS SOCIALIST STYLE OF GOVERNMENT WHICH WILL IMPOSE MORE TAXES ACROSS THE BOARD AND BROADER CONTROL BY GOVERNMENT FOR A ONE WORLD ORDER!!! GOOD LUCK ALL!!!

If Biden had run in 2016 he would have beaten Trump.  I strongly believe Hillary lost because of her sex.  It's not that people didn't want to vote for a woman.  It's just people were more eager to believe the bullshit because she was a woman.why does joe biden have to make it so hard for me to want to vote for him
1. That entire list sounds awesome (though maybe don't *completely* empty out the prisons. Leave the dangerous people in there).  2. Biden doesn't plan on supporting anything on that list (hence why I'm still salty people didn't turn out to support Sanders).
I think people that adore Joe Rogan are similar to those that adore Trump.   I am surprised  he hasn't said Biden will hurt God with a guillotine.
The Different of all That is Russian/Putin Working on  Help Trump and Attack Biden with Lies, Conspiracy Theories and Bad Propaganda, but China &amp; Iran does not working on to attach Trump, only they don't want Trump like The Majority of USA People!

If I say both Trump and Biden are both evil and you can’t tell me the difference between the two please STFU TELLING ME WHY I SHOULD VOTE FOR BIDEN!!!! A no vote is a vote for Trump? AND!! SO WHAT!!! TO HELL WITH THEM AND YOU THIS ELECTION
Exactly.  Biden could have moderate dementia and as long as he can still say “Dr. Fauci will be leading our pandemic response” we’ll be in better hands.
GREAT! A non Trump tweet! Too bad Joe Biden doesn’t have the mental capacity to be President.
I agree Biden’s VP will either be Michelle or Susan Rice. Either way it’s an ‘IN’ for B. O. Susan has been a house guest at the Obama mansion, which was purchased very close to the White House.  I think without one of these women as VP selection, B.O. wouldn’t have supported Joe.
You sound desperate. You must be scared. You should be.   I’m voting for Biden.
Scary ,Joe says this &amp; should be immediately disqualified but all the MSM cares is how Trump pronunced Thailand. Even our local POS news didn’t cover Biden’s racist comments. The continued effort to destroy trump is on, right
On the flip side, how is Biden convincing people to like him? He doesn’t know where he is half the time and when he does manage to get a halfway-understandable sentence out he ends up insulting major groups of people.
Wrong! Tell me something Trump has done to equal 3 million Black men being locked up and the 3 strike deal written by Joe Biden.
And you think Biden isn’t racist? Who you think wrote most of the 1994 crime bill that locked up over 3 million Black man. Yesterday he basically said all Black people are the same and he told Charlemagne if you don’t vote for me you ain’t Black! You need to research Racist Joe
I think the difference is the left folk i know do not like or want biden. They know hes a bad choice. However the right seems to ignore those about trump and make excuses. That HBO interview was like a parent arguing with a toddler. I dislike both, third party for me
Looks ripe for a flip to me. Biden and Kelly will be spending big to get the vote out. An MD running during a pandemic that has been particularly flubbed in AZ can't hurt either.  Scandal tainted incumbents are always the most likely to lose.
I think Jill Biden wants to be First Lady so bad she will become Machiavelli himself and risk everything to get there. Then she can battle it out with the VP to see who really is in control of the government. Let's hope this scenario never happens!
Biden admits that African-Americans, "with notable exceptions" are mindlessly in lockstep with the Dem plantation.
Chump went before cameras to tell us Biden misspoke.   Really, motherfucker??!!  Chump has like 6 interpreters that go before cameras to let us know what he is trying to say on a daily.
He has a ton of ground to make up. If the election was today, Biden would wax him.   There’s a saying that to win president, you have to be able to convince people to like you and also convince people to dislike your opponent.   He’s AWFUL at the first and excellent at the second
So the Biden Crime Bill was not destuctive to the Afro American Community 🤔
Joe Biden = sack of crap  Trump = sack of crap set on fire and sitting on your doorstep
If Biden becomes president I’ll take back anything bad I ever said about Trump
Most of us know what he meant, but the disparity in coverage is striking. Example: The very fine people comment Trump made. The media is at the heart of racial divide in this country and NBC’s coverage of Biden’s clarification is the perfect example.
Does trump have any plans for Nov 4th or beyond?  No.  He doesn't.  Biden has about a thousand things he'd like to start on Day 1 to begin the healing. trump just wants to stay out of jail.
If you're an acolyte of the cult-of-trump, then  -your God is now vulnerable to damage from Biden, and  -your God needs trump to protect Him.  trump doesn't "self-important" much, does he?
Just once, it would be great to see NBC do a positive story on President Trump. Or, just tell the truth about Joe Biden!
Biden is a marginally less horrible candidate than Trump.  That margin becomes harder and harder to see with each passing day.  The current R/D system is a dumpster fire.
The Real Joe Biden
If Biden Killed a Black Man on 5th avenue you would still defend him
#Biden2020 says ‘poor kids’ just as bright as ‘white kids’ in latest gaffe
There isn't going to be any....not with Biden as the candidate anyway.
I know probably 40 or more liberals. Yes, many more conservatives. But asking around, I can't find one person wanting to vote for Biden.  I asked, "what if Michelle Obama is the VP pick"? And yes, liberals liked the idea. But few said they would vote for unqualified Michelle...
Biden is desperately remaining the DNC presidential candidate to keep him safe from facing justice for money laundering. The 20th and 21st century true pandemic of world Government officials.  They may try to extend the election indefinitely to maintain protection...
Joe Biden has how many race related insults and attacks? It's incalculable.   More manipulation from CNN to show pro-bias to the DNC.   Michelle Obama will be his VP pick. And it will happen as the DOJ is arresting ObamaGate agents. Protected if running for president.

No, difference between Trump and Biden, one is a Closet Racist and one is a Open Racist
You voted for McCain/Palin the wink n nod candidates over Obama/Biden? Ok!
people cant name any racist remarks that trump has made,except the videos where they cut the sentence short, but we have many many that biden has said.
Commission rejects President Trump's push to add debate against Biden
Lol. The funny thing is that Joe Biden is actually not against guns and “energy.”
Joe Biden doesn’t have to gas civilians to go to a church...they invite him.
But not nearly as anxious as they'd be if the Democrats replaced Joe Biden with an actual candidate.
Yes Biden. It’s all about RBG and Scotus.
The American people can’t handle more of your lying. Biden shouldn’t do one debate until you turn over your tax returns. We already saw what you did in 4 years. #JustSayNo
why don’t you just put a Biden sign on your desk - goodness - No match for Jordan ...
The sad truth is that thousands of Christians, led by their pastors from the pulpit, will go out and vote for Trump simply because he claims Joe Biden is against God. I don’t know either man, but I can tell you which one exemplifies Christian virtues more and it ain’t Trump.
African Americans are all Americans, most were born in USA. Not all Latinos are citizens (79%), &amp; larger percentage were born in other countries. 90% of AA vote Democratic. 36% of Latinos voted Republican in 2018. I could go on. Biden might be wrong but it’s hardly a “disaster.”
CNN is Biden really a practicing Roman Catholic if he thinks murder of innocent children is ok ?
It’s nonsensical to say you are voting against Trump and then not for Biden. You could get away with not voting for either.
Biden just told the Latino Community to not to trust his VP selection 🤔
The stupidy of his statement is overwhelming. Joe Biden is a devoted Catholic paritioner, Trump has never attended church other than political events. He has no faith, no belief in a higher power. In Trimps mind he IS the higher power, the choosen one. F him.
Biden isn't extreme left but the people who control the party now are.  I understand why people dislike the current administration...  IMO policies are pretty good but rhetoric is not great.  Biden is an ok guy but i cant get down with the Democratic agenda.
Meh. Anything is a galactic upgrade from the current situation, and saying Biden is extreme left is a big stretch.
Neither choice is great.  Not like Biden is a shining star either....the extreme left is as bad as the extreme right.  What blows my mind is that these are the options.
Now do Biden.
That Joe Biden's Thursday morning interview was disastrous is a complete understatement. That interview proves that he is unqualified to be president. The Democratic Party at the national level better do something major right away and replace him with someone who can lead.
Biden is going to need to go through this guy first! #archangelmichael
I'm more worried about the "no anything" scenario of a Biden presidency. I was really hoping to see "Godzilla vs. Kong" next May.
Nope, Biden already has my vote 🙏
Give me a break!  You would give Trump another term because of Biden’s VP pick?  Pathetic.
I don't think you are being honest.  If Biden chooses an Ostrich for his VP pick, you would still vote for him vs Donald Trump
Biden actually said "unlike the African American community, the Latino community is diverse with lots of varying opinions". He just called the African Americans simple minded followers. I bet not one word will be said in the MSM, not ONE!!
Joe Biden told you who he was, a number of years ago and his Crime Bill, let Afro Americans know his real feelings
Y’all gonna love living in white nationalist country because Biden does not meet your purity test.
The only thing left for Joe Biden to seal his fate is for a huge red danger sign to be hanging behind his head during a campaign commercial where there is a headshot, just like they did to Jimmy Carter during his re-election campaign. DANGER!
Yes. I expect a lot of Biden / Graham votes or blank / Graham votes
“No religion” then what was that nifty picture you photoshopped of Biden in church for one of your campaign ads?  And don’t get us started on your absent faith that you constantly spout. ie Photo op w upside down bible.

Joe Biden finally said what all Democrats think.

It's NOT going to be Biden..... The Convention will be the "October Surprise" from the Democrat Party, even for Joe.
Negative all the money they been getting could’ve been to weed out all the corrupt cops they have Biden is the absolute worst person we can have as president he has over 40+ years experience of oppressing us
Isn’t that basically the collective consciousness that has Biden in the spot he is in now? Everyone wanted someone different, someone new. But that someone would probably be too far left for the moderates in both parties. Ridin’ with Biden it is then. Restore decency at least.
Such a tough call. Practically anointing a possible future president. I think we all understand we are signing up for a one term president with Biden. I wish Bernie was the candidate but he couldn’t win. Clyburn said in an interview that if he doesn’t choose a woman of color....
Looks like the Petrolicious guy found a new job making Biden ads.

Does anyone really believe Joe Biden has the mentally fitness to be President of the United States if he can't even pronounce the term "mental fitness" during an interview?
Biden won’t last 15 minutes in a debate. His mind is just not there. A debate without an ear plug or questions and answers given him before debate will ruin him. Even given that, he can’t do it. He doesn’t even have any one on one’s w/narrators.
💯. In fact, I’d add that Biden is benefiting from Cal Cunningham in NC as well.
Biden is not capable of handling a pandemic when he can't handle a Democratic Friendly interview, I wish their was a 3rd Party Candidate to vote for because Biden is not Presidential Material
The Iowa poll out today shows identical Trump/Ernst   vs. Biden/Greenfield numbers. Cal Cunningham's numbers in NC are consistently better than Biden's.
Some days you just feel like Joe Biden .... 🤣🤣🤣
So, let me see if I got this right - "Biden scraps plan to travel to Milwaukee to make acceptance speech, citing Covid concerns"???  Really?  What's he going to say when the Democrats pick somebody else? Like Cuomo!   That'll be an "oh, shit" moment for the ages....
I want Trump out of office but I’m gonna LMAO if the first words from either candidate is Trump asking Biden if he’s a cocaine junkie.
Using a measure of GDP, to make the point that it should be higher, insinuates that low wage workers should keep chugging along, right through Covid. By definition, if more of them stayed home, these numbers would be this low, or even lower... Yet Biden is arguing AGAINST that??
This video is so fun. Ignore the polls, it says, and demonstrates how and why the 2020 Trump-Biden race will be TIGHT!
Joe Biden is using, “GDP per capita,” to measure the health of the economy? That’s even worse than using the unemployment rate. LOL. Why doesn’t he talk about how many people are housing insecure, or how many people lack healthcare?

They could've easily made Biden drop out and get behind Pete, unless the progressive DNC doesn't think a gay man is electable.
Coupled with that, now is the time to call for universal healthcare. But I’ve never seen anything in a Joe Biden ad, on this topic, other than vague platitudes. He is exactly the wrong person for this moment. It’s becoming harder to make his case.
Would love to see a 30 minute interview w/ Biden with no prepared questions, etc to compare.  Then people can make their decision.  But that wont happen.
The Swan/Axios interview with Trump is one ginormous campaign ad for Joe Biden.   It. Was. Bonkers.    #RidinWithBiden #Biden2020 #TeamJoe #WeWantJoe
At least he is Real Democrat , no like AOC that is an Hypocrite want to be Puerto Rican Socialist like Bernie, We call people like her "Pendejos Independentista en Puerto Rico"!
She broke tradition by actively campaigning for the VP slot. Biden is a traditionalist who was likely put off by that. She also lacks the resume of statewide or federal office that other candidates have.
This is what scares me about trump vs Biden.

Yes. That would be fraud. That isn’t even remotely close to what I meant. Let’s try again. If you vote for a 3rd party candidate, it is a throwaway because there are no realistic alternatives right now. Biden will at least ensure stability until 2024 where you can then help(1/2)

It’s difficult to fact check everything coming out of his mouth. Besides, there is no indication at all that Biden will not debate Trump. It’s fake news.

My sister and her live in boyfriend are voting Biden. He has brainwashed her.
They (Obama and Biden) handled it by telling the CDC to stop reporting the cases and deaths because they knew they had a pandemic on their hands and they didn't want the numbers to go up.
the hypocrisy is amazing.  just like they say trump is racist while biden voted for segregation in 75.
it's not hard to assign blame in the US.  Its the warmongers who want to intervene where they have incomplete information.  Its' Clinton/ Biden/ Obama plus all of George W Bush legacy.  Trump is the fix for that nonsense.

So the real fight for power in a Biden administration will be btwn Jill and whoever the VP is. Jill Biden must be the most Machiavellian potential first lady ever! She is subjecting her husband to far-reaching abuse just so she can be in control.
If it's Trump's America then it is Andy Beshear's Kentucky. Beshear and his wife are so close to Bidden that Biden got a good sniff of Brittany's hair most likely.
Actually, Niles, the order to place ankle bracelets on the entire family "snitched on" came from Kentucky Governor Andy Beshears, a "close" friend of Joe Biden's so close no doubt Biden has sniffed the hair of Brittany, the First Lady of Kentucky.
Yeah. There is literally no talking point that can be deployed successfully FOR Biden. There is none.
My Kentucky friend said a family from Kentucky who visited relatives in Michigan were "turned in" by a neighbor and 8 cops showed up at their door with ankle bracelets for the entire family. That's where we are already in Biden's America and he hasn't even been elected yet. #Andy

Couple that with how many people dislike Trump, Biden walks away the easy winner.
I heard Ben Shapiro talk about why Biden will win. Trump is essentially running a campaign against someone who doesn’t exist. Biden doesn’t speak much. And if they don’t debate, Biden can’t show off his inability to create sentences.

No, Biden needs to demand his tax returns prior to accepting any debate to go forward
With Joe Biden as the only option? Bitch please..
Biden is a habitual racists. Cover him Jim and you’ll see for yourself. You won’t tell the truth so POTUS has to do your job for you
But we all know Biden doesn’t tweet. He probably didn’t even read those tweets much less write them.
But we all know Biden doesn’t tweet. He probably didn’t even read those tweets much less write them.
Biden is a racist! He opened his mouth and removed all doubt yesterday? TRUMP 2020!!
Well shit Jimmy, if we listen to you then Joe is elected. You’ve been hijacked to lead the way for no debates. W/O debates then no one will see the true Biden full of lies and wishing for a brain. How much did they pay you?
Joe Biden makes God angry but also Joe Biden does not make God angry.
Democrats are CHICKENS! McCauliffe, have a debate before the vote, prove you think Biden is going to win. Don't do a debate before the vote, proves Democrats are still pro-slavery.
The nonpartisan Commission on Presidential Debates has rejected a request from the Trump campaign to either add an additional general election debate or move up the calendar for the contests.
Neither does Joe Biden lol pretty sad for us
Pres. Donald Trump billed his trip to Ohio as a chance to promote economic recovery, but quickly pivoted to a deeply personal attack on Joe Biden, even questioning without foundation the former vice president's faith in God.
Biden for the win. #Biden2020Landslide
#VoteTrump2020, and if you can't bring yourself to do so, then stay home or consider voting for  Biden is not a capable leader and the Democrats are anti-American. #NoBiden #VoteRed #VoteGold
Idiot   says Biden will hurt God, the Bible, something. We'd be better off, if it were true. Evidently Trump had someone read to him only the Bible parts about plagues in the Book of Revelation. #ImpeachTrumpAgain #BlueWave2020
Wisconsin Official Blasts Republicans for Working with Kanye to Steal Votes from Biden
WOW! Joe Biden is so powerful, he can hurt God, according to bunker boy, that is.
Wow you will do anything to try to down Joe Biden. Even when he has clearly done nothing that you say he does. I believe you scared of him aren’t you.
I am a notable exception having seen the wizard behind the curtain. Joe Biden the one who eulogized and praised KKK Leader. Is saying the black mind is still in chains and few can think independently of what they tell us. Sorcery
Joe Biden is suffering from dementia and is being used.  Where is your reporting on that?
Wow Joe you really are clueless. Donald Trump put people back to work that had been suffering under the Anti-Job Obama Biden establishment! Do you really believe this or is it just a desperate talking point?
This choice is pretty clear for me. Biden will hand this country over to the woke communist mob, sow more racial division, allow unmitigated illegal immigration, and sell us out to foreign powers and interests. Trump is a keynesian statist, but we can bide our time with him.
That's if turnout is even, which I doubt it will be. There's no enthusiasm for Biden
Lol right. As soon as America sees that Biden is losing it, his goose will be cooked
Karen, you are such a Karen! Wake up! Biden has dementia.....so obvious!
I know for a fact these are Biden supporters!
Assault is an action . Not a rifle
Now she would be a great Vice President and I wish Biden would pick her
He is and his family are evil letting them take advantage of him. And I am no Biden fan but wrong is wrong
Let me add. Any campaign. This is not a partisan issue. I don’t want the American people paying for Biden campaign either.
I could see a Clinton "suicide" hit on Biden just before accepting the democrats nomination and them slipping in anyone I mean someone else. You know anyone else be better choice.
Walk away from the plantation, son! You are being played big time. Deep in your heart you know Trump is NOT a racist and Biden really is!
WHAT  A SHOCK! This is a LIE! Trump issued a preemptive travel ban from China and EVERY Democrat including Senile Joe Biden DISAGREED! TRUMP 2020!!!
This is a LIE! Trump issued a preemptive travel ban from China and EVERY Democrat including Senile Joe Biden DISAGREED! TRUMP 2020!!!
All of you saying no need to keep in mind he’s gunna sit there from Nov till Jan destroying our country worse and making a hugest mess out of everything just to make it hard for Biden to fix it. Millions will die!!!
Because Joe Biden is   for others and not himself
I may be unpopular for saying this but the Biden family and the Democratic party needs to be charged with the abuse of an elder. Something is clearly wrong with Biden and they still put him out there as people abuse him. I am no fan but it is still unethical.
If you have never seen a fool you are now!  Biden is a puppet fool.
Joe Biden will win with 330 electoral votes
If I were Trump, I’d be nice to Biden.He’s gunna need a pardon, or several!!
Joe Biden delays his vice presidential pick by TWO WEEKS
Biden is a communist socialist whatever is not American!
So far Trump has given us a recession, double digit unemployment, human trafficking of immigrant children, a pandemic out of control. Open treason regarding our murdered soldiers, theft of taxpayer funds. I don’t see how Biden could do worse
She said “straight from Biden’s mouth” - I challenge you to find him saying any of these things.
Debates are necessary to make informed decisions! Cowardice is not the position of the most influential person to lead from. Biden will be destroyed. Wake up- he gets elected and in 3 months removed to make way for Black female VP.
Oh come on! Anyone w/ any sense has known that the Dems can’t put him on display to Trump. It will be a turning point that is necessary and decisive. Biden is unfit and they know it. Only making every excuse known to man can save them!
With the huge difference being that Biden banning guns would immediately cause the Boogaloo to break out
You are right Joe we won’t go back to the mistakes of the Obama Biden administration! TRUMP 2020!!!
I've literally seen more  bumper stickers here in South Carolina than Biden stickers.
Biden never said any of these things. Rhonda is a delusional liar.
Should have stayed in bed. Not whining all morning.    Trump launches Twitter spree touting accomplishments and bashing Biden
As Joe Biden nears the announcement of his vice presidential choice, the top contenders and their advocates are making final appeals.
Source for this?: “Biden flat-out said to middle-class taxpayers - to their faces - that he will raise their taxes.”
This pandemic has shown us what all our elected officials think of us. Trump is one and they are many but they always seem to bend the knee for him. Vote Biden and nothing will change as well. It never does. Neither party cares.
Someone take this gif of Obama and Biden walking together and make it a banging Action movie promo gif for Obama 4. With flames and ruins please.  We need this so bad
Joe Biden narrows down his VP list, with Karen Bass emerging as one of several key contenders
Did you??
And Obama and Biden were the most corrupt president and Vice President we ever had!
I just don’t get it ! how could anyone ln their right mind even think of voting for Biden .  I’m almost afraid. If the Democrats could cheat to win . I don’t  believe they’d have a problem with it .
You seem worried. All you have to do when VP Biden kicks your sorry ass in November, is to run to Putin.
Get real people. Both asses are no good for America. Don’t act like removing Trump is the answer. Biden and Dems want to be Marxist and Socialist. That’s not good for us either. There MUST be a better way!
We don't exist to them outside of pawns in their money/power games. We are disposable to both side. Human Capital Stock.  I see so many people acting like Biden is going to be the Savior of the USA, when really, what he is, is the only other choice that isn't a psychopath,
I know that we need to get rid of the toxic monsters that are there now, but I am absolutely sure we're being herded in to this choice that isn't a choice at all.  Biden's slogan might as well be Vote for me or we'll leave this insane narcissist and his family in charge to
Biden if I can ask you for any ONE thing, please forgive at least a portion of college debt 🥺 #NobodyLikesTrump
Do you not know that Biden has Dementia?Biden's ignorance doesn't deserve that energy. African Americans know that Blackness is not a monolith. That we are a diverse and remarkable people. We have nothing to prove.
I could remind y'all of how Biden's ignorant and disrespectful comment seeks to divide Black and Latinx voters. A tactic that's old and tired.
I could waste my time talking about how Joe Biden's most recent statement about Black voters is just the kind of stupidity you'd expect from a misogynist racist.
Biden funnels foreign aid back to his family and you think he’s gonna open that can of worms?
Polls now show Biden dipping with various voters and overall.

Biden won’t attend DNC in Milwaukee amid coronavirus concerns
You would think after 4 years of this clown the slogan would be changed to keep America great. Yea we gonna make America great again by voting for Joe Biden
On the other side of the aisle is Joe Biden. Who, most definitely has dementia. This election is battle of the Dementia's? Who's brain is less aged?
Biden has pledged to select a woman and is facing calls to choose the first Black woman to compete on a presidential ticket.
The vetting has resurfaced internal party divisions between the old-guard establishment and a younger generation that's more attuned to gender and racial biases.
Dems are between a rock and a hard place.   No way they can let the world see Biden in his current state but they risk voter revolt if they don’t debate.  They are trying to come up with a reason not to debate that the public will accept.  I don’t think they will be successful.
If Biden wants to take the world stage as President he needs to take the stage with Trump first and make the case to the American people and to the world as to why he should have the job.  You can’t have the job without going through the interview process.
Can anyone imagine Biden dealing with China or Russia?  Can you picture him at a G-7 Summit representing the US?   If Biden wants to be on the World Stage he has to take the stage with Trump first.   Period.
With 92 days until Election Day, here's what we're watching heading into a new week in the 2020 campaign:
And if you’re voting for Biden you should get your head examined cause you clearly have a problem
Mr. Beckel, I have voted on both parties in the past. The last two elections, the Democratic party has failed to provide a worthy candidate that I would vote for. I don't agree with President Trump on many things, but I agree with Mr. Biden on very little. Have a great day, Bob.
I LOVE LEO  y'all lost him to violence &amp; WILL VOTE  LIKE MANY MORE will    had a INTERESTING show 2nite about JUST what  will DO TO THE BURBS thru        PICK BASS BIDEN LEO SAYS 😂
Still undecided who I am going to vote for.. I do not just vote one party. Just best that I see. He needs to show me something because so far Trump is in my lead because Biden has not showed me anything yet and I’m trying to see something..
The truth is that Biden is not a stupid man, and therefore would never choose a ridiculous person to be his running mate. Unlike King Cheeto, who excels in stupidity.
Where's Hunter Biden?
Allies say Karen Bass's reputation as a bridge-builder would make her a strong partner to presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden.
President Biden will see to that
Nice try Donny boy, but it ain’t workin. You’re desperate &amp; you know it’s over. Just think Biden landslide!!!!......bahahaha
exactly. and so many people are all like "beating trump is all that matters vote biden" and "black lives matter," unable, or unwilling, to see that the two are incompatible as the former actively works against the latter.
There it is! We all knew it would lead to this. Pussy is trying to cancel the election. He’s down double digits in a majority of states to Biden. He sees the writing on the wall.
It’s already starting to happen. Rise up &amp; speak out against this tyranny!!!
Joe Biden needs a VP that’s ready and capable day one of being president.
Yet you want Biden?🤣🤣🤣
Is it just coincidence that Biden tells his staff not to trade right before Trump strikes this huge Kodak deal? Is there the possibility that Trump or his people profited greatly from this and Joe plans to use it against him?
Great.  I was in Dallas two weeks ago and saw 2 Biden yard signs in my mother’s neighborhood.  I saw 2 Trump signs, as well, but Dallas County has become blue since I left in 1994.  Need to turn it red this fall.   I also saw Hillary signs in the ultra wealthy Park Cities in 1996FINALLY!!!!! PRESIDENT DONALD J. TRUMP IS "NOT" A RACIST!!! BUT!!!! VP JOE BIDEN IS!!!! THEREFORE, YOU BLACKS CAN STAND ON TV SUPPORTING BIDEN, SHOWING THE WORLD JUST HOW STUPID YOU ARE!!! 😂😝😛😎🤣🤪
At least Biden takes responsibility and apologize for his screw ups. You blame everyone in the world and never take responsibility or apologize. You’re a damn fool if you think you’re worthy of their votes, he’ll you’re not worthy of one single Vote.
In your dreams! Biden will be our new and A REAL PRESIDENT
Notice the #MAGA grifters never admit they are black until after a Biden gaffe.  Now all of a sudden they become black and scream racism.  Any other time it doesn't exist and they aren't black, their American.
Virginia mayor urged to resign after saying Biden picked 'Aunt Jemima' as his running mate
Keep lying to yourself, you know Biden has lost his fastball and now must rely on the off speed pitches where hiding from the public is his biggest strength. Watch him closely with the get off my lawn anger, unable to string multiple sentences together.

Joe Biden.. I mean Tom wolf tries to run PA like he’s the king, a corrupt king
They also don't want Joe Biden to debate Donald Trump .Because  he will leek crimes and information about political stunts. He knows things he doesn't know he knows.If that makes  any sense
They just want Biden in office so they can declare victory and pretend like all the racism, misogyny, and homophobia just magically evaporated.  There ain’t no long haul left in America.
Much more accurate than a poll showing Biden up 15. The worst case scenario would be a 5 point loss. You are fooling yourself if you think it will not be close.
BREAKING: Joe Biden Attacks Reporter ‘Are You a Junkie?’  via  Patriot
Dear James, wake up, the liberals are not electing Joe Biden, they are electing his VP. He'll be gone one way or another by way of Art.25. By Feb 2021.
I think the fact people think Kanye isn’t serious about running because “those close to him have raised concerns about his mental health” . Trump IMO probably doesn’t have the best mental health based on tweets and videos, and Biden has even MORE problems with mental health!!
What an idiot Biden is. Nothing in 45 yrs?
He's changed these last 3 years. He used to at least be independent, but then McCain died and Drumpf has him by his ladybugs. My wife and I are voting for Jamie, straight Democratic ticket even if  is selected for Biden's vp.
THIS GOES OUT TO ALL MY WHITE BROTHERS AND SISTERS: THE NEXT TIME A "DEMOCRAT" CALLS YOU A RACIST, DON'T PANIC! JUST SAY:  "EXCUSE ME? DO I LOOK LIKE JOE  BIDEN TO YOU???" 🤣🤣🤣
Haha. For a minute there I thought you were talking about Biden. It all fit so perfectly. But then I realized maybe not. You didn’t mention memory problems, had the worst economy in years (non COVID) and money his son made in China and Ukraine. Oops
If Biden accept to debate Trump he'll mop the floor with him, if he refuses it shows how weak he is; he cannot stand 2 hrs exchange of ideas.
I will be voting but there is no possibility that I will vote for Biden or any other democrat.
Biden never could get his Obama thoughts ahead. That's why he  was VP. He was controlled.
Monkey County....next third world shithole county over from where I grew up in PG County. You couldn't pay me enough to live in communist Maryland. I dunno how my brother does it. Sadly his wife is a Biden Zombie too

This brand new poll is bad news for Joe Biden and every Democrat  via
We need 4 more years for Trump to repair the damage done by Obama and Biden the 8 years that they were in charge. In fact we need Republicans to keep the radical leftists Democrats from destroying our country.
Unstable Joe Biden SNAPS and Insults Another Woman After Being Asked Simple Question -
Joe Biden needs to be put on a health care plan to give him support for his dementia. Can't believe that his family is allowing him to continue with the campaign.
Not worried about a delay. The Democrats have proven just how corrupt they are and I am afraid that they are rigging an election. We could have a president in Joe Biden that can not complete a sentence on his own.
Biden for now is safe. But God forbid, he gets elected, the Dem, before inauguration,  will start questioning his sanity in order to replace him and the VP, who will take over,  by people of their choice.
I will vote for Biden 2020 #WeWillVote
AOC is becoming part of Biden’s inner circle. It’s a risky move
Biden &amp; Obama did nothing for 8 yrs. In the Whitehouse. Just like the Democrats running the City's.
I live in Charleston, S.C, I just watched a commercial for Joe Biden and they played a video of President Ronald Reagan giving the are you better off than you were four years ago speech! POTUS Trump forbidden from using Reagan but left can? SHAMEFUL!
WATCH: Joe Biden Forgets What Year It Is During Virtual Campaign Event
I agree this is ridiculous and seems like it comes from a place of sexism. However, I also don't want Harris to be the VP. To balance Biden we need more of a progressive. Otherwise we are libel to end up with another moderate ticket that won't generate enough enthusiasm.We don't want to hear Biden talking anyway.
And if it doesn't, it was also a joke. C'mon man, don't you get it? *Big Joe Biden smile
I think, maybe, it's because he's a carbon based lifeform and tragedy literally occurs every day. Gotta hit the powerful sometimes. Got hit twice. Not unusual.   Disclaimer: I have no empirical proof Joe Biden is carbon based, it may be the man runs on actual liquid money.
This just reads like the latest Joe Biden interview.
Biden is about as sharp as a bowling ball.  #dummy
This Native Black American, my family and friends zoomed yesterday and LOAO at the stupidity of the Republicans thinking the idiot Kanye West taking Black votes for Biden. Most Blacks now feel nothing but disdain for Kanye West. #Biden2020 all the way.

Biden is as joke.
Biden is scared to be speaking in public.
She knows more! Joe Biden has 50 years experience one year at a time. He did not learn much and his mind has atrophied.
This is an example of how the Democratic Party works: If Biden won the House will make policy. Nancy Pelosi would call the Shots while ‘VP Female TBD’ will highlight Covid and the Brave Immigrants. Biden?? Drones Pamper theQueen NP.
CNN's   More than just FAKE NEWS he's an absolute LIAR and lives in FANTASY LAND!  Like Biden could hold a complete thought without his handlers.   The "rightwing" media, Brian?  WANTS Biden to OUT HIMSELF with a debate.
That’s why we need to make extra sure to keep Donald Trump in and Joe Biden OUT!
Guess who'll catch the blame, even if Biden wins this time? Oh, he didn't win every state? Must be racists and Bernie supporters. Won't say socialists, because they apparently don't exist in America. Just Bernie supporters. Which is actually a boon.
Let there not be any truth in Biden not picking a black woman.  The young will not come out and there are a few old that will stay home. Don’t do 2016 over again, Biden. Please show us some RESPECT
There needs to be a debate.  We all know trump will crumble  Biden.
Biden will not debate Trump.   His leftist handlers cannot allow the world to see his cognitive decline. The downside of refusing to debate is FAR outweighed by the downside of revealing his true condition
Catholic here who will be voting for **checks notes** fellow catholic, Joe Biden
US election 2020: The war hero who could be Biden's running mate
They haven't listened to a word he's said since April. E, cept, maybe, to make sure he's staying on the pro-Biden message. They'll still lie and say Biden got less votes and it was Bernie's fault though.
I think there is this fear of being put in the history books as an enabler for Trump's fascism if Biden loses. He has seen the news for the last four years that has blamed him, and if it happens again, whether deserved or not, he's internalized it.
I’m a mom and I’m FOR Biden. You have no clue what you are saying. You don’t speak for us. #TrumpIsALaughingStock #TrumpHasNoCredibility  #BlackLivesMatter  #VoteForJoeI truly hope there is something a President Biden can do for him. This is appalling.
How is it an attack to tell her that it’s an absurd excuse and she had no intention of voting for Biden at all.  got that white woman crying game down! So tired of the victim hood. We owe Rebulican women that vote majority Republican since 64 , NOTHING! Entitled behinds.
What would have to happen if a President Biden restricted non Catholic churches.
It seams that the Catholic Church was not always a religion that favored abortion.The Catholic church opposed abortion. This the argument if a president Biden will close Christian Religions. Supreme court judge Roberts or the other 4 Catholics will not oppose Pres Biden order.
The Biden speech writer made a mistake &amp; Biden could not adapt. The question discussed on Rush Limbaugh was could Biden afford to loose Cuban vote by strengthening relations with Cuba.
People understand in marketing terms what a loss leader is. Define as taking a loss on one product to attract customers ; then gaining on a different product. That is what Candidate Biden is to Democratic party- a loss leader.
Chip in to elect Joe Biden and other Democrats on the ballot
Y’all didn’t have any other phot of Joe Biden?
If you’re putting conditions on your vote for Biden when a man that has let 160,000 Americans die and says , “It is what it is” , you’re as unserious as he is and frankly you’re going to vote for Trump. This is ABSURD!
I just read that Joe Biden said he would not stand in the way of investigations of Trump! That’s excellent!
Love Juan Williams defense of Joe Biden as a regular church-going Catholic. How can any Catholic support abortion up to birth? I just watch the Five to watch Jesse (who isn't there today) put Juan in his place.
Yep the Democrats don’t want him to run because that will take votes away from Biden .
I live in S.C. on the border of North + South Carolina. I have seen one Biden sticker in CLT, NC  I still see Bernie shirts/signs/stickers on the regular  Trump stickers, t-shirts, signs, + flags are obnoxiously everywhere. A growing trend of flags on their trucks, boats, + homes

Time to respond with the only good advice ever given by Joe Biden: Grab your shotgun, step outside and let off one blast into the air.
Go wake Biden up.
I hear nothing but Biden ads on my black radio station.
I enjoyed this so much the first time I thought I'd post it again. Breaking News!
He should have included The Babylon Bee article to "substantiate" that posting.
Trump never stumbles. I've watched everything he's done. Talks perfect. He can speak in front of thousands and never use a teleprompter. But I've heard Obama and Biden studder like drunken fools!
Buehler? In my 66+ years I've never seen a more incompetent candidate than Joe Biden at age 77. His dementia is obvious to all. Dems painted themselves into this corner starting with the #Shampeachment using Biden as the "wronged" party by Trump's fear of his winning.
Love it. Give Biden a #ClockDrawingTest using crayons if he prefers. Let him pick his favorite color.
Trump trying to steal Biden’s Slogan!
That’s Joe Biden’s Slogan! Point it out!
The hope is to obviously hurt Biden, but such moves have an insulting, unstated premise: “Hurr ... Black voters are so unsophisticated that they’ll vote for the African American singing guy!”  Underestimate African American voters at your own peril.
Biden’s new VP pick
99% of the "unity task force platform" are from Sanders' policies. Might as well just let Bernie campaign on them, since Biden can't articulate them clearly.
Wow! That's quite the blanket tweet. Do you ever get responses from any of those you've addressed? Amendment 25 says that if Biden is president and declared incompetent, the VP can take over.
How can the Dems think that Biden can cruise into the presidency by hiding out and scripted media events? We all can see that he would never pass the #ClockDrawingTest for dementia. His blank 1,000 yard stare is almost always in place. He can't handle more than a 10 minute talk.
It’s called “the Biden cure”
Neither, I would say it is on a virus. If you must point a finger at someone it would be China! You can't shut the world down because of a virus that is killing less than 1% of the people it infects.Let me guess, if Biden was the president we only have a couple deaths. Right?
Too bad there isn't a competency test for President. Even of Biden could pass the #ClockDrawingTest I'd be satisfied. My belief is he has advanced dementia which they are hiding from view.
Biden’s new VP pick
What about the Biden/Jenner ticket?
There is no “delay”.There is no “dragging”.Biden himself was not chosen until August 23. When was the DNC that year?Y’all in the media have to find an angle but it’s always a negative one when it comes to Democrats. Way to piss on a grand occasion. Expect it from men not women.
There is no delay. Biden himself was not chosen until August 23. Stop the bullshit.
Crazy (certifiably) Bernie Sanders is campaigning for Biden, his surrogate president. Bernie is still nuts, IMHO. Never did a lick of work in his life, but wants to get Socialism/Communism system to replace capitalism in the U.S.
Something smells about Biden's "candidacy". We conservatives can all see that he is mentally unfit. His handlers keep him away from live press events. The unity platform is clearly Bernie Sanders' socialism agenda.
Many people are saying that Biden will ban all sex of any kind!
Could we please not pretend that it wasn’t Chris Dodd that said this mysogynist crap about Kamala Harris by attributing it to the” Biden Team”.
I live in ruby red SC an I have up a banner for Biden , signs for Jamie Harrison, Moe Brown, and Black Lives Matter. Plus bumper stickers in my car windows. I wasn’t going to put up anything but then decided I wouldn’t live scared.
The irony that Biden was picked to run to serve as the wronged party in the #Shampeachment, but now is showing obvious signs of declining mental acuity, is simply rich. Almost like the Dems painted themselves into a corner...
You'll have to worry about jail, WHEN joe wins. You're better off starting to kiss President Biden's a$$. Maybe he'll go easy on you. Hope not though. #TrumpIsLosing
Biden is a complete joke. He'll promise anything to get elected. If you were to ask him what he said, he'd have no recollection. Needs to take the #ClockDrawingTest for dementia, IMO.
Now I love Angela Rye but Joe Biden never said never said he was announcing his VP pick on August 1, 2020. He didn’t .
Imagine if he chose Barry Soetoro (AKA Barrack Obama) as VP. That would allow Barry to declare Biden incompetent to serve (per Amendment 25) and take over as president. Scary. Yep, they need to bury the Durham evidence and kill the indictments being prepared.
Two white 70 year old people on the ticket will not energize the ticket. White people have not voted for the Democratic ticket since 1964. Biden should energize his base,that ain’t white folk.Hillary picking Tim Kaine , though he is a good man,dud . Same if Joe picks Warren, dud.
Did you ask this same question when Obama picked Biden? I’ll wait and I’ll need receipts .
I am a  Biden supporter but I’ll be damned if I’ll be told that a white woman is better On black issues and policies than a black woman even by another black woman.
Fuck no to Nina Turner. She called the Biden campaign a “bowl of shit”. Nope .
Joe Biden is also
He’s not “allowed” anything . Chris Dodd and Ed Rendell said what they said. How about we hold those making the transgressions accountable for their words and actions. I trust Joe Biden because he earned it.
Why doesn’t your headline say “Biden delays VP pick one week” 🤔
Following both you and your very brave brother . Thank you for your service to our country! I pray that Joe Biden becomes president and your service will be called upon again in other ways ! God bless!
I’m hoping for a particular black woman, but Biden didn’t promise a black woman VP. He just said a woman.
I’m voting for Joe. It’s either Biden or Trump. That’s it. I don’t understand folk that acting so pressed.
Ed Rendell is not part of the search and Biden himself was not announced until 8/23 two weeks before the convention. This is about mysogyny period and that’s what should be attacked!
Will we be shocked to see Joe Biden among those who took the Lolita Express? I have a feeling about that.
Eventually, we'll learn more about those connections. The obvious ones: Hunter Biden, Diane Feinstein, Tim Kaine, Mitt Romney, etc. we are already aware of.

Oh no! How shocking that Biden isn't radical enough for this BDS spewing thing. Hopefully, her opponent David Dudenhoefer, will take advantage of her ambivalence.  is the representative that MI13 needs to restore sanity and integrity to Congress.
It would only be a question of how long before she declared Biden incompetent under Amendment 25.
The extremely obvious difference between Biden and Trump's mental acuity is impossible to deny. Keep in mind that due to Donald Trump's brother dying from alcoholism he vowed to never drink or smoke. Looks to me like clean living pays off later in life.

Washington Post fact-checker roasted for insisting Biden didn't say what he said
has gone over the edge in ranting that Joe Biden is “against God,” etc.  This from one who’s never asked God for forgiveness, infrequently attends church, and doesn’t know the Bible except how to use it as a prop.
Incapacitated?  Yet you would vote for BIDEN?  What a laugh!
Anyone who picks the moron Trump over Biden is a moron!!! Black white red or any color!
Biden, slow down this is the time the idiots out there are going to to trip you up. Don’t be reactive. Give yourself a minute when you’re being attacked or asked stupid questions..  this way u don’t have to go back and apologize for someone asking you inappropriate questions.
But apparently you think Trump is SO AWFUL yet you would vote for Biden who is clearly NOT FIT.... So, I guess that shoe fits YOU then doesn't it!
Seriously, WATCH THIS and tell me Biden is fit to be President!
Trump is good at 3 things lol  Ignoring important questions  Making fun of Joe Biden  And pretending to know how to golf
The ad works because most Americans don’t know Biden said he wouldn’t have stopped travel from China and praised Cuomo for his handling of the virus which was horrendously bad. He hopes people are dumb....which generally works bc most are.
Were you up Deadline Creek with no topic?  Your column is nonsensical self-flagellation.  A write-in vote is a wasted choice, and if you can’t discern the critical imperative of choosing Biden over Poserdent Agolf Twitler, then turn in your pontificator’s badge.
That was Biden photoshopped to look like Trump.  Or don't you know about Biden's racist past and present?
So, you are admitting you people plan to abuse the powers of the FBI if Biden gets elected?  Well, at least you are honest.

Biden accused the black reporter of being a junkie ... hmmmmm
She wants Biden’s spot. She’s jealous. Wants to be president.
Biden in Full Mental Meltdown. Accuses Sympathetic Black Journalist of Being a "Junkie" and Can't Even Pronounce…
. voted for every one of Trump's follies so far - and Trump's deficit spending will prob end up over 10 TRILLION for 4 years.   Looks like he is planning on Biden winning. Same old game.
Tara Reade has stopped pushing her story. No evidence. Lawyer dropped her. So end of that. Nothing out there indicates that Joe Biden is interested in children. Joe Biden is well respected. Stop smearing. Research.
When Trump came on the political scene I was a centrist Republican but Trump doesn't represent me at all. Trump is not honest and he is not smart. Trump doesn't believe in responsibility. His pandemic response is a big failure. I'll be voting for Biden. I'm a #LincolnVoter
Biden won’t even do an interview with anyone even remotely not lobbing him softballs. You honestly believe Joe is out front and leading here? He literally been hiding in his basement and sent his wife to do an interview on FOX. 😂
Why is no one talking about this in the MSM?! Hunter Biden trouble trouble trouble. where is Hunter?! Thank You, President Trump   for draining the swamp.
Biden has NOT taken a cognitive test and gets upset when asked the question.  No wonder Dems are keeping him locked in the basement and don't want him to debate Trump!
This whole "will Biden debate" thing is a ruse.  They are going to make expectations SO LOW for Biden, that just showing up will mean the hate Trump media declares Biden the debate winner.

So now that you have judged me.....judge Joe Biden.
I'm not lost.  Trump is NOT my savior.  He did a lot of things in his past that I hate.  But he hasn't done any of those things while in office.  People can change.  Unlike Biden who hasn't changed one bit.  So many Dems are leaving the party because of the extreme policies.
If you had any real concerns on the safety of mail in voting, you be working to strengthen it. Aren’t you afraid you mail in vote will get applied to Biden?  You are just showing us your fear of losing.
Why would you expect to see any Biden supporters anywhere that you showed up?
Andrew Kliman and the Marxist Humanist Initiative being Biden stans is the funniest thing to me.
Biden is running against him.  I certainly have the right to state the obvious.  So...you going to vote for him?  A bit hypocritical don't you think?  You may want to find a different topic to attack Trump about since your candidate is a sleaze and a crook (Ukraine).
Remember when Obama put Biden in charge of the 2009 stimulus and there was no fraud? Good times
I am voting for Trump, Biden has not said anything of value that would make me change my vote.
Biden is obviously declining. His family should be ashamed

Biden could announce the Peanut M&amp;M guy...and I'd vote for him!
Biden NEEDS to get his VP name out NOW; he needs to have her Skirt to hide behind; he cannot carry this campaign  another minute
“Believers for Biden,” is like saying ‘vegetarians for the meat industry.’
“Biden's totally-botched failure on the Swine Flu...”  You need to go back to gaslighting class.  The articles show the failures were at the manufacturers’ level.  A national emergency was declared; there was a reality-based response, not a tRump-like effort to deny the crisis.
Force masks on everyone = must vote via US Mail = fraud = Biden's VP is the new Commander in Chief= US in major trouble

Okay mr Biden... we heard u loud and clear.
Did u say greatest president?  OMG u must have dementia like Drunk Uncle Joe Biden.
Excited for Biden....
Kamala, if you are VP, you will be running the US. Joe Biden, as you and any human alive knows, is not capable of running anything. He is old and sick- very sick. And you in charge as Commander in Chief is a joke.
Who didn't have "delay elections " on their BINGO card? How is it perfectly safe to open schools but not to vote? Can't have it both ways. PS: I'll stand in freezing rain, changing masks as needed, for hours....to VOTE YOU OUT  #Biden2020 #Biden #Biden2020Landslide
Dems believe that VP/biden will walk out of the Destruction of our Country and transform it into the Marxist State they have wanted for 50 yrs!!
And  just posted the Biden's policies would hurt the poor. The GOP is fucked up....The whole world is waiting for November 3rd and your landslide loss to Joe Biden. I would say good bye, but I want your life to suck even more after you leave office.
In your dreams! Biden will be our new and A REAL PRESIDENT
I don't think a rehash of the 2016 sound bites would benefits Joe Biden.  Kamala Harris is ready to be President.
Well, Biden is pro-infanticide, a big no-no against the tenets of the faith the *claims* to uphold, and the Dems have booed God at their convention.  Not a big stretch for President Trump to say that.
Trump says Biden is 'against God'  via
Keep lying to yourself, you know Biden has lost his fastball and now must rely on the off speed pitches where hiding from the public is his biggest strength. Watch him closely with the get off my lawn anger, unable to string multiple sentences together.
Where's Twitter and FB when Biden &amp; his campaign say that President Trump is responsible for the deaths of 150,000 Americans? That's a flat out LIE. A virus killed these Americans NOT Trump. A virus no one here or in any country  has any answers on how to stop that China spread.
Biden has an empty look in his eyes. I saw the same look in my grandmother's eyes when she had Dementia.
I don't know if you noticed scumbag, but this is happening under YOUR administration not Biden's.
Now do Biden!  This isn't news!
For tRump to say today that “Biden is against God” is desperate new low even for this sad Prez after all the personal tradegies Joe B has gone thru you think he didn’t find comfort in his faith. This is from a man that follows no religion and holds a bible upside down.  😱🙏🤯🌊
We are going to vote...for Joe Biden.
There it is. Biden will take the hands off approach.  As it should be.
But Joe ain't racist.......  "Latinos have a diversity of thought unlike blacks who all think alike."  -Joe Biden  "You ain't Black"  -Joe Biden   "Your a junkie"  -Joe Biden   "First "clean" African American candidate"  -Joe Biden
Biden's doing a good job of cancelling himself!
“Well BIDEN has sexual assault accusations” yeah uh so does the man we have in office. Next
Then Joe Biden must be the poster child for DEMENTIA!
Simple minded is much better than brain dead like Biden and his followers 😂😂
Trump had this economy booming,and he will do it again. Biden will continue to sell our country out to China. Clyburn is a disgrace. Democrats want American taxpayers to pay for the health care of illegal aliens. Democrats continue to put illegal aliens above citizens.
Based on Biden and "his people" the black have only one vote.
Definition  of Joe Biden.
There should be no mail in voting prior to the presidential debates or the announcement of Joe Biden's running mate. The choice of Biden's running mate, is as important as his performance,  during the presidential debates. All mail in voting should be disallowed! TRUMP 2020 🇺🇲🇺🇲
Biden is a hateful old man with dementia.
Must not be because they have been under constant media and political investigation since President Trump announced his candidacy. nothing has turned up. He’s no saint but he loves and cares for the American people - Biden is anti-American in actions and policies
Biden doesn't need to knock on doors,or sign up voters. Their plan is to CHEAT.
The NRA trains people of all colors how to use firearms safely. NRA fights for our rights in court,so we don't have too. Chicago has the strictest gun laws in the country. How's that working out? Senile Biden will never be president.
Come’on Dems—what are you suggesting we do differently?  All stores and public places require masks, hand sanitizer is everywhere, 6 feet reminders all over. COVID is here to stay for a long time. Got to try to live with it. Biden won’t make one iota of COVID difference.
Really? That’s all you can say? How about Biden’s brother is a murder? Biden’s son is a traitor to the country and Biden is corroupt and illegally spied on Gen Flynn and President Trump not to mention Biden being a puppet for China
They just want Biden in office so they can declare victory and pretend like all the racism, misogyny, and homophobia just magically evaporated.  There ain’t no long haul left in America.
Gun Expert Joe Biden Advises His Wife To Illegally Discharge a Shotgun
Much more accurate than a poll showing Biden up 15. The worst case scenario would be a 5 point loss. You are fooling yourself if you think it will not be close.
Twitter and now FB keep removing content/ads from President Trumps accounts due to complaints. It's time for Trump supporters to start looking at every ad and tweet from Biden/Campaign and start complaining by the thousands to FB &amp; Twitter until they take that content down.
SENATOR   do you really believe the Democrats are going to stop any of their efforts to derail the election and Biden just because YOU SAY "STOP" Please! Get a spine and push back for a change.
REALLY? Democrats planted false stories in effort to derail Biden investigations, Grassley says  via
Truth   I agree with Joe Rogan about Biden.   “A large group of people are very uncomfortable with a man who seems to be mentally compromised winning the election and doing so by hiding."
You stop giving Biden a break for racist behaviors. STOP.
So you like an ad where Biden steals  Trump's Made in America talking points after he talks about his gas guzzling  Corvette then says he wants to change to electric cars the same electric cars that turned out to be a flop under Obama's admin after they gave him a ton of money.
If Biden mistreats black men that interview him with a condescending short tempered attitude then I can only imagine how he's going to treat his black female VP pick.   Sad!
Biden asked a black man that was interviewing him if he smoked cocaine after he asked him a question he didn't like.   It was Joe's son that was kicked out of the military for cocaine abuse.
Everytime Biden has lost his cool with a reporter/interviewer lately they've been black. Curious isn't it?  He also poked a black man in the chest.
Agree! Does anyone really believe that Biden will be able to find someone more corrupt or incompetent than what we have now?!
Biden should bow out and let these two run
Wait until Biden's VP is announced...
Joe Biden will absolutely clean up your mess.
Biden is scared and will hide in basement all the time.
Breaking News: Biden will no longer travel to the DNC in Milwaukee.
Agree - should def be considered for a top job if Biden gets in.
I don't like Joe Biden but by keeping him propped up when he's clearly in cognitive decline  shows how evil the Democrats are and how far they'll go to regain power.
What an idiot Biden is. Nothing in 45 yrs?
Biden has no original thoughts. When he does try to muster one up he becomes a stumbling, bumbling fool!

How about learning your facts - mail in voting is NOT the same as absentee voting. And the Postal Union is backing Biden.
Please stop honoring the haters in the media hour long interviews  while Biden hides behind Jill. The media just flip your words as you give them higher than they will ever get viewership.  Give them 15 minutes no more.   Press conferences limit questions.
Joe Biden is to scared to appear outside his house!
That has nothing to do with the way Biden looks. I've seen all of his so called speeches. He can barely read from the teleprompter but if he's your guy good luck with him.
My grandmother died from a form of Dementia. I know the look she had in her eyes. Biden's have the same look but good for you for taking this opportunity to inject Trump into the conversation.
I don't understand why people can't see Biden's obvious cognitive decline. Look at his eyes. They're totally empty.
You are correct.  Maybe these people will crawl back in their holes after we elect Joe Biden. His attack on an unsuspecting kid was violent and cowardly.
Go High! Vote for Biden 2020! Biden supports Education, Housing, Justice and Jobs.
Biden is a mess! Pure and simple!
I said this last week. Fact is, Dems don’t want Biden to debate and will come up with excuse after excuse why he shouldn’t
I will be voting but there is no possibility that I will vote for Biden or any other democrat.
Wow. I forgot about that. Now Biden is being spoon fed his questions too.  Like a baby. If you can’t win on your own merits, cheat.
Biden calling in sick for the Presidential debates will have the same consequences as Hillary’s “deplorables” snipe. It would be what he is most remembered for.
Biden never could get his Obama thoughts ahead. That's why he  was VP. He was controlled.
Monkey County....next third world shithole county over from where I grew up in PG County. You couldn't pay me enough to live in communist Maryland. I dunno how my brother does it. Sadly his wife is a Biden Zombie too
I would live to see  as  VP pick.   The only problem is that I would love to see her as Biden's Attorney General more.
Why is Dr.Biden doing more interviews than the candidate?
In all seriousness, my grandmother died from dementia. I saw the empty look in her eyes become more and more apparent as it progressed. Biden's eyes look the same.
Sounds like an interview to learn about some issues Joe has from health problems to policies he'd implement that would destroy hundreds of thousands of jobs...... NOT   said when she interviews Jill Biden she plans to ask her about all the attacks on her husband.
Biden's cognitive issues become more and more apparent with every passing day.
They will, if we elect Joe Biden in a landslide.
Because Biden would fail at open debates. He has a hard time finishing a sentence.
What the Trump/Biden debate will look like 😂😂😂
At 32 seconds he says, “No, we’re going to beat Biden fair and square here.”
Change of plans: Biden will likely not pick his VP this week. His campaign will be extending their vetting process for up to two weeks.
We don’t.  That’s why we will vote for Joe Biden in numbers never before seen in our nation. Trump will drag you and many others in your dead party down with him too.
Biden's cognitive issues are becoming more evident every day.
We need 4 more years for Trump to repair the damage done by Obama and Biden the 8 years that they were in charge. In fact we need Republicans to keep the radical leftists Democrats from destroying our country.
If Biden believed in science he wouldn’t be running for President. The science is clear-  does not have the cognitive ability to serve as President of the United States.
Joe Biden needs to be put on a health care plan to give him support for his dementia. Can't believe that his family is allowing him to continue with the campaign.
Many of us did not want Biden. But, right now...at this moment, our country is in serious danger. There is no escaping this danger with another 4 years of trump! The 1st step towards democracy is getting the authoritarian wanna be out of office!

Don't talk about Obama or Biden even if it's you're just repeating what Obama's brother said because your tweet will get suppressed.  If you're not kneeling praises to them your voice doesn't count.
Malik's (Obama's brother) take on Trump, Biden, and Obama:  Trump is not fake. Trump is bold, fearless, and tough.  Biden is old and feeble. He looks like his teeth are falling out.  Obama is cold and ruthless. He's a snob that wants everyone to worship him.  Malik endorsed Trump
Not worried about a delay. The Democrats have proven just how corrupt they are and I am afraid that they are rigging an election. We could have a president in Joe Biden that can not complete a sentence on his own.
Horses know crazy and will kick the crap out of you too. And they never heard of Trump or Hide’n Biden.  So they are an impartial jury.
Dementia is getting worse with Joe.
Soon to be President Biden.

Biden reminds me of a cross between: Mr. Magoo, Herbert The Pervert and Ted Kennedy.  Trump reminds me of Harry from Home Alone and Vince McMahon (the character)...  So it's the creepy touched/sniffer with Dementia vs. the ravenous angry New Yorker guy with a "kiss my ass" club..

has more empathy and compassion than  could ever have or understand.    Biden is a man whose known great loss is and can truly be empathetic.
And the hole gets deeper......Just because Biden says Trump is a racist, doesn’t make it so.  You have to observe and listen to a candidate and decide for yourself.  Well that was sure easy!
So selective religious sin is for Trump who claims to be Christian but doesn’t go to church except for photo opts vs Biden a practicing Catholic.    I have nothing against any religion.  I have issue with those that think their religion is better than others.  THAT’s judgement.
Out of over 140,000,000 people that over the age of 35... Trump and Biden are really the only two options that we the people could put forward as presidential candidates... 🤦‍♂️
YOU are the one pointing out which party has more athesist and shutting down worship which is about religion and not political agenda.  And yes, I’m going to point out his faults if he’s going to accuse Biden of not being religious.
Lol Biden what state are you in? Guam!
Once again at each phase the pundits under estimated African-Americans. Before it was Sanders &amp; Biden, it was black folk wouldn’t vote for white men. Younger minorities eventually supported the Dem nominee. In Georgia, the Dems exceeded the Republicans during the primaries by 24%
I guess you'd rather watch a Biden interview?? Where he constantly says racist things.  Poor kids can be just as smart as white kids- said Biden, if you don't vote for me then you ain't black- said Biden.  While Trump has done more for Americans than any president in the past
Why do I think this is a microcosm of the entirety of Joe Biden's presidential campaign?  "Earlier today, I fvcked up. But I didn't mean a word of it. So, trust me, don't believe a word that comes out of my filthy mouth, and know that I have your best interest at ... uh ...
I've been on that soapbox for weeks asking for Trump and Biden to submit to MRI brain scans to end the speculation.
Get off the family computer Mrs. Biden
Trump the three times married, adulterer, lying, cheating, thief who stole from his own children’s charity but his blindly religious believers find no fault in him but can claim Biden isn’t religious.
It’s painfully obvious that Biden doesn’t write these tweets. Someone should ask him if he even knows twitter exists.
Virginia mayor urged to resign after saying Biden picked 'Aunt Jemima' as his running mate
They need a far better spoiler than this so called candidate.
They want you to vote now before you see how Biden bumbles.  He may actually forget his name...
Biden trying to walk back his comment. Not working out mammy Simone.
Really. Trump has been a good night president. Biden will be a dissolute. I like you but I think you have once again under estimated Trump.
Well Biden need to fight harder for the Black vote, and he failing in that so far. Would not bother me if Trump get another four years.
Biden got plenty of money from Ukraine and China he doesn’t need any. He might need more kids to rub the hair on his legs though.
Incredible. The mental gymnastics democrats are pulling to defend Joe Biden 'cause Orange Man Bad. I hate hypocrites. #JoeBidenIsARacist
Trump and Biden...that’s what we have to look forward to, America. Two ppl that have obvious cognitive issues are our main choices for President. Y’all thought we were fucked before....
SC. Voting for Biden and Jamie Harrison.
Guy has just lost his mind seriously. Its really comical and anyone supporting him could care less about this country. 😳 Biden walks back African American 'diversity' remarks, says he did not mean to suggest community is a 'monolith'
I challenge you to ask Biden to multiply 2x2
Trump writes his own tweets. Biden doesn't even know his own password.
VOTE REPUBLICAN! Or go Socialist! Biden is as racist as anyone else.
Trump hitting on almost all the fear mongering buzz words here. I think if he had mentioned that Biden was against freedom and flags, plus the free space, he would have had a full bingo card. 🤦🏼‍♂️
Biden needs to take office nov5.  Nov 4 trump and pence need to be escorted to jail.  It would be nice if Mitch went too.   Madame speaker gets to swear in biden😀
So not Joe Biden
Any vote that is not for Biden, is for Trump and will lead to the end of our republic.  Sorry, S.E.  This is not a responsible position.  I hope you will reconsider.
It was disgusting not funny.  How about my gif of Joe Biden going down mobile staircase into a fire! That was funny and true, you libbies are using Joe’s mental incapacity to gain power, can you say elder abuse?
This is a horrible take. If getting trump out of office depends on Biden’s vp pick for you, you are saying “eh, trump’s not so bad.”  People like you are a big part of the problem.
I am not sure how close it is, but I see some positive signs. For instance, my 75-year-old mother, who has never voted for a Democratic presidential candidate, intends to vote for Biden. She is not impressed with Lindsey because of his sycophant act.
Joe Biden is Edelgard irl
But if you're able to question Biden Christianity, we can show that Tre45on is not a Christian. Hell, he can't even quote his favorite verse. Why? Cause he didn't know any. How many Sundays has Tre45on attend mass? We'll wait for you to give us that tally.
Cool. Assume Biden is 20 points down always. #Vote
Yea, let's get the attorney general on this. Grow up.
Is anyone looking into “elder abuse” law violations by Joe Biden’s handlers? Seriously. I hope Joe has a designated healthcare power of attorney to make decisions for him, it won’t be long before a there’s a need to invoke it.
But it is related. Your boy is not a Christian at all. Biden is a better Christian then probably even you
Since we’re pushing college football back a week or so... why don’t we have a #Trump v. #Biden debate the first Saturday in September on  with the  as the moderators....
If he is on any ballot, he will siphon votes from Biden not trump. Don't believe all Biden supporters are dedicated.
Chris is a liberal and also clueless if he thinks Trump wouldn't debate Joe Biden under any circumstance. This is the biggest line of BS to date coming out of this lefty tool for the Dems.
He’s afraid of Joe Biden
I’d rather have Biden 🤷🏻‍♂️
I’m certainly not advocating, nor do I (lol) have Biden’s ear, but....I find ‘self among those who both “like and respect” Bass, simply from all I read and see.
Trump saying #Biden is against God is the same energy as the Religous Right attacking Jimmy Carter
Not Biden .
Biden is the perfect Manchurian candidate!
Catholicism is a 100% against abortion. Previously Joe Biden did not support abortion but now, because of a socialistic change in the Democratic Party, JOE has let politics pull him to something that's totally against his faith.

I am an Independent. In this election I hope for Harris, but will vote Biden in any choice of VP. Trump is a stain on America. I voted for Trump in 2016 and have rarely regretted any choice more.
This is the first positive I've seen for Biden
When is Joe Biden not being plastered for saying some stupid shit?!?! Def not fit, neither is Trump.

Biden admits it himself: "My time is up." Too bad his wife Jill permits him to self-destruct. Her dream to redecorate the W/House must be stronger than her love for him.
Vicky, I've watched Biden for decades. Was in national media in DC. He's has issues now. Trump isn't as sharp as he once appeared to be. Both he and Trump should end the speculation by submitting to MRI brain scans. Decrease in activity in prefrontal cortex sign of dementia.
the democrats had sixteen candidates, but Biden was picked for democrats just like Hillary was picked. If democrats like being told who should win your party, y’all have no individuality and no voting power. Glad to be republican!

If Biden/CCP gets in, it may come to be. 😞
I know man it’s driving me nuts. Even if you think Biden is far from perfect (he’s not my fav either) trump is so devatatingly divisive that another 4 years could ruin us imo. He’s a terrible human being that doesn’t even respect the country he represents. It’s sickening man.
Biden is the gift that keeps on giving for the GOP
Diversion to take the heat off of  Biden?
Who’s a bigger racist  or Biden? When you went to Yale, live in an all white liberal wealthy suburb, and you have never worked or socialized with a black person, you may have the strange notion blacks are different.  I understand now why you have “white privilege” guilt.
What a racist comment. I give Biden a pass, when you have dementia you really don’t know what your saying.  How sick is it that Biden’s wife and doctor are allowing this ruse to continue? Greed for money is one thing greed for power is pathetic and what we’re witnessing. Sad.
NOTHING Trump can say or claim in a debate can undo the lies, corruption, and damage he and his administration have done during his time in office thus far! Im with Biden all the way!
Biden is a centrist. He's barely left by any stretch. The fact that you even use the term "extremist left" tells me you've fallen hook line and sinker for conservative propaganda.

You are not voting for joe biden. you are voting for his V.P. it's the easiest way to guarantee the first black woman president. they will come out after he's elected, because, "anything is better than trump", and say he's senile and not fit to lead.

Lol holy crap we got a live one! Well enjoy, because Biden is gonna rule u and we are gonna make ur life miserable by giving u healthcare and doing other evil stuff like not imprisoning migrant kids.

Yes. It's really early for the polls to "tighten up" like that.   And it's way too early for the pollsters to start trying to play 4-D chess with the numbers, too.  Couple the numbers with Biden's sad press appearances ... the wheels are coming off.
Jim Crow Joe is a LIAR! He, along with every other democrat, berated Trump’s China ban, and even called it “hysterical xenophobia.” Joe Biden is a laughingstock, and should be in a home (or prison) somewhere, not running for the Presidency of the US.
Here's the link to the article and ... holy crap, man, please don't let this man be elected President.  It's not going to get better for him.
He would say the same things about Demings , Bass, and Lance-Bottoms if they were the favorites. No one who was already voting for Biden will choose differently if Harris is the VP. And she will be.

You know, I’d like to hear President Trump being given the benefit of the doubt. We hear Mr Biden’s statements cleaned up and ‘clarified’ constantly. Fairness is a wonderful attribute.
Does this feel like the GOP establishment are setting the table to harass Biden over international players interfering with the election?
ARIZONA GOV to BIDEN: ‘Come on Man, Get Out of Your Basement Joe!’
Trump said Biden ‘hurt God.’ Biden has spent his life drawing from his Catholic faith.
Those close to Biden encouraging (or even allowing) him to speak publicly, staged as a potential pick for next president, are cruel human beings. I oppose most of the principles he loves.  He is no hero. Regardless, his interviews are hard to watch.  Biden is clearly not well.
Once again, foot-in-mouth Biden speaks and pisses off a whole ethnic community!
Susan Rice is just another term of Obama - Biden just a figurehead for moderates.
Because they’ve been told to.   The media, like Biden, have beat the drum, “If you vote for Trump you ain’t black”

I like all of these women, but what has happened with   ? Biden VP race is highly fluid days before expected pick
At least Biden takes responsibility and apologize for his screw ups. You blame everyone in the world and never take responsibility or apologize. You’re a damn fool if you think you’re worthy of their votes, he’ll you’re not worthy of one single Vote.
It will also take the black vote away from the black republicans.  It won't only hurt Biden!

Biden is still searching for his record player...
If scripture indicates that the world will only get worse before Christ comes back then does keeping Trump in office contribute to the end game or does Biden take us closer. Because neither one of them can make anything better. Unless your idea of better is a worldly one.

Joe Biden said a little while ago, he was looking forward to tromping Trump on stage in the debates.  So, lets have one before September 1.  BEFORE anyone votes!  Go for it Joe!
But the great thing about Biden is he has really good relationships on both sides.  And he’s not too vain to listen to people smarter than him.   And he is humble enough to give others  credit.   He knows how to bring smart people and experts into the room
Biden did not apologize. He revised and extended his remarks.

Both Biden &amp; Pelosi flaunt their Catholicism while doing absolutely nothing about the murder of millions of children.   They certainly don’t exemplify what a Catholic is supposed to be!
Trump's claim that Biden is "against God" and a leftist pawn fall flat when you realize that Jesus Christ was a revolutionary in his time and was crucified for his beliefs.
Biden: Unlike African-Americans, Latinos Are 'Diverse'
Biden stepped in it again! He does this continuously. During an interview yesterday, he said that “Unlike the African American community with notable exceptions” the Latino community is an incredibly diverse community! This is what the Democrats do, they put people in boxes! Ugh

So selective religious sin is for Trump who claims to be Christian but doesn’t go to church except for photo opts vs Biden a practicing Catholic.    I have nothing against any religion.  I have issue with those that think their religion is better than others.  THAT’s judgement.
Out of over 140,000,000 people that over the age of 35... Trump and Biden are really the only two options that we the people could put forward as presidential candidates... 🤦‍♂️
YOU are the one pointing out which party has more athesist and shutting down worship which is about religion and not political agenda.  And yes, I’m going to point out his faults if he’s going to accuse Biden of not being religious.
Lol Biden what state are you in? Guam!
Once again at each phase the pundits under estimated African-Americans. Before it was Sanders &amp; Biden, it was black folk wouldn’t vote for white men. Younger minorities eventually supported the Dem nominee. In Georgia, the Dems exceeded the Republicans during the primaries by 24%
Notice the #MAGA grifters never admit they are black until after a Biden gaffe.  Now all of a sudden they become black and scream racism.  Any other time it doesn't exist and they aren't black, their American.
I guess you'd rather watch a Biden interview?? Where he constantly says racist things.  Poor kids can be just as smart as white kids- said Biden, if you don't vote for me then you ain't black- said Biden.  While Trump has done more for Americans than any president in the past
Why do I think this is a microcosm of the entirety of Joe Biden's presidential campaign?  "Earlier today, I fvcked up. But I didn't mean a word of it. So, trust me, don't believe a word that comes out of my filthy mouth, and know that I have your best interest at ... uh ...

So not Joe Biden
Any vote that is not for Biden, is for Trump and will lead to the end of our republic.  Sorry, S.E.  This is not a responsible position.  I hope you will reconsider.
It was disgusting not funny.  How about my gif of Joe Biden going down mobile staircase into a fire! That was funny and true, you libbies are using Joe’s mental incapacity to gain power, can you say elder abuse?
This is a horrible take. If getting trump out of office depends on Biden’s vp pick for you, you are saying “eh, trump’s not so bad.”  People like you are a big part of the problem.
I am not sure how close it is, but I see some positive signs. For instance, my 75-year-old mother, who has never voted for a Democratic presidential candidate, intends to vote for Biden. She is not impressed with Lindsey because of his sycophant act.
Joe Biden is Edelgard irl
But if you're able to question Biden Christianity, we can show that Tre45on is not a Christian. Hell, he can't even quote his favorite verse. Why? Cause he didn't know any. How many Sundays has Tre45on attend mass? We'll wait for you to give us that tally.
Cool. Assume Biden is 20 points down always. #Vote
Yea, let's get the attorney general on this. Grow up.
Is anyone looking into “elder abuse” law violations by Joe Biden’s handlers? Seriously. I hope Joe has a designated healthcare power of attorney to make decisions for him, it won’t be long before a there’s a need to invoke it.
But it is related. Your boy is not a Christian at all. Biden is a better Christian then probably even you

Catholicism is a 100% against abortion. Previously Joe Biden did not support abortion but now, because of a socialistic change in the Democratic Party, JOE has let politics pull him to something that's totally against his faith.

Vicky, I've watched Biden for decades. Was in national media in DC. He's has issues now. Trump isn't as sharp as he once appeared to be. Both he and Trump should end the speculation by submitting to MRI brain scans. Decrease in activity in prefrontal cortex sign of dementia.

You are not voting for joe biden. you are voting for his V.P. it's the easiest way to guarantee the first black woman president. they will come out after he's elected, because, "anything is better than trump", and say he's senile and not fit to lead.

Jim Crow Joe is a LIAR! He, along with every other democrat, berated Trump’s China ban, and even called it “hysterical xenophobia.” Joe Biden is a laughingstock, and should be in a home (or prison) somewhere, not running for the Presidency of the US.

He would say the same things about Demings , Bass, and Lance-Bottoms if they were the favorites. No one who was already voting for Biden will choose differently if Harris is the VP. And she will be.

What  desperately requires to determine his cognitive status is a MRI brain scan. If he has signs of dementia the scan will show decreased activity in his prefrontal cortex. Both Biden &amp; Trump should do it since brain health is a big issue in 2020. End the speculation!

That’s certainly a defensible position. I happen to disagree. I did not think Obama was a “token” or pandering at all. He was unexperiened, but that’s not always bad, and he had real talent and charisma. He was the real deal. Harris feels like a handout, and Biden said as much.
As if any one needed another reason not to vote for Hiden' Biden!
Other than the part about Biden driving the relationship in the White House (I think it would be more mutual), these paragraphs ring true to me.

And that's exactly what Harris is. Biden announced well in advance that he was intentionally choosing a woman of color. Forget personality, credentials, policy. Nah. It has to be a woman of color. That doesn't seem condescending to you?
Cause like it or not, it will be Biden or Trump. There is no third choice. Be angry or be angry AND plot a move forward.
Harris did awful things which she owned. Can you work with her and Biden or Trump? Thsts the question.
I'm sorry, the persuade idea is bunk. Look at BLM over the last few months, how many demands for reform made it into the DNC platform? Look at Biden / Obama's response to standing Rock and Occupy.  No, it's a tactic to quell dissent, you're either doing it willingly or just naïve

Congratulations again on being a delegate &amp; such wonderful news on it being a Biden-Harris ticket.
In 20-30 years, in the same way we see ads from Biden/Markey about being the sons of working class people, we're going to see similar ads in the upstate from the liberal children of manufacturing workers like BMW. Mark my words.
And then the using of people make me sick. Some fault Biden as a racist but the majority of black people don't think so. So why keep that tone?
Nope. But he's more concrete than green and u can get things accomplished in a Biden administration. But you don't want that, do you?
🎉🎉🎉They do,my lib-in-law said not only will Biden win and it will be a landslide-but she is leaving town as Trump peeps are going to riot. When I asked how she felt when the inner city people rioted robbed destroyed stores in the city next to us: They were white supremacists.
If I am not mistaken Kamala Harris had to be vetted before she could be on the Biden/Harris ticket. Also, the POTUS is dealing from the bottom of the same deck that he used against President Obama. The whammy won’t work!!!!

I'm voting for Biden and Harris as a step in the right direction. Thsts MY solution. You do what you want or need to do.
Trump is FIXING the election, and the GOP looks the other way. All you say about Biden is an outright lie, Trump said He would cut payroll taxes, where do you think Social Security helping our seniors (if any are left 160,000 deaths) comes from
So Facebook fact checks a post about Kamala Harris’ grandparents owning slaves and says “it lacks context” not, it’s not true bc it is .. now they’re publishers!!! Biden is a plagerizer with his “possibilities “ piece from president Reagan .. they’re quite a pair!
I'm starting to get fall 2000 flashbacks. I can already hear Biden's concession speech after SCOTUS halts the NY / NJ absentee ballot counts because "it can't be assumed these voters evicted in Spetember will ever return to the city" or some shit and Trump wins both states by &lt;1%

Biden at 52% leads Trump at 40%.
Kamala Harris has often focused on her identity as a Black woman. But her selection as Joe Biden's running mate is putting the spotlight on her as the first person of Asian descent on a major party presidential ticket.
I do appreciate the moment. My grandma cried when Barack won. She always loved Biden talked about how handsome he was (She’s from Delaware.) She has since been radicalized and can’t stand Joe or Kamala. She’ll vote blue, it’s just been interesting to watch her change.
this #trump ad about the lady losing her job because of COVID and then saying Biden wants to raise taxes and is weak. Does someone wanna tell her that if Trump didn’t call COVID a hoax for three months maybe she would be employed?
Who’s going to tell the Biden team that if they embrace this position they win in a landslide?
I really think this is our future, sadly. Choosing who we dislike the least. Biden wasn’t my choice in the primary and neither was Harris. But I’ll vote for anyone to unseat the current administration. Politics is so ugly. Good people are going to shy away from it
I literally knocked on hundreds of doors in the Pee Dee before the primary and more than 80% were definite Biden voters.

Sure, Biden won’t give us M4A, but shouldn’t we put ourselves in the best position to keep it if someone runs on it in 2024 and is able to pass it during her tenure?  Same with GND or voting rights
A lot of this depends on how you think the electorate (actual voters) in Michigan, WI, and PA have changed since 2016. If *it’s at all to the left* (even a real difference of a 1-2 points left) a 60-70% odds of Biden victory seems understated.
I'm not a Kamala apologist, I literally just fact checked that tweet. That's all. I'm not voting for Biden/Harris. Period. But I have to say: If Facebook is the platform for disinformation, then I'm inclined to say, Twitter is the platform for misinformation.
Maybe if you're just upset about this election work on your state elections or run for office but please don't go out of your way to convince people to not vote for Biden/Harris. If you vote third party or chose not to vote you are complicit if trump wins again.
Y'all, I want to believe. I would love for you to change my mind and get me excited about Biden/Harris. Yes, they'll be better than Trump. That's a given. What I'd really, really like is for someone to give me more than that.
Like I get that this isn't the ticket I wanted and I have OPINIONS but I'm going to vote for Biden/Harris and I'm not going to disparage the only thing that is going to get Trump out of office.
I was going to vote for Biden, but Kamala Harris' toxic online supporters have made that impossible. I have to question the judgement of the candidate who picked a running mate responsible for such disgraceful behavior. #KHive #KamalaHarrisForVP
Racist stuff after posting a video calling Biden racist. Don’t forget that  I hate it here
Pence is a wet noodle and he's as unfit for VP as Trump is for president she will eat him alive. I always said she has to be the VP, can't wait to come back to travel in the US under Biden/Harris leadership.
When people said Joe Biden had chosen Bran as his VP, I thought they meant bran, not Bran. I think mine is way funnier.
which is the majority. All of the things Obama did for lower &amp; middle class communities Biden played a role in that &amp; Trump went in office and tried to reverse all of it. Obamacare for example.
I get that but I feel like people putting too much energy into why folks shouldn’t vote for Biden/Harris when we literally have a full blown racist narcissistic criminal in office...like I get her point but what is the purpose
The Supreme Court seats alone are reason enough. Not a fan of Biden but y'all are asking a lot from Ruth Bader Ginsburg if Trump wins again. The SC could be what sets us back literal decades if he fills any more seats.
Of course you'd use this dumb meme, but let's make one thing clear. Trump doesn't need your vote to win, he won without it last time. Biden however, does need your vote. If you choose to throw it away by voting green, then you have assisted Trump. It's not hard to understand.
Why do republicans keep laying out more reasons to vote for Biden/Harris?

Don’t know about the Harris comment. Am aware of the latter. God bless America for these being the options. I’m still planning to vote 3rd party unless it looks like Biden has a shot at SC.
What's hilarious is that I WISH some of the stuff Republicans are saying about Biden/Harris were true. It would make me WAY more enthusiastic about a, frankly, out-of-touch ticket. And no one's even buying this line because everyone knows it's false. They're floundering hard.
i don’t like biden or kamala but i feel like if they don’t win our country is gonna turn into a totalitarian regime and i hate it
Well I don’t think Biden will piss off every country in the world so there’s that.

People are dying, the earth is dying and for 8 of the last 11 1/2 years Biden was in the White House. How will putting him back change anything?
unfortunately, if you want Trump out of office Biden/Harris is the only way. It sucks we’re forced to that decision but voting for independents is equivalent to voting for Trump even if the intention is pure.
Within minutes of the presumptive Democratic nominee's announcement Tuesday, false information was circulating on social media, claiming that Harris had called Biden a "racist" and that she is not eligible to be president.
You can’t even get your local council person who taught you in 8th grade to stop putting rails on street benches but somehow y’all are about to strongarm the Biden/Harris White House? Lol okay.
But go ahead and gripe about how Biden/Harris isn't "progressive" enough. 😠😠
You know she was selected to be Biden’s Vice President right? So that would make it BIDEN Vs Trump. 🤦🏿‍♂️
In short even if you hate Biden and Kamala they are rational enough to pick sound people for these positions
The silence after Biden asks if she’s ready to get to work - as Harris processes that she’s earned the spot on the ticket - gave me chills.
Obama ran on a hope and change platform. Even he didn’t get held accountable for crushing the public option, bailing out Wall Street, drone strikes, spying on citizens, beefing up the deportation machine, failing to prosecute killer cops.. Biden doesn’t even have a hope platform.
Biden like Pelosi claim they’re Catholic but they are both pro abortion - The Catholic Church has already refused Biden communion - this argument is null and void
Listen, it’s not my position or my argument. I’m just answering the question. I agree that Biden was not shoved down Dems’ throats the same way Hillary was in 2016.  That said, I can still entirely understand why this whole ticket is more than disappointing to the Left.
It's the combo. Biden bothers me on a lot of levels, and I was hoping he'd pick someone progressive (and a woman of color) as a VP. Instead, he picks Harris with her history of supporting corrupt cops and prisons. I think we need change and Biden/Harris isn't it, in my opinion.
"a man as electrifying as a dollop of mayonnaise." 🤣 Column: Biden picks Kamala Harris. Trump should dump Mike Pence and replace him with a yacht.
What’s really missing from this narrative is that essentially Harris and Biden didn’t really even differ on the issue she called him out on in the first place.
I think Biden can talk much more coherently than Trump. Just get a transcript of any of of his non prompter speeches. You can never figure out what he is saying. And Trump constantly has verbal gaffes. Trump is toxic, and needs to go. Biden at least has decades of experience.
Harris is not as far left as I want her to be, but ngl, seeing Ben Shapiro this triggered is a major selling point.  Same reason I want Biden to win tbh.  He won’t do m4a, but not having Trump in office will trigger Ben Shapiro types and that’s enough for me
Shit... Biden just fucking handed Trump the presidency.

another ad idea: Biden chose a California liberal as his running mate. Is this the future you want for America? Put up image of riots and Kamala stating her support for defunding the police. They support taking your guns, your right to protect yourself and your family.
Also remember that there’s no right now to get enough people to mobilize to vote in a third party so while both Biden and Harris have done things we don’t condone we need to at least get trump out of office and then we can take on the other battles.
I wonder if Mike Pence can feel confident that the POTUS will not drop him in favor of Haley as his new running mate so that he can trump the Biden/Harris ticket? I wouldn’t be surprised if Pence gets the axe. After all that is the POTUS’ style.
I’ve been a little out of touch lately, but serious, non hostile, curious question: why do you object to this ticket? Is it Harris or Biden or the combo?
Is this a joke about Biden's likelihood to die?
Black folks voted for Biden because he is the best choice to beat Trump. Harris's record will be an asset. Not a liability.
i'm only voting for biden/harris because more fedsoc supreme court justices appointed by trump will further eviscerate voting rights and make this process even less representative of the will of the people than it already is. i'm still going to complain the whole time.
Biden didn't pick Kamala, he was picked for her. He was made the nominee when it was clear she would never win on her own merits.
Now attack her not Biden. She's the target.
You're right. Biden better watch his back. But I think he'll be talked into retirement within 6 months if elected. Then she'll pick Michelle Obama as VP.
Mine is how the media had a big launch event &amp; the CA party moved the primary, all so she could have an unassailable lead &amp; be the presumptive nominee by Super Tuesday. But she was so unpopular they had to fix the primary for Biden and install her as VP instead.
Still too many hardcore trump supporters bro I don’t see Biden winning at all especially if he starts talking
Biden might forget what year it is

If I had to guess I think people are more mad at having to settle for Biden than her. Because that’s definitely a settle.

This team will bring real leadership to our nation. One of the biggest threats to our children's education is the current health crisis. I look forward to the strong direction the Biden/Harris Team will create within public education, providing a safe place to learn and grow.

Oh cause I thought someone who didn’t vote last term said something about me voting for Biden this term.
Some conservatives are so fake. To them, it was smart that Trump picked Pence to appeal to conservatives. But supposedly Biden is racist for picking Harris. to appeal to black women. BOTH are the base of each party.
It's as if Biden should have chosen a running mate who would bring in new voters?
Watching Open Phones on Joe Biden Vice Presidential Announcement
yeah but she was still 100x better than biden and kamala. i didnt feel anywhere near as miserable voting for her as i will in november
Biden selects Sen. Kamala Harris as running mate   #KamalaHarris
I maintain the position that I will vote for Biden as damaged goods but will not try to convince anyone else to do it  and do not blame anyone who does not lol
. reacts to Kamala Harris being chosen as Joe Biden's V.P. running mate.
I'm voting because I think Biden is less damaging than Trump, but I don't blame anyone for not voting for Biden if they don't want that on their conscience.  And no, not voting is not a vote for Trump.
he's biden; if you were expecting him to pick anyone very far to the left, you were setting yourself up to be disappointed
Biden &amp; Harris  The most radical, unimpressive and least accomplished ticket EVER!!
Nonsense, Jack. Lieberman didn’t resign his seat in 2000, Kerry didn’t retire his seat in 2004 (though Edwards did), McCain didn’t retire his seat either time, neither did Palin, Obama, or Biden in 2008.  Where did this silly idea come from?
Sen. Kamala Harris is the first African American woman to be on a major party’s presidential ticket. --- READ MORE &gt;&gt;
Poll: Biden leads Trump by 10 points nationally #BidenLandslide2020 #BidenHarris2020
Women throw themselves at weathly people. These allegations on this article you posted are all hearsay that Trump denies. Biden didn't even deny his accusers claims.
Biden leads among all genders and age groups. #BidenLandslide2020 #BidenHarris2020
That whole article is hearsay. We've seen on video multiple times Biden groping young children. Take responsibility oh your boy Biden.
An Alabama delegation of Black women visited Doug Jones in DC after his Senate win. They came to hold his 👞👞 to the 🔥on certain issues - they had his 👂.  The same happened in 2020 - Black activist women visited Joe Biden, calling for a Black woman running mate. He listened.
So therefore I will be voting for Biden and Kamala. They don’t have the best track record but they are 1000x times better than Donald Trump. Trump is single handidly destroying America. He must be voted out! Him and his trump staff has to go IMMEDIATELY
I don’t trust Biden or Kamala. Both have been on the side of destroying black families over the course of their political careers. HOWEVER! This election isn’t about who is the best candidate it’s about who will save us from complete and utter destruction of this country...
Too close to call, Supreme Court pulls a King Solomon with the country which Biden wins because he's too confused to understand what's happening.
To be clear: Joe Biden was/is boo boo, but nobody disputes that.
So Kamala believes Biden's sexual assault victims but is okay accepting his pick as his VP? How can socialists not see the hypocrisy?
I swear if Donald gets re-elected bc y’all don’t like Joe Biden’s VP I’m dead ass moving fr this time
Good on you for that! Respect. Also, I get the feeling it’s 4 years for Biden and then Kamala gets to run in 2024. Unless someone else blows up. But I’m thinking she’ll get the nod if she does a good job at VP.
Biden had to be a running mate that could be the heir apparent for 2024. Under these circumstances, I don't see how he could've chose differently.  I guess I'll turn in my Left Twitter card now.
How can any thoughtful Democrat vote for the Biden/Harris ticket? #MAGA2020
I’m voting Biden and Harris easiest choice
If Biden wins there will magically be a Covid vaccine out of no where and all the credit will be given to Biden. We just need to make it to November 3rd. The left will do anything to get Trump out even killing thousands of people and shutting down the country bc of a "pandemic".
Lol we have the NY Times calling her a pragmatic moderate. Senators Cornyn &amp; Graham calling her fully in on "the progressive/liberal left."  Just like w/ Biden, they don't know how to frame her. If you're on the defense w/ a muddled message you lose. GOP will lose.
I still haven't gone to the Biden-Harris store yet. Need to tonight.
Also ask her if she still believes Biden is a racist
That was the point Scooby Doo  Didn’t your pappy literally just say that Biden was running as a “transition”.  That he was going to get someone in the door and have a seat.   It’s like you’re stupid or something.
She’s not black. Biden and Kamala just released their slogan!  Kneepads and Peepads 2020!
It’s a Biden/Harris 2020 for me dog
Kamala Harris stated she believes Joe Biden’s accusers and took the VP position anyway........
This story needs to be told more often. Biden world is a loyal bunch. Always has been.
Lindsey Graham and swing state GOP senators are livid. A Biden-Harris ticket absolutely helps candidates like Jaime Harrison and other downballot races in South Carolina, and I'm sure in many similar ones.
Democrats: “the confederacy lost the civil war. Get over it.” Also democrats: “Biden didn’t pick [person], so I’m out.”
Before the end of the week they'll be saying,  "OK. Sure. Biden can't actually be pushed Left, but Kamala...'' #VoteBlueNoMatterWho
Very interesting that I got integrated by Tweeter after posting a mild response to Biden’s VP pick. They now know I have a postgraduate degree and can think for myself. I don’t care about having followers and only support LEO and conservatives. Guessing I’m about to loose some.
Actually you know what my one take is that I’m homophobic against gay politicians and I’m glad Joe Biden is too
It did not take the last of hiding racists long to come out of the closet after Biden's announcement today. Whelp. I'd rather know who my enemies are.
There it is. The vacuity of the Biden Harris pitch laid bare: Trump is even worse than Hitler. That's patently ridiculous, but it is funny that Trump will ultimately be blamed for all of this.  Serves him right too.
What's so bad about four more months of... *squints*  ...could literally be Biden/Hit... oh.     Welp, I'm ready to diminish and go into the west now.
Is Biden sniffing your wife?
Well besides Joe Biden fucking up Apple doing a 4-1 stock split
All of this is happening because Biden won the deep red state of South Carolina with the help of Big Pharma Jim Clyburn
Now I need my BIDEN HARRIS sticker.... website has nothing!
I answered your question. You haven't answered mine. Do you believe Biden's accusers?
Sure. Why not? Trump being a creep doesn't make Biden not a creep, though. You seem to be assuming that pointing out Biden's sexual assault/harassment makes me pro-Trump. I'm actually pro-non-rapey-candidates.
PUSSY interview. You let her say Joe Biden has been at event after event. Joe Biden has not answered a question this year! Be a FUCKING man!
Biden voted for the Defense of Marriage Act in 1996. Gays for Biden is comparable to Cows for Slaughterhouses
not him having “gays for Biden” in his bio 🥴
What blows my mind about Kamala Harris:  ran on a platform attacking Joe Biden &amp; seemed to embrace Bernie.  She ran out of $ and dropped out.  Cozied up to Biden &amp; the old DNC to keep her political career ($$) going.  She's not Left, she's as establishment as you can get.
And Kamala Harris called Biden a racist in the debates. What’s your point again?
Congratulations to Senator Kamala Harris for being selected as the Democratic VP choice by Democratic Presidential Nominee Joe Biden! Historical moment! I am all in and ready for the moment!!…
what if biden tried to hire pence out from under trump like katy perry did with taylor swift’s backup dancers
For those that don’t like Kamala &amp; keep saying “Didn’t she lock up black people?” ...ok. So I guess Trump releasing tear gas on black people who are peacefully protesting is better? Listen. Like Biden/Kamala or not, but At this point, you gotta pick your poison bro. Vote or gtfoh
I’d love if the Press covered Biden picking Harris more than Trump’s obvious attempt to steal the headlines with recycled outrageous lies.
But of course and Blotus just said the same thing about Obama Biden. Very stale
The first journalist who gets to interview   needs to ask her if she still believes Biden's accuser(s).
If you’re not ready to support Biden/Harris 150% then gtfo here. 👋🏼
I am starting to think I will live to see a woman win the Presidency in my lifetime now. I thought Hillary would but it would be close and that did not happen. Now I honestly think I’ll see it one day. A win here for Biden/Harris would be a major leap forward towards that.
biden said no❤️
If she comes in toward the very end (or Biden makes it) you're gonna have Pete/Beto/Klob/Warren all climbing back out of the woodwork, plus whoever fills the Bernie void and the party definitely doesn't want that.
Joe Biden should have picked Tulsi Gabbard. Id be closer to voting her as the incumbent president than I am for Kamala Harris.  If Dems that say "defend the police" know what they are talking about they won't support Harris.
Nia-Malika Henderson just shut down David Gregory , telling him he is mistaken in saying that Biden made a “safe” choice is choosing Sen. Harris.
Watching folks who paid lip service to “abolish the police” a mere TWO MONTHS AGO praise Joe Biden’s VP selection of Kamala Harris (the literal “top cop” as former AG)....I’m pouring myself another glass of wine. WHAT. IS. HAPPENING.
Definitely not voting for Joe Biden when he chooses Kamala Harris as his VP. Say good bye to your gun rights. Fuck that
Joe Biden is the one who didn't make a pandemic worse with bad leadership.
Mixed emotions. "Joe Biden selects Senator Kamala Harris to be his vice presidential running mate"
If Biden &amp; Harris win Nov. 3rd, just remember that it’s feet to the fire at all times. Let’s see marijuana legalization. Let’s see justice reform. Let’s see prison reform. Let’s see Medicare for all. Let’s see progress. We might be getting new faces, but if we don’t demand..
NEW:  says he's excited about Joe Biden choosing Kamala Harris as his running mate, saying this is exactly what Democratic voters in South Carolina wanted.
Kamala Harris 'honored' to be Joe Biden's VP pick
Biden picking Kamala Harris as his VP is a slap in the face to everyone that has protested in the past 60+ days
Johnson and FDR both passed actually progressive legislation. Those two - Biden &amp; Harris - haven't done shit yet.
The first journalist who gets to interview  needs to do us all a solid and ask her if she still believes Biden's accuser(s). Please make this happen.
The only positive things that Kamala Harris brings to the Democratic ticket are her skin color and gender, which she didn't choose. Besides that, she's just about the worst Democrat that Biden could have chosen.  This is the bottom of the Democratic barrel, folks. Not much there.
Ready for Biden Harris 2020!
I don't know about y'all but I think Biden's bringing back some change we can believe in ah-ohhhhhh😎
kamala Harris is a former CORRUPT District Attorney who sent a lot of innocent black men to prison.  All SKIN fold ain't KIN folk.  Biden THINK black ppl will vote for him now... WRONG!!!  Trump has a serious shot to win now more than ever. #kampalaHarris
Sooooo, Biden picks Harris v p mate. And the convention speakers next week will be all of the potential felons from the Russia and impeachment probe, including Russia's best friend  Bill Clinton. The dems are a joke, anyone who votes for numbnuts is is also a joke
So both my mentor and I found out that Biden picked Harris as the VP during our session.  I'm just going to try to remain open-minded because this is progress. How far it will go will be up to both of them and the nation to decide.
Right, like Biden's decision made any change to what you were going to do. Who the fuck do you think you're fooling?
She literally called Biden a racist, said she believed Tara Reid when she accused Biden of rape, prosecuted blacks disproportionately, and her family owned slaves. This is who the democrats think is gonna help Biden beat Trump? LOL
I just hope she keeps to her cop/prosecutor approach if and when biden tries to "turn the page" on the current administration's crimes without a solitary consequence. Because you know he will.
Jeez. I guess they at least need someone that will campaign because Biden has pretty much been the worst possible example of that. I know we are in a pandemic but he has had zero creativity trying to get his message across. I could have done a hundred times better lol
Biden announcing Kamala as his running mate is the nail in the coffin. 0% chance Biden wins now
Biden/Harris woohoo
The Biden-Harris website now.
Joe Biden would have been better off picking Michelle Obama at this point 😂😂
So, when Obama chose Biden as the nominee it was only because they literally couldn't install Harris at that point because she's had to drop out long before the first vote was even cast. I love a "Democratic" party.
Soon as I get a paycheck I’m donating to Biden/Harris.
2 of the biggest moments I remember from the debates were when  roasted  on busing (integration) and when  eviscerated Harris for witholding exculpatory evidence for a death row inmate (a punch Biden tried to land but couldn't). #BidenHarris2020
I think Biden will give her a significant role in the administration.
Biden and Harris 🤦🏿‍♂️🤦🏿‍♂️these two have got more blacks locked up than Trump 🤦🏿‍♂️🤦🏿‍♂️ I don’t see much good coming out of these two nuts together.
YES! Biden-Harris
Joe Biden has one job 🤦🏿‍♂️🤦🏿‍♂️

He wasnt too stupid to realize what he had done.. He knew exactly what he was doing and I would put money on that Obama gave direct orders for Biden to do that!!! The Taliban gave up their leader and our President gave up Seal team 6...
. I know you will never see this but: - Legalize marijuana. - Release inmates on marijuana charges. - Consider and publicly discuss UBI at some level wink wink  - Expand Medicare to COVID related health issues. You will beat Biden.
Biden and the USPS are both living in the past.  The USPS needs an overhaul and Biden needs a rest home.

Yeah and what Biden and Harris will do for black people if elected??? I have not seen anything yet that make me want to move the needle. Need to do more besides saying Trump needs to go.
Joe Biden sounded like he was threatening the country. I certainly didn’t like the way that felt the 1sr second I read it. It was instant jab in my heart
Here you go. Biden has a record so stop with the tears

Trump has never had an original thought. He always copies other people. Biden has a female running mate, now Trump will want a female running mate. Anything can happen. One thing we know for sure: Trump is impulsive and always shoots himself in the foot.

I've been asking, what is the top accomplishment of Joe Biden after nearly 50 years in public office? So far no one has tried to answer.
Love you buddy.  Biden will get out debates by contacting Covid at Dem convention. Basement ventilator shots. Kamala by his side. TV visits from Obama and Hillary. Med records confidential. How low can rep. go. Making fun of a sick man!
Hey love you brother.  I just figured out how Biden will get out debate. Catches covid at dem convention. Candlelight vigils with televised visits from Hillary Obama ets. Basement ventilator shots. HOw low can republicans go! Making fun of a sick man.
Biden doesn’t know who dressed him this morning 🙄
Joe Biden will give his acceptance speech at the nationally televised Democratic Convention next Thursday. Who else thinks Trump will try to steal Joe's thunder by dropping Pence from the ticket an hour before air time?
Riiiiiiight....... vote early before they debate and Biden shows everyone what a Dementiacrat he really is.
On the Dem side, "Fops for Biden."
Joins Twitter in 2020 as a Trumplican but claims to be a moderate Dem in profile.  So when did the Party move too left? Biden? You can’t possibly pretendTrump is a moderate Dem. So why still claim to be a Dem?
Of course. Like Obama, Biden will open the US Treasury (which is full of taxpayer money) to bail out his corrupt union bosses. Democrats are all about the grift.
I believe (rightly or wrongly) that Biden will do more to try and bring us together whereas I believe Trump will continue to throw fuel on the hate and divide fire. I am just one person, but that is what this election comes down to for me.
His country needs him to endorse Biden. I hope he steps up and does the right thing.

“Noooo you have to vote for Biden racist ass” -everybody quoting this man tweet
“The American people are living on the edge of death and economic despair...The press must look past the campaign coverage that was and embrace its role as a safeguard of democracy...not merely the horse race of candidates for high office.”
WHY KAM wasn't walking a respectful 1-step behind BIDEN??
. in a nutshell: - Ban everything from plastic straws, to fracking, and "assault weapons" by EO - Free HC and edu to illegal immigrants. - 70% tax rates - Does not believe sexual harrassment accusers - Lock you up for weed then laugh  If Biden wins, you get this.
That’s why it struck a w/ 45 nerve when Biden chose her.
The Biden campaign is going to be completely nuts?   And the Trump campaign with a dead guy stumping for him is...?
You realize you're voting for kamala, not biden right? He won't live to see 2024 at the rate he is declining
I will admit to getting goosebumps over the video of Joe Biden on Zoom asking Kamala Harris if "she was ready to go to work". It's time for all of us to get to work.
Check the wording on these tweets:     So is Biden planning on stepping down the day after inauguration? Or at the party that night?
No evidence Obama and Biden did anything to spy on the Trump campaign. No basis for the claim this is going to be a rigged election. Copy-paste, every night at 5:30.
You would want Biden not to have to debate. What  a hypocrite you are! Do everyone a favor and stop calling yourself a Republican. You sir are no conservative. Man up and change parties. Be honest for once!
DUMB AND DUMBER...  #kyla #KamalaHarris #biden #trump
Mr. Biden, it's awful nice for you to pitch in... but President Trump didn't even need your help with winning his second term.
Also interesting how you tacitly agree that Biden at least doesn't mind if I die due to crushing medical debt
Biden, Harris make first appearance as running mates

Meet your new VP candidate for the democrat party, Kamala Harris A Thread Who is Kamala? Why has the internet expeditiously removed crude memes &amp; hysteria since the recent announcement of the Biden/Harris ticket? Let's take a walk.
She will not stand a chance with or without Biden 😂
Biden doesn't stand a chance with his history of racism and your acting like Charlottesville will help you win the election 😂 Nice try divider!
I can’t wait for SNL to start the Kamala Harris and Biden best friends sketches with Obama trying to win back his best bud...
Can y’all wait until after the election to talk shit about Biden?   There are people on this bird app that are very impressionable, and they will assume that the volume of slander Kamala and Joe are receiving is an excuse not to vote.
The DNC’s gonna off Biden and “Weekend at Bernie’s” that ass until November.
Joe Biden and Kamala Harris' first remarks as running mates came with a clear message: President Donald Trump is a purveyor of crisis.Very impressive! She is perfect complement to "nice guy" Joe.  via
And I hear Adam Schiff is mentioned for AG if Biden were to win. The liar, creator of the whisperer of evidence? We can’t trust him! WAIT! We can’t trust any of them!
Can we expect your column about Biden mispronouncing the name of his own running mate?
Please copy-paste and distribute widely:  Senators Ron Johnson, Lindsey Graham, and Chuck Grassley are all working actively to spread Russian propaganda through the Senate against Joe Biden.  They should ALL resign NOW.  PASS IT ON.
Once Biden steps aside for "health reasons" this will be the Democrat ticket. Harris/Warren coming soon.
What happens now is to hold Biden and Harris accountable. They’re not getting off Scott free after trump and Pence are gone. Fight like hell to get Medicare for all and a green new deal passed

Except the logo biden is using is still on that page.
Absolutely. Do you recognize the logo below? It belows to Biden. It's on the page that they took down. You remember the antifa redirect to Biden page. They didn't clean up their tracks very well. Look at Biden's name on campaign ads. "B" with red lines for the E 👀👇👊
Joe Biden literally mispronounced her name TODAY at a campaign event. What do you have to say about that  I’ll wait for your response before I call you a hypocrite.
Do you recognize this logo? It belongs to Biden. When you typed in  it redirected to  It has been taken down except they forgot to take the Biden logo off the top of the page on the tab! Enjoy! #Trump2020Landslide
It has the site unavailable message when you go to it on a computer. I'm pointing out to people the trace of Biden left on the page when you click the link that redirects. Biden's Logo 😉
Kamala Harris Is the Right Pick for Every Reason That Should Matter  via
I want to see Biden debate
It was up all day until the last hour or so. There are plenty of screenshots as well as the Biden logo on the top of the tab for the page.
When you click the link it opens a new tab right? At the top of that tab you will see the "B" with the red lines. That is the Biden brand logo insignia.
He maybe a reporter but he isn't telling the truth if he is telling people that the link didn't go to Joe Biden dot com. It did. Integrity is lost in the press these days in my opinion!
Those assholes took the site down! Yes the biden kamala site.
Look at the Biden Logo. Biden has a set of red lines for the E. If you go to this site now, it has been taken down. BUT the tab at the top of the page has the capital "B" with the red lines behind it. That's the Biden logo on the  page.
Biden's logo is still on the top of the tap for that page! The "B" with the Red lines is part of the Biden brand. Biden uses the Red lines in his name. The E in Biden is the Red Lines!
To be fair, Joe Biden did reform criminal justice 😂
Everyone wearing masks except for the guy with the Biden equals abortion sign.
Biden, a 77-year-old white man, embraced the significance of naming the first Black woman to a major party’s presidential ticket.

She's projecting. The only way Biden will lose is if he doesn't run. The Trump Train is derailing and she knows it.
Look at the top of the site on the address bar. You will see Biden's insignia.
So by your logic being that all those white supremacist conservatives pick Trump because they see him as a vessel for their ideas.  All those marxists are siding with Biden because they see him as a vessel for their ideas  abolishing the police is an anarcho-communist idea btw
I never said he was a Marxist. I said the DNC has a Marxist problem, and they see Biden as a vessel.
I knew Biden was a racist! Not once today did he try to sniff Kamalas hair!
I was gobsmacked. She said, on air, that she doesn't think Biden will live to see Election Day? WTF
Also I think Biden loses AZ, GA, NC, OH, and probably FL, which would put Biden at 279 after he wins the usual states plus MI, MN, WI, and Penn
When I was watching Biden and Harris, I felt a sense of calm. Such a different feeling than when Trump is on tv.
Something tells me Joe Biden and Kamala Harris are going to create some "good trouble" for Trump. And John Lewis is smiling!
So did Joe Biden already know he was probably picking the woman who lost the primary when he said he thinks black people aren’t diverse?
Russian bounties is a false narrative. Iran had bounties on troops under Obama/Biden, BLM is literally a marxist organization (read their website, their founders are also Marxist), North Korea diplomacy has been at its peak, they weren't peaceful protests

The POC you seem concerned about went for Biden so overwhelmingly in S.C. they resuscitated a dead campaign, completely turned the tide, and gave him the nomination. Why? They trust him to beat Trump who they overwhelmingly “dislike”.
Excellent point. I am too. And the other thing the 4 of us have in common is there is no scenario imaginable where we don't cast votes for Biden-Harris!
Thank you. Now, if you lived in a state that had 0% chance of going to Biden AND refuses to allow mail-in ballots like I do, would those be good enough reasons to take off work and stand in line for hours to vote for him?
I am so, so glad Biden picked

This is foolish. Joe Biden and Dr. Jill Biden areCatholic and attend Mass at least once a week. I’d suggest you’re the one failing at Catholicism. Jesus said “Love one another.” #BidenHarris #Joe
On top of that... there’s really nothing concrete for her to apologize for. To my knowledge, she never actually voted for or pushed through any legislation in Congress that negatively impacts LGBT people. Biden, Hillary, etc. cannot say the same.
video is not out of context, it has his whole sentence. you liberals are the out of context kings. still hold on to the fine people quote out of context. biden repeated it yesterday.
Did he not stop all flights from China in January or was Biden just condemning him for it just for attention? Can democratic run cities not think and plan for themselves?
I guess if you want to say anything for Joe Biden, it’s that he never pretended to be a progressive. He’s awful, but he’s been consistent, and he never pretended to be someone who he is not. You can’t say that for his runningmate.
This Biden would be electric
They assume anyone left of center is an automatic Biden vote and are wilfully ignorant to any criticism of their "team." It's like arguing with a brick wall, except the brick wall doesn't have a block button or call you a Russian bot
Just cooked up this sick Biden edit on face app
First if he is truly a republican he would not be voting for Biden who wants America to become a socialist country. Second anyone can say they are a republican or Democrat on video. Where is his voter registration card that list his party afflicate? These videos never show that

Biden’s the only man in DC whose been friends with both Bernie Sanders &amp; Strom Thurmond. Gave Thurmond’s eulogy, and might have been ST only real friend in DC.

“He’s the first Democratic nominee since Walter Mondale in 1984 not to have an Ivy League degree.” That’s really a problem we need to address as a party. The elitism in our politics. As well as representation without substance. It’s not progress.

Focus on the ECONOMY!!!! If you don’t the socialists WILL WIN THE PRESIDENCY!!!!  Stop arguing w/scum media! Crush the domestic terrorists! Repeat the fact that Harris will be the President since Biden isn’t capable! Destroy their records! A Biden presidency is Obama’s 3rd term!!
Why are you are crying to see Beto talk? if he not let it be , Again if he does not talk what are you going to do on Nov 3, 2020? stop the ignorance and Cry like you and a lot like you did on 2016 and be for real now  It is not abut Beto Talk, It is about Biden defeat Trump!
Both Biden and Harris are going to love this, because it will give them an excuse to not talk about actual policies. It gives them something else to talk about, and gets them off the hook from answering tough questions. We can’t let that happen. This is a distraction.

I’m not okay with any of it, I know most people are voting for the lesser of two evils + I understand/support that. Personally I can’t co-sign Biden. We still got some time tho.
I think I'm gonna vote Biden/Harris just in hopes that they win and the slow creeping breakdown of our society takes a nose dive into the deep end of an empty pool and we can live in anarchy for a bit.

Had the same reaction after that debate. That braying laugh and extreme rudeness to every question. Talking over Ryan. Learned nothing from the debate but that Biden is a jerk.
This is totally awesome for Biden, because he would much rather talk about these “attacks,” than actual issues where he must take a position, like healthcare. He will eat this up.
Really? Even Trump and Biden don't take it personally. It's just business to them.
Remember when they tried to impeach him over a personal spat, and let all the much worse things slide.  All I could think at the time was, "Why are they dedicating time to this? It's not like Biden is a real candidate."

Shouting "Biden is your only choice," is not the hopeful message you think it is.
A lot of black people think Trump is racist because of what Democrat politicians and their friendly media say.   Biden said black people are a monolith and all think the same way on politics.  I was just mentioning some stuff you might not have heard.   Take care.
These are very important points. I also think it would be legit for Biden To come out and say, “hey, we did the best we could at the time. But looking back on it, it was misguided, and it didn’t work well, and it did real harm,” but that’s not his position. He stands by it.

Joe Biden has been been the go to speaker at every segregationist funeral the past 40 years.   That's part of the reason Kamala Harris called him a racist in the Democratic primary debates.

Did you know Biden has praised and spoke at the funeral of several segregationists to include Robert Byrd and  Fritz Hollings.  Byrd was one of the senators that filibustered the civil rights act.
Watch them change when Biden is president.
trump has turned back the clock on so many issues. Climate, healthcare, poverty, civil rights, immigration and much more. And it gets worse every day.  If Biden did nothing but stop the bleeding, that alone would be a win, would be reason enough to end the trump reign.

The difference between Biden’s racism and Donald’s is that Donald is intentionally appealing to the racism in our countries heart. Biden just can’t keep himself from saying what’s in his heart. Both are bad. One is worse.
Obv Kamala has problematic history, but she’s also got the energy and the teeth to balance out Biden’s age and geniality.  She gives their ticket a much-needed injection of adrenaline.
Not only can Joe Biden read and speak coherently, he knows how to sit in a chair.

Biden trolling Trump is my favorite thing today.
No. It is not. Not even close. It has NEVER been like this.  The trump position is far-right authoritarianism. Democracy won't survive another term.  Compared to trump, Biden is a big shift to the left. Not as far left as we'd like, but Biden WILL fix a lot that trump won't.
Is Kamala Harris eligible to be Joe Biden's VP?
Flat out false,  Biden's lying. Trump never said that. So when will you censor his Twitter account? Or are you just a lying political hack posing as a CEO?
Wow, thought it was a joke but definitely sends you to a Biden campaign site!
That’s a really good point.  I would like to see Biden choose some of the Republicans that have put country over party for members of his cabinet.  A good mix of progressives and conservatives would go a long way to showing the country that we need to move forward as one.
This start look like when Obama and Biden ran for POTUS &amp; VP in 2016!
LIVE NOW: Joe Biden and Kamala Harris speak for the first time since Biden named the California senator has his vice-presidential running mate for the 2020 White House race.
Ma'am, you think that Trump is a better choice than Biden. What you think of his running mate is as relevant as my thoughts on whether Trump should dump Pence for Haley or not.
This start look like when Obama &amp; Biden ran on 2016!
No. And we can't "write in" in SC. Wish we could. But I just can not vote for Trump or Biden.
Biden has empathy and listening skills in spades. I don’t know how willing he is to change his mind now, but he has clearly moved left over the decades.
Absolutely. They can easily get Kamala to, “get with the program..” That’s less certain with both Yang, and Castro. Although yes, it is notable that they both endorsed Biden. One would think they would have at least gotten speaking spots, therefore.
Funny how people are saying we should just "suck it up &amp; deal with it" when it comes to Biden when that's pretty much verbatim what T*#×p said about Covid.
Sounds like the old white dudes who don't like Harris are still at it. If Biden had preferred Warren, they'd be saying the same thing about her.   Sorry, not going to fall for this silliness. There's an election to win.
This is one way to react.   Or we can choose to learn from Elizabeth Warren's example, roll up our sleeves and get to work getting Biden/Harris elected. Warren doesn't sit home nursing sour grapes and neither should we. #LFG
I don’t. And Biden is not any better. He’s had 47 years to prove other wise. We are doomed.
You mistake criticism of Biden as support for Trump.
Happy, excited and relieved that, after 4 years of ignorance and incompetence, we get Biden and Harris! 😊😊😊❤️❤️❤️👍👍👍
Ignore ALL polls!  Make a plan to #Vote #Biden/Harris on November 3rd.  That’s the only way this nightmare ends!
Let's say Biden wins, and it's not that bad. In 4 years, we'll vote again, and our choices will be Biden &amp; another Republican.  Joe told you the truth. Nothing will change. You don't settle for the "lesser of two evils" because that's still choosing evil.
I understand that but I believe he won’t actively work against it like Trump has. No one wanted Biden. We are settling for Biden because 4 more years of Trump will be an absolute catastrophe.
I don’t disagree. What I’m saying is Harris was not the “progressive prosecutor” her campaign purported her to be. Not a Larry Krasner. Her tenure as AG was too supportive of police. Don’t get me started on Biden However I’m voting for them as they are better than the alternative
Scaramucci is still living with his 11 day head up his ass! Trump is going to chew Biden up and spit him out!
Yeah, you’re right! Biden is!!
Black people do not support trump. #You are straight up crazy.
Biden was baptized Catholic so he's Catholic. I guess that means Mike Pence is Catholic too.
I forgot Joe Biden was running for president lol
Also Jow Biden is creepy as well but I don’t believe he is on the same level as Trump.
I would love to see specifics on this.  Because Joe Biden has demonized minorities and the audio clips are out there for all to hear.
"BiDeN iSnT mY fIrSt ChOiCe"   ...okay, what is? I sure as hell know another four years of Tr*mp isn't mine. Please check yourself. #BidenHarris2020
Did you catch that? They are smashing windows of cars and pulling people out of their cars for non-compliance. Folks, get ready! This is going to get very ugly of Biden and Harris win the WH. There will be national lockdowns with the VP tyrant at the helm. Where are you papers?
Yeah, this is about fucking it. Not my first choice, but it’s the choice we’ve got.   If you don’t vote for Biden you’re voting for Trump.
We’re thrilled to have  as a panelist for “StraightTalk: Voting in America” on Sept. 1. Read her  op-ed about the significance of Kamala Harris as Joe Biden's VP pick.    Register for StraightTalk:  🗳
I just wonder if Biden Would / could actually pull a “Benedict?”  You should know what that means. 😉. In the middle of the first term. Does that mean we could still get a contested primary in 2024? I hope so.
OK yes, so I think what you were saying if Biden sticks with it, he would just be the nominee, but if he tries to just put Harris in there, it will be contested, so that’s good for us.
So you are for the same person that basically said Biden was against the Black Community and said she believed the women that accused Biden of inappropriate touching. Not to mention held evidence that would have freed a inoccent man until was forced to release it. Got it
An inspired choice! In choosing Kamala Harris to be his running mate, Biden has shown that our nation’s leadership must look like our nation. But we have to help them here in South Carolina. Clip in $5 today and help us flip our state blue. #AllIn
Golly gee, Mr. President. In between mending Little Johnny’s socks and laying out the newspaper for my dear husband, I will put my apron aside and vote for Biden before starting the evening pot roast.

Nah. You ever heard of the birthday party? Nah I’m playing 😂😂. Not trump and not Biden. Not saying that one of them won’t win if I vote a different way. But neither get my support
I wouldn’t be dismissive of their critiques. They’re valid. I have deep reservations. This is way too moderate of a ticket for me. “Representation” only goes so far if policy isn’t backing it up. That being said, I’m voting for the Biden/Harris ticket. The alternative is worse.Anyone who votes for Biden is insane at an obvious power grab to take away your freedom. He's absolutely pure evil.
I am so so sorry you are going through this and I am so glad you said what you said too. It’s a damn shame. Biden/Harris 2020
None of his traipsing around the stage either. If he steps out of his box when he's not on camera he loses. Biden could handle that kind of requirement. Donaldo couldn't handle it for more than 10 seconds. Also, drug testing for the candidates prior to the debate. Same deal.
No Biden can't say anything much about Camala as Biden says doesn't care because she's pure evil!
Grrrrr. I loathe Biden/Harris get out the popcorn!
Justice will come when Biden/Harris win in November.
I spent 7 weeks in Le Bonheur Children's Hosp. &amp; had to repeat 8th grade. It happens. As for Biden ... his speech impediment alone could've resulted in the repeat. But the guy overcame that, attended Syracuse Law School. He holds a Juris-Doctorate. That tells me he's a smart man!
You failed at making America Great at containing the Covid-19 Virus, so its no wonder Postal Workers Union supports  Biden/Harris!  🤠
A vote for Kanye is a vote for trump you idiots 😂 joe Biden may not be the best candidate but he sure as hell is better than the orange fuck in office

Former VP Biden leads Pres. Trump 45-44 in the latest poll released by the conservative Civitas Institute. The poll was conducted in the days before Biden announced Sen. Kamala Harris as his running mate and has a margin of error of +/-4 points.
All we hear from you is what will happen if Biden is elected. I have not heard what you would do if your re-elected. What would your major task be?
Biden calls for mandate requiring all Americans to wear masks  #FoxNews
Tell Joe Biden!!!!
For the next 3 months.  Biden calls for mandate requiring all Americans to wear masks
Local leaders are excited to have a woman of color as a vice president candidate. Here's what they have to say.
Now that  has learned to tweet from the grave, I guess we can expect Stalin, Hitler, Mussolini, Nathan Bedford Forrest, et al, to start slamming the great   ticket. #BidenHarris2020
PLEASE watch this and to Sean, and laura, &amp; Tucker, have Glenn Beck come on your show or at least direct people to watch this! This is what has started already and if Biden wins America is over!
Even Bin Laden in 2011 knew Biden as president would cause American crisis.  Interesting that  didn't want Obama to take out Bin Laden 🤔 almost like he knew their plans.
Democrats are close to matching, if not surpassing, the massive $300 million cash stockpile President Donald Trump and Republicans reported in July.
“She’s up to the task and that’s what I’m looking forward to,” Rep. Jim Clyburn (D-SC) said Tuesday.
Biden and Harris are well versed in the art of lying. I'm praying America doesn't fall for the deception. #MAGA
Y’all fools for wanting to vote biden just bc he got kamala as his running mate. Just look at their track records.
Sounds like something Biden would say.
Thankful to be on a call today with Josh Dickson,  national faith engagement director, and other women across the country. The campaign listened to our thoughts as Christian women and told us we were heard and valued. This is the Prez I want.
I figured the Biden/Harris news would have you in a better mood.
Joe Biden made his first joint appearance Wednesday with his running mate Sen. Kamala Harris Wednesday:
Biden is quite the liar
It's raining heavy in my town. Hopefully it's washing away the  blinders the people have on who are supporting Biden and Harris!
"Joe Biden and Kamala Harris introduce their presidential ticket in Delaware"
Based on  tweets today, this is his re-election strategy:  Tell black people “Biden is a racist, vote for me!“  Tell white people “I am a racist, vote for me!“
I am disappointed it should have been you Mrs Bottom. Nonetheless I am a true blue Democrat so I will be voting for Biden but it still should have you.
The only way that happens is if the Biden vote is split between the Dems, the two minor parties, and Kanye. I suppose it's within the realm of possibility, but it's extremely unlikely.  That's not to say the Biden vote won't be split. I think it will. But not enough for 45 states
Damn. 45 states. Which do you think Biden wins?
is designed to depress the African-American vote for Biden and subject us all to Trump again.
those same people would be saying Biden dissed African-American voters by passing over Harris. Everything they are doing (see Jared meeting with Kanye last weekend, limiting polling places, attacks on mail-in voting, voter ID) ...
So the right's opening attack line on Harris is that she is not really "African-American" because that term means having ancestors who lived under slavery (this would disqualify Obama, too). Keep in mind that if Biden had picked Elizabeth Warren or Gretchen Whitmer, ...
He shouldn't have been. Trump is never on script Biden is mocked for using a SCRIPT during his call to Kamala Harris
I hate the phrase “lesser of two evils” but that’s really what it boils down to. Nothing Trump has done in the last four years makes me comfortable enough to say “we might as well let him win again.” Hell no. Biden and Harris aren’t JFK but it’s progress!!!
Yay! Joe Biden and running mate Kamala Harris to appear together today
Don't believe anything that he says.  Trump claims suburban housewife will vote for him in new Biden attack
People like this allowed to vote. God help us all. They understand it’s Biden who never leaves his bunker correct?
"I mean, the one thing you cannot say about Joe is that he’s a racist...I mean, he got into politics because of his commitment to civil rights. And then to be elected with Barack Obama, and then someone is saying, you know, YOU'RE A RACIST?” - Jill Biden  Regarding
A LOT OF YALL TRYNA VOTE FOR BIDEN AND KALAMA BECAUSE HE BACKED UP OBAMA AND SHE BLACK......BRUH SHE DONT EVEN IDENTIFY HERSELF AS BLACK. HE HAS HAD A LONG HISTORY OF RACISM YALL NEED TO SOME RESEARCH THATS ALL IMA SAY... CAUSE SOME OF Y’ALL JUST FOLLOWING
EYE ON THE DAY:  - Joe Biden selects Senator Kamala Harris as his running mate  - Big Ten and Pac-12 conferences postpone fall football games  - The last remaining Blockbuster goes on Airbnb
Pres. Trump was asked about Joe Biden's VP pick, Sen. Kamala Harris. Trump said, "...we’ll see how she works out. She did very, very poorly in the primaries..." and that he was "a little surprised that he picked her."
Idk how explain it to me. To me your statement implies if Jesus wouldn’t vote for trump he would vote for Biden. I personally believe it’d be neither and that’s what I’m sitting on. I just know many democrats don’t respect the faith and it shows with simple research.
Then vote for Biden. If people don’t vote it will be the same thing again and we will have him in office
You know for once you are correct. Vote Biden/Harris
Will Biden’s bike have training wheels?
Biden and Bimbo 2020!
#OnNovember3rd2020, we will have a woman as VP-elect if Joe Biden wins.
I wonder what she smells like...  -Joe Biden
Trump will become a one-term president on January 20, 2021 if Joe Biden wins #OnNovember3rd2020.
I wonder what she smells like  ~Joe Biden
No clue. She's just as corrupt and evil as the rest and has flipped on her opinion of Biden. So she is an enemy of this country too .
Is it just me or does it seem strange that the speaker lineup for DMC doesn't include Joe Biden but his wife?
Really love that the Biden VP announcement photo on the FB post I saw from his campaign is him ZOOMING with Kamala. #2020yall
She is just as bad as Biden, a liar and a fraud and will not be happy until this country is like Venezuela or like Stalin's Russia. 😡
Biden is already weaponizing her attacks as AG on white collar criminals  Centrists have already thought several steps ahead of you on this one unfortunately
I do know for a fact that tons of Republicans (all Boomers+) in my vicinity said they'll vote for Biden over Trump (but never Sanders), so this choice is clearly strategic. I hope we'll just age into an era where anti-capitalist notions are, like, actually politically viable.
Who else is over the moon excited about our VP pick? #KamalaHarris2020
She's a train wreck just like Biden. She has that Socialism ideology like Biden. Personally I don't think she can lead a rat out of a bag!
She's apparently a socialist like Biden
Biden picks Sen. Kamala Harris as Running Mate 👍👍👍👍
Biden picked her because he think black folks think alike, “hey here’s a black woman, let’s pick her”
Joe Biden has announced California Sen. Kamala Harris as his vice presidential running mate for the 2020 election.
Biden just picked his VP. Or better put someone picked his VP Kamala Harris. Talk about racist! Picked based on gender and skin color not qualifications 🤨
Joe Biden has picked California Senator Kamala Harris as his running mate for the 2020 presidential election.
BREAKING NEWS! Biden taps Kamala Harris as running mate, setting aside tensions from primary
Um...so not true!  Trump says Americans will have to learn Chinese if Biden wins
Cool..can't wait!  Joe Biden selects his running mate with announcement coming as early as today
Trump confuses the two world wars and it blows up but Biden says all black people are the same and nothing happens.   God what a world.
Trump is a Nationalist peddling Fascism -- just like Hitler. Trump's followers are buying into this ideology. Yet, historically, America has fought Nationalism &amp; Fascism for over a century. Democracy is at stake in 2020. THIS IS WHY REAL REPUBLICANS SUPPORT BIDEN!
The survival of this nation &amp; democracy lies with Joe Biden. I'm a lifelong Republican &amp; I believe it. His VP pick WON'T change my mind!
Your description of Biden is very accurate! I agree that Jill should not be putting Mr Dementia in front of the cameras....I call that elder abuse!
I have one thing to say we shouldn’t have a hard to finding Hiding Biden

I would love to see Biden announce not just his VP choice, but multiple top cabinet position nominees as well. And I think that should include at least some of the people considered for VP who don’t get the nod.
Trump talks the talk. Biden walks the walk.
Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden said on Sunday that if he’s elected, his administration would stop a proposed copper and gold mine in Alaska’s Bristol Bay region.
Way to go! Destroying the 2 most popular federal government programs is sure to ensure soon to be President Biden's win in November.
He just tweeted about Biden a few minutes ago. He's just not worth listening to
Former Vice President Joe Biden would enact a number of policies that would raise taxes, including individual income taxes and payroll taxes, on high-income individuals with income above $400,000.
Seems weird that Biden is already putting up a female of color VP, and they don’t think that in itself isn’t racist. Affirmative action in action. Wondering how NY and other cities put signs on roads w/o permits. No one wants to sue.
Betting Biden camp will find every excuse for no Debates. He will be a disaster. Even if elected, he owes too much to Leftist. Incompetent. If he doesn’t debate, we should kick him out then.
Without cohesion many Senators will get beat. Weird that I still think silent majority with a crummy Biden might pull it off yet. Can you imagine Trump with a Dem Congress? Many people won’t admit they like him and the way he fights for ordinary people.
Biden  is a Chinese Plant
You lying weasel! You did not mention that China is backing Sleepy Joe Biden!!! I swear as long as I live I will NEVER vote for another DEMOCRAT!!
Nothing, and I do mean NOTHING, that Biden has or could do can match up the outright pure corruption by Trump and GOP.    The only reason to support Trump is because he makes you feel like your horrible traits are acceptable now. Trump makes it ok to be a sexist, racist pig
is joe biden turning into an edge lord
Biden is expected to announce his running mate before the Democratic National Convention, which is now just a little over a week away.
The Presidential Stock Market Direction will be determined by who enters the White House. The "WHY  &amp; HOW" is clear...  The recent MMT implies that a Presidential Stock Market Direction win by Biden will prove to be a complete joke.
I took some time to not soak myself in social media for a few days as my anxiety was through the roof and I see I came back to SSDD.  Trump is a moron and lying, we're getting too cocky that Biden will win, we need to remember how it went down 4 years ago. He'll try to steal it
WITHOUT A DOUBT!!! Biden is worst than HRC.
Intelligence community's top election official: China and Iran don't want Trump to win reelection, Russia working against Biden

Most of my family is Republican (think 95%). With exception of 4 holdouts in IL &amp; 4 in TN, mine too is backing Biden!
I was raised Catholic. Attended Parochial school. Married in the church. Practiced the faith. But Rome doesn't pay to feed, clothe, or educate our children. I support a woman's right to choose as well as birth control. Biden isn't a "bad Catholic". He evolved like most of us!
Biden is a habitual racists. Cover him Jim and you’ll see for yourself. You won’t tell the truth so POTUS has to do your job for you
But we all know Biden doesn’t tweet. He probably didn’t even read those tweets much less write them.
But we all know Biden doesn’t tweet. He probably didn’t even read those tweets much less write them.
Biden is a racist! He opened his mouth and removed all doubt yesterday? TRUMP 2020!!
Well shit Jimmy, if we listen to you then Joe is elected. You’ve been hijacked to lead the way for no debates. W/O debates then no one will see the true Biden full of lies and wishing for a brain. How much did they pay you?
Joe Biden makes God angry but also Joe Biden does not make God angry.
Democrats are CHICKENS! McCauliffe, have a debate before the vote, prove you think Biden is going to win. Don't do a debate before the vote, proves Democrats are still pro-slavery.
The nonpartisan Commission on Presidential Debates has rejected a request from the Trump campaign to either add an additional general election debate or move up the calendar for the contests.
Neither does Joe Biden lol pretty sad for us
Pres. Donald Trump billed his trip to Ohio as a chance to promote economic recovery, but quickly pivoted to a deeply personal attack on Joe Biden, even questioning without foundation the former vice president's faith in God.
#VoteTrump2020, and if you can't bring yourself to do so, then stay home or consider voting for  Biden is not a capable leader and the Democrats are anti-American. #NoBiden #VoteRed #VoteGold

This has already happened.   In October 2019, Biden attended Mass at St. Anthony Catholic Church in Florence,  SC.  The pastor, Fr. Robert Morey, declined to give him communion. Several bishops later said they would not have denied him communion. (But Fr. Morey is not young.)
That don’t mean anything.  I am catholic and would never support Biden.
Maya Rudolph, portrayer of Kamala Harris on "SNL," admits she could be busy ahead of the election after Harris was announced as Joe Biden's running mate.
Trump wants America to have whites with money only neighborhoods. Like his country clubs. Except not too much money, so they're not like his country clubs. He is a racist and elitist. Even tho Biden isn't a good alternative, I'm still going all in on Biden just to get Trump out!
Isn't Biden a Catholic though? Even went to Catholic school.
You are a bigger joke than Biden is. You were a horrible DA, AG, and you would be an awful VP, which will not happen.
she’s right that’s why 18-24 yr olds will vote for biden
We need to find out who is controlling the democrat party....I think the tech giants....as Biden and Harris are both empty vessels that will do whatever they’re told.
This isn’t a protest vote. It’s a vote for the polices Joe Biden (and Trump) is against. We’re here change, not whatever scare tactics the Democrats come up with to surpress voters. #Freetochoose
Something told me Biden would pick Kamala Harris as his running mate, I just really hoped I was wrong.  She weakens his campaign, in my opinion, and increases the likelihood of Trump being re-elected (especially if he dumps Pence for Nikki “where’s my popcorn” Haley.
My sweet hubs will confirm that YOU were my choice for PRESIDENT from the minute I watched your announcement. I am beyond thrilled that you have been chosen to be Biden’s VP choice.
😂🤣 and Biden will be sooo much better
I can't stand Trump, but I dont like Biden either so I ain't voting for neither one of em.
Biden chose Harris for #VPPick  simply because he knows "Mother" won't allow Pence on the debate stage with a woman.
Biden goes with the least surprising, and probably safest pick.
Biden selects California Sen. Kamala Harris as running mate
I hope Biden's VP is Rep. Val Demings. She has the background to lead a nationwide #DeFascistizeThePolice initiative, as a former police chief in Orlando, Fl. #BidenDemings2020 can remove racist cops as the domestic terrorists they are. I'll support Biden's choice, no matter who!

Yes, Russia is helping Biden - even devil woman Pelosi agrees  - the devil woman does nothing but actions trying to hurt America

Trump is honest, Biden is extremely corrupt
Russian bots are getting crushed by their own masters', Trump's &amp; Putin's, incompetence. They hate Biden so dutifully. No wonder they're so full of duty!
I finally agree with schitthead. We need to subpoena Obama, Biden and everyone who worked under the Obama cluster fuck of a sham government that is seeking to take away everyone’s freedom and replace it with socialism, AKA Russian government. It’s the dems, not the republicans!
good morning frat, I’m trying to find out about the comments that Joe Biden supposedly said about blacks and diversity.  Maybe you can shed some light on this matter, didn’t hear exactly what he said.
I think President Trump will get a record high % of the Black vote.   Joe Biden takes black voters for granted
Biden is one dumb person
You’re right we are doomed (if Biden gets in). If you had half a brain you’d know it wasn’t a hoax. You manipulate the issue to fit your narrative. It’s so unappealing, like Nancy Pelosi.
Legionnaires' disease is not being misdiagnosed as COVID-19, and a missile wasn't responsible for the massive explosion in Beirut. Here are the facts.
The blueprints for Black self-determination and ultimately liberation are being worked on in spaces Biden will never access. Let him talk. We're about our work. #BlackAugust
Biden's ignorance doesn't deserve that energy. African Americans know that Blackness is not a monolith. That we are a diverse and remarkable people. We have nothing to prove.
I could remind y'all of how Biden's ignorant and disrespectful comment seeks to divide Black and Latinx voters. A tactic that's old and tired.
I could waste my time talking about how Joe Biden's most recent statement about Black voters is just the kind of stupidity you'd expect from a misogynist racist.

Love Biden's choice!!! I'm ALL IN!!!
No.  Biden must participate in the process as normal.  1.  He is a diff person now. 2. He and Trump should present thier policy to the people. 3. You make no case why we should skip debates leaving us to assume that you see what we all see.  Joe is deminished and happens to all
Biden has been in Politics 41 years... what has he done, please tell me
Pelosi, Schumer, and Biden should be the first to allow low income housing in their communities!!! We all know their a party of “Do as I say, Not as I do”.
HEY? DID YOU SIGN UP FOR THE "SHARE-A-HOME" PROGRAM SET UP BY OBAMA AND HIS ADMINISTRATION? IT DIDN'T GO INTO EFFECT BECAUSE TRUMP WON! BUT, IF BIDEN WINS, JUST WAIT FOR THE KNOCK ON YOUR DOOR!!! HOW MANY EMPTY BED ROOMS DO YOU HAVE??? 😃
Is she asking Biden if he fondled Tara Reade?
Such a shame Biden chose his running mate based on color of skin instead of the character of that running mate. MLK is turning over in his grave... jmho

Twitter can't keep up with Biden, Harris memes!!! LOL!!!

Best Day Ever Biden-Harris 2020
As a woman entering the political arena, and as an African American woman raised in the South, I can assure you representation matters.  I’m thrilled to see ⁦ join the ticket.   Let’s get this done! #BidenHarris2020
I hope Kamala tells Biden “Every time you think you are going to say something, run that shit by me first”
Congrats Madam Vice President!!! We the American citizens need you and President Biden now more than ever!!
Biden is removed and Kamala is our Potus
THANK YOU JOE BIDEN FOR MAKING AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!!! AND AGAIN!!! AND AGAIN!!! WE LOVE YA JOE!!!
LOL! 100 BLACK LEADERS SENT BIDEN A LETTER TO FORCE HIM TO CHOOSE A "WOMAN OF COLOR" FOR VP! HERE'S THE PROBLEM: "KAMALA-LA-LA-LA" AIN'T BLACK! (PATRIC HENRY) NOT ONLY THAT, SHE HATES BLACKS MORE THAN BIDEN! IT APPEARS 100 BLACK IDIOTS JUST SHOT THEMSELVES IN THE LEFT TESTICLE!
THAT'S IT!!! THE RACE IS OVER! TRUMP WINS BY THE BIGGEST LANDSLIDE IN HISTORY!!! BIDEN MAKES THE BIGGEST MISTAKE IN HIS POLITICAL HISTORY BY CHOOSING "KAMALA-LA-LA-LA" AS HIS CHOICE FOR VP!!! SHE COULDN'T BALANCE A CHECK BOOK...
Hey Ann, really Biden wanted to choose Mochelle, but he didn't after finding out she's Michael.
Google search Algorithm? I searched a picture of "imbecile" to attach to a tweet depicting Rob Reiner, there were row after row pictures of the President. No Obama, no Biden no Pelosi.
Dems will remove Biden - insert VP
I've been thinking--and it's ridiculously apparent--that whomever Joe Biden picks for a running mate is going to have to have really thick skin for when the orange kindergartner decides to get nasty...and he will and fucking EVERYONE LETS HIM!!! Pisses me off
I agree I even said that last night when several people was whining about no not her or her. The whole idea is to get trump’s fat ass out of our WH with Biden we will have a man in there that actually knows what he’s doing unlike the orange swamp king.
SO 100 BLACK MEN WROTE A LETTER TO BIDEN SAYING THEY WON'T VOTE FOR HIM UNLESS HE CHOOSES A BLACK WOMAN FOR VP! BUT, ALL THE BLACK WOMEN IN THE RUNNING ARE MARXISTS/COMMIES AND QUEENS! I WOULDN'T GIVE THEM THE JOB OF DOG CATCHER! IN FACT I MIGHT PUT THE DOG IN CHARGE!!!
Bless your heart.  Speaking of bunkers, anyone seen Biden?
GOD BLESS AND PROTECT YOU BROTHER! MAY THE GOOD LORD PLACE A HEDGE OF HIS MIGHTY PROTECTION AROUND YOU!!! STANG STRONG!!! WAKE THEM UP! JUST ASK THEM: "WHAT HAS BIDEN DONE FOR YOU???"
Joe Biden shouldn't be pressured in picking a woman of color to run as as his candidate for VP. He should pick the person most qualified to do the job.

So much bull, marking up things to air.  They can't say anything good about Biden.  Funny stuff.
Pelosi sounds like a babbling idiot just like Joe Biden. They both have been in government entirely to long and it shows. Vote Democrats out in November.
QUESTION: IF BIDEN DEBATES TRUMP AND EVERY TIME TRUMP ASKS BIDEN A QUESTION, BIDEN REPLIES: "C' MON MAN???" DOES BIDEN WIN THE DEBATE???
Very much, as Biden is incompetent so VP will be our president quicker than you think
Leadership means leading from the front. U lead from behind and kiss leaders feet. U have never led squat. LOOSER JOE BIDEN. Hey Joe, do u know where u are today?  Hahaha
How is this a lie. This is what he wants along with millions of people for insurance. Everything he says is a lie to you.  I guess he can’t do right. At least he didnt say Hispanics are better than African American folks. Biden is a LOOSER and its in your face. U don’t see it
Biden lost already. He can't compete a sentence.
After Joe Biden revealed his latest plan no Christian will be able to vote for him
FINALLY!!!!! PRESIDENT DONALD J. TRUMP IS "NOT" A RACIST!!! BUT!!!! VP JOE BIDEN IS!!!! THEREFORE, YOU BLACKS CAN STAND ON TV SUPPORTING BIDEN, SHOWING THE WORLD JUST HOW STUPID YOU ARE!!! 😂😝😛😎🤣🤪
At least Biden takes responsibility and apologize for his screw ups. You blame everyone in the world and never take responsibility or apologize. You’re a damn fool if you think you’re worthy of their votes, he’ll you’re not worthy of one single Vote.
In your dreams! Biden will be our new and A REAL PRESIDENT
Notice the #MAGA grifters never admit they are black until after a Biden gaffe.  Now all of a sudden they become black and scream racism.  Any other time it doesn't exist and they aren't black, their American.

The  needs to sit her drunken  down in drunk tank and sober her up. She's threatening a former Vice President, w/o really saying straight out. Sound likes something the mob boss would do, amirite, JP?
Shirley Chisholm gave Hillary the inspiration. I love my fellow Scorpian  Hillary though bcz she is real. Voting Biden/Harris and 🙏🙏🙏 for the Blue Tsunami  needed.
How strange, that it takes zero seconds of actual journalism to prove these cases biased and wrong, but we still have no disculpatory evidence for Biden not shoving his fingers in a young woman's vagina. And yes, I'll say it like that, because that's what he did.
Aight so I understand a lot of folks are against Biden &amp; Kamala.. but I know for a fact it can’t be as bad as 4 more years of the clown.
"If and when"..... I knew that was their plan all along... Biden gets elected then resigns and Harris is the first woman President. Its sad we live in a world where people are hired to a position because of their race or gender and not their performance.
Val Demings is not done! I’m sure Biden has a cabinet position for her when the time comes.
*Spoiler alert* I was voting for Joe Biden anyway #LesserOfTwoEvils #JusticeForBreonnaTaylor
These debates....can't  wait for the blow out pence will receive. Hope Biden can hold on to his temper with pumpkinhead bcz I can hear the cuss words flowing....in my mind.  These will be exciting  to watch...this time.
Just his hypothetical  thought. Biden could ask Susan to be Att'y General or any of the other Black females bcz they will go after pumpkinhead too.
I think as a gay black man I won’t have to fear for my rights under a Biden/Harris administration versus a Trump/Pence administration. I trust one to properly replace Bader Ginsberg, and the other I don’t.
This hack was even on the team with Biden and was in total support of what Joe did.  is a worthless, cowardly, spineless piece of Russian 💩.
I was worried Biden was gonna mess this one up. Glad he made the right choice
#BidenHarris2020-Hell to the fucqing yeah. I'm happy, but I would've still vote #Biden2020 no matter who he chose. Right now I happy bc I am fucqing sick of Trump not taking this #COVID19 serious. I've buried too many fam and friend from this pandemic.
Mrs Krassenstein puppets are near you. If Biden had strings it couldn’t be plainer. The Left wants a weak executive branch so they can keep picking the Pockets of the American People.
Who’s gonna give Biden’s speech if he wins? Hell he can’t spell his name much less give a speech.
I feel the same as you express. Joe Biden is incompetent. The Democrats ohave been busy trying to Ring in  Bernie Sanders tainted supporters. And keep the Black and Hispanic votes by picking a candidate for him. Please vote GOP straight ticket. Leave the Phony DEMOCRATS!!!!
Bye man you are lost. The media has duped YOU. At least I know Biden ain’t shit
Y’all crazy man if y’all don’t think that man racist. But insist Biden is. It’s political to y’all. I don’t believe in parties. None of them good. Trump is a narcissist ego manic who is about self and a racist prideful biget who said just grab women by the pussy.
Did u see what he said about John Lewis. I’m not voting for nobody that said grabbing women by the pussy is ok. Miss me with that done more for the black community bull. It’s funny you can see all the racist stuff Biden has done and I agree with you but won’t acknowledge trump.
Yea they think we actually like Biden bruh. I be telling them lesser of two evils.
A ‘Savage’ huh? does Cruel and vicious hostile describe you. Sounds like you don’t think about what you say and your loyalty can shift with your mood. Remember Biden has many many links with China. Calm down.
Democrats are desperate to hide the Biden family corruption in Ukraine ... and in China
Joe Biden is really into heavy petting a la 1954

We don't want to hear Biden talking anyway.
And if it doesn't, it was also a joke. C'mon man, don't you get it? *Big Joe Biden smile
I think, maybe, it's because he's a carbon based lifeform and tragedy literally occurs every day. Gotta hit the powerful sometimes. Got hit twice. Not unusual.   Disclaimer: I have no empirical proof Joe Biden is carbon based, it may be the man runs on actual liquid money.
This just reads like the latest Joe Biden interview.Anyone else watch Biden speaking during the signing of their official acceptance of their nomination? Biden mumbled and stumbled terribly. He truly is #DementiaJoe, IMHO.
Why Has Biden Hired 600 Lawyers?
Only reason I'm gonna vote for Biden is because Trump isn't the only one causing problems. We need a dem in office to put a stop to McConnells machinations. The only reason Barr and McConnell do all they do is because they have a president and base who allow it.
I keep hearing from ppl around me that Biden is gonna win now. Wrong! #Trump2020Landslide
Were they elected, Harris would declare the Biden incompetent per 25th amendment and take over quickly. Her agenda is even worse that Bernie's. Communism expedited.
Her personal story about the relationship with Beau Biden was an obvious work of fiction. Her delivery had subtle signs  that she wasn't quite comfortable with the narrative. Total phony, IMO. Trump nailed that moniker.
Biden is nothing but a sock puppet for his handlers. He'll say anything they write for him. The President doesn't have the power to do that. The audacity of a candidate acting like he has the power is simply absurd.
Nope. The Biden admin is going to be a half step to the left of the Obama admin. Which didn't even go for a public option, did almost nothing on gun control, didn't defund/abolish police, didn't support gay marriage until the 2nd term etc etc etc. You won't be in a camp by 2022.
Joe Exotic would have been a better president than Trump or Biden.
No way Florida’s gonna vote for Biden.#TrumpWinsFlorida
Let’s be real,it’s Trump,Biden doesn’t know what office he I running for half the time,and his running mate is a American Indian one day the next day a black woman,these people must think people are idiots,lol.
No way Biden is ahead by this much in California. I know it’s a Democratic state, but jeez. This seems manipulated!
Joy Biden did not select Sen Harris on merit, race or sex. He selected her based on sexual affairs rumors. She is an Evita Perone.

In a joint conference with vp candidate senator k.Harris; candidate Joe Biden wants to make mask wearing mandatory. Sen k Harris apparently is a psycho mess. She afraid to walk into a shower of sneezes, ahems, coughs and spitting. KH needs to see a schrink.
. selects US   as his vice president candidate.  Now, we're getting reaction from both sides of the fence and reflecting back on her visit to #RockHill last year.
He knows what he doin.
Me when I first saw the Biden/Harris ticket lol
Biden Rally’s be like....
I forgot how terrible she is at connecting sincerely with the audience. It came back to me watching her try to be convincing, but there was no conviction behind her words. Electing Biden would make Kamala president. Horrible thought!
Only those people who have incredibly short memories. History shows they do the opposite. Look at Obama/Biden record. But those who believe their slogans and platitudes may vote for #DementiaJoe, believing his "build better" slogan. Completely absurd, IMO.
Yeah I hate the “settle for Biden” Bernie Bro’s get on my nerves but at the end of the day, moderates and progressives are on the same side. I wish Biden would have got in early in 2016 but I really think Beau’s death knocked him down for a while. Have you read “Promise Me, Dad”?
Maybe this is an unpopular opinion but I like Biden a lot. He’s a great guy with an amazing personal life journey. He’s got a ton of experience which is what we are gonna need and I think he realizes he’s gonna be a one term president and Kamala will take over in 2024.
Joe Biden is the Presidential Candidate not Sen. Harris but be clear, your attacks on either will not go unanswered. It’s either America or Trump. You picking Trump? Or is it you don’t want to see a black woman where you think you should be first?
I think the key here really is a Jamie Harrison victory more than a Biden victory in this state. Getting rid of Graham is really important.
How can you tell when Kamala is lying? Her mouth is moving. This whole Beau Biden story is clearly contrived. Very disappointed in whoever wrote this fiction for her to perform  this looks like the clunky part that required additional rehearsal, IMO.
Probably right when say affecting the president's press briefing. How much money is Jamaica or India donating to Biden?
OH my. We're back to fine people on both sides. This speech by Biden is too long for him. He's losing focus.
Joe Biden’s speech cadence is upsettingly bad though.
I just found out from Talk show host Brett Winter I'll that I.S. Senator Harris does not like Catholics. I wonder if Joe Biden knows this. I have to research this since Democratic party is centered around Catholicism.

Donald Trump’s FIRST STEP Act freed more Biden-imprisoned black Americans from jail than Kamala Harris improperly kept in prison for the free prison space labor.
I am considered a "suburban housewife."  I will not be voting for you.  I am appalled you ended AFFH.  I hope Biden will reinstate it.
I think Biden will only serve one term due to his age.
Biden was threatned and told to pick a black woman, you don't know what you are talking about.
Biden is already removable from office based on Amendment 25. Harris can declare that immediately upon getting elected, then pick her own VP. Can't let these communists win in November! #VoteRedToSaveAmerica2020
Biden can’t even say five words without forgetting what he’s talking about. So basically you’re voting for Kamala.
Exactly. This is hardly unprecedented. Look at Reagan &amp; Bush in 1980 or Obama &amp; Biden in 2008. People are always trying to stir shit up.
I understand that Harris has a past but her record against Pence's is stellar.   Yes, she made mistakes but I guarantee you if a white male with Harris' track record had been tapped for VP by Biden, I wouldn't have seen a single *insert white male name* is a cop tweets.

Biden really brought on Harris as his VP after she trashed him and called him a racist all over the debate stage. What a cuck.
How can accessory to infanticide, violating  Scripture, massive corruption and lying, just to name a few, be in any way Christian?  Like all Democrite pols, Biden is demonic and in no way Christian. You don't get to write your own gospel or make your own god!
He blocked me because I told him to stop using abortion as his crutch to not support Joe Biden versus voting for Trump again. He’s shameless in his what aboutism.
I wasn’t going to do this, but kiddo is asking me to check twitter every 5 minutes for veep news.   How do I get that “first to know” text message from the Biden campaign? “Text blah blah to #####?”   I know someone here can tell me.

I did understand the best candidate for Biden vp was senator k. Harris. That won't happen because senator Harris wants AG job. Best vp bet is Susan Rice.
Current mood: frustrated. *Biden voice* C’MON MAN!
the question Joe Biden will have to answer is the question of why black women are good enough to be the backbone of the Democratic Party but not good enough to lead this Nation. He better have a damn good answer the backlash against the mention of Whitmer shows.
Well I guess I’ll stop advocating for her then because Joe Biden was always my first choice for President.
"Joe Biden attacks Donald Trump for 'shameful' claim he is 'against God' | US elections 2020 | The Guardian"  This partly true. The aim is for Democrats to exclude other religions. Like Chief Justice did last week to exclude other Christians religions.

The many lies of fmr vp Joe Biden was talked about on radio. Biden claimed he has 3 degrees, he only has one Delaware! Biden claimed he graduated top of class, when he actually finished bottom 3rd Delaware. Why is Deleware a state where ignorant people move can't do the research?
Never forget mother's of sons in military. Your son's or daughters will be a compromise to a Joe Biden Administration. Who will print me a Bumper sticker to that knowing?????
President Trump needs to investigate matter before any further with drawals from Afghanisn. Biden is the Voltare of Earth of Battle star Gallacticca' game.
The concern is that these Afghanistan soldiers should have been questioned. Or an investigation of more missing details . Joe Biden is like the character on 'Battlestar Gallacticca', --Voltare. Who betrayed to the Ceylons.
Keep telling yourself that black women don’t care if Joe  Biden picks a white woman. Representation matters! Governor Whitmer has a city that still doesn’t have clean water. We haven’t forgotten Flint.
This should be enough to defeat Joe Biden for ever becoming president. Biden betrayed seal team 6 and he will betray U.S. to China. That is bumper Number sticker news.
Didn’t they spend the entire primary attacking Biden?
It's Biden's campaign team that thinks that way. He just says whatever they write for him to say. #DementiaJoe barely knows where he is from moment to moment.
No no no! You bring on Vernon Jones to talk about his support of Trump and his racism and he starts attacking Joe Biden. You must not let him do that cut that crap off like  did.
Biden would fail a competency test, IMO. He couldn't even pass #TheClockDrawingTest for dementia. Wait for the bait and switch at the virtual convention. Dems pin their hopes on mail-in ballots triggering the 20th amendment clause for Congress to appoint a president.
I saw a debate on this on my timeline and the actual report does not explicitly mention the grand canyon AFAIK. It was Biden's response that did.  Not that I think reopening Uranium mines in that region is going to go over well anyways.
They might work for wealthy celebs. There is a sexual market for young children. Now, Biden gets his child meat from China.
It’s a shame Admiral James Stockdale passed 15 years ago.   I would *love* to see him on a debate stage between Trump and Biden.
Biden got to be about more than the y’all in this ad.
I don’t want her as a surrogate. She is THE pick for Vice President. This need to make her second fiddle to a white woman as VP by some folk are truthfully pissing me off. Biden says he wants to be a bridge, Kamala should be on the other side. The future of Democrats is brown.

How is it an attack to tell her that it’s an absurd excuse and she had no intention of voting for Biden at all.  got that white woman crying game down! So tired of the victim hood. We owe Rebulican women that vote majority Republican since 64 , NOTHING! Entitled behinds.
What would have to happen if a President Biden restricted non Catholic churches.
It seams that the Catholic Church was not always a religion that favored abortion.The Catholic church opposed abortion. This the argument if a president Biden will close Christian Religions. Supreme court judge Roberts or the other 4 Catholics will not oppose Pres Biden order.
The Biden speech writer made a mistake &amp; Biden could not adapt. The question discussed on Rush Limbaugh was could Biden afford to loose Cuban vote by strengthening relations with Cuba.
People understand in marketing terms what a loss leader is. Define as taking a loss on one product to attract customers ; then gaining on a different product. That is what Candidate Biden is to Democratic party- a loss leader.

If you’re putting conditions on your vote for Biden when a man that has let 160,000 Americans die and says , “It is what it is” , you’re as unserious as he is and frankly you’re going to vote for Trump. This is ABSURD!
I just read that Joe Biden said he would not stand in the way of investigations of Trump! That’s excellent!
Love Juan Williams defense of Joe Biden as a regular church-going Catholic. How can any Catholic support abortion up to birth? I just watch the Five to watch Jesse (who isn't there today) put Juan in his place.

You think Trump will get the blame for this? 😂😂😂 Hes the one wanting everything to open and to play football. Biden is saying you keep everything closed.
The only reason Kamala accepted going for VP is because she is DESPERATELY hoping that Biden can’t serve out his term and she gets to takeover even though her campaign failed misersbly and no one likes her.
You are Biden’s target audience.....he loves them dumb. 😂 Masks are extremely minimally helpful in slowing the spread. Hand washing, social distancing, eating healthy, taking vitamins, all much more important. Trump doesn’t wear a mask tho....so that’s all we will talk about.
The Wendy's ad "WHERE'S THE BEEF?"  Could also double as an ad about Biden and Kamala!
I've got plenty. It's all documented at my blog.  But apparently you can't read so why should I waste my time explaining it to you?  Besides, you don't really care if Biden is corrupt or a racist or abuses women so why bother?
I also reminded  yesterday that his daughter is backing Biden/Harris 2020 ticket!!
Would Joe Biden last 4 years as president? C'mon man!
Did anybody else think that Joe Biden and Kamala Harris’s speech today was very communist feeling? They were in a building where no one had access to them the only people in the room with the media? Looks like we’re looking at a dictatorship talking from a place of power

Reaction pours in for Harris as Biden’s historic VP pick  via
Odds that Pence brings up the fact she sucked Willie Brown’s dick to get her start in politics is going off in Vegas at 5:1. It’s odd Biden picked someone who called him a racist sexual predator.
President Trump told reporters that Sen. Harris “was very disrespectful to Joe Biden” during the Democratic primaries, and said “it’s hard to pick somebody that’s that disrespectful.”
No, obviously it is YOU who doesn't have a clue.  I would help you out but I've learned it's a waste of time.  If you don't know about Biden's crimes, pay attention. You're about to find out.

So many REAL issues out there and you are running around in a golf cart making goat videos?  No wonder your network is in trouble.  Why don't you roll over to Biden's house.  Make sure to take your drug test first.  You write like a junkie!
Nobody should ever question Biden’s mental fil...mental filness....mental fitness. Dude can’t put a sentence together. It’s elder abuse what you guys are doing to him.
Vote Biden. Go Green.
Decorum?  She is as drunk every day as Biden is lost in his dementia.  Wow...so sad that this is the best you have.
Biden in a bike helmet. The Dukakis would start immediately.
I'll take Biden...hell I'll take an empty box after the Shit Show called Trump.
There’s only one reason people want mail in voting....it’s Biden’s only chance.  It’s the end of the USA if we go that route.
Biden is good for the market as it runs on stability. The 6% or 8% corporate tax increase if there is one hurts less than 4 more years of chaos.
I haven't seen any Trump supporters rioting or looting. Have you?  I haven't seen any Trump supporters beating anyone up for wearing a Biden hat.  And I haven't seen any Trump supporters giving the power salute.  You're not fooling anyone but yourself!
Calling Biden racist is sort of lame. Facts are racist nowadays...
Shifty----can you document Trump's increase/decrease in wealth since taking office, and then compare it to Obama or Biden?  Please make it public when you do.
We need Biden to win in a landslide.
According to a new Emerson poll, of those who plan to vote in person, Trump leads 65-32. Biden leads with those who intend to vote by mail, 76-20.
Does he have a chance at being Biden’s running mate?
Joe  Biden doesn’t need any assistance denigrating himself.
It’s trump or Biden.  That’s it.  Period.  End of freaking discussion.  I don’t care if he picks a can of beans.
Why Is Joe Biden Silent on the Attacks Against Catholic Statues, Churches, and Beliefs?
Washington Post fact-checker roasted for insisting Biden didn't say what he said
has gone over the edge in ranting that Joe Biden is “against God,” etc.  This from one who’s never asked God for forgiveness, infrequently attends church, and doesn’t know the Bible except how to use it as a prop.
Incapacitated?  Yet you would vote for BIDEN?  What a laugh!
Anyone who picks the moron Trump over Biden is a moron!!! Black white red or any color!
Biden, slow down this is the time the idiots out there are going to to trip you up. Don’t be reactive. Give yourself a minute when you’re being attacked or asked stupid questions..  this way u don’t have to go back and apologize for someone asking you inappropriate questions.
But apparently you think Trump is SO AWFUL yet you would vote for Biden who is clearly NOT FIT.... So, I guess that shoe fits YOU then doesn't it!
Seriously, WATCH THIS and tell me Biden is fit to be President!
Trump is good at 3 things lol  Ignoring important questions  Making fun of Joe Biden  And pretending to know how to golf
The ad works because most Americans don’t know Biden said he wouldn’t have stopped travel from China and praised Cuomo for his handling of the virus which was horrendously bad. He hopes people are dumb....which generally works bc most are.
Were you up Deadline Creek with no topic?  Your column is nonsensical self-flagellation.  A write-in vote is a wasted choice, and if you can’t discern the critical imperative of choosing Biden over Poserdent Agolf Twitler, then turn in your pontificator’s badge.
That was Biden photoshopped to look like Trump.  Or don't you know about Biden's racist past and present?
So, you are admitting you people plan to abuse the powers of the FBI if Biden gets elected?  Well, at least you are honest.
Listening to my dad in the next room say "C'mon man!" impersonating  Joe Biden and laughing to himself.
Where have you been lately in terms of Biden/Trump?
No. Give me a break. None of this bullshit… It’s Biden or Trump that’s itSince  has no problem going after his predecessor (Obama),  I think Pres. Biden's Justice Department should hold Trump accountable for every single crime that Trump commits.
In my opinion, he got killed after his attack on Biden. He insulted him right to his face and Democrats rejected him.
So you can lie to the FISA courts, Obama/Biden admin can use the FBI to play dirty cop, wiretap a political opponent, and use foreign help to hurt your political opponents campaign and Barr thinks its best to let illegal activity be brought out after the election? He better not.
So all of these Black bourgeois folks telling you that they will hold Biden-Kamala accountable are just using buzzwords. They won’t be in the streets. They weren’t in the streets during the uprising under Trump, what makes you think they will be when their party is elected?
Once again Biden and Kamala won't  answer questions. The reporters get pushed out.   If the press quit covering and showing their events until they answer questions I guarantee you that will change.
When Biden and Kamala finally answer reporters questions who really believes the reporters will ask hard questions like "Joe why were you trying to take down a political opponent, General Flynn, while you were Vice President?
The first of many in the Obama/Biden administrations wiretapping and lying to FISA courts  Fox news: Former FBI lawyer Kevin Clinesmith will plead guilty to making a false statement in U.S. Attorney John Durham's review of the Russia investigation.
That’s true but Biden will get ALL the dead voters, the ballot harvest or voters and the vast of the main in voters! They don’t post signs!
Liberal Hacks: 🖕Ralph Nader, he's a spoiler that gave us Bush/Cheney  Also Liberal Hacks: -Leave Ellen &amp; Bush alone! -Bush gave Michelle candy &amp; they hugged🥰 -Amazing painter Bush is doing immigrant portraits now😍 -Biden awards Bush Liberty Medal, calls Cheney a "decent man"
The Dem mayors and governor’s! What do you think a Dem Pres Biden will do? What ever he’s told!
Maybe she can be Biden’s “Monica”!!
These liberals have lost their minds. What is the Democrats plan. We are already wearing masks. Do they think that Joe Biden could have brought the private sector together to find a cure for this virus?
Exactly! He closed the country…even though Biden thought we should leave it open. Trump is the reason the death toll has stayed low. Remember H1N1? As many as 89.3 million cases. 5 million China virus cases. Looks like OUR great President Trump has done well!
Ask Joe Biden about getting arrested in South Africa. Ask Joe Biden about what position he graduated in his class. Biden is the consummate liar in this election. But news media gives free passes to Dems. Hypocrisy in action every day. People with a brain see through it all.
Joe Biden plagiarized Ronald Reagan's speech from a Reagan-Bush campaign rally on September 3, 1984:  Biden: “We can define America simply in one word: “Possibilities.” Possibilities. Let me say it again; possibilities. That’s America.”
When I see Biden and Kamala I see two people who know something is up and them being President and vice president  isn't it. Somethings off. Zero enthusiasm. Kamala isn't into it.
Biden doesn't have a clue.
Getting ready for the big dance when Biden/Harris take over!!
Biden hasn't done anything but get payed for 43 years on Government.  He should be ashamed of himself.
Of course Fox polls has Kamala ahead of Pence. Crazy considering she was just chosen yesterday.   Every channel you turn on including FOX all you hear is bad man Trump and great man Biden.  don't even fact check the stupid sh*t Kamala says like about Ebola and so on.....
Why doesn't Joe Biden mandate the democratic governors to stop the rioting and looting in their states? The Democrats are turning states into shitholes.
Biden and Kamala left their briefing without answering questions after they suggested that we should have a national mandate for wearing masks for 3 months.  Chickensh*ts
So we have to hear Biden say that we need to wear a mask.... old news Joe and Kamala Harris!  Biden says it is a must that we institute a National mandate to wear a mask....  OUR STATE IS OUR BUSINESS JOE!
Biden tried to give himself and Obama credit for the Israel and UAE peace agreement...except it was Obama/Biden  helping Iran and it was Obama/Biden meddling in Israel's election to try to get Netanyahu defeated.
Always trying to take credit 4 years later.  Biden said he was glad to hear about Israel and UAE peace agreement and then threw in how they worked off of what he and Obama had already started.
Why people are leaving religion in droves. Deservedly so!   Trump-loving Catholic Priest accuses Biden-Harris supporters of wanting ‘terrorists’ and ‘bloodshed’ -
Fox news: Twitter will be clamping down on mail-in-ballot "misinformation" as Biden's misinformation campaign ads stay up.   Fair and bias?
It actually made it worse however I know Biden had little or nothing to do with the decision! He is owned by Soros so his handlers made the decision!
This headline tells you everything you need to know about #BidenHarris.  #WallStreet's exhaling bc they know "#NothingWillFundamentallyChange"&amp; neither Biden nor Harris will prosecute them when they crash the economy again. Just ask Mnuchin, am I right Kamala? #MBNABiden #Copmala

This is not a surprise at all.  Stay focused Mr. President and let your record of achievements speak. Your administration has accomplished more in 3 years, to help Americans, than Biden / Harris have done in more than 50+ years in public office. Don't get distracted by the bs.
Lol You’re just mad they’re not for Biden and Harris
PBS. "WATCH LIVE: Biden and Harris make 1st appearances as running mates in Delaware."   YouTube  YouTube video of both Joe and Kamala's speeches yesterday.
Watch "WATCH LIVE: Biden and Harris make 1st appearance as running mates in Delaware" on YouTube  YouTube video of both Joe and Kamala's speeches yesterday
We struggle every day. Biden/Harris 2020
Does Biden want to defund the police?
Wait is  a “reporter” or member of Biden’s campaign? #FAKENEWS
Pandering? Biden putting Kamala on the ticket type of pandering?
Democrats don't want you to call Kamala/Biden names. Agree.   Now when will their 5 yrs. of constant name calling of President Trump and Melania stop? When will slandering  and  stop? When will reporters stop the bias? When will they show POTUS respect?
🐿🙉🙄🌊🤡 Why have these daily briefing where tRump says the same thing over and over, I can,I am, blah, blah, blah. Also, why doesn’t journalists ask Trump if he is sending his son or grandkids to school 🤔 He was a fool to have a nutty 🥜press briefing after Biden/Harris day.
I'm Joe Biden
vote for biden so we can bully him for 4 years😎
Joe Biden proudly announced he's running for Vice President.   Text joe For-Vice-President 😄
After getting blistered by Biden and Harris the president comes out and says the same old shit. He better start telling America what he is going to do in the future or he's going to lose the presidency. America wants new ideas for the future.
me too that is why I thought of it!  I am scared Biden is going to take all I have.
Long read. But well done! Biden and Harris make first appearance together at a campaign event. #print
I'm waiting on the  to call out all of Kamala and Biden's lies. Instead geraldo's panting over Kamala's.....
I wonder how Hunter felt since Biden sounded like he had only one son Beau.
Sounds like Beau was Biden's only son 😂😂😂
Biden said Trump called pandemic a Hoax. WRONG Fact check 👇   Biden said Trump said very fine people ( Charlottesville) WRONG  Fact check 👇
Biden said Trumps administration put is in this hole. Trump wouldn't help assist states with COVID.  Fact check: China put America and 188 other countries in a hole. President Trump had hospitals built, sent a navy hospital ship, respirators and mask, tests, and a slew of money.
Joe Biden said Trump called Kamala nasty and mean towards his appointees.  FACT CHECK: Kamala's behavior was nasty and mean towards Biden (not an appointee) and Kavanaugh.
The Press has been in a gym inside their hula hoop circle waiting on Biden and  Harris to show up for almost 3 hours now.
Biden is too old, too wishy-washy.  Harris is too polarizing.  Who you voting for
Why is Biden/Harris 1 hour late to their event? It's not like they have a country to run or anything else to do. We have a basement dweller and Harris hasn't been on the job in a long time.
Listening to the news I thought to myself to ask any liberal if you had $500,000 in the bank or Stock market or wherever, who would you trust with your money more, Trump or Biden?
"We knew that Joe Biden’s vice-presidential pick wasn’t going to be an NRA member or a Second Amendment supporter."  #Ladsongunshop #summerville #goosecreek #charleston
BS! You’re just trying to cover up for Biden’s obvious diminished mental capacity! Joe can’t possibly hold it together for a 90 minute debate! Hell he can’t hold it together for 15 minutes with a teleprompter! Joe’s an incompetent moron and we all deserve to see it!
Fox news headline:  Trump repeatedly called Harris "nasty" except the video of his words says otherwise. The way she treated Kavanaugh and Joe Biden was nasty. HUGE difference!  Stop creating hate and division
Fake news from Fox news: They keep saying President Trump called Kamala Harris nasty. He said the way she treated Joe Biden was nasty. BIG DIFFERENCE
Biden should've picked Tulsi.
Biden has been in Politics 41 years... what has he done, please tell me
Criticizing a voter base that Biden doesn’t particularly attract, bold 🤐
The Snore/Whore ticket AKA Biden/Harris ticket will go down faster than Kamala on Willy Brown.
Kamala: I believe the women who accused Biden of sexual misconduct.  He is a pro-segregation racist! Biden: Kamala, will you be my runningmate? 🤦🏼‍♂️
Biden and Harris 2020 i guess 😔
As to your first point, I think the fact that he picked her even after she was an “aggressive attacker” shows Biden is an adult who can handle strong criticism. You don’t have a second point worth addressing.
Trump Attempted To Upstage Biden And Harris But CNN And MSNBC Ignored Him
I find it extremely tone deaf that the Democratic ticket is Joe Biden who doesn’t support weed legalization and Harris who has laughed about locking up drug offenders. Not to mention the party voted for it not to be part of their platform
Joe Biden's phone is upside down 🤦🏼‍♀️
So joe Biden chose the woman who put people away for years for smoking weed
Biden/Harris   The most Pro-abortion ticket ever. Sick.
you let the comb eater ( Amy Klobuchar) lie.  President Trump never called Kamala Harris nasty! He said the way she treated Joe Biden was nasty.
Didn't she call Joe Biden a racist?
Didn't Kamala Harris call Joe Biden a racist? What kind of ticket is this going to be. Vote  Democrats out in November.
Just be sure to check Biden’s comments before he gets on camera. 🤦🏾‍♀️  Congrats 🎉
Biden is removed and Kamala is our Potus
Remember when Kamala Harris said she believed Joe  Biden's accusers.
Kamala Harris is the VP pick for Biden
There is no doubt that  will have an important role in the Biden administration.   She is that good.
Joe Biden here. Big news: I've chosen Kamala Harris as my running mate. Together, with you, we're going to beat Trump. Add your name to welcome her to the team:
Told you......Biden chose Kamala Harris
Joe Biden's "type" is Gretchen Whitmer, but he will be forced to pick Kamala.
Biden also knows that one foot goes in front of the other going down a ramp and he doesn't need assistance to do it.
Yeah! Like not having wasted the taxpayers time for the last 40+ years as a corrupt Washington politician doing absolutely nothing but enriching yourself and your family at the public’s expense!! That kind of wasting time Mr Biden????
Dems will remove Biden - insert VP
If Rice is the pick and Biden wins she'll be President soon after and will be able to make all of the evidence about Obama's corruption will disappear.
This says everything you need to know about Joe Biden.
Biden's a serial plagiarist. He just can't help himself because he's never had an original thought in his life.
Man, I can’t wait to vote for Joe Biden and every other Democrat on my ballot. You sir, are insane.
They say Trump lies. He has been eclipsed by this guy, even pre-dementia. Says A LOT about Biden. This needs to be in a Trump TV campaign ad. Nothing in the world worse than someone lying about their school credentials. Like a soldier wearing medals they didnt earn.
I don't think Biden is allowed in those meetings. He isn't the person making the decision on his VP pick.
Are they Biden's political advisors 😂😂😂😂. Sounds about right!
Bless your heart.  Speaking of bunkers, anyone seen Biden?
I am glad you posted this picture for Sleepy Joe Biden his touching is just plain creepy unlike the Pres who seems to be expressing mutual affection and party atmosphere for his girlfriend at the time?
Biden's religious community.
Dems like to complain about Russia interfering in our elections as they've spent years interfering in Israel's election.  Obama/Biden created  "V15" victory 2015 to oust Netanyahu and the incumbent government.  Obama/Biden used FBI to hurt our election.
I have never in my life wanted to be a "token" female and I don't respect any woman who let's herself be used for political purposes. The most qualified person should be Biden's VP pick!
Agree! It's not like Biden is gonna bring in the most corrupt and incompetent people he can find, like we have now.
Wrong - Biden approves of defunding police and gun confiscation.
Obama/Biden years.  U.S. Postal Service’s financial troubles have been well publicized for years. The worst of it came in 2012, when the USPS lost $15.9B dollars, followed by $4.8B and $5.3B in 2013 &amp;2014, respectively (Fortune)
Come on, double-standard journalists. Show some bravery and report the facts. Quit covering your ears in denial. What would you do if this was Trump trying to bamboozle Biden?
I guarantee you if Biden were to be asked about the details of what happened to Michael Brown and why he would go into that blank state he's so well known for!
President Trump's team are going to have a field day with the info they find on whomever Biden picks as his VP 😂😂😂
President Trump holds China accountable for it's actions. Biden and his cronies carry their water for them!
Biden has lost his fastball and if you don’t recognize this you are in denial. It would be like one saying you still have full head of hair.
So much bull, marking up things to air.  They can't say anything good about Biden.  Funny stuff.
You have to keep a watch on those dead set on Biden getting elected. It's obvious they're panicking.
Pelosi sounds like a babbling idiot just like Joe Biden. They both have been in government entirely to long and it shows. Vote Democrats out in November.
If ignoring policy, people should be asking how can Biden possibly pick anyone more corrupt, evil or incompetent than what we have now.
like i fucking hate biden, but my hate for a proto fascist far exceeds that. the party is becoming more progressive with each election, and the progressive wing is really good at forcing concession out of the centrist wing. we keep that up and we can bulldoze down future trumps
Wait a minute, (Biden) said you ain't black unless you vote for him,so I'm Cherokee Indian when will he promise to give our land back (Biden) maybe if we vote for him.lmao.
It takes a real journalist to stand up to the downward spiral of a racist running for president, Joe Biden.  A real journalist would find no need to ask a trash question after President Trump just signed an executive order to help Americans hurting financially.
Biden himself is bizzare!
Biden can't complete  sentence
Correction: Cutting #SocialSecurity and #Medicare isn't a *Republican idea. Joe Biden has tried cutting Social Security and Medicare aleast 5 times.. the most recent as Obama's VP, as part of the 'Grand Bargain'  We need #MedicareForAll!
Correction: Cutting #SocialSecurity and #Medicare isn't a *Republican idea. Joe Biden has tried cutting Social Security and Medicare aleast 5 times.. the most recent as Obama's VP, as part of the 'Grand Bargain'  We need #MedicareForAll!
Very much, as Biden is incompetent so VP will be our president quicker than you think
Bias media  Biden can mock President Trump's faith, but Trump can't mock his.
And it's been announced that Biden has picked a VP...........☝️
Biden lost already. He can't compete a sentence.
It really worries me that Michelle Obama is back in the news. I'm afraid Biden is going to make her his VP pick 😳
Is it just me or does anyone else start to worry when she comes out of hiding all of the sudden? I'm still afraid she will be Biden's VP pick!
Shouldn't matter what the Russia loving, corrupt, enabler party thinks now. Biden may not be world wisest but him and his pick will be less criminal and more competent than what we have now.
I do believe Hunter Biden had a problem with cocaine, yes. Interesting that Biden would even bring this up as an example.
Just like Biden.
JOE BIDEN IS THE ANTCHRIST
I bet Joe Biden throws out the name of his VP pick now to change the subject from his inappropriate comments about black folks all thinking the same.
Biden didn't call out anybody. He doesn't even know what year it is FFS. The guy has dementia. It's not funny,he's sick. It's going to be very obvious at the first debate. Biden doesn't know how to use a flip phone,much less twitter.
Biden's a placeholder for whomever his cronies decide either to be his VP pick or his replacement.
The whole world is waiting for November 3rd and your landslide loss to Joe Biden. I would say good bye, but I want your life to suck even more after you leave office.
In your dreams! Biden will be our new and A REAL PRESIDENT
I don't think a rehash of the 2016 sound bites would benefits Joe Biden.  Kamala Harris is ready to be President.
Well, Biden is pro-infanticide, a big no-no against the tenets of the faith the *claims* to uphold, and the Dems have booed God at their convention.  Not a big stretch for President Trump to say that.
Trump says Biden is 'against God'  via
Keep lying to yourself, you know Biden has lost his fastball and now must rely on the off speed pitches where hiding from the public is his biggest strength. Watch him closely with the get off my lawn anger, unable to string multiple sentences together.
Where's Twitter and FB when Biden &amp; his campaign say that President Trump is responsible for the deaths of 150,000 Americans? That's a flat out LIE. A virus killed these Americans NOT Trump. A virus no one here or in any country  has any answers on how to stop that China spread.
Biden has an empty look in his eyes. I saw the same look in my grandmother's eyes when she had Dementia.
I don't know if you noticed scumbag, but this is happening under YOUR administration not Biden's.
Now do Biden!  This isn't news!
For tRump to say today that “Biden is against God” is desperate new low even for this sad Prez after all the personal tradegies Joe B has gone thru you think he didn’t find comfort in his faith. This is from a man that follows no religion and holds a bible upside down.  😱🙏🤯🌊
We are going to vote...for Joe Biden.
There it is. Biden will take the hands off approach.  As it should be.
But Joe ain't racist.......  "Latinos have a diversity of thought unlike blacks who all think alike."  -Joe Biden  "You ain't Black"  -Joe Biden   "Your a junkie"  -Joe Biden   "First "clean" African American candidate"  -Joe BidenOn the eve of the democrat convention Biden will not appear on CBS, NBC, Good Morning America, Meet the Press. None. PBS? None! Whats up?
BTW you'd have to be a moron to elect Biden and b-l-m,6,839. BTW youd have to be a moron to elect Biden and b-l-m, What say you?
He wasnt too stupid to realize what he had done.. He knew exactly what he was doing and I would put money on that Obama gave direct orders for Biden to do that!!! The Taliban gave up their leader and our President gave up Seal team 6...
. I know you will never see this but: - Legalize marijuana. - Release inmates on marijuana charges. - Consider and publicly discuss UBI at some level wink wink  - Expand Medicare to COVID related health issues. You will beat Biden.
Biden and the USPS are both living in the past.  The USPS needs an overhaul and Biden needs a rest home.
Like the billionaire trump who spent Over 139million of taxpayer money. Yeah I wouldn’t worry about the 400k Biden gets.
Playing the old game of Hidin’ Biden
Sunday show convention tradition out the window... Biden hasn't taken any Qs since the rollout.
Brain Dead Biden and Heels Up Harris ..!
Yeah and what Biden and Harris will do for black people if elected??? I have not seen anything yet that make me want to move the needle. Need to do more besides saying Trump needs to go.
Joe Biden sounded like he was threatening the country. I certainly didn’t like the way that felt the 1sr second I read it. It was instant jab in my heart
Here you go. Biden has a record so stop with the tears
we all just assuming Biden’s gonna be dead right
Tweet from  Dr. Claud Anderson Powernomics   Both Biden and Trump need to meet with Dr. Anderson as soon as possible about restoring the black community   -- shared via UberSocial
Trump has never had an original thought. He always copies other people. Biden has a female running mate, now Trump will want a female running mate. Anything can happen. One thing we know for sure: Trump is impulsive and always shoots himself in the foot.
Uncle Rudy is talking about accountability.  Must be Trump's/Russia's final hour to go after Biden.  DON'T fall for it.  #VoteBidenHarris2020
I've been asking, what is the top accomplishment of Joe Biden after nearly 50 years in public office? So far no one has tried to answer.
Love you buddy.  Biden will get out debates by contacting Covid at Dem convention. Basement ventilator shots. Kamala by his side. TV visits from Obama and Hillary. Med records confidential. How low can rep. go. Making fun of a sick man!
Hey love you brother.  I just figured out how Biden will get out debate. Catches covid at dem convention. Candlelight vigils with televised visits from Hillary Obama ets. Basement ventilator shots. HOw low can republicans go! Making fun of a sick man.
Biden doesn’t know who dressed him this morning 🙄
Joe Biden will give his acceptance speech at the nationally televised Democratic Convention next Thursday. Who else thinks Trump will try to steal Joe's thunder by dropping Pence from the ticket an hour before air time?
Riiiiiiight....... vote early before they debate and Biden shows everyone what a Dementiacrat he really is.
On the Dem side, "Fops for Biden."
Joins Twitter in 2020 as a Trumplican but claims to be a moderate Dem in profile.  So when did the Party move too left? Biden? You can’t possibly pretendTrump is a moderate Dem. So why still claim to be a Dem?
Of course. Like Obama, Biden will open the US Treasury (which is full of taxpayer money) to bail out his corrupt union bosses. Democrats are all about the grift.
I believe (rightly or wrongly) that Biden will do more to try and bring us together whereas I believe Trump will continue to throw fuel on the hate and divide fire. I am just one person, but that is what this election comes down to for me.
His country needs him to endorse Biden. I hope he steps up and does the right thing.
Hillary Clinton would 'consider' working for a Biden administration  via  Biden will be in a nursing home in a week; or, dead. Dementia is his only safe place.
Jennifer, did you mean Trump instead of Biden?
Opinion | A Biden-Harris ticket is Trump’s worst nightmare
This isn’t me falling in line either. I will fight tooth and nail to get progressive policies passed in a potential Biden administration. But to get there, the neoliberal HAS TO GET OUT
As a staunch progressive and BernieBro, PLEASE PLEASE vote for Biden. I have my reservations about him and believe me I’ve brought them up before. But I’d rather fight Biden on M4All than a literal facist bent on destroying democracy and the USPS. PLEASE VOTE FOR BIDEN PLEASE

Biden’s foreign policy will be different from Obama’s but even worse, not better.
I can't image people are still undecided whether to vote Trump or Biden... If you're still unsure, maybe just sit this one out.  I would be worried about you out in the real world.  Just stay home.  For real, what is left to figure out?
Haha, Biden facemask suggestion is good.  If Trump orders a face mask mandate it will look like he is following Biden.  If Trump refuses to order one it will look like he doesn't care that people are dying.
Why Bernie couldn’t beat Hillary Clinton or Joe Biden -  Exhibit A 👇🏻
Hopefully she votes for Biden. 😂
The 2 party system gives you the choice between Biden and Trump (or Hillary and Trump) if you could change it from the inside our choices would have been Bernie and Rand Paul.
How cute that Twinkie Boy is calling Joe Biden by Trump’s childish moniker.  Maybe we should just refer to you as Twinkles 🤣
Biden has no boundaries. No morality. No sense of accountability. Then again, Trump doesn't either...
I'm voting for Biden but just like with Hillary it's because I was dragged to do it. I won't enjoy it and will feel disgusting and will be blamed or insulted afterwards for not supporting him sooner but I don't like Trump

— might be due to preexisting immunity.”  But the liberal media is still telling everyone if you don’t wear a mask you will die! Joe Biden wants you to wear a mask whenever you go outside, even if you are all by yourself and miles away from another human being. What a moron.
I feel fly AF in my   socks! This isn't sponsored. These socks are my gift to myself each month with my subscription. Oh, and to show it's not sponsored, fuck Trump and fuck Biden.
Jill Biden should be ashamed of how she is allowing the Democratic Party to USE her HUSBAND! She needs to take him home &amp; CARE for him not allow ppl to make fun of his declining mental health! My father went thru this! It’s horrible &amp; she is a monster for allowing him to be used
The protests give me hope. I just wish more people would realize we'd have had the same protests under Biden, but he'd pretend to care but do absolutely nothing.
HOW can Dems feel good? Biden PLAGIARIZED &amp; LIED his way thru life, school &amp; campaigns! He barely graduated college is being used by the party &amp; his wife who should be ashamed of herself. He needs to go home, be cared 4, not allow ppl to make fun of his declining mental health!
A lot of us sacrificed our time, energy, &amp; money for him &amp; he didn't stand up to them. He didn't challenge Biden at all. In 2016, Trump used his base as leverage. "Vote for me or they walk." In 2020, Bernie could have but didn't. We would have walked into hell for him.
Also in the neighborhood and we can’t wait to update our Biden sign! 😍
Biden will create economic conditions where everyone makes less.
Looking forward to the police being exactly the same as they are today, but at least the baboon won't be tweeting. No Medicare4All under Biden would be great compared to no Medicare4All under Trump.   "It's okay, everyone! This is democratic tear gas!"  That's how you sound.
She's probably called "that Mexican" by Biden.
Didn’t Biden just take credit for it? Or were you outta that email loop?  Poor Sandy
If you ain’t lyin you ain’t Joe Biden
Now more than ever, Washington needs new, bold leadership. And our Lowcountry needs someone who will stand with them, not with Biden and Harris. #SC01 #SCpol #LowcountryFirst
I think  is a great choice. I am very excited about her becoming Vice President. Biden will be a much better President with her advising him.

Joe Biden Is Not Going To Get The Obama Coalition Back Together
The same people who still haven't accepted the last election are pushing the idea that President Trump won't accept the next election.  Why does no one ask Biden if he'll accept the results? The same reason they didn't ask Clinton. They believe it's safely in the bag.
They haven't moved an inch. What are you talking about? Biden said less than a year ago he is proud of the crime bill and still supports it and NOW he wants to give them even MORE money. Harris is down with ICE and calls herself the "Top Cop".
🤣 “If Biden wasn’t your first choice, join us so we can get Trump out of office.” What a slogan...🤦🏼‍♂️
Does Biden qualify as a "modern thinker"?
Runner ups for Democratic Presidential Campaign motto’s: -45 won’t keep you alive! -We’re not high on hydroxycloroquine like Trump! -Biden-ing our time to start this Harris-ment! -Biden/Harris .. we are blessed with age AND color! -Have you NOT been paying attention, people?!?!?

Good vote for Biden the pedophile because apparently you’re fine with that.

Joe Biden’s choice of Sen. Kamala Harris as his running mate spurred a flood of enthusiasm and fundraising, but experts say some voters of color might still be hesitant to support the ticket due to concerns with both candidates’ records.
I will one up you, if you vote for Biden in November you're a racist! Biden has been a racist his entire life. That ain't changed because he's running for president!

Michael Cohen makes a good point.  When Biden gets into office Trump's cover is blown, all his shady bullshit will be exposed.   Trump is going to die in jail.

I never said he was a Marxist. I said the DNC has a Marxist problem, and they see Biden as a vessel.
I knew Biden was a racist! Not once today did he try to sniff Kamalas hair!
I was gobsmacked. She said, on air, that she doesn't think Biden will live to see Election Day? WTF
Also I think Biden loses AZ, GA, NC, OH, and probably FL, which would put Biden at 279 after he wins the usual states plus MI, MN, WI, and Penn
When I was watching Biden and Harris, I felt a sense of calm. Such a different feeling than when Trump is on tv.
Something tells me Joe Biden and Kamala Harris are going to create some "good trouble" for Trump. And John Lewis is smiling!
So did Joe Biden already know he was probably picking the woman who lost the primary when he said he thinks black people aren’t diverse?
Russian bounties is a false narrative. Iran had bounties on troops under Obama/Biden, BLM is literally a marxist organization (read their website, their founders are also Marxist), North Korea diplomacy has been at its peak, they weren't peaceful protests

The POC you seem concerned about went for Biden so overwhelmingly in S.C. they resuscitated a dead campaign, completely turned the tide, and gave him the nomination. Why? They trust him to beat Trump who they overwhelmingly “dislike”.
That would honestly be a benefit I’d love to have so vote Biden fuck trump
Excellent point. I am too. And the other thing the 4 of us have in common is there is no scenario imaginable where we don't cast votes for Biden-Harris!

If I was a Biden voter I'd want to keep him hidden away as much as possible too.  This is the most noncampaign in history. Three months from election day &amp; a major candidate has yet to make a major speech, only allowed short segments with friendly media &amp; he usually botches that.

Something that Trump hasn’t considered (in regards to him secretly supporting Kanye to subtract Black voters from Biden) is that those voters will most likely vote Dem for all other races down the ballot.
I know I’m not naive enough to think that a Biden/Harris ticket is gonna bring any tangible or historical change. I know I wouldn’t care if a billionaire, who is part of the problem, tweeted me. I know I was minding my business until you quote tweeted me.
Funny how much despised Biden during the debates and calling him out for his racist record which is correct and now she is happy to be his running mate. And for him to pick her despite her terrible record as an AG. This ticket is a joke.
The Democratic ticket will unite our country around Donald Trump.  Nobody want the disaster that would be Biden/Harris.
Piecing together voice clips out of context to bash someone has never been a good campaign tactic. It’s just stupid and childish. Notice how quiet Biden’s campaign has been. He’s smarter than you.
Kamala Harris’ criminal justice record is not good. Her “tough on crime” policies left many nonviolent prisoners locked up. If I was Joe Biden, I probably wouldn’t have selected her as a running mate. It might hurt them as it did to her brief stint presidential run.
Your prior post said 23k jobs would be lost, now it’s 19 million? Talk about an exaggeration!! I hate fracking. The Biden ticket has job training for those working in fracking to be retrained in sustainable energy.

Trump has never had an original thought. He always copies other people. Biden has a female running mate, now Trump will want a female running mate. Anything can happen. One thing we know for sure: Trump is impulsive and always shoots himself in the foot.

I've been asking, what is the top accomplishment of Joe Biden after nearly 50 years in public office? So far no one has tried to answer.
Love you buddy.  Biden will get out debates by contacting Covid at Dem convention. Basement ventilator shots. Kamala by his side. TV visits from Obama and Hillary. Med records confidential. How low can rep. go. Making fun of a sick man!
Hey love you brother.  I just figured out how Biden will get out debate. Catches covid at dem convention. Candlelight vigils with televised visits from Hillary Obama ets. Basement ventilator shots. HOw low can republicans go! Making fun of a sick man.
Biden doesn’t know who dressed him this morning 🙄
Joe Biden will give his acceptance speech at the nationally televised Democratic Convention next Thursday. Who else thinks Trump will try to steal Joe's thunder by dropping Pence from the ticket an hour before air time?
Riiiiiiight....... vote early before they debate and Biden shows everyone what a Dementiacrat he really is.
On the Dem side, "Fops for Biden."
Joins Twitter in 2020 as a Trumplican but claims to be a moderate Dem in profile.  So when did the Party move too left? Biden? You can’t possibly pretendTrump is a moderate Dem. So why still claim to be a Dem?
Of course. Like Obama, Biden will open the US Treasury (which is full of taxpayer money) to bail out his corrupt union bosses. Democrats are all about the grift.
I believe (rightly or wrongly) that Biden will do more to try and bring us together whereas I believe Trump will continue to throw fuel on the hate and divide fire. I am just one person, but that is what this election comes down to for me.
His country needs him to endorse Biden. I hope he steps up and does the right thing.

Jill Biden should be ashamed of how she is allowing the Democratic Party to USE her HUSBAND! She needs to take him home &amp; CARE for him not allow ppl to make fun of his declining mental health! My father went thru this! It’s horrible &amp; she is a monster for allowing him to be used
The protests give me hope. I just wish more people would realize we'd have had the same protests under Biden, but he'd pretend to care but do absolutely nothing.
HOW can Dems feel good? Biden PLAGIARIZED &amp; LIED his way thru life, school &amp; campaigns! He barely graduated college is being used by the party &amp; his wife who should be ashamed of herself. He needs to go home, be cared 4, not allow ppl to make fun of his declining mental health!
A lot of us sacrificed our time, energy, &amp; money for him &amp; he didn't stand up to them. He didn't challenge Biden at all. In 2016, Trump used his base as leverage. "Vote for me or they walk." In 2020, Bernie could have but didn't. We would have walked into hell for him.

Biden will create economic conditions where everyone makes less.
Looking forward to the police being exactly the same as they are today, but at least the baboon won't be tweeting. No Medicare4All under Biden would be great compared to no Medicare4All under Trump.   "It's okay, everyone! This is democratic tear gas!"  That's how you sound.

The same people who still haven't accepted the last election are pushing the idea that President Trump won't accept the next election.  Why does no one ask Biden if he'll accept the results? The same reason they didn't ask Clinton. They believe it's safely in the bag.
They haven't moved an inch. What are you talking about? Biden said less than a year ago he is proud of the crime bill and still supports it and NOW he wants to give them even MORE money. Harris is down with ICE and calls herself the "Top Cop".

Biden just said president trump is going to leave office with the worst jobs record in history. Morons will believe that.
Awesome speech by Biden
What an asinine comment!  Not a single black woman that I works with me had a kind word to say about her. In fact, the comments were that Biden just lost the black vote!
This Biden speech is the most calming thing ever.  A reminder that the POTUS can be a leader who assures the public that we can move forward, that we can look forward to better days, that the best is yet to come.  I forgot what that was like. It makes my soul happy  Ready to work
