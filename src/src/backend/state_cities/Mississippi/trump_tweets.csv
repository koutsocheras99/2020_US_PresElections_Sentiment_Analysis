1: It's hard to say anything about Trump's "deal" with anything, insofar as he's a black hole of reasoning. For all we know they didn't pay enough rent on a building in 1987. 2: THAT said, the other point, re: mail in voting, is probably a lot to do with the current push. 3:
The United States has not conducted live nuclear weapons tests for 28 years. But reports indicate the Trump Administration has discussed re-starting the nuclear testing program.

Her question was about immigration not voting patterns or voting blocs. His point: The solution to immigration is a diverse response based on whether you're Cuban or Venezuelan or Mexican or Puerto Rican. Trump has more Latino support than the African Americans that support him.

Trump's combative communication style works for Trump. No one else had has success trying to ape it. Just seems like that's what Reeves is trying more &amp; more to do. It's exhausting. (That's all I got.)
Also, my guess is he's not as popular with the rank-and-file as he might think. Couldn't break 50% in the primary. To paraphrase Lloyd Bentsen (consult your Google machine): We know Donald Trump. Donald Trump is popular with many Mississippians. And Reeves is no Donald Trump.
He is more, umm, "in touch with reality" than Trump. Hedged is right. He's been consistently behind or simply beside others (often *on his own side*) on key issues (funding, flag, COVID). Sticking your wet finger to the winds isn't leadership. Many of us MS GOPers expected more.

I‚Äôm not handing my soul over to the Lincoln Project, but I‚Äôll align myself with anyone that wants to defeat Trump. He‚Äôs an existential threat and we need all hands on deck.
President Trump did not say he was going to change the election day. He said that was an option just like Pelosi said mail in voting was the answer to stay safe.

Why in the Hell would the first African American president purposely ignore HBCU'S? Nice try though. Obama still has a high approval rating among African Americans and trump has about 3% support, if that much. Wonder if trump spoke with Putin today?
Does trump or anyone in his family have business dealings with China? Case closed! Only the gullible   can't see through trump.
One week into trump's presidency he started taking credit for the economy. He hadn't signed one bill. Hadn't passed any new legislation at that time. As usual he hijacked the accomplishment of someone else and claimed it as his own. Biden will fix his mess like Obama fixed Bush's

I think the whole thing is to get everyone spitting feathers about "Trump is trying a coup" and not talking about the economic collapse.  USA has the worst of both worlds- massive economic damage and Covid is raging out of control.
Seen it suggested it is just a distraction for the US losing one third of its economy due to Covid on Trump's watch.  Trumps is a master of changing the subject. Been caught letting Russia kill American troops? No problem for Trum. He just says something outrageously racist.
And so begins the coup. What remains of the American republic is at serious risk.

Mine to, but not just trump trolls, but the Russian bots.
To rid us of the trump infestation I would wait as long as necessary.
Anyone supporting trump must be a racist and that goes for all of those miseducated Black who apparently do not realize trumps past behaviors toward Blacks. Trump will use anyone and then throw them under the bus, with their reputations destroyed
Agreed. And give POC a reason to turnout. Just to beat trump won‚Äôt be enough.   it is what it is. üòÅ
Trump and his supporters have done more damage to the church than any democrat has ever done.  The Church in this country is responsible for electing the most hypocritical president ever and his hypocrisy is primarily ecclesiastical.
Trump has done nothing to champion the cause of Black Americans. Trump is unfit to be an American much less to represent this country. He and his enablers have made the USA the laughing stock of the world.
I saw a company on red bubble selling dump trump t-shirts and they‚Äôve sold out twice, but I haven‚Äôt seen any on the streets.
The last poll I saw, trump was leading by 1 point in Ohio.
As I sit here watching the news I do not see how any rational person could vote for trump. We need to get back to real leadership and accomplishments this country is known for. We can not afford 4 more years of the embarrassment known as trump.
Pools are open and packed. But since they are not Trump supporters it doesn‚Äôt make a memo.
I hope this doesn‚Äôt scare anybody, but this is a possibility whether we want it or not. Or Are you willing to having another unlimited amount years or trump.
Trump will and is cheating to try and become a two term illegitimate president. But the stable people will not allow this to happen, trump will lose in the largest landslide Biden victory.
This is a shameful attack on a good man, no one believes trump; however this is a bridge too far. Trump does not deserve to be anywhere near Vice President Biden. Trump is sick and needs to be hospitalized!
when I think about trump and all of his limited followers.
COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) ‚Äî Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine tested positive Thursday for the coronavirus just ahead a planned meeting with President Donald Trump.
The world is worried about trump and they‚Äôre watching us to see what we‚Äôll do about him.
Did twitter ban trump?
Yeah, that‚Äôs actually the furthest from reality. I may be bad enough for the people to storm the capital. I really don‚Äôt know what else to do if trump and all the republicans win another election. We‚Äôll be totally politically powerless.
Then we have to use that excuse for all trump supporters.
Electing more and more democrats. American has some serious issues that‚Äôs been around long before trump. Don‚Äôt u wanna make this a better place for all? Biden can‚Äôt do that on his own. It‚Äôs our responsibility. Kicking back letting elected officials do whatever is what got us here
I hope he goes all the up to November. The bigger the trump loss, the more republicans go down with him. If trump quits without being beaten, that lets republicans in leadership off the hook.
And trump knows he needs Ohio and isn‚Äôt doing anything to help them. I‚Äôve said it before, he‚Äôs doing everything he can to lose. He must have a fix in. Any other president would be taking the lead, pressuring Manuchin or Nancy to get this done.These are his voters, for Pete‚Äôs sake
I‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs smarter than Ivanka but just in case, he better keep it away from trump.
Agreed. No way trump wrote that.
these no phucking way Donald trump wrote this. Who is this?  ? We know damn well it ain‚Äôt trump.
How can Political Figures get away with Flat Out Lying to the American People like this?! Just Like Adam Shift, when he stated he has Proof of Trump and Russia Collusion!! I think Lying to the American People like this should have a Penalty as bad as Lying to Congress!
I don‚Äôt doubt but I just can‚Äôt imagine trump sitting down to read such a weighty book as mein kampf.
It‚Äôs as if trump took it straight from the nazi playbook.
All to please trump? Really?
And sure trump has to rack his brain to figure out who everybody was talking about. ‚ÄúWho‚Äôs John Lewis? Oh, that guy.‚Äù
Why would she leave him? She knew what she was marrying.  I‚Äôll agree that they will probably continue living apart, why divorce? Trophies wives have their place. The real question may be, how long before trump divorces her and takes another wife. That‚Äôs been his MO
President Donald Trump hosted the swearing-in of the first Black Chief of Staff of the Air Force, Gen. Charles Q. Brown.
President Trump signed into law legislation that will devote nearly $3 billion annually to conservation projects, outdoor recreation and maintenance of national parks and other public lands. The measure was overwhelmingly approved by Congress.
The Trump administration is awarding more than $35 million in Justice Department grants to organizations that provide safe housing for survivors of human trafficking.
Removing trump will be the biggest victory in most of our lifetimes. It means we rescued democracy, for a little while longer. It would mean good defeats evil. That must be our goal, if not, we‚Äôll get what we deserve.  For me, Joe cld choose a broom and I‚Äôll still vote 4 him.
If trump is defeated and removed, compassion will explode spontaneously. I don‚Äôt have any doubts about that. I‚Äôm certainly not worried about pissed off, inbred, trump supporters.
Trump 2020 .
Sounds like he‚Äôs only speaking for himself and his own view point.
I‚Äôm not sure his idea of ‚Äúfairness‚Äù is the same as the rest of us. You and I see fairness as an equal playing field. Trump sees ‚Äúfairness‚Äù as anything that doesn‚Äôt go against his wants or needs. This is from being raised as a spoiled brat.
I‚Äôm hopeful, but we‚Äôre in trouble America. It‚Äôs cool that some of us are focusing on trump, but there‚Äôs something more sinister going on beneath the surface.
They don‚Äôt care. As long as trump is attacking the ppl that they hate, he‚Äôs their hero.
NEW YORK (AP) ‚Äî A Manhattan prosecutor trying to get President Donald Trump‚Äôs tax returns told a judge Monday that he was justified in demanding them, citing public reports of ‚Äúextensive and protracted criminal conduct at the Trump Organization.‚Äù
WASHINGTON (AP) ‚Äî President Donald Trump said Monday that he had fired the chair of the Tennessee Valley Authority claiming it has betrayed American workers.
Who had the gun &amp; who pulled the trigger? An individual with no regard for life no respect for others or the rule of law A self-centered thoughtless criminal is to blame not Trump One has control of their own brain Criminals disrespect the rule of law  put blame where it belongs
They got beat up and sprayed because trump said the needed to dominate.
Microsoft confirmed Sunday it is in talks with Chinese company ByteDance to acquire the U.S. arm of its popular video app TikTok and has discussed with President Donald Trump.
Because they support trump and hate everything the protests stand for. The hate black lives matters and support police brutality.
He was hand picked and installed by trump, I understand, but for my region, mail in ballots have never been an option, so we can‚Äôt miss what we never had.  But I suggest each individual figures it out. We have 3 mnts to devise a plan. Ask ur city officials.
Trump only makes plans for himself.
The real donald trump
No. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs so surprising. It happens a week ago, and nobody knows. We‚Äôre all chasing trump‚Äôs laser pointer. Haven‚Äôt we had trump overload yet? We‚Äôre playing right into his hands.
Wow. It‚Äôs such a shame all this is going on and we‚Äôre focused on trump‚Äôs bruise.
Well, she is. The money trump screwed her father out of. I don‚Äôt blame her. Like John Bolton didn‚Äôt do it for the cash.
yall think yall bullied trump into wanting to ban tiktok but really, trump is a BUSINESSMAN. he gave china no option but to sell it to microsoft. he really finessed the entire system ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è yall not ready for that yet
Trump‚Äôs Fantasy.
The vote to renominate President Donald Trump is set to be conducted in private later this month, without members of the press present.
Right! This may be a practice run for trump, but it needs to be a practice run for the rest of us. We can‚Äôt help but watch Portland is shock, but we need to watch them to learn also. Especially learn the tactics of trump‚Äôs goons. This may be the norm up to nov. Ky and chi R next.
Well if Dr. Trump said it, it must be true. he must know what he‚Äôs talking about, right?
Well, I do hate what America has become, and trump gets a lot of the blame, but his supporters and their ilk get the rest.
President Donald Trump said he will take action as soon as Saturday to ban Chinese-owned video app TikTok from the United States.
That more people hate trump than love him.
Trump if you ban tiktok I hope you know nobody‚Äôs voting for you buddy.
And I don‚Äôt like how some of you motherfuckers think either. Don‚Äôt say you‚Äôre pro black but support Donald Trump.
Can you believe it? This is happening on the streets of an American city and cable news is talking about how trump‚Äôs angry at TikTok. I don‚Äôt get it, Americans likes fireworks and loud noises and people getting clubbed over the head.
There‚Äôs no way the trump admin. Expected this much pushback from the citizens.
Excuse me but should I vote for him (Biden) because he was Obama‚Äôs Vice President? Should I vote for him because if I dont it will be a vote for Trump? Somebody anybody help me out here..
and I‚Äôm including the media in this too. They loved the rating that trump gave them and it‚Äôs not much different today as we sit home waiting for the handout we feel we deserve.
We‚Äôre so dumbed down that we‚Äôve almost forgotten how to think for ourselves. We need cable news to tell us how to feel about things that affect us personally. Now, it‚Äôs easy to see how trump advance to the White House, we were too busy being entertained by his antics and I‚Äôm
Maybe after today. But this happened. 5-4 in favor of trump and his wall.
Supreme Court sides with Trump on building border wall with diverted military funds
Trump was on there too...funny you failed to mention that.
Only if it closely connects trump rape or pedophilia, otherwise, I could care less about Allen dershowitz.
You must think everybody is as stupid as trump supporters? Nobody wants to kill their children in a virus infested school. What the hell is wrong with you? You‚Äôre not doing blow with don jr. are you?
Trump is so embarrassing
Honestly Mel, we should all be in the streets now, so he‚Äôd know not to pull that shit. If we had already been in the streets, the republicans would already be trying to push him out. But since we‚Äôre taking trump‚Äôs shit, why should they do anything other than what the MAGAs want?
He is. Nobody is going to help do anything now. Trump and McConnell has killed all those services.
They‚Äôre still standing and growing in size. There‚Äôs whispers of the feds pulling out, so if they can hold the line, they‚Äôll leave. Barr, trump, and Steven miller‚Äôs plan isn‚Äôt working. They‚Äôre just pissing off mothers.
They‚Äôre too busy chasing trump‚Äôs laser pointer. They‚Äôve allowed themselves to be tricked into trump taking over the media cycle again and he‚Äôs not saying anything of importance or consequence. Just mindless drivel.
He was installed by Donald trump do do trump‚Äôs bidding.
Nope what? You like trump as president?
He‚Äôs a drug addled crazy person, but he‚Äôs just a puppet. He‚Äôs nothing to fear, it‚Äôs the evil that‚Äôs controlling him. If our numbers swell in the streets daily, trump republican allies will be telling him to get the Phuck out. Sounds crazy I no, but it‚Äôs that point in our history.
Apparently a lot of resisters are. So many are stressed and nervous about trump and the craziness he spews from his pie hole, while hoping someone comes to save them. It‚Äôs as if they refuse to believe they‚Äôre more powerful than than trump. Many of us are paralyzed with fear.
Nope. Still hopeful. Most of what trump is saying isn‚Äôt within his capability.
That tells who he‚Äôs beholden to. Not the knuckle draggers walking around with a trump 2020 t-shirt on.
ATLANTA (AP) ‚Äî Herman Cain, former Republican presidential candidate and former CEO of a major pizza chain who went on to become an ardent supporter of President Donald Trump, has died of complications from the coronavirus. He was 74.
Trump suggests delaying the election because of potential voter fraud.
We no longer care what trump asskissers have to say.
Don‚Äôt let trump take your vote.   We have to remember just how powerful we are. We control this whole process. This country can‚Äôt continue to be a country without us. Our vote, our money, and by the work we produce. They need us a hell of lot more than we need them.
No. I don‚Äôt think it will matter in the red states how many people die. They‚Äôre do just as Florida is doing. Wait for the surge to pass regardless of how many people die because there won‚Äôt be a blanket shutdown order from trump, like the last time.
DONALD TRUMP KILLED HERMAN CAIN!!!!!!!   Who thinks trump cares that he‚Äôs killing people? I don‚Äôt. He only cares about himself and Vladimir Putin. I never thought I would say this, but he cares more about Putin than he does about Ivanka.
You aren‚Äôt the only 1 unable to sleep &amp; not because of Trump. It‚Äôs due 2 citizens like yourself being a voice for the Democrats spreading hate, division, lies, &amp; destruction then blaming everyone but yourselves. Are U hopeless &amp; defeated yes if U remain death dumb &amp; blind 2 truth
So what? That doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs over for us. Say all that happens, what then? Just give up and be trump‚Äôs slave? That‚Äôs how your tweet comes off. That its all over and there‚Äôs no chance of survival. I‚Äôm sorry, I‚Äôm not built that way. But I understand your fear, but trumps no God.
Yes. Nancy is doing the best she can. She also tells us in every interview she does, that the American people have the loudest voice. Ppl don‚Äôt seem to hear that part. They need our help a lot more than we need theirs right now as far as trump goes.Republican led Congress investigated Benghazi. No wrongdoing found. Y‚Äôall focus on Clinton‚Äôs to distract from Trump.

And i much as i like Pres. Trump I dont agree with his opinion on the mail in voting. What i see happening though is a lot of ballots not making it to counting booths to be counted.
Because she‚Äôs been discredited. Refused a polygraph after saying she would take one and still cannot give a date or location of the attack. And she forged her transcripts to get into law school which severely impacted her credibility. Even a trump supporting lawyer dropped her.
Guess I‚Äôll vote Trump
Trump at +140 is a good bet to me.

President Trump Lays Out His Vision For Economic Prosperity by Putting American Workers First
One of the coolest byproducts of this is that it's forcing Christian supporters of Biden/Trump to discuss pros/cons Biblically.  Had a very painful discussion, no argument with a "woman be quiet" believer this morning.  Just dawned on me that a female VP will just kill him?!?!

Oh you mean the poor kids and the white kids? You know... the thing??? ü§£ü§£ü§£ Trump has done more for minorities than any other president. As Biden put it, y'all believe the "truth" instead of facts. What a sad sad world we live in.
And how do y'all think Biden would have handled this? Remember... Trump was the one called a xenophobe for stopping those flights. He said he wished we could do something like those things to get rid of it. And the advice at the time was to save masks for first responders.
I am glad Trump is holding his shit together. Let him golf. Your ass and many of your friends and families asses have a fighting chance because of this bad orange man.
ü§£ü§£ü§£ you realize these were the ones calling Trump a Xenophobe for stopping the flights out of China right??? Wow. No... if they were in office, you may not be making these stupid comments. Think about that for a moment.

Trump does not want mail in voting because he is afraid of being voted out, but couldn't his small band of supporters do the same thing to out vote Biden? Trump doesn't want mail in voting because RUSSIA needs the votes done electronically in order to hack the system!

Doesn't matter what Trump says. It's what Biden might say that I'm worried about.
And the RNC is not sharing much with Congessional Republicans who are begging for the money.  It's all about Trump first and only Trump.
I dunno. They seem desperate for debates (prolly bc they expect Biden will put this foot in his mouth like he usually does) but Trump doesn't want to release the returns. Would be interesting to see what they decided to do if Joe gave that ultimatum.
Biden should make all debates contingent upon Trump releasing his tax returns. üí°
Some of them are quite explicit that they would prefer #Trump over Sanders.
Lmao ppl hating on Trump and so naive how ridiculous Biden is talking.. shows ppl voting for Biden is completely oblivious and doesn‚Äôt care for the future of our country.. Go Trump!! Going to destroy Biden when they debate

That's because he was a terrible congressman, his DISTRICT suffered while he was looking for ways to BLAME TRUMP and white people for everything that happens.

I love how you Trump cultists always compare your cult leader to Obama, who was not a good president.  But it's the only way to make Trump look good isn't it?
Every Response Biden makes during the debates should begin, "Mr. Trump, didn't you previously say...."  Let the debates focus on what Trump has said and NOT done during the last 3.5 years.

I've pretty much managed to put that all aside and focus on getting Trump out. It's still with me though. Prolly always will be.
Seen a lot of videos of him lately. He may hate trump but he‚Äôs been much more conservative as of late
Trump 2020
Can we just rename the GOP as the Grifter Party?
This got me thinking. You know who else is in a damn good position to provide a temporary alternative to the USPS if Trump and his goons succeed in crippling it? WALMART. They have stores everywhere. IJS. UPS would also be in a good position to help out. Temporarily of course.
This may be true but cant change the facts that that was in January and trump said NOTHING  till now.  So I still think its personal for trump.
If #Trump does succeed in forcing this nation's #fascist shift to its ultimate conclusion, it will be with the active help and complicity of the "Democrats". It cannot happen otherwise. You cannot effectively oppose #fascism if you treat them as any part of the solution.
I'll never underestimate a fascist with sycophants but Trump can't just "ban" Tik-Tok. Like he can't EO it and Apple and Google just shrug their shoulders and kill it from their app stores. It doesn't work like that. It will be a protracted court battle
Then the Idiot in Chief turned Covid-19 loose on red states. Cultivating anti-maskers while forcing early re-opening. Trump Mob can't even do the right thing for the wrong reasons!
So a trump supporter came in the store today and I checked him out with a nice attitude. I did so because this is my job and I have too. Why he snatched his receipt. I wanted to get my scanner and throw it right into his back while he walked away. ‚ò∫Ô∏è they really are testing me

please look into this.....Trump has no real control over the mail thru the new PMG, if he did he wouldn't care if people did mail in votes, BUT what he really needs is to get people to electronically vote so Russia can hack the system.
trump better sit his orange head ass tf down cuz istg if he bans tiktok i‚Äôm gonna go crazy
Big deal.  We fill stadiums with rock bands and sports events.  And you don't get it do you?  All Biden has to do to win is NOT be Trump.  That's  it.  That's  why people  will vote for Biden.
These are the constituents who made up 47% of White Woman and 67% of White Men who voted for  Hispanic Men and Women voted 28% for Trump, while 18% of Asians and 14% of Black Men followed suit. Black Women voted 98% in favor of Hillary Clinton in 2016.

The President of the United States is supposed to be an exceptional human being. It is hard to imagine a greater contrast than the greatness of Barack Obama and the soulless, moronic inhumanity of Donald Trump.

Ultimately, none of this matters.   Undecided or swing voters have turned off vast majority of press. These voters will watch debates, look for big speeches or major moments in October...and 95% of those will be Trump or Biden.

Harris makes case against Trump in first speech as Biden's running mate
he Mississippi Democratic Party is responding to Senator Kamala Harris being chosen to be the running mate of former Vice President Joe Biden.
What did they use for Mississippi, which currently has no flag? My guess: a sweaty cape once worn by Elvis, bought by Biden at a flea market in 1985.
I also think that it‚Äôs interesting that the Kamala and Biden walk off song was ‚Äúmove on up‚Äù by Curtis mayfield - which was also sampled by Kanye West for ‚ÄúTouch The Sky.‚Äù Who some have called Trump‚Äôs shadow running mate. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs intentional but still funny.
And yet, I can hear the Stelter‚Äôs, Cilliza‚Äôs, and Navarro‚Äôs of this world having multiple orgasms over the unserious allegations. Plus, it‚Äôs more clear now, Biden is a placeholder.
It‚Äôs weird to see people being unable to hold hands and hug in this announcement and official bringing together of Biden and Harris. It looks like a blind first date that went well but ‚ÄúI still don‚Äôt know you like that... yet.‚Äù
Biden can literally call someone coon and you‚Äôd still vote for him üòÇüòÇ. The way the right and left uses blacks is hilarious .
YES.  And she will be next POTUS after Biden, I believe.
We‚Äôre working hard for you at 4 ! It‚Äôs the ticket that many people are talking about. We have reaction to the Biden-Harris ticket. Later the outlook on college football. We have the answers.

At this point all we can do is get Trump out, survive 4years until we can get meaningful candidates.   I don‚Äôt have high expectations for Biden/Kamala if elected, but I guess we have to make due like we always have.
Let‚Äôs keep it a buck. We hitched our wagon to Biden, the weakest candidate, even though he did NOTHING to earn our vote besides stand next to President Obama.   So weak that he NEEDED a woman of color (Kamala) on the ticket with him and his chances are STILL shaky.
What I meant was that Biden wasn‚Äôt my first choice to win the Democratic candidate nomination, it was originally Bernie Sanders. But I‚Äôm going to vote for him now because we got to get what‚Äôs already in the White House OUT of the White House.

Presumptive Democratic Presidential Nominee Joe Biden announced Kamala Harris as his running mate on Tuesday. But who is Harris, exactly? Here‚Äôs what you need to know about the VP nominee:
It‚Äôs gonna need a deep cleaning, a sanitization, and an exorcism.  The Biden‚Äôs will have to stay in Blair House.
I‚Äôm not sure Biden counts, because he was never formally a candidate. You can‚Äôt lose if you don‚Äôt play.  I think the answer is no. Mondale (1984), Bush (1988), and Gore (2000) all had to fight for their nominations, but they got them.
Oh before I go to bed I hope y'all die mad about that question Harris hit Biden with in primary.   She wasn't wrong and she was nicer than I would've been.   In fact she was nicer than I was on here at the time.   #KamalaHarrisForVP #HarrisBiden2020

Biden is Catholic!? Just because he supports Pro-choice that doesn't negate his faith. As a Catholic myself, that should be something that is on an individual and their faith.
It would be a counter strike via left wing super-pacs that feel as if the ticket is not Liberal enough. They don't have to be Pro-Trump to be Anti-Biden/Harris

I‚Äôd rather go for the lesser of the two evils. Biden wasn‚Äôt my first choice either.
Biden has also been accused of sexual assault and Kamala Harris has publicly stated that she believes his accusers, so like I have said...everyone politician has something. You have decided that there are things you are willing to ignore or overlook.
I'm over it  Vote for Biden or don't and get on with it.  You don't have to actively work to tank the campaign because you're in your white dude feelings.

Kamala Harris has been selected to be Biden‚Äôs running mate. How do you feel ?
I accept Kamala as the the vp. She has her flaws, but then again, I believe any other candidate Biden could've picked would also have flaws. She's not my choice but im not upset about it. Just a little dissapointed.
At a debate Kamala chewed him up. Yet Biden chose a critic and a straight talker to be his VP. Strong leaders like dissenting voices.  (and Oh she is a strong woman too)
Joe Biden selects Senator Kamala Harris to be his vice presidential running mate    Twitter had #VPpick as a trend and upon clicking it I was shown only a few tweets that were vulgar racism and sexism attacks on Kamala.   I think Twitter  is broken.

Joe Biden picks California Sen. Kamala Harris as running mate
This is what is needed in the White House though is it not?   Have a VP to hold the president accountable instead of blindly following everything he does. I originally wished Biden would pick a right-leaning moderate as VP to help unify ever-so-slightly.  Kamala isn‚Äôt a bad #2.

My VP pick? Karl Malone. Biden needs someone with some consistency and reach. With "The Mailman" you get that, and since the USPS is an election year issue, the nickname helps. Plus, he's from Louisiana, helping with southern votes, and COULD finally turn Utah.
And they give Biden a pass when he consistently loses his place in the middle of his own sentences, and they even try to justify his nonsensical word salads which are often reeking of racism.
I‚Äôll still vote for Biden in the fall, like we have a choice, but I will burn the establishment down for the next midterms and draft  to primary them in 2024, because no one in the running to be VP would be so disloyal to run against them in 24 if they weren‚Äôt picked.

I‚Äôd vote for Biden if he picked a can of tuna fish.

You say I'm not black enough if I don't vote for Biden, and then they say I'm a know sellout if I sided for Trump. I don't like neither one of them Mfs. And, for my vote it really doesn't matter. Because it's basis on popular and electoral shit that is rigged. .....üßëüßëüí©ü§°

Don‚Äôt confuse aging for not seeming bright. Biden knows how it works. Notice he doesn‚Äôt take the obvious shots at Mitch, chances are if elected he‚Äôs gonna have to finesse a Republican Senate.
I was a Harris supporter, but she couldn‚Äôt meet her moment when she had the opportunity. Also, there seems to have been some issues with Maya(her sister) and her campaign staff. Also a female Obama doesn‚Äôt work, I like her at DOJ that‚Äôs the dream job in a Biden administration.
Below I will list a variety of Presidential candidates as well as what party they're running as and a link to their platform. I was originally planning on waiting for Biden to choose a running mate but apparently that's never going to happen.
Yeah. Biden would have an alert  on the highway when he forgets who he is and where he is going

If the ACC cancels, Biden could try to pick up Notre Dame.
The VP pick is  decision.  Tweets that divide the party around that choice are counterproductive - especially as he has said he has made up his mind.  To defeat Trump, we should stand united behind the Biden and her ticket.  #Whomever.
I doubt any will see this, but, I am a 60ish black male. Anybody else think Biden could sharpen his image up a bit with a haircut. ( i.e. tapered around ears and neck? ) I realize it has nothing to do with character, but the hair bothers me.
Just cause I‚Äôm black who said anything about Biden
I believe Trump‚Äôs presence on the right emboldens an equally authoritarian response from the left. If he‚Äôs left in office they‚Äôll be no room for left-center or right-center. That‚Äôs the importance of Biden in this case.
Every country on earth except Russia would prefer Joe Biden
I‚Äôm not ignorant of our voting system. Republicans and democrats will both destroy America, just in different ways.   Just curious where do you get 1.3% from? You can‚Äôt blame people voting 3rd party for Biden‚Äôs potential loss. If he can‚Äôt get the votes to win then that‚Äôs on him.
If I didn‚Äôt vote for her, it wouldn‚Äôt make a difference. I just wouldn‚Äôt be voting in that case. I‚Äôm not going to vote for someone (Biden/Trump) who are extremely questionable, who‚Äôs policies I don‚Äôt agree with, and who perpetrate the same corrupt political machine in the States.

#LetHerSpeak at the debates! She missed one morning campaign rally in Jackson MS and was back on the trail that afternoon in Hattiesburg.  Meanwhile Biden is MIA and trump hides in the bunker signing unconstitutional orders. #voteVold #LetHerDebate
You can easily same the same for any other candidate. Voting for Biden or Trump won‚Äôt accomplish anything more than it would voting for her. It‚Äôs not about making a statement as much as me voting for someone who I consciously agree with. A vote for someone is simply a vote.
I never suggested that Biden didn't help write the Crime bill.  Biden didn't make racist District Attorney push 3 strike rules. Biden didn't make states across country adopt three strike rules. Our criminal justice system has needed rehauling  for years. I practiced criminal law.
You really think Joe Biden will do a good job? He doesn‚Äôt even know what fucking day it is! Also, why is an article about providing more made in a America products prompting you to profess your hatred for America? We need less liberal cancer like you in this country!

The Left are masters.   Clinton had a vulnerability. Russia, The uranium, speaking fees, foundation.  The solution, call Trump a Russian. They are doing it again.  Why? Because Biden has been an agent of every country but America and his family have made millions for his betrayal

First question to Harris..You said Joe Biden is a racist and you believed his accusers of sexual assault what has changed?
Think Reagan (Trump) vs Mondale (Biden) in 84...
Presumptive Democratic Presidential Nominee Joe Biden announced Kamala Harris as his running mate on Tuesday. But who is Harris, exactly? Here‚Äôs what you need to know about the VP nominee:
People using ‚ÄúJoe Biden is racist‚Äù as a reason to keep Trump in office when Trump‚Äôs dad was a whole ass KKK member.   It‚Äôs giving me delusional.
Incredibly, Elizabeth Warren, who has only served as a senator since 2013 and ran for president once, already has half as many "baggage" stories as Joe Biden, and trails Bernie (a 30-year congressman/senator+2x POTUS candidate) by fewer than 1,000 results. 22/
Incredibly, Elizabeth Dole, the wife of 1996 GOP nominee Bob Dole, has 1,000 more "baggage" stories than 3x POTUS candidate Biden. She has 2x as many baggage stories as 2x POTUS candidate Bernie, who has been in Congress since 1991.  She merely *considered* running in 2000. 19/
Joe Biden, who has been in the U.S. Senate since the 1970s and run for president three times now (&amp; spent four years as VP) has about ‚Öô as many "baggage" stories as Hillary Clinton, who came into the national spotlight as Dem nominee Bill Clinton's spouse in 1992. 18/
And yes, there are articles about men's baggage. I searched  for [candidate first+last name] + [baggage]  Bush 43: 21,017 Hillary: 19,943 Trump: 15,273 E. Dole: 4,438 Biden: 3,478 Condoleezza Rice: 2,879 Bernie: 2,488 Sarah Palin: 2,371 Warren: 1,585  16/

Now, Kamala is also racking up the "baggage" headlines. Shortly after Biden's announcement, the Washington Times ran this treasure on the left.  But hey, at least it's "Kamala's Baggage." In 2016, the Examiner wrote about "Bill's Clinton's Baggage for Hillary." (right) 3/
Whoever is pulling his strings picked her because of her skin color. We all know Joe Biden is Alzheimer‚Äôs to the past of no return!
at this point, it‚Äôs either Biden or Trump and honestly i‚Äôll rather deal with Biden for the next 4 years than having to deal with Trump‚Äôs bullshit

Choose better phrasing. ‚ÄúTaps‚Äù isn‚Äôt a great choice given the sexual connotations... ‚ÄúIn Historic Pick, Joe Biden Taps Kamala Harris To Be His Running Mate‚Äù
Pre-emptive grievance politics on the left is something.   Biden announced Kamala Harris, who will be the first Black or Asian VP nom for a major party.  The rush to lament how you'll now be "smeared as a racist &amp; sexist, akin to Hitler" for the next 4-12 years is... interesting.
Joe Biden can barely put two sentences together! How‚Äôs he going to do anything? He is absolutely NOT what our country needs!!! Trump has done more for this country in the last four years than that man has done in his entire life!!
A Kamala day keeps the Biden away.
Biden picks Kamala Harris for VP. She will be the first African American woman nominated for VP by a Major Party. Kamala Harris will join Sarah Palin and Geraldine Ferraro on the short list of woman nominated by a major party for Vice President.
Say his name! His name is Bernell Tremmell and he died simply for his political beliefs. Say his name! He doesn‚Äôt fit blm‚Äôs agenda so the left will fail to acknowledge his existence. If this was reversed and he had a Biden sign there would be chaos. Double standards are SAD!
Hey   I'm having trouble deciding on a Biden/Harris' ticket name. Your a sharp guy.   'Sleepy Joe &amp; Kamala Blow' Or 'Basement Biden &amp; Heels up Harris'  Go take the poll
I think we can all agree we should probably settle on the official name of the Biden/Harris ticket. #maga #wwg1wga
She has been a VP contender since she  endorsed Biden. Harris is the first Black woman and Asian American person on a major-party presidential ticket.
Live Coverage: Biden selects California Sen. Kamala Harris as running mate
#BREAKING: Biden selects Kamala Harris as running mate&gt;&gt;
JUST IN: Joe Biden has chosen California Sen. Kamala Harris as his running mate.
True for this election, but kind of bigger than usual when you consider Biden would not run as an incumbent (probably)
Presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden is expected to announce his pick for vice president, as early as today, according to CNN.
I dont get the acceptance speech controversy? Didn't Dr Fauci tell us all to stay home if we didn't have to go out?  Where does Mr Trump live?  Would they be pissed if Biden gave his speech from his basement? #maga
Obama/Biden had complete control with a super majority for two years to pass anything he wanted and all he barely do was ACA
Gosh, I just can't figure out why people don't have a visceral hatred for Biden like they did for Clinton, it's such a mystery.
Biden in 1985 used the N word to refer to remarks another person made. In 2020, TCU‚Äôs head football coach said the word in the same context to tell a player the team will not use that word. The same people voting for Joe Biden are the same people that want TCU‚Äôs head coach fired.
He knows Biden is a bad investment
Biden's campaign refuses to comment on his search, but his team has been in recent contact with a small group of finalists that includes at least four women of color.
Scaramuchi is a nut. Supports Biden because it is best for the republican party he says. I say, the hell with both parties, do what is best for the American people.
Bullshit Biden
I do not care how you feel about Biden, VOTE FOR BIDEN
Vote Biden and he will let you play with the hair on his leg.
If Biden were going to pick a white woman, it would probably be a good idea for him to pick one with more experience than that so as not to piss off the groups that handed him the nomination.
They always say if Trump acted a week earlier how many lives would have been saved.... how many would have died if he waited weeks like Biden would have
Oooohhhh.   Lol I‚Äôm kidding. You can obviously vote for whoever. But ü§Æ at the choices we have between Trump/BidenThe reason so many of us have left the party and now must vote for Biden and Harris to restore our democracy
If I have to crawl through broken glass, fire, and anything the lying trump campaign puts before me I will get to my voting place and vote for Biden and Harris! We must restore decency to the White House! Peace AKA Howard.
You‚Äôre afraid of Biden and Harris? And you‚Äôre losing sleep over it? Please explain bc that don‚Äôt even sound right. Are you just a walk away account stirring up Schitt? You tweeted, so make me understand.
Vote for Biden anyway.
I like having a fair and free election that would give Biden a chance to be president. Kamala being the VP nomination means nothing if trump steaks another election.
That‚Äôs cool. The trump one is made in China, and Biden‚Äôs made by union workers.
Not surprised.  Didn‚Äôt his son and Hunter Biden have some ‚Äúdealings‚Äù together?
This is not new and the reason why the GOP is losing members by the thousands. Reasonable people find it appalling what trump has done and now represents the GOP. True republicans must now vote for Biden and Harris to reclaim decency for American!
No no Trump every thinking person will vote for Biden and Harris and there are more that 90% of the thinking population. Trump will lose in a landslide and that includes the popular vote and electoral college. Resign s a name s  a be yourself the embarrassment
Man I‚Äôm scared to fucking vote ü•¥ü•¥ü•¥ who the hell yall voting for... cause Biden crooked too ü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Exactly how the country will look 6 months into Biden/Harris administration
‚ÄúYou ain‚Äôt black‚Äù-joe biden
We the people feel sorry for you trump. You are sick and need help. The country is better than you and your pathetic followers think, we are moving forward together without you. Biden and Harris 2020.
Electing Biden won‚Äôt be easy. After we finish celebrating Biden‚Äôs VP pick, we should get back to fighting for our right to have a free, open, and fair election. Did you ever think we would be using these words in reference to an American election? We acting like we‚Äôve won already
Yeah, they‚Äôre gonna be a problem should Biden win.
Didn‚Äôt take long to get the establishment teat suckers to start screaming about NO DEBATES.  Next from you and your ilk is....  Biden should just step aside and let Harris be the pick.  Mail in voting.
I agree that just because you don‚Äôt think Trump is doing a good job makes you bad.  I do think that if you believe that Joe Biden can do a better job it just makes you cuckoo ü§™
Look at how racist Joe Biden has been for years. You ain‚Äôt black if you don‚Äôt vote for me. So  if you don‚Äôt vote Dem you not blk. Typical lib attitude.
What has Biden done in his decades in office. Nothing. Lowest blk unemployment tax cuts deregulations. Look at what‚Äôs happening in lib Dem states. Really??
Great show Joy I am over the moon with excitement seeing Kamala Harris selected as the next Vice President. Howard University and an AKA, Biden will restore this nation to respect and with Sen Harris this restoration will happen soon.
Hallelujah! Congrats Ms Harris! Biden/Harris!! Winner Winner Chicken Dinner!!!!
Joe Biden is on the cusp of announcing the biggest, and possibly most consequential, decision of his political career with the unveiling of his running mate.
Doug Jones is the kind of Senator the US needs more of; he has stood by his principles (including voting to impeach) and voted his conscience, knowing it would hurt his re-election chances. I hope he has a spot in the Biden administration.
The Russians are incapable of denegrating Biden worse than he does himself...!
Since he running as a republican wouldn‚Äôt he take away votes for trump there are still a few misguided Blacks who support trump. Informed people regardless of color are voting for Biden. Trump must be soundly defeated!
Nothing can make me vote for trump. The only 2 things that would make me not vote for joe Biden is if he dies before the election or if we were to find out he‚Äôs a pediphile. Other than those, I‚Äôm riding with joe.
Joe Biden ? Yeah right üòÇüòÇI also want #Biden to win - even though I would never vote for him, and will #VoteGreen instead - because I want liberals to taste the full, bitter truth of our critiques of him (and of #Harris). Many who are Left comrades today were liberals until they saw how awful #Obama was.
This is Biden‚Äôs America. üò±
Where are the Biden flags?? Lol üòÇ
Then which one lies Biden or Trump Joe Biden hell he don‚Äôt even know where he is Half the time or his sister from his wife I‚Äôm glad it‚Äôs one nation under the thing the thing he doesn‚Äôt know God God is the thing really come on man

Joe Biden had nothing to do with that just like they take credit for how good economy was why do they take credit for everything Donald Trump do
Anyone else have an issue with the people being entrusted with so many ballots choosing sides in a big way?  Conflict of interest and not in the interest of half the nation...
There‚Äôs another pic of him with his hand on a cops knee. Biden is just touchy feely.

The left loves throwing the racism card out to anyone who doesn't share their views. The Dems have went so far left there's not much other choice but to vote the other way. Biden should've selected Tulsi Gabbard, who is more moderate, to sway more votes from the middle and right.
SCORING BIDEN AND TRUMP ON RELIGION
Harris‚Äô policies do not speak to the needs of the many families in Mississippi whose loved ones are incarcerated in #ParchmanPrison and others throughout this State. Biden‚Äôs policies always have favored #MassIncarceration. They both are ‚Äútough on crime‚Äù.
Suspicious signs of a sudden spate of paid "trolls" (professional liars) advocating for #Biden and #Harris, using the socialist rose symbol üåπ and the #GreenParty sunflower symbol üåª to disarm opposition. Don't be fooled. Engage as hostile, or report (as fake) and block.
This has been the Achilles heel of the  Instead of pushing the  to provide their constituents with viable candidates who share their interests, establishment Dems within  force us to accept the status quo. This will ultimately be Biden‚Äôs undoing
Joe Biden wins we will not have a nation we will be sold our soul if we vote for him
Yeah if you vote early you will not see Joe Biden make a fool of him Self in the debate
Are you ok? This woman is the one running for president not Biden!!
I'm voting for Joe Biden.
She is as lost as BIDEN and KAMALIE.
Yeah - her Secret Service escorts will help keep Biden from wandering off and getting lost - has to be easier than supporting her limp body and trying to make it look like she was self-propelled.
I almost agree - his and Obama's policies for the area were so bad and destructive that they welcomed a sane President Trump having a hand on the tiller...
Amazing - he teams up with a former prostitute and now they come up with a quick, Un-Constitutional signal to show us how they would run things...and they're stupid enough to think it plays well with Feds micromanaging everyone ...

After Calling For Major Mandate, Biden and Harris Hurry Off Stage to Avoid Questions
She originally made claims that he Biden would say inappropriate things to her during meetings. And made her uncomfortable when he touched her. Turns out she worked in the mailroom and she oils not have been in meetings with him.
It was made clear her private personnel records would not be with Biden‚Äôs. She‚Äôs avoiding requesting from the right agency because she has never filed a complaint.
But when she went to request her records she went to Univ of Delaware where Biden‚Äôs records are kept. Of course her request was denied. And she tweeted about the denial. It fits the story she‚Äôs trying to portray of being railroaded from having her story investigated.
And her personnel records are separate from Biden‚Äôs. Her information is confidential and wouldn‚Äôt be with his records. SHE has to request any of her records from Senate.
And yes originally she did say she file a written complaint. But after Biden said he would release his records, she changed her story and said she never mentioned rape or assault in any complaint she filed.
How about you give us a date of the attack. How about you give us a location. How about you go to the Senate for your personnel records rather that Univ of Delaware when it was made clear that your confidential records wouldn‚Äôt be with Biden‚Äôs records.
‚ÄòShe goes with her gut': Mississippians react to Kamala Harris being chosen as Biden‚Äôs running mate
Mispronouncing Kamala's Name Is Racist...Until Biden Does It
I suspect there may be more genuine open-mindedness among Trumpezoids than among Dems trying to convince themselves that Biden and Harris will really help matters.
Yeah Great Bill, how about a ban on reporting all of Biden‚Äôs scary record  ?  Couldn‚Äôt hurt
Also, you know, Billy!  Harris supports and approves, Biden, right!  Well then, she is pro abusing a mentally lacking, possibly Alzheimers!? And treatment like that is considered ELDER ABUSE!!     Can you imagine... HOW SHE WILL TREAT THE REST OF OUR, INCAPACITATED AMERICANS??
Biden/Harris just lost
Her and Biden r made for each other and deserve each other.
Lol not shocked.. Joe Biden is just as evil.. he‚Äôs the type that wears a face mask in his car by himself
y‚Äôall know the difference between biden and trump and if you don‚Äôt you‚Äôre just that damn stupid üòë
Biden/Harris. America‚Äôs dream team.
&amp; 3 months out from the election is kinda a shit time to get that started. If we all truly felt this way about our choices why are these our choices? It‚Äôs a reflection of us as people. Fuck joe Biden but if he gets trump out of office &amp; we can start to gain the ground needed
I don‚Äôt see that being pushed at all I just see constant shitting on Biden &amp; Harris. It would be fucking amazing if we could not vote for the old racist/rapist democrat or republican at all this time, but we need to do more to get people on board with that type of thinking first.
A lot of you people are bitching about Biden &amp; Harris, but what are you going to do vote for trump? Or are you going to for Jorgensen? Either way you keep him in office, the only way to not have Biden nor trump in office is to kill the mindset of a 2 party system.
Good choice, Mr. Biden.

Me too bc not voting for Biden is a vote for trump and not voting for trump is a vote for Biden.
no disrespect.  no offense...if we vote Democrat it will be for you. Not Joe Biden. Come on man he can't even answer a question much less be the answer America needs. If anything he will make things worse.
Lmaooooo ‚ÄúBiden just picked Kamala as his running mate 2 days after WWF Kamala passed away. Stay woke.‚Äù
Anyone have the joe biden in a Newport suit meme? #wwg1wga #QAnons  #meme
Clearly people don‚Äôt pay attention to or care what Biden has said and done or not done willful ignorance shows it‚Äôs ugly head
The most horrifying thing about this choice is that #Biden cannot last out a 4-year presidential term in the cognitive shape he's in, and may not last out the campaign season. This is effectively #Harris vs #Trump. #KamalaForDictator
Like Kamala saying she believes in Biden‚Äôs accuser three months ago but now is his buddy and vp canidate. That‚Äôs what silences victims
So far Kamala is tied with COVID-19, with Biden and murder hornets trailing.
By way of nominating Biden and Harris, two of the worst offenders of state endorsed poc imprisonment methods, the DNC essentially nominated Jorgenson.
So BIden is now kinda like Ted Cruz when Trump called Cruz's wife crazy and ugly and accused Cruz's father of being involved in the Kennedy assassination.
More have died with the regular flues than with this.  This was just another plot to try and bring Trump down.  The power hungry will stop at nothing to try and get One World Order.  Only the ignorant and those seeking Power will be voting for Biden whose Dementia is so apparent
She‚Äôs the best choice. Trump can‚Äôt attack Biden anymore for wanting to ‚Äúdismantle‚Äù the police because she‚Äôs the former AG of California. Susan Rice would have brought up Benghazi all over again. She‚Äôs a strong pick for the centrists who are on the fence.
Yep, has the background but has to understand that VP means VP.  Advise Biden and make sure he wins at his endeavors as POTUS.
Biden selects Kamala Harris as his running mate.
And it was revealed she can request her own records thru Senate. Biden cannot give say to release her personnel records. She has to do it. But she went to Univ. of Delaware where Biden Senate records are.
And Biden spoke on this stating that he would release any pertaining personell records back when she claimed she made a written complaint back when it happened. Then she reversed saying she never did.
Anyone who doubts the deterioration of Joe Biden needs to see this...should remove all doubt...
I don't think it would be presumptuous at all to announce a few key cabinet posts. It allows the public to compare and contrast what a Biden admin would look like against the Trump faux-admin.
Biden hasn't said a single word about tax increases, except to say he will raise taxes on incomes over $400,000 and that multi-million dollar corps who pay nothing now would have to start.  Your tweet smacks of desperation.  Laughable.
It's hilarious how the Biden folks refuse to admit that his campaign was a zombie before black women saved it. They get so upset they can't even form sentences as can be seen in that video! Bless their hearts!
Wow! Joe Biden is a idiot! #Trump2020
Yes! Joe Biden's campaign has a debt that needs to be paid to black women and it's past due. They here to collect!
Who cares?  Biden and VP will both losers in November!
And Biden‚Äôs brain is fried!
This could be Biden‚Äôs Sister Soulja moment if he came at this hard, but the Democrats think they can hide him, hold the ball, and run the clock out.
I think it already has. Biden‚Äôs lead in the RCP average has dropped three points in a month.

CNN Guest: There Are No Left-Wing Outlets That Exist to Tear Down Trump
Authorities told her she herself (Tara Reade) would only have the power to request her personnel records from the Senate even if she had made a report. Confidentiality laws. She intentionally requested records at University of Delaware where Biden's records are.
Very hard to investigate if she cannot give a date of the attack. She originally claimed to have reported the incident but when Biden stated he would release any personnel records she then claimed she didn't make a report.
100‚Äôs?   Count Biden‚Äôs parade today. You may get closer.
Yeah it‚Äôs a real mystery as to why Sanders never attacked Biden for praising George Wallace.
He says he won't choose until he gets his pudding - then, as they wipe his chin, he forgets he had pudding and demands pudding before he chooses...
I thought Senile Joe was corralled into choosing a 'woman of color'. I guess Kamala would work - she has enough melanin to call herself "Black" - and a side bonus is she doesn't seem to mind being groped by older men to get ahead...just ask Willie Brown.
I say Biden is a Lying Dog-Faced Pony Soldier...
Jim Crow Joe Biden could become the next President of The United States. And all he did was sit by the water cooler during the primaries. And sit in his basement during the campaign. The Democratic movement offers No Hope and No Change. We need a Progressive Movement.

Best picture of the day showing how many of us Deplorables were at the Back Bay Biloxi Trump Boat Parade!! Thousands of Trump Flags, not 1 Biden. Also, no rioting, no looting and best of all, a Great time was had by ever single person that attended. #Trump2020 #winning2020
