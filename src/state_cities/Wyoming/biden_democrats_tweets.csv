U said lack of leadership well I assume your voting for Biden who was against the travel ban and later said it was the right call so your dumb the guy you wanna vote for would have killed thousands more even fauci said the travel ban was a great call your a dummy
the dems are researching the 12th amendment, why? Biden may try to pick Barack as his VP.  Google states the law/ 12th amendment has never been challenged in court.  Why would Barack do this?  He could be the FIRST (and only black) president and VP in US. Mark my words.
watch Biden pick Barack for his VP.  Barack will accept because it will make him the FIRST (and only black) president and vice president of the US.  Mark my words.
I'm thinking Biden is going to pick Barack Obama for V.P., and Obama will go for it because he will be the FIRST president and vice president if Joe is elected.  See its good for his ego.

Dems are fighting for 600 a week so people wonâ€™t go back to work. Itâ€™s no secret they want the economy to crash to get there power back itâ€™s sad they donâ€™t put Americans first like your president trump does. Can u picture Biden fixing anything other than oatmeal
