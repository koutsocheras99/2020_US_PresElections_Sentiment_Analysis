Trump is to blame for his inaction. He did nothing but joke about it and minimize it for months. He is the worst and most ineffectual president we‚Äôve ever had. He just doesn‚Äôt have the capacity to do the job.
That‚Äôs why he was overwhelmingly re-elected to the Senate six times. He was a disaster!  Lol  Trumpers gonna Trump...
He is the most dangerous man in this country. Trump is checked out. Barr is the guy behind the curtain.

It's not as simple as all that. People are more than their views on the issues. They are also defined by their integrity, and Biden's principles are deep-seated. He is not going to give Trump a free pass for his many crimes.

My doctor said this in the very beginning, in March, and it bothered me. But he soon realized that Trump's handling of this was a travesty.
TRUMP SHOULD BE LOCKED UP FOR TREASON!! I am shocked that ALL of our wonderful members of the armed forces don‚Äôt drag him from the White House and arrest him! For them to see what Trump is letting happen to their brothers is reprehensible! Trump is a DOMESTIC TERRORIST!

It‚Äôs all BS Kevin. Trump family is headed for NY State Prison and you missed your chance to denounce him but kept silent! Remember Mr. #TrumpisonPutinpayrollIswear ?  Remember Patricia Cabello-Dowd,  first COVID-19 death in the US? It‚Äôs 157,301 later üëâ:
Trust me both sides want it, I feel Trump has been selected to bring in Police State. Running Biden so he's reelected.
just watching you all navigate the trump era and corona really inspired me that a govt can achieve their goals when everyone including citizens want and have the ingenuity to make this happen!
Wait are we talking about trump‚Äôs visit and multiple vids and pics with Epstein?
But..but...but.. I hear 'ya. It's happened too many times before. We all get excited and even if it's "Earth shattering" news, the MSM just moves on as if nothing just happened. That's TOO convenient for a Grifter, Lying, Conman Like Trump and The Republican Grifting Loyalists ü§¨
Biden could make an ad about being able to eat a cheese sandwich and I would still take him over trump. Our country needs stability and leadership. Biden will bring that until we can get 2 viable choices for change in 2024.

President Trump¬† , when are you going to address [OPERATION SLEEPWALK] ? " If not all FBI Agents are evil pieces of shit then why didn't the good ones do something about the evil pieces of shit ?"
Is this.presidential behavior? Is.this the man who's going to make America proud? Is this man that is better than Trump? He gets upset easily! This "Come on, man" is inappropriate! His "What the hell!"  use is also inappropriate! He's struggling with speech! Presidential? Nah!
You're a Liar.  She was 13 when Trump forcibly raped her.  You know his character. Why do you attempt to defend him? He's disgusting. Hit the 13 year old girl in the face with his fist while he did it.  Picture That!
Yes, there *could* still be a national plan however I think Trump is an #UNFIT leader, weak, and is afraid to do anything. It's been easier for him to go play golf, so that's what he'll continue to do. Maybe that's "Denial"?  He has no Shame, Guilt, or Remorse
Sir! It's not the Trump campaign! For example, during the Democratic debates, anyone with an open-mind could realize that Joe Biden was struggling with his speech! In some interviews, that's happening too. Lastly, why is he rejecting an interview with Chris Wallace if he is okay?
You can look at each one yourself and try to give me an example of where you get your bias and Opinion, but I'd be happy to go through each one and show you how it matches up to Trump Administration - in fact that easy work.  So, take your opinion and go tell it to someone else
Here's a list for you to look over. Funny but when I look at this and the #CorruptAndComplicitGOP and "Corrupter In Chief" Donald Trump, Obviously Authoritarian wannabe (and trying damned hard) I don't see Left Wing or Dem or Liberal jumping out at me. I see  Trump&amp; his Loyalists

Scary thing is that it makes "Perfect Sense" to hear and realize that *is* what's going on with Trump's brain.
That‚Äôs IT! I always wondered why Trump talks about President Obama so insessantly. He has a BIG CRUSH ON HIM!! He wants to be Barack Obama SO BAD! But...The truth is, HE‚ÄôLL NEVER LIVE UP TO IT!   #TrumpIsALaughingStock #TrumpVirus  #TrumpIsANationalDisgrace  #TrumpIsNotWell

I can criticize Trump for being many things: thin-skinned, childish, arrogant, condescending, a bully, a conspiracy theorist; but the fact that Trump supporters go after Biden for losing his mind when Trump isn't too far behind in that category isn't a good strategy.

You took my Tweet as supporting Trump?  I hope the short bus picks you up on time come election day.
He slipped over Trump who was Epstien's bussom buddy and swing partner. Not to mentioned all the other alledged assaults.
Joe is NOT a racist. Trump is. Period
You give them too much credit. They'll get down in the sewer to fight for Trump.
Don't you want to know why Manafort insisted Pence had to be Trump's VP choice?
$350,000 $350,000 just to spend time with Donald Trump. Is that a year or lifetime? Most don't have $350.00 for a monthly bills. What millionaire spends $350,000 a year for mortgage. Throwing away need money. So sad.
Once again, Andrzej Duda Poland's tyrant is just like Trump who is a far - right fascist thug who is trying to force his well on the Polish people and it won't work.
Meanwhile...
Nope. No spin. Never told you where to live. I told you if you don't like American policies you can leave, because its not up for debate. Two different things. Too much spin. You complain but you are still here. And when Trump gets reelected you will still be here!
I heard ‚Äújoe biden has embraced the policies of the radical left‚Äù in an ad and I got kinda excited til I realized it was just a trump ad
Another problem Trump has is he thinks everything should be about him when it is not about you Trump and the kind attention that you are mostly getting not the kind you or anyone else wants.
Underestimating Trump worked out well once already.
To be clear I don't believe that Trump is actually outflanking the Democrats, but he could.
So did Trump dupp them.  He let them start on the massine? and then supported HCQ so no max? is needed?  They are going to lose billions of dollars.
Actually Trump is "novel" in some ways. Compared to his predecessors he's anti-media, extremely egotistic, lack of respect for former presidents, and he's the 1st president to side w/ dictators and not the free world.
I can't trust and highly doubt that Bill Barr "will" stand by "sworn oath" of "not to interfere" with the election by trying to pull some ridiculous political just to benefit Trump.
Once again Trump, you a Christian religious hyprocrit who is the "enemy" of the Bible, the church and of God because you don't respent and stand for what real faith is about.
Given that I‚Äôve seen other ‚Äúconservative‚Äù voices tweet similar enthusiasm for this, it seems more like a plot to convince their low cognition followers that Trump came up with the idea.
Just had to watch a trump ad watching an anime about a bad police state. Know you‚Äôre audience?
Trump or someone on his staff got wise to the fact that "there was a tweet for that" was constantly a topic here. And he often &amp; frequently contradicted some political stand he'd taken years ago. So they're deleting old tweets. Purging. NEXT - Trump gets purged.
So yes, Dems are in a pickle: they can accept GOP demands and cut a deal, or insist on bigger stimulus, allowing Trump to cherry pick popular stuff to do unilaterally.   And allowing you to whine about neoliberalism whatever they choose.
Ambivalence at its finest... "They‚Äôre being drawn now," Trump said, tying the threat of executive action to the ongoing talks in Congress over coronavirus relief. "We‚Äôll see what happens. It‚Äôs possible we‚Äôll make a deal, but it‚Äôs also possible we won‚Äôt."
I completely get hating Trump...but I'll never get supporting Biden.
They don't call him #MoscowMitch for nothing.   So Oleg Deripaska laundered more Russian/Ukrainian money in Kentucky. Not just the alleged aluminum refining mill, but this building former PNC Bank Building. All laundered money. Trump was in on some of that.

I honestly hope you remember your first love. Get as far away from Trump as possible. He is not of God and pulling everyone away from their creator. I met your dad he wouldn't have fallen for the rhetoric.  I wish you well because I'm told to but enough.
"Mr. Trump, who I do not support,"
The same stipulation was in CARES Act. It was also in the bill House passed. And the reason Trump is doing this unileterally is because Dems are insisting on expanded UI and state aid. So how they are useless here? Please be specific.

They just want to muddy the waters. They afraid they could go Trump and lose their democrat congressional seats. They will never report results November 3rd
Trump is the dumbest mother fucker of his generation yet he still grasp that starting illegal wars is bad.
He is talking about many people, including some with their children all standing very close together, indoors and only a few wearing masks. New Jersey has masks mandate laws in effect and indoor capacity limits currently. Except Trump apparently breaks every rule!
Just like Trump.. Blaming others..!!  Real Leaders take responsibility &amp; do their jobs..!! ~ Trump tweets, golfs &amp; watches MSM all day..!!   ~ His Lying  Cheating Orange  is going to lose..!!   #RepublicansForBiden #RepublicansAgainstTrump

I hope this flies too. What i like here, and Biden knows, the latest Trump ads, that have very doctored footage of Biden.
Ghislaine Maxwell thought young Paris Hilton would be ‚Äòperfect‚Äô for Jeffrey Epstein, new documentary claims. (Trump, himself, has previously made remarks about an attraction to Paris Hilton.)
It's all they have. What's wrong with just saying you don't like what Twitter did, but you understand that they have a right to do it? I wasn't even arguing with my dislike of Trump in mind.
But remember, Trump HATES cancel culture!
Its ALREADY COVERED UNDER OBAMACARE and tRump's DOJ is suing to destroy it. Polls must be bad again!
You‚Äôve hit it right on the nosy! The Republican senate will continue to stall, trump will try some bullshite and claim to have saved us. Smh
I mean truly Trump supporters must be getting frustrated that everything they said they loved about Trump he is now ruining üòÇ

This just in! a major never-been-done-before piece of Trump's ambitious new Invisible Care Act (ICA) promises to...hold on to your hats...cover pre-existing conditions! Wait...you mean it HAS been done before? #ThanksObama #TrumpHasNoPlan
Statistically no chance to win. And no real vehicle by which to push his agenda or even realistically start a movement. I think big change must grow from inside the Democrats. Trump did it to republicans quickly so it‚Äôs possible. I‚Äôm willing to wait and prevent a trump win.
Who said it's one of the worst things he's done? You sure do love absolutes, you include them in almost every argument. Which of Trump's lies are bad? Who gets to decide? Do you believe a President golfing during viral pandemic is honorable?

I can't believe in the middle if this pandemic and economic turmoil, Trump is about to hold a "press conference" from his golf club with the club members in the audience. Most wearing no masks. Unbelievable. Smh
How often is Trump golfing? While a great many Americans are dying!?? Remember how much he complained bc  Obama played it ?? Can't wait for actual stats(hrs spent)
It‚Äôs just that it may be too late to matter. Issues like this should be cut and dried yet the courts slow walk everything that relates to Trump taking months to make a judgement.
This audience of country club members watching Trump‚Äôs press conference at Bedminster looks like the parents of the white supremacists from Charlottesville.
Follow-up.... masks were just handed out to everyone in the crowd at Trump's upcoming "presser". This is Trump taking advantage of a captive country-club-crowd, knowing media is present, under the guise of a news conference, in lieu of one of his hate-rallies.
If there was a dog show going on there, Trump would invite the dogs üêï üê∂üêïüê∂üêï into his presser so he‚Äôd have the dogs there to admire him and to give him sought after adulation! Seriously he‚Äôs such a JACKA$$!!

An observation, Trump looks tired, older and heavier. He can‚Äôt speak with clarity without notes Perhaps the pressure is getting to him.
Trump needs to apologize using racial comments on the COVID virus.  It‚Äôs not the China Virus. That is a racist statement
I love that you are willing to admit that there are mistakes on both sides. It's the truth. But it is also truth that trump's mistakes are costing lives and he won't acknowledge a single mistake. Sadly many of his supporters are the same way.
Coronavirus doesn't have press conferences. The virus is not a political issue.  Donald Trump has felt that the virus is political. Because of this, science never played a roll in decision making.   And never will. That's why we need Joe Biden president. Otherwise üëá makes sense.
You know Trump belongs in jail, right?
Your iPhone, websites, twitter, and Facebook have all of your data too. Trump can‚Äôt control the narrative on Tic-Toc so he wants it gone. It‚Äôs all political not for safety.
Of course, this doesn‚Äôt explain Trump‚Äôs self-correction.
And you think Trump is actually aware of this?
I believe we would have still lost lives, but I also believe he wouldn‚Äôt have ignored the scientists and politicized a mask. I think we‚Äôd most likely have a rrsting plan and well any plan other than ‚Äòwishing it away‚Äô.
Obviously because you enjoy watching Trump punish people you hate.  You don't like the man, but you love what he does.  Admit it and sit down.

Trump didn't make the economy good...he ruined it.  The recession was inevitable when he implemented his quick but unsustainable fixes to make it look like he was a savior ( when we didn't need saving).  Recession started in February, before Covid-19
Does Trump's executive order mean he fully supports Obamacare? Like, he now realizes it was a good idea?  Actually, no. He's just trying to give himself credit for something Obama did before him.  Wonder what the GOP thinks of this new-found support?  Wait, they'll suck it up.

The only other main choice is Trump and that is not doable. The man is psychotic. Its sad that this is the best America cou8ld do. 330 million people and this is what you pick. What a damn disgrace to humanity. It is deplorable. But when you weigh the options Biden is Better.

THE BEEZEWAX: Trump Vs. TikTok...The Truth
The one thing I admire most about the press is their uncanny ability to stay in the ring and keep asking Trump the questions he doesn't like. He hasn't been able to intimidate you away. A president has never attacked the press so viciously. Trump has lied, and lied again.
I will also say biden has faults yes big ones but trump is psychotic and will do anything to hold onto power. Biden is old school. He may return us to normalcy and erase trumps wrongs. I hate it but im a staunch sanders backer. I will vote Biden if i must swallow it
From the very beginning, we had a basic mitigation strategy. When Trump took over the briefings and stripped us of the advice of seasoned scientists, we missed the evolution of a working national plan. Now, our abused scientists are even afraid to comment on mail-in voting.
The democratic establishment is pure evil for this i feel your pain. I will say this our goal now must be to remove trump at all costs. Our power comes from down ballot votes. Push progressives the president doesnt matter. Vote as progressive as possible i am.
Except that it is currently trump's America. His inaction and your covid fantasy suggestions have brought this on now.

Yes, just like the entire trump presidency is revenge for Obama destroying him at the WH correspondent's dinner. He's an incredibly small and petty man.

After 74 years as a racist, Donald Trump does not deserve the votes of African Americans, white people, Asian people, Native Americans, Latinos, young, old or middle aged citizens, or the votes of those who are cis, gay, lesbian, trans, bi, queer, etc.

Oh yah black are def not voting for trump who gassed the BLM protestors wishful thinking but black people will never vote trump
FWIW, Donald Trump is correct that what Joe Biden said was hurtful. However, Donald Trump does not in any way give a shit about it other than placing himself on the good side.
Caused by the trump administration!!
If you're racing to the bottom,  you're winning with Biden. What was that fake "go low, go high" drivel. Stay to your principles libs .. CANCEL Biden, he's clearly racist. Biden = KKK, just 50yrs later! Ain't nothing Trump's done, ALL Joe, 30330

That's cool. You have to admit that who ever designed it to resemble a swastika after spelling Trump did a hell of a job. Wow! We could do without it really but the artwork to get it you must admire.
Biden says a lot of racist stuff. Biden has a very racist past. If trump ever said half the racist stuff Biden did then he would actually be a racist, like Joe Biden is.
Trump is banning social media apps TikTok and WeChat, and at the same time has endlessly used Twitter's social media app to further his interests in the United States' public domain. It is autocratic and can have a ripple effect on our ability to use free speech on the internet.
So, here we are in the thick of a health crisis, our GDP is in the basement, the Congress is still out on the fire escape having a coffee break instead of passing a stimulus bill, and this, above all things, is the news that Trump wants us to see in a headline.

Pennsylvania gives you a free stamp for mail in ballots and guarded drop boxes making it harder for trump to cheat with Putin now trumps mad he can‚Äôt cheat again
Trump is much like a sore thumb. He stands out almost everywhere, and it's often because he says the wrong things. Trump can't hear himself, but the FBI surely can; we can. When the FBI investigated Trump, I'm confident without any proof, that there was a good reason.
Trump will roast Biden. It‚Äôs in his blood lol
I guess the idea is to not even duplicate the misinformation in any way. It just spreads it further. But I'd guess that a person could continue to call out Trump for his misinformation by reporting the tweet.
Many times Anti Trump posts mostly he gets me so angry. And so do his followers
Holler at yo boy through the fake news...
Here I agree put in Bernie Trump admitted he feared running against Bernie more than Joe Biden. Trump was relieved that he was facing Joe Biden instead. So the D.N.C. played into his hands.
Very well said story. Yet Trump is no Fascist, racist or Nazi.  However, blithering idiot, disconnected fool, clueless moron sexist, Narcissist, inexperienced fool are facts of his Presidency.  For all the good he has done for America it gets drowned out by all the bad.
Biden has a laundry list of bad choices in Washington. His racist comments and his voting record alone hang him. To debate with Trump would be an act of political Suicide.
My fears are coming True. Too many people are saying they don't want to #Vote for Trump. But will because they refuse to vote for #Biden this to me is very very bad. We have to remove Trump. I dont care who does it. He has to be voted out. We need a new candidate.

President Trump on #FoxandFriends: We provided 52,000 troops to Germany but they didn‚Äôt pay NATO. It was primarily to protect from Russia yet Germany chose to have Russia supply them with natural gas instead of us! Trump has stopped the freebee to Germany!

Great interview with President Trump today on #FoxandFrienda. The 5min. Covid test used at WH is being distributed to the country as quickly as possible (50%) right now. For the 1st time in over 60 years we are profiting from China deals!
I wonder what trump is getting out of this.And how much did Susan get in for her state from Trump  4 her vote
What is going on at the postal service just ain't kosher. Trump's lackey the Postmaster General is up to something
If you are preaching from the pulpit of being the potus..people listen. Sheep. Followers. So many listen to trump and trust him. Like Herman Cain. Some don't survive...sadly.
Gee.  Thanks......I guess trump, who does not read, does not know that Barack Obama and the ACA already signed this into law nearly a decade ago. No credit due to trump here.The credit goes to a real president who always cared, Barack Obama.
Joe Biden is the Democrat‚Äôs Trump. If you don‚Äôt see that you are üôà

President Donald Trump said Friday night he was likely to issue more limited executive orders related to COVID, perhaps in the next day or so, if he can't reach a broad agreement with Congress.
If this was true then Trump wouldn't have won the primary in 2016 and wouldn't have won a primary in 2020.

Black Americans nearly singlehandedly elected Trump in 2016. He set records for his diversity voter gains in 2016.  2020 will smash those records in a Reagan style reelection.

sorry joe, trump cannot be shamed
The corporate media has done an excellent job of keeping everyone home and (barely) containing their outrage against Trump and the GOP. But when everyone gets evicted, I don't care how chirpy the Today show gets, wall Street will burn.
Trump directed the CDC to issue promulgation that SARS-CoV-2 infected seniors should not be housed in nursing homes with unaffected seniors.  Five Democrat governors explicitly ignored this and inflicted a holocaust upon America.

Irony has no place in this administration.
Putin: tell them your name. Trump: my name is Reek.
None of this is going away, none of it will be forgotten. Trump has shown us that he simply doesn't care if Americans die. The GOP are idiots if they think that's a sustainable policy, and the protests are just gonna keep getting bigger
Herman Cain, the former Republican presidential candidate, businessman and close ally of President Donald Trump, will be mourned at a private funeral in Atlanta on Friday.
Once covid-19 got to THIS country, Trump had a responsibility to deal with it. But he insisted covid-19 was a hoax, and the delay cost lives. Then Jared suggested Trump ignore the virus because it was only killing Democrats. Again, these are facts.
you are free to move to another platform and speak freely there. I hear 4chan is awesome.
Trump had a responsibility to protect this country from things like this pandemic. He has utterly failed in that task. Unemployment is still a major problem, covid-19 is still killing people, and the GOP have left the building. Y'all are fucked.
When Trump let's 300k people die from something he could have stopped....well, there probably won't even be a GOP anymore after 2030.

We all have watched Trump's physical and mental deterioration. Its weird that the GOP think he's strong when it's very clear that he is not.
By law, Trump's term of office expires at noon on January 20th. If we don't have an election, then also by law the speaker of the house of representatives assumes the title of president.  But Trump doesn't give a damn about the Constitution, so there's that.
What? Do you not understand that a Trump appoints the post master general that‚Äôs in charge of the post office? I‚Äôll assume you just forgot, and not that you‚Äôre that dumb

Why does  keep putting Trump propaganda on their network? #cnn is trash
We know who incites violence.  #Trump is the best at it, and only does it to make himself look good to his base.  U have to ask yourself if this is the man U want your children to look up to, really?  Do you tell them it is okay to lie all the time? Attacks peaceful protesters.
Well trump requests 377 million to renovate the Whitehouse out of it soooo.....

Trump can't even walk down a ramp without help. We all saw it with our own two eyeballs.  It is what it is.
Trump cannot, by law, delay the Nov elections. Attempting to do so would ultimately lead to Pelosi becoming president by default.

Trump will be angry.
If anything, Trump is the one most likely to catch covid-19. Not to mention Donny's health ain't the best, mentally or physically. Dude is dragging his right foot and can't walk down a ramp without help.
Thing is, I dunno what Trump has left in his bag of tricks. He's hit Biden with everything - health, sexual assault, communism, religion, racism...all of the lies failed. He's running out of time.
Gods know I'm no campaign manager expert, but it seems to me that every attack Trump has launched at Biden has failed. Unemployment is a mess. A lot of people are about to get evicted. Covid-19 doesn't take days off.  Trump needs a new plan, fast.
no. but Donald Trump? yes. bank fraud. insurance fraud. money laundering. fake university. fake nonprofits. fake president.   that is all.
Trump is creating an entirely avoidable massive homelessness crisis. This won't end well for anyone.
Trump can't admit unemployment is a problem. His pathology would see that as admitting weakness. Which is also why Trump and the GOP refuse to extend unemployment benefits to people affected by covid-19. They'd have to admit they're wrong.
Not in this country they ain't. But Trump can't admit he's fucked up the economy with his covid-19 response, so he's just gonna double down and keep pretending that nothing has changed.
well now Jebus, yesterday Trump indicated that Biden wants to hurt you...and the bible.

hey dinesh, how do you pronounce trump
Retread debunked conspiracy theories aren't gonna win the white house, but maybe Trump isn't trying to win an election. Maybe he's trying to just create as much chaos as possible.
If Trump can destroy tic tok on a whim, then what's stopping him from shutting down CNN? Or YouTube? Anyone on any platform who angers Trump risks financial ruin. Does that seem right?

Yes.  Some Christians do not consider catholics Christian. This was trump demonstrating anti catholic sentiment.

This is NOT only the stupidest thing I‚Äôve read all day, it‚Äôs the stupidest thing I‚Äôve read all year. (Excluding Trump‚Äôs tweets, of course.)
For as much as progressives were pilloried for suggesting many Americans voted against their own economic self-interest in 2016 because of "God, guns and gays," Trump is showing he understands that dynamic, and is relying on it again.

Never = Never Trump = Republican Math is not that hard.
Never Trump means you're anti-American.
Lots of shuttered small businesses on Main Street, but Wall Street seems to be doing just fine. If Trump is fighting for Main Street, he seems to be losing badly. Maybe he should throw in the towel?
The son of an US President, brother to an US President, who was also a State Governor? That's a crazy strong contender.  Ted Cruz is awesome. He was actually my #2 choice in the primary and Trump was #3. I'm glad the primaries didn't go the way I wanted them to.  #Rand2024
A reporter needs to ask Biden his favorite Bible verse to see if he knows any. He might be able to recite one since he is a practicing Catholic. Then put that up against Trump and his stumbling over Bible verses.

I was referring to winning in November.  When it comes to Trump's SCOTUS record it's nearly flawless. He's not had a single loss, he's faced set backs but never a loss, never a ruling of Unconstitutional.
Trump is winning.
Wrong ruling. With another set of SCOTUS appointments by Trump, we're going to fix that.
Yep. It has an A rating. Great organization. Trump the FRAUDSTER who is BANNED from running any charity &amp; paid a HUGE fine should have followed their example.
The more I see #Trump and his allies, such as Giuliani, I feel they are desperate, and are saying anything that might convince someone to vote for him.  But what they are saying is so unbelievable, U almost have to laugh.
4/4 For centuries the country has had an office devoted to making sure people do not claim someone else‚Äôs family name. And after it determined Trump was indeed displaying a stolen coat of arms, he was barred from using it.
2/4 It was, no surprise, a fake. Trump had cribbed the coat of arms from Joseph Edward Davies...who had legitimately been granted the crest in the 1930s. He had made only one minor change, erasing the Davies family motto of ‚Äúintegritas‚Äù (integrity) and replacing it with ‚ÄúTrump.‚Äù
Then I would have to be concerned with the Cognitive value of Dr. Marc Siegel.  First he is a Dr. on Fox, first warning.  Next that #Trump is mentally ok.  Need I say more?
1/3 This was a very well-written story. This passage is great: Early promotional materials for Aberdeenshire carried what purported to be the Trump clan‚Äôs baronial crest‚Äîthree lions under an armored fist brandishing a spear and surrounded by a flourish of red and white feathers.

GOOD AFTERNOON. The last time I updated my electoral maps was June 30th. A lot has happened since then. For one, the virus has gotten worse. And trump has managed to bungle it further, somehow. That said, here are my projections for the election.   PREVIOUS PROJECTION:

Like my parents, Trump loses his train of thought mid-sentence. He jumps from idea to idea w/o expressing a completely thought. The media, just showing clips is translating for him. But when one watches the whole performance it‚Äôs very clear. This one my dad before he died. /2
Both my parents have/had dementia. My husband‚Äòs parents do not. Like my parents, Trump repeats the same phrase in the same sentence or conversation multiple times. Like when he said ‚Äúif you get them in order you get extra points.‚Äù /1
Please, for the love of all that is right and humane, vote for Joe Biden. If you understand politics at all, you must know, if you don‚Äôt, that only helps Trump and whomever you pick has no chance of winning.  Stop your hand wringing and step up!

Journalists why won‚Äôt you guys ask trump real questions? Like about him and child sex trafficking.   Ask him why does he keep trying to stop people from voting. Why did he not do anything to fight covid? Why does he need to divide the country? REAL QUESTIONS!
This is how fucked up Trump supporters are. Death threats to Fauci‚Äôs family.
I‚Äôd ask how he was even eligible to try running again, but I already know the answer - tRump.
Defeat trump!!!!
Too bad the liberals always seem to win the narrative. I Wish Trump was able to say things in a way that convinced more people instead of being painted as so weak.
Nobody:  My Mom: ‚ÄúI literally wanna fight Donald Trump. Like, I wanna give him a fair one.‚Äù
Human trafficking is itself a DRAMATICALLY under addressed issue. High school me didn‚Äôt even know it was still a thing until Far Cry 3. People need to be more aware of it.... but I still don‚Äôt have much faith in Trump supporters changing their ways.
I know they‚Äôre only doing this because they don‚Äôt have anything else, but why? As far as anyone under the age of 60 is concerned they‚Äôre the same age. And questioning Biden‚Äôs mental acuity only makes me compare it to Trump‚Äôs. Trump loses every time.

Still confused as to why anyone other than himself wants him on the ballot. Nobody would flip from Biden to him, &amp; he‚Äôs so close to tRump politically, he could take some votes away from him. Unless they‚Äôre trying to set up a scapegoat for a return in 2024 with one of the sons.
Coincidence or not!Trump just happens to be interested in  helping victims of child trafficking?
You have to remove your head from your anus. The lack of oxygen is why you believe in a sky wizard that man created, &amp; can't hear the Trump &amp; republican deceit. Trump only got 48.9% of the vote. He won the electoral vote. That proves my point. Same thing with Gore/Bush election.
Awww, that's cute.. Pointing fingers, making things up, trying to belittle others to feel better and superior to them. It must be a lonely, tiring, depressive, and ignorant life. I feel bad for you. Maybe pray to your sky wizard to help you ignore Trump's racism and hatred.
This campaign is the mobilization on the ground in this pivotal area. When you support  you‚Äôre making sure Donald Trump loses Pennsylvania!
What a coincidence, Trump also loves the interior...of the Miss America locker room, Epstein's pedophile island, a Russian prostitute's hotel room. Can't wait until he experiences the interior of a prison cell.
Really? What plan is that? Because whenever Trump talks about Covid he just blames China and says we made a lot of ventilators.
Trump does realize he has to die at some point right?
Nope. I hate knowing I have some friends that don‚Äôt see through him. They would vote for a bag of dog shit of it were a Republican. But the TRUMP CULT is different. I hope to god he loses. The trump cult won‚Äôt know what to do. Maybe never vote again... I hope

This statement by President Trump should be extremely disturbing to Republicans. The idea of the federal government profiting for ‚Äúallowing‚Äù 2 businesses to make a deal in the free market is completely Anti-Republican.
Just remember, life will be okay if Trump doesn‚Äôt win. Local politics has a much greater affect on our daily lives.
I know  says he uses the best words, I just wish I knew what they were and he would use them appropriately. I need a Trump to English dictionary...or him to correctly pronounce words. #education #TrumpIsNotWell #SoundItOut

Trump hired him. That means the two guys involved in getting ALL of Epstein‚Äôs charges dismissed were friends with Trump.
Whoever has this evidence that you have seen should RELEASE THE EVIDENCE!!!! All I know is that the girls Were recruited from Mar A Lago and the only guys involved in criminal proceedings against Epstein were Trump‚Äôs friends and Epstein got off.

That's a really good question. Any other president would have to be in solitary confinement due to his level of classified information. But tRump never listened or read any so I guess he could be in gen-pop.
Trump Can Lean on the Electoral College to Win in 2020
I'm sure that man has absolutely no connection to Trump, huh?
Why are they so concerned about massive mail in voting if they can't know what the outcome would be? Trump admitted to accepting/being willing to accept help from foreign entities, why does he automatically assume mail in voting wouldn't help him? Bc it's actually accurate.
The Trump Administration LOVES making the press wait...63 minutes late and counting.
Trump, on behalf of the Government,  wants to take a percentage from the sale of an app, a large percentage, claiming his announcement of a potential ban increased it's selling price. He's so bad at "The Art of the Deal" he's trying to use his power to take credit for others. Lol
As unimportant as each American corona virus death is to Trump, that's how precious each American corona virus death is to Putin.
Disenchanted Seniors for Biden
I see now that Trump wants it gone you have flipped your stance on the app. Just in March you were all over the "Chinese data" train.
Bc Dr. Birx shows a moment of clarity and decided to honor the oath she took and care about her reputation Trump called her pathetic?  How much more proof do Republicans need that he does not value or possess the Patriotism they claim to love and value so much?
So Trump says Absentee voting is ok but Mail in voting isn‚Äôt. What is the difference?  Both ballots are mailed. Trump double talk!
Dr. Birx ruined her reputation and destroyed her credibility by sucking up to Trump‚Äôs nonsense for months. Now he‚Äôs ripping her. So, in a nutshell, she sold her soul to the devil and is now paying the price on all fronts.

Going FAST! Stop by 122 Hollidaysburg Plaza in Duncansville, PA to grab some before they're gone! Also sold: Trump hats, flags, doormats, buttons, pens, knives, stickers, clocks, salt&amp;pepper shakers and beanies.
Trump signs are in! 200 already reserved. Come out to the Blair County Republican Committee office to pick some up! #KeepAmericaGreat
I really think its all being delayed to drive the tRump campaign people crazy. Right now they don't know who to attack. As soon as he announces they will start their attack adds.
So if trends remain same, Trump gains 6% undecided in GA and gets 51% again
That‚Äôs what works for me. I‚Äôll vote for a cat turd over Trump.
It had nothing to do with Hillary being a woman. It‚Äôs because the woman was Hillary. If the Democrats hadn‚Äôt run one of the most disliked people in their party, Trump would have lost.
I‚Äôll support a brick he puts a pants suit on and draws a face on if it gets rid of Trump.
Prison reform was bipartisan but Trump pushes republicans &amp; Dems jumped on board. Neither did anything prior to this administration.
Obama did nothing for black employment,even those who still support him do not argue that point when black employment is discussed,just ignore. There are many blacks who are now conservatives due to job increase over last 3 years.
Partial birth involves dismemberment, that is  beings,babies feel pain,proven by science, at 12 weeks or sooner. Abortionn is killing living beings.I agree they go to Jesus,does not make murder acceptable
Trump has done more good for black employment than any president in our history. Also prison reform,which Has been a major issue since Biden pushed for stricter enforcement against blacks.
Do real evangelicals support Biden &amp; others who support abortion on demand through the 9th month of pregnancy? How about not creating jobs to help minorities, just keep them enslaved on welfare &amp; generationally indebted to Democratic Party?
how can you run a country when you can't even run your mind right? you're sick got dementia or w/e it is you shouldn't be even thinking about running a country much less a yourself ... you don't know who you are half the time ... you're a joke just a sad puppet of the ANTI-Trump
If he picked a toaster for his VP pick I‚Äôm gonna be all in. Trump needs to go!
DJT has to power to deploy government agents to "trump' up his law and order agenda to give the appearance that we are in a vile confrontation with anarchists.  It is illusion played via of the media and propoganda.
Probably cause he wasn‚Äôt invited. Trump doesn‚Äôt like being left out.
You‚Äôre right. To be that evil takes some kind of brain power. Trump is just dangerously stupid and hateful.
Funny, Dems created these issues yet try to blame Trump. Lies are easily seen. Trump 2020
President Donald Trump says he will take action as soon as Saturday to ban Chinese-owned video app TikTok from the United States.
Trump needs worry about coronavirus and keeping the country in one piece, not banning TikTok. #FukTrump he's a Fukin fool I hope our younger generation vote him out on election day.
BREAKING: U.S. President Trump announces plan to ban TikTok app.
And Trump is why we will elect Biden.
So then by that logic, Trump has far too much time on his hands and isn‚Äôt doing his job.
Given how much Trump lies, I would definitely need to verify it.
No one, tRump has already let her know he has her back.
That is absolutely the intent of Trump and the Right lying about mail in voting. They‚Äôve been proven wrong time and again. They fear people having easier access to the ability to vote. Republicans have suppressed votes for decades in many places. It‚Äôs what they do.
They‚Äôre ensuring people are aware of the option. Given how much Trump and the right are trying to block it, it is necessary to counter their attempts to suppress votes.
Mr Scalise is earning big "Trump points" this morning
I voted for Obama just once in 2008  after 8 blah years under George W Bush.  I didn't vote in 2012 or 2016 but can't wait to vote Nov 3rd 2020  "Go Trump" the best president in my lifetime
If it wasn‚Äôt clear that Trump is afraid before, it is now!
At "Cops For Trump",  gives his thoughts on differences between  and  on policing and systematic racism. The "he" that is referred to at the top of the clip is VP Biden.
On reviving the economy,  explains why the campaign believes President Trump is "the man for the job."
Spoke to  at "Cops For Trump" today. Asked about mail in voting. He cites Former Pres. Carter and Former Sec. of State Baker's 2005 Commission on Federal Election Reform. Carter has since supported the expansion of mail-in voting according to The Carter Center.
At "Cops For Trump" in Greensburg, PA,  brought up #GeorgeFloyd while talking about the administration's commitment to "law and order." Says "justice will be served" and condemned riots and taking down statues.
You do realize al of that we can say about Trump tenfold, right?
are complaining about #SocialDistancing at John Lewis‚Äô funeral!! Of course not!!It‚Äôs ok for the Left to do whatever they want. Let people get sick so they can‚Äôt work! Just a strategy to hold the country back and try to win an election!!  #Trump #kag
I disagree. Those still supporting Trump at this point in time have no more excuses. They‚Äôre as bad as he is.
Answer this question honestly and do not go beyond what is being asked: Who is the better HUMAN BEING, Trump or Biden?
Cain had been hospitalized at the beginning of July for COVID-19. As a co-chair of Black Voices for Trump, Cain was one of the surrogates at President Donald Trump‚Äôs June 20 rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
This guy will never leave the White House...expect martial law...
When the person in the office acts in ways undeserving of respect he shouldn‚Äôt get it just cause of the title. Trump is human garbage and always has been. Also, being the daughter or spouse of a service member means nothing really.
Yes, I‚Äôve done more than Trump.Where the f is  with all that anti Trump cash?
Trump, TikTok and a dangerous precedent for democracy
Unfortunately for most of us, this family embraces Trump. It was a like watching him at a cocktail party, while thousands are sick and dying.
Bet you're gonna vote for Trump. üò¨
Dear diary  Today the Big Bad Orange Man called us fake news.  Also today I complained about Trump because it‚Äôs a day that ends in Y.
Just like trump they'll lie, deflect and blame anyone and everyone as long as they can KEEP POWER so they can continue to do what they always have, to syphon off ALL of the wealth they can steal.
Educating liberals is another anti Trump plant üôÑ

As for Biden, I don‚Äôt view him as any better than Trump. In fact, I probably consider him more dangerous, as he makes people comfortable with said system. I don‚Äôt mean that he‚Äôll offer us any kind of meaningful change. He‚Äôll just be more tactful and do it with a reassuring smile.
Unfortunately, you were being hit from more directions than you could count long before Trump became President. Trump is merely a symptom of our oppressive system.
You‚Äôre a fool. They not the only state who have been doing it for years. But FOR YEARS Florida has been screwing up elections. Helping crooks like trump.
Also, I have black friends too and they sure as shit don‚Äôt want Trump re-elected.
Here are fourteen things people think may be more popular than Donald Trump
I personally view electoral politics as one tool among many. For me, Bernie was my compromise candidate.   As far as Biden goes, I don‚Äôt view him as any better than Trump. In fact, I probably consider him more dangerous, as he makes people comfortable with our corrupt system.
Funny coming from Trump with his 7 Times bankruptcies.

TRUMP'S BEGINNING OF THE 2ND AMERICAN HOLOCAUST!
Really worried when trump won the first time DOES NOT guarantee support for we either #theCorpseofJoeBiden or the person he's standing in for! You do realize that assessing the black vote as even necessarily #Democrat anymore in the age of trump v. Biden is problematic, no?
Absolutely
Trump is so desperate to win. He doesn‚Äôt even realize that many republicans are going to vote by mail too.  He has üí© for brains.
These times we‚Äôre living in now is a warning to America-change course and return to decency.  We were great before Trump, many didn‚Äôt realize just how much, til we‚Äôve lost so much.  Obama Victory Speech 2008  via

I remind myself that a Dem Admin will likely not persist in denying trans rights; largescale immigration roundups &amp; kids in cages; uhhhh; um; will probably restore some EPA regs &amp; believe in climate change.  There are still people who will suffer more under trump than under Biden
Oh Hogan, I‚Äôm sure since you‚Äôre working for trump, you‚Äôre compromised or not that bright, but there‚Äôs this law, see, it‚Äôs called the ACA, it already has that provision in it.
I‚Äôm honestly really scared of the 2020 election. What if Trump wins re-election? I really don‚Äôt think I can live through 4 more years of his presidency.
Things were a whole lot better back then. It wasn‚Äôt like how our country is today. I sometimes wish I ended my life back in 2016 when Trump won the election so I wouldn‚Äôt have to live through all the hate in this world.
Okay but why was  scolding the TSA for using TikTok for security reasons weeks before Trump? If it were a Russian app the vibe would be different. I‚Äôm for  but China is horrible. You can‚Äôt Tiktok about Tank Man. Try it. Youll be suspended.
And Trump hasn't done anything that makes me overlook what the other side is standing up for. And to me resloving humanitarian Crisis is the top most priority. Trump sucked at that. If anything he fanned those problems even more to give them new heights.
The ONLY person Biden could pick for VP that would make me not want to vote for him is Donald Trump. And yet I‚Äôd still vote #Biden2020
You don't think those who killed others especially on the basis of color and race should be put behind bars? And those cases of homicides went up during Trump's presidency. If he had a different plan to tackle that it clearly didn't work either.
Good place for Trump to hold a rally. Bring the whole family!
Yea because that's a humanitarian issue that needs to be addressed and I hope you do realize that. I hope you also do realize that Trump hasn't done jackk shit in capturing those who killed all those black people. As I said, you're fighting for the wrong cause. Sorry man.
Glad the media is starting to call out this Trump nonsense!
Trump Derangement Syndrome much, Andy?
Fruits of the decisions made by obama to give small businesses money to spike up the economy have been reaped by trump right now. And I'm not sure if racism was ever an issue with Obama in power as far as he himself was concerned.
Trump is not worthy of the Black vote. If you, can go thru his numerous lies and comments...racist as he is
I'm not. If nobody in power should be a racist, how will having trump in power prove that to be true? You're fighting for the wrong cause. That's all.
Yeah, I‚Äôve always known they‚Äôve been artificially propping it up, but didn‚Äôt know they were doing this huge buy! Trump will let it crash after the election. It won‚Äôt matter anymore then. He will blame it on Biden winning. Biden is going to have an awful lot of work to do! üò≥
That‚Äôs weird since it‚Äôs already in effect from the Obama/Biden yrs. And hasn‚Äôt Trump been in court asking for this very thing to be struck down (the thing that Obama/Biden implemented 10 yrs ago)? How can he implement something that‚Äôs already in place? Pretty clever to try tho!
Trump will do anything to get his agenda done, including murdering people to start violence

This is definitely a nationwide issue in my opinion. Because at times people really don't show on the outside who they genuinely are on the inside. Now, Trump who is a racist himself just accelerated that process of bringing the real side of the people out.
Support President Trump - landslide 2020! #TeamTrump
That‚Äôs a Trump ad.
This is the Democrat version of Ben Garrison's weirdly 'mirin' Trump cartoons.  If I have to see this, so must you all.
how can you blame biden for what has happened while trump is president?
And all of those issues will exist under Biden, just as they existed prior to Trump. Biden will just do it with a kind smile and make people feel comfortable with it. I think the bottom line is, I‚Äôm not going to legitimize either one of them by giving them my vote. Period.
I don‚Äôt the tRump can do it with executive orders. Purse strings?
I was done with the GOP. Trump comes along, and moved away from the faux Christian right, which became increasingly bothersome to me. I knew he would win back in June 2015 when he had Katy Tur spitting nails. It was beautiful, and I knew that he would win. Finally, someone who...
It's right in front of our faces. The Senate has proven it's on board with Trump's corruption. And they've packed the courts.  Who needs an election?
They all lied for trump.
If the news media wasn't so fake then our country would be so much better off.  Watch "08/07/20: President Trump Holds a News Conference"
TRUMP AND HIS SS THUGS!
Just like trump to take credit for something Obama already did! His followers may buy this bull, but we are not!
Russia wants trump to win, because it‚Äôs a win for them! China wants Biden to win to get back at trump. This is the U.S. they don‚Äôt get a say! Trump invited this interference into our elections and we can‚Äôt let it happen
This is the kind of crap that gets reporters killed. tRump loves it.

No need to worry. Trump will keep making more isms for TLP.

Dying for the right cause is the most human thing we could ever do. If they want to die for Trump, you can't stop them.
TRUMP IS REALLY SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO BORING!
Idiot...we already have that with the ACA thanks to President Obama. Trump is trying to take your Healthcare away during a pandemic...P A N D E M I C!
I don't know of anyone who has been wearing a mask for political reasons. And if they do exist, we shouldn't be drawing attention to them. Mask wearing is seen as political now and that's a terrible thing from a public health perspective, and Trump steered us here.
Look, flat out. If any of you are dumb enough to vote for this absolute piece of shit then you deserve to be stuck with Trump for 4 more years.  And just to be perfectly blunt. I hope you and your loved ones get covid and die.
Trump announces.....the affordable care act? Aka Obamacare? Which has been the law since 2010?
Trump loves Veterans, except for the 100,000+ that work at the Post Office!
Simple: Biden wins, bows to China, and Russia gets the shaft.  Trump win is helps save Russia.   Nothing nefarious, just reality.

Trump just announced Obamacare 2: Electric Boogaloo
Is he saying that Trump said something that isn‚Äôt true? Sounds pretty accurate to me.
And the Trump administration is arguing a case before the Supreme Court right now...right now to strike down the ACA. Including protections for pre existing conditions. Sounded good. Meant nothing
The affordable care act eliminated pre-existing conditions under all insurance providers. The only grandfathered policies are those purchased prior to 2010. There‚Äôs no such thing as an Obama plan. Trump‚Äôs EO is BS.
Ok ok... so damn trump don't have nobody checkin for him? Shit his people let him sign an executive order for something that already exists. Like you really have not one person pulling your coat like "aye yo, donnie, we already got that". No one??? üòÇüòÇüòÇ
Chance of Trump writing all of his?
Trump says he plans on making insurers cover pre-existing conditions ‚Äî a protection which already exists under Obamacare
Trump needs to be tried for treason once this election is over!

bill clinton and trump is on epsteins flight logs. LOL
Yes, they do but Trump has to increase his base in order to win so that's what this is all about.
It's just another tactic to blame Trump if anything goes wrong.
it wasnt lost so there is your lie. it was dropped for an NDA and paid hushmoney. why would one women be safe from a mobster. He NDA'd mary trump and she still exposed his dumbass. lol ur delusional.
ya you're right. hopefully the swing voters have realized trump is a pathological liar, and so his promises mean nothing.
Just like the law is now under Obamacare. Trump is suing to remove it but I understand confusion is an issue for people in his condition
If there was one iota of truth to that Trump would do more then talk...
When the leader has all the horrible qualities I mentioned above, those qualities take a frot seat to anything else people support him for even though they may be voting for him for entirely something different. Priorities my friend. Dehumanizing has been started by Trump himself

anyway, about ACA, the point is about public opinion. if the ACA is not working, sabotage or not, and trump does something that helps voters directly, like when he proposed a stimulus before D's did, that's what they'll vote on.
Apparently the newest campaign strategy out of the Trump camp is to announce the Executive Order signings of laws previous Presidents already signed into law.   Hmmm... Trump taking credit for other people's work, shocking!

Donald Trump coupe but the inside Obama.
When the CDC was saying "please wear masks outside" Trump said he wasn't going to do it. The people who decided it was a good idea to wear masks certainly predicted it'd be worse without masks...
Considering that your husband's "job" is being a propagandist for a dictator wannabe like Trump, maybe he should quit his job.
Personally I'm less interested in assigning "fault" but think it's important to recognizing places where we could have done better. If Trump isn't going to admit his mistakes &amp; missed opportunities he'll probably just keep making them.
Trump would probably lose...  especially if one of the words was 'Yosemite.'
Trump was right, againüëç
This seems, uh, not great.
I'd love to chat someday about your thoughts and ideas.   To be clear (this isn't defending Trump) some insurances still conduct medical underwriting and/or have Pre X clauses and rating. The biggest being Medicare Supplements, Short Term individual and level funded group.

And the Catholic Church is supporting Trump because he is protecting these monsters from prosecution üò°üò°üò°üò°
Lol Republicans aren‚Äôt committed to any of the sh*t Trump is saying. They are trying to pass a bunch more business tax cuts.
PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS COVERED JUST UNTIL NOVEMBER 3RD, 2020 OF COURSE.  We're not stupid. Trump's poll numbers suck so he will say ANYTHING.
COVID Killer, racism, climate whatever, white supremacy, sexist,  corrupt, and of course, Russia...this is the tired, worn out messaging the democrats use to attack Trump.  Glad we‚Äôre woke...
But then Trump wins without the dirt being spilled.  Come forward to tell what they know about DeJoy's plans and make Trump squirm.

Trump is trying to destroy the social security and Medicare with his no payroll taxes. He‚Äôs also trying to destroy the US postal service by getting rid of people and no overtime so the mail won‚Äôt be able to keep up with the mail in election. He‚Äôs also got a moron running 4 th WH.

What did Trump do about it in all of the month of February, besides tell people not to worry about it and that concern for it was a democratic hoax?  We could have taken the time figure out how to not have PPE shortages, and get people ready for sacrifice for the good of country.
I think Trump just invented Obamacare! #ExecutiveOrder
He should have kept himself from temptation with his pool boy and extramarital partners so he might not be in such a spot. He, like Trump, is drunk on power and uses it sexually. see pic of bedroom on link  and the woman with whom is similarly unbuckled.

2/2 But that means the US had the vaccine all the time but would not release it due to plausible deniability of being the causation of its release from its embassy in Wuhan. All the deaths for a cover up to protect the Trump Virus.
So Trump spoke the truth and you have issue with that??
Trump is doing this just to help himself get re elected. If he wins he'll repeal it. I can't believe so many people are so stupid as to trust
If I were one of Trump's political advisors, I would literally be BEGGING him to go "sit in a basement" at this point.
Donald Trump to Suspend Payroll Tax Until End of 2020
Don‚Äôt hold Biden accountable for blatantly factual past and present actions. MSNBC must mimic how Fox News covers Trump and praise him 24/7 or they are disgusting. Strange, Sam is publicly left (the real left) though he has made clear he will vote for Biden. What a douche.
What's up with you, Chris? Biden did clarified his statements,  now ask Trump about his.
Putin makes Trump his bitch and Trump makes the GOP and his White House staff his. See how this works ?
He doesn't want to elaborate on his plans because they are diabolical. He'll most likely continue to dismantle our governmental system and place Trump loyalists in all important positions in what's left of the government. His fans love that cause they hate our government.
All the experience, expertise, skill, independence right out the window! It's clear Trump sent him to fuck up the USPS and the election.
you see what you want to see. its just projection of you being a freak. where there is actual lawsuits of epsten and trump raping a child

Trump has talked to PUTIN 8 TIMES SINCE JANUARY, and has NEVER ASKED HIM ABOUT THE BOUNTY ON AMERICAN SOLDIERS, what could be more important than that, HIS RE-ELECTION, and the CHEATING RUSSIA WILL DO TO GUARANTEE IT!! Not the lives of AMERICANS DEFENDING OUR COUNTRY!!
That house is on there farm sits on the main road and they give Trump hats and shirts away for free great people
It was a classic moment of Trump at his best....
I see "Huge News" trending and just roll my eyes because there is no such thing anymore. Nothing surprises anyone like it should... just like bounties on the heads of our own troops by Russia. Trump's daily New's cycle involves so much corruption it's impossible to keep track.
Americans, Important information the KAYNE WEST FOR PRESIDENT IS REALLY BEING FINANCED BY TRUMP AND THE REPUBLICAN PARTY, same LAWYER WORKS FOR BOTH CAMPAIGNS, this is their PLAN TO TAKE THE BLACK VOTE AWAY FROM BIDEN!! TRUMP WILL USE ANYONE TO WIN!
There are days when the awfulness of Trump and the GOP are just too terrible to cope with. Everything's a game, a maneuver, a strategy. Never simply doing the right thing.
People are starving, kids are starving, and families are being evicted and trump is at his country club golfing. Just ask yourself one question- what if he lied when he told you the news was fake? Would that make a difference to you? #deathcult
Just remember, even Herbert Hoover got 39.7% of the popular vote in his bid for reelection. It just proves everyone has a base that will never abandon them no matter what happens - even Donald #Trump.

So, be strong enough to school him. He has moved far to the left based on his history, your demands, the idiot in the White House, and the realization that doing the same thing over and over and expecting a different result, is insane! Something Trump is incapable of learning

What did he do in February?  I think Trump seems like he wants to consistently make this seem like an issue of China versus the US when the reality is it's a virus, it's here, and China is long irrelevant to the public health emergency we're in. Why are there still PPE shortages?

Trump Announces Executive Order Plan To Extend COVID-19 Economic Relief
This is already a law under the ACA. Trump isn‚Äôt doing anything because those protections already exist. FOH.
I‚Äôm at the point where being a Trump Supporter is a deal breaker for me...
Wow. I can see why Boris is a highly paid "strategic advisor."  What's next? Trump signing an EO that Hawaii and Alaska will be included as states in the union?
The double dealing was rampant.  I grew up in  rural America. Farmers are smarter than City Slickers. (Aesop's Country and City Mouse) The NRA used to be more about educating gun owners.  Sad. When the Russian escort gave the $30 mil for tRump that was a clue.
After seeing the MANY flags &amp; signs today for Trump I don‚Äôt think he is going anywhere. It was so jarring that now I‚Äôm very worried about November.

Sure.   Nobody wants Trump. Biden is weak and China/Russia/Iran know it.  So does anyone with half a brain.

Im sure she means that we should all get the same daily fast tests that Trump and those around him get, along with the instant quarantines for positive results!
Politics aside, I do find it interesting that China and Iran would want Biden over Trump and Russia would want Trump.  You‚Äôd think those three countries would want the same person.

More like God is going to destroy Trump!!!
Also what has trump done to damage the black community. Specific things please
So as usual what Trump says is non-sense. The NRA can‚Äôt move to Texas and live happily ever after.
pay attention...........
via   Putin only wants ‚Å¶ bc he‚Äôs a fool. They laugh at how easily he can be manipulated. That‚Äôs pathetic.
Man, that may be tougher than trying to figure out how Trump‚Äôs mind works.
That is like telling her to ask trump which plastic surgeon she should use
You will never get a reply to giving one instance to Trump hurting black America‚Äôs.  They don‚Äôt have anything but talking points and emotions.
Trump had no problem bailing out corporations and his donors, or propping up the markets, but he has no time for the states, cities, or the poorer people hurt due to his incompetence.
Trump‚Äôs never been anything more than a carnival barker.
There were millions of mask left from the Obama administration.   Trump gave them to China, he didn‚Äôt replace them, because he didn‚Äôt have the foresight to expect the virus to come here.
trump called for the execution of 5 innocent black kids and still believes they‚Äôre guilty, wouldn‚Äôt rent to poc in ny, called black nfl players sons of bitches, African countries shitholes and Nazi ‚Äúvery fine people‚Äù you were fucking SILENT, so stfu fool!üñïüèøüñïüèø
Thr Left doesn‚Äôt care about God or the Military or the constitution until there‚Äôs something in it for them? Trump says Biden wants to hurt (the concept of) God and they go bonkers but I remember in 2012 when the dems tried to unsert GOD into the platform and they booed #biden
This isn‚Äôt a donald trump reference but what a fucked up 4 years it‚Äôs been, huh guys?
Isn't it likely that the Manhattan DA will to the same indicting Trump and/or The Trump Organization?
I swear to God the next #Trump ad that comes on the air here in #Pennsylvania is going to be #Biden calling to euthanize all puppies and kittens.  The Trump campaign is getting that desperate. I probably just planted the idea in their heads...
these are the same clowns that claim trump NEVER SAYS ANYTHING RACIST, but want us to believe that Biden is a racist!ü§£ü§£ü§£ you can‚Äôt make this shit up
Con men, which he certainly is, can never fess up.  He already failed miserably trying to be a conservative intellectual, so this is all he has now. Con the B.T Barnum Trump voters into buying his (shitty) product.

Unexpected Trump endorsement. üòÇ
I really dislike the NRA &amp; I totally agree. Throw out everyone in the office and start over. I understand when she dissolved Trump‚Äôs charity for stealing from kids with cancer.  It never really operated as a charity but the NRA has been around forever. Give them time to clean up.

Their new slogan is It is what it is. They don‚Äôt care how many people get sick or die. You Republicans that back trump and have a relative die or is on a ventilator , and you still back , your as sick as him. He doesn‚Äôt care about you or your family.
vladimir putin has been waging a disinformatskaya (russian for disinformation) campaign through cronies at msnbc to convince america he's much more powerful than he actually is, all the liberals buying that he elected trump are "useful idiots", a soviet term of art for ...(1/340)

TRUMP, Ur the Man!! Keep up the good work, Trump dont take no Crap! (If you were to Deputize me, I'd make ya Damn Proud) ;)
Just in case it's not clear, that racist is Biden. Trump is also a racist and there is a zero percent chance that I would ever vote for him.
love this story. God bless America and Trump
Cruz won Texas in 2018 by only 2.6 in an election with presidential-year turnout, so no, this does not look right. (Trump is more unpopular in Texas than Cruz.)
Also, no one bother coming at me with "do you just want Trump to win?". I haven't spoken to my parents in 3 years over the last election and that is not going to change no matter the result of this election. But damn I would love to not have to vote for a racist.
1. That‚Äôs a deflection to my comment about Trump.  2. Nearly anyone else would be better than Trump, especially Biden.  3. I disagree with the premise of your statement, he is not a closet racist.  But it‚Äôs a fact that Trump is an open racist, which you don‚Äôt seem to mind.
This is another dirty play by trump . It‚Äôs not going to work to many people want you gone. Big blue wave üåä
Woe, was he ever? I'm sure they know tho bud. I'm sure they know. Hey Trump, ...let's be friends man. Deputize me :)
The Republican Party is in bed with a Russia and has been the last 3+ years. Trump introduced them to Putin the jag off who is trumps mentor . This whole administration is totally corrupt and needs prosecuted when voted out in November.Big Blue Wave üåä

How do you hurt God? You pray to Trump.
you only come on Fox when Joe Biden some some shut about blacks. YOU ARE SILENT WHEN TRUMP MAKES EVERY RACIST STATEMENT UNDER THE SUN. You‚Äôre a fraud dude!!#Biden2020
The only thing not normal about the Trump presidency is the psychotic response of the left to everything he says &amp; does.

Trump is playing all the deplorables.  Hes the puppet master.  Trump could care less about the toothless, brainless who support him. It‚Äôs his greatest ruse ever.
Just the fact that Putin &amp; his  Communist Government want  to destroy Joe Biden, should   be enough to convince you   that TRUMP IS A PUTIN PUPPET!! A useful idiot!
have you tired showing him the trump vs scrooge epic rap battles of history
How's Trump's butt taste?
I like that none are certain to vote for trump. Why would you? He‚Äôll be the first person to tell you what a great job he‚Äôs done, but real people know he hasn‚Äôt done sh*t.
How is Trump successful? Because of money? # of wives? Dumb children who still have no life outside his? Be serious.  Trump is an Eastern Elitist.

Again, blame the CDC, I have 1000 rides under my belt as a Cab, tested last week, still negative. Maybe your Democrat Loving Big Pharma groups should STOP fucking with Genetic Engineering, Faucci knew YEARS before Trump ever thought of Running... Tell me How.
lolol I guess people need a reminder because one of my FRIENDS just posted a fatphobic meme making fun of trump‚Äî don‚Äôt fucking do that! All it does is let your fat friends know that you think being fat is bad, wrong, a moral failing, a weakness, something to be laughed at, etc.
All trump supports used to be the school yard bully, but now they have no one to pick on anymore. They all just run and hide when you stand up to them. Mental weaklings.
Yep. Mostly from Europe, because Trump let 1.4 million European travelers enter the country after a Global Health Emergency was issued.  For the record, 44 countries shut down travel from China before Trump did.
So, they have reached the bribery/bargaining stage of their Trump Derangement Syndrome.
So if your not a U.S. citizen they yeah you cant travel to the us unless you were authorized to be able to travel. So yeah there was a ban an trump did it
Still down 14 million since Trump blew the nation's pandemic response. Over 6 million down since the day he took office. Unemployment still higher than the Great Recession peak.  Happy days are here again!
If you want to Blame Deaths on Anyone, Point the fingers at the DEMOCRAT Bill Gates and Faucci, buttbuddies, who like to Stab Children and Inject them with their Genetic Material, TRUMP didnt kill Anyone. Democrats killed how many And what about Seattle? What a Sideshow that was.
It‚Äôs a ridiculous comment, he has no source. And Dems don‚Äôt hate America, we think Trump is a terrible president.  You can dislike a president and love the country simultaneously.  It‚Äôs a difficult concept for some on the right to understand, but that doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs not true.
Lmfao they literally refuse to censor straight up Trump-loving Neo-Nazis and The Orange Menace himself when he makes threats, but you still cry that ‚Äúthey‚Äôre censoring ‚Äòconservatives‚Äô for no reason!‚Äù bullshit?  Social media amplifies your pseudo-conservative Nazi party messaging.
Seeing Trump as ‚Äòunpredictable,‚Äô China would prefer he not win reelection, intelligence official says By Shane Harris
Trump and Barr are most likely going to claim there was Chinese interference in the election.
This is huge because he actually quit when Trump tried to get him to fire Mueller. I guess his first attempt to stop the Russia investigation by firing Comey wasn't enough üòè
I also don't think it's true. China will gladly see Trump tear America apart.
And you ain‚Äôt smart if you vote Trump.
Remember you ain't BLACK if you vote for Trump. That's what Biden says..
My bsf and I were talking about current topics rn. Trump is more focused on banning tiktok, but ignores the fact that there is so much gun violence in the world and how so many kids are afraid to go to school because of school shootings and now a pandemic. #stopgunviolence
Maybe they should graduate preschool then.
I'm an Athiest and I know more bible verses than Trump lol..... Jesus.
I get it. You don‚Äôt like Trump. He‚Äôs pompous and unpolished. He‚Äôs not at all a typical politician. He‚Äôs not presidential. I have voted R every year except 2016 when I voted L. But no way can ANYONE ‚Äúconservative‚Äù vote for Biden. I don‚Äôt buy it.
So your stance is Biden is a racist but Trump is more of a racist?
Spot on.  Just don‚Äôt know how anyone justifies voting for Trump.
We have a lot more to worry about! Not just Trump for 4 more years!
Too much Trump on my feed.  Doing more things to be a horrible human being.  Its giving me a hand ache and an urge to pray that God will help throw him out.
I haven't lived long enough huh? Conservativism is the least complex ideology there is. "Socially conservative and fiscally responsible". Trump is neither.  I can almost guarantee in my 35 years the diversity of governments I've seen quadruples what you have seen.
My 4 year old grandson looks like Einstein compared to Trump.  #TrumpIsALaughingStock
you are so confused as to how a Christian can support Trump ? I‚Äôll explain it to your simple mind. Trump supports Life not murder and CHRIST back in Christmas his whole basic support is for us to go back to the Christian values that we let get taken away. And I‚Äôm not your ‚Äúhomie‚Äù

It doesn‚Äôt take much to see the similarities between #Hitler and the meteoric rise of #Trump from corrupt businessman to wannabe dictator. The only thing unknown is when and how he will RIP. The timeline has more differences than similarities, but that is beside the point. What

Certainly more stable than it is today. Biden isn't going to fawn over India like Trump.
Wow so the orange hitler wants to control everything! Why should a Chinese company sell under threat? This is very low level bullying. I think mr. trump is desperate for attention and very scared about losing in November.
What good is adding 1.8 million jobs in a month when over a million each WEEK lose their jobs? It is a net loss of over 3 million people working. The Unemployment number should be higher not lower. More fake data from Trump's government. We have over 31 million people collecting

Israel most definitely wants Trump to win.  As does North Korea.  The rest of the civilized world clearly wants Trump to lose... because they want America to be normal again.

I know the difference. I do interviews &amp; interrogations.  The bottom line is they all lie. Both sides. Focus more on Trump because ppl far left love to hate. Mole hills to mountains syndrome.

It funny because they are still more intelligible than anything Biden would actually say.

Someone needs to ask him if he will now apologize for propagating the lie that Trump said neo-nazis were fine people...
Then it‚Äôs not tautology. We know what he‚Äôs talking about, the election. People are arguing his goal is to split the vote or to change it in favor of trump. He‚Äôs saying the goal is to win. There‚Äôs context and this serves to clarify.
No, Donald Trump‚Äôs polices put China first, and America last.
No, Clean up on aisle Trump.

You really need to watch the CSPAN videos of Biden. He gets off on the power he has. He loves groping &amp; sniffing kids and knows he can get away with it. F-ing sick. Meanwhile, Trump said there are some women who love rich celebs and will let them do anything. Big difference.

Trump signs executive order to ban TikTok in U.S. within 45 days
You realize that literally every website steals data, right?  Facebook does, Snapchat does, Twitter does. Trump is targetting TikTok because a lot of people use it as a political platform (like myself), which could drive up turnout, which is never good for the GOP.

8.5 on the mental gymnastics there. Nice work! Don't forget to check for the cops and Trump under your bed before you lie down tonight.
I can't even imagine the uproar we'd experience from the media if Trump said this same exact statement. Or any of the other racist statements made by Joe. But since it's Biden... ü¶óü¶óü¶óü¶óü¶ó
Welp, if trump needed a rallying cry here it is.
Biden's very first campaign ad was an absolute lie about something Trump said-- a lie that every media organization admits was a lie but a LIE that Biden still repeats and stands by. So, please, lecture us some more about facts...
This is an actual ploy by the GOP to take young and black votes from Dems. This is ridiculous. Trump isn‚Äôt fit for presidency and neither is Kanye. He needs to get his mental health in check and go home.
There is no other option, Biden‚Äôs history as a senator and VP is dismal . The entire DNC brags about murdering infants born/unborn, they care nothing about elder citizens but illigals give them everything. President Trump proved that he is great for the USA. 3 NOV 20 TRUMP
Trump and GOP are playing you. Trump wants to do executive order to look like a hero, for votes
üòÇ The person who created this was brilliant, but, alas, it was not me. I stumbled across it &amp; just had to save it. My new favorite game is playing "Which Swan Face Are You" to idiot Trump things.
This guy's verbal reactions to Trump's stupidity are just hilarious. I need to see this whole interview now.
If Trump goes to jail does he still have 24hr secret service detail guarding him?
Biden's mental ability? Should we "person, woman, man, camera, TV" this or just rewatch the  interview? Both show Trump's lack of mental ability.  Swan face scale to this post: #6
I am so sorry that you went through what you went through, &amp; bravo for being strong enough to share your story. Any person who can speak the way that  does is absolutely despicable. So I'm 100% in agreement. Fuck her. Fuck Trump.
A country filled with moronic assholes who waste their time sending death threats. The people who listen to Dr Fauci instead of Trump aren't dumb enough to do that. #FauciHero #TrumpIsACompleteFailure

This is not right.  NOT AT ALL.  No one would blame him if he just stepped back.   Not worth putting his family through this.  ESPECIALLY when he's not getting ANY support from trump.
Yeah, they voted for Trump. Don‚Äôt underestimate, they could do it again
Deep in the heart of the White House and his properties, Donald Trump sits in his basement.  Alone. Hiding. Diminished.
PLEASE.  Can someone name ANY reporter that Trump likes, respects, admires?????  ANY??  I'll wait here.
He got Gore wrong but claimed he was right due to Gore winning popular vote.  He got Trump right, but Trump lost popular vote.    So he‚Äôs not 100%.
That might be a dangerous pitfall.  Can only imagine how Trump, et al would turn that into "Biden is scared", "sleepy Joe"....etc.

Oh Joey, we can't wait for you to sit or stand with president Trump at the debates either. Definitely gunna be a great watch
Ummmm, so your prices went up in January and he just signed the bill a few days ago.  Let‚Äôs see what happens on your next fill this month of August or in September.  I don‚Äôt see why you‚Äôre so angry at Trump for your individual body‚Äôs needs? Blame yourself or your family genetics.
Donald Trump has revealed the depths of the country‚Äôs prejudice and forced Americans to reckon with a racist system, writes
The man gets a costume MAGA beanie and we was totally a Democrat. Its weird, how the majority of people are leaning towards Biden, but this guy, oh no, he sees the truth and voting Trump. Lmfao
If you‚Äôre such a free thinker than, genius, please tell me by what ONJECTIVE metric is Trump even a semi decent president. Moreover, by any measure of human decency, how is trump a decent person. Like I said... leave the cult and ‚Äúthink for yourself‚Äù
üòÇüòÇ joke? Please tell me what evidence you have Trump is a Republican? I believe you cultists call people like  a ‚ÄúRINO‚Äù (how cleverüôÑ) meanwhile u venerate a man who is a lifelong D who gave millions to Clinton and Shumer. How‚Äôs that for fact?   Think for yourself
Honestly, Trump could gain so much support by using an EO to set a rolling monthly stimulus payment to Americans in place of a partisan fight every 3months. Biden team would absolutely hate Trump doing the right thing lol.

So are you advocating for alcohol and nicotine to be illegal too?
Audience of One. Seeing those ads drives Trump crazy and he tries to drown out the message and does dumb things. Like sitting down for an interview with someone who doesn't fellate him like  and

I am no longer in college and I can promise you I am definitely not a pedophile.
This is just not true. Have you seen how much Trump adores police? Couldn‚Äôt be me. More military? Hard pass for me.
Yes and I think that‚Äôs a perfectly acceptable position to have. Weed is way less harmful to your body than alcohol.
You don‚Äôt really believe that, do you? Libertarians care about personal liberties / Constitutional rights more than anything.
The Greek-Turkish conflict is probably not high on Trump‚Äôs agenda. Having said this, I reiterate that regardless of who‚Äôs in charge, the result would be the same. Anything Biden might say is just to pay lip service and get some Greek-American votes and money.
Thank you President Trump for everything you are doing.
Probably as good as it smells in the bunker trump cowers in
Trump has a problem listening to advice (assuming he gets good advice).  Joe seems to have the same problem, how many times has he gotten snippy with someone in an interview?  He needs a cheat sheet that says, "don't get snippy"

Ok ..belive what you want.Obamazombie Its a friggin pandemic WHO lied..China lied. But yea Trump created the virus at MarLago
They exist, I assure you.  Frequently opined by many a Trumper - the virus will disappear after Election Day.  (Translation: the global elites manufactured a pandemic to run Trump out of office.)
I work on a drug unit and I have seen results. Naloxone availability is much better under trump. Fact. Yes there are more numbers..its a cheap drug but less caskets.
i mean who would make an entire fake documentary about DR. Fauci creating COVID-19 if it wasnt to add to the fog of covid-19 disinformation. probably neo nazis looking to take the blame off trump for creating such a blunder. think a lil bit outside of the box.
If you look at fentanyl deaths..they declined in 2018 cause Trump declared it a national health emergency. Like when he stopped china travel at the start of Covid. CDC was predicting 2million dead. 2 million!!! Facts
Trump doesn't care if Melania's son has to go back to school.
literally any forum praising and fetishizing trump and his cronies. sinclair broadcast group, they run local news stations that reach almost 4 out of 10 americans, they also delayed their conspiracy theory doc that Dr. fauci created COVID-19. tell me, is that not disinformation?
This was the dumbest interview ever because it was a battle of stats. Trump had his according to cases and this reporter or whatever he is had his according to population
My mom died in May, right after  with  debuted their custom  stamps. Mom was appalled by Trump and genuinely looked forward to the mail. So all of the Thank You notes (there were a lot, service was 10 people) went out with these.
We can't argue issue specific anymore..they want Trump out any cost. The impeachment with flimsy reason is enough. They WILL steal this election.
There is no choice if you love our country, there is no choice if you don‚Äôt want to murder innocent babies and there is no choice if you believe in GOD/JESUS. The only choice is to vote for President Trump and rid congress of all liberals/democrats and RINO RATS, this is our duty
I don't understand why everyone is so surprised by this. One thing we've learned about Trump during his term is if you disagree with him on any point you're getting out down. If he believes the sky is pink with purple polka dots, &amp; you say it's blue, then you're a moron.
It was terrible how they treated President Trump, it was also shameful how the media covered up for Obama and Biden so the people of the USA could not judge Obama/Biden on what they did that hurt the USA so much for the 8 terrible years. THE MEDIA is the true enemy anymore.
Wondering if "Pennywise" from "It" was modeled after Trump?
I do to, we need true blue conservatives, same here in Pennsylvania,we nominated terrible republicans for governors , in 2022 we have to get behind Lou Barletta, and as for 2020 trump and vote straight republican and defeat Cartright

Trump's complete lack of respect &amp; empathy for John Lewis &amp; his family is atrocious. It shouldn't be a surprise coming from him, but Lewis not attending his inauguration is not a get out of jail free card on dignity. If you can't feel human emotions, at least learn to fake one.

Think if we treated him like a toddler we'd get results?  Us: You better not tell the whole country they have to wear masks or you'll be in big trouble mister.  Dumb Trump: Nobody tells me what to do. I do everything I want &amp; if I say everyone wears a mask, everyone wears a mask.

Dude, my dream is for Biden to win, so Trump would then refuse to accept the results, saying it was 'rigged' and claiming 'voter fraud'.  This would continue until Inauguration Day, where Trump would still refuse, and have to be escorted out of the WH by the military.
What a total douchebag. Biden has never said anything about debates. He‚Äôs agreed to 3. Trump want to delay Election Day. Such bad actors.

Trump is to blame for his inaction. He did nothing but joke about it and minimize it for months. He is the worst and most ineffectual president we‚Äôve ever had. He just doesn‚Äôt have the capacity to do the job.

Never Trump means Biden and that is bad for America
I understand she worked for fox and is Republican...But if she still in the " It depends on Biden V.P. pick"  phase ..After "All" Trump has done and is doing...Then she was never going to vote for Biden anyways..
Free enterprise helps "people of color" to a greater extent than anything the Democrats could ever do. Democrats are the historical party of KKK members. Black Americans have tasted success under President Trump. They had no where else to turn and it worked and will work again.

Ahhh. So shady land deals with a relative and a lobbyist? Still would take a cheese sandwich over trump
It's not as simple as all that. People are more than their views on the issues. They are also defined by their integrity, and Biden's principles are deep-seated. He is not going to give Trump a free pass for his many crimes.
Emily, how is #COVID19 management in your part of the world? Here in the US, it's a disaster. Trump and his Republicans are pushing to reopen schools even though the #pandemic is raging out of control in almost every state. We are nowhere near being ready to reopen safely!

Alex Azar is useless. Andrea Mitchell is doing her level best to get him to explain why Trump is promoting hydroxychloriquine and he just won't oppose him. He won't address tweets either. It's unbelievable.
Facebook, Twitter remove video of Trump falsely claiming children are 'almost immune' to coronavirus
also this interesting, that the state has had their eyes on trump for about the same content that the fisa warrant they are fighting Rice and other former administration officials about for going on 10 or more years.    Trump has been a surveillance target
that means the investigations falls under the non political and appropriate definition that barr has set.   that means the GOP and trump will possibly out themselves and cause more the investigation to surface, something  they cant afford during the election season,  lol :)
There is literally nothing Trump could say in a debate that would make me reconsider voting for Joe Biden, even for a second.
My doctor said this in the very beginning, in March, and it bothered me. But he soon realized that Trump's handling of this was a travesty.

I can criticize Trump for being many things: thin-skinned, childish, arrogant, condescending, a bully, a conspiracy theorist; but the fact that Trump supporters go after Biden for losing his mind when Trump isn't too far behind in that category isn't a good strategy.

Oh, someone is definitely a fraud here.  (It's Trump. Trump is the fraud. Sorry that I have to put this, but some people are really really dumb.)
Legal?  It never stopped Trump before.
But trump will not refuse to leave. Many strategists believe he will set up a cable network, steal Fox loyalists, rant for two hours a day how he was robbed and attack Biden, and try to run himself or through his children in 2024. This is most in keeping with trump's nature.
Tax Returns are also private, so by your rationale, Trump is quite reasonable in not permitting his tax returns to become public.  What say you?
Would you be opposed to a live televised cognitive test performed by Trump and Biden?  If so, why?  BTW, rejecting same based upon a claim that same is just a 'stunt' (or similar inference) will be deemed as conceding that Trump would do far better than Biden in that test.
Well Yates just said that Durham should release his findings now cause it would be trying to help trump win the election. So they want it kept secret until after.

Since Joe can‚Äôt see, someone tell him Trump is far more cognitively declined than Biden!
Trump trashes Obama's Lewis eulogy that pressed for voting rights   This just shows what a slug Trump is. Not an empathetic bone on his body. He is clueless and obviously upset with Obama‚Äôs popularity and  the respect he has earned.
Trump doesn‚Äôt care
You do realize that our country has had a mixed economy of capitalism/socialism since before its inception, do you not? Also, there‚Äôs a difference between imperfect and corrupt. Trump is corrupt.
That would be much better than the Trump way.  Get him out NOW and save the Republican party.
Biden is not hiding. That is your imagination. Biden is willing to debate. The schedule is up to the FEC, that is on their scheduled date, not on Trump's or Biden's
Cognitive tests are only given if Doctors believe there is an issue. Hence they tested Trump, Doctors obviously don't think Biden warrants one!

There are now answers here, maybe more questions? Maybe the unknown is a problem? And maybe Fauci has been wrong,and has an agenda, but we are supposed to trust Donald Trump? And his supporters?
The problem we have with that, a Trump crony, Louis DeJoy happens to be the Post Master General, will make sure those ballots won't get there in time to count, or have the voters get their absentee ballots on time.
hey are just preaching what their GOD,  wants them to say, so when Trump loses in November, he &amp; AG Barr will go to the courts &amp; say there was voter fraud, using his unqualified judges to rule. That is how Trump will try to steal an election.

Trump said - It is what it is
Trump takes no responsibility
Because Trump is the one constantly harping on its going to be a rugged election, MASSIVE fraud so it is relative to our conversation.
I live in Pa, there have been a few cases of low number voter fraud, usually county employees both Dem and Republican. But no MASSIVE busloads of illegals going from polling place to polling place like Trump claims.
TRUMP: They are dying that‚Äôs true. It is what it is.

The entire interview has to be one of the most uncomfortable and embarrassing things I‚Äôve ever seen. Trump can‚Äôt answer questions because he‚Äôs flat out stupid. Plain and simple.
This rain is out of pocket like Trump.
A lot of my friendships (were they ever really friends) have gone by the wayside. I give no quarter to those who support Trump and his racism, bigotry, lies, genocidal behavior, etc... They did/do. Nope. My integrity is more important to me than to have ‚Äúfriends‚Äù like that.
Today is Barack Obama's Birthday, we should wish him a Happy Birthday on all of Donald Trump's social media sites.
This is pure idiocy! Trump is incapable of debating at this point of his dementia! They can‚Äôt be serious! They have to be bluffing, so that Biden wants less debates and they can say that he doesn‚Äôt want to debate? Biden should accept whatever they offer.

You‚Äôre a scumbag, but THIS TIME you‚Äôre right: wear a mask. If you wear one it could help set an example for all the children who are about to become infected with COVID-19, and in many cases die, because Jared Kushner and Tiny Trump wanted to make Democratic governors look bad.

Somehow Grassley still has not realized Trump believes he can do ANYTHING HE WANTS. And why shouldn't he? The Senate confirmed this when they acquitted him in the impeachment trial.

Only to have the American People replace them when Biden comes into office...I don't know how or why anyone would call themselves a  Republican,  and stand by and watch America become Russia
I‚Äôve said all along. Once Biden gets the nomination he can bow out and Harris can be the candidate. I say she picks Cory Booker to be on the ticket with her. Identity politics at its worst.

Biden could win 320 electoral votes, the Dems could flip the Senate and gain 20+ in the House and yet for the rest of our lives we‚Äôll still hear Trump say ‚Äòwell i dont know a lot of people say we actually won that crooked election‚Äô and he‚Äôll make headlines forever saying so

still a capitalist who does not have the people's best interest in mind who has a damn prosecutor as his running mate; i just dont know abt this chief, the types of ppl who support Biden and the DNC and other normalcy candidates vs. people who are more radical or devoutly leftist
Biden supporter? Idk, even if they might have the betterment of the people in mind depending on who you talk to, their proposed solutions for a better world under capitalism are way too flawed and fallacious and kinda bootlicky for my tastes, for at the end of the day, Biden's
I loved his comments of disgust in Biden partisan polictizing the virus.  Haha. I mean he did create the mask partisan line.
'Wearing the mask is less about you contracting the virus,' Joe Biden said. 'It‚Äôs about preventing other people from getting sick.

It's been 2 days since Kamala Harris news broke and I'm already tired of it !! I'll tell ya what will probably happen. Probably Oct. and Biden will  be found to Not be able/fit to be able to continue to run. They, Dems will replace Biden with Harris as presidential candidate !!
So you're gonna vote for a sexual predator/ racist in Biden, or is she a liar? And if she's a liar, you're gonna vote for someone that lies about sex crimes and racism?
Biden has long had strong relations with the African American community and often talks on the trail about serving as vice president to the country‚Äôs first black president, says  College political analyst Chris Borick.
so true, thought Joey's upper denture was going to fall out today, Biden/Kamala is enough to gag a maggot. üëáüôÑ
Hillary raised about $1 Billion in 2016 and lost.  It's not the money, it's the political philosophy; in that respect, Biden will lose bigly (but Dems will predicably resist introspection, and blame everyone else but themselves for their loss).
Threatening a U.S. Presidential candidate?  . What are you going to do about this? Fox News is threatening Joe Biden. A woman whose friends with sex traffickers?
No, America isn't fine with that, to the extent that Dems are also involved with the same activities that you insinuate are nefarious.  America wasn't "fine" with electing Hillary President of the US b/c of Dem hypocrisy, and the same holds true w/ Biden in 2020.  Get real.
Why would Biden decide to step aside? I think he should be very careful now that his running mate has been named.

I have no respect for women who use men to get ahead! When you're a strong woman in your own right, you don't do that! Kamala Harris said that she supported the women who accused Joe Biden of sexual harassmen. She also accused him  of racism! However, she is now his running mate!
Why would little Black and brown girls feel overlooked and undervalued? Is that how Joe.Biden thinks of them? That's such a racist thing to say!  By the way, hasn't Joe Biden noticed that Harris is light- skinned? Does he know her mother is Indian, father Jamaican? Surreal!
I think that‚Äôs the biggest fear is, that although Biden wasn‚Äôt my first choice, I still will be voting for him NO matter what. And with the votes that are going to him how the ‚Äúfollowers‚Äù of the ol‚Äô cheeto are going to feel.

Biden and Harris will appear together Wednesday at a high school in Biden‚Äôs Delaware hometown to discuss their shared vision for how to defeat President Trump.
In 30 years of voting, I have NEVER voted for a Democrat for President. I‚Äôm voting for Biden/Harris in 2020 just to ensure there IS a presidential election in 2024
I don't care about the race or gender of a candidate. I don't care that Joe Biden chose Kamala Harris as his running mate! My concern is about who's going to be strong on keeping the US secure in the face of this "Defund the Police" movement which Harris is okay with!
I see that as a separate issue. The fact is that the Lincoln Project, a Republican group, published a Biden-Harris campaign video, a good one, within an hour or so of the announcement. I applaud that, and I'm not worried about what George's wife was doing at that same time.
Harris thought Biden racist, his star shines brighter in racist homes.
When Obama was president y‚Äôall loved Biden lol
It's been hard watching the "News' today. in re Harris, dems had a hard enough time pitching Biden, but Kamala?

DISTRACTION!!!  Trump pulls the racist card to get the attention back on him and not Biden/Kamala.
WATCH: Chris Borick, Director of the  College Institute of Public Opinion, speaks to  about Joe Biden's choice of Kamala Harris for VP.
Systemic change takes time. And progress will be more difficult with four more years of Trump, than with Biden as president, in my opinion. It's an uphill battle either way, but more so with Trump continuing in office. All just my own opinion, of course. We each get to have them.
Well, let's see! Joe Biden loves children jumping on his lap, sexually harasses women and.children - lots of pictures and videos to support this- and let's not forget that Tara Reade said he raped her when he was a senator. So, why are you voting for a sexual harasser and rapist?
Yes, he did. That's why I'm not a duopoly fan. And, there are also major factual differences between a Trump Administration and a Biden Administration that matter a significant majority of Americans.
If elected, which part of the Biden/Harris radical left agenda will trigger republicans the most?
Ok. That‚Äôs why he stopped incoming travel from China and Europe and the MSM and Biden criticized him for it, even calling him racist.  You can‚Äôt see past your hatred of  Trump.
The mistakes that Trump has made are minor compared to what  would make. Nobody is perfect, but Joe Biden would take that to the extreme.
Did He Say That In Russian?
Biden announced that his VP pick is Kamala Harris. This is not bad news. Her representation can bring a warmth to the politics of today; she will push both progressive and moderate ideals; she will work for all people. We need people like Kamala Harris, so let's fight for her!
That's actually Joe Biden in the picture!
Frankly,  should be given any damned position she wants. She out fundraised all of the other VP candidates, Biden is adopting her policies with little or no attribution...enough of the silent women doing the hard work and getting no credit.
Biden want to take that claim
but Biden vowed to pick a woman
You need African-American votes to win. African-American voters didn't vibe off the cute gay guy, the genki grandma, the old guy with the crazy white hair, or the lady with the big teeth and shoulders. Biden got the key constituencies - which literally IS the point of primaries.

Except Biden is definitely racist and also rubs all on women and little girls...  also Harris is completely crooked and has absolutely no business in the white house.
Not to mention she believes the Biden accusers of sexual assault
Oh yeah, this is the gift that will keep on giving, completely destroyed Biden calling him a segregationist is on record saying she believes Tara, and then decides to join with this what she calls a racist sexual predator, wow, I'm in awe
Yo how great would it be if center-right democrats like Biden, Harris, and Pelosi were actually the radical socialists the far right believes them to be?
Guess you got twittered, doesn‚Äôt play? Only law breakers can get out here, not the truth! Besides biden wouldn‚Äôt be president for about 6 months then pew pew time if not already from fraudulent election! IMO Prepare!
I voted for Gore, Kerry, Obama (twice), and Clinton. I'll be voting for Biden, too. Democrats rarely win when their base feels they "have to" vote for their candidate rather than genuinely wanting to, so maybe ease up on the "you have to vote Biden" rhetoric?
I like her!  I'm so happy about Kamala I haven't given much thought to Biden's cabinet, etc. However, I will, and I'm positive Joe and Kamala have it (almost) totally worked out

Why didn't Obama abs Biden do anything about it for 8 years?
It's a legitimate concern depending on where you live.  Funny enough, the Biden sub-reddit group is full of pictures of people claiming their Biden signs were damaged or stolen.  I think that's mostly a joke, though.
Nobody's stopping Biden from using the postal service for ads...  Also, it's obvious neither  nor anybody else who asked for $3,000,000,000 for the mail voting scheme has ever used the postal service.  That's allocating ~$20/per prospective voter for mail - postage.
Manic pixie joe biden

Who gets to decide which are "right-wing extremist" groups?  Biden/Harris can decide that anyone that voted for #Trump is a "right-wing extremist".   In other words, a #CivilWar (may have already started?).  Guess which side has more guns?

All I know is that Trump CAN'T bend to pressure from the left. It will always be against his political interest which is maintained by strong opposition to the left. We can't be sure Biden is bendable, but we can be sure that Trump isn't and that he is pushing us to the right.

Again, you're wasting your time. You still change 0 votes and caring for Biden is pathetic.   Again: you care about courting their votes (wrong way or no) more than Biden does.  You'd be better trying to push the Biden camp to adopt policies and appointees that we'd vote for.
Bahahaha. No one is letting Americans in

Happy Saturday, Biden‚Äôs a bitch
Your bias is adorable. You should save your energy, you have 4 more years to complain.  The DNC‚Äôs cheating will be monumental, but I think Biden will still be soundly defeated.
Just like what happened under Obama when he signed away habeas corpus, altered the Posse Comitatus Act so military can arrest civilians, and expanded wars from 2 to 7 countries (plus numerous secret wars), the media will ignore Biden as well.

Anyone who thinks there will be a #BidenHarrisLandslide2020  is fooling themselves.  It will be VERY VERY close. Just like it was in 2016. Just like we thought it was a sure win for Clinton and now we think it's a sure win for Biden?  No.  It's 50/50 right now.  Show up. VOTE.
Didn‚Äôt Bernie endorse Biden/Harris.... why are y‚Äôall so damn butt hurt, stop making excuses for your lazy partisan advocacy... Seriously are we still following Jasons theories and basis for advocacy after his ridiculous behavior throughout the primaries.
These mask-wearing, MSM loving, ignorant excuses for humans actually believe this is going to happen. Do they not remember 2016!!?? Your candidate is Joe Biden - are you kidding me? #KAG #MAGA
Like the politicians who supported destroying iraq? Lets jail them, maybe?  In any case, thats not what he said. Try again and stop making excuses for wanting to jail your political enemies. Ill accept an apology from Biden, but until then I choose to take him at his word.
If Obama killed 170,000 Americans with feckless management of a pandemic, they would speak of nothing else. Biden could NEVER do it!  There, fixed your asinine tweet for you.
Biden‚Äôs Parade is happening today also.
The only equivalence I made between them is pointing out that you said both are preferable to Biden.
I hope you know Biden supports more funding for the cops sparky, and how is he going to destroy america
I hate when people say this shit cause we know EXACTLY what biden-Harris foreign policy is gonna look like
That wasn‚Äôt an answer!  Trump ALWAYS LIES!  But no, Biden should speak the Truth, nothing to hide!
how the hell is Joe Biden pro-lawlessness, he literally wrote the crime bill, and voted for the Iraq War
So its been roughly 9 hours now... i notice you haven't figured out what specific crime you wanna charge hunter biden with.
This white evangelical will he voting for the only sane choice - Joe Biden. A man of character and integrity; a man of faith who knows Jesus as his Lord and Savior. A good family man who has been a public servant serving this country for many years.
Hope like hell Kanye will not be Donald Trump‚Äôs fool! Remember Donda would have wanted nothing more than to have been for Joe Biden and his nominees. Also know your true fake friends. ü•±üò©ü§£

She still around? She claims we live under a dictatorship and wants to vote for a BIGGER government to control even MORE of our lives with Biden.
The fact that this is trending is pretty clear disclosure that Biden is seen as a placeholder
Still waiting for that proof also (rather than your twisted not so funny liberal opinion). Perhaps a list backing up all your assertions, one by one?
I hope this flies too. What I like here, and Biden and Harris know, the more the media attacks Trump over USPS, the more it helps them.
Call em' like I see em'. Get used to it.
I hope this flies too. What I like here, and Biden and Harris know, bitherism as the racist lie it is.
If  Biden can elicit this emotional a response from someone who seems as soulless as  then he has to have substance. Why does Lindsey go so far to aid a &amp; abet an empty shell of a man like Trump?
Yeah it's like Biden has been saying this election is for the soul of the nation. I think if Trump wins then this country is soulless and it gets the government it deserves not the one it needs.
I hope this flies. What I like in this cartoon, and Biden and Harris must be having a good laugh over, is Trump and USPS.
But you still don‚Äôt know if you will support Biden.
Great. She‚Äôs still pushing for progressive policies though. Also, if a candidate doesn‚Äôt vote or do 100% of what you want, are you gonna just say they‚Äôre a moderate or establishment and dismiss them altogether? AOC isn‚Äôt Pelosi or Biden or Harris. There are levels.

Yeah, it really does help to have the right name. At least Joe Biden DIDN‚ÄôT INSTALL HIS F-ING FAMILY OF UNQUALIFIED GRIFTERS IN THE WHITE HOUSE TO ENRICH THEMSELVES ON THE TAXPAYERS‚Äô DIME.

Since Biden's the likely Nov win &amp; he's adamantly opposed to Putin's aggression, now's the premium time for Russia to move full force against Ukraine. The US being preoccupied with Covid19's an added inducement.
Democrats shut down my polling place, making it inconvenient for me to vote in person. The postal union endorsed Biden. Am I supposed to trust them to deliver my vote? Who exactly is doing the suppressing here? Or is what you're saying it's okay to suppress GOP votes.

Good question. Clinton - no. Carter - no. Bush - no. Obama and Biden, if he's still around (!), yes.
I‚Äôve been reading about the reactions to this in Turkish twitter earlier; now that I‚Äôve seen the actual thing: ouch.! Pretty bad.  If this is what they are came up for dealing with Turkey, a major ally(?), Biden team needs a lot of work in the foreign policy area.
Postal Union endorsed Joe Biden. The same Postal Workers that will be handling mail in ballots. Do you see why people would think shady things would happen with everyone mailing ballots. Also, 100k mailed ballots in NYC were DQed (1 in 5 NYers) with results yet to be finalized.
I agree, what needs to be understood Biden doesnot have mind of its own. He reads 'papers' just like pappu..Doesnot understand how anvey americans are with 911 mentality. He is going against whole america
Strangly, your argument implies Trump wants vote and Biden wants money? Secondly, we are.taking abt USA not avg. currupt indian-can-do-anything-for-money politicians. Lived in both, USA holds high morals,none of 3rd world scams. Every american hate Jihad. Period.
Oh Christ who gives a shit about the Rose Garden. I hope Biden has it restored to it's original settings.

With these USPS shenanigans, I'm starting to wonder if people might just come together and say "F it, I'll stand in line all day if I need to so I can vote for Biden and ensure it counts"
No I think she has a point. When you think of Bernie Sanders you think about his progressive policies. When I think of Biden I just think of a guy who isn‚Äôt Trump lol. It‚Äôs not wrong to say that the majority of his campaign strategy has been to demonize Trump (rightfully so)

Yes, it is. The post office cannot handle it AND the union endorsed Biden. I'm supposed to trust them with my vote? I'd hate it if the endorsed Trump too.
A lot of people voted for Joe Biden in the primary because he was the safest candidate because he was an old white man, fearing that most Americans would not vote for an Asian or a woman or a black guy. How the hell is that not using his racial and sexual identity to gain votes?

The point is that whenever a republican is in office dems will elect moderates in response. Bernie got 46% in 2016 but much less in 2020 (even accounting for Warren; a lot of supporters went over to moderates). We‚Äôd have a better change of running a progressive against a Biden.
"It's totally unlike that no good lazy golf-loving Obama! Who was a traitor that the Durham Report will tell us all about in my October Surprise for Biden! THANK YOU!"
Biden leads nationally by 8% in poll of polls, and has for WEEKS.    So THAT'S what this is about: preventing votes   0 doubt Trump will try to stay in power indefinitely. Alas, The US Constitution says his term is O-V-E-R on January 20.  SCOTUS will put an end to it before then.
Bernie has dropped out and endorsed Biden FYI. He's asking you to vote for Biden to stop Trump and then work with him to push Biden left.

I can just hear the right- Biden holding a press conference- who does he think he is?  He‚Äôs a candidate. And you know it.
Just because Trump is an attention whore doesn‚Äôt mean Biden has to follow suit.  And he does answer questions.

I don't dispute that about Biden at all. He absolutely is. But I disagree with you about the rest.  Bernie has flaws. But he also pressured companies like Amazon, Disney and Target to pay workers $15/minimum wage. Far from selfish or turning his back on workers.
When Joe Biden,  chose Sen. Kamala Harris,  as his running mate, I knew the racist birthers would come out of their snakepits in droves. The ghosts of George Wallace and Bull Connor are senior advisers for the Trump campaign.
Joe Biden supporters fear Kanye West right now. #VISION2020
No, he's not an active supporter of the oligarchy. Long story short, he doesn't want to be or feel responsible for Trump. I say that as a swing stater who cast my 1st non-D vote in my life in 2016 for Jill Stein and who will not vote for Biden.
Kamala Harris said she believed Joe Biden sexually assaulted women, and that he was a moderate on segregation (of all things!) but look at how the media covers her heel turn compared to how they covered someone like say Ted Cruz on Trump.

Your conspiracy theories aren‚Äôt working anymore! President Biden won‚Äôt  walk away from questions
Biden is stuck in your head and it‚Äôs glorious. It‚Äôs only going to get worse. He‚Äôs setting up camp in your demented mind. November 3rd.
I'm calling BS.  Biden's platform as stated is arguably less Progressive than Barack Obama's platform was (esp. if you consider the times)  Anyone who claims that Biden will be the most Progressive Presidents since FDR is delusional or lying to you.
Why don't you tell us what your side accuses hunter biden of - what specific crime do you want to say he committed?
Trump will go to 4 swing states in a day.  Biden won‚Äôt be able to keep up and will try to compensate with TV ads.  That‚Äôs the exact same losing strategy Cankles used.
GOOD READ!  "Biden‚Äôs own academic career was unimpressive‚Äîhe repeated the third grade, earned all Cs and Ds in his first three semesters at the University of Delaware except for A's in P.E., a B in ‚ÄúGreat English Writers‚Äù and an F in ROTC."  via
I just wish there was a viable alternative to Biden because of how garbage he is.  This post office thing might be the only thing that may convince me to vote for Joe, but I really *really* don't like the idea of doing so.
Tangent, I know, but it just bothers me that we're supposed to see Biden as a staunch defender of Social Security when his record is the opposite.  That we are supposed to see Democrats as defenders of the post office when so many of them spent years advocating it's privatization
'We warned them: ‚ÄúF**k around and find out.‚Äù "Not Me Us" runs very deep.   via
Joe Biden is still in the pocket of Private health insurance, he is just more willing to do symbolic gestures that don't actually threaten the industry's right to continue extract profit from the suffering.
Joe Biden is a coward
Trump says the ‚Äòsuburban housewife‚Äô will vote for him over Biden  via
I don't think Biden would be actively fighting to make those things worse, but I doubt they'll be a priority for him, not when he had a large role in getting us into many of the crises we currently face.  Biden has not taken up a single Sanders policy without cutting out its core
So the race is between a candidate with a record of threatening to cut Social Security, and being part of an administration that try to cut Social Security, then lying and claiming he never did so, vs Trump's attempts to subvert SS.  Biden isn't as good on this as we wish he was.

Voting third party is not a vote for Trump. What it is, is a vote that Biden failed to earn.  We should encourage him to seek out to those voters and make his case.I can get out and will vote Biden as soon as the doors open. But for the elderly, its a different story. But i see King Moron has another brain dead follower. #DumpTrump2020
And when Biden wins in November it will be His will as well.
Y‚Äôall said ‚Äúonly EXACTLY what I want‚Äù in 2016 and look where that got us.  You have to vote for the candidate closest to your beliefs.  That‚Äôs how voting has always been.  Biden isn‚Äôt perfect at all, but he‚Äôs enough.
#Resisters  we have a major problem Do not follow this person, they have spoken against Biden and Harris
Don't think for a second that if Biden wins, that this will stop his "friends" from pulling off this type of crap.
When Joe Biden is President, we cannot just turn the page and forget this presidency. We must hold Trump and everyone associated with him accountable. Meddling with the USPS is enough to send Trump to prison for the rest of his life.
We cant let him do that, once Biden is elected then Trump only has till January 20th then thats it. Trump cant change that law because he doesnt have the power to. You must remember that the balance of powers is about to kick his ass to the curb
Im voting Biden because he got a plan to get us out of the pandemic. Trump just golf's while we lose over 1000 Americans per day to the Coronavirus. I would like to get out of this alive and intact. Trump is not a Christian in anyway shape or form. Dont go on theories either
"President Biden" will be sufficient.
I think more than that support Biden/Harris ticket, but let‚Äôs just play it safe.
Not a Biden fan. I am going to vote for him though. Trump is killing all checks and balances. Barr is doing his bidding. Also, Trump seems on the decline. He‚Äôs not sharp anymore. Used to have great combacks: not now. Lies all the time..Biden is old toobut I like Harris over Pence

Totally agree without getting Biden in the White House!  The environment is fucked with 4 more years of Trump. Although we have differences it‚Äôs great you support change!  Trump is a fraud and dangerous. Vote blue! üåä
Do you think Biden will pursue legal action against him if he wins ü§î
One of these things is not like the other.   gets a lot wrong, but he got this right.  Now get on board with universal health care Mr. Biden. Your running mate said she was for it.  #UnionStrong #UniversalHealthCare
Now I know u have taken the kool aid. ‚ÄúInstitutional racism‚Äù by Biden/Harris but ‚Äúprogressive‚Äù for trump. U have no clue and I will not waste my time with a racist‚Äôs advocate
Wow, didn't Obama just support Uncle Joe?  Man, these leaks.   Tensions linger between Biden and Obama camps throughout 2020 primary campaign: report
He definitely said that he planned to push Biden left. That's exactly the reason he stayed on the ballot to get more delegates. He's said this since the day he suspended his campaign and has said it multiple times since.
No doubt. 4 more years with Trump will be a total disaster, and our environment/earth won‚Äôt make it. Get Biden in and push for progressives inside. It‚Äôs our best path! üá∫üá∏
Nate Silver: we've studied this for a very long time, and the conclusion we've come to is that Biden could win. Or Trump could win. Really this could go either way, because I qualify each result so much that I communicate nothing and am not capable of actually projecting results.
Plenty of anti-Biden ads running on streaming services here.
Like when Obama and Clinton were endorsed by police unions?  Biden was going to get the endorsements..which you had no problem with until Trump got them.  Hypocrisy much?
First anti Biden TV ad ive seen in Pennsylvania, saying he wants to ban fracking. I don‚Äôt think he actually does. But I warned the bad optics of that are not captured in ‚Äúfor / against fracking‚Äù polls
No im ticked because thats wrong, yes I am voting for Biden but im not going to leave people in the dirt. This virus doesnt care about politics and if we dont get it under control Dr. Fauci said it WILL BE WORSE than the Spanish Flu in 1918
I jog outdoors for exercise. Without a mask, keeping distance from others I'm for masks worn at indoor locations outside of the home. Or at outdoor events where there are a lot of people. But I hope Biden doesn't mean he wants us wearing masks outdoors at all times for 3 months.
You know im voting for the first time, im voting for Biden no matter what, but you must be prepared for ANYTHING Trump has to throw at us. I know his tactics, but with the new things coming out, we need to watch closely
Old Joe is about to get thrown under the bus.  This campaign is all about getting her into position to run president.  If I was a democrat I‚Äôd be pissed.   Tensions linger between Biden and Obama camps throughout 2020 primary campaign: report
You are seeing what im saying, that we have to be prepared to back Biden and Harris no matter what happens. THIS IS A FIGHT FOR OUR COUNTRY BACK FROM A POWER HUNGRY NARCISSISTIC TO BE DICTATOR!!! BIDEN MUST WIN IF THE USA IS TO SURVIVE AS A NATION!!!
Biden will have the military remove him if he doesnt leave, thats the law btw if he isnt out by January 20th
No he is going to crash it even worse, read this article  its been his plan all along!!!!
Also Trump is going to crash the economy with crashing the DOW JONES when Biden wins and then blaming it on him
yeah but its going to be blackmailing Biden, and Trump refuses to leave office
Yeah the world is suffering due to Trump, America is waking up thank God so the hell will be over November 3rd. We need all the support for Biden and Harris as possible. Trump gonna blackmail them by crashing the DOW JONES after Biden takes office then blaming it on him.
It‚Äôs been 5 months now and these assholes can‚Äôt give us a reason to vote for Biden aside from shrieking about Trump.
The Biden mask campaign is smart--and not just from a public health stance. It's politically smart, because it puts Trump in a corner. Trump either has to agree with Biden, or contradict himself &amp; health authorities on mask wearing.
fivethirtyeight has biden likely to win in a bunch of those states, including: NC, Arizona, wisconsin. Even Florida. Thoughts??
It's utterly fitting that Governor "The-Constitution-is-above-my-pay-grade-Murphy" is co-chairing the Democratic convention.  is arguably the dumbest of Democrat Governors, therefore particularly qualified to introduce Harris and Biden.
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think he really cares about what a 30-something Pod Save America host thinks about him, and that honestly might be why he‚Äôs the nominee.‚Äù
Expect the national polls to narrow in the coming weeks/months. What matters is polling in key swing states, like MI, WI, PA. If Biden can win those 3 states, he'll win the presidency.
Before the rage, fear, and shame set in, the sting of Trump/Pence winning will be temporarily nullified by Biden/Harris losing.
I‚Äôm really taking aback by the # of conservatives (such as the guest) openly talking about how they don‚Äôt believe Biden will survive his 1st term or even make it to the election. The current POTUS is obese, eschews healthy food and exercise. Not the picture of health.
Rasmussen put Trump at 40% black support a few wks back. Trump won 2016 with 8% of the black vote.  No way is Basement Biden losing to POTUS.
Fact check: Trump promotes another birther lie, this time about Kamala Harris
Im a bad ass man for Biden
Joe Biden calls for a nationwide mask mandate as he pushes his plan to combat coronavirus: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not about your rights. It‚Äôs about your responsibilities as an American.‚Äù
Let the ASSHOLES look into it. And then the truth will come out. The IDIOT is just trying to find anything he can wrong against BIDEN/HARRIS with the help of the R/Putin. Some guy I heard on radio was bitching about Harris lying wed. in her speech. What about Don everyday?
Given the binary choice of Trump and Biden, I‚Äôd choose Biden every time. #CountryOverParty
That's all he has? "We're not gonna let Joe Biden &amp; Kamala Harris cut America's meat?" Yup, that's all he has to run on. ü§£

We will be able to breathe a sigh of relief when Biden takes office. Its been so depressing here in the USA since we cant have much other human contact. Its depressing and honestly I have meltdowns everynight cuz im ASHAMED of being an American
I see the pumping of her 'Indian heritage' is in full swing... wish I could have seen her do that during the primaries, she would have beaten Biden... lol
You have three choices. Sit out the election, vote for Trump, or vote for Biden. Our earth can‚Äôt take another 4 years of Trump.
Remember in 2008 when the media viewed the race between Barack Obama and John McCain as a very close race?  Yeah, 2020 is nothing like that.  Joe Biden and Kamala Harris are going to blow Donald Trump out of his bunker.
The context that the graph lacks is that Trump is literally using fascist's tactics. While Biden's centrism is maddening and his paternalistic nonsense is cringe worthy, he is not a fascist like Trump.   And that is the rub this election cycle.
From this moment forward, when I find myself thinking about trump or his idiotic behavior I will quickly switch to pouring good energy into Biden/Harris. Before there was no dream. No I can see a future!
For four years, Democrats cried foul over misinformation. Will they now that Kamala Harris spread blatant and obvious lies? In today‚Äôs podcast, I expose the lies. #podcast #BidenHarris2020  #KamalaHarris

Speaking if those accusers... when the hell will Biden be held accountable?
Just when I think the gaping anal orifice can not do any more damage...he does. Let us all hope that Biden/Harris take back the WH and McConnell gets flushed down the political sewer of "hasbeen".
Again, please vote for Biden, but know that it may not make any difference, because he is blatantly saying he's sabotoging the elction on live TV. His administration recently established that they have no qualms about using a secret police force to intimidate and punish us.
The world has never laughed at the US as they do now. No major leader picks up your phone calls-all waiting for this nightmare to pass. Is Biden able to fix all the ties that you have broken? Doubt it, but at least he won't destroy what little that remains.
Trump on Biden: "He doesn't know anything, but he knew everything!"

Oh, do you hate racism now, sharer of memes of Democrats in blackface? Don‚Äôt forget Joe Biden happily shared the stage with an African-American man for eight years. Your hero has a lengthy history of racism.

Wow.  You people are fucking weird.  You believe stupid stuff.  The Recession began under the Bush presidency.  There was a recovery bill, but no provision for giving funds to individuals.  Obama-Biden then built the longest lasting economic expansion in us history.
Most people don‚Äôt enjoy interacting with those who disagree with them. The fact that Joe Biden was willing to select as his running mate someone who is not afraid to challenge him speaks volumes. Obviously he has the strength of character to process criticism - quite an asset.
"It's not clear how often Joe Biden is receiving these briefings, but even one weekly briefing would mean he's getting filled in more often than Donald Trump is lately, according to a HuffPost report."
How childish can Trumps campaign be. Not only is Biden still going to pass Trump &amp; beat him, he won't resort to cartoons to do it.
I love the sound of this headline. I hope that on November 3rd we all can say we absolutely hammered Trump. ----------------------------------  Read This: "Biden Welcomes Kamala, Who Absolutely Hammers Trump"
Thank you for the amazing speech and you have a major influence on people. You know how to reach into their hearts and help them see that Biden is really the only hope for the nation
Yes as a Christian every life is important,  every immigrant is , every black is important, not just before being born, but after birth is when it counts .  I will be voting Biden and Harris.  You have a chance to redeem yourself, but i see you continue on a narrow ugly path
We Got a Black Woman on the Ticket. At Last.
I‚Äôm no fan of Biden but his platform calls for nationwide decriminalization of cannabis and expunging all cannabis-related convictions, and ending prison time for drug-use.
As a leftist, I‚Äôm not very enthused. Biden and Harris were near the bottom of my list (above Bloomberg). I‚Äôll still be voting for them, though.
1) if you are talking about Biden it was not. In fact it was one of his more enthusiastic speeches. 2) I‚Äôm sooo happy to hear coherent sentences again! 3) your boi: covfefe, hamberder, Nambia, Yo Semite, ThighLand...
If Biden is elected I‚Äôm actually really afraid for all the children.

You want change? Start by simplifying and reducing the man made complexity that requires the wealthy to hire me and you to optimize taxes, estate etc. Those are not changed by voting for Biden over Trump. Neither wants disruption to the system.

I‚Äôll be voting Biden/Harris. There are ppl, some progressives particularly, who are frustrated &amp; disappointed, rightfully so in some ways. Listening &amp; understanding is more persuasive than shaming, insulting,&amp; belittling people. That‚Äôs not helpful for November or the future.
Now that Biden has picked Harris to be his VP thats going to change really quickly
Im right with you Kamala!!! LETS DEFEAT TRUMP ONCE AND FOR ALL AND NEVER LET HIM IN THE WHITE HOUSE AGAIN!!! #BidenHarris2020Landslide Im so glad Biden picked you because you got what it takes to get things DONE and DONE RIGHT
Thought Biden had a good shot at winning in November, but it is clear now that the Democratic party is split on supporting Biden as a canidate after his VP announcement.  Unity behind Republican party and lack of by democrats is a sure way to have Trump re-elected.
Yup, that's what I thought. Harris wasn't Biden's pick.
Yes. He absolutely does. I don‚Äôt understand why you think differently. You have three choices; sit out the election again, vote for Biden or vote for Trump. Which candidate gives you a better shot of including progressives?  Better to be on the inside than looking in..

i don't care how Kamala identifies. I don't care about the Biden/Harris ticket. I just don't want Trump to win. At this point, I'd vote for a bag of dog shit over trump.
same thing i made of the dems chosing biden in the first place.
The only reason I think Biden should debate Trump is because if he doesn't the GOP will say Joe was afraid. Get them up there and let Biden obliterate trump. Let trump show the world how smart Joe is.

It‚Äôs so boring, and so predictable. No matter who Biden selected, they would be saying it was the worst possible pick, he‚Äôs an idiot, it ensures a Trump victory in November. #yawn
How will Joe Biden and Kamala Harris play with the far left that seems to be in firm control of the Democratic Party? Joe wrote the laws and Kamala enforced them. Doesn't that seem contradictory to the defund and eliminate police movements? It's going to be interesting to watch!
And this is interesting.   Ayaan Hirsi Ali calls out Biden for quoting Muhammad pronouncing Sharia law in remarks to Muslim voters
I‚Äôm pretty sure Biden could just sit there and slobber through an entire debate and the brainwashed Twitterites will tell us how and why Joe Biden won the argument. You people need help.
This is a conundrum. A person who has been disrespectful &amp; nasty to Joe Biden accuses another person of being nasty &amp; disrespectful to Joe Biden. Does this person like or dislike Joe Biden? Given a chance, would they attack or defend Joe? Are they a friend or foe?
Biden sucks, imo he was the worst option &amp; the establishment pushed him 2 the nom. He's makin a slam dunk win into a contest w/his gaffes. I'm no fan of Harris cuz of her cringe record in CA. BUT  1st: fascist dumbass &amp; bible nazi need 2 go. Vote'm out then fight 2 push B&amp;H left
I already got one ordered.
How Biden selected Kamala Harris as his running mate
If Biden wins, the second he is sworn in the 25th Amendment will remove him &amp; Harris will take over. The far left‚Äôs plan all along has been to get a black female in the White House. They can‚Äôt do it thru the campaign process so they used smoke &amp; mirrors (Biden) to get it done.

Guess who I thought Biden would pick
now do joe biden

I can't wait to make fun of president Biden every day.
I hear ya man, but a vote against Biden no matter whether or not it‚Äôs for a legitimate 3rd party candidate( Definitely got to get away from a just a two party system and IMO we really need to but after this election cause it‚Äôs too late for 2020) is a vote for a Trump.
Dude...she fell inline just like everyone else and publicly backed Biden. This ain't the way to go about this. Dems out here trying to be aligned and people are talking about Tulsi??? Is this High School?
Biden certainly wasn‚Äôt my first choice that‚Äôs for sure, but I do kind of like Harris. Too early to tell though. I like her over Pence just in case both have dementia...
I think they both suck, but I think Biden is the lesser of two evils. At least he isn‚Äôt trying to delegitimize the vote and democracy. BS proganda. We‚Äôve voted by mail since civil war. Trump votes by mail. To get a ballot you have to register. MIV can‚Äôt be altered like machines.

If Biden gets elected, we are going under as a nation. Biden was Obama vice president. He will continue with Obama legacy. The woman was picked by the Democrats in the house. Biden wanted someone else. Country will be f&amp;$ if Biden wins.

I'm sure people had a chance to listen to Biden and could immediately notice the unmistakable difference. Biden shows us what's been missing. #BidenHarris   Biden expands lead over Trump to double digits: poll
And yet she will be running the country if the Dems get what they want because of Biden‚Äôs decline
One thing I like about Trump/Pence is that they totally trust and respect each other and say uplifting things about each other. This Biden/Harris combination is fake and distrustful, we know there is no comradery or trust between them.
I still see those awful America First action ads here but have seen very few official Trump ones.  Am bombarded with Biden ones.
Yet I don't care for the Pedophile rumors because most of Washington's politicians are Pedophiles. I'm more concerned about Biden's racist rhetoric through the years. That's my main concern because America is triggered now over race, Biden is a lit match put to gasoline.
Making up a word minimizes what this really is. It‚Äôs not ‚Äúbirtherism‚Äù it is... racism.
Sounds like Trump America. President Biden will have his work cut out for him

This is enough of an election win for Trump, Biden has already issued a PR in support. Trump won Middle Eadtern Policy, NO RUSH!   Don't move further with SA! GREAT JOB! Remember what MBS is capable of and what leverage he already has on the US.  Israel will LOVE you even more...
So when are you going to endorse  You obviously aren't supporting Trump and you can't very well support Biden so what are you waiting for? #JoJorgensen2020 #ImWithHer #LetHerSpeak #Election2020 #LP2020
is correct.  I am simply saying that Biden did not choose based on qualifications.  I'm sure she is perfectly qualified.  He picked her simply because of the votes that she could get him.
Tlaib won't even endorse Biden, Rafe.
Biden calls for mandate everyone is to wear mask. Who the hell told him he was president
No! Biden is a racist so his wife must be as well or think alike in most ways. So it will be a downgrade.
Joe Biden had no more input than you or I in picking his VP. His mental decline prevents him making any but the simplest decisions. Harris was picked by the behind the scenes handlers who dress, feed, and keep Joe medicated enough for his rare public appearances.
Did you see the bumper sticker on the Biden "train"? It says "Your hair smells terrific".
It was refreshing, that the announcement by Joe Biden of Kamala Harris as his VP. There‚Äôs no name calling or bullying and especially the lying of facts ! No mention of this classy introduction. Thank You Joe, VOTE üíô
Why keep saying Biden has dementia when it's clear he doesn't?
With that said, that's my personal take on the matter and I'm not about to tell anyone what they should do with their vote, especially if they live somewhere like California or New York that's going to go to Biden whether they show up or not.
I also think it's important to note that whether you think Kamala Harris should or shouldn't be Biden's VP pick, she is a woman born to a South Asian mother and Jamaican father. This moment is huge in ways I've never even had to think about.
I honestly thought Biden was going to pick Tulsi Gabbard.  Oh. I almost forgot,  shes not a woman of color.

I really don't think she can stand the calmness and focus that Joe Biden has. She sees it as a threat, and she's scared.
Nothing like wishing someone well. Maybe they should be talking about anyone else, just anyone. What a horrible thing to say about Joe Biden, implying that he gets sick or dies, or whatever. Pirro is a sick woman. Why does Fox News keep taking her back?
It just hit me why Trump was so obsessed with pointing out Harris attacking Biden during the debates. It's not because he's trying to sow contempt, it's because if he was talked back to like that he would lose his shit. Especially if the person who was critical of him was a woman
That leader isn't Joe Biden.

Herman Cain. Let him rest in peace. He was caught up in Trump's crazy ideas. It will be good to have Biden bring us back to reality. Maybe if Herman Cain had worn a mask, he could have had a few more years. Thank the anti-masker, Trump, for the poor example.

In many real ways just based on policy Trump will burn us down a lot faster, but Biden most certainly will not stop the burning. At best he will make it ... palatable
So you ask about short-term. There is no short-term. Radical changes are needed now end no one is willing to do them. Not Biden and Harris certainly. this is not purity, this is survival and I mean that quite literally and earnestly.
Like it‚Äôs okay that we are voting Biden-Harris but please understand that neither one of them are good people or have made good decisions in politics
We are in a shitty SHITTY position because we believe both candidates are wrong for the US, and however we vote (for Biden and ruining our integrity, for third-party and maybe giving Trump four more years) is EATING US ALIVE. And, yes, we're getting defensive about it.

It's amazing to see the immediate racist and misogynistic blowback from the far right over Kamala Harris being Biden's VP.  It's their playbook at this point: she's not black. She's instituting sharia law. She's a Marxist. She's not a citizen.  It's just disgusting.
Who is Kamala Harris? A look at Joe Biden's vice presidential running mate
She was picked because she's a "Woman" and a "Person of Color".  Biden focused on gender and race, just like he said he would do. I don't know about her "Qualifications", I haven't seen any.
Trump/Pence or Biden/Harris ‚Äî these just different sides of the same coin, regardless of who win, do for self is my message
Biden picks Kamala Harris as running mate
Notice that Biden did not pick an African American running mate. Plus notice also his absolutely open racist past. Even befriending very controversial racist legislators in government and refused to apologize for his friendships, his racist comments through his career.
And so begins the next wave of misogyny, racism, and all around stupidity. If you say Biden lost your vote because he chose Kamala Harris, come one. Admit that you just want to vote for Trump. Seriously. Kamala is more qualified than either Trump or Pence. FFS. So is a teapot.
I didn't know they were investigating Biden. It's about time they started hammering these pedophiles and Rapists in our Government!
These are legit reasons why I don't like Harris and why she was at the bottom of my Biden VP list...This night rattled here in was the beginning of the end of her campaign...That said, no matter who Biden picked I'm voting for him...I'm voting to get #FascistTrump out.
FUN FACT: Kamala is technically a Boomer, Biden is not

Maybe Trump could go biking with Biden.
Kamala Harris is not just a VP for black women, she is a VP for all American citizens of all genders and colors. We should see her as someone who will accept all of us, not just part of us, and someone who will work with Biden for all without bigotry.

It's the same people who say "Biden is going to lose" or "Biden cannot win." Well no shit if you say that and don't support him that's going happen. Why not instead of just giving up lend him your vote. Maybe if you showed encouragement instead of giving up your vote would matter
One retweet I saw today said, to paraphrase, "whoever Biden picks as his VP is going to be bad."  Well not shit they're going to seem bad to you if you go into it like that. I am a pessimistic person, but the pessimism on the internet is another level. Nothing is ever good enough

Let me make one thing vehemently clear: I support Joe Biden. I trust him and believe he represents the Dems well. Once again, is he perfect? No. But he is a damn good choice. And I support Kamala Harris as his VP. I stand by this. I would stand by this if it wasn't against Trump.
Am I doing this out of fear for Trump? Heck yeah. Because I do not want to see someone who has utterly torn this country apart get re-elected. And I will gladly criticize Biden if he is elected and does something dumb as should be, but I am not going to laud it over him (9/?)
If Biden and his campaign is willing to get someone who went after him, imagine what other voices he can pick to fill out his cabinet. They definitely won't all be white yes-men who will rollover to whatever their boss demands them to do. Trust me, they really won't be (8/?)
Again: I. Am. Not. Saying. Don't. Criticize. In fact, Kamala did it to Biden, and Gabbard did it to Kamala. Do you not think they took that to heart? Did you also know that there are other members of the cabinet of the president, and they have voices too? (7/?)

But he hasn‚Äôt done shit in 40 yrs. You think his dementia will help him? Unify the country. Thats on Obama and Biden who toreit apart. Since Trump was elected the left has fought him every step of the way. Accept the greatest president ever and that will unify America.
You too Bill. You would sell your soul to the devil to get rid of Trump. No presidential debates? Have you ever said that before. How about this. We have seen Biden for 40 yrs and he‚Äôs done nothing. Trump has done more than I can list here. We don‚Äôt need an election. Trump 2020
At least wait till they get rid of Biden, shouldn‚Äôt be long.
The level of disdain I have for the people who have decided to make a statement by not voting for Biden/Harris for Very Good Reasons‚Ñ¢ is immeasurable. Idealists will idealize us into the ground until we‚Äôre all dead.
Joe Biden =/= his sons
Found Hunter Biden!
Biden Kamala...this is great.... Im crying!
I am excited about the Biden-Harris ticket, but this is still funny - and true!!
In a press conference on August 11,  announced his running mate.  Here's what you need to know about the democratic Vice-Presidential nominee,   üì∞:  üì∏:
Add Adam Schiff and Ted Lieu to that list. The options Biden will have at DOJ are probably the deepest bench of talent at any position the Democrats have.
Just a thought: "We better hide Biden or were SUNK!"
They say the difference is that people who don‚Äôt like either candidate went heavily for Donald in 2016 and now they are almost all breaking for Biden.
Dead ass, every time... Every. Single. Time.. they replay the video of Biden offering Kamala the VP slot I start tearing up again... The catharsis is REAL.
WATCH: College Students Reject Kamala Harris as Biden VP Pick  via
It only makes it seem like Biden isn‚Äôt capable to debate. And don‚Äôt Americans deserve to see the candidates asked the same questions, see their behavior, and Hear their visions head-to-head?
Weird!  The black community is who chose both Biden and Harris so ....
To be fair, he does say "there‚Äôs a genuine difference between Biden‚Äôs position now and Clinton‚Äôs four years ago." The odds right now have to do with how much time is left. As we move forward, the odds will get better if Biden holds his lead in the polls.
I think it will go something like this... "I would like not having a bigoted, corrupt scumbag and his equally contemptible family running my country.  I will vote Biden/Harris."  Sounds about right.
At Biden's age it's technically called a Walking Mate. Can't be too careful
Agreed with everything up until that last sentence. I was ready to vote for Biden provided that he didn‚Äôt shit the bed on his VP choice (which given the other choices wasn‚Äôt a difficult ultimatum). That said, the bed has been shat.
Dude I‚Äôm literally writing you in over the Senile/Prison Labo- I mean the Biden/Harris ticket #WalkAway
I didn‚Äôt even have high expectations for the VP pick but Harris is definitely one of the worst possible choices (on par with Klobuchar or Pete). In conclusion I really shouldn‚Äôt expected anything from Biden‚Äôs campaign lmao
The first three quotes here are just scary. He addresses the majority like this how can someone act like Biden is any better than Trump. I‚Äôm not for trump, but what the hell is biden doing here for his campaign
Following and listening to far left activists has been highly educational. My biases and assumptions have been challenged daily. But not voting for Biden/Harris because ‚Äúshe‚Äôs a cop‚Äù is some rich delusional selfish üí©.

Amen!!!
Bar set so low-- it takes willful ignorance to think Biden/Harris are more destructive to our Republic than Trump.
I understand and agree with critique of her past as a DA, but the Presidential nominee is Joe Biden, so the outrage seems surprising. He was not gonna pick Ilhan Omar, Pramila Jayapal, AOC, etc. The very public list of options was not the hard left of the party.
I know I shouldn't be surprised, but what's the deal with the level of #Left outrage about Harris? She was not my candidate in the primary (nor was Biden), but there were certainly more conservative options for Biden to pick... The outrage just seems a bit performative to me
I‚Äôm supporting Joe Biden for president because he‚Äôll be a steadfast advocate for our nation‚Äôs public school students and educators.   Will you pledge to support Joe, too?
For sure. Neither represent my views as a socialist, but Harris improves rather than detracts from Biden's ticket, for what it's worth... Just not Trump!
this may be an unpopular opinion but kamala harris repeatedly spoke ill of joe biden and called him racist several times, so it‚Äôs really not sittin well w my spirit that agreed to run as his vp. rant over thank u
It‚Äôs a harsh assumption to insinuate I believe all her achievement is summarized by a statement on a big reason why she‚Äôs most palatable to whites among the other Black women on Biden‚Äôs list. Like Abrams, Demings, and Bass, Harris is excellent. She also checks other key boxes.
John Kasich says 'conscience' compelled him to speak at DNC, GOP is 'my vehicle but never my master'
I mean, I don't know what people expected. The nominee is Joe Biden. I was hardly expecting him to revive and nominate Che Guevara...
Yet Biden was above that attack and picked her anyway. Take a lesson!
So vote Biden/Harris, and get ready to push for the policies we really want: Medicare for all including access to abortion, free public college, abolition, etc.
"Ms. Harris, 55, is the first Black woman and the first person of Indian descent to be nominated for national office by a major party, and only the fourth woman in history to be chosen for one of their presidential tickets."  #BidenHarris2020
Angela Davis has already said that Biden is the obvious pick, because the most likely to be pressured by leftist policies. She reminded us that our power was never in the voting booth.
Biden‚Äôs strategy has been clear - distance himself from leftists so Trump can‚Äôt throw that at him. In doing so he‚Äôs tried to stake out a middle ground between the 2 parties. Problem is, I don‚Äôt think there are many voters in that space.

Wondering how  feels about this, knowing that Biden picked a cop as VP but also gets a free pizza from the best pizza spot in the world.
And just like that, my wallet opens back up to the Biden campaign.
kamala harris was the right choice at the end of the day!! very excited. Biden-Harris lets get to work!!

Every country but Russia would prefer Biden! He is not a loose cannon
Imagine being the Republican Party and actually putting out this list of Biden's spending priorities and thinking it's a bad thing...
I‚Äôm presently kind of obsessed with the idea of Biden challenging Trump to a live televised episode of Jeopardy. The spectacle would be impossible for Trump to pass up, right? Or is he actually at some level sufficiently conscious of his ignorance that he would deflect?
Not a chance, no way in hell do we ever want open borders, ICE abolished, police defunded, huge tax increases, our guns taken, The Green New Deal, and socialized single payer health insurance. A vote for Biden is a vote for insanity.
Still can't, ever, vote for Biden.
None if his ten reasons mentioned Biden. Plus, Bernie pledged to support whoever was the nominee. He is keeping his word.
2021 will be better than 2020 if Biden is elected. If not, then we are truly fucked.

It feels like a lot of people don't believe that voter suppression and/or evictions/foreclosures due to COVID will be that big of an issue. Really depressing to see people getting optimistic about Biden winning, when this is staring us right in the face.

Can‚Äôt wait for President Biden to rewrite the tax code by decree.
Look, if Trump actually believes his BS about Biden suffering from dementia, by all means let *him* challenge Biden to a live broadcast matchup on Jeopardy.
Why are talking about Biden?
I can‚Äôt wait for the debate to see Biden challenge Trump to a push up contest.
The Biden campaign really knows how to get the millenial votes: merch
Or Biden should challenge Trump to a literal chess match ‚Ä¶ or a game of scrabble ‚Ä¶ or a spelling bee ‚Ä¶ or an IQ test ‚Ä¶ or literally any other competition that would in some way objectively measure their respective brainpower.
You know, you‚Äôve got a point. I think Biden should challenge Trump to appear on ‚ÄúJeopardy‚Äù with him. Now *that* would be TV worth watching!
Accepting it and looking weak? Fair point. Either way, *asking* would seem to benefit Biden.

At this point your research on Biden seems doesn't go any further than his website. He has a history of horrific policies, votes, and hearings. The things he is purposing now are basically trying to right the wrongs of his past.

i don't like it but anyone who votes strictly with conscience and not partisanship can not possibly hand Joe Biden the nuclear football,the fact that not one Democrat has called this to Americans attention shows what Washington has became GIVE ME A CANDIDATE after Trump serves..
This is not a lie Joe Biden shows what partisan politics really is he is suffering from advancing dementia,hes being kept out of situations where he has to think on his feet,he is being supported solely because hes a democrat ,not a qualified candidate. I never like Trump before.

If Biden and Harris don't stand a chance against Trump, Trump wouldn't bother with attacking them.
she isnt African American and African Americans arnt buying this bs shes whiter inside than mike pence she never was forced to sit in the back of any bus and she lies worse than Trump Stacey was the pick! Time to vote for Trump in protest of Biden picking her!
so at the debate Kamala called Biden for what he is an old racist white man now hes a hero who can save America,,you cant pass this up!! No one could write a script for you this good!!
you called Biden for what he was at the debate and old racist white man now all of a sudden hes a hero? WE WONT FORGET COMES NOVEMBER
Biden picking you was political suicide,Stacey Abrams would have been his chance,you are NOT AFRICAN AMERICAN you wernt forced to the back of any bus and until it became politically attractive you never gave a shit about the BLM movement We see you for what you are!
Joe Biden is suffering from advanced dementia,You might as well as be as white as Pence. African Americans ant going to swallow your lily white im black lie. what you are is a hypocritical liar and we all can see that time for us to vote for Trump in protest

Well, she IS a whole lot smarter than Pence!  So you all really think there will still be debates??  I don't. Trump vs Biden, Harris vs Pence?  No. Trump and Pence will NOT be debating, they'll get their asses handed to them.
You know Biden will tank the economy in his first 100 days, right? I don't need a crystal ball to make that prediction.
Asking how Biden/Harris would have done things differently does not seem to be a great question for the GOP sycophants to ask.
Biden and Harris will appear together Wednesday at a high school in Biden‚Äôs Delaware hometown to discuss their shared vision for how to defeat President Trump.
As a conservative I pray that we stop using the attack of ‚ÄúHarris/Biden are the real law and order candidates‚Äù this will lose us the election and it shouldn‚Äôt be true. A staple of Conservatism is being pro law enforcement, and on top of that this country needs law enforcement.
Not sure how Biden read ‚Äúdefund the police‚Äù and somehow turned it into ‚Äúnominate the police‚Äù
I‚Äôll vote for Biden simply to get trump out of the White House, but god damn I will never shut the fuck up about how  was the person to pick and the  fucked that
So did the Dems pick Kamala because they thought she would pull moderates or because she‚Äôll be easy to control? Her time as AG was steeped in corruption and she outwardly accused Biden of being a racist segregationist and sexual predator. How does this work? Asking for a friend.

President Trump wasted no time attacking Sen. Kamala Harris as Joe Biden's running mate.   But in 2014, he was donating to her political campaign.

Whereas I (white dude) look at Biden wanting to pick someone for him to be what he was to Obama -- the last person in the room on decisions. And, given his age, he's picking a successor, someone who can be president on January 22nd or in 2024. And I'm excited by those reasons.

Not a big fan of Harris, but Biden picking to team up with the person who months ago hit him square in the jaw on national TV is very much on brand and in keeping with the spirit of leadership we will need these next four years.
So Biden has picked Kamala Harris!  Can't say I'm thrilled.  She is a centrist so we can forget about Medicare for All et al.
She has been a VP contender since she  endorsed Biden. Harris is the first Black woman and Asian American person on a major-party presidential ticket.

Very, very excited that  is Biden‚Äôs pick. I wanted her for the big chair, but VP will do for now.
Democratic Presidential nominee and former vice president Joe Biden has selected Senator Kamala Harris of California to be his running mate.
Biden will lose if he picks her. Hillary's "WHAT DOES IT MATTER?!?" isn't the same as flat out lying for weeks &amp; throwing a guy in jail for a bad video  She's got "unmasking" baggage too. She was one of the initial people to unmask Trump's associates names on the Russiagate stuff
You‚Äôre positive??? Has the Biden campaign reached out at all?
I honestly hope it is Susan Rice. I really wanna see Biden appoint Kamala Harris as AG, then I‚Äôll sit back with popcorn and an Old Fashion and watch her kick some corrupt republican ass! Are you listening Bill Barr?

The panel that vetted the potential VP picks has essentially disbanded, so it's now in Biden's hands, according to one report.
Taking race out of this equation it‚Äôs fair to say Biden wants a relationship like he had with Obama. That rules out some of the candidates being named.
It doesn‚Äôt matter who Biden picks for VP if he doesn‚Äôt win this year. 2024 is four years away. Get him across the finish line now then worry about grooming his Veep for the next election.

We don‚Äôt vote for the Veep in the primary, we vote for a presidential candidate. At some point if you voted for Biden in the primary you have to trust his judgment on who he selects. It is what it is. If you don‚Äôt like who he picks then vote for Trump or third party.

What was their excuse four years ago when the squad didn‚Äôt exist? They hated Hillary? Flash forward to 2020: we like Biden who is a moderate dem but oh my golly gee the squad = socialism and Biden is weak willed? Give me a break. It‚Äôs going to be an excuse every single election.
You‚Äôre ignoring the point. When has Biden ever ushered in or advocated for socialism in the United States of America? He hasn‚Äôt. He never will. He‚Äôs never promised to do so. It‚Äôs a straw man‚Äôs argument.
They literally did though. Be honest, no one here is stupid. If it wasn‚Äôt the squad it would be another excuse. They aren‚Äôt going to vote for Biden. It is what it is.
4 more years of Biden. Maybe more.
Because they can justify their vote now. Oh I was going to vote for Biden but... it‚Äôs literally an excuse. You either put country first or you don‚Äôt. This country survived four years of Trump so republicans owe Biden the benefit of the doubt. His record isn‚Äôt steeped in socialism
Ok...but the squad is only  4 out of 435 elected members of Congress. Warren is 1 out of 100. No one can seriously believe that 5 members will control Biden.
This line of thought is stupid. Your lifelong republicans don‚Äôt despise Trump. Biden isn‚Äôt controlled by the squad, he isn‚Äôt ideologically aligned with the squad and they are only four voices in Congress.
He moves so slow!  Biden is a go getter in healthy shape, thank God!

Just come out and say black men are going to cuck your wife if Biden is elected.
Didn't he just say that Biden insulted a lot of men(I use term lightly) because he was committed to choosing a woman VP? So no it would just blow up in his face as everything else does.

So, a Biden/Harris ticket eh Coach? they got as much chance as the  do to sweep the division #Steeler
Things that can all be true at the same time:  1. Biden and Harris are terrible.   2. Another 4 years of Trump would be far, far worse and more destructive.   3. If Biden/Harris win, there‚Äôs obviously still a lot of work to do.

So why did you vote for Biden in the first place?
So why vote for joe Biden is congress should have been a focus. You liberals have caught with your pants down and now you‚Äôre like it wasn‚Äôt your fault
Because it just tanked Biden‚Äôs massive lead. He‚Äôs guaranteed to Lose the house now. And it‚Äôll stagnant change for several years
Biden just said he won‚Äôt push the public option until midterms. If Biden does win, he just lost the house. I remember this one guy, he ran on single payer, won the WH, lied and oversaw the largest dem defeat since Bill Clinton in 1994. Guess who that was. Biden‚Äôs boss.
Knowing what a disaster Trump is in debates, and knowing that Biden more than held his own in a dozen Democratic primary debates.... not worried at all.

I mean you can try and wave those off but those are where facts tyically stem from. You keep saying im obsessed with trump and keep ignoring the fact i have criticized biden and other political figures multiple times. Your out of your depth
Hmnnnn did I miss something? Biden won the primaries by wide margins after first few contests.  Doesn‚Äôt that mean he reflects what more people want? Besides, the platform did incorporate points wanted by progressives that already are being used against Biden.
lmao, Biden considered this person for VP
Apparently all of the Zelienople old time church yards have been bundled into one big block so good luck, they say, pointing us in the general direction of "over yonder where something we never heard of used to be" - so we count Biden/Trump signs as we search.
Biden-Harris to highlight Trump‚Äôs failed leadership during all-virtual DNC convention
They need to give Biden the questions ahead of time
I have to agree... if we elect Joe Biden that will make Trump's statement valid. Fact checkers have to wait until Nov 4th in the least to see if this will be added to the lie pile of over twenty some thousand lies spewed by #IIC or "Ignorance In Chief".
*Replace Biden with

Arizona Republican: I'm voting Biden because 'I'm so disgusted'
President Joe Biden. Inmate Donald Trump. Pass it on.
Drove to Traverse Bay Michigan today for vacation. Lots of Trump signs.   Really can‚Äôt understand why.  I salute the few Biden ones n the midst and hope there are those without signs just laying low.  #BidenHarrisLandslide2020 #BidenHarris We need to do this!!!
Yep. I hate saying this out loud, but it‚Äôs Better for Biden to lose or civil war, is the only way.
So why again would I need to vote Biden, if the real focus is in congress.  That‚Äôs two reason now, not to vote for him. Good call.
All I can say is y'all better pray that Trump gets re-elected so you can keep this bitch fest going next yr. Biden is making y'all wear masks. Hes taking your guns, &amp; when the economy totally tanks, the last thing youll be thinking about is college football.

Joe Biden already backing off the public option lol
Reporters know what a liar you are &amp; must make sure your lies are recorded...President Elect Biden doesn't suffer from your liar disease.
In case you forgot. Joe Biden is a racist and a rapist. A vote for him means you are okay with this
Nah, Biden ducked up. He just lied about the public option
Biden just cost himself the 2022 midterms. He lied just like Obama did.
Leftist tolld you not to trust Biden.
Just in: Biden is a liar.
What would make you jump ship and vote for biden?

Yea, the best is when Trump won't accept the election results of Biden winning and has to get carried away from the White House in handcuffs.
any criticism of Biden and / or Harris is bucking party unity, but somehow it‚Äôs perfectly acceptable when it goes in the other direction
That is totally crazy, ..... it‚Äôs so bad, ..... thanks for shedding light on this, .... still voting for Biden though, soooo, you better hope he doesn‚Äôt win, because you might get üîí‚¨ÜÔ∏è!!!

I don't remember the Obama/Biden team being against more nukes, quite the opposite in fact.
The Klan in 2002 is splintered among quite a few groups, but it's approximately 10,000 members.  Which means 10,000 more than "Antifa."  Or 9,998 more than "people excited to vote for Biden."
Tell Joe Biden to start blaming trump for college football cancellations. Get them country boys upset
Why do you think being happy with a Nader vote in 2000 has any bearing on who to vote for in 2020? These are different elections. I'm a swing state voter voting for Biden now, but I lived in a blue state in 2000 and would have voted Nader. Different times, different world.
Yes and no. The majority of black boomers went off Biden. Not the younger generation. Boomers came out in droves. Bernie couldn‚Äôt get to them because they watch MSNBC 24/7.
Every other house in my neighborhood has trump sign and not a single biden sign. You can be the first and watch it takeover like I did!
Just the beginning.  Obama and Biden are next.
Do you believe everything bad your hear or read about we Republicans?  If not, then what do you think about all of the hurtful lies being spread about us? We Republicans are not the enemy. Also, why does Biden not to debate Trump? Are you serious about supporting Biden? LOL!
Yeah im obessesser with the wellbeing of my country, ive criticized biden plenty too you can search that. None of these points are relevant at all. Also nice strawman
Damn, Trump sure is in your head.  What do you think Biden is going to do, that he hasn‚Äôt figured out the last 47 years In office ? Trump got rich on his own.  Biden got rich raping taxpayers.. keep chirping , dumbasses!#4moreyears!

Well, Biden is not a president. Yet. So he has nothing to respond to except for his plans. Trump, however, killed on two fronts: the economy is almost dead and 170,000 Americans are dead from #TrumpVirus
Damn, Trump sure is in your head.  What do you think Biden is going to do, that he hasn‚Äôt figured out the last 47 years In office ? Trump got rich on his own.  Biden got rich raping taxpayers.. keep chirping , dumbasses!#4moreyears!

Raise your hand if you smoked too much weed when you were a young teenage girl and actually believe that Joe Biden will be President of the United States!
Worst part, majority Black people (with Notable Exceptions) really will just vote straight D. Biden could have picked a Brown skin  blow up doll and it still wouldn't matter.
Pull a 'Kavanaugh' and just cry a Biden win will send you to prison for tax fraud.
Don't you just love it when racists like Trump and family try to pretend they're not.
Kamala, do you still believe the Biden accusers?
Here is some unsolicited advice to the Biden team,  keep it simple, keep asking the people why would you vote for a person who would lie, cheat and steal an election for his own personal gain.  Forget that crap about Trump  calling names, ignore him.
Call Trump whatever you won‚Äôt. A corrupt pathological liar, a hypocrite, a racist, a warmonger, a sexual predators We don‚Äôt care. Just know that Biden is all of those things to.
There's no way Biden wins a legitimate election.  They are gonna need voter fraud for at least 40-50%.
Don‚Äôt worry  once biden takes office he‚Äôll shed light on Barr and trumps criminal activities when they‚Äôre pranced out in front of congress and senate committees, LED BY THE DEMS IN THE MAJORITY OF BOTH HOUSES!
Them why does Biden's lead keep getting bigger?
Please let this happen. With everything going on in the country please let Biden run on saving the Post Office.
It's probably a slice of pizza because Biden thinks Obama is part Italian üòÉ
We all know that it's Obvious he never liked Obama &amp; we DEFINITELY know that Biden &amp; Harris are NO way friends!!
Biden seizes on Trump's attack on Social Security and Medicare, while team Trump panics  So maybe you won‚Äôt be getting any mail, but don‚Äôt worry it‚Äôs not like you would be getting any social security checks anyway, we cut them too.
You bet Russia wants Biden too. The lying media still have to pretend Russia prefers Trump
Volant farmer to speak at Democratic convention on why he's switching to Biden | Pittsburgh Post-Gazette
The main reason he‚Äôs holding these press conferences is to accentuate the fact that Joe Biden isn‚Äôt.
I don't want Biden to be president either.   I think Trump supporters are generally shittier people than Biden supporters, but in November, the only winners are corporate America.
Well that's how I feel about Biden.
You‚Äôre tweeting this because YOU know Biden will win. Otherwise, you‚Äôd be beating your orange chest about your poll numbers right now. üòÇüòÇüòÇ
Volant, Pennsylvania farmer to speak at Democratic convention on why he's switching to Biden  via
Luckily for me, you're not the arbiter of who wins/loses. So I'll ask you one more time: did Joe Biden ever say he wouldn't debate trump? Yes or no. PS- At this point, anything other than a yes or no answer will simply confirm what you, me, and anyone reading this already knows.
Those reporters are so rude and disrespectful towards President Trump. Funny how none of them have the balls to stand up to Biden's STAFFER who keeps throwing them out of his press conferences without letting them ask questions. It's enough to piss you off
All while you have pedophile bill Clinton  speaking at the DNC. You have sexual predator Biden as the nominee. And your party is censoring outspoken WOC who don‚Äôt agree with you politically.  should have abandoned the party right than and there
He tried to change the debate format so when they refuse, he can say it's a leftist conspiracy or some nonsense and bail.  Here's his problem: he pushed the "Biden's got dementia" bit so hard, so what happens if Biden curb-stomps him in the debate? Game over. That's what happens.
Major US postal workers union endorses Biden for president
You're so ignorant to the facts surrounding all of the bullshit since the impeachment hearings.  All of this was just a coincidence I guess....lol.  You and your friends live in a make believe world.  Especially if you think Biden and Harris are the answer.  Write a song about it
And oh yea, biden got y'all , the pressure to pick a black women as his VP, he picked a indian american one, but then again y'all call her black even though she's never claimed it untill it benefits her politically, i tell u my ppl suffer from the lack of common sense!
Dont worry your communist party endorsed Biden
Now do Biden.
I‚Äôd rather vote for a rock than Trump, so of course I‚Äôm voting for Biden, but these Biden texts I get everyday are a little much and I have no idea how to unsubscribe....
Let me make this so easy, even a caveman could do it: Did Joe Biden say he wasn't going to debate? Yes or no.
Pretty simple - under Trump, unemployment numbers (pre-Covid) were lowest in YEARS!  Particularly for minorities.  Economy better under Trump....so what's Biden/Harris going to do for us?
Not near as bad as Obama did : not near as bad as Biden would have.

I'll be voting no matter what. For Biden. Fuck Trump and anyone who stands with him.
Oh don't worry, I'll be voting no matter what. For Biden!
Biden was onboard for ACA, imperfect by a start in the right direction. Yes, Biden wants to win. The question is why would you want four more years of Trump?
So I see that 'President Joe' and 'Biden/Harris landslide' is trending in the fake reality that is Twitter right now. Sounds completely organic right

Joe Biden has never had any issues (that I‚Äôm aware of) with corruption, unlike the GOP and occupant of the WH. I really couldn‚Äôt care less about your allegations. Nov 3 is coming a$$hole.
Biden has been attacked for his mental capacities, his age, his support of police and has had a sexual assault allegation against him, and yet, he was somehow a better choice than Bernie? Wow, the priorities.
Kinda funny when you think about it, 4 years ago Obama was not on board with Biden.
I really want to see someone ask her if she still believes the Biden accusers.
It's time to bring Joe &amp; Hunter Biden in before the Senate for questioning along w/Obama, who had to have approved of this along w/Kerry, who was SOS. But it goes further than this, Soros had ties to Businesses involved in the Corruption. Money was used to fund illegal activity!
I see Biden‚Äôs taking a page from the Tubby Trump playbook...
This economy is still better than Obama's and Biden's highest point and still in recovery. Imagine that
#Biden is trying to get a #job but refuses to answer questions or meet his new bosses!  #CNN #MSNBC       #Millennials #FoxNews
Hate how many people are like ‚Äúeasy Biden win‚Äù and have hashtags like #BidenHarrisLandslide2020 . Because those same things were said 4 years ago and look what happened. Hoping the left and liberals don‚Äôt get complacent
TBH, I don‚Äôt even care if it is true. More trump is not acceptable under any circumstances. It‚Äôs imperative that we all vote for Biden. End of story.
They will likely vote for the Biden/Harris tickets in droves, proud of Kamala for being the first of their own to break the glass ceiling for the 2nd highest office in the land, Fredo. At least you tried...
Biden wants to ride a time machine back to 2008.
Clearwater, FLA - over 1100 boaters!   So many rallies for Trump.  So much energy #MAGA2020.   and then there was this boat rally for Biden.
They are anarchists and democrats that are still upset from 2016. Antifa and BLMs website directs you to Biden‚Äôs campaign site. It‚Äôs all optician bullshit. It‚Äôs not about race anymore.
oh girl, don‚Äôt know wat im gonna do with you
The point is that it is inaccurate to say she called Biden a racist.  You can say you think she implied it (I disagree... I think she implied he was ignorant that what he was doing could be perceived as racist).... but you can't say she called him a racist.   That's a lie.
Wall Street loves Trumpolini back in 2016... now, they love Biden, who promised them that ‚Äúnothing will fundamentally change‚Äù.  Says about all I need to fucking know about Biden.
I love this, because eating undercooked chicken can fucking kill you, so yes, it‚Äôs still a pertinent question.  It leads one to question why they‚Äôre given such shitty choices in the first place, which is the question that needs asked right now.  Biden is shit on climate FYI.
The fact that Biden is trying to take credit for it shows just how delusional he is!!!
‚ÄúHe‚Äôs a hell of a salesman,‚Äù said Lawrence County farmer Rick Telesz, who voted for President Trump in 2016 ‚Äî but plans on switching to Joe Biden in 2020.  ‚ÄúAnd a tremendous con man,‚Äù he added. ‚ÄúHe conned me.‚Äù
I'll answer that with complete candor and honesty as soon as you take off the "if" and simply acknowledge that neither Joe Biden nor his staff have ever said or suggested that he wouldn't debate. Deal?

Newly elected President Biden should appoint Prosecutor Glenn Kischner to lead a team of prosecutorial investigators to bring all these criminals to justice! That includes Trump AND Barr!
Bill Kristol is a neoconservative who supports Biden. Makes sense. Trump hasn't started any new wars like Obama/Biden who like Kristol support regime change by military force. Lybia, Syria, etc. Dems and Reps should have mother's of dead Middle Eastern civilians speak.
I knocked the lies out of your tweet. You're welcome!!!  Kamala Harris and Joe Biden are in lockstep when it comes to the fair agenda for Americans   BOTH: -Have backed the $93 trillion Green New Deal (creating millions of jobs)  -Have vowed to raise income taxes on the 1%
You mean Biden and Harris getting rid of carbon emissions sounds like a lot of Americans will be losing their jobs, your just a left wing puppet your bad for pa.

I‚Äôm sure Elizabeth Warren will do what is best for our country and where she can do the most good. I cannot see her undermining the democratic party in anyway. She is a woman of morals and strength. I do hope she remains a trusted advisor to our future President Biden.
Trump is the president. He is much more a threat than the Dems. Winning another 4 years sets back the progressive movement decades. Idc if one doesn‚Äôt want to vote for Biden, but that‚Äôs ridiculous.

You'll have the right to protest when Biden wins just like most people are doing right now.
I have always loved in a violent neighborhood. Under Obama/Biden he started to clean up my neighborhood and others.  But under pres. dickhead it increase along with unemployment, taxes, and an increase in rasist pigs

I've been saying it for months. The demented pedo is a placeholder. Anyone wanna bet? Seriously. If Biden is ever sworn in as president I will bet anyone anything they want against that. Anybody want any of it??? Don't be like Taber, bet more than a buck!!!
Hi I'm Joe Biden i picked a black female running mate to play the black population into voting for me! And they give me a pass as a racist (Biden thinking out loud)
So it‚Äôs ok that democrats do it ? Because republicans do it more? WTF, this is the same excuse about Biden. He‚Äôs racist, but trump is more racist. Biden‚Äôs a rapist, but trump raped more people. Biden‚Äôs corrupt, but trump is more corrupt.  Fbvk democrats and fvck the liberals
Biden has more in supplemental income coming from China and money laundering "investments". Hes made a life for himself over 50 years already on taxpayer funded salary.

1-2 that's it and I've been to a predominately black neighborhoods and seen more Trump signs in those places than Biden!! Fact!!
The little weasel will be voting for Biden.
Trump is delusional.  I‚Äôm voting Biden Harris!!!
So white moderate. Obama and Biden were fascist pigs who cared for the corporations.  And what you‚Äôre saying right now, vote and shit up just shows how fascist the democrats really are.
I love all of this ‚Äúyou won‚Äôt be safe in Biden‚Äôs America‚Äù nonsense when in Trump‚Äôs America I‚Äôm not even safe to go to a theater and watch a movie.
So when you cover Biden and expose his lies we will believe you! Start with how he claimed he went to law school on a full scholarship, top of class, go to plagiarism, ask him how come he‚Äôs on tape using the n-word, how many crime bills he‚Äôs signed start with these they are easy
And this one will never shut up either! Haha Have mouth will speak. üòÅ
#BREAKING NEWS: President Donald Trump will visit Old Forge, Pennsylvania on Thursday to speak just a few hours ahead of Joe Biden accepting the nomination as the Democratic presidential candidate, according to reports.
Heard the same thing. Stop voter shaming. Be gone fascist.  Is Ryan running for president? Biden has to earn votes, he‚Äôs not entitled and how dare you say otherwise
I‚Äôm ok with Kasich though. If he can bring some republican voters to vote for Biden we‚Äôre better off.
They have to make it seem close or Biden winning by a lot so when they steal the election through mail in ballot fraud it won't look so bad.
So you won‚Äôt be voting for Biden then, either?
LOL if Biden wins by fewer than 25 I‚Äôll eat a shoe
If democrats succeed in mail-in voting the election will be stolen from Trump. People must vote in person or American will be one big Portland. Your homes stolen, kids molested, wife raped, mom killed, dad attacked, pets killed, and money stolen. This is a biden presidency
Oooooooohhh! How cute!
Out of curiosity, how are these postal workers going to know which ballots are "Trump" ballots and which are "Biden" ballots?  I'm pretty sure that any tampered ballot is voided.  It's not like they can filter them out.
So much gaslighting, so many that believe it. Yes, the USPS is under attack. Yes, Kamala Harris is valid to run for VP &amp; POTUS. Biden wants to save citizens and end the pandemic in the USA. It is not political. If you believe it to be fake your gaslighted
Sucks having to worry every day about what the president did or said. Can‚Äôt wait for Biden/Harris to take over.
I‚Äôll agree the virus is terrible but hey if you don‚Äôt want to have a conversation that‚Äôs fine just go vote Biden (he has early onset dimentia) which truly is sad and I will vote Trump and whoever wins wins but please don‚Äôt assume I‚Äôm some cold person because of my political views

Well isnt this a bunch of bullshit fear mongering propaganda.   I will vote Biden/ Harris to get this murderous rapist grifting con man out of the White House.
Cw election  . . . . . I mean, obviously Biden/Harris are very bad, Tr*mp is undeniably evil, yelling at people &amp; emotionally abusing them  about voting for the "lesser" assholes is shitty. Where do we go next? What's the actual plan of action? I feel very helpless lately.

A Biden trump debate would be a wonderful thing...
I‚Äôll be voting trump and hoping lightfoot, cuomo, polis, biden , pelosi &amp; Harris are never heard from again after this year, so that the country stops burning to the ground under the left because they are still mad trump won.
Yeah..this election is gonna be crazy. If Biden wins, the right will claim mail in voter fraud. If Trump wins, the left will claim voter suppression and Russians.. Got my popcorn readyüòÇ
Yeah but is it MORE revealing that all of the Trump dealings, money laundering and corruption put together? Or does it just *look* bad? Hunter Biden Sins : ‚Äî Trump family crimes: ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî- ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî See the difference? We do.
Plus we have our "Hate has no home here" AND Biden signs right out front!
Never said Biden is a good choice, he's just better than trump imo. Good luck this fall
Recognizing we have a faulty system doesn't excuse not voting.  Yes, we should abolish the electoral college, but we have it now in the year 2020 - - so if we want the fascist Trump out we need to vote for Biden. That's the highest priority this year.
Biden and Harris will force us to throw away milk that is past its due date. I can't take it.
I‚Äôm ridin with Biden!  #BidenHarrisLandslide2020
I do too!!  And you are correct! Ive seen one Biden sign. Yards and businesses loaded with Trump signs!

Molly, you are the most over emotional person I know. Calm down. Biden will still win.
Because Biden has repeatedly confirmed he's going to the debates, and trump has previously stated that he may skip the debates and is now trying to change the format.
Until then, Biden need to win. Lawfully, but otherwise as necessary, to win.
Why?  As a practical matter Biden is old; if he dies or becomes incapacitated it goes to the VP. Must every understudy believe they are less suited than the main actor in the role?  Should qualified people not render any public service if they dislike anything about the POTUS?
Joe Biden,  President of the United States.
Biden's campaign are forbidden from downloading TikTok on their phones. You might want to ask them why they did this.
Thank you Senator Warren . Biden can be sure that if you are in his cabinet the greedy wealthy evildoers will see Justice!
Trump supports saying that Biden "is  creepy and had assaulted girls" like Trump isn't involved in the biggest child molestation ring and had a man killed who was going to expose him
President Biden &amp; Vice President Harris are gonna have a lot to fix starting immediately. We are witnessing the intentional destruction of the Postal Service. We have witnessed #Trump destroy our relationships with our allies &amp; embolden our enemies.  #BidenHarris2020
Actually based on crime bills passed and convictions as an attorney general,  Biden and Harris are the Law and Order party. Three strikes and you're out. Locking up minorities for victimless crimes like drug addiction.
So they send Maxine out to take the heat. Ainthis some mess...  Biden already said his crime bill had nothing to do with mass incarceration because he's an ASSüòí. So how can she make this statement
I wish ppl understood Biden‚Äôs stutter better. Its hard growing up when ppl think you‚Äôre stupid because something you can‚Äôt help and they don‚Äôt understand. I couldn‚Äôt read until 3rd/4th grade and wasn‚Äôt allowed to take classes with my friends until 8th. It was awful. Poor Joe.
This makes me like Biden more and the Pod Save America guys less.
I only know people in their 70‚Äôs that actually like Biden. Everyone else is for anything but the cheeto.
Also, just imagine the people who have to work that day. You want them to loose out on money so they can vote for lame ass joe Biden? Plenty of people will pass on that.
Let's try again: what debate did Biden cancel? And be REAL careful with your answer.
What debate did Biden cancel?
Obama, I mean Biden‚Äôs pick for VP, couldn‚Äôt be any worse, unless he selected Stacy Abrams!
Already addressed that. But sure- I'll address the "facts". Just show me where in those 2 articles you posted tat Joe Biden or his staff said he wouldn't debate. Because that, and ONLY that, is what we're discussing.
Letter to the Editor: A Unity man says President Trump should change his nickname for Joe Biden from ‚ÄúSleepy Joe‚Äù to ‚ÄúHidin‚Äô Biden.‚Äù
As I recall, Kamala assassinated Joe Biden‚Äôs character during that debate, so now she wants us to believe it was all a big joke &amp; a pack of lies?  Sorry Kamala, your attempt to revise history is unacceptable!  #Trump2020
Now if Biden makes sure that Warren is in his cabinet we can be certain that Citizens United and the malecious billionaires will get their well earned just desserts !
I know, I wasn‚Äôt saying I liked these approach or that it would work, but it‚Äôs fucking insane that instead of at least trying to find common ground with leftists, they just shame us &amp; gaslight us with bullshit like ‚ÄúJoe Biden actually has the most progressive platform in history‚Äù
Is India upset at the Trump administration for eliminating or cutting what they can charge Americans for Indian manufactured drugs? Whoever can‚Äôt see India interfering in this next election is smoking Biden‚Äôs stash. The setup is obvious and Kamal is the perfect deception.
If Dems were smart: Look, I know Biden/Harris isn‚Äôt great, but we have to stop Trump from consolidating too much power in the executive &amp; get back to political accountability and international cooperation.   Dems, since they‚Äôre not smart: STOP BEING CRYBABY, ORANGE MAN BAD!
The question is do we want our country to become what Portland and Chicago and New York have already become? The truth is the stupid answer would be to vote Biden
Whoever believed Kamal Harris isn‚Äôt a lying dog face pony soldier also believes Osama BinLaden was dumped at sea &amp;all the crew who witnessed the event somehow all miraculously disappeared Or you are probably smoking the same pipe Biden smokes. #defundAI #defundpredictiveprofiling
Nah just another arsonist and looter with a gun his vote was gonna be for Biden or Kanye one way or another.
That's actually what trump and Biden have told me. You can keep your CNN, FOX, OAN, etc...
Lmao they‚Äôre already doing it again with this Biden Harris Landslide shit? How‚Äôd that work out in 2016 for the Democrats? Did I miss something
Biden told them
Agreed. Biden is a known commodity. There is documentation available showing his support for both sides of any issue. It‚Äôs not unreasonable to expect the top of the ticket to answer questions disclosing this year‚Äôs positions.

Please enlighten us to their actions! And don‚Äôt tell me he‚Äôs racist because the only person who is on tape using the n- word is Biden, Lying Biden lies too! Plagiarism - Biden had to drop out of 1988 race for that, foreign policy has been wrong every time! I can back it up you?
Devils avocado- if Biden wins, the revolution could still take years, if Trump wins it would probably be started on election night.   Please don't argue with me I'm very tired and this is not a position I will stand by once I've had coffee.

Biden and Harris need to be asked point blank ‚ÄúDo people who own private property have the right to defend it‚Äù
Yep first thing biden will do if he gets into office .. or shall I say the puppet masters will do is make deals with China .. oh and im sure he will cozy right up with WHO and pay them some $$ while he‚Äôs at it, again won‚Äôt be joe biden running things though, his mind is GONE
Perhaps people should read the article before replying... He wants medicare for all included in the platform. Says he will do everything he can to support Biden/Harris. This is exactly how misinformation happens. READ the articleü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
We keep our eyes on the prize.  We are electing JOE BIDEN.#AMJoy
Maybe you need to research who actual runs this group and their connections to past administrations. And you tell me again how they aren‚Äôt going to have influence over biden. After spending millions to help him.
President Trump on Friday told hundreds of New York Police Department officers that ‚Äúno one will be safe in Biden‚Äôs America‚Äù if the former Democratic vice president defeats him in November .
Another reason could be to ensure that the integrity of the election process exists in 4 years for progressives to have a path towards nomination.  I don‚Äôt think Biden is running on dismantling democracy, but may have missed something.
My dad's friend is complaining about capitalism and in my head I'm just like... You voted Biden in the primary.. uh
Holy shit you are going to be so surprised when nothing fucking changes under biden.  Scratch that- he ain't winning so it doesn't matter. It also literally doesn't matter. They don't matter.  Honestly, Trump probably matters the most because of this. You can't turn his shit off
I keep getting requests from trump campaigns for money to support trump I mail back F**k you! And stop asking me for money for some one who's says they don't need my money! I'm voting Biden/Harris and Blur all the way!
Sure. Democrats want to weaken confidence in an election they seem likely to win. I know, I know, it's only those fraudulent mail-in polls that show Biden leading.

It is not going to happen. Biden is not even speaking on his own behalf at the DNC convention. There is a strategic reason for that needless to say.
This is why Biden needs to win by a HUGE margin. VOTE VOTE VOTE!!!!
Or... she's just being pragmatic and recognizes that the president will be either Trump or Biden, and Trump's history of sexual misconduct is worse. Clearly Biden wasn't her first choice.
Because Obama new Biden was a bad idea and yet he‚Äôs risking his legacy to get Biden elected.  Hillary lost, was Biden‚Äôs Secretary of State. Joe Biden was Obamas vice president. If Joe Biden loses anybody who is attached to the Obama administration will be seen as an unelectable
But the leader of the communist party endorsed Biden!!!! lol
You mean like she would have been under Obama/Biden
If Biden gets elected Democrats they'll get what they deserve they'll have nothing at all not even America as we known it
He‚Äôs running a campaign to scare voters about Biden while he‚Äôs presided over 165,000 deaths, an out of control pandemic, protests/riots in every major city, and an economy that is hemorrhaging jobs.  But when you only know how to play one card I guess you play it ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Obama legacy has put a Stan on people. When Hillary lost, I thought it would fade. But Biden has to lose and anyone seen attached to his administration will be seen as unelectable and his sway won‚Äôt mean shit.
Actually it's the Dems that know Biden can't win unless they cheat. That's why we want to make it harder to cheat. That is what's obvious.
China may want Biden to win, but Russia actively helped you and is continuing to help you to win. The False equivalence of a countries preferred candidate and Active Measures being employed is ridiculous. That‚Äôs why trump won‚Äôt say anything negative about Russia. #TraitorTrump
Why is every article all of a sudden about Black women? What about Black men's hair or rates of hiring them even with a nice haircut?  I dont trust all this media attention, and I'm still not voting for Bidenüëãüèæ #ADOS #STAYFOCUSED
Joe Biden is a corrupt pathological liar. A hypocrite. A Racist. A sexual predator. A war warmonger.  MA dems cape out as homophobic. Yeah let the Dems die. Anyone who continues to support the Democratic Party is a hypocrite.
You understand that the voters don‚Äôt make policy. If that was the case. The DNC would be pro-M4A and pro-legal weed. And it‚Äôs the opposite. The Lincoln project are party elites spending millions to help biden. Are you seriously this stupid, thinking they won‚Äôt have more influence
But as Joe Biden pointed out, according to Democrats being Black doesnt make you Black - only voting Democrat makes you Black.
SAME old photo &amp; post. After how many years in public for Joe Biden.  YAWN you know if there was something to this, the name calling first grader would be twittering his tiny little trump fingers out right off. But crickets from resident trump because NOTHING HERE on Biden.
If Biden also eats well-done steak slathered with ketchup, well America, we had a good run.
You are right. November 3rd when we vote Biden/ Harris into office and Trump can start packing for jail.
You are correct! November 3rd we will be holding Trump accountable and voting for Biden/ Harris.  Then Trump can pack his bags for prison.
This is gonna be a crazy one. If Trump wins, left will claim voter suppression; If Biden wins, right will claim vote by mail fraud... Gonna get my popcorn ready

Nice but get to the well known criminals Comey, Obama, Rice, Brennan, Biden etc
I've used to ask my 93-year-old aunt in the nursing home a lot of questions.  Her answers were much like Biden's.  I finally gave up.  We just stick to simple conversations like roaches, hairy legs, and kids on her lap. It's easier this way.
All Biden supporters, get out and vote. We need to remove this stain on the WH promptly.
To the fracker on the anti-Biden commercial. You need to get out and meet more people. When you say ‚Äúgive me a break‚Äú I wish I could break you off a piece of that  Kit Kat bar.
But the leader of the communist party endorsed Biden!!!! lol
#M4A, and Biden hates it. He's so dense; he could say he supports it, generate all this enthusiasm, and then do nothing to pass it if elected. That's the Barack Obama playbook.
Are we attacking the stupidity of families now? Ok, got one. Hunter Biden is a drug addict who used his daddy‚Äôs connection to get out of jail not once but twice. Got position boards abroad for jobs he clearly wasn‚Äôt qualified for. Fathered childen he doesn‚Äôt support
Is Biden‚Äôs racism ok?
China supports Biden. So I‚Äôll vote for the party not influenced by dictators. Thanks.

I know people who will sit out from disgust. Who will vote Howie Hawkins for principal knowing he won't win but hoping he will reach 5% to get funding for next time. Finally I know people voting Biden because removing Trump matters to them due to being persecuted by his policies.
Got it from trump. He threatened to boycott the debates. Now he's trying to change them. If they refuse he can skip the debates, saying it's not his fault. He pushed the "dementia" narrative hard. Now he realizes how it will look when Biden trounces him in the first 5 minutes.

If Russia is helping trump. China is helping Biden.  I‚Äôll support the party not controlled by a foreign power
Could you imagine this place if Biden was 20 years younger?

You go ahead and you get Covid and you‚Äôll love how  biden doesn‚Äôt support M4A.
So go vote for Fascism! Biden/Harris are not socialists. I think you ought to stop FOLLOWING Resisters since you have this deranged view. Maybe you've been a trumper all along and decided recently to try to create doubt - chaos but it won't!
Since trump is doing everything he can to avoid debating Biden, i highly doubt he's gonna let Jehovah's android tangle with Kamala.

You‚Äôve got to see it through both lenses.
Trump wins by cheating. Why do you think he is attacking mail in voting&amp; the Postal Service. Is Biden a perfect candidate...nope....but I would at least trust him with my country. Trump is very clearly trying to destroy it. So vote for democracy......not evil. It's that simple.
If it takes care of fools like you yes.

‚ÄúRecall how Gov. Ed Rendell rolled out the red carpet to the frackers. Recall how the Pennsylvania Democratic Party derailed Joe Sestak‚Äôs campaign for nomination to run for U.S. senator in 2016. This was likely due to Sestak‚Äôs call for a ban on fracking.‚Äù
Same time pedo Bill Clinton and sexual predator Biden.  But they‚Äôve gotten away with for decades. So I‚Äôll assume trump will too. Go figure.
Joe Biden had a committee he worked with. You‚Äôre being racist suggesting Obama picked a black women. But that‚Äôs not surprising coming from  a supporter of xenophobic narcissistic resident of the WH.
Honestly hes right. Even Stalin looks like a lib compared to Biden.
"Donald Trump was the national leader of the grotesque, racist birther movement with respect to President Obama and has sought to fuel racism and tear our nation apart on every single day of his presidency," said Andrew Bates, a spokesman for the Biden campaign.
She looks dirty and evil.  People who know her don't like her.  She screwed her way to where she is today.  She probably gave Biden a BJ.

Question Kamala, do you STILL believe the Biden accusers?
I dont endorse Kamala's past, but I will vote for her in November as well as encourage other people to do so in order that we can change America and the Earth's future. At least Biden and Harris acknowledge climate change is real and that's a start.
Do it. Agent orange is being a fascist, &amp; yes, biden‚Äôs a neolib nothing, but please can we save a little something please?
At least we know that Biden didn't pay someone to take his SATs like Trump.
I believe most women.  Reade's allegation about Biden changed significantly since she first came forward in 2019 that Biden made her uncomfortable by touching her neck, shoulders and hair. 2020 she said he also assaulted her by forcibly putting his fingers inside of her...

Trump‚Äôs War On Mail Backfires As Postal Workers Union Endorses Biden  via
I live in the rust belt. Biden is going for votes from blue color workers, which voted Trump last time, by bashing China in recent TV ads. Dems are big media and coastal elites these days. There's lots of talk about what fascism is in this thread so why vote this time?
I don‚Äôt understand how you chase after these Biden conspiracy theories when these things about trump are literally in front of your face.
Geezus. No good reason for this. So obvious GOP is looking to suppress Dem votes there. B4 Trump was elected (and after) he and his followers used to cry out ‚Äúlock her up‚Äù. I think once Biden wins, we need to lock TRUMP up! (And a WHOLE LOT MORE of his administration)
No matter how you vote, either Biden or Trump will win. So if you want your vote to matter, pick which of the 2 you think will do less damage.  Trump has devastated America. I'm willing to give another administration a chance to prove itself better or also be a disappointment.
Does anyone think there's even a chance that Biden will be viewed as a better president than Obama was by themselves, the 2024 Democratic primary electorate, or the public at large?  Even the people who claim to be excited about him?
Many neoconservatives prefer Biden. Trump hasnt started any new wars. Obama/Biden supported regime change; Lybia, Syria,etc. Sent home more undocumented immigrants than any other administration. Dems take the most money from police unions. New VP pro police. Trump fascist? Biden?
Trump will escalate his lies that Obama and Biden are criminals. His followers will believe him. Those who oppose him will not. The apathetic masses in the middle will simply not vote, saying that both sides are corrupt. Low voter turnout will benefit Trump. Vote!
I try not to remember the shit you said because it‚Äôs not worth taking up any space. Senseless blather. I‚Äôd rather use it to watch republican Porn - Fox.... oh no I won‚Äôt watch that.  And it‚Äôs not kiddie porn so I am clearly not a Republican.
Let‚Äôs play a match game!   Can yo u match these goals for socialism with the Biden/Harris campaign platform below?   Looks like a perfect correlation !

You sit there and talk about the environment saying how Biden will be better and yet when he was VP it still got worse. So......no different than trump. Actions speak louder than words.
Bill you know it's the Harris-Biden ticket in reality......
A. Hillary's lead was never as big as Biden's current lead.  B. Trump wasn't an incumbent with a record.  He was the "change agent".  This time, he's the opposite.  C. Hillary was hated by a large percentage of the population.  Biden isn't.
And you‚Äôll still vote for the next centrist. Hard pass. I‚Äôd rather fight trump for 4 more years than beg from biden

I am happy. Especially when I can watch a MAGAT get eviscersted by   I may have a Napoleon Complex (I don‚Äôt) but what do you call the syndrome where a bowling ball sits on that tiny twig of a neck?
I don‚Äôt know how to reach Trump supporters, since at this point I feel like they LIKE the fascism.  I don‚Äôt believe the current democrats will be able to prevent it again either, especially since Biden wants to return to the immediately preceding status quo
If you think Biden is fat left, you need a serious lesson in political theory.  He‚Äôs a centrist Republican.  Just like Obama was.  More in line with Ron Reagan than actually leftists.
Dr. Biden, is it possible the Congress can get FEDEX and UPS to accept mail-in ballots?
That ‚Äúfaceless‚Äù coward will chew your ass up and spit you out.  Significantly more well versed than I. The education will be much better. Meanwhile is that a pic of you in the profile?  I know it‚Äôs been manipulated to make yourself more attractive.....
‚ÄúNothing will fundamentally change‚Äù says the old white man who picked a transphobic cop at a time of trans rights and protests against cops.   Biden supporters = trump supporters
#Reparations A city council member egged them on. Harris/Biden will allow this madness to spread nationwide.  Activists Storm Neighborhood, Tell White Residents To ‚ÄòGive Black People Back Their Homes‚Äô
That's it, I'm convinced. I'm voting for Hillary, err I mean Kamala, oh wait Biden is still first on the ticket? - no one ever
It‚Äôll be sooner than two years if Biden wins, as there is no other way he will have been able to win without The Deep State and satanistic pedophiles working for him
Jill Biden?
Probably the bravest thing I have done in 2020 was putting a Biden bumper sticker on my car and then driving around Greensburg
Like u can support but uh maybe ,,,, criticize her track record. Theres a reason biden who wont defund police and hates universal health care chose her. It wasnt to have a contradicting voice
The take that Biden picking Harris was the obvious, safe move is lazy &amp; wrong.   Consider the recent Dem VP nominees: Gore, Lieberman, Edwards, Biden, Kaine. All to the right of the Pres candidate ideologically.   Harris is well to the left of Biden. I appreciate the gamble.
Geraldo, Trump knows she is running for VP but in reality she is running for President. Biden doesn‚Äôt even know when his nose is running. #TrusttheForce Geraldo
Drop some science Joe..... we will wait. ü§£ü§£
Can anyone tell me: What did Biden do to help the USPS the 40+ years he has been in politics?
But they endorsed Biden so...
‚ÄúVote them in, then hold them accountable‚Äù  Excuse me? We can‚Äôt hold Trump accountable for ANYTHING. Biden and Harris will absolutely brush aside any criticism thrown their way, as they currently do now. I‚Äôm tired of their supporters lying to us about how things are gonna go down
Very few. I see more Bernie signs than Biden signs.
Vote for Biden.
How many convictions?  And why don‚Äôt you mention Joe Biden‚Äôs accuser?
Few people will vote for Biden/Kamala. Look at their presidential runs before Obama rigged it.  They want Trump to win because he is an idiot that will go balls to the wall for billionaires &amp; he doesnt care how unpopular he is.    If he knew history, he would be more fearful.
Clinesmith will drag this out until the election. If Biden wins, he'll give nothing and will be pardoned. If Trump wins, he'll sing like a bird.  It's that simple. Here's hoping for more than this in the near future.
Hoping for more but expecting something like this.  AG Barr doesn't come from the school of under-selling to exceed expectations.  I guess we take him at his word. BTW Clinesmith isn't going to say a word. He's banking on Biden winning then walking away.
'NYT' columnist says Biden won't be a 'troublemaker'-- when Israel needs to kill Palestinian children
I don‚Äôt know. My older sister claims if Biden wins she‚Äôs going to have to keep working. And she doesn‚Äôt know ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs going to happen to this country- look at Chicago!‚Äù   Under Trump she so getting a raise(she‚Äôs referring to eliminating the payroll deductions). She‚Äôll also be 62.
Ok just randomly clicked past  where I hear Chuckles gleefully saying how Ron Johnson is exposing Biden. What the actual fuck?
Biden has the widest lead in any election since 1996.  And the widest lead in any election by a non-incumbent since Reagan in 1980.  He has "locked it up"...as long as we have a free and fair election.  But since Trump is going to cheat, that's why it isn't "locked up" for sure.
If all Biden can muster is a public option instead of #MedicareForAll, voters would at least reward him for making it as big and bold as possible: - No deductible - Medicare billing rates - Auto-enroll uninsured Read more in our new  polling:
It's not spin. Trump has helped  private prisons, and those same entities financially back Trump. If Biden is elected, he'll have a difficult time if he intends to combat any deals the Trump Administration has already made.
Joe Biden started the vice presidential selection process by putting himself in a box. He pandered. He said he would pick a woman.  He did not say: I will pick the most-qualified person I can find. And if that person is a woman, great.  Via
and again was this asshole you worship quoting Joe Biden Trump falsely claims 1918 flu pandemic ended WWII... it started in 1939  via
And Biden did not have the appetite to run after the death of his son. His heart was not in it in 2016
That's because Trump didn't come out months in advance and say. I'm picking a white male to be my VP. Biden came out and said he was picking a woman, no matter what.
I second that. Pirro threatened Biden. That threat needs to be investigated.
You‚Äôre voting Biden/Harris right  ?
Not that they'd even challenge them or ask any snarky questions, imagine Joe Biden just answering a question...about anything.
I will believe it when I see it. I am still hopeful. You are right if Biden wins, it all goes away.
Hahahahaha. It‚Äôs so convenient to do it during a pandemic in an election year where people with functioning brains want a mail in option.  Only a true dolt would still endorse Trump.  I would vote for a ham sandwich over that idiot.  I‚Äôm holding my nose and voting Biden.
all I see is WHITE VANDALS burning shit up, but here you RACISTS are trying to blame BLACK PEOPLE!üñïüèøüñïüèø exactly why we‚Äôre VOTING FOR BIDEN IN DROVES!! #BidenHarris2020Landslide
DNC got exactly what it wanted from Biden/Harris...two transactional people who will be a rubber stamp for whatever their donors feel is important.
Black women made 64¬¢ under 8 years of Obama/Biden. You really expect us to believe Biden is the answer for 2¬¢ increaseüòí #NeverBiden #ADOS
WHERE IS HUNTER BIDEN?
When Trump was asked by a reporter about lying to the American people Trump was like a deer caught in car headlights the Biden people should play the hell out of that clip
To bad he won‚Äôt get the letter. Even if he did get it before November 3rd 2020 it means nothing coming from you. When Biden/Harris are in office I hope they investigate every last one of you traitors that took something in exchange to look the other way on trumps crimes.
And Biden/Harris want to take our guns away.
Jeanine Pirro Suggests 'Something Might Happen' To Biden So He's Not On Ticket In November |
My dad, a republican as long as I can remember, is voting for Biden. And I am taking that as a hopeful sign.
Vote for Biden
I voted for Bernie. I gave money to Bernie. Progressives have pushed Biden to adopt left-leaning positions he didn't have before. We need to keep pushing.   Bernie wasn't going to be able to fix anything by himself, either, and radical good changes rarely happen quickly.
Please please please would someone try to defend this as not the most racist thing Joe blow Biden has ever done in his 40+ years in the People‚Äôs House. #SMH
If you don't think a President Biden would appoint a better attorney general than Bill Barr, or a better Education Secretary than Betsy DeVos, to name just two disastrous choices, I can't add anything.   I understand he's a weak compromise. Life is a series of compromises.
Democrats -- especially people like Biden and Harris -- are extremely ill-equipped to fight it. But holy hell, Trump has stormtroopers on the ground. If he wins again, he and his minions will take it as mandate, and oppression by the police state will get magnitudes worse. 3/3
Could only IMAGINE the piss fit Democrats would throw if Mike Pence responded with that same answer about Obama, Biden and Holder.ü§î
Biden doesnt like to be challenged either which is why he's so disrespectful to Black audiences-- not just to you because you dont challenge Biden. NO BLACK AGENDA NO VOTE  #REPARATIONS for #ADOS
These would be nice, but I'd be shocked if Biden or the Congressional Dem leadership did any of them. They seem to hold a dubious accelerationist-lite theory, that doing nothing to stop Trump from destroying the country will ultimately lead to his defeat.
Concerning private prison stocks...
Getting mad about Biden/Harris isn't being mad because I didn't get the color pony I wanted it's getting pissed off because I asked what's for dinner and got punched in the face and told to starve
I didn't say anyone said anything are u reading my replys? I'm definitely not ignorant on what happened I actually think your confusing Biden with Trump.  Biden is so far from being racist its funny and rapist not even close Trump, Bill Clinton and Jim Jordan all raped children
Local man begins preparing for election by studying the latest memes. "This one says a vote for Biden would be like slapping Jesus with an aborted fetus -- I certainly don't want to do that." More at 11.

Vote go Biden
Pennsylvania for Biden, hosted by a New Jerseyan and a Delawarean
I'm still laughing that Biden chose Kamala Harris. I mean there were, realistically, no good choices (that he was going to pick) but my holy shit. Imagine whiffing that bad.
I‚Äôve not seen this sentiment exactly, but plenty of Biden hate from those who hate a Trump too. He wasn‚Äôt my choice either and I‚Äôm not getting a Biden yard sign, but I‚Äôm not raggin‚Äô on him now. Accept it, vote, move on.
Bloomberg and Biden have homes near Epstein in pedo islands.

‚Äúhow often do you think Biden wakes up from his Alzheimer‚Äôs stints &amp; looks at Kamala &amp; is like i think we‚Äôll just take some sandwiches dear‚Äù -Andrew Shulz
she certainly wouldn't have been my choice but she has been supporting progressive lines of thinking. i think she is easily more of a progressive candidate than Biden. i just want them to win.
I'm voting IN PERSON, best why For BOTH candidates, see us Trump supporters are very nice People, we want it Fair all the way Around &amp; if Biden wins I WONT Need a puppy to hold, i will except  Him as my President, i was raised to RESPECT
How was it preventable, except for China. Tell us how would you have prevented it? Probably won‚Äôt answer like Biden.
Just got an email about my story that said Kamala Harris is not Black and the only reason SHE HERSELF and the media says she's Black is to help Biden secure the Black vote LOL   Case and point.
Kamala doesn't even like you! She Wants you out &amp; then she wants To be President, please wake up Mr Biden, their using you!!! So Sad
Why are you showing this? Are you opposed to Biden? If so please unfollow me. I won't put up with this shit. Go vote for Trump.
Bold of anyone to assume Biden didn't throw his campaign in the trash with this VP pick
Who are you voting for If not Biden or Trump? Seems like trump is a fatal disease on our democracy. Hold your nose and vote to save our democracy.
There‚Äôs not enough people going to a Biden rally to worry about them spreading anything.

Now, with that being said, I will be voting Biden Harris but am NOT happy about it. People deserve to know about the shit she did as AG. Woman is a cop, thats facts. Put mad heads in jail for weed and then went on breakfast club and was like "yeah I've smoked weed before LOL"
You know what Mrs. Warren, at Least your tactful, im a Trump Supporter &amp; I hate no one, Biden Should have picked You as VP
Brian Stelter: "When you see entire media companies essentially exist to tear down Joe Biden, is there an equivalent of that on the left, tearing down Trump?" CNN couldn't think of any.
I am in the same boat. I chose to vote for Biden because Trump is actually killing people with the way he has botched the virus
Funniest conspiracy theory I heard this morning: ‚ÄúJoe Biden is made out of Play-Doh!‚Äù  Actually lost my shit
I'm not saying Biden and Harris are good candidates but Trump said neo nazis are good people let's them do whatever,everything he says is lie,ripping America in half, doesn't care for anyone steps on everyone just to get reelected!Have some American Pride vote Biden or don't vote
‚ÄúBiden, Harris receive first official briefings on COVID, economy‚Äù
Does she mean like she betrayed Biden's accusers? I mean, she DID say she believed them.....   F**king opportunist. Do anything to get "a head".
Who are you calling a rapist?  Biden didn't rape anyone Trump raped 7 kids under the age of 14 their are 5 criminal cases pending against him till he's no longer president and 2 civil cases that he's postponed 6x.  Theirs also a 14 year old girl testifying what he did to her...#BidenHarrisLandslide2020  Of Biden family Indictments..
Stay away from Biden or else Trump will get choked out #BidenHarris
Biden basement strategy
The fact this is a discussion already and Biden isn‚Äôt even close to being in office yet is fucking scary. This is their plan all along
But look at the source, poor joe doesn‚Äôt know his right from his left or Up from down, this is the best the soulless party has, or is it a Trojan horse, does biden bow out at the convention and let BJ Harris take over, never can trust scum and the dems are scum
Biden Harris is the disease that will destroy our great country. A plague that race from one end of the country to the other laying waste to the American way of life as we know it. The only cure TRUMP 2020

three things  1.  a lot of back people don't like Trump, but don't hate trump as much as progressive white people.  they may not vote for Trump, but they may not go out to vote 2.  Biden should have picked Booker  3.  Trump isnt going to win either way.
Kamala is a wonderful leftist and you progressives should be happy I picked her. She‚Äôs Bernie but black and sassy and young and can dance and checks all the boxes. Biden/Kamala is the greatest ticket in history.

Who are these naive people insisting that "We need to push Biden to the left."  Biden won't be pushed. He's taking lobbyist money üí∞
Listen to how Joe Biden talks about black people in the present. He says they're all the same, they ain't black if they don't vote for him, even though he supported racist Exalted Cyclops Byrd's segregationist legislation.
The clip is literally right there, lady. Yet you insist. And racist? Ha. Biden: supported racist legislation of Exalted Cyclops Byrd, didn't want his kids raised in a racial jungle, and said poor kids are as bright as white kids.
Biden, fan of Exalted Cyclops Byrd? Supporter of his racist legislation, Joe also didn't want his kids to grow up in a racial jungle, although poor kids are as bright as white kids.
Outright lie, and we all know Joe Biden doesn't even know how to use Twitter.
Trump is making peace in the world today while Biden/Harris are still promoting more fear and control. Glad we're all waking up before it's too late.
You should just stop giving him all the free press. Falsehoods aren‚Äôt worth passing to the American people. Try covering the real truth from Biden &amp; Harris so that everyone could start to unite around something positive for a change.
So Trump said Biden is ‚Äú playing politics ‚Äú and has no clue what he is talking about ! This coming from a man who came from a Reality Show and actually still knows nothing about politics .

Hes gonna blast her like a 1v16 seed. Hell pull up all her past blasts AGAINST Biden, all of the stuff shes done to African Americans. Him picking her was a PR move, and not a smart one.
If you are a progressive and vote for Biden, then DEMOCRATS NEVER HAVE TO LISTEN TO YOU.   DO YOU FUCKING UNDERSTAND?
What if he just delivers some middle of the road voters instead and those voters help give Biden a margin of victory sufficient enough to overcome the variety of frauds and dirty tricks trump will use to steal the election?  IMO the $$$ is for the votes, so just get the votes.
So Joe Biden wants to keep us safe and get rid of this horrible pandemic, and you're complaining about that.  You and Donald Trump don't care who lives and who dies.  I think I know who I'm voting for.
Joe Biden want you to work at for the next three months and if you don‚Äôt you‚Äôre going to be a boy . That‚Äôs only the beginning weight
A nationwide mask mandate only makes sense if your goal is to save lives &amp; limit the spread of a deadly virus that has long term health consequences that we don't yet understand  What scheme is Biden up to? Is he secretly plotting to save American lives from an unnecessary death?
You Mr. Biden should not ever mention the word SOUL, as a catholic that backs abortion you show what a hypocrite you are, and your voice pick is lower than you, if that is possible. Please Mr. Biden don‚Äôt come back to Scranton, Pa we don‚Äôt need you.
Two good ones Biden and Harris the best the dems have, so vote straight republican
That‚Äôs just another reason the vote straight republican, let all democrats move to Hati with Harris and Biden they can be dictators there
No she don‚Äôt, only thing she cares about is when Joey boy resigns, but it won‚Äôt matter because on 4 nov the only thing biden can resign from is humanity which I believe has already been accomplished.

Look at that, the only fake defense the sheep and TDS diagnosed people can say. Its honestly funny yall keep bringing up a conspiracy that wasted tax payers money while biden has been indicated to be part of obamagate. Try again bud.
to the idiot leftists who refuse to vote for biden: if trump gets re-elected, the blood of every citizen that dies under his administration is on your hands... anyways
Just heard on my local news that Trump will be here on August 20th. Coincidence that he's coming to Biden's hometown on the night he accepts the nomination?
friendly reminder: refusing to vote or voting third party in a swing state just amplifies your privilege. I hate Joe Biden and Kamala Harris as most of us do, but people‚Äôs lives depend on getting Donald Trump the hell out of office.
My dad says he thinks "the plan" is for Biden to step down from his presidency shortly after going into office so that we get Harris as president. Assuming ofc DNC succeeds in snagging the win for Biden, which could still happen in all likelihood; I think it'll be close, like '16
1. This isn't 2016. 2. Trump is responsible for the deaths of 160,000+ Americans. 3. Did you see Biden speak earlier today? He was very coherent, he'll do fine at the convention. 4. Did you watch Biden and Bernie debate in March? I was team Bernie, but even I realize Biden won.
its less important from perspective that this election is a referendum on Trump.  If Bernie or Warren won the nomination the referendum would be on socialism.  But.. the dems wisely nominated Biden and so at it root this election is about whether you done with Trump or not.
Joe Biden is just a bunch of malarkey

It was refreshing to watch Biden and Harris speak without keeping their heads down as they read words by using their finger .
Biden getting choked up while Kamala talks about Beau is a great moment.
She is a liability not an asset. Can anyone really imagine her being president when Joe Biden is no longer capable?

Kamala isn't from a swing state, but according to these heatmaps they made, Kamala helps him in FL, MI, WI, MN, PA, GA, TX, AZ, CO, NM, NV, NC, NH and VA.  Not to mention, she'll help increase turnout among women and black voters, which are crucial for Biden to win over.

You‚Äôre not funny. Even if he does have cognitive deficits, (and we don‚Äôt know that he does) since when is making fun of someone for that appropriate?  Biden comes across as a kind, caring genuine person, the opposite of how people view you.
Dude I don't like either of their politics (now).   Trump is far worse. Biden will have a far superior cabinet.   This sort of post isn't journalism, isn't even commentary - Tim's trying to do fox news in the center by pissing everyone off, feeding kiddos to the alt right
She is very anti-Christian. Hopefully it will drive even more Catholics away from Biden.
This will be my first presidential election that I'm able to vote in. I'm making sure I vote and vote for Joe Biden.

Yes but this should happen ethically with actual plans to fight for the causes you and Biden talk about and if it goes in line with what needs to be changed than I wouldn‚Äôt mind voting either way

Biden screwed up again, if he pick Michelle ( she has no experience) biden could have won the Klingon vote , now who knows
i hear ya. But there won't be another pearl harbor in 2020.  Hillary isn't running.  Biden isn't scary. Pandemic crushed economy.  Trump is more toxic than when so many held their nose and voted for him before.  Only a vacant SCOTUS seat would save him.  I think.
he doesn't need to pull any voters off the fence.  just hit cruise control, play it safe. This election isn't about Biden, its a referendum on Trump.  If they nominated Bernie or Warren, it would be about policy. Dems did the one thing they needed to do, pick Biden.
Still riden with Biden
even 3rd party, you‚Äôre doing yourself and others around you an INJUSTICE. If you don‚Äôt think all politicians are shit that‚Äôs another conversation but we need to put our faith in the fact that we have to vote Biden if we want to continue to grow as a nation.
don‚Äôt even try to come for me right now because I‚Äôve said it before and I‚Äôll say it again. I‚Äôm an educated voter, I‚Äôve always used my voice against racists, transphobes, misogynists, COPS, etc but I‚Äôve also said with my entire chest that I intend on voting for Biden.
Yeah she does a great impression of calling Biden a rapist and a racist. Oh wait.....
And just like that the idiotic Democrats forgot all about Joe Biden groping young women on national television. Pandering at its finest.

Yes, Joe did love Robert KKK Exalted Cyclops Byrd, and supported his segregationist legislation. Democrat Byrd was still in the Senate 10 years and 2 months ago. He died in office or he might still be there, and he'd support Biden.
Shows that he supports a woman who was tough on marijuana crimes. That‚Äôs who Biden picked.
Sorry but it‚Äôs Biden/Harris for me üá∫üá∏
Biden only chose kamala because shes an african american who can draw in more votes?
He was charged and it was found Biden and his son were the real criminals. Nice try though.
Leaving this right here...  NATIONAL PRESS NEWS LEAD: Biden picks Harris  SCRANTON NIGHTLY NEWS LEAD: No Penn State football

CONGRATULATIONS, JOE!!! Great V.P. PICK!!!!!BIDEN/HARRIS2020!!!!!!
I'm mixed on the issue, but regardless, after seeing the takes you guys have on Trump, Biden, and Harris, I'm kinda glad that you need to be 18 lmao
Don't think many will be watching you Donnie..BIDEN KAMALA
In a historic move, Joe Biden has named California Sen. Kamala Harris as his running mate, selecting the first Black woman to compete on a major party‚Äôs presidential ticket.
100% not true.
I'll fit a political tweet in here. Fairly excited about this choice. Linked is a solid article addressing various angles of the selection.  Kamala Harris Is Biden's VP Pick -- Here's What It Means For The Election And Beyond
Wait I thought it was supposed to be a ploy to have Hillary as vp so Biden could step down üòÇ
Joe Biden did what he's done this whole campaign, he made a sensible move that will enable him to win. #BidenHarris2020
I thought joe Biden picked camila cabello as his running mate when I saw the news
Yep I need a Biden/Harris lawn sign instead of my Biden one üòç
And just like that with Biden picking Harris, who greatly contributed to the mass incarceration problem in America, as his VP he will no longer have my vote. Forget ‚ÄúBlue no matter who‚Äù, I have to be able to able to believe in a candidate and I do not believe in them.
I honestly don‚Äôt feel like a black woman was in Biden‚Äôs best interest which is so sad to say.
Merch! New! Now!  brb buying it all
So say if Joe Biden won. And them He someone unexpectedly died üëÄ we'd have a female president üëÅüëÑüëÅ
Great VP choice for Biden! Kamala Harris will make an excellent Vice President!
Biden felt that pressure
Was so hoping Kamala Harris!!  Thrilled.   My wife and I have been saying Biden/ Harris since November.  Great ticket!
I don‚Äôt even work on the Biden campaign!! Everyone just text the number and we‚Äôll all find out at the same time :)
Joe Biden thinks he can win the Presidency from his basement lol.
I guess the difference is Biden's commitment to picking a female running mate was some months ago. Additionally, I'd make the case that, based on Biden's campaign strengths and weaknesses, a lot of voters are anticipating what the VP candidate'll bring to the table. IMO of course
He's really trying to scare people. Sad part some people will believe him even though he's the one that was praising the Chinese in December not Joe Biden
if what is going on there is going on if/when Biden becomes president, he would do what?   That's a question I'd like an answer to.  Not just that he doesn't like it.  What would he do?
women in the suburbs, who held their nose and voted for trump, are either passing this time or going Biden.  He needs every point he can get.  Noem or Haley would be worth a few percentage points at least.  Pence brings no one in that isn't already for Trump.
if the first priority was winning and stopping Joe Biden... and forgetting what is polite or what is tradition, or what is nice, or what is fair, should Trump replace Pence and put a woman on his ticket and improve his chance of winning?
Just imagine if Joe Biden made that slip!!   trump would have shredded him to bits by now.

He just plays the media like a fiddle. Someone should call him out on his lies more often. Or just not even go to those press briefings. Biden needs more media time...
I think we all could agree it doesn‚Äôt really matter.  I have two Biden signs sitting in my front yard, but it could easily have been any of the other candidates the  party choose.  I just hate what we have now and anxious to get our normalcy back!  Btw, I was for Joe all along.
Why wouldn't it be Mayor Pete?  LGBT is, and has been, a higher priority for the Democratic party for some time.  Biden believes blacks all think alike and "you aint black" if you don't vote for me.  Why not keep presuming on their support and pick Mayor Pete?
I hope we all understand that we are voting for Biden because he‚Äôs our only choice.. a lesser of two evils so to speak.. dudes still a f‚Äôn creep
Trump would love to be running the Biden playbook of doing and saying absolutely nothing to win an election
The thing is, he does something like this every few days. You‚Äôd think you‚Äôd want to eliminate this issue by simply taking a few minutes and researching what‚Äôre you going to say. But this guy loves saying incorrect stuff. And yeah Biden says dumb stuff too.
Biden will step down as democratic nominee so that the DNC can hand select their candidate last moment
But please tell me more about Biden's dementia!
That's why there has been so much emphasis on Biden picking a black woman...
Democrat brutality!!! Slavery, KKK, Jim Crow, Senator Robert KKK Exalted Cyclops Byrd who died in office only 10 years ago, Biden. All Democratic Party! Biden supported Byrd's segregationist legislation, yet Biden has the nerve to say "you ain't black" unless you vote for him!
It‚Äôs kinda like Biden and his record player, out dated and takes up a lot of room.  With email/social media/zoom we simple don‚Äôt use USPS like before.  When you do go in employees all seem annoyed and all of the locations need a major remodeling.  Privatize &amp; rebuild if possible.
No matter.  Joe Biden is waiting to announce his VP pick at the same moment.  Take the wind from your sails.......learned it from you.
That‚Äôs exactly what he said. He never said Biden and would never
Then you should vote for Trump. Biden is against weed
why isn't  doing the Joe Biden bit every week on your show?
What the GOP doesn‚Äôt understand is Joe Biden owns his house in Wilmington. The White House belongs to the American people, not King Donald Trump.  A member of the Romney family should know the difference.
who is the competent person who will be helping Biden as he deteriorates?  I guess Susan Rice.
I would vote for Biden + inanimate carbon rod over the alternative. Hell, I'd vote for a ticket of 2 inanimate carbon rods
I would argue that the status of the country is one of the worst it‚Äôs been in 160 years. You think it can get worse than this? With all the morons Trump has fired and replaced with equal levels of idiocy, you don‚Äôt think Biden, who probably isn‚Äôt hitting on all cylinders cont..
YES, because Joe Biden was President Obama‚Äôs VP and Joe Biden was born in Scranton, PA.
What we have had has had long enough to fix their problems. If they wont fix it someone has to but that someone is still not trump or Biden
No shit they prefer Joe Biden lol. Him and Obama gave them the best deal they‚Äôve ever had.
This salts the earth on Biden. Biden is going to have to force businesses that withheld 6m worth to pay up in January. Those businesses are not going to be recovered and have cash-on-hand to pay. So forfeit 6m of tax revenue or take struggling businesses thru legal process. /1
"Dear God, you know the thing. Amen." -- Joe Biden
Seriously. Biden supported Robert Exalted Cyclops Byrd's racist segregationist legislation. And Byrd died in office in 2010. Just 10 years ago. How do any black people support Joe "Racial Jungle" "You ain't black" Biden?!
Yep, as disgusting as Joe Biden and Bill Clinton.
No way this is real. ‚ÄúWhen you have media companies that are designed to take down Joe Biden‚Äù. WHO???? Every single fucking media company is run by liberals. This is absolutely insanity
If there is a less self-aware person alive, I might eat my drawers! Brian Stelter: Conservative media companies 'exist to tear down Joe Biden'
Can you imagine what the younger Biden might have felt about an older person in a similar situation?  Is this elder abuse? I too pray his handlers help him off this platform.
OMG this interview was freakin nuts! $1200, $800 $400. What a s#%^show. These are people making life decisions! Idiots in charge. Don‚Äôt ever talk about Biden gaffes!
‚ÄúHe‚Äôs against God,‚Äù said Trump yesterday, referring to Joe Biden. What a bad and sad political attack.
Democrats hate facts and are the biggest hypocrites ever,  they all wanted a wall at one time or another,  Biden tells a black man he's not black if he votes for Trump,  imagine if Trump said that
Wow you have to be young, and not smart,  don't know politics and don't know when someone is going against whatever party is in the way of helping people.. he have us tax cuts, not rich people,  lower and middle class,  you'll see taxes if Biden wins,  and gas at 4.90 a gallon
I‚Äôm guessing if Trump does it, Americans won‚Äôt lose their life savings paying for their co-pays and will, this time, get to keep their preferred doctors and choice of insurance.......unlike Obama and Biden‚Äôs false promises.

to make Biden the nominee to prevent a possible Sanders nomination-- whom they would not be able to control (think Leftist Trump). Now, think about Biden's ties to China, and his rhetoric concerning China and Feinstein employing a Chinese spy for DECADES...
defeating him would be is if his economy faltered. Also remember, at the very beginnings of the global spread Biden was NOT on his way to winning the nomination, and in fact, the only reason he won it is because the "Party" intervened to have all challengers drop out of the race

Vote for Joe Biden
She‚Äôs correct hate to say it, but it would matter this time because if biden won and of course not the best pick for the country but has to be female and black&lt; biden then would resign due to ill heath and we have our 1st female president but TRUMP landslide will prevent that .
If Biden becomes president we won‚Äôt have a country, cannot let him or any of the demon democrats from holding any seats in Congress, it is up to US.

A vote for Biden is a vote to let pedophiles free and China to take us over.  It‚Äôs true.  If you love this country, vote Trump.  This Democrat is and I‚Äôve gotten a bunch to do the same!!!
You notice how the ‚Äúpress‚Äù just left the Biden presser like the sheep they are? They‚Äôre pathetic hacks for the Democrats.
Biden ran years ago and his campaign collapsed  because he plagiarized his speeches, inflated his academic records, lied about being an activist in the civil rights movement, lied about being in a  helicopter that was shot down over Afghanistan, etc.He's a very dishonest man too!
Remember when some of y'all were fully convinced Biden was replaced with a hologram?
yep,  trump's operation has an unlimited spicket of cash as he uses the govt for some of it. and also quite powerful resources as president.  Biden will have to outsmart his campaohm
noticed how i spoke in comparison between a "read-in" and someone who is an average joe of my age and demographic?  i spoke how i would feel looking at the issues, if i want on tsb and other savvy accounts, including biden
biden needs to message these people as well and talk about these wedge issues and make them feel burntout

At least, Trump doesn't want to fight them like Joe Biden does!
And he's still better than the Biden/ Harris ticket! That's how bad the Biden/ Harris ticket is!
If you don‚Äôt have a problem with the USPS union endorsing Biden, this is a silly position to have.
Only to have the American People replace them when Biden comes into office...I don't know how or why anyone would call themselves a  Republican,  and stand by and watch America become Russia

Biden could win 320 electoral votes, the Dems could flip the Senate and gain 20+ in the House and yet for the rest of our lives we‚Äôll still hear Trump say ‚Äòwell i dont know a lot of people say we actually won that crooked election‚Äô and he‚Äôll make headlines forever saying so
You are proud of a woman who believed the women who accused Biden of sexually harassing them and now, she turns around and accepted to be his running mate! Lady, I have to say that your standards for pride are very low!
I see the Biden/Harris ticket as very weak: One of them seems to be in Lalaland and the other one is like a weather vane! I don't see them as a good team for the country!

I am worried about what Trump will do when Biden wins the election and he still has two months until the inauguration. I fear he will employ a scorched earth campaign out of spite. You think the  defunding is petty and brutal? Just wait.
This is fucking hilarious weather you like Biden or not

Biden has long had strong relations with the African American community and often talks on the trail about serving as vice president to the country‚Äôs first black president, says  College political analyst Chris Borick.
Hillary raised about $1 Billion in 2016 and lost.  It's not the money, it's the political philosophy; in that respect, Biden will lose bigly (but Dems will predicably resist introspection, and blame everyone else but themselves for their loss).
Threatening a U.S. Presidential candidate?  . What are you going to do about this? Fox News is threatening Joe Biden. A woman whose friends with sex traffickers?
No, America isn't fine with that, to the extent that Dems are also involved with the same activities that you insinuate are nefarious.  America wasn't "fine" with electing Hillary President of the US b/c of Dem hypocrisy, and the same holds true w/ Biden in 2020.  Get real.
Why would Biden decide to step aside? I think he should be very careful now that his running mate has been named.

Trump will beat his ass off the stage.  Biden will lose
Biden won't win.  He can't even speak right
Biden mispronounced her name today.
I have no respect for women who use men to get ahead! When you're a strong woman in your own right, you don't do that! Kamala Harris said that she supported the women who accused Joe Biden of sexual harassmen. She also accused him  of racism! However, she is now his running mate!
Why would little Black and brown girls feel overlooked and undervalued? Is that how Joe.Biden thinks of them? That's such a racist thing to say!  By the way, hasn't Joe Biden noticed that Harris is light- skinned? Does he know her mother is Indian, father Jamaican? Surreal!
I think that‚Äôs the biggest fear is, that although Biden wasn‚Äôt my first choice, I still will be voting for him NO matter what. And with the votes that are going to him how the ‚Äúfollowers‚Äù of the ol‚Äô cheeto are going to feel.
BIDEN DID NOT PUT HIS KIDS ON THE BUS. THE AFRICAN AMERICAN.  KIDS.  SHAME ON YOU BIDEN.   TRYMP 2020
This is what Biden meant when he said he beat Trump like a Drum....
Where are you watching the dotard? It appears both   and  both smartly decided not to show his rally so that real news about Biden/Harris could be covered.

#joebiden Joe Biden and Kamala Harris...both speeches,  what a bunch of crap!#KAG2020
I could swear biden was endorsing her
And now, Joe‚Äôs making me cry. I‚Äôm beginning to think we‚Äôre gonna be all right. Biden and Harris will pull us out of this unspeakable mess the dotard put us in.
Biden and Harris - Live in Delaware, Now.     #BidenHarris2020
Biden is killing it!  Makes me proud to be an American again.
My husband, a life long Republican, is crying as we watch  introduce  as Vice President. Let‚Äôs get this done! Vote Biden/Harris 2020!
Are you saying vote for Trump or Biden?
#WATCH:   appear together in #Delaware. See their event live soon on   #Election2020
In 30 years of voting, I have NEVER voted for a Democrat for President. I‚Äôm voting for Biden/Harris in 2020 just to ensure there IS a presidential election in 2024
I don't care about the race or gender of a candidate. I don't care that Joe Biden chose Kamala Harris as his running mate! My concern is about who's going to be strong on keeping the US secure in the face of this "Defund the Police" movement which Harris is okay with!
I see that as a separate issue. The fact is that the Lincoln Project, a Republican group, published a Biden-Harris campaign video, a good one, within an hour or so of the announcement. I applaud that, and I'm not worried about what George's wife was doing at that same time.
Harris thought Biden racist, his star shines brighter in racist homes.
WATCH: Chris Borick, Director of the  College Institute of Public Opinion, speaks to  about Joe Biden's choice of Kamala Harris for VP.
Systemic change takes time. And progress will be more difficult with four more years of Trump, than with Biden as president, in my opinion. It's an uphill battle either way, but more so with Trump continuing in office. All just my own opinion, of course. We each get to have them.
Well, let's see! Joe Biden loves children jumping on his lap, sexually harasses women and.children - lots of pictures and videos to support this- and let's not forget that Tara Reade said he raped her when he was a senator. So, why are you voting for a sexual harasser and rapist?
Yes, he did. That's why I'm not a duopoly fan. And, there are also major factual differences between a Trump Administration and a Biden Administration that matter a significant majority of Americans.
If elected, which part of the Biden/Harris radical left agenda will trigger republicans the most?
The mistakes that Trump has made are minor compared to what  would make. Nobody is perfect, but Joe Biden would take that to the extreme.
Biden announced that his VP pick is Kamala Harris. This is not bad news. Her representation can bring a warmth to the politics of today; she will push both progressive and moderate ideals; she will work for all people. We need people like Kamala Harris, so let's fight for her!
That's actually Joe Biden in the picture!
Frankly,  should be given any damned position she wants. She out fundraised all of the other VP candidates, Biden is adopting her policies with little or no attribution...enough of the silent women doing the hard work and getting no credit.
Yo how great would it be if center-right democrats like Biden, Harris, and Pelosi were actually the radical socialists the far right believes them to be?
I voted for Gore, Kerry, Obama (twice), and Clinton. I'll be voting for Biden, too. Democrats rarely win when their base feels they "have to" vote for their candidate rather than genuinely wanting to, so maybe ease up on the "you have to vote Biden" rhetoric?
Biden is a asskisser for China
Joe Biden Picks Kamala Harris as 2020 Running Mate - Mike Pence Will Fear Her
I'm a white progressive. Not voting for Biden/Harris. Am I an Uncle Tom too?
Cmon how could you say that, the left tells me biden is a devout catholic!
B/c there are going to be A LOT of talks about "What Biden wishes he could do"  and in a pandemic, that doesnt slow disease spread or oxygenate a patient's lungs and respiratory system. It's not gonna matter to the outcomes how he felt when he didnt do anything.
Biden isn't even in office yet.  You have your man in office. He isn't doing shit and doesn't give a damn if you die.   He himself said more will die it is what it is.  He isn't doing a thing.  Why get pissed at someone not in office when your is killing people with indifference
Not a great endorsement for Biden. So his VP is brighter than he is?Trump and Pence will.trounce them in.debates
So the Democrats shut the left out of the convention.  And the platform.  And the ticket.  To "not scare" the Republicans who want to vote for Biden.  So they don't care about alienating the left? They don't need us?  This tent has grown unmanagably big. We need a new tent.
But always right,Babs.China,Mexico,Biden,Comey,N.Korea,the economy....he keeps winning for USA
Why are people angry now, Elizabeth Warren can still be a major component of Mr. Biden‚Äôs cabinet. She is smart and strong and is on the right team, let‚Äôs stick together. I agree this election is too important to not pull together. Bernie and Elizabeth see it so must we
Uh, I think the opposite has happened, the GOP was taken over by the radical extreme right! Biden and Harris are moderates!
Just a reminder that Harris intentionally hid evidence from trials to keep innocent people in prison. Trump, Biden and Harris are all fine examples of authoritarian rule; this country will burn by the end of the decade because of all these politicians.
Biden has been in government for 47 years and hasn‚Äôt done a thing. What makes you think being president is going to change that?
Not true at all. Biden was leading well before Covid.
yea its just soft serve ice cream lol idgaf if joe biden hands it to me
Biden could come out in his Pj‚Äôs like Clark Griswald eating a bagel, drinking an Irish coffee, take a shot of Jack, and still have more mental fitness and acuity than president dementia. I don‚Äôt even like Biden. A broken bicycle would probably be a better vote then Trump.
I think she's very aligned with Biden, making it a safe pick.  It's just that she's not a progressive by all means.

Harris and Biden should constantly advertise Trump‚Äôs endorsement.

Trump Quickly Assails Harris, as Democrats Praise Her
Biden didn‚Äôt pick a lapdog like you.
Believe me...Now that this Administration and Bill Barr know that Biden and Harris will be privy to Classified Top Secrets and Getting Briefed on certain things...Know the paper shredders are working over time tonight in the White House...
Kinky Kamala in some way to reference her past relationship with Willie Brown then pondering what she did to earn the nod from Biden...
Joe Biden has prostituted himself to special interests and foreign powers for his entire career, so his choice of a transactional candidate for the Democrat VP slot is perfectly consistent with his ‚Äúresume‚Äù. #TuckerCarlson
I'm impressed she actually beat Bernie. This is great. A nice balance to Joe Biden's centrism.   #BidenHarris  #AmericaOrTrump

Biden isn't dumb.  Why show the dumpster all his cards?  Dumpster is corrupt and will use anything against him.  Can't use what he doesn't have.  Biden needs to get in office then prove what he can do.  He can't be worse than the wanna be king.
Chairman Allen West's Statement on Kamala Harris as Joe Biden's Running Mate - Republican Party of Texas
The Trump campaign statement today wasted no time and referred to her as Phony Kamala because [they lied] she called Biden a racist.
No. Not really.  I dont believe trumps bull shit. He wants you scared of blacks moving i. Suburbs.  Haha. This is his america but pretends it will be bidens.  Haha.  And i care about my next fart more than i care about you.  Wasted voter for trump.  Haha. NJ goes to biden.
‚ÄúOne of the dumbest people I‚Äôve met‚Äù??? I thought you only hired the best people? When exactly does the winning start? You make a fool of yourself every time you speak. You‚Äôre a failure and a fraud! Biden/Harrie 2020 üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏
Republican, voted trump in 16.  I hate Biden but im voting for America.  And no doubts in my mind i could kick your ass.  And i dont write false statements.  I hope you are in Nj so your vote is wasted.. Biden already won NJ.
The 2 biggest problems in this country right now are cops and covid, and Biden has proven himself to clueless, incompetent, and potentially actively harmful on both fronts, in a way that shows that pretty much fuck all would change in the unlikely case that he does beat Trump.
At this point i don't know what would make me feel better about american voters, trump losing or biden losing.
How long until Biden refers to Kamala by a totally incorrect name?
I really don‚Äôt think she will. Biden is a strong supporter for us. And Harris has taken supportive positions both AG and Senator. Could she possibly be worse than trump? NO!
While there are democrats that agree with defunding the police.  Biden has stated more than once that is not what he wants or agrees with.  He has stated more than once he will not defund the police.  Stop the false rhetoric.
That's not true.  Biden is not for defunding the police.  He has stated it more than once.  He is for some reorganizing, education and other things.  However he is not, never was for defunding the police.  False rhetoric from the other side
I don't care who is in power as long as we become a country that values healthcare as a human right, higher education access to all who qualify and a database of firearms with common sense rescrictions. Will Biden/Harris value that over lobbyists? I doubt it but I hope Im wrong.
Nothing you just mentioned from Biden wirh help either of those two problems.
Kamala Harris Is Biden‚Äôs Choice for Vice President
Biden has been cutting deals with conservatives for 50 years. You do the research. No radical change on this ticket Mary.
Yes thank you! Biden/Harris 2020!
I just heard - Joe Biden picked Kamala Harris as his running mate!
I just heard - Joe Biden picked Kamala Harris as his running mate!
Biden/Harris 2020! Let‚Äôs do this! üï∂üêùBiden would be lucky if somebody would show up on a row boat
I don't believe liberal or conservative media. Won't watch either news. I do know that Biden is the much better choice than the White Supremacist in the Oval Office. I have voted both Dem &amp; Repub. I was going to vote  in 2016. Again, I will not vote Trump.
I still have  2020 for President T-shirts that I bought after she announced her running in 2019. Now it has to be Biden/Harris 2020.
I mean. It's a message that's working well for Biden.
Hopefully a lot of Republicans will lose their seat. They‚Äôre not stupid they‚Äôre complicit in Trumps crimes. We need Senators who work for the people. Biden/Kamala
But I believe Biden has MORALS and values. Cares about the Constitution, Rule Of Law, Trump cares about Trump, about having power. Biden is the only logical choice
I think I know what he doing this because he is scared of kamala and joe Biden
Democrats want the black population dependent on them so you vote for them, they want the black population to remain victims, remember what Joe Biden said, you ain‚Äôt black
is an incumbent, running on the same platform he ran on four years ago THAT HE HAS FAILED TO DELIVER! With a failed economy, pandemic ravaging the Country, riots in the streets, rampant racism from the GOP. VOTE BIDEN!
Uh oh! Liberals better get over here! There's minorities here that absolutely loathe Joe Biden! I bet that's a no-no for you!!!!ü§Øü§Øü§Ø
So we just went back to full ppe at work ..so happy labor day..here's your candy kids.. BIDEN WINS ....turkeys in the oven..open ur presents ppl  ....HAPPY SAY IT WITH ME NOW .... JUMANJI!!!!
.... I feel we need to have Latinos get more time to speak than most of the whites.  We don't want to alienate the Latino base, they are really important for Joe Biden winning the election as well.  2/2
We need Trump out of office ASAP. I will vote Biden and then fight for structural change because I also don‚Äôt believe the Biden/Harris is the ticket for change.
Republicans controlled both the House and the Senate for last 6 years during the Obama-Biden years. Republicans had the House in 2009, when Obama took over.

Your Russian bots are active this morning. You fear Biden/Harris ticket. #UrineTroubleTrump
I am very excited.  Biden will be great. Kamala will be great.
No he is expecting a place in the Biden administration some where for being a good tyrant. Assuming the can steal this election. #maga
Here‚Äôs why I‚Äôm voting Biden/Harris!
No, he‚Äôs ‚Äòcalling‚Äô E.T. The New World Order Machine behind Biden, that‚Äôs who wants the mandate.
I could care less about Trump vs Biden cus I‚Äôm not voting for either ( will get my vote) BUT I‚Äôm going to thoroughly enjoy the Trump vs Kamala 2-1/2 Month Twitter War!   Who has the popcorn???
While wearing a mask making a delivery of 30 cases into a kitchen my 02 saturation dropped to 90.1% so now don't where it unless asked Biden and Harris are DOPES#Dopes
She is only a prop for biden to get votes he only brought her on because of color talk about bigot lol People wait up
Biden will be in the White House after he wins in November.
Really disgusting
This would make it harder for Biden to sniff little girls and for Kamala to read people their Miranda rights
ABORTION ON DEMAND. Im gonna pop my tv remote out and start looking for the "abortion" button as soon as Biden is elected. Lets get it.
What should scare ALL AMERICANS is four more years of Trump! More death, destruction of Constitution, being laughing stock of world, blatant racism, VOTE BIDEN-HARRIS!
Trump is running scared. He knows his campaign doesn‚Äôt have an answer for the Biden/Harris ticket.

Omg you‚Äôre right!!! I‚Äôm switching my vote from Biden to Trump now! üôÑ
I'm voting for Biden, not a White Supremacist like
It's legitimately good that we very well may have a black woman as vice president. That is a step in the right direction.   However, Kamala &amp; Biden have both historically been "tough on crime" and I dislike the message that sends when people are fighting so hard for change.
Anyone calling Kamala or Biden any kind of radical is (unfortunately) completely wrong. Republicans are either totally politically illiterate or purposefully obfuscating. Probably both.
The best thing about Kamala Harris being Biden's pick is the right attacking her for being "anti-cop" when she was literally a fucking prosecutor lmaooo
I guess you watched Biden/Harris presser. You are in deep shit. And you know it.
serious topic here: you either accept the fact that kamala harris is biden‚Äôs vp or you let trump win. it sucks but there is one option and one option only.
What happened to Kamala Harris believing joe Biden‚Äôs rape victims. That just water under the bridge now? Her tax plans are going to cripple people. They win middle class will lose
Yes she should run and Win with Biden!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I can assure you, gor ever 1 Biden sign, I see 15 Trump signs
I‚Äôm in PA, it is not gonna go to Biden.

6 ft. please.  Why is touchy Joe so close to our next to be great president.   Biden will now win and let K.H. do the thinking for him for 4 years if.
Isn‚Äôt the above comment the same for Biden? He does have sexual assault cases which Harris said she believes the accusers. Biden just said you ain‚Äôt black if you don‚Äôt vote for me and the Latino community is diverse unlike the African American population...isn‚Äôt that racist ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Kamala Harris most resembles me. She is a child of immigrant parents and grew up in America. Joe Biden grew up in a working class family in PA. Trumps father was a businessman and so was mine. He himself wasn‚Äôt in a small business. He started with a 1M head start

There‚Äôs obviously no getting thru to you.The brain washing is complete, but I‚Äôll explain it one more time. There isnt a person on the planet that ‚Äúsupports‚Äù abortion.Biden, I‚Äôm sure, wishes abortions weren‚Äôt necessary.Since you‚Äôre against contraceptions,you‚Äôre part of the problem
So in your world, both slavery and abortion are despised by the majority of the country. In your world, abortion is illegal but Biden wants to bring it back because he‚Äôs ‚Äúpro-abortion‚Äù. Religious people have such child like brains.
So Biden created the abortion laws? He‚Äôs somehow ‚Äúpromoting‚Äù abortion? What religious people don‚Äôt understand is that NO ONE wants abortion. But since we don‚Äôt live in a perfect world, sane people would rather women have safe ones...not back alley ones.
Joe Biden doesn‚Äôt even know yet.
I‚Äôm trying to figure out why he‚Äôs not catholic. Has Biden gotten an abortion?

Sorry. Busy watching news abt future US President Joe Biden &amp; Vice-President Kamala Harris. It was much more uplifting and honest. It was joyful and beautiful. It gives us hope that in January 2021 things will begin to change - after a landslide for for Biden Harris in Nov 2020!

I can be excited about Biden &amp; Harris while also maintaining the sense that we can do better. They weren‚Äôt our first choice, but they‚Äôre the better alternative by a long shot.
I see where you‚Äôre coming from there. Whole thing sucks. And you‚Äôre right this has been a shallow move from the moment he said ‚Äúmy vp will be a woman.‚Äù He‚Äôs pandering.  I think a Biden presidency is going to be stagnant at best. No matter who is VP.
Biden‚Äôs racist though üòí
Biden picks..
Biden gets only one term regardless is my feeling. He‚Äôs a filler we gotta start working on 24 as soon as he wins.
Interesting pick. She does not give Biden CA and she has enough of a record for the Trump camp to get some wedge issues. It probably does not matter--Biden is in a very strong position in that Trump's ceiling is so low but she is not whom I would have advised had I been asked.
If Biden/ Harris doesn‚Äôt win this election, it‚Äôs  for President in 2024. Let‚Äôs see how this plays out. AOC is the most influential politician outside of Trump in America right now. When she speaks people listen!
Biden is a much stronger candidate than Clinton. The Ds needed to nominate someone whose personality is in contrast to Trump's abrasive personality and Biden certainly fits the bill. He is stronger in industrial regions. He has a good shot at GA, TX, NC, and a great shot at FL.
"Joe Biden named California Sen. Kamala Harris as his running mate on Tuesday, making history by selecting the first Black woman to compete on a major party‚Äôs presidential ticket." Black? I'm so white, I look like a ghost, but I might be more black than her.
Stupid pick. She is half Jamaican and half Indian, got less than 2% of the vote in running for the Presidential nomination, is from a state Biden will most likely win, ancestor was slave owner, slept with an old married man to get ahead, and women hate her. #rememmberkavanaugh

Not where i am,  i am just outside Reading and all Trump here. Have yet to see a Biden sign.  I am sure they will come but zero so far
By Biden‚Äôs America he is referring to Biden saying NOTHING.against these riots and looting and referring g to the fact that this is all happening in democratic cities,  Biden‚Äôs party.  Pretty simple concept.
The democrats running those cities do nothing,  Biden says nothing.  Trump wants to help abd send in the guard but the democrats refuse to allow it.  What is hard to understand here?
In Biden's case it most definitely matters as there is zero chance he finishes a term. You're literally voting for the next president.
Yep,  not a single Biden one.  PA is solid red
‚ÄúHer involvement is a strategic decision to energize young progressives without tying former Vice President Joe Biden too closely or directly with her agenda.‚Äù  So she‚Äôs a prop? A mascot? Help me out here,  Person who uses  phone for him?
