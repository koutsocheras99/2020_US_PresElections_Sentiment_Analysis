What could Russia have found out about Biden that could be worse then the hundreds of things Trump has already done?
Our house will be #RidenWithBiden2020 because Biden is a kind decent man you will put our democracy first. All of us will #VoteBlueToEndThisNightmare Up and down the ticket
Murphy, Biden haven't discussed vice presidential pick -
#foxnews  Who cares what Donna Brazile thinks. As far as Joe Biden, forget about it. Democrats are finished.  President Trump 2020!
Biden is clearly a racist--the tell was when he was willing to spend eight years playing second fiddle to a younger black man that is reviled by racists in America.  It's all part of his master plan.
It‚Äôs ok to say biden is a racist
# OutnumberedOvertime  Jessica Tarlov gives America a headache and Joe Biden simply belongs at home in the basement.  President Trump 2020!
Latino‚Äôs have the most to lose in a Trump administration.  So why aren‚Äôt they coming out in droves in support for Biden? And why has Biden picked a Republican Latina to drum up support for him?  And why are Black people under 30 planning to sit this one out? ü§î
Never 45. Never Kanye. Take back our country!
Opinion | The Trump fiasco just got worse. That gives Biden a hidden opening.  Well worth the read.
It will be a Biden win but it will be invalidated via a contingent election.
Maybe Joe Biden is really the person who‚Äôs insulting people here, but idk maybe I‚Äôm just saying weird things like ‚Äúmore people don‚Äôt need to die for you to be comfortable in your bad decisions‚Äù ü§∑
Biden issued a clarification did you report that?
Biden done had so many mishaps with the black community, he proposing free tuition for HBCU‚Äôs. ü§£ he ain‚Äôt have no choice but to make a move like this.
VP Biden can not only say Yosemite correctly, he actually knows where it is.
You do mean Trump's "stumbling and bumbling" - "Thigh-land" "Yo se might" - yeah, VP Biden has the problem - WRONG!!!
It‚Äôs ok to say biden is a racist
1001% Ryan! That‚Äôs one of my biggest problems w/ Biden &amp; DNC. They can‚Äôt see beyond the big dollars. Too.
Sorry, but to vote for Biden, means that we are all victims, Joe and his Party of KKK, win and we are all Slaves of the DemocRat Party!
If the issue of faith &amp; the Bible comes up in a debate, Biden will eat him alive.Trump only goes to church for photo ops... even his weddings. He knows NOTHING from the Bible. He admits to never asking forgiveness. He bathes in sin. Hell, he even  considers himself infallible.
Nope. We are going to see a Biden win that will be invalidated by court cases. This will force Roberts to set up a contingent election.
You finally hit the nail on the head for once, Juan. Yes,  Joe Biden is a doddering old fool that would best be put away by his family.
I forgot you existed till I saw you on Fox. Don't any of you Democrats have the balls to say Biden is incompetent and you would never vote for him? I guess you're gearing up for another run in four years. By the way I'm Pro oil and fracking.
Heads Biden wins. Tails 45 loses.
Watching his troops refuse to fight at Kip‚Äôs Bay, Washington exclaimed ‚ÄúAre the men with which I am to defend America?‚Äù   Watching Trump and Biden today, I‚Äôm thinking ‚ÄúAre these the men which we have to lead America?   We really can‚Äôt get anyone else?
Wasn‚Äôt that John J. ‚ÄúJohnny Doc‚Äù Dougherty holding up Biden‚Äôs arm in a support of victory?
If you‚Äôre saying this now, you‚Äôre not voting for Biden, stop

If Biden genuinely wants to win, he has to adopt Medicare for All‚Äîit‚Äôs incredibly popular &amp; an overwhelming majority of Americans want it  If we don‚Äôt push him on it until he does, Trump wins  So if you really want Trump out, why are you trying so hard to get him reelected
You know what.  You are correct.  It is just frustrating. Im not thrilled wirh Biden.   But i still believe 4 years of Biden wont be as devastating as another 4 of Trump.
Is this a Biden ad?
Biden is trying to really unify the African American Community. A few more statements like this and he'll convert them all to becoming Trump Supporters.
Given the current social norms. Karen is perfect description for her as well as her name.  Ass is more descriptive than Bass. Fish maybe? Has Biden smelled her?
Biden will win but directive 51 will be imposed. This will nullify the election.
Are you kidding? Post Trump is just the BEGINNING of the fight! It‚Äôs gonna take a long ass time to build a new world order from this dystopia. The fire THIS time! Pushing gaffe-happy Biden to the left will be a fight. + Racism &amp; Trumpism will remain, as will T himself. Buckle up!

Trump cronies lie about everything-including doctored video &amp; audio of their opponents. Remember the press conference microphone "grab. Now Biden's backgrounds, speech patterns, and hand gestures are being altered in Trump ads. It's still lying. The thing Trump is best at.
Hatred hears no logic.  Biden supporters who hate Trump will have no interest in debates.. Their minds are made up.  Early debates make sense for most people.
A crazy person pinning his hopes on a crazier person --both running for president of the most powerful country in the world.  I cannot believe this is my country. It's mortifying and hard to accept.  If Biden is elected, the country will still have this huge, sick underbelly.
if you love China, vote for basement joe.  He will reverse anything Trump effected.   Biden hates Trump enough to want higher taxes, open borders, more abortions, high unemployment, military weakness--all in exchange for power.
If Biden wins, say goodbye to anything Trump.  He hates Trump enough to reverse lower taxes, restrictions on abortions, secure borders, military supremacy, energy independence, and even religious freedom.
What will Biden, the hiding basement guy, bring to our country?   His hatred of Trump will destroy anything Trump gave America:   lower taxes, energy independence, support for police and military, secure borders, restrictions on abortion, better trade deals, veterans health care.
Chip in to elect Joe Biden and other Democrats on the ballot
I don‚Äôt need a debate to know who I am voting for.  Team Biden.
Nope. It will be a win for Biden that will be invalidated by the president.

Biden beat you!
Really neither. Don't care about President Trumps taxes. Even if Biden doesn't have dementia he's still a Democrat. They have unmasked their communism.
Joe Biden won‚Äôt travel to DNC due to coronavirus; Trump may use White House lawn
People who know both candidates personally report: Biden has a serious studder; Trump has a serious personality disorder. Biden has strategies to control his studder. Trump cannot control his compulsions. I'll take an interrupted speech pattern over a constant stream of lies.
Remember when trump said he would make a large charitable contribution if Obama would release his birth certificate? Republicans thought it was a great idea.  Fox News hosts loved it. So Biden should say he will debate if trump releases his tax returns.  Even just a few returns.
They should be careful about what they wish for...Biden will crush that motherfucker and they will no longer be able to use the narrative that Biden is a cognitively impaired, homebound shut-in.
Three months ago it was hoax. Biden was mocked by republicans and Fox News for wearing a mask. Today trump says it will just go away.  But not you think it‚Äôs a crisis?
Biden won't go to Milwaukee -
N.J. Latino leaders praise Biden plan -
100%. My ask: just give a glance at Biden‚Äôs agenda.Just a glance, with its frequent use of ‚Äúworking class‚Äù &amp; focus on uplifting domestic workers- &amp; then argue that Biden, despite his many faults, isn‚Äôt 1000% better for all than the man in the WH. Get him in WH then push like hell
In all fairness,  Joe Biden doesn't remember if Joe Biden took a cognitive test.
Early voting starts next month in battlegrounds Fla., Mich., N.C. and Pa.‚Äîand Biden leads Trump in all 4   VOTE EARLY AND GET TRUMP OUT ASAP.
In all fairness,  Joe Biden doesn't remember if Joe Biden took a cognitive test.

Does Joe Biden know Joe Biden took a cognitive test?
Joe Biden buries the hatchet and looks to bring in Kamala Harris as running mate  via   SHE'S MY LAST CHOICE AS V.P.
But I thought is was only Biden that could make a verbal gaffe? Perhaps it is something we are all capable of.
I hope Biden picks your choice for VP but I‚Äôm voting for him even if he picks Bobby Brown!
But wait, I thought Joe Biden said you weren't black if you didn't vote for him...
Joe Biden puts the impotent in incompetent !
No  Ryan said ‚ÄúDemocrats‚Äù not specifically the DNC. I took ‚ÄúDemocrats‚Äù broadly, to mean Biden, the soon-to-be-standard bearer, the DNC &amp; even Obama, the most influential Dem out there.
agree w/ you 100% Duncan. Ryan is right except where he said Biden is ‚Äúmoving right.‚Äù Reasonable folks, depending on idealogical bent, can argue, as you do, that he‚Äôs ‚Äústaying right.‚Äù I‚Äôll read his platform very carefully but i‚Äôd say he‚Äôs moving left...too slowly, not far enough.
Ryan, pls explain how they are moving ‚Äúright‚Äù? I know, I know: Biden, DNC are blocking M4ALL, punking out on Corp $, cannabis etc. but how is that moving right? Obama‚Äôs eulogy of Lewis offered some prog goodies. Not playing devil‚Äôs advocate; genuinely seeking clarification. Thx
Biden needs to ask, ‚ÄúAre you better off than you were 4 years ago?‚Äù
Where is HUNTER BIDEN?
Smile more? Some critics see sexism in debate over Biden VP  via  The DemocRat Party is a Comedy of Errors - How is it Sexism - the VP Candidates are all Female, all Black, all old, but which has the Ability??? Qualified??
Biden doesn't have to campaign your Dad is DESTROYING HIMSELF every day..
You should vote for whoever you see fit, the issue is third party just doesn‚Äôt get enough coverage, so your average American that gets all their information from the news is either gonna vote for trump or Biden since chances are they know nothing about the third party candidates
Joe Biden hasn't done anything years. He's part of the radical left and you know it. Sanders is also a lunatic and you know that too. Why don't you go back to a liberal Network? What are you doing on Fox?  You hate conservatives.
Who the hell thinks this guy is going to wipe the floor with Biden in a debate?
Opinion | Biden‚Äôs running mate matters. So does his Cabinet.
I think they called someone in the Biden campaign
No worse than Al Gore Joe Biden or Tim Kaine.
Give me a break. Where is the tape where Biden says he can ‚Äúgrab a woman by the puxxy because they let you‚Äù. Where is the tape where Biden says he ‚Äúlikes his people not captured‚Äù. False outrage and total hypocrisy.
I‚Äôm w/ you 100%  It‚Äôs time to take advantage of this great time in history &amp; look for solutions, man. Answers that really help people. I took heat from the left for saying I‚Äôll vote for Biden though he‚Äôs not for M4ALL. Get him in then we push again. Fight‚Äôs never over!
Trump slaughtered the loser Republican candidates in 2015/16...it was so pathetic. Biden won't back down
Respectfully object. You won‚Äôt get just complaining from yours truly, as many of my tweets show. In fact dwelling in just ‚ÄúTrump-is-evil‚Äù gets us nowhere. I‚Äôll vote Biden.Then I‚Äôm about moving beyond T &amp; his deadly crap to focus on using energy of BLM to forge a real 3rd party
Biden doesn't need his ego stroked like Trump does. He also knows how to do the job, having learned from a master. Letting 45 flail and fail all on his own is brilliant.
I don't know who this guy is but I'm getting REALLY of these hot takes on- 'will he leave?'                           ' will he lose?'  And my favorite (NOT) "I can't vote for Biden, he doesn't excite me'
NP, take care of bizness. Ist, I‚Äôd vote viable 3rd party if I could #BLMinspiredparty. 2nd, I‚Äôve been railing for yrs against the obscenely high cost of Obamacare. I know white collar folks who can‚Äôt do the premiums! But it‚Äôs there &amp; no preexisting. Galls me Biden isn‚Äôt for M4ALL
w/ you  I‚Äôve been asking for a while if the blacks he has in high places are really calling the shots. Understandable Biden, an ol‚Äô white paternalistic liberal dude leans on his similar buddies. But why‚Äôd he allow Dodd‚Äôs tired view to get out? He thinks the same?üßê
I hear you. That‚Äôs why I asked Ryan what he means by ‚Äúgood,‚Äù right? We have to compare Biden to someone. In this case his opponent is T. Again, I am NOT a Biden fan. I want what you &amp; Ryan want. Plus I WANT a 3rd party. But now AIN‚ÄôT the time to throw away my vote to make point
But he proudly proclaimed that he's taking votes from Biden. He's openly declared that's his intention.
Wait til 'the caravans of BLM Marxist protestors' start showing up on FOX!  I'm surprised they haven't tied it to the 'Biden will destroy the suburbs' stuff they've been saying. And by 'destroy' they mean 'negroes might move into your neighborhood!'
Is it any wonder China wants Biden to win, does this even need to be talked about? I‚Äôm sure they would be estactic #Trump2020
Biden‚Äôs Quietly Radical Care Plan   He speaks to the people, for the people.
No no no no no! I have not set the bar low. Read ANY of my tweets. I ain‚Äôt for the established D party; I ain‚Äôt for Biden in way you‚Äôre suggesting. I WANT a 3rd humane party NOW! But for NOW we got to get the existential threat out of the DAMN away to get to anything better.
If his advisors think their best shot is trotting his bloated orange carcass out to speak into a microphone then I feel even better about Biden's chances.  I'm sure they'll remember to insist that debate take place on level ground and not an elevated platform.
Another day another fox reporter attacking Biden.
Ryan, it depends on what YOU mean by ‚Äúgood‚Äù? On a humane level Biden is 1000% better than the outright grifter in WH. He‚Äôd TRY to stop people dying! On policy, I, a strong-ass progressive, like millions will hold my nose &amp; vote Biden. In this binary choice hell yeah hes ‚Äúgood‚Äù
How effectively will you be able to fight Biden with khive liberals relentlessly doxxing &amp; harassing dissidents with the full backing of the party in power &amp; corporate media providing cover for them by demonizing the movement as traitors who hate America
Biden is a idiot, know him quite well ...a career liar
Pardon me. July 26-29, aggregate polling shows Biden up ~8.5%. Still not "barely" and not 4%.
And the voters. Why do you insist on leaving out the actual voters who voted and gave Biden the delegates to clinch the nomination?  Your lack of respect for the results at the polls rivals the Dumpster Fire's. You only accept results when you win.
No, that's not what he said. Try getting your facts straight.  "I would veto anything that delays providing the security and the certainty of health care being available now," - Biden  And that's something totally different than your misquote.
Even more of a reason to vote for Biden
No. That's why Biden will lose.
Joanne, they are in the basement with Biden.
How can Biden win votes in those states? He wants to end coal oil and fracking jobs and raise taxes.
Negative attacks aren't working against Biden. Most educated and informed voters want this cancer out of the White House.
Thirty million dollars for fifty-two states for black and brown businesses, where did you get your calculated from Biden, that is a really small investors amount! I question myself is this the President we want?  #Takenatbirthfrommotherwomb  #Whistleblowerchemicalexposure
Oh you don‚Äôt want to put Trumps gaffes against Biden‚Äôs . . . Even as crazy as Trump can sound, Biden has him beat by far.  To be fair it‚Äôs bc his mind is going, no fault of his own.

Only 3 states got to vote before the DNC decided to coalesce around Biden
Seems disingenuous on her part.  That "I hear stuff about Biden" part sounded eerily like Trump speaking.  For someone known for making bold statements, the milquetoast non-committal is out of character.  This is the prob with some Dems...the ideological purity test they fail.
Why the hell did you put  on the list? He's a Trump advisor who will probably encourage people NOT to vote for Biden.
Biden is a 40+ year Dude - to speak he needs a teleprompter hung around his neck!!!
Obama didn‚Äôt choose Biden as his running mate until August 23rd 2008.
I despise  choice for VP if he chooses her. Biden literally called her out for keeping prisoners in jail pass their sentencing. #BidenHarris2020
Any recovery plan from the Biden Administration that does not make it easier to join unions and for unions to win and enforce contracts should not be just considered a failure, but also a betrayal of Americans who must work for a living.
How Joe Biden‚Äôs surprisingly ambitious climate plan came together
Biden yes
I believe the real Joe Biden has already went bye-bye. I believe this is a clone. Once the real individual dies the clone starts to deteriorate.
Normalize saying that Biden, Schumer &amp; Pelosi aren‚Äôt even real Democrats
Apparently Trump's next themes will be "Biden will make you poor and unemployed" and "elect me and I'll keep poor people out of your beautiful suburban neighborhood." REALLY!?
D.A. Henderson wrote about a time (1957-1958) when Dwight D. Eisenhower was President of the United States.    Obama's response to the swine flu was not to do anything right ... it was just luck, per Biden's campaign advisor, and who worked for Biden in the WH in 2009.
makes smart case for  Helps  win FL, in which case ballgame over. She‚Äôd be a uniquely compelling leader for nat‚Äôl dialogue we must have on police &amp; race. Inoculates against law and order card, given her crime reduction.
Biden campaign: ‚ÄúShit we‚Äôre still not far right enough‚Äù
Biden will respond to Occupy 2.0 the same way Trump will‚Äîliterally the only difference is that having Trump in office normalizes open contempt for the establishment, further opening our window to connect everyone‚Äôs material conditions to the neoliberal policy which causes them
I mean I can probably dig up a supercut showcasing Biden‚Äôs clear cognitive decline over the past few years, and it will almost certainly be incredibly easy to do
The fact that we‚Äôve had disaster capitalism long before this, and yet corporate media never even remotely acknowledged it under eight years of Obama, should tell you everything you need to know about how completely the abuses of a Biden administration will be summarily ignored
I don‚Äôt know if you realize it but you‚Äôre making the same point I am  Corporate media‚Äôs stranglehold over the narrative dictates who we can &amp; cannot criticize, and they clearly have no interest in us criticizing Biden, now or during his presidency
Biden doesn't even have to campaign we're just sitting back and watching Trump destroy himself &amp; the repuke party.

Just got polled for the 3rd time this month. Lot's of questions about Biden's positions. I don't remember if I ever disagreed with every proposal or position before. I'm polled regularly and never remember disagreeing on everything a candidate stands for.
Biden would be a worse president than even Obambam!  Even if for only six months, just think of the lying, conieving scum that the DNC/CCP would put in the VP seat.  Vote R.E.D. This November!
What is he gaslighting? Are you suggesting these are ‚Äúpeaceful protests‚Äù and not the riots that they are or that Biden won‚Äôt be interviewed unless scripted softball questions from a left leaning interviewer because she is right about both.
If you‚Äôre gung ho against Trump then Biden‚Äôs VP pick ought not to matter. If Biden‚Äôs VP pick really matters, why?
Bernie sanders is going to vote for Biden He will campaign for Biden His followers will vote for Biden  Sanders supporters will not flock to trump just because Harris is the ticket

A Biden- Harris ticket will likely defeat Trump. Odds are not so sure for other combinations.
Count me as one of the Biden voters who would never accept a Trump victory, whether it's by mail-in ballots or not. His dire warnings of the most rigged election in history are transparent reminders - and predictors - of his own clear intentions to make it just that.
I am voting for Biden, not a consensus presidency. I trust Biden, and I respect his experience and intellect.  He will choose the VP who he will feel most comfortable working with to actualize *his* vision for the country.
That is why  would have none of that wait your turn &amp; sit obediently in the corner till we call on you, crap. She‚Äôs declaring her WORTH! But ol‚Äô school Biden &amp; his estab network of Dodd et al can‚Äôt deal. Misogyny ain‚Äôt just a Trump, R thing, guys. We got work to do!
Tammy Duckworth Is Nothing and Everything Like Joe Biden   I really do like her. She is of the people and for the people.
I‚Äôve got news for you all. Signing your medical bills with ‚ÄúSettle for Biden‚Äù will still leave you on the hook for medical care you can‚Äôt afford.
Unlike Joe Biden who‚Äôs nepotism only makes hundreds of millions of dollars for his family in every country he sets foot in, and oh by the way, think there might be some strings attached to the$1.4 billion China ‚Äúinvested‚Äù with Hunter Biden‚Äôs startup?
Fabulous thread. Most informative info and insightful.  Thanks for sharing. Hope Biden team reaches out to you.
This is where  should jump in and publicly tell everyone this is his decision to make, and attempts to torpedo any of the fine candidates will not serve anyone‚Äôs cause.
Interesting. What national emergency will President Biden declare and divert money to?
I understand why Biden chose to wait. Unless he is floating the VP rumors, it's irresponsible for MSNBC to prime the audience and create its own narratives. I often feel like I'm watching cable news' version of The Bachelor.   I think there are other stories starving 4 attention.
Can you see Biden doing this? Walking by himself,  talking to reporters,  and then walking to the copter? I don't.
Biden and Harris win. Other combinations, not so probable.
Take a breath Ms Reid. Biden will make the right decision for him. Would it change your vote?
Yes they are aware but not of Joe Biden. They are aware of the pestulance that has invaded the Whitehouse and Senate and all will be taken care of on November 3rd.
Biden wrote that bill. Are people gonna realize Biden isnt the answer.
as far as John Lewis lets rename that Bridge  "John R. Lewis FORMERLY etc. etc. keep BOTH names but John's on top LARGER, showing the defeat of Hate ! and many of us are looking forward to your 3rd Term as Pres. with Biden as your speaker.
She attacked Biden on race in the debate--way below the belt. If she feels that way about him, she shouldn't want to his VP.  BIDEN picked Dodd to help with the search. He is giving his best advice.  And the other choices are women (some black), so Jen's claim makes no sense.
What about the debates? Trump could destroy Biden or vice versa. Either could self-destruct. 3 Presidential, 1 VP. Do you or your experts have any ideas on this?
What about the debates? Trump could destroy Biden- or himself - or Biden could destroy himself- or Trump. Sept 29 and 1 per week for 3 weeks- Oct 7 is VP
FUCK TRUMP! Don‚Äôt put all of your faith in Biden eitherüò≠üíØ
I‚Äôd rather see Val Demings in the role. Yes I agree. Biden already has California and the West Coast
Joe biden is dangerous.  His anti-school choice position hurts minorities.  His green new deal love of anti fracking hurts America.  His lack of a brain hurts all of us.  Obama is a political hack , too.
My heart and prayers go out to the poor misinformed viewers of CNN who are subjected daily to the attempt to manufacture news that will benefit biden and hurt Trump.  May God help them learn the truth and think for themselves.
This is the same  beyatch who said voting for Biden is like eating shit and she has the nerve to be upset.
I‚Äôll still take him over Biden!!
Not defending Trump's twitter fubar, and his need to hone in his message. I  just realized the most important election monitor still predicts a Trump win. the market would be down 10k points if Biden waa leading.
People who say they‚Äôve been ‚Äúa lifetime republican‚Äù but are voting for Joe Biden, join the club...I‚Äôve been a lifetime democrat and I‚Äôm voting for Joe Biden, too. Suck it up, we‚Äôre trying to save our country
It‚Äôs not immaterial, it‚Äôs actually a fairly significant issue that gets to a fundamental question about Democrats in general and Biden in particular‚Äîif it‚Äôs so important to beat Trump, why aren‚Äôt they behaving like they actually want to win by supporting wildly popular policies
Then we can at the very least agree that the primary wasn‚Äôt any sort of referendum on policy &amp; finally put to bed this idea that Bernie lost because nobody likes any of his proposals  So if it‚Äôs that important to defeat Trump, why isn‚Äôt Biden supporting such a popular idea as M4A
There is no coalition of Bernie supporters and Biden &amp; Democrats, because Biden &amp; the Democrats haven‚Äôt made any effort to build such a coalition, and in fact are just as vocal as they were in 2016 about how they are deliberately courting Republicans instead of the left
I think this may be the ticket. Biden has to eventually bow out.
Lincoln Project co-founder says if Trump loses he‚Äôll ditch Biden‚Äôs inauguration and regard it as ‚Äòillegitimate‚Äô -
How about getting Durham up to light speed so maybe Biden will be exposed as a criminal since it seems most republicans are prepared to stand by and POTUS get steamrolled the Dems and MSM?
Oh please . . . Outside of the pandemic which couldn‚Äôt have been stopped no matter the admin, the country was doing great before hand.  And when he wins in Nov, he‚Äôll get the economy back to where he had it prior to the pandemic.  Please no Biden.  Pleassssse.
The sad thing about Joe Biden, he doesn't even know he's being used by the party he trusted for so many years... üá∫üá∏
I hope Biden donates all those hydrocychloroquine doses sitting in the stockpile to people that actually need it.
chose Biden because they believed, accurately or not, that he was the best candidate to do so, OR voters chose Biden because they saw the election as a referendum on Bernie‚Äôs policies &amp; categorically rejected them
And of course it wasn‚Äôt‚Äîpeople voted for Biden because party leadership paraded every prominent neoliberal Democrat out to line up behind Joe &amp; sell the public on the idea that this ancient racist in clear cognitive decline was their best shot at beating Trump
And Biden.. I mean AOC and his puppet masters are champing at the bit to shut it down. HOW THE FUCK ARE PEOPLE SUPPORTING THE INSANITY OF IT?!?!?
No Biden is just as bad as what we have now, just in a somewhat different way
You‚Äôve spent the past eight or nine months watching in real time how shamelessly corporate media can and does reframe or outright ignore whatever information is inconvenient for the wealthy elites‚Äô preferred narrative‚Äîwhy would any of that change under Biden
For 50 years Joe Biden has been a China Lapdog. He would probably sell his mother, daughter and wife to China for money.
We had decades of imbecile presidents who let the entire midwest hollow out our manufacturing base. And you put this on trump? So much derangement in u. You should question the corrupt crook china lapdog Biden. He took his useless son Hunter to china to solicit for hedge funds.
Biden does it, so... Racist!
He is on par with a Biden as per his mental status
I hope Joe Biden will be safe from the Don-Trump Flu because it is fighting like hell insude my heart.
There is nothing compelling people to protest with some wilding out in these places.   If they take the bait, it's their fault--they are enabling their oppressor.  It's easy to stay home, help slow the spread, and do what you can to stop the violence--which is to ELECT BIDEN!
Oh look who wants to import drugs from Canada now!? Taking a cue from Bernie I guess. Too bad Biden is too selfish to have added this to the platform. Now look...

Just saw a add Biden claiming that he help Americans and home owners with there mortgages during the mortgage crisis. Obama and Joe did nothing ask the the people across the country speak up people Obama and Joe the Do nothing president and VP. I will vote no on Joe.
That means if Biden wins, Susan Rice will be President of the United States sooner than latter. Biden will be the first  president to be forced to step down due to mental defect. God help us!! GOP will lose because they are so f‚Äîing CHEAP!  Thanks Rand Paul and others like you!!

If Biden wins they will be our law and order.
I think if Biden wins they will do away with our Government system and Constitution.
Man, all those people who hate the word JUNKIE are gonna hate this clip of Joe Biden asking a journalist if he is a junkie.

By not voting for Joe Biden you're voting for Trump.
Trump will use emergency powers to remain in the White House if he loses election, warns House majority whip
If Trump is a cuckoo then Biden should win.  Am I right?   Kinda doesn‚Äôt matter what side your on, the debates is going to be a fun one.

The choice is binary. The choice is clear. Four more years of Trump, the ConMan sociopath, or four years of Biden. No other choice. If you don‚Äôt vote or vote for a third-party candidate, it‚Äôs a vote for ConMan Don
Biden could pick Tom Cotton and he would still be the better choice!

WOW Joe Biden being led by his handlers so he doesn‚Äôt stop to answer questions which would show he is completely incompetent and mentally unstable.  If Biden wins, radical liberal socialists will be controlling him!
Will President Biden be there?
Can we apply that rule to tax policy? Republicans pay taxes based on Trump‚Äôs policy, Dems pay taxes based on Biden‚Äôs policy. And once you vote, you‚Äôre locked in to the corresponding rate. Wonder how many people would change their votes if that was the rule?
That is who I said all along would be Biden‚Äôs pick (or rather his handlers pick) There is not much to chose from, but AT LEAST she is much better looking than Biden and you can‚Äôt say that about some of the other choices!!üòÇüòÇ

The Dem hacks are always screeching at us, "Not voting for Biden is a vote for Trump!!" Yet it seems every time Biden opens his mouth HE'S a vote for Trump! His handlers need to lock him in a crypt until election day, since he's hellbent on self-destruction....

Biden is catholic and goes to church
That appears to be a very biased conclusion. And your analogy has no basis in reality. Please show me any evidence in any debate where Biden has not performed well let alone being hunted as if he were prey.
Are you so gullible to think that Biden is more succeptible to this strategy than the current president. I can‚Äôt count how many times Trump has gotten so upset in a press conference that he simply just walked out.
Biden, is that the same thing you said today, that all Black‚Äôs are all the same. No diversity in Black people. Your a racist but you do hide it well.
They‚Äôre only funny because of the person she is mocking. I watched a couple and I don‚Äôt get why they are funny. And I‚Äôm not even close to a Trump supporter. If anyone decided to do this to Biden, they would be called names for it. Just hack comedy

This is a made up story, but not surprisingly, the only reason GOP has to support #TrumpThreatensAmerica by way of scare tactics. #Trump already raised our deficit by $3Trillion. Maybe GOP is confusing that with Biden.

This is a completely dumb take. First the reporter is Jake Tapper of CNN. Secondly the campaign monitors the time on each interview to maximize the exposure to multiple media outlets.

To quote  "Fire every single one of these people" in Congress, especially Pelosi and Schumer.  ...but to not-quote Krystal, "fire [them] into the troposphere"  srsly, they're really trying to kneecap Biden even more by letting Trump run to the Dems' left aren't they

Here is the big difference from this intelligence report:  1. Dems believe it and Joe Biden will NOT encourage/accept support from China and Iran.  2. Republicans will deny Russia is trying to help Donald Trump, but Trump will gladly accept the Kremlin's help.  This is 2020.

So, it‚Äôs Russia writing the notes Biden reads off of in his basement?  ‚ÄúAre you a junkie‚Äù ha those crazy Russians.
I don't want my president to have any religion. Biden is a soulless corporate tool. I'm not surprised he "faith".

I would like to apologize for the really lousy take I had in this thread. I'm leaving it up so folks can see it but I want to be clear that my option to support Biden no matter who the VP choice is, is a result of my race and gender and that is a terrible take. I'll do better.
That's not exactly correct. The vast majority eligible primary voters, including black voters didn't get a chance to vote when there was an actual competitive race.   But in terms of making amends, Biden at the debates didn't seem that motivated to de-criminalize weed.
No, it isn't. None of those people speak for the Chinese Communist Party. In any case, China has been economically weakened by Trump (and other nations) bringing jobs and industry home. China's leaders want a return to the pre-Trump status quo, which Biden represents.

The fact that Biden touches little kids and sexually assaults women should have been a red üö© for you people, no?
If 70,000 die in the next 3 months you can certainly believe Biden will be elected President.

Except that Trump will twist that and try to make Biden look like he‚Äôs ‚Äúchickening‚Äù our, when in fact that would be an escape hatch for Trump.  I say, force the debate.  Trump will reveal how far worse he is now, than he was 4 years ago ... and he was shockingly awful, then.

Biden, Trump works harder than you ever did through your whole career. Let‚Äôs face it your not mentally fit to be President. You will totally destroy this country, listening to the Socialist that you have attach yourself to.
Biden, Democrats have been talking about racism for decades, and what have the done they promise the Blacks the world, but they do absolutely nothing to help them. They use Blacks like pawns just to get their vote.
You would voting for the ruination of this country. Anarchy will be rampant throughout America, Biden is not mentally fit to be President.

Republicans push Kanye 2020. But will it really hurt Biden?
I'll do you one better.   My biggest concern (assuming Biden wins) is that, by failing to implement left-leaning policies that could destroy Trumpism root &amp; branch, Biden loses to fitter/happier/more productive Trump 2.0 in 2024.    &amp; that's when fascist nightmare REALLY begins.
His entire early career took off because he had housing integration as one of his primary policies which endeared him to the black voters of DE.  Several references throughout the article.   Again, not a fan of his busing stance, but the facts don't lie.
Definitely not wanting to debate which group is more diverse, I am just disappointed in Biden making the comparison. I feel it's a legitimate concern he needs to respect the diversity of thought in the black community, and this isn't the first time. Hoping he will finally grow.
That was my question. How can trump continue to assert exec priv after he‚Äôs out of office if Biden says to McGahn that nothing he might testify to is privileged?
dude. if biden said it instead of trump - even in a theoretically identical context - you‚Äôd be hooting and howling that his brain is broken. (you‚Äôd be 100% correct. biden‚Äôs brain is a dumpster fire!)  so just admit you are reflexively being a lapdog making excuses for trump.
No one who would vote for Kanye was ever going to vote to begin with, let alone vote for Biden.
Didn't read the article. Shame on you. It cites that maybe Russia wants Trump and maybe China wants Biden. And that Iran doesn't really care they just want disruption. Maybe. Its really just a bunch of maybes under a scary headline.

Both are poor choices. However political necessity demands that we remove Trump ASAP. Biden is the only choice. This demonstrates the bankruptcy of the political system which depends on stupidity and ignorance to elect a government!

Joe Biden said he‚Äôll increase the funding for police AND said that Black people are not diverse.   Instead of allowing people to voice concerns yall are reminding people to vote for him.   Stop making demands from Black voters. Make DEMANDS from  . This isn‚Äôt acceptable.
I think major problem with kamala harris is that no one actually likes her as we saw when she didn't even make it to Iowa and  was losing in her home state. She's definitely moderate/conservative though and biden IS courting the Republican vote so maybe she the best for that.
If Biden could hurt God, that would mean he's more powerful than God and that He needs our protection (by voting for trumpy), right?
Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden faces new scrutiny over how he discusses race and ethnicity after drawing distinctions between Black and Latino populations in the United States.
I just hate how comfortable we‚Äôve made Joe Biden. At least Hillary felt some pressure to be more progressive with certain policies. Obviously most of us were still voting for her but there was more accountability to me.
Trump: You gotta watch out with Biden, he‚Äôs gonna raise your taxes, form a vanguard of the people, he wants to find and kill god folks!  Biden: Listen here Jack universal healthcare is for the birds and all black people are the same. Cmon man the US is running like a ‚Äò69 Impala

Biden wins and the gop gets torn into two between trumps band of morons and republicans then the progressives should just learn from Bernie about raising money and create a new party.
Stop. You can't be that naive. ü§® Blind Trusts.  Hm, Bill Clinton did not have sex... Hm, Mitt Romney had nothing to do w/Bain Capital... Hm, Bloomberg did not have a toxic...   Politicians lie. Biden's lied more than many &amp; even now, screws us over.

I think there's a difference between criticizing Biden for the next four years and criticizing him for the next three months.  There are a lot of disaffected supporters of other candidates and some Republicans who sort of want to vote for Joe, but it won't take much to deter them
As for history, don't post something praising Biden when he has not done a single thing to work towards the goals you claim he's in favor of. That shows a lack of historical knowledge.
Instead of continuously assuring Joe Biden that he has our vote we need to pressure him for better policies. Nobody is entitled to a vote.   And if anybody says that ‚ÄúTrump is worse‚Äù Im going to block you. BIDEN needs better policies.
Here‚Äôs hoping that Biden doesn‚Äôt choose Palin as his VP. ‚Ä¶heh.
A. Biden is hiding in his basement. It's a fact. You don't have to be a Trump supporter to want him to be more involved in his own campaign. B. It is Trump Derangement Syndrome to want war just to spite Trump, which is what you want.  Facts aren't attacks.
These Biden hulu commercials dont even talk about anything theyre so fucking pointless lol
Dream on President Tutts she could run this country better than you getting a pedicure and a new hair do at the same time. Yes, she is a beauty. Too bad you're not. Biden 2020

Joe Biden needs to just stop talking about Black people

for Biden they are gaffs for trump he is a racist. Yeah we see you
Biden is neither a bigot or a racist as you have been your entire life. You are the worse President for African Americans since Andrew Johnson.
Unlike some past nominees, I don't think Biden needs a VP to cover a particular portfolio.  He has the depth and  breadth of experience in both foreign and domestic affairs. Not like some Governors who ran (most recently W.) who needed to shore up foreign policy credentials.

Yes. I think they are taking advantage of people's trauma wrt Trump to move as far neoliberal as possible under the radar bc they are betting on negative partisanship to carry Biden through no matter what he does. It's odious.

What a scoop! Joe Biden's views on abortion are in line with the majority of American Catholics. Shocking!
Biden shouldn‚Äôt debate unless Trump releases his last ten year of taxes. Period.
Twitter world! Seriously this is not a joke or an attack. Biden has a mental disability. You don't have to be an expert or a doctor to see it. Just listen to his interviews and speeches...sad to see. If he debates Trump in that mental state he is doomed.
If you can't help get Trump out of office,  then shut the fuck up and stop putting nothing but negativity about Joe Biden out there. DO YOU WANT TRUMP FOR 4 MORE YEARS??? ILL WAITü§îü§îü§îü§îü§î

Hopefully calling Biden godless is enough for America. Trump is desperate &amp;, as he did during his campaign,will say every &amp; anything he can to try to win reelection. Trump doesnt counterpunch, he simply lies.He lied yesterday,he lied today &amp; will lie tomorrow. He is a liar. Vote.
I don't want to hear about another Biden gaffe. I can't get flown out to Greece or Tanzania for Yacht Week because of Trump's incompetence and commitment to skullduggery. Biden has slips of the tongue but Trump's slip of character is deadly.
The press Corp should ask Trump to state the verses of the Bible that Biden is‚Äòhurting‚Äô.
Trump is desperate &amp; all his rhetoric is directed at his right wing base. We know Biden is a spiritual individual &amp; beliefs shouldn‚Äôt be part of the race. But, we are talking about an individual who paid prostitutes, bribes people, steals &amp; he is casting stones?
Hey    Does Joe Biden have the power to hurt you?   Asking for the few million who believe Trump‚Äôs horseshit.. ü§£

Apparently Joe Biden can hurt God.  Me:

Biden can hurt God, ey? So does that make Biden God if he's more powerful than God? Does Biden know this? How does Trump know?
Biden‚Äôs an Atheist? Yay!

Please. People that listen to this maniac. Do your DD and do your own research. Joe Biden was in office for 8yrs and he never tried to take anybody‚Äôs guns. He‚Äôs a believer in god who dealt with so much heartache is life.
Do we really care about what maybe 1% of GOP voters think? Please let‚Äôs not cater to the interests of people having a hard time choosing between Joe Biden and a sociopath ushering in the rapid decline of our country.

I can actually see someone supporting a democrat but Joe Biden is not the best candidate for the job, and if he‚Äôs the best you got I really feel sorry for you.
You get two choices, and the choices are Biden and Trump. If Biden's VP can sway you one way or the other, you're okay with voting for Trump.
Joe Biden, forming like Voltron (in this case, "Voltron" is Robespierre, Lenin, John Brown, and AOC)
Give me a break with your pearl clutching. I‚Äôm so tired of conservative pundits like yourself decrying everything this President has done out of moral decency, but not having the moral decency yourself to see Biden is simply the better pick for the future of the nation.
The democrats treat religious organizations as hate groups. Look what Biden did to The Little Sisters of the Poor.  Don‚Äôt be fooled by the dems when they start quoting bible verses at election time.
Sure you don‚Äôt mean Joe Biden CCP sweet deals for his son and family for years!

Why does Joe Biden make it so hard for himself? Why?
Biden can‚Äôt recite his location.
You are literally the one redefining this,  making this deeper than it needs to be. I guarantee you when Biden said political views he was simply thinking dem or repub. Thats how simplistic they see us. Are you a dem or repub. Becuase that‚Äôs all that matters to them
Agree with you. Biden I‚Äôm voting for whether debating or not
Dude, something like 89% of black people vote for Democrats. Yes I know there‚Äôs a generational divide when it comes to progressive vs liberal, but the fact is the large majority of black people support the democrat party and thusly Joe Biden.
Listen, I would have more respect for you all if you just said I‚Äôm supporting Trump. By saying Biden will not get my vote for whatever reason is a bit disingenuous. Where was this movement and outcry during the Clinton, Bush and Obama years?
I feel like you‚Äôre jumping the gun on this one. We all know Biden is a silly old man but what he said, in the context of political views, is objectively true
Biden said in March that he would veto M4A if it passed both houses. Then he said he opposed single-payer in spite of the pandemic.  This month, he said having a running mate who supported M4A would be "a real problem."
üëç It is extremely important that Biden have the opportunity that McDonald didn‚Äôt allow President Obama with Court selections. Democrats have to make sure that they don‚Äôt let republicans sidetrack them. They should also see if they can remove last 2 choices.

I'm sure that political consultants think that way, but I'm skeptical that‚Äîexcept in extreme cases‚Äîthe veep choice actually affects the ticket's chances. (Sure, Biden probably shouldn't pick Farrakhan.) I'm also skeptical that the effect is knowable in advance‚Äîor even retrospect.

Vote Biden, not Trump.
The reality on the ground is the DNC rigged the primaries to make Biden the nominee.
Yes, he was going to win. He still had a path to the nomination as of April 7. I still love &amp; respect Bernie &amp; recognize his accomplishments, but I'm not voting for Biden. I'm voting Green.
When you have liberals aka Democrats running the state what do you expect! Biden will make things even worse.
Yes. I never loved Biden, but what we have now is intolerable.
Yes, which is also part of their plan. If Biden wins, why leave him anything to build on.
Hot tempered Biden caught in a lie and exploded. Joe Biden tells factory worker ‚Äòyou‚Äôre full of s---‚Äô during a tense argument over guns.
Trump is right. No √Åfrican American in their right mind will vote for Biden after repeatedly disrespects the intelligence of the Black community.
Media coddles Biden campaign. We‚Äùhope‚Äù he says. if it was a Republican, they‚Äôd have daily counting graphics on 24/7 cable news about how  many days the unaccountable GOP has not said yes to an interview
I think Meadows and Mnuchen walk away, feeling 1.8 million new jobs will be enough to sustain the economy. Also, making it difficult for Biden to start out with an economy that is stuck in the mud.
No African American should vote for Biden after those disparaging remarks
Biden will be fine if he is not constantly apologizing. Allow the man to be!!! There is no perfection !!!

Fun fact: the same lefties defending Biden's "Catholicism" will accuse any conservative Buddhist in America of "not being a real Buddhist," even though the religion is actually pretty conservative in Asia. Biden is Catholic only on Easter and Christmas.
Why is it the same leftists defending Biden and saying "hey, he's Catholic, so he can't hate the Bible" are the same people who say I'm "not a real Buddhist" because I'm right-wing? Biden is one of those Easter Catholics who just does it out of habit, not faith

Trump, Who Once Declined to Name His Favorite Bible Verse, Accuses Biden of Being ‚ÄòAgainst God‚Äô
Joe Biden believes all African Americans think alike. Which is more damaging a mispronunciation or a foolish assumption?
He dropped out before half the states voted! That's a huge problem. And he wasn't doing badly; that was a false narrative perpetrated by the msm. The difference in delegate count between him &amp; Biden wasn't that great. Voting by mail would have kept people safe.
Biden's big strength is young people who have HAD IT with Trump.  As JFK said under very different circumstances, The torch has been passed to a new generation of Americans. And they want Joe.  Not Bernie or any other "progressives." Real progress from people who get things done.
Biden could nominate Jose Altuve for Vice President and have David Ortiz as his Chief of Staff, and I would still vote for him.
Biden is gonzo! What a flat out racist!
Joe Biden has said there are "a number of women who are qualified to be president tomorrow." That's an understatement.   In the latest for    &amp;  challenge any doubts that women are the VP list are up to the job.
Biden may fall into the Clinton trap of picking someone who they like personally, rather than someone who may help them politically. All in all though, I like Rice. Cheney served a few terms in Congress, so I‚Äôm not sure if using past precedents apply today.
Some people don‚Äôt need the debates to vote their conscience, Mr. President.   And let‚Äôs face it. You won‚Äôt be debating Biden anyway. You‚Äôll find some excuse.
But since it will come from a government run by Trump, no one but the idiots will trust it.  Come January 20, if Biden says we can trust it, we will.
This might help Biden win South Dakota.

That doesn‚Äôt make any sense. If Trump starts lying why can‚Äôt Biden expose the lies Trump is telling. Why run and hide.
I completely agree that the country is way more conservative than many of us are willing to accept. I think Biden ultimately would have bested Buttigieg and Klobuchar, and Bernie has never had much luck with black voters. I think this probably would have happened in the end.
I guarantee that if Biden wins the Democrats who are leaning towards a Socialist America will aggressively strip away our American rights. From taking our right bare arms, to conservative speech, and forced vaccinations that will kill a large portion of the population.
New story on NPR: Biden Shares New Details Of His Plan For Overturning President Trump's Agenda
Typical Trumpster, can't do your own research. Here's one source of what transpired. If you don't trust it, look up your own.
Biden was clearly and without doubt carrying out the policy of the United States at the direction of the president. Not to mention that many countries expressed concern about this prosecuter and wanted him fired too. Keep trying.
Biden: "C'mon man, I don't need to talk or come out of my basement. I'm leading in the polls, man"!
I adored Warren, but I think that the party is far more centrist than a lot of us thought. Biden kind of just had to be his boring, middling self, and once black voters got their say, it was all over but the shoutin'.

More jobs created in last 3 years of Obama Biden than first three of Trump. Trump was riding, not guiding, the galloping Economic Horse inherited from Obama Biden as Black Americans gained jobs alongside others as Trump kept boosting White Supremacists. Short answer: Not a thing!
Biden close to 51% in many Polls with Trump at 41%. At 52% Buden wins easily with 335 Electoral Votes. At 53% it is Landslide with Electoral at 400! That‚Äôs how numbers work  because so many are Red and Blue States and only 6 are Battleground with another 4 making a Landslide!
I haven't turned on Bernie. I still love him. I just think he made a mistake and will not follow him down the Biden road.

For the Socialists Democrats there is a reason not to have a debate. A debate exposes Biden as being mentally incompetent and a Socialist.

And yet Republicans like John Kasich are voting for Biden because egos were hurt.
They are purposely creating a problem by impairing Postal Operations. Biden voters best act real Early, as soon as Early Voting begins in each State in September and October.
Trump henchmen are the ones impairing the Postal Operations to slow down Mail In Ballots. They are trying to create a problem that did not exist before! Best way is to start early and get all Biden voters to request, obtain and Mail In the Ballots as soon as Early voting begins.
What equal rights? Equal protection? What did Obama and Biden do you help the situation in eight years! Biden 40 years?? All Obama did was cause more racial discord instead of saying what they can be! Learn from the past,  worry about now and the future!
He didn‚Äôt lose Washington state. And people wouldn‚Äôt have died if they voted by mail. By your logic, Biden also should have dropped out to save lives.
So, "Vote for Biden even if there isn't a good reason to vote for him. Just vote against the other candidate" Democrats trying to attract votes not because of merit of its candidates, plan, resources or strategy, but because their rival is awful. Sad having to vote this days..
No, he wasn't "losing in large numbers." Yes, there was major voter suppression and election rigging. Why do you value Biden's voters more than Bernie's? Bernie should have advocated vote by mail instead of disenfranchising half the states that had not yet held their primaries.
LOL! Yeah,. because the "unnamed Chinese officials" are really going to be honest. Biden literally said China is great and asked "are they gonna eat out lunch?" Plus, he's pretty anti-Taiwan. He would be a dream come true for China.
So you are implying that in the second picture Biden is kneeling for the national anthem?? Love how you cropped that photo
You aren‚Äôt pro Biden, you‚Äôre just anti trump. Wake up America
They wouldn't die. He should have stayed in &amp; told his supporters to vote by mail only, unlike Biden who wrongly told his supporters that asymptomatic people can go to the polls safely without transmitting the virus. And Bernie was not "losing in large numbers."

You are an ANTIFA member! Let me ask you why the destruction and burning of businesses? Why if I wear a Trump hat you would harass me! When you wear a Biden hat, I would think let the better man win! But that is okay you are totally right to support who you want!  Take care! ü§ó
Biden's plan to achieve net-zero emissions, economy-wide, by 2050. We can, in the process, create millions of good-paying jobs that provide workers with the choice to join a union and bargain collectively with their employers.
The Trump has been masterminding a plan not only for improved healthcare, but a return to leadership on the world stage, action on climate change and other issues. It is the election of Joe Biden to replace his chaotic leadership
Think about it this way, if you don't vote Biden/whomever, you will put another conservative on the SC.
2016 was a referendum on Obama 3rd term. So DNC tries same strategy by choosing Biden in 2020. #BubbleLiving
He died before they finally got around to making that remake of "Cocoon". Which is surprising, because the Biden/Sanders debate looked like an open casting call for it.  RIP
Yeah... I‚Äôm not sure you‚Äôre gonna want to see Biden supporters.   #DUMMY
The only way you get a ‚Äúwell prepared‚Äù Biden is to hop into your Delorean and go back a few decades!
What are the odds that Trump will start obsessively going after Biden's named VP pick,  and forget that he is supposed to be running against Joe?
If you think this nonsense is bad now. If Biden gets election this will be 10 times worst. Forced vaccinations, Forced mask wearing and the eroding away of our constitutional rights.
Biden has gone through the vetting when he was chosen VP. He understands that no matter who is chosen, Press will go to work and dissect that Person the moment they are chosen! For that reason everyone has to get ready. There is also advantage in timing it 1st week of August.
Joe Biden doesn‚Äôt even know what day it is. Luke 50 years in Washington and 8 as VP.

Seriously I don't care for Biden but whoever on his campaign team thought of that phrase is a genius. Obv still voting for him.
I wouldn't be surprised if Biden gets worse, but then we have Trump who thinks we had airports during the revolutionary war. That's nowhere near Biden's misspeaks. As bad as Biden is I'd love to see him go against Trump in more invasive cognitive evaluations.
Regarding Biden's VP pick, whomever she may be: We Dems must stop eating each other alive. As for me, he could pick absolutely anyone and it wouldn't change my mind about voting for him.

Trump is very scacy.He keeps causing damage that will take years to repair. The hearts of the familys who lost loved ones are forever broken.He just  doesnt care about the people.He only cares about himself.This isnt about an election it is a pandemic.People over politics #Biden
Washington Post isn't an undisclosed organization, but ok. Can't wait for November for Biden to take over and disclose EVERYTHING republicans were covering up the past 4 years
Joe Biden said you ain‚Äôt black if you don‚Äôt vote for him. And as much as I hate to say it, he‚Äôs right üòî
He bullied Bernie Sanders into quitting prematurely, effectively disenfranchising half the states that had not yet had their primaries. For that, I will never forgive him &amp; will never vote for Biden. #VoteGreen2020
Don‚Äôt be ignorant. Bernie won the first three states + the largest state in the union. His momentum was squashed by the entire DNC (save for warren) coalescing around Biden before Super Tuesday after his SC (which don‚Äôt forget was helped by Clyburn)
Most of us don't care for Biden, but still prefer him over Trump, and the polls show. Even Fox News polls show Trump getting decimated. And hmm what's worse, a couple anarchists rioting with 99% being innocent, or police actually destroying more property and beating protesters?

Win big!! Don't even worry about it. Biden is doing everything to lose and so are the Dems.
Omar's, Biden is going off script, due to his cognitive decline.
Tha't fine, but if you keep working to prevent any kind of Democrat from winning offices, as you have been, you will never achieve any of those thing, because God knows no Republican will ever agree to them.  So, will you grow up and help Biden win the presidency?
Biden is neither a bigot or a racist as you have been your entire life. You are the worse President for African Americans since Andrew Johnson.

The moderates at the debates will tear Trump apart. Biden just have to give him all the ropes let him hang himself with it...
He can stay in the WH. Once Biden is sworn in, Trump will be removed by the secret service.
Biden might not be all there but you are completely gone
Joe Biden didn‚Äôt make news when he disclosed his belief that ‚Äúblacks aren‚Äôt diverse.‚Äù He merely revealed the plantation mindset that has sadly stood the test of time with the Democrat party.

Really? It shouldn‚Äôt. You sh I‚Äôll take one hard look at one of the other guy‚Äôs recent media appearances and know within seconds that you‚Äôre voting for Biden no matter what. You should think about the Constituion and the rights of Americans that‚Äôs don‚Äôt look like you and know.
yeah because biden‚Äôs policies actually hurt minorities, unlike all of trump‚Äôs policies
i‚Äôve seen this before, it‚Äôs fake news mostly, vote for segregationist all black people think alike biden if you want someone pure of prejudice
you haven‚Äôt produced one example, you‚Äôre incapable of doing so, he said they were guilty because black or you pulled out of your ass? and you won‚Äôt ever find an example as racist as biden was this morning saying all black people think the same
And Biden is a better option???
Instead, go with this: "...whose actions are completely at odds with the values and teachings of *my faith.*" It transitions into the following paragraph where Biden contrasts his faith and values from Trump's actions without the implication that Trump is "faking" it.
Show me the statements, speeches or documents where Biden has said these things. Otherwise it‚Äôs fake news.
Y‚Äôall keep shaming Biden and ppl will see it and decide not to vote for anyone and then boom üí•   We got Trump dumbass for another 4 yrs.

Hey Carl..what do you think about Biden saying the African American community isn't diverse enough?
Biden wants better for America while you‚Äôre destroying America each day
Sadly Biden is the best option in this situation
You are literally the one redefining this,  making this deeper than it needs to be. I guarantee you when Biden said political views he was simply thinking dem or repub. Thats how simplistic they see us. Are you a dem or repub. Becuase that‚Äôs all that matters to them
Dude, something like 89% of black people vote for Democrats. Yes I know there‚Äôs a generational divide when it comes to progressive vs liberal, but the fact is the large majority of black people support the democrat party and thusly Joe Biden.
I feel like you‚Äôre jumping the gun on this one. We all know Biden is a silly old man but what he said, in the context of political views, is objectively true
I'm sure that political consultants think that way, but I'm skeptical that‚Äîexcept in extreme cases‚Äîthe veep choice actually affects the ticket's chances. (Sure, Biden probably shouldn't pick Farrakhan.) I'm also skeptical that the effect is knowable in advance‚Äîor even retrospect.
Biden is off his rocker

You are down 15 points nationally to Biden with 3 months till the election.   America is gonna savor the moment watching you lose, watching you fail, watching you leave the White House that you never belonged in.   And you will never be missed.
I'm only voting Biden to get rid of the absolute SHITSHOW in the office right now. The following election I'll be looking for other candidates with a more progressive platform than "return to a pre-orange toddler era".

Fair enough.. tell you what, I‚Äôll follow you and if Biden wins, you‚Äôll be my first tweet..
He didn't cheat the last election. He won because Wikileaks Exposed Hillary Clinton. Which the leaker was found dead soon after. Let just hope Biden is clean. Which I truly believe they could have came up with a better candidate.
Btw is that the name of a high quality nursing home that has a vacancy due to the deaths caused by democrat governors? About time Biden gets some rest to clear his head!!

Oh I agree with her. Democrats like Biden are why we‚Äôre where we‚Äôre at. Her method is suspect and it‚Äôs designed to suppress the vote by discouraging people.What‚Äôs bizarre is your way of thinking and you failures throughout the many years in politics. Trump came in no history of politics, decided to fight for this country instead of living his life comfortably beyond most can do. That‚Äôs a patriot! Unlike pay for prez Obama/Biden
I keep trying to get this across to my friends - they need Biden to lose. They need things to get much worse, because it's the only way they have a chance to win.   The Lincoln Project people are going to be more useful to winning this than the Berners.

Unlike some past nominees, I don't think Biden needs a VP to cover a particular portfolio.  He has the depth and  breadth of experience in both foreign and domestic affairs. Not like some Governors who ran (most recently W.) who needed to shore up foreign policy credentials.

Biden shouldn‚Äôt debate unless Trump releases his last ten year of taxes. Period.
Twitter world! Seriously this is not a joke or an attack. Biden has a mental disability. You don't have to be an expert or a doctor to see it. Just listen to his interviews and speeches...sad to see. If he debates Trump in that mental state he is doomed.

Joe ‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt vote for me you ain‚Äôt Black‚Äù Biden fucked up again? üôÑ
Biden can‚Äôt recite his location.
You are literally the one redefining this,  making this deeper than it needs to be. I guarantee you when Biden said political views he was simply thinking dem or repub. Thats how simplistic they see us. Are you a dem or repub. Becuase that‚Äôs all that matters to them
Dude, something like 89% of black people vote for Democrats. Yes I know there‚Äôs a generational divide when it comes to progressive vs liberal, but the fact is the large majority of black people support the democrat party and thusly Joe Biden.
I feel like you‚Äôre jumping the gun on this one. We all know Biden is a silly old man but what he said, in the context of political views, is objectively true
Biden said in March that he would veto M4A if it passed both houses. Then he said he opposed single-payer in spite of the pandemic.  This month, he said having a running mate who supported M4A would be "a real problem."
So you don‚Äôt like Biden enough to vote for him as president.
I'm sure that political consultants think that way, but I'm skeptical that‚Äîexcept in extreme cases‚Äîthe veep choice actually affects the ticket's chances. (Sure, Biden probably shouldn't pick Farrakhan.) I'm also skeptical that the effect is knowable in advance‚Äîor even retrospect.

Then don‚Äôt vote Biden! He is incoherent
But using joe biden is ok
Trump has much greater fluency and quickness of speech. Biden is hesitant, and when under pressure stutters. Trump will take advantage of that. Biden will do ok though.
There were problems for sure. I'm glad that the progressive movement seems to be in younger, blacker, browner hands since his loss. There was a REAL hard turn against him when he endorsed Biden.
Yeah, me too. I'll be gritting my teeth when filling out the ballot for Biden (Tara Reade) but I'll deal.
All they need is a few friendly state legislatures like FL, PA, NC and WI to refuse to send Biden electors and throw the election to the House, where Trump is re-elected on a 26-22 vote.

I hate to say this but we shouldn‚Äôt retweet, like, or share that Biden video publicly. It‚Äôs bad I know and insulating him isn‚Äôt ideal but we have to. Treat it like a family affair and talk shit in private. The alternative is worse.

Biden didn't win because the "Dem establishment" crushed Sanders or Warren or anybody. He won because a large plurality of Dems actually preferred him. It's amazing how people refuse to believe that others believe differently from them. Most dems didn't want Sanders or Warren.

That's not exactly correct. The vast majority eligible primary voters, including black voters didn't get a chance to vote when there was an actual competitive race.   But in terms of making amends, Biden at the debates didn't seem that motivated to de-criminalize weed.
No, it isn't. None of those people speak for the Chinese Communist Party. In any case, China has been economically weakened by Trump (and other nations) bringing jobs and industry home. China's leaders want a return to the pre-Trump status quo, which Biden represents.

Biden is far, far from perfect‚Äîseriously flawed, in fact‚Äîbut Trump is dangerous, and the scary part is that fascist regimes always come to power with the consent of part of the population and the indifference of another part. (end)
Biden, all your doing is twisting words, you know what you damn said, now your backtracking to save your ass. It‚Äôs to late Joe, the horse is out of the barn.
Biden, your so full of BS it‚Äôs pathetic. Basically what you said, you couldn‚Äôt distinguish one Black Man from another, to you they are all the same. Now that is a racist statement, and you should be held accountable.
I also understand that Biden might possibly be more prone to military conflict than any of us would like.  I hope I‚Äôm wrong there.  He wasn‚Äôt even in my own top 5 choices for Democratic party Presidential nominee. (12)
But politics being politics, Biden was also USED by Barak Obama. Obama needed those ‚Äòworking class‚Äô white folks, some of them bigoted, to win. Joe spoke their language--no different than a heathen Donald Trump choosing a religious fanatic Pence to the white evangelical vote.(11)
Like most politicians, Biden is a political whore. He pandered to his Delaware white constituents on busing, he pandered to the fear of times with his crime bill, as well as with his ‚Äò'security‚Äô bill. He was never the brightest bulb around, but bluster has taken him a long way 10
You live long enough you will find checkers in your past, and you will find that what made sense 40 years ago doesn‚Äôt make sense now. Biden has been good on some things (Apartheid, Voting Rights), but he can‚Äôt and should not be totally let of the hook for his pre-Obama life. (9)
Some Blacks thought it was a ‚ÄòBlack Seat‚Äô and settled for anyone. George Bush gave them what they wanted, and the joke was on all of us. Sometimes (unfortunately) you get what you ask for. Those white men on that Judiciary Committee, especially Biden, treated Anita Hill poorly.(8
I was soured on Joe Biden during and after the Clarence Thomas hearing. Just as a lot of Blacks were in favor of the 1994 Crime bill AT THE TIME, lots of Blacks were in favor of Thomas replacing Thurgood Marshall on the Supreme Court.  I was against both. (7)
The 21st century US Senate is different from the 20th century Senate, which was different than the pre-Civil War Senate.  Back when Biden was cordial with segregationist, all US Senators shook hand and referred to each other as ‚Äúfriend‚Äù no matter where they were in  politics.
To Biden specifically, he ain‚Äôt my choice, but it wasn‚Äôt my choice.  It was, however, my people‚Äôs choice.  I see the negative articles and videos. There is truth in them, but mostly non-contextual truth.  That‚Äôs Twitter.(3)
I get Biden‚Äôs history. I also get American history. I not only understand decisions that were, I understand the social issues and attitudes of the those times. Not to be overly condescending, but that is something the younger Twitter warriors don‚Äôt get‚Äîcan‚Äôt FEEL the times. (2)

Joe Biden is NOT wrong
Future president Joe Biden
I'm saying we are in a shitload of trouble with a fascist in office trying to destroy institutions for his own political and financial purposes. Biden is a neoliberal, but not an authoritarian. Biden ain't dangerous like that, not would his admin be full of non apologetic bigots.
SE Cupp and Meghan McCain think we care who their overprivledged asses vote for in 2020.    We don‚Äôt.  And neither Joe Biden nor the Democratic Party should jump through hoops to convince them who to vote for.
I think Biden has a loose gaffe filled tongue.  I also think Biden has a lot of Black women senior campaign advisors who will probably have influential jobs in his administration, as well as the Black female running mate who may end up VP with a possible Presidential future.
That's sort of how I heard it too.  Some people will see it that and others see it another.  Some are manufacturing angst for their own political purposes are some are legit.  In any event, Biden needs to think more and talk less.
I don't want to hear about another Biden gaffe. I can't get flown out to Greece or Tanzania for Yacht Week because of Trump's incompetence and commitment to skullduggery. Biden has slips of the tongue but Trump's slip of character is deadly.
I think if Biden could do anything to an all powerful omnipotent being... That would be really impressive!
If it‚Äôs visibly seen then you must be able to point to some debate where this was self apparent. I find it quite hilarious how last week conservatives tried to argue that Biden was hiding and would not participate in debates. Wrong. Today they argue he doesn‚Äôt want a 4th.
Aye, if you don‚Äôt vote for Joe Biden YOU AINT BLACK!
You don't know what I call out. I'm always going to go against authoritarian, the fascist.  You don't think I know about Biden's shortcomings, then you don't know me, but I'll take von Hindenburg against Hitler every time
Biden is catholic and goes to church
That appears to be a very biased conclusion. And your analogy has no basis in reality. Please show me any evidence in any debate where Biden has not performed well let alone being hunted as if he were prey.
Are you so gullible to think that Biden is more succeptible to this strategy than the current president. I can‚Äôt count how many times Trump has gotten so upset in a press conference that he simply just walked out.
Biden, is that the same thing you said today, that all Black‚Äôs are all the same. No diversity in Black people. Your a racist but you do hide it well.
They‚Äôre only funny because of the person she is mocking. I watched a couple and I don‚Äôt get why they are funny. And I‚Äôm not even close to a Trump supporter. If anyone decided to do this to Biden, they would be called names for it. Just hack comedy
The incoherent ramblings of a desperate, troubled, man. #Trump #Biden #VOTE
Biden, anyone whose thinking of voting for you or are going to vote for you, need their heads examine. Your senile old man, who could never run this country, with the exception of collecting money from China, your such a crooked politician. If people don‚Äôt see that their blind.
Biden, your so full of BS, it‚Äôs pathetic. What you said today about the Black‚Äôs sums it all up, I like to see how are you going backtrack on this one, your looking for the Black vote, and your no better than the KKK.
You're an adulterer, you put kids in cages and separate them from families. You put paramilitary thugs in cities to beat peaceful protestors. You pardon convicted criminals on more than one occasion but Biden wants to hurt God and hurt the Bible. Pathetic
The radical leftist socialist progressive liberal democrats go after the NRA but not the Clinton Foundation , ANTIFA, Hunter Biden , Joe Biden corrupt FBI Director , or BLM  !!!
Biden isn‚Äôt good in mass debates but he more than stood his own against Bernie one on one.
you and Schumer are two BS artists. You don‚Äôt want a deal because your not negotiating in good faith, you could care less for the American people, your only agenda is the Nov elections. If Biden keeps making statements like he did today, he better start praying
YOU'RE insulted.  I always look to see whom the instigators are before I shoot the ball.  Biden says a lot of stupid things and if Karine Jean-Pierre and Symone sanders don't reign him in he's bound to say more.

The amount of hardship that Joe Biden has gone through in his life and he still turned out better then most to lose his first wife and child in a car accident then to lose his other son to cancer. Trump hasn‚Äôt seen hardship he could give a shit
That isn't exactly what he said, even as what he said is stupid. His people need to keep the microphone away from him. Unlike the other guy, Biden has some high profile and capable Black women running his campaign. One will be his running mate. For me that's bigger than a gaffe.

I don't don't disagree. In fact, I've taught that long before it became a popular issue for the 21st century twitter army.  If you want to go deep into the SYSTEM, that's a totally different subject than a Biden gaffe.
Wooooo  Joe Biden pursues the Latino vote by saying that Latinos are not as dumb as Black people. You cant make this stuff up.
A lot of people want a lot of things. That's Trumpspeak.  What do most people want? Biden gets grief for this 1994 crime bill. Unfortunately in the middle of the crack epidemic and high murder rate Black people were not only on board, but yelling and screaming with encouragement.
If Trump loses to Biden in November, I'm not going to complain. That's night, I'll celebrate with you. But the next day, I'm going to remind you how shitty and problematic Biden is.
I'm not defending Biden as the savior of all.  I'm not arguing about Biden's shortcomings, his past or his stupid comments.  What I'm saying is that this is election season an d people will either jump on every gaffe, exaggerate a gaffe, or make up one.

Ha HaHa Dems are very sour. They got stuck with a loser like Biden and even you know he‚Äôs going to make a bad choice for VP. Truth be told Trump is going to win the states he needs to win to get re-elected and there will be 4 more years. Hope you guys don‚Äôt lose your minds! üòù

Talking bout Biden?
Susan. Hear me on this. One of the reasons why they got the polls so wrong during the killary/Trump election was because so many ppl were scared to say they were actually voting for Trump. They admitted they were going to vote for her. Let's do that again. Everybody say Biden. ü§≠

#Election2020 Other than senility, Joe Biden's problem is that he is too far left. He can not get back to the center by November. Obama did it by pulling a Bill Cosby; "Black people need to stop complaining so much", why he lost Jessie Jackson's support.
Every time I see this I ask, no beg, for anybody that gets polled to declare that they are voting for sleepy Joe. Well don't say that, just say Biden. That way the poles will be skewed way of course, &amp; then Trump will get reelected. We'll have even worse temper tantrums to watch.

The reality on the ground is the DNC rigged the primaries to make Biden the nominee.
Yes, he was going to win. He still had a path to the nomination as of April 7. I still love &amp; respect Bernie &amp; recognize his accomplishments, but I'm not voting for Biden. I'm voting Green.
I understand ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not voting for Trump‚Äù to mean that you‚Äôre voting for Biden. You don‚Äôt need to say it in another way for those of us who pay attentions
When you have liberals aka Democrats running the state what do you expect! Biden will make things even worse.
Yes. I never loved Biden, but what we have now is intolerable.
Yes, which is also part of their plan. If Biden wins, why leave him anything to build on.
Hot tempered Biden caught in a lie and exploded. Joe Biden tells factory worker ‚Äòyou‚Äôre full of s---‚Äô during a tense argument over guns.
Trump is right. No √Åfrican American in their right mind will vote for Biden after repeatedly disrespects the intelligence of the Black community.

He dropped out before half the states voted! That's a huge problem. And he wasn't doing badly; that was a false narrative perpetrated by the msm. The difference in delegate count between him &amp; Biden wasn't that great. Voting by mail would have kept people safe.
Biden's big strength is young people who have HAD IT with Trump.  As JFK said under very different circumstances, The torch has been passed to a new generation of Americans. And they want Joe.  Not Bernie or any other "progressives." Real progress from people who get things done.
Biden could nominate Jose Altuve for Vice President and have David Ortiz as his Chief of Staff, and I would still vote for him.
Biden is gonzo! What a flat out racist!
Joe Biden has said there are "a number of women who are qualified to be president tomorrow." That's an understatement.   In the latest for    &amp;  challenge any doubts that women are the VP list are up to the job.
Biden may fall into the Clinton trap of picking someone who they like personally, rather than someone who may help them politically. All in all though, I like Rice. Cheney served a few terms in Congress, so I‚Äôm not sure if using past precedents apply today.

Plus, the actual leftists tell people twenty times a day that Biden is a right-wing corporatist shill. Ruins the narrative for the Republicans something fierce.
No, America did not decide that Biden is the guy to beat Trump. The machinations and election fraud of the DNC did that. We Bernie supporters DID come out for him, but nobody for us to actually vote. My state primary was July 7.

if you truly think that  handled the cognitive question ‚Äújust right‚Äù then you may need a cognitive test yourself. Biden said himself he is ‚ÄúCONSTANTLY TESTED‚Äù. Did he flip flop or just doesn‚Äôt remember??
Biden is my only hope that Trump will win. He is so bad that even stone can win an election against Biden. Democrats are so pathetic that they defeated Bernie to select this joker.
That doesn‚Äôt make any sense. If Trump starts lying why can‚Äôt Biden expose the lies Trump is telling. Why run and hide.
I completely agree that the country is way more conservative than many of us are willing to accept. I think Biden ultimately would have bested Buttigieg and Klobuchar, and Bernie has never had much luck with black voters. I think this probably would have happened in the end.
It will be in November.....President Biden!!!
I guarantee that if Biden wins the Democrats who are leaning towards a Socialist America will aggressively strip away our American rights. From taking our right bare arms, to conservative speech, and forced vaccinations that will kill a large portion of the population.

No, he wasn't "losing in large numbers." Yes, there was major voter suppression and election rigging. Why do you value Biden's voters more than Bernie's? Bernie should have advocated vote by mail instead of disenfranchising half the states that had not yet held their primaries.

My analysis of #Biden woos #Muslim Americans    ‚Å¶ ‚Å¶ ‚Å¶ ‚Å¶
Biden is far, far from perfect‚Äîseriously flawed, in fact‚Äîbut Trump is dangerous, and the scary part is that fascist regimes always come to power with the consent of part of the population and the indifference of another part. (end)
I also understand that Biden might possibly be more prone to military conflict than any of us would like.  I hope I‚Äôm wrong there.  He wasn‚Äôt even in my own top 5 choices for Democratic party Presidential nominee. (12)
But politics being politics, Biden was also USED by Barak Obama. Obama needed those ‚Äòworking class‚Äô white folks, some of them bigoted, to win. Joe spoke their language--no different than a heathen Donald Trump choosing a religious fanatic Pence to the white evangelical vote.(11)
Like most politicians, Biden is a political whore. He pandered to his Delaware white constituents on busing, he pandered to the fear of times with his crime bill, as well as with his ‚Äò'security‚Äô bill. He was never the brightest bulb around, but bluster has taken him a long way 10
You live long enough you will find checkers in your past, and you will find that what made sense 40 years ago doesn‚Äôt make sense now. Biden has been good on some things (Apartheid, Voting Rights), but he can‚Äôt and should not be totally let of the hook for his pre-Obama life. (9)
Some Blacks thought it was a ‚ÄòBlack Seat‚Äô and settled for anyone. George Bush gave them what they wanted, and the joke was on all of us. Sometimes (unfortunately) you get what you ask for. Those white men on that Judiciary Committee, especially Biden, treated Anita Hill poorly.(8
I was soured on Joe Biden during and after the Clarence Thomas hearing. Just as a lot of Blacks were in favor of the 1994 Crime bill AT THE TIME, lots of Blacks were in favor of Thomas replacing Thurgood Marshall on the Supreme Court.  I was against both. (7)
The 21st century US Senate is different from the 20th century Senate, which was different than the pre-Civil War Senate.  Back when Biden was cordial with segregationist, all US Senators shook hand and referred to each other as ‚Äúfriend‚Äù no matter where they were in  politics.
To Biden specifically, he ain‚Äôt my choice, but it wasn‚Äôt my choice.  It was, however, my people‚Äôs choice.  I see the negative articles and videos. There is truth in them, but mostly non-contextual truth.  That‚Äôs Twitter.(3)
I get Biden‚Äôs history. I also get American history. I not only understand decisions that were, I understand the social issues and attitudes of the those times. Not to be overly condescending, but that is something the younger Twitter warriors don‚Äôt get‚Äîcan‚Äôt FEEL the times. (2)

Joe Biden didn‚Äôt make news when he disclosed his belief that ‚Äúblacks aren‚Äôt diverse.‚Äù He merely revealed the plantation mindset that has sadly stood the test of time with the Democrat party.
Biden is a Simp
#TrumpIsALiar and his lying  reps are at it again. The comment is completely, deliberately incomplete and taken out of context. In fact, Biden said there would be no way we could take away guns.
Yes. I think they are taking advantage of people's trauma wrt Trump to move as far neoliberal as possible under the radar bc they are betting on negative partisanship to carry Biden through no matter what he does. It's odious.
#DaddyIssuesDonny screwed up the current lie about Biden and taxes. The going lie is 3T, the same amount as Trump raised the national debt when he first got in, not 4T. You gotta‚Äô keep your lies straight.
You really think your daddy fuhrer would beat Joe Biden in a debate?  Donald Sr couldn‚Äôt beat an empty chair in a debate.
I can‚Äôt wait to see what happens when Biden tries to step over the line. Fox News is going to look so silly. I mean, they already have but even further more so

Roger Stone is using Kanye; do not fall for this
I‚Äôm not going to partake in the conversation about Biden being a devout catholic compared to Trump not being able to name a bible verse. Reason being I think religion has no business being a factor in politics or anything in life. Being religious doesn‚Äôt make you a good person.
Biden is shot
That‚Äôs really sad! That‚Äôs a very old picture and Biden has evolved just like most of the Caucasians that realize that their way of thinking about others were WRONG!  Yup that‚Äôs the Democratic Party that has evolved and is asking for change on systemic racism! He is a better man‚ÄºÔ∏è

Biden needs to stay in his basement and never come out!!! Or better yet send him to the old folks home, Trump is coming to eat him alive on the debate stage. I‚Äôm sorry but uh is this the best the democrats have. Stutters way too much

I‚Äôve decided to persist until Biden makes his choice. Isn‚Äôt that the entire point of Warren‚Äôs message. #WarrenforVP.
yeah because biden‚Äôs policies actually hurt minorities, unlike all of trump‚Äôs policies
i‚Äôve seen this before, it‚Äôs fake news mostly, vote for segregationist all black people think alike biden if you want someone pure of prejudice
you haven‚Äôt produced one example, you‚Äôre incapable of doing so, he said they were guilty because black or you pulled out of your ass? and you won‚Äôt ever find an example as racist as biden was this morning saying all black people think the same
At least Biden knows how to hold a Bible upright
Remember every time he says Biden he really means   Donald  Trump
Y‚Äôall keep shaming Biden and ppl will see it and decide not to vote for anyone and then boom üí•   We got Trump dumbass for another 4 yrs.
Trump is not a Republican and you know it. He hijacked your party, insulted your father, brought disgrace to the presidency and ruined our reputation among other civilized nations.  What more do you need? Biden spoke at your father's funeral and the Trumps were asked to stay away

I'm saying we are in a shitload of trouble with a fascist in office trying to destroy institutions for his own political and financial purposes. Biden is a neoliberal, but not an authoritarian. Biden ain't dangerous like that, not would his admin be full of non apologetic bigots.
SE Cupp and Meghan McCain think we care who their overprivledged asses vote for in 2020.    We don‚Äôt.  And neither Joe Biden nor the Democratic Party should jump through hoops to convince them who to vote for.
I think Biden has a loose gaffe filled tongue.  I also think Biden has a lot of Black women senior campaign advisors who will probably have influential jobs in his administration, as well as the Black female running mate who may end up VP with a possible Presidential future.
Noo, not this time lol! Joe Biden said some nonsense;
I see u have a new bok cuming out about Jo Biden. I hope it is proofd bthr then the whay yur first ,one wez. It wood b a shame if it realy kame out the whay u and ur squeeze two each utter. P.s. Try a real publisher, you ahole.
That's sort of how I heard it too.  Some people will see it that and others see it another.  Some are manufacturing angst for their own political purposes are some are legit.  In any event, Biden needs to think more and talk less.
Trump: Biden will 'hurt the Bible, hurt God,' guns  via  ‚Äú‚ÄùHurt God‚Äù is beyond whacked out, but what did he mean by Biden being against ‚Äúour kind of energy?‚Äù  Libidinous?
I don't want to hear about another Biden gaffe. I can't get flown out to Greece or Tanzania for Yacht Week because of Trump's incompetence and commitment to skullduggery. Biden has slips of the tongue but Trump's slip of character is deadly.
Apparently Joe Biden can hurt God.  Me:
"2020 Election Live Updates: Maine, South Carolina and Kentucky Face Tight Senate Races, Polls Show" by Unknown Author via NYT
Joe Biden should really stfu...sounding real Trumpy
Again we are not voting for  Biden cause we like him. We voting for him cause we hate Trump
If it‚Äôs visibly seen then you must be able to point to some debate where this was self apparent. I find it quite hilarious how last week conservatives tried to argue that Biden was hiding and would not participate in debates. Wrong. Today they argue he doesn‚Äôt want a 4th.
You don't know what I call out. I'm always going to go against authoritarian, the fascist.  You don't think I know about Biden's shortcomings, then you don't know me, but I'll take von Hindenburg against Hitler every time
That appears to be a very biased conclusion. And your analogy has no basis in reality. Please show me any evidence in any debate where Biden has not performed well let alone being hunted as if he were prey.
Are you so gullible to think that Biden is more succeptible to this strategy than the current president. I can‚Äôt count how many times Trump has gotten so upset in a press conference that he simply just walked out.
Whew, Joe Biden really be stepping in it, boy. ü•¥
They‚Äôre only funny because of the person she is mocking. I watched a couple and I don‚Äôt get why they are funny. And I‚Äôm not even close to a Trump supporter. If anyone decided to do this to Biden, they would be called names for it. Just hack comedy
Give me a break with your pearl clutching. I‚Äôm so tired of conservative pundits like yourself decrying everything this President has done out of moral decency, but not having the moral decency yourself to see Biden is simply the better pick for the future of the nation.
The democrats treat religious organizations as hate groups. Look what Biden did to The Little Sisters of the Poor.  Don‚Äôt be fooled by the dems when they start quoting bible verses at election time.
Biden isn‚Äôt good in mass debates but he more than stood his own against Bernie one on one.
YOU'RE insulted.  I always look to see whom the instigators are before I shoot the ball.  Biden says a lot of stupid things and if Karine Jean-Pierre and Symone sanders don't reign him in he's bound to say more.
Hey Carl..what do you think about Biden saying the African American community isn't diverse enough?
Biden wants better for America while you‚Äôre destroying America each day
The amount of hardship that Joe Biden has gone through in his life and he still turned out better then most to lose his first wife and child in a car accident then to lose his other son to cancer. Trump hasn‚Äôt seen hardship he could give a shit
That isn't exactly what he said, even as what he said is stupid. His people need to keep the microphone away from him. Unlike the other guy, Biden has some high profile and capable Black women running his campaign. One will be his running mate. For me that's bigger than a gaffe.
You are literally the one redefining this,  making this deeper than it needs to be. I guarantee you when Biden said political views he was simply thinking dem or repub. Thats how simplistic they see us. Are you a dem or repub. Becuase that‚Äôs all that matters to them
Dude, something like 89% of black people vote for Democrats. Yes I know there‚Äôs a generational divide when it comes to progressive vs liberal, but the fact is the large majority of black people support the democrat party and thusly Joe Biden.
I feel like you‚Äôre jumping the gun on this one. We all know Biden is a silly old man but what he said, in the context of political views, is objectively true
I'm sure that political consultants think that way, but I'm skeptical that‚Äîexcept in extreme cases‚Äîthe veep choice actually affects the ticket's chances. (Sure, Biden probably shouldn't pick Farrakhan.) I'm also skeptical that the effect is knowable in advance‚Äîor even retrospect.
Biden has no filter.
Unbelievable! Biden has no filter!
Politicians bluster and say stupid things. Biden has exaggerated his role in a lot of shit that was popular at the time but the years have taken a different turn.  You want a politician who is different? Look at Barbara Lee.
I don't don't disagree. In fact, I've taught that long before it became a popular issue for the 21st century twitter army.  If you want to go deep into the SYSTEM, that's a totally different subject than a Biden gaffe.
Wooooo  Joe Biden pursues the Latino vote by saying that Latinos are not as dumb as Black people. You cant make this stuff up.
A lot of people want a lot of things. That's Trumpspeak.  What do most people want? Biden gets grief for this 1994 crime bill. Unfortunately in the middle of the crack epidemic and high murder rate Black people were not only on board, but yelling and screaming with encouragement.
This is satirical right? It's obviously making fun how the right talks about and portrays Biden right?
I'm not defending Biden as the savior of all.  I'm not arguing about Biden's shortcomings, his past or his stupid comments.  What I'm saying is that this is election season an d people will either jump on every gaffe, exaggerate a gaffe, or make up one.
What I WILL not do is play dumb for the sake of trying to make a point.  Biden was OBVIOUSLY taking about degrees of diversity, a point that can and has been proven.
No, I think I get what Biden was saying.  I think you get it too.
Yes he should. If Biden is accepting the nomination from the basement of his home why can‚Äôt Trump accept from his primary residence.
Listen, black Americans that think logically and not emotionally will never vote Joe ‚Äúthe real racists‚Äù Biden. You super liberal feminist black females are the worst!  Smh
Sir, end the Democrats‚Äô blackmail, extend unemployment and temporarily drop payroll taxes by executive order, and go to political war against them and Biden everyday up to the election and crush them.

Trump‚Äôs time as president will end on January 20, 2021. Article II of the Constitution provides that a president is elected to serve a four-year term, and Trump‚Äôs four years will be up on that date. Without a new electoral mandate, he‚Äôs out.

He also declared himself right in line with Biden, which is something neither Rashida or AOC have done. Not sure about Omar and Pressley who has drifted away from the others.

Biden‚Äôs poll numbers are dropping faster than Bill Clinton‚Äôs pants on orgy Island! Solution is to mail ballots to everyone including undocumented as long as you have a Nevada license!
In this very moment, I'm sure there is someone in the Republican Party that is devising what options the president has if the election does not go as he wants. Of all those options I'm certain the least likely to occur is the president calling Joe Biden to graciously concede.
joe biden already said everything president trump should have done, little did he know, trump already did everything he listed, or maybe he just expects his followers to be that dumb
Before she gets indicted? Barr only said he wouldn‚Äôt look at Obama and Biden. That‚Äôs it.
I hope you realize that "Never Biden" means "Ever Trump."
The people who have the most to lose from another Trump presidency will never support Biden, because we know that if we don't spend the next 4 years creating infrastructure for genuine resistance, we'll just face a greater threat than Trump later and have no power to resist.
Libertarian here since 2002. This is my last year. If we get Joe Biden or Donald Trump then I will quit as a Libertarian.   This is your call Jo. It is in your hands.   Don't let me down.Biden eats trees

This is a fucking distraction... i don't care what he said.. Im still riding with Biden..

Biden only looking for females... and at his age... sets up the first female President to get into office without winning an election.  Talk about insulting.
Kamala and Cory Booker always seemed drooling for a chance to get in front of a camera, but in terms of Presidential Ambition Lust, she's not off the charts.  What's damning is her record.  What's damning is Biden's decision to choose a VP solely based on their identify + gender.

Breaking News: Russia continues to meddle in the election to aid President Trump, using a range of measures to denigrate Joe Biden, intelligence officials said.
PLEASE REGISTER TO VOTE FOR JOE BIDEN
Exactly. As I've said previously, there's no upside to Rice. There's so many negatives. There's so much that has to be addressed defensively which takes away from Team Biden being on message
Joining  NEXT from  will be  to talk #Biden and ways to help ruined American cities rebuild!
Do you care about police brutality?  You don‚Äôt if you‚Äôre vote for Biden/Harris.  Do you care about dead bodies overseas?
American intelligence officials said Friday that Russia is continuing to interfere in the 2020 campaign to aid President Trump's reelection.

Make no mistake. The economic recovery is being manipulated to propel a path to Biden‚Äôs election. It‚Äôs strategic. Teachers unions mirror BLM demands. Hold kids hostage. Keep moms home. Media stir the pot. Keep moms infuriated because they can‚Äôt go back to work. Pin it on Trump.
William Evanina, the Trump-picked U.S. counterintelligence chief, says Andriy Derkach is part of Russia's effort to hurt Biden &amp; help Trump.   has met with Derkach several times as part of his own bid to smear Biden.  Evanina's full statement:
To quote  "Fire every single one of these people" in Congress, especially Pelosi and Schumer.  ...but to not-quote Krystal, "fire [them] into the troposphere"  srsly, they're really trying to kneecap Biden even more by letting Trump run to the Dems' left aren't they
If I was writing this script, I‚Äôd throw in an ironic twist of fate here that everyone should‚Äôve already predicted was coming: China tilts the outcome to Biden, flips America over like an hourglass. End the story at Biden‚Äôs swearing in.
Leo Terrell blasts Biden: Unfit to be president, 'mindset of a plantation owner'
well, you know, Biden only has to hold his own in one debate....just one...so, let's calm down about these debates
If the Communist Party bought Biden, they didn‚Äôt even have to buy the media. AFAIK, all big US corporations lobby for China in Wanshinton D.C. and China doesn‚Äôt even pay them. Business and financial interests for a few CEOs are lucrative enough to let them commit treason.
Here is the big difference from this intelligence report:  1. Dems believe it and Joe Biden will NOT encourage/accept support from China and Iran.  2. Republicans will deny Russia is trying to help Donald Trump, but Trump will gladly accept the Kremlin's help.  This is 2020.
Rudy‚Äôs man. Figures.
Joe Biden Launches National Advertisement Aimed Toward Black Voters
The difference between  and the current fake President is unmeasurable. Biden will have a big job to restore the country from the  chaos that has taken over but anyone with sense, has confidence in him and that he will surround himself with the right people. #Biden2020

lol Biden picks Tim Kaine.
Trump voters gave us Trump and after that I credit Clinton &amp; her inept campaign(who promoted both Trump &amp; Cruz thinking they‚Äôd be easy to beat with tragic results). This year those same assholes consolidated behind Biden and his billionaires who also don‚Äôt care if we live or die.
Biden would be, if he is elected, only the second Catholic to become U.S. President.

Joe Biden didn‚Äôt clarify anything. Joe Biden‚Äôs campaign tried to make up for it.
I agree w/ that but since I‚Äôm voting in NY Im still undecided bc it ultimately doesn‚Äôt matter how I vote. I understand that national figures have to advocate broadly to vote for Biden. I don‚Äôt tell anyone NOT to &amp; want him to win, but not sure i will &amp; that‚Äôs where I‚Äôm  now.
what happens if the DNC changes their presidential ticket after mail-in voting starts?  do votes cast for Biden/X count for Biden/Y, X/Y or Y/Z?  #TheFive
In other words, 2 of 3 enemies want Trump to lose.  That's the only reason this info was released.  And if Biden wins, they'll say it's because of China and Iran.

Biden and Obama divided the country, destroyed the FBI, CIA and NSA, and now Biden wants to eliminate the police.
Funny, that he did not mention #HunterBiden ‚ÅâÔ∏è #Biden Family #MadeinChina #Ukraine #Iraq üí∞üí∞üí∞
Just received a personal invitation email from Biden (mind you I never met the guy) asking for 5 buck donation  cause he's about ready to make an announcement...but he won't cause by now he forgot!
Trump has a small base support. I have seen ONE Biden supporter with a Biden shirt...and it was superimposed in the photo! It wasn‚Äôt even real!
No! I‚Äôd wait to vote Biden in.

FOX nightly shows might be in for a big shock when their continuous mocking of Biden leads to someone else at the last minute becomes the real nominee. Take heed because we've been saying this for months. They need to stop the ridicule.
That‚Äôs just sad!!! That they will make this man go through this horrible thing That he‚Äôs going through! What is the matter with his family and his party get Joe Biden some help!
Sean &amp; Laura - when Biden is not the nominee (which he won't be due to health issues), you will be the cause. Trashing him every night will then be a shock to you because the Left will listen. Don't think I didn't warn you!
What the hell is with Hannity? He literally repeats the same footage of Biden every night. Talks over a minute with a question to each 8 guests a show and they get 20 seconds. Don't forget he HAS to plug his book too. üò°

New poll has Trump within 3. Any Biden supporters concerned?
They only criticize Trump when he's not far enough Right. I'm not crazy about Biden. He's old and flawed. Yet he's going against the worst President in modern times so it's choosing an old man over a narcissist idiot. Plus Trump is also senile and clumsy
trump's just jealous that Biden can sit on the floor and get back up again
Joe Biden should stop running for president and start doing comedian,,,His ratings will be off the chart !üòÇ
So I guess it‚Äôs also a no for presidential candidate Biden his time picking running mate?
President Biden doesn't decide what investigations happen. The incoming attorney general will decide.
I like Harris ALOT, However, Rice is much more seasoned for VP. I know Harris can be great at any position, including VP. I know her seat's in Cali but I wld hate to lose Senate seat. I'd be happy w/ either. I thought Biden wld stay away from Rice bc she WAS part of Obama team
Imagine being so deranged that there was clear evidence Trump had more than fatherly feelings for his daughter and you guys go "but what about Biden sniffing babies?!"

I'm a moderate but I get WE as a country need to move forward. So this election goes to Biden. May be not progressive but hes still a true Democrat. I guarantee that after this election, 2024 is going to be much more progressive than it is now. Let's all be in this as one.
Between the Trump interview and the Biden interview, how can anyone think anything will be getting better after November?
2020 Joe Biden is so out of it that Howard would have inaugurated him into the WACK PACK along with the likes of Beetlejuice! He doesn‚Äôt even know what planet he is on! America isn‚Äôt that dumb! California and New York might be!
Trump needs to debate Biden more than Biden needs to debate Trump. Every day the news is dominated by another Trump error, the reality is that the Coronavirus is not going away. Every day our country sees Trump as the emperor in "The Emperor's New Clothes" children's story.
Don‚Äôt worry about it if you ask Biden what this was about tomorrow he‚Äôll tell you I don‚Äôt
Don‚Äôt you wonder why China and Russia want Biden to win ? Because he is soft.

If I had a penny for everytime Biden forgot his line ill have more than you...
That's not the same thing at all. Mainly because if you are saying that, you are 98% likely to not be a Republican. You also have to be gullible to think that what she is indirectly saying is to not vote for Biden.
Biden Delegate here  should be #VP
Just more attempted distraction, this has been covered before, Biden's family moved when he was 10, should he really have stayed behind by himself?
By the looks of the replies to Ryan, seems Ryan is more of a threat than a  Biden Presidency, very telling..its the darndest thing!
I heard Biden dementia is getting worse is that true?

Biden is squarely within usual presidential norms. I don't expect him to increase divisiveness the way someone like Bernie or (when she's old enough) AOC would.
Fair enough.. tell you what, I‚Äôll follow you and if Biden wins, you‚Äôll be my first tweet..
And this why Biden could never win!

It seems like #Biden is in a quagmire no matter who he decides to pick as a running mate. Not everyone will satisfied with the decision, but we have to back #Biden no matter what!  Also, we can‚Äôt tear down the potential VP candidates either. We must stay united! #YesWeCanAgain
Oh I agree with her. Democrats like Biden are why we‚Äôre where we‚Äôre at. Her method is suspect and it‚Äôs designed to suppress the vote by discouraging people.
Biden could never beat Trump And this why Biden could never win!
I will NOT. Biden will: increase taxes, increase regulations, defund police , eliminate homeland security and ICE, eliminate amendment #2 (right to bear arms), eliminate charter schools ,  stop fracking and  oil independence,  and  destroy the current healthcare system.
What happened to ‚Äòkeep America Great‚Äô? Or did you realize how badly you fucked it up? Don‚Äôt worry. I‚Äôm sure Biden will get her back to rights.
How do you know? Joe Biden barely remembers who his wife is. I don't think he remembers he has any degrees.
I'd prefer if he did debate but I can't think of anything Biden could do or refuse to do that would make Trump a better choice.
They spelled Nina Turner wrong.. My Sister is Nina Turner ‚ù§ for the record!
My take is the 1% realizes the error they committed installing #Chump so yes they'll proceed on a Biden installation, and hold their breaths for the best. But as long as they're involved through Citizens United and lobbying it's not Democracy. Or a legitimate Democratic election.
You mean the 1% on the right??? They fund all actors on the Right. They #installed #Chump in 2016. And will install Biden in 2020 bc #Chump's not working out. But it's still installations, not Democracy.
I‚Äôm probably voting for Jo Jorgensen. Biden seems to be mentally weak and I don‚Äôt know who will be controlling him. While Trump is good and bad, I cannot see me voting for him this time either.
It would be really nice if Joe Biden supported M4All.
100 % . Biden has been in office for almost 50 years and nothing to show for. He also has signs of dementi. Biden could never near trumpHow is this not a bigger deal? If Russia or China is interfering for either party, we deserve to see examples of the interference.
Hmmm. I really want a Biden Harris t-shirt and window sign. I saw my neighbor yesterday wearing an Obama/Biden shirt. Lol
Same obstruction they pulled with Obama and which Biden saw first-hand. Biden will need discipline to not get drawn in

Biden should pick a Black woman for VP. Here are 6 great options
Unlike some past nominees, I don't think Biden needs a VP to cover a particular portfolio.  He has the depth and  breadth of experience in both foreign and domestic affairs. Not like some Governors who ran (most recently W.) who needed to shore up foreign policy credentials.
My analysis of #Biden woos #Muslim Americans    ‚Å¶ ‚Å¶ ‚Å¶ ‚Å¶
Biden is far, far from perfect‚Äîseriously flawed, in fact‚Äîbut Trump is dangerous, and the scary part is that fascist regimes always come to power with the consent of part of the population and the indifference of another part. (end)
I also understand that Biden might possibly be more prone to military conflict than any of us would like.  I hope I‚Äôm wrong there.  He wasn‚Äôt even in my own top 5 choices for Democratic party Presidential nominee. (12)
But politics being politics, Biden was also USED by Barak Obama. Obama needed those ‚Äòworking class‚Äô white folks, some of them bigoted, to win. Joe spoke their language--no different than a heathen Donald Trump choosing a religious fanatic Pence to the white evangelical vote.(11)
Like most politicians, Biden is a political whore. He pandered to his Delaware white constituents on busing, he pandered to the fear of times with his crime bill, as well as with his ‚Äò'security‚Äô bill. He was never the brightest bulb around, but bluster has taken him a long way 10
You live long enough you will find checkers in your past, and you will find that what made sense 40 years ago doesn‚Äôt make sense now. Biden has been good on some things (Apartheid, Voting Rights), but he can‚Äôt and should not be totally let of the hook for his pre-Obama life. (9)
Some Blacks thought it was a ‚ÄòBlack Seat‚Äô and settled for anyone. George Bush gave them what they wanted, and the joke was on all of us. Sometimes (unfortunately) you get what you ask for. Those white men on that Judiciary Committee, especially Biden, treated Anita Hill poorly.(8
I was soured on Joe Biden during and after the Clarence Thomas hearing. Just as a lot of Blacks were in favor of the 1994 Crime bill AT THE TIME, lots of Blacks were in favor of Thomas replacing Thurgood Marshall on the Supreme Court.  I was against both. (7)
The 21st century US Senate is different from the 20th century Senate, which was different than the pre-Civil War Senate.  Back when Biden was cordial with segregationist, all US Senators shook hand and referred to each other as ‚Äúfriend‚Äù no matter where they were in  politics.
To Biden specifically, he ain‚Äôt my choice, but it wasn‚Äôt my choice.  It was, however, my people‚Äôs choice.  I see the negative articles and videos. There is truth in them, but mostly non-contextual truth.  That‚Äôs Twitter.(3)
I get Biden‚Äôs history. I also get American history. I not only understand decisions that were, I understand the social issues and attitudes of the those times. Not to be overly condescending, but that is something the younger Twitter warriors don‚Äôt get‚Äîcan‚Äôt FEEL the times. (2)
Most people don't get it. Biden is not a racist. He is a segregationist

I don't want to hear about another Biden gaffe. I can't get flown out to Greece or Tanzania for Yacht Week because of Trump's incompetence and commitment to skullduggery. Biden has slips of the tongue but Trump's slip of character is deadly.
Hey    Does Joe Biden have the power to hurt you?   Asking for the few million who believe Trump‚Äôs horseshit.. ü§£
Apparently Joe Biden can hurt God.  Me:
"2020 Election Live Updates: Maine, South Carolina and Kentucky Face Tight Senate Races, Polls Show" by Unknown Author via NYT
Biden can hurt God, ey? So does that make Biden God if he's more powerful than God? Does Biden know this? How does Trump know?
show me one video that was edited to remove Trump correcting himself? I can show you a bunch of Fox News Clips where they did exactly that to both Hilary Clinton and Biden.
Joe Biden should really stfu...sounding real Trumpy
Again we are not voting for  Biden cause we like him. We voting for him cause we hate Trump
If it‚Äôs visibly seen then you must be able to point to some debate where this was self apparent. I find it quite hilarious how last week conservatives tried to argue that Biden was hiding and would not participate in debates. Wrong. Today they argue he doesn‚Äôt want a 4th.
You don't know what I call out. I'm always going to go against authoritarian, the fascist.  You don't think I know about Biden's shortcomings, then you don't know me, but I'll take von Hindenburg against Hitler every time
That appears to be a very biased conclusion. And your analogy has no basis in reality. Please show me any evidence in any debate where Biden has not performed well let alone being hunted as if he were prey.
When are you and Human Events going to be endorsing Joe Biden? Does his VP pick really matter?
Are you so gullible to think that Biden is more succeptible to this strategy than the current president. I can‚Äôt count how many times Trump has gotten so upset in a press conference that he simply just walked out.
Whew, Joe Biden really be stepping in it, boy. ü•¥
The Onion? Huh. I don't see how this could be used to attack Biden, tho ...
They‚Äôre only funny because of the person she is mocking. I watched a couple and I don‚Äôt get why they are funny. And I‚Äôm not even close to a Trump supporter. If anyone decided to do this to Biden, they would be called names for it. Just hack comedy
You get two choices, and the choices are Biden and Trump. If Biden's VP can sway you one way or the other, you're okay with voting for Trump.
Joe Biden, forming like Voltron (in this case, "Voltron" is Robespierre, Lenin, John Brown, and AOC)
Biden isn‚Äôt good in mass debates but he more than stood his own against Bernie one on one.
YOU'RE insulted.  I always look to see whom the instigators are before I shoot the ball.  Biden says a lot of stupid things and if Karine Jean-Pierre and Symone sanders don't reign him in he's bound to say more.
Hey Carl..what do you think about Biden saying the African American community isn't diverse enough?
If elected President, Joe Biden will punch the face of God.
The amount of hardship that Joe Biden has gone through in his life and he still turned out better then most to lose his first wife and child in a car accident then to lose his other son to cancer. Trump hasn‚Äôt seen hardship he could give a shit
This may let Biden's latest word-salad with diversity in Black and Latino communities slide.  Still, I am not crazy about a campaign strategy of "He doesn't have to be faster than the bear...."
May actually allow Biden's latest word-salad on diversity in black and Hispanic communities to slide.  Still, I'm not crazy about the campaign strategy being "He doesn't have to be faster than the bear...."
That isn't exactly what he said, even as what he said is stupid. His people need to keep the microphone away from him. Unlike the other guy, Biden has some high profile and capable Black women running his campaign. One will be his running mate. For me that's bigger than a gaffe.
The healthcare status quo has gone from driving people to bankruptcy to outright killing them, but have fun pretending Biden can honestly be called "pro-healthcare."

Biden must be really impressive to be able to "hurt God". Wow. #MAGA
Joe ‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt vote for me you ain‚Äôt Black‚Äù Biden fucked up again? üôÑ
Biden can‚Äôt recite his location.
You are literally the one redefining this,  making this deeper than it needs to be. I guarantee you when Biden said political views he was simply thinking dem or repub. Thats how simplistic they see us. Are you a dem or repub. Becuase that‚Äôs all that matters to them
Dude, something like 89% of black people vote for Democrats. Yes I know there‚Äôs a generational divide when it comes to progressive vs liberal, but the fact is the large majority of black people support the democrat party and thusly Joe Biden.
I feel like you‚Äôre jumping the gun on this one. We all know Biden is a silly old man but what he said, in the context of political views, is objectively true
Biden said in March that he would veto M4A if it passed both houses. Then he said he opposed single-payer in spite of the pandemic.  This month, he said having a running mate who supported M4A would be "a real problem."
So you don‚Äôt like Biden enough to vote for him as president.
I'm sure that political consultants think that way, but I'm skeptical that‚Äîexcept in extreme cases‚Äîthe veep choice actually affects the ticket's chances. (Sure, Biden probably shouldn't pick Farrakhan.) I'm also skeptical that the effect is knowable in advance‚Äîor even retrospect.

Politicians bluster and say stupid things. Biden has exaggerated his role in a lot of shit that was popular at the time but the years have taken a different turn.  You want a politician who is different? Look at Barbara Lee.
I don't don't disagree. In fact, I've taught that long before it became a popular issue for the 21st century twitter army.  If you want to go deep into the SYSTEM, that's a totally different subject than a Biden gaffe.
Wooooo  Joe Biden pursues the Latino vote by saying that Latinos are not as dumb as Black people. You cant make this stuff up.
A lot of people want a lot of things. That's Trumpspeak.  What do most people want? Biden gets grief for this 1994 crime bill. Unfortunately in the middle of the crack epidemic and high murder rate Black people were not only on board, but yelling and screaming with encouragement.
This is satirical right? It's obviously making fun how the right talks about and portrays Biden right?
I'm not defending Biden as the savior of all.  I'm not arguing about Biden's shortcomings, his past or his stupid comments.  What I'm saying is that this is election season an d people will either jump on every gaffe, exaggerate a gaffe, or make up one.
What I WILL not do is play dumb for the sake of trying to make a point.  Biden was OBVIOUSLY taking about degrees of diversity, a point that can and has been proven.
No, I think I get what Biden was saying.  I think you get it too.
Listen, black Americans that think logically and not emotionally will never vote Joe ‚Äúthe real racists‚Äù Biden. You super liberal feminist black females are the worst!  Smh

What you just described absolutely qualifies Biden as a racist.
Biden doesn‚Äôt care about you

Biden is far, far from perfect‚Äîseriously flawed, in fact‚Äîbut Trump is dangerous, and the scary part is that fascist regimes always come to power with the consent of part of the population and the indifference of another part. (end)
Biden, all your doing is twisting words, you know what you damn said, now your backtracking to save your ass. It‚Äôs to late Joe, the horse is out of the barn.
Biden, your so full of BS it‚Äôs pathetic. Basically what you said, you couldn‚Äôt distinguish one Black Man from another, to you they are all the same. Now that is a racist statement, and you should be held accountable.
I also understand that Biden might possibly be more prone to military conflict than any of us would like.  I hope I‚Äôm wrong there.  He wasn‚Äôt even in my own top 5 choices for Democratic party Presidential nominee. (12)
But politics being politics, Biden was also USED by Barak Obama. Obama needed those ‚Äòworking class‚Äô white folks, some of them bigoted, to win. Joe spoke their language--no different than a heathen Donald Trump choosing a religious fanatic Pence to the white evangelical vote.(11)
Like most politicians, Biden is a political whore. He pandered to his Delaware white constituents on busing, he pandered to the fear of times with his crime bill, as well as with his ‚Äò'security‚Äô bill. He was never the brightest bulb around, but bluster has taken him a long way 10
You live long enough you will find checkers in your past, and you will find that what made sense 40 years ago doesn‚Äôt make sense now. Biden has been good on some things (Apartheid, Voting Rights), but he can‚Äôt and should not be totally let of the hook for his pre-Obama life. (9)
Some Blacks thought it was a ‚ÄòBlack Seat‚Äô and settled for anyone. George Bush gave them what they wanted, and the joke was on all of us. Sometimes (unfortunately) you get what you ask for. Those white men on that Judiciary Committee, especially Biden, treated Anita Hill poorly.(8
I was soured on Joe Biden during and after the Clarence Thomas hearing. Just as a lot of Blacks were in favor of the 1994 Crime bill AT THE TIME, lots of Blacks were in favor of Thomas replacing Thurgood Marshall on the Supreme Court.  I was against both. (7)
The 21st century US Senate is different from the 20th century Senate, which was different than the pre-Civil War Senate.  Back when Biden was cordial with segregationist, all US Senators shook hand and referred to each other as ‚Äúfriend‚Äù no matter where they were in  politics.
To Biden specifically, he ain‚Äôt my choice, but it wasn‚Äôt my choice.  It was, however, my people‚Äôs choice.  I see the negative articles and videos. There is truth in them, but mostly non-contextual truth.  That‚Äôs Twitter.(3)
I get Biden‚Äôs history. I also get American history. I not only understand decisions that were, I understand the social issues and attitudes of the those times. Not to be overly condescending, but that is something the younger Twitter warriors don‚Äôt get‚Äîcan‚Äôt FEEL the times. (2)

Hi, Dina. I am a Dem, but not the Biden sign Dem (haven‚Äôt gotten one yet!). I have lost all faith in Murphy during the past several months. He‚Äôs as arrogant as Trump and plays fast and loose with data. I don‚Äôt trust his outage numbers. I don‚Äôt trust his intentions.

Science? Science is your fucking argument for voting for Biden.
In this very moment, I'm sure there is someone in the Republican Party that is devising what options the president has if the election does not go as he wants. Of all those options I'm certain the least likely to occur is the president calling Joe Biden to graciously concede.
Only because Biden already won
I hope you realize that "Never Biden" means "Ever Trump."
The people who have the most to lose from another Trump presidency will never support Biden, because we know that if we don't spend the next 4 years creating infrastructure for genuine resistance, we'll just face a greater threat than Trump later and have no power to resist.

Social media, ability to sway 10% of the American votes towards Biden. Ballot harvesting, fraudulent voting can skew election results by 20% towards Biden. Elections will no longer be by the people.  One man/one woman, one vote. DEAD. DEMOCRACY DEAD.   This is real, Scary shit.
I am not sure Biden is even running... barely walking occasionally
His specialty is 'bothsidesism'.  If Trump grabs women by the pussy, and Biden puts a hand on a woman's shoulder, Chuck will give equal time to each of the offenders, just to give the appearance of being unbiased.  Of course, giving equal time in this situation IS pro-GOP bias.
Wake up yourself- virus was from China - no advance notice. Riots are all in democratic run cities who refuse to stop the riots probably because they feel it will hurt Trump but meanwhile are causing death and destruction. Not a word from Biden who has dementia.

It‚Äôs worse than that. Social media has the ability to swing 10% of the vote Democrat virtually assuring Baden a victory. Mail in ballots/ballot harvesting has the ability swing up to 20% assuring Biden a victory. Court challenges 50 states delaying election results up to a year.

You've must've forgot how Obama brought America back on the fast track to prosperity and you benefited from a great economy that Obama and Biden built from basically scratch
This is a completely dumb take. First the reporter is Jake Tapper of CNN. Secondly the campaign monitors the time on each interview to maximize the exposure to multiple media outlets. Lastly Joe Biden does not have dementia. If you think so you don‚Äôt know what dementia is.

Like millions are right now losing their fucking homes &amp; being thrown out on the street, and a whole hell of a lot of them aren‚Äôt going to be able to feed their families or afford medication‚Äîwhat do we say to them? ‚ÄúWait until Biden‚Äôs in office &amp; hope we can push him left‚Äù
Why would you ever in a million years believe that liberals would do anything under a Biden presidency except make excuses for his crackdown on protestors, the same exact way they make excuses for him now &amp; the same exact way they made excuses for Obama
It‚Äôs not pushing Democrats left, it‚Äôs seizing back power &amp; demanding compliance‚Äîit‚Äôll be just as crucial under a Biden administration as it will under Trump, and the crackdown retaliation we‚Äôll have to anticipate, prepare for &amp; deal with will be exactly the same in either case
The Dems are pushing Biden &amp; Harris explicitly because they won‚Äôt move left‚Äîeverything from welcoming Republicans like George W. Bush &amp; John Kasich into the party to fully embracing the Lincoln Project are as clear an indicator as you could ask for that they‚Äôre only moving right
It‚Äôs gonna keep going up now, Biden‚Äôs too
Well he‚Äôs a Biden supporter in the sense that he seems to genuinely believe in the system that produced the Biden/Harris ticket, and in how he keeps arguing that there‚Äôs some sort of actual honest-to-god value in the idea of trying to push Biden left after the election
‚ÄúTrump has to be stopped, he‚Äôs a dictator with no respect for the law willing to do anything to stay in power‚Äîhe could very well lose the election &amp; still refuse to leave the White House‚Äù  Oh shit oh god what should we do  ‚ÄúVote for Biden‚Äù  Ok but‚Äî  ‚ÄúShut the fuck up &amp; do it‚Äù
So wait are you saying that by recognizing how Biden‚Äôs objectively as terrible as Trump, it means I still think the election matters  I‚Äôm honestly asking because it doesn‚Äôt make any more sense now than it did the first time you said it &amp; I feel like I must be misunderstanding you
This is one is one tradition that should never be stopped. Deblasio is being run by his radical wife and daughter just like Biden will be run by Camelo
1.) She doesn‚Äôt represent progress‚Äîshe‚Äôs every bit as awful as Clinton  2.) Democrats have been making empty promises for decades &amp; Biden served eight years alongside one of the worst offenders  3.) Removing those statues saved how many lives &amp; abolished how many police forces
Racists don't patronize inferiors. By '16 urban jobs were oversees &amp; Illegals were scooping up the dregs. Trump went after jobs, illegals plus enterprise zones. Cities are working. Racist like Biden don't give 2nd chances, just life sentences. Trump listens.
I‚Äôll add for good measure (in order to make fun of how pathetic and entitled Joe Kennedy III is) that JFK was the first of many austerity Dems which morphed into the Corporate Neoliberalism of Bill Clinton, Obama, and Joe Biden that pervades the party today.

Biden, uh  Biden chose Kamala Harris because she was the only other candidate as far right as he is, and this isn‚Äôt a slippery slope into anything except Kamala being in the White House for three straight terms as Republicans complete their takeover of the party

That‚Äôs all you‚Äôre saying now‚Äîearlier you were arguing that there‚Äôs some sort of realistic possibility that Biden &amp; Harris give even a single solitary fuck what the people want
So am I, Mr Biden.
Well when you‚Äôre arguing that you can push Biden &amp; Harris left once they‚Äôre in office when literally all they‚Äôve done is move further &amp; further right in the lead up to the election where they still need our votes to actually win, then yeah wishcasting is exactly what you‚Äôre doing
For 50 years, Biden has been lying, plagiarizing, &amp; stretching the truth on a daily basis. Harris is just the same. When Biden gets caught he gets louder and threatens sit up fights.

Omg yes! They are already laying the groundwork with the ant  Biden website bs yesterday üòÇüòÇ
It‚Äôs just like the previews/opener at any movie/concert....Biden is the opener you pay little mind to bc Kamala is the main performer
Of course if Biden wins, the Republicans in 2021 will suddenly discover that Article II gives the president almost no power. And if Dems take both houses, they'll find that Article I is also toothless. That'll leave Article III, but only for right-wing judges.
Hey  you should give  MORE speaking time than to billionaires and never-Trump Republicans. As well as to other speakers who appeal to younger voters.  Biden's biggest weakness is among young voters. Why not use the convention to help fix that?

I‚Äôm voting for Biden as a harm reduction measure. Nothing more. I do not support the Democrat party or their candidate. The Democrats won‚Äôt fix shit, they‚Äôll just stop making it worse as quickly.
&amp; if you want further evidence that Harris was indeed the ‚Äúsafe‚Äù choice, look no further than the very positive reaction of stocks in S&amp;P, Nasdaq. Up baby! Investors don‚Äôt see Biden/Harris doing much to hurt their profits. Warren on the other hand...Now that would‚Äôve been bold
Zerlina, I strongly disagree. Nor, do I think it was ‚Äúbold‚Äù as  said yest. Biden is ol‚Äô school but he ain‚Äôt stupid. He knows which way wind is blowing - who saved HIM. Folks like me would‚Äôve REVOLTED if he DID NOT pick a BLACK woman.The TIMES pushed Biden to Harris.
I believe Kamala Harris will be doing some heavy lifting...
The senior vote will result in a Biden win theoretically, but the problem is that the incumbent will challenge results in all ythose states to force a contingent election.
Kamala Harris woke up today a different person.   The fake news media named her a moderate.  She is no longer a dirty cop.  They forgot to tell joe biden before he picked her.   What a nasty trick .
You're not being honest with yourself if you say Biden is in a good mental state.
This should be the Biden-Harris campaign slogan.

Again‚Äîthere is absolutely no reason to believe this  Literally everything about Biden‚Äôs career, his campaign, his VP‚Äîall of it makes clear in no uncertain terms that Biden &amp; Harris will be moving nowhere after being elected except further right  So what are you basing this on
I said something! When I saw she said Biden will not make it in November, I said to myself, what a dumb comment she said on live tv! Fox needs to fire her
why didn‚Äôt you televise any of the Biden/Harris campaign speech?
The Kamala Harris pick: Did Democrat Joe Biden slip on his second banana?
Sometimes comedy write's itself. Sometimes reality helps. Then there's Biden/Harris.
They‚Äôre the same to everyone for whom nothing will fundamentally change  Literally the only difference is that Trump‚Äôs a loose cannon, so corporate media goes after him when he undermines the interests of the donor class‚Äîbut as with Obama &amp; Bush, they‚Äôll be complicit under Biden
Biden has already spent months surrounding himself with Wall Street execs, he‚Äôs got right-wing bigot John Kasich speaking at the convention, he still refuses to push for single-payer during a global pandemic crisis &amp; this is all when he still needs our votes to get elected
I'm not voting for Biden but doesn't the fact that she has to "rebound" from her record beg the question...Why? If she did an ethical job and followed her conscience, why must she defend what she did? Again. I'm no fan of hers but this is what we do now and its wrong.
Biden is old and senile, and a Pedophil, but she is as dumb as a doorknob, prison parents of children for truancy, while leaving her junkies on the street., she only knows one way to get a head! HeadüòÇüò≠üòÖü§£üòÜüòúü§™ü§° she is dumber than most 16 year olds!
No. he means Biden.
It's Biden. Of course not
What a terrible vp pick. Not a single voter would change their mind for Biden because of her.
Everyone I've heard &amp; spoken to,seems to think Kamala Harris is a nasty woman. She sounds condescending. She said some pretty rotten things about Joe Biden himself. She says what suits her own success. I don't think I'm the only American that has this opinion.
I watched your speech after you were announced as Biden's VP. I know there wasn't a large audience there while you were speaking that could adequately communicate to you the incredible sense of joy we feel. You should know many of us stood up at home &amp; gave U a standing ovation!
Intelligence is wasted on him anyway. Trump has pretty much eliminated daily intelligence briefings. Biden has already started receiving them.
Funny you should mention that, it and being a woman are the only two qualifications anyone on the left and most notably Joe Biden has mentioned. You know why? So that unless you say she is perfect in every way the  you‚Äôre racist/sexist chorus will be deafening! So transparent!
If and it's a big IF Biden/Harris win Biden won't last a month after election decision.
‚Å¶I‚Äôm all in after hearing  today. #BidenHarris2020
Yeah just not for Trump or Biden
LMFAO! Obama/Biden economy was based on taxpayer funding, doubled the National Debt and still had high employment, low workforce participation, huge number on food stamps. Nice try!
Has anyone else notice for two days ( since Biden‚Äôs announcement) major cable news networks have not covered trumps press conferences????
Did you say ‚Äúpeople that can speak in sentences‚Äù that‚Äôs pretty good, you were including #Biden in that? That‚Äôs even better!
Kamala Harris: Countries rush to celebrate Biden's running mate
That statement alone should be the end of Biden/Harris campaign.
you hate politics then you go on to discredit Biden for attending a Klansman‚Äôs funeral without mentioning it was Robert Byrd‚Äôs funeral who had 52 years of public service where McConnell gave an eulogy and where every Republican leader praised the former Senator.
If there are two ppl to easily take to apart, it's heels up Kamala and that doddering old fool Biden.  I mean really,  they are just empty shells. If it wasn't for the podium panels for ole Joe to read, he'd still be stuttering. C'mon man. üòÇüòÇüòÇü§£
A vote against someone is still a vote for someone, and I refuse to vote for someone I don‚Äôt believe in. We keep getting shit options because they just believe we have to take what we can get. Trump is a reflection of the country and it‚Äôs been exposed, but Biden in office just -

I disagree with you about Biden being a decent man. I must say though I would never guess you to be Biden's age. You look like you might be in your early sixties. Biden looks like he's about 90
Listening to Joe Biden and Kamala Harris reintroduce to America what true leadership and moral character sounds like.  Tune in if you can...  there may actually be a light at the end of this horrific Trump administration.

And isn‚Äôt Kamala a rape apologist for accepting the offer? She is on record saying she believes Biden‚Äôs accusers and respects them for coming forward.
Do you have any idea how thoroughly you embarrass yourself by Saying conservative network exists to tear down Joe Biden is there an equivalent for Trump? Perhaps the single most disingenuous hypocritical audible feces ever dropped from any orafice anywhere ever in history!

Let the best woman/man team win!! Biden/Harris...
And CNN and MSNBC will ignore them as they broadcast Trump claiming Biden and Harris are hiding in their respective basements.
I would agree on the one hand, but on the other hand, I think Biden will obliterate him. Trump can be utterly destroyed from 99 different directions.  The fat man can't think on his feet, and he has no substance to stand on, so...
I agree with  . Biden is to much of a coward to take a solid position and stand up for it. His eel like backbone will become more evident over time. Add this to all of the other Biden issues he'll really prove to be presidential. NOT
so y‚Äôall really voting for Coonmala and ‚Äúyou ain‚Äôt blacc‚Äù Biden? üëÄüëÄ
I think it just might be the simple reason. Biden stupidly &amp; cowardly boxed himself in to a women of color. Give me a credible option significantly better than Harris. None of them, including Harris, are qualified. All have baggage
Bucks County white woman here and I cannot wait to vote for Biden/Harris!
Good morning FB family, so it‚Äôs Biden &amp; Harris...45 is stewing now trying his best to do what he does just make up stuff and throw it on the wall to see what sticks....but it‚Äôs too late now...let‚Äôs say this together to 45.....November is coming....November is coming.....!
I can't believe  is actually going to cover anything related to Biden--they will they cut away immediately if Trump sneezes and tells them to air it.  All evening long the entertainment personalities bash Trump, but structurally, MSNBC and CNN are Trump allies.
I am thrilled with Kamala as the VP choice but Jim Clyburn just said on CNN that a lot of people did not support her for President because they wanted to see her as Biden‚Äôs. VP, wow, what a sad fucking statement that says about those black folks.
He just listed a lot of reasons to support the Biden/Harris ticket
I believe Harris will have an effect on the election. Half of Democrats don't think Biden will make it through his first term. The question is, does anyone really believe Kamala Harris can run our country? She was already run out of the primaries very early on
Which is what, exactly?
Joe Biden is only the 4th catholic nominee for president, and the first catholic Vice President
Joe Biden isn‚Äôt catholic? Are you sure about that?
Harris is not your problem Donald Dump Biden is stop your racist rant on Harris and concentrate on Biden.
Kamala Harris is an opportunist who will sell her soul for power.  Just like Biden did.  Guess she no longer cares if he fears kids growing up in a racial jungle.
Kamala Harris may choose to laugh at everything, but i don't think she is funny at all.She laughs at her withholding exonerating evidence in case of death row inmate.    Life with biden is not funny.
She should be easy to beat.  She adds nothing to Biden's bid.   Nasty to the core.  don't be surprised if she leads his impeachment team.
Biden picks the weakest mate, Kamala is the most acerbic candidate. Why?  It takes one to know one.
Why are so many Trump supporters outraged by this? Y‚Äôall keep saying that trump is gonna win, so why do you care so much about who Biden picked?
What ever happened to  She would of been the perfect VP pick and could easily take over for Biden.
by Oct 15, Joe Biden will leave the ticket and K Harris will decide that for him.   Be ready, America.  Amazing how many young people are ready to endorse him and her without any understanding at all.
You were on my timeline!!!  LOL lowest unemployment,  opportunity zones, fully funded HBCUs, prison reform, first step act. More than Obama/Biden did in 8 years!!!  Actions, not words!!
Trump's last TV ad lied and claimed Biden supported defunding the police. He doesn't. Trump's latest ad lies again and claims Biden will keep kids out of school for four years. He won't. Trump lies about everything and his cult follows their leader. A sociopath's culture.
Biden didn't pick Kneepads Harris - someone else did

I‚Äôd be voting for the Biden-anybody ticket, but I am a big fan of  she‚Äôs the candidate I supported during the primary season, I was sad she dropped out before I could cast a vote for her in PA, but I will cast a vote for her in November
I feel like Biden is already on life support
HELL YA I'VE VOTING FOR BIDEN !
Choosing Kamala is such a poorly thought out decision. Like, yeah I don‚Äôt care who it is anyway, but Biden choosing a cop is so unsurprising and seems not thought out
I‚Äôm supporting Joe Biden for president because he‚Äôll be a steadfast advocate for our nation‚Äôs public school students and educators.   Will you pledge to support Joe, too?
Where have you been?  Biden announced it this afternoon.
It‚Äôs so weird to see sensible conservatives back the Biden campaign.  Shows we aren‚Äôt so divided.
#foxnews  Kamala Harris and Joe Biden. Forget about it.  President Trump 2020!
how can you honestly defend Joe Biden? Can't you see he's out of his mind? Probably early dementia? How can you defend him on TV? What's wrong with you? And Trump will fix our economy just like he made it the strongest in 50 years
Just to be clear, You are the same person who about a year ago was in agreement that the women coming forward against Biden were telling the truth. Can we expect this type of wishy washy behavior in office as well? hard pass thanks. #Trump2020

Only a short time will prove that Biden did not have anything to say about his running mate.  She was selected by the party leaders, and will soon move to remove him from the ticket.   It is not a thing yet.
We're going to beat you and Biden. The silent majority is much stronger than you know.
Yup. Circa 2023, when Biden gets the 25th Amendment invoked.
Congratulations! Biden-Harris....the only choice for those who care about Democracy.
Joe Biden selects California Sen. Kamala Harris as running mate
GREAT TICKET!!!! I knew it would be no matter what, but this is what I was hoping for.   Joe Biden selects Senator Kamala Harris to be his vice presidential running mate
Very ironic that the WWF wrestler "Kamala", real name James Harris, died a few days ago, and Kamala Harris is selected as Biden's running mate today.
The funny thing is, Trump bashed Biden today for committing to a female VP, so...
I want a Biden-Harris sticker, and I want it NOW!
We need a return to sanity! Vote Biden/Harris!!
Biden picks Harris for VP -
reminder.....there are no unicorns in politics.....Biden could have picked a bologna sandwich and I‚Äôd still vote for him.... Trump must be defeated!!  Period!!  Full Stop!!

Biden on cusp of historic running mate announcement
Guess what the excuse will be for Dems doing absolutely nothing during a Biden administration?  1) Russia/China.  2) The GOP is impeaching Joe so there‚Äôs literally nothing he can do during a 2-year debacle.  3) Finding ‚Äúmiddle-ground‚Äù with Republicans trying to impeach him.  ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Three of Biden's potential picks pose a serious threat to him.  Word is already out that if one of those 3 not yet to be identified, is selected she will be a force leading the Impeach Biden effort within one month of the inauguration.   Be careful, Joe.

Monmouth poll: Biden holds 10-point lead over Trump -
The reason why I'm predicting a 269-269 tie again this year is because Biden was one of the servants of Clinton, Bush, and Obama who created the conditions that resulted in trump getting elected. The old testament is being repeated here. 7 years of feast then 7 years of famine.
I think it would be incredibly helpful for somebody to walk you through why Biden‚Äôs means-tested ‚Äúfree college‚Äù plan is incredibly inefficient &amp; so needlessly complicated that it will inevitably exclude a significant number of the very families it‚Äôs ostensibly designed to help
I was wondering when that was going to go up, Biden is up 8 now
But it is what the majority wants  Biden‚Äôs plan is corporate welfare that does nothing but perpetuate our already-unsustainable private for-profit system  Grow up‚Äîjust because he won the primary doesn‚Äôt mean he‚Äôs entitled to votes without doing anything to actually earn them
So no, ‚Äúmost people‚Äù do not prefer Biden‚Äôs plan
&amp; I totally appreciate yours, Korte. I‚Äôm so thru w/ neoliberalism too. Phrases/words I now hate: ‚Äúbuilding on Obamacare‚Äù - excuse to block M4ALL. Susan Rice - love her sass but enough. Biden ‚Äúknows us‚Äù - taking base for granted. 4 More Yrs of Trump- nothing compares to this virus

Biden‚Äôs ramble???!  Have you heard Trump speak.
This shit is even more horrifying in the midst of an actual honest-to-god global pandemic  If Biden is genuinely serious about winning this election he has to adopt a sweeping single-payer Medicare for All system‚Äîit‚Äôs such a no brainer and there‚Äôs literally no reason not to do it
Most people do not prefer Biden‚Äôs plan &amp; are in fact sick &amp; tired of having to ration their own care &amp; medication or go bankrupt because their copays &amp; deductibles have been spiraling out of control for decades while their coverage shrinks exponentially
If Biden wants to win, he has to adopt Medicare for All‚Äîit‚Äôs incredibly popular &amp; an overwhelming majority of Americans want it  Unless we force him to do it in order to earn our votes, Trump wins  So if you really want Trump out, why are you fighting so hard to get him reelected
It certainly does matter. ESPECIALLY if Biden doesn't finish his 1st week in office. Because of cognitive problems.
You mean like a 3 years of corrupt media, democrats incl.Obama/Biden and FBI droning a Russia collusion mantra echoing off each other to seem corroborative till many believe it so blindly that even a mountain of evidence proving it was a lie doesn‚Äôt phase them? Some expert
You have to go back to Ancient Israel. The House of Ahab is comprised of Ahab (Clinton), Jezebel (Hillary), Jehoram (Obama) and one of Jehoram's servants (Biden). Jehu (Trump) beat Jezebel in 2016 and is expected to beat the servant in 2020 according to the theory.

But please, let‚Äôs hear more about Biden‚Äôs mental acuity...
Yea you are right. They always say all the things they hate about trump that also applies to Biden but never say
How ya'll look complaining about government but then voting for Biden
And Biden also said ‚Äúif you don‚Äôt vote for me, you ain‚Äôt black‚Äù üòÇüòÇ no way any righteous black man could vote for him off of that statement alone.
Can anybody be more clueless than Murphy? He's making Biden look like a Rhodes scholar

Well Biden has  üòâüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
In 2011, Biden said that payroll tax cuts will spur the economy, and not threaten social security. Now, Biden and  say the opposite. NJ deserves better than a Gov that says a policy is good when his party proposes it, and bad when the other does.
A dead man being president would still be better than trump or Biden
Ok Savage part is a big NO..  But your Dad was spot on.. I love you Dad. Grew up his entire career. My only question here is a man JOE BIDEN who has been a Senator and VP for Generations and really what has he done?
Except the Communist party just endorsed Biden. There goes that narrative.
I wasn‚Äôt though üòÇ my entire point was that Biden is just as bad üòÇ it‚Äôs okay that you have to try to move the goalposts to win an argument. You failed hard though.
There's that Biden ad showing where we can't go--these are some countries whose citizens CAN go to the EU:  Algeria Australia Canada Georgia Japan Morocco New Zealand Rwanda South Korea Thailand Tunisia Uruguay *China*, subject to confirm. of reciprocity
1000% When I hear name Susan Rice in VP chase, I gag. Same w/ Whitmer. WTF? If Biden wanna lose me, choose Whitmer. Don‚Äôt know exactly what to think of Harris. She‚Äôs been so wishy-washy ideologically thru her career. I have mad respect for you  Why do you like her?

Trump is Jehu. Biden was one of Jehoram's servants, so I am voting third party this year.
It's not that at all--Trump has had no problem demeaning Obama, Comey, Cruz, Rubio, Bush, McCain, Romney, etc., etc.  They know Biden is well liked and respected--and most importantly, he's not the slightest bit scary--that's why they look elsewhere for villains.
Biden is not Ahab. He is one of Jehoram's servants who was responsible with working with Ahab to write down the 1994 bill that produced the conditions necessary for Jehu to enter office.

You guys are watching Joe Biden‚Äôs basement exit on Monday morning?  Yeesh...
That gave me the chills. And not in a good way. It's so powerful. Dems have to work on messaging. Biden DEFINATELY got to work on his message. He has been laying low and he still gets in trouble. Focus Joe focus
That‚Äôs what we thought in 2016. Personally, I‚Äôm voting for Biden because my children need someone competent running the DOE.
Biden knows he needs the black vote to have a chance, slim as it is ...he‚Äôs a POS
Biden is one of Jehoram‚Äôs servants!
What are you talking about dude. It was Biden‚Äôs idea. He created the bill. He got support to pass it but it was Biden who created and wrote the bill.
Biden acts like one of Jehoram's servants.
Biden is actually one of Jehoram's servants.
I can tell you, they do believe what they‚Äôre saying. They believe. We‚Äôve all got these folks in our lives. These ‚Äúotherwise intelligent‚Äú folks that back Trump 100%, blame Gov. Wolf for everything, and think Joe Biden‚Äôs the one w/ dementia.
We're seeing the same Trump/Fox attempts at narrative manipulation related to Harris that we saw related to Biden during his campaign for the nomination. A sure sign Trump fears a Biden-Harris ticket the most.
So is Biden....
Biden work on Jehoram's team, which was ridiculed.
Biden doesn't have any.
LET THEM! The People are pushing Biden for Bernie's Policies which plainly benefit THE WORKING CLASS before &amp; over the wealthier!  Many have woke up to the Policies that worked under Pres. FDR and that's what the Republs FEAR MOST as they should.  WILL REBUILD THE MIDDLE CLASS !
Look Biden wasn‚Äôt my first choice but America deserves a president who can competently oversee regime change in South American countries that willfully threaten our oligarchy
Sec.Rice is well quaified to be VP or President. But her link to the Clintons gives Trump campaign fodder.  A Trump- Harris ticket is the best bet for America. I will, however, like all who cherish truth &amp; the constitution, vote Biden regardless of the ticket.

4 years ago Trump said to vote for him because ‚Äúwhat have you got to lose‚Äù I‚Äôm sure over 160,000 people didn‚Äôt think it would be their life. So vote Biden to get Trump the hell out of there, what have you got to lose

I dunno her saying such stuff or are you repeating what the media has been saying since she became Biden‚Äôs running mate?
Kayne is also extremely manic rn and needs mental help. Trump is the literal definition of racism and everything wrong with America. If he gets four more years, he‚Äôs definitely gonna try to be a dictator. We cant afford that. Sadly Biden has to be it. The democrats failed us.
Biden has asked governors nationwide to mandate mask-wearing for at least 3 months to beat Covid as students return to school, per ABC.
Trump also urges Americans to wear masks but opposes a national requirement. Plus: The NFL tries to virus-proof stadiums, and local school officials struggle with reopening difficulties.
Biden can‚Äôt tell me what to do. My President Donald J. Trump can and I will listen and follow.
So Harris owes $1 million in unpaid bills from her unsuccessful run for president and Biden wants you all to donate to pay it off.
It started with a tweet from Dr. Jill Biden. ‚ÄúHey (Douglas Emhoff). Are you ready?‚Äù she asked. ‚ÄúReady to work! Let‚Äôs go (Dr. Jill Biden)!‚Äù he wrote back. So who is Douglas Emhoff?

Absolutely correct. I also don‚Äôt think it would have stopped the riots in Seattle and Portland, etc. The radical left would have still did their thing. Remember I said this if Biden wins. IT will still continue unabated until we get enough of it once and for all and stop it!

Correct me if I'm wrong but Biden was notoriously one of the poorest Senators when he was a Senator.
I have never been a Republican but the party used to have integrity and I could always respect that. Seems I am not alone. So many notable GOP figures have declared a vote for Biden rather than support the GOP candidate this time. They are still Republicans, but Trump is too much

The head of your party, Trojan Joe Biden, publicly declared blacks are incapable of thinking for themselves which makes them slightly worse than latinos. Looks like the Democrats are going to have to own that, don‚Äôt it?
Rape is sexual abuse yes they're in the same category but there is a difference between forcing yourself on a child and having non consensual sex and the (still disgusting things) Biden did on TV.
Priceless. Biden will ask him the same question at the debates.
Rape has a set of rules that make it rape i am not defending biden I think everything he does on camera is absolutely wrong but it 100 percent is not rape and labeling that takes away from actual instances of rape from people in power.

OPINION: When Trump inevitably insults Kamala Harris with misogynistic and racist stereotypes, she and Joe Biden should respond with positivity. His hatred will alienate voters and help the Democrats win in 2020.
Biden vs Trump.
biden voters think that america was bad for 4 years tops
Amazing. This Murray guy apparently has no job but to jump on Trumps tweets the moment he tweets. No buddy NYC will NOT vote for communist/fascist dictators like Biden and Harris. I live here. I know. Me and everyone I know in NYC are saying NO to that scum.
Why was the DNC trying to stop him to begin with? His policies were good for the American people and they‚Äôre now peddling watered down versions of of his policies to get us to vote for Biden. For what?

Arguing with Bernie-or-Busters isn't to beat Trump. The left will not cost Biden the election. It's to make the left a part of a voter bloc that SOMEONE wants to win over in 2024, rather than make them the same fucking afterthought they were before 2016.
It really does suck, I agree. But things can actually improve. There are several progressive candidates winning Congress and they'll probably push the administration toward the left, in case Biden wins and the election is not stolen.
No, I have some data. More Biden voters intend to v-b-m vs. Trump voters, who disproportionately favor in-person voting. This partisan division has opened up b/c of Trump's statements re v-b-m. 1/
You have to be such an Idiot. What, when, and where had Biden done anything? Can you mention something that Sleepy Joe had done, other than sell the country to China along with Hunter....
I really wish Biden was who you claim he was, because then we'd actually be able to lock you up after he wins. Fortunately for you, he's not who you claim.

Going to be amazing when they have to work with Biden
Sad to say, but it's all too predictable that Biden will say something like, "Our country needs to heal, we aren't going to look backward, we're going to move forward", and not hold Trump accountable. Same as Obama did not hold Bush accountable.

Funny how suggesting both candidates meet a neutral Black leader is some how sabotaging Biden campaign. Why is it that his campaign is so dependent on Black people getting the shaft n not complaining about it? Seems like they want to continue business like usual not change things
Sure, Trump has deep respect for the law, so much so that he sees himself &amp; his buddies as completely above it!  The reality is that NYC will vote for Biden in large numbers &amp; this endorsement will have zero impact on the overall electoral result.   #BidenHarris2020

Understood, so Dems need to vote by mail as early as possible, ideally before Oct 3rd. And making a digital record of your signed ballotwith your face is very important. The DNC can then set up a blockchain to record all data and have a record in each State of total Biden  votes

As this political circus is rolling out I see Dems as true task masters.Even as much as Biden telling black ppl,‚Äùyou ain‚Äôt black if ur not Dem‚Äù.That was NOT a gaffe,he truly believes it.They R control freaks,even highjacked the BLM.Wants to control mask wearing,THINK about it.
I have no problem saying that what Bernie is doing NOW, is evil. What I don't know is was he or his family threatened gbecause he, unlike Michelle, has a long documented record of fighting against everything Biden and Harris stand for.

cause most of us would see through this BS going on  they want votes but offer nothing to get us to vote  you can not run on trump bad  they need to offer some change  biden said nothing will change

President Trump gets endorsement from NYC police union, says ‚Äúno one will be safe in Biden‚Äôs America‚Äù while speaking on Friday.
The real issue is that senile Biden dissed the black community, choosing a brown woman of immigrants, when blacks wanted a black VP women; instead, sneaky Biden turned it into "A Woman of Color," and chose a VP who married outside the race &amp; religion, in a Hindu ceremony. FRAUD!

100% and I don‚Äôt understand Republicans that say ‚ÄúI hate Trump‚Äù therefor i will vote for Biden? I wonder if you have ever looked at Biden‚Äôs AFFH Policy. I‚Äôm in investment. This would federalize local zoning and totally destroy the suburbs.

So? I was saying it's a shame Biden doesn't support any universal plan. That wasn't a call out, it's just a fact.
If Trump had his henchmen traveling around the country chopping off Biden supporters' fingers so they couldn't vote, the Democrats would call for hearings into the practice to be held two months from now. Republicans would laugh and not show up.

Man, "a keen sense of what the voters can put up with", a label that seems vaguely pejorative when Damir uses it, sounds pretty good to me. I found this summing up of Biden's plausible foreign policy approaches to be pretty heartening.

Biden is your answer?  He is not honest, he is a career politician,  he is Racist, he does not answer questions, he has flip flopped on everything. He has little energy, he will raise taxes.  Vote for a Democratic platform but not for the man, he is not better than Trump.
At least Trump allows reporters to ask questions, Biden does not even do that, from now on he will let his VP answer for him, or his wife.  Sad.
Do you think Biden has answered the though questions?  Infrequently, He does answer questions where the answers pop up on the teleprompter.

common sense?  you have no common sense, stop being a sheep.
I‚Äôm an immigrant and dislike Trump a lot, Biden is not for the people. He has a history of bring racist, sexist, , and he‚Äôs also mentally ill. He can‚Äôt even formulate a sentence without stuttering 20x. At least Trump is a devil we already know.
No matter who Biden chose for his VP there would be complaints. No need to beat me or anyone else in the head with how you feel.
First debate Biden finished/gone.  Kamela Harris, fill void presumptive presidential candidate. Option 2 broker convention.
Wall Street leaders cheered Joe Biden‚Äôs selection of Sen. Kamala Harris as his running mate in the presidential election.
The propaganda machine is frantically looking for ways to erase Biden‚Äôs 8 point lead.
Yesterday, Joe Biden officially selected Kamala Harris to be his running mate for the 2020 presidential election. Of both Jamaican and Indian ancestry, she will become the first African American and Asian American female Vice President if the ticket wins in November.
Thank you! Nobody wants Biden and Kamala but I‚Äôll take my chances with them over Trump any day....y‚Äôall really want another 4 years with Trump???
. extreme positions, from raising taxes to abolishing private health insurance to comparing law enforcement officials to the KKK, show that the left-wing mob is controlling  candidacy, just like they would control him as president.
too much to assume that Harris' veep selection cements Warren at Treasury if Biden wins?
Your a very confused person.  Sad to read all the nonsense you post. Almost unbelievable, so why is that you believe Kamala Haris hates our country? How is it that Biden will hurt the bible? How will he hurt God? These are the comments I've heard thrown around.. enlighten us pls.
Former VP Joe Biden has chosen Sen. Kamala Harris to join him on the Democratic ticket.
That sounds like a pretty good selling point for Biden. #BidenHarris2020

As a Black and Indian American woman raised by immigrant parents west of the Mississippi, Kamala Harris‚Äô background resonates with huge swaths of the country. Here's what she brings to Joe Biden's campaign for president.Hahaha... you lost all your credibility when you praised Biden and the ‚Äúblack -Indian‚Äù, oppressor and a fake!
This is what happens when #FakeNews only shows one side or a narrated version of the news. Not report but mediate and tell a tale. After all it's all about the narrative. Young Voters Love Trump's COVID Plan...When Told It's Biden's
God did bless America,  Biden got in the race and he's going to beat you like a drum! You are the greatest danger to this country,  even more than gun violence. We can change people's behavior in reference to guns, but you on the other hand is trying to change our foundation.
...soooo did she falsely accuse Biden? Did she believe everything she said? ‚ÄúIt was a debate!‚Äù lol total joke
I dunno how any police org could endorse Biden
This is what September 5 is all about - if we don‚Äôt get in the streets now Trump is most likely gonna winnor steal the election. And if we don‚Äôt get in the streets now,in our millions, to stop fascism then Biden is effectively the only opposition.
You‚Äôre a well known hypocrite at this point. After you went after Biden for sexual impropriety then defended Buttar and now Morse for the same things you have no credibility. You‚Äôre a far-left hack. This is why you‚Äôre goofed on all the time.

I hope this flies too. What I like here, all about the DNC, Harris speaks Wednesday, Biden Thursday, when he ad Harris are formally niminated.
Remember to vote everyone!  And don‚Äôt be complacent because Biden is so far ahead in the polls. We need to make this the biggest blowout ever to get Trump to leave
Disingenuous, if you have a problem with divisiveness take a saunter over to the side screaming ‚Äúeveryone who votes for Biden loves segregationists‚Äù

Qanon is not the new Tea Party. It's is hate group - an extreme right wing hate group who participate in hate crimes. If Biden wins then crawl back under the rocks from which they came. Or they're arrested &amp; marginalized.
No - you misunderstood. Hanity didn't suggest stopping those things in the MeidasTouch video. He was saying it about Democrats, MeidasTouch edited the video to appear as though he was saying it about Trump. He was not. He was saying it about Dems, about Joe Biden.

Seems to me it's the old moron that YOU elected that can't seem to handle this country and it's issues. All the bad is happening on Trump's watch. He is the failure. Trump is the LOSER. Nominating Biden has nothing to do with the lack of a high functioning government.

Hi all! I will wait another year for the NFL season as long as its Biden (he's an Eagle fan) he will be at the first game!
Est. sellouts dropped out quickly &amp; got on Biden's bandwagon after South Carolina in order to crush the progressive left. If Trump crushes them in November, I have no sympathy whatsoever. They get what they deserve.
The only reason to vote for Biden/Harris is that they would be a weaker regime to overthrow
Biden was telling people to vote at polling places in a pandemic &amp; he &amp; the Est. used it successfully to get Bernie to drop out. Now Obama &amp; the rest of them are crying about Trump cheating, hilarious.
Biden‚Äôs not a puppet...unlike Trump...Paul Manafort picked Mike Pence!  (Not sure there were too many folks eager to be Trump‚Äôs running mate anyway!) Biden could‚Äôve chosen any one of those incredibly talented &amp; accomplished women...and you would have made the same false claim!
Not swing but presumably substantial Biden votes.
It‚Äôll be the same with a facelift instead of orange hair, just as inarticulate, and Biden might gin up a war.
i don‚Äôt get it at all either. their internal polling must seem awfully fucking grim. because to my mind all it does is light a fire under the opposition. you fuck with the mail like this and even the most bitter swing state bernie busters like me are gonna cast a biden ballot.
Umm so, 2/3rd saying they are more likely to support Biden with Harris? That's great! üòÜüòä Thank you for sharing this great news and high favor-ability of Kamala. üòäüôè
Obama &amp; Biden attacked your community. 3 million deportations. This is why Sanders crushed Biden with the Latino vote &amp; now credible reporting has stated that the Latino vote is not a part of the Biden team's path to victory.

Biden has been weirdly polling a little worse in PA than WI and MI. Though maybe to be expected since Trump won PA by more than the other 2 states. The PA loss was still most shocking to me in '16 cycle maybe because I'm from here and Clinton spent the time here.

Can you answer this question if Trump wins will Biden,Comma-la and all the socialist Dems go quietly? Or are we going to have another round of burning down cities, rioting and looting? I want a Democratic  politician to answer these questions!
In a way this suggests WI and MI are more likely to go Biden than PA. If he gets WI, MI, he only needs 1 more state.   Or every Clinton state + PA + MI + more conservative Maine CD and liberal Nebraska CD gets him to 270 exactly.
This is interesting so now maybe PA is the tipping point state and not WI, as everyone thought a year ago. Biden has gotten some great polls from WI lately.

Good people can be blinded and make bad decisions. It's a shame they're often also so blinded by their fear, they attack others for making different decisions with the same rationale. Difference is Biden voters are short-term thinkers, Hawkins voters are long-term thinkers.

I love it when #BlueMAGA types say, "Biden is for X, look at his webpage!" Facts are, he's not campaigning on a single one of those things. He's campaigning on "morals". Sorry if I don't believe a webpage he probably didn't read himself.
I can't think of one member of Congress who treats the people as their bosses. They pay lip service to it, but they don't believe it. Biden made that clear when he responded to the manufacturing worker who dared question his proposed 2A policies ("I don't work for YOU!").

Exactly.  Biden is so bad, and will ruin the country, so lets tell everyone about it so we discourage them all from voting.  After all, Trump is so much better.  I can't wait for 4 more years.

"The Ultimate Recovery: Cycles of Pain Anchor Biden's Moment" by The Associated Press via NYT
Why was the DNC trying to stop him to begin with? His policies were good for the American people and they‚Äôre now peddling watered down versions of of his policies to get us to vote for Biden. For what?
Funny how suggesting both candidates meet a neutral Black leader is some how sabotaging Biden campaign. Why is it that his campaign is so dependent on Black people getting the shaft n not complaining about it? Seems like they want to continue business like usual not change things

So we‚Äôre not gonna discuss the calls Obama made behind the scenes for the strategic dropout of all the moderates before South Carolina so the votes could go to Biden? And Warren strategically staying in the race with no chance of winning to split the progressive vote from Bernie?
And Biden isn't even in government now wow your really messed up
My man just gobbling White dick and calling it empowerment üò™ which celebrity or talking head told you evicting Trump was Black people top priority like racism is all trump and his folks. Like Biden n Kamala aren‚Äôt as anti Black as him but in sheep clothes. Wake up
Gotta say Joe Biden can stop short of killing someone on 5th and I'm still voting for him.  #FuckOctoberSurprise
Unless Biden goes into complete basement mode and lets Harris be the surrogate, I don't think the focus on her lasts more than a couple of weeks. Chatter will still come up.  But do you think they'd just ignore Biden?  I support him, and recognize there is MATERIAL on him.

I will not say his name bc you are an evil disrespectful person what you did to joe Biden during the debate was awful you called him a predator!  So mean
But I'm sorry you rather have a weak puppet who hands Iran $1.6 billion then a president that invest in our military secure our boarders  from drugs and illegals and puts our best interest the legal US citizens of this country. Biden is a fake. A loser. Just like his followers

Sure that will be um. Never. üòÇüòÇüòÇ. At the end realistically speaking Biden is weak he will be crushed by other world leaders  he is a puppet he is not strong he is being controlled now by his own party it's a joke  he's no leader never was and never will be
Biden doesn't even know what day it is today let alone trying to tell the entire country to wear masks. Even if he does become President, this won't make it through Congress because Republicans and Democrats will fight each other the whole time.

Afraid if Biden has to answer a question off the top of his head, he won‚Äôt know what‚Äôs going on without teleprompter or notes. They again, he could always tell us his CORNPOP story.
If one can‚Äôt vote in person they should be able to vote by mail. Now, let‚Äôs say at the end of the allotted time thousands of Biden votes don‚Äôt get counted because the mail isn‚Äôt on time. My mail takes 5 days to get to another state. ü•øü•æ üò©ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

üòÇüòÇüòÇ. You must be on acid. Biden will never be president. That loser locked himself in the basement the past six months did nothing to denounce these riots did nothing in the past 50 years frankly. But will Enjoy watching you loser liberals  crying again in November though.
It‚Äôs like Max Rose proudly retweeting a Joe Biden quote about assemblywoman ‚ÄúLauren Malliotakis‚Äù
She‚Äôs a complete idiot! But yeah,vote for her to be 1st in line when Biden slips into full on dementia! America is done if she‚Äôs in charge!!

So many weak people that really don‚Äôt understand!! There are no Democrats there are only far Radical left! Using joe Biden he won‚Äôt be in office for long
Was never my first choice either but I will crawl through smoldering wreckage to vote for Biden if I have to. Framing it in these terms is basically whining about having to make difficult choices in order to save democracy in this country.
Thats the thing the Biden ticket is offering the same old okey doke, zero solutions.

You LOST me at "The Biden-Harris ticket is formidable"   The only and I mean ONLY way  loses in 2020 is Election?Voter Fraud........
My reply to VP Biden's email:
Serious question: is there an actual political strategy here, or are you just being an idiot. You are aware Biden won‚Äôt be spending a dime in New York no matter what you tweet, right.
I think his chances of 2024 are done if Biden wins which I fully expect.  I highly doubt Kamala would step aside. Maybe a shot at VP though.
That little baby boy is probably crying because Biden made him bounce on his lap after playing with his wet leg hair ü•∫ü•∫
Want to scare your family into voting for Biden? Tell them that mom and dad / grandma and grandpa will never be allowed to leave the house again if Trump wins.
And Biden hides in his basement...good luck with him.
Biden fooled you and you believed it.
it seems that Biden did not pick an African. American woman. Le metieron gato por liebre.
Realistically no he has no shot, but politicians will say anything, just look at Joe Biden, I think he forgot kids can‚Äôt vote, but says he loves kids to stroke his leg hair for votes
So I guess Biden fits your standard of what a Catholic is then..
I suspect Amy K will be getting her reward soon.  After Clyburn, she did more to boost Biden's campaign than anyone. Both with the endorsement and gracefully bowing out of VP.  What Biden does for her is more important than Harris's graciousness.
A vote for Biden is a vote for this mess
wrong. his voters are accultured now to not wearing masks or believing in the dangers of covid...they will go to their local polling place and vote for him happily, even rationalizing that if they do die, it'll be for their country. biden voters are more cautious, so we're fucked
Educate yourself fool. This is the opposite of Biden‚Äôs 1994 Crime Bill.
First Step Act the opposite of Biden‚Äôs 1994 Crime Bill. Educate yourself fool.
Biden can't pronounce his own name at this point.
I have every ounce of faith in Biden that he can do what he needs to. First he has to fix the screw ups from trump. Then he &amp; Sen Harris will do whatever they have to , to progress our govt for the people for real

The literally whole 2020 election game plan has been to fear monger Trump. Especially where Black people are concerns. A Blue State could have a racial situation they refuse to address and it‚Äôs ‚ÄúLook how‚Äôs Trump doing us going vote Biden to stop this‚Äù
Why compare him to Obama instead of Biden ? Who he‚Äôs running against? And has 8 million follow- oh I see.
Biden's son had just died, Clinton had very recently been extremely popular, had great relationships with vital Dem constituencies, and oh yeah, won the fuckin' popular vote. Baring Comey and Wikileaks, she walks to the presidency. Because she lost doesn't make it a bad choice.
You have entirely too much faith that America the organization will stop going to war and that Biden once elected will appoint good judges that will be helpful to black society. Dems want to abolish BM and we still got to vote on those other issue, nice try tho
With Trump in office Black people‚Äôs eyes are open to the racism with Kamala and Biden many of us will be sheep. Who ever wins the plans are roughly the same only with Democrats in a opposition positions they will be more willing to come to the table with tangible next cycle.
‚ÄúThe American people have yet to get to know Joe Biden‚Äù ‚Äî GOP Pollster on  just now #BidenHarris2020
You can‚Äôt saying your not trying to let things get worst as you are campaigning for the worst option. Biden/Kamala can get more done in the form of oppressing Black society because they are positions as our ‚Äúteammates‚Äù. All eyes are on Trump so it‚Äôs easier to counter his racism.
How is Biden a centrist. I love how you act like he isn‚Äôt a proven racist who if given the presidency would quadruple the amount of Black people in prison. Motherfucker already promised to increase their budget not defund or demilitarize.
I just saw a Biden ad in NJ that was exactly like a trump ad. Buy American, bring American factories back etc. The trump campaign needs to nip these lies in the bud. ASAP.
How are they far worst? Can you point to any Trump policy that‚Äôs been as destructive to Black society as the Biden‚Äôs Law? You do know Kamala Harris refused to prosecute cops? Please explain how Biden/Kamala r the lesser of two evils to Black society? With words not talking points
Will Biden get national security briefings once nominated.  I'm interested on how that goes.
I think he should interview Biden/Harris and Trump/Pence
I have a Republican browbeating me in another thread to vote for Biden. He actually accused ME of being a fascist sympathizer.
This the type shit Biden and company gonna be on.. I don‚Äôt wanna go to jail y‚Äôall
Over 170,000 dead.  Over 5 million cases of Covid. Financial crisis of epic proportion. Rights being infringed upon. There IS no choice.  You don't have to like Biden, he is not your friend.  You just have to vote for him.  trump must go.
Biden is barely center left, you dipshits
I will also be voting for Biden sadly but it‚Äôs important to vote and it‚Äôs really important to get trump tf out.
Well that's the thing, Biden wants your vote more than he wants mine. Best of luck in Nov.
If you live in a state that isn‚Äôt likely to be an easy Biden win, you should consider voting in person, early if possible, if you feel you can do so safely. If you need to vote by mail, apply ASAP, and return your ballot in person if you can, mail it ASAP if you must mail it.
My democratic black family are not happy about Joe Biden &amp; Harris, the only ones I see celebrating are white liberals.  The same ones who were screaming BLM a few weeks back.  These people don't care about black lives.  I love seeing others see things for what they are.
I am going to share a post from one of my Republican friends in Facebook.   She posted this after it was announced that Joe Biden picked you for his running mate.   Go get ‚Äòem.   Rise above!
So your argument is "He is the President of the United States - why would we expect him to know about the 14th Amendment or even his own administration's legal position on this issue?" Biden or Harris could answer the question. Or Rubio or Haley - both children of non-citizens.
Biden &amp; Harris perfect combination to destroy that orange devil!! #2020
Everyone must want trump to win again, because if y‚Äôall keep bashing kamala or Biden, y‚Äôall got no choice but to let trump win again.

Thanks for the reply. I should probably disclose I'm kind of subtweeting a group of people, and not you. I'm so irritated w/ those who keep insisting Biden will prosecute Trump when he literally keeps telling us he won't. Fantasy and projection are not helpful in any way.

If Biden wins, it'll be the Cop/Mayo Pete in 2024 because Biden won't make it through to the end of the term.

please hold Biden accountable and ask him why he plagiarizes every speech?
We're gunna get more high-quality polls now after Biden picked a running mate and conventions start. There will probably be some bounces and marginal shifts.
Maybe Biden forgot he plagiarized? He is dementia.
This is as funny as kamala calling biden a rapist and a racist and being his VP lol
That's bad but biden saying black people ain't diverse is OK..lmaooo can't make this shit up
Joe Biden literally quit a previous Presidential run because of his lies, and yet he ran for both VP and President again.

looking forward to playing biden as the protagonist in whatever video game this is
You are so right about Biden's ideology. I suspect what's happening is the Dem establishment and Never Trump Republicans are consolidating power not to stop the fascism, but rather to crush the left.
Fact check: Trump promotes another birther lie, this time about Kamala Harris  *(And a whole bunch of other lies and racist comments.* MY VIEWS
Joe Biden can morph!!!
uh no we all know what happened on 9/11, dumbass. biden 2020
Former presidential candidate and Sen. Kamala Harris (D‚ÄìCalif.)¬†said last year that she believed three women¬†(Lucy Flores, Caitlyn Caruso, and D.J. Hill) who accused Biden of inappropriate touching or kissing. "I believe them and I respect them being able to tell their story
One thing is to be a trumper, but another thing is to be a Republican looking forward to see a new President this 2020 election. America more united than ever, with or without Mail-in-Ballots  One Nation  On November 3rd Trump is done!
That is why we need someone else other than biden I mean I we really saying biden is the best we can produce among democrat,give us charles Booker or Warren or Rice or ed Markey
(to be clear, what I mean is use access only afforded by one's role for political purposes - if it were open to everyone - if Biden and whomever the Greens and LP folk nominated could use the Whitehouse for this, less a problem)

Voting for Biden will bring this... This judge wants to destroy an 8-year old boy whose crazy mother wants him to be a girl. And they order the father to pay for it!
Not just that, but even biden getting more votes than trump doesn't necessarily even equal a biden win with the electoral college
If Biden wins, China will enter the US market even more aggressively than before. It‚Äôs a real threat.
And what if Biden doesn't win? It could happen! Yeah I don't want to think about it either but JFC stop selling out the absolute basics people should demand from government.

Because Bernie said nothing but the truth and the black base didn't come out for him at all. If not for covid there would have been a really fight between Bernie and Biden. It showed that a lot of 2016 probably came down to Hillary not exciting anyone.

Yes it is!!! Who knew Biden would launch #OGwisdom? Watch out!!! His Administration will roar!
Dumbass people only think theres 2 options in an election. Honestly Biden is worse than Trump but it‚Äôs trendy to hate Trump
I need answers !! Biden is NOT it
I wish Bob Barker was alive to play Joe Biden on SNL...
No. Biden/Harris being incredibly shitty candidates that will not change anything is what will help trump win
Of course I was never going to vote for Biden. It‚Äôs Medicare for All or no vote!
U.S. Coronavirus deaths: 167,789  How many of those would have lived if Trump hadn't decided to govern by spite and, among other things, throw away the Obama-Biden pandemic playbook?
Neither Blacks nor Indians are going to vote for Biden with such antics.
Sorry, don‚Äôt want a Biden administration. Medicare for All or no vote!
Bring 'em on. Biden picked somebody even tougher than he is. She can take 'em, and she can dish 'em right back out.  As Toby Ziegler would say, "Ginger, get the popcorn!"
Biden if 5X or 10X more respectful of the fundamental principles of democracy than  or your party. You're done in November.

6 terms in the Senate and 2 as Vice President vs. Going bankrupt running casinos. Biden isn't the one who failed in his chosen profession.

This was posted well before Biden announced his pick. I am not disappointed at all.
To all Dems complaining about the Kamala pick. First, I disagree and I‚Äôm happy with it. But also WHO CARES? I‚Äôd vote for Biden-Fork 2020, Biden-Owl 2020, Biden-Chair 2020. Esp. if you have a big platform, your tweets could discourage someone from voting. THIS IS NOT THE YEAR.
Putin isn't done. Putin needs another 4 years to totally dismantle our government. It's Biden vs. Putin.

You can't be this Stupid, Right??? Mail Trucks are Being Replaced with Brand New Ones Thanks To Trump, after Biden gave them No Money for his 8 years as VP.
Biden won‚Äôt have a cabinet overtly trying to dismantle the post office, dept of education, environmental regulations.  But will continue to serve Wall Street, health insurance industry, the fossil fuel industry etc
You Just Described Joe Biden, not Donald Trump.
In picking Harris, Biden makes history and plays it safe...strike that....plays it smart and boldly so.
Agreed, but if Trump and Biden were to ever get on stage together that‚Äôs basically murder. üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏ #Trump2020
If the commie hill is the one conservatives want to die on with Biden/Kamala then go right ahead.
THIS DECISION AINT EASY MY NIGGA!!!!! ITS EITHER BIDEN AND KAMALA OR TRUMP AND PENCE WE FUCKED EITHER WAY
I‚Äôm not trying to start an argument, probably more a discussion, but who would‚Äôve been your choice as Biden‚Äôs VP? I think Harris makes an interesting choice because her tough nature would appeal to people want a law and order administration. Biden is a transitional president.
Imagine being a part of the campaign that failed so miserably and gave us Trump and then having the nerve to call a rightfully frustrated citizen a douchebag. I‚Äôm voting for Biden and I hope all of my fellow progressives too but you people are so arrogant and irritating.
Biden just wants to get in Kamala‚Äôs pants
All black votes are going to Biden . He just won this election .
I love when people call Joe Biden "radical." It's like he's been slow-playing everyone for the past 42 years, just waiting for the right opportunity to unleash his true "radical" agenda.
And two of the people who think that are Joe Biden and Kamala Harris.
I completely agree, but it's not what shook out. It sucks, but Biden was the moderate choice, and he cleared the field. Should have been Warren, but here we are, and we just have to keep pushing for more great women.
Trump 2020! Or lose to the Democrats who allow our cities to be destroyed! Once the rioters are done there, they will come to our towns and homes!  Biden and Harris is a team who don‚Äôt respect each other! Wow what a sick team!
Joe Biden picked the worst possible vice president.
I wonder if Biden remembers Harris castrated him during the debates? Calling with examples a racist! Harris actually supported the sexual claims against Biden! She clearly doesn‚Äôt respect or even like him!
creates truth based on what he fears - Biden and Harris knew this would happen, by tomorrow he will pissed off about seeing halal carts on the streets of NYC
No, we weren't. He still very much had a path to victory then, in spite of the constant msm lies claiming he didn't. Neither he nor Biden were anywhere near the required 1991 delegates.
Well, really surprised she walked all over him at the debates, called him a racist and really brought some of the things he said and did against Blacks! Surprised she is a tough woman who also supported the women who claimed Biden of sexual misconduct! Not a good choice!
There's a famous electronics store near Madison Square Garden called B&amp;H Photo &amp; Video. The slogan is "Ya go to B&amp;H!"  We go to B&amp;H. Biden &amp; Harris.
How much you wanna bet the blame will shift to Biden instead of the Dem run cities when he's president.
this white woman has the back of  too. Can‚Äôt wait, just can‚Äôt wait for this team to bring it home in November. Team Biden/Harris all the way
Will Vote 4 U, But Biden, um NO.
How predictable you are, Sean. Harris is not an extreme socialist. And, she told Biden he's not a racist. Byrd has said joining the clan was a huge mistake. Count the women who have accused Trump of much worse than Biden. Keep trying. #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica
But Tulsi is half Samoan and a Hindu, so Biden could have said "she's still a woman of color." But we all know it was the Obama faction that picked Harris, not Biden himself. Harris brings nothing to the table.
congratulations to  great choice  you‚Äôll both be great for America. Biden/Harris 2020 all the way. You‚Äôve got this Senator, &amp; we‚Äôve got you! 1st female VP, 1st women of color as VP Now, LETS TAKE IT TO THE FINISH LINE!

Joe Biden chose Kamala Harris.  Mike Pence just called dibs on Donald Trump's bunker.
Joe Lieberman. John Edwards. Tim Kaine. Let their opponents off easy.  Joe Biden did not. He knows what it takes.  He chose Kamala Harris.
Damn I have to vote for Biden AND Kamala? üòñ
She never did.  Biden has no credible accusers. Trump has about 50 of them.  None of Kavanaugh's accusers were debunked.  Obviously, Smollett wasn't lynched, because he's still alive. George Floyd is not.
Is Joe Biden still a Racists? Do you still believe all the women who have accused him?
I haven‚Äôt actually. Feel free to send the link.  It makes sense bc everything feels like it‚Äôs working against Trump at the moment, my issue is this should have been a slam dunk for the DNC if they simply picked the candidate that the public wanted.  Biden/Harris were neither.
This CBS tweet could easily be from the Biden campaign.
As if there was any doubt who I was voting for...This just cements my decision!
Biden picking Kamala over Stacey is probably the equivalent of drafting Josh Doctson over Michael Thomas.
Sad though it is, the Biden camp has hit Trump hardest not with the pick, but by announcing it now and scuppering coverage of his 'briefing'...
He actually made a good point on Biden delaying his VP pick, thereby elevating a number of women within the party! Chuck's not THAT bad! üòèüôÑ

If you live in a state that isn‚Äôt likely to be an easy Biden win, you should consider voting in person, early if possible, if you feel you can do so safely. If you need to vote by mail, apply ASAP, and return your ballot in person if you can, mail it ASAP if you must mail it.
My democratic black family are not happy about Joe Biden &amp; Harris, the only ones I see celebrating are white liberals.  The same ones who were screaming BLM a few weeks back.  These people don't care about black lives.  I love seeing others see things for what they are.
So your argument is "He is the President of the United States - why would we expect him to know about the 14th Amendment or even his own administration's legal position on this issue?" Biden or Harris could answer the question. Or Rubio or Haley - both children of non-citizens.

If Joe Biden's health continues to get worse I believe that Kamala will be sworn in as president. It may not be in the first 100 day's or the first week. It will be on the first day. That's if Joe and Kamala were to win this election.

Am I the only one who is the least bit excited about Kamala Harris?  Her resume is tainted.  Biden obviously picked her cuz of the diversity factor to bring in the votes.  It's either Biden/Harris or Trump/Pence.  People would vote for Tom &amp; Jerry as long as it's against Trump.
Assuming capital gains rates in ten years is egregious right now. Trump wants to elongate them and Biden wants to triple them. Huge potential dispersion of outcomes.

She need to worry about Trump mental decline he's in worst shape than Biden .
fuck biden fuck trump we've been given the illusion of choice but the reality is the system is fucked
Joe Biden used to believe Mrs Hillary Clinton should've been the President of the United States of America not Mr Donald Tump. But that was before he nominated Sen. Kamala Harris as his running mate for VP, somebody who makes all of us look younger.üåü
get real Joe Biden looks Alzheimer's on steroids.  I am a Democrat and afraid to vote. I haven't seen such crap in the Democratic party. I am sixty six years old. I am so disappointed in propaganda this party is selling. I am ashamed of this
The same will happen, once or twice, in a Biden administration.  That's the result of having ambassadorial appointments go to donors.  Next term, I hope the appointees spend their own cash on residence upgrades and parties, the way they have always done...but not in this term.
$26 million.   (You can go ahead and delete any remaining hot takes about how the Biden digital team should be doing better.)
Is Kamala Harris perfect? Probably not.  Your tweet is critical enough to make me believe you would vote against her.    Fine. Do it.  You'll never find a job.  At least with Biden, you have a chance.
I think we the American people need someone strong and tuff to go against orange face Donald trump and kamala Harris is that woman along with Biden to take our country back üèÜüèÜüèÜüèÜhappy kamala wonüî•üî•

When Joe Biden and Kamala Harris win history will be very kind to them, bet you can't say that!Kamala is already making history  every minute.  And really Mt. Rushmore  dude!?

Like either way we‚Äôre going to get fucked but it can either be a rape (Trump) or we can sit down and come to an agreement that there needs to be some foreplay before we give consent (Biden/Harris)
True, Kamala doesn‚Äôt excite me and I was never a huge fan of her, but Pence?! ü§¢ that man openly hates the LGBTQ community and others. Biden all in all is a good man in my eyes, someone who strives to be better. Yes, he wants votes but I truly see that.
True but if you want me to be honest, I‚Äôd take Biden over Trump any day of any week of any year
I see a ton of black people talking about the past of Biden and Harris, and I understand the frustration and everything, but how about we press them about what they need to do to fill the void they helped create in the black community?
are we supposed to feel when our ‚Äúobvious‚Äù choices are the representation of the very thing we went to dismantle? So don‚Äôt get it twisted. Kamala is a cop. Biden is a cop. Dems are cops. Don‚Äôt pretend they aren‚Äôt just because your mind is made up.
And of course parents and families should continue to push Biden on what his ed agenda should be; that‚Äôs very different than attacking the ticket in ways that imply there isn‚Äôt a material differences between the Biden and Trump tickets and thus folks should stay home
The primaries are over. It‚Äôs now Biden or Trump. Time to pick a side. Picking a side doesn‚Äôt mean 100% agreement; it means that side best reflects one‚Äôs values. On 11/4, those opposed to Trump can resume various battles; but until then his defeat is the overriding priority
Fucking with Kamala and Biden in 2021 we all finna be fighting a cell mate for the top bunk.

Team Biden should demand more VP debates.
It‚Äôs been interesting to listen to different takes on the Biden-Harris ticket. It‚Äôs important to understand differing views. Even though I don‚Äôt agree w/ some, it doesn‚Äôt mean they‚Äôre wrong. Politics is not about all or nothing for me. 1/2
"if you talk bad about Kamala, it may dissuade people from voting for Biden and they'll instead vote for Trump"  .... no. y'all not about to do this again.

The meme format where one button is supporting biden+harris because i dont want trump to get a second term and the other button is retweeting anti-biden/harris propaganda because theyre both horrible and i cant decide which button to press
It is discrimination! Can you imagine if trump said it am looking for a male‚Äô? I am a woman, and I don‚Äôt like that Biden said he is limiting himself to a woman. And if democrats want to have the best chance of winning, they should look for the best candidate. She has a terrible

So you decided to support biden over his sexual assault accusers, when did you make that change? Or are you just playing politics, it is ok for a presidential nominee to sexual assault women if democrat?
Is it really necessary for y‚Äôall to get on the internet and talk about how ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt like Kamala, but...‚Äù It don‚Äôt matter! This woman is making history and we need to vote for her and Biden regardless!People post memes because they have no argument! You want to know how dumb people are?

He also reversed Biden‚Äôs crime bill that put more black people in jail for misdemeanors. And pardoned wrongfully convicted people. Which were from the black community. And under Trump the Black businesses start ups has increased 400%!
please hold Biden accountable and ask him why he plagiarizes every speech?
Speaking of peculiar arguments, this one would certainly qualify: "Your guy is more senile than my guy." Biden's mental decline is undeniable. You may have decided that it doesn't matter &amp; you're going to vote for him anyway, but denying reality makes you look pretty foolish.
Maybe Biden forgot he plagiarized? He is dementia.
If Biden- Harris win, they will reverse it and make Iran more powerful by renewing the nuclear deal. That‚Äôs a real threat to not only America but the world. They are a real threat and shouldn‚Äôt win.

Voting for Biden will bring this... This judge wants to destroy an 8-year old boy whose crazy mother wants him to be a girl. And they order the father to pay for it!
If Biden wins, China will enter the US market even more aggressively than before. It‚Äôs a real threat.
Why does Biden's chief opponent's top attack surrogate deserve a spot at all? Biden and his team giving this much airtime to Sanders' team is pretty magnanimous.

These people eat all kinds of bullshit. Trump has created such a strong economy. There is more money being injected into this country than ever before. If this pandemic happens during Obama/Biden we would be doomed. We barely made it through the Obama recessions.

I know they have a plan. And I do trust it my thing is I know that Biden is not really playing with a full deck because Trump is in charge of that situation. But it burns me up to hear people talk about Biden Biden Biden Biden
Every time anyone tweets about Biden, good or bad, we should all include "C'MON MAN" somewhere in our responses! #CmonMan
What‚Äôs bizarre is your way of thinking and you failures throughout the many years in politics. Trump came in no history of politics, decided to fight for this country instead of living his life comfortably beyond most can do. That‚Äôs a patriot! Unlike pay for prez Obama/Biden
I keep trying to get this across to my friends - they need Biden to lose. They need things to get much worse, because it's the only way they have a chance to win.   The Lincoln Project people are going to be more useful to winning this than the Berners.

My man just gobbling White dick and calling it empowerment üò™ which celebrity or talking head told you evicting Trump was Black people top priority like racism is all trump and his folks. Like Biden n Kamala aren‚Äôt as anti Black as him but in sheep clothes. Wake up
Unless Biden goes into complete basement mode and lets Harris be the surrogate, I don't think the focus on her lasts more than a couple of weeks. Chatter will still come up.  But do you think they'd just ignore Biden?  I support him, and recognize there is MATERIAL on him.
Good for you.
What was irresponsible was nominating Biden in the first place.
I can oppose Biden and not vote for Trump.
Fuck Biden, Fuck Trump, I‚Äôm voting for this guy üò≥üá©üá¥
But Biden knows UKRAINE CASH. He and Hunter know that to a tee.
Biden dosen‚Äôt know where his basement toilet is.
How do you feel about Biden's accuser? ##metoounlessitsbiden #MeToo

Afraid if Biden has to answer a question off the top of his head, he won‚Äôt know what‚Äôs going on without teleprompter or notes. They again, he could always tell us his CORNPOP story.
Biden's been itching to cut Social Security for decades. Social Security will be on the chopping block regardless of who wins in Nov.
would you please explore facilitating voting in #Ohio, #Pennsylvania, #Michigan, and #Wisconsin? CA is in the bag for #Biden/#Harris, unless an unforeseen disaster strikes.
Let's ask our liberal friends to answer:  Do you agree with Joe Biden's policy to restore Law and Order to America?
Wow this is actually the first time all year I‚Äôve been legit excited to vote for Biden!
That would be Biden and Hunter.
Are teachers relevant anymore? Biden will keep it shut for a while.
Harris / Biden would put it deep in their pockets looking for more.
Wow, that's a lot of work to do for the average Biden supporter üòâ
Was never my first choice either but I will crawl through smoldering wreckage to vote for Biden if I have to. Framing it in these terms is basically whining about having to make difficult choices in order to save democracy in this country.
Thats the thing the Biden ticket is offering the same old okey doke, zero solutions.

Serious question: is there an actual political strategy here, or are you just being an idiot. You are aware Biden won‚Äôt be spending a dime in New York no matter what you tweet, right.
I think his chances of 2024 are done if Biden wins which I fully expect.  I highly doubt Kamala would step aside. Maybe a shot at VP though.
So I guess Biden fits your standard of what a Catholic is then..
I suspect Amy K will be getting her reward soon.  After Clyburn, she did more to boost Biden's campaign than anyone. Both with the endorsement and gracefully bowing out of VP.  What Biden does for her is more important than Harris's graciousness.
wrong. his voters are accultured now to not wearing masks or believing in the dangers of covid...they will go to their local polling place and vote for him happily, even rationalizing that if they do die, it'll be for their country. biden voters are more cautious, so we're fucked

The literally whole 2020 election game plan has been to fear monger Trump. Especially where Black people are concerns. A Blue State could have a racial situation they refuse to address and it‚Äôs ‚ÄúLook how‚Äôs Trump doing us going vote Biden to stop this‚Äù
Biden's son had just died, Clinton had very recently been extremely popular, had great relationships with vital Dem constituencies, and oh yeah, won the fuckin' popular vote. Baring Comey and Wikileaks, she walks to the presidency. Because she lost doesn't make it a bad choice.
You have entirely too much faith that America the organization will stop going to war and that Biden once elected will appoint good judges that will be helpful to black society. Dems want to abolish BM and we still got to vote on those other issue, nice try tho
With Trump in office Black people‚Äôs eyes are open to the racism with Kamala and Biden many of us will be sheep. Who ever wins the plans are roughly the same only with Democrats in a opposition positions they will be more willing to come to the table with tangible next cycle.
You can‚Äôt saying your not trying to let things get worst as you are campaigning for the worst option. Biden/Kamala can get more done in the form of oppressing Black society because they are positions as our ‚Äúteammates‚Äù. All eyes are on Trump so it‚Äôs easier to counter his racism.
How is Biden a centrist. I love how you act like he isn‚Äôt a proven racist who if given the presidency would quadruple the amount of Black people in prison. Motherfucker already promised to increase their budget not defund or demilitarize.
How are they far worst? Can you point to any Trump policy that‚Äôs been as destructive to Black society as the Biden‚Äôs Law? You do know Kamala Harris refused to prosecute cops? Please explain how Biden/Kamala r the lesser of two evils to Black society? With words not talking points
I have a Republican browbeating me in another thread to vote for Biden. He actually accused ME of being a fascist sympathizer.
This the type shit Biden and company gonna be on.. I don‚Äôt wanna go to jail y‚Äôall
Over 170,000 dead.  Over 5 million cases of Covid. Financial crisis of epic proportion. Rights being infringed upon. There IS no choice.  You don't have to like Biden, he is not your friend.  You just have to vote for him.  trump must go.
Biden is barely center left, you dipshits
Well that's the thing, Biden wants your vote more than he wants mine. Best of luck in Nov.
My democratic black family are not happy about Joe Biden &amp; Harris, the only ones I see celebrating are white liberals.  The same ones who were screaming BLM a few weeks back.  These people don't care about black lives.  I love seeing others see things for what they are.
Biden &amp; Harris perfect combination to destroy that orange devil!! #2020
Everyone must want trump to win again, because if y‚Äôall keep bashing kamala or Biden, y‚Äôall got no choice but to let trump win again.

Thanks for the reply. I should probably disclose I'm kind of subtweeting a group of people, and not you. I'm so irritated w/ those who keep insisting Biden will prosecute Trump when he literally keeps telling us he won't. Fantasy and projection are not helpful in any way.
ü§£no, they are laughing at you not Biden.
If Biden wins, it'll be the Cop/Mayo Pete in 2024 because Biden won't make it through to the end of the term.
Listen I'm on board with Mr Biden and Ms Harris but being an extreme progressive I don't expect too much. Just rid us of this disease that is currently oozing from the white house, attorney general office and sec of state. Cause if Trump   steals the election USA won't recover
Hoping AG Barr announces the arrest of Biden today. Cleveland and Miami raid. Where‚Äôs Hunter???

No thank you. I would rather not have a private company with access to my votes. Who do you think the CEO‚Äôs support? Ever had a ‚Äúlost package‚Äù? I think there will be a lot of lost Biden votes, should have got the insurance.

This is as funny as kamala calling biden a rapist and a racist and being his VP lol
That's bad but biden saying black people ain't diverse is OK..lmaooo can't make this shit up
Joe Biden literally quit a previous Presidential run because of his lies, and yet he ran for both VP and President again.
All of you all are ridiculous if you think for a second she or Biden are comparative to trump. He can‚Äôt even name 10 presidents. He doesn‚Äôt know when world war 2 ended. He tear gased American citizens. He condones racism and bigotry... and still somehow you all compare them smh
And there‚Äôs also so many ways to educate this kid in a way that‚Äôs more productive like ‚Äúwell I respect your opinion but Biden has been gross towards women and Kamala is responsible for xyz!‚Äù

You are so right about Biden's ideology. I suspect what's happening is the Dem establishment and Never Trump Republicans are consolidating power not to stop the fascism, but rather to crush the left.

Two reasons we have President Trump and VP Pence are the Clinton/Kaine ticket didn't pass some purity tests, and it wasn't inspirational enough. Please remember what's at stake this year, and vote for the better option of Biden and Harris.
This is part of the reason a 71/29 Biden poll is so meaningless when the White House will do everything in its power to keep democrats from voting.
Kamala Harris Lies Repeatedly in First Speech as Biden‚Äôs Running Mate
Expansion? You mean the worst economy since the great depression created by Obama and Biden tax and spend and democrat failed housing initiatives.
The real question is - when will  be endorsing Biden/Kamala? Now that the VP has been picked, no need to wait any longer.
I think...I THINK this is her saying not to send in your mail-in ballot for Joe Biden because you might end up with the black lady.   That's what I think she was probably going for.   I say this without looking at a clip because why would I do that to myself?  #BidenHarris
in all seriousness: those who are voting need to show up bc they‚Äôre already showing signs of trying to cheat this election. it‚Äôs not in the bad just bc Biden is popular, that‚Äôs the same mistake Hillary made.

Am I the only one who is the least bit excited about Kamala Harris?  Her resume is tainted.  Biden obviously picked her cuz of the diversity factor to bring in the votes.  It's either Biden/Harris or Trump/Pence.  People would vote for Tom &amp; Jerry as long as it's against Trump.
Did you hear that from Joe Biden?
I Kamala and Biden get elected that‚Äôs the path we‚Äôll be going on, Medicaid for all.   But until we root out the corruption among doctors e.g. working with insurance companies that deliberately obfuscate prices from consumers we won‚Äôt have a clean medical industry here either.

‚Ä¶and it's Biden by a nose!
Yes, of course, you're right.  Then you should consider yourself lucky, at least he's not charging you to play, unlike Obama/Biden.
Can you be any more biased? Running interference for Biden. I think it's you guys who should have your 1st amendment rights looked at, you no longer are the arbiter of truth.  Far from it actually, you act more like the propaganda wing of the DNC, Goebbels would be proud.
It is changing because she only moves 1% of the black vote so her being ‚Äúblack‚Äù doesn‚Äôt do anything since Biden has the black boomer vote on lock already and young black people are informed and won‚Äôt vote for her so she can‚Äôt help get votes there. MSM pivoted to Asian üôÑ
I think it makes them both racist. They both support the same racist agenda. No? Just bcz she is a POC doesn't make her exempt from racism. Biden found the perfect running mate...someone who locked up more blacks than he did.
Also, again, don't consider Biden a sure thing. Trump can and will still win especially if people don't vote or vote for a third party.

Plenty of opportunity for Biden to say/do something dumb between now and November   Trump could also figure out that pushing for a massive stimulus bill is likely to boost his popularity (it seems he hasn't figured it out yet)
Not saying he should be at the convention at ALL, but if Kasich can sway any Republicans who are still sane and now on the fence with Trump to vote for Biden, then yeah. Let him at least talk on the cable shows.
You are legitimately trying to say that Biden wasn't involved in that. Which there are various flight logs for biden unlike for trump. He literally started getting hated 24 hours after he announced his candidacy into the white house.
fuck biden fuck trump we've been given the illusion of choice but the reality is the system is fucked
So does biden? Also where are the flight logs? And you do realize that he is the most hated person in this country so it wouldn't be surprising if at least 2 of those people tried to fake it

OPINION: When Trump inevitably insults Kamala Harris with misogynistic and racist stereotypes, she and Joe Biden should respond with positivity. His hatred will alienate voters and help the Democrats win in 2020.
Biden vs Trump.
biden voters think that america was bad for 4 years tops
Amazing. This Murray guy apparently has no job but to jump on Trumps tweets the moment he tweets. No buddy NYC will NOT vote for communist/fascist dictators like Biden and Harris. I live here. I know. Me and everyone I know in NYC are saying NO to that scum.
Why was the DNC trying to stop him to begin with? His policies were good for the American people and they‚Äôre now peddling watered down versions of of his policies to get us to vote for Biden. For what?

Arguing with Bernie-or-Busters isn't to beat Trump. The left will not cost Biden the election. It's to make the left a part of a voter bloc that SOMEONE wants to win over in 2024, rather than make them the same fucking afterthought they were before 2016.
It really does suck, I agree. But things can actually improve. There are several progressive candidates winning Congress and they'll probably push the administration toward the left, in case Biden wins and the election is not stolen.
No, I have some data. More Biden voters intend to v-b-m vs. Trump voters, who disproportionately favor in-person voting. This partisan division has opened up b/c of Trump's statements re v-b-m. 1/
You have to be such an Idiot. What, when, and where had Biden done anything? Can you mention something that Sleepy Joe had done, other than sell the country to China along with Hunter....
I really wish Biden was who you claim he was, because then we'd actually be able to lock you up after he wins. Fortunately for you, he's not who you claim.

Going to be amazing when they have to work with Biden
Sad to say, but it's all too predictable that Biden will say something like, "Our country needs to heal, we aren't going to look backward, we're going to move forward", and not hold Trump accountable. Same as Obama did not hold Bush accountable.

Funny how suggesting both candidates meet a neutral Black leader is some how sabotaging Biden campaign. Why is it that his campaign is so dependent on Black people getting the shaft n not complaining about it? Seems like they want to continue business like usual not change things
Sure, Trump has deep respect for the law, so much so that he sees himself &amp; his buddies as completely above it!  The reality is that NYC will vote for Biden in large numbers &amp; this endorsement will have zero impact on the overall electoral result.   #BidenHarris2020

Understood, so Dems need to vote by mail as early as possible, ideally before Oct 3rd. And making a digital record of your signed ballotwith your face is very important. The DNC can then set up a blockchain to record all data and have a record in each State of total Biden  votes

As this political circus is rolling out I see Dems as true task masters.Even as much as Biden telling black ppl,‚Äùyou ain‚Äôt black if ur not Dem‚Äù.That was NOT a gaffe,he truly believes it.They R control freaks,even highjacked the BLM.Wants to control mask wearing,THINK about it.
I have no problem saying that what Bernie is doing NOW, is evil. What I don't know is was he or his family threatened gbecause he, unlike Michelle, has a long documented record of fighting against everything Biden and Harris stand for.
Pelosi should join Biden in his basement.
cause most of us would see through this BS going on  they want votes but offer nothing to get us to vote  you can not run on trump bad  they need to offer some change  biden said nothing will change

So? I was saying it's a shame Biden doesn't support any universal plan. That wasn't a call out, it's just a fact.
If Trump had his henchmen traveling around the country chopping off Biden supporters' fingers so they couldn't vote, the Democrats would call for hearings into the practice to be held two months from now. Republicans would laugh and not show up.

His hatred will alienate voters and help the Democrats win in 2020.
Amazing. This Murray guy apparently has no job but to jump on Trumps tweets the moment he tweets. No buddy NYC will NOT vote for communist/fascist dictators like Biden and Harris. I live here. I know. Me and everyone I know in NYC are saying NO to that scum.

Arguing with Bernie-or-Busters isn't to beat Trump. The left will not cost Biden the election. It's to make the left a part of a voter bloc that SOMEONE wants to win over in 2024, rather than make them the same fucking afterthought they were before 2016.
It really does suck, I agree. But things can actually improve. There are several progressive candidates winning Congress and they'll probably push the administration toward the left, in case Biden wins and the election is not stolen.
No, I have some data. More Biden voters intend to v-b-m vs. Trump voters, who disproportionately favor in-person voting. This partisan division has opened up b/c of Trump's statements re v-b-m. 1/

Sad to say, but it's all too predictable that Biden will say something like, "Our country needs to heal, we aren't going to look backward, we're going to move forward", and not hold Trump accountable. Same as Obama did not hold Bush accountable.

Funny how suggesting both candidates meet a neutral Black leader is some how sabotaging Biden campaign. Why is it that his campaign is so dependent on Black people getting the shaft n not complaining about it? Seems like they want to continue business like usual not change things
Sure, Trump has deep respect for the law, so much so that he sees himself &amp; his buddies as completely above it!  The reality is that NYC will vote for Biden in large numbers &amp; this endorsement will have zero impact on the overall electoral result.   #BidenHarris2020

Rape is sexual abuse yes they're in the same category but there is a difference between forcing yourself on a child and having non consensual sex and the (still disgusting things) Biden did on TV.
Priceless. Biden will ask him the same question at the debates.
Rape has a set of rules that make it rape i am not defending biden I think everything he does on camera is absolutely wrong but it 100 percent is not rape and labeling that takes away from actual instances of rape from people in power.

Kelly was horrible when asked tough question like why trump say open schools when stats are terrible and she denies and then goes into anti Biden Harris ramble she shouldn‚Äôt be invited back
It‚Äôs also going to backfire since Trump can‚Äôt stay away during a speech and Biden gives a great delivery as today proved.

Listening to Biden‚Äôs speech. He is so much more together than tired Donald Dildo McFuckFace that the strategy of saying he is too old is going to backfire spectacularly. I predict a big bounce coming soon...
On the day that Kamala Harris was introduced as Biden's running mate, Trump looks and sounds pathetic.
I don‚Äôt believe Biden is going to look out for the many. I believe a lot of what he says is lip service. I do think though that Harris has a lot of good going for her &amp; can evolve past some things a lot of people don‚Äôt like. I think she can do some good if she‚Äôs willing to change
Ya know what‚Äôs kind of ironic? Trump and his friends at Fox use the same attacks so often, that their predictability has taken any sting out their messaging. I feel like everyone is so over their repetitive negativity that it‚Äôs making Biden/Harris feel even fresher.
I had hope for the first time in 4 years for our country listening to Joe Biden and Kamala Harris.  #BidenHarris2020
We may have our disagreements, but 1 thing we can agree on..Vote Biden!
So first thing on the Biden/Harris agenda is get rid of Freedom of Speech
Two sincere, simpatico, seasoned, singular, leaders joined to offer American people, badly hurting, that there is another way. A team emerged with purpose not to destroy but to build back better. This dual introduction went a long way to  give credence to the Biden Harris credo.

Get real.  Biden didn't want her. She was forced on him by his handlers.
The Biden/Harris speeches we‚Äôre amazing. It feels almost surreal to hear such polished and thoughtful statements, and such a relief to hear Kamala hold Trump accountable on a national stage. So much hope right now.
Listening to Biden and Harris speak just reminded me just how much of politics and media is propaganda and psychological manipulation and that the democrats and republicans are two sides of the same corrupt coin, send tweet
Unless I missed something from Judge Janine and Geraldo, is FOX News planning to harm Joe Biden before the election?
I‚Äôm enjoying Democrats telling me how great Biden is and most of all how special a choice Harris is. Did i miss Dems primary? - by the way this Republican likes them.
Watching #Biden &amp; #Harris today brought up a feeling I hadn‚Äôt experienced in quite some time. I took a while for me to identify. I was afraid to give it a name, because that would leave me vulnerable. Ultimately I could not deny it &amp; called it what it is. #hope #BidenHarris2020

Lol no. I don't get it with Cuomo. He hasn't even done a good job! If Biden wins, Harris will be the frontrunner vs. probably a younger progressive like Katie Porter. I don't see AOC ever running for bigger office.
Joe Biden has no authority.
After 47 years in government how‚Äôs 78 yo Biden ‚Äúall of a sudden ‚Äú going to fix everything. If he knew what the problem was why didn‚Äôt he do something before now???
As much as I hate settling for Biden, I can‚Äôt stand more Trump, and a vote for biden can potentially be the bridge to more progressive candidates if he fucks up
Because the DNC will only pander to people who they know will vote. If progressives in large don‚Äôt show up, the DNC will stop wasting money trying to get us to vote. We just need to put a lot of pressure on Biden
i never said not to vote biden harris, just that harris is a shitty choice
That will be the end of our country if Biden gets elected

It's also fundamentally different than the others. I think people have bracketology brain when they look at it. If the election was today it's probably 95% for Biden. He's just modeling three months out for various potential changes. I don't see that number as a negative.
I am enjoying the meltdown though. I mean, I get it. I will never truly take a deep breath until he is physically out of the building. But I think it's hilarious that we're panicking over a model that says Biden is winning 7/10 times.

While yes, Biden was far from the best choice, if he gets blown tf out and that doesn‚Äôt spark a revolution then the DNC will believe all the pandering he has done to progressives was a waste
I only believe in settle for biden because if we prove to be a group that doesn‚Äôt vote the DNC won‚Äôt care why and just pander to those who do vote, furthering the country more right
Don't they mean from the list of black females? Biden severely limited his options when he committed to having a black female. Is there someone from that limited group who would better help the ticket?
Biden boxed himself in when he declared he would limit his choice to black females. My comments are relevant only within that limited framework. BTW in business that sort of comment about race / ethnicity would get you sued.

Okay i was just asking. Personally I think Kamla Harris should have been the Democratic nomination and i mean that sincerely. I fully understand ut hated for Trump just dont think Biden is mentally capable. Harris is a great choice she was a good DA and was not soft on crime
So you were not going go vote Biden otherwise? What does that say about Biden? Because that's kind of what ur saying
Yes there are. Do not forget the Indians, we can get Biden over the finish line.

For the love of the god Joe Biden is going to destroy, please shut him down for the year. He's too valuable over the next six years. Stop pretending this season matters! #Nats
I think that‚Äôs fear mongering to some degree. Even if Biden just lasts 2 years, I think people are more excited to get rid of a senile, corrupt Donny than a far left Dem party taking over. If that happens they will be punished in 2022 and 2024. We will see
Also I agree Biden himself won‚Äôt move the Dems any further left. But their voters and party members will require that. It‚Äôs arguably necessary after the last 4 horrible years. But they‚Äôll have hell to pay if they go to far left &amp; will lose in the 2022 midterms or 2024 general
Blaming the suburbs for Trump is just weird? They‚Äôve always been GOP leaning. 2nd Biden is beating him in the suburbs based on polls for 2020 so if Biden wins that‚Äôll be part of the reason. Also both parties have shifted far from the center due to polarization. They both suck.
I have seen one Biden sign in someone‚Äôs yard. One.
for a different party back then- low taxes/more libertarian/genuinely cared to be decent and polite. Trumps generally awful behavior is why the suburbs hate him so much.   Dems have a unique challenge keeping those voters into the 2020s if Biden wins- esp with the leftward lurch

Typical press response.  Apologize for Biden but accuse Trump.  As far as Fox News people go, Chris Wallace is almost as bad as Juan Williams.
And Biden is a better option???
Instead, go with this: "...whose actions are completely at odds with the values and teachings of *my faith.*" It transitions into the following paragraph where Biden contrasts his faith and values from Trump's actions without the implication that Trump is "faking" it.
THE GOAL IS TO DEFEAT BIDEN!!!

Just know that thousands of churches in this country will curse Joe Biden, a devout Catholic, because an atheist real estate mogul from Queens told them Biden will destroy God. That WILL happen. That's where we're at.

said that 50k lives would have been saved if  acted 2 weeks sooner...then when?? If he did what?? Biden called #Trump xenophobic and racist for shutting down travel when he did. So what would Biden and Harris have done. EXPLAIN what Trump did wrong.
Under Biden &amp; YOU they have to LIVE long enough to get it!! You guys have chaos &amp; DEATH üíÄ running WILD!!
This is why voting out Trump isn‚Äôt enough. We also have to pressure Biden/Harris, the House and Senate Dems to push for dismantling the systemic racism.
No, Biden selected Kamala Harris to be his running mate, and together, they will leave Donald Trump's future as flat as a pancake.
Most important thing to me is Biden over 50%. Clinton never had polling over 50%. She may have been ahead, but there was a huge undecided margin plus Gary Johnson.
But Biden can win one electoral vote in Nebraska.  Trump cannot win any NY EC votes
He also reversed Biden‚Äôs crime bill that put more black people in jail for misdemeanors. And pardoned wrongfully convicted people. Which were from the black community. And under Trump the Black businesses start ups has increased 400%!
Speaking of peculiar arguments, this one would certainly qualify: "Your guy is more senile than my guy." Biden's mental decline is undeniable. You may have decided that it doesn't matter &amp; you're going to vote for him anyway, but denying reality makes you look pretty foolish.

I blame 8 years of unpreparedness by Obama/Biden Administration
Maybe. But, the Trumps made their money well before Donald became POTUS. And if they did profit, it pales in comparison to the Biden crime family's profits.
A while back she said she was voting for Biden because she thinks he'll be a weaker enemy.
Whichever I choose, I‚Äôm not walking with Biden. He is one of the shit piles.
did not threaten Joe Biden. She said what everyone is thinking. His dementia is worsening and he isn‚Äôt the official nominee yet. Dems can pull the rug out from under him at any time. That‚Äôs why the Republicans haven‚Äôt really started their ads against him.#ridiculous
If Biden wins, get ready for Trump to punish America
Fox News staff made a threat against Biden .
Biden crossed that line for me by refusing to support Medicare for All.
They should quote me too. Consider Biden the Titanic and us the iceberg.
I've been pushing back since the travesty of April 7. We're going to sink Biden.
You (Biden &amp; supporters) aren't supporting me or the 70% of Americans who want Medicare for All, so don't expect us to support you. It's the neoliberals whose ideas are trash.
Biden is not a win, principled or otherwise.
No, it's not Biden or Trump, and you cannot make me choose either of those two pieces of shit. I'm choosing and getting Hawkins.
I 100% agree, I was just quoting joe Biden.
A lot!   Another catastrophic banana Republicans economic failure!  What the Biden Harris Ticket Could Mean for the Economy
What gaffe did Biden do this week?
Trump attacks Harris as ‚Äòangry‚Äô and mean to Biden...meanwhile our kids can't go back to school because of the  Trump administration's mismanagement of the #COVID19 pandemic here in the USA.
We‚Äôre taking Biden down.
That‚Äôs exactly how progressives think of Biden.
We have a better understanding of politics than that loser Biden has. 70% of Americans want Medicare for All, so why won‚Äôt he support it.
That is Fake, David Duke and The KKK have endorsed Biden.

Biden/Harris is "Hope reborn." Now, we all need to go make history!

We/US don't need stupid senators or representatives to bring crimially guilty parties to justice. That is what the DOJ, FBI and police/DA departments are for.  If gop are guilty, let their heads roll with the prior obama, biden and clinton administration people...
I like how Biden‚Äôs pick for VP is so important to people, Joe Biden said it‚Äôs easy being Vice President b/c you don‚Äôt have to do anything and agrees it‚Äôs like being the grandparent instead of the parent
Not really, Biden knows what year it is.
You can find the statements by all Democrats including Biden, Bernie, Kamla and all in public where they are slamming India and supporting Pakistan.  If you were paid by Democrats for this article, then it is a professional duty you did... But Democrats are Anti-India.

How many steps are in between joe biden and a walk on water candidate?
I'm sure the billionaire that openly bragged about groping women is the one they'll feel safe with.   That's not to say Biden gets a pass but it's just another reason why it should've been Bernie running.   Also the dog whistling has turned into a nuclear alert siren.
Joe Biden did not write that tweet. Poor Joe doesn‚Äôt even know he‚Äôs alive.

Maya Rudolph and Jason Sudeikis are gonna have field days on SNL if Biden/Harris wins

The third part is the most important. So many lapsed into inactivity from 2009-2011 and 2013-2015. Hold Biden/Harris accountable without being disrespectful. Let the GOP be the racist assholes
I wish Bob Barker was alive to play Joe Biden on SNL...
No. Biden/Harris being incredibly shitty candidates that will not change anything is what will help trump win
It‚Äôs a good day to block Biden/Harris apologists

Sorry, don‚Äôt want a Biden administration. Medicare for All or no vote!

This was posted well before Biden announced his pick. I am not disappointed at all.
Most important thing is getting Trump out. I‚Äôll deal with Biden and Harris once they‚Äôre in office
To all Dems complaining about the Kamala pick. First, I disagree and I‚Äôm happy with it. But also WHO CARES? I‚Äôd vote for Biden-Fork 2020, Biden-Owl 2020, Biden-Chair 2020. Esp. if you have a big platform, your tweets could discourage someone from voting. THIS IS NOT THE YEAR.

You can't be this Stupid, Right??? Mail Trucks are Being Replaced with Brand New Ones Thanks To Trump, after Biden gave them No Money for his 8 years as VP.
Biden won‚Äôt have a cabinet overtly trying to dismantle the post office, dept of education, environmental regulations.  But will continue to serve Wall Street, health insurance industry, the fossil fuel industry etc
You Just Described Joe Biden, not Donald Trump.
In picking Harris, Biden makes history and plays it safe...strike that....plays it smart and boldly so.
Agreed, but if Trump and Biden were to ever get on stage together that‚Äôs basically murder. üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏ #Trump2020
If the commie hill is the one conservatives want to die on with Biden/Kamala then go right ahead.
THIS DECISION AINT EASY MY NIGGA!!!!! ITS EITHER BIDEN AND KAMALA OR TRUMP AND PENCE WE FUCKED EITHER WAY
I‚Äôm not trying to start an argument, probably more a discussion, but who would‚Äôve been your choice as Biden‚Äôs VP? I think Harris makes an interesting choice because her tough nature would appeal to people want a law and order administration. Biden is a transitional president.
I‚Äôll deal with Biden and Harris once they‚Äôre in office with my own criticisms, but for now, we gotta get Trump out
Imagine being a part of the campaign that failed so miserably and gave us Trump and then having the nerve to call a rightfully frustrated citizen a douchebag. I‚Äôm voting for Biden and I hope all of my fellow progressives too but you people are so arrogant and irritating.
If Biden wins this November, the meltdown will be much worse
Biden just wants to get in Kamala‚Äôs pants
All black votes are going to Biden . He just won this election .
And two of the people who think that are Joe Biden and Kamala Harris.
I completely agree, but it's not what shook out. It sucks, but Biden was the moderate choice, and he cleared the field. Should have been Warren, but here we are, and we just have to keep pushing for more great women.
And yet you still can‚Äôt come up with anything Biden has done for blacks.
So besides a crime bill that Biden signed in 94 to put more blacks in jail for misdemeanors, what did he do?
Joe Biden picked the worst possible vice president.
creates truth based on what he fears - Biden and Harris knew this would happen, by tomorrow he will pissed off about seeing halal carts on the streets of NYC
No, we weren't. He still very much had a path to victory then, in spite of the constant msm lies claiming he didn't. Neither he nor Biden were anywhere near the required 1991 delegates.
There's a famous electronics store near Madison Square Garden called B&amp;H Photo &amp; Video. The slogan is "Ya go to B&amp;H!"  We go to B&amp;H. Biden &amp; Harris.
How much you wanna bet the blame will shift to Biden instead of the Dem run cities when he's president.
this white woman has the back of  too. Can‚Äôt wait, just can‚Äôt wait for this team to bring it home in November. Team Biden/Harris all the way
Will Vote 4 U, But Biden, um NO.
I‚Äôm not sure your info is correct, with Biden‚Äôs 94 crime bill it would be close!
congratulations to  great choice  you‚Äôll both be great for America. Biden/Harris 2020 all the way. You‚Äôve got this Senator, &amp; we‚Äôve got you! 1st female VP, 1st women of color as VP Now, LETS TAKE IT TO THE FINISH LINE!
Congratulations Senator! Biden/Harris 2020 all the way! You got this, we‚Äôve got you!
Girl.....liberalism is ‚Äúmore‚Äù progressive when pinned against conservativism but not in the grand scheme of things.....you can support Biden while being critical of the system he upholds
New story on NPR: Rep. Jim Clyburn Comments On Biden's Decision To Pick Harris As His Running Mate
Perception is everything. I'm sure Kamala will wipe the stage with Pence, but we really needed her to tackle Trump. My confidence is lacking that Biden can take on Trump in a debate.
Can we have Kamala be the DH for Biden too?
I was never unenthusiastic about Biden. Don't know where you got that from.
I'm only voting for Biden to get rid of Trump. Easier to deal with Biden/Harris since they'll at least be pressured to act from progressive activists. Trump/Pence is more of the same fascist shit

Purely wishful thinking. I don‚Äôt see a lot of enthusiasm for Biden but my contact with the rest of the world has been limited lately.
If you live in a state that isn‚Äôt likely to be an easy Biden win, you should consider voting in person, early if possible, if you feel you can do so safely. If you need to vote by mail, apply ASAP, and return your ballot in person if you can, mail it ASAP if you must mail it.

My democratic black family are not happy about Joe Biden &amp; Harris, the only ones I see celebrating are white liberals.  The same ones who were screaming BLM a few weeks back.  These people don't care about black lives.  I love seeing others see things for what they are.
So your argument is "He is the President of the United States - why would we expect him to know about the 14th Amendment or even his own administration's legal position on this issue?" Biden or Harris could answer the question. Or Rubio or Haley - both children of non-citizens.

Thanks for the reply. I should probably disclose I'm kind of subtweeting a group of people, and not you. I'm so irritated w/ those who keep insisting Biden will prosecute Trump when he literally keeps telling us he won't. Fantasy and projection are not helpful in any way.
Ukraine was manufactured and it failed. In fact it suggests Biden‚Äôs family used Air Force 2 to conduct personal business with China/Ukraine. Russia highlighted Clinton‚Äôs paid for fake intel anti get warrant from Obama‚Äôs justice dept to spy on trump team. Smart people realize this

I dont have an agenda I just think there is a difference between rape and what biden did which is still disgusting they have very distinct definitions and misusing it weakens how bad each actually is.
The head of your party, Trojan Joe Biden, publicly declared blacks are incapable of thinking for themselves which makes them slightly worse than latinos. Looks like the Democrats are going to have to own that, don‚Äôt it?
Rape is sexual abuse yes they're in the same category but there is a difference between forcing yourself on a child and having non consensual sex and the (still disgusting things) Biden did on TV.
Question I haven‚Äôt been following too closely so maybe you already answered this but do you still think Biden is a sexual abuser? Do you still think he is a racist?  Why did you withhold information that would have freed and innocent person. FINALLY WHAT ARE YOUR PRONOUNS

It's a binary choice, you either vote for Biden or Trump, it's that simple!

Didn't you mean to say Harris/Biden? He's nothing but a puppet and the Democrats, Soros, etc. are pulling his strings. The country is almost unrecognizable now, if they win it's all over.

I don't think it will get much worse than now. What the hell do we have to lose with Biden!

Yeah, the leftist governors shut thier states down. The ones with the highest numbers of deaths. Ass backwards shutdowns they are using to discredit the president. Smart ppl see this. Biden loses bigly on 2020

Joe Biden picks LGBTQ ally Kamala Harris for Vice President  via  #vote
Am I the only one who is the least bit excited about Kamala Harris?  Her resume is tainted.  Biden obviously picked her cuz of the diversity factor to bring in the votes.  It's either Biden/Harris or Trump/Pence.  People would vote for Tom &amp; Jerry as long as it's against Trump.
This has to happen in November. #BidenHarris
Assuming capital gains rates in ten years is egregious right now. Trump wants to elongate them and Biden wants to triple them. Huge potential dispersion of outcomes.
I swear if I was running Joe Biden‚Äôs campaign I would point out how many tweets you‚Äôve sent about TV ratings in the middle of the pandemic and recession.  Why you think anyone cares about ratings during this time is beyond me.
You're either unredeemably cynical or you've seriously drunk the #Republican Kool Aid. Biden/Harris is a fine, stable ticket for.our country after the wack-job theft-ring  that has been the Trump administration.

Can you be any more biased? Running interference for Biden. I think it's you guys who should have your 1st amendment rights looked at, you no longer are the arbiter of truth.  Far from it actually, you act more like the propaganda wing of the DNC, Goebbels would be proud.
Good enough for me! I don't want to hear about Medicare for all nor stupid green deal. I wonder if the squad truly knows how much Obama/Biden did for the environment? Trump rolled back 85% includingThe Paris Accord. Emissions and Green were set back in 2009, I worked on ACES.
Job creation....  Obama/Biden 2013-2016: 216,000/month.   and  2017-present: MINUS-136,000/month.  Trump/Pence 2017-through-February 2020: 185,000/month  And that's while robbing the Treasury blind to redistribute to the rich.

Your being conned by the Dems. Biden might as well be a cardboard cutout. Really who do you think your voting for it‚Äôs not Biden. It will be everybody who wants America The land of the unfree.
I don‚Äôt believe Biden is going to look out for the many. I believe a lot of what he says is lip service. I do think though that Harris has a lot of good going for her &amp; can evolve past some things a lot of people don‚Äôt like. I think she can do some good if she‚Äôs willing to change
Ya know what‚Äôs kind of ironic? Trump and his friends at Fox use the same attacks so often, that their predictability has taken any sting out their messaging. I feel like everyone is so over their repetitive negativity that it‚Äôs making Biden/Harris feel even fresher.
So first thing on the Biden/Harris agenda is get rid of Freedom of Speech
Tell your followers they have to refresh the page to get to Biden's site.
The Biden/Harris speeches we‚Äôre amazing. It feels almost surreal to hear such polished and thoughtful statements, and such a relief to hear Kamala hold Trump accountable on a national stage. So much hope right now.
Unless I missed something from Judge Janine and Geraldo, is FOX News planning to harm Joe Biden before the election?

Biden‚Äôs handlers said do not touch her in any way. Just let her come up to the podium and smile üò©üò©üò©I‚Äôm going to take a Chance here, but does anybody else get the feeling that Bernie Bros are more than willing to cut off their nose to spite their face in this election?  Sure crap on Biden and maybe get 4 more years of Trump, blatant racism and kids in cages.  Good job!
I will put on a hazmat suit if I have to. I will be voting for Biden. Not for some self-centered washed up in competent failed so called President.
Wow! 50 yrs of politics and this is what he comes up with. Trump already said to wear masks, called for travel ban back in January when Biden said it was racist, and brokered  a middleast peace plan. I'm really struggling to see what people see in this guy
?Mandated Masks?  What‚Äôs next from Biden/Harris?  Given their propensity for control I imagine they will mandate tracer apps on our mandated smart phones. And they will probably pay for them.  Relax everyone, get a good cuppa Joe.
Anybody else think Joe Biden could have chosen Jeff Flake as a running mate and Trump and Fox News would say the pick was to far left to be trusted?
5) Biden picks Kamala Harris as running mate; 4) ‚ÄúFriday Night Massacre‚Äù at Post Office; 3) Wars and rumors thereof between Israel and Hamas, Turkey and Greece, and India and China; 2) Satanic Temple claims religious exemption from abortion restrictions;
If I want to vote for another lunatic, another man I wouldn‚Äôt trust around my daughters. And vote a woman who stated on national tv she believed Biden‚Äôs accusers then forgot about that because power seems more important to her into office? Yeah maybe ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è replace crazy with crazy?
That is the truth! Biden can't remember how to pronounce Kamala's name!
I honestly can‚Äôt vote for either of them I just can‚Äôt trump(racist egotistical rapist) and pence ( super racist ) Or Biden (secretly racist) and kamila ( queen of mass incarceration) I honestly at this point gonna let y‚Äôall pick how I die cause shits lose lose
I know we all hate trump but do y‚Äôall understand Biden is no different?
KAG 2020? Do you mean that you're promising more covid deaths? That's not so great so I'll be voting for Biden.

I think the AC went off! But what a wonderful speech from both of them! So exciting! Go Biden &amp; Harris!
In THIS moment Biden/Harris are proving that we do not have to hold the official title to bring about positive change.  By supporting them, we empower them to officiate change for the next four years.
This is democrat hatred and fake news rhetoric stirring up all the nut jobs thinking they now have a duty to remove our POTUS ! Especially now that they know the Biden Harris ticket is doomed!
This was the natural reaction to Biden's "You ain't black" comment:
Then your gonna complain if he‚Äôs in office again. atleast both Biden and his VP have an actual intelligence.
Tall seriously aren‚Äôt gonna vote cause miss Biden‚Äôs VP? so what your saying is you‚Äôd rather have a low IQ dumb ass as your president still? Smh
Remember, voting for Biden/Harris is only a temporary fix to the problem that is abolishing the idea of a two-party system that leads us to choose between corruption and maybe-less-corruption!
Because when Trump loses he wants Biden to have this big mess to try and get us out of while he sits back and criticizes him in tweets.
Why can‚Äôt people just disagree about the issues anymore? People feel compelled to propogate these insane lies about politicians they disagree with. Facebook is full of posts saying Kamala Harris‚Äô father is a slave trader or Joe Biden is evil, satanic, etc.
Do a person's actions factor in at all to your endorsements? Because she was picked because she's a cop in the 2020 world of "defund the police", her skin color, and her gender. Biden admitted this by limiting his choices.  At what point does "content of their character" begin?
I love you!   I look forward to all the good work you and Biden will do starting in January!!
Sad thing is I just read she can be president üò™ if something happens to Biden! Look out üá∫üá∏ America if they get in!
Kamala and Biden are extremely dangerous for America! Unless you like your whole pay check to go to taxes, lose your second amendment, and let our military go to hell! We need to stop them!!!!
I understand that I need to be more outraged about Presidential abuses and graft.  But I‚Äôm at my limit these days.  My outrage changes nothing.  So, I‚Äôm just going to wait until Nov, and vote for Joe Biden.
"I have a dream that my four little children will one¬†day¬†live in a nation where they will not be¬†judged¬†by¬†the¬†color of their skin but by¬†the¬†content of their¬†character." - MLK Joe Biden purposely choose a woman who is a POC. Makes me sick!
Biden is consistently cringeworthy and it has zero to do with his speech impediment. People say it's elder abuse because he looks confused. It makes me sad.
If Trump publicly calls for Green / Libertarian candidates to be a part of the debate process, it would severely damage the Biden campaign. Either Biden is cool with the process, and gets his vote further split, or he isn't, and he hates democracy.
Doesn‚Äôt matter who he picks, I‚Äôm voting for Joe Biden‚ù§Ô∏è
Trump rocks right back at work Biden would be hiding under the desk lol
Of course Biden is against lowering taxes and lies about what Trump said

Oh I agree I‚Äôd never take a trump vaccine.  I‚Äôm waiting for Joe Biden.  And the vaccine I follow is the Oxford one just because I read one of the scientists behind it injected it into her own kids.  (Obviously older kids)
I see a lot of you call out Trump's clear bullshit, so vote Biden, for the love of God before this nation crumbles any more than it has already, Trump ain't gonna change, things will not get better with this man as our leader, the last four years should've been proof of that.
We need to keep Biden out! No raising taxes!!

This is a fucking distraction... i don't care what he said.. Im still riding with Biden..OPINION: When Trump inevitably insults Kamala Harris with misogynistic and racist stereotypes, she and Joe Biden should respond with positivity. His hatred will alienate voters and help the Democrats win in 2020.

Arguing with Bernie-or-Busters isn't to beat Trump. The left will not cost Biden the election. It's to make the left a part of a voter bloc that SOMEONE wants to win over in 2024, rather than make them the same fucking afterthought they were before 2016.
It really does suck, I agree. But things can actually improve. There are several progressive candidates winning Congress and they'll probably push the administration toward the left, in case Biden wins and the election is not stolen.
No, I have some data. More Biden voters intend to v-b-m vs. Trump voters, who disproportionately favor in-person voting. This partisan division has opened up b/c of Trump's statements re v-b-m. 1/

Sad to say, but it's all too predictable that Biden will say something like, "Our country needs to heal, we aren't going to look backward, we're going to move forward", and not hold Trump accountable. Same as Obama did not hold Bush accountable.

Funny how suggesting both candidates meet a neutral Black leader is some how sabotaging Biden campaign. Why is it that his campaign is so dependent on Black people getting the shaft n not complaining about it? Seems like they want to continue business like usual not change things
Sure, Trump has deep respect for the law, so much so that he sees himself &amp; his buddies as completely above it!  The reality is that NYC will vote for Biden in large numbers &amp; this endorsement will have zero impact on the overall electoral result.   #BidenHarris2020

THE REAL REASON WHY JOE BIDEN PICKED KAMALA HARRIS FOR HIS RUNNING MATE
As this political circus is rolling out I see Dems as true task masters.Even as much as Biden telling black ppl,‚Äùyou ain‚Äôt black if ur not Dem‚Äù.That was NOT a gaffe,he truly believes it.They R control freaks,even highjacked the BLM.Wants to control mask wearing,THINK about it.
I have no problem saying that what Bernie is doing NOW, is evil. What I don't know is was he or his family threatened gbecause he, unlike Michelle, has a long documented record of fighting against everything Biden and Harris stand for.
Pelosi should join Biden in his basement.
cause most of us would see through this BS going on  they want votes but offer nothing to get us to vote  you can not run on trump bad  they need to offer some change  biden said nothing will change
I predict, just like the Hippies, the young Progressives (who won't vote Biden/Harris) will be flesh eating, money grubbing jackasses in ten years.

When you settle out of court to avoid media coverage you know that something stinks.  That's basically admission of guilt. How many African Americans or other minorities are on his cabinet?  Biden served under an African American president and he picked ethically diverse VP

We need to start counting the days since Biden and Harris haven't taken questions from the press.
Americans deserve to know the facts and the truth about ‚ÄúCrossfire Hurricane‚Äù. NO  should be subjected to ‚Äúbanana republic‚Äù tactics in the USA. Obama-Biden‚Äôs actions w/ support from the deep state and MSM were un-American. Tarnished the reputation of  üá∫üá∏
the Biden supporters who tell us were brainwashed by the NRA, LMFAO, I don't think so, were of sound mind to making up are own minds, unlike liberals who watch CNN, and learn nothing going on in the world, unless its another lie about trump, STOP WATCHING SOCIALIST NEWS CNN MSNBC
Biden is clearly the better choice for the environment over trump don‚Äôt come at me with stupid nonsensical and illogical fallacies bc it‚Äôs disrespectful to my intelligence
Her first debate when she called out Biden‚Äôs bussing policy was legitimately impressive, though, in terms of making big waves. I expect in her debate against Pence, we‚Äôll be seeing that version of Kamala.
If Biden wins, this gif is gonna blow up.
WELL .... You have done it NOW! You have PISSED OFF ALL Americans Democrats &amp; Republicans  I don't know who was giving you advice about the USPS ... but......THEY WERE WRONG! This was a STUPID move and probably just SUNK your Reelection!  BIDEN and Harris 2020
Trump is moldy bread and biden is moldy cheese Sure both have mold,  but cheeses like bleu cheese have mold AND are safe to eat  My point being Both have mold,  but one is 110% more harmful than the other   And if you cant choose between them,  you lack critical thinking skills

I think she should take that time to speak about how she raised so much money and said she would vote for biden and is still only given 60 seconds. Talk about some progressive victories and say we need more progressives running for congress

Joe Biden has been in government for almost 50 years getting paid every day...can you name 5 major accomplishments he has had. I‚Äôll even give you one...the disasterous 1994 Crime Bill...so seriously, try without Googling (it doesn‚Äôt help) Name 4 accomplishments...
I thought she was running for BO, what‚Äôs all this President talk...Ohhhhhhh so you all know that Biden is a prop, thanks for confirming!
I think it makes them both racist. They both support the same racist agenda. No? Just bcz she is a POC doesn't make her exempt from racism. Biden found the perfect running mate...someone who locked up more blacks than he did.
One of the perks of owning our home is that now I can take part in the American tradition of lawn-sign warfare. Doesn‚Äôt help that I‚Äôm smack in the middle of Trump County, NYC, but I have to do something to fight back.  Current winner is ‚ÄúBiden 2020: Dear Lord Make It Stop‚Äù
Kamala Harris said Joe was a racist and groper on the campaign trail. Now  picked for VP Biden is a American hero.
Biden and Harris pushing for the minority and black votes. Ask yourself what has the democrats done in the past 30 years for both. It took a businessman to become president to help minorities And blacks move forward. Trump has done more in 3 yrs then anyone
fuck biden fuck trump we've been given the illusion of choice but the reality is the system is fucked
Joe Biden used to believe Mrs Hillary Clinton should've been the President of the United States of America not Mr Donald Tump. But that was before he nominated Sen. Kamala Harris as his running mate for VP, somebody who makes all of us look younger.üåü
Yes Doctor Biden  God Blees you a keep you safe on the trail .We have to win .
The same will happen, once or twice, in a Biden administration.  That's the result of having ambassadorial appointments go to donors.  Next term, I hope the appointees spend their own cash on residence upgrades and parties, the way they have always done...but not in this term.
Kamala Harris was force to leave the run for president with a 2% vote of confidence, now picked by Biden for Vice President she is now hailed as a super star by fake news and the, Democrat party. Hippocrates
Is Kamala Harris perfect? Probably not.  Your tweet is critical enough to make me believe you would vote against her.    Fine. Do it.  You'll never find a job.  At least with Biden, you have a chance.

Unless Biden goes into complete basement mode and lets Harris be the surrogate, I don't think the focus on her lasts more than a couple of weeks. Chatter will still come up.  But do you think they'd just ignore Biden?  I support him, and recognize there is MATERIAL on him.

It is crystal clear what their intentions are. Biden is a weak AF candidate with dementia. It‚Äôs common sense. I also really trust 3rd party ballot harvesters.....NOT!
If there is mandatory mail in ballots it will be the most fucked up fraudulent election in history. Ballots will be tossed, forged and 3rd party operatives will pick them up. Unofficial ballots won‚Äôt be counted for half a year. They know Biden is weak AF and has dementia
You LOST me at "The Biden-Harris ticket is formidable"   The only and I mean ONLY way  loses in 2020 is Election?Voter Fraud........
Serious question: is there an actual political strategy here, or are you just being an idiot. You are aware Biden won‚Äôt be spending a dime in New York no matter what you tweet, right.
I think his chances of 2024 are done if Biden wins which I fully expect.  I highly doubt Kamala would step aside. Maybe a shot at VP though.
So I guess Biden fits your standard of what a Catholic is then..
I am not one of those "Biden people". Trump is who he is but to experience the idiocies of other Americans regurgitating Trump's nonsensical thinking makes it very difficult to defend my country to  people around the world who are now always laughing at us.
I suspect Amy K will be getting her reward soon.  After Clyburn, she did more to boost Biden's campaign than anyone. Both with the endorsement and gracefully bowing out of VP.  What Biden does for her is more important than Harris's graciousness.
wrong. his voters are accultured now to not wearing masks or believing in the dangers of covid...they will go to their local polling place and vote for him happily, even rationalizing that if they do die, it'll be for their country. biden voters are more cautious, so we're fucked

I love you Leo!  So full of energy. Biden stinks.  TRUMP 2020. He better give you that hat.
The literally whole 2020 election game plan has been to fear monger Trump. Especially where Black people are concerns. A Blue State could have a racial situation they refuse to address and it‚Äôs ‚ÄúLook how‚Äôs Trump doing us going vote Biden to stop this‚Äù
Biden's son had just died, Clinton had very recently been extremely popular, had great relationships with vital Dem constituencies, and oh yeah, won the fuckin' popular vote. Baring Comey and Wikileaks, she walks to the presidency. Because she lost doesn't make it a bad choice.
You have entirely too much faith that America the organization will stop going to war and that Biden once elected will appoint good judges that will be helpful to black society. Dems want to abolish BM and we still got to vote on those other issue, nice try tho
With Trump in office Black people‚Äôs eyes are open to the racism with Kamala and Biden many of us will be sheep. Who ever wins the plans are roughly the same only with Democrats in a opposition positions they will be more willing to come to the table with tangible next cycle.
You can‚Äôt saying your not trying to let things get worst as you are campaigning for the worst option. Biden/Kamala can get more done in the form of oppressing Black society because they are positions as our ‚Äúteammates‚Äù. All eyes are on Trump so it‚Äôs easier to counter his racism.
How is Biden a centrist. I love how you act like he isn‚Äôt a proven racist who if given the presidency would quadruple the amount of Black people in prison. Motherfucker already promised to increase their budget not defund or demilitarize.
How are they far worst? Can you point to any Trump policy that‚Äôs been as destructive to Black society as the Biden‚Äôs Law? You do know Kamala Harris refused to prosecute cops? Please explain how Biden/Kamala r the lesser of two evils to Black society? With words not talking points
#GiulianiMarriedHisCousin is carrying #TrumpVirus‚Äô water and lying as usual. These are scare tactics meant to replace a plan. Trump has no plan, just like he has had no plan for the pandemic.

Probably promised a cabinet appointment if she attacks and Biden/Harris elected.
My democratic black family are not happy about Joe Biden &amp; Harris, the only ones I see celebrating are white liberals.  The same ones who were screaming BLM a few weeks back.  These people don't care about black lives.  I love seeing others see things for what they are.
That Biden was VP in an administration that presided over a recovery from the brink of an almost depression would make this a hard sell to anyone except Trump's lowly educated fans.

Thanks for the reply. I should probably disclose I'm kind of subtweeting a group of people, and not you. I'm so irritated w/ those who keep insisting Biden will prosecute Trump when he literally keeps telling us he won't. Fantasy and projection are not helpful in any way.

Ukraine was manufactured and it failed. In fact it suggests Biden‚Äôs family used Air Force 2 to conduct personal business with China/Ukraine. Russia highlighted Clinton‚Äôs paid for fake intel anti get warrant from Obama‚Äôs justice dept to spy on trump team. Smart people realize this
China wants Joe Biden in the White House so they can return to ripping off our country.  We can‚Äôt let that happen.
Listen I'm on board with Mr Biden and Ms Harris but being an extreme progressive I don't expect too much. Just rid us of this disease that is currently oozing from the white house, attorney general office and sec of state. Cause if Trump   steals the election USA won't recover

I dont have an agenda I just think there is a difference between rape and what biden did which is still disgusting they have very distinct definitions and misusing it weakens how bad each actually is.
The head of your party, Trojan Joe Biden, publicly declared blacks are incapable of thinking for themselves which makes them slightly worse than latinos. Looks like the Democrats are going to have to own that, don‚Äôt it?
Rape is sexual abuse yes they're in the same category but there is a difference between forcing yourself on a child and having non consensual sex and the (still disgusting things) Biden did on TV.
Question I haven‚Äôt been following too closely so maybe you already answered this but do you still think Biden is a sexual abuser? Do you still think he is a racist?  Why did you withhold information that would have freed and innocent person. FINALLY WHAT ARE YOUR PRONOUNS

It‚Äôs so funny reading political post about how ass Biden is but that‚Äôs the guy we need in office because he‚Äôs a lot better than what we got rn lol #SettleForBiden
The only pertinent question to me, as a Biden supporter, is ‚Äúwill this newfound peace and accord disappear if Trump is no longer president?‚Äù If the answer is no, then what good was the agreement in the first place. If yes then cool. Thanks Trump.
China and Iran want Biden ans Russia wants trump, his reply ‚ÄúI dont care‚Äù
While I'm glad  are no longer silent, I have some questions:  1) Do you think GOP policies are pro-life? 2) Would you prefer four more years of Trump or a Biden administration?  3) Which party's policies, on whole, will be more likely to drive down abortion rates?
Yeah, the leftist governors shut thier states down. The ones with the highest numbers of deaths. Ass backwards shutdowns they are using to discredit the president. Smart ppl see this. Biden loses bigly on 2020

Trump‚Äôs Plan An Election Win No Matter What-Reducing the number of Biden voters by as much as possible.  -Increasing the number of Biden voters mailing in their votes.  -Wrecking the U.S. Postal Service so votes don‚Äôt get received on time, or can‚Äôt get counted in a timely way.1/2
Two reasons we have President Trump and VP Pence are the Clinton/Kaine ticket didn't pass some purity tests, and it wasn't inspirational enough. Please remember what's at stake this year, and vote for the better option of Biden and Harris.
This is part of the reason a 71/29 Biden poll is so meaningless when the White House will do everything in its power to keep democrats from voting.
Expansion? You mean the worst economy since the great depression created by Obama and Biden tax and spend and democrat failed housing initiatives.
The real question is - when will  be endorsing Biden/Kamala? Now that the VP has been picked, no need to wait any longer.
I think...I THINK this is her saying not to send in your mail-in ballot for Joe Biden because you might end up with the black lady.   That's what I think she was probably going for.   I say this without looking at a clip because why would I do that to myself?  #BidenHarris
in all seriousness: those who are voting need to show up bc they‚Äôre already showing signs of trying to cheat this election. it‚Äôs not in the bad just bc Biden is popular, that‚Äôs the same mistake Hillary made.
I‚Äôm 57. He certainly wasn‚Äôt the  first, second, third...choice for me and many of my friends. But I will absolutely vote for Biden in November. Pretty sure my hair, which has NO gray, will turn white if we have another 4 years of Trump.

She's nowhere close to popular among Indian Americans here. Actually by choosing her as VP Biden has lost whatever support he had from Indian Americans.
Another reason it‚Äôs irresponsible to compare trump to Biden. Biden won‚Äôt be tweeting about ratings and asking for praise from Fox News while 166k Americans are dead from a virus. This is a man who doesn‚Äôt know what compassion is.

I dont have an agenda I just think there is a difference between rape and what biden did which is still disgusting they have very distinct definitions and misusing it weakens how bad each actually is.
The head of your party, Trojan Joe Biden, publicly declared blacks are incapable of thinking for themselves which makes them slightly worse than latinos. Looks like the Democrats are going to have to own that, don‚Äôt it?
Rape is sexual abuse yes they're in the same category but there is a difference between forcing yourself on a child and having non consensual sex and the (still disgusting things) Biden did on TV.
Priceless. Biden will ask him the same question at the debates.
Rape has a set of rules that make it rape i am not defending biden I think everything he does on camera is absolutely wrong but it 100 percent is not rape and labeling that takes away from actual instances of rape from people in power.

You can't honestly tell me that Biden is a strong candidate in comparison to guys like Clinton and Reagan. I feel like we're in a no win situation. Trump didn't kill all of those people. His delayed reaction did cost lives. I would like to see what happens from here.
The only reason why Biden has any chance is because of the virus + he's milked it and Black people aren't so high on Harris as Biden thinks. I'm not loving this election. Just because Trump is a fing liar isn't a reason to vote for a weak minded candidate ( maybe w/dementia)
Harris was friends with Beau Biden. It's getting to the point where the age for being president should be limited. Both men scare me. Harris will destroy Pence in a debate but Trump will destroy Biden. Since Harris's nomination, betting odds have moved closer to Trump.
I don't know. Harris is a sensational talker + seems to be a no-nonsense person from what I hear. It's Biden that scares me. People have little confidence that he complete an entire term ( he'll be 82! and he doesn't seem strong. Harris was a sentimental choice for him?

Good enough for me! I don't want to hear about Medicare for all nor stupid green deal. I wonder if the squad truly knows how much Obama/Biden did for the environment? Trump rolled back 85% includingThe Paris Accord. Emissions and Green were set back in 2009, I worked on ACES.
Job creation....  Obama/Biden 2013-2016: 216,000/month.   and  2017-present: MINUS-136,000/month.  Trump/Pence 2017-through-February 2020: 185,000/month  And that's while robbing the Treasury blind to redistribute to the rich.

The healing begins on November 3rd. Then on December 14, the electoral college will convene to certify Biden's victory. Then on January 20, 2021...EVICTION DAY FOR #TurdOrange! #Truth #BidenHarris2020 #Herstory2020
The argument for Biden is ‚Äúat least he‚Äôs not Trump‚Äù and the argument for Trump is ‚Äúat least he didn‚Äôt create 20 years of mass incarceration by himself‚Äù ü§®
Kamala Harris gave an inspiring speech today. With COVID 19 cases rising and the economy crumbling under the Trump administration, I am confident that Biden and Harris will be the next President and Vice President of the USA.  #BidenHarris2020Landslide
Kelly was horrible when asked tough question like why trump say open schools when stats are terrible and she denies and then goes into anti Biden Harris ramble she shouldn‚Äôt be invited back
It‚Äôs also going to backfire since Trump can‚Äôt stay away during a speech and Biden gives a great delivery as today proved.
Irrelevant to your point. Just saying Biden has said MANY stupid things, just like Trump.  I don‚Äôt trust either. Then again I don‚Äôt trust politicians at all ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

Listening to Biden‚Äôs speech. He is so much more together than tired Donald Dildo McFuckFace that the strategy of saying he is too old is going to backfire spectacularly. I predict a big bounce coming soon...
On the day that Kamala Harris was introduced as Biden's running mate, Trump looks and sounds pathetic.
I don‚Äôt believe Biden is going to look out for the many. I believe a lot of what he says is lip service. I do think though that Harris has a lot of good going for her &amp; can evolve past some things a lot of people don‚Äôt like. I think she can do some good if she‚Äôs willing to change
Ya know what‚Äôs kind of ironic? Trump and his friends at Fox use the same attacks so often, that their predictability has taken any sting out their messaging. I feel like everyone is so over their repetitive negativity that it‚Äôs making Biden/Harris feel even fresher.
I had hope for the first time in 4 years for our country listening to Joe Biden and Kamala Harris.  #BidenHarris2020
We may have our disagreements, but 1 thing we can agree on..Vote Biden!
So first thing on the Biden/Harris agenda is get rid of Freedom of Speech
Two sincere, simpatico, seasoned, singular, leaders joined to offer American people, badly hurting, that there is another way. A team emerged with purpose not to destroy but to build back better. This dual introduction went a long way to  give credence to the Biden Harris credo.
In Biden and Kamala‚Äôs  speech no mention of law and order and stopping the riots in the big cities
As a far-lefty statist yourself, it is expected that you would praise VP Biden‚Äôs speech
Tell your followers they have to refresh the page to get to Biden's site.
Get real.  Biden didn't want her. She was forced on him by his handlers.
The Biden/Harris speeches we‚Äôre amazing. It feels almost surreal to hear such polished and thoughtful statements, and such a relief to hear Kamala hold Trump accountable on a national stage. So much hope right now.
She is more Indian than black n her father side are plantation owners, who had slaves! Great choice Biden!
Listening to Biden and Harris speak just reminded me just how much of politics and media is propaganda and psychological manipulation and that the democrats and republicans are two sides of the same corrupt coin, send tweet
Unless I missed something from Judge Janine and Geraldo, is FOX News planning to harm Joe Biden before the election?
That‚Äôs fine if you don‚Äôt want Trump but like you should definitely not want Joe Biden lmao
I‚Äôm enjoying Democrats telling me how great Biden is and most of all how special a choice Harris is. Did i miss Dems primary? - by the way this Republican likes them.
Watching #Biden &amp; #Harris today brought up a feeling I hadn‚Äôt experienced in quite some time. I took a while for me to identify. I was afraid to give it a name, because that would leave me vulnerable. Ultimately I could not deny it &amp; called it what it is. #hope #BidenHarris2020

Biden speech- a pack of lies and totally divisive. Says Trump coddled Thugs and terrorists - while the coddling has happened in every democratic state. When they debate Trump will tear him apart.
When Joe Biden says the American working class needs someone on their side,He really means that he wants to unconstituatioanlly raise your taxes to unprecedented levels so that people who are abusing welfare programs and having kids they can‚Äôt take care of can live for freeüö¨üê∏
Biden is on his game.  This may be his strongest speech of the campaign.

Trump and his family had donated to Harris' campaign in California in 2008. I guess she wasn't so phony then. Trump has used the same line for Biden since the spring.  November cannot come soon enough. #BidenHarris2020

Let me be clear, I cannot stand the people who voted for Donald Trump the first time around. This time, I am in different. I know that I‚Äôm voting for Biden, but I can understand why somebody wouldn‚Äôt. Trump and Biden are virtually the same people. Both racist pedophile rapists.
'Centrist' Biden-Harris Ticket Exposes The Limits Of Our Political Language
And, for me, this applies if you just feel like voting Biden/Harris isn‚Äôt good enough for you. Get over yourselves &amp; do what needs to be done.
with the #DailyDoseofLies. Biden has a plan to create jobs and clean energy and he is not eliminating fracking. Clean energy is the future and Biden-Harris have a plan to get us there. #TrumpIsADisaster has no plan.
repeat after me: talking about Kamalas past is not going to change the fact she is nominated. complaining about Biden is not going to change the fact that he is the dem nominee. it may not be what we want, but it's what we have so we all have to deal with it for things to change
Biden may be a smaller individual, but he is by far the bigger man.

Ew fuck Biden
Also if the goal is to maximize Biden‚Äôs vote share being nice about it is very obviously the way to go
I am a single woman but my town is full of  ‚Äúhousewives‚Äù, of ALL races and enthnicities, and as you drive through our suburban streets, you see signs for Biden and BLM. Some are even these beautiful colorful large BLM signs made by kids. I have not seen one sign for Trump.
Biden is admitting that he is incapable of the job üò±üò±üò±üò±
LMAO. CNN is already reporting Kamala Harris will be ready when Biden "decides to step aside."
First debate Biden finished/gone.  Kamela Harris, fill void presumptive presidential candidate. Option 2 broker convention.
gets credit for sticking with his story, even if it is a pile of lies. #TrumpHasNoPlan and that is all there is. Mudslinging, lies, selective video editing to send a false message is all GOP has. Those true to the real GOP are supporting Biden bc Trump is so bad.
Out of everybody, Biden picked Kamala Harris!! smh ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
The propaganda machine is frantically looking for ways to erase Biden‚Äôs 8 point lead.
This is my favorite quality about Biden. All good leaders welcome disagreement it instructs good decision making.
She doesn‚Äôt have to say it, everyone knows it... one look at Biden (even with a teleprompter) and the diagnosis is clear
biden picking kamela as his VP and announcing it like the rest of us give a damn lmao. he could've picked Ivanka in black face and we still would vote for him.
Yea i just don't believe it. Maybe less voter turn out over all, still letting trump win, or something fucky with the mail now that his lackey is the new Post master General. I can't see ppl running out Biden
She won‚Äôt need to do anything, the media will present it as her and Biden‚Äôs strengths
It seems Biden‚Äôs dementia pales in comparison to Bill‚Äôs...
Kamala Harris Is Biden‚Äôs VP Pick | The Daily Social Distancing Show  via
Biden doesn‚Äôt need Kamala to blow it for him. Have you listened to him lately? He‚Äôs perfectly capable of blowing it on his own.
Harris is a good choice for Biden. Strategically, she will help in forming a strong coalition of varied voters, including moderates, to win the election. And she seems an intelligent, energetic, and capable politician, well suited to face the challenges of a post-Trump recovery.
I unequivocally support the Biden/Harris tckt. However I hope Warren &amp; her plans will be an integral part of our future. Also F Wall Street.
What about Harris Biden?  Backup long snapper for Pitt?
Thank you! Nobody wants Biden and Kamala but I‚Äôll take my chances with them over Trump any day....y‚Äôall really want another 4 years with Trump???
What a sell out . Are you nuts? Are you trying to weasel Biden out of a face to face presidential debate? No go!
. extreme positions, from raising taxes to abolishing private health insurance to comparing law enforcement officials to the KKK, show that the left-wing mob is controlling  candidacy, just like they would control him as president.
If Kamala polled 8% in her home state of California, she'll probably poll 2% nationwide. She'll pull Biden down from 12% to 5%.
Has the  (or any publication) asked the public for "advice" for any other VP pick? Pence? Biden? Kaine? Cheney? Gore? Invititations to mansplain were not forthcoming. Huh.  Maybe the NYTIMES needs some advice on how not to treat this candidate to their sexism.
So already staring the narrative for when Biden steps down from the presidency. We dont elect a president to be a temporary job
Your a very confused person.  Sad to read all the nonsense you post. Almost unbelievable, so why is that you believe Kamala Haris hates our country? How is it that Biden will hurt the bible? How will he hurt God? These are the comments I've heard thrown around.. enlighten us pls.
Be careful, Half of your party are really for Biden. Then again, I'm sure you already know that.
That sounds like a pretty good selling point for Biden. #BidenHarris2020

Vote. We can say Biden/Harris will win but only voting counts.
Isn‚Äôt Biden catholic?
Congratulations on the VP pick. At this point, I would vote for a paper bag.   But please PLEASE don‚Äôt insult my intelligence with the fake platitudes. Once upon a time, I did believe in the American ideals of which you speak but no more. So please, keep Biden in the basement.
Is it that you aren‚Äôt aware Biden is Catholic, or is this your lame attempt to claim he‚Äôs not really Catholic.

Anyone else still wondering what Joe Biden/Kamala Harris's plan for saving the middle class is? It's August 12th. Still waiting.
Pretty sure VP Biden has a plan in place if it comes to that.

With our book, *Suffrage at 100: Women in American Politics Since 1920* now out,  and I put Kamala Harris‚Äôs selection in historical perspective:
Is she working to get African Americans vote or Jamaican Indian?? Or subletting her morals get rid of all of them?Especially since Biden wants to push fo abortion!
Biden May have told him.
I just genuinely can‚Äôt tell if biden‚Äôs blatant racial pandering is somehow working or if these people are just willfully ignoring both of dangerous histories
Check your inbox. There is an RNC talking points email that says the exact opposite. It says that Democratic progressives are complaining about Biden picking such a centrist.  You guys are incompetent.
