Yes I would do to a rally GO TRUMP would you go to Bidens basement üòÇ
If you‚Äôre serious about getting rid of Trump then it requires supporting Biden for this election.  After that, I don‚Äôt think any democrat expects you or the project lincoln folks to be permanent members of the party.
i will say it here and now and ive made this prediction before in the last several months..our President  Donald J Trump will be assassinated in the next few  months..sad to say but i have no doubt there is so much hatred for his PRO AMERICAN policies..GOD  save and protect himüôè
Oops.
definitely Trump all the way!!!  100%
This administration is pretty damn transparent with their vindictive retribution.....you think we buy this?  China wants Trump to lose the election.
Oddly the Chinese want Trump to lose, and Russian is doing their damnest to see that Trump wins....so, your post his is VERY suspicious!

Haven‚Äôt seen anything great Donald Trump is done
I officially left the GOP when trump was nominated, but realized during Obama‚Äôs first term what a great president he was. Healthcare is a big issue for me and the GOP does not care about it. Religious right also took over party. #LincolnVoter
Maybe Joe should have a committee to research and list all the nastiness Trump committed to undo ASAP!
All name calling and not a single factual reason why America should not re-elect trump.

Ummm. I watched like six democratic debates. Biden didn‚Äôt seem ‚Äúincoherent‚Äù at all. But the Trump interview with Axios?  That‚Äôs another story altogether.
How many blatant lies did Trump say? And you‚Äôre aplogizing over a technicality. Please. You did great.
Thank God he sent Trump
He's even mimicking Trump's hand gestures!  Sick!
Because Donald trump has already made decisions that have impacts. This isn‚Äôt a hypothetical how will you handle this issue, it‚Äôs a why are you handling it this way
I wonder why only 25 Republicans voted for it? All democrats voted for it and it was started by John Lewis so why didn't trump say it was John's bill?
People are wearing masks, social distancing. What else do you want? Trump can not control a virus you idiots. Funerals for congressman and protesting is ok though!

You know President Obama isn't in office, right? Why aren't you using the current numbers? Or compare it to GDP? Pres Obama 8 years added $9 trillion to the debt. trump...$7trill in less than 4 years. Winningüëç silly metric to evaluate by anyway.
Of course it goes without and anyone who has worked an election knows valid signatures are required.  But this is the kind of stupid remark one has to suffer when listening to trump supporters
I‚Äôm starting to think it might be a good thing for Biden to debate Trump. It would create a good comparison in cognitive ability.
You're giving trump waaay too much credit...I don't think he even knows enough about the constitution to have any feelings about it. He is ignorant and fine with that.
Pretty craven and low behavior....but in these days, nothing is beneath Trump!
Wasn't that Trump's idea?
Trump could you shut up for just a day
Not only CAN'T Trump read, he clearly can't understand facts or refuses reality if it doesn't jive with his delusions!

Some of these Fox morons are playing into their soon-to-be competitors hands...OAN/Trump News will soon be having their lunch and halving their revenues.
Trump really doesn‚Äôt care about sending kids back to school...He merely wants them ‚Äúwarehoused‚Äù so parents can go back to work...assuming there are jobs to go back to.
That is pretty damn funny and probably the most hypocritical thing I‚Äôve ever seen. They have marked Trump for years and never once challenged a policy position it‚Äôs always been he‚Äôs a racist he‚Äôs a sexist with no facts to back it up
Try to stay focused. Not talking BLM/antifa. Am I to assume you're in eastern WA? Inslee has done a very decent job. WA was ground zero for the pandemic and your numbers aren't the worstüëç what states that shut down followed trump? What was his guidance? I remember free MI...
What concessions did Microsoft make?...Violating user data is Trump‚Äôs excuse to attack  but let‚Äôs be real he only cares about how it‚Äôs being used to attack him.  He could have complained earlier if it was a true concern over privacy.
Like the ones that followed trump? Texas, Florida, Arizona, Georgia...so if a foreign army invaded the US each individual state should develop a plan to protect their own state? trump's failings are painfully obvious. The numbers and divisiveness don't lie.
There was? Please enlighten me. You do know that Dr. Birx came out yesterday recommending schools not reopen until outbreaks are under control. As did Dr. Redfield. trump tweeted this morning that numbers are down and schools need to reopen. Where's he following the experts?
You realize Trump created all those issues right? We‚Äôre fighting him. I wonder who is Satans spawn at this point? Don‚Äôt be on the wrong side of history.
Can you tell me the last time Fauci briefed the president? Almost 8 weeks ago. Provide where Fauci says trump is doing a good job. Early on he praised the hard work of the task force. Where's trump's mask. If it's up to the states why threaten money if they don't open schools?
How do you propose to stop the spread between state populations when there's no centralized plan? trump would've secured a second term had he acted responsibly. I would hate the thought of a 2nd term, but would've been happy that not as many died and our commerce reopened.
Who's politicizing the data? trump is ignoring the advice of his top 3 scientists regarding masks, HCQ, and school openings. Why are we doing so poorly with combatting the virus? Aside from the HCQ, what trump plan have the dems railed against?
The biggest deal is I don't believe President Obama is in office. You mentioned earlier that dems can't handle/accept that trump won. Seems more that trump and his supporters can't accept that Obama is far more liked and respected. *see the Reagan Foundation's request of trump.
Is the "va thing" in the beginning of his presidency the atrocities happening at Walter Reed? The terrible support veterans were receiving. How about veteran's choice? A program trump takes credit for but was started towards the end of President Obama's 2nd term?
To be honest, all my wounded Warriors homes served under Bush. Were you one of the one's complaining that Obama was reducing troop deployments? Winding down Bush's wars. Please inform me what troops trump has brought home? None. He's maintained the same force levels.
Trump has never been in congress, bud. You mentioned him signing the First Step bill...that's what I'm referring to
Biden has admitted he didn't get everything right, but always did his best. Would "I take no responsibility" trump admit a mistake? He won't retract his statements regarding the central park 5! I am happy he bravely signed a bipartisan bill. Next accomplishment?
üö®üö®üö®we have another simpleton making a complex issue sound simpleüö®üö®üö® You realize the 94 crime bill regards federal inmates. Many of you think it addresses the mass incarceration at large. This bill wasn't trump's idea and was passed with bipartisan support. Boldüëç
Indolent? Now THAT is the laziest, tiresome, insular  and predictable explanation usually put forth by selfish, greedy grasping assholes, who blame the OTHER for all of the ills of a culture that knowingly, willfully and deliberately went headlong to Trump and the dark side. Sad
Can Trump reduce the Price of Tik Tok for Microsoft to buy.  Not ethical  ... not that it matters
Nobody is blaming trump for the virus. Only his mishandling of a response. Approximately 13k die per year from aids, which is sad. However, the Obama administration provided $4bill to research and aid to combat aids. Your claim 110k died in 8 years is less than 150k in 5 monthsüëç
Why has Fauci become a hot topic for you guys? He makes recommendations based on current science. If he's so bad why doesn't trump and the gop get rid of him? States don't have to follow his recommendations. Florida, Texas, Georgia, Arizona didn't
I guess Biden is going to have to drain the swamp when he gets in. Trump just went and filled it up.
You use an opinion piece for your rebuttal? I'll stick with the scientific world and studies at large. I was and am for exploring treatments. HCQ was tested and rebuked. The only proponent appear to be quacks, conspirators, and trumpers. Show me where Fauci says trump follows
Trump is a pig. But he‚Äôs a fighter. I‚Äôd rather have a fighter then a pansy like Biden. Biden is passive aggressive. Trump doesn‚Äôt care, he‚Äôll fight for the US anywhere he goes. It may not be cordial or politically correct but as long as he has the United States back, I am in.
You must not have watched the hearing. Look at the entirety of the hearing and not sound bites and clips from Fox. Why doesn't trump and the GOP act to remove him? Because unlike trump, jordan, gaetz, gohmert, etc... he is respected around the world.
Thanks for this link! Its amazing that anyone could vote for trump knowing what he did with those young girls! Wtf
Wow! Everyone should read this!
Your ignorance is astonishing. Do you believe the likes of "dr" Immanuel or the scientific world (CDC, FDA, VA, WHO)regarding HCQ? Fauci has not said trump has followed his recommendations and has in fact not met with him in nearly 2 months. Free Michigan is promoting safety?
Explain your arguments. Fauci has said that trump has listened to him. Doesn't mean he's following his advice. Does trump wear  mask? Did trump promote the systematic reopening? Does trump still promote HCQ? Why is the US leading the world in death/cases? Because of Fauci? Nope
You didn't answer my question. What message did trump put out there that we're to rally around? Sorry, I don't care to follow a guy for an ideology that has caused far more death than any other country in the world. Show me a "dem" that's promoting rioting and I'll opine. Focusüëç
Is this your only claim to fame?  Oh that's right, you're Trump's buddy, the NRA's darling, and the guy who thinks he knows more than women when it come to taking care of their own bodies!!!  ONE TERM CORY!
Start with Trump, Clinton, Prince Andrew, Wexner, and Dershowitz.
Negative   You have to vote for someone that can win against Trump otherwise you are throwing you vote away
But, but, but....your "arguments" are not based on reality. I don't remember Fauci recommending to Trump, "sir, don't do anything. It will miraculously disappear. It'll be a beautiful thing."
What was the "fight" that our leader proposed that we should follow? The, "I don't take any responsibility" doctrine? "Masks aren't for me"? It's the state's responsibility...until I say they need to force schools open. Trump's "leadership" is rudderless.

So, I believe you like this guy for his ideology and not what he has accomplished. His current actions, tweets, and speech are still consistent with his (and father's) racist past. Why is the main GOP distancing themselves from Trump?
That's what you consider a rebuttal? I'm the one in fantasy land? He's a simple president for a simple thinker. More cops have died (by a yuuuge margin) from CV. Seriously ask yourself what has Trump accomplished. How's that wall? His magnificent health plan? American industry?

Or ask about this please - it should fit right in with your absurd narrative -  For the first time in a week, there were zero clashes between law enforcement and protestors in Portland last night.  Why?   Trump's federal agents left.
Trump should fire Fauci and hire Dr Gold.
Ummmm...no? The US has strict guidelines for the use of medicine and medical devices. Doctors have never been free to not follow science and do as they will. The virus is being handled differently because the WORLD hates Trump...shhhhü§´
I'll help you..."they" are the VAST majority of the medical world. All the legitimate studies that concluded this opinion. It's amazing people would believe hundreds of thousands of medical professionals are hiding a magic cure just to stick it to Trump.

Remember when you called trump " a fraud"?  What has he possibly done that would make you --or anyone  capable of conscious thought--think any differently 3 1/2 years later?  He gets worse every damn day.
We would have had half that already paid for if Trump wasn't doing his Trump thing....FAILING!
The biggest thing I‚Äôve noticed is nationalism vs globalism. That was the entire premise that Trump ran on in 2016. You‚Äôll find a lot of racism rooted in nationalism, especially white nationalists.
If Trump redesigned the Protests would stop ..... until they realized Pence was there

The "model" you quoted came out months after the pandemic started from the WH. It was a guesstimate on how many COULD have died. What national plan was implemented to curb the numbers? Do you recall Trump said it's up to the individual states? I'm sorry, but you sound foolish.
Don, with respect for the great work you're doing, this is not a useful approach. Trump wants to kill USPS as we know. But more funding now is not the answer. His hand-picked USPS leader is openly &amp; intentionally ordering employees to slow service. He must be removed immediately!

Meadows is leading Trump around by the nose.
New Trump Exec Order allowing women to vote. He is the greatest president of all time. Now if he could only end prohibition.
I don't understand why all these men refuse to speak up? What and who are they so afraid of?  Losing their jobs? You would think DeSantis and Trump were Mafia godfathers. "No position to balk the governor?" They are in exactly the RIGHT position to tell the truth!
Right? I mean, these Trump rally‚Äôs are out of control!
I still think every Trump/Putin phone call is about trump tower Moscow. Putin just gets him on the phone and is like ‚ÄúI really think we‚Äôre close to doing this deal this time, I really do‚Äù like he has for 30yrs and that‚Äôs all trump cares about so that‚Äôs all they talk about
Trump wants to shut down TikTok because the users claim they banded together and gobbled up all the tickets to his rally in Tulsa that almost nobody showed up for. He wants to stufle anybody that disagrees with him he wants to shut up....like twitter, Facebook, CNN &amp; Fox News.
You guys never stop with your bullshit.  It won‚Äôt work. Joe has my vote ! I also saw Joe shake Trump‚Äôs hand, I‚Äôm not holding that against him either.
you guys do not choose Susan Rice, you'll hear nothing but Bengazi and her son is a Trump supporter! Kick yourself in the chin why don't you.
Has to be all the H1-B visa holders lashing out because Trump is going to get their asses canned.
We could be at or near a point like this right now.  People continue to obsess over someone that is gone from politics, and who was investigated before they left.this is happening in part because the message "lock her up" was such a passionately successful one for trump that 4/5
Repubs have always wanted to gut our "entitlement programs". Trump is their useful idiot. Make it seem like it's a win buy telling people you'll have more money in your pockets never saying a thing how it will negatively impact seniors &amp; is of no benefit to people who have no job
I actually heard Republicans that are going to vote Biden say if Whitmere is VP they'll go back to trump.
Are they protesting Trump's environmental policies that harm unborn babies?
If you choose to not vote for Biden, you're voting for Trump. Don't ever call yourself a never Trumper either. People like you are why we are in this mess. Think of the people who are being harmed by Trump‚Äôs policies &amp; actions. Think of the seniors who rely on SS &amp; Medicare.

I'm shocked to there any parents left who aren't outraged at Trump and the federal government for fucking up the COVID response and ruining the Fall Semester for millions of children.

I hate Trump. He is a compulsive liar
A lot of funny observations tonight about trump &amp; ACA.   Stay focused. They‚Äôre a bunch of traitorous thieves waving a shiny object while they rip you off.
Schumer now gives his blessing that schools should open? Trump has been saying this for MONTHS! Now who is wrong As Always? Vote these bastards out! PERIOD!
Narcissists are going love other Narcissists like Trump. He is the only one that doesnt make them realize their dysfunction.
I don‚Äôt throw this word around, and I really don‚Äôt like saying it, but I HATE Trump with every fibre of my being. Every. Single. One.
President Trump signing a major executive order, for health insurance companies to cover pre-existing conditions! Why didn‚Äôt President Obama think of that? Oh wait, it‚Äôs already in the affordable care act!
I‚Äôve had two people tell me that Beyonc√© stans are like Trump supporters and that is so WILDLY disrespectful
"Trump says he plans on making insurers cover pre-existing conditions ‚Äî a protection which already exists under Obamacare"
Wow...1984 a bit late: just in time for 2024? Police state rising unless we can dislodge Trump et al from the WH!!üò°üò°üò°
trump tells you what to think, say, and do. And like all cult members you do exactly what he wants.
Self trepanning.  Trump say it kills #COVID__19.  #ThingsMorePopularThanTrump
Wow wtf is this guy? He is starting to show symptoms. Of Trump syndrome. Where is the vaccine for this?
You are WRONG.  People who pay cash (i.e. no other coverage) pay the most. The ACA established protection for pre-existing conditions. Trump and his congressional followers have tried repeatedly to repeal these protections. McCain put country over party.
This time next year Donald Trump could be sitting in jail
That‚Äôs also not a law, but an executive order, so he can rescind it at any time... Related: payroll tax cuts will be later used as a pretext to cut SS and Medicare benefits. Oh - and Kanye has sold out to Trump...
That‚Äôs a pretty old clipping you‚Äôve got there. Do you really want to go tit for tat between Biden and Trump? Why didn‚Äôt Trump attention the memorial for John Lewis? Why does Trump inspire nazis to march in the streets with torches?
Obamacare was a scam. They made it with Blackfoot deals with big pharmaceutical and insurance lobbyists. Trump‚Äôs making sure the good part is kept, something they could have done without the scam but didn‚Äôt.
Trump Is Not Well #TrumpIsNotWell
Are you dumb axios or do you not realize Obamacare is a failure, leaving more still uninsured than it covers while jacking up costs? It needs to be repealed but Trump is keeping one of the only good things from it.
Anti-maskers explain themselves #antimaskers  via
Certainly Obama's is bigger than Trump's.
It's hard to believe that even Trump's most fervent base could believe the avalanche of unfulfilled promises that have come from this man's speeches.
I‚Äôm not even a Trump fan, but Jesus Christ. Has it occurred to anyone that not all plans cover pre-existing conditions and the media claims he wants to take what coverage there is away 24/7? Of course not. Maybe he felt the need to put an end to that lie.
The way to protect Obama‚Äôs policy gains was always to get Trump to think he created them, and the plan is working perfectly.
I love that Trump called out the Dems especially Nervous Nancy on the relief package. It is amazing that these Liberats are starting to go a little right cause they know they are in deep trouble come Nov. Where is Hunter? Just saying. We will not see any debates, or a VP pick.
The framers were unanimous that Congress, as the representatives of the people, should be in control of public funds‚Äînot the President or executive branch agencies.  IM SCREAMING THAT TRUMP MIGHT USE AN EXECUTIVE ORDER TO PASS STIMULUS FUNDS. AND NO ONE IS TELLING HIM ITS ILLEGAL
Republicans and Trump's administration are always asking for bailouts for corporations and what can help line their pockets, instead of making actuals incentives for the normal people.
Prove it. (Kinda like you CLAIMED you had proof on Trump Russia ‚Äúcollusion‚Äù) You are a liar and a disgrace. #resign
Your daily reminder that the polls are wrong because his supposed naysayers aren‚Äôt being truthful and will flinch and vote Trump on Election Day.  #mediawhore
I attribute to my having grown up in Alabama the fact that I believe what your friend asserts. Trump's supporters believe he hates who they hate. They can count on him to treat badly those whom they hate. If I am butting in here, I apologize for my rudeness; sorry.

I also appreciate the juxtaposition of actual footage of migrants forced back into Mexico to wait to ask for asylum under the Migrant Protection Protocols ("Remain in Mexico") and Trump's lies about how they are bad people who look like they should be in the UFC.
I don‚Äôt agree with everything. Guns should be illegal and God has no place in politics. But it‚Äôs anyone but Trump. Voting any different will only help Trump.
Because trump says they‚Äôre immune!!
Trump is a bot
I can‚Äôt wait to see what authority Trump thinks he has that would let him unilaterally order insurance companies to cover preexistig conditions. You know, if Congress hadn‚Äôt already done it a decade ago.
Trump says Asians 'understand exactly' why he uses racist terms for coronavirus
It‚Äôs all we have. He sucks, but he‚Äôs not Trump. Hence the ‚Äúanyone but Trump!‚Äù movement.
Joe Arpaio, who also ran an unsuccessful U.S. Senate campaign in 2018, not long after President Trump pardoned his criminal conviction for disobeying a judge‚Äôs order, has been narrowly defeated in his bid to win back the sheriff‚Äôs post in metro Phoenix.
Thank God     are NOT the elite. Trump came INTO office rich, the others LEAVE office rich. Stop being divided by media. Remember CNN said it would kill you until they DIDN‚ÄôT.
Has anyone considered Trump telling his negotiators not to reach a a deal on unemployment, etc. so that he can be the one that ‚Äúsaved the day‚Äù with an executive order and then blame Dems for not being able to reach a deal?

Pre-existing conditions are CURRENTLY covered. Trump is suing to END pre-existing conditions. But you know that - you‚Äôre just counting on Trump‚Äôs base to be ignorant of that fact.
Now onto refugees, and it's painful to hear their stories and to know what the Trump administration has done to refugee resettlement and the asylum process.  This is one of the major examples of why "'both parties are equally bad" is just such bs.
#BreakingNews Trump planning to sign executive order to requiring employers and employees to pay into a retirement fund for retirees, he is going to call it "social security"
Trump is sneaky with his words...‚Äùcovering pre-existing conditions‚Äù is not the same thing as ‚Äúaffordable coverage for pre-existing conditions‚Äù.   Lets see if that EO states limits on how much more insurance companies can raise premiums for pre-existing condition coverage.
Welcome to Nazi America a la Trump!üëπ
I feel their pain if they feel bad about voting for tRUMP in 2016. We have one chance to make it right again in November. We can do it if we flood the gates. tRUMP must go
Trump taking credit for what Obama already did years ago. He's done that his whole life. Taking credit for other people's work. You people are pathetic.
Are you saying trump is involved too?
So what you are admitting is the Donald Trump does not know what the current law is.  At least you admit it.
If he grows a crap beard, you just know he's been sleeping over at Trump Tower more than is probably appropriate.
Breathe deep.... calm down... now say it....Trump 2020!!!
no, Trump cares only about himself.
What are you doing Joe? Are you waiting till Nov 3rd and say whew I dodged a bullet, now I can retire lol. Move over red rover and let Trump take over. throw the white flag already. How many weeks does it take to pick a running mate. What are the DNC waiting for? Just saying.
Growing up queer in South Carolina, but more recently my partner was attacked by a Trump supporter over an innocent Maltese dog
It's called the Affordable Care Act, aka Obamacare, and it's been the law for ten years. Six weeks ago the Trump Administration filed a brief with the Supreme Court trying to strip Americans of pre-existing protections under Obamacare. This. is. lying.
Literally trump has been saying they should open, the Republicans have been saying that, too. The democrats just said it TODAY after mocking the republicans.
my dream, lady liberty in poor shape trying to protect the people and Trump ripping her clothing to cover the Covid victims to play golf on top. I am going to need PTSD therapy after he is is gone. Illustrators anyone?
Also, if Biden wins (regardless of Trump actually leaving or not, and hopefully he does), we owe a big thanks to... who?  BLACK WOMEN - the most consistent bloc of voters the Dems have. Now's our chance to do right by them.
In #Colorado Kayne West is to be on the ballot for president. The #Republicans fought for this!  Fuck Trump!  He must go we can‚Äôt have another 4 yrs of this shit.

In other words Trump just lied as usual.
Anyone w/even minimal intelligence can see that everything Trump says is really a projection of what he himself says or does. His brain is so small he can't come up with anything else plus it's all he knows. #PeaBrain #TrumpVirus
I agree with that whole heartedly. Appointing people to run the government is the most important job the president does. Even that job Trump has corrupted by surrounding himself with unqualified synchophants.
If only the poor ppl of this country knew how the system works against them when a Republican like tRUMP is in the W.H., he wouldn't be President right now. A lot of them voted against their own interests in 2016.
Ooh. I'm crushed. Your eloquent defense of Trump and your witty takedown of my comments is brilliant. Just brilliant. I shall change my mind immediately.  Feeling a bit triggered, there, snowflake?

It directly tracks my own thinking on this.

This has never been done before *checks notes* unless you count ACA, while Trump has been supporting the GOP push to repeal this for the last 3.5 years.

The difference between Trump &amp; Jose (since apparently Joe is now part Latino), is that Jose takes a knee &amp; Trump stands tall.  Taking a knee is a slave mentality.  The men who liberated the slaves never took a knee.  Kneel for God, but not any man.  Biden is an awkward skintag.
But it makes him look like he cares (which he doesn't). Mnuchin and Meadows set this up, they didn't negotiate in good faith. This was planned all along to make Trump look good.. Who is going to sue to stop this, which members of Congress won't vote to fund this? Good PR for DJT.
President Trump is suspending student loans for now, tricking you, just to get your vote! Only two terms for POTUS. Don't fall for it! You students will still be in depth, with interest! Be wise, He is not on your side! Go with the forgiveness, Democrat! More possible.

Wait I have questions: can Trump do all this via executive order? If so, how sad is it that  can't get this done?
There is no exception for political activity and peaceful protest, and Trump is a fucking fascist fluffing his ego in front of the only people he thinks matter.
You missed the point!  I wasn‚Äôt expecting a Trump rally and some of us need answers about our lives when it comes to unemployment extension.  Another sleepless night while the media gets stuck with their dicks in their hands again.

tRUMP's NEWEST PROPAGANDA AGENDA, JUST FLAT OUT LIE ! ! ! he SAYS PANDEMIC BRIEFING, REALLY JUST ANOTHER üì∑ OP!!! THE BULLSHIT fake*president!#JustTapPicsPlease!!!
Just remembered I had crazy dreams last night! I dreamt  &amp; I had been assigned to review Trump's health records, &amp; we discovered a note that he'd had three heart attacks, &amp; another would be fatal, &amp; we weren't allowed to tell people! Crazy. Trump has no heart!
Yeah you missed the point.  Exercise isn't about being cool it's about self improvement. Trump is allergic , maybe partially because he can see no reason or possibility for improvement.  The guys doesnt read books for goodness sake.
There are just SO many MORE IMPORTANT THINGS in the world today; if that's what their bitch is, they deserve another four years of Trump!
Trump is claiming that he is going to require coverage of pre-existing conditions.   Which is a basic tenet of the ACA.  IT HAS BEEN DONE BEFORE.  IT IS CURRENTLY THE LAW.  He's just taking credit for something Obama did, again. That is really pathetic.
When Trump speaks people listen, when Biden speaks, I go what did he just say? I would call my wife in to watch cause she speaks 5 different languages. I ask her to interpret this. She has no idea what Biden said. LOL. Just saying.
Can he play RW with Krejci? Because there are no living people who can figure it out.
Just once, I wish I could observe the world thru Trump's rose-colored glasses. Oh, wait: That's the problem! He can't see crap because he's not wearing any!
PRESIDENT DONALD FUCKING TRUMP UNLEASHED.
Biden would face the same lack of acceptance Trump did. He will cry or quit
That already exists, under the ACA. Which, so far, is still in force despite Trump's attempts to get rid of it and replace it with...nothing.  Just another thing that Trump the Failure is trying to take credit for. IT ALREADY EXISTS.
Get ready for 4 more years of Trump.
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP UNLEASHED.
Trump said this immediately after being a jerk to a reporter out for not mentioning Iran-in the SAME REPORT. But for *this* question he hasn‚Äôt seen it? All roads lead to Putin....
Would it make a difference if he only dodged it once?  Then later said McCain's not a hero cause he was caught? The point is he's a coward.. Anyway, draft dodging's part of the public record.
O i almost forgot the most famous trump quote about his supporters  "Like fish in a barrel" -Trump
I‚Äôm not sure if Trump understands ethics or constitutional law in its fullest
Contradicting the intelligence community‚Äôs assessment, the president said, ‚ÄúThe last person Russia wants to see in office is Donald Trump.‚Äù  Pressed on the matter, he said: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care what anybody says‚Äù
Never mind Trump increased the defense budget by 10% and they still want more borrowed money!
You can repeat this daily but that doesn‚Äôt make it true. 64 million tests performed, 32K% increase in testing since 3/12, and never before seen progress in vaccines. Sorry but your campaign strategy to destroy Trump by lying about COVID is WEAK!!!
Trump‚Äôs brilliant new healthcare plan is...Obamacare?! ü§£ü§£ü§£ #copolitics #ThanksObama
TRUMP smoked that reporter...lol
160,000 Americans are dead, there's record unemployment, Trump is sandbagging the postal service, relief talks have collapsed, &amp; Combover Caligula is preening in front of a bunch of rich assholes at a golf club he profits from *while President*. #sorrynotsorry about the cursing.
Anyone else feel that words like "beautiful" and "wonderful" and "biggest" and "best" (etc etc etc) are... "Trump" words? Like, I need to expand my vocabulary so I don't sound like that fuckwit.
Wow, President Trump attempting to provide real relief to people while Democrats continue to try and destroy everything in their path.
If you  believe fox news and their lies then you are an uninformed person.  Fox News wants to get trump re-elected so they will say anything.  Fox just sows misinformation.    Trump is desperate because he is losing in the polls
But it wasn‚Äôt. It was Trump.
is talking positive about Kanye. Well I guess whatever black, Democrat-leaning person watches Fox News will vote for him instead of Trump. üôÑ
Shawn do you really think this is a posting contest between Biden and trump? If so...I'll have to straighten you out that trumps accusers fate back to the 80s and Biden had only one.  Post contest done.  Let's go back to ideas...trump has none, doesnt believe in reading.
Having failed to repeal Obamacare, Trump will now create Obamacare by executive order.
I dont know him personally.  But I know who Roy Cohn is and I also know most people in NYC despise Trump for his constant lying, attention grabbing, constant lawsuits and threats of same, and for stiffing contractors.
It is the Trump virus here in the US.
Uh, that's what Obama did.  Until Trump and republicans changed it.  Break it, Fix it then call it a win....
You‚Äôre trump
Thank you so much for not giving air time to Trump in his fake press conference this evening! I'm proud of you for not giving in to his need for attention.
This is where she got her 'talking' points, off a trump video.
what's up with Trump using your version of Live and let sure at his recent Ohio tomfoolery ?
Trump is the only President in my life time that when he says he is going to do something he gets it done. Biden has no chance.
I've got to believe if you called Merkel, Macron,  Trudeau, and nealy any of our allies, they'd all like to see Trump's fat ass out of the Oval Office.
He‚Äôs been on a rant about how Trump intentionally pronounced it that way because that‚Äôs how people in other countries pronounce it and he‚Äôs more cultured than the rest of us ü•¥

for someone that thinks they're so smart you really have no idea how business works do you? I don't have any knowledge of business but even I understand that Trump provided a name, a product and some funding.. and that was probably the extent of his involvement.
You're a racist Joe's social media manager. Thanks for coming out for racist Joe to try and defend him. I heard that if you vote for Trump over Biden you aren't black?ü§î. Wanna clarify that?

I heard an awful story that a BLM protester got life in prison from some tRUMP supporting judge. It's something about him pouring red paint on a bld. Only in tRUMP's America can something  like this happen - if it's true.
Trump has cleaned out the treasury and is about to slash SS and Medicare. He's billed the public for over $3,000,000 in golf rentals and fees against the Secret Service budget. You're laughable.
The asshole Trump is depending on to wreck the Postal Service doubles down and then some
LMAO  finally realizing and admitting how #antifa is a literal domestic terrorist group. All after defending them for months and allowing them to freely roam and terrorize his city while condemning Trump for it. These are your politicians folks.No - the dems/msm will continue their assault on Trump for the next 4 yrs; however, he will have a majority in Senate &amp; House so he will MAGA. Pelosi/Schumer/Schiff - not re-elected.  Deep State In Jail. Replicn Govs. Life is good!
So!?  Did you think Trump wouldn‚Äôt call you out for what you are?  Trump could have said a lot worse about you &amp; we would have loved it. You deserve no respect - you‚Äôre despicable.
I still think every Trump/Putin phone call is about trump tower Moscow. Putin just gets him on the phone and is like ‚ÄúI really think we‚Äôre close to doing this deal this time, I really do‚Äù like he has for 30yrs and that‚Äôs all trump cares about so that‚Äôs all they talk about
News flash. That‚Äôs already covered under the affordable care act. As usual, Obama got there before Trump.
Trump makes promise to unilaterally: -Implement payroll tax holiday until end of the year -Defer student loan payments indefinitely -Extend unemployment benefits until of the year.  -Extend moratorium on evictions  But no specifics &amp; unlikely he can do all this legally.

Trump‚Äôs tax cut was great for the middle class!  You didn‚Äôt write this tweet - you couldn‚Äôt even say it w/o floundering.  You‚Äôre looking more &amp; more ridiculous &amp; Trump is running circles around you. Where‚Äôs Hunter? Why isn‚Äôt Hunter campaigning for you?
It was Trump at his best!  He bitch slapped the enemy press &amp; the audience loved it!  Who needs rallies?  MAGA Landslide On The Way!
Trump, who calls people is African American, should shut up. He has shoved America deep into violent asnd troubling racism. The news needs to still focus on that. Call Joe out and let answer. We all know he is a good man, older generation. For God's sake, alternative is Trump.
Guessing you have stock in companies *other* than Tesla/SpaceX and want the contracts to go to those investments. What have you done for Colorado while licking Trump's boots the last few years? Buh-bye in November, Cory.

The really stupid thing is that there's no way for the postal service to know which ballots are Republican ballots and which are Democratic ballots.  Trump didn't think this through to the end -- AGAIN!
Trump. Is. Corrupt. Period.
Those aren't facts.  It's the way you twisted to make it seem like it was Democratic governors.  Who had the intel and the heads up that this virus was out there?  Who, even today, refuses to tell the truth about the virus?  WHO DO AMERICANS BLAME -- TRUMP!
Is your argument that Trump is Australian or that he merely speaks *like* Australian on occasion?  Hey Dinesh, How do they pronounce "sycophant" and "toady" in London?
She has to repay $10K while Trump is fined $25M and $2M for his university and charity.  Looks like about 3 orders of magnitude difference.  Given that, why are you focused on Tlaib instead of Trump?
Like the Trump Foundation, the NRA leaders will be held accountable for the corruption &amp; grift that has taken advantage of your members. And we're okay seeing the money from your cold, (metaphorically) dead hands.  Buh-bye.
And Trump's removing all oversight, firing IGs, installing Barr as AG, suing to prevent tax/DNA release, pardoning convicted felons like Stone, telling Ghislaine ‚ÄúI wish her well‚Äù doesn't bother you?
Sorry Rick. I have to disagree. Trump really had no clue, no National Plan. The only thing he did was try to blame others.
The one thing Russia can't do is bring 160,000 people back from the dead!  Trump will always have botched the pandemic, and he will continue to try to ignore it, only addressing it in terms of PR for his re-election!
Like Kushner thinking we didn't need to respond to the virus since it was mainly affecting blue states.  Like trumpie governors in red states having to close down again because of CV spikes in RED states.  That's when Trump finally started wearing a mask.
Anyone dumb and arrogant enough to have a huge pool party during a pandemic is possibly dumb enough to support Trump.  My assumption is based on logic.  Funny how you assume rioters are protestors.
She said that before anyone knew anything about the virus. You know this yet you continue this narrative. After we learned more, Trump and his benighted followers still refused to wear masks, still had big pool parties, still went to rallies, Daytona, etc.
Me too!  Dems are capable of doing anything to win.  Trump will win if it‚Äôs fair.
Seriously are Democrats brainwashed it's amazing how they say one thing and do another just like Nancy pelosi blaming Trump for not doing things fast enough on coronavirus but yet it was her dancing around in Chinatown saying to not block people and Joe Biden saying xenophobe wth
I saw my first people at King Soopers wearing Trump masks!  The irony of it all was just so delicious it was hard to take.
Dude, the poorer, less educated, home bound people are Trump's BASE! Only they believe he's a cosmopolitan, educated billionaire.  60% of us know he won't prove it by releasing his transcripts &amp; taxes. We know he's a mobster who lies &amp; bullies to get his way.  #TrumpHoaxedAmerica

Why are you running? While I see from your platform that you are a socialist and environmentalist, you know as well as I do that your race will only impact the votes for Biden, and possibly allow Trump to win. I find that unacceptable.
Give it up, please.  This nursing home narrative is nothing more than a trumpie diversion from Trump's failures.  We all see that, now.
I almost forgot to send you this today. You must be reminded that your complete and udder incompetence and abuse of power is bullshit!!! I hope you get sued out of office. And quit blaming President Trump for you mistakes!!! #wrongforcolorado
I suspect Trump is well aware of DNA's persuasive potential.  I suspect he's had personal encounters with it in the past.  Anyone with that many NDAs and lawsuits must have!

Interesting take.  And all along I had thought it was God's punishment for electing Trump.
This is the whole reason for seperation between Church &amp; State. So no candidate can claim to be "Gods chosen candidate". Trump is trying to anoint himself as such because you may dislike him, but a vote for him is a vote for God...
Been hearing this for four years. Just like building the wall, lowering prescription costs, coronavirus disappearing.....  Trump is full of shit and you eat it up.
You can't be happy if you worship money and power above all.  Just look at Trump; a picture of misery.

Trump's religious when it comes to his little, tiny eternity and his minuscule immortal soul.  He'll accept Jesus if that means he can get into Heaven.  He's terrified of Hell.  Other than that he doesn't have much use for religion.
Force of nature? What BS. Trump is more like a force against nature.  It'll be interesting to watch #FoxNews be buried in news cycles after the #BidenLandslide because we won't care what they say since it's all #FakeNews.
He can't. State charges do not operate under same guidelines as the DOJ. They CAN indict a sitting president and there is no commutation or pardon under these laws. Buh bye Jabba the Trump!

Trump was more interested in protecting Confederate statues than protecting Americans from COVID-19.
It does as long as a Trump enabling sycophant is left in office. At this point I'm so disgusted with the  that I'll never #vote Republican again. They, along with #Trump have failed America.
This is the strongest argument for showing that Trump is manipulating weak-minded religious people for support. The Bible itself says that we should be wise as serpents and harmless as doves. Boy do they have that backwards.

Agree.  I do think there is a preponderance of evidence.   Nothing has been proven beyond a reasonable doubt to my knowledge, but with so many allegations of sexual assault against Trump, a preponderance requires a 50% chance any is true.  I think that condition is met.
Thank you Letitia James! All of you NRA supporters put money right in LaPierre's pocket while thinking he cared about your gun rights. The same way Trump is taking advantage of you, but you don't learn.
Skeptical your trump supporting roommate really exists (üòâ), but I‚Äôll follow you when I get the ability to follow again anyhow. üòÇ
This is the most deplorable thing I have ever heard. Jabba the Trump is DIRECTLY responsible for this. He is despicable beyond belief.
I‚Äôd like to claim the reward.  I‚Äôll name Brad Parscale and Donald J Trump as suspects.  #ConsequencesForTrump
Stupidly self-destructive: "Trump to order government to buy certain drugs solely from U.S. factories, setting up major shakeup for industry":
Fools, Damn Fools and Donald Trump   Trump is circling the drain, and that giant flushing sound comes from members of his own party pulling the chain.
No.  Trump supporters don't blame Trump for what Dems do
Trump‚Äôs Bank Was Subpoenaed by N.Y. Prosecutors in Criminal Inquiry
Come on folks  it's free money.  The Trump's have a no limit taxpayer credit card thanks to a righteous band of "fiscal conservatives" aka Republicans.
I would have a great party üéâü•≥and everyone not for Trump is invited üåπüíã
Paul Manafort chose Pence when Paul was Trump's campaign manager.   There's only one reason Manafort would do that.  Pence is compromised and they can control him.  I guess there's some things Mother doesn't know.
A Reagan/Bush Republican is an entirely different breed from a Trump Republican.
Someone please explain this to me like I‚Äôm a 5 year old:  How does giving $ to USPS help secure vote by mail... when there‚Äôs a Trump flunkie currently in charge and, no doubt, his one assignment is to do everything he can to screw with vote by mail‚ÅâÔ∏è
Dear Republican party leaders, your complete failure to lead and your dedication to Trump over everything that is good, decent, and once American, has created this health crisis and the tearing down of American ideals in the process.
Instagram Displayed Negative Related Hashtags For Biden, But Hid Them For Trump  via
The MSM/Left never tires of feigning outrage over everything Trump does or says, no matter how trivial.  Even his non-supporters must be tired of the constant barrage against him. They look so foolish &amp; desperate.  Maddow is one of the worst-she‚Äôs looked stupid so many times.
what wii prevent Trump from selling all of our Natl Security info to Putin after he loses in Nov? If he hasn‚Äôt done so already? Another Snowden or TrumpDump?
My goddaughter heard trump wanted to delete TikTok from the US so she changed her phones setting to living in CANADA ü§£ü§£ü§£
Personally speaking I'm depressed because so many people like you believe Trump's lies.  Obamagate is total BS.
You might get blocked by tRump?! #keeppouring #haveadrinktheysaid
For all I know, Putin developed COVID-19, introduced it to China and the world to destroy us, and told Trump to ignore it. Why else would Trump say ‚Äúit will go away someday‚Äù? Why would he tout ineffective treatments? Why would Trump call Putin so many times in March and April?

Trump is doing everything in his power to save the country against terrible odds &amp; Evil that viciously hates him &amp; America. There‚Äôs  nothing they won‚Äôt try to destroy him.  He has to win or America is no more.  We must unite &amp; fight w/&amp; for him.

Trump loves this country so much.  I don‚Äôt believe anyone else could take the constant hate &amp; demonization he gets; criticized every time he opens his mouth.  It never stops &amp; he keeps going - he had a good life too.  I believe he will someday be revered-no one tougher.
Nope. His.
This guy looks in the mirror, slathers on orange and says "All better." If it wasn't for the fact that Mary Trump describes Donnie's mother coming to America as a 1940's version of Melanie, I would swear his mother and father were siblings. The hubris of this man to be cocky.
do you consider these people who would vote for Trump racist?
Trump. Promise?üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
Thank our government for having no leadership. It‚Äôs a Banana Republic with the Republicans in charge! Exploding debt, 0 National leadership DURING A PANDEMIC, Trump who is being INVESTIGATED by state AND federal prosecutors. Thank the 137,000,000 people who support this ass!
Fox News, "My view is that schools should be open," Trump said.¬†‚ÄúIf you look at children, children are almost ‚Äî and I would almost say definitely ‚Äî but almost immune from this disease.‚Äù He added that children have "much stronger immune systems" and "just don't have a problem."
I heard that demon semen is the reason for women getting ovaries. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs true, but Donald Trump Jr promoted the doctor that claims this so I doubt it‚Äôs false.
I‚Äôm not that curious/interested in who your choice for VP is - you will never be elected. No one  on your List is capable of being president &amp; you definitely aren‚Äôt.  We‚Äôre in good hands w/Trump for 4 more yrs. No one cares who the dem VP nominee will be.
I agree with you Jocelyn trump is the biggest racist prejudice hypocrite hitler wannabe president this country has. Cause of him the coronavirus has gotten worse that retarded piece of shit. Is so goddamn stupid. I am surprised no one has taken him out yet. He deserves prison
I agree with you 100%. Trump is the biggest racist hypocrite bastard. That dumb shit can‚Äôt put a sentence together without it being a lie. This country has hitler as president. That retarded asshole needs to be locked up for the rest of his life. Cause him the virus is everywhere
There goes President Trump trying to kill Americans again.  So how much do you think he owes Putin?
Hi Wayne. Is Jonathan of Trump interview fame any relation?
New Norm in Trump Country
Trump's account is locked until he deletes a BS tweet about kids being immune to COVID.   It's about fucking time.
why isn‚Äôt it news when Republicans working for Trump are trying to exploit Kanye West‚Äôs mental illness?  Trying to put him on the Colorado ballot?   What is wrong with people?   Don‚Äôt you want to know?
The Kardashians and Donald Trump are taking advantage of a mentally ill man.  How despicable can they be?
no debates until Trump releases his tax returns, and his Huuuuge HealthCare plan.
Right? When I see anything in support of Trump, the first thing I think is that person is an idiot!
Trump owns an interest in the pipeline and he owns the judge. Is the decision a surprise to anyone?
People a few houses down just put a Trump/Pence sign in their front yard.  They also belong to a biker club called BARI (Bikers against radical Islam), so we're pretty sure they're racists!
Trump tried to cut COVID-19 funding to everyone but Texas and Florida ‚Äî now lawmakers are demanding answers -   needs to be impeached again.
I guess POC are just supposed to vote for him because of the color of his skin?  That way Biden would lose and Trump would win.  Trump's not fooling anyone and it's not going to work!
Poor Michelle - Trump is causing her to be depressed &amp; have low-energy! Get a grip!  There are Americans right now w/o jobs/businesses/homes/$. Trump beat your corrupt husband &amp; ur constant demonizing of him isgetting old.Thank God now for a prez &amp; 1st Lady that love this country
He should say, "I haven't had a doctor recommend that test for dementia to me!"    Trump thinks it's an IQ test!
They honestly think that POC will just vote for Kanye because of the color of his skin!  They're not dumb, like Trump supporters!
Thanks for the Truth!  We need more courageous celebrities to speak up about what is happening  w/the destruction of our country as we know it, as the democrats totally deny &amp; ignore.   If you hate Trump believe me you will hate Socialism/Marxism more.
You state all of the reasons why people should vote for Trump.  Great work Michael
You just mad that most celebrities don‚Äôt fuck with trump
To my Twitter friends who might STILL be Trump loyalists... we luv ya, guys, but SERIOUSLY, can you STILL vote for this man? Consider his total DISREGARD for the safety of you &amp; your LOVED ONES?  This DOLT only wants to enrich himself.  Screw our kids?
Of course, for this to occur Trump would have to overtake Biden in (at least) four places he's currently losing: PA, FL, ME-02, and NE-02. But it's true that this map is plausible.
We must all register to get our mail-in ballot, then do our best to turn it in personally to an official &amp; well guarded drop-box. That‚Äôs the only way to not stand in line for hours and secure that our votes count. We have absolute power to counter all of Trump‚Äôs I‚Äôll intentions
He sure the fuck has not. tRump has done nothing for anyone except himself and Putin.
The easiest way to counter Trump is to hold a mirror to his comments because they are always about projection, especially when they are lies.
Cults always have great enthusiasm for their dear leader. Unfortunately for trump, his cult is shrinking.
I've been referring to attendees of Trump rallies, and now school children, as weaponized w/ the #COVID19 virus to infect family &amp; friends. This will create more chaos going into the election, which Putin wants.
Will NEVER vote republican again due to Trump and the Republican Party turning their back on decency and our constitution. Only voted for the D's in the 2016 election. Will do the same in 2020. They make me ill to see what they stand for now. #notarepublicananymore
CNN To Trump: Jim Acosta Talks To Covid-19 Task Force ‚ÄòMore Than You Do #Biden2020
I agree. No need for any debates.  has all the leverage. With Trump requesting conservative moderators and still no tax returns, Joe can demand tax returns and moderators he wants. Otherwise, no debates to show Trump  slinging lies and bull shit all over the stage.
I'm here to defeat Trump and help lift Biden to the Presidency. #Biden2020  #NoComradesUnder1k
Who in God's green earth thinks that debating Biden will help Trump?  The man tanked in an interview with Jonathan Swan -- he's going to dominate Joe Biden?  Like him or not, Biden knows his shit!  Trump -- not so much!
He‚Äôs sane, he‚Äôs smart, he‚Äôll trust experts and be inclusive. It won‚Äôt be trump family crookery. I can‚Äôt wait.
Either does Trump....lol watching the deficit go up and up and up!
All Republicans leaders know how to do is project their own miserable failings onto Democrats. Who politicized COVID-19? Trump. Who politicized wearing masks? Trump. Who doesn't care if Americans die? Trump. Who supports Trump at every lying turn? Republicans.
Congress demands Trump administration release its vaccine-distribution plan
She testified under oath. Trump can‚Äôt because he lies as he breathes.
Trump can't even read tbh
I agree. As an Independent voter, I don't need to hear about Trump's plans. He'll either be lying or... well, he'll just be lying because he only has plans that service Putin's agenda &amp; his boss don't want him sharing those out loud.  I suggest Joe #Biden hold virtual town halls.
Love these fellow veterans speaking out against trump. We know how to identify an enemy, whether it‚Äôs foreign or domestic.
I think it‚Äôs shameful that Trump would not allow any of the Democratic co-sponsors to attend the bill signing.   And you did nothing to call that out.   Bipartisan, my foot.
I don‚Äôt care if Biden is in cognitive decline. He could spend the next 4 years in diapers drooling on himself and still do a far better job than trump.
And he‚Äôs still beating trumpüòÇ

President Trump Fires 'Deep-Swamp' Officials - Donald Says They "Betrayed American Workers" By Outsourcing Jobs ‚Å¶ - BOOM YOU‚ÄôRE #FIRED!!!
But the President isn't making a speech, Donald Trump is accepting the nomination as the Republican candidate for President.  That is, by the very definition, political campaigning.
Throw all the numbers you want, that doesn't make us expendable. Sure, it would shake things up but the void will be filled. At the rate Trump and his cabal are running things, we could very likely see it.  Are you getting the point?
These events are not news conferences. They are FREE Trump re-election pressers. He gets exposure &amp; sound bites for #FoxNews to share with Trump's base.  Please stop reporting on them as news conferences.
These are not news conferences. The are FREE Trump ads for his re-election. He gets free exposure to a mass audience while generating sound bites for #FoxNews to push to The Base.
Of all the treasonous crimes committed by Trump, this could be the largest to date.
They have nothing better to do than do nasty tweets like their puppet master Trump!üíãüåπ
Trump makes decisions based on knowing #RightFromWrong. The problem is he only does what is wrong. #BadPresident
The President is exempt, but not White House employees.  So unless Trump is going to set up the podium, camera, etc. himself....
Trump and his supporters own this.
Michelle realizes Joe Biden looks more inept by the day &amp; won‚Äôt be elected &amp; Her husband was the most corrupt president  ever.  But it‚Äôs so much easier to blame Trump bc she knows he will win in Nov &amp; lead us for 4 more more yrs.
Let's not forget that Fusion GPS was hired by the GOP.   After Trump won the nomination the GOP dropped Fusion and they were picked up by Democrats.  Let us also not forget that the Mueller report explicitly called out several cases of "collusion" and did not exonerate Trump.
Ha!!! This is a must!! President Trump took one back when the Democrats said he wasn‚Äôt fit!! Well Okd Joe you ain‚Äôt fit. You are a Puppet in a Liberal Socialist Marxist run party
America is trying. Maybe you shld get the virus to believe it‚Äôs real. People are afraid and trump doing nothing to build trust. You either.
If you are black and Hispanic or of any other origin. Don't fool yourself they don't care about you either. And if you walk and stand with Donald Trump you're a fool.
Biden should most definitely debate trump. Even if it was a video zoom type event. If Biden says no, trump will run with that.

If trump got COVID-19 and was in the hospital on a ventilator what would be your response?
In today's news, Fuck Joe Biden.
Let me guess, one of Trump's cabinet members has a son or daughter on the SEC?  I'm just spit balling.
Christine, it‚Äôs unfortunate that Trump learned so much from Clinton and Biden, but if what you say about Trump is true, then they taught him well. He would have learned from the best.
He sounds more coherent than Trump.  Low bar, I agree.  You do do know he stammers, right?  So it's not surprising he stumbled over 'fitness' and if you're trying to make him look bad on that basis you have sunk pretty low.  No surprise, there.
My border collie is literally smarter than the Trump supporters who believe this crap. I‚Äôd rather see her vote count ü§£

Mr. President Trump you need to restate that fake news is the enemy of all people
Politically estranged Catholic here. If God was punishing us during Obama, as evangelists said, then why isn't He showering us with rainbows &amp; unicorns under Trump? There's a big difference between faith and stupidity.
Since when did Jabba the Trump care about the law, any law?
No problem. Jabba the Trump has a way of scrambling anyone's brains. You did a superior job in that interview.
Not sure why Trump is so interested in this unless he is expecting to lose in November. Mail in ballots and absentee ballots are the same thing and are not subject to computer hacking.
This is pure fucking ignorance right here. Apparently I‚Äôm a racist for supporting Trump. Go ahead and believe what you want with that pea sized brain of yours. Just remember the Dems don‚Äôt give a shit about you and are using all of you as pawns
An entire group of mental health professionals came out early on to claim he was unfit! Where did you learn professional ethics? Trump U?
As the election nears, we can expect all of Trump‚Äôs ‚ÄúGreatest Hits‚Äù to appear: the emails, Obama, name calling. Just yawn and ignore.
Don‚Äôt try and argue with these clowns. If you don‚Äôt like what they like then your a racist. If you support Trump your a racist. People will continue to play that race card to force their agenda down tour throat
Trump has always shown what a rotten, selfish jerk he is. All it took was a 24x7, dedicated propaganda system (right-wing media), millions upon millions of dollars from donors, and an incredibly gullible republican base to prop him up. Kind of a high maintenance guy, very needy.
Jeremy asked journalists to investigate his Russian-hacked trade documents to see whether there was any truth in his absurd conspiracy that the Tories want to sell the NHS to Trump. We did investigate, and the documents said nothing of the sort
I don't believe kids have a magic genome that protects them from the virus. I do believe we isolated and protected them. I do believe reopening the schools prematurely will  cause many of our children to die. I do believe Trump knows that &amp; doesn't care. Your child or your party?
I‚Äôm in the same boat so I very much feel you.‚ù§Ô∏è Been fighting Stage 4 bowel cancer for 7.5 years. I really want to be here to see trump lose hugely and do my bit by voting for Joe. I‚Äôm sending you all my love and healing consciousness.  I‚Äôm here if you ever need someone to listen

He called trump a bloviated ignoramus
The Netflix series "Immigration Nation" is a must watch for every adult American.  It should cause each one of us to feel shame and endeavor to right the wrongs against immigrants committed by the Trump administration.
Trump believes testing simply uncovered more cases and wanted to suppress it.  We don‚Äôt have any nationally orchestrated testing program.  Details on progress on this front would be appreciated at press briefings.
I‚Äôm actually not a Trump supporter.
‚ÄúManuals, what manuals? ‚ÄúBooks, what books?‚Äù   Omg. Best Trump interview ever.
When trump becomes a Muslim everyone will finally shut the fuck up
That trump is worse than I could have imagined!
When are you going to address the Trump attack on our country?
"Donald Trump is part of a secret conspiracy to destroy the Republican Party for the next decade" is a lot more plausible that the Q nonsense.
I think Trump has had such a bad year that it'd take a Kamala Harris tier pick to blow it for Biden.
remembering how Joe Kennedy, an adult, claimed he ‚Äúaccidentally‚Äù voted yes on a bill that gave Trump access to more nuclear weapons. üôÑ  (p.s. this was when he began painting himself as a progressive to try &amp; unseat Sen. Markey, who is truly leftist. Joe‚Äôs opposed to cannabis.)
Oh happy day. The trump Kiss of defeat
I was calling Trump ‚Äúa twit‚Äù.  My mistake.
I have no idea how they can argue on behalf of Trump, especially after last night's interview. They are rather special.
Give Trump time. He's still trying to figure out how to spell Lebanon.
You'll believe anything if you think Dems are trying to make Trump look bad. Trump does that all by himself. We just call him out on his nonsense while you turn a blind eye.
#ImmigrationNation watch this show before pussy Trump removes it from Netflix
This fucking guy ... Trump needs to just have a speaker with him at all times the shit coming out his mouth sometimes ...
So, you wouldn‚Äôt invite Senator Bennett to the bill signing of the Great American Outdoor‚Äôs Act he co-sponsored?  Both of you are such punks, and will be one termers come November.   will take you out Cory.   you Trump.
Reporters that want to be respected and interview high ranking officials should be courteous and call people by their title is what he's saying. That is just how all jobs are. It's just respect no matter the position or job. Trump doesn't earn that though.
It makes me happy to see that they are expressing themselves.   There are bigger things for you to be worrying about Mr Trump then those players.
Shouldn‚Äôt a Jedi mind trick work on Trump???  He‚Äôs so Weak Minded!!No - the dems/msm will continue their assault on Trump for the next 4 yrs; however, he will have a majority in Senate &amp; House so he will MAGA. Pelosi/Schumer/Schiff - not re-elected.  Deep State In Jail. Replicn Govs. Life is good!
No, he didn't apologize, he doubled down. Trump doesn't need to apologize as it is, because he's not racist. Joe Biden actually believes these racist things -- because he's always having to apologise for them, ie: admission of guilt.
Chuck Schumer Wants To Ban TikTok Before Trump Does!  via
So!?  Did you think Trump wouldn‚Äôt call you out for what you are?  Trump could have said a lot worse about you &amp; we would have loved it. You deserve no respect - you‚Äôre despicable.
Trump says. "It is what it is." Haha Not funny!
Hillary won the popular vote by 2/3.5 million votes. It‚Äòs the electoral college that chooses. And they came out saying they can choose anyone they want regardless. Which is how Trump won.
This shit right here should be illegal, I don't listen to his music and if I did I would stop after this. It's a damn shame the Trump campaign would use a person that suffers with mental health issues to help win their election, but I'm not shocked.
Why does Trump think people care about him watching sports or not lol   Like a lot of people wouldn‚Äôt cared if you died fr so
Trump has a habit of destroying something, then rebuilding it and expecting to get praised for doing so.
If you want to really learn about corruption in politics I have two words for you. Trump's inauguration.
I find it ironic that Fox pushes stories about CNBC ignoring Bill Clinton's (a FORMER SCUMBAG PRESIDENT) ties but ignores Trump's (a CURRENT SCUMBAG PRESIDENT) ties.

Trump‚Äôs campaign isn‚Äôt even trying to hide it or lie about it this time.

An STD will be named for Trump.
Day 149: . shared on the air earlier today that 1,000 Americans per day are dying from #COVID19! What is the US President doing? Banning a social media app.    Globally:  Total cases:19,378,036 Deaths:721,324  US: Total cases: 4,941,755  Deaths:161,356
Golfing and lying. What else is new with trump?
Trump is gaining ground on defeating our ability to Vote by Mail in November.  DeJoy has got to go!
Allan Lichtman has predicted every winner of every presidential election since 1984 - including Donald Trump's victory in 2016.   With the 2020 presidential election now less than three months away, he has weighed in on this year‚Äôs race.
Who is trump kidding? He is suing against ACA which protects people with preexisting medical conditions in our courts right now. WTF?
Sorry lass but when I think of this country and the strain another four years of Trump will put it under, yeah he‚Äôs gotta go. But kudos to you for the emotional appeal üòâ
Trump is planning to issue an executive order to mandate something that is already mandated by law... There I fixed your headline
Baby, if you think Trump gives a shit about you, well, I‚Äôve got a bridge to sell you.
Not remotely close.  We are all suffering from Trump induced anxiety and depression.  Exhausted.
Don't you get it people??? This is exactly what #Trump wants...People protest, No Masks, people get sick and die...Then whats Left are #Trumps anti-Christ White supremacy foot soldiers to do his bidding...#Trump wants to be a dictator so bad, he licks his Own Butt!!!

Griffin‚Äôs anti-mask efforts and social media postings have also prompted a judge in family court to take action against him just this past week.
Couy Griffin made national news recently after he made a video with ‚Äúgo back to Africa‚Äù comments while complaining about NFL players kneeling. He claims he‚Äôs not a racist.
Exactly! You can‚Äôt make me miss that administration, even by comparing them to Trump. Maybe their shit didn‚Äôt stink as much as Trumps; but it‚Äôs still smelly shit üí©
If you‚Äôre wondering, it‚Äôs probably conceivable. For me it doesn‚Äôt come instantaneously, but for example: the night trump was elected, I said to my wife ‚ÄúI hope the Russians didn‚Äôt have anything to do with this.‚Äù
Don‚Äôt let it depend on his Veep pick. We have to defeat trump. Vote Biden and whomever he picks.
I sat static at approximately 300 followers for a couple of years and it wasn't until this year between the Covid19 and the #BLM Movement that I felt I needed to unify with others against Trump, so I started picking up followers at that point.
Trump be like ‚ÄúI‚Äôm gonna repeal Obamacare but ensure they do all the same things and call it Trumpcare‚Äù
I'm not saying #JoeBiden is the answer, but anybody is infinitely better than #Trump...in fact I would vote for this Big Steaming Pile of Shit before EVER voting for #Trump again!!!...I'm Not Joking!!!
Trump is the leader of a cult. Where is the koolaid?
Trump has been caught lying 15000 times. Kinda like the 160k people he killed cause he lied about the virus. Do you like clean water? Would you like air like China? Good old trump has already begun
how can u say this is not a good president?  unemployment thru the new year  #TennesseeValleyAuthority CEo was getting 8 million a year, laid off everyone, made them train they (cheaper, foreign) replacements- trump was like, ‚Äúhell no‚Äù   . üå©Ô∏èLoveU Sir

President Trump signing a major executive order, for health insurance companies to cover pre-existing conditions! Why didn‚Äôt President Obama think of that? Oh wait, it‚Äôs already in the affordable care act!
I‚Äôve had two people tell me that Beyonc√© stans are like Trump supporters and that is so WILDLY disrespectful
"Trump says he plans on making insurers cover pre-existing conditions ‚Äî a protection which already exists under Obamacare"
Wow...1984 a bit late: just in time for 2024? Police state rising unless we can dislodge Trump et al from the WH!!üò°üò°üò°
trump tells you what to think, say, and do. And like all cult members you do exactly what he wants.
Self trepanning.  Trump say it kills #COVID__19.  #ThingsMorePopularThanTrump
News flash. That‚Äôs already covered under the affordable care act. As usual, Obama got there before Trump.
Trump makes promise to unilaterally: -Implement payroll tax holiday until end of the year -Defer student loan payments indefinitely -Extend unemployment benefits until of the year.  -Extend moratorium on evictions  But no specifics &amp; unlikely he can do all this legally.
The Dems will exploit the Chinese Virus for political purposes until November 3 when President Trump wins the election. Afterward, they‚Äôll move on to the next fantasy designed to remove a President who can‚Äôt be bought, which is what the Dems, RINOs and Deep State hate about him.
Wow wtf is this guy? He is starting to show symptoms. Of Trump syndrome. Where is the vaccine for this?
You are WRONG.  People who pay cash (i.e. no other coverage) pay the most. The ACA established protection for pre-existing conditions. Trump and his congressional followers have tried repeatedly to repeal these protections. McCain put country over party.
This time next year Donald Trump could be sitting in jail
That‚Äôs also not a law, but an executive order, so he can rescind it at any time... Related: payroll tax cuts will be later used as a pretext to cut SS and Medicare benefits. Oh - and Kanye has sold out to Trump...
That‚Äôs a pretty old clipping you‚Äôve got there. Do you really want to go tit for tat between Biden and Trump? Why didn‚Äôt Trump attention the memorial for John Lewis? Why does Trump inspire nazis to march in the streets with torches?
Obamacare was a scam. They made it with Blackfoot deals with big pharmaceutical and insurance lobbyists. Trump‚Äôs making sure the good part is kept, something they could have done without the scam but didn‚Äôt.
Trump Is Not Well #TrumpIsNotWell
Are you dumb axios or do you not realize Obamacare is a failure, leaving more still uninsured than it covers while jacking up costs? It needs to be repealed but Trump is keeping one of the only good things from it.

I‚Äôm not even a Trump fan, but Jesus Christ. Has it occurred to anyone that not all plans cover pre-existing conditions and the media claims he wants to take what coverage there is away 24/7? Of course not. Maybe he felt the need to put an end to that lie.

How many lost due to your mishandling of the tRump virus???
I love that Trump called out the Dems especially Nervous Nancy on the relief package. It is amazing that these Liberats are starting to go a little right cause they know they are in deep trouble come Nov. Where is Hunter? Just saying. We will not see any debates, or a VP pick.
The framers were unanimous that Congress, as the representatives of the people, should be in control of public funds‚Äînot the President or executive branch agencies.  IM SCREAMING THAT TRUMP MIGHT USE AN EXECUTIVE ORDER TO PASS STIMULUS FUNDS. AND NO ONE IS TELLING HIM ITS ILLEGAL
Republicans and Trump's administration are always asking for bailouts for corporations and what can help line their pockets, instead of making actuals incentives for the normal people.

I also appreciate the juxtaposition of actual footage of migrants forced back into Mexico to wait to ask for asylum under the Migrant Protection Protocols ("Remain in Mexico") and Trump's lies about how they are bad people who look like they should be in the UFC.
The great divider is the orange clown sitting in the White House right now. What caused division while Obama was in office is white people who couldn‚Äôt accept &amp; resented the fact that a black man was elected president. One of those people was the birther trump. No surprise there.
I don‚Äôt agree with everything. Guns should be illegal and God has no place in politics. But it‚Äôs anyone but Trump. Voting any different will only help Trump.
Because trump says they‚Äôre immune!!
Trump is a bot
I can‚Äôt wait to see what authority Trump thinks he has that would let him unilaterally order insurance companies to cover preexistig conditions. You know, if Congress hadn‚Äôt already done it a decade ago.
Trump says Asians 'understand exactly' why he uses racist terms for coronavirus
It‚Äôs all we have. He sucks, but he‚Äôs not Trump. Hence the ‚Äúanyone but Trump!‚Äù movement.
Joe Arpaio, who also ran an unsuccessful U.S. Senate campaign in 2018, not long after President Trump pardoned his criminal conviction for disobeying a judge‚Äôs order, has been narrowly defeated in his bid to win back the sheriff‚Äôs post in metro Phoenix.
Because god loves liars, cheaters, corrupt criminals, rascist, creeps like Donald Trump. Horrible
Thank God     are NOT the elite. Trump came INTO office rich, the others LEAVE office rich. Stop being divided by media. Remember CNN said it would kill you until they DIDN‚ÄôT.

Pre-existing conditions are CURRENTLY covered. Trump is suing to END pre-existing conditions. But you know that - you‚Äôre just counting on Trump‚Äôs base to be ignorant of that fact.
Now onto refugees, and it's painful to hear their stories and to know what the Trump administration has done to refugee resettlement and the asylum process.  This is one of the major examples of why "'both parties are equally bad" is just such bs.
#BreakingNews Trump planning to sign executive order to requiring employers and employees to pay into a retirement fund for retirees, he is going to call it "social security"
Trump is sneaky with his words...‚Äùcovering pre-existing conditions‚Äù is not the same thing as ‚Äúaffordable coverage for pre-existing conditions‚Äù.   Lets see if that EO states limits on how much more insurance companies can raise premiums for pre-existing condition coverage.

It's called the Affordable Care Act, aka Obamacare, and it's been the law for ten years. Six weeks ago the Trump Administration filed a brief with the Supreme Court trying to strip Americans of pre-existing protections under Obamacare. This. is. lying.
Literally trump has been saying they should open, the Republicans have been saying that, too. The democrats just said it TODAY after mocking the republicans.
my dream, lady liberty in poor shape trying to protect the people and Trump ripping her clothing to cover the Covid victims to play golf on top. I am going to need PTSD therapy after he is is gone. Illustrators anyone?
Also, if Biden wins (regardless of Trump actually leaving or not, and hopefully he does), we owe a big thanks to... who?  BLACK WOMEN - the most consistent bloc of voters the Dems have. Now's our chance to do right by them.

He can‚Äôt breathe in a mask bc he‚Äôs exhausted from kissing Trump‚Äôs butt
I agree with that whole heartedly. Appointing people to run the government is the most important job the president does. Even that job Trump has corrupted by surrounding himself with unqualified synchophants.
If only the poor ppl of this country knew how the system works against them when a Republican like tRUMP is in the W.H., he wouldn't be President right now. A lot of them voted against their own interests in 2016.

Lindsey, we know better. It's about money for F-35's, the federal building across from the Trump hotel &amp; White House renovations, and no unemployment benefits for the poor guys that need it. Ya fkn piker.

The difference between Trump &amp; Jose (since apparently Joe is now part Latino), is that Jose takes a knee &amp; Trump stands tall.  Taking a knee is a slave mentality.  The men who liberated the slaves never took a knee.  Kneel for God, but not any man.  Biden is an awkward skintag.
But it makes him look like he cares (which he doesn't). Mnuchin and Meadows set this up, they didn't negotiate in good faith. This was planned all along to make Trump look good.. Who is going to sue to stop this, which members of Congress won't vote to fund this? Good PR for DJT.

Trump has abdicated millions of acres of public lands to private entities. He must be stopped.
An inside look at the legal battles that lawyers for the American Civil Liberties Union are facing during the Trump administration.  Watch THE FIGHT:
I‚Äôll only use Reels if trump threatens to ban it
Why didn't the press walk out on Trump's obviously orchestrated "press conference?" Why are they sitting there allowing them to be humiliated with cameras rolling? Is there a purpose to this? Are we going to learn anything that we don't already know about Trump?
The only threat we have to the American ppl is Trump's America and the republicans view for America. This is all happening under the republicans watch. Not Democrats. Dems have no choice but to fight back to keep civil peace and democracy right.
So the unemployed will get a check from a trump executive order, but us Americans who have either took a pay cut or changed jobs to a lower salary won't get help. On top of that we're still getting taxed...you Democrats have no soul and you just lost the election with this.
The huckster can't lose.... if Dems don't sign he blames them,if they do sign,  its a win for Trump. This thing is fixed 6 ways to hell.
Trump‚Äôs best day ever.
Is this the new plan? Trump is gonna issue EOs for things that have already happened, then try to take credit?   Easier than work, I guess.
Hey Mr Biden. We can‚Äôt let trump do ANYTHING else. I‚Äôve contributed to your campaign tonight so you can overturn all the horrendous, inane policies like this one and so many others. It‚Äôs imperative you persevere! #BlueWave2020
Ya Obamacare already covers preexisting conditions, Libs are jumping all over this. BUT, when was the last time a Republican President Extended/wanted to expand, healthcare in this country? Maybe Trump'll see he needs to go further. Biden wont consider anything beyond statusquo.
Wait I have questions: can Trump do all this via executive order? If so, how sad is it that  can't get this done?
There is no exception for political activity and peaceful protest, and Trump is a fucking fascist fluffing his ego in front of the only people he thinks matter.
You missed the point!  I wasn‚Äôt expecting a Trump rally and some of us need answers about our lives when it comes to unemployment extension.  Another sleepless night while the media gets stuck with their dicks in their hands again.
Then why did Trump correct himself the second time he said it?
JUST IN: President Donald Trump said during a last-minute news conference Friday that he is ready to sign an executive order that will offer unemployment supplements, eviction protection, and a payroll tax holiday through the end of the year.
Trump was really my first major awareness of wealthy white trailer trash and his deplorables have just amplified its existence.  Money doesn't buy class.
Maybe that should be: It's August 7th, and President Trump still doesn‚Äôt WANT‚ùóÔ∏èan adequate national testing strategy.
. did it first and better. It‚Äôs called the Affordable Care Act - the law that Trump is fighting to overturn via the Supreme Court.
Trump taking credit for something someone else did. Again.
While the POTUS goes golfing, &amp; is attempting to ban TikTok, the US once again recorded 2000 deaths in a single day. The most since May. Trump &amp; Republicans have royally screwed the pooch on this pandemic and their response (or lack there of). Fuck them &amp; their pro-life bullshit.
Wait til you hear how President Trump treated his holy union with all three of his wives. It's a doozy.
WTAF?...holy sh*t....the ship that caused the explosion in Beirut was Russian...and now a ship named after Trump has 3 times the explosives is pulling into Ukraine....JFC....
U.S. Intelligence: GOP Is Accepting Russian Help for Trump

Trump and his administration also botched the nation‚Äôs testing rollout, played down the disease, offered false assurances and bogus remedies, discouraged mask wearing, pushed the economy to reopen prematurely, concealed data, and disparaged testing.

I love Trump‚Äôs honesty, don‚Äôt you?
Our suffering for Trump‚Äôs failures is just beginning. We have sacrificed half a year, $3 trillion of our treasure and 157,000 lives ‚Äî and it has been squandered by one man‚Äôs incompetence.
Every message Biden makes, which are few, is followed up by some kind of explanation or apology. Trash what Trump says all you want, but at least he backs his words with actions and not apologies.   Same can't be said for Biden who only backs everything he says with excuses.

Trump, who calls people is African American, should shut up. He has shoved America deep into violent asnd troubling racism. The news needs to still focus on that. Call Joe out and let answer. We all know he is a good man, older generation. For God's sake, alternative is Trump.
I find the idea to be ridiculous...at this point in time....if you would vote for Kanye...you would vote for Trump....I think this will backfire and actually pull votes from Trump...

Just remembered I had crazy dreams last night! I dreamt  &amp; I had been assigned to review Trump's health records, &amp; we discovered a note that he'd had three heart attacks, &amp; another would be fatal, &amp; we weren't allowed to tell people! Crazy. Trump has no heart!
Yeah you missed the point.  Exercise isn't about being cool it's about self improvement. Trump is allergic , maybe partially because he can see no reason or possibility for improvement.  The guys doesnt read books for goodness sake.
No doubt they are planning the next set of dirty tricks, can't be too many left.  Nah, Trump is the master of cheating.  That is if someone draws the pictures for him to look at.  Love the census ploy, thanks for the info on that one.
There are just SO many MORE IMPORTANT THINGS in the world today; if that's what their bitch is, they deserve another four years of Trump!
Trump is claiming that he is going to require coverage of pre-existing conditions.   Which is a basic tenet of the ACA.  IT HAS BEEN DONE BEFORE.  IT IS CURRENTLY THE LAW.  He's just taking credit for something Obama did, again. That is really pathetic.
When Trump speaks people listen, when Biden speaks, I go what did he just say? I would call my wife in to watch cause she speaks 5 different languages. I ask her to interpret this. She has no idea what Biden said. LOL. Just saying.
Can he play RW with Krejci? Because there are no living people who can figure it out.
Just once, I wish I could observe the world thru Trump's rose-colored glasses. Oh, wait: That's the problem! He can't see crap because he's not wearing any!
PRESIDENT DONALD FUCKING TRUMP UNLEASHED.
Biden would face the same lack of acceptance Trump did. He will cry or quit
That already exists, under the ACA. Which, so far, is still in force despite Trump's attempts to get rid of it and replace it with...nothing.  Just another thing that Trump the Failure is trying to take credit for. IT ALREADY EXISTS.
Get ready for 4 more years of Trump.
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP UNLEASHED.
Trump said this immediately after being a jerk to a reporter out for not mentioning Iran-in the SAME REPORT. But for *this* question he hasn‚Äôt seen it? All roads lead to Putin....
Would it make a difference if he only dodged it once?  Then later said McCain's not a hero cause he was caught? The point is he's a coward.. Anyway, draft dodging's part of the public record.
O i almost forgot the most famous trump quote about his supporters  "Like fish in a barrel" -Trump
I‚Äôm not sure if Trump understands ethics or constitutional law in its fullest
Contradicting the intelligence community‚Äôs assessment, the president said, ‚ÄúThe last person Russia wants to see in office is Donald Trump.‚Äù  Pressed on the matter, he said: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care what anybody says‚Äù
Never mind Trump increased the defense budget by 10% and they still want more borrowed money!
You can repeat this daily but that doesn‚Äôt make it true. 64 million tests performed, 32K% increase in testing since 3/12, and never before seen progress in vaccines. Sorry but your campaign strategy to destroy Trump by lying about COVID is WEAK!!!

Anyone else feel that words like "beautiful" and "wonderful" and "biggest" and "best" (etc etc etc) are... "Trump" words? Like, I need to expand my vocabulary so I don't sound like that fuckwit.
Wow, President Trump attempting to provide real relief to people while Democrats continue to try and destroy everything in their path.
If you  believe fox news and their lies then you are an uninformed person.  Fox News wants to get trump re-elected so they will say anything.  Fox just sows misinformation.    Trump is desperate because he is losing in the polls

Shawn do you really think this is a posting contest between Biden and trump? If so...I'll have to straighten you out that trumps accusers fate back to the 80s and Biden had only one.  Post contest done.  Let's go back to ideas...trump has none, doesnt believe in reading.
Having failed to repeal Obamacare, Trump will now create Obamacare by executive order.
I dont know him personally.  But I know who Roy Cohn is and I also know most people in NYC despise Trump for his constant lying, attention grabbing, constant lawsuits and threats of same, and for stiffing contractors.
It is the Trump virus here in the US.
Uh, that's what Obama did.  Until Trump and republicans changed it.  Break it, Fix it then call it a win....

Hilarious transcript from an upcoming Trump-Biden debate:
Trump is the only President in my life time that when he says he is going to do something he gets it done. Biden has no chance.
I've got to believe if you called Merkel, Macron,  Trudeau, and nealy any of our allies, they'd all like to see Trump's fat ass out of the Oval Office.

for someone that thinks they're so smart you really have no idea how business works do you? I don't have any knowledge of business but even I understand that Trump provided a name, a product and some funding.. and that was probably the extent of his involvement.
You're a racist Joe's social media manager. Thanks for coming out for racist Joe to try and defend him. I heard that if you vote for Trump over Biden you aren't black?ü§î. Wanna clarify that?
Guessing you have stock in companies *other* than Tesla/SpaceX and want the contracts to go to those investments. What have you done for Colorado while licking Trump's boots the last few years? Buh-bye in November, Cory.

I heard an awful story that a BLM protester got life in prison from some tRUMP supporting judge. It's something about him pouring red paint on a bld. Only in tRUMP's America can something  like this happen - if it's true.

Trump has cleaned out the treasury and is about to slash SS and Medicare. He's billed the public for over $3,000,000 in golf rentals and fees against the Secret Service budget. You're laughable.
The asshole Trump is depending on to wreck the Postal Service doubles down and then some

If you‚Äôre willing to look away from this and turn a blind eye just because you dislike Trump you may want to ask yourself if it would  have been ok if the administration before Obama did this to him. Whether you like Trump or not, is not what is being questioned here.
I have never liked Trump from the 1970's on. You really are an exceptionally blind individual. You don't like the 2 party system? Then why didn't Bernie run a 3rd party?
Americans die while Trump golfs. Somewhat like let them eat cake?
Libertarians are more or less wild card conservatives and also responsible for the tea party. There's a large number of them involved in QAnon as well, so I'm more or less comfortable with my knowledge of this matter. Including the local libertarian party's support of Trump.
I agree that Trump certainly seems to and it runs in his family.
I guess I meant some people try to make a case for Biden, though I think they are wrong. Bad word choice on my end.   My point is that the Church tells us to vote our consciences, and we have a responsibility to make sure those are well-formed. It doesn't say: Vote Trump or else.

If Congress doesn‚Äôt get it done, what does President Trump do?
When Trump is gone, if Positions are left unfilled because Congress has not confirmed the president‚Äôs candidates for over sixty days, the house should be able to fill the spots without interference from the President.
President Trump, our non profit organization is based in Beirut and is well-connected across the Arab world. We can help make sure the donations from the United States are well managed and reach their destination.
It‚Äôs shit like this that makes me very nervous about the election. If Trump wins it‚Äôll be because he cheated and this time not only Russia helped, but members of the GOP. I‚Äôm disgusted by all of it.
Is Trump banning TikTok so that Mark has a built in audience for a new platform?

That's great in theory. But the reality is that we have trump because trumplicans have been gestating in echo chambers for years. They just emerged from their cocoons in 2016. They don't hear logic. They don't see reason. They don't accept facts.  You cannot reason with them.

Really hard to make a case for a third party...(a formed conscience need be followed though). "sin of omission" is an interesting analogy for this...as no case can be logically made for Biden, and strong cases can be made for Trump...the 3rd party option close to a throw away
Those tend to be low-info voters who don't care about VP as much as the base, but understand your concern, it could turn out that way, I suppose. Always a cost/benefit and for me the benefits far outweigh potential costs. Agree to disagree on this, as long as Trump is out!
I hear you with regards to Biden constantly undermining himself and I STILL have my Bernie sticker on my car BUT Trump has to lose overwhelmingly (or he and his supporters will try to pull a violent coup) and THEN we push, push, push Biden in the direction we need him to go.

I presume the  wants to win, and  can energise younger voters to come out and vote. Kasich backing Biden will play like sour grapes to Republicans. I don't think anyone is on the fence in this election, Trump has failed spectacularly, Kasich won't change any minds!
You seem invested in changing the subject. Do you want to just admit that they aren't a terror group and we can move on?  You said something far more interesting than this discussion when you heard "Trump is bad" when I said he was a terrorist.   Do you think terrorism is bad?
Banning TikTok is just a political ploy by Trump Administration. Once you start unraveling the clusterfuck of digital ad business, you realize it does not matter who owns these digital platforms.

Agreed. I'm as anti-establishment as they come, but I do not want to be fighting Trump anymore. My vote is clear, and then I'll spend the next 4 years tearing down the candidate I voted for.
The boneheads at the motorcycle gathering in Sturges will be getting the virus and bring it back to all the places they came from. We thought trump is stupid. These morons just do not care. Way to go Harley Davidson and company.
Man. Dinesh really picks weird hills to die on. I'd bet 99.9% of the time, Trump pronounced it "Tie-land" like everyone else. That might be why he immediately corrected himself. Now what? Dinesh is gonna tell us that the 99.9% of the time is the time Trump is a dumbshit?
God I wish Trump would magically go away.
Not when it's obvious people were in a flurry to create fakes to prop up Trump's argument. Or the fact all early videos with identifiable time stamps lack your apparent missile. If you want me to assume you were involved in those anon postings I can.
1 in 5 Coloradans currently can‚Äôt affford to pay rent/mortgage. 1 in 3 people can‚Äôt either in some parts of the US.   Meanwhile, big corporations, churches, and the top 1% are raking in billions in relief funds. Donald Trump does not care about the working class. He never did.
I think they jumped the gun on that one
It‚Äôs because the leader of the free world posts lies and garbage.  Twitter and Facebook is not the official Trump media outlet.  Fox is state TV and they do enough to relay Trumps lies.
When states start reclosing, and schools aren't re-opening, and Trump is admitting masks help, SHITS getting SERIOUS.

Wait?  I thought it was fake news?  That‚Äôs what the dictator said.  No merit to the allegations.  Didn‚Äôt come across his desk.  That‚Äôs what he said.  Trump is so weak!
Why name a VP choice when Trump is swimming in a river of bad news? And make all these stories old baloney before anyone is picked. Because they are going to these and other baggage discussed.
These guys like to play the victim. I wonder how long it‚Äôll take before trump says Falwell is a very good person who is being treated unfairly. And that he wishes him well. trump won‚Äôt think the picture is bad - he‚Äôll be jealous it wasn‚Äôt him.
And China doesn‚Äôt want Trump....head of countries have a preference every presidential cycle
So when Trump smashes a cheeseburger on his head and pours Diet Coke on his lap, do the rest of his WH enablers at the table smoosh their scalps with fettucine and douse their crotches with Chianti to show that there is nothing wrong with Cheeto-Face's behavior?

Their leader and President Trump have cut their budget because they want to privatize it and stop mail-in voting. #notkidding. Staff has been cut.

If you want to be impressed, look at the stock market when Obama took over until the presidency was stolen from Hilary!  Trump was just riding the wave of Obama‚Äôs successes.  All Trump did was give away the farm with Tax credits for the rich and doubled our debt!
And let‚Äôs not get it twisted. China is still out to help Trump. Don‚Äôt fall for false narratives.
Now trump is abandoning American cities, just like he abandoned our Soldiers when Russia put a bounty on them. #TrumpIsACompleteFailure
No, Obama was also a piece of shit and a terrorist. See, unlike you, I am consistent. You are all about details and nuance with Trump but are willing to use the term "terrorist" for your enemies regardless of facts.   Why are you so inconsistent and emotional?
I'm really exhausted at how obvious the lying coming out of QAnon, Trump's Campaign, and his supporters, is, lately.   If I could sign my vote in blood at this point, I will. These people are enemies of the United States.

She did tell us she is a Trump Democrat
That is distinctly different than BLM being a terror organization. Do you think that the lawyer that represented the Boston bomber is an Islamic terrorist?   And no, Trump is a terrorist. None of what you said changes that one bit.
Because Trump is terrified of Putin. Simple as that.
Don‚Äôt forget Trump was told what he should do. Did he do it. No. If a dumb electrician knew it was coming, why didn‚Äôt he?  Shutting down borders to China was good and a little late. But hey, let‚Äôs let it come over from Europe. Sneak in the back door. I did well on spy puts then!
You'd have to ask trump.  He keeps thinking of a new way to hurt God every single day, starting with putting newborns, toddlers, children and teenagers in cages.
If you vote for trump, you are a traitor to this country, simple.
Your master trump is being sued by  for raping her. The judge just said they can pursue getting Trumps DNA to match up to the semen stains he left during the department store rape.

There was a flurry of activity on QAnon forums and various trump-support outlets to create fake videos of the Beirut blast to support trumps assert that there was a missile. Earlier videos do not have this element. I believe (1/2)
I think things would be different... not sure if better is the right word but different lol. Covid is the one thing I think would be better without a doubt. She was the worst candidate the Dems could have put up in 2016 imo. Hatred of her is a big reason Trump got elected.

The China virus became the trump virus in March when you failed to do anything meaningful to contain it. Mentioning China at this point completes the cycle of taking no responsibility. Resign or be embarrassed.
Trump is sincere. He believes he's been Chosen. His references are open hints to the Divine to help him out.  I think that's how his followers see it, too.
Well they can use the flag for the country of Thighland and Trump can be their president.

That's easy to answer.  IT'S BECAUSE TRUMP LIES TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE

If anyone still supports Trump, they are definitely racist. You can't justify supporting a man who is a devout racist, by saying things like, 'well I don't like him as a person, but I like what he's doing for this country'. You support who he is &amp; what he stands for. Everything.

Anyone dumb and arrogant enough to have a huge pool party during a pandemic is possibly dumb enough to support Trump.  My assumption is based on logic.  Funny how you assume rioters are protestors.
This is actually a pretty genius and abusive tactic. Trump can put the onus on Biden to agree to an in-person debate even tho he doesn't want to debate (has prev indicated he may or may not show up) and when Biden inevitably says no and wants a cyber debate, he can blame Biden.
Yesterday, I was wondering to myself ‚Äúwhy is my mail never home by the time I'm off work," and then I realized that it's likely because tRump appointed that trashbag as Postmaster General.   This president is SCREWING this country, its citizens, our environment, and everything

She said that before anyone knew anything about the virus. You know this yet you continue this narrative. After we learned more, Trump and his benighted followers still refused to wear masks, still had big pool parties, still went to rallies, Daytona, etc.
Me too!  Dems are capable of doing anything to win.  Trump will win if it‚Äôs fair.
Trump supporters will call it a hoax
Pelosi is unbelievably arrogant and dangerous. Vote Trump and Republican in November. Vote Pelosi out of Speaker of House position.
Another 4 years of Trump would certainly bother me
I am so sorry. Trump has caused all of this.

Wow wtf is this guy? He is starting to show symptoms. Of Trump syndrome. Where is the vaccine for this?
You are WRONG.  People who pay cash (i.e. no other coverage) pay the most. The ACA established protection for pre-existing conditions. Trump and his congressional followers have tried repeatedly to repeal these protections. McCain put country over party.
Big Joe!  No, you actually don‚Äôt.  I love you to death man but don‚Äôt fall victim to the Trump Tweeting.  Please just let the man sink himself.

Wishful thinking Dave, Trump supporters are more jazzed up than ever to vote and support this President, save the physco-babble for the classroom. üòä
The great divider is the orange clown sitting in the White House right now. What caused division while Obama was in office is white people who couldn‚Äôt accept &amp; resented the fact that a black man was elected president. One of those people was the birther trump. No surprise there.

I don‚Äôt know about have left, but I have had some leftist stereotypes express thoughts of voting for Trump strictly on the basis of the democrat party being incoherent and dangerous. Though they aren‚Äôt really aware of how wrong and evil Dems are, so it‚Äôs encouraging.
Amen to that fact  Trump can‚Äôt be bought, and the Marxist Democrats hate him for it. Obama, Biden and other Dems all got wealthy feeding at the public trough. They‚Äôve mastered the fine art of screwing the public.

How is Trump our only hope?  He‚Äôs hurt this country in so many ways.  Deregulation of food manufacturing standards led to the largest amount of food recalls we‚Äôve seen.  China tariffs left American farmers hurting more than they have since the Great Depression.
This clan has the time and the money to monitor him every day. I‚Äôm disappointed that they aren‚Äôt doing more given the political damage this guy is leaving in his wake, unless they see themselves as the the next trump family. Then it all makes sense.
Biden for President ads are truly despicable. That crying lady blaming her grandma‚Äôs death on President! President Trump initiated the travel ban within 10 days of the first case while every other leader shamed him.
Biden is a puppet socialist whose strings are being pulled by Sanders, Warren and AOC in Congress and by the CCP in China. He‚Äôs a genuine Manchurian Candidate. Vote Trump and Republican in November. Save our constitutional republic from the militant socialists, i. e., communists.

You mean the ones from Trump that say Catholics don‚Äôt believe in God?
It is a ploy by the Trump organization so people vote for him instead of Biden which takes votes away to help trump win. It's another desperate way that Trump is trying to cheat the election, pathetic and ridiculous

that is so NOT true, the members of his party are ONLY pretending to pull the chain to make themselves look good for votes, because they know the war will soon be over for them. They do not care about what trump does, and proven it time and again. They are desperate.

Nope! What scares me is the mental stability of tRump!  What scares me is his total lack of empathy, his non-handling  of COVID19, tRump wanting to postpone the election, his blatant racism and white supremacist views, his love for Putin, to name a few! Learn to critically think!

Bye bye then. You were great and I'll miss you but I haven't heard that from the Holy Spirit and until I do I'm sticking with Trump because there's no question he's God's man. If you no longer believe that, you've been deceived by a devil, Pal.
Officials in the Trump administration have been rightly referring to the government in China as "The Chinese Communist Party" or CCP, not just as "Chinese government." This is apt. A communist is always a communist, and that must never be forgotten.

Alas, you're a faux president, so it all works out. Though I would sooner trust Jim Acosta on reporting the news than Donald Trump on leading this Nation.
A "friend" of mine feels that he is "protecting his children" by sending them to school. He believes that the media is creating fear that it's going to cost more lives than the virus, that masks don't work and of course he is a Trump supporter. Choices have consequences

GOP is using kayne like a puppet to steal black voters from Biden. Keep your eyes open. If you want trump again then vote for kayne as kayne cannot win.
Kayne west is doing what Ralph Nader did which is split the vote and steal votes from democrats. Kayne is there simply to steal the black vote from Biden to help out trump. If you are a trump supporter then vote for kayne or trump. If you support democrats then Biden

I hate to say this, but the more the Republicans screw these things up, the more I hope it hurts all those Trump supporters and people who vote for them like McConnell. And those who continue to vote for them you deserve what you get, and I hope it sucks bad
If you think Trump is that smart, you are delusional.No, he didn't apologize, he doubled down. Trump doesn't need to apologize as it is, because he's not racist. Joe Biden actually believes these racist things -- because he's always having to apologise for them, ie: admission of guilt.

Exactly! You can‚Äôt make me miss that administration, even by comparing them to Trump. Maybe their shit didn‚Äôt stink as much as Trumps; but it‚Äôs still smelly shit üí©
If you‚Äôre wondering, it‚Äôs probably conceivable. For me it doesn‚Äôt come instantaneously, but for example: the night trump was elected, I said to my wife ‚ÄúI hope the Russians didn‚Äôt have anything to do with this.‚Äù

Trump wants to shut down TikTok because the users claim they banded together and gobbled up all the tickets to his rally in Tulsa that almost nobody showed up for. He wants to stufle anybody that disagrees with him he wants to shut up....like twitter, Facebook, CNN &amp; Fox News.
You guys never stop with your bullshit.  It won‚Äôt work. Joe has my vote ! I also saw Joe shake Trump‚Äôs hand, I‚Äôm not holding that against him either.

Because Kanye is being used by trump to try to sway the election towards him. We‚Äôll never get out of this mess we‚Äôre in if trump gets re-elected.
We could be at or near a point like this right now.  People continue to obsess over someone that is gone from politics, and who was investigated before they left.this is happening in part because the message "lock her up" was such a passionately successful one for trump that 4/5
Repubs have always wanted to gut our "entitlement programs". Trump is their useful idiot. Make it seem like it's a win buy telling people you'll have more money in your pockets never saying a thing how it will negatively impact seniors &amp; is of no benefit to people who have no job
I actually heard Republicans that are going to vote Biden say if Whitmere is VP they'll go back to trump.
Are they protesting Trump's environmental policies that harm unborn babies?
Delusional! Biden is working on plans to bring us out of this depression we‚Äôre in. Trump is whining like a little bitch because no one likes him. What‚Äôs there to debate?
If you choose to not vote for Biden, you're voting for Trump. Don't ever call yourself a never Trumper either. People like you are why we are in this mess. Think of the people who are being harmed by Trump‚Äôs policies &amp; actions. Think of the seniors who rely on SS &amp; Medicare.

Narcissists are going love other Narcissists like Trump. He is the only one that doesnt make them realize their dysfunction.
I don‚Äôt throw this word around, and I really don‚Äôt like saying it, but I HATE Trump with every fibre of my being. Every. Single. One.
President Trump signing a major executive order, for health insurance companies to cover pre-existing conditions! Why didn‚Äôt President Obama think of that? Oh wait, it‚Äôs already in the affordable care act!
I‚Äôve had two people tell me that Beyonc√© stans are like Trump supporters and that is so WILDLY disrespectful
"Trump says he plans on making insurers cover pre-existing conditions ‚Äî a protection which already exists under Obamacare"
Wow...1984 a bit late: just in time for 2024? Police state rising unless we can dislodge Trump et al from the WH!!üò°üò°üò°
trump tells you what to think, say, and do. And like all cult members you do exactly what he wants.
Wow wtf is this guy? He is starting to show symptoms. Of Trump syndrome. Where is the vaccine for this?
You are WRONG.  People who pay cash (i.e. no other coverage) pay the most. The ACA established protection for pre-existing conditions. Trump and his congressional followers have tried repeatedly to repeal these protections. McCain put country over party.
This time next year Donald Trump could be sitting in jail
That‚Äôs also not a law, but an executive order, so he can rescind it at any time... Related: payroll tax cuts will be later used as a pretext to cut SS and Medicare benefits. Oh - and Kanye has sold out to Trump...
That‚Äôs a pretty old clipping you‚Äôve got there. Do you really want to go tit for tat between Biden and Trump? Why didn‚Äôt Trump attention the memorial for John Lewis? Why does Trump inspire nazis to march in the streets with torches?
Obamacare was a scam. They made it with Blackfoot deals with big pharmaceutical and insurance lobbyists. Trump‚Äôs making sure the good part is kept, something they could have done without the scam but didn‚Äôt.
Trump Is Not Well #TrumpIsNotWell
Are you dumb axios or do you not realize Obamacare is a failure, leaving more still uninsured than it covers while jacking up costs? It needs to be repealed but Trump is keeping one of the only good things from it.
Big Joe!  No, you actually don‚Äôt.  I love you to death man but don‚Äôt fall victim to the Trump Tweeting.  Please just let the man sink himself.
Anti-maskers explain themselves #antimaskers  via
It's hard to believe that even Trump's most fervent base could believe the avalanche of unfulfilled promises that have come from this man's speeches.
Bullshit. You republicans just can‚Äôt quit with the lying. Following trump‚Äôs example.
I‚Äôm not even a Trump fan, but Jesus Christ. Has it occurred to anyone that not all plans cover pre-existing conditions and the media claims he wants to take what coverage there is away 24/7? Of course not. Maybe he felt the need to put an end to that lie.
The way to protect Obama‚Äôs policy gains was always to get Trump to think he created them, and the plan is working perfectly.
I love that Trump called out the Dems especially Nervous Nancy on the relief package. It is amazing that these Liberats are starting to go a little right cause they know they are in deep trouble come Nov. Where is Hunter? Just saying. We will not see any debates, or a VP pick.
The framers were unanimous that Congress, as the representatives of the people, should be in control of public funds‚Äînot the President or executive branch agencies.  IM SCREAMING THAT TRUMP MIGHT USE AN EXECUTIVE ORDER TO PASS STIMULUS FUNDS. AND NO ONE IS TELLING HIM ITS ILLEGAL
Republicans and Trump's administration are always asking for bailouts for corporations and what can help line their pockets, instead of making actuals incentives for the normal people.
Prove it. (Kinda like you CLAIMED you had proof on Trump Russia ‚Äúcollusion‚Äù) You are a liar and a disgrace. #resign
Your daily reminder that the polls are wrong because his supposed naysayers aren‚Äôt being truthful and will flinch and vote Trump on Election Day.  #mediawhore
I attribute to my having grown up in Alabama the fact that I believe what your friend asserts. Trump's supporters believe he hates who they hate. They can count on him to treat badly those whom they hate. If I am butting in here, I apologize for my rudeness; sorry.

Typical trump, create a crisis that only HE can solve
I also appreciate the juxtaposition of actual footage of migrants forced back into Mexico to wait to ask for asylum under the Migrant Protection Protocols ("Remain in Mexico") and Trump's lies about how they are bad people who look like they should be in the UFC.
The great divider is the orange clown sitting in the White House right now. What caused division while Obama was in office is white people who couldn‚Äôt accept &amp; resented the fact that a black man was elected president. One of those people was the birther trump. No surprise there.
I don‚Äôt agree with everything. Guns should be illegal and God has no place in politics. But it‚Äôs anyone but Trump. Voting any different will only help Trump.
Because trump says they‚Äôre immune!!
Trump is a bot
I can‚Äôt wait to see what authority Trump thinks he has that would let him unilaterally order insurance companies to cover preexistig conditions. You know, if Congress hadn‚Äôt already done it a decade ago.
Trump says Asians 'understand exactly' why he uses racist terms for coronavirus
It‚Äôs all we have. He sucks, but he‚Äôs not Trump. Hence the ‚Äúanyone but Trump!‚Äù movement.
Joe Arpaio, who also ran an unsuccessful U.S. Senate campaign in 2018, not long after President Trump pardoned his criminal conviction for disobeying a judge‚Äôs order, has been narrowly defeated in his bid to win back the sheriff‚Äôs post in metro Phoenix.
Because god loves liars, cheaters, corrupt criminals, rascist, creeps like Donald Trump. Horrible
Thank God     are NOT the elite. Trump came INTO office rich, the others LEAVE office rich. Stop being divided by media. Remember CNN said it would kill you until they DIDN‚ÄôT.

Pre-existing conditions are CURRENTLY covered. Trump is suing to END pre-existing conditions. But you know that - you‚Äôre just counting on Trump‚Äôs base to be ignorant of that fact.
Now onto refugees, and it's painful to hear their stories and to know what the Trump administration has done to refugee resettlement and the asylum process.  This is one of the major examples of why "'both parties are equally bad" is just such bs.
#BreakingNews Trump planning to sign executive order to requiring employers and employees to pay into a retirement fund for retirees, he is going to call it "social security"
Trump is sneaky with his words...‚Äùcovering pre-existing conditions‚Äù is not the same thing as ‚Äúaffordable coverage for pre-existing conditions‚Äù.   Lets see if that EO states limits on how much more insurance companies can raise premiums for pre-existing condition coverage.
Welcome to Nazi America a la Trump!üëπ
I feel their pain if they feel bad about voting for tRUMP in 2016. We have one chance to make it right again in November. We can do it if we flood the gates. tRUMP must go
Trump taking credit for what Obama already did years ago. He's done that his whole life. Taking credit for other people's work. You people are pathetic.
Are you saying trump is involved too?
Looks like Trump‚Äôs border wall
So what you are admitting is the Donald Trump does not know what the current law is.  At least you admit it.
If he grows a crap beard, you just know he's been sleeping over at Trump Tower more than is probably appropriate.
Breathe deep.... calm down... now say it....Trump 2020!!!
no, Trump cares only about himself.
What are you doing Joe? Are you waiting till Nov 3rd and say whew I dodged a bullet, now I can retire lol. Move over red rover and let Trump take over. throw the white flag already. How many weeks does it take to pick a running mate. What are the DNC waiting for? Just saying.
Growing up queer in South Carolina, but more recently my partner was attacked by a Trump supporter over an innocent Maltese dog
It's called the Affordable Care Act, aka Obamacare, and it's been the law for ten years. Six weeks ago the Trump Administration filed a brief with the Supreme Court trying to strip Americans of pre-existing protections under Obamacare. This. is. lying.
Literally trump has been saying they should open, the Republicans have been saying that, too. The democrats just said it TODAY after mocking the republicans.
my dream, lady liberty in poor shape trying to protect the people and Trump ripping her clothing to cover the Covid victims to play golf on top. I am going to need PTSD therapy after he is is gone. Illustrators anyone?
Also, if Biden wins (regardless of Trump actually leaving or not, and hopefully he does), we owe a big thanks to... who?  BLACK WOMEN - the most consistent bloc of voters the Dems have. Now's our chance to do right by them.
In #Colorado Kayne West is to be on the ballot for president. The #Republicans fought for this!  Fuck Trump!  He must go we can‚Äôt have another 4 yrs of this shit.

He can‚Äôt breathe in a mask bc he‚Äôs exhausted from kissing Trump‚Äôs butt
I agree with that whole heartedly. Appointing people to run the government is the most important job the president does. Even that job Trump has corrupted by surrounding himself with unqualified synchophants.
If only the poor ppl of this country knew how the system works against them when a Republican like tRUMP is in the W.H., he wouldn't be President right now. A lot of them voted against their own interests in 2016.
Ooh. I'm crushed. Your eloquent defense of Trump and your witty takedown of my comments is brilliant. Just brilliant. I shall change my mind immediately.  Feeling a bit triggered, there, snowflake?

I say this as a former Republican, it‚Äôs not enough to get rid of Trump but all those that laid the groundwork that led to him. That happened over a long period of time and getting the GOP or something new to replace it isn‚Äôt going to happen overnight because Trump is gone.
Lindsey, we know better. It's about money for F-35's, the federal building across from the Trump hotel &amp; White House renovations, and no unemployment benefits for the poor guys that need it. Ya fkn piker.

This has never been done before *checks notes* unless you count ACA, while Trump has been supporting the GOP push to repeal this for the last 3.5 years.
Hating trump is easy. Admitting you contributed to genocide in Iraq and Afghanistan is hard. Most new allies fail that second test.

The difference between Trump &amp; Jose (since apparently Joe is now part Latino), is that Jose takes a knee &amp; Trump stands tall.  Taking a knee is a slave mentality.  The men who liberated the slaves never took a knee.  Kneel for God, but not any man.  Biden is an awkward skintag.
But it makes him look like he cares (which he doesn't). Mnuchin and Meadows set this up, they didn't negotiate in good faith. This was planned all along to make Trump look good.. Who is going to sue to stop this, which members of Congress won't vote to fund this? Good PR for DJT.
President Trump is suspending student loans for now, tricking you, just to get your vote! Only two terms for POTUS. Don't fall for it! You students will still be in depth, with interest! Be wise, He is not on your side! Go with the forgiveness, Democrat! More possible.

So the unemployed will get a check from a trump executive order, but us Americans who have either took a pay cut or changed jobs to a lower salary won't get help. On top of that we're still getting taxed...you Democrats have no soul and you just lost the election with this.
The huckster can't lose.... if Dems don't sign he blames them,if they do sign,  its a win for Trump. This thing is fixed 6 ways to hell.
Trump‚Äôs best day ever.
Is this the new plan? Trump is gonna issue EOs for things that have already happened, then try to take credit?   Easier than work, I guess.
Hey Mr Biden. We can‚Äôt let trump do ANYTHING else. I‚Äôve contributed to your campaign tonight so you can overturn all the horrendous, inane policies like this one and so many others. It‚Äôs imperative you persevere! #BlueWave2020
Ya Obamacare already covers preexisting conditions, Libs are jumping all over this. BUT, when was the last time a Republican President Extended/wanted to expand, healthcare in this country? Maybe Trump'll see he needs to go further. Biden wont consider anything beyond statusquo.
Wait I have questions: can Trump do all this via executive order? If so, how sad is it that  can't get this done?
There is no exception for political activity and peaceful protest, and Trump is a fucking fascist fluffing his ego in front of the only people he thinks matter.
You missed the point!  I wasn‚Äôt expecting a Trump rally and some of us need answers about our lives when it comes to unemployment extension.  Another sleepless night while the media gets stuck with their dicks in their hands again.
Then why did Trump correct himself the second time he said it?
JUST IN: President Donald Trump said during a last-minute news conference Friday that he is ready to sign an executive order that will offer unemployment supplements, eviction protection, and a payroll tax holiday through the end of the year.
Trump was really my first major awareness of wealthy white trailer trash and his deplorables have just amplified its existence.  Money doesn't buy class.
Maybe that should be: It's August 7th, and President Trump still doesn‚Äôt WANT‚ùóÔ∏èan adequate national testing strategy.
. did it first and better. It‚Äôs called the Affordable Care Act - the law that Trump is fighting to overturn via the Supreme Court.
Trump taking credit for something someone else did. Again.
While the POTUS goes golfing, &amp; is attempting to ban TikTok, the US once again recorded 2000 deaths in a single day. The most since May. Trump &amp; Republicans have royally screwed the pooch on this pandemic and their response (or lack there of). Fuck them &amp; their pro-life bullshit.
Wait til you hear how President Trump treated his holy union with all three of his wives. It's a doozy.
WTAF?...holy sh*t....the ship that caused the explosion in Beirut was Russian...and now a ship named after Trump has 3 times the explosives is pulling into Ukraine....JFC....

Our suffering for Trump‚Äôs failures is just beginning. We have sacrificed half a year, $3 trillion of our treasure and 157,000 lives ‚Äî and it has been squandered by one man‚Äôs incompetence.
Every message Biden makes, which are few, is followed up by some kind of explanation or apology. Trash what Trump says all you want, but at least he backs his words with actions and not apologies.   Same can't be said for Biden who only backs everything he says with excuses.

Yeah you missed the point.  Exercise isn't about being cool it's about self improvement. Trump is allergic , maybe partially because he can see no reason or possibility for improvement.  The guys doesnt read books for goodness sake.
No doubt they are planning the next set of dirty tricks, can't be too many left.  Nah, Trump is the master of cheating.  That is if someone draws the pictures for him to look at.  Love the census ploy, thanks for the info on that one.
There are just SO many MORE IMPORTANT THINGS in the world today; if that's what their bitch is, they deserve another four years of Trump!
Trump is claiming that he is going to require coverage of pre-existing conditions.   Which is a basic tenet of the ACA.  IT HAS BEEN DONE BEFORE.  IT IS CURRENTLY THE LAW.  He's just taking credit for something Obama did, again. That is really pathetic.
When Trump speaks people listen, when Biden speaks, I go what did he just say? I would call my wife in to watch cause she speaks 5 different languages. I ask her to interpret this. She has no idea what Biden said. LOL. Just saying.
Can he play RW with Krejci? Because there are no living people who can figure it out.
Just once, I wish I could observe the world thru Trump's rose-colored glasses. Oh, wait: That's the problem! He can't see crap because he's not wearing any!
PRESIDENT DONALD FUCKING TRUMP UNLEASHED.
Biden would face the same lack of acceptance Trump did. He will cry or quit
That already exists, under the ACA. Which, so far, is still in force despite Trump's attempts to get rid of it and replace it with...nothing.  Just another thing that Trump the Failure is trying to take credit for. IT ALREADY EXISTS.
Get ready for 4 more years of Trump.
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP UNLEASHED.
Trump said this immediately after being a jerk to a reporter out for not mentioning Iran-in the SAME REPORT. But for *this* question he hasn‚Äôt seen it? All roads lead to Putin....
Would it make a difference if he only dodged it once?  Then later said McCain's not a hero cause he was caught? The point is he's a coward.. Anyway, draft dodging's part of the public record.
If you‚Äôre serious about getting rid of Trump then it requires supporting Biden for this election.  After that, I don‚Äôt think any democrat expects you or the project lincoln folks to be permanent members of the party.
O i almost forgot the most famous trump quote about his supporters  "Like fish in a barrel" -Trump

Never mind Trump increased the defense budget by 10% and they still want more borrowed money!
You can repeat this daily but that doesn‚Äôt make it true. 64 million tests performed, 32K% increase in testing since 3/12, and never before seen progress in vaccines. Sorry but your campaign strategy to destroy Trump by lying about COVID is WEAK!!!

Hilarious transcript from an upcoming Trump-Biden debate:
Trump is the only President in my life time that when he says he is going to do something he gets it done. Biden has no chance.
I've got to believe if you called Merkel, Macron,  Trudeau, and nealy any of our allies, they'd all like to see Trump's fat ass out of the Oval Office.

Trump has cleaned out the treasury and is about to slash SS and Medicare. He's billed the public for over $3,000,000 in golf rentals and fees against the Secret Service budget. You're laughable.
The asshole Trump is depending on to wreck the Postal Service doubles down and then some

If you‚Äôre willing to look away from this and turn a blind eye just because you dislike Trump you may want to ask yourself if it would  have been ok if the administration before Obama did this to him. Whether you like Trump or not, is not what is being questioned here.
I have never liked Trump from the 1970's on. You really are an exceptionally blind individual. You don't like the 2 party system? Then why didn't Bernie run a 3rd party?
Americans die while Trump golfs. Somewhat like let them eat cake?
Libertarians are more or less wild card conservatives and also responsible for the tea party. There's a large number of them involved in QAnon as well, so I'm more or less comfortable with my knowledge of this matter. Including the local libertarian party's support of Trump.
I guess I meant some people try to make a case for Biden, though I think they are wrong. Bad word choice on my end.   My point is that the Church tells us to vote our consciences, and we have a responsibility to make sure those are well-formed. It doesn't say: Vote Trump or else.

Where the fuck is the FBI? Where is NSA? Where is the oversight when they‚Äôre in Trump‚Äôs pocket too? Including AG Barr. A fair Election is in serious jeopardy and so is democracy.
If Congress doesn‚Äôt get it done, what does President Trump do?
When Trump is gone, if Positions are left unfilled because Congress has not confirmed the president‚Äôs candidates for over sixty days, the house should be able to fill the spots without interference from the President.
President Trump, our non profit organization is based in Beirut and is well-connected across the Arab world. We can help make sure the donations from the United States are well managed and reach their destination.
It‚Äôs shit like this that makes me very nervous about the election. If Trump wins it‚Äôll be because he cheated and this time not only Russia helped, but members of the GOP. I‚Äôm disgusted by all of it.
Is Trump banning TikTok so that Mark has a built in audience for a new platform?
Does literally ANYONE believe that Trump said "Thighland" because he's just too fluent in any Indian language? He can barely garble out American English. Let's be real here.
Isn't there website that Trump admin set up to send things like this too?  We all should send what is happing to it.

Really hard to make a case for a third party...(a formed conscience need be followed though). "sin of omission" is an interesting analogy for this...as no case can be logically made for Biden, and strong cases can be made for Trump...the 3rd party option close to a throw away
Those tend to be low-info voters who don't care about VP as much as the base, but understand your concern, it could turn out that way, I suppose. Always a cost/benefit and for me the benefits far outweigh potential costs. Agree to disagree on this, as long as Trump is out!

I presume the  wants to win, and  can energise younger voters to come out and vote. Kasich backing Biden will play like sour grapes to Republicans. I don't think anyone is on the fence in this election, Trump has failed spectacularly, Kasich won't change any minds!
You seem invested in changing the subject. Do you want to just admit that they aren't a terror group and we can move on?  You said something far more interesting than this discussion when you heard "Trump is bad" when I said he was a terrorist.   Do you think terrorism is bad?

Man. Dinesh really picks weird hills to die on. I'd bet 99.9% of the time, Trump pronounced it "Tie-land" like everyone else. That might be why he immediately corrected himself. Now what? Dinesh is gonna tell us that the 99.9% of the time is the time Trump is a dumbshit?
God I wish Trump would magically go away.
Not when it's obvious people were in a flurry to create fakes to prop up Trump's argument. Or the fact all early videos with identifiable time stamps lack your apparent missile. If you want me to assume you were involved in those anon postings I can.
I think they jumped the gun on that one
It‚Äôs because the leader of the free world posts lies and garbage.  Twitter and Facebook is not the official Trump media outlet.  Fox is state TV and they do enough to relay Trumps lies.
When states start reclosing, and schools aren't re-opening, and Trump is admitting masks help, SHITS getting SERIOUS.

Why name a VP choice when Trump is swimming in a river of bad news? And make all these stories old baloney before anyone is picked. Because they are going to these and other baggage discussed.

No, Obama was also a piece of shit and a terrorist. See, unlike you, I am consistent. You are all about details and nuance with Trump but are willing to use the term "terrorist" for your enemies regardless of facts.   Why are you so inconsistent and emotional?
I'm really exhausted at how obvious the lying coming out of QAnon, Trump's Campaign, and his supporters, is, lately.   If I could sign my vote in blood at this point, I will. These people are enemies of the United States.

I feel for him and I want him to get help but I‚Äôm also furious he is helping to derail the most important election so far in most of our lifetimes, even if it‚Äôs unwittingly. If Trump wins because enough people voted for Kanye, we‚Äôre all screwed
She did tell us she is a Trump Democrat
That is distinctly different than BLM being a terror organization. Do you think that the lawyer that represented the Boston bomber is an Islamic terrorist?   And no, Trump is a terrorist. None of what you said changes that one bit.
Because Trump is terrified of Putin. Simple as that.
Don‚Äôt forget Trump was told what he should do. Did he do it. No. If a dumb electrician knew it was coming, why didn‚Äôt he?  Shutting down borders to China was good and a little late. But hey, let‚Äôs let it come over from Europe. Sneak in the back door. I did well on spy puts then!
You'd have to ask trump.  He keeps thinking of a new way to hurt God every single day, starting with putting newborns, toddlers, children and teenagers in cages.
If you vote for trump, you are a traitor to this country, simple.
Your master trump is being sued by  for raping her. The judge just said they can pursue getting Trumps DNA to match up to the semen stains he left during the department store rape.
This administration is pretty damn transparent with their vindictive retribution.....you think we buy this?  China wants Trump to lose the election.

Oddly the Chinese want Trump to lose, and Russian is doing their damnest to see that Trump wins....so, your post his is VERY suspicious!
There was a flurry of activity on QAnon forums and various trump-support outlets to create fake videos of the Beirut blast to support trumps assert that there was a missile. Earlier videos do not have this element. I believe (1/2)
I think things would be different... not sure if better is the right word but different lol. Covid is the one thing I think would be better without a doubt. She was the worst candidate the Dems could have put up in 2016 imo. Hatred of her is a big reason Trump got elected.

The whole spiel is full of absolute bullshit, anti semitic remarks, anti-trump, and fuckking flat earth, never before have i encountered such a turd parfait of lies and half truths, sad to see.
The China virus became the trump virus in March when you failed to do anything meaningful to contain it. Mentioning China at this point completes the cycle of taking no responsibility. Resign or be embarrassed.
Trump is sincere. He believes he's been Chosen. His references are open hints to the Divine to help him out.  I think that's how his followers see it, too.
Well they can use the flag for the country of Thighland and Trump can be their president.
You are just gaslighting just like trump.

Nope and nope. Deaths, unemployment and we are pitied by the world. Bounties on our troops. ‚ÄúPresident‚Äù who has lied over 20,000 times. Our economy was going up, unemployment was going down. tRump was determined to destroy everything Obama did, and looks like he was successful.
That's easy to answer.  IT'S BECAUSE TRUMP LIES TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE
&amp; the GOP really don't give a damn abt our ppl, our lives, our jobs, our children, our elections...none of it! They've been playing games for months b/c they want to give this to Trump so he can look good by doing something via an Exec Order! It's dirty politics.

If successful, that will make Trump's ratings soar. It will make all in Congress look bad, even though the House passed a bill which did all that and more months ago. The American people don't / can't focus on the details.
Well, teachers are indirectly responsible for the situation we are in. 60 million people voted for Trump. Obviously, teachers failed with them, not teaching criticak thinking skills or civic education. Teachers need to take responsibilty for this.

when I saw that crowd.. I thought of the first high school I went to in NJ in Red Bank. It was known as the country club crowd.. a private Catholic HS.. I don't believe the members had to pay $450,000.00 up front and then annual dues... which is the case for that trump golf club.
Next Week: Shocking! Trump will sign an executive order requiring States to allow women to vote.
so our next logic is trump said that.. trump is refusing to be honest with people.. no sane person would say that dishonest thing to others... then it follows trump is not a sane person
Trump the fascist dictator, who thinks he is with these executive orders he is issuing. Whether you agree or not with what Trump is doing, under our Constitution, only congress shall make law.

I agree.  We need to get the ever so articulate and powerful communicator that is Joe Biden to meet Trump on the debate stage to demonstrate how inarticulate Trump is.  Biden will wipe the floor with Trump with quotes like "You're a lying dog faced pony show"  Killer! #whereamI
I agreee.   What we need is to start the debates and watch the ever so articulate Joe Biden rip the incoherent Trump to shreds.  Let the games begin!  I wish Joe would come out without a teleprompter and give one of his powerful speeches that he's known for.
I have been a white feminist for some time now. It must be comforting to generalize about a very diverse group of women, but can‚Äôt be true.  White feminists did not bring us trump.  Folks wanting to divide Americans benefit when we generalize and denigrate one another.

odd how when obama was in office terrorist attacks on Americans and our military Trump was elected it all stopped if biden gets in are obama's sleepers going to start their attacks to weaken our military and country for a take over
when obama ran for office not one word how black people don't have the right to vote but Trump is up for reelection all of a sudden they don't have the right to vote and have to pass a special act something don't add up been that way since obama
That's so interesting. I wonder what it is she loves. Trump has his faults but most Trump supporters have valid reasons they love him.  I just can't diplomatically see anything good in Joe.
And do what biden shut the country down and destroy our economy and still have a virus spread like wildfire a virus the democrat's created with their allies China just to get Trump out of office because he's hurting your profits from China
Can't control a virus before covid Trump was bring back jobs that the democrat's created in China the democrat's are not for American's they need to blame Trump for their corruption and to get him out of office before he drains their profits

Every Typo, Every Midspoken Word of Trump is on purpose. Commz to US to dig up. Can't get straight thru to American People thru DEMsM. He's Covfefe Brilliant. Thighland = Coded Msg while Trolling Libs obsessed with him. So easy to misdirected and Libs TRULY believe he's Stupid üôÑ

Now We just need to keep the democrat's from tampering with the election even more like using black Americans making false promises, misinformation about Trump democrat's are all lies as an American I've had enough time to vote them out
Due to the way the electoral college works, the president will either be Trump or Biden. A vote for neither is equivalent to not voting, which helps Trump. Do you really want 4 more years of Trump?
can you force Trump Campaign to pay for the entire event and the use of Air Force One because he did that? "At an official WH event, Trump is delivering a campaign speech, repeatedly attacking Biden. Many of the lines are right out of the rallies." -

So, I think that someone needs to start making videos telling Trump fans to vote for Kayne, that he is a younger version of Trump and will make America greater than Trump! We need to flip this back on the GOP!

If they had done this from the very start, Trump would have never won
They chose him because he'll lose. 4 more years of Trump was better than giving anyone Healthcare

Is this true? Did Trump and his family get 22.million for their businesses? And isn't this profiting off the presidency? Or at the very least absolutly ridiculous to give taxpayer funds to billion dollar businesses...documentation and orange jumpsuits please...

I won't insult the dumbest president we have ever had by naming him. But this lumpy sack of used diapers we call Donald Trump is the dumbest president we have ever had.
I believe the most glaring aspect of this election is the need to end Trump's autocracy, nepotism and purchasing of power.
While any good presidential race boils down to which man seems less senile and racist, the Trump campaign wants to make it about neurology even if that's a gamble, because Trump has zero policy ideas other than theft and dodging prison while expelling bullshit thru his face-anus.

Many Liberals hate Trump only because he embarrasses them.   They'll be happy to replace him with a warmongering, rapist, racist, who will deny Americans M4A and a Green New Deal.  But at least they won't feel embarrassed anymore, and that's what really counts.

Yes, saying Trump and Clinton are both bad in 2016 is why we are here. If we can‚Äôt see that Trump is so many times worse than either Clinton or Biden, then this country deserves the worst that will happen under another 4 years.
She‚Äôs correct.  She has made it very clear many times that she WON‚ÄôT be voting for Trump, yet she‚Äôs also not saying who she intends to vote for.  There are always many choices on a ballot, so she will either vote for Biden or one of the other non-viable options.

In Trump's defense, I thought "Thomas" was pronounced with a "th-" sound until I was 6 or 7 years old, and believed the same of the Thames River until I was into my teens.  Much of the confusion arises from canaries' inability to process certain phonemes.
Thank you for taking time to reply. That helped me understand better. Just for clarification - from this point of view, would Trump and Biden winning be equally horrid, one less horrid than the other, or it‚Äôs too messy to say?

It's not that I believe he even thinks this; I'd bet my life Trump is an atheist, as, in his mind, no deity could be smarter or better than him.   It's that he thinks his Christopathic fans will rally behind it. Instead, it forces them to defend him with even dumber ideas.
Never have I heard even the most wild-eyed swamp-preacher complain that God was damaged, especially by a mortal, given that the very possibility ruins the entire scheme.   Yet fundies, shitsuckers all, will find goobered-up ways to explain Trump's whine as perfectly Christian.

Trump has enough sycophants who will try to help him steal an election. #LastWord
Donald Trump should be in prison
Why is the new postmaster general being allowed to slow mail up. This is really shitty. Trump will stop at nothing to win
Sounds like Trump and reminds me of this:
#UPDATE  "Do I want to see a date change? No," Trump said at the White House hours after raising the idea of a delay in a tweet. "But I don't want to see a crooked election."
President Trump was provided w/ an expert plan on how to handle the pandemic by his own SIL, but instead, he lied about the virus, discouraged testing to protect his image, &amp; pit the states against each other in a fight for scarce resources.
Y'all need to report tRump tweet.
Donald Trump is not going to leave the White House willingly. He'll never accept losing an election because his corruption will be exposed! The statute of limitations from his crimes in NY will not run out unless he wins another by term. The worse crazy is yet to come?
Donald Trump should be charged with the 150,000 Dead Americans that died from the coronavirus because of his bulshit saying that it was a HOAX. Do nothing Trump Unfit as President and as a human being.
Get Donald Trump out of our White House. He's a menace to America's  Constitution, democracy along with making the Department of Justice the laughing stock of the world. He believes that the attorney general of the  United States is his legal lawyer. WRONG answer. 2020 elections.
The America that I fought for, that I lost my blood brother and many many more. Just to let somebody like Donald Trump walk all over our Constitution and Shit all over democracy and make a laughing stock DOJ. He is not our King he is unfit as such. Bone Spur Cadet Draft Dodger.No - the dems/msm will continue their assault on Trump for the next 4 yrs; however, he will have a majority in Senate &amp; House so he will MAGA. Pelosi/Schumer/Schiff - not re-elected.  Deep State In Jail. Replicn Govs. Life is good!
So!?  Did you think Trump wouldn‚Äôt call you out for what you are?  Trump could have said a lot worse about you &amp; we would have loved it. You deserve no respect - you‚Äôre despicable.
But you and Trump are Menace to America. Trump's (and therefore, your) crimes go far beyond partisanship.

Doesn‚Äôt matter. The Russians, the postmaster general and Bill Barr have got this covered for Trump.
News flash. That‚Äôs already covered under the affordable care act. As usual, Obama got there before Trump.
Trump makes promise to unilaterally: -Implement payroll tax holiday until end of the year -Defer student loan payments indefinitely -Extend unemployment benefits until of the year.  -Extend moratorium on evictions  But no specifics &amp; unlikely he can do all this legally.

Same. And this is important to state aloud. We have never experienced deadlock like we have now. It has handed us Trump. The pandemic gives us an opportunity to reconfigure. We will be the Trump of reconfiguration if we cannot reform how to function together.
Trump, who calls people is African American, should shut up. He has shoved America deep into violent asnd troubling racism. The news needs to still focus on that. Call Joe out and let answer. We all know he is a good man, older generation. For God's sake, alternative is Trump.

She has to repay $10K while Trump is fined $25M and $2M for his university and charity.  Looks like about 3 orders of magnitude difference.  Given that, why are you focused on Tlaib instead of Trump?
And Trump's removing all oversight, firing IGs, installing Barr as AG, suing to prevent tax/DNA release, pardoning convicted felons like Stone, telling Ghislaine ‚ÄúI wish her well‚Äù doesn't bother you?
So get trump elected, what am I missing?!?
Like Kushner thinking we didn't need to respond to the virus since it was mainly affecting blue states.  Like trumpie governors in red states having to close down again because of CV spikes in RED states.  That's when Trump finally started wearing a mask.

Anyone dumb and arrogant enough to have a huge pool party during a pandemic is possibly dumb enough to support Trump.  My assumption is based on logic.  Funny how you assume rioters are protestors.
She said that before anyone knew anything about the virus. You know this yet you continue this narrative. After we learned more, Trump and his benighted followers still refused to wear masks, still had big pool parties, still went to rallies, Daytona, etc.

Trump's religious when it comes to his little, tiny eternity and his minuscule immortal soul.  He'll accept Jesus if that means he can get into Heaven.  He's terrified of Hell.  Other than that he doesn't have much use for religion.

Remember that trump is appointing people to throw sabots into the voting machinery. The GOP can‚Äôt win majority elections. So they have to find ways to suppress the vote.
In a sane world, Trump's abuse of national emergencies, temporary appointments, etc would lead the next congress and presidency to dramatically pull back on the power of the presidency. I'm just really skeptical that Biden and the Dems will lift a finger to do so if they win.
Leave it to creative types to invent a world where Trump is ‚Äúsweating‚Äù prosecution enough to retain the presidency for life. You people are insufferable...
As we all know, Joe didn‚Äôt write this.  I doubt he even realizes that he said what he said. Let‚Äôs end this charade, horrible sham, being perpetrated on the American people.  Everyone can see Biden disintegrates daily. No matter how much u hate Trump, he will win.

So trump and his donor can single-handedly slow the workings of the post office, but clap-back Nancy can't figure out how to use the power of the purse, or other strategies, to counter these actions?
Sen Thune on idea of Trump acceptance speech from WH grounds: ‚ÄúIs that even legal? ‚Ä¶ I assume that‚Äôs not something that you could do. I assume there‚Äôs some Hatch Act issues or something......But I think anything you do on federal property would seem to be problematic.‚ÄùNo, he didn't apologize, he doubled down. Trump doesn't need to apologize as it is, because he's not racist. Joe Biden actually believes these racist things -- because he's always having to apologise for them, ie: admission of guilt.

Trump says. "It is what it is." Haha Not funny!
Hillary won the popular vote by 2/3.5 million votes. It‚Äòs the electoral college that chooses. And they came out saying they can choose anyone they want regardless. Which is how Trump won.
This shit right here should be illegal, I don't listen to his music and if I did I would stop after this. It's a damn shame the Trump campaign would use a person that suffers with mental health issues to help win their election, but I'm not shocked.
Trump has a habit of destroying something, then rebuilding it and expecting to get praised for doing so.
If you want to really learn about corruption in politics I have two words for you. Trump's inauguration.

New Trump Exec Order allowing women to vote. He is the greatest president of all time. Now if he could only end prohibition.
I don't understand why all these men refuse to speak up? What and who are they so afraid of?  Losing their jobs? You would think DeSantis and Trump were Mafia godfathers. "No position to balk the governor?" They are in exactly the RIGHT position to tell the truth!
Right? I mean, these Trump rally‚Äôs are out of control!
I still think every Trump/Putin phone call is about trump tower Moscow. Putin just gets him on the phone and is like ‚ÄúI really think we‚Äôre close to doing this deal this time, I really do‚Äù like he has for 30yrs and that‚Äôs all trump cares about so that‚Äôs all they talk about
Trump wants to shut down TikTok because the users claim they banded together and gobbled up all the tickets to his rally in Tulsa that almost nobody showed up for. He wants to stufle anybody that disagrees with him he wants to shut up....like twitter, Facebook, CNN &amp; Fox News.
You guys never stop with your bullshit.  It won‚Äôt work. Joe has my vote ! I also saw Joe shake Trump‚Äôs hand, I‚Äôm not holding that against him either.
you guys do not choose Susan Rice, you'll hear nothing but Bengazi and her son is a Trump supporter! Kick yourself in the chin why don't you.
Has to be all the H1-B visa holders lashing out because Trump is going to get their asses canned.
Repubs have always wanted to gut our "entitlement programs". Trump is their useful idiot. Make it seem like it's a win buy telling people you'll have more money in your pockets never saying a thing how it will negatively impact seniors &amp; is of no benefit to people who have no job
I actually heard Republicans that are going to vote Biden say if Whitmere is VP they'll go back to trump.
If you choose to not vote for Biden, you're voting for Trump. Don't ever call yourself a never Trumper either. People like you are why we are in this mess. Think of the people who are being harmed by Trump‚Äôs policies &amp; actions. Think of the seniors who rely on SS &amp; Medicare.
Vermin of Walmart for tRump
I'm shocked to there any parents left who aren't outraged at Trump and the federal government for fucking up the COVID response and ruining the Fall Semester for millions of children.

Schumer now gives his blessing that schools should open? Trump has been saying this for MONTHS! Now who is wrong As Always? Vote these bastards out! PERIOD!
Narcissists are going love other Narcissists like Trump. He is the only one that doesnt make them realize their dysfunction.
I don‚Äôt throw this word around, and I really don‚Äôt like saying it, but I HATE Trump with every fibre of my being. Every. Single. One.
President Trump signing a major executive order, for health insurance companies to cover pre-existing conditions! Why didn‚Äôt President Obama think of that? Oh wait, it‚Äôs already in the affordable care act!
"Trump says he plans on making insurers cover pre-existing conditions ‚Äî a protection which already exists under Obamacare"
Wow...1984 a bit late: just in time for 2024? Police state rising unless we can dislodge Trump et al from the WH!!üò°üò°üò°
trump tells you what to think, say, and do. And like all cult members you do exactly what he wants.
Self trepanning.  Trump say it kills #COVID__19.  #ThingsMorePopularThanTrump
News flash. That‚Äôs already covered under the affordable care act. As usual, Obama got there before Trump.
Trump makes promise to unilaterally: -Implement payroll tax holiday until end of the year -Defer student loan payments indefinitely -Extend unemployment benefits until of the year.  -Extend moratorium on evictions  But no specifics &amp; unlikely he can do all this legally.
This time next year Donald Trump could be sitting in jail
That‚Äôs also not a law, but an executive order, so he can rescind it at any time... Related: payroll tax cuts will be later used as a pretext to cut SS and Medicare benefits. Oh - and Kanye has sold out to Trump...
That‚Äôs a pretty old clipping you‚Äôve got there. Do you really want to go tit for tat between Biden and Trump? Why didn‚Äôt Trump attention the memorial for John Lewis? Why does Trump inspire nazis to march in the streets with torches?
Obamacare was a scam. They made it with Blackfoot deals with big pharmaceutical and insurance lobbyists. Trump‚Äôs making sure the good part is kept, something they could have done without the scam but didn‚Äôt.
Trump Is Not Well #TrumpIsNotWell
Are you dumb axios or do you not realize Obamacare is a failure, leaving more still uninsured than it covers while jacking up costs? It needs to be repealed but Trump is keeping one of the only good things from it.
Anti-maskers explain themselves #antimaskers  via
Certainly Obama's is bigger than Trump's.
It's hard to believe that even Trump's most fervent base could believe the avalanche of unfulfilled promises that have come from this man's speeches.
I‚Äôm not even a Trump fan, but Jesus Christ. Has it occurred to anyone that not all plans cover pre-existing conditions and the media claims he wants to take what coverage there is away 24/7? Of course not. Maybe he felt the need to put an end to that lie.
The way to protect Obama‚Äôs policy gains was always to get Trump to think he created them, and the plan is working perfectly.
How many lost due to your mishandling of the tRump virus???
I love that Trump called out the Dems especially Nervous Nancy on the relief package. It is amazing that these Liberats are starting to go a little right cause they know they are in deep trouble come Nov. Where is Hunter? Just saying. We will not see any debates, or a VP pick.
The framers were unanimous that Congress, as the representatives of the people, should be in control of public funds‚Äînot the President or executive branch agencies.  IM SCREAMING THAT TRUMP MIGHT USE AN EXECUTIVE ORDER TO PASS STIMULUS FUNDS. AND NO ONE IS TELLING HIM ITS ILLEGAL
Republicans and Trump's administration are always asking for bailouts for corporations and what can help line their pockets, instead of making actuals incentives for the normal people.
Prove it. (Kinda like you CLAIMED you had proof on Trump Russia ‚Äúcollusion‚Äù) You are a liar and a disgrace. #resign

I also appreciate the juxtaposition of actual footage of migrants forced back into Mexico to wait to ask for asylum under the Migrant Protection Protocols ("Remain in Mexico") and Trump's lies about how they are bad people who look like they should be in the UFC.
I don‚Äôt agree with everything. Guns should be illegal and God has no place in politics. But it‚Äôs anyone but Trump. Voting any different will only help Trump.
Because trump says they‚Äôre immune!!
Trump is a bot
I can‚Äôt wait to see what authority Trump thinks he has that would let him unilaterally order insurance companies to cover preexistig conditions. You know, if Congress hadn‚Äôt already done it a decade ago.

Pre-existing conditions are CURRENTLY covered. Trump is suing to END pre-existing conditions. But you know that - you‚Äôre just counting on Trump‚Äôs base to be ignorant of that fact.
Now onto refugees, and it's painful to hear their stories and to know what the Trump administration has done to refugee resettlement and the asylum process.  This is one of the major examples of why "'both parties are equally bad" is just such bs.
#BreakingNews Trump planning to sign executive order to requiring employers and employees to pay into a retirement fund for retirees, he is going to call it "social security"
Trump is sneaky with his words...‚Äùcovering pre-existing conditions‚Äù is not the same thing as ‚Äúaffordable coverage for pre-existing conditions‚Äù.   Lets see if that EO states limits on how much more insurance companies can raise premiums for pre-existing condition coverage.
Welcome to Nazi America a la Trump!üëπ
I feel their pain if they feel bad about voting for tRUMP in 2016. We have one chance to make it right again in November. We can do it if we flood the gates. tRUMP must go
Trump taking credit for what Obama already did years ago. He's done that his whole life. Taking credit for other people's work. You people are pathetic.
Are you saying trump is involved too?
So what you are admitting is the Donald Trump does not know what the current law is.  At least you admit it.
If he grows a crap beard, you just know he's been sleeping over at Trump Tower more than is probably appropriate.
Breathe deep.... calm down... now say it....Trump 2020!!!

What are you doing Joe? Are you waiting till Nov 3rd and say whew I dodged a bullet, now I can retire lol. Move over red rover and let Trump take over. throw the white flag already. How many weeks does it take to pick a running mate. What are the DNC waiting for? Just saying.
Growing up queer in South Carolina, but more recently my partner was attacked by a Trump supporter over an innocent Maltese dog
It's called the Affordable Care Act, aka Obamacare, and it's been the law for ten years. Six weeks ago the Trump Administration filed a brief with the Supreme Court trying to strip Americans of pre-existing protections under Obamacare. This. is. lying.
Literally trump has been saying they should open, the Republicans have been saying that, too. The democrats just said it TODAY after mocking the republicans.
my dream, lady liberty in poor shape trying to protect the people and Trump ripping her clothing to cover the Covid victims to play golf on top. I am going to need PTSD therapy after he is is gone. Illustrators anyone?
Also, if Biden wins (regardless of Trump actually leaving or not, and hopefully he does), we owe a big thanks to... who?  BLACK WOMEN - the most consistent bloc of voters the Dems have. Now's our chance to do right by them.

Anyone w/even minimal intelligence can see that everything Trump says is really a projection of what he himself says or does. His brain is so small he can't come up with anything else plus it's all he knows. #PeaBrain #TrumpVirus
I agree with that whole heartedly. Appointing people to run the government is the most important job the president does. Even that job Trump has corrupted by surrounding himself with unqualified synchophants.
If only the poor ppl of this country knew how the system works against them when a Republican like tRUMP is in the W.H., he wouldn't be President right now. A lot of them voted against their own interests in 2016.
Ooh. I'm crushed. Your eloquent defense of Trump and your witty takedown of my comments is brilliant. Just brilliant. I shall change my mind immediately.  Feeling a bit triggered, there, snowflake?

Trump and McConnell. They both need to go. McConnell has been in office since 84! Let‚Äôs make a change.
But people have known for years he's been skimming.  Why is it suddenly an issue. This could backfire. Trump needs something to spark his base. They've always been afraid we're after their guns. This might be the thing they need to get ignited.
It directly tracks my own thinking on this.

If Biden wins then don't cry to me about what used to be America cause I will not listen. All our rights and history would be removed and I will be better off moving out of the country. But of course that won't happen. Trump landslide and we can breathe a lot easier.
This has never been done before *checks notes* unless you count ACA, while Trump has been supporting the GOP push to repeal this for the last 3.5 years.

Or call Jeff Bezos -- I bet he could gin up a postal system and burn Trump in the process, something that would be quite satisfying to him I imagine.
lrt: i am also not trump make me the dem nominee
Just like Trump, schools are not even pretending to try.üëπ
Just like Trump has no plan to stop COVID19. We are officially the country with no plan. It is a common theme!üëπ
Did Trump say we wouldn‚Äôt see him for a while?  Or is that just another disappointing lie?
#Hannity  I hope Trump wins the black vote
You just described a typical supporter of Trump.  üòÇ
Also, huuuge Trump supporter
Yes, it's so major that Trump is trying to take credit for what Obama accomplished years ago  Are you actually that stupid or do you just think that voters are?
If it comes from a Trump , it‚Äôs not true ! Like father like son , TARITORS !

The difference between Trump &amp; Jose (since apparently Joe is now part Latino), is that Jose takes a knee &amp; Trump stands tall.  Taking a knee is a slave mentality.  The men who liberated the slaves never took a knee.  Kneel for God, but not any man.  Biden is an awkward skintag.
But it makes him look like he cares (which he doesn't). Mnuchin and Meadows set this up, they didn't negotiate in good faith. This was planned all along to make Trump look good.. Who is going to sue to stop this, which members of Congress won't vote to fund this? Good PR for DJT.
The WHPC is neutered and all they care about is access and a future book deal about "my time in the WHPC during the Trump presidency."
On July 19th, Trump promised a health care plan would be released in two weeks.  Today, 5 days late, he announces he‚Äôs going to issue an executive order that does something that Congress already did 10 years ago, and that his lawyers are in court tying to dismantle.  Idiocracy.

I‚Äôll only use Reels if trump threatens to ban it
Why didn't the press walk out on Trump's obviously orchestrated "press conference?" Why are they sitting there allowing them to be humiliated with cameras rolling? Is there a purpose to this? Are we going to learn anything that we don't already know about Trump?
So the unemployed will get a check from a trump executive order, but us Americans who have either took a pay cut or changed jobs to a lower salary won't get help. On top of that we're still getting taxed...you Democrats have no soul and you just lost the election with this.
The huckster can't lose.... if Dems don't sign he blames them,if they do sign,  its a win for Trump. This thing is fixed 6 ways to hell.
Trump‚Äôs best day ever.
Is this the new plan? Trump is gonna issue EOs for things that have already happened, then try to take credit?   Easier than work, I guess.
Ya Obamacare already covers preexisting conditions, Libs are jumping all over this. BUT, when was the last time a Republican President Extended/wanted to expand, healthcare in this country? Maybe Trump'll see he needs to go further. Biden wont consider anything beyond statusquo.
Wait I have questions: can Trump do all this via executive order? If so, how sad is it that  can't get this done?
There is no exception for political activity and peaceful protest, and Trump is a fucking fascist fluffing his ego in front of the only people he thinks matter.
You missed the point!  I wasn‚Äôt expecting a Trump rally and some of us need answers about our lives when it comes to unemployment extension.  Another sleepless night while the media gets stuck with their dicks in their hands again.
Then why did Trump correct himself the second time he said it?
JUST IN: President Donald Trump said during a last-minute news conference Friday that he is ready to sign an executive order that will offer unemployment supplements, eviction protection, and a payroll tax holiday through the end of the year.
Trump was really my first major awareness of wealthy white trailer trash and his deplorables have just amplified its existence.  Money doesn't buy class.
Trump taking credit for something someone else did. Again.
While the POTUS goes golfing, &amp; is attempting to ban TikTok, the US once again recorded 2000 deaths in a single day. The most since May. Trump &amp; Republicans have royally screwed the pooch on this pandemic and their response (or lack there of). Fuck them &amp; their pro-life bullshit.
WTAF?...holy sh*t....the ship that caused the explosion in Beirut was Russian...and now a ship named after Trump has 3 times the explosives is pulling into Ukraine....JFC....
You're surprised?? Not me! Trump's helping him

Trump and his administration also botched the nation‚Äôs testing rollout, played down the disease, offered false assurances and bogus remedies, discouraged mask wearing, pushed the economy to reopen prematurely, concealed data, and disparaged testing.

Our suffering for Trump‚Äôs failures is just beginning. We have sacrificed half a year, $3 trillion of our treasure and 157,000 lives ‚Äî and it has been squandered by one man‚Äôs incompetence.
Every message Biden makes, which are few, is followed up by some kind of explanation or apology. Trash what Trump says all you want, but at least he backs his words with actions and not apologies.   Same can't be said for Biden who only backs everything he says with excuses.

Trump, who calls people is African American, should shut up. He has shoved America deep into violent asnd troubling racism. The news needs to still focus on that. Call Joe out and let answer. We all know he is a good man, older generation. For God's sake, alternative is Trump.
I find the idea to be ridiculous...at this point in time....if you would vote for Kanye...you would vote for Trump....I think this will backfire and actually pull votes from Trump...
tRUMP's NEWEST PROPAGANDA AGENDA, JUST FLAT OUT LIE ! ! ! he SAYS PANDEMIC BRIEFING, REALLY JUST ANOTHER üì∑ OP!!! THE BULLSHIT fake*president!#JustTapPicsPlease!!!
Just remembered I had crazy dreams last night! I dreamt  &amp; I had been assigned to review Trump's health records, &amp; we discovered a note that he'd had three heart attacks, &amp; another would be fatal, &amp; we weren't allowed to tell people! Crazy. Trump has no heart!
There are just SO many MORE IMPORTANT THINGS in the world today; if that's what their bitch is, they deserve another four years of Trump!
Trump is claiming that he is going to require coverage of pre-existing conditions.   Which is a basic tenet of the ACA.  IT HAS BEEN DONE BEFORE.  IT IS CURRENTLY THE LAW.  He's just taking credit for something Obama did, again. That is really pathetic.
When Trump speaks people listen, when Biden speaks, I go what did he just say? I would call my wife in to watch cause she speaks 5 different languages. I ask her to interpret this. She has no idea what Biden said. LOL. Just saying.
Can he play RW with Krejci? Because there are no living people who can figure it out.
Just once, I wish I could observe the world thru Trump's rose-colored glasses. Oh, wait: That's the problem! He can't see crap because he's not wearing any!
PRESIDENT DONALD FUCKING TRUMP UNLEASHED.
Biden would face the same lack of acceptance Trump did. He will cry or quit
That already exists, under the ACA. Which, so far, is still in force despite Trump's attempts to get rid of it and replace it with...nothing.  Just another thing that Trump the Failure is trying to take credit for. IT ALREADY EXISTS.
Get ready for 4 more years of Trump.
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP UNLEASHED.
Trump said this immediately after being a jerk to a reporter out for not mentioning Iran-in the SAME REPORT. But for *this* question he hasn‚Äôt seen it? All roads lead to Putin....
O i almost forgot the most famous trump quote about his supporters  "Like fish in a barrel" -Trump
I‚Äôm not sure if Trump understands ethics or constitutional law in its fullest
Contradicting the intelligence community‚Äôs assessment, the president said, ‚ÄúThe last person Russia wants to see in office is Donald Trump.‚Äù  Pressed on the matter, he said: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care what anybody says‚Äù
Never mind Trump increased the defense budget by 10% and they still want more borrowed money!
You can repeat this daily but that doesn‚Äôt make it true. 64 million tests performed, 32K% increase in testing since 3/12, and never before seen progress in vaccines. Sorry but your campaign strategy to destroy Trump by lying about COVID is WEAK!!!
Trump‚Äôs brilliant new healthcare plan is...Obamacare?! ü§£ü§£ü§£ #copolitics #ThanksObama

160,000 Americans are dead, there's record unemployment, Trump is sandbagging the postal service, relief talks have collapsed, &amp; Combover Caligula is preening in front of a bunch of rich assholes at a golf club he profits from *while President*. #sorrynotsorry about the cursing.
Anyone else feel that words like "beautiful" and "wonderful" and "biggest" and "best" (etc etc etc) are... "Trump" words? Like, I need to expand my vocabulary so I don't sound like that fuckwit.No, he didn't apologize, he doubled down. Trump doesn't need to apologize as it is, because he's not racist. Joe Biden actually believes these racist things -- because he's always having to apologise for them, ie: admission of guilt.

Hillary won the popular vote by 2/3.5 million votes. It‚Äòs the electoral college that chooses. And they came out saying they can choose anyone they want regardless. Which is how Trump won.
This shit right here should be illegal, I don't listen to his music and if I did I would stop after this. It's a damn shame the Trump campaign would use a person that suffers with mental health issues to help win their election, but I'm not shocked.
Trump has a habit of destroying something, then rebuilding it and expecting to get praised for doing so.
If you want to really learn about corruption in politics I have two words for you. Trump's inauguration.
I find it ironic that Fox pushes stories about CNBC ignoring Bill Clinton's (a FORMER SCUMBAG PRESIDENT) ties but ignores Trump's (a CURRENT SCUMBAG PRESIDENT) ties.

I don't understand why all these men refuse to speak up? What and who are they so afraid of?  Losing their jobs? You would think DeSantis and Trump were Mafia godfathers. "No position to balk the governor?" They are in exactly the RIGHT position to tell the truth!
Right? I mean, these Trump rally‚Äôs are out of control!
Trump wants to shut down TikTok because the users claim they banded together and gobbled up all the tickets to his rally in Tulsa that almost nobody showed up for. He wants to stufle anybody that disagrees with him he wants to shut up....like twitter, Facebook, CNN &amp; Fox News.
You guys never stop with your bullshit.  It won‚Äôt work. Joe has my vote ! I also saw Joe shake Trump‚Äôs hand, I‚Äôm not holding that against him either.

Repubs have always wanted to gut our "entitlement programs". Trump is their useful idiot. Make it seem like it's a win buy telling people you'll have more money in your pockets never saying a thing how it will negatively impact seniors &amp; is of no benefit to people who have no job
I actually heard Republicans that are going to vote Biden say if Whitmere is VP they'll go back to trump.
If you choose to not vote for Biden, you're voting for Trump. Don't ever call yourself a never Trumper either. People like you are why we are in this mess. Think of the people who are being harmed by Trump‚Äôs policies &amp; actions. Think of the seniors who rely on SS &amp; Medicare.

President Trump signing a major executive order, for health insurance companies to cover pre-existing conditions! Why didn‚Äôt President Obama think of that? Oh wait, it‚Äôs already in the affordable care act!

That‚Äôs also not a law, but an executive order, so he can rescind it at any time... Related: payroll tax cuts will be later used as a pretext to cut SS and Medicare benefits. Oh - and Kanye has sold out to Trump...
That‚Äôs a pretty old clipping you‚Äôve got there. Do you really want to go tit for tat between Biden and Trump? Why didn‚Äôt Trump attention the memorial for John Lewis? Why does Trump inspire nazis to march in the streets with torches?
Obamacare was a scam. They made it with Blackfoot deals with big pharmaceutical and insurance lobbyists. Trump‚Äôs making sure the good part is kept, something they could have done without the scam but didn‚Äôt.
Trump Is Not Well #TrumpIsNotWell
Are you dumb axios or do you not realize Obamacare is a failure, leaving more still uninsured than it covers while jacking up costs? It needs to be repealed but Trump is keeping one of the only good things from it.

It's hard to believe that even Trump's most fervent base could believe the avalanche of unfulfilled promises that have come from this man's speeches.
I‚Äôm not even a Trump fan, but Jesus Christ. Has it occurred to anyone that not all plans cover pre-existing conditions and the media claims he wants to take what coverage there is away 24/7? Of course not. Maybe he felt the need to put an end to that lie.
The way to protect Obama‚Äôs policy gains was always to get Trump to think he created them, and the plan is working perfectly.
I love that Trump called out the Dems especially Nervous Nancy on the relief package. It is amazing that these Liberats are starting to go a little right cause they know they are in deep trouble come Nov. Where is Hunter? Just saying. We will not see any debates, or a VP pick.
The framers were unanimous that Congress, as the representatives of the people, should be in control of public funds‚Äînot the President or executive branch agencies.  IM SCREAMING THAT TRUMP MIGHT USE AN EXECUTIVE ORDER TO PASS STIMULUS FUNDS. AND NO ONE IS TELLING HIM ITS ILLEGAL
Republicans and Trump's administration are always asking for bailouts for corporations and what can help line their pockets, instead of making actuals incentives for the normal people.

#BreakingNews Trump planning to sign executive order to requiring employers and employees to pay into a retirement fund for retirees, he is going to call it "social security"
Trump is sneaky with his words...‚Äùcovering pre-existing conditions‚Äù is not the same thing as ‚Äúaffordable coverage for pre-existing conditions‚Äù.   Lets see if that EO states limits on how much more insurance companies can raise premiums for pre-existing condition coverage.

I feel their pain if they feel bad about voting for tRUMP in 2016. We have one chance to make it right again in November. We can do it if we flood the gates. tRUMP must go
Trump taking credit for what Obama already did years ago. He's done that his whole life. Taking credit for other people's work. You people are pathetic.
Are you saying trump is involved too?
So what you are admitting is the Donald Trump does not know what the current law is.  At least you admit it.
If he grows a crap beard, you just know he's been sleeping over at Trump Tower more than is probably appropriate.

It's called the Affordable Care Act, aka Obamacare, and it's been the law for ten years. Six weeks ago the Trump Administration filed a brief with the Supreme Court trying to strip Americans of pre-existing protections under Obamacare. This. is. lying.
Literally trump has been saying they should open, the Republicans have been saying that, too. The democrats just said it TODAY after mocking the republicans.
my dream, lady liberty in poor shape trying to protect the people and Trump ripping her clothing to cover the Covid victims to play golf on top. I am going to need PTSD therapy after he is is gone. Illustrators anyone?
Also, if Biden wins (regardless of Trump actually leaving or not, and hopefully he does), we owe a big thanks to... who?  BLACK WOMEN - the most consistent bloc of voters the Dems have. Now's our chance to do right by them.

Anyone w/even minimal intelligence can see that everything Trump says is really a projection of what he himself says or does. His brain is so small he can't come up with anything else plus it's all he knows. #PeaBrain #TrumpVirus
I agree with that whole heartedly. Appointing people to run the government is the most important job the president does. Even that job Trump has corrupted by surrounding himself with unqualified synchophants.
If only the poor ppl of this country knew how the system works against them when a Republican like tRUMP is in the W.H., he wouldn't be President right now. A lot of them voted against their own interests in 2016.
Ooh. I'm crushed. Your eloquent defense of Trump and your witty takedown of my comments is brilliant. Just brilliant. I shall change my mind immediately.  Feeling a bit triggered, there, snowflake?
No. I think Russia, China, and the Saudis and Trump against Biden
Trump is doing what he does to win the election  Lie Cheat Corrupt  Lie Putin Corrupt Lie Intelligence NOT! More bronzer Lie PUTIN

So trump is pro ACA, right?
My favorite drinking game is ‚ÄúTrump campaign video or trailer for an A24 movie about the apocalypse?‚Äù
What evidence of the hidden trump voter?
This is a good Tweet correcting Trump's lie in real time. More of this please.
None of you people know what you‚Äôre talking about. Talk about low information voters. I love Trump but some of his supporters are lost in a cornfield ü§£.
The biggest threat were facing in the 2020 election is Donald Jerk Trump
I'm a christian and did not vote for Trump morals, integrity and common sense are valuable to me. He doesn't hold any of the values of Christianity and is not humble or a believer in God, Jesus, repentance or the bible.
Was wondering where Trump‚Äôs African American had been hiding. He might be Security, not sure
Is this a joke? We lost 40 million jobs under Trump.
I imagine every person who grew up in the Cold War reads this and thinks, ‚ÄúWhen did America let these guys decide who we elect?‚Äù  #facepalm
people voting for joe biden...this isn‚Äôt even about trump rn. biden can‚Äôt even form a 5 word sentence
He defended their lack of masks.  - Guy is a lying weasel. - Trump calls audience at his Bedminster golf club a 'peaceful protest'  via
Yes. My mask says fuck trump on it. I wear it with pride!
Trump and McConnell. They both need to go. McConnell has been in office since 84! Let‚Äôs make a change.
But people have known for years he's been skimming.  Why is it suddenly an issue. This could backfire. Trump needs something to spark his base. They've always been afraid we're after their guns. This might be the thing they need to get ignited.
It directly tracks my own thinking on this.
Trump U.
This is good advice from
Trump is going to sign an executive order mandating that trees turn carbon dioxide into oxygen.
So did Trump, tool.
So who pays for security?  ? Trump campaign? US taxpayers?
If Biden wins then don't cry to me about what used to be America cause I will not listen. All our rights and history would be removed and I will be better off moving out of the country. But of course that won't happen. Trump landslide and we can breathe a lot easier.
This has never been done before *checks notes* unless you count ACA, while Trump has been supporting the GOP push to repeal this for the last 3.5 years.
Hating trump is easy. Admitting you contributed to genocide in Iraq and Afghanistan is hard. Most new allies fail that second test.
Trump speaks the truth.  You should try it.
Lmao. Imagine being this fucking stupid. üòπüòπüòπ #Trump
It‚Äôs worked for Trump so far
Trump signs more executive orders in first three years than Obama despite calling them 'power grabs' | The Independent
Don‚Äôt trust him. ‚Å¶  is a compulsive #Liar.  Trump teases order requiring insurers to cover preexisting conditions | TheHillI thought you all hated elitists? Tell us how he craps in a gold toilet too.   Le sigh, his base will still cheer when Donald Trump tells them not to go to college or any higher education. No wonder they love him. They have no critical thinking skills.
I'm not being critical, but ever since 2017, when Trump took office, over &amp; over again, people say, "this cannot stand/happen/be moral/legal/real" &amp; while the moral/legal aspects are true, it DOES stand &amp; it IS real.  Words &amp; opinions are important but only action produces change
You blindly back Trump, big problem
If anyone is trying to figure out how to submit fake mail-in ballots, I suspect it‚Äôs the trump admin.
Ya, &amp; that's only 40% of the jobs lost during  Covid disaster &amp; ignorance of controlling it!  If you're going to just pick facts that suit you, you're as much a conman as Trump if not more!
Trump campaign officials clearly haven't watched the disastrous attempts by Trump to speak without a teleprompter. He'll be destroyed by Biden, then fact checkers!  Trump campaign says Michigan voters deserve presidential debate before early voting starts
And to think about how many people, families &amp; organizations that could benefit from that  $1 Billion. Trump has no chance to win. It disgusts me the money used in campaigns while kids are starving &amp; homelessness is dramatically increasing! Pathetic!
Trump is obviously a nut case and im counting down until he‚Äôs out of office. But banning TikTok was a good move because China‚Äôs forsure using that user data to exploit the US ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. Do ya research bih
Obamacare has done this for years. ALREADY EXISTS in Obamacare. Trump Justice Dept. will argue at Supreme Court this coming fall to ABOLISH Obamacare.

If Pompeo talked to Russia about bounties, why didn't Trump?  via    I wonder. #Vote #BeAPollworker #volunteer
Like when trump denigrated gold star families? Or when he is talking about John McCain?   Being in the hospital for a month doesn‚Äôt say anything to you? And KAG is old. You wanna keep America with 50 million unemployed? A 34% drop in GDP? Even DJT changed it back to MAGA.
Successful entrepreneurs? Lmao! Trump has NEVER been successful! He‚Äôs a con man.
Why? The very second I read this title, I instantly thought of Trump running naked chasing mail-in votes in Nov. It's a sad state of affairs.
I sincerely doubt that, when the history of this debacle is written, it will be Dr. Birx who prevented the *Donald J. Trump* administration from mounting an effective response.
I actually agree. When you‚Äôre debating someone as factless as trump you can only hurt yourself. Trying to debunk people who you know aren‚Äôt playing by the rules is pointless
Pompeo believes the intel and Trump doesn't. Itll be interesting to see if Trump does anything about Pompeo's conversation.
She didn't write the article. The reporters who did write it point out that this is one of many examples where Trump's cabinet do things without Trump's knowledge or approval in order to get things done. Pompeo believes the bounty story. Trump does not.

Trump reminds me of Elmer Gantry.
What do you mean? After his pardon, he‚Äôs suckled on the Trump teat.
Know that, but... When a person has chosen to not learn more, has CLOSED their mind to other information, they're lost causes.  Also, my impression afterwards, he's ashamed of choosing trump, and instead... Attacked me for asking if he is still supporting 45. Best part? Shame.

Actually, a retired physician in Vail told me he 'would vote for Kanye before he's ever vote for Biden'. That's a lost cause.  Ignorance, no matter how educated and worldly - is a choice.  Told me I have a hard case of 'trump derangement syndrome'. Turns out I do.
Swear to god, there could be a video released of Joe Biden getting head from a child and y‚Äôall will STILL be like ‚Äúwell, he‚Äôs not Trump, so he gets my voteü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è‚Äù
I know it‚Äôs an early draft of the story and maybe the reporters will make that distinction as the story develops, but at least give readers a line that says something like ‚ÄúTrump‚Äôs support of Hong Kong protesters stands in stark contrast to his rhetoric against U.S. protesters.‚Äù
Joe Lockhart,  You sound just like Trump!
Seems odd to me that this story about Trump putting sanctions on China for cracking down on protesters fails to mention any of Trump‚Äôs own attempts to quash protesters in our country.
Imagine not only being okay with living in a fascist police state but supporting it by voting for Trump. Now keep that imaginary and not our reality and vote him out in November.
Finally a Trump campaign that I believe
We don't have any medical needs! As trump has said, many times, this is a fake virus.
And trump has been a huge disappointment to everyone.
trump is such a Christian. Even with all that adultery stuff.
As hard as you try to prove trump is right about 1 single thing, you fail.
Corruption and crime should be allowed to run rampant in the NRA. Maybe trump will bail them out.
No.  Do you know trump has 20,000 verifiable lies in 3.5 years?  Impressive.
I think there‚Äôs a part of Trump that also *likes* the authoritarian policies Xi can enact (e.g., censoring, punishing journalists he hates).  This situation is infuriating bc we could write policy protecting user data, regardless of company HQ location. But instead we punish
You're right Trump knows where he's at, La La Land.
Next thing you know, Trump is going to say he freed the slaves.
After 4 years I really don't care about the Obama administration, do you?I give a crap about what Trump has done. #TrumpIsALaughingStock
It's hard to believe a 70 plus your old man who runs an international company cannot pronounce Thailand. Time for Trump to go. #Thighland
If Kanye wants to help Trump, trumpsters need to send their votes to Kanye. They wouldn't know any better.

I would have a heart for the president if he showed he had one.  All he ever shows is his extreme narcissism as everything he talks, tweets &amp; thinks about concerns one thing-Donald J. Trump.  As to being exhausted, maybe he should stay off Twitter &amp; the golf course, &amp; do his job!
Trump/Kennedy
Trump + Putin and Russia, so old news.  Yawn.
A cognitive offense is a poor choice for a Trump supporter.  Lots of examples of Trump's own cognition not meeting the "Be Best" criteria.

The new executive order bans TikTok ‚Äì and chat tool WeChat ‚Äì under the National Emergencies Act and is set to take effect in 45 days.
Even they know they‚Äôre the baddies. (I genuinely believe this about Trump - he thinks that the Republicans are the baddies, even if most Republicans don‚Äôt.)
Evangelicals for Trump is the most head scratching shit I've ever heard. Can you be any more ignorant? Or are you literally stupid?
Leave it to CNN to spin this narrative.  I can't wait for the debates.  I could see them wanting to fight each other on stage.  Let's get ready to rumble!  Trump in round 2!  CNN's John King appears to defend Biden over former VP's 'diversity' remarks
Never said you were. Just making another observation about a group of people who support trump.

You can't be for real. You are not online pledging support for Donald Trump while calling the Democratic party "liars"! Are you? No, you can't be serious. There's no hidden cameras. No practical jokes? August fools prank? No, WOW! You've got some balls, lady!!!

Apparently Biden said something bad but I can‚Äôt find it because of all the asinine things Trump keeps saying about Biden steal up all the search terms. If Biden manages to pull this out, this will be a big reason why.
would like all of America to understand GOD is a Republican, l am not sure if he is registered to vote or not? Trump is an idiot
No but never Trump means never conservative.   Republican means Democrat light.  John McCain was a republican NOT a Conservative.  With all due respect.
Ah yes. Let's do Trump statistics by comparing two different values a city vs a state. ¬Ø\(¬∞_o)/¬Ø
Trump says Biden is going to beat up God. And the Bible.
We don't care, the goal is the complete removal, prosecution of the Trump crime syndicate.  Maybe, you just shhhhhh.  Anyone that believes Treason and child rape is acceptable, isn't a voice we want to hear from.  #ConsequencesForTrump

His answer was direct and straight to the point Krrllyanne, something Trump never does!
Trump want inside them thighs  lol
No one taking your guns.  He's an idiot, liar.  They're taking down the ppl who fraudulently abused the system.  Stolen money from NRA, and NOT AGAINST CITIZENS. Focus on trump, the child rapist, racist, liar and sexual predator.  Oh, he's committed several acts of TREASON.
Trump wants to hold little girls down instead.
Somehow I don't think  thinks never Trump means getting rid of his enablers
That thing (45) using words that he himself is guilty of, let me point out - Donald J Trump is a child rapist and sexual predator with ties to sex trafficking. There's not a God that's okay with 45.  Racist &amp; godless POS.
Orgs that endorse Trump and are not investigated: Committee to Defend the President, Great America Committee, Great America PAC, Nat'l Right to Life Committee, Log Cabin Republicans, Republican Jewish Coalition, National Assoc of Police Orgs.
Again, this has nothing to do with them endorsing Trump. Stealing millions from a not-for- profit is illegal in all cases. I guess you could demand the NRA make sweeping changes asap to avoid being dissolved, but they don't appear to want to do that.
Other associations endorse Trump and are safe from prosecution. It's not hard to run an association legally. No one put a gun to Wayne's head and made him funnel millions of $$ to himself a few others.
I sure do hope Trump invites God to the WH for a couple of burgers.
There's Growing Panic That Trump Will Rush A Vaccine To Save His Presidency. That's Unlikely.  45 needs swift, immediate removal from any and all power. He's a sick, dangerous, wounded mentally unbalanced, unfit, incompetent ANGRY racist, narcissist. üö´45üö´
Trump was impeached, his sycophants decided NOT to hold him accountable, but.. He's still impeached. Forever. We are saying, impeachment should prevent that person from any future elected office.  We're on the same side.  He's been let off, yet again. 162K dead. What # will it be
Still baffling that our choice is between an old white guy who chronically says wacky stuff and has been accused of sexual assault, and Trump
My 'like' was in a agreeing that an IMPEACHED person should not be allowed to run for Office.  I do agree with that.  I'm just unsure what  is saying.  Please, educate me?  I hate trump with the power of a supernova, and will do everything to save United States
Trump is the enemy because the people that voted for him,  &amp; support him now, wanted bad things for America &amp; he was the man to deliver-racism, misogyny, totalitarianism, ignorance, corruption, lack of respect for social norms &amp; institutions including the Constitution.
If by being an autocractic government w/ a capitalist economy &amp; zero interest in the Civil &amp; humanitarian rights of its citizenry, which is what China is, we're well on our way thanks to Trump &amp; his cronies.
we should test after meeting POTUS, perhaps Trump will understand corona virus and its impact once he has experienced first hand illness.
Fact check- Wuhan Virus came from fucking China, not Trump.
Everything he did was corrupt.  You listen to the media who protected him and never told of any of his acts.  Educate yourself.  Do not call me a racist.  Just because I support President Trump who also is not racist, does not make me one.  It is my pleasure to block you.

Trump's first priority is to open schools and not your child's life.
Mr West is not well, he's being manipulated by trump admin and he needs mental health intervention. The Office for The President of the United States demands mental health, as well as a high degree of knowledge, we've discovered a lifelong grifter remains that, Ye needs help.
White House wants the 1200 Trump signed checks and endangered Senate Rs want to go home asap with something tangible as well. Nancy will get close to her number on unemployment with perhaps something more thrown in (post office?).
Colorado will go for Trump and Corey G.
Did you see trump f*ck up the HBO/Axios interview? Boy, that was an embarrassment.
Let's see. Who is the Chief misleader? Trump with 20,000 verifiable lies?
I would think that this lawsuit cannot get any traction. Voting by mail is perfectly legal &amp; Trump is fine w/ it in states he expects votes from people who would benefit from voting by mail in FL, AZ, etc.  &amp; the fact that it involves his vested interest in the election outcomes
Trump would get upset when some particularly curated fact he armed himself with was factually challenged &amp; disproven.  He would sulk &amp; say, "You can't do that!"like a spoiled toddler &amp; walk off stage if things weren't going his way.  Trump doesn't function well in the real world.
You are seriously bringing up Biden's inability to read prepared material? You need to be careful when you say things like this given the endless recordings of Trump stumbling over words, going off the cuff in the most disastrous ways &amp;/or reading everything in a stoned monotone.
It's wildly telling when all a Trump supporter has in his arsenal is Joe Biden whataboutism. If you can't genuinely defend the actual man &amp; his actions &amp; can only turn to casting untrue aspersions on his opponent, what does that reveal about your candidate &amp; your support of him?
We can hope the streak continues, but Trump's fundraising edge is disturbing.
Sorry you misspelled Donald Trump!
I spent 35 years carrying mail. And in my own not especially worried what the bosses thought way, I tried my damnedest to get it right for my customers. So to watch Trump and his suck-up postmaster general play games with it... fuck those fucking motherfuckers and etc. etc.
Although I‚Äôm an non believer I respect his beliefs. Unlike trump who only worships money and himself.
He appeals to the low brow, rural, under educated by playing on their fears and insecurities. It's the southern states that seem to appreciate Trump for some reason. I'm not knocking all southerners, but his supporters give them a bad name
Yeah, &amp; he said you can't do that. If we do it by population, there'll be more deaths shown &amp; he knows it. I love how Swan didn't back down to Trump. We need more like him
You wouldn't know science if you were snorting it up your nose. TRUMP 2020!!!

Makes sense. Voting rights are not vital in Trump's America.
To me, this was one of the nuttier things Trump said this week, yet it's getting little press. It's basically one step away from a mob shakedown. "It would be a shame if something would happen to your lovely business here."
Also interesting to compare this week's numbers with a year ago. In August 2019, 15% of voters said they would vote 3rd party or not vote, but that was only 10% in August 2020. That 5% went to Trump and the Democrat lost 1% to him as Trump votes went 67% ‚û°Ô∏è 73% over that year.
Here's the same thing charted by number of producers that voted. Although support for Trump was the highest in the Feb. poll at 79%, you can also see that there were the fewest voters.  I think the trend in number of voters is interesting. Fewer votes today than a year ago.
üá∫üá∏U.S. farmers' support for Donald Trump in the upcoming Presidential Election is unwavering as 73% this week said they will vote for him.  Joe Biden captured slightly more interest this time than he did 3 months ago.  Here are the full results from all 6 quarterly "elections":

The Democrats have zero interest in helping the American people or their kids in this pandemic. That is obvious by their actions. The only thing they are focused on is bringing Trump down at any cost. They could care less about the folks.
So he can try and avoid questions by pulling out all of his ridiculous statistics that really mean absolutely nothing. Appreciate this video bc I don‚Äôt normally see many people challenge trump over and over like that.
The question is, will democrats continue screaming like idiots and ruining this country for another 4 yrs when Pres Trump is re-elected? Or finally work together to make things better?

Trump = Lies There's no way around this.  They. ALL. Lie.
Shh . . . Don't tell Trump that.
Anyone else want to hear Donald Trump pronounce all the names of America's parks?
I don't care anymore, fuck you Donald Trump. Get the hell out of our government
Naked Trump
Trump had NO PLAN other than #ItIsWhatItIs #RemoveTrumpNow #Invoke25
If Trump supports it, its 1000% because of is floundering approval ratings.
dude what are you even talking about? he‚Äôs saying that in proportion to population, the united states has a far higher death toll and trump says no you can‚Äôt you do that you have to follow the charts. did you even watch the video?üòÇ
The Pandemic Is Damaging the GOP Brand Everywhere  Pretty sure if Trump wasnt a racist rapist POS, we wouldn't be here now.  Can't blame pandemic on the blatant ugliness, divisiveness and hatred he's encouraged. #WearADamnMask #RemoveTrumpNow #WeWantJoe
Lolwat - Vince drinking that Trump koolaid I see
Looks like trump will be selling off our National Parks in exchange for some develop-able land for his company.
And we are all very familiar with trump's mental state.
Please amplify the point: Trump vehimantly complains about US case count being higher than every other country due to testing, then uses that comparitvely high case count to incorrectly contend that US has low fatality per case!  Isn't that illogically/not consistent?

Translation: If you want a leader who's honest w/ you, cares about you, and works daily for you instead of for himself, vote Biden. If you're good with mental illness, fraud, corruption &amp; impeached as "president" vote Trump. No don't!
Watching the Trump interview stoned. One star on Yelp. Not recommended.
It‚Äôs absolutely mind-blowing to me that it‚Äôs taken this long for Trump interviewers not to stoop to his level and pander to his childishness. I guess that‚Äôs one positive takeaway from these past couple of interviews...? Maybe?
The Trump interview on Epstein maybe being murdered, and on Ghislaine Maxwell has been all over twitter. But it occurs to me that pronouncing her name jze-laine avoids putting jizz in her name, thus preventing problems with the thirteen year old boys in the audience. (and me)
Likely. What comes out of the Trump Campaign that isn't?
Not to quibble, but when Jonathan Swan tells Trump mail-in voting goes back to the Civil War, I'm thinking - the First Civil War. (Pot can make you a touch paranoid.)
Blocked!  I cleaned up my entire Following list yesterday, and only UN-F those that didn't follow me, and I lost 25 ppl!  What the heck?  I spend more time it's than anyone.  (thought that in trump's whine) I'll FB soon as allowed! #Resist #UnitedNotDivided
Trump 2020...
Trump in the interview: "I've done things no other president's done..."  Okay, I will concede that point.
Listening to the Trump interview while stoned:  Trump: The world is a very angry place...I see twenty two soldiers killed in India..." Me: How do these ants know where to go next?  I think my research is going to be inconclusive.
Whiner Trump.
Trump's interview stoned - Most of the weird stuff is already out on twitter, but now he's Trumpsplaining to Swan "Just so you understand, Russia used to be the Soviet Union, until they went bankrupt..." And my god does Trump talk fast when he's nervous.
They will keep it up nonstop to distract from the damage that Biden is doing to the country - and of course blaming everything that happens on Trump.
Watching Trump's interview stoned - Ratings? Christ, what a double colossal asshole.
Five minutes into watching Trump's interview stoned. Normally I'd be thinking - Christ, what an asshole.  Stoned it seems more like -  Christ, what a colossal asshole.
Can someone make a compilation of Jonathon Swan's face each time Trump says some bullshit?
Can Trump ever actually answer a question without getting distracted?  "what do you think of this couch?"  "I think many things. Some people say I'm the best at thinking things. Some things - the big things - they need the right thinking. And we're doing great."  "...what?"
The numbers don't lie, so Trump lies about the numbers, but he's so flummoxed trying to do it he's not even coherent.  #covid19 #coronavirus #election2020 #resist
Nice of Trump to really deliver on content for
Yep we the people r speaki!!!! TRUMP 2020!!!!
Post a photo or we just consider this another trump family lie. Have fun in prison!
Exactly. He‚Äôs totally comfortable but also knows exactly when to give the doses of sympathy Trump requires to stay in the room.
He is letting trump campaign on his behalf, and trump is actually doing a great job for a change.
I thought trump was king? Second coming of Jesus?
The best expression from a reporter interviewing Trump I‚Äôve seen thus far!! The looks says it all üëèüëèüëè
I really like that interviewer. He seems to have a different level of relationship with Trump than most. Still made for a brutally embarrassing pile of shit from Trump. But good interview.
Anyone that watched either of those interviews and thought ‚Äúhe‚Äôs got it under control‚Äù needs to checked by a doctor. Trump looked shaken, disorientated, and was lying to get himself out of lies that he had just lied. #TrumpIsLosing #TrumpIsACompleteFailure
ALL YOU STUPID ASS DONALD TRUMP SUPPORTERS WHY ARE YOU LETTING A BAD UGLY DISGUSTING RACIST PERSON TAKE CHILDREN AWAY FROM THEIR PARENTS AND DEPORT INNCOCENT PEOPLE FROM THEIR HOME. POOR BABIES ARE DYING AND YOU STUPID DONALD TRUMP SUPPORTERS ARE SUPPORTING HIM #AbolishICE

When Trump croaks, no one respectable will speak at his funeral, and I bet Congress refuses to let him lie in state at the Capitol.
If I were a Trump supporter I would be so pissed.
And the alternative given the state of our country and the current isn‚Äôt changing right now then what do you suggest.  Yes we know Biden not good, but trump i would literally rather have my dogs shit as prez than trump.  So vote Biden and let‚Äôs fix our shit after we remove psycho
Just so you know, every Trump/GOP ad you see online costs them money per click...
You‚Äôre a liar. Can‚Äôt believe anything a trump says.
Im not saying that Trump is guilty of anything but if we‚Äôre using this logic then Trump is screwed my association ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
You do know that Epstein‚Äôs sex trafficking was not limited to his island, right? You do know that Trump stated In a 2002 statement in New York Magazine, Trump said ‚ÄúI‚Äôve known Jeff for fifteen years. Terrific guy . . .‚Äù
That‚Äôs it, I‚Äôm saying it now. I will not vote for Biden if he doesn‚Äôt debate Trump. I won‚Äôt help elect someone who can‚Äôt hold their ground against Trump. If Biden can‚Äôt now, how can he face China and Russia as tensions escalate?
They want to believe the world is as simple as Trump's mind and that they can understand it.
Don't understand why everyone is getting so worked up over a big hoax. The #FakeNews will stop reporting about this when #Trump is reelected and it will all go away
DISTURBED? NO! Not until I clicked on the picture to see what was so disturbing!, now YES! VERY! WTF? I keep saying that it's not hard to point out Trump supporters, I rest my case.
Or call it Fraud. Or let's imagine Trump in handcuffs, January 2021.
Oh look, a bunch of fraud investigations for the Trump companies!   "We had no clue!"*  *nobody
I think you have it backwards, since he gave this speech during the Trump presidency &amp; referenced the difficult times &amp; quoted a poem about finding truth.  Additionally, the presidential character he played in the West Wing was a Democrat as is Sheen himself, a liberal activist.
Eric, you lost me at claiming you have a friend. For a Trump, you can't lie worth shit.
Eric, you lost me at claiming you have a friend. For a Trump, you can't lie worth shit.
Zero to my knowledge. Also, voter fraud in America is statistically insignificant &amp; the same is true in states w/ widespread voting by mail. The last very public example of voter fraud was from Rep. Steve Watkins of KS, a Trump supporter &amp; he was caught:
Eric, you lost me at "from a friend". For a Trump, you can't lie worth shit.
All my friends who voted for Trump last time are voting for Biden this time! Vote
(donates it to a Trump shell charity)
Stone publicly the Trump administration and exile them to another country.  I never liked Turkey.
I'm sorry. Trump is to blame for the crisis and deaths. More, many many more to follow.  I'm so sorry.
It‚Äôs been an attack on consciousness, an attack on the heart of the universe, on humanity  We think life is ‚Äònormal‚Äô and that‚Äôs part of the deep conditioning  Ye knows this because he got to the top and looked around only to find soullessness  Probably the same deal with trump

Dear NYT: or we could restructure the debates to force DIALECTIC--the very thing D. Trump is yearning for: a reasoned, drawn out discussion of facts and ideology. :-)
Twitter has become my release valve, had to deactivate Facebook, someone I work with occasionally told my BF he needs, 'to reign her in, she can't make everyone hate trump'. Dagnabbit, I was TRYING!  My Twitter friends are just smarter.    Together, #UnitedNotDivided

We are in CO and my husband will not let me wear my Trump hat for this reason.   I know all this state are not libs but you have to be careful.  God bless this man.
It's amazing how easily you can point out Trump supporters! It's almost like they wear a sign on their foreheads. "MAGA-MORON"
There is no swaying the Trump base.
TRUMP - A FAKE PRESIDENT IS THE ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE.    You are sad.
WOW!! TRUMP IS A FAKE PRESIDENT AND ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE. FAILED GAME SHOW HOST, ADULTERER, AND DIM-WITTED!!!  Pandemic killing more people in the U.S. thanks to Trump‚Äôs no-handling!Sad...
Trump has the better constitutional argument in excluding illegal aliens from the #Census. If illegal aliens are ex¬≠cluded CA, AZ, TX &amp; FL will likely loose seats in Congress. While IN, MI, PA &amp; OH will likely gain seats ~
Nobody likes voting by mail anyway. I would rather spend hours in a voting line with a bunch of virus filled strangers. Go trump.
Remember the middle class tax cut trump announced on election eve, 2018? His healthcare plan will be promised election eve, 2020. Except nobody will buy it.
Always comparing himself to President Obama, because Obama was a great president, Trump, loser.
Nobody is working overtime to make trump look bad.
Trump will kill everyone.  President Biden will remove the 1% tax cut donald gave out.
Right... Democrats manufacture chaos for 4 years and blame Trump. We can't have this for 4 more years! Everyone sees it. Even the few normal liberals.
And the trump healthcare plan is............................................................................................??

Said the one deceived by Fuhrer Trump. You are a piece of work, Little Marco.
Your a vast disappointment to Colorado voters. Your silence about the Russian bounties on our service members in Afghanistan is as disgraceful as trump‚Äôs support of it.
who is a trump supporter so u know my identity is politically incongruent with her. Oh and either way, she is wanting to put up our cat Nemo for adoption, which genuinely breaks my heart. So I‚Äôm having to become An Adult very quickly which is horrifying!!!
Well I may not go that far but I will crawl on broken glass to pull that leaver for President Donald Trump who is the best President in my lifetime.  God bless.
Lol We are literally in an unprecedented time with regards to the pandemic, and Howard will always speak his mind...  and yes Trump has done a piss poor job and people are dying.  Whats more relevant than that?
Started watching Hamilton last night. Man, they did all that singing and dancing and two hundred forty  years later we still got Trump.
Trump said Friday the Chinese-owned video app TikTok will be banned in the U.S., which he said he can do through emergency economic powers or an executive order.
Administration is leading the way in empowering women and girls. ~The Hill  Yeah, heard all about Trump and the girls.  More than enough actually.
If Trump or his super PACs have to buy advertising in Texas, it's a win for Biden.
Want to bet trump's name is also on there, or was removed? 26+ sexual assault allegations against trump, one against Biden. trump wins again!!! He is such a fine adulterer.
Getting rid of trump will be a return to normalcy, except for the fact the republican party will be completely displaced.
But trump wants to be a dictator! You could have your supreme leader in charge all the time! Wouldn't it be lovely?
trump has invested a wall into the Latino communities. They love him.
Yes, Latinos are voting for trump, because, you know. Wall.
SHE SHOULD MOVE TO CUBA IF SHE LIKE'S IT SO MUCH WHY ARE WE TRAINING EDUCATING COMMUNIST. TRUMP SHOULD SHUT THIS DOWN.
It is sad that Trump has to incite violence in America
Yep, blame trump for all things the left has caused.
Neither you nor your supporters have any class. Also, this is a direct example of how the way that you carry yourself transfers down through to your supporters. Trump, his administration, and his supporters are an absolute threat to our society.
Trump went golfing again today...we're up to 8,600 dead Americans per hole.   Hope he had a nice round.
So this is when Trump and his administration want to start worrying about the coronavirus‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm confused though how are we sending children back into school if they can‚Äôt even hold a convention without fears of Covid?

Birx on Trump live camera quote:  "He's been so attentive to the scientific literature . . . ".  Come on,  David.  And she sat there silent during the bleach quote.  There is more.
So true
It seems that Trump is really bad at making deals.
Endorsed by Trump and Qanon? Maybe get Alex Jones and make it a trifecta.
Endorsed by Trump and Qanon? Maybe get Alex Jones and make it a trifecta.
Opposite of what  said. The chaos IS the DNC campaign strategy. It will end after Pres Trump‚Äôs re-election. If Biden wins by fraud, the newly emboldened communist wannabes will not stop until democrats are taken out too. You see, anyone can throw out a statement.
I'm convinced that "MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN &amp; LAW &amp; ORDER" are secret codes for Putin. Trump tweets them &amp; it covertly signals Putin to turn on a sat phone, or to call Trump, something. He tweets these at the most random times &amp; almost always alone. Its suspicious.
Sean Hannity is NOT A JOURNALIST! He is nothing but an OPINION commentator who's been given a right-wing cheerleader in Trump. He's been given a soapbox by Trump, &amp; people think he's reporting news rather than expressing his opinion &amp; ONLY his opinion! Inform yourselves!
Republicans are just now figuring out that maybe trump isn't so great for the Party as they all originally thought.
Who put you in masks?  Who shut down your state?  Who has opened states?  Republicans!  Who still has their people in masks and in lockdown?  Democrats!  So much corruption in the Democrat party and they want President Trump out because he is exposing them.
When the revenue dries up from the Secret Service, I bet trump goes bankrupt. Again.
The republican party too much of an embarrassment for Buck? trump has permanently doomed the republican party.
Dr. uncle trump is much smarter than Dr. Fauci.
Of course they will! They accepted aid from Ukraine! Azzhole trump was impeached forever because of this.
Look at those people blaming trump for all of this disaster. It was someone else.
trump stands for adultery, crime, lying 20,000 times in 3.5 years, death, misery, complete destroyed the economy like his other 6 businesses, moron, have to pay people to take his SAT's, racist, white power supporter.
Not buying it. Trump knows the only way for him to stay out of prison is to win re-election -- however unlikely that looks now.
What? You wrote a book? Crazy! I honestly thought that none of you guys could read! I was assuming that you couldn't possibly defend/support Trump if you could read about the things he does &amp; says, or be able to read his tweets. Well, Im sure its shit anyways. (in my opinion)
Have you asked yourself what it is about Trump that creates so much ire and hostility? Has any President every voiced such disdain and hatred towards any group of Americans? I‚Äôm sorry supporting a racist, ill mannered, negligent and dishonest person is a burden on you.
Is it possible Trump's administration will end with DT giving a full and complete pardon to HIMSELF?
THAT'S SUCH A COINCIDENCE! Trump no longer has a base either. He used to, while folks decided whether or not he was a trustworthy leader, but they now know what an incompetent sociopath he is! President Biden will actually start get rid of the corruption Trump was!
Thank God Fox News has no integrity, or journalistic professionalism otherwise they wouldn't purposely misinform America! If you see this &amp; actually want factual data, Google ANY poll you want besides Foxs'. Then you'll get the info you need, NOT what Trump wants you to have.
Don't believe Fox News &amp; right wing media telling you  has any chance in Nov. You can tell he knows it as well by saying mail-in ballots fraudulent &amp; saying the election should be postponed. Trying to scare us into voting Trump. NOT GOING TO WORK!
Okay, okay I see what your doing! This IS a blame my opponent for what I do. B/C no one has any fear of  having nuclear codes, but the fear of a desperate man w/ mental illness &amp; is addicted to the power he currently has, Trump is a clear &amp; present danger to America!
You think Trump is going to debate bro? He is trying to make the election not even happen!
Are you kidding?!?! Obama wore a tan suit once and Trump committed treason and continues to defraud America with his 3 day golf trips every 4 days. Nevermind all trump‚Äôs racist policies or destructive relationship management with our NATO partners.Why does Trump think people care about him watching sports or not lol   Like a lot of people wouldn‚Äôt cared if you died fr so
Golfing and lying. What else is new with trump?
Who is trump kidding? He is suing against ACA which protects people with preexisting medical conditions in our courts right now. WTF?
If you‚Äôre wondering, it‚Äôs probably conceivable. For me it doesn‚Äôt come instantaneously, but for example: the night trump was elected, I said to my wife ‚ÄúI hope the Russians didn‚Äôt have anything to do with this.‚Äù
Trump be like ‚ÄúI‚Äôm gonna repeal Obamacare but ensure they do all the same things and call it Trumpcare‚Äù
"Twenty-three postal executives were reassigned or displaced...Analysts say the structure centralizes power around DeJoy, a former logistics executive and major ally of President Trump, and de-emphasizes decades of institutional postal knowledge."

Delusional! Biden is working on plans to bring us out of this depression we‚Äôre in. Trump is whining like a little bitch because no one likes him. What‚Äôs there to debate?
And fucking trump can? You obviously haven‚Äôt been watching trump speak!
I‚Äôve had two people tell me that Beyonc√© stans are like Trump supporters and that is so WILDLY disrespectful
The Dems will exploit the Chinese Virus for political purposes until November 3 when President Trump wins the election. Afterward, they‚Äôll move on to the next fantasy designed to remove a President who can‚Äôt be bought, which is what the Dems, RINOs and Deep State hate about him.
Wow wtf is this guy? He is starting to show symptoms. Of Trump syndrome. Where is the vaccine for this?
You are WRONG.  People who pay cash (i.e. no other coverage) pay the most. The ACA established protection for pre-existing conditions. Trump and his congressional followers have tried repeatedly to repeal these protections. McCain put country over party.
Big Joe!  No, you actually don‚Äôt.  I love you to death man but don‚Äôt fall victim to the Trump Tweeting.  Please just let the man sink himself.
Bullshit. You republicans just can‚Äôt quit with the lying. Following trump‚Äôs example.
Wishful thinking Dave, Trump supporters are more jazzed up than ever to vote and support this President, save the physco-babble for the classroom. üòä
The great divider is the orange clown sitting in the White House right now. What caused division while Obama was in office is white people who couldn‚Äôt accept &amp; resented the fact that a black man was elected president. One of those people was the birther trump. No surprise there.
Trump loves the illiterate.
He can‚Äôt breathe in a mask bc he‚Äôs exhausted from kissing Trump‚Äôs butt

Man. Dinesh really picks weird hills to die on. I'd bet 99.9% of the time, Trump pronounced it "Tie-land" like everyone else. That might be why he immediately corrected himself. Now what? Dinesh is gonna tell us that the 99.9% of the time is the time Trump is a dumbshit?
definitely Trump all the way!!!  100%
So when Trump smashes a cheeseburger on his head and pours Diet Coke on his lap, do the rest of his WH enablers at the table smoosh their scalps with fettucine and douse their crotches with Chianti to show that there is nothing wrong with Cheeto-Face's behavior?
This administration is pretty damn transparent with their vindictive retribution.....you think we buy this?  China wants Trump to lose the election.
Oddly the Chinese want Trump to lose, and Russian is doing their damnest to see that Trump wins....so, your post his is VERY suspicious!
I blame President Trump for failing us and not having a federal strategic plan on how to deal with this ongoing pandemic, Debbie.
Well, teachers are indirectly responsible for the situation we are in. 60 million people voted for Trump. Obviously, teachers failed with them, not teaching criticak thinking skills or civic education. Teachers need to take responsibilty for this.
I used to respect you and your perspectives. Now all I do is shake my head and wonder when you started to drink the trump koolaid.  Shame on you.

I‚Äôm afraid Schumer and the Dems are going to perpetuate the lie when schools open up and post a bunch of fake numbers about how many kids are infected and then turn it right back around on Trump. I put nothing past these slime balls
It‚Äôll probably take Joe a while to get the Trump economy back on track too.

How is Trump our only hope?  He‚Äôs hurt this country in so many ways.  Deregulation of food manufacturing standards led to the largest amount of food recalls we‚Äôve seen.  China tariffs left American farmers hurting more than they have since the Great Depression.
This clan has the time and the money to monitor him every day. I‚Äôm disappointed that they aren‚Äôt doing more given the political damage this guy is leaving in his wake, unless they see themselves as the the next trump family. Then it all makes sense.
Biden for President ads are truly despicable. That crying lady blaming her grandma‚Äôs death on President! President Trump initiated the travel ban within 10 days of the first case while every other leader shamed him.
Biden is a puppet socialist whose strings are being pulled by Sanders, Warren and AOC in Congress and by the CCP in China. He‚Äôs a genuine Manchurian Candidate. Vote Trump and Republican in November. Save our constitutional republic from the militant socialists, i. e., communists.

"The R party has completely cowtowed to Trump and has no cajones to stand up like men and women and do anything which might make him mad. Therefore we will get nothing done." Fixed it.
Well, put an idiot in charge and you‚Äôll get pure idiocy. Trump never disappoints on that front.
Donald Trump claims Joe Biden is 'against God;' Biden aides call Trump a hypocritical divider  trump continues to be vile and disoriented. He is clueless when he is attempting to attack anyone he cares to. Just a pouty child.
You mean the ones from Trump that say Catholics don‚Äôt believe in God?
Ridiculous. TRUST the man. Trump is destroying our democracy. Thanks heavens thinking like yours is limited to media wanting a attention.
It is a ploy by the Trump organization so people vote for him instead of Biden which takes votes away to help trump win. It's another desperate way that Trump is trying to cheat the election, pathetic and ridiculous

One issue voters are only interested in removing trump. All of the pontificating in the world will not make any VP running mate more impactful on the presidential race than the last.
Trump is getting desperate with his off the wall statements. The man is in melt down. More than when he heard of covid-19.
Television news organizations fearful of excoriating trump for his relentless machinations and lies, have a tendency to overcompensate by playing news clips of trump repetitively, hoping to salvage ratings. All it does is piss off people who find him abhorrent, and there are many

"Slowing" and "decreasing" are two completely different concepts.   This is pretty basic.  Your argument is lot like trump bragging about the unemployment numbers going down the past month after rising to historic levels due to his inept handling of this crisis.

that is so NOT true, the members of his party are ONLY pretending to pull the chain to make themselves look good for votes, because they know the war will soon be over for them. They do not care about what trump does, and proven it time and again. They are desperate.
Many many instances where money does not buy the election. Trump's messages are blatant lies and not worthy of a fake reality personality.

Joe Biden will not show up in person to stand 6+ feet away from Trump and debate him for 90 minutes. He‚Äôs not capable of pulling it off, and everyone knows it. Excuses will be made, he‚Äôll blame Trump, the media will comply, etc., but he won‚Äôt do it.
Our Country is in Shambles because of Donald Trump!
Officials in the Trump administration have been rightly referring to the government in China as "The Chinese Communist Party" or CCP, not just as "Chinese government." This is apt. A communist is always a communist, and that must never be forgotten.
All she has done as AG is investigate Trump, meanwhile NY has become a crime ridden third world country.
Facebook has NO scientific expertise to dispute any thing President Trump says. There is absolutely no settled science on the coronavirus virus. It may be years before we have scientific data that the scientists agree upon.

Nothing in Trump's actions or speaches says competence or ability. The man is so out of his league or ability. If America needs to vent, do so on this fricking moron.
Alas, you're a faux president, so it all works out. Though I would sooner trust Jim Acosta on reporting the news than Donald Trump on leading this Nation.
A "friend" of mine feels that he is "protecting his children" by sending them to school. He believes that the media is creating fear that it's going to cost more lives than the virus, that masks don't work and of course he is a Trump supporter. Choices have consequences
Biden wants to re engage with Iran. This is against Trump policy. His surrogate, John Kerry has been meeting them privately. They are our sworn enemy. If Biden wins and one of his transition team reaches out to Iran informing of a new policy direction should this be Logan Act ?

Side with trump
You, Biden, said racism is "baked into" Trump's campaign.... And class warfare is baked into yours and that's inextricably linked to the very same racism. It's why we hate you too, Biden, sir.
Do you have any video of that?  What he said about blacks and Hispanics was not near as  racist as what Trump says.
Trump your misleading the people u know that mail in ballots dount commit fraud u even mailed one yourself and so has your wife so I wouldn't be talking there donnie tweety
Politically, what do you believe is the alternative? Are Joe Biden and the Democrat platform more Christ like? I see you don't like Trump. (Me either) just curious what you think is a better option with our choices?
Well you will have to try again in 2024, Trump‚Äôs not going anywhere, we will make sure of that on Nov. 3rd!
No my iPhone has its own brain I guess.  Trump‚Äôs  got this.

Hi again. Trump is the worst. He can‚Äôt read. He can‚Äôt fuckin talk. He sounds like marlon Brando with peanut butter stuck to the roof of his mouth. He does nothing but suck off big business and his racist, violent, fascist voters. He‚Äôs makes everyone around him lose iq points. Thx
You have to be a double standard liberal troll to dig for that reasoning. This is where your hypocrisy screams of brainwashed. If Trump said that you would be calling him all kinds of names but because he's in your party you give him a pass. Same standards for all? Nope

The DNC doesnt want a good candidate. They want a candidate they can control that is 'good enough' to win. RNC did the same thing until Trump forced their hand. Unfortunately politics almost never allow the best person for a position to win. Its all a game for power.

The greatest crime in American history was the Trump administration letting COVID-19 run rampant because they thought it would only effect "blue" states, and they would simply blame the governors.
How can you ignore Trump who's obviously deteriorating physically/mentally and a huge danger to the country. We have zero leadership at a time when we need it the most. A MajLdr historically has more power than a president but you've traded that for personal gain.
All you can talk about is the Outdoors Act, Yes, it's nice, but without health/economy what difference does it make. 59 co-sponsors, so you're not the only one. At the same time you ignore Trump who's obviously deteriorating physically/mentally and a huge danger to the country.

I read she had an agreement in 2016, but by Trump winning, she had to wait. I also read she had no plans to ever move to the White House, she was forced to.  Can‚Äôt remember where I read it, so I can‚Äôt vouch for the contents. If it‚Äôs true, she‚Äôll be divorced in 2021.
With almost 1000 deaths a day Trump says IT IS WHAT IT IS!!!!   remove him, help put a national plan in place. Late a January is too late for tens of thousands...

But hey,  let‚Äôs keep hearing how Biden can‚Äôt read or talk. Biden has a stutter, something millions have, what‚Äôs Trump‚Äôs excuse?
Yes  Trump
I don‚Äôt understand why   and  aren‚Äôt doing anything about it. Trump looks weaker and sicker everyday. His right side definitely looks like he had a stroke.   If it were my dad, I‚Äôd step in.
B.F.D. !!!! The party formerly known as democrats have retaliated against EVERYTHING  Trump attempts and accomplishes! All members of the Radical Islamic Jihad/Sharia Law supporting¬† Socialist party. Formerly known as "democrats" And all TOO IGNORANT to care about TRUTH!
You mean Yo-semite. Like trump says
Yes, of course. Everything else has failed to remove Trump, this a last ditch effort.
Lets just be honest here, John Lewis was a not a saint, he did not like President Trump. To pretend that he (Lewis) was above reproach is both hypocritical and dishonest. He was human, and while his cause was noble, he, himself was not without fault.

I don‚Äôt care if Biden never answers another question. Biden isn‚Äôt petty - let blue states die - or stupid, Trump is stupid.   Biden hasn‚Äôt been accused of rape several times including the rape of a 13 year old.

Welfare state was slashed by Clinton. Bush tax cuts were made permanent by Obama. Interpretation of the patriot act remained unchanged under Obama. The republicans do awful shit, the democrats normalize it. That‚Äôs how we got trump

Our country has been like this, trump just gave them permission to come out of the closet and act on their hate!

Retweet to defeat trump and put him and his family in prison
One of the reasons the Dems want to keep Biden from debating Trump is the questions it will raise about Joe. Like who will actually be running the government? Certainly not this guy... Does he even know what year it is?
Then again, Bush isn't Trump.
Another in a long line of Trump‚Äôs mob-boss responses. Trump doesn‚Äôt see himself as king as much as ‚ÄúCapo‚Äù...‚Äù

Imagine being so desperate to appease Trump you make claims that are not true. No doctor has said HCL should be "banned", only that it does not help.
We are 1,370 days into Trump‚Äôs 1st term and Chuck Schumer still thinks getting rid of Trump at any cost is more important than doing the People‚Äôs work.   Chuck has held the People‚Äôs Work hostage.  He has dumbed down the Senate with constant politics and very little compromise.

Trump and the  are failures. None of what you all have ruined could be called a success.   You have no conscience.
Trump didn't win with most votes. Only reason he won was our archaic EC. If EVERY vote counted, he would've lost badly.
153,000 dead Americans with a possible 200,000 dead by Labor Day is NOT a success for Trump.   Why do you continue to think it is?   There were americans in China as part of Obama‚Äôs pandemic team.Trump and Bolton dismantled that office! Why do U keep hiding that?
Trump‚Äôs plan is non existent!!!! Look at what a huge failure. 150,000 dead!!  We‚Äôre you dropped on your head?? Are you living in the same country as the rest of us??? There is no plan and Trump is a failure, not a success.

Using Trump as a way to advocate for this topic seems as bad to me as pro-lifers using Kanye when he is in the middle of psychological crisis. Ultimately it will probably backfire and not help to achieve the goals you are seeking to advance.
Fewer Trump voters, I guess.
Trump will have to have irrefutable evidence. Secretaries of states are easily offended by charges of voter fraud in their yards.
40 percent of the country will vote Trump no matter what. Those people don‚Äôt blame Trump. If they didn‚Äôt think Trump was incompetent before they won‚Äôt think it now.   Also America is a federal system. People here are arguing about whether it‚Äôs Trumps fault or the governors.

If you are not voting for Biden you are voting for Trump.
Not for nothing, but  was told repeatedly holding his rally was a bad idea.   Hardly anyone showed up and Herman Cain caught Covid 19 and passed away.   Trump just doesn‚Äôt listen, and he is not that swift. No wonder we are where we are.
AND healthcare is EXTREMELY important. Not medicare for all. Trump is doing everything in his power to get rid of healthcare!
If you get trump you lose all healthcare. So choose your poison. We are losing our Democracy under trump right now. It will be gone if he wins. Welcome to living under a Dictator. You didn't burst my bubble. Single payer is what we should be pushing!
Yep. I want healthcare too. I know it is an issue. But those that won't for Biden because he won't back Medicare for all, well Trump wins. Then you get nothing. He will dismantle ACA. So you are willing to put trump in office for 4 more years (or more) for one issue?
Trump does not have the authority to delay the election. It‚Äôs not his call. He‚Äôs distracting from other bad news for him - GDP, COVID. Don‚Äôt take the bait.
Was trump invited ?
Big news day. Epstein documents released. Every former President except trump will be at John Lewis funeral, Obama to deliver eulogy. Worse GDP ever.   Trump moving election a distraction.

Obama did this years ago and trump has been trying to end it for his entire term in office. This is a total and complete scam They are already covered
There is a mechanism at large that put the Trump at helm. It wants to leave no stranded asset like oil underground. It doesn't accept the fact that Nature Large keeps Earth. Well the fact is Earth Biosphere acts as Zeroth Law third. Between brilliance of the Sun and Earth sky OK.

Anyone dumb and arrogant enough to have a huge pool party during a pandemic is possibly dumb enough to support Trump.  My assumption is based on logic.  Funny how you assume rioters are protestors.
She said that before anyone knew anything about the virus. You know this yet you continue this narrative. After we learned more, Trump and his benighted followers still refused to wear masks, still had big pool parties, still went to rallies, Daytona, etc.

This is the whole reason for seperation between Church &amp; State. So no candidate can claim to be "Gods chosen candidate". Trump is trying to anoint himself as such because you may dislike him, but a vote for him is a vote for God...
You can't be happy if you worship money and power above all.  Just look at Trump; a picture of misery.

Trump's religious when it comes to his little, tiny eternity and his minuscule immortal soul.  He'll accept Jesus if that means he can get into Heaven.  He's terrified of Hell.  Other than that he doesn't have much use for religion.

Paul Manafort chose Pence when Paul was Trump's campaign manager.   There's only one reason Manafort would do that.  Pence is compromised and they can control him.  I guess there's some things Mother doesn't know.
A Reagan/Bush Republican is an entirely different breed from a Trump Republican.
Someone please explain this to me like I‚Äôm a 5 year old:  How does giving $ to USPS help secure vote by mail... when there‚Äôs a Trump flunkie currently in charge and, no doubt, his one assignment is to do everything he can to screw with vote by mail‚ÅâÔ∏è
Dear Republican party leaders, your complete failure to lead and your dedication to Trump over everything that is good, decent, and once American, has created this health crisis and the tearing down of American ideals in the process.

what wii prevent Trump from selling all of our Natl Security info to Putin after he loses in Nov? If he hasn‚Äôt done so already? Another Snowden or TrumpDump?
My goddaughter heard trump wanted to delete TikTok from the US so she changed her phones setting to living in CANADA ü§£ü§£ü§£
Personally speaking I'm depressed because so many people like you believe Trump's lies.  Obamagate is total BS.

For all I know, Putin developed COVID-19, introduced it to China and the world to destroy us, and told Trump to ignore it. Why else would Trump say ‚Äúit will go away someday‚Äù? Why would he tout ineffective treatments? Why would Trump call Putin so many times in March and April?
She is number one in three different categories. Is Hannity the number 1 book in a prison library?

Nope. His.
This guy looks in the mirror, slathers on orange and says "All better." If it wasn't for the fact that Mary Trump describes Donnie's mother coming to America as a 1940's version of Melanie, I would swear his mother and father were siblings. The hubris of this man to be cocky.
do you consider these people who would vote for Trump racist?
Trump. Promise?üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
Fox News, "My view is that schools should be open," Trump said.¬†‚ÄúIf you look at children, children are almost ‚Äî and I would almost say definitely ‚Äî but almost immune from this disease.‚Äù He added that children have "much stronger immune systems" and "just don't have a problem."
I heard that demon semen is the reason for women getting ovaries. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs true, but Donald Trump Jr promoted the doctor that claims this so I doubt it‚Äôs false.
I agree with you Jocelyn trump is the biggest racist prejudice hypocrite hitler wannabe president this country has. Cause of him the coronavirus has gotten worse that retarded piece of shit. Is so goddamn stupid. I am surprised no one has taken him out yet. He deserves prison
I agree with you 100%. Trump is the biggest racist hypocrite bastard. That dumb shit can‚Äôt put a sentence together without it being a lie. This country has hitler as president. That retarded asshole needs to be locked up for the rest of his life. Cause him the virus is everywhere
There goes President Trump trying to kill Americans again.  So how much do you think he owes Putin?
Hi Wayne. Is Jonathan of Trump interview fame any relation?
Trump's account is locked until he deletes a BS tweet about kids being immune to COVID.   It's about fucking time.
Right? When I see anything in support of Trump, the first thing I think is that person is an idiot!
People a few houses down just put a Trump/Pence sign in their front yard.  They also belong to a biker club called BARI (Bikers against radical Islam), so we're pretty sure they're racists!
I guess POC are just supposed to vote for him because of the color of his skin?  That way Biden would lose and Trump would win.  Trump's not fooling anyone and it's not going to work!
He should say, "I haven't had a doctor recommend that test for dementia to me!"    Trump thinks it's an IQ test!
They honestly think that POC will just vote for Kanye because of the color of his skin!  They're not dumb, like Trump supporters!
You state all of the reasons why people should vote for Trump.  Great work Michael
To my Twitter friends who might STILL be Trump loyalists... we luv ya, guys, but SERIOUSLY, can you STILL vote for this man? Consider his total DISREGARD for the safety of you &amp; your LOVED ONES?  This DOLT only wants to enrich himself.  Screw our kids?
Of course, for this to occur Trump would have to overtake Biden in (at least) four places he's currently losing: PA, FL, ME-02, and NE-02. But it's true that this map is plausible.
We must all register to get our mail-in ballot, then do our best to turn it in personally to an official &amp; well guarded drop-box. That‚Äôs the only way to not stand in line for hours and secure that our votes count. We have absolute power to counter all of Trump‚Äôs I‚Äôll intentions
The easiest way to counter Trump is to hold a mirror to his comments because they are always about projection, especially when they are lies.
Cults always have great enthusiasm for their dear leader. Unfortunately for trump, his cult is shrinking.
I've been referring to attendees of Trump rallies, and now school children, as weaponized w/ the #COVID19 virus to infect family &amp; friends. This will create more chaos going into the election, which Putin wants.
Will NEVER vote republican again due to Trump and the Republican Party turning their back on decency and our constitution. Only voted for the D's in the 2016 election. Will do the same in 2020. They make me ill to see what they stand for now. #notarepublicananymore
I agree. No need for any debates.  has all the leverage. With Trump requesting conservative moderators and still no tax returns, Joe can demand tax returns and moderators he wants. Otherwise, no debates to show Trump  slinging lies and bull shit all over the stage.
Who in God's green earth thinks that debating Biden will help Trump?  The man tanked in an interview with Jonathan Swan -- he's going to dominate Joe Biden?  Like him or not, Biden knows his shit!  Trump -- not so much!
He‚Äôs sane, he‚Äôs smart, he‚Äôll trust experts and be inclusive. It won‚Äôt be trump family crookery. I can‚Äôt wait.
All Republicans leaders know how to do is project their own miserable failings onto Democrats. Who politicized COVID-19? Trump. Who politicized wearing masks? Trump. Who doesn't care if Americans die? Trump. Who supports Trump at every lying turn? Republicans.
She testified under oath. Trump can‚Äôt because he lies as he breathes.
Trump can't even read tbh
I agree. As an Independent voter, I don't need to hear about Trump's plans. He'll either be lying or... well, he'll just be lying because he only has plans that service Putin's agenda &amp; his boss don't want him sharing those out loud.  I suggest Joe #Biden hold virtual town halls.
Love these fellow veterans speaking out against trump. We know how to identify an enemy, whether it‚Äôs foreign or domestic.
I don‚Äôt care if Biden is in cognitive decline. He could spend the next 4 years in diapers drooling on himself and still do a far better job than trump.

Trump and his supporters own this.
Let's not forget that Fusion GPS was hired by the GOP.   After Trump won the nomination the GOP dropped Fusion and they were picked up by Democrats.  Let us also not forget that the Mueller report explicitly called out several cases of "collusion" and did not exonerate Trump.
Ha!!! This is a must!! President Trump took one back when the Democrats said he wasn‚Äôt fit!! Well Okd Joe you ain‚Äôt fit. You are a Puppet in a Liberal Socialist Marxist run party
America is trying. Maybe you shld get the virus to believe it‚Äôs real. People are afraid and trump doing nothing to build trust. You either.

We have been ever since Trump was installed in office. It‚Äôs been a clown show and Putin‚Äôs been pulling the strings. Can‚Äôt blame China for trying, Russia makes it look easy. Problem is, Biden isn‚Äôt an easy mark like Trump, so all this does is hurt the validity of a win.
These guys‚Äô ads are as good as those of  I hope they team up to help bring Trump down. #TrumpHoaxedAmerica #TrumpIsACompleteFailure
He said the problem was Trump's private militia. Another Democrat official that lies.
Problem: Biden thinks Trump supporters read. They don‚Äôt. Therefore with this ad, they only see cars, billboards, and toilet paper.
Trump says Thigh-land, Roasted endlessly, Biden "Accidentally" says blacks are not diverse, Forgiven.
What part isn‚Äôt true? If reversed, what part wouldn‚Äôt Trump blame on the president at the time of this? Candidate Trump ran on getting rid of NAFTA, how‚Äôs that going?
They aren't trying to manipulate the election. They have a rule about spreading misinformation about the pandemic. Trump lies about the pandemic constantly.
Poor Jim can‚Äôt handle the truth AMERICA LOVES TRUMP ....it‚Äôs going to be another log four more years got you !!!! Blahaha
Why is Kelly Anne married to him? Makes one wonder is he a basically unattractive guy very much a subversive guy! I don‚Äôt get it. I am troubled why she stays . So if my husband was him, I worked for Pres Trump . I would have big conflict living with HIM !!
Yes, it does. Republicans have become the party of Trump. They became that when they lacked the spine to remove him or even run another candidate in the primary against him. Your father would be ashamed.
Truth is,I still voted for and will probably vote again for the same centrist dems that i'm critiquing. My broader point is that I refuse to allow myself to be deluded or driven into a maniac state re: Trump.Remove all his touting&amp;selling, his policies are boilerplate R-doctrine
I'm not defending Trump&amp;his grifty track record at all. I'm simply saying that we must be honest about facts--Trump has not done anywhere near the damage to minorities, middle and working class ppl that the expert moderates did. I didn't vote for Trump. But, im not delusional.
Thanks üôè. Part of the problem is that I actually experienced 1st hand how disastrous the consequences were from all of these bad decisions made by the moderate elites. I was in college in Tallahassee and I remember how horrifying Bush's handling of Katrina was. Now, he's &gt;Trump?
Biden also voted for the War in Iraq. How many rural whites, poor blks &amp; brown folks young men were killed in that unnecessary war that eroded all of our civil liberties and is bankrupting our country to this day? Trump and his tacky RE properties had no real power over blks.
The Trump campaign's latest contest is a scam. Here's proof.¬† by
Everyone acknowledges that the war on drugs was a failed experiment and big stain on the our country. We threw millions of ppl in a cage for max time, for non violent crimes. Biden, however, still thinks it was the right thing to do. What has Trump done thats equivalent to that?
How can Democrat‚Äôs support Biden? Simple question can someone give to me a real response? If your response is never Trump. I say back pathetic to not care what happens to OUR COUNTRY !!üá∫üá∏
| they cover it here.I‚Äôm not saying that Trump isn‚Äôt a dumpster üî•, but I‚Äôm personally tired of my vote being held hostage by the dem establishment every presidential cycle. You put up Mr. Mass Incarceration and the AG in CA that locked up truant parents?
Doctoring images is the epitome of "fake news"  Trump is such a hypocrite!
You do realize that 4 more years of Trump is the alternative, right!?!  Biden could choose a warm egg salad as his running mate and he wouldn't lose my vote.
Their brains lack nuance and they're fueled by hatred. If you don't like Trump, you must like the Clintons. They don't understand that a person can dislike Trump and Clinton. Plus, they think you are like them and will blindly follow your "leader."  Short version: they're stupid.
We're really not far from the point where Trump says he speaks to God.
Wrong COME ON BOARD THE BRST PRESIDENT EVER !!!!! TRUMP 2020
Bring as many troops home and close as many bases as I can, do executive orders that get us as close to M4A and Green New Deal as possible. Might seem way out of character for him, but "Trump" could make the case that the pandemic and desperate times call for desperate measures
But, how will we cheat to beat Trump then?? üò´
Would it help if the word ‚ÄòSam‚Äô came after it? Maybe then it would be recognizable for Trump. As for those you work with, I second all of the previously asked questions- are these people able to pass the same cognitive test Trump brags about, at the very least?
Do you have proof the CDC falsified numbers? Or is it possible that the Trump admin is not sharing accurate info? Or could it be that the numbers are inaccurate because they required all hospitals nationwide to change systems within 2 days and they‚Äôre still adjusting?
I really really learned and enjoyed Pres Trump‚Äôs press conference . My hat is off to Arizona‚Äôs gov doing such a terrific  job under duress . I am a bit disturbed at the monies being given by our govt.  necessary I get just the $$$ I basically thought Pres Trump did very well üëç
I can do it in 2: Fuck Trump
Drain the Swamp!
If mail-in voting is so unsafe then we better see Trump cast his vote at a polling station
And the difference is, the United States will do better with Trump‚Äôs policies than Biden‚Äôs.
Great, now Trump‚Äôs going to get a light saber
Every day he conditions us to accept more crazy - ENOUGH.  NO NETWORK SHOULD RUN THIS. EVERY NETWORK THAT DOES SHOULD BE PROSECUTED under the law along with Trump and all his enablers.
Who cares what Trump says anymore. He is leaving - HE HAS TO GO.
Trump hates anything Obama does for no other reason than Obama is Black.
Den voters aren't asking "Can we?" or "Can we not?", they're just doing it.  Trump likely knows this.
Hmm I can‚Äôt even begin to imagine you doing sh.. Just my honest feeling. I do think Our Country was faced with the virus from China WHO either enabled w/China or basically dropped the ball. Biggest health crisis in history. Trump did a job worthy of respect
There is still some good in the world after all. Targeting seniors - that's like Trump level cruel.
Democrats are laying the groundwork to once again de-legitimize an election of Donald Trump.
Check your grammar and spelling before calling someone dumb, troll.  BTW, Trump can't sit and chew gum at the same time.
Only a dishonest Democrat would say such a thing considering during the Trump administration the unemployment rate for African Americans had been the lowest it had ever been until the pandemic.
I guess I have to repeat myself. I have no idea. But I haven‚Äôt read any reports that he‚Äôs demanding that Microsoft take a percentage. Microsoft is in talks to buy the company. Perhaps Trump thinks that will solve the national security threat.
You were wanting a national mandate concerning the pandemic. You‚Äôre just engaging in deflection because you don‚Äôt like Trump. Give me an example of Trump actually doing something that was an abuse of executive power. I can give you examples for Obama.
Google Biden‚Äôs response to Trump‚Äôs China travel restrictions in January 2020.
Why did Biden complain that Trump‚Äôs China travel restrictions were xenophobic and then later changed his mind? People say dumb stuff.
Why does Trump have to call on Congress? Where‚Äôs the groundswell in the Democrat controlled House of Representatives for a national mandate regarding anything about the response? It doesn‚Äôt exist. Go back to school. Learn about American government. Read the Constitution.
Convictions unrelated to activities of Trump as president and impeachment was a scam.
No one is offering a clear, sober, competent and accurate response to the virus. Why should Trump be any different?
If there is so much evidence of crimes committed by the Trump family, why hasn‚Äôt anyone been indicted?
The thing that bothers people the most about Trump is his form. Not the substance so much. It‚Äôs the form. But his form doesn‚Äôt have any impact on anyone‚Äôs lives. Funny how people focus on the more trivial at the expense of the substantive.
Truth. TRUMP 2020 Baby!
Everyone please watch. It‚Äôs incredible how he deflects every question by citing his own incompetence as achievement.
Thank you President Trump !!
We have deployed refrigerated corpse trucks in America because of Donald Trump's complete failure to act.
This woman is VERY much against Trump!!!
So not Pres Trump
I think the reporting has not been accurate. E.g. a patient terminal with Cancer contracts Covid and dies is listed as Covid. Same with other deaths like car crashes . Many more examples as well.. inflated , why Hysteria driven.. also Dems want to say Trump isn‚Äôt handlingPandemic
Record job losses and crashing GDP under Trump, what a ducking shocker
Trump goes postal by
Trump is trying to shake down Microsoft.
If Biden weasels out of the debates. Trump's approval rating keeps going up (it's at 51% now) it won't matter. Trump will win in a landslide.
I'll go Answer A Jeff: Donald Trump?
Yeah, it's literally what I've been saying, but you couldn't hear over your shouts of "HOW DARE YOU BLAME TRUMP!!"
Here‚Äôs hoping it‚Äôs enough to them all, including Ivanka, Jared, Don Jr, and Eric, in jail with Criminal in Chief.   NY prosecutors say Trump investigation extends beyond hush money payments
He just wants to be on the Trump train, God love him.  I do think he was smart enough to recognize what Wallace was doing, which is why he went full WHATABOUT SHADY DOSSIERS, HUH? üòÜ
Did Trump beat Obama?
I don't think anyone is above reproach, but Trump throwing a pick-six on our first possession put us permanently behind.  Now we're stupidly burning a candle at both ends trying recover from both the virus and the economy at the same time.
What's most important is the response of each country.  Our response was spectacularly bad.  Trump is gonna be the scapegoat every bit as much as he was the shining hero for the bullet train of an economy.
Why is this a problem? I interpreted your initial tweet that you were implying that they made their money due to Trump being president.
If trump would have stuck do doing nothing he'd make millions without suspicion. He went for president and might go to jail. Ego greed and envy bitch.
That‚Äôs the beauty of the debates. President Trump all by himself can put the questions to Biden.
I always thought Pete Buttiegeg had the best shot at beating Trump.
Gosh!  Trump's just one o' the good guys, settin' things straight 'round here, doin' things legally and whatnot.
Yet you say nothing about Trump and Navarro doing exactly that to Dr. Fauci.
Trump speaks on his behalf.

So for all of you who are mad at Trump for banning TikTok, there is nothing wrong with the app itself it‚Äôs just the Chinese government is collecting our personal data so we can‚Äôt protect ourselves in war #tiktokban
Therefore you'd vote for anyone who's not Trump. If Stalin or Hitler or Pol Pot ran against Trump you'd vote for them.
OK, birther. What happened when President Obama wore a tan suit?  Trump deserves more than he gets. He lies with every breath he can muster. He intentionally divides the country for his own benefit. He is a deadly cocktail of stupidity and hubris.

679,439 humans have lost their life to COVID-19, with 156,621 of them being Americans. Or better put, 23% of all deaths to #COVID19 are Americans, yet Americans only account for less than 3% of the world's population. #Winning #Trump
A plagiarizer, creepy, segregationist supporter, liar, with declining mental faculties, deathly afraid of being asked hard questions about spying on the Trump campaign and running for president while hiding in his basement. Has abandoned most of his life long principles.
This too
I'm trying to imagine someone trying to explain this infinitely complex infrastructure to Trump and I'm barely able to contain my maniacal laughter.
You are in denial. Trump's rally speeches are mostly off the cuff as he ad libs a lot. He has had many press conferences taking questions from a hostile press. Biden is hiding in his basement as his handlers say "no" to going on shows like Fox Sunday hosted by Chris Wallace.
No one can any longer say Trump supporters aren‚Äôt racist. Every action, policy, WH staff is there for a reason. They believe in white supremacy. Climb out from under the rock.
Part if it is Trump being advised to throw out whatever trial balloons he has to see what captures (hijacks) the narrative, and part of it is just pure capitalism.  But I'm also aware that the people who "care" most about security want complete, unabated control of it.
You're the only one blathering on about the CDC.  I never mentioned them.  You want to crown Trump a shining hero, then be my guest.  But he should have quickly realized this could be a political nuke, and saved himself from his Titanic 2nd term bid.  There's no reversing this.
What's really funny is believing Trump cares about any of that, or even knows what any of it means.
Here we have a live shot of the Trump train.
Thousands of rioters and protesters not wearing masks is safe but attending a Trump rally isn't. Going to a well  attended funeral for a heroic Democrat is fine but going to a friend's funeral isn't. Your side's hypocrisy has created the distrust over the response.
In 2016 the Democrats lost an election they were sure they were going to win. Ever since then they‚Äôve claimed the election was rigged by Trump and the Russians. It‚Äôs been a horrible lie perpetrated by ugly people like you.
Richard, can you distinguish between expressing an idea and implementing it? Trump talked about delaying an election while the Chinese delayed one. You continue to pander to your Democrat donors while misleading Americans.
Biden was right. I was wrong. I underestimated the depth of Trump's depravity. He will, in fact, try anything to retain power.  Fixed it for you.
Greatest economic expansion in American history.  20 million Americans with health insurance. Protecting America‚Äôs reputation in the world.  Lots more. Trump: 33% reduction in GDP.  45 million unemployed.  Kids in cages. More dumb ass medical recommendations in US history.
Don‚Äôt comment on US economics if you don‚Äôt know anything.  Trump inherited the largest economic expansion in American history (fact) gave a trillion dollars of debt to Corporations and the 1% then his policies drove our economy into the ground.  33% reduction in GDP in Q2. STFU
By getting rid of Donald Trump
Welcome to Trump‚Äôs 2nd term
Every Trump "deal" ever has been a failure, every business that produces a product or delivers a service. Only two "illusions", branding &amp; reality TV, haven't failed. You are the one with serious mental deterioration, not VP Biden.  But I don't feel sorry for you.
Not a big fan of semantics, but the media plays themselves better than Trump ever could.
This was yesterday when Trump went to Texas to talk about fracking
Why is Trump considering moving the election date. To be like Venezuela?
Funny teaching moment of the day. Little boy in my class asked our closer if they liked Donald Trump. Complete silence followed in the classroom as all 3 teachers tried to find a way to answer without creating a political debate. Oh, and I teach Pre-K.
Americans Still Want to Know Why Donald Trump Is Letting Us Die | Thom Hartmann

My aunt's defending the witch doctor lady, on the same day Trump is asking to postpone the election, and that Herman Cain died of covid after attending the Tulsa rally with no protection. No wonder I'm messed up. Adults are fucking idiots.
It‚Äôs not even close, Donald Trump remains his own worst enemy. For the pandemic he‚Äôs tried to display calm but this appears to be panic over his failing reelection chances.
Slow your role, #DictatorTrump ... only Congress has that power
Responsibility for dealing with the COVID-19 crisis is primarily a state and local responsibility. Federal government provides expertise and resources. Trump didn‚Äôt blunder like Cuomo and cause literally thousands of unnecessary COVID-19 deaths.
Shocking. A trump buddy who lies.

Hi Ken, What are you doing about Trump not confronting Putin on Russian bounties on US troops in Afghanistan? Thanks, AT2(AW) OrtonThat's funny because Russian disinformation was used &amp; spread by Democrats &amp; NeverTrumpers to spy on the Trump campaign, undermine his Presidency, &amp; is still uses as the basis for the 'Russia is working for Trump' theory. HELLO!! Russian disinformation was used to HURT TRUMP.
No, he didn't apologize, he doubled down. Trump doesn't need to apologize as it is, because he's not racist. Joe Biden actually believes these racist things -- because he's always having to apologise for them, ie: admission of guilt.
Chuck Schumer Wants To Ban TikTok Before Trump Does!  via
Hillary won the popular vote by 2/3.5 million votes. It‚Äòs the electoral college that chooses. And they came out saying they can choose anyone they want regardless. Which is how Trump won.
This shit right here should be illegal, I don't listen to his music and if I did I would stop after this. It's a damn shame the Trump campaign would use a person that suffers with mental health issues to help win their election, but I'm not shocked.
Trump has a habit of destroying something, then rebuilding it and expecting to get praised for doing so.
If you want to really learn about corruption in politics I have two words for you. Trump's inauguration.
I find it ironic that Fox pushes stories about CNBC ignoring Bill Clinton's (a FORMER SCUMBAG PRESIDENT) ties but ignores Trump's (a CURRENT SCUMBAG PRESIDENT) ties.

GOP women warn of eroding support among female voters amid a ‚Äògender chasm‚Äô
New Trump Exec Order allowing women to vote. He is the greatest president of all time. Now if he could only end prohibition.
I don't understand why all these men refuse to speak up? What and who are they so afraid of?  Losing their jobs? You would think DeSantis and Trump were Mafia godfathers. "No position to balk the governor?" They are in exactly the RIGHT position to tell the truth!
Right? I mean, these Trump rally‚Äôs are out of control!
I still think every Trump/Putin phone call is about trump tower Moscow. Putin just gets him on the phone and is like ‚ÄúI really think we‚Äôre close to doing this deal this time, I really do‚Äù like he has for 30yrs and that‚Äôs all trump cares about so that‚Äôs all they talk about
Trump wants to shut down TikTok because the users claim they banded together and gobbled up all the tickets to his rally in Tulsa that almost nobody showed up for. He wants to stufle anybody that disagrees with him he wants to shut up....like twitter, Facebook, CNN &amp; Fox News.
You guys never stop with your bullshit.  It won‚Äôt work. Joe has my vote ! I also saw Joe shake Trump‚Äôs hand, I‚Äôm not holding that against him either.
you guys do not choose Susan Rice, you'll hear nothing but Bengazi and her son is a Trump supporter! Kick yourself in the chin why don't you.
Has to be all the H1-B visa holders lashing out because Trump is going to get their asses canned.
Repubs have always wanted to gut our "entitlement programs". Trump is their useful idiot. Make it seem like it's a win buy telling people you'll have more money in your pockets never saying a thing how it will negatively impact seniors &amp; is of no benefit to people who have no job
I actually heard Republicans that are going to vote Biden say if Whitmere is VP they'll go back to trump.
If you choose to not vote for Biden, you're voting for Trump. Don't ever call yourself a never Trumper either. People like you are why we are in this mess. Think of the people who are being harmed by Trump‚Äôs policies &amp; actions. Think of the seniors who rely on SS &amp; Medicare.
Vermin of Walmart for tRump
I'm shocked to there any parents left who aren't outraged at Trump and the federal government for fucking up the COVID response and ruining the Fall Semester for millions of children.
Can‚Äôt face palm hard enough. Jeez   To a white, *almost* middle aged man suburbanite in the ‚Äúheartland‚Äù the Trump years have been...enlightening in some respects
I'm in Denver. I see 4 Trump signs for every 1 Biden sign
Trump~instead of making us great, he‚Äôs made us ineffable
I hate Trump. He is a compulsive liar
A lot of funny observations tonight about trump &amp; ACA.   Stay focused. They‚Äôre a bunch of traitorous thieves waving a shiny object while they rip you off.
Schumer now gives his blessing that schools should open? Trump has been saying this for MONTHS! Now who is wrong As Always? Vote these bastards out! PERIOD!
Narcissists are going love other Narcissists like Trump. He is the only one that doesnt make them realize their dysfunction.
I don‚Äôt throw this word around, and I really don‚Äôt like saying it, but I HATE Trump with every fibre of my being. Every. Single. One.
President Trump signing a major executive order, for health insurance companies to cover pre-existing conditions! Why didn‚Äôt President Obama think of that? Oh wait, it‚Äôs already in the affordable care act!
"Trump says he plans on making insurers cover pre-existing conditions ‚Äî a protection which already exists under Obamacare"
Wow...1984 a bit late: just in time for 2024? Police state rising unless we can dislodge Trump et al from the WH!!üò°üò°üò°
trump tells you what to think, say, and do. And like all cult members you do exactly what he wants.
News flash. That‚Äôs already covered under the affordable care act. As usual, Obama got there before Trump.
Trump makes promise to unilaterally: -Implement payroll tax holiday until end of the year -Defer student loan payments indefinitely -Extend unemployment benefits until of the year.  -Extend moratorium on evictions  But no specifics &amp; unlikely he can do all this legally.
This time next year Donald Trump could be sitting in jail
That‚Äôs also not a law, but an executive order, so he can rescind it at any time... Related: payroll tax cuts will be later used as a pretext to cut SS and Medicare benefits. Oh - and Kanye has sold out to Trump...
That‚Äôs a pretty old clipping you‚Äôve got there. Do you really want to go tit for tat between Biden and Trump? Why didn‚Äôt Trump attention the memorial for John Lewis? Why does Trump inspire nazis to march in the streets with torches?
Obamacare was a scam. They made it with Blackfoot deals with big pharmaceutical and insurance lobbyists. Trump‚Äôs making sure the good part is kept, something they could have done without the scam but didn‚Äôt.
Trump Is Not Well #TrumpIsNotWell
Are you dumb axios or do you not realize Obamacare is a failure, leaving more still uninsured than it covers while jacking up costs? It needs to be repealed but Trump is keeping one of the only good things from it.
Anti-maskers explain themselves #antimaskers  via
It's hard to believe that even Trump's most fervent base could believe the avalanche of unfulfilled promises that have come from this man's speeches.
I‚Äôm not even a Trump fan, but Jesus Christ. Has it occurred to anyone that not all plans cover pre-existing conditions and the media claims he wants to take what coverage there is away 24/7? Of course not. Maybe he felt the need to put an end to that lie.
The way to protect Obama‚Äôs policy gains was always to get Trump to think he created them, and the plan is working perfectly.
How many lost due to your mishandling of the tRump virus???
I love that Trump called out the Dems especially Nervous Nancy on the relief package. It is amazing that these Liberats are starting to go a little right cause they know they are in deep trouble come Nov. Where is Hunter? Just saying. We will not see any debates, or a VP pick.
The framers were unanimous that Congress, as the representatives of the people, should be in control of public funds‚Äînot the President or executive branch agencies.  IM SCREAMING THAT TRUMP MIGHT USE AN EXECUTIVE ORDER TO PASS STIMULUS FUNDS. AND NO ONE IS TELLING HIM ITS ILLEGAL
Republicans and Trump's administration are always asking for bailouts for corporations and what can help line their pockets, instead of making actuals incentives for the normal people.
Prove it. (Kinda like you CLAIMED you had proof on Trump Russia ‚Äúcollusion‚Äù) You are a liar and a disgrace. #resign
Your daily reminder that the polls are wrong because his supposed naysayers aren‚Äôt being truthful and will flinch and vote Trump on Election Day.  #mediawhore
I attribute to my having grown up in Alabama the fact that I believe what your friend asserts. Trump's supporters believe he hates who they hate. They can count on him to treat badly those whom they hate. If I am butting in here, I apologize for my rudeness; sorry.
Breaking News: Trump just announced his Health Care Plan.
Foreign powers meddling in our elections yet again. Cue radio silence from trump
Typical trump, create a crisis that only HE can solve
I also appreciate the juxtaposition of actual footage of migrants forced back into Mexico to wait to ask for asylum under the Migrant Protection Protocols ("Remain in Mexico") and Trump's lies about how they are bad people who look like they should be in the UFC.
I don‚Äôt agree with everything. Guns should be illegal and God has no place in politics. But it‚Äôs anyone but Trump. Voting any different will only help Trump.
Because trump says they‚Äôre immune!!
Trump is a bot
I can‚Äôt wait to see what authority Trump thinks he has that would let him unilaterally order insurance companies to cover preexistig conditions. You know, if Congress hadn‚Äôt already done it a decade ago.
Trump says Asians 'understand exactly' why he uses racist terms for coronavirus
It‚Äôs all we have. He sucks, but he‚Äôs not Trump. Hence the ‚Äúanyone but Trump!‚Äù movement.
Joe Arpaio, who also ran an unsuccessful U.S. Senate campaign in 2018, not long after President Trump pardoned his criminal conviction for disobeying a judge‚Äôs order, has been narrowly defeated in his bid to win back the sheriff‚Äôs post in metro Phoenix.
Because god loves liars, cheaters, corrupt criminals, rascist, creeps like Donald Trump. Horrible
Thank God     are NOT the elite. Trump came INTO office rich, the others LEAVE office rich. Stop being divided by media. Remember CNN said it would kill you until they DIDN‚ÄôT.
If tell them to fuck off! That‚Äôs what the spineless republicans and Trump did. Who gives a shit!!!
Trump enterprise and crime family.. emoluments, stealing from kids cancer charity, the Hatch Act.. shall I go on?

Pre-existing conditions are CURRENTLY covered. Trump is suing to END pre-existing conditions. But you know that - you‚Äôre just counting on Trump‚Äôs base to be ignorant of that fact.
Now onto refugees, and it's painful to hear their stories and to know what the Trump administration has done to refugee resettlement and the asylum process.  This is one of the major examples of why "'both parties are equally bad" is just such bs.
#BreakingNews Trump planning to sign executive order to requiring employers and employees to pay into a retirement fund for retirees, he is going to call it "social security"
Trump is sneaky with his words...‚Äùcovering pre-existing conditions‚Äù is not the same thing as ‚Äúaffordable coverage for pre-existing conditions‚Äù.   Lets see if that EO states limits on how much more insurance companies can raise premiums for pre-existing condition coverage.
Welcome to Nazi America a la Trump!üëπ
I feel their pain if they feel bad about voting for tRUMP in 2016. We have one chance to make it right again in November. We can do it if we flood the gates. tRUMP must go
Trump taking credit for what Obama already did years ago. He's done that his whole life. Taking credit for other people's work. You people are pathetic.
Are you saying trump is involved too?
So what you are admitting is the Donald Trump does not know what the current law is.  At least you admit it.
If he grows a crap beard, you just know he's been sleeping over at Trump Tower more than is probably appropriate.
Breathe deep.... calm down... now say it....Trump 2020!!!
no, Trump cares only about himself.
What are you doing Joe? Are you waiting till Nov 3rd and say whew I dodged a bullet, now I can retire lol. Move over red rover and let Trump take over. throw the white flag already. How many weeks does it take to pick a running mate. What are the DNC waiting for? Just saying.
Growing up queer in South Carolina, but more recently my partner was attacked by a Trump supporter over an innocent Maltese dog
It's called the Affordable Care Act, aka Obamacare, and it's been the law for ten years. Six weeks ago the Trump Administration filed a brief with the Supreme Court trying to strip Americans of pre-existing protections under Obamacare. This. is. lying.
Literally trump has been saying they should open, the Republicans have been saying that, too. The democrats just said it TODAY after mocking the republicans.
my dream, lady liberty in poor shape trying to protect the people and Trump ripping her clothing to cover the Covid victims to play golf on top. I am going to need PTSD therapy after he is is gone. Illustrators anyone?
Also, if Biden wins (regardless of Trump actually leaving or not, and hopefully he does), we owe a big thanks to... who?  BLACK WOMEN - the most consistent bloc of voters the Dems have. Now's our chance to do right by them.
In #Colorado Kayne West is to be on the ballot for president. The #Republicans fought for this!  Fuck Trump!  He must go we can‚Äôt have another 4 yrs of this shit.

If it wasn‚Äôt seeing kids in cages or seeking bribes from a foreign gov, was it the repeated suggestion that the coronavirus would take care of itself? If it wasn‚Äôt Trump‚Äôs defense of white nationalists in Charlottesville, was it when he suggested we postpone election in a tweet?

In other words Trump just lied as usual.
Anyone w/even minimal intelligence can see that everything Trump says is really a projection of what he himself says or does. His brain is so small he can't come up with anything else plus it's all he knows. #PeaBrain #TrumpVirus
I agree with that whole heartedly. Appointing people to run the government is the most important job the president does. Even that job Trump has corrupted by surrounding himself with unqualified synchophants.
If only the poor ppl of this country knew how the system works against them when a Republican like tRUMP is in the W.H., he wouldn't be President right now. A lot of them voted against their own interests in 2016.
Ooh. I'm crushed. Your eloquent defense of Trump and your witty takedown of my comments is brilliant. Just brilliant. I shall change my mind immediately.  Feeling a bit triggered, there, snowflake?
No. I think Russia, China, and the Saudis and Trump against Biden

Trump and McConnell. They both need to go. McConnell has been in office since 84! Let‚Äôs make a change.
But people have known for years he's been skimming.  Why is it suddenly an issue. This could backfire. Trump needs something to spark his base. They've always been afraid we're after their guns. This might be the thing they need to get ignited.
It directly tracks my own thinking on this.
Trump U.
This is good advice from
Trump is going to sign an executive order mandating that trees turn carbon dioxide into oxygen.
So did Trump, tool.
So who pays for security?  ? Trump campaign? US taxpayers?
If Biden wins then don't cry to me about what used to be America cause I will not listen. All our rights and history would be removed and I will be better off moving out of the country. But of course that won't happen. Trump landslide and we can breathe a lot easier.
This has never been done before *checks notes* unless you count ACA, while Trump has been supporting the GOP push to repeal this for the last 3.5 years.
Hating trump is easy. Admitting you contributed to genocide in Iraq and Afghanistan is hard. Most new allies fail that second test.

The difference between Trump &amp; Jose (since apparently Joe is now part Latino), is that Jose takes a knee &amp; Trump stands tall.  Taking a knee is a slave mentality.  The men who liberated the slaves never took a knee.  Kneel for God, but not any man.  Biden is an awkward skintag.
But it makes him look like he cares (which he doesn't). Mnuchin and Meadows set this up, they didn't negotiate in good faith. This was planned all along to make Trump look good.. Who is going to sue to stop this, which members of Congress won't vote to fund this? Good PR for DJT.
The WHPC is neutered and all they care about is access and a future book deal about "my time in the WHPC during the Trump presidency."
On July 19th, Trump promised a health care plan would be released in two weeks.  Today, 5 days late, he announces he‚Äôs going to issue an executive order that does something that Congress already did 10 years ago, and that his lawyers are in court tying to dismantle.  Idiocracy.

Why didn't the press walk out on Trump's obviously orchestrated "press conference?" Why are they sitting there allowing them to be humiliated with cameras rolling? Is there a purpose to this? Are we going to learn anything that we don't already know about Trump?
So the unemployed will get a check from a trump executive order, but us Americans who have either took a pay cut or changed jobs to a lower salary won't get help. On top of that we're still getting taxed...you Democrats have no soul and you just lost the election with this.
The huckster can't lose.... if Dems don't sign he blames them,if they do sign,  its a win for Trump. This thing is fixed 6 ways to hell.
Trump‚Äôs best day ever.
Is this the new plan? Trump is gonna issue EOs for things that have already happened, then try to take credit?   Easier than work, I guess.
Ya Obamacare already covers preexisting conditions, Libs are jumping all over this. BUT, when was the last time a Republican President Extended/wanted to expand, healthcare in this country? Maybe Trump'll see he needs to go further. Biden wont consider anything beyond statusquo.
Wait I have questions: can Trump do all this via executive order? If so, how sad is it that  can't get this done?
There is no exception for political activity and peaceful protest, and Trump is a fucking fascist fluffing his ego in front of the only people he thinks matter.
You missed the point!  I wasn‚Äôt expecting a Trump rally and some of us need answers about our lives when it comes to unemployment extension.  Another sleepless night while the media gets stuck with their dicks in their hands again.
Then why did Trump correct himself the second time he said it?
JUST IN: President Donald Trump said during a last-minute news conference Friday that he is ready to sign an executive order that will offer unemployment supplements, eviction protection, and a payroll tax holiday through the end of the year.
Trump was really my first major awareness of wealthy white trailer trash and his deplorables have just amplified its existence.  Money doesn't buy class.

Trump is claiming that he is going to require coverage of pre-existing conditions.   Which is a basic tenet of the ACA.  IT HAS BEEN DONE BEFORE.  IT IS CURRENTLY THE LAW.  He's just taking credit for something Obama did, again. That is really pathetic.
When Trump speaks people listen, when Biden speaks, I go what did he just say? I would call my wife in to watch cause she speaks 5 different languages. I ask her to interpret this. She has no idea what Biden said. LOL. Just saying.

Just once, I wish I could observe the world thru Trump's rose-colored glasses. Oh, wait: That's the problem! He can't see crap because he's not wearing any!

Biden would face the same lack of acceptance Trump did. He will cry or quit
That already exists, under the ACA. Which, so far, is still in force despite Trump's attempts to get rid of it and replace it with...nothing.  Just another thing that Trump the Failure is trying to take credit for. IT ALREADY EXISTS.
Get ready for 4 more years of Trump.
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP UNLEASHED.
Trump said this immediately after being a jerk to a reporter out for not mentioning Iran-in the SAME REPORT. But for *this* question he hasn‚Äôt seen it? All roads lead to Putin....

Contradicting the intelligence community‚Äôs assessment, the president said, ‚ÄúThe last person Russia wants to see in office is Donald Trump.‚Äù  Pressed on the matter, he said: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care what anybody says‚Äù
Never mind Trump increased the defense budget by 10% and they still want more borrowed money!

Anyone else feel that words like "beautiful" and "wonderful" and "biggest" and "best" (etc etc etc) are... "Trump" words? Like, I need to expand my vocabulary so I don't sound like that fuckwit.
Wow, President Trump attempting to provide real relief to people while Democrats continue to try and destroy everything in their path.

So, you are saying that Trump is everything his base despises? That he's a part of the costal elite that MAGATs blame for every bad thing in America?
So, in other words you are saying Trump is one of the costal elites that his base has blamed for everything wrong in their lives?

This Vet is fearful of what will happen if Trump wins, and if he loses.  He is destroying this country!
I do think Trump was the subject of most of the jokes, but I also got the sense during the interview that he thought he came off really well (which is kind of a joke in itself).

I voted the first time in 1984, when I turned 18. I was so proud to be an adult and get to do that, and I've voted in every election since. I'm not sure it's generational; I think some people are just cynical or lazy, and not voting is some sort of rebellion. Trump is the result.
I think JB will do better than most are probably expecting (mainly because the bar is so low). For all the talk about Trump eating him alive, the reality is that in a moderator-controlled debate, it doesn't really work that way. Very little direct dialogue between the candidates.

The problem is that (contrary to popular opinion) there's really only one way to even begin to put a dent in the debt, and that's entitlement reform (which is very politically unpopular). The Dems have fought it for years, and the GOP stopped trying when Trump was elected.
This really is annoying. Republicans (rightly) assailed Obama and the Dems on debt-spending for 8 long years. Then, the second Trump won, they abandoned the issue and actually outpaced Obama's spending. 4 years of silence, and now they suddenly care about the debt again? Please.

Let‚Äôs do the math. Roughly 26% of registered voters voted for Trump. About 2/3 of that 26% were men, so we‚Äôll say approximately 17% of registered male voters voted for him. Assuming political preference is fairly constant through the populace, that means that 17% of American men

Val, You have demonstrated that you are one of the elite young leaders in the Democratic Party. Joe Biden was fortunate to be able to include you on his short list of VP candidates. Please keep up the wonderful work you are doing on behalf of your constituents and all Americans!
And yet he endorses a candidate who‚Äôs made waves standing directly against precisely this. Joe Biden sees Obamacare in the way that American racists see statues of Confederate generals: as a transcendental symbol that must be preserved at any cost at all.
I asked for this ticket the day Biden locked up the nomination!
I mean, the whole point of a Biden campaign is to ignore all of the facts about his history while pretending at the same time that the Dems weren‚Äôt deeply contemptuous of Republicans saying precisely this about Trump on 2016.
What happened to you?  Are you in the same stage of dementia as Biden?

Dude.   Joe Biden already is a victory for the right. He hands them everything they‚Äôve wanted for fifty years.   That belief you have that he‚Äôs substantively different from Trump in literally any way at all? That‚Äôs an article of religious faith totally undupported by evidence.

Shortly after the news broke, President Trump posted a video ad on Twitter attacking Harris as a "phony" and Biden as "not that smart" for picking her.
Musing:  An interesting choice!  She's young which could take some of the load off of Biden because she could do travels and political things he may not have the energy to do!
Kamala Harris is Biden's VP. Are you as surprised as him when he found out? Kamala Harris 'identifies' as African American and considers her experience to be American even tho her mother is from India, and her father is from Jamaica.
Representative - did you hear one of her (Kamala Harris) accounts had unfollowed the Bidens' campaign account yesterday?  Plus to some young people if she was chosen, Biden may not get their support bc Kamala has done some questionable actions while an attorney in Cali.
You have to vote against Trump.   This is not about getting Biden elected it is about getting Trump out.  Foolish emotional responses are not necessary
Biden is a puppet for Clinton and Obama
By October 1 latest, Biden should announce his entire cabinet and the next 100 high-level appointments (major ambassadors, 2nd-level cabinet, etc.) as well as provide his detailed plan to clean out Trump's mess: ID and remove appointments, reverse EOs, and rebuild ally relations.
If you really care about the environment and sustainability and green energy you should vote for Biden. Anything else is a vote for trump. I suspect you know this and are an attention seeker.
I am Biden all the way, even if he picks an ear of corn ‚ù§Ô∏è
But NO.  Its wrong. Its not about who's doing it, its about the unprecedented and dangerous expansion of executive  power that it represents. I hope that Biden doesn't do the same thing, regardless of whether I'd agree with the outcome.
I mean, Biden Bros couldn‚Äôt debunk their way out of a creationist science fest, but there you have it.

Sup? Shes my pick for VP. There‚Äôs nobody better to tackle the current race relations and criminal justice reform. I like that she pushed back on Biden in the debates but supports him when she agrees. Trying not to get my hopes up too much though.
Which is why a bunch of elderly, comparatively rich people would rather shove  down your throat like Joe Biden accidentally left alone with an intern then they would actually fight for the values that The Democrats used to pretend they stand for.
I really don‚Äôt understand their point of view. They want more socialist policies but don‚Äôt realize the Biden is a lot closer than Trump in this direction. I feel like they don‚Äôt realize what they want and how to dissect a political agenda.
Also, don‚Äôt get me wrong, your tweet a week or so ago about Biden‚Äôs ‚Äò94 crime law resonated with me. When it comes to race relations they both have an abysmal record. I believe Biden is a step in the right direction but also don‚Äôt blame you if you disagree.
It was difficult for me to go to grad school because I was already in too much debt. Trump wants to eliminate subsidized loans and public service debt forgiveness making it harder on undergrad. The 15k from Biden would go a long way for undergrad, if it goes through.
I think Biden is a step in the right direction. His plan helps the middle class students more than Trump. I think his platform on education will make it easier for another politician along the lines of Bernie to take it even further.
If you‚Äôre serious about getting rid of Trump then it requires supporting Biden for this election.  After that, I don‚Äôt think any democrat expects you or the project lincoln folks to be permanent members of the party.

The Dem Party pours $ into fighting/preventing progressives as much as they can. I support all progressive candidates available, but the party fights tooth &amp; nail. We‚Äôre slowly building progressives in Congress despite the party‚Äôs best efforts. Biden won‚Äôt be forced after he wins

Ummm...Biden ain't winning.   Dems committed political malpractice with this ticket.  He shouldn't win. The put up a guy with severe cognitive issues. It's ridiculous.
81 days until we re-elect the most America loving, NON politician to be  f/four more years. Jobs. Security. Peace in the Middle East. Bringing troops home. Defeated ISIS. Killed Terrorists. Takes on China. IRAN. NOKO.... Obama/Biden committed Treason. That's a nightmare.
I mean, you‚Äôre making my point. Dems ARE in a position to effect change, they CHOOSE not to, why keep supporting them? Also, Biden said it himself. Now, he does have a long history of outright lying (like Trump), so I understand why taking his own word is risky, but still.
Look up his record of success focused on ALL Americans Ms. Swift. Lowest unemployment f/All Americans. Funded historic black colleges, criminal justice reform and so much more.  Biden. Harris.  Phonies. Corrupt Marxists.  Your statements are worthless. Uneducated. Factless.
So you played golf and bashed Biden while your brother was dying. You are an amazing piece of sh*t. Man am I glad I am no relation to you! Bless Robert. So sorry for his passing. üôè
What a tragic and ignorant rant.  Look up President Trump's policies.  All have been good for America after decades of corrupt politicians and 8 years of the traitors Obama/Biden admin who spied on his campaign &amp; attempted a coup d'erat.
Biden love pedophiles its up to you,  thanks
American that vote for Biden you will vote for a not American citizen like Kamara lol
You know the VP basically doesn‚Äôt do anything right?  How desperate is Biden that he is constantly taking about the bottom of the ticket? ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not just me! I picked a girl!‚Äù
Who is going to watch the DNC on Monday? Prediction of this comedy show. Someone who sounds like Biden talks showing him in the basement, Harris will talk too much, AOC gets her 60 seconds of shame and a lot of music. Yawn. lol.

Biden is an equal roadblock, he literally said he‚Äôd veto M4A even if Congress passed it. Dems voted FOR Trump‚Äôs budgets, surveillance powers, judges, Space Force, impeached ONLY on conspiracy against Biden. I‚Äôll give them down ballot votes, chance to prove themselves in Congress
What's this analysis based on? Why would a Biden presidency return more on ave than historical averages? Also a major factor is which party  takes the Senate..What party does the writer affiliate with??
I pray no one votes till after first debate get Biden to do at least one debate now
That has nothing to do with biden though
Joe Biden isn‚Äôt ideal but if he doesn‚Äôt take the opportunity to host briefings and press conferences in a casual morning environment drinking coffee and calling it ‚ÄúA Cup of Joe with Joe‚Äù I will RIOT
Millions out of work and facing eviction/foreclosure, 170,000 dead from COVID-19, a POTUS openly trying to suppress the vote, out of control debt...  GOP answer: Biden‚Äôs a socialist!
I am proud that we have such a great breadth of Democratic leaders.  The candidates who ran against Biden, all of the women who were considered for VP, our honestly impressive Congress people.  They have Trump.  The rest of the GOP went to sleep.
Can Joe Biden "Thread the Needle" Among Democrats?
A Snowden pardon would be wonderful. What can Biden offer in response for the progressives in his party?
Sanders EARNED delegates for the convention. Biden also won more delegates. The convention is where the nominee becomes official. Don‚Äôt worry. You‚Äôll get your crappy centrist candidate &amp; a platform that doesn‚Äôt include M4A, despite these votes. They still earned a voice there.
China endorsed Biden/Harris, this should be your wake up call.
GOP: Hillary was a crook. After Trump was elected.... no investigations.  GOP: Biden is a crook. Prior to Bidens run for President... no investigations.  Its almost like they're just screwing around
Dear traitor John  No one cares about Hunter Biden or you. Forget about it Its all propaganda
We were told Biden was ‚Äúmost electable‚Äù, that he‚Äôs smashing the polls, that we, from Joe‚Äôs own mouth, should ‚Äúvote for someone else then‚Äù when asking the slightest challenging question. NOW y‚Äôall need us? Votes are earned. Biden is a serial liar too &amp; a warmonger. Your bar is low

By not voting for Trump (a vote for Biden), not voting for Biden (a vote for Trump), and then voting 3rd party, you actually get 3 votes. I feel very smart knowing this.
Every politician gets at least 127,853 accusations every week minimum. It should be looked into but innocent till proven guilty. Even Biden.
Good Lord STOP embarrassing yourself.  This is VERY uncomfortable for the people who know how you achieved your position in government. You are not qualified to be there. Just like Biden. We all know this. That is all.
Nothing I hate more than identity politics----it's the #DemocraticParty's biggest weakness.....Just another reason I left the party after 2016---I follow policy.....speaking of, if Joe Biden promised to pardon Julian Assange and Edward Snowden of any crimes, I would vote for him.

International students will avoid the US for at least the next 3 years even if Biden is elected. The numbers will dwindle significantly if Trump is re-elected. Those numbers won't rebound. So much MONEY lost. How do I know? I worked with international students. They spend $$$
In doing a little more checking, I can find at least 3 Popes that Biden was blessed to meet.  For a man you don't seem to think is Catholic, that's a pretty good track record.
If all goes well and Biden gets elected, do you have a plan for how conservatives can return to a functioning party willing to compromise and govern for the good of the people? I value your opinion but I see many never trumpers holding on to their intransigence.

Sounds like he's endorsing Biden.
I do not support rapist, racist war mongers, which is why I am just as likely to vote trump as I am biden. How about you try building an argument FOR your candidate, instead of against the other one.
Actually, he is more favored to win then against Hillary. His favorability is higher than Obama at this stage in his presidency.  Liberals are lurching too far left. People will begrudgingly vote Trump in order to not have Biden.

we don't care if she had botched her presidential run.  Biden won.  ALL the other candidates lost. we are thrilled at the ticket.  they compliment each other.  and they will be the next president and vice president of the US.
It's not as simple as "just elect Democrats". That's a good place to start. But we can't make the mistake of folding up shop &amp; going home after the election is over: that's where the hardest work begins.

Joe Biden is absolutely correct. Pendley has no business being in charge of Colorado's public lands, and yet Trump still has this anti-public zealot in the building "to lead the Bureau of Land Management".  Why won't  speak out against this guy? #copolitics #cosen
I will grant you that a majority of people who identify as liberals ..sadly myself included, only complain when It is a Republican (is Trump really a real Republican??!) It's a serious concern for me as We get closer to the election, that if Biden wins we won't complain as much.

This is the best argument I've heard. Basically we are voting for who we want to fight. Do you want to fight against Trump or fight against Biden. The claim is it's easier to fight with Biden than it is with Trump. And if Biden wins his supporters will realize nothing has changed

No amount of Trump being bad makes Biden any better. They are both horrible picks for leadership and the public keeps allowing it to happen by voting for it. A 3rd party can win if people were smart enough to vote for them. That‚Äôs the only way we fix it.

Biden also openly called for the arrest of anarchists. I agree with your assessment, the democrats are 2016 Republicans. They just are not loud and crude.
They only impeached him for going after biden. They had no mention of the crimes he has committed. If they really wanted to impeach AND remove him, they would've made a case with teeth.

Throughout 2021 Continues writing how awful the Biden admin is, despite decent approvals of policies passed  Pelosi announces she is not running for re-election in 22. BJG tweets ‚Äúding dong the wicked witch is dead‚Äù, she is ratioed, &amp; retweeted by Don Jr
As I have heard. We must choose the better of two evils. Biden would be the lesser.
Jan 2021: Biden &amp; Harris are sworn in, Briahna Joy Gray writes in Current Affairs a list of demands they have to do to earn her vote
Oct 2020: tweets photo of her voting Green, ends up the fastest ratio in Political Twitter history  Nov 2020: Biden wins, she locks her account down
They're loosing early this year because the know Biden can't win.
They aren't excited to vote for Biden, they're excited to vote against Trump
To date, are only promises with the aim of winning an election.  Perhaps Biden will flee from the Ukrainian public prosecutor in the presidency? I don't know, but I've learned not to blindly believe what a politician promises!
I'm also not sure if the whole world will see Biden winning as a victory.  They still see him as a war monger that believes in American exceptionalism.  They also talked about his incompetency and failing health during the primaries...they thought of him as big of a joke as Trump
Biden Explains Why He Picked Kamala Harris As VP!  via
Hey  you think Biden is a moderate, I‚Äôve got a bridge to sell you
Thanks, I was just about to say I‚Äôm SURE that‚Äôs how Biden says her name, even said it that way IN FRONT OF HER and she didn‚Äôt flinch or correct him!
Oh! Also, did you forget the part where Tulsi endorsed Biden?   Does that sting a lil bit? To know that the person you're lauding is supporting the better ticket?
And who do the rioters, looters, arsonists, vandals, and murderers get to blame for their actions? Biden? BLM? ü§î Lets credit Pelosi, Schumer, and all of the weak, complicit, Democrat mayors and governors who refused to do their jobs and protect the citizens.
"It was a warning that America chose to ignore,"
Khizr Khan: 'Trump may damage American democracy permanently'
Just depressing to think of the liberal reaction to stuff like Jennicet Gutierrez protesting Obama, how she was shamed &amp; derided then, would be seen as a hero if she did the same to Trump, how it‚Äôll be back to the derision from liberals under Biden
The point is that Trump is so horrible, that electing Biden, pushes voters to the left in that environment, rather than turning hippies into Qanon supporters &amp; hyper racist Trump supporters.
Does she still support Biden‚Äôs sexual assault victims??
An you say Sexual Predator?? Oh yea you already called Biden your mate that!! ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
I buy that there‚Äôs an upper bound on elasticity at some point, maybe somewhere around Biden +15, where the logic of the spreadsheet may start to break down. I just don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs unique to Utah. It‚Äôs entirely possible that after Alaska, there‚Äôs a fairly strict cutoff line.
No dude. I didn't say women and Democrats are the same thing. I said Democrats were telling us to believe women until Joe Biden came along.  Sorry if understanding how subordinate clauses work is hard.
Actually Biden would need a 30 pt lead in polls
Joe Biden has less than a snowball's chance in HELL of being President with Harris! That seals it!
#Biden-Harris #blm #Fuc*Trump. Yeah I‚Äôm ‚Äúcrimson and clover ‚Äú
The fact the Democrats are manufacturing &amp; rigging this whole election process proves to you the pathetic jerks they are!  NO one in their right mind would nominate Joe Biden.   Dems are doubling down as they always do! He's going to lose &amp; it's guaranteed with Harris! Book IT!
Biden does look stupid and Lost! Why are they doing this?  Why not just give the nomination to Harris to begin with and quit this stupid Smoke &amp; Mirrors act!
Be real for a second, what if Obama of Clinton, or Biden drove up to Montana or Texas and started grabbing people off the street in unmarked cars who they thought might be up to something. Would you rubbed stamp that shit or would you call it unAmerica &amp; fascist? Honest question.
Kamala Harris goes from accusing Joe Biden of being a rapist and racist to excitedly accepting to work for him. Which one is it? #Hypocrite
Biden staff herds compliant press away from candidate  via
So much easier to claim Biden has no policies
We're 159 days from the inauguration. Take note of what Trump &amp; his puppeteers are already doing to prevent Joe Biden from being inaugurated. Do you seriously think there is a limit to what they'll do between now and January 20? Mail-tampering is only a beginning.
Did you endorse biden yet?
ABC is so out of touch they don't even understand the difference between absentee and mail in and Trumps constant defense of absentee. ABC is as out of it as Joe Biden üòÜ
I take no joy in voting for Biden, but Trump is pushing us towards authoritarianism... the choice is pretty simple, suck it up like me and vote Dem for once. The Republicans aren't even Republican anymore, they are The Party of Trump.
He got a literal Sunrise Movement member and AOC in talks with Biden, among many other things.
I keep thinking how hilarious it would be if Trump just called them the Biden Child Cages
So funny Kumalot, let‚Äôs see how much you laugh when you and Babbling Biden lose come November.
This woman HAS to end up in the West Wing with Biden. And when she does we best be holding her accountable for nonsense like this.
‚ÄúBiden believes the Green New Deal is a crucial framework for meeting the climate challenges we face.‚Äù
80 days before Harris/ Biden vs Trump/Pence election. will it America be great again or will we be held hostage the next 4 years. Where is Hunter and Biden is the most racist person on earth. Just saying.
Barack Hussein Obama would like you to vote before the debates reveal Biden‚Äôs true level of mental deficiency.
Correction: BLM single handedly donates $48MM to Biden's campaign
While I agree that "Blue No Matter Who" in the presidential race is important, being hostile towards people with legitimate concerns about Biden/Harris isn't going to get them on your side.
I won‚Äôt survive it. üò•üò•üò•. Biden and Harris will win. We will vote even if we have to walk over hot coals or broken glass in our bare feet. We will vote and we will get rid of these criminals!
...and their union with 300,000 members just endorsed #Biden
Oh, I don't just mean interjecting on on political opinions, I mean potentially holding an office in the Biden Administration. Clinton and Biden go back a long way politically.
Major US postal workers union endorses Biden for president #SmartNews
Cool. But how many Trumpers or undecided voters are gonna go "hmm ü§î you know I never really paid attention to facts before, but now that this Black/Asian-American woman is saying those facts &amp; telling me Mike Pence is wrong, I'm gonna vote for Biden!"
I love the  ads.  has set the bar so low that all Biden has to do is wear a mask and promise to listen to the experts. #ByeDon2020

If Biden wins every state carried by Hilary and re takes PA, MI and WI then game is over
Possible that if you asked Biden about this he wouldn't remember saying it, but it's still really dark and disturbing
You might want to get used to hearing the Clinton name. With Biden potentially winning the Presidency, there is also the potential that Hillary Clinton will re-enter the political arena in some form or another.  Not to bait a rabbit mob responding. but there is the possibility.
Yeah some lawyer nobody has ever even heard of getting a soft slap on the wrist. Hopefully I'm wrong about that outcome. If that is the outcome, Republican Party is dead as dead gets. Deader than Biden. Burnt toast üî•üî•üî•
I‚Äôm not excited about a Biden Harris ticket. And I think people and survivors specifically have their very legitimate reasons for not voting for them. But if Angela Davis can settle for this ticket then so can I. Get in the car girls, we‚Äôre settling ü•¥
Hunter Biden
Republicans are so scared of a barely moderately-to-the-left Joe Biden that they are willing to dismantle the constitutionally-mandated  to win, and on top of that if we lived in a country that made sense, their party would be disbanded as a punishment.
Thank you Mitch! Now PLEASE, vote for Biden- not your wife! PLEASE!!!!!!
Over thirty million people protested this summer and yet the president could not fill an arena in Oklahoma. Not to dismiss the issue or anything, but I would tend to think Biden turnout will probably still be decisive.
Hey Jimmy, when are you clowns going to Q&amp;A Biden/Harris?
When someone offers to save you from a burning building you take their hand. Joe Biden is the hand.
"Didn‚Äôt Barr announce neither Obama or Biden are under investigation?"  you mean like when Comey said publicly and lied under oath that Trump wasn't under investigation??? and the entire time they were illegally spying on him ü§î
fake obstruction charges doesn't change what Obama did or the truth that's slowly getting declassified bit by bit  Barr won't announce charges against Obama and Biden until after some of the other big fish get fried anyway  today is just the tip of the iceberg  enjoy the showü§£
If Biden wins the entire investigation will be buried forever  #Hannity
If Biden is sinking...then what do you call Trump as thousands of Americans die and more go unemployed?
Where the fuck is  Thought he was going to help Biden get elected?
So much for unity on your part. This is divisive and narcissistic performative nonsense at a time when Democrats should be united behind the nominee, Joe Biden. You should be ashamed of yourself acting like a mere pedestrian on social media.
Staying home is better than voting for Trump. Personally, I'm voting Biden to get back to some sense of normalcy and following the rule of law.
The latest   / Marist poll found Joe Biden 11 points ahead of Donald Trump:
ü§Æü§Æü§ÆIf anyone is going to destroy our democracy its Biden and Harris!
Stop shaming people who will vote for Biden/harris. I don't want to but I know they will bend to the will of the people because their history shows it. If you don't vote then you truly are giving up and allowing people to due needlessly.  these retweets are dense.
this is a Harris-Biden team, Not a Biden-Harris team #Hannity
Yeah ask Nancy she‚Äôs a Catholic and so is Biden!
But if you don't vote then you don't get the chance to have the protests and the movement matter. Trump will never budge or change anything. But Biden/harris will have to bend to the will of the people. If history shows anything its that they do bend when it comes down to it.
Biden should not agree to debate unless a fact chk is done about every statement
If Biden was still with it I imagine he‚Äôd be pretty pissed off at whoever is writing lie after lie on his Twitter.
If Harris gets elected then I wonder if they move Biden's basement to the White House fixing to be called the Black House or move the now called Black House to Biden's basement? Just asking. lol
The USCCB said that a staffer who told the bishops‚Äô news service she was elated that Kamala Harris is Biden‚Äôs running mate spoke in a personal capacity.  The conference did not address the substance of her remarks.
Joe Biden doesn‚Äôt deserve to be President! He‚Äôs a moose knuckled tater tosser!
Ya think they had a choice? 4 more years of a lunatic or Biden!
Biden is the biggest racist on earth. Harris is the biggest fake on earth. She now thinks she is black if that gets her in power.
well, he probably didn‚Äôt pick her. The DNC picked her and then told Biden that he picked her. He knows that he can‚Äôt remember anything, so he believed them and ran with it.
So in other words they are going to censure conservative videos if they say anything about 'Baffoon' Biden or 'Lot Lizard' Harris.
Again, hope I'm wrong, but mark my words-- Biden wont be any better. In fact he'll be just as bad. And if something happens to him and Kamala becomes president? I'd expect the same fash actions as trump's regime.  I really want to be wrong : /
We do not need leaders like this. Our young people my grandkids need adults as leaders.
And Biden is somehow even less progressive than Obama. And Kamala is a fucking cop. She would rather incarcerate innocent people to let them fight fires for free than let them live their lives freely. They arent agents of change. If I am wrong Ill GLADLY eat my words.
Like Im gonna vote for biden/harris but it doesnt matter in the end, theyre still gonna bomb foreign nations most of our country will never see or be aware of, kill our own people, and subvert progress for profit. Climate change will kill us before we get anywhere
We couldn‚Äôt even hold Obama accountable, and mf‚Äôs out here pretending like we‚Äôre going to somehow hold Joe Biden to a higher standard lmaoBiden love pedophiles its up to you,  thanks
Harrrr Is a Great Role Model for little brown &amp; black girls as Biden said.
American that vote for Biden you will vote for a not American citizen like Kamara lol
Same goes for Biden.
Oh yes, we all love hearing you lie about Covid, voter fraud, starving the post office, and ridiculous shit you make up about Joe Biden. Can‚Äôt wait!!!
For #2, just go to Biden War Room. It has complete voting info for every state.
Biden isn‚Äôt a blatant liar like Donald Trump? It is scary that Trump supporters accept the transparent lies.
Biden has no clue about the virus nor doesHarris. Both have been on the sidelines attacking Trump constantly abot something they know nothing about. Frm the beginningTrump has faced every challenge/solved problems. Laughable Joe could step in &amp; eradicate it immediately.MagicWand?
I confess I'm torn. A big part of me wants the Republicans to keep the Senate to check a Biden presidency. But a big part of me wants to see a total reset of the Republican Party. Every possible outcome is largely bad. And anyway the outcome doesn't depend on what I think.
Does  pivot and start yelling about deficits the minute Joe Biden is sworn in?
President a Trump loves our country &amp; this is one example.  Joe Biden in 47 yrs made himself &amp; his family wealthy by ripping off the country.  The choice to lead the country is obvious.
I am still not a fan, but will vote for Biden no matter what.
FYI: Trump just handed Biden/Harris a golden goose on a silver platter when he tried to destroy the USPS. No matter your political affiliation millions of Americans and businesses depend on the USPS and they will protest against this to the ninth degree.
I disagree with Trump. I also disagree with  decision to run an unqualified corrupt criminal who establishment dems think has name value over Andrew Romanoff. I will vote for Biden/Harris. But I will not sell out my values and beliefs to vote for a puppet like Hickenlooper...
So my pendulum is swinging towards Biden, (sorry Tara) BUT not entirely. He &amp; Kamala need to EARN my vote. My world has been rocked.. and rolled over. Where the fuck is congress RN? America needs your help. November is coming &amp; your job may be gone. My husband‚Äôs is... #twocents
Yeah yeah if I did anything that anything like the Biden‚Äôs, they would throw me into a hole
You throw mud at Trump to seeehat sticks. Problem? Biden is all mud
Biden needs to go into a bunker and let Trump dig his own grave and throw the dirt on top of himself.
The nasty memes of Harris began the moment Biden picked her to be his running mate.  This ad targets people in their mid-thirties. It hits Trump hard because it is exactly who he is.
Yeah Biden figured out how you could pay him fo nothing but a crippling crime bill and a way to get rich!!!
I see more of a problem with the USPS endorsing Joe Biden with Democrats pushing for mail-in voting. You, of course, you miss the seriousness and significance of that.
Biden will never be known as having an original thought with the exception of confusing his sister for his wife!
Tensions linger between Biden and Obama camps throughout 2020 primary campaign: report
Trump‚Äôs been running the country very well in spite of the deep state obstructionists for 4 years. Worry about Biden - he has obvious dementia .
Soros &amp; the deep State already own Biden/Harris.
They‚Äôre just Biden time
Spent an hour waiting to get postcard stamps, to write postcards for Biden/Harris.  Turns out you have to order them online, and wait 7 days to get them.  I called your office, spoke to Hannah.  You need to be working, organizing protests, or fighting the Dictator.  Not tweeting.
Senator, it's great you're working to help unemployed Coloradans but if you don't stand up to Trump's facist tyranny that's tearing down the USPS to suppress voting rights, then you're a traitor betraying all Americans. W/ Biden's lead growing in CO, it doesn't bode well for you.
All I have is a high school diploma. I‚Äôm for Biden all the way. Maybe the undereducated would be more likely to vote ‚Äúleft‚Äù if you assholes weren‚Äôt so goddamned condescending.
I have high school diploma. I‚Äôm for Biden all the way.
Biden is a pedophile
If Joe Biden was a Republican he would have been selling insurance by 1975.  This is presidential material??
And at least Biden has the decency to clarify and apologize for a comment that came out wrong. Your dude just double and triples down on his racism
It's weird right? The world is trash right now and suddenly the bots (and Trump) are pretending Biden is the incumbent to blame it all on him.
The ‚Äúsuburban housewife‚Äù will be voting for me. They want safety &amp; are thrilled that I ended the long running program where low income housing would invade their neighborhood. Biden would reinstall it, in a bigger form, with Corey Booker in charge! -Donald Trump
Will Biden do something about the shower heads. We can‚Äôt forget the shower heads.
Less so than Trump's collision course with history. As I alluded to, with Biden we at least have a fighting chance to survive. Trump and republicans are an unmitigated disaster. Vote strategically, think long term. Vote your values locally where they especially count.
Yep, that's weird to me too. But Dem/Rep is some not sort of mirror-opposite pair. We the People at least have a voice with Dems. Republicans serve *only* the wealthy with "trickle down" as their solution to everything. Next POTUS will be Biden or Trump. Choose strategically.
I'm there.  Going to the Post Office this morning for stamps for my Biden/Harris postcards.
This is troubling. She has the right to her opinion, but this comes across as an endorsement for Biden.  Both parties do good, both do bad. What does she think about Biden / Harris stance on abortion?
Agree, lesser of two evils. But the fetus has no voice, we need to be the voice. Democrats have shown for decades that there is no budging on their pro-abortion position. Biden claiming to be Catholic yet pro-abortion? Respect human life begins with the fetus.
Nope.  Trumpism must be crushed, destroyed.  I am excited about Harris. I have confidence in Biden but it means nothing of Trump and his ilk are defeated in a devastating way
The presidential race is only one of many. Very meaningful work can be done locally. So the answer is always now. As for the next president, unfortunately it is again a two-party race - Biden or Trump. So vote Biden to fight another day. Trump is on a very destructive course.
Joe Biden if his debates are good
The context in which Biden uses the N-Word twice can‚Äôt be denied - it‚Äôs very degrading.  Curious if Obama ever saw this.
There is so much wrong in this statement, I‚Äôm not even going to bother with responding other than to say, Mr. President   YOU ARE WRONG‚ÄîAGAIN!  Vote Biden/Harris. We can do better in November!
Trump is a not representing Republican values and is hurting our nation, and the party has the audacity to call Biden/Harris radical left?
I enjoy that Presidential campaigns are turning into meme offs. Biden needs to step it up.
I‚Äôm writing Biden/Harris postcards this weekend.  Will they make it?    Or will they end up in the dead letter office?    The Post Office Is Deactivating Mail Sorting Machines Ahead of the Election - VICE
I‚Äôm already sick of Harris. She lies more than Biden &amp; Pelosi.
The Biden/Harris federal mandate to wear a mask, sounds a lot like the dictator from Bananas: Everyone must now wear their underwear, on the OUTSIDE!
Wait, so Biden working hard to make progress while Trump just sits and does nothing? I thought he was "Sleepy Joe?" I'm confused.
Kamala Harris Lies Repeatedly in First Speech as Biden's Running Mate | National Review
Listen to this guy and that man in the White House and then listen to Biden/Harris. Ridiculous points and name calling vs policies, details, and intelligent talking points. Also, complete coherent sentences.
Trump doesn't seem to understand that Biden is a private citizen and has no authority to do anything about the virus. This is what Trump does - projects his own failures onto other people.
Actually that seems like reverse thinking. Both of these men, when playing off the script and carried live, remind the other side how bad they are. At any given moment, it looks like Biden is about to have a stroke
What if the governors all started listening to Biden now? Acting like he's president...
You &amp; Biden will stop a recovering economy with raising taxes &amp; regulatory enhancements, Universal Healthcare &amp; all the other spending you want. We are energy independent finally &amp; you‚Äôll destroy oil/gas industry. ObamaBiden  had the slowest economic recivery in historyü•µ
I love opening the Fox News app and seeing a nice story about Biden above any story about trump!!  #BidenHarris2020  #TrumpKillsUSPS #TrumpVirusDeathToll167K #TrumpVirus
Donald Trump is playing political games with the postal service: deliberately slowing down mail service for prescriptions, small businesses, and to interfere with voting. We must end these attacks on the USPS and elect Joe Biden and Kamala Harris.
When Biden becomes president and appoints Obama to the Supreme Court, your appeals to your convictions to crimes in office will meet a wall. #BidenHarris2020
I hope the next Democrat after Biden (don't have much faith that guy is going to do much of anything) that gets in takes the Trump playbook, where you just try to do whatever you want, is put into effect...
Biden Leftist is the new Military Intelligence
Maybe making you rething the prespective you're incessently shouting and walking away from when someone hits a nerve?  Biden's not a help, he's an enabler.
Who Biden? Maybe it‚Äôs trump
You‚Äôre calling out CatholicVote, so you support Biden? A fake Catholic?  Really?
So you are saying you support Biden ? Please speak up, do you consider Biden, who says he is Catholic, even a good Catholic?  Answer please? Trump is no saint, but Biden ?
What the literal crazy?
And this Sunday Biden will go to church while Trump will be off on a golf course somewhere. His true religion
Bullshit!!! Obama/Biden added 11M jobs, you‚Äôve lost 11M+ jobs!!!
Don't confuse democrats; lawful, rational, voting citizens like me, with rioters.  There's a chance the rioters might vote for Biden but I'm guessing they are disconnected from society to the extent they won't vote at all.  Nobody is courting them for support; we don't need them.
Definitely will be worried about my civil rights &amp; basic dignity if Biden/Harris should be elected.  You‚Äôre The Swamp &amp; will be exposed for your corruption if there‚Äôs any justice.  You talk about Beau a lot ~ where‚Äôs Hunter?
As #TrumpKillsUSPS, ask for your ballot early, vote Biden, close your envelope, sign it and take it to a drop box near you. That is the only way to work around the corruption of Trump and his cronies, including Putin. Vote! Go the extra mile. This country depends on it
Just looked at your page. Having fun baiting people in stupid discussions? Your page has Biden/Harris on it. Either you recently, as in past few hours, changed to the dark side or you are bored and having fun baiting people into the discussion. Yes, I responded but not to did. üëã
After Trump decimates Biden in one debate, let Trump debate Harris!  He‚Äôll take them both down!  He‚Äôs been working his arse off 4 years &amp; I guarantee Trump knows all the answers.  Biden&amp; Harris have been on the sidelines demonizing him... and have no idea what‚Äôs going on.
Dementia Biden &gt; Insane Trump  Any day of the week, comrade
It wouldn‚Äôt be Biden, that‚Äôs for sure.  Trump works constantly - never stops. They even criticize him when he plays a round of golf!
So funny that now you‚Äôre saying about Trump exactly what we KNOW about Biden.
So screw the debates &amp; the rest of the campaigns - just move Biden into the White House &amp; get it over with, right?  That‚Äôs how dumb &amp; corrupt a democrat is.  Screw elections, just get on with the Marxism!
Trump will destroy Biden in a debate.
Couldn‚Äôt be that Trump will clean Biden‚Äôs clock in The debates, huh? BTW the American people will never elect senile Joe Biden/Harris &amp; take the country into Socialism.  They can sequester Biden to try to protect him but the American don‚Äôt buy it. Trump by a landslide.
And what's your qualifications to determine that?  Why should I listen to you over actual doctors that have given Biden physicals?
I think I figured it out. You don't know who this guy is. That's why you don't care he is in very public neurological decline. He's your father. You should care that he can't read any longer. At least as much as you do about Joe Biden. #TrumpIsUnwell
Hahahahaha. She‚Äôs below average. Especially if your vote is really for her and not for Biden since he‚Äôs got dementia
You are an excellent person to match with Biden. Keep him in line along with he senate üòè

I‚Äôd like to report a threat to a protectee.   A television personality is saying that Joseph R. Biden will not live to stand for election.  Her name is Jeannine Pirro and there is video evidence.
.  I absolutely loved hearing Joe Biden and Kamala Harris speak to our country today. They both are so articulate, so passionate and extremely intelligent. They love our country, they love their families and they will restore our democracy!
You Trump Haters would love to continue hiding Biden by not having debates.  What are you Trump Haters so afraid of??
He‚Äôs doing if again. Quid pro quo. You elect me I‚Äôll eliminate the tax I imposed on you. Someone tell Biden to make the same forgiveness claim.
He just gave rave reviews for Kamala Harris and referenced Biden as the next president of the US.
Also, your repeatedly calling Joe Biden "evil" sort of gives it all away.
To quote our next POTUS, "Time to get to work."  Get out there and vote, people.  Support Biden-Harris!
Notice Biden/Harris didn‚Äôt tout any of Biden‚Äôs accomplishments or successes during his 48 political career.  It‚Äôs bc he had none.  Although he &amp; his family did enrich themselves bc of his corruption.
U guys realize Biden is the same as trump only less of a cunt
Biden haters and Russian troll bots are even mad about Biden playing Curtis Mayfield. Snowflakes! They hate positivity.  #BidenHarris2020
So I'll believe the actual medical doctors who say that Joe Biden doesn't have dementia over some random person on the internet who isn't a doctor.
My guess is he might actually be taking votes away from Donald - the Republicans who just can't bring themselves to vote for Joe Biden.
Do we comment on Biden‚Äôs outfit too? Please?
So excited for Biden's VIP pick! #BidenHarris2020
Biden will suffer a ‚Äústroke‚Äù at the 11th hour and kamala will assume the nomination and pick a ‚Äúsafer‚Äù VP pick who is more like able
I mean you do know that Joe Biden deals with sluttering, right? It's a speech disorder which involves frequent and significant problems with normal fluency and flow of speech.  And it has been diagnosed as such by actual doctors, not Twitter moms. It doesn't mean he has dementia.
People whining about Biden when they had no problems with kind of insanity for the last four years, simply hilarious
I‚Äôm voting Biden-Harris.   Let‚Äôs do this.  2020üíô
Pure comedy to see Trumpers make moral arguments, or bring up corruption, or in one case "race baiting" to use against Biden/Harris vs Trump.  Republicans circled around a racist, corrupt, amoral, liar whose self absorption has caused more Americans to die than any war. FU!
I guess this is the only black person they know so they had to get him to run as a spoiler, so all black people will vote for Kanye and Joe Biden will lose????  Clueless!
May every single one of our nasty women tribe vote for Biden-Harris 2020!
This is what strikes me the most. Biden/Harris want to lead, and honestly, would any of us want this job next? The nightmare situation they will inherit is unprecedented.
Finally! This country has a big, wide ray of hope with a Biden/Harris ticket. Can we elect them tomorrow?
Wrong, Liz. Watch this. November 3rd we elect Biden/Harris. In a landslide.
. Tired of fake progressives. Don‚Äôt tell me, a brown male to vote for Joe Biden &amp; Kamala. Idc if Trump is evil. I know that. I ain‚Äôt voting for him either. I‚Äôm a revolutionary. We‚Äôre built different, tear the whole system down. Stop being complacent with oppression.
This suburban housewife is voting for Biden. #resign #TrumpVirus #BidenHarris2020Landslide
Well Biden is basically a conservative so....
Joe Biden is in the early stages of dementia.  So there‚Äôs that.
What about the Trump vs Biden debate? Isn‚Äôt that who the race is with Trump and Biden? What happened to that?
Biden can‚Äôt even read a sentence on a teleprompter, but he will unite &amp; heal us &amp; restore our soul!  You‚Äôve gotta be kidding!
Biden is their puppet.
Dr. Biden, we are all ready!
In this dystopian world, Kamala Harris sails above the presidential bar

Joe Biden‚Äôs selection of Kamala Harris as his running mate is a home run.  She‚Äôs an amazing public servant and will be a stellar VP.
#Biden chose the person who was the most critical of him, which shows that he has qualities of a leader instead of propensities of a dictator.  #BidenHarris2020 #BidenHarris
The USA is no longer a world leader.  Thank you, I hope we get health care, also.   I agree. Our climate can't wait another day. Trump gutted EPA regulations &amp; pulled us out of the Paris Accord. Biden will rectify all of that.
As I have already said, Biden was my second to last choice.  I watched Kamala shred Jeff Sessions and Bill Barr. I enjoyed it. I am sick of white men being in power.   I actually wanted a Warren/Harris ticket, but god forbid we have an all female ticket.
We can only hope that Biden/Harris do a better job.  The Democratic party has evolved since 1994.
Biden was my second to last choice.  We had numerous more qualified female candidates.
What? You trying to be funny?  Hillary just acknowledged that the Democratic ticket is Joe Biden and Kamala Harris.   Maybe Tim should stop running his mouth.
Yes, all Republicans are pro-life. Republicans voted for Trump because they think he is pro-life. They are one-issue voters.  Biden is RESPECTED by people on both sides. That's a plus.  Answer my question - you want Trump?
I'd be more ready if it weren't Harris... or Biden.... but at this point I'll take Hillary over the current dumpster fire
The guy who wanted 5 kids to get the death penalty just for being guilty of being black is trying to tell us Biden is racist. I think you better spend your dollars convincing Ohio and Pennsylvania that we are going back 50 years and returning to a manufacturing economy.
Why are you so sure it won't get better under Biden/Harris?
Hmm.  You are the only one who says that you will keep POC out of the suburbs, that will protect slave owners statues, and says BLM are terrorists.  So, I don‚Äôt think people will believe you on Joe Biden.
Lauren, you are the type of leader we need in the white House, not Trump, not Biden, not Kamala
Had to break it to you but I never said I wanted Biden to lose
Biden has been out and about following social distancing protocol. God I can‚Äôt wait for the debates to start.
these ads are already up? obviously they were afraid of #Kamala for some time now #KamalaHarris #BidenHarris #Biden #BidenVP
Trump would have tweeted that Karen Bass was a dog.  He didn‚Äôt really know her, maybe she brought coffee or something.  Joe Biden called her, like an adult, and a man who cares about America.
I‚Äôm in. Great Pick Joe Biden.
Again, criticism of Biden/Harris isn't an endorsement of Trump/Pence. It is part of demanding better - for those who think for themselves and don't tow a party line blindly, it is something that should be encouraged. We can be better than this.
I gues you have more trust in the D's and Biden than I do - I consider it almost meaningless. The dirty laundry goes way beyond her DA experience. Regardless, ignoring it, or condemning those who refuse to ignore, it is making politics worse.
After giving it some VP Biden has made the right decision picking Kamala Harris for his running mate as VP in the 2020 election.
Oh, am I going to enjoy how they‚Äôll kick your ass, Donnie. You‚Äôll be humiliated and I hope you live long enough to suffer from jail for all you‚Äôve done right after Biden takes over
People who think Joe Biden cares about me are stupid, im voting for him but only because I rather get punched in one eye than both
will eat your lunch  you have no clue what‚Äôs coming your way. Your out of your league on this one. Take a nap now while you can. #Biden #Kamala #KamalaHarris #KamalaHarrisForVP #VPHarris
Joe Biden just have a big fuck you to the people involved in the BLM movement. Why would he pick a person who put so many people of color behind bars?!
I absolutely agree. Four years of Biden, eight years of Harris! #BidenHarris #BlueWave2020
I'm not sure she can walk this back. Again, either she was lying then, or she's lying now... either way, it is unacceptable. And by pointing to Trump as a refutation, and setting the bar that low to justify this, isn't helping.
Biden just lost any chance of becoming President She is widely unliked by people on both sides
So she calls Biden a racist and believes his rape accusers. And  runs with him and you back all this? Woow
1) the argument is how she intentionally represented the issue, and her implications.  2) I know what Biden said, I agreed with him - this is about her, again straw manning Joe &amp; lying about the situation.  1/3
Yes. Now you can vote for that man in the White House.  We are fighting for our country. Vote Biden/Harris!
I don't think there was ever a question for Biden that his Vice President pick would be #KamalaHarrisForVP. I think when he said his pick would be a woman, he knew exactly who. He held everyone in suspense to create some excitement. I'm excited!  #BidenHarris2020
Now we know who picked her!  Beware!  Evil Soros hand picked Kamala for VP - Biden is an empty vessel.  Be very afraid, Patriots!   Vote Red!  Our country will be gone if we elect these anti-American Marxists.
The implications of racsim by working with desegrationists, forced bussing, and using herself (as a child) as an example. A terrible and shameless line of attack, but she did it. I recommend you look at what, and how, she said them.   Also, this:
Biden/Harris!! We deserve this! Let's make it happen, America!!!
You didn‚Äôt pick Harris; she was picked for you!  She was a vicious disgrace trying to demonize Judge Kavanaugh at his hearing &amp; many of us will never forget her vile interrogation of him.  Biden/Harris is the worst presidential ticket we‚Äôve ever seen.  Where‚Äôs Hunter?

Apple autocorrect would like to announce Joe Biden‚Äôs running mate selection, Senator Kampala Harris #BidenHarris #ByeDonJr
I can't stand her, but will vote for Biden no matter what.
Oh crap. Really? After that stunt she pulled to discredit him? Damn. Oh well. #Biden/Anybody2020.
truth Biden is a political liar and always has been and in 47 years he gave us the big time crime bill against Kamala Harris‚Äôs constituents
That Biden chose a Leftist Communist
Because ‚ÄúWE THE PEOPLE‚Äù for Biden don‚Äôt need the foolishness! People are sick of Trump and his blind followers!
Biden/Harris 2020: Get Bus...ted.
The Leftist Communists will have the Whitehouse if Biden is elected!! That is just the worst situation for America ever!!
Sitting here listening to... ...DONNIE FUCKSTICK.... blabble, blabble, blabber. WHEN ARE YOU ACTUALLY GOING TO SAY SOMETHING INTELLIGENT ?? Now that we have a Biden/Harris ticket YOU ARE RUNNING SCARED !!
Certainly the pandemic has taught everyone that our health insurance shouldn't be tied to unemployment.  I am going to hold out a little hope that Biden/Harris will do the right thing.
I‚Äôm voting Biden/Harris no matter what &amp; you should too.
everybody talking about who they wanted joe biden‚Äôs running mate to be, like bruh... i jus want herüòî
Y'all supporting Biden the pedophile? I thought we were saving our children?
I absolutely love this piece. Mail in ballots are the only way I have voted since turning 18. #2020Elections
Does this mean if I don‚Äôt vote for Trump I‚Äôm voting Biden?
Sen. Kamala D. Harris named as Joe Biden‚Äôs running mate
It‚Äôs kind of comical that Harris called Biden a racist, demanded an apology, never got it, yet is now his running mate...
What lessons does Biden pick hold for 2024 deputy PM picks here? Starmer will want to balance his ticket northwards ‚Äî Nandy has to be in with a shout. Blair did similar by picking Prescott as his running mate. Imagine Johnson/Sunak is already nailed on.
Biden/Harris! It's on like Donkey Kong!
Congrats to our first woman Vice President! There is no way Biden/Harris can lose! 2020 and beyond!
#Breaking: Biden picks Kamala Harris as VP
Neither Biden nor Pence has military experience, either. I've long respected you, your service and your positions, but this one reeks.
I doubt you "know" much of anything. Its a legitimate question - you say "no" without any proof, and then resort to lame &amp; intellectually shallow name calling.   Also, does she still believe him to be a sexual deviant?
Joe Biden confirms my exclusive:
Congratulations, Vice-President Kamala Harris!   Biden's announcement has brought me the first spark of hope I have felt in years!
Make no mistake, Kamala Harris is the real presidential candidate. If elected Joe Biden will not make it past 2/1/2021 before he is declared mentally unfit, and replaced by her. This is a bait and switch like no other.
And Biden won't become president til 2021.
Understand from Democratic Party source that Joe Biden is about to nominate Kamala Harris as his running mate
I'm thrilled! Biden made the best possible choice!
Why is Biden announcing this like a judges house episode of X Factor
We need to hold both houses of Congress and the White House. We can get there if #ProgressivesForBiden &amp; Independents join us to vote for Biden, then we should have a new president.
I am too Anna. Joe Biden is an honorable man of integrity and empathy.
And just like that trumpies try to make Biden look as bad as Trump.  This will never happen; Trump has waay too much baggage, too many accusations, too many payoffs, too many divorces and too many human failures.  #MeToo is alive and well, thankfully.
The best choice for  Biden VP should be someone who has govern,  everything else will in place.
For Biden pick as  VP  Gretchen Whitmer .......
Get on with it, Biden! Just tell us what strong female will be doing your heavy lifting! #tuesdaymood
You mean VP pick has been revealed to Biden by his top staff of course.
You have absolutely nothing.  All you can do is try to tear down Biden, because you can't run on the disastrous results of the last 3 1/2 years.  Can't wait until you're gone, and the SDNY puts 45 behind bars.  Lock him up!!
What else is new?  It's been this way since the late ‚Äò80s.  I'm rooting for Harris.  She'd make a great president if Biden were to be incapacitated.
You interpret Biden's actions as sexual.  I think they're more misplaced grandfatherly affection; not necessarily sexual.  Agree it's weird and gross, but he's not Trump with huge amounts of sexual baggage that trumpies choose to ignore.
I disagree.  There is no evidence he ever did anything sexual.  You perpetuate this false narrative.  Your cult leader did say ‚ÄúIn 10 years I'll be dating her.  Can you believe it?‚Äù.  20+ allegations of sexual assault against Trump and you perpetuate this lie about Biden.
I don't excuse it.  I think it's creepy.  I am disappointed in the DNC's selection.  I‚Äôm not voting for Biden as much as voting against Trump who is 1000x worse.  As usual it's the choice of the lesser of 2 evils.
Those videos show Biden sniffing hair, that's all.  I agree it's weird but one could make a credible case for grandfatherly affection in all cases.  Nobody has filed suit although I think a couple said it was awkward.  Contrast this with 20+ allegations against Trump.
They can sign it. No one would understand it. This is my thing. Why does his family seemed publicly obsessed with Biden's health while being publicly obtuse to their father's health?
I would vote for a Biden/Obama ticket.
Click the video to see Wednesday/Thursday. Harris is the last person right before Biden.
The entire Biden Family is corrupt &amp; they‚Äôre eager for Joe to be President so they all can enrich themselves for another 4 yrs.
if his name was Joe Biden, you would be all over this. Right?  It can't be dementia if he didn't know in the first place.
Biden has always been a Liar.
This fucking idiot right here... and people are whining about we need to make a case for them to vote for Biden.  SMFH.
How awesome would this be if Buttigieg was picked as Biden‚Äôs VP. Lmao!! ü§£ I‚Äôm really rooting for this ü§£üòâ
I hope the 51 million plus people unemployed understand that their 401K will go down when Biden is president. I'm sure this is the most pressing thing on your plate right now while you fight eviction, go to a food bank and apply for unemployment. #TrumpPressConference
I vote for B...  yes option B and Biden.
so this is tge new employment scenario under Democratic Rule and Biden huh????
Biden can‚Äôt support his own train of thought for more than a few minutes. I‚Äôm not saying he‚Äôs too old to be president, but I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs all mentally there enough to take on such a large responsibility as being the president of the United States of a America.
MI has issues.  If it makes you feel better,  3 of my family members in MI who voted for no one for Pres and 2 who voted for Trump in 2016 are committed to vote for Biden.  There is hope.
Perhaps, but it is conceivable that no vice presidential pick has ever been as important, given the general perception that Biden will not even complete his first term
Trump can make a big deal out of cutting a tax related to payroll that sounds really good to his followers, and say Biden will put it back, which he‚Äôll have to or it‚Äôll be on his watch that Social Security and Medicare fail. No win situation for Biden.
Well said.  Trump is the best President we‚Äôve ever had bc he truly cares about the country &amp; ALL Americans!  He gets no respect from the msm or Left but works tirelessly for us &amp; will defeat the hapless Biden in Nov. Biden would widen the swamp that Trump is draining.
Joe Biden rides a bike, while daddy rides a golf cart!
Ok let's tally this up. China bought Biden &amp; the resulting carnage was Hunter got a job. Russia buys Heir Father &amp; the resulting carnage is 165,564 dead from the #TrumpVirus, dozens dead from Russian bounties, &amp; 51M+ unemployed. The only good thing is #MaryTrump's bestseller.
VOTE   FOR   BIDEN   !!!
VOTE  FOR  BIDEN   TKS   !!!
TELL   ALL    TO  VOTE   FOR    BIDEN  TKS   !!!
Biden is doing just fine. Looking forward to watching his inauguration in January 2021. So will the rest of the world.
Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, Joe Biden, AOC, Chuck Schumer, Nancy Pelosi, All socialist trying to create hostility in our society to gain political power and to push their socialist agenda.
I would vote for Biden if he picked his dog Major as his running mate.
Nancy Biden
I don‚Äôt know what happened with you two, but best wishes. I‚Äôm just happy Sandy is wearing a mask and voting Biden. My world is small.
Seen Biden on a bike yesterdys, and then this:
Biden couldn‚Äôt interview a sock.
There is no way biden gets on the same stage as trump! No way!
#Biden talk about your mancunian candidate!
I remember how ineffective Kaine was/is.  If she chose him for that reason she did well. But the democrat field is so weak, i.e., the 2020 dem candidates - Biden/Harris are the best they got? üò®
Biden/Doocy 2020
Biden/Doocey 2020
Joe Biden is a Catholic ????  Don't make me puke.
Come on, Man!  You know Biden has no plan - he doesn‚Äôt have a clue what‚Äôs going on.  Trump is handling the country great &amp; will defeat you &amp; Joe in a landslide. You, President?  That‚Äôs almost as big a joke as Biden being president!
Win what? No one delights in your public demise. Get some help. Get back to writing &amp; push your art. I don't think you are hurting Biden. I think you are hurting yourself &amp; your family. I'm going to be straight with you. I am not a fan of your music. But, I hate watching this.
You'd rather have the Orange Monster in the White House for 4 more years? I know Biden's not ideal, but he'll surround himself with qualified people, not grifters. He'll at least start steering the ship in the right direction.
Do Biden voters watch Fox?
He's got some good songs but never bought a album id vote kanye way before i voted for that scumbag biden!
Joe biden isnt worthy of any vote period if ur to blind to see that u probably shouldn't be allowed to vote the guys senile he sexually assaulted tara reade he has pedophile tendencies!
Agree, I think it's possible Biden in such bad shape mentally that Cuomo could be shoed in at DNC and if so its about what gives him more votes.  Parents of children win out over unions.
Voting for Biden as soon as I land #biden #Biden2020  #BidenHarris2020  #Biden2020ToSaveAmerica  #CountryOverParty  #EvictTrump  #FourMoreYears
Seriously are Democrats brainwashed it's amazing how they say one thing and do another just like Nancy pelosi blaming Trump for not doing things fast enough on coronavirus but yet it was her dancing around in Chinatown saying to not block people and Joe Biden saying xenophobe wth
Why are you running? While I see from your platform that you are a socialist and environmentalist, you know as well as I do that your race will only impact the votes for Biden, and possibly allow Trump to win. I find that unacceptable.
Why would anyone even think this?  Can somebody defend this position or are her marbles just as loose as Joe Biden?
He wasn't trailing Biden for the last 3 years
Have you shown your father half as much interest in his medical care that you have shown Biden? I know you are kind of the ignored one because you don't have his name &amp; you don't have a vagina, but that reality that you don't SEE your father's brain is rotten fruit is glaring.
The idea that Kanye should suspend his mental illness long enough for Biden to get elected is ridiculous. The run is the disease.
No one would do what you've done!  Competent presidents would have nipped this in the bud in December of last year.  They wouldn't ignore everything around them for months.  I've been working from home in March and I don't see any end it sight -- until President Biden!
Educate yourself and read, Biden has been called out for his pro-abortion stance.Great! Biden can haul in what, 25+ that trump sexually assaulted, I‚Äôm sure Stormy would be happy to show up
needs to become Biden‚Äôs AG
Pinata is too polite... Biden is a shit pile and everyone NOW knows it !
Biden says he‚Äôll veto M4A EVEN if it passed Congress. Yet you think voting in progressives, which you admit will be a slow process, &amp; we have seen Dems will fight harder than they ever fought Trump, so it passes Congress will change his mind when 88% of Dems supporting it doesn‚Äôt
Yes, without Biden apologists. Liberals are not the left. Have a good night.
She endorsed Biden when Bernie was still in the race.
I‚Äôm not worried at all for either. Harris is going to chew Pence up and spit him out. I will guarantee you this though, Trump will not stalk Biden like he did Hillary, Biden‚Äôs from Scranton, he‚Äôs still a scrappy dude
The swamp, that's rich. He's put unqualified folk that donated money in positions of power. Devoss is clueless. And what about the unprecedented turnover and unfilled positions?  Imperfect, and yet this started with how Biden is "Imperfect". The mental gymnastics from you üôÑ
NO !  Trump canattackJor Biden's weaknesses which are many,  here's one.
She was acting like a prosecutor making an argument   Biden seems to understand
Biden's grades in class. Repeated 3rd grade, earned all C's and D's in 1st 3 semesters at University of Del. Made a whopping A in P.E. a B in English Writers and an F in ROTC and graduated 76th at Syracuse Law in 85. I had a way better GPA, maybe I should run. lol. Unbelievable.
starting to hope they actually do let Biden debate Trump just so we can get some more gaffe compilation videos
You destroyed 174,000 American lives &amp; the vibrant economy Obama &amp; Biden left in your hands. Yet like everything else you inherit, you've run America into the dirt, &amp; spent more than a full year &amp; $130M on taxpayer funded golfing trips that YOU profited from.
The Dem Party pours $ into fighting/preventing progressives as much as they can. I support all progressive candidates available, but the party fights tooth &amp; nail. We‚Äôre slowly building progressives in Congress despite the party‚Äôs best efforts. Biden won‚Äôt be forced after he wins
Biden can't interfere, right? That's one of my biggest concerns w/ him - kumbaya  days are long over. It will begin w/ DOJ , I hope. No pardons. No deals.
we knew you were cooking up this nonsense. whatever.   BIDEN 2020!
Ummm...Biden ain't winning.   Dems committed political malpractice with this ticket.  He shouldn't win. The put up a guy with severe cognitive issues. It's ridiculous.
81 days until we re-elect the most America loving, NON politician to be  f/four more years. Jobs. Security. Peace in the Middle East. Bringing troops home. Defeated ISIS. Killed Terrorists. Takes on China. IRAN. NOKO.... Obama/Biden committed Treason. That's a nightmare.
I mean, you‚Äôre making my point. Dems ARE in a position to effect change, they CHOOSE not to, why keep supporting them? Also, Biden said it himself. Now, he does have a long history of outright lying (like Trump), so I understand why taking his own word is risky, but still.
Look up his record of success focused on ALL Americans Ms. Swift. Lowest unemployment f/All Americans. Funded historic black colleges, criminal justice reform and so much more.  Biden. Harris.  Phonies. Corrupt Marxists.  Your statements are worthless. Uneducated. Factless.
So you played golf and bashed Biden while your brother was dying. You are an amazing piece of sh*t. Man am I glad I am no relation to you! Bless Robert. So sorry for his passing. üôè
What a tragic and ignorant rant.  Look up President Trump's policies.  All have been good for America after decades of corrupt politicians and 8 years of the traitors Obama/Biden admin who spied on his campaign &amp; attempted a coup d'erat.
Biden love pedophiles its up to you,  thanks
Harrrr Is a Great Role Model for little brown &amp; black girls as Biden said.
American that vote for Biden you will vote for a not American citizen like Kamara lol
You know the VP basically doesn‚Äôt do anything right?  How desperate is Biden that he is constantly taking about the bottom of the ticket? ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not just me! I picked a girl!‚Äù
Who is going to watch the DNC on Monday? Prediction of this comedy show. Someone who sounds like Biden talks showing him in the basement, Harris will talk too much, AOC gets her 60 seconds of shame and a lot of music. Yawn. lol.
üôÑ  Irrelevant Greta consistently making shit up.  1)Sit tight, the Convention is next week where Biden will accept the nomination.  2)We typically respect the notion ‚Äúone president at a time.‚Äù Although we *are* in desperate times.  3)You‚Äôre irrelevant.  #BidenHarris2020
Biden is an equal roadblock, he literally said he‚Äôd veto M4A even if Congress passed it. Dems voted FOR Trump‚Äôs budgets, surveillance powers, judges, Space Force, impeached ONLY on conspiracy against Biden. I‚Äôll give them down ballot votes, chance to prove themselves in Congress
What's this analysis based on? Why would a Biden presidency return more on ave than historical averages? Also a major factor is which party  takes the Senate..What party does the writer affiliate with??
I pray no one votes till after first debate get Biden to do at least one debate now
That has nothing to do with biden though
Joe Biden isn‚Äôt ideal but if he doesn‚Äôt take the opportunity to host briefings and press conferences in a casual morning environment drinking coffee and calling it ‚ÄúA Cup of Joe with Joe‚Äù I will RIOT
Millions out of work and facing eviction/foreclosure, 170,000 dead from COVID-19, a POTUS openly trying to suppress the vote, out of control debt...  GOP answer: Biden‚Äôs a socialist!
Same goes for Biden.
I am proud that we have such a great breadth of Democratic leaders.  The candidates who ran against Biden, all of the women who were considered for VP, our honestly impressive Congress people.  They have Trump.  The rest of the GOP went to sleep.
Can Joe Biden "Thread the Needle" Among Democrats?
A Snowden pardon would be wonderful. What can Biden offer in response for the progressives in his party?
Sanders EARNED delegates for the convention. Biden also won more delegates. The convention is where the nominee becomes official. Don‚Äôt worry. You‚Äôll get your crappy centrist candidate &amp; a platform that doesn‚Äôt include M4A, despite these votes. They still earned a voice there.
China endorsed Biden/Harris, this should be your wake up call.
Oh yes, we all love hearing you lie about Covid, voter fraud, starving the post office, and ridiculous shit you make up about Joe Biden. Can‚Äôt wait!!!
GOP: Hillary was a crook. After Trump was elected.... no investigations.  GOP: Biden is a crook. Prior to Bidens run for President... no investigations.  Its almost like they're just screwing around
Dear traitor John  No one cares about Hunter Biden or you. Forget about it Its all propaganda
We were told Biden was ‚Äúmost electable‚Äù, that he‚Äôs smashing the polls, that we, from Joe‚Äôs own mouth, should ‚Äúvote for someone else then‚Äù when asking the slightest challenging question. NOW y‚Äôall need us? Votes are earned. Biden is a serial liar too &amp; a warmonger. Your bar is low
Joe Biden. Chinese operative. Selling out America for 40+ years.
Biden is the coup, and Harris is the de gras. Jumping Joe Biden will open the door and do his four, preparing Harris to do eight more.
#JudgeJeanine this is the Harris-Biden campaign, not the Biden-Harris campaign
LMFAO!
Speaking of Q,  Now you guys are retreating conspiracy theories too? That's what trump did, you've got no leg to stand on to criticize Joe Biden as long as you support that disgusting pig.
Biden:  Put me in office and then let's talk about what we can do together  C'mon jack I know to get the money first.
I am voting early against Trump and for Biden/Harris. As soon as I receive my mail in ballot, I‚Äôm completing it and hand delivering it to the election commission office.  America deserves better than this BS Trump administration.
Anyone in the GOP does not get to talk about this.  Your grift and greed, accompanied by lies and cheats make me sick.  Shall we do an honest comparison of Biden‚Äôs plans vs Trumps?  Stop whining about being victims, and do your fucking job.
This is the first time I've ever seen a Biden flag
This
You do know that Biden did not make that call right?
IDIOTS!  Out-of-Touch Jimmy Fallon Asks Why America Needs Debates After Biden's 'Diversity' Blunder
You're just accusing Biden of being a sexual assaulter because it fits with your narrative. It's a disgusting thing to do.
Biden has said and made more sense than trump in his whole life.
I think 4 years of Corporate-Prison Biden and another 8 of Corporate-Prison Harris will end Western Democracy.  You guys need to do BG on the Dem candidates. Either party wins, we're screwed for decades to come. #NeverKamala #NeverTrump #neverbiden
You're acting like I chose Biden as the nominee, as opposed to, y'know, millions of voters
LOL.....LOL....LOL....  Trump wins by a landslide.   Fox News Poll: Trump gaining on Biden nationally  via
For #2, just go to Biden War Room. It has complete voting info for every state.
It's just insane to try to put Biden in that cabal. He's never been especially wealthy and has never been accused of anything by anyone (except for that one serial liar)
Hurray for BIDEN AND HARRIS!!! #please save us !!!!!!#BidenHarrisLandslide2020
Biden got no shot #qanon
Don't want you as a citizen either or stuck. We want Trump not you or Biden
Trump and Clinton are known adulterers with ties to a child rapist; Biden is/has neither.
lmao Biden? Who was accused by one woman that turned out to be a serial liar?
By not voting for Trump (a vote for Biden), not voting for Biden (a vote for Trump), and then voting 3rd party, you actually get 3 votes. I feel very smart knowing this.
Every politician gets at least 127,853 accusations every week minimum. It should be looked into but innocent till proven guilty. Even Biden.
Good Lord STOP embarrassing yourself.  This is VERY uncomfortable for the people who know how you achieved your position in government. You are not qualified to be there. Just like Biden. We all know this. That is all.
Nothing I hate more than identity politics----it's the #DemocraticParty's biggest weakness.....Just another reason I left the party after 2016---I follow policy.....speaking of, if Joe Biden promised to pardon Julian Assange and Edward Snowden of any crimes, I would vote for him.
LOOOOLLLLLLLL Biden thinks they‚Äôre taking personal mailboxes. What a jackass.
#Biden  Kamala Harris really thinks allot of today's young adults the 18 to 24 year olds
What? Biden and his prison bill and Harris the laughing cop? We're on the verge of having even more than 25% of the world's prisoners -- with those 2 sociopaths, we'll soon have 50%. #NeverBidenNeverHarris
the ass-kissing continues unabated. this is why Biden was brilliant to pick her. still, you could maybe do some journalism at some point.
Were we under Chinese rule under Obama/Biden? I long for the days of no drama Obama/Biden. Democracy! Growth! Sanity! This trump chaos is nauseating.
Don‚Äôt tell me I‚Äôm not pro life simply because I cannot, in good conscience, vote for a man as atrocious as Trump. He‚Äôs using evangelicals like myself, like you. He‚Äôs no more pro life than Biden; the difference is, he needs conservative Christians to win.
Joe Biden does not know who Donald Trump is.
We cant go to canada or Mexico. So...GO TO WASHINGYON DC
International students will avoid the US for at least the next 3 years even if Biden is elected. The numbers will dwindle significantly if Trump is re-elected. Those numbers won't rebound. So much MONEY lost. How do I know? I worked with international students. They spend $$$
In doing a little more checking, I can find at least 3 Popes that Biden was blessed to meet.  For a man you don't seem to think is Catholic, that's a pretty good track record.
If all goes well and Biden gets elected, do you have a plan for how conservatives can return to a functioning party willing to compromise and govern for the good of the people? I value your opinion but I see many never trumpers holding on to their intransigence.

Did he just endorse Biden/Harris 2020? Guy is lost, go sit him down somewhere.
Biden isn‚Äôt a blatant liar like Donald Trump? It is scary that Trump supporters accept the transparent lies.
Win this election, John! We have to flip the Senate! I have sent money and will send more! In October, when I get my ballot, I will vote for you and Biden/Harris immediately within a day and place it in the local drop-off box! I am advising everyone to do the same!
Sounds like he's endorsing Biden.
I do not support rapist, racist war mongers, which is why I am just as likely to vote trump as I am biden. How about you try building an argument FOR your candidate, instead of against the other one.
Actually, he is more favored to win then against Hillary. His favorability is higher than Obama at this stage in his presidency.  Liberals are lurching too far left. People will begrudgingly vote Trump in order to not have Biden.
Biden has no clue about the virus nor doesHarris. Both have been on the sidelines attacking Trump constantly abot something they know nothing about. Frm the beginningTrump has faced every challenge/solved problems. Laughable Joe could step in &amp; eradicate it immediately.MagicWand?
am i the only one that has access to other parts of the internet like idk the page on joe Biden‚Äôs website with his policies
Ok real talk I've never seen a Boat for Biden
This Election Day you‚Äôve got 2 choices: vote for Biden or vote for maybe the last time ever.
They didn‚Äôt say. Biden
Might want to watch Biden for the incoherent part

#Trump   TRUMP JUST SAID THAT " JOE BIDEN HAS NO CONTROL OVER HIMSELF " !  LOL !
I definitely think it is, that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm voting for Biden over Trump.
Joe Biden could pass away and no one would give a fuck because he‚Äôs average and not worthy of anything who in their right mind would want a bitch like Kamala Harris for President. Get the fuck outta here bitch I am voting for Trump (again!) #MAGA #BlackVoicesForTrump
Now that's funny. China knows that Lying Don is an easily manipulated fool and Biden isn't.

we don't care if she had botched her presidential run.  Biden won.  ALL the other candidates lost. we are thrilled at the ticket.  they compliment each other.  and they will be the next president and vice president of the US.
I confess I'm torn. A big part of me wants the Republicans to keep the Senate to check a Biden presidency. But a big part of me wants to see a total reset of the Republican Party. Every possible outcome is largely bad. And anyway the outcome doesn't depend on what I think.
It's not as simple as "just elect Democrats". That's a good place to start. But we can't make the mistake of folding up shop &amp; going home after the election is over: that's where the hardest work begins.

Joe Biden is absolutely correct. Pendley has no business being in charge of Colorado's public lands, and yet Trump still has this anti-public zealot in the building "to lead the Bureau of Land Management".  Why won't  speak out against this guy? #copolitics #cosen
I will grant you that a majority of people who identify as liberals ..sadly myself included, only complain when It is a Republican (is Trump really a real Republican??!) It's a serious concern for me as We get closer to the election, that if Biden wins we won't complain as much.
If you want to see nepotism and conflict of interest, take a look into the Trump administration. Hunter Biden....been there done that. Clean your own back yard.

FYI: Trump just handed Biden/Harris a golden goose on a silver platter when he tried to destroy the USPS. No matter your political affiliation millions of Americans and businesses depend on the USPS and they will protest against this to the ninth degree.
This is the best argument I've heard. Basically we are voting for who we want to fight. Do you want to fight against Trump or fight against Biden. The claim is it's easier to fight with Biden than it is with Trump. And if Biden wins his supporters will realize nothing has changed
I wouldn't leave Biden to walk my dog. The guy isn't fit for the job.

Giving Biden a heads-up, isn't the smartest tactic, imo.
No amount of Trump being bad makes Biden any better. They are both horrible picks for leadership and the public keeps allowing it to happen by voting for it. A 3rd party can win if people were smart enough to vote for them. That‚Äôs the only way we fix it.

I've been thinking the same thing. I think it does more harm to Trump than Biden.

Trump will have a sizable margin over senile r****d segregationist biden, but it's helpful if we remember that it hinges on us, and if we don't turn out, we could lose.

Excellent point. By choosing Biden/Harris he has shown Trump/Pence that he is no friend of theirs. Huge mistake by Leo. I thought he had more political savvy than to pick a winner in the US. He also is too chummy with the Chinese Communists. Another bad decision.

Biden isn't accused of 'groping' anyone.  Trump supporters decided that the 25 allegations of sexual assault, racism, incompetence, and worst economic disaster in history isn't a deal breaker.

The nasty memes of Harris began the moment Biden picked her to be his running mate.  This ad targets people in their mid-thirties. It hits Trump hard because it is exactly who he is.
How about Vice President Biden?
Biden also openly called for the arrest of anarchists. I agree with your assessment, the democrats are 2016 Republicans. They just are not loud and crude.
They only impeached him for going after biden. They had no mention of the crimes he has committed. If they really wanted to impeach AND remove him, they would've made a case with teeth.

You might want to get used to hearing the Clinton name. With Biden potentially winning the Presidency, there is also the potential that Hillary Clinton will re-enter the political arena in some form or another.  Not to bait a rabbit mob responding. but there is the possibility.
Yeah some lawyer nobody has ever even heard of getting a soft slap on the wrist. Hopefully I'm wrong about that outcome. If that is the outcome, Republican Party is dead as dead gets. Deader than Biden. Burnt toast üî•üî•üî•
I‚Äôm not excited about a Biden Harris ticket. And I think people and survivors specifically have their very legitimate reasons for not voting for them. But if Angela Davis can settle for this ticket then so can I. Get in the car girls, we‚Äôre settling ü•¥
Hunter Biden
Republicans are so scared of a barely moderately-to-the-left Joe Biden that they are willing to dismantle the constitutionally-mandated  to win, and on top of that if we lived in a country that made sense, their party would be disbanded as a punishment.
Thank you Mitch! Now PLEASE, vote for Biden- not your wife! PLEASE!!!!!!
Over thirty million people protested this summer and yet the president could not fill an arena in Oklahoma. Not to dismiss the issue or anything, but I would tend to think Biden turnout will probably still be decisive.
Hey Jimmy, when are you clowns going to Q&amp;A Biden/Harris?
When someone offers to save you from a burning building you take their hand. Joe Biden is the hand.
They‚Äôre just Biden time
"Didn‚Äôt Barr announce neither Obama or Biden are under investigation?"  you mean like when Comey said publicly and lied under oath that Trump wasn't under investigation??? and the entire time they were illegally spying on him ü§î
fake obstruction charges doesn't change what Obama did or the truth that's slowly getting declassified bit by bit  Barr won't announce charges against Obama and Biden until after some of the other big fish get fried anyway  today is just the tip of the iceberg  enjoy the showü§£
If Biden wins the entire investigation will be buried forever  #Hannity
Dude over here tweaking about this. Typical. Vote Biden 2020
If Biden is sinking...then what do you call Trump as thousands of Americans die and more go unemployed?
Where the fuck is  Thought he was going to help Biden get elected?
So much for unity on your part. This is divisive and narcissistic performative nonsense at a time when Democrats should be united behind the nominee, Joe Biden. You should be ashamed of yourself acting like a mere pedestrian on social media.
I‚Äôm attending Joe Biden for President‚Äôs event, ‚ÄúProgressives for Biden Convention Watch Party‚Äù ‚Äì sign up now to join me! #TeamJoe
Staying home is better than voting for Trump. Personally, I'm voting Biden to get back to some sense of normalcy and following the rule of law.
The latest   / Marist poll found Joe Biden 11 points ahead of Donald Trump:
ü§Æü§Æü§ÆIf anyone is going to destroy our democracy its Biden and Harris!
Stop shaming people who will vote for Biden/harris. I don't want to but I know they will bend to the will of the people because their history shows it. If you don't vote then you truly are giving up and allowing people to due needlessly.  these retweets are dense.
Maybe I‚Äôm missing something but Pence pardoning him for what if he‚Äôs not been charged for anything before Biden enters office?
this is a Harris-Biden team, Not a Biden-Harris team #Hannity
Yeah ask Nancy she‚Äôs a Catholic and so is Biden!
But if you don't vote then you don't get the chance to have the protests and the movement matter. Trump will never budge or change anything. But Biden/harris will have to bend to the will of the people. If history shows anything its that they do bend when it comes down to it.
Biden should not agree to debate unless a fact chk is done about every statement
If Biden was still with it I imagine he‚Äôd be pretty pissed off at whoever is writing lie after lie on his Twitter.
If Harris gets elected then I wonder if they move Biden's basement to the White House fixing to be called the Black House or move the now called Black House to Biden's basement? Just asking. lol
The USCCB said that a staffer who told the bishops‚Äô news service she was elated that Kamala Harris is Biden‚Äôs running mate spoke in a personal capacity.  The conference did not address the substance of her remarks.
Joe Biden doesn‚Äôt deserve to be President! He‚Äôs a moose knuckled tater tosser!
Ya think they had a choice? 4 more years of a lunatic or Biden!
Biden is the biggest racist on earth. Harris is the biggest fake on earth. She now thinks she is black if that gets her in power.
well, he probably didn‚Äôt pick her. The DNC picked her and then told Biden that he picked her. He knows that he can‚Äôt remember anything, so he believed them and ran with it.
So in other words they are going to censure conservative videos if they say anything about 'Baffoon' Biden or 'Lot Lizard' Harris.
Again, hope I'm wrong, but mark my words-- Biden wont be any better. In fact he'll be just as bad. And if something happens to him and Kamala becomes president? I'd expect the same fash actions as trump's regime.  I really want to be wrong : /
We do not need leaders like this. Our young people my grandkids need adults as leaders.
And Biden is somehow even less progressive than Obama. And Kamala is a fucking cop. She would rather incarcerate innocent people to let them fight fires for free than let them live their lives freely. They arent agents of change. If I am wrong Ill GLADLY eat my words.
Either vote for Biden/Harris or STFU and leave!
Like Im gonna vote for biden/harris but it doesnt matter in the end, theyre still gonna bomb foreign nations most of our country will never see or be aware of, kill our own people, and subvert progress for profit. Climate change will kill us before we get anywhere
We couldn‚Äôt even hold Obama accountable, and mf‚Äôs out here pretending like we‚Äôre going to somehow hold Joe Biden to a higher standard lmao
How could this possible be a conflict of interest?  Wink! Wink! look over here there is nothing wrong with #MailInVoting #MailInBallotFraud
#Tucker it is not "the Biden-Harris team", it is "the Harris-Biden team"
Biden who?
people like "stop badmouthing kamala and biden, we need democrats even if its just baby step changes for the better!!" lmao bitches the world wont survive any more incremental change, this is beyond the time for dramatic and massive change or we will die as a species but ok mb
Have u all noticed a lot of ads for Biden and not one for Trump on this platform? Trump got Twittergated and we know it. Indictments are coming. I believe the report is complete and getting plenty of popcorn and lots of beers. lol
Y‚Äôall bout to go vote for Biden . Him and Kamala more racist than trump ü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
They would be asked policy questions and have to explain their current socialist agenda. Biden is currently leading in the polls, why upset the Apple cart.
The legislature would change that and they have a veto proof majority. This was discussed at length when Warren was being considered for VP. It will be a non issue if Biden wants her in his cabinet, as it would have had she been chosen.
Yes please. Let‚Äôs vote him out. Biden has members of Sunrise on his team at the very least.
So now it‚Äôs Bernie Sanders and Kamala Harris, everyone knows Biden is just a vessel for the far left.
Hannity will be whining this guys name like Uranium One. All through the Biden administration. Unlike with trumps friends, he will likely face punishment, and serve his time if convicted.
Biden wasn‚Äôt the best pick given the field of candidates. But, he‚Äôs the only alternative to Trump.
I don‚Äôt support any of these people in any way whatsoever, but, umm, I‚Äôm pretty sure Lenin, Mao, etc would be laying the groundwork for a revolution, not endorsing Biden üòÇüòÇ
You are no more aware than Biden.
Like we‚Äôre prospering now? Get the fuck outta here!!  #Biden-Harris2020
I would crawl through a prison sewer like Andy Dufresne at Shawshank to vote for Biden/Harris
Not a Biden sign.
Well I‚Äôm not going to defend Biden. Why the democrats chose an old white guy is beyond me, but even with his weaknesses he‚Äôs still several times better than this incompetent President.
Yeah but I think we are getting better. I am a little weary of them cause if do win will want conservative policies but nice helping Biden win.
Kamala Harris probably won't be a loud voice advocating for legalization, but she can reassure Joe Biden about the California experience. It's gonna be okay, Joe. Legalization works.  by  #CannabisCulture #CannabisSociety #ColoradoCannabis
Spent an hour waiting to get postcard stamps, to write postcards for Biden/Harris.  Turns out you have to order them online, and wait 7 days to get them.  I called your office, spoke to Hannah.  You need to be working, organizing protests, or fighting the Dictator.  Not tweeting.
What does she care? She‚Äôs not running for office or is she? Maybe she has been offered a seat on the Biden Harris Cabinet of Undetected or Unpunishable Crime.
Uh that parody is joe Biden saying back during busing he didn‚Äôt want his kids going to a jungle school. Look it up dummy.
Do you still trust USPS with your ballot?  #copolitics #coleg #usps #Election2020
Progressives on MSM saying they're dedicated to their principles and goals and that supporting Biden/Harris isn't really giving in. Huh #NeverBidenHarris
Few steps forward followed by miles in reverse... ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Yet you‚Äôre voting for Biden simply because he‚Äôs a democrat... please
Doing nothing and a watching it happen is just as bad as doing it. Trump is bad, but Biden is right there neck for neck
Huh? What‚Äôs that even mean? You contantly teeet about Biden, so....?
Biden would have no response. No response is the same as a bad response. Biden was missing for like 6 weeks of his campaign and you somehow think that makes a promising presidency ü§î seriously questioning your logic
If I were Biden I would hire this dude and spray paint ‚ÄúNew World Order‚Äù on the front...
Oo we got vocab now! Literally everything on that little list you made Biden has said he will make no change to. I don‚Äôt get where you think he will do anything better. He has said numerous times he will change nothing
I always hope so, but does it actually?   And though I hate voting for the lesser of two evils, I‚Äôm afraid to not vote for Biden becuas trump has got to go!
Say one is better (between trump and Biden) than the other makes me question your ethics. They are the same. To sit there and ask me ‚Äúwhat would you rather have - the same shit for 4 years in red or the same shit for 8 but in blue??‚Äù Of course I‚Äôll pick the 4 years
Both the Republican and Democrat nomination this year are fucking trash people are only voting for Biden because they don‚Äôt like trump and vise versa. No one looks at actual facts anymoreü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Corporate news works for the same donors as the ones donating to Trump.  Corporate news might be happier w/ Trump, juicier stories. Biden will be boring at best.
I don‚Äôt think anybody is worried California won‚Äôt go for Biden. More worried about Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan, North Carolina, South Carolina ...
Biden / Harris is the Fakest ticket I have ever seen. Totally propped up by media
No. But I have at least 2 close friends, not trumplicans, who are refusing to vote for Biden. It's...insane. And I've told both of them that. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
And so has the country apparently. Biden‚Äôs lead has moved into double digits.
Isn't that Biden's argument?
To EVERYONE - if you want to keep your Post Office better vote Biden
I think you and I disagree on Trump and Biden and the legitimacy of Catholic's voting for one or the other. I do appreciate you fighting against racism. Come to Denver and let's grab a beer.
Trump supporters tell me a third party vote helps Biden. So, which is it?
Yeah and some of his takes are pretty decent (only watched like 5 or 6 vids kuz they long). Today is him saying lenin would vote for biden was a special kind of silly üòú
Fair enough. But it isn't Trump supporters who made it mandatory Biden choose a "black woman." The birther thing is nonsense. Incidentally, we are all fed. Aren't we? We can choose the restaurant. You choose CNN, NYT, WAPO, MSNBC etc. I choose FOX, WATI, conservative talk radio.
Biden seems to have done fine. A distinguished congressional career spanning decades. Well respected VP, both in the United States and abroad. Presidential candidate. Soon to be president. And he‚Äôs a good and decent man. Yep - Joe‚Äôs done alright... #BidenHarris2020
Beau Biden did not have to go to Iraq. He was DE Atty Gen'l. Bob Mueller is a decorated Vietnam vet. If you vote for a coward, you might as well be one yourself.
Clearly messing with mail-in-ballots is the real issue, but I Trump is also sabotaging the mail to prevent by Biden Harris T-shirt from getting here promptly.
I hate Harris so much, I'll never vote for Biden.  This week I realized Trump can win again.  I see the stupid Obama-Clinton   running the same failed campaign as in 2016.   #NeverKamala
I know republicans don‚Äôt believe in polls, for good reason, but there are strong indications that it‚Äôs gonna be a landslide win for democrats. I‚Äôd rather be Biden in the lead by 11 than Trump down by that much. You can only pull off so many miracles when you don‚Äôt believe n Jesus
The tRump scum, bag man, that is heading up the USPS should be charged with election fraud by the Biden Administration
and... we're supposed to trust #MailInBallots??? WTH?  Postal workers union endorses Biden, warns 'survival' of USPS at stake  via
Everyone except me? I ALONE!!  I watched interview clip and an interview w/ Barnet. I think the ‚Äúare you a junkie?‚Äù question was a continuation of his hypothetical. But, I like Biden. You have your preference. I have mine. The original post was on trump‚Äôs lies not Biden‚Äôs brain.
The Simpsons say VOTE FOR BIDEN
Joe Biden lying again... what a shock.
It was a solid press conference, now let‚Äôs have the Biden team answer some unscripted questions
The Dems were asking people to vote woke three times in a row, and since the economy wasn't tanking anymore, in 2016 the voters could react. This time a Biden/Harris vote is only about 1/3 woke. People can handle that.
Biden's campaign was in the toilet without any electors &amp; then Obama &amp; the DNC stepped in. I didn't like him in '88 &amp; I still don't.
Great news about silent majority: My daughter has a friend who has 4000 FB followers. She‚Äôs a young person in profession where she meets wide variety of people. Her followers are diverse. She put out the question, Biden or Trump, no discussion. Vast majority said President Trump.
Do you remember the Obama campaigns?   You could see vast support in places beyond Twitter.   I see it now, but not for Biden.   Biden and McCain signs are 1 in the same.
Ever seen a Biden yard sign?   Yea me neither.
Look at the little CNN, MSNBC puppets...no questions for Biden or the other one.
Nixon was more liberal than Obama, and president my boss was more liberal than biden...
Defeating trump and letting Biden become President for 8 years is an equal if not greater threat because it‚Äôs more long term. I don‚Äôt get what you‚Äôre not getting
It's temporary and who's wishlist is UBI on?   During primary the Democrats HATED the idea of UBI.  The liberal media literally ignored him, called him wrong name, showed pictures of random Asian guy claiming he was Yang.  If UBI was on wishlist Yang would be nom, not Biden.

Don‚Äôt say that, you will hurts his feelings, especially as Biden‚Äôs lead moved into double digits across multiple polls today...
Biden is the most racist person on earth. BTW where is Hunter?
Great news about silent majority: My daughter has a friend who has 4000 FB followers. She‚Äôs a young person in profession where she meets wide variety of people. Her followers are diverse. She put out the question, Biden or Trump, no discussion. Vast majority said President Trump.
Look at this headline. Biden isn't supposed to be president for very long. Soros is trying to put communist Kamala in the Oval Office. NO thank you!

In CA, OR and CO, no matter how the people vote, those states will go to Biden.
President Trump  CREATED the biggest economic expansion in history. Lowest unemployment f/all in history.  Brought manufacturing back to the USA. Trade Deals! America First!  Obama/Biden=FAILURE. Economic disaster. Foreign policy disaster.  Harris &amp; Biden: Serial LIARS.
Huh? SS has spent over 400k annually on his golf trips. Him paying himself with GVMT $ negates the "not receiving pay"  I'm not voting Biden, I can't stand the current left politicians, but I'm also not a moron that falls for Trump's BS.   Keep being a blind follower, you do you.
Joe Biden is not fit to be president..he hides in the basement and all you idiot's speak for him. You are just using his name with the help of his wife..you should be ashamed of yourself. Talking about Bo...the one thing he has left to remember and you used it.
Biden and Harris our coming for our guns while calling for refunding the police. I'm out, Trump it is.
I'm being an adult and not voting for Biden.
How am I toxic for responding to your claim?   Also, I‚Äôm not a Bernie Bro, but a registered independent.   Like most independents, I don‚Äôt like the choices, but between Biden and Trump, the choice is obvious.
Would a dog wear pants like this? (Trump) Or like this? (Biden)
Pay attention Colorado, Wyoming, NM, MT, PA, OH, WV... Biden/Harris will KILL oil and gas.
The US Postal Workers Union just endorsed Joe Biden
The US Postal Workers Union just endorsed Joe Biden. ü§£ü§£
Can you imagine Biden doing an interview with anyone where he wasn‚Äôt tightly controlled,  much less someone who will ask tough questions?   His brain would melt down.  Don‚Äôt know how much longer they can keep up the charade.
Biden gave us Clarence Thomas üôÉ
Yup and Harris will take over if elected and Palosi will be VP.Biden will probably announce his retirement on Jan. lol.
What it really sounds like is you are voting for Biden, and I don't like neoliberals!
Twitter/Social Media is always toxic, however the ‚ÄúBiden and/or Kamala isn‚Äôt who I wanted but we HAVE TO vote for them‚Äù and the ‚Äúyou can‚Äôt criticize them!! they‚Äôre our only hope!‚Äù is gross
Maxine Waters says Biden 'can't go home' without Black woman as VP - Business Insider
Babbling Biden and Kumalot will remove 100,000 a day.
Biden and Harris are all about confiscating guns and lobbing the softball term "mandatory buyback". So they don't want the police to protect us and they don't want us to protect ourselves. I'm Out, #Trump2020
Senator, it's great you're working to help unemployed Coloradans but if you don't stand up to Trump's facist tyranny that's tearing down the USPS to suppress voting rights, then you're a traitor betraying all Americans. W/ Biden's lead growing in CO, it doesn't bode well for you.
Biden was VP for eight years and has spent his life in Congress. He knows the countries. He had a press release yesterday naming them and the limitations of the deal Trump "negotiated."
The Postal Workers Union just endorsed Joe Biden. ü§£ü§£
Seriously Biden has to dial this back or Trump will crush him and idiot libs won‚Äôt understand why.
lol when did Biden say he would be one term lololol I swear
Perhaps why they‚Äôre having so much trouble framing Biden...not your typical ‚Äúliberal elite‚Äù, so the canned attacks fall flat.
Biden and Harris actually know what their doing
#thanksobama and yes Joe Biden will be the fist President to rebuild a better economy for a second after being being VP when it was done the 1st time! All trump has done is ride on Obama's coattails and try to take credit for the things Obama has already done.. trump is a loser
Biden just said him and Obama were responsible for the peace deal between Israel and the UAE that was signed yesterday. These two idiots really need to get their stories straight.
It's not about beating Trump, it's about UHC, jobs, housing, and peace. Biden-Harris have nothing to do any of these. The party needs to be rebuilt from the ground up.

Of course, the odds right before the election more closely reflect polling average, where the odds now factor in three months of uncertainty. Bush in 2000 squandered a bigger August lead than Biden's.
But to point out the obvious. If he does not concede, his followers will stand behind him. Many of them have guns. Most, probably. They also make up the majority of LEOs, military, secret service, etc. It could take more than just "swearing in Biden" for transfer of the office.
‚ÄúBut Kamala is a cop and Biden votes for the Crime Bill.‚Äù
I do understand that.. maybe you‚Äôre not comprehending that I‚Äôm not a trump supporter nor am I supporter of Biden because I support the people that make this country run, not just rich people. I don‚Äôt know why you care so little
When will Biden answer questions?

All I have is a high school diploma. I‚Äôm for Biden all the way. Maybe the undereducated would be more likely to vote ‚Äúleft‚Äù if you assholes weren‚Äôt so goddamned condescending.

If the race does not start to tighten in the coming months, will the forecast start to favor Biden more? I‚Äôd like to hear Nate‚Äôs thought about that.
Awesome. 832 days till Biden's retirement party.
I love how Trump bashes Biden for not taking questions, yet Trump might take the question but not answer it.
Dude. You‚Äôre funny. Biden can barely function. Trump is the only one that can get it DONE
I would like to see a #Biden campaign ad that is just a compilation of  gutting Trump officials during hearings. #BidenHarris2020
Biden trying to take credit. Why?
Biden does not like Harris and Harris does not like Biden. It was obvious 3 days ago. He can't even operate his phone cause it was upside down. It is a disgrace and a sham show.
Trump gets tough questions from the media, Biden has not been asked one tough question yet. Biden tries to take credit for the mid east peace talks and how does that happen when he has been in the basement forever. Unbelievable. And the Dems think he can win that way.
As the article notes: "If the court agrees, that could increase the likelihood that the results of the presidential race between President Donald Trump and presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden won‚Äôt be known for days after the election."
Come on, you gotta admit there is nothing exciting about Biden. And Camel Toe was so exciting she finished last in the primaries and one of the first to drop out.  The Democrats didn‚Äôt even like her ü§£ü§£ü§£
Yes I‚Äôm going to vote for Biden/Harris because I live in a swing state. Yes I think it‚Äôs incontrovertibly true that they have used their careers to make the world a worse place and they both deserve the wall. Yes I think voting for them makes me complicit in doing evil.
‚ÄúBallot Handlers Endorse Biden‚Äù  This is fine.
Biden is a pedophile

The only people attracted to the Left are BLM and Antifa sympathizers. Biden has lost the moderates and swing votes and maybe even the black vote.  It‚Äôs already over. We didn‚Äôt believe the fake news in 2016 so why would we believe them now.
It is about my rights! Joe Biden is a civilian, just like me. He's not a policy maker, just like me. Fear mongering &amp; stepping on my toes to move his agenda is 100% about my rights. I comply with wearing a mask inside if I am going to be within 6 feet of others but not outside!
get in the same boat with the rest of us, and let's row back to shore, because we are way out in the deep end with no captain. vote for Biden/Harris because at least they aren't criminals should be their 2020 campaign tag line.
You know they won‚Äôt. Only cover for cowering Biden the fool. The media is dead and it‚Äôs just all Yellow Journalism.
And you think Biden will open pandoras box in allowing previous presidents to be imprisoned???? Every living president deserves to be in jail, including president "my boss"...
So now Biden is anti-windows and anti-steak knives?
and Biden didn't just vote for the Iraq war himself, he's even more culpable as he also whipped other Dem Senators into voting for it.
I actively voted for Sanders and contributed to his campaign. I‚Äôm passively voting for Biden.
I voted for Sanders in the primary. I‚Äôm not out here vote shaming anybody. I stated why I am choosing to vote for Biden because of the people in my family and community who are immigrants, low wage workers, and rely on social welfare. I don‚Äôt have your ideological purity
I agree. I also don‚Äôt like Biden or Harris. But I‚Äôve never liked any presidential candidate I have voted for.
We so very much need to come together &amp; FIGHT tRump &amp; help people vote SO I HOPE WE ALL FOLLOW EACH OTHER OUT OF  SOLIDARITY TO HELP ELECT JOE BIDEN &amp; KAMALA HARRIS!
The spin machine will not accept that the left bashed President Trump for his brave decision to shut down travel &amp; months later agree it was a good decision. That would have been 2 more months of exposure if Hillary was at the helm and Joe Biden would not even be a consideration!
yep, saw a dude this morning arguing that ‚Äúvoting against the iraq war was seen as an act of treason‚Äù to justify why biden voted yes
Joe Biden was a WONDERFUL VP for President Obama! HE WILL BE A POTUS FOR ALL OF US! #BidenHarris2020
how‚Äôve they been faring under biden and kamala?
The burden of proof lies with the one making the outlandish claim my dude. I don‚Äôt need to prove Biden is or isn‚Äôt anything. You do. And you can‚Äôt because all you have are made up conspiracy theories bred on message boards.
#Trump2020LandslideVictory  The exchange of embassies between Isreal and the UAE is a demonstration of Trumps negotiating ability.  For those that claim that he is beligerant Trump has a plan.  That plan required going against the established doctrine of BIDEN, OBAMA CLINTON.
I can't watch the news or news commentary (Fox News, MSNBC, CNN) without getting furious. I hate Trump and I hate Biden....there's no one to root for. That is a hollow, fucking, feeling. #Biden2020 #Trump2020, #BidenHarris2020, #TrumpPence2020---#NoMatterWhoWinsAmericaLoses

Have you watched Trump speak lately? And you think Biden is the one in cognitive decline? You may want to reevaluate why you believe what you believe. Do you believe it because of evidence, or just because Trump told you too. Trump has serious cognitive issues.
Vote for Biden.  Do you still want a country worth fighting for

Vote Biden.  It is your best chance for the healing of America.
They aren‚Äôt in terms of views but if you are telling me right now that one party is better than the other and that trump is better than biden or vice versa then you‚Äôre wrong
I don‚Äôt like either party, I think both Trump and Biden are horrible candidates to represent the United States.
I always let you look at those press meetings instead of me having to do so. I‚Äôll always wait for Biden and Harris‚Äô pressers now.

And at least Biden has the decency to clarify and apologize for a comment that came out wrong. Your dude just double and triples down on his racism
Vote for Biden.
Trump can win this - don't delude yourself into thinking otherwise.

I will never forget that Obama/Biden left Otto Warmbier.
Too many of us are complacent when Dems are in power. If Biden gets elected, it‚Äôs our job to hold him accountable through direct action, public art, letter writing, calling, and actual activism (as opposed to snarky memes and twitter hashtags).

Where were you when our rights were stripped away by the Patriot Act? (Which Biden helped write)?   Where were you when the Obama admin orchestrated brutal police violence against Occupy?  Where were you when people were brutalized at Standing Rock for a pipeline that is leaking?
Truth. I haven't been excited about Biden since he announced his run.
The Ds were told in advance about covid too, and all they did was sell their stocks. Would Biden have handled this slightly better? Probably. Would we still have 60 million unemployed and 30 million homeless? Probably.

I disagree,  With  Biden has chosen to NOT alienate many former  voters. Correct, his voting block is a lock, but he needs US to push him over the edge. A #Socialist would have blocked that.
Less so than Trump's collision course with history. As I alluded to, with Biden we at least have a fighting chance to survive. Trump and republicans are an unmitigated disaster. Vote strategically, think long term. Vote your values locally where they especially count.
Appears to show? I hope Biden/Harris are working on police reform right now.
Biden/Harris do not have a solution. Sanders/Warren/Castro are nursing the divide in Texas, hoping O'Rourke never becomes accepted as a national figure. This is what gerry mandering and urban enclaves do. They nuture extreme positions in both parties.
Show me where in the Biden/Harris policy they mention any of the things you‚Äôre listing? They‚Äôre not there.
Yep, that's weird to me too. But Dem/Rep is some not sort of mirror-opposite pair. We the People at least have a voice with Dems. Republicans serve *only* the wealthy with "trickle down" as their solution to everything. Next POTUS will be Biden or Trump. Choose strategically.
Also worth noting Biden/Harris aren‚Äôt Sanders/Warren
I'm there.  Going to the Post Office this morning for stamps for my Biden/Harris postcards.

This is troubling. She has the right to her opinion, but this comes across as an endorsement for Biden.  Both parties do good, both do bad. What does she think about Biden / Harris stance on abortion?

Agree, lesser of two evils. But the fetus has no voice, we need to be the voice. Democrats have shown for decades that there is no budging on their pro-abortion position. Biden claiming to be Catholic yet pro-abortion? Respect human life begins with the fetus.

And how is that different from you saying you don‚Äôt want to vote for Biden because of what some of his supporters say to you?
Commissar Biden‚Äôs latest dictate is outrageous and not based on research. It‚Äôs totally political and a foretells what he and Harris would do as POTUS and VP. Vote Trump and Republican in November. Save our constitutional democracy. MAGA
My point is this: You can go ahead and vote for Biden but the blood on your hands won't make you sleep any better. I'll fight anyone of you.
Awesome article with good quotes contrasting styles between the two. Fascinating study in leadership, relationships and frayed bonds.
I don't like it at all. Trump has no problem going left during a pandemic. He can pull it back though. Biden can't.

Campaign funds will pay it off, kinda like the funds used to pay the $465,000 that Hunter Biden owed in back taxes last week.
Biden/Harris failed to discuss anything about the need for increased focus on maximizing the availability of widespread, cheap, rapid, and frequent antigen testing, the existing technology that would enable schools, businesses, and other public spaces to open safely.
I keep hearing how Biden is so great at getting, processing, and making decisions based the advice of experts. This ridiculously lacking expression of current priorities leaves me with zero confidence in his abilities in that regard.
How can this be the culmination of Biden's effort to express pandemic policy improvements based on expert advice??!!!  This statement isn't slightly accurate based on the science.   #expertbiden #biden2020 #bidenscience #masksoutside #Unity2020 #anotheroption2020 #2020otheroption
After all the comments on my OMG tweet about golden showers I know one thing for sure; Biden is going to need a new mattress in the White House #Bidenwillneedanewmmattressinthewh
You know Obama/Biden built the cages and put kids in them prior to Trump
Joe Biden &amp; Kamala Harris both said that they are going to rase income tax fees, confiscate our Guns and further rule us under the table.  They are lying to America now and it will get worse latter on.  Please think before filling in the box or pulling the handle.
nobody (on the left) is arguing that biden's handling of the protests will be good but what we do know is that obama never deployed secret gestapo vans to sporadically kidnap people off the streets and we can be cautiously optimistic that biden also won't do this
Is this same guy going to ask Biden and Kamala that, that‚Äôs all they have done the last two days.
it's bizarre how many lefties base their entire personality on being mean to people but as soon as someone puts them in their place for their birdbrained "trump iz akshully better then biden becuz accelarationism" take it's back to civility and decorum and respecting opinions
Great news about silent majority: My daughter has a friend who has 4000 FB followers. She‚Äôs a young person in profession where she meets wide variety of people. Her followers are diverse. She put out the question, Biden or Trump, no discussion. Vast majority said President Trump.

Good 4 Biden
So Biden and Harris have both repeatedly lied since they were introduced yesterday, if they keep it up they should be asked the same question.
the pandemic response under biden is just going to be him shouting "take the vaccine, dummy!" without providing any aid to communities that will inevitably be unable to afford the vaccineüôÉ
So proud of President Biden and his outstanding leadership!
Trump ramps up sexist rhetoric against political rivals  trump has no shame. So I am not  ashamed of voting for Biden. Maybe we can get our country back in order after this disaster of an administration. America deserves better.
Quite the talk you gave this morning   So, if I heard you correctly, as a woman, I'm more empathetic and will be voting for Biden.  BUT, if I were a man, I'd be voting for Trump because 'men just want to get things done' with Trump.  Quite insulting.
Biden getting ahead of the game with the pandemic. Not even in office yet he is ahead of trump already with the virus. What a stark contrast in briefings.
That didn't take long, just over 24 hours since #Biden announces #Kamala as running mate and dominating the news cycle #Trump drops the hammer and announces major foreign policy win in the #MiddleEast, the #abrahampeaceaccord. What a way to change the narrative of the #newscycle.
If they get there with the electoral college then that‚Äôs how the system works. You absolutely can not compare voter fraud to Trump settling on some case. That‚Äôs nonsense. Biden is up to his eyeballs in fraud with his family. Thus is about the high potential for voter fraud.
Now do Biden mispronouncing her name several times yesterday, including when he introduced her, does it not matter because he‚Äôs an old guy with Dementia or because he‚Äôs a Democrat?
They were talking about an article by CNN that literally said Biden might be replaced by Harris at the top of the ticket. Gutfeld had the article with him, reading from it.
Biden mispronounced her name three times yesterday, if your own running mate can‚Äôt pronounce it correctly it really shouldn‚Äôt matter.
So I guess that makes Biden a sexist since he totally mispronounced her name when he introduced her. ü§°ü§° Has Don Lemon‚Äôs sexual harassment suit been resolved yet?
It was just too funny hearing CNN try to demean Tucker Carlson for mispronouncing Kamala‚Äòs name. They reamed him in the very next day Joe Biden said at the exact same way.
buddy really took biden quotes and used them against trumpüò≥üò≥ shiii he got him
This is what a Biden administration will bring to the country.
Why Sarah Palin Is Trending Ahead of Biden's VP Pick Announcement
I'm sure Biden and Harris will lean real hard into the Bernie wing.
48 of Biden vs 4 years of Trump, I would take Trump all day long.
When Biden does it:  ‚ÄúOh no.‚Äù When Tucker does it:  ‚ÄúRacist!‚Äù
prior to having kamala as biden‚Äôs vp pick, i was still apprehensive about biden. now, i will actually be excited to vote #bidenharris this november.
No evidence Obama and Biden did anything to spy on the Trump campaign. No basis for the claim this is going to be a rigged election. Copy-paste, every night at 5:30.
Do you think Pence believes?  I can't understand how Republicans can attack Joe Biden's character with a straight face.  It is startling.
Bro, all I'm saying is that Biden's team realized why no one has assassinated Trump (because then Pence would become pres, and that could be more dangerous) and went "Joe, we have just the human shield - I mean running mate - for you!"
Joe Biden butchered her name tonight, way worse than Tucker did. ü§°ü§°
So "Judge" Jeanine Pirro, what is going to happen to Biden? You must have pulled out a crystal ball from your briefcase.
Women accused Trump. Over 20 of them, one with evidence, one who was 13.  A woman accused Biden. A woman who turned out to be an actual real life liar for hire.  Try another tack.
Are going to teach Biden how to say it correctly? He butchered her name way worse than Tucker Carlson.
‚ÄúNothing will fundamentally change‚Äù under a biden presidency either.
He absolutely is evil though. Not as evil as Trump, but Joe Biden is not your friend.
I‚Äôm no economist...and neither is Trump.  It‚Äôs like he‚Äôs trying to sell us a timeshare...every fucking day!  Biden/Harris!  Can‚Äôt wait!
4yrs + 8yrs = Biden + Harris = 12 yrs BLUE!!!
I couldn't be happier that  is Biden's VP running mate.  The fact that she is from my home state of California makes it even sweeter that she's going to be on the ballot this November.  #VoteRedToSaveAmerica2020  #BidenHarris2020ToSaveAmerica  #BlueWaveTsunami2020
When is Biden going to take questions or is that all on Harris now?
"Joe Biden and Kamala Harris introduce their presidential ticket in Delaware"
Everyone needs to report Jeanine Piro for threatening Joe Biden. This woman is psycho and dangerous!

Hey a$$hole, this is my taxpayer money, it‚Äôs not a gift from you! Can‚Äôt wait for the big Biden/Harris win in November!
Biden just mispronounced her name, lol
Is anyone tracking how many hours (minutes really) a week Joe Biden is spending in front of cameras or in public in general??

Ah, you‚Äôre right! Must‚Äôve missed that part.
Actually it's pretty crowded, Kamala, Biden, Hillary, Obama, etc.
yes Kamala has a shit ton of donors.... and y‚Äôall think Biden picked her for any other reason?üòÇ
I follow   and  here on Twitter.  I find it curious that Biden is always in my timeline at the very top and Trump is never in my timeline.

We Proudly Support Joe Biden.Joe Biden is for improvement. Improvement for ALL Americans.
Ms. McEnany: Consider contrasting Biden/Harris Qs from Cavenough 2019/1991 Thomas hearings with Trump/Pence stand for "innocent until proven guilty." Then ask (voters) "Is this the future Justice system you want?" PClose w/list of 1st T. wins-prison reform, SCOTUS, etc.
What is the number of women that accused Biden of sexual misconduct and how many BJs did she give to win the VP nomination?
Wouldn't it be amazing if she were recognized for her achievements in life rather than the things she had no choice over? The headline should read something like, "Kamala Harris, Senator and Former AG nominated to VP for Biden" Instead her race and gender get top billing.

I bought a T-shirt on the Biden victory page
I was with Rice but the announcement of Harris feels really good today and I‚Äôm excited for this Biden/Harris ticket. This is Joe Bidens choice and I support it.
Pretty sure that‚Äôs what you said about Obama and Biden. Amazing thing - there‚Äôs still a second amendment!

He has the vocabulary of a 5th grade bully. Hope the Dems just let him continue the downward slide while the high road is open for Biden and Harris. The difference between the candidates could not be more evident. #BidenHarris2020 #VoteBlue
When Biden wins and his acceptance speech, right before he's done, would it not be amazing for him to say "you're fired"? How sweet would that be!
So? She is? She attacked Biden on segregation and race, she was just a raving lunatic when she went after Kavanaugh. Not sure what your point is? Just because she‚Äôs a woman she can‚Äôt be criticized?
Yep lol Biden picked a cop and drug warrior as his VP when feelings on the police are at an all time low.

I like Bernie &amp; would have voted for him. I meant nothing derogatory against anyone. The fact is I'm well aware we NEED  Bernie's supporters. It's just so many are refusing to vote for Biden, so i thought maybe if they listen to him speak at the DNC we could change their minds.
Trump sure sounded scared! He knows Pence isn‚Äôt comparable to Harris at all! And Trump knows that Biden knows more about the US government &amp; US Constitution than he ever will! Trump failed America! #TrumpVirusKillsAmericans, churches, sports, restaurants, vacations, schools, etc!
Never heard of Joe Biden until yesterday, I‚Äôm guessing.
Biden/Harris 2020! Perfect Vision!
#Biden picks #KamalaHarrisForVP the one candidate that couldn't make it thru Iowa Primary. Knowing Joe is unlikely to finish 4 yr term  you're voting for #kamala for president. Didn't play well in #Iowa won't play well in the country.
Why is Biden saying she‚Äôs going to lead the country in January 2021 if he is elected? Who‚Äôs going to be her VP?
Is this the first time you‚Äôve heard of Biden?
please just give me one time where biden calls her michelle by accident
All you've been doing on Twitter is complaining  and whining about Biden and how you hate having to vote for him, and now you're complaining about Harris. I'm sorry, but when democracy is on the line with an opponent like Trump, I'll happily take an honest, caring man like Biden.
Biden/Harris 2020!!!! Time to take out the trash!!!!
is a transformational leader. She is a fighter. She is a uniter, and has always been of, and for, the people. I‚Äôd walk through broken glass to cast my vote for Biden/Harris this election #KHive
Biden selects California Sen. Kamala Harris as running mate   #SmartNews
Congratulations to  Joe Biden, and most of all the American people! Sen. Harris will be an extraordinary Vice President.
Political news: Joe Biden picks Kamala Harris as running mate.
I'm old enough to remember when Kamala Harris sold this shirt claiming Biden was a racist.
WASHINGTON (AP) ‚Äî Biden picks California Sen. Kamala Harris as his VP, making her the first Black woman on major party presidential ticket.
Harris to be Biden‚Äôs choice as VP!  I‚Äôm so excited!!!!!
Meanwhile, if you're a Biden supporter, SURE you'd like to see schools open on time BUT you'd ALSO like to see them open IN A SAFE MANNER   In the meantime, EVERYONE would like to see Trump PROVE he's MORE than A MONEY HUNGRY ZOMBIE with a knack for business by SHOWING he CAN beGreat! Biden can haul in what, 25+ that trump sexually assaulted, I‚Äôm sure Stormy would be happy to show up
needs to become Biden‚Äôs AG
Pinata is too polite... Biden is a shit pile and everyone NOW knows it !
Biden says he‚Äôll veto M4A EVEN if it passed Congress. Yet you think voting in progressives, which you admit will be a slow process, &amp; we have seen Dems will fight harder than they ever fought Trump, so it passes Congress will change his mind when 88% of Dems supporting it doesn‚Äôt
Yes, without Biden apologists. Liberals are not the left. Have a good night.
She endorsed Biden when Bernie was still in the race.
I‚Äôm not worried at all for either. Harris is going to chew Pence up and spit him out. I will guarantee you this though, Trump will not stalk Biden like he did Hillary, Biden‚Äôs from Scranton, he‚Äôs still a scrappy dude
The swamp, that's rich. He's put unqualified folk that donated money in positions of power. Devoss is clueless. And what about the unprecedented turnover and unfilled positions?  Imperfect, and yet this started with how Biden is "Imperfect". The mental gymnastics from you üôÑ
NO !  Trump canattackJor Biden's weaknesses which are many,  here's one.
She was acting like a prosecutor making an argument   Biden seems to understand
Biden's grades in class. Repeated 3rd grade, earned all C's and D's in 1st 3 semesters at University of Del. Made a whopping A in P.E. a B in English Writers and an F in ROTC and graduated 76th at Syracuse Law in 85. I had a way better GPA, maybe I should run. lol. Unbelievable.
starting to hope they actually do let Biden debate Trump just so we can get some more gaffe compilation videos
You destroyed 174,000 American lives &amp; the vibrant economy Obama &amp; Biden left in your hands. Yet like everything else you inherit, you've run America into the dirt, &amp; spent more than a full year &amp; $130M on taxpayer funded golfing trips that YOU profited from.
The Dem Party pours $ into fighting/preventing progressives as much as they can. I support all progressive candidates available, but the party fights tooth &amp; nail. We‚Äôre slowly building progressives in Congress despite the party‚Äôs best efforts. Biden won‚Äôt be forced after he wins
Biden can't interfere, right? That's one of my biggest concerns w/ him - kumbaya  days are long over. It will begin w/ DOJ , I hope. No pardons. No deals.
we knew you were cooking up this nonsense. whatever.   BIDEN 2020!
Ummm...Biden ain't winning.   Dems committed political malpractice with this ticket.  He shouldn't win. The put up a guy with severe cognitive issues. It's ridiculous.
81 days until we re-elect the most America loving, NON politician to be  f/four more years. Jobs. Security. Peace in the Middle East. Bringing troops home. Defeated ISIS. Killed Terrorists. Takes on China. IRAN. NOKO.... Obama/Biden committed Treason. That's a nightmare.
I mean, you‚Äôre making my point. Dems ARE in a position to effect change, they CHOOSE not to, why keep supporting them? Also, Biden said it himself. Now, he does have a long history of outright lying (like Trump), so I understand why taking his own word is risky, but still.
Look up his record of success focused on ALL Americans Ms. Swift. Lowest unemployment f/All Americans. Funded historic black colleges, criminal justice reform and so much more.  Biden. Harris.  Phonies. Corrupt Marxists.  Your statements are worthless. Uneducated. Factless.
So you played golf and bashed Biden while your brother was dying. You are an amazing piece of sh*t. Man am I glad I am no relation to you! Bless Robert. So sorry for his passing. üôè
What a tragic and ignorant rant.  Look up President Trump's policies.  All have been good for America after decades of corrupt politicians and 8 years of the traitors Obama/Biden admin who spied on his campaign &amp; attempted a coup d'erat.
You know the VP basically doesn‚Äôt do anything right?  How desperate is Biden that he is constantly taking about the bottom of the ticket? ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not just me! I picked a girl!‚Äù
Who is going to watch the DNC on Monday? Prediction of this comedy show. Someone who sounds like Biden talks showing him in the basement, Harris will talk too much, AOC gets her 60 seconds of shame and a lot of music. Yawn. lol.
üôÑ  Irrelevant Greta consistently making shit up.  1)Sit tight, the Convention is next week where Biden will accept the nomination.  2)We typically respect the notion ‚Äúone president at a time.‚Äù Although we *are* in desperate times.  3)You‚Äôre irrelevant.  #BidenHarris2020
Biden is an equal roadblock, he literally said he‚Äôd veto M4A even if Congress passed it. Dems voted FOR Trump‚Äôs budgets, surveillance powers, judges, Space Force, impeached ONLY on conspiracy against Biden. I‚Äôll give them down ballot votes, chance to prove themselves in Congress
What's this analysis based on? Why would a Biden presidency return more on ave than historical averages? Also a major factor is which party  takes the Senate..What party does the writer affiliate with??
I pray no one votes till after first debate get Biden to do at least one debate now
That has nothing to do with biden though
Joe Biden isn‚Äôt ideal but if he doesn‚Äôt take the opportunity to host briefings and press conferences in a casual morning environment drinking coffee and calling it ‚ÄúA Cup of Joe with Joe‚Äù I will RIOT
Millions out of work and facing eviction/foreclosure, 170,000 dead from COVID-19, a POTUS openly trying to suppress the vote, out of control debt...  GOP answer: Biden‚Äôs a socialist!
Same goes for Biden.
I am proud that we have such a great breadth of Democratic leaders.  The candidates who ran against Biden, all of the women who were considered for VP, our honestly impressive Congress people.  They have Trump.  The rest of the GOP went to sleep.
Can Joe Biden "Thread the Needle" Among Democrats?
A Snowden pardon would be wonderful. What can Biden offer in response for the progressives in his party?
Sanders EARNED delegates for the convention. Biden also won more delegates. The convention is where the nominee becomes official. Don‚Äôt worry. You‚Äôll get your crappy centrist candidate &amp; a platform that doesn‚Äôt include M4A, despite these votes. They still earned a voice there.
China endorsed Biden/Harris, this should be your wake up call.
Oh yes, we all love hearing you lie about Covid, voter fraud, starving the post office, and ridiculous shit you make up about Joe Biden. Can‚Äôt wait!!!
GOP: Hillary was a crook. After Trump was elected.... no investigations.  GOP: Biden is a crook. Prior to Bidens run for President... no investigations.  Its almost like they're just screwing around
Dear traitor John  No one cares about Hunter Biden or you. Forget about it Its all propaganda
We were told Biden was ‚Äúmost electable‚Äù, that he‚Äôs smashing the polls, that we, from Joe‚Äôs own mouth, should ‚Äúvote for someone else then‚Äù when asking the slightest challenging question. NOW y‚Äôall need us? Votes are earned. Biden is a serial liar too &amp; a warmonger. Your bar is low
Joe Biden. Chinese operative. Selling out America for 40+ years.
Biden is the coup, and Harris is the de gras. Jumping Joe Biden will open the door and do his four, preparing Harris to do eight more.
#JudgeJeanine this is the Harris-Biden campaign, not the Biden-Harris campaign
LMFAO!
Speaking of Q,  Now you guys are retreating conspiracy theories too? That's what trump did, you've got no leg to stand on to criticize Joe Biden as long as you support that disgusting pig.
Biden:  Put me in office and then let's talk about what we can do together  C'mon jack I know to get the money first.
I am voting early against Trump and for Biden/Harris. As soon as I receive my mail in ballot, I‚Äôm completing it and hand delivering it to the election commission office.  America deserves better than this BS Trump administration.
Anyone in the GOP does not get to talk about this.  Your grift and greed, accompanied by lies and cheats make me sick.  Shall we do an honest comparison of Biden‚Äôs plans vs Trumps?  Stop whining about being victims, and do your fucking job.

Trump and Clinton are known adulterers with ties to a child rapist; Biden is/has neither.
lmao Biden? Who was accused by one woman that turned out to be a serial liar?
By not voting for Trump (a vote for Biden), not voting for Biden (a vote for Trump), and then voting 3rd party, you actually get 3 votes. I feel very smart knowing this.
Every politician gets at least 127,853 accusations every week minimum. It should be looked into but innocent till proven guilty. Even Biden.
Good Lord STOP embarrassing yourself.  This is VERY uncomfortable for the people who know how you achieved your position in government. You are not qualified to be there. Just like Biden. We all know this. That is all.
Nothing I hate more than identity politics----it's the #DemocraticParty's biggest weakness.....Just another reason I left the party after 2016---I follow policy.....speaking of, if Joe Biden promised to pardon Julian Assange and Edward Snowden of any crimes, I would vote for him.

Don‚Äôt tell me I‚Äôm not pro life simply because I cannot, in good conscience, vote for a man as atrocious as Trump. He‚Äôs using evangelicals like myself, like you. He‚Äôs no more pro life than Biden; the difference is, he needs conservative Christians to win.
Joe Biden does not know who Donald Trump is.

International students will avoid the US for at least the next 3 years even if Biden is elected. The numbers will dwindle significantly if Trump is re-elected. Those numbers won't rebound. So much MONEY lost. How do I know? I worked with international students. They spend $$$
In doing a little more checking, I can find at least 3 Popes that Biden was blessed to meet.  For a man you don't seem to think is Catholic, that's a pretty good track record.
If all goes well and Biden gets elected, do you have a plan for how conservatives can return to a functioning party willing to compromise and govern for the good of the people? I value your opinion but I see many never trumpers holding on to their intransigence.

Sounds like he's endorsing Biden.
I do not support rapist, racist war mongers, which is why I am just as likely to vote trump as I am biden. How about you try building an argument FOR your candidate, instead of against the other one.
Actually, he is more favored to win then against Hillary. His favorability is higher than Obama at this stage in his presidency.  Liberals are lurching too far left. People will begrudgingly vote Trump in order to not have Biden.

we don't care if she had botched her presidential run.  Biden won.  ALL the other candidates lost. we are thrilled at the ticket.  they compliment each other.  and they will be the next president and vice president of the US.
I confess I'm torn. A big part of me wants the Republicans to keep the Senate to check a Biden presidency. But a big part of me wants to see a total reset of the Republican Party. Every possible outcome is largely bad. And anyway the outcome doesn't depend on what I think.
It's not as simple as "just elect Democrats". That's a good place to start. But we can't make the mistake of folding up shop &amp; going home after the election is over: that's where the hardest work begins.

I will grant you that a majority of people who identify as liberals ..sadly myself included, only complain when It is a Republican (is Trump really a real Republican??!) It's a serious concern for me as We get closer to the election, that if Biden wins we won't complain as much.

This is the best argument I've heard. Basically we are voting for who we want to fight. Do you want to fight against Trump or fight against Biden. The claim is it's easier to fight with Biden than it is with Trump. And if Biden wins his supporters will realize nothing has changed

The nasty memes of Harris began the moment Biden picked her to be his running mate.  This ad targets people in their mid-thirties. It hits Trump hard because it is exactly who he is.
How about Vice President Biden?
Biden also openly called for the arrest of anarchists. I agree with your assessment, the democrats are 2016 Republicans. They just are not loud and crude.
They only impeached him for going after biden. They had no mention of the crimes he has committed. If they really wanted to impeach AND remove him, they would've made a case with teeth.

80 days before Harris/ Biden vs Trump/Pence election. will it America be great again or will we be held hostage the next 4 years. Where is Hunter and Biden is the most racist person on earth. Just saying.
Barack Hussein Obama would like you to vote before the debates reveal Biden‚Äôs true level of mental deficiency.
Correction: BLM single handedly donates $48MM to Biden's campaign
While I agree that "Blue No Matter Who" in the presidential race is important, being hostile towards people with legitimate concerns about Biden/Harris isn't going to get them on your side.
I won‚Äôt survive it. üò•üò•üò•. Biden and Harris will win. We will vote even if we have to walk over hot coals or broken glass in our bare feet. We will vote and we will get rid of these criminals!
...and their union with 300,000 members just endorsed #Biden
Oh, I don't just mean interjecting on on political opinions, I mean potentially holding an office in the Biden Administration. Clinton and Biden go back a long way politically.
Major US postal workers union endorses Biden for president #SmartNews
Cool. But how many Trumpers or undecided voters are gonna go "hmm ü§î you know I never really paid attention to facts before, but now that this Black/Asian-American woman is saying those facts &amp; telling me Mike Pence is wrong, I'm gonna vote for Biden!"
I love the  ads.  has set the bar so low that all Biden has to do is wear a mask and promise to listen to the experts. #ByeDon2020
My names joe biden and...c'mon man. I thought you liked me. #MyCampaignSlogan
Vote like Biden is 10pts down. Don‚Äôt be complacent.
If Biden wins every state carried by Hilary and re takes PA, MI and WI then game is over
Possible that if you asked Biden about this he wouldn't remember saying it, but it's still really dark and disturbing
Want me to spell it out? I'm MtF, autistic and with an encroaching physical disability in my spine. If you accelerationists keep Biden out, I die either in the streets or in a prison camp.
You might want to get used to hearing the Clinton name. With Biden potentially winning the Presidency, there is also the potential that Hillary Clinton will re-enter the political arena in some form or another.  Not to bait a rabbit mob responding. but there is the possibility.
Yeah some lawyer nobody has ever even heard of getting a soft slap on the wrist. Hopefully I'm wrong about that outcome. If that is the outcome, Republican Party is dead as dead gets. Deader than Biden. Burnt toast üî•üî•üî•
I‚Äôm not excited about a Biden Harris ticket. And I think people and survivors specifically have their very legitimate reasons for not voting for them. But if Angela Davis can settle for this ticket then so can I. Get in the car girls, we‚Äôre settling ü•¥
Hunter Biden
Republicans are so scared of a barely moderately-to-the-left Joe Biden that they are willing to dismantle the constitutionally-mandated  to win, and on top of that if we lived in a country that made sense, their party would be disbanded as a punishment.
Thank you Mitch! Now PLEASE, vote for Biden- not your wife! PLEASE!!!!!!
Over thirty million people protested this summer and yet the president could not fill an arena in Oklahoma. Not to dismiss the issue or anything, but I would tend to think Biden turnout will probably still be decisive.
Hey Jimmy, when are you clowns going to Q&amp;A Biden/Harris?
When someone offers to save you from a burning building you take their hand. Joe Biden is the hand.
"Didn‚Äôt Barr announce neither Obama or Biden are under investigation?"  you mean like when Comey said publicly and lied under oath that Trump wasn't under investigation??? and the entire time they were illegally spying on him ü§î
fake obstruction charges doesn't change what Obama did or the truth that's slowly getting declassified bit by bit  Barr won't announce charges against Obama and Biden until after some of the other big fish get fried anyway  today is just the tip of the iceberg  enjoy the showü§£
If Biden wins the entire investigation will be buried forever  #Hannity
Dude over here tweaking about this. Typical. Vote Biden 2020
If Biden is sinking...then what do you call Trump as thousands of Americans die and more go unemployed?
Where the fuck is  Thought he was going to help Biden get elected?
So much for unity on your part. This is divisive and narcissistic performative nonsense at a time when Democrats should be united behind the nominee, Joe Biden. You should be ashamed of yourself acting like a mere pedestrian on social media.
I‚Äôm attending Joe Biden for President‚Äôs event, ‚ÄúProgressives for Biden Convention Watch Party‚Äù ‚Äì sign up now to join me! #TeamJoe
Staying home is better than voting for Trump. Personally, I'm voting Biden to get back to some sense of normalcy and following the rule of law.
The latest   / Marist poll found Joe Biden 11 points ahead of Donald Trump:
ü§Æü§Æü§ÆIf anyone is going to destroy our democracy its Biden and Harris!
Stop shaming people who will vote for Biden/harris. I don't want to but I know they will bend to the will of the people because their history shows it. If you don't vote then you truly are giving up and allowing people to due needlessly.  these retweets are dense.
Maybe I‚Äôm missing something but Pence pardoning him for what if he‚Äôs not been charged for anything before Biden enters office?
this is a Harris-Biden team, Not a Biden-Harris team #Hannity
Yeah ask Nancy she‚Äôs a Catholic and so is Biden!
But if you don't vote then you don't get the chance to have the protests and the movement matter. Trump will never budge or change anything. But Biden/harris will have to bend to the will of the people. If history shows anything its that they do bend when it comes down to it.
Biden should not agree to debate unless a fact chk is done about every statement
If Biden was still with it I imagine he‚Äôd be pretty pissed off at whoever is writing lie after lie on his Twitter.
If Harris gets elected then I wonder if they move Biden's basement to the White House fixing to be called the Black House or move the now called Black House to Biden's basement? Just asking. lol
The USCCB said that a staffer who told the bishops‚Äô news service she was elated that Kamala Harris is Biden‚Äôs running mate spoke in a personal capacity.  The conference did not address the substance of her remarks.
Joe Biden doesn‚Äôt deserve to be President! He‚Äôs a moose knuckled tater tosser!
Ya think they had a choice? 4 more years of a lunatic or Biden!
Biden is the biggest racist on earth. Harris is the biggest fake on earth. She now thinks she is black if that gets her in power.
well, he probably didn‚Äôt pick her. The DNC picked her and then told Biden that he picked her. He knows that he can‚Äôt remember anything, so he believed them and ran with it.
So in other words they are going to censure conservative videos if they say anything about 'Baffoon' Biden or 'Lot Lizard' Harris.
Again, hope I'm wrong, but mark my words-- Biden wont be any better. In fact he'll be just as bad. And if something happens to him and Kamala becomes president? I'd expect the same fash actions as trump's regime.  I really want to be wrong : /
And Biden is somehow even less progressive than Obama. And Kamala is a fucking cop. She would rather incarcerate innocent people to let them fight fires for free than let them live their lives freely. They arent agents of change. If I am wrong Ill GLADLY eat my words.
Either vote for Biden/Harris or STFU and leave!
Like Im gonna vote for biden/harris but it doesnt matter in the end, theyre still gonna bomb foreign nations most of our country will never see or be aware of, kill our own people, and subvert progress for profit. Climate change will kill us before we get anywhere
We couldn‚Äôt even hold Obama accountable, and mf‚Äôs out here pretending like we‚Äôre going to somehow hold Joe Biden to a higher standard lmao
How could this possible be a conflict of interest?  Wink! Wink! look over here there is nothing wrong with #MailInVoting #MailInBallotFraud
#Tucker it is not "the Biden-Harris team", it is "the Harris-Biden team"
Biden who?
people like "stop badmouthing kamala and biden, we need democrats even if its just baby step changes for the better!!" lmao bitches the world wont survive any more incremental change, this is beyond the time for dramatic and massive change or we will die as a species but ok mb
Have u all noticed a lot of ads for Biden and not one for Trump on this platform? Trump got Twittergated and we know it. Indictments are coming. I believe the report is complete and getting plenty of popcorn and lots of beers. lol
Y‚Äôall bout to go vote for Biden . Him and Kamala more racist than trump ü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
They would be asked policy questions and have to explain their current socialist agenda. Biden is currently leading in the polls, why upset the Apple cart.
The legislature would change that and they have a veto proof majority. This was discussed at length when Warren was being considered for VP. It will be a non issue if Biden wants her in his cabinet, as it would have had she been chosen.
Yes please. Let‚Äôs vote him out. Biden has members of Sunrise on his team at the very least.
So now it‚Äôs Bernie Sanders and Kamala Harris, everyone knows Biden is just a vessel for the far left.
Hannity will be whining this guys name like Uranium One. All through the Biden administration. Unlike with trumps friends, he will likely face punishment, and serve his time if convicted.
Biden wasn‚Äôt the best pick given the field of candidates. But, he‚Äôs the only alternative to Trump.
I don‚Äôt support any of these people in any way whatsoever, but, umm, I‚Äôm pretty sure Lenin, Mao, etc would be laying the groundwork for a revolution, not endorsing Biden üòÇüòÇ
You are no more aware than Biden.
Like we‚Äôre prospering now? Get the fuck outta here!!  #Biden-Harris2020
I would crawl through a prison sewer like Andy Dufresne at Shawshank to vote for Biden/Harris
Not a Biden sign.
Well I‚Äôm not going to defend Biden. Why the democrats chose an old white guy is beyond me, but even with his weaknesses he‚Äôs still several times better than this incompetent President.
Yeah but I think we are getting better. I am a little weary of them cause if do win will want conservative policies but nice helping Biden win.
Kamala Harris probably won't be a loud voice advocating for legalization, but she can reassure Joe Biden about the California experience. It's gonna be okay, Joe. Legalization works.  by  #CannabisCulture #CannabisSociety #ColoradoCannabis
What does she care? She‚Äôs not running for office or is she? Maybe she has been offered a seat on the Biden Harris Cabinet of Undetected or Unpunishable Crime.
Uh that parody is joe Biden saying back during busing he didn‚Äôt want his kids going to a jungle school. Look it up dummy.
Do you still trust USPS with your ballot?  #copolitics #coleg #usps #Election2020
Progressives on MSM saying they're dedicated to their principles and goals and that supporting Biden/Harris isn't really giving in. Huh #NeverBidenHarris
Few steps forward followed by miles in reverse... ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Yet you‚Äôre voting for Biden simply because he‚Äôs a democrat... please
Doing nothing and a watching it happen is just as bad as doing it. Trump is bad, but Biden is right there neck for neck
Huh? What‚Äôs that even mean? You contantly teeet about Biden, so....?
Biden would have no response. No response is the same as a bad response. Biden was missing for like 6 weeks of his campaign and you somehow think that makes a promising presidency ü§î seriously questioning your logic
If I were Biden I would hire this dude and spray paint ‚ÄúNew World Order‚Äù on the front...
Oo we got vocab now! Literally everything on that little list you made Biden has said he will make no change to. I don‚Äôt get where you think he will do anything better. He has said numerous times he will change nothing
I always hope so, but does it actually?   And though I hate voting for the lesser of two evils, I‚Äôm afraid to not vote for Biden becuas trump has got to go!
Say one is better (between trump and Biden) than the other makes me question your ethics. They are the same. To sit there and ask me ‚Äúwhat would you rather have - the same shit for 4 years in red or the same shit for 8 but in blue??‚Äù Of course I‚Äôll pick the 4 years
Both the Republican and Democrat nomination this year are fucking trash people are only voting for Biden because they don‚Äôt like trump and vise versa. No one looks at actual facts anymoreü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Corporate news works for the same donors as the ones donating to Trump.  Corporate news might be happier w/ Trump, juicier stories. Biden will be boring at best.
I don‚Äôt think anybody is worried California won‚Äôt go for Biden. More worried about Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan, North Carolina, South Carolina ...
Biden / Harris is the Fakest ticket I have ever seen. Totally propped up by media
No. But I have at least 2 close friends, not trumplicans, who are refusing to vote for Biden. It's...insane. And I've told both of them that. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
Isn't that Biden's argument?
To EVERYONE - if you want to keep your Post Office better vote Biden
I think you and I disagree on Trump and Biden and the legitimacy of Catholic's voting for one or the other. I do appreciate you fighting against racism. Come to Denver and let's grab a beer.
Trump supporters tell me a third party vote helps Biden. So, which is it?
Yeah and some of his takes are pretty decent (only watched like 5 or 6 vids kuz they long). Today is him saying lenin would vote for biden was a special kind of silly üòú
Fair enough. But it isn't Trump supporters who made it mandatory Biden choose a "black woman." The birther thing is nonsense. Incidentally, we are all fed. Aren't we? We can choose the restaurant. You choose CNN, NYT, WAPO, MSNBC etc. I choose FOX, WATI, conservative talk radio.
Biden seems to have done fine. A distinguished congressional career spanning decades. Well respected VP, both in the United States and abroad. Presidential candidate. Soon to be president. And he‚Äôs a good and decent man. Yep - Joe‚Äôs done alright... #BidenHarris2020
Beau Biden did not have to go to Iraq. He was DE Atty Gen'l. Bob Mueller is a decorated Vietnam vet. If you vote for a coward, you might as well be one yourself.
Clearly messing with mail-in-ballots is the real issue, but I Trump is also sabotaging the mail to prevent by Biden Harris T-shirt from getting here promptly.
I hate Harris so much, I'll never vote for Biden.  This week I realized Trump can win again.  I see the stupid Obama-Clinton   running the same failed campaign as in 2016.   #NeverKamala
I know republicans don‚Äôt believe in polls, for good reason, but there are strong indications that it‚Äôs gonna be a landslide win for democrats. I‚Äôd rather be Biden in the lead by 11 than Trump down by that much. You can only pull off so many miracles when you don‚Äôt believe n Jesus
The tRump scum, bag man, that is heading up the USPS should be charged with election fraud by the Biden Administration
Everyone except me? I ALONE!!  I watched interview clip and an interview w/ Barnet. I think the ‚Äúare you a junkie?‚Äù question was a continuation of his hypothetical. But, I like Biden. You have your preference. I have mine. The original post was on trump‚Äôs lies not Biden‚Äôs brain.
The Simpsons say VOTE FOR BIDEN
Joe Biden lying again... what a shock.
It was a solid press conference, now let‚Äôs have the Biden team answer some unscripted questions
The Dems were asking people to vote woke three times in a row, and since the economy wasn't tanking anymore, in 2016 the voters could react. This time a Biden/Harris vote is only about 1/3 woke. People can handle that.
Biden's campaign was in the toilet without any electors &amp; then Obama &amp; the DNC stepped in. I didn't like him in '88 &amp; I still don't.
Great news about silent majority: My daughter has a friend who has 4000 FB followers. She‚Äôs a young person in profession where she meets wide variety of people. Her followers are diverse. She put out the question, Biden or Trump, no discussion. Vast majority said President Trump.
Do you remember the Obama campaigns?   You could see vast support in places beyond Twitter.   I see it now, but not for Biden.   Biden and McCain signs are 1 in the same.
Ever seen a Biden yard sign?   Yea me neither.
Look at the little CNN, MSNBC puppets...no questions for Biden or the other one.
Nixon was more liberal than Obama, and president my boss was more liberal than biden...
Defeating trump and letting Biden become President for 8 years is an equal if not greater threat because it‚Äôs more long term. I don‚Äôt get what you‚Äôre not getting
It's temporary and who's wishlist is UBI on?   During primary the Democrats HATED the idea of UBI.  The liberal media literally ignored him, called him wrong name, showed pictures of random Asian guy claiming he was Yang.  If UBI was on wishlist Yang would be nom, not Biden.

Great news about silent majority: My daughter has a friend who has 4000 FB followers. She‚Äôs a young person in profession where she meets wide variety of people. Her followers are diverse. She put out the question, Biden or Trump, no discussion. Vast majority said President Trump.
Look at this headline. Biden isn't supposed to be president for very long. Soros is trying to put communist Kamala in the Oval Office. NO thank you!

In CA, OR and CO, no matter how the people vote, those states will go to Biden.
President Trump  CREATED the biggest economic expansion in history. Lowest unemployment f/all in history.  Brought manufacturing back to the USA. Trade Deals! America First!  Obama/Biden=FAILURE. Economic disaster. Foreign policy disaster.  Harris &amp; Biden: Serial LIARS.
Huh? SS has spent over 400k annually on his golf trips. Him paying himself with GVMT $ negates the "not receiving pay"  I'm not voting Biden, I can't stand the current left politicians, but I'm also not a moron that falls for Trump's BS.   Keep being a blind follower, you do you.
Joe Biden is not fit to be president..he hides in the basement and all you idiot's speak for him. You are just using his name with the help of his wife..you should be ashamed of yourself. Talking about Bo...the one thing he has left to remember and you used it.
Biden and Harris our coming for our guns while calling for refunding the police. I'm out, Trump it is.
I'm being an adult and not voting for Biden.
How am I toxic for responding to your claim?   Also, I‚Äôm not a Bernie Bro, but a registered independent.   Like most independents, I don‚Äôt like the choices, but between Biden and Trump, the choice is obvious.
Would a dog wear pants like this? (Trump) Or like this? (Biden)
Pay attention Colorado, Wyoming, NM, MT, PA, OH, WV... Biden/Harris will KILL oil and gas.
Can you imagine Biden doing an interview with anyone where he wasn‚Äôt tightly controlled,  much less someone who will ask tough questions?   His brain would melt down.  Don‚Äôt know how much longer they can keep up the charade.
Biden gave us Clarence Thomas üôÉ
Yup and Harris will take over if elected and Palosi will be VP.Biden will probably announce his retirement on Jan. lol.
What it really sounds like is you are voting for Biden, and I don't like neoliberals!
Twitter/Social Media is always toxic, however the ‚ÄúBiden and/or Kamala isn‚Äôt who I wanted but we HAVE TO vote for them‚Äù and the ‚Äúyou can‚Äôt criticize them!! they‚Äôre our only hope!‚Äù is gross
Maxine Waters says Biden 'can't go home' without Black woman as VP - Business Insider
Babbling Biden and Kumalot will remove 100,000 a day.
Biden and Harris are all about confiscating guns and lobbing the softball term "mandatory buyback". So they don't want the police to protect us and they don't want us to protect ourselves. I'm Out, #Trump2020
Senator, it's great you're working to help unemployed Coloradans but if you don't stand up to Trump's facist tyranny that's tearing down the USPS to suppress voting rights, then you're a traitor betraying all Americans. W/ Biden's lead growing in CO, it doesn't bode well for you.
Biden was VP for eight years and has spent his life in Congress. He knows the countries. He had a press release yesterday naming them and the limitations of the deal Trump "negotiated."
Seriously Biden has to dial this back or Trump will crush him and idiot libs won‚Äôt understand why.
lol when did Biden say he would be one term lololol I swear
Perhaps why they‚Äôre having so much trouble framing Biden...not your typical ‚Äúliberal elite‚Äù, so the canned attacks fall flat.
Biden and Harris actually know what their doing
#thanksobama and yes Joe Biden will be the fist President to rebuild a better economy for a second after being being VP when it was done the 1st time! All trump has done is ride on Obama's coattails and try to take credit for the things Obama has already done.. trump is a loser
Biden just said him and Obama were responsible for the peace deal between Israel and the UAE that was signed yesterday. These two idiots really need to get their stories straight.
It's not about beating Trump, it's about UHC, jobs, housing, and peace. Biden-Harris have nothing to do any of these. The party needs to be rebuilt from the ground up.

Of course, the odds right before the election more closely reflect polling average, where the odds now factor in three months of uncertainty. Bush in 2000 squandered a bigger August lead than Biden's.
But to point out the obvious. If he does not concede, his followers will stand behind him. Many of them have guns. Most, probably. They also make up the majority of LEOs, military, secret service, etc. It could take more than just "swearing in Biden" for transfer of the office.
‚ÄúBut Kamala is a cop and Biden votes for the Crime Bill.‚Äù
I do understand that.. maybe you‚Äôre not comprehending that I‚Äôm not a trump supporter nor am I supporter of Biden because I support the people that make this country run, not just rich people. I don‚Äôt know why you care so little

Biden trying to take credit. Why?
Biden does not like Harris and Harris does not like Biden. It was obvious 3 days ago. He can't even operate his phone cause it was upside down. It is a disgrace and a sham show.
Trump gets tough questions from the media, Biden has not been asked one tough question yet. Biden tries to take credit for the mid east peace talks and how does that happen when he has been in the basement forever. Unbelievable. And the Dems think he can win that way.
As the article notes: "If the court agrees, that could increase the likelihood that the results of the presidential race between President Donald Trump and presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden won‚Äôt be known for days after the election."

It is about my rights! Joe Biden is a civilian, just like me. He's not a policy maker, just like me. Fear mongering &amp; stepping on my toes to move his agenda is 100% about my rights. I comply with wearing a mask inside if I am going to be within 6 feet of others but not outside!
get in the same boat with the rest of us, and let's row back to shore, because we are way out in the deep end with no captain. vote for Biden/Harris because at least they aren't criminals should be their 2020 campaign tag line.
You know they won‚Äôt. Only cover for cowering Biden the fool. The media is dead and it‚Äôs just all Yellow Journalism.
And you think Biden will open pandoras box in allowing previous presidents to be imprisoned???? Every living president deserves to be in jail, including president "my boss"...
and Biden didn't just vote for the Iraq war himself, he's even more culpable as he also whipped other Dem Senators into voting for it.
I actively voted for Sanders and contributed to his campaign. I‚Äôm passively voting for Biden.
I voted for Sanders in the primary. I‚Äôm not out here vote shaming anybody. I stated why I am choosing to vote for Biden because of the people in my family and community who are immigrants, low wage workers, and rely on social welfare. I don‚Äôt have your ideological purity
I agree. I also don‚Äôt like Biden or Harris. But I‚Äôve never liked any presidential candidate I have voted for.
We so very much need to come together &amp; FIGHT tRump &amp; help people vote SO I HOPE WE ALL FOLLOW EACH OTHER OUT OF  SOLIDARITY TO HELP ELECT JOE BIDEN &amp; KAMALA HARRIS!
The spin machine will not accept that the left bashed President Trump for his brave decision to shut down travel &amp; months later agree it was a good decision. That would have been 2 more months of exposure if Hillary was at the helm and Joe Biden would not even be a consideration!

I will never forget that Obama/Biden left Otto Warmbier.

Where were you when our rights were stripped away by the Patriot Act? (Which Biden helped write)?   Where were you when the Obama admin orchestrated brutal police violence against Occupy?  Where were you when people were brutalized at Standing Rock for a pipeline that is leaking?
Truth. I haven't been excited about Biden since he announced his run.

The GOP and the ring wing media mostly ignored this despicable post by their affiliate  in regards to the deceased Iraq war veteran Beau Biden. Donald Trump is not a victim.

There's been one notable difference in this election between Trump &amp; Biden.  talks to the press more than any President has in my lifetime, and #Biden won't even answer a handful of questions with the media. I prefer the little pressers over zoom calls.
It's arguments like this that got us here in the first place both parties are awful but nothing will change if we don't vote for candidates with good policy. If Biden wins whatever but if Trump wins I'm fully prepared to fight for the removal of the least popular president ever.
Agree 100%, man. Kamala Harris and Joe Biden have probably put more black Americans in jail through crime bills than anybody else in America's history... The irony is incredible. The media is lying and covering for them anyway they can.

Do you even know what a Radical Liberal is? Biden and Harris are Centrists on a liberal day.
Awesome üëè as always  Meme idea for you: biden in his bunker, surrounded by his computer (zoom) with the caption ‚Äò I have no idea what I‚Äôm doing  LOL üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
here‚Äôs how voting works 1+1=2  1+0=1 not voting for biden is NOT a 45 vote not matter how you want to shame someone into thinking it is and yes what you just said is a shameful way to pressure people into a biden vote because basically you know he doesn‚Äôt have the support to win.
Any Rep voting for Biden are of course welcome also.
Any Rep voting for Biden are welcome also of course.
Any Dems voting for Biden in Colorado Springs, Colorado, that need a ride, I will be available. Thinking about renting a van.
I'm not safe in Trump's America. I'll take my chances with Biden.
Hey, any Republicans that want to further their career, this is a good time to jump ship, vote for Biden, and become the next REAL Republican trying to defeat Biden in 2024.
Biden takes the pyramid approach, thinking like most lifelong DC politicians do, that the Federal Government should mandate everything, run control and spend money from the top down. Biden's mandating masks for everyone is top down. In truth this doesn't make it better.
ABSOLUTELY! BIDEN IS THE PERFECT DEFINITION OF "ALL HAT AND NO CATTLE!" ACCOMPLISHMENTS???? NONE!!!
These things become the news, spun as if Biden said them first or even had an original idea about how to deal with the multidimensional aspects of #COVID19. Who gets the most press wins the game, with the table being set again the next day. Don't be fooled. Any President with...
Nearly everything Biden has said about the pandemic tracked what  had already said. This has been going on for months with help from puppets in #Media who won't cover Trump so no one knows much about what came first. Looks like a plot, hmm.
If  can't be honest as an Indian- American who is "identifying" as an African American how can she be trusted about anything else?  #Biden
And Obama and Biden are right in the middle of this!!! This was no doubt a failed Coup d‚Äô√©tat attempt on a duly elected President
Only one direction. I am willing to wager a week's salary Biden will not win by the current polling margin over Trump. No one will take me up on this wager because they know the current polls are nonsense.
OBSERVATION: THIS IDIOT IS GRABBING BOOKS BY THE HAND-FULL. HE HAS NO IDEA WHAT HE'S BUYING??? WE TRUMP SUPPORTERS KNOW EXACTLY WHAT WE'RE BUYING AND IT AIN'T BIDEN!!
Do we see what trump and his little GOP klan members are working on. All talk is about Biden and Harris. We have a group of white rich old ass men trying to take this world to a dictatorship. It‚Äôs not going away, he will cheat and steal and win. The shiny box is Trump.
Ok lol you think Dems would be mad about that? Joe Biden can quit the day after Inauguration Day. What‚Äôs your point exactly?
If Trump can have his acceptance speech on WH grounds, couldn‚Äôt Biden?! It‚Äôs our house!
Biden sent a letter laying out a strategy in January.  It was the same as the rest of the industrialized countries on the globe. You know, the one's we aren't allowed into because we are the world's plague rats
Remember when pro union was pro America?  Joe Biden and the Democratic Party do.   Strong unions support strong families!
Not only that, when Trump defeats Biden/Harris they can cry that America is systematically racist and promote further violence and division.
see it was bought and paid for bs to keep you from paying attention to the real winner bernie the one who should be president again obama did it hillary did it now biden and harris did it. open your eyes. #NeverBidenNeverKamala
The first of Obama's FBI spying agents is going to plead guilty.  He'll be singing like a canary. Many more indictments to come Obama/Biden spied on the Trump campaign and launched the biggest hoax perpetrated on America. #RussiaHoaxExposed
&gt;BLM &gt;Support Biden/Harris   Pick one
I would kind of like to see the debates and what happens over the next few months. So far Biden has done next to no campaigning. What does he stand for?
AWESOME! LOVE IT! WE GOTTA RE-ELECT THIS GREAT PRESIDENT! JOE BIDEN COULDN'T MANAGE A LEMONADE STAND AND KAMALA IS LIKE A CHAMELEON ;IN THAT SHE CHANGES HER POLITICAL COLORS TO ENHANCE HER POLITICAL POSITION!
Hmmm...riddle me this Lee...why is there no reporting on the murder of Cannon Hinnant?  Is it because it doesn't fit your narrative?  I'll let you continue on with your tantrum about how "orange man bad!" while overlooking the same issues Biden is guilty of. #LiberalHypocrisy
Wait you voted for the worst dem candidate maybe ever but think Trump is the lesser of two evils then Biden. I speak on behalf of all Dems, never vote Dem again lol.
Is there any chance you could talk to Joe Biden about implementing a nationwide ban on the dangerous, damaging practice of conversion therapy?
No worries, they would call you out either way. Smh
I look at what Biden and Harris prep to do to the Supreme Court, and yes, this is a fight for the soul of the country.  The fight's been going on and we're only part way through.
I cannot fathom the mess that a Biden and Trump debate would be. Neither can be concise and both ramble. Ugh.
I don‚Äôt think anyone‚Äôs telling you not to push for meaningful change. They‚Äôre just telling you to vote for Joe Biden with your right hand and push for meaningful change with your left.
We need to stop flights to the US. Are leader which is not our dictator is a serial killer. I bet Biden can do something about that in November.
Asking for a mess of a situation. This will be a nightmare for Biden and Trump alike. Probably not getting final results till far later than what they are thinking with the results also being questioned by both parties. If you dont want to believe me, that's fine. Just wait &amp; see
The irony is the same stupidity that she refers to about Trump supporters is the same stupidity prevalent in Biden supporters.
Vote for VP Biden. Think of it as an act of atonement.
He knows people make fun of him...he simply doesn't care what people think of him.  Can't help but to notice the HUGE amounts of #LiberalHypocrisy bubbling up with the Biden/Harris ticket.
when I began 2020 I wanted Kamala Harris as Persident, then I had to switch to Elizabeth Warren, then I had to switch to Joe Biden bc I know that is the path forward. Our war is with the GOP and their blatant disregard for life. they want to retain power. they knew where he was
Joe Biden can‚Äôt think for himself everybody knows that. I say again if Joe Biden or Democrats were in the office right now we would have 1 million lives lost to the virus.
I keep seeing these unsubstantiated claims against Biden. On the other hand, does it not at least worry you a little bit that Trump has several pictures taken with Epstein and Maxwell over several years and that he wished Maxwell "well." ?
Biden‚Äôs desired mask rule. He does get mask use outdoors, yet wants to set this as part of a national mandate.
Headlines in every newspaper in  America on 4 November:  Biden Wins,  Masks no longer necessary, Teachers say it‚Äôs safe to go back to School.   The political virus has taken away our freedom and removed objectivity from our lives.
So, in short, you have no defense for trump, just the same old BS rhetoric toward Biden. GTFOH!
Pence: we built 50 thousand more house than Obama/Biden did.... of course we burnt them down first.
I think you are a bit mixed up here.  Look at who's in charge now and how this would all go away, "Like a miracle." That or just like the #LiarInChief you think if you slander Biden with the shit speed by trump, you will win?
&gt;Man, can't believe Bernie would rather side with Biden/TERF  Fixed that for you.
I finally stopped laughing ... You actual said Biden was ignoring the science. You are so full of covfefe!  You said Biden is politicizing the pandemic. That is richer than you are, dumbass.
&gt;Somewhere in that empty brain of yours, you think Biden is equal to Trump  Its easy to beat up an argument that you made up.  At no point in this conversation did I say biden=trump.  I did however say TERF = Christian Conservatives.  That I'll stand by, wanna argue on that hill?
Distinciton witout a difference.  What do YOU think is going to happen when a TERF has the ear of the most powerful man on earth should Biden win?
&gt;The fact that Kamala is a terf doesn‚Äôt inherently mean that any policy will be implemented.  Yes it does, she will have the ear of the most powerful man on earth should Biden win.  If you think for a moment that doesn't carry weight, then you are deluded.
Hmmmm. I'm wouldn't call it historic as much as I would call it hysterical.  How could Biden pick out someone almost as unlikable as HRC?
Biden will get lost on his way there. Probably end up at the US Senate and wonder why no ones letting him in.
&gt;trans issues aren't literally the only issues in the world  Didn't say it was, but since I'm not getting shit out of Biden in the way of socialism, the next best thing is Trans stuff.  Which I won't get either because Harris is a TERF.
&gt;Why are you deflecting?  I'm not, I'm specifically answering this:  &gt;Infinitely more possible it happens under a dem  &gt;Unless you genuinely think trump and Biden are identical.  When it comes to trans rights? Yeah absolutely.
Do you not see the irony in this response?  ‚ÄúWhy doesn‚Äôt Biden answer questions?‚Äù  ‚ÄúAsk him that.‚Äù ü§£ü§£ü§£
LOL right, because Biden and Harris have absolutely sterling reputations when it comes to transgender people. üòÇüòÇüòÇ
Dont trust Biden,  Biden is asshoe.
The late Arizona congressman ‚ÄúMo‚Äù Udall used to say, ‚ÄúThe only cure for presidential fever is embalming fluid.‚Äù  #FoxNews
Even more validation that the Biden-Harris ticket is pro-Israel and not a radical leftist nightmare as Trump would have you believe.
Priority #1, get Biden elected  Priority #2, get Trump physically out of the White House  Priority #3, Hold them all accountable for everything they did
Somebody check on   and see if she ok. All the campaigning she did and Biden didn‚Äôt pick her. üòÇüòÇ. She loses at everything. Maybe she should work with trump if she want to win.
biden talks a lot about justice and support for women so why isn't his female victims getting justice for his sexual assault and misconduct why isn't the kids getting justice for his sexual misconduct why are women even considering voting for a sex offender
From a friend of mine, An interesting take on Biden's perverse nature.
The amount of hypocrisy. Look at some Kamel and Joe Biden history real quick.... Oh thats right the history only matters if you dont like them right?
I just don‚Äôt get how people don‚Äôt understand that a literal toad would be better than Donald trump.   No Biden is not ideal, but I'd be quick to elect a tree branch over Trump.
Biden will fragged with in her first week.

Then some leftists waffling at me that we are going to win at some point in the undetermined future *if only I vote for Biden and Harris*  I find the entire concept laughable.
Where are you?  Join up with Meidas brothers or Lincoln Project. I know, Lincoln guys hx, but visible unifying of parties behind Biden is so much needed.
I think that trend, if you want to call it that, is vastly overstated. Neoliberalism won, handedly. You even have Biden flagrantly telling progressives, much less socialists, to not vote for him.  Now I'm given the choice of a rapist and a transphobe vs. a rapist and a transphobe

That's truth biden will create millions of jobs with clean energy then say we will buy clean energy
How about Trump show some leadership with the virus. It is killing Americans.  Trump hits back at Biden after call for national mask mandate: ‚ÄòStop playing politics with the virus‚Äô.   via
The DNC is the party of rapists (Clinton), child molesters (Biden), and setting rapists free (Hilary, Kamala and just about every Dem governor). Let's not forget easily killing rapist's babies at Planned Parenthood. How does anyone proudly be a part of this party?
Doesn't Joe believe science over facts? Oh wait, he believes in truth over facts. That's right.   I believe in competence over a Biden presidency. #Trump2020
I have not donated to politics since TV ads drive me up a wall. BUT I am now sending money to Biden since the GOP screwing around the USPS has really made me mad.

Biden and his team vetted her. They don‚Äôt make huge glaring mistakes like Team Cheeto.
The problem for the dems is they have to make it look like the aliens are pro Biden and anti trump.
I rarely have given money to candidates since they buy tv ads, I don't enjoy. BUT after hearing Trump stopping money to the USPS in order to skew the vote, I am furious and will send $$ to Biden now The USPS deliver our meds but if I didn't pick up my mail he would notify the law
Call your Senator and Representative and give them an earful.   Doesn't he realize seniors get their meds through USPS? He is only doing this to cheat the vote.  I usually don't donate but I am going to give $$ to Biden now. I think Trump would sell his kids to get re-elected.
Trump thinks he can bully us, by hurting our post office.  Call your Senator and Representative and give them an earful.  Doesn't he realize seniors get their meds through USPS? He is only doing this to cheat the vote. I usually don't donate but I am going to give $$ to Biden now
I doubt  is jealous of people disguised as journalists who are rather a mouthpiece for the Democrats and the Dems pick Biden! They go hand in hand, Media and Biden! They all are asleep at the wheel!
The truth comes out...Biden will leave office just after taking office and Harris will be President of Dems win!
Fact Check: Kamala Harris Did NOT Call Joe Biden 'A Racist And A Rapist'
Joe Biden asking people to wear a mask to save lives in not tyranny! What is TYRANNY is Trump dismantling the United States Postal Service to ‚Äútry‚Äù and Winn the election
Second topic during official press conference is actually a campaign attack on Biden. Abuse of office and the bully pulpit.  #ETTD traditions and respect for norms
I hope that the Secret Service for Joe Biden checked the closets in his basement for little girls.
The real question should be who will be Kamala Harris VP? You know Biden gonna resign like two weeks in
Trump thought Biden would pick Karen Bass because she wouldn't 'outshine' him  We all know any woman Biden would have picked would "outshine him!"
Until now, Israel has had no diplomatic relations with Gulf Arab countries. Unlike Biden, who capitulated to the Iranian regime,  has done what no other Administration has been able to do, begin the process of peace in the Middle East

It‚Äôs interesting that you can replace the name Joe Biden with Donald Trump in that sentence and it‚Äôs pretty accurate.
Trump might be bad but he's no where near as bad as Biden. Biden is more racist and has written bills that has put countless blacks in jail
You guys, what 3rd party candidate are you gonna write in? Maybe that way the Democratic Party listens to you. If you don‚Äôt want to vote for Biden or Trump, I get it. But explain to me how being silent during the only time you get to be heard is going to help us?
The more important part there is how you don't plan on actively resisting the Biden admin's agenda once he's in office, you'll become complacent instead. If you did then I would forgive you for making what -would be- a reasonable, pragmatic lesser evil choice in voting for Biden.
Join me in supporting Joe Biden via
Yes. Because you know that he is likely to be on a two month temper tantrum and there is absolutely no telling what he will do to make things more difficult for Biden and to get revenge for losing. Maybe they should limit presidential powers after an election loss.ü§´
Did you actively #Resist and protest when Obama bombed Libya back into the stone age? No? And of course you're not going to do anything like that when Biden or Harris start a new war, either, because brown people's lives don't matter when a üü¶ president is the one bombing them.
that we need to shot biden with 45 and keep firing till we have a progressive potus üßêü§î. JS
they didn‚Äôt leave us to be honest biden did straight up say if we didn‚Äôt like his policies don‚Äôt vote for him right there on camera for the world to see. even said to poc if he‚Äôs not giving them what they wanted he‚Äôs not their choice either don‚Äôt vote for him, great üëç way to win
I am no so desperate to get rid of Trump as to vote for Biden.  I am not so desperate to avoid Biden as to vote for Trump.  My only hope is in the sovereignty of God and that one day Jesus Christ will set all things right and rule in perfect righteousness.
I'm sorry, I just cant vote for Joe Biden because of the KHive and how toxic Joe supporters are. All they do is insult everyone else around them. Frankly, if that's the kind of folks Joe attracts, then why the hell would I want to vote for a toxic person?
Without talking about Trump, why should Joe Biden become POTUS? What are his policies that will actually help poor Americans? Whats his stance on the Military Police force and Mass incarceration? Whats his stance on Deportations? Is he still 4 them?

Please listen to David on this. We need a groundbreaking super wave of votes for Biden, Harris. We can't take another four years of trump. #DumpTrump2020
A vote for Ye is a vote for trump..not saying Biden is any better but we need Chester cheeta out!!
fyi she‚Äôs in public office i can judge wtf ever i want, don‚Äôt want judged stay out of office. just like the potus. and kiddy diddler biden. or shitty obama. and craps clinton.
she mainly put poc behind bars for pot crimes then admits she was smoking weed in college. also marred a white boy. she‚Äôs asian/black. susan rice was a better choice and if a black women was what we needed for change the dnc picked wrong. or was that as close as racist biden can

nope democrats will still blame the far far leftist like us. anyone who admits to not voting for biden they‚Äôre going scream and rant it‚Äôs our fault he lost. just like 16 all over again. i already know it. i can feel the hate brewing already. they know how to deflect.
Ok, now I know you don't know what it is you're talking about. I guess expecting someone like you to have read books was too much of an ask. Biden is VERY center left, but I guess from your point of view everyone left of McCarthy is a commie.

Think the democrat's were bad when they were the confederacy wait till biden gets in this country will see another Stalin and a rebellion like this world has never seen before
President has been talking for over an hour on Maria Bartiromo's show. In a normal election year, the democrat candidate would be demanding equal time. I doubt Biden could last 5 minutes let alone an hour having an unscripted discussion like that.
Only 5% of all donations goes to the actual cause the rest goes in pockets wonder how much money went in biden's pocket
Biden will bypass congress just like obama and pass pelosi's gun law which takes away your rights to protect yourself teach your kids to do the same and survival skills, ask yourselves why the democrat's want to do this, We can't let biden do this
Let's hear about black people who hate and commit hate crimes no all hate crime are committed by white people but that's all we hear about that door swings both ways biden
Dumb and Deceitful... Biden and Harris... The short bus candidates from the Delesional Democrats who are short on capability but long on hype and unrealistic expections.  Prediction:. Historic landslide victory by  Pokoredicted.
This all feels so poorly timed. He should (not really) be saying that he'll definitely push for schools to be open for the Spring of '21, so whether he loses or wins, he's got an option. If he wins, he can walk out back, if he loses, he can set a time bomb for Biden. Strategy.
Attack Trump but you dont say anything about Biden. Why is that? You guys arent news you are talking heads!
You think he ‚Äúforgot‚Äù that president Trump denounced the white suprematism before finishing or he is just this much a POS? I can answer that. He raised Hunter Biden and touches small children. #4MoreYears
U like Harris... as a black man... knowing she locked up countless young black males for truancy...really these kids now have no future! Just because you might hate Trump you side by her... really üò≥ either you think you‚Äôre White or some shit or you list your marbles like Biden..
His entire point is that his problem with Biden‚Äôs plan to rezone suburbs to stop single family houses and force low-income housing is not fair to those who work hard to live a suburban life. His mention of minorities is to say they too are neg. affected.
Voting for Biden is ancient Israel voluntarily surrendering to the Babylonians.  Voting for Trump is ancient Israel going to Egypt for aid against the Babylonians.  Both choices are immoral.
Indeed.  Both Biden and Trump are reprehensible choices and should both be refused support.  Very simple.
Why would anyone? Who knows man. But voting for a third party or not voting for Biden is a vote for him which is against what progressives want. So why are you even considering Biden/Harris a bad vote lol
But how is voting for Trump taking more of a step toward towards that‚Äôs goal then voting for Biden? We all know Kamala will take over in 2 years.
I'm looking forward to President Biden tackling a pile of OE's to cancel all of trumps OE's.
The trump train blasts thru town with no regard for citizens safety and Biden shows he has the strength to pump a railroad hand car.
Views on things like the economy but Trump has no morals, no ability to see things two sides, no remorse for people, and honestly cares more for the unborn than the living, he‚Äôs not what we need right now we need hope, for me it‚Äôs more byedon than Biden!!!  #lincolnvoter

So since you all went after sticker Carlson last night for not saying Kamalaha name right are you going after Biden since he said the wrong name today. Doubtful!!! why you all suck balls
i genuinely don‚Äôt understand the people who are like ‚Äúwell i‚Äôm not voting cause biden isn‚Äôt any better than trump‚Äù okay but like??? you do realize trump is still AWFUL. he surrounds himself with maniacs.
You know who was a big threat to Latinx? The Deporter in Chief Obama. Biden and Obama were sued by the ACLU in 2015 for family separation but please go on about how Joe will be some great savior of America when it's working as he intended it to work with his laws
Under Obama/Biden, I lost 2 different construction jobs. Both times the Owners closed their business because of Obamacare. Under President Trump &amp; Mike Pence I had MANY opportunities to choose from. They say they will create more jobs- LIERS. Will destroy us.
Also, just because I am critical about Joe and his faults does not mean I support the Red Racist Rapist over the Blue Racist Rapist. Look at what Joe's done. Look at who was in charge right before Trump, Obama and Biden. What will Biden do that he didn't do in 8 years?
Do you mean when Biden lied about Trump actually said in Charlottesville.
You‚Äôre advancing the narrative to allow Harris to debate Trump instead of Biden. Be careful what you say.
And you‚Äôre gonna vote for Biden aren‚Äôt you üòï please don‚Äôt break my heart
Biden is not afraid of a strong very intelligent woman, while Trump attacks the women he fears the most as "nasty."  It's Trump's tell.

Both of you do is lie to everybody. If Joe Biden was president right now we would lose 1 million lives to the pandemic.
They were not going to choose anyone else. Needed to be a woman and not white since Biden is about as white bread as you can get
Love this üíØ  Joe Biden and Kamala Harris introduce their presidential ticket in Delaware
Love the Union workers response to biden wanting to fight one of their own for asking a gun question that biden denies ever happen even though he's on video, on video for sniffing hair he denies that are you seeing a pattern yet
#KamalaHarris seems like a woman that would be fun to have on a Girl's Night Out on the town. But her positions have shifted so I'm not sure what she believes. Has she ever said anything on foreign policy? So many of Biden's positions over decades have been wrong.
Biden wants our children to be taught the Islamic religion in American schools. Our children have been told they don‚Äôt dare pray in school.. yet he wants this. Take that RED PILL before it‚Äôs too late
The Biden/Harris ticket is by no means ideal. But it‚Äôs much better than what we have and I‚Äôm confident it will be an administration we can work with. Plus Kamala will help pave the way to the White House for so many women of color to follow her
The Biden/Harris ticket has now raised over 10.8 million dollars...
Joe Biden will never be President. Repost if you agree.

My dog got his and is voting for Biden/Harris2020 lol
Incremental change like how Obama bombed more weddings than Bush? How Biden caused more black people to be jailed than Reagan? Not sure the change is going in the right direction there, random bearded white centrist.
Trump has absolutely been sedated for this Biden/Harris Q&amp;A presser.
It only takes a moment to realize that 2020 is not about Trump v Biden. That is the subject of today's 10 minute episode.
Just another HIDIN BIDEN
I would think Biden has many cream of the crop candidates. I am sure they want this nightmare to end as much as we do.
There's a part of me that's glad Biden picked #KamalaForVP because at least she has a law background and has worked to enforce it. BUT when the first thing I saw yesterday was that BLM spokeswoman from Chicago saying looting was fine &amp; claimed they were...
As we all know, if Donald Trump isn't reelected, Joe Biden will get rid of all toilets! That's priority number 2, as soon as he murders God, his number 1 priority.
A good start would for Joe Biden to make Sally Yates his AG &amp; undo the damage done to the Justice Department by Barr!
The confederacy is just trying to save face by picking kamala but all I heard was biden playing the blame game as always and lies will not support a sex offender or corruption
I can see us having 3 months of hella laughs with the Biden/Harris Dem ticket  As long as we bring it on Nov 3rd t Don't take this election lightly, never ever The left is desperate!
So vote for the person who created the camps and the police state, that will fix it right good! We are in this mess because of Biden. They might as well say to America, sit down, shut up, and obey because both sides will lock you up for it. Crime Bill/Cop 2020 FTW!
eight years of obama he didn't help the poor, the disabled, our vets, social security, and black people but he did help hos rich friends and China you can expect the same from biden after all obama endorses corruption criminals stick together
Joe Biden is BEYOND DISGRACEFUL!
Fact democrat's like polis raised Our unemployment rate because he kept small businesses from opening up while corporations stayed open that's the democrat's helping Us more like helping their rich friends Trump has no control over democrat's like that grow up biden
Great speech biden it's all Trump's fault us democrat's have no part in this country falling apart even though eight years of obama is proof of his boosting China's economy not Ours
Oops, Biden mispronounced Kamala‚Äôs name, but quickly corrected himself
Biden has the nerve to say, "I will create jobs where President Trump has failed." WHAT A JOKE !!
So one thing I did notice is that MSNBC did not carry that trump announcement of how schools can go back to in person learning. Instead they showed the empty stage at Biden‚Äôs event. üëçüèª
Biden's AG is going to be very busy. Lock them all up!
I met Joe Biden 35 years ago and he is the kindest, most gracious and thoughtful man I have met except my husband. Remember he came forward supporting gay marriage on Meet the Press long before Obama. And I adore Obama too. Then there is Jill- more to come.
Why wold progressives say ANYTHING to discredit Biden/Harris? Anytime anywhare Bernie is not the nominee. When you study dialectic world view you know prigress is made when a synthesis is achieved. Black and white merely alternates which isn‚Äôt efficacious
&gt;You made the claim that Biden isn‚Äôt harm reduction.  Yeah, in the context of Transgender people. My chief complaint against Harris.  Remember?
why would you make a statement like that if you weren't afraid of what Biden brings to the table? You showed your cards about Biden's VP pick being the "Actual" President choice for the Dems and Trump Haters like yourself! You are all terrified "Biden being Alone"
Seems like Antifa solider is inter-changable with Biden supporter.
#JoeBidenISAntifa So! antifa.c0m now redirects to joebiden.c0m Does this mean Joe Biden owns the  domain name? Did he register it? Does he maintain it? Does he fund it? The Antifa page before Kamala update.
Just for a laughs I have to see the Joe &amp; Kamala meetup I hope Biden speaks with the media
What‚Äôs happening now in America is Trumps fault not Biden‚Äôs üôÑ is Biden the president??? Nope Trump is! He failed at leadership
You've not demonstrated that Biden and Harris record is irrelevant and will be better for trans people. Harris is a fucking TERF, so you've got a big fucking hill to climb.
Tell me, how is Biden/Harris going to be better for transgender people when their records do not fucking reflect it?
Shake me all you want, you cannot devide Biden or Harris from their records. I don't know why a lot of you seem to think their histories are irrelevant. I'm 38, I've seen this song and dance before.
. and  is hours late today. I bet #Biden won't come back out of the basement.  #Trump2020
I just have to laugh when on the Biden Harris page They're crediting Sleepy Joe with his leadership during covid19 Just how do you lead from your basement?
Come on Kalief. What is the problem with Biden/Harris?
I‚Äôm not saying ‚Äúdon‚Äôt vote for Biden.‚Äù In fact I‚Äôm actively hoping for Biden‚Äôs success. Part of that success is going to involve reaching out to groups he has historically ignored or left behind. Why don‚Äôt you try to help out?
Not on your life. Wouldn‚Äôt miss the debate! I want to know how bad is Biden is diminishing. GOT MY POPCORN READYü§£ü§£ü§£
Fact Check: Kamala Harris Said She Believed Women Who Said They Felt 'Uncomfortable' By Biden Touching -- NOT 'Rape Accusers'
Trump is a socialst president who wants to push vaccines on us at warpspeed just as much as biden. But trump is against China so ill vote for him. What china is doing to its ppl and nearby neighbors is appalling and despicable human rights abuse
y'all underestimate how much people will stop paying attention if biden gets elected  nothing will fundamentally change but so long as bad orange man isn't on the news all the liberals will be off to brunch and business as usual, thinking their summer blm ig stories saved america
"I can see Russia from my window, and they're scared of Joe Biden!"
You're a HACK and a FAKE, your word means nothing. Your a LOSER and showed it running against Biden .
Joe Biden Courts Islam, not Muslims
Realistically it should be Trump debating Harris. Biden is a non-factor.
This is the important Biden/Harris coverage right here:
from this story by    ‚ÄúBlack women don‚Äôt just need one spot. We need representation at all levels of government, business, education ‚Äî everywhere,‚Äù  said. ‚Äú...I think (Harris and Biden) can make that happen, too.‚Äù
Kamala Harris being named Joe Biden‚Äôs vice presidential pick sets a match-up between the California senator and Vice President Mike Pence on the debate stage in October.
I did!! You can, too! Chip in to elect Joe Biden, Kamala Harris and other Democrats on the ballot
How Joe Biden's #Climate Plan Could Be Transformative - Rolling Stone #ClimateAction #ClimateActionNow #Vote
I murder the left all time. But normy conservatives are so tiresome too..constantly asking now if Kamala still thinks Biden is a racist/sex offender etc. Who tf cares? It‚Äôs clear that she has precisely 0 political principles/morals....
liar Tobin, Biden is devout practicing Catholic.
Trump reacts to Biden, Kamala Harris ticket exclusively on 'Hannity' | P...  via   Oh boy #FoxNews  #Hannity must have gotten his knee pads out to get Chief  on.... Check it out.
So half the TL is telling me they dislike Biden/Kamala‚Äôs voting record more than they dislike what we‚Äôve seen from a Trump led adminstration.   Hypothetically, what do you think Trumps voting record would be had he been a lifelong politician?
donald trump's greatest weakness is someone just saying 'oh for sure man' to him. in many ways, that makes joe biden, a guy who can only say stuff like, 'cmon man, what are you, smoking pcp? am i in an opium den right now??' the perfect opposition
Translation of  "I thought I fooled Biden by all my talk of her being a fine running mate and he'd look elsewhere. Now I'm shitting my pants because I'm going to get beat like a two dollar--well you know--those people I pay for sex."
I can find citations that say Biden/Harris2020 - We'll still kill your kids, just hide it better
N he just recently named her his running mate. She still fresh on that ticket while this matter has been about Biden v Trump.
I have called both trump and Harris evil so there for you know who I‚Äôm picking from the two of assumption? And I‚Äôm not a fan of Biden lol it‚Äôs not hard to see that the American people don‚Äôt have much to choose from and these are our options and you have every right to feel a way
I‚Äôd bet she‚Äôll be part of Biden‚Äôs admin if they win. There‚Äôs still a ton of people who need to be brought on board.
My disagreement with her being a running mate to Biden has nothing to do with how i place my vote this election and second the vote is between Biden and Trump
I am going to be upfront, neither Biden nor Harris are my first picks. but I sure as shit am voting for them to get this russian infestation out of our leadership. Let's get our house in order, and make it our house again, then let's talk about other candidates.
Very interesting.   via
Yes, yes please. Biden and/ or Harris should do this daily. Bring in guests. When no ones watching the Cheeto Rambling Rally maybe they‚Äôll stop the s**t show.
So we have a senile rascist segregationist in #Biden and a leftist who's father admitted that their family was one of the largest slave holders in Jamaica in #KamalaHarris for the #Democrats.
I'm not ecstatic about Harris, especially not now. But I think this election may decide *whether* we still have the ability to vote in future elections.   So, I hope the country elects Biden and then continually turns up the heat under the entire Democratic party.
Really looking forward to Biden's sad excuse for debate...
Already talking of #Biden 's step down. That was quick.
How about cheating, stealing or lying? Trump has probably had something to do with abortion in some way or form. Your group needs to re-evaluate it‚Äôs spin on Biden/Harris stop preaching and start teaching...
One example that will support my case is literally last year, Kamala Harris endorsed several women that claimed Joe Biden touched them in sexually aggressive ways. And now she‚Äôs going to work with him in the White House ? Yeah ok.
That isn‚Äôt well-regulated capitalism &amp; it‚Äôs why you need democratic governments, to address these kind of externalities. Free market fundamentalists that support Trump want businesses to address these problems. Tell me how not voting for Biden is going to solve them.
It was really just probably the way I read the tweet when you said oh well fuck everyone else. I care about the election hence the reason why Im voting for Jo Jorgensen. Will that help our current president? Possibly but I see Kamala Harris and Biden as an equally horrible choice
New drinking game: take a shot every time Biden sniffs Harris. We gon' get turnt this election season!
I back America üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏! Biden and Harris will make it great again!!! Let‚Äôs gooooo!!
Janet Reed a democrat activist arrested for election tampering on 400 ballots it's already started that's why biden is for mail in ballots only way he can win just like obama
Why would anyone in the great nation vote for Joe Biden knowing he‚Äôs just going to step down?
You scared? I bet you are  !  &amp; Biden are going to clean the floor with you and your side kick Pence (trump‚Äôs lil bitch)!
this is obamacare I have a endrinal dysfunction feels like I've been hit with 110 house electrical 24/7 dr says I'm not sick enough to help because I take a pain pill for my level 8 pain I'm in 24/7 if I stop taking it they will help me don't let biden get in office
Honestly when it comes to the two choices of Biden x Harris or the other bafoons in the White House, it‚Äôs kind of like you just have to pick the better evil. They all suck and don‚Äôt have any interest in the American people but to take their money.
Biden is going to crash and burn. Obama and Rice had the foresight to avoid going down with him.
Why would I want to give millionaires more money already stole enough from The People biden along with your son
Oh, I think Dodd really doesn't like Harris, but I was interested in why Biden didn't shut that shit down..
If I was  I'd do the following: - Put  next to unhinged    - Use #California's failures for what #BidenHarris want  - Play the video on loop where #KamalaHarris called #Biden a #rascist   -Address Harris as the real presidential candidate
Do you think Biden let Dodd savage Harris in the press, to see how she would handle it? Seeing as how Trump will be a total racist, sexist asshole..
She's hoping to be #1 soon after Biden comes out of the basement. ü§£ü§£
Well Kamela Harris will not have to read a script when she goes ahead and implements amendment 26 shortly after Joe Biden as president
Anyone Voting for Joe Biden is putting our Country in a Dooms Day device.  #WeAreDoomed
2 years, then Biden will be declared mentaly unable. She will then be able to run for 2 more terms, if elected giving her 10 years! I can't even imagine!!!!
Biden is a moderate.  You seem to have problems grasping that.  Harris is also more moderate than one might think.  Now, I do realize your reactionary authoritarian wing of your party, but seriously?
Yes. 45 has always behaved like a child. Expect no less and vote Biden/Harris 2020.
Biden lays a trap for Trump in picking Harris
I already hated biden, but was going to vote for him.  Kamala? Peace the fuck out.   Voting for myself in November and voting progressives down the ticket.
The fact that  called Biden a racist and said that she believed the sexual misconduct issues with him but switched it up 180 now is fascinating
No we‚Äôre just excited for someone worthwhile like AOC to be president and not ‚ÄúNothing will fundamentally change... no one‚Äôs standard of living will change under my administration‚Äù Biden
We can't, if he had selected a progressive VP? Maybe you could make an argument there. Instead he chose a cop who relished making all kinds of people's lives more difficult.  I won't vote for Biden/Harris for the same reasons I won't vote for Trump/Pence.
You've the right of it.  Both tickets (Biden/Harris vs Trump/Pence) have a LONG history of making transgender people's lives unnecessarily difficult.   So I'll be voting 4 myself and voting progressives down the ticket. Liberals can kiss my commie ass. All of it. Every last inch
You keep talking about this as punishing Biden, I'm not defending his shitty record. I'm saying having him in the Executive seat will be significantly better than Trump in the seat in 2021. "Deserve" is the wrong word, what's best for marginalized communities? Trump?
It‚Äôs almost like no one is excited for the next administration and their entire platform of being ‚Äúnot Trump‚Äù and are looking forward to after Biden/Harris so we can do worthwhile things like M4A finally.
So will the democrats with their endless republican or pro-corporate policies.  I am pretty sure Biden will lead to an even worse Trump.  Much like Clinton led to Bush, and Obama led to Trump.    There is no spin on winning.  It's a lose/lose/lose situation, by design.
Biden sucks though. Sure Trump is worse but I've done this lesser of two evils since Bush/Gore.  U're smart you know a lot of shit and explain it in great detail but you're just wrong on this Biden shit. There is no real choice. U just haven't been disillusioned but give it time.
I‚Äôm gonna be voting for Biden/Kamala with one hand and scrawling‚Äúfuck the police‚Äù on the wall of the booth with the other hand.   Seriously though- both these problematic candidates respond to political pressure, and NOBODY is better at political pressure than BLM.
Well for the uneducated majority of America, people will see that she‚Äôs black and a woman and automatically vote for her+Biden. Sensible people know she‚Äôs horrible.
‚ÄúThen enemy of my enemy, is my friend‚Äù Biden/Harris.....‚ÄùPlan, plot and strategize, but bomb first‚Äù (Tupac).
Highlighting the differences between Biden and Harris, too spiteful to realize, it‚Äôs the exact reason she was chosen.  Strategized from the advisory of Obama.
Lol  doesn't comprehend how someone can be honest and tell someone when they are upset with them over an issue, then resolve it.   HIS ANSWER TO SOMEONE UPSET WITH HIM... FIRE THEM OR UNLEASH MILITARY FORCE UPON THEM. HE DOESN'T GET IT!
of course joe biden picks a cop. but also a black woman getting closer to the oval. but its still ACAB
Kamala Harris will be a good VP. But I am bit surprised that Biden didn‚Äôt pick me.
Strategically, Biden made the perfect pick. It wasn‚Äôt to hard using common sense either.
..and that's what our country needs right now.  you sold out completely to   So shut up altogether. #Biden/Harris2020
Pick your fighter:  8 years of Biden  or  4 more years of Trump, followed by 8 years of    Got damn, that‚Äôs a tough one
Fantastic!!
I can't imagine Trump, a man whose ego lives in a glass house, choosing anyone as strong as Sen Harris for a job in his admin.  Kudos to VP Biden for choosing someone who will make him a better president.
Of course not!! That's why I love looking for the earpieces they wear and listen the pause when they answer questions to listen to the person feeding them their lines via the earpieces! Nevertheless, Biden will gloriously go down in flames during the debate with Trump.
I‚Äôm a white guy who is very anxious to get my Colorado ballot in the mail and vote for Biden/Harris. I was torn during the D debates between Harris and Warren. After Harris dropped out I was happy to vote for Warren. But now I get to vote for Harris too!
I need a Biden/Harris coffee mug.
is so damn stupid and keeps changing the narrative.  Today he says that if Biden wins then Iran will own our country.  Yesterday he said if Biden wins then we‚Äôll all be speaking Chinese because China will own our country.  Jesus Christ, can he make up his mind?
Only because I have 0 faith in any third party victory and Biden/Harris is an easier evil to deal with than another 4 years of the Fascistsaurus.
We already figured out that Biden is also a fascist since he said nothing would change under his presidency. So, back at you bud.
Does anyone else remember when Kamala Harris said she believed the women who accused Biden of touching them inappropriately, just last year? And now she's his....running mate? Just me? Cool ok bye üëãüèª
Trump is a fascist. Biden specifically said nothing will change. What does this make Biden?
Does Biden know who he picked?
I thought someone here said that they weren't voting for Biden, but whoever he picked for VP.  But yeah, that seems to be the thought now.
I really get sick and tired I'm hearing all of you Marxist a****** saying that Joe Biden this and Joe Biden that. Joe Biden is sitting in a corner drooling on himself.
She also called Biden a racist.
QUOTES LIKE THIS (AND THERE ARE MANY OF THEM FROM HARRIS) NEED TO BE INCLUDED IN TRUMPS ADDS! BIDEN IS SO CLUELESS; HE DOESN'T RECALL ANY OF HARRIS RADICAL CHARGES IN THE  DEM DEBATES! THEIR CAMPAIGN  SINK LIKE THE TITANIC!
Fact Check: Nancy Pelosi Did NOT 'Confirm China Would Prefer Joe Biden'
She is against fracking. She favors $ benefits for illegals. She calls ICE the KKK. She believed Biden‚Äôs accuser. She jailed many minorities as DA. Ask her about Willie Brown‚Äôs ‚Äúhelp‚Äù ü§≠.
She slept her way to where she is. I don't think a majority of Americans would want her to take over as president when Biden can't. Trump wins!
She was "mean"? Coming from someone who follows a guy who says you don't even have to ask women... "just grab em by the pussy"... a man who called Mexicans rapist and murderers... discriminated against Blacks so often that he was sued &amp; you say Harris was MEAN to Biden?  LMMFAO!!
Seeing right and left wing pundits lose their minds on Twitter over Kamala being Biden's VP pick fills me up with an intense joy at witnessing the deluge of their combined tears.
I wonder who Kanye will choose for VP? ü§î  I'm already bored with Biden/Harris.  #Trump2020

Sorry, but the racist who still support that, love Trump, not Biden! Nice try though, hypocrite!
I'm losing count on all the pro #Biden troll accounts just started the last couple of months.

Pick Biden = Die of climate change, he wont do enough Pick Trump = Die of climate change, just a little faster Pick a third party = Die of climate change, one of two above win anyway Pick Revolution = World's ability to fight climate change obliterated Welcome to the end
They're afraid of Harris because they know if Biden wins she's the 47th POTUS and they DO NOT WANT THAT.
Biden chooses Kamala Harris as his VP running mate.  She isn't African American. She is Jamaican and Indian...but bet they spin it different.   Feel energized yet?   Didn't think so.

Tell pelosi to give Us the cure everything adds up that pelosi and her puppets are behind it instead she's waiting for biden to get in so they can sell it to Us
Won't watch him today or in any way let him ruin a great day for team Biden and what is simply bad news for Trump and that other guy...oh yeah, Pence.
Biden/Harris 2020. Watch your soup Joe
Not ONE thing you just said about Biden is even remotely true!!!
biden's own words I will help my rich friends with obamacare, We will BUY clean energy, I never did that even though he's on video, I support corruption as long as my friends and me get rich,  I'm for socialism that's the only truth he has told
You're so hot on the defensive, you don't even realize I'm saying your candidate of choice SHOULD have more of a chance on the ballot.  I'm voting Biden because I understand how our broken system is currently works and the stakes involved in this race. But we should change it.
I like to have fallen out of my chair when almost in the same sentence he said Kamala was so nasty to Biden  then he went on to call Sen. Warren not by her name but "Pocahantas".
Good thing Biden/Harris 2020 will shut down any of the GOP and Trump's claims they are socialists.   #toolate #feelthebern

I'll never vote for her or Joe Biden. #CorruptPolitians
Listening to Trump talk about the "Radical Left" while addressing Joe Biden's selection of Kamala Harris for VP in 2020. Has he(Trump), in the last 10 years, said "radical right? Not that Trump is a far right, or even "radical right", he's just talking to his base.

I hate Biden‚Äôs VP pick...I really do, but I hate the prospect of 4 more years of Trump even more.
Joe Biden and Kamala Harris have been who I wanted on the ticket all along! You got my vote easily! Let's take our country back! #BidenHarris2020
when biden drops out she is the presidential pick
Biden pick proves the DNCs confidence in their ability to cheat.
Ladies and gentlemen...trump is showing you how chickenshyt scared he is of Biden/Harris
Time to start the clock before she "doesn't kill herself." Especially with the Biden VP pick.
I had hoped it would be her. Biden needs someone who will stand up for what she believes is right.  Will fight for him. Will tell it like it is.

Yes they are. Joe's Crime Bill is what created the state the Police are in right now. Joe's bill did everything but "put the death penalty for Jay Walking" - Joe Biden -1994   But sure, lets go on how he will fix what he created.
Honestly, if you had asked Trump insiders off the record at the beginning of the Democratic Primaries, a Biden/Harris ticket would have probably been at the top of their "Worst Case Scenario" tickets to go up against.
Here's my prediction......Kamala will NEVER become President of the US.  Neither will Jill Biden.  er....I mean Joe Biden.  Got confused since Joe's wife has had more appearances on socialist networks than Joe has.
here's a friendly reminder
I'm not lying. Joe Biden wrote the Crime Bill that locked up millions of Black Americans. Joe's Crime Bill militarized the police force but sure, go on how I'm Lying about Joes Record. Hell, Under Obama/Biden, the ACLU Sued to close the Camps. But sure Jan, He's fixing it

Why are you defending her? There‚Äôs NO excuse for someone that is supposed to be educated like her! You people don‚Äôt give Trump a break but you‚Äôll give someone like her a break. You give Biden a break too for the racist comments he makes? Of course you do!

Fact check is that this is not joe biden operating this account. Stupid ppl that say fact check at the beginning lets you know their ignorant betas
Thats all you got? He swallowed up everyones time? What policies do you feel Biden has that are better than Trumps? Do you feel Biden is more adept at leading than Trump? If yes, how so? Biden being in politics for 49yrs and not done anything he says he will do is ok?
They were chosen for their skills as well. Biden knows how to vet and he does it well. All the women in the running have all the skills they need. We‚Äôre back to the cream of the crop choices, no more bottom of the barrel.

I‚Äôm over it. Just announce already so I can buy my Biden/&lt;insert VP last name here&gt; T-shirt
Please don't be blind! Donald Trump NOR Joe Biden are fit candidates to run this country! To much selfishness/fraud in reps and dems! I know libertarians have a bad name because of all the radicals, but  has a good idea on how a free country is supposed to be ran!
Hey! It‚Äôs Joe Biden As a kid! Same story, different song!!! üòÇüòÇ
Well said. I can see both sides normally. Just can‚Äôt understand anyone overlooking all the horrific things about Biden without even getting into sundowning.

Trump Tries To Portray Joe Biden As A Racist | Morning Joe | MSNBC  via  So Chief  you and  both have pronunciation issues, hell we all do...America just needs to see what you both have on the table to help US become United
I hope so. No more speculation about Biden's admin picks...Naming Cabinet members now will reassure voters that Biden is the ONLY choice, AND, it'll REALLY piss Trump off!
Hannity: Biden doesn't know what city he's in  via   VP  is this reporting true? I only take  's reporting with a grain of salt...But still VP  is this true?
Anyone else see how #Biden is just saying what  already done and is doing? #Trump2020
Biden also can't wait to hear who was chosen for him!!
You know what will keep Trumps ass in office? If he starts a new war. I don't trust him and Biden ain't much better. Dude takes way too many bong rips before his basement rallies. Hahah! Man. If that was the case. We need a leader that bring us together. üå≥
NEWS UPDATE: Biden has been soooo busy...the announcement of his VP will be delayed...
Try to be welcoming. I‚Äôm a life long Republican and I‚Äôm voting for Biden. I did not vote for Donald. Final represents everything I‚Äôm opposed to and he stands for nothing. #RepublicansForBiden
A bunch of losers supporting someone that is gonna lose big..yawn can Biden‚Äôs wife test him for dimentia? #waiting
Not in a World where Biden is in the Whitehouse. If he wins, EVERYTHING we see a "sliver of light" of today will forever be sealed and put in the deepest recess of the Ocean.   Obamagate   Bidengate   Hurricane   Crossfire   FISA Abuses   Epstien/Maxwell  IT WILL ALL VANISH!!!

As Mr. Varvel points out, Biden's head is missing a few pieces.
The only thing threatening Our democracy is the democrat's they are fighting for socialism look how well that worked for Lebanon now the people over thrown their government from all the corruption and now have no government that's biden that will be Us
White people are not keeping black people from voting it's politician's like biden who use black people to get in office use gangs to control their votes and Lewis knew this and did he march on hos fellow democrat's to change that
Biden will destroy America.
needs to get off the pot. Pick a damn VP already Joe! I like  She‚Äôs smart and she offers a contrast to Biden‚Äôs old school mentality. But whatever he does, he needs to do it NOW!
preferable option to  who is actively and transparently trying to dismantle this country. As a Republican,I will be voting for Biden because I see even more disaster if we have another 4 years of The Orange Clown we have now.
needs to be VERY careful in the coming weeks. This election is Groundhog Day. In 2016, we had two very unpopular candidates. And here we are again. Biden has a lot of baggage and he does make truly uncomfortable statements. However, a Biden Presidency is much more
Plus she has experience with Biden having served on the Obama administration.
I eagerly await Biden's announcement for his VP.
Is Biden pining for the fjords?
Fuck Joe Biden!
Yes, Biden isn't going to fuck over the USPS

So.....Biden-Harris 2020 huh?
Can we throw out the "he's mentally unfit" platform against Biden yet? They're both mentally unfit, obviously.
Give it a break Biden tweeters, he's lost already, mentally and physically.
Dr. Biden, a request.   Suggest to Joe that he should publicly support the relief package by . . and .   We need it.
So John Kaisch is going for Biden who has said himself he's got the most progressive platform ever. Don't see anything conservative about that, but its not a surprise. Many elites and life long politicians are going for Biden so they can get or keep their power.
Fact Check: Joe Biden Has NOT Promised To Outaw Gas-Powered Cars If Elected President

It‚Äôs a good thing we have this guy instead of Joe Biden, right? Imagine if you had someone up there whose mental acuity wasn‚Äôt ... oh, wait. Never mind.
How the hell did we not want Biden or Harris and now they‚Äôre telling us Biden and Harris is our only hope? I feel cheated.
Wasn't it possible when Obama and biden did it?

Haven‚Äôt the Democrats run Chicago for years? And it‚Äôs still as segregated as ever? What makes people believe Biden has the answers to racial and social injustice? When local officials can‚Äôt even take a step in the right direction
via  Trump does not understand how pathetic he is in comparison to President Lincoln or any other President.  If he were a gentleman he would resign instead of putting the nation through more of this.
Let‚Äôs let former VP Biden run his own campaign shall we?  I trust him to do what he believes is best.
Biden was never my first choice for a candidate. As an Independent voter, I'm really getting weary of voting for the lesser evil. If it were any other election, I'd be voting Jo Jorgensen, but this isn't any other election. Biden has my vote regardless.
Of course I'll vote. I voted for Sen Warren in the primaries but VP Biden HAS to pick a black woman.          times they are a-changing.
Ever been polled if you were voting for  or  I haven't. The polls say that #trump is only 3% behind #Biden.   I do not trust them, but 3% is within the margins of error &amp; about the same as when the #FakeNews said  was going to win in 2016!
Sadly, both Portland and Seattle have small, hardcore groups of anarchists who don't really have a vision beyond destroy it all. They don't care if they hurt Biden. They just revel in chaos and don't care who they hurt. This is not Antifa or BLM or Dems, they're just destroyers.
You mean the China Virus which started in China and Trump restricted travel from China to stop the massive infections of American citizens?   The policy that Biden and the Dems thought was racist.
It's August 10th, 2020 and Joe Biden has yet to pick a running mate OR do an in person interview.   Thus far, no info from the   #JoeBiden #Biden2020

Why does the #Biden2020 campaign make choosing a VP feel like that weird show "The Bachelor". Will Biden present his VP w a Rose!? #Enough WE WANT #DEMOCRACY not another reality show failure!  Ambition Has Always Been ‚ÄòLadylike‚Äô
Seems to me that there are a lot of Republicans doing videos stating they will be voting for Biden!! Guess they finally realized Trump is unbelievably stupid!
A great reason not to vote for Joe Biden.
As a liberal, I don't think  is the guy. Sorry, not sorry...  y'all claim I can't have proper ideals or leadership because I have a stbi (brain injury) 2 years ago after a mugging, but Biden has a WORSE stbi that's 32+ years old, and y'all don't even blink. H i larious
He looks very unimpressed that Biden wants to talk to him.

Obama/Biden wasted billions of tax payer funds on failed pipedream solar projects (money laundering) like Solyndra and A123...please.
Just another lib name calling. I asked if there is anything you can tout that Biden has done or is planning. And your response is he's never been Pres. So for the first time during a pres election, a candidate's record and platform don't matter.
People who want Biden to pick a woman POC  will vote for him whether he does nor doesn't.  Biden should pick Al Franken.

This was about Biden's OBVIOUS dementia. Behind a podium he's funnier than bad lip reading. What have you offered that was of any substance.
Nancy Pelosi said, ‚ÄúChina would prefer Joe Biden‚Äù to be president.   Here's why:  -Biden led the effort to grant China ‚ÄúMost Favored Nation‚Äù status &amp; supported their membership to the WTO   -Biden was the leading pitchman for the TPP which would have killed 450k U.S. jobs
Interesting video. In summary, Democrats need to do their job. I've  never thought Biden was the answer to everything. I still consider myself  unaffiliated but one step at a time. Trump must go.  Then still a lot of work to do. I don't know how anyone keeps up. Exhausting.
Why Trump is unlikely to pull off an election surprise against Biden like he did with Clinton
ask yourselves why is biden sooooooo afraid to debate Trump a real leader wouldn't be
Remember when you ran away from Andrew Neil like a little bitch? Pepperidge Farms remembers. I wouldn't trust a guy that gets murdered on tv by the likes of Andrew Neil to be able to offer any competent diagnosis of Joe Biden's faculties.

Joe Biden, women's groups expect sexist and racist attack on his running mate, and are working to blunt them. - The Washington Post
Yes, we've never even heard of Joe Biden until this year. We're very familiar with dotard Donnie.
Nor have the Democratic Party who has had ample opportunity in Senate hearings with AG Barr &amp; recent subcommittee hearings and have refused. Nor has Joe Biden that I‚Äôve seen anywhere.
Everybody has their own percentages to this, but I'm convinced Tom is describing reality here for a lot of people.  If Trump wins, I think it will be because those same people look at Biden and his masters and see zeroes on the right side of problems and solutions.
Except KFC would come out and disavow and condemn the arsonists. BLM has not, nor has the elected Democrats in office, nor has Biden.
Wait what?  Biden can go to church?  I thought that wasn't allowed.

I want to vote for this Joe Biden instead of the center right one that won't stop rambling racist nonsense.
And biden has been pictured with, and was great friends with the leader of the KKK. So, bidens action of being a friend to one, or trump having someone he isn't controlling yell white power..
poor biden he is just the dnc sock puppet
If trumo doesn't get reelected he's fired. Biden better fires the whole bunch of them.
Keep wondering where does biden want to buy this clean energy I know polis and hinkenlooper want to get it from Canada because they both invested in companies up there which is a violation of Our Constitution
Colo. great example we get all these companies to move here then the democrat's tax the shit out of them so they pack up and leave taking their jobs with them that's obama that will be biden
biden keeps saying Trump is helping his rich friends what rich friends did obama help besides the democrat's let's see China, insurance companies, the medical profession, and car manufacturers
biden and pelosi keep saying they are fighting for democracy but want to turn this country into socialism which will take Our rights away and make the poor even poorer helping the rich get richer
Have you explained why you might vote for Biden? How would your life be improved by him being President versus Trump? It‚Äôs always easier to start a conversation off with facts.

I think the evidence for Obamagate is too overwhelming for ppl not to do time, that said, these elites seemingly get away w everything from illegitimate war to fondling children so who the fuck knows.   No need for him to spy on Biden, he‚Äôll sabotage himself every time he speaks.
I read it and Cates is on to something here. Makes me think the reason they nominated Biden was to give him (and them) cover on the Ukrainian scam. Anyone seen Hunter lately? Wasn't he supposed to go to court with his baby momma?

Which he did...what else because Biden has literally made zero new recommendations. He also said that Trump was overreacting and that his travel ban was ‚Äúhysteria and xenophobia.‚Äù  Biden also hasn‚Äôt left his home town in months. These are all documented facts.
He clearly said that Democrats POLITICIZING the virus was the new hoax. In the same speech he talks about the travel ban (that Biden called ‚Äúhysteria and xenophobia‚Äù) and developed a task force and put money into it BEFORE we lost a single person.

When Biden wins, Trump will immediately get on twitter stating the election was rigged and corrupt. He will then do a press conference stating the same and does not accept the results, and will sue. His final thing will be to not peacefully transfer power to Biden!
Sure but we can say that about 50% of Americans. My point being let's not get catty now. Biden will produce many opportunities to needlessly critique and this is what people hate about elections. He's done enough to criticize without stooping to this
Liar! At least Biden isn‚Äôt cheating and lying during the election! Character says a lot about a person! As a Christian, character, honesty, compassion and leadership mean a lot to me. Tearing people down is not what Jesus would ever do.

Joe Biden's decision to select a Black women for VP is totally racist and confirms his extreme pandering to the Black community. The percentage of Blacks to the U.S. population being around 13%, selecting a Black woman reduces the field to less than half of the black population.

Correction:  Joe Biden's handlers have reportedly selected his running mate.
Biden has a long history of mangled verbiage and that is what I saw in the comments about diversity more than anything else. I don't buy for a second that Biden is anything close to a racist. Plenty of black leaders in 1994 wanted that crime bill too.

despite all the plastic surgery biden has done the more I see him and pelosi the more they look related and they both say the same thing look at what I did, " I did it " all they have done is put their needs before America and The People vote them out
if biden was a real leader and has all these great ideas on how to rebuild our country then how come he's not working with the Republican's right now instead he wants to wait while this country suffers to get in office so he can so those famous words I did it

There is a distinction between their two current roles. Trump is the president, Biden is a candidate. Biden's job is to win the election. If his campaign believes that by having him interview, it helps, then it will happen.

The consensus seems to be that our system, as ideally inclusive, is severely flawed. It makes a difference to most progressives (like those in office) that Biden defeats Trump. Whatever-I-wantism is the Trump virus.
The White House is laying the groundwork to say that if Biden wins it's because the Chinese stole the election for him.

Good point. I feel as though it‚Äôs quite easy to earn my vote against trump tho. Also I don‚Äôt think that Biden has any incentive to move to the left
I didn‚Äôt elect Biden and Kamala. The democratic establishment shoved it down our thoats and now we have no other choice.
Me too. One guy I talked to for quite a while was pretty cool. I hope I at least got him thinking about some things. He was going to vote third-party. I shared all the reasons Biden shares my values and Trump does not. Who knows if I made a difference. Hopefully I did.
I was afraid too! This was my first night. Lots of nerves &amp; technical difficulties. But yes, one guy I talked to for quite a while was really nice, open to talking. He plans to vote third-party but thinks Trump is a great businessman. I shared the reasons I‚Äôm voting for Biden.
I mean, I hate Biden and Kamala with all my guts. They‚Äôre practically republican. But even 8 years of them is better than 4 more years of the hell Trump is carting is towards. Calling them out for old shitty policies won‚Äôt do anything because they are the establishment.

I've left a lot out of this rant. Don't shame people for how they vote or if they vote in this election. There's no correct answer. It's just another cycle of ghoulish establishment monsters backed by big corporations like always. I'm voting Biden and I'm incredibly ashamed.
I also think any talk of pushing Biden to the left is a completely nonsensical joke. He cannot give more than empty gestures toward the concept of healthcare as a human right, he's backed by corporate interests like every other candidate, he's racist, and he's a rapist, and more
I'm painfully aware of what it means to join forces with ghoulish conservatives to steal the throne, it happened in 16 and will likely continue to happen as the overton window shifts further to the right.  It's for this and more, that I can't possible imagine canvassing for Biden
Because of that, I can't help but feel guilty if the state turns red or continues purple. I feel like I'm being manipulated into voting for someone, now two someones, that I despise.  Biden is a perfect example of moderates sacrificing any values or positions to consolidate power
I've been stuck back and forth on voting Green or Biden this election for the past 4 months and I think I've reached a decision.   I'm currently registered to vote in Colorado which has had a complicated red/blue identity crisis for a while and is currently purple..

Looking forward to standing with all my ‚Äúnasty‚Äù women friends this fall and electing the Biden/Harris ticket - a start to a better future   #TgetherWeRise
Which is why I agree with you--it is necessary to push them both to be better. And I am optimistic that Harris can be pushed leftward, far moreso than Biden. She even had an M4A proposal! I hope she pushes Biden to support that kind of thing.
And I don't want to tear Harris down, but I am dismayed, constantly, that Biden and Harris occupy an ideological space that is, at best, orthogonal to my own, and that through them, the DNC is trying to secure a 12-year electoral dynasty with worryingly limited goals.
Here‚Äôs more about Biden‚Äôs climate policy. I need to read up on this. There‚Äôs stuff I like and stuff I don‚Äôt. I live in a state with an economy very dependent on fossil fuel production, and I‚Äôd like that to go away, but it has to be done right.
Part of Biden‚Äôs climate policy is to hire laid off fossil fuel workers to help cap abandoned wells that are leaking methane. I love this idea.
I'm not trying to be obtuse about this, but I have eviscerated Biden on here plenty, because he has a bad voting record on a lot of things! I'm a socialist, and I am going to be disappointed with anyone we nominate who isn't.
It doesn't seem as simple to me as simply promoting anti-capitalism in the discourse, because that's not a position that either Biden or Harris is going to pick up.
Agree. I discuss in my book how Biden was behind many horrible crime bills &amp; I don't buy the revisionist history of Harris as anticarceral.  But they are political creatures &amp; tough on crime isn't popular now.  I'll swallow the bitter pill bc the alternative is sickness &amp; death
Sadly, many of the Yang/Bernie  YT influencers have devolved into pouty-assed whiners instead of strategic thinkers. They likely haven't READ  Biden's platforms on healthcare + other policies, which, PS, they'd like FAR more than Trump's (who is currently working on gutting SS)

While not perfect on criminal justice, Kamala Harris sponsors the Green New Deal, backs a carbon fee and dividend, and focuses on environmental justice. We need this to prevent climate change from stealing society as we know it!
I can not support a pedophile in office. Flat out, i know logically he is the upper option. But morally i can not bring myself to support either of these candidates. I have no supportive evidence of my claim that biden is a pedophile just strong intuition based on some actions
If  can vote for Joe Biden then you can.
Just for receipts: I still think it's very likely that Trump will dump Pence &amp; pick Ivanka. Pence brings nothing to this off-the-rails sideshow &amp; you KNOW Trump cannot abide Biden getting credit for choosing a woman VP. He is gonna pick Ivanka, also because I think his plan is 1/
and just like after Biden took the primary lead, white liberal twitter is responding to anyone who raises legitimate concern over Kamala with ‚Äúwe just need to get Trump out!!!!! herstory is being written!!!!‚Äù

Perhaps not, because Biden already has the state locked up.
If they had chosen to back Bernie as nominee and then shoved Harris or another centrist onto the same ballot or even picked a more progressive running mate for Biden it could have united the party bc both sides would feel like their voices got heard.
The Trump administration is arguably the most aggressively and blindly pro-fossil fuels of any in modern American history. Thus the differences between the Biden+Harris v. Trump+Pence tickets on the climate crisis and fossil fuels are historically stark./4

Join us TODAY with  OIA's Senior Director of Sustainable Business Amy Horton and other  members as they discuss Biden's recently released climate plan:
You are correct. If Trump is elected they will no longer have a need to artificially prop up the financial system. If Biden is elected, they will make it crash to prove Republicans are better.
. is more aggressive on environmental and climate justice, the climate crisis and fossil fuels than is Biden. She introduced the Climate Equity Act with  Environmental Justice legislation with  supports a #GreenNewDeal and ban on #fracking.
Those were Biden‚Äôs admitted standards for a running mate. It‚Äôs not sexist or racist to call someone out for using race or sex as a disqualification for office.
You will do fine, but 98% of Americans will get nothing from Biden/Harris, and will continue to have any abundance extracted.  Other than the theatrics on the news, the actions of the administration will be indistinguishable from the Trump administration.
Jimmy Kimmel could find 10 people on the street, and not one of them would make a worse president than Trump, Biden, or Harris.

Wednesday's  front, by  Biden picks Harris.
I‚Äôm halfway expecting Biden to pledge that he‚Äôll be a 1-term President if elected, and start throwing arms around the Bernie Bros.
What're the odds the ticket isn't Romney/Haley in November? Polonium tea, heart troubles,  or just "you're not gonna have donnie trump to kick around any more," whatever excuse they need. The entire Biden campaign is build on running against Trump.  YHIHF
I'm going to urge my white followers especially to think about this because... DoJ under Trump has targeted trans folks; immigrants; indigenous; BIOPIC, people with disabilities   These are the constituencies DoJ needs to represent in a Biden administration is what I'm saying
Since Kamala Harris was named Joe Biden‚Äôs running mate people have been talking about Mike Pence and how he won‚Äôt be alone in a room with a female staff member because his wife wouldn‚Äôt like it or he couldn‚Äôt control himself around them or some weird ass thing. My question is,
I profiled Catherine Lhamon back in 2017 and she would be an *excellent* choice for any spot in the Biden administration
I am unclear what political strategy to unseat Trump you are advocating. Or is pointing out Biden/Harris flaws the end goal here?
Election eve 2008 I identified the Zionist Emmanuel heading his cabinet.    Canvassers knocked on my door repeatedly the next day, demanding that I VOTE.  I will not VOTE for Biden.  He picked Kamala   and I said he had to appoint Jesus if he wanted me to vote for him.  FAIL...
Yes. Not sure why the Speaker would be involved in any way. This becomes a law enforcement matter and either DC police or marshals would remove him on a court order. And in any case Biden gets all powers of presidency regardless of where he is.
I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate Donald Trump on Joe Biden's VP pick.
the one thing (singular) to learn from pandemics and brutality is fact (singular, thx TYT); if "we" don't think the Biden ticket has learned to the left we are seriously over-estimating ourselves as "#potential gurus" rather than "#potential progressives"
I don‚Äôt feed oxygen to that sort. The follower count may be high, but there‚Äôs a closely spaced set of circles in the Venn diagram of Bros, Bots, and Bad actors that like to feed this sort of division.  I‚Äôd bet 95% of Warren voters are all-in on Biden/Harris.
Behind Biden's "historic" decision... to try to convince a % of the population to vote for him that might not have otherwise.  In spite of Harris' going after Biden with fire a year ago.  Huh.  Oh.  Cause this was his best bet.
Okay so a Biden Attorney General is..... who?Get a Biden sign twice the size
4 of Biden and 4 of Kamala. Still not voting for them though. They didn't earn my vote, but I would rather Trump loses at the end of the day
After Biden becomes President Congress must make sure laws are in place that we don‚Äôt ever have a corrupt president like Trump who thinks he can do anything. Look at Post Office the pandemic stopping SSI and Medicaid and racist remarks  a abuse of power

hillary is so disliked &amp; not trusted she knows she can't be in the front running anymore. but she's still powerful which is why she's choreographed this thing, from biden to harris, from the start.  don't be surprised if joe drops out, harris becomes prez then makes hillary veep.

The DMVs are so backed up I may not have time to register to vote. We need help President Biden.
No doubt. And they keep doing it because they have faced no consequences. We can only hope when Biden wins that changes. For all of them.
It‚Äôs okay to criticize our fellow Democrats. Holding elected officials accountable shouldn‚Äôt be be partisan. If Kamala Harris is elected alongside Joe Biden this fall, we must hold her accountable for her record as a prosecutor in California.
So shall Joe Biden and Kamala Harris be voted in as President and Vice President. Come November 3,2020 Blue Wave is a Coming to clear the virus out of our white house and our country once and for all. See how it's done come November.
Obama was "You didn't build that," Biden is "I didn't write that."
And I don't care who they choose to be vice president I would like to have choices on my ballot not just Trump and Biden. I might even pencil in Mickey Mouse at least he is still a real American ü§£üòÇ
proof.  show us where biden said he's 'going to take all our guns'.  you can't.  you lie like your father.
If Biden doesn't win 2020, Swampy-donald duck-hitler WILL. I've gotta say Biden's not as bad as the criminal-in-charge now. 2024 WILL BE A DIFFERENT STORY!
someone needs to ask biden if he'll free julian assance, leonard peltier &amp; other political prisoners.
joe biden wants to defund the police and loves the Soviet Union? Sounds great to me, lmao
Interesting how the FAR RIGHT casually ignores this while locking in on the one totally debunked accusation against Biden isn't it?
Mr 'Grab 'em by the Pussy' has 25 claims of rape, including DNA evidence against him while also wishing GhislaineMaxwell  well -- but no let's focus on the totally fabricated and unsubstantiated claims against Biden only lol
Conveniently ignoring Trumps 25 SUBSTANTIATED claims of Rape are we? One with DNA evidence????  Biden's SINGLE accuser has been completely debunked and continuously changes her story.  You all are fabricating lies! #BidenHarris #Biden2020
A vote that's not for Biden is a vote for trump. Just a reminder.
Biden not capable, obviously. So have #CAMELa debate #POTUS45 . Or she not up to it either?
Judge Jeanine says she doesn't believe Biden will be on the ticket for some reason. I have been saying that 4 mos. I have had the feeling that Biden will claim sickness &amp; the party will insert MO &amp; HRC as candidates. I have to say Judge we seem to be on the same wave length.
It‚Äôs depressing listening to Trump every day. His presidency is nothing but about him. Forget Covid or anything else. In 2016 Trump degraded Fiona she was ugly. Rubio small hands Cruz his wife ugly too. Trump has his nerve to talk about Harris being mean to Biden. What a joke
just because i trash biden, do NOT take that to mean i support trump.  i hate both of those lying, disgusting sexual predators.
And where is the DNC or Biden?
Biden /Jarris-Heckle and Jeckle.
Biden/Harris. Best gift Democrat‚Äôs could give President Trump. LMAO
Defeating Trump in November will not lead to the defeat of fascism. The Republican Party will continue to move towards fascism, naturally pulling the Democratic Party to the right, if the Biden administration doesn't fundamentally change the system
Guess this works for biden now too üòÇüòúü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
question:  if something happened to biden that caused him to drop out before november...........what happens?  does the next candidate with the most votes (bernie) step in or does the dnc again install who they want?
mine is when she called biden a racist in the debates then kissed his ass for the vp.
Oh did biden buy  ?
Almost too impressive? Chance over overshadowing Biden?
Joe Biden is scheduled to make his first appearance with newly chosen running mate, Kamala Harris, during an event in Delaware this afternoon.
As a senator, Harris has been aligned with Biden on Israel: She is seen as a strong supporter with ties to AIPAC, the country‚Äôs largest pro-Israel lobby, and unlike some Democrats has not broached the idea of conditioning aid to Israel to influence its policies.   DEAL BREAKER!
how many times were we told 'we don't need you'? how many times were we trashed &amp; insulted?  NOW they say we have to support biden-harris??  yeah, well, whoever says we have to can go fuck themselves.
net worth of biden:    11 million  net worth of harris:       6 million  just saying.
Sadly Biden barely has enough mental capacity to hold a conversation let alone run a country. The Democratic Party has kept the minority in poverty for a very long time I wish they would do their research and not depend on cnn or major news outlets for information.
you're working on the premise that things will change &amp; get better with biden.  that's the flaw.  both sides work for corporations.
the dnc rigging 2 elections is NOT democracy.  NOT representing what the majority of people want ie med4all, is NOT democracy.  we seem 2 have different definitions of democracy.  biden will fill cabinet posts w/goldman sachs &amp; billionaires .  BOTH parties love their oligarchs.
i'm not a harris fan, but she'll eat him alive.  likewise, trump will wipe the floor with biden.  what choices...ugh.....
while i appreciate your freedom of choice, i do not believe biden will move america in the direction we need. no med4all &amp; his obsession with cutting ss.  i can't believe in all the people in america it comes down to the 2 most crappy choices.  just can't go there-voting green.

This is the best thing you‚Äôve done so far President Biden.
sorry bernie, i supported you from 2016 on.  but i will NOT vote for either trump or biden.  both are liars, sexual predators &amp; NOT progressive.  i'm voting green.  the dnc played this....they can live with it!

I'm so glad that I don't live in a swing state and can vote for an actual progressive ticket without affecting Biden's chances.

Never forget and go after Pres. Biden like hell until he relents or his VP takes the reigns.
Biden can't win. What we really need is enough dialogue and inclusive politics to find  a spot on the Trump administration.
Why do u continue ro let Trump go on and on and he is lying about Biden.. Obama has a good health program and Trump has been trying to destroying since day one. Mail in ballots work good because we do it in Colorado.  No problems
He should debate ! Biden show the nation that you are capable of dealing with other leaders of the world without your wife talking for you.
it will go exactly how the last 50 years of his life have gone..lie bully cheat sue sue sue threaten bully  block deflect blame steal cheat lie lie cheat sue sue etc. but in the end  JOE BIDEN WILL BE OUR PRESIDENT. WE JUST HAVE TO PREPARE FOR A MARATHON OF OFFENSES AND ASSAULTS
Lol, hope you're ready for another term. Biden can't win.
Far more than that are against Biden.
The latest intelligence assessment reflects concerns not only about Russia, but China and Iran as well, warning that hostile foreign actors may seek to compromise election infrastructure, interfere with the voting process or call results into question.
biden is a rude, sick mf!
Didnt see Biden in the mix
Biden is really that dumb isn‚Äôt he!
Biden also said he would no longer allow the federal government to confiscate land for the purpose of erecting a border wall, and that all lawsuits between landowners and the government would be dropped.
So are these biden videos an attempt to make him look like an average joe or the campaigns attempt to have him off himself?

Why do you think they keep dumbing people down into believing they have the Holy Spirit, when they don't? Why do you think they created all these distractions, and built a nation that contradicts scripture. Donald Trump, and Joe Biden aren't even real people.
what's with biden?  is he trying to out-orange the orange moron in chief?
I would like to hear you Mr Biden and other leading Democrats urge voters to contact the local elections office &amp; get absentee ballots now! The Republicans own the absentee ballots system and that's why they're against all inclusive mail-in voting during the pandemic! #DumpTrump!
If Biden loses to Trump in the general, that will be absolutely pathetic. Trump's response to the pandemic has been Hoover-level bad. Unfortunately, the Dem establishment would take a Biden loss as, "well, if he couldn't have defeated Trump, no one could have!" We're screwed üôÉ
There are two candidates: trump or Biden. If your vote for Biden  is dependent upon his pick for VP you have shown yourself.  This is a privileged mindset.
In handcuffs maybe?? Then Biden can say "This AMERICAN CARNAGE STOPS RIGHT NOW" as part of his speech?
The problem with Biden is, he can't call out Trump on this issue because he's leaning into picking Susan Rice for his VP!
Really didn‚Äôt find anything wrong what Biden said when you compare what Trump has said about every race. Gosh making to much of it
anyone who is comparing biden to fdr is either brain dead or....................that's it.  brain dead.Harrrr Is a Great Role Model for little brown &amp; black girls as Biden said.

Tragic these rules went into effect. Share your ideas too!  Biden et al must reverse this  day one when in office. Universities must hold bad actors accountable for bad behavior vs relying on weak policies like these. Never hire bad actors (see Sutton). Use our voices!
Biden has no clue about the virus nor doesHarris. Both have been on the sidelines attacking Trump constantly abot something they know nothing about. Frm the beginningTrump has faced every challenge/solved problems. Laughable Joe could step in &amp; eradicate it immediately.MagicWand?
He will. Biden knows he is a misogynistic, corrupt, criminal liar. It is what it is
President a Trump loves our country &amp; this is one example.  Joe Biden in 47 yrs made himself &amp; his family wealthy by ripping off the country.  The choice to lead the country is obvious.
I've lived in NY and they would never endorse Biden. They are thugs, everyone there hates them
There is a distinction between their two current roles. Trump is the president, Biden is a candidate. Biden's job is to win the election. If his campaign believes that by having him interview, it helps, then it will happen.
I think the so called shaming is vs people who revenge vote. Bernie Bros are all saying they'll vote Trmp, not because they like him, but because Biden got the nom over Bernie
So my pendulum is swinging towards Biden, (sorry Tara) BUT not entirely. He &amp; Kamala need to EARN my vote. My world has been rocked.. and rolled over. Where the fuck is congress RN? America needs your help. November is coming &amp; your job may be gone. My husband‚Äôs is... #twocents

I'm very much not a Biden/Harris fan (they're awful on the few issues that Dems and Libertarians often share common ground on), but I do see a Trump reelection as a systemic risk to our civilization. I wish we had RCV here in CO, that would make this decision trivially easy.

Don't confuse democrats; lawful, rational, voting citizens like me, with rioters.  There's a chance the rioters might vote for Biden but I'm guessing they are disconnected from society to the extent they won't vote at all.  Nobody is courting them for support; we don't need them.

Finally, we get represented!
After Trump decimates Biden in one debate, let Trump debate Harris!  He‚Äôll take them both down!  He‚Äôs been working his arse off 4 years &amp; I guarantee Trump knows all the answers.  Biden&amp; Harris have been on the sidelines demonizing him... and have no idea what‚Äôs going on.
It wouldn‚Äôt be Biden, that‚Äôs for sure.  Trump works constantly - never stops. They even criticize him when he plays a round of golf!
So funny that now you‚Äôre saying about Trump exactly what we KNOW about Biden.
So screw the debates &amp; the rest of the campaigns - just move Biden into the White House &amp; get it over with, right?  That‚Äôs how dumb &amp; corrupt a democrat is.  Screw elections, just get on with the Marxism!
Trump will destroy Biden in a debate.
Couldn‚Äôt be that Trump will clean Biden‚Äôs clock in The debates, huh? BTW the American people will never elect senile Joe Biden/Harris &amp; take the country into Socialism.  They can sequester Biden to try to protect him but the American don‚Äôt buy it. Trump by a landslide.

This suburban housewife would be thrilled to have affordable housing in my neighborhood! I'm running for town board to help make it happen. Oh - and I would walk over burning coals to vote for Biden.üíÅ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
Joe Biden and Kamala Harris came over last night and forced me to billet an entire caravan of Central Americans, and they turned my shower to drip mode.
May every single one of our nasty women tribe vote for Biden-Harris 2020!
I'm Irish pasty white, live in the burbs and I'm voting Biden/Harris. I would love more affordable housing for my community
Funny. Myself and my suburban pals are all voting for Biden. We actually despise you. And affordable housing is a great thing. Why shouldn't the person making my coffee live near me?
'I think it's great' ‚Äì Wall Street execs are glad that Biden picked Harris
Joe Biden is in the early stages of dementia.  So there‚Äôs that.
Biden can‚Äôt even read a sentence on a teleprompter, but he will unite &amp; heal us &amp; restore our soul!  You‚Äôve gotta be kidding!
Biden is their puppet.
I helped progressive friends of mine during the Obama transition try to make the case for commercial crew/cargo, advanced technology development, and propellant depots, and I'm sure I could work with those groups again if Biden/Harris win in November.
If they won, I would be happy we dodged the bullet of a second Trump term, but wouldn't be super happy about what Biden and Harris would do, especially if they flip the Senate. But I'd also probably be able to work with them and find occasional common ground.
So I guess in some way's I'm actually in the "meh" category. I think for all her faults, she and Joe are at least basically decent human beings, and if CO narrows a bit from Biden's current 13pt lead vs Trump, I could see myself plugging my nose hard enough to vote for them.
But as discouraging as her and Joe Biden's records are on criminal justice issues, somehow Trump and Pence have found a way to be even worse. I could never see today's Biden or Harris encouraging police violence or shielding cops from accountability like Trump would.
I mean, I don't see her as being much worse than Biden or Gore, or frankly much worse than Bill Clinton or Obama. For issues I care about like criminal justice reform, I'm not happy with her record and I'd be less skeptical of her if she'd own her past mistakes as a prosecutor.
Behind Biden's "historic" decision... to try to convince a % of the population to vote for him that might not have otherwise.  In spite of Harris' going after Biden with fire a year ago.  Huh.  Oh.  Cause this was his best bet.
Obama on Harris as VP: 'Joe Biden nailed this decision'
I agree. Bernie should have been the nominee; then there was this stupid shift around super-Tuesday.   Yes, we could all do it.  I just don't know how to reach people. Problem is, most folks are I know are already with Biden. And they largely don't care to push for anything else.
My plan is to drop off my mail vote at the dropbox maybe a week before the election. It's unlikely polls will move massively in the last week since a lot of people will likely vote early. If things are tightening (ie &lt;6-8pt lead) I'll seriously consider voting Biden/Harris.
Hmm.  You are the only one who says that you will keep POC out of the suburbs, that will protect slave owners statues, and says BLM are terrorists.  So, I don‚Äôt think people will believe you on Joe Biden.
Had to break it to you but I never said I wanted Biden to lose
Biden has been out and about following social distancing protocol. God I can‚Äôt wait for the debates to start.
Trump would have tweeted that Karen Bass was a dog.  He didn‚Äôt really know her, maybe she brought coffee or something.  Joe Biden called her, like an adult, and a man who cares about America.
I‚Äôm in. Great Pick Joe Biden.
You worry about the NY AG. The 2nd A is not going anywhere. #Biden/Harris2020
I'm not in for it. There was almost zero chance of Biden getting my vote, but still. This guaranteed it's just another year of voting green for me. My vote's a protest vote that has (hopefully) enough voters behind it to be noticed. That's important to me. Forever optimisticüôÇ
I donated. August fund raising for Biden will be through the roof.
Oh, am I going to enjoy how they‚Äôll kick your ass, Donnie. You‚Äôll be humiliated and I hope you live long enough to suffer from jail for all you‚Äôve done right after Biden takes over
I'm trying to figure this one out too.  Not that I'll be heartbroken merely if Biden loses... I'll be heartbroken only if either Trump or Biden wins, so it's kinda inevitable at this point.
So, I came home today from spending a day with schizophrenic friend (seriously!)  And see that Kamala Harris is Biden's vp pick.  Feels like I never left my schizophrenic friend‚òπÔ∏è
Biden just lost any chance of becoming President She is widely unliked by people on both sides
God fucking no. There wasn't much chance of my voting Biden anyway, but this certainly didn't help him. And I mean that beyond with folks like me... look where Harris polled before she dropped. She didn't excite ANYBODY, even the demographic she was "supposed" to excite. So...
We will all be celebrating for the first time since you screwed up our lives. #Biden/Harris. But enjoy your pity party
Yes. Now you can vote for that man in the White House.  We are fighting for our country. Vote Biden/Harris!
I'm a registered Libertarian, but depending on how close the presidential race is in Colorado, I'm willing to plug my nose and vote Biden/Harris. They may be lousy in many of the few areas that Dems are sometimes good at (immigration, CJR, militarism), but Trump is uniquely awful
Now we know who picked her!  Beware!  Evil Soros hand picked Kamala for VP - Biden is an empty vessel.  Be very afraid, Patriots!   Vote Red!  Our country will be gone if we elect these anti-American Marxists.
You didn‚Äôt pick Harris; she was picked for you!  She was a vicious disgrace trying to demonize Judge Kavanaugh at his hearing &amp; many of us will never forget her vile interrogation of him.  Biden/Harris is the worst presidential ticket we‚Äôve ever seen.  Where‚Äôs Hunter?
Biden/Harris 2020: Get Bus...ted.
Harris vs Pence on stage. It will be historic. Biden vs Trump on stage will be a massacre.
It‚Äôs kind of comical that Harris called Biden a racist, demanded an apology, never got it, yet is now his running mate...
I actually feel a little hope creeping in. #Biden/Harris2020
Make no mistake, Kamala Harris is the real presidential candidate. If elected Joe Biden will not make it past 2/1/2021 before he is declared mentally unfit, and replaced by her. This is a bait and switch like no other.
And Biden won't become president til 2021.
You are a class act, Ambassador. I know that you will play a prominent role in the Biden administration. Let's Go!
I am too Anna. Joe Biden is an honorable man of integrity and empathy.
And just like that trumpies try to make Biden look as bad as Trump.  This will never happen; Trump has waay too much baggage, too many accusations, too many payoffs, too many divorces and too many human failures.  #MeToo is alive and well, thankfully.
I bet Biden‚Äôs binders are thicker than Mitt‚Äôs were.
You mean VP pick has been revealed to Biden by his top staff of course.
You have absolutely nothing.  All you can do is try to tear down Biden, because you can't run on the disastrous results of the last 3 1/2 years.  Can't wait until you're gone, and the SDNY puts 45 behind bars.  Lock him up!!
And if ‚Å¶ wins, we‚Äôll have to learn Russian.  Trump says Americans will have to learn Chinese if Biden wins but offers little condemnation of Beijing - CNNPolitics
What else is new?  It's been this way since the late ‚Äò80s.  I'm rooting for Harris.  She'd make a great president if Biden were to be incapacitated.
You interpret Biden's actions as sexual.  I think they're more misplaced grandfatherly affection; not necessarily sexual.  Agree it's weird and gross, but he's not Trump with huge amounts of sexual baggage that trumpies choose to ignore.
I disagree.  There is no evidence he ever did anything sexual.  You perpetuate this false narrative.  Your cult leader did say ‚ÄúIn 10 years I'll be dating her.  Can you believe it?‚Äù.  20+ allegations of sexual assault against Trump and you perpetuate this lie about Biden.
I don't excuse it.  I think it's creepy.  I am disappointed in the DNC's selection.  I‚Äôm not voting for Biden as much as voting against Trump who is 1000x worse.  As usual it's the choice of the lesser of 2 evils.
Those videos show Biden sniffing hair, that's all.  I agree it's weird but one could make a credible case for grandfatherly affection in all cases.  Nobody has filed suit although I think a couple said it was awkward.  Contrast this with 20+ allegations against Trump.
We need Florida to send Joe Biden their electoral college votes in November.
Trump also suggesting that men will feel insulted by a woman VP. That should win over the women suburban vote.
If Trump stays in office you‚Äòll almost assuredly lose your right to choose. If Kasich is willing to go against his personal beliefs to endorse Biden &amp; reclaim America from the grips of the Trump administration (ensuring a pro-choice replacement for RBG) ‚Äî why are you against it?
The entire Biden Family is corrupt &amp; they‚Äôre eager for Joe to be President so they all can enrich themselves for another 4 yrs.
OMG. And he says Biden is in cognitive decline...  #trump #gop #maga #election2020 #voteblue2020 #rememberinnovember  VOTE BLUE.
I will vote for Biden. I like all his possible VP picks.  Even if he pulls someone I have never heard of out of a hat. I will like her too. ‚ù§Ô∏è
Biden has always been a Liar.

Biden can‚Äôt support his own train of thought for more than a few minutes. I‚Äôm not saying he‚Äôs too old to be president, but I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs all mentally there enough to take on such a large responsibility as being the president of the United States of a America.
What I am really, really looking forward to is the first thing President Biden says that triggers Republicans.
If you think #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica will work, given Biden...  I've many bridges to sell you.
To be clear, the entire world prefers Joe Biden. It will be a safer place
thanks for stumpin for Biden!! Woohoo
#TrumpCantRideABike  Joe Biden just destroyed one of Trump's biggest attack lines (opinion) - CNN
Well said.  Trump is the best President we‚Äôve ever had bc he truly cares about the country &amp; ALL Americans!  He gets no respect from the msm or Left but works tirelessly for us &amp; will defeat the hapless Biden in Nov. Biden would widen the swamp that Trump is draining.

I'll put the check in the mail after my vote for Biden is secured
Seen Biden on a bike yesterdys, and then this:
I don't believe either candidate is suffering from dementia. Internet memes provide scant to zero evidence. Now if you want to compare their health, Biden is clearly more healthy than Trump:
I think it's a byproduct of his anti dementia drugs, along w the tardive dyskinesia. You know they're attacking Biden because of Trmp's dementia. Everything he does is projection
He's a more immediate danger--but the Dem collusion with endless wars keeps us in perpetual danger as well.  Get the codes out of 45's inside pocket and then fight Pres Biden at every turn until he fights for the lives of the 90%.

I agree it's a precarious situation. Biden sounding like a 78 yo white man when he talks about race doesn't help. But I'd hope that people will give the selection a chance to demonstrate her commitment to the "cause' before dismissing outright if she is not black.

I'm half Sicilian. I figure that has to make me at least 1/8 black. But I'm all in on Biden.
Fingers crossed for a somewhat inspirational VP pick. Biden just needs to avoid talking about race, except for when policy relates to it. He sounds like any 78 year old white man sounds when talking about black people- which is.... not good.
Why would anyone even think this?  Can somebody defend this position or are her marbles just as loose as Joe Biden?

This is my only hesitation with governor Whitmer as Biden's running mate. Michigan has been through so much and she seems to be a great governor. However, my impression is that you also have a solid Lt. governor who would follow in her footsteps.All Biden‚Äôs supporters aren‚Äôt pedophiles but they have decided it‚Äôs not a deal breaker.
Great! Biden can haul in what, 25+ that trump sexually assaulted, I‚Äôm sure Stormy would be happy to show up

Biden says he‚Äôll veto M4A EVEN if it passed Congress. Yet you think voting in progressives, which you admit will be a slow process, &amp; we have seen Dems will fight harder than they ever fought Trump, so it passes Congress will change his mind when 88% of Dems supporting it doesn‚Äôt
Yes, without Biden apologists. Liberals are not the left. Have a good night.
She endorsed Biden when Bernie was still in the race.
I‚Äôm not worried at all for either. Harris is going to chew Pence up and spit him out. I will guarantee you this though, Trump will not stalk Biden like he did Hillary, Biden‚Äôs from Scranton, he‚Äôs still a scrappy dude
The swamp, that's rich. He's put unqualified folk that donated money in positions of power. Devoss is clueless. And what about the unprecedented turnover and unfilled positions?  Imperfect, and yet this started with how Biden is "Imperfect". The mental gymnastics from you üôÑ
NO !  Trump canattackJor Biden's weaknesses which are many,  here's one.
She was acting like a prosecutor making an argument   Biden seems to understand
Biden's grades in class. Repeated 3rd grade, earned all C's and D's in 1st 3 semesters at University of Del. Made a whopping A in P.E. a B in English Writers and an F in ROTC and graduated 76th at Syracuse Law in 85. I had a way better GPA, maybe I should run. lol. Unbelievable.
starting to hope they actually do let Biden debate Trump just so we can get some more gaffe compilation videos
You destroyed 174,000 American lives &amp; the vibrant economy Obama &amp; Biden left in your hands. Yet like everything else you inherit, you've run America into the dirt, &amp; spent more than a full year &amp; $130M on taxpayer funded golfing trips that YOU profited from.
The Dem Party pours $ into fighting/preventing progressives as much as they can. I support all progressive candidates available, but the party fights tooth &amp; nail. We‚Äôre slowly building progressives in Congress despite the party‚Äôs best efforts. Biden won‚Äôt be forced after he wins
Biden can't interfere, right? That's one of my biggest concerns w/ him - kumbaya  days are long over. It will begin w/ DOJ , I hope. No pardons. No deals.
we knew you were cooking up this nonsense. whatever.   BIDEN 2020!
Ummm...Biden ain't winning.   Dems committed political malpractice with this ticket.  He shouldn't win. The put up a guy with severe cognitive issues. It's ridiculous.
81 days until we re-elect the most America loving, NON politician to be  f/four more years. Jobs. Security. Peace in the Middle East. Bringing troops home. Defeated ISIS. Killed Terrorists. Takes on China. IRAN. NOKO.... Obama/Biden committed Treason. That's a nightmare.
I mean, you‚Äôre making my point. Dems ARE in a position to effect change, they CHOOSE not to, why keep supporting them? Also, Biden said it himself. Now, he does have a long history of outright lying (like Trump), so I understand why taking his own word is risky, but still.
Look up his record of success focused on ALL Americans Ms. Swift. Lowest unemployment f/All Americans. Funded historic black colleges, criminal justice reform and so much more.  Biden. Harris.  Phonies. Corrupt Marxists.  Your statements are worthless. Uneducated. Factless.
So you played golf and bashed Biden while your brother was dying. You are an amazing piece of sh*t. Man am I glad I am no relation to you! Bless Robert. So sorry for his passing. üôè
What a tragic and ignorant rant.  Look up President Trump's policies.  All have been good for America after decades of corrupt politicians and 8 years of the traitors Obama/Biden admin who spied on his campaign &amp; attempted a coup d'erat.

American that vote for Biden you will vote for a not American citizen like Kamara lol

Biden is an equal roadblock, he literally said he‚Äôd veto M4A even if Congress passed it. Dems voted FOR Trump‚Äôs budgets, surveillance powers, judges, Space Force, impeached ONLY on conspiracy against Biden. I‚Äôll give them down ballot votes, chance to prove themselves in Congress
What's this analysis based on? Why would a Biden presidency return more on ave than historical averages? Also a major factor is which party  takes the Senate..What party does the writer affiliate with??
I pray no one votes till after first debate get Biden to do at least one debate now
That has nothing to do with biden though

Same goes for Biden.
I am proud that we have such a great breadth of Democratic leaders.  The candidates who ran against Biden, all of the women who were considered for VP, our honestly impressive Congress people.  They have Trump.  The rest of the GOP went to sleep.
Can Joe Biden "Thread the Needle" Among Democrats?
A Snowden pardon would be wonderful. What can Biden offer in response for the progressives in his party?
Sanders EARNED delegates for the convention. Biden also won more delegates. The convention is where the nominee becomes official. Don‚Äôt worry. You‚Äôll get your crappy centrist candidate &amp; a platform that doesn‚Äôt include M4A, despite these votes. They still earned a voice there.

Sounds like he's endorsing Biden.
I do not support rapist, racist war mongers, which is why I am just as likely to vote trump as I am biden. How about you try building an argument FOR your candidate, instead of against the other one.
Actually, he is more favored to win then against Hillary. His favorability is higher than Obama at this stage in his presidency.  Liberals are lurching too far left. People will begrudgingly vote Trump in order to not have Biden.

we don't care if she had botched her presidential run.  Biden won.  ALL the other candidates lost. we are thrilled at the ticket.  they compliment each other.  and they will be the next president and vice president of the US.
I confess I'm torn. A big part of me wants the Republicans to keep the Senate to check a Biden presidency. But a big part of me wants to see a total reset of the Republican Party. Every possible outcome is largely bad. And anyway the outcome doesn't depend on what I think.
It's not as simple as "just elect Democrats". That's a good place to start. But we can't make the mistake of folding up shop &amp; going home after the election is over: that's where the hardest work begins.

Joe Biden is absolutely correct. Pendley has no business being in charge of Colorado's public lands, and yet Trump still has this anti-public zealot in the building "to lead the Bureau of Land Management".  Why won't  speak out against this guy? #copolitics #cosen
I will grant you that a majority of people who identify as liberals ..sadly myself included, only complain when It is a Republican (is Trump really a real Republican??!) It's a serious concern for me as We get closer to the election, that if Biden wins we won't complain as much.

Acosta, have you ever asked Biden a question? You are not a journalist. You hate Conservatives with a passion. You are not a Cuban American but a Fidelito ass kisser.
FYI: Trump just handed Biden/Harris a golden goose on a silver platter when he tried to destroy the USPS. No matter your political affiliation millions of Americans and businesses depend on the USPS and they will protest against this to the ninth degree.
This is the best argument I've heard. Basically we are voting for who we want to fight. Do you want to fight against Trump or fight against Biden. The claim is it's easier to fight with Biden than it is with Trump. And if Biden wins his supporters will realize nothing has changed
I wouldn't leave Biden to walk my dog. The guy isn't fit for the job.
#BidenHarrisLandslide2020    tweet 2 4) a VP who is left of the progressive squad (AOC, Omar, etc) which means she is w Bernie Sanders, green new deal, socialism/marxism 4) a VP who called Biden a racist at the Dem primary debates yet magically has decided he's now ok No thanks!

He is like a gnat swarming ...  Biden will just wave him away.
Giving Biden a heads-up, isn't the smartest tactic, imo.
No amount of Trump being bad makes Biden any better. They are both horrible picks for leadership and the public keeps allowing it to happen by voting for it. A 3rd party can win if people were smart enough to vote for them. That‚Äôs the only way we fix it.
If you slander Trump, and the police, you are supporting Biden like it or not.

More on mask madness: Biden is asking every American to wear mask while outside for the next 3 months making it a condition for full reopening of the country &amp; calling it a "patriotic" act:  How did we get to this NONSENSE from here?
I've been thinking the same thing. I think it does more harm to Trump than Biden.
...that's a list of polls showing Biden competitive in Iowa.
They know it's their best chance for continued injustice. Biden may not be in favor of defunding the police but that administration will be way more apt to hold cops accountable for misdeeds.
I disagree with Trump. I also disagree with  decision to run an unqualified corrupt criminal who establishment dems think has name value over Andrew Romanoff. I will vote for Biden/Harris. But I will not sell out my values and beliefs to vote for a puppet like Hickenlooper...

My first question when Biden named Harris as his running mate was, "What's her position on abortion?" That's not the issue that determines my vote, but I know many pro-life people that give that issue the most weight.

Trump will have a sizable margin over senile r****d segregationist biden, but it's helpful if we remember that it hinges on us, and if we don't turn out, we could lose.
Harris, then Biden actually. I grew up inside the beltway, know what the data says, and you have to be delusional to think anybody is going back to working with the ku klux GOP. Hating Bernie isn't anything to Clinton voters who are suffering because of "bipartisan" nonsense.

Kamala Harris in debates - joe Biden sexually assaults women and is a racist.  Now - I fully support Joe Biden who sexually assaults women and is a racist.
Excellent point. By choosing Biden/Harris he has shown Trump/Pence that he is no friend of theirs. Huge mistake by Leo. I thought he had more political savvy than to pick a winner in the US. He also is too chummy with the Chinese Communists. Another bad decision.

I don‚Äôt know how to say this but your late to the party, we already know this but I‚Äôm ready to see Trump in an orange jumpsuit. And ready to push Biden hard. We need to keep up the energy and direct it to the Democratic Party once we flip this shit.
The nasty memes of Harris began the moment Biden picked her to be his running mate.  This ad targets people in their mid-thirties. It hits Trump hard because it is exactly who he is.
Biden also openly called for the arrest of anarchists. I agree with your assessment, the democrats are 2016 Republicans. They just are not loud and crude.
They only impeached him for going after biden. They had no mention of the crimes he has committed. If they really wanted to impeach AND remove him, they would've made a case with teeth.

Joe Biden would be a fool to reject a continuation of an arms embargo against the rat like Iranian regime.
I don't see how he can debate. The Biden team will surely think of some confrontations that are new and unexpected.

Reason # I lost count, to not vote for Biden
I‚Äôm not sure why you feel that way.  Biden has moved left since winning the nomination, endorsing the Green New Deal, for one.
I see more of a problem with the USPS endorsing Joe Biden with Democrats pushing for mail-in voting. You, of course, you miss the seriousness and significance of that.
We will know. It will be Joe Biden
You don't know about Harris' record in California? Locking up poor POC and never going after billionaires?  Biden/Harris won't be any better than Trump. On the contrary, it will put sociopath Harris in power for 8-12 years.

To date, are only promises with the aim of winning an election.  Perhaps Biden will flee from the Ukrainian public prosecutor in the presidency? I don't know, but I've learned not to blindly believe what a politician promises!
I'm also not sure if the whole world will see Biden winning as a victory.  They still see him as a war monger that believes in American exceptionalism.  They also talked about his incompetency and failing health during the primaries...they thought of him as big of a joke as Trump

I mean, you‚Äôre making my point. Dems ARE in a position to effect change, they CHOOSE not to, why keep supporting them? Also, Biden said it himself. Now, he does have a long history of outright lying (like Trump), so I understand why taking his own word is risky, but still.
Look up his record of success focused on ALL Americans Ms. Swift. Lowest unemployment f/All Americans. Funded historic black colleges, criminal justice reform and so much more.  Biden. Harris.  Phonies. Corrupt Marxists.  Your statements are worthless. Uneducated. Factless.

Biden got no shot #qanon
Trump and Clinton are known adulterers with ties to a child rapist; Biden is/has neither.
lmao Biden? Who was accused by one woman that turned out to be a serial liar?
By not voting for Trump (a vote for Biden), not voting for Biden (a vote for Trump), and then voting 3rd party, you actually get 3 votes. I feel very smart knowing this.
Every politician gets at least 127,853 accusations every week minimum. It should be looked into but innocent till proven guilty. Even Biden.
Good Lord STOP embarrassing yourself.  This is VERY uncomfortable for the people who know how you achieved your position in government. You are not qualified to be there. Just like Biden. We all know this. That is all.
Nothing I hate more than identity politics----it's the #DemocraticParty's biggest weakness.....Just another reason I left the party after 2016---I follow policy.....speaking of, if Joe Biden promised to pardon Julian Assange and Edward Snowden of any crimes, I would vote for him.

International students will avoid the US for at least the next 3 years even if Biden is elected. The numbers will dwindle significantly if Trump is re-elected. Those numbers won't rebound. So much MONEY lost. How do I know? I worked with international students. They spend $$$
In doing a little more checking, I can find at least 3 Popes that Biden was blessed to meet.  For a man you don't seem to think is Catholic, that's a pretty good track record.
If all goes well and Biden gets elected, do you have a plan for how conservatives can return to a functioning party willing to compromise and govern for the good of the people? I value your opinion but I see many never trumpers holding on to their intransigence.

Win this election, John! We have to flip the Senate! I have sent money and will send more! In October, when I get my ballot, I will vote for you and Biden/Harris immediately within a day and place it in the local drop-off box! I am advising everyone to do the same!
Sounds like he's endorsing Biden.
I do not support rapist, racist war mongers, which is why I am just as likely to vote trump as I am biden. How about you try building an argument FOR your candidate, instead of against the other one.
Actually, he is more favored to win then against Hillary. His favorability is higher than Obama at this stage in his presidency.  Liberals are lurching too far left. People will begrudgingly vote Trump in order to not have Biden.

we don't care if she had botched her presidential run.  Biden won.  ALL the other candidates lost. we are thrilled at the ticket.  they compliment each other.  and they will be the next president and vice president of the US.
I confess I'm torn. A big part of me wants the Republicans to keep the Senate to check a Biden presidency. But a big part of me wants to see a total reset of the Republican Party. Every possible outcome is largely bad. And anyway the outcome doesn't depend on what I think.
It's not as simple as "just elect Democrats". That's a good place to start. But we can't make the mistake of folding up shop &amp; going home after the election is over: that's where the hardest work begins.

Joe Biden is absolutely correct. Pendley has no business being in charge of Colorado's public lands, and yet Trump still has this anti-public zealot in the building "to lead the Bureau of Land Management".  Why won't  speak out against this guy? #copolitics #cosen
I will grant you that a majority of people who identify as liberals ..sadly myself included, only complain when It is a Republican (is Trump really a real Republican??!) It's a serious concern for me as We get closer to the election, that if Biden wins we won't complain as much.
Amen. And, Biden should not interfere. No pardons. No deals.

FYI: Trump just handed Biden/Harris a golden goose on a silver platter when he tried to destroy the USPS. No matter your political affiliation millions of Americans and businesses depend on the USPS and they will protest against this to the ninth degree.
This is the best argument I've heard. Basically we are voting for who we want to fight. Do you want to fight against Trump or fight against Biden. The claim is it's easier to fight with Biden than it is with Trump. And if Biden wins his supporters will realize nothing has changed

Giving Biden a heads-up, isn't the smartest tactic, imo.
No amount of Trump being bad makes Biden any better. They are both horrible picks for leadership and the public keeps allowing it to happen by voting for it. A 3rd party can win if people were smart enough to vote for them. That‚Äôs the only way we fix it.

They know it's their best chance for continued injustice. Biden may not be in favor of defunding the police but that administration will be way more apt to hold cops accountable for misdeeds.

Harris, then Biden actually. I grew up inside the beltway, know what the data says, and you have to be delusional to think anybody is going back to working with the ku klux GOP. Hating Bernie isn't anything to Clinton voters who are suffering because of "bipartisan" nonsense.

Kamala Harris in debates - joe Biden sexually assaults women and is a racist.  Now - I fully support Joe Biden who sexually assaults women and is a racist.
Excellent point. By choosing Biden/Harris he has shown Trump/Pence that he is no friend of theirs. Huge mistake by Leo. I thought he had more political savvy than to pick a winner in the US. He also is too chummy with the Chinese Communists. Another bad decision.

I see a lot of mfs talking mad shit about Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, and all I can say is if you believe they ain‚Äôt doing shit right, then you yourself should personally get involved in politics and be the change you wanna see instead of bitching 24/7.

The point is we will again under Trump. Under Biden, not so much.
No. No it doesn't, at all! What does seem odd is that Trump refuses to release his taxes b/c he actually has something, or multiple things to hide. Instead of trying to invent a Biden crime, investigate the man who's committed them for decades.(Verifiable)
So China wants to see  win election! So! I imagine EVERY world leader who's had to deal with, coordinate with or even meet with Trump wants Biden to win b/c it doesn't take long to realize that Trump has NO IDEA what he's doing! Incompetence is easily spotted!

Joe Biden is prohibited from going on News Shows. His handlers are afraid people will see the real Joe Biden. They rather put his wife out there for him.

So b/c you're a "stable genius" you 100% KNOW that you're going to lose the election, BADLY! So, you think if you get destroyed by Biden/Harris you can claim fraud. Even then you're NOT GOING TO WIN, so just resign now &amp; stop making yourself look so stupid!
Tensions linger between Biden and Obama camps throughout 2020 primary campaign: report   Obama always had his problems with Biden but is playing the game of the Democrats and keeping his mouth shut!!
Biden is incapable of answering questions. He can't get through them without losing his temper and his handlers know it. If they could hide him in the basement until the election that's what they would do. He's simply incompetent.

We can sit around and talk "what about ___" all day. But there is no perfect candidate who can serve every facet of social and political justice the way we'd like them to. So we have to start somewhere. Would you rather start with Biden/Harris?  3/?

Hmmm... Biden literally called Trump a few months ago and told him what to do. Oh and he and Obama left him a book telling him what to do
this is exactly the kind of flip-flopping trump is going to pounce on as we get closer to the election - he'll claim that he cares more about black lives than the dem nominees. biden and harris have awful records, and suddenly trying to pretend they don't is a total joke/mistake.
NOT a concerned about being thrown in jail.  You know, the same can't be said about you! Your father &amp; Pence are so SCREWED! I mean they can't spell the 5 letter words Biden &amp; Kamala use regularly. Brains vs ignorance. Its going to be a massacre that you can't not watch!

Biden won the nom¬≠i¬≠na¬≠tion as the last-ditch, anti-Trump al¬≠ter¬≠na¬≠tive to Sanders. Biden is a party figurehead, not a party leader. Har¬≠ris as VP says that a vote for Biden is a vote for the coastal progressives who now control the De¬≠mo¬≠c¬≠ra¬≠tic Party ~
She‚Äôs as good as Biden at offending her constituents
Biden 2020  Where you are actually voting Harris for president.
You are a racist, misogynistic, and weak man. This white suburban woman is voting for Biden/Harris, and I will do everything I can to insure you lose in a record landslide. #BidenHarris2020 #DefeatTrump
Biden knows the 1918 pandemic didn't end WWII so there's that....
Kamala Harris will not help Biden in Colorado
I still wonder how Democrats chose Biden. Wasn't Elizabeth Warren the best choice...? Even Bernie could have better choice.
Is it? I‚Äôll have to pull the original and reupload at a higher resolution. If O can post a picture of myself with the helmet, jacket, and rope will you donate $20 to Biden‚Äôs campaign?
breaking news. joe biden has dropped out of the race and is now backing cole preston for the 2020 presidential election
I hope and pray it‚Äôs Biden!! We can‚Äôt handle/survive another 4 years of Trump in office...
That's how unenthusiastic people are about biden
And people think Trump is racist üòÇ funny how the black community is actually doing better under him than Obama ü§î even if Biden wasn't blatantly racist, he can barely form a rational sentence!
They‚Äôre all bad. The Biden Ticket is competent and less bad. Failed country but lets vote for the less worse ticket.
Facts, I'm happy for a potential women president/vp but I'm not happy its Joe Biden &amp; Kamla.
I don‚Äôt think anyone‚Äôs perfect, not Biden, Kamala, Trump, not me or you. But I do think people can change &amp; grow and people can be held accountable. I‚Äôm not voting for a perfect President and VP, I‚Äôm voting for people who learn from their mistakes and listen. #BidenHarris2020
Are you saying the Obama-Biden ticket did have a Catholic on it (2008 &amp; 2012), but the Biden-Harris ticket does not?
MSNBC accused of 'cropping' Biden's script from photo of his virtual chat with Harris   MSDNC
Lincoln Project likes Harris: ‚Äúa steadfast defender of justice and human rights...a deserved reputation for opposing the reprehensible actions the current administration has engaged in against both our own citizens and our allies. ..a powerful asset to the Biden campaign.‚Äù
We have enough cops already. We don't need one as VP. It is the absolute most tone-deaf pick that Biden could have made.
Let's be real. Biden could have picked a pack of cigarettes for VP and he still gets my vote over Trump.
It must be a bittersweet day for Joe Biden. I know he's wishing Kamala was Beau's VP pick.
It‚Äôs not bad he supported Harris. He just has to admit it. We will all be donating to her/Biden‚Äôs campaign. Finally something I will do that DJT has done! What a great example. Trump isn‚Äôt so bad after all üòÄ
People that are like fuck Trump fuck Biden. Please tell, who do you vote for ??? Like whose left ????

In the debates Kamala demonstrated her willingness to speak truth to power. I'm confident she will speak her mind to President Biden. That brings me comfort.
I don't think leftists are rallying behind Biden/Harris. The Democratic party probably has a better chance pulling from centrist republicans who regret voting for Trump in '16.
Will said what he thought he heard was that Biden picked Camille Herron to be his running mate, which he found interesting but odd.
Why is Biden a travesty of a candidate?
Ima just go out on a limb and say Kamala Harris wasn‚Äôt Biden‚Äôs best choice...
Bring on the tshirts! Proud nasty woman for Biden/Harris!!
The people that are pissed that Biden chose Harris are the ones that already made it crystal clear that it wouldn‚Äôt matter who he picked, they weren‚Äôt voting for him.
So you had no intent of ever voting for Biden?
Due to college football twitter I wouldn‚Äôt have even known Biden picked his VP candidate üòÇ but I finally figured out who it was and I am ABSOLUTELY SHOCKED. Not...
The fact that your ad calls Biden racist &amp; tries to attack Harris as phony is comical! The ONLY PHONY RACIST that's ever been in our govt is DONALD TRUMP! Racist w/out question, &amp; phony Republican b/c he's a NO ONE, a criminal conman who's failed at politics like everything else!
I LOVE Susan Rice also but can SEE HER as Secretary of State or UN Ambassador too...HER foriengn Policy Knowledge is HER strong suit &amp; HER past working relationship with BIDEN would make for a TRUSTED TEAM‚ÄºÔ∏èüíÅüèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
Kamala Harris is Biden‚Äôs VP pick. Never mind that Tulsi executed her on live tv, and she has many more skeletons left to drag out of the closet.  If you needed to check all of the diversity boxes, why not choose Michelle Obama? At least your base kinda likes her.
BREAKING: Joe Biden announces VP pick  via
Ask yourself this. Do you know anyone that wasn't going to vote for Biden already, that now is?
She has been a VP contender since she  endorsed Biden. Harris is the first Black woman and Asian American person on a major-party presidential ticket.
Biden made a great choice for his running mate, and in the process, chose our next great president once his term is finished. üá∫üá∏
I support Biden/Harris. #VoteBlue2020
not gonna lie, I did get a text from the Biden campaign first at 30330 sharing the VP selection of Harris #BidenHarris2020

Yeah hopefully, I think sort of damage done and if they add him the narrative is that they reluctantly did it because of a twitter backlash.  Maybe that will keep some people in the fold though. I'm for whatever gets the most people in for Biden, so whatever the best play is.
We‚Äôre voting for Biden and here is why. 1/#RidinWithBiden2020
After all the polls showing his supporters the hardest to covert to a different candidate, I don‚Äôt get it but just gonna have to work even harder to get Biden in.  That‚Äôs still the only goal for this year. We‚Äôll revisit this in a few years.
Yeah, a Biden win is priced in, but we may also be nearing the end of building a house of cards when people frantically add top layers to get it as high as possible before the collapse.
I think they totally should. Would excite Poole more and take the focus off the Presidency itself being the most important thing voters should consider. Who would be in your Biden cabinet?
Everyone is joining the Biden campaign! The Republican party is doomed.
Why is it so hard for you to describe what you're talking about?  "Big stock market numbers" could mean anything! HUGE STOCK MARKET NUMBERS (6 years ago when Obama was President) or BIG STOCK MARKET NUMBERS (will return after President Biden is elected) You're a joke! A BAD JOKE!
I'm smart enough to realize a con when I see one, &amp; b/c the interference in our election meant to vilify Joe Biden &amp; claim Trump is a leader who will help America is not only patently false, but pathetically obvious! We ALL have learned a lesson about sociopathy in Trump!

Oh lordy. If Biden had said this, Trump's failsons would already be on Twitter talking about assisted living and memory care options.
I will vote for Biden no matter who the veep is. I was a Warren supporter in the primaries, but now believe that Harris fits the mood of the times better. I want him to just announce already so good non-chosen people don‚Äôt keep being beaten up for no good reason.
We'll have to agree to disagree. Joe Biden is in control of his mental facilities in a way Donald Trump has never been. Trump is the corrupt, conman criminal who's spent decades committing crimes b/c he thinks his wealth entitles him to. Plus no one honest is sued 3500 times!
I can't wait for you to be the Senate minority leader, &amp; President Biden deciding that b/c the GOP is inept he'll just sign an EO to do what he wants! I can't wait to hear you argue why Biden can't do things that you've allowed Trump to do.
Russia is once again interfering with our upcoming election and you're focused on Hunter Biden?  Really?  Do your f job you suckup!

Maybe this is true, maybe not. But either way President Biden wouldn't ever claim that this will be paid for by another country. Why would another country pay for Bidens proposals? They wouldn't, just like Mexico didn't pay for Trumps wall!
Colorado Biden staffer criticized Creepy Joe for calling a 13-year-old hot

I find it amusing and alarming Pelosi is pushing China support for Biden after they murdered so many worldwide. Disgusting!
Who was that?  Because if the answer is Bernie then my reply to you is his people didn't turn out to vote during the primaries.I didn't get my candidate either &amp; I'm voting for Biden because he IS the candidate. Anyone who doesn't bother to vote or votes 3rd party votes for Trump
Anyone wasting time attscking Chuck Todd instead of Trump, Barr, McConnell, Jim Jordan, Lindsey Graham, Mnuchin, Meadows or any other corrupt person working for Trump is WASTING THEIR TIME! We must stick together for Biden! FULLSTOP!

President Biden will enjoy the Trump precedent of making tax policy without approval from Congress, forgiving student loan debt completely without Congress, and doling out federal money to states, without your vote.

Staying home is better than voting for Trump. Personally, I'm voting Biden to get back to some sense of normalcy and following the rule of law.
Either vote for Biden/Harris or STFU and leave!
How could this possible be a conflict of interest?  Wink! Wink! look over here there is nothing wrong with #MailInVoting #MailInBallotFraud
Biden who?
They would be asked policy questions and have to explain their current socialist agenda. Biden is currently leading in the polls, why upset the Apple cart.
So now it‚Äôs Bernie Sanders and Kamala Harris, everyone knows Biden is just a vessel for the far left.
Hannity will be whining this guys name like Uranium One. All through the Biden administration. Unlike with trumps friends, he will likely face punishment, and serve his time if convicted.
Trump supporters tell me a third party vote helps Biden. So, which is it?
Fair enough. But it isn't Trump supporters who made it mandatory Biden choose a "black woman." The birther thing is nonsense. Incidentally, we are all fed. Aren't we? We can choose the restaurant. You choose CNN, NYT, WAPO, MSNBC etc. I choose FOX, WATI, conservative talk radio.

Disgraceful act by the Democrat inspired domestic terrorists. This is the America that the Biden/Harris team want for all Americans. Vote Trump/Pence and Republican in November. Restore law and order and save our constitutional democracy.
Do laws really matter to any of you liberal-minded people I don't think you care about the truth which was proven by Obama and his administration and you are going to do it again with Biden and Harris
So, here we are. Congress is in recess and Trump is actively sabotaging the USPS and spreading lies about Biden and Harris. How do ‚Äúwe‚Äù prevent him from stealing the election? Is this not a clear and present danger?
Commissar Biden‚Äôs latest dictate is outrageous and not based on research. It‚Äôs totally political and a foretells what he and Harris would do as POTUS and VP. Vote Trump and Republican in November. Save our constitutional democracy. MAGA
Biden has been in public office for 48 years, he should have a message and gave taken questions.
Biden and Harris want to lower your taxes, let you keep your health plan, and send your utility bills through the ground.   That‚Äôs  for the people.  It‚Äôs for everyone.
Biden/Harris is the least progressive ticket I‚Äôve ever seen. They might as well be republicans.
Campaign funds will pay it off, kinda like the funds used to pay the $465,000 that Hunter Biden owed in back taxes last week.

Biden/Harris failed to discuss anything about the need for increased focus on maximizing the availability of widespread, cheap, rapid, and frequent antigen testing, the existing technology that would enable schools, businesses, and other public spaces to open safely.
I keep hearing how Biden is so great at getting, processing, and making decisions based the advice of experts. This ridiculously lacking expression of current priorities leaves me with zero confidence in his abilities in that regard.
How can this be the culmination of Biden's effort to express pandemic policy improvements based on expert advice??!!!  This statement isn't slightly accurate based on the science.   #expertbiden #biden2020 #bidenscience #masksoutside #Unity2020 #anotheroption2020 #2020otheroption

Joe Biden &amp; Kamala Harris both said that they are going to rase income tax fees, confiscate our Guns and further rule us under the table.  They are lying to America now and it will get worse latter on.  Please think before filling in the box or pulling the handle.
nobody (on the left) is arguing that biden's handling of the protests will be good but what we do know is that obama never deployed secret gestapo vans to sporadically kidnap people off the streets and we can be cautiously optimistic that biden also won't do this

Biden is maybe the worst candidate for President ever presented to the public. And let's remember, he still hasn't former accepted nor been formerly named as the Presidential nominee. I still think the old switcheroo could be in play. Regardless, Joe's not looking good...

So Biden and Harris have both repeatedly lied since they were introduced yesterday, if they keep it up they should be asked the same question.
the pandemic response under biden is just going to be him shouting "take the vaccine, dummy!" without providing any aid to communities that will inevitably be unable to afford the vaccineüôÉ

Will you and Joe Biden embrace the science of prenatal life?
Trump ramps up sexist rhetoric against political rivals  trump has no shame. So I am not  ashamed of voting for Biden. Maybe we can get our country back in order after this disaster of an administration. America deserves better.
Quite the talk you gave this morning   So, if I heard you correctly, as a woman, I'm more empathetic and will be voting for Biden.  BUT, if I were a man, I'd be voting for Trump because 'men just want to get things done' with Trump.  Quite insulting.
You‚Äôre absolutely right about that. Biden and Harris will kick you and Pencey out of office in November!
Biden getting ahead of the game with the pandemic. Not even in office yet he is ahead of trump already with the virus. What a stark contrast in briefings.
That didn't take long, just over 24 hours since #Biden announces #Kamala as running mate and dominating the news cycle #Trump drops the hammer and announces major foreign policy win in the #MiddleEast, the #abrahampeaceaccord. What a way to change the narrative of the #newscycle.
If they get there with the electoral college then that‚Äôs how the system works. You absolutely can not compare voter fraud to Trump settling on some case. That‚Äôs nonsense. Biden is up to his eyeballs in fraud with his family. Thus is about the high potential for voter fraud.
I think this ad makes Biden look even better. He‚Äôs actually working for the American people. You‚Äôre probably on the train with Stormy Daniels while America dies from COVID.
Biden/Harris might be the worst ticket in like...... ever.
Now do Biden mispronouncing her name several times yesterday, including when he introduced her, does it not matter because he‚Äôs an old guy with Dementia or because he‚Äôs a Democrat?
They were talking about an article by CNN that literally said Biden might be replaced by Harris at the top of the ticket. Gutfeld had the article with him, reading from it.
Biden mispronounced her name three times yesterday, if your own running mate can‚Äôt pronounce it correctly it really shouldn‚Äôt matter.
So I guess that makes Biden a sexist since he totally mispronounced her name when he introduced her. ü§°ü§° Has Don Lemon‚Äôs sexual harassment suit been resolved yet?
It was just too funny hearing CNN try to demean Tucker Carlson for mispronouncing Kamala‚Äòs name. They reamed him in the very next day Joe Biden said at the exact same way.
He actually believes HE did this which is scary,  He took over from the Obama/Biden administration and just like everything he touches is turned to shit making us the biggest shithole country there is.
Look, Biden has already addressed his issues with inappropriate touching, so let's not start in with the whole "thigh land" thing again...  Yes, he didn't apologize or DO anything remotely like ACTUALLY addressing it, but... I mean, there were fragments of... he didn't...  *sigh*

No evidence Obama and Biden did anything to spy on the Trump campaign. No basis for the claim this is going to be a rigged election. Copy-paste, every night at 5:30.
Do you think Pence believes?  I can't understand how Republicans can attack Joe Biden's character with a straight face.  It is startling.
Bro, all I'm saying is that Biden's team realized why no one has assassinated Trump (because then Pence would become pres, and that could be more dangerous) and went "Joe, we have just the human shield - I mean running mate - for you!"
Joe Biden butchered her name tonight, way worse than Tucker did. ü§°ü§°

Trump showing off now he'll let ppl run the train for him while Biden doing hard manual labor. The difference between a bit and a man. Biden is the leader. He don't need nobody else running his train to get where he's going!
Women accused Trump. Over 20 of them, one with evidence, one who was 13.  A woman accused Biden. A woman who turned out to be an actual real life liar for hire.  Try another tack.
Wouldn't it be the secret service job,  once Biden gives them the okay
Are going to teach Biden how to say it correctly? He butchered her name way worse than Tucker Carlson.
‚ÄúNothing will fundamentally change‚Äù under a biden presidency either.
He absolutely is evil though. Not as evil as Trump, but Joe Biden is not your friend.
lol the dnc is fucking stupid fuck biden/harris
I‚Äôm no economist...and neither is Trump.  It‚Äôs like he‚Äôs trying to sell us a timeshare...every fucking day!  Biden/Harris!  Can‚Äôt wait!
I‚Äôve got my own family from Texas in dms spreading QAnon stuff and saying Biden is part of a socialist conspiracy so there‚Äôs some work to be done before we can start having a reasonable conservation about progressive policies üòÇ
4yrs + 8yrs = Biden + Harris = 12 yrs BLUE!!!
I couldn't be happier that  is Biden's VP running mate.  The fact that she is from my home state of California makes it even sweeter that she's going to be on the ballot this November.  #VoteRedToSaveAmerica2020  #BidenHarris2020ToSaveAmerica  #BlueWaveTsunami2020
Except that Joe Biden is the point at which they abandoned pretending to be interested in incrementing and just said ‚Äúfuck the pleebs, they‚Äôll do what they‚Äôre told.‚Äù

No thanks. I want to see Trump and Biden rumble.
These speeches gave me, a nasty suburban housewife, hope that this country can come back from the brink of ruin caused by trump. Biden and Harris are smart and empathetic and can speak in full sentences. They understand democracy. #BidenHarris

Go after Biden  Ignore his attack VP.
You sound scared.  That is not what was said and your interpretation is very flawed. What are you going to do once he's ousted?  You are truly sucking up to the wrong person,  your sight should be on Joe Biden now.
Hey a$$hole, this is my taxpayer money, it‚Äôs not a gift from you! Can‚Äôt wait for the big Biden/Harris win in November!

Actually it's pretty crowded, Kamala, Biden, Hillary, Obama, etc.
yes Kamala has a shit ton of donors.... and y‚Äôall think Biden picked her for any other reason?üòÇ
They don‚Äôt mind Trump‚Äôs ethics at all. Biden makes them liars and hypocrites on every single point they‚Äôve criticized Trump on.  They object to the aesthetics of Covfve. The bits where they talk about ethics are pretexts that disguise that.

First thing I did this morning, make this poster.  Did I mention that I LOVE that Biden picked Harris!!  #BidenHarrisLandslide2020
You‚Äôre absolutely pathetic‚ÄºÔ∏èKamala Harris is a huge boost to Biden‚Äôs presidential race! Have you read the Twitter responses on here?! Most don‚Äôt support you, or trump for that matter.
Truth in advertising request... would like Kamala Harris to take same test Liz Warren took to determine the extent of Black African heritage in her makeup. If Dems want millions to vote for her &amp; Biden based on "identity" then let's be sure she IS black. Only fair.
I oppose fracking as well. So, good news! Thanks for making sure that I vote against you, while voting for Biden/Kamala.
I wonder how it feels to be selected only because of your gender and color of your skin...Biden riding with the times.
You and Pence are quaking in your boots. Biden/Harris is heading for the White House. Get out!
Definitely possible. The other explanation is that Tobin feels that Biden shouldn't just BE excommunicated (likely for being pro-choice), but actually already IS.
Woot woot!!! So excited for this Biden/ Harris ticket. #BidenHarris #BidenHarris2020 #KamalaHarrisForVP #RidinWithBiden
There haven‚Äôt been ‚Äúsuburban housewives‚Äù since 1956. Women from the suburbs are going to vote for Joe Biden in record numbers. We know and appreciate diversity in our neighborhoods.
They're still convinced that Biden will forestall armed revolution while the thought of Trump running the country for at least four more years will force it before 20 Jan. They don't take into account the Trumpstapo can ALREADY stymie all armed revolution, just like in Germany.
I will remind you again that I am a woman who lives in the suburbs and I am voting for Biden /Harris. I welcome affordable housing. #BidenHarris2020
The comical thing is that they are running with the attack that Biden and Harris are ‚Äúfar left liberals‚Äù (which is how they would have attacked any ticket).  If they truly think Biden is ‚Äúfar left‚Äù (which they don‚Äôt...just scare tactics) - whooo boy.
You seem a little worried today, Donnie.  #nastywoman  #wednesdaymorning  #nastywoman  #Biden
Joe Biden that‚Äôs who!
Val, You have demonstrated that you are one of the elite young leaders in the Democratic Party. Joe Biden was fortunate to be able to include you on his short list of VP candidates. Please keep up the wonderful work you are doing on behalf of your constituents and all Americans!

That Wall Street is excited about Kamala Harris - taking it as a sign that a Biden presidency would not be progressive - should tell you a lot.
And yet he endorses a candidate who‚Äôs made waves standing directly against precisely this. Joe Biden sees Obamacare in the way that American racists see statues of Confederate generals: as a transcendental symbol that must be preserved at any cost at all.
I asked for this ticket the day Biden locked up the nomination!
I mean, the whole point of a Biden campaign is to ignore all of the facts about his history while pretending at the same time that the Dems weren‚Äôt deeply contemptuous of Republicans saying precisely this about Trump on 2016.
And Obama isn't Catholic (so Biden filled that role in 2008 and 2012 by his own logic) so this clown Bishop Tobin has no clue what he's babbling about.
What happened to you?  Are you in the same stage of dementia as Biden?
Kamala Harris Is Biden's VP Pick -- Here's What It Means For The Election And Beyond
But hey, way to once again avoid saying anything positive at all about Biden.   I mean, since there‚Äôs literally nothing good to say about him, you go straight for sneering at what you think my ‚Äúreal motivations are.‚Äù  True to form for Biden Bros: go straight gor the ad hominem.
Dude.   Joe Biden already is a victory for the right. He hands them everything they‚Äôve wanted for fifty years.   That belief you have that he‚Äôs substantively different from Trump in literally any way at all? That‚Äôs an article of religious faith totally undupported by evidence.
Did Governor of Georgia, Stacy Abram, accept nomination for Biden‚Äôs VP?

Biden‚Äôs text came through as I was in my car, getting ready to walk into a job site. I had to stay in my car to compose myself before walking in because I was sobbing. Then I had to measure the kitchen 3x because I couldn‚Äôt focus. I forgot what it was like to cry tears of joy. üíõ
It‚Äôs time to get some sleep, and I‚Äôll be sleeping much better when Biden/Harris are winning!  #BidenHarris2020Landslide
I think the wording was intended and factual. Anyone with a functional brain knows Biden is unfit to serve as President, even those in news media.
Guess my follow-up question would be...if not Biden/Harris, who? Because my honest feeling is that we can‚Äôt survive another 4 years of *this*...
We Proudly Support Joe Biden.Joe Biden is for improvement. Improvement for ALL Americans.
Ms. McEnany: Consider contrasting Biden/Harris Qs from Cavenough 2019/1991 Thomas hearings with Trump/Pence stand for "innocent until proven guilty." Then ask (voters) "Is this the future Justice system you want?" PClose w/list of 1st T. wins-prison reform, SCOTUS, etc.
What is the number of women that accused Biden of sexual misconduct and how many BJs did she give to win the VP nomination?
Welp, no surprise on the Biden front today. The entirety of his policy positions for fifty years has been MORE COPS.
Biden sniffed.....sorry,  I meant picked, Harris for Running Mate.  Excuse the expression.
I swear to god Joe Biden is gonna drop dead from being a wrinkly old fuck within 3 months of being inaugurated, and then we'll be stuck with the cop nobody wanted to begin with
Wouldn't it be amazing if she were recognized for her achievements in life rather than the things she had no choice over? The headline should read something like, "Kamala Harris, Senator and Former AG nominated to VP for Biden" Instead her race and gender get top billing.

He has the vocabulary of a 5th grade bully. Hope the Dems just let him continue the downward slide while the high road is open for Biden and Harris. The difference between the candidates could not be more evident. #BidenHarris2020 #VoteBlue
When Biden wins and his acceptance speech, right before he's done, would it not be amazing for him to say "you're fired"? How sweet would that be!
So? She is? She attacked Biden on segregation and race, she was just a raving lunatic when she went after Kavanaugh. Not sure what your point is? Just because she‚Äôs a woman she can‚Äôt be criticized?
Yep lol Biden picked a cop and drug warrior as his VP when feelings on the police are at an all time low.

I think she is a perfect pick for Biden and she will knock it out of the park!!
Trump sure sounded scared! He knows Pence isn‚Äôt comparable to Harris at all! And Trump knows that Biden knows more about the US government &amp; US Constitution than he ever will! Trump failed America! #TrumpVirusKillsAmericans, churches, sports, restaurants, vacations, schools, etc!

Donna Brazile cheats by giving the debate questions 2 Hillary ahead of time. She lies on a daily basis about Repubs &amp; our Prez, yet she professes 2 be a woman of faith &amp; wants us 2 believe Joe Biden is too. Not sure she's the right messenger.
All this talk about Biden's problems are projection and you know it. Trump was saying that Biden mispronouncing words was exactly what Trump did with Thigh-land. Trump looks ill when he walks, he's losing concentration when he talks. He's destroying tus. Do you care
Alongside Joe Biden and Donald Trump's name on Colorado's presidential ballot will be Kanye West.
Do you ever wonder who is writing Joe Biden‚Äôs tweets?I agree. Vote Biden.
If Biden and #KamalaToe are elected they will make it OK to discriminate against your race.

What do you expect people to do??? To hide in their basements freaked the hell out over COVID-19 like Sleepy Joe Biden? ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
Sorry...my bad ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è it says below your actual tweet that the tweet is unavailable but when you click the blue link it shows Biden‚Äôs tweet.
If you have to ask that you are not looking at the big picture. It's more than Biden. It's the Scotus pick. Secretary of state. AG. Let. Col. Vindman's, ambassadors, federal judges. D The list is huge. We need someone that understands our constitution!
Are you fukcing kidding me! Will we ever outlive racism? "A Virginia mayor is facing calls for his resignation over a Facebook post in which he said that Joe Biden "just announced Aunt Jemima" as his running mate." #TrumpRacist
Not if it‚Äôs from trumps administration. When we get a vaccine under President Biden yes I will!
Biden/Harris-dripping slime as they emerge from the swamp.
We are all humans, if you are a Biden supporter, great. If you are a Trump supporter, great. But to create division by touting what we assume the other side will do, does no good!
I do not disagree. Even if and after Biden is sworn in, there may be major unrest.
More jobs under Trump-Pence since May than all of Obama-Biden.  (Even in a Pandemic, Trump's record is better than Obama-Biden)
Kamala: It was all theater! None of it is real! I'm not real! Joe Biden is not real! It's all bullshit!
Why is this even a question. Its Biden. You are also voting to solve the pandemic, remove Devoss, install a cabinet of patriots instead of grifters, and restore allied relationships. Its not about Biden its about the bigger picture. Jfc
Biden: 'A Black Woman Will Become President Over My Dead Body' ....
I care about what he has to say and I plan to vote for Biden, right now he has millions of people who will vote a straight blue ticket, just as you will votes red ticket.   Now is it so hard to be decent?
I still feel good about it because Hillary won my state anyway &amp; Bill is even creepier now (it was so cringe to think of him as the first gentleman). But if I lived in a swing state that went Trump I might regret voting for Johnson over Clinton. All in for Biden/Harris this year.
He's gonna do a LOT more of this in different ways. The strategy will be to divide the left more, and play to republicans who could be on the fence toward Biden. Think about who he needs to secure and think backwards every time he makes a move. He will also distract in ways.
Trump pushed that Israel deal through because he knew that Biden would agree for votes, and he knew that this could stir up trouble with the left. He uses the Israel/ "middle east" card strategically. Watch the strategy, pay attention, don't get played by him.
100% agree. Fortunately, I live in a state where I can return a ballot to a collection box, but still...I'd crawl over glass to vote for Biden.
a photoshopped picture of you on a bike won‚Äôt do it. We want to see a live shot of you riding with secret service &amp;answering questions from reporters at the same time!   You know, like Biden did! It should be easy your very fit doctor says you‚Äôre in better shape!
Have you noticed that the Corvid-19 virus and the BLM violence has allowed the MSM to ignore Tara Reade and her allegations against Biden? Have you noticed that?
Which is why we are voting for Biden/Harris! She is awesome and Kavanaugh is a political hack!
Wait, an overzealous prosecutor with a record of hiding evidence and keeping innocents in jail declared a case she's neither working, nor familiar with, (nor even exists) "open and shut?" SSSShhhhhhhocking.
Harris is a truly bad pick for Biden! Thank you, Joe!
Biden should drop out of the race and vote for Trump/Pence.

Maybe. I think Biden's primary goal is to do no harm, and when you don't have strong views on anything like Kamala, you're good. This election is going to be a referendum on Trump, strong Dems will come out anyway.
Or a sex offender?
You going to make him answer? Deep State really likes you because your compromised.

Serious question: I get Biden is not the "progessive" but do the following appointments not mean anything to you? SCOTUS, Sec of State, AG, IG, Ambassadors, The Lt. Vindman's of the world, Federal Judges, and more. Seriously, if trump is elected you will not have any or ACA
But hey   tell me more about Biden‚Äôs dementia.  I saw Biden active on a bike. I saw trump unable to drink a glass of water or walk down a ramp.   Biden knows WWII ended in 1945. Trump doesn‚Äôt even know the 1918 pandemic was in 1918!

Awesome. We need all of this. We can save tons with Trump out of office and not lining his or his friends pockets with billions of taxpayer dollars.   Vote Biden!

...You realize the actual left also hates Biden, right?  He's a rightwing candidate that is for the status quo and won't fix a damn thing.
Of course the American people need to see Biden attempt to debate the president! Why would you not do the interview to get a job??? How is this not obvious?!?!?!? #HidenBiden #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2020

Trumps ‚Äúpress conference ‚Äú is only a trash Biden conference. Trash Harris. Why reporters stay is beyond me!

I think I am going to lose some money on that one if Biden wins the election, but satisfaction of knowing the money will be put in good use makes up for it.

Do you really want to talk about the past 50 years of Ds and Rs? How about just Biden's record in 50 years in Senate and VP? They've done way more harm than good, and left us with a $27,000,000,000,000 bill.
Your daughter supports Biden and Harris.   You just look like a fool.
Why is a Biden lie worse than a Trump lie?
God Biden sounds like a President. We've been desensitized to the abhorrent behavior of Trump.
According to  Kampala Harris was ranked as the most Liberal US Senator in 2019. Biden is losing votes in November.
Joe Biden now partnered with Antifa
But Biden's laws he co-authored still stay on the books 25 years later. He may have "changed his mind", but we still have to deal with the consequences of Biden's actions.
We started with one covid infection, now we have over a million infected, more than 155 thousand dead Americans, and President Trump said covid will soon disappear. It didn't! That‚Äôs the kind of opponent Joe Biden and everyone will love to run against!
Biden is in bed with the clintons. The clintons are on trial for treason. Do i need any other reason to be skeptical?
We should not even be talking about Biden becoming president. Because he will not. Period.
Trump has continued the borrowing &amp; spending. He's running up the debt as we speak with a suspended debt ceiling til end of year. He refuses to end the war on drugs. He refuses to address qualified immunity or the Biden Crime Bills allowing police abuse &amp; murder of Americans.
the crippling student debt that joe biden saddled me with, that i couldn‚Äôt get out from under is the reason i didn‚Äôt go to grad school
Thanks to the mandatory minimum drug sentences Biden co-authored and helped pass where child rapists can now serve less time than drug dealers. Harsh drug penalties and a War, but drug use is still the same as 1972 when it all started.
"Electing Joe Biden &amp; Kamala Harris would be a grave mistake for this Nation with irreversible consequences. They will raise taxes, cut police funding, kill energy jobs, open our borders, and appease socialist dictators. We cannot allow our Nation to go down that path."
"From the very first day of this Administration, President Trump has set our Nation on a path to freedom and opportunity. Joe Biden and Kamala Harris would set America on the path of SOCIALISM and DECLINE."
this "...shows Biden &amp; the Democrat Party have been overtaken by the Radical Left. Given their promises of higher taxes, open borders, socialized medicine &amp; Abortion on Demand, it‚Äôs no surprise he chose Senator Harris, she is weak on crime and refuses to put America First.
here's some bullshit the orange turd's trainwreck campaign emailed out this morning about Biden picking Harris:
End the Drug War, cut federal govt spending and get powers back to state/local govt under 10th Amendment, end global warfare, end qualified immunity, repeal the Biden Crime Bills,.. I'm all for the Libertarian platform.
Trump is a complete disgrace to all of America and the WORLD yet you‚Äôre going to enable him to win the 2020 election because you don‚Äôt like Biden‚Äôs VP pick? Grow up.
This shows that Joe Biden is confident and secure in himself as opposed to a weak, fragile baby like tRump. Joe will actually listen to others. Gee, what a novel idea!
This isn‚Äôt even ‚Äúthe alternative.‚Äù This is *now.* This is happening and has been happening and will keep happening. So go on and call me whatever you want for voting Biden/Harris. I‚Äôm still voting for them for you. Yes, you.
Biden- Corporate United States worships money and power even as Earth Extinction event to end all other events locked down on the sacred rights of words we stand by post Coup. The Trump Russian Oligarchy= Where is the Purple Majesty... as Earth is locked into heat and entropy to.
I hear you but ..... Biden2020 Biden 2024 Harris 2028 Harris 2032 looks pretty darn good to me !!!! Celebrate that!!!!
How does she reconcile this:
My problem is Biden spent 50 years in DC as a Senator &amp; VP. He couldn't change his mind about legislation he created &amp; passed when he was in a position to do something about it? Instead we still have to deal with the laws he left on the books allowing police to abuse Americans.
How does she justify running as his VP? Politics of course.
I finally found something I agree with them on: I also believe Biden's sexual assault accusers (and Trump's)
Biden loss for sure. Trump 2020!

Wow!  Brilliant move Mr. Biden!  Keep your friends close and your enemies closer...
Gonna be honest, I saw Biden‚Äôs VP pick coming.   Still not happy with our election choices and I‚Äôm not a fan of the existing system but the changes I‚Äôd like to see would take much longer than I like.
YES! With Kamala Harris as Biden's VP pick, Newsom has a chance to appoint history-making senator

Oh yes, we all love hearing you lie about Covid, voter fraud, starving the post office, and ridiculous shit you make up about Joe Biden. Can‚Äôt wait!!!
For #2, just go to Biden War Room. It has complete voting info for every state.
Biden isn‚Äôt a blatant liar like Donald Trump? It is scary that Trump supporters accept the transparent lies.
I confess I'm torn. A big part of me wants the Republicans to keep the Senate to check a Biden presidency. But a big part of me wants to see a total reset of the Republican Party. Every possible outcome is largely bad. And anyway the outcome doesn't depend on what I think.
FYI: Trump just handed Biden/Harris a golden goose on a silver platter when he tried to destroy the USPS. No matter your political affiliation millions of Americans and businesses depend on the USPS and they will protest against this to the ninth degree.
I disagree with Trump. I also disagree with  decision to run an unqualified corrupt criminal who establishment dems think has name value over Andrew Romanoff. I will vote for Biden/Harris. But I will not sell out my values and beliefs to vote for a puppet like Hickenlooper...
So my pendulum is swinging towards Biden, (sorry Tara) BUT not entirely. He &amp; Kamala need to EARN my vote. My world has been rocked.. and rolled over. Where the fuck is congress RN? America needs your help. November is coming &amp; your job may be gone. My husband‚Äôs is... #twocents
Biden needs to go into a bunker and let Trump dig his own grave and throw the dirt on top of himself.
The nasty memes of Harris began the moment Biden picked her to be his running mate.  This ad targets people in their mid-thirties. It hits Trump hard because it is exactly who he is.
Yeah Biden figured out how you could pay him fo nothing but a crippling crime bill and a way to get rich!!!

Senator, it's great you're working to help unemployed Coloradans but if you don't stand up to Trump's facist tyranny that's tearing down the USPS to suppress voting rights, then you're a traitor betraying all Americans. W/ Biden's lead growing in CO, it doesn't bode well for you.
All I have is a high school diploma. I‚Äôm for Biden all the way. Maybe the undereducated would be more likely to vote ‚Äúleft‚Äù if you assholes weren‚Äôt so goddamned condescending.
I have high school diploma. I‚Äôm for Biden all the way.
Will Biden do something about the shower heads. We can‚Äôt forget the shower heads.
Less so than Trump's collision course with history. As I alluded to, with Biden we at least have a fighting chance to survive. Trump and republicans are an unmitigated disaster. Vote strategically, think long term. Vote your values locally where they especially count.
Yep, that's weird to me too. But Dem/Rep is some not sort of mirror-opposite pair. We the People at least have a voice with Dems. Republicans serve *only* the wealthy with "trickle down" as their solution to everything. Next POTUS will be Biden or Trump. Choose strategically.
I'm there.  Going to the Post Office this morning for stamps for my Biden/Harris postcards.
This is troubling. She has the right to her opinion, but this comes across as an endorsement for Biden.  Both parties do good, both do bad. What does she think about Biden / Harris stance on abortion?
Agree, lesser of two evils. But the fetus has no voice, we need to be the voice. Democrats have shown for decades that there is no budging on their pro-abortion position. Biden claiming to be Catholic yet pro-abortion? Respect human life begins with the fetus.
The presidential race is only one of many. Very meaningful work can be done locally. So the answer is always now. As for the next president, unfortunately it is again a two-party race - Biden or Trump. So vote Biden to fight another day. Trump is on a very destructive course.
There is so much wrong in this statement, I‚Äôm not even going to bother with responding other than to say, Mr. President   YOU ARE WRONG‚ÄîAGAIN!  Vote Biden/Harris. We can do better in November!
Trump is a not representing Republican values and is hurting our nation, and the party has the audacity to call Biden/Harris radical left?
I enjoy that Presidential campaigns are turning into meme offs. Biden needs to step it up.
Wait, so Biden working hard to make progress while Trump just sits and does nothing? I thought he was "Sleepy Joe?" I'm confused.

Don't confuse democrats; lawful, rational, voting citizens like me, with rioters.  There's a chance the rioters might vote for Biden but I'm guessing they are disconnected from society to the extent they won't vote at all.  Nobody is courting them for support; we don't need them.
As #TrumpKillsUSPS, ask for your ballot early, vote Biden, close your envelope, sign it and take it to a drop box near you. That is the only way to work around the corruption of Trump and his cronies, including Putin. Vote! Go the extra mile. This country depends on it

Hahahahaha. She‚Äôs below average. Especially if your vote is really for her and not for Biden since he‚Äôs got dementia
You are an excellent person to match with Biden. Keep him in line along with he senate üòè
.  I absolutely loved hearing Joe Biden and Kamala Harris speak to our country today. They both are so articulate, so passionate and extremely intelligent. They love our country, they love their families and they will restore our democracy!
He‚Äôs doing if again. Quid pro quo. You elect me I‚Äôll eliminate the tax I imposed on you. Someone tell Biden to make the same forgiveness claim.
He just gave rave reviews for Kamala Harris and referenced Biden as the next president of the US.
Also, your repeatedly calling Joe Biden "evil" sort of gives it all away.
U guys realize Biden is the same as trump only less of a cunt
My guess is he might actually be taking votes away from Donald - the Republicans who just can't bring themselves to vote for Joe Biden.
I‚Äôm voting Biden-Harris.   Let‚Äôs do this.  2020üíô
Pure comedy to see Trumpers make moral arguments, or bring up corruption, or in one case "race baiting" to use against Biden/Harris vs Trump.  Republicans circled around a racist, corrupt, amoral, liar whose self absorption has caused more Americans to die than any war. FU!
I guess this is the only black person they know so they had to get him to run as a spoiler, so all black people will vote for Kanye and Joe Biden will lose????  Clueless!
Finally! This country has a big, wide ray of hope with a Biden/Harris ticket. Can we elect them tomorrow?
Wrong, Liz. Watch this. November 3rd we elect Biden/Harris. In a landslide.
Joe Biden is in the early stages of dementia.  So there‚Äôs that.
What about the Trump vs Biden debate? Isn‚Äôt that who the race is with Trump and Biden? What happened to that?
Dr. Biden, we are all ready!
Joe Biden‚Äôs selection of Kamala Harris as his running mate is a home run.  She‚Äôs an amazing public servant and will be a stellar VP.
The USA is no longer a world leader.  Thank you, I hope we get health care, also.   I agree. Our climate can't wait another day. Trump gutted EPA regulations &amp; pulled us out of the Paris Accord. Biden will rectify all of that.
As I have already said, Biden was my second to last choice.  I watched Kamala shred Jeff Sessions and Bill Barr. I enjoyed it. I am sick of white men being in power.   I actually wanted a Warren/Harris ticket, but god forbid we have an all female ticket.
We can only hope that Biden/Harris do a better job.  The Democratic party has evolved since 1994.
Biden was my second to last choice.  We had numerous more qualified female candidates.
What? You trying to be funny?  Hillary just acknowledged that the Democratic ticket is Joe Biden and Kamala Harris.   Maybe Tim should stop running his mouth.
Yes, all Republicans are pro-life. Republicans voted for Trump because they think he is pro-life. They are one-issue voters.  Biden is RESPECTED by people on both sides. That's a plus.  Answer my question - you want Trump?
I'd be more ready if it weren't Harris... or Biden.... but at this point I'll take Hillary over the current dumpster fire
The guy who wanted 5 kids to get the death penalty just for being guilty of being black is trying to tell us Biden is racist. I think you better spend your dollars convincing Ohio and Pennsylvania that we are going back 50 years and returning to a manufacturing economy.
Why are you so sure it won't get better under Biden/Harris?
Lauren, you are the type of leader we need in the white House, not Trump, not Biden, not Kamala
Had to break it to you but I never said I wanted Biden to lose
Biden has been out and about following social distancing protocol. God I can‚Äôt wait for the debates to start.
I‚Äôm in. Great Pick Joe Biden.
After giving it some VP Biden has made the right decision picking Kamala Harris for his running mate as VP in the 2020 election.
Oh, am I going to enjoy how they‚Äôll kick your ass, Donnie. You‚Äôll be humiliated and I hope you live long enough to suffer from jail for all you‚Äôve done right after Biden takes over
People who think Joe Biden cares about me are stupid, im voting for him but only because I rather get punched in one eye than both
I absolutely agree. Four years of Biden, eight years of Harris! #BidenHarris #BlueWave2020
Biden just lost any chance of becoming President She is widely unliked by people on both sides
Yes. Now you can vote for that man in the White House.  We are fighting for our country. Vote Biden/Harris!
Apple autocorrect would like to announce Joe Biden‚Äôs running mate selection, Senator Kampala Harris #BidenHarris #ByeDonJr
truth Biden is a political liar and always has been and in 47 years he gave us the big time crime bill against Kamala Harris‚Äôs constituents
That Biden chose a Leftist Communist
Because ‚ÄúWE THE PEOPLE‚Äù for Biden don‚Äôt need the foolishness! People are sick of Trump and his blind followers!
Biden/Harris 2020: Get Bus...ted.
The Leftist Communists will have the Whitehouse if Biden is elected!! That is just the worst situation for America ever!!
Sitting here listening to... ...DONNIE FUCKSTICK.... blabble, blabble, blabber. WHEN ARE YOU ACTUALLY GOING TO SAY SOMETHING INTELLIGENT ?? Now that we have a Biden/Harris ticket YOU ARE RUNNING SCARED !!
Certainly the pandemic has taught everyone that our health insurance shouldn't be tied to unemployment.  I am going to hold out a little hope that Biden/Harris will do the right thing.
everybody talking about who they wanted joe biden‚Äôs running mate to be, like bruh... i jus want herüòî
I absolutely love this piece. Mail in ballots are the only way I have voted since turning 18. #2020Elections
Sen. Kamala D. Harris named as Joe Biden‚Äôs running mate
It‚Äôs kind of comical that Harris called Biden a racist, demanded an apology, never got it, yet is now his running mate...
What lessons does Biden pick hold for 2024 deputy PM picks here? Starmer will want to balance his ticket northwards ‚Äî Nandy has to be in with a shout. Blair did similar by picking Prescott as his running mate. Imagine Johnson/Sunak is already nailed on.
Biden/Harris! It's on like Donkey Kong!
Neither Biden nor Pence has military experience, either. I've long respected you, your service and your positions, but this one reeks.
Joe Biden confirms my exclusive:
Congratulations, Vice-President Kamala Harris!   Biden's announcement has brought me the first spark of hope I have felt in years!
Make no mistake, Kamala Harris is the real presidential candidate. If elected Joe Biden will not make it past 2/1/2021 before he is declared mentally unfit, and replaced by her. This is a bait and switch like no other.
And Biden won't become president til 2021.
Understand from Democratic Party source that Joe Biden is about to nominate Kamala Harris as his running mate
I'm thrilled! Biden made the best possible choice!
Why is Biden announcing this like a judges house episode of X Factor
We need to hold both houses of Congress and the White House. We can get there if #ProgressivesForBiden &amp; Independents join us to vote for Biden, then we should have a new president.
And just like that trumpies try to make Biden look as bad as Trump.  This will never happen; Trump has waay too much baggage, too many accusations, too many payoffs, too many divorces and too many human failures.  #MeToo is alive and well, thankfully.
The best choice for  Biden VP should be someone who has govern,  everything else will in place.
For Biden pick as  VP  Gretchen Whitmer .......
You have absolutely nothing.  All you can do is try to tear down Biden, because you can't run on the disastrous results of the last 3 1/2 years.  Can't wait until you're gone, and the SDNY puts 45 behind bars.  Lock him up!!
What else is new?  It's been this way since the late ‚Äò80s.  I'm rooting for Harris.  She'd make a great president if Biden were to be incapacitated.
You interpret Biden's actions as sexual.  I think they're more misplaced grandfatherly affection; not necessarily sexual.  Agree it's weird and gross, but he's not Trump with huge amounts of sexual baggage that trumpies choose to ignore.
I disagree.  There is no evidence he ever did anything sexual.  You perpetuate this false narrative.  Your cult leader did say ‚ÄúIn 10 years I'll be dating her.  Can you believe it?‚Äù.  20+ allegations of sexual assault against Trump and you perpetuate this lie about Biden.
I don't excuse it.  I think it's creepy.  I am disappointed in the DNC's selection.  I‚Äôm not voting for Biden as much as voting against Trump who is 1000x worse.  As usual it's the choice of the lesser of 2 evils.
Those videos show Biden sniffing hair, that's all.  I agree it's weird but one could make a credible case for grandfatherly affection in all cases.  Nobody has filed suit although I think a couple said it was awkward.  Contrast this with 20+ allegations against Trump.
They can sign it. No one would understand it. This is my thing. Why does his family seemed publicly obsessed with Biden's health while being publicly obtuse to their father's health?
I would vote for a Biden/Obama ticket.
if his name was Joe Biden, you would be all over this. Right?  It can't be dementia if he didn't know in the first place.
This fucking idiot right here... and people are whining about we need to make a case for them to vote for Biden.  SMFH.
How awesome would this be if Buttigieg was picked as Biden‚Äôs VP. Lmao!! ü§£ I‚Äôm really rooting for this ü§£üòâ
I hope the 51 million plus people unemployed understand that their 401K will go down when Biden is president. I'm sure this is the most pressing thing on your plate right now while you fight eviction, go to a food bank and apply for unemployment. #TrumpPressConference
I vote for B...  yes option B and Biden.
so this is tge new employment scenario under Democratic Rule and Biden huh????
Biden can‚Äôt support his own train of thought for more than a few minutes. I‚Äôm not saying he‚Äôs too old to be president, but I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs all mentally there enough to take on such a large responsibility as being the president of the United States of a America.
Joe Biden rides a bike, while daddy rides a golf cart!
Ok let's tally this up. China bought Biden &amp; the resulting carnage was Hunter got a job. Russia buys Heir Father &amp; the resulting carnage is 165,564 dead from the #TrumpVirus, dozens dead from Russian bounties, &amp; 51M+ unemployed. The only good thing is #MaryTrump's bestseller.
VOTE   FOR   BIDEN   !!!
VOTE  FOR  BIDEN   TKS   !!!
TELL   ALL    TO  VOTE   FOR    BIDEN  TKS   !!!
Biden is doing just fine. Looking forward to watching his inauguration in January 2021. So will the rest of the world.
Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, Joe Biden, AOC, Chuck Schumer, Nancy Pelosi, All socialist trying to create hostility in our society to gain political power and to push their socialist agenda.
I would vote for Biden if he picked his dog Major as his running mate.
I don‚Äôt know what happened with you two, but best wishes. I‚Äôm just happy Sandy is wearing a mask and voting Biden. My world is small.
Joe Biden is a Catholic ????  Don't make me puke.
Win what? No one delights in your public demise. Get some help. Get back to writing &amp; push your art. I don't think you are hurting Biden. I think you are hurting yourself &amp; your family. I'm going to be straight with you. I am not a fan of your music. But, I hate watching this.
You'd rather have the Orange Monster in the White House for 4 more years? I know Biden's not ideal, but he'll surround himself with qualified people, not grifters. He'll at least start steering the ship in the right direction.
Do Biden voters watch Fox?
Seriously are Democrats brainwashed it's amazing how they say one thing and do another just like Nancy pelosi blaming Trump for not doing things fast enough on coronavirus but yet it was her dancing around in Chinatown saying to not block people and Joe Biden saying xenophobe wth
Why would anyone even think this?  Can somebody defend this position or are her marbles just as loose as Joe Biden?
He wasn't trailing Biden for the last 3 years
Have you shown your father half as much interest in his medical care that you have shown Biden? I know you are kind of the ignored one because you don't have his name &amp; you don't have a vagina, but that reality that you don't SEE your father's brain is rotten fruit is glaring.
The idea that Kanye should suspend his mental illness long enough for Biden to get elected is ridiculous. The run is the disease.
No one would do what you've done!  Competent presidents would have nipped this in the bud in December of last year.  They wouldn't ignore everything around them for months.  I've been working from home in March and I don't see any end it sight -- until President Biden!
Educate yourself and read, Biden has been called out for his pro-abortion stance.Someone intel-check me here:  if he suppresses Biden's votes, isn't he also suppressing Trump votes?  Feel free to drag me if I'm missing something obvious.

Payroll Tax is Social Security !  tRump will  Eliminate Social Security IF  re elected.  Vote Biden- Harris. 2020  !!
How rich. Biden has been hiding in his basement.
Anyone voting for Trump over Biden for religious reasons  is brain dead anyway...
You have got to be kidding!! People are not stupid. The economy and unemployment was a mess for 8 yrs under Biden and Obama and they blamed Bush . Get your facts straight
Biden called Trump's China travel restrictions back in January xenophobic. Biden and Harris apparently vying for the most dishonest ticket in US history. Harris is a liar or her ambition supersedes concerns that she has that Biden is a racist and a serial sexual abuser.
I‚Äôm a suburban wife, mom, and teacher. I‚Äôll be voting for Biden/Harris. üíôüá∫üá∏
Joe Biden is insane. We have 50 state governments with health departments that can decide what is best for their states. We don't need a coastal liberal to tell us all what we have to do.
seeing Biden behind that desk on TV Saying rational things - it‚Äôs like OMG th SYS what leadership fees like - I had forgotten
Let's start calling Biden and Harris, "Mean and Nasty".
Liar.  next,  next,  next,  All Biden. Toss ups in Ohio, North Carolina, then add 80,000 dead Americans many in TX, GA and IA and I like my chances.  Better stop the mail and call Putin.
You nailed it:  Trump Train Wreck.  Biden/Harris going to mop the floor with you.   #1Term. #Loser
Biden criticized Trump for taking out General Qasem Soleimani but now says that Trump has coddled terrorists. Declining mental faculties and dishonesty is not a good combination
This sounds like misty-eyed optimism.  The only way he ratchets up his favorability is if Biden's poll-power drops significantly.  Trump's "love" comes only from his base, and that's static.
I‚Äôm attending Joe Biden for President‚Äôs event, ‚ÄúSeniors for Biden: Social Security Anniversary Event hosted by Jill Biden and Louis Gossett Jr.‚Äù ‚Äì sign up now to join me! #TeamJoe
'Open and shut': Kamala Harris argues case is clear against Trump in introduction as Biden's running mate  via
Leftism is things like universal healthcare, which I thought Biden was waffle-ish about.
It's not a joke, it's a nebulous term people (including Trump) are trotting out to invoke fear of a Biden presidency.
Anti Trump isn't a platform. The democrats need to be FOR things. Easy to articulate and rally around. (Their version of "build the wall") Biden is just another old man, with rambled sentences. FAR better than Trump, but not inspiring. Trump has fear and anger on his side.
Shes locked up almost as many black people as biden. I thought we were against police shes a cop. Hmmmmm seems you dont know much outside of playing basketball
Trump is going to have a Rough time with Joe Biden Also !  Is time to Drain the gOp Swamp !
I‚Äôm excited about the Biden/Harris ticket. And if the ‚Äúprofessionals‚Äù turn out to be correct, President Harris will be inaugurated in Jan 2025. And Mayor Pete? He will be her VP.  Exciting times for our country.
First order of business for Biden/Harris
You have zero So do 100% I am posting this reply. I know Pres Trump/ Pence  have do a much better job through a turmoiled 3 3/4 yrs . Better by far than 8 corrupt yrs Obama/ Biden. Biden/Harris more corruption,Dems are socialists. SAD . Not good , not happening
I so thought Biden would pick her!I guess she as too much corrupt baggage to Obama. Very familiar to Biden though
She did say that she believed the women that accused Biden of aggressive sexual advances and sexual assault.
Really I so see it waay differently. Kamal is a real fraud . Also has lied numerous times as had Biden..  Biden for sure in his comments about college degreees etc
So I really want to ask ALLDemocracts are you comfortable  with Biden choosing Kamala Harris as VP? As well are you comfortable being a Democract /Socialist Party ??
Since Putin is still alive how about a Biden/Putin ticket?
My only comment is WHAT? üòä she is totally incompetent and I know many in Calif. think so as well. Minorities, prisoners , common people.. actually Biden during debates.. so.. as a GOP I‚Äôm good. I have Trump/Pence üá∫üá∏
I wouldn't be surprised. His base is energized. No one I know is excited about Biden.
Biden won because he wasn't as extreme as the other candidates. With his declining mental faculties, there is a real possibility that she could president during his first term. People that were worried about Harris will be even more worried tonight. This pick is made for Trump!
Biden became the presumptive nominee running as a moderate as compared to ultra liberals like Harris. Harris did poorly in the primaries because of her far left liberal views. The point is Biden is no longer a moderate and his association with Harris and AOC prove it.
Having a California liberal on the ticket is inconsistent with the idea that Biden is a moderate. AOC is one of his advisors. Her attacks on Biden during the debates puts into question the level of respect that she has for Biden.
I really would love to see a Dem team of rivals if Biden wins. Bring in Warren, Castro, Sanders, Booker, and Klobuchar to fix this mess.
Looks like the stock market likes a Biden-Kamala option.
Kamala Harris Is Biden‚Äôs Choice for Vice President
Joe Biden has selected a person with a cervix who is a descendant of slave owners.
Biden/Harris! We got this!
Joe Biden has selected his puppeteer with a cervix as his running mate.
Pedophile Joe creepy Biden who happens to have Alzheimer‚Äôs is not a presidential candidate who by the way wants socialism
If you have anything similar to this Trump lawsuit about Biden, I‚Äôd love to see it. Otherwise, in America, we are innocent until proven guilty in court, and Biden has never even been charged with anything like this. But keep believing the propaganda, it‚Äôs what helps Trump most.
And Trump is defunding Social Security and Medicare. At least Biden isn‚Äôt tearing away the money from grandmas and grandpas who need it.
So, let me explain why I‚Äôm on board with VBNMW this year. I‚Äôm Jewish, my hubby is Mex-Am, and we have 3 girls. We have faced hate from Trumpers for 4 years. Even got death threats. Nazis love him. And they hate Biden. So I go with who the Nazis hate.
If you could provide evidence of your claims, I‚Äôd be happy to read them. I know of one assault accusation, and it pisses me off. Those I wanted never did those kinds of things, but they didn‚Äôt win. I don‚Äôt have to love everything about Biden, but I‚Äôm repulsed by everything Trump.
I do. Again, guy who‚Äôs bankrupted multiple businesses, multiple rape charges, friends with lots of pedos, 170K+ Americans dead, or Biden. I‚Äôll happily go with Biden.
Lol, I‚Äôm no neoliberal, just someone who sees the danger in voting for anyone but Biden, as that‚Äôll certainly give the win to Trump. But hey, enjoy whatever you‚Äôre on, clearly it‚Äôs working well for you üòÇ
H1N1, Ebola... no pandemics? No, they just didn‚Äôt hit American shores like COViD has, because we had a plan in place that Trump dismantled. And please show me the credible rape allegation against Biden, I‚Äôd be happy to provide the same for Trump.
Trump has been accused of raping at least 20 women, including one who was 13 at the time. Biden sniffs hair. And you think they‚Äôre the same?
I did the same &amp; voted for my fave. None of my top 5 got the nom. Biden is the only other candidate with at least as much name recognition as Trump, which means he has the best chance at beating him. So that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm voting for him, because that‚Äôs what matters most right now.
Cool, but you know that means Trump will win, right? This isn‚Äôt the year to take a stand; we tried and ended up with Biden anyway. Please consider holding the fight off until 2024 so we can get the country closer to where it needs to be, and I promise I‚Äôll be back to joining you.
So... you want to ensure Trump wins by peeling off Biden voters? Because until you commented, I‚Äôd never heard of that candidate, and my guess is, there‚Äôs several million other Americans that haven‚Äôt and won‚Äôt vote for him. Stop sabotaging America.
Sorry you‚Äôd rather have someone actually accused of rape by almost 20 women over someone who‚Äôs bad at respecting space bubbles. And while we‚Äôre comparing, remind me of how many Americans died total due to pandemics under Obama-Biden and how many have died with Trump? Yeah.
1. Biden is not immune, never said he was, just that he‚Äôs better than Trump. 2. Trump will be on the ballot this Nov, and this is the only time I‚Äôve supported VBNMW. 3. We get the country back on track and move further left in 2024.
Not a neoliberal, just don‚Äôt want to let this country continue with Trump. Didn‚Äôt vote for Biden in the primaries, just smart enough to recognize that if I don‚Äôt vote for him, Trump wins. Sorry you haven‚Äôt come to that conclusion yet, hope your vote doesn‚Äôt give Trump the win.
America doesn‚Äôt actually practice democracy. If we did, we wouldn‚Äôt have an electoral system that gives the win to someone who actually lost. And Biden is a far better choice than Trump, hands down.
For this election, anyone is better than Trump. None of my top 5 picks were nominated, so instead I‚Äôm voting for Biden as he‚Äôs the only other candidate with a chance at winning. Keep fighting the good fight, I‚Äôll join again in 2024. But right now, we need Trump out.
That‚Äôs where I‚Äôm at. None of my top five got the nom, but I‚Äôd take Biden over Trump in a heartbeat.
Even if they did have justification, they wouldn't.  They'd roll him out like a Weekend at Bernie's skit before they'd let Pence step in, or his base would collectively lose their sh*t.  Similarly, the Dems would never admit failure with Biden, unless it was the plan all along.
Seeing the reticence to invoke 25A now, what causes you to believe it would happen with Biden?
How in the WORLD ? Is Biden rising in the polls of how he would handle the Coronavirus ????? Truly inaccurate reporting or polls!! What the heck ? I don‚Äôt in ANYWAY agree!!!
Still rather have Biden over Trump. This year we need to #VoteBlueNoMatterWho to ensure we can have an election in 2024, because having Trump get re-elected means we could officially slide into authoritarianism.
As long as he doesn‚Äôt pick someone named Trump or Pence, I‚Äôm still voting for Biden ‚ù§Ô∏è
Biden says Trump executive order is 'a reckless war on Social Security'
Have you loony Libs seen Biden‚Äôs ‚Äúpress‚Äù conferences???
Biden campaigning about returning decency and honesty to the White House proves once again that the last thing Joe Biden is honest. Here he perpetuates a lie debunked years ago.
Why would Joe Biden need a helmet?
Proving yet again that Reliable Sources is anything but reliable. Nearly 40% of the American people believe that Joe Biden is suffering from declining mental faculties.
But if you vote for Creepy Joe Biden aren‚Äôt you doing the same with a mental ill person?
Did trump just bribe (trying to buy) the American people by saying "If I'm victorious on November 3rd, I plan to forgive these taxes and make permanent cuts to the payroll tax," Trump said. "Joe Biden and the Democrats may not want that, they don't want that."
Joe Biden wears a mask while biking... but doesn‚Äôt wear a helmet.   Hey Joe, more than 26,000 U.S. children have been sent to the emergency room for a traumatic brain injury related to bicycle riding.   THIS sums up his mental capacity of Biden right there.
Joe Biden is not the president, genius. He is not an elected official.  Why doesn't your boss tell Moscow Mitch to hold a vote on the bill that passed the House months ago?
I'm blown away that it's come down to Biden vs. Trump, but here we are.  It's the GOP's only play though, because championing Trump but calling Biden out looks like hypocrisy.  They're both relics from another era, and really should never have been considered in the first place.
Biden isn't president and HOLY HELL Trump's entire life is a scam.
Wasn‚Äôt that what Biden‚Äôs sexual assault accuser also said his response was when she rebuffed him? This was well before he ‚Äúcoined the phrase‚Äù.
We have been ever since Trump was installed in office. It‚Äôs been a clown show and Putin‚Äôs been pulling the strings. Can‚Äôt blame China for trying, Russia makes it look easy. Problem is, Biden isn‚Äôt an easy mark like Trump, so all this does is hurt the validity of a win.
And cases will be zero...  You are losing to Biden!!
Problem: Biden thinks Trump supporters read. They don‚Äôt. Therefore with this ad, they only see cars, billboards, and toilet paper.
Trump says Thigh-land, Roasted endlessly, Biden "Accidentally" says blacks are not diverse, Forgiven.All Biden‚Äôs supporters aren‚Äôt pedophiles but they have decided it‚Äôs not a deal breaker.
Great! Biden can haul in what, 25+ that trump sexually assaulted, I‚Äôm sure Stormy would be happy to show up
needs to become Biden‚Äôs AG
Pinata is too polite... Biden is a shit pile and everyone NOW knows it !
Biden says he‚Äôll veto M4A EVEN if it passed Congress. Yet you think voting in progressives, which you admit will be a slow process, &amp; we have seen Dems will fight harder than they ever fought Trump, so it passes Congress will change his mind when 88% of Dems supporting it doesn‚Äôt
Yes, without Biden apologists. Liberals are not the left. Have a good night.
She endorsed Biden when Bernie was still in the race.
I‚Äôm not worried at all for either. Harris is going to chew Pence up and spit him out. I will guarantee you this though, Trump will not stalk Biden like he did Hillary, Biden‚Äôs from Scranton, he‚Äôs still a scrappy dude
The swamp, that's rich. He's put unqualified folk that donated money in positions of power. Devoss is clueless. And what about the unprecedented turnover and unfilled positions?  Imperfect, and yet this started with how Biden is "Imperfect". The mental gymnastics from you üôÑ
NO !  Trump canattackJor Biden's weaknesses which are many,  here's one.
She was acting like a prosecutor making an argument   Biden seems to understand
Biden's grades in class. Repeated 3rd grade, earned all C's and D's in 1st 3 semesters at University of Del. Made a whopping A in P.E. a B in English Writers and an F in ROTC and graduated 76th at Syracuse Law in 85. I had a way better GPA, maybe I should run. lol. Unbelievable.
starting to hope they actually do let Biden debate Trump just so we can get some more gaffe compilation videos
You destroyed 174,000 American lives &amp; the vibrant economy Obama &amp; Biden left in your hands. Yet like everything else you inherit, you've run America into the dirt, &amp; spent more than a full year &amp; $130M on taxpayer funded golfing trips that YOU profited from.
The Dem Party pours $ into fighting/preventing progressives as much as they can. I support all progressive candidates available, but the party fights tooth &amp; nail. We‚Äôre slowly building progressives in Congress despite the party‚Äôs best efforts. Biden won‚Äôt be forced after he wins
Biden can't interfere, right? That's one of my biggest concerns w/ him - kumbaya  days are long over. It will begin w/ DOJ , I hope. No pardons. No deals.
we knew you were cooking up this nonsense. whatever.   BIDEN 2020!
Ummm...Biden ain't winning.   Dems committed political malpractice with this ticket.  He shouldn't win. The put up a guy with severe cognitive issues. It's ridiculous.
81 days until we re-elect the most America loving, NON politician to be  f/four more years. Jobs. Security. Peace in the Middle East. Bringing troops home. Defeated ISIS. Killed Terrorists. Takes on China. IRAN. NOKO.... Obama/Biden committed Treason. That's a nightmare.
I mean, you‚Äôre making my point. Dems ARE in a position to effect change, they CHOOSE not to, why keep supporting them? Also, Biden said it himself. Now, he does have a long history of outright lying (like Trump), so I understand why taking his own word is risky, but still.
Look up his record of success focused on ALL Americans Ms. Swift. Lowest unemployment f/All Americans. Funded historic black colleges, criminal justice reform and so much more.  Biden. Harris.  Phonies. Corrupt Marxists.  Your statements are worthless. Uneducated. Factless.
So you played golf and bashed Biden while your brother was dying. You are an amazing piece of sh*t. Man am I glad I am no relation to you! Bless Robert. So sorry for his passing. üôè
What a tragic and ignorant rant.  Look up President Trump's policies.  All have been good for America after decades of corrupt politicians and 8 years of the traitors Obama/Biden admin who spied on his campaign &amp; attempted a coup d'erat.
Biden love pedophiles its up to you,  thanks
American that vote for Biden you will vote for a not American citizen like Kamara lol
You know the VP basically doesn‚Äôt do anything right?  How desperate is Biden that he is constantly taking about the bottom of the ticket? ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not just me! I picked a girl!‚Äù
Who is going to watch the DNC on Monday? Prediction of this comedy show. Someone who sounds like Biden talks showing him in the basement, Harris will talk too much, AOC gets her 60 seconds of shame and a lot of music. Yawn. lol.

Biden is an equal roadblock, he literally said he‚Äôd veto M4A even if Congress passed it. Dems voted FOR Trump‚Äôs budgets, surveillance powers, judges, Space Force, impeached ONLY on conspiracy against Biden. I‚Äôll give them down ballot votes, chance to prove themselves in Congress
What's this analysis based on? Why would a Biden presidency return more on ave than historical averages? Also a major factor is which party  takes the Senate..What party does the writer affiliate with??
That has nothing to do with biden though
Joe Biden isn‚Äôt ideal but if he doesn‚Äôt take the opportunity to host briefings and press conferences in a casual morning environment drinking coffee and calling it ‚ÄúA Cup of Joe with Joe‚Äù I will RIOT
Millions out of work and facing eviction/foreclosure, 170,000 dead from COVID-19, a POTUS openly trying to suppress the vote, out of control debt...  GOP answer: Biden‚Äôs a socialist!
Same goes for Biden.
I am proud that we have such a great breadth of Democratic leaders.  The candidates who ran against Biden, all of the women who were considered for VP, our honestly impressive Congress people.  They have Trump.  The rest of the GOP went to sleep.
Can Joe Biden "Thread the Needle" Among Democrats?
A Snowden pardon would be wonderful. What can Biden offer in response for the progressives in his party?
Sanders EARNED delegates for the convention. Biden also won more delegates. The convention is where the nominee becomes official. Don‚Äôt worry. You‚Äôll get your crappy centrist candidate &amp; a platform that doesn‚Äôt include M4A, despite these votes. They still earned a voice there.

Sounds like he's endorsing Biden.
I do not support rapist, racist war mongers, which is why I am just as likely to vote trump as I am biden. How about you try building an argument FOR your candidate, instead of against the other one.
Actually, he is more favored to win then against Hillary. His favorability is higher than Obama at this stage in his presidency.  Liberals are lurching too far left. People will begrudgingly vote Trump in order to not have Biden.

we don't care if she had botched her presidential run.  Biden won.  ALL the other candidates lost. we are thrilled at the ticket.  they compliment each other.  and they will be the next president and vice president of the US.
I confess I'm torn. A big part of me wants the Republicans to keep the Senate to check a Biden presidency. But a big part of me wants to see a total reset of the Republican Party. Every possible outcome is largely bad. And anyway the outcome doesn't depend on what I think.
It's not as simple as "just elect Democrats". That's a good place to start. But we can't make the mistake of folding up shop &amp; going home after the election is over: that's where the hardest work begins.

I will grant you that a majority of people who identify as liberals ..sadly myself included, only complain when It is a Republican (is Trump really a real Republican??!) It's a serious concern for me as We get closer to the election, that if Biden wins we won't complain as much.

FYI: Trump just handed Biden/Harris a golden goose on a silver platter when he tried to destroy the USPS. No matter your political affiliation millions of Americans and businesses depend on the USPS and they will protest against this to the ninth degree.
This is the best argument I've heard. Basically we are voting for who we want to fight. Do you want to fight against Trump or fight against Biden. The claim is it's easier to fight with Biden than it is with Trump. And if Biden wins his supporters will realize nothing has changed
I wouldn't leave Biden to walk my dog. The guy isn't fit for the job.

No amount of Trump being bad makes Biden any better. They are both horrible picks for leadership and the public keeps allowing it to happen by voting for it. A 3rd party can win if people were smart enough to vote for them. That‚Äôs the only way we fix it.

They know it's their best chance for continued injustice. Biden may not be in favor of defunding the police but that administration will be way more apt to hold cops accountable for misdeeds.

Excellent point. By choosing Biden/Harris he has shown Trump/Pence that he is no friend of theirs. Huge mistake by Leo. I thought he had more political savvy than to pick a winner in the US. He also is too chummy with the Chinese Communists. Another bad decision.

The nasty memes of Harris began the moment Biden picked her to be his running mate.  This ad targets people in their mid-thirties. It hits Trump hard because it is exactly who he is.
Biden also openly called for the arrest of anarchists. I agree with your assessment, the democrats are 2016 Republicans. They just are not loud and crude.
They only impeached him for going after biden. They had no mention of the crimes he has committed. If they really wanted to impeach AND remove him, they would've made a case with teeth.

The point is that Trump is so horrible, that electing Biden, pushes voters to the left in that environment, rather than turning hippies into Qanon supporters &amp; hyper racist Trump supporters.
Does she still support Biden‚Äôs sexual assault victims??
An you say Sexual Predator?? Oh yea you already called Biden your mate that!! ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
I buy that there‚Äôs an upper bound on elasticity at some point, maybe somewhere around Biden +15, where the logic of the spreadsheet may start to break down. I just don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs unique to Utah. It‚Äôs entirely possible that after Alaska, there‚Äôs a fairly strict cutoff line.
No dude. I didn't say women and Democrats are the same thing. I said Democrats were telling us to believe women until Joe Biden came along.  Sorry if understanding how subordinate clauses work is hard.
Joe Biden has less than a snowball's chance in HELL of being President with Harris! That seals it!
#Biden-Harris #blm #Fuc*Trump. Yeah I‚Äôm ‚Äúcrimson and clover ‚Äú
The fact the Democrats are manufacturing &amp; rigging this whole election process proves to you the pathetic jerks they are!  NO one in their right mind would nominate Joe Biden.   Dems are doubling down as they always do! He's going to lose &amp; it's guaranteed with Harris! Book IT!
Biden does look stupid and Lost! Why are they doing this?  Why not just give the nomination to Harris to begin with and quit this stupid Smoke &amp; Mirrors act!
Be real for a second, what if Obama of Clinton, or Biden drove up to Montana or Texas and started grabbing people off the street in unmarked cars who they thought might be up to something. Would you rubbed stamp that shit or would you call it unAmerica &amp; fascist? Honest question.
Kamala Harris goes from accusing Joe Biden of being a rapist and racist to excitedly accepting to work for him. Which one is it? #Hypocrite
Biden staff herds compliant press away from candidate  via
So much easier to claim Biden has no policies
We're 159 days from the inauguration. Take note of what Trump &amp; his puppeteers are already doing to prevent Joe Biden from being inaugurated. Do you seriously think there is a limit to what they'll do between now and January 20? Mail-tampering is only a beginning.
ABC is so out of touch they don't even understand the difference between absentee and mail in and Trumps constant defense of absentee. ABC is as out of it as Joe Biden üòÜ
I take no joy in voting for Biden, but Trump is pushing us towards authoritarianism... the choice is pretty simple, suck it up like me and vote Dem for once. The Republicans aren't even Republican anymore, they are The Party of Trump.
He got a literal Sunrise Movement member and AOC in talks with Biden, among many other things.
I keep thinking how hilarious it would be if Trump just called them the Biden Child Cages
So funny Kumalot, let‚Äôs see how much you laugh when you and Babbling Biden lose come November.
This woman HAS to end up in the West Wing with Biden. And when she does we best be holding her accountable for nonsense like this.
‚ÄúBiden believes the Green New Deal is a crucial framework for meeting the climate challenges we face.‚Äù
80 days before Harris/ Biden vs Trump/Pence election. will it America be great again or will we be held hostage the next 4 years. Where is Hunter and Biden is the most racist person on earth. Just saying.
Barack Hussein Obama would like you to vote before the debates reveal Biden‚Äôs true level of mental deficiency.
Correction: BLM single handedly donates $48MM to Biden's campaign
While I agree that "Blue No Matter Who" in the presidential race is important, being hostile towards people with legitimate concerns about Biden/Harris isn't going to get them on your side.
I won‚Äôt survive it. üò•üò•üò•. Biden and Harris will win. We will vote even if we have to walk over hot coals or broken glass in our bare feet. We will vote and we will get rid of these criminals!
...and their union with 300,000 members just endorsed #Biden
Oh, I don't just mean interjecting on on political opinions, I mean potentially holding an office in the Biden Administration. Clinton and Biden go back a long way politically.Love  plus all the ones listed. Also love satire that the left doesn‚Äôt understand..so  really confuses people. Love that he calls Biden, Joel and says Tyler Swift.
Tensions linger between Biden and Obama camps throughout 2020 primary campaign: report    Obama says the nicest things about ‚Å¶
What‚Äôs exciting about Biden?
For the liberals who say ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt vote Biden/Harris‚Äù Please consider this document I made detailing how Trump/Pence will different from   on immigration alone.  Biden/Harris are way closer to our ideal
Biden to Sanders:
Talk about corrupt as Joe Biden and of course his running mate
Rebuttals:  1. Harris and Biden have repeatedly shown that they are pro-police and are unwilling to enact meaningful reform (example: thousands of people Harris had arrested for Marijuana related crimes and Biden‚Äôs ‚Äúshoot them in the legs instead‚Äù statements regarding protestors
Are you suggesting that Biden wasn't referring to us all sleeping and showering with masks on?
Biden calls for mandate requiring all Americans to wear masks    How do you spell mask ‚Å¶ ?
I thought you were 100 % against Biden
You should run against Biden
Kamala hated Biden not too long ago
This is my own fault for not reading this fully until now, but I really do endorse this plan. More progressive than I gave it credit. ‚Å¶  #BidenHarris2020   The Biden Plan for Securing Our Values as a Nation of Immigrants ‚Äì
Ummm..you do realize Biden doesn‚Äôt write his tweets..right?
Everybody together, NOW!  Biden-Harris, yes!!!
Sounds like to 2016 Joe Biden is the worst candidate even worse than Hillary Clinton
Susan Rice hints at possible Biden administration role while touting Harris pick    Liar (A) supporting of Liar (B) ü§£
Why Kamala Harris VP pick could cost Biden the election  #FoxBusiness What do you might??!! It will definitely cost him!!
Trump says 'suburban housewife' will vote for him over Biden, cites low-income housing policies   Did ‚Å¶ ask ‚Å¶ first before he made this decision?? ‚Å¶
Please stop!  This is Trumps America right now and you are not doing your job.  Unrest can‚Äôt work, can‚Äôt travel can‚Äôt even hug my parents. This is not a TV show this is people‚Äôs lives and you have not done your job. Vote Joe Biden and 1st woman VP Kamala Harris.
Is this all you can come up with. VOTE Joe Biden.
A vote for anyone but Biden/Harris is a vote for Trump/Pence. Period. You don't have to vote for Biden... but you should know if you do not you are voting for Trump. Work to reform the system in 86 days... for 2020 the math doesn't work any other way.
Nah I think about that all the time. Imagine a UHC system where you don‚Äôt have to worry about that. I get about thinking about now. I‚Äôll be honest I just don‚Äôt trust Biden that he‚Äôll do the right thing. He‚Äôs taking a lot of money from the insurance companies
If  is not AG or a Supreme Court Justice (provided a Biden win), then something is wrong. üòí
Biden's going to need a food tester, isn't he?
Congratulations, Ms Harris!!! You have my vote!! Biden has my vote but you made it all the better!!!! Biden/Harris 2020!!!!!!!
Sealed the deal for a giant loss. Wow Joe you are confused.  Biden taps Kamala Harris as running mate, setting aside tensions from primary
Excited to vote for Biden/Harris 2020
Here we go! #VoteBlue2020 #BidenHarris2020
If anyone says Biden‚Äôs lost their vote because of the choice, then we deserve a Trump dictatorship. ü§Æ This is an important pick, but getting rid of 45 is more important than anyone‚Äôs feelings. Country or personal preference? It‚Äôs that simple.
This is the only VP tweet I‚Äôm liking today. Hope Biden waits until at least tomorrow to announce.
It's called comedy! I find both skits about Trump and Biden very funny! Being that your father was my inspiration for becoming a comic, lighten up! It's what comedy is all about!
But he says they‚Äôre all his buddies! They get along great. Private calls with Putin and no need to reveal the discussions? They‚Äôre coordinating dirt on Biden. He asked the Ukraine as well. Believe what you investigate not what you hear or see on TV.
More for a Biden loss, but his take surprised me a bit too.
Bullshit Obama and Joe Biden almost ran Social Security still was broke
Black male leaders warn Biden ‚Äòwill lose‚Äô election if he doesn't name Black female running mate   ‚Å¶ is going to lose the election if he runs with a chimpanzee!
Since when is God pro-guns? Asking for a friend. #DemocratsArePatrioticToo #GodTalk
CNN‚Äôs Brian Stelter called out over 'tone-deaf' criticism of conservative media for questioning Joe Biden‚Äôs mental health   ‚Å¶ is a pathetic moron!
Hillary Clinton says Biden needs to consider three things when choosing a VP    Not #CrookedHillary (‚Å¶ on the other hand, it might be good, after all you know how to lose. ‚Å¶ 45üá∫üá∏
The Republicans during the last election basically said having character is not a prerequisite for President. Remember ‚Äúgrab‚Äôem by the p___y‚Äù and making fun of the handicap gentlemen? So why do they now keep throwing up Biden character issues? Like that‚Äôs ever mattered to them.
‚ÄúEntire media companies essentially exist just to tear down Joe Biden, is there an equivalent on the left, tearing down Trump?‚Äù I don‚Äôt know how you kept a straight face when you said that. CNN is the 24/7 bash Trump fake news outlet king of them all. You lying hypocrite.
There‚Äôs no comparison Trump is so much smarter and so much more together and he made America great and he‚Äôs gonna make America great even better now let‚Äôs see what Joel Biden have done for 40 years besides become very rich
It shows you know nothing about Social Security Obama and Biden took money out of Social Security and Medicare to pay for Obamacare
That‚Äôs a lie they got their special interest open borders abortion free make up for illegals love with Biden 40 years besides become very wealthyOn the American people
If Joe Biden gets in there he‚Äôs gonna raise taxes on every American so he can feel his own pocket like he‚Äôs been doing for 40 years vote for Biden is voting for socialism communismAnd I‚Äôll open borders destroy the country
Voting for Biden isn‚Äôt even a vote for Biden.  He is the billboard, not the messenger.
You are a ignorant as they come.  Go ahead vote for Biden, the dementia candidate.
Biden is a sick, demented old person. TRUMP2020 is coming. Get your hankie ready.
Biden can't even tie his shoes alone anymore.   TRUMP2020 TRUMP2020 TRUMP2020 TRUMP2020
Maxine Waters: Biden ‚Äòcan‚Äôt go home without a Black woman being VP‚Äô    Because Maxine Waters said so?
Why are Biden's gaffs held to a real presidential standard and Trump's gaffs ignored /memed /excused / laughed at? Says a lot about who we think is actually presidential/
No way Biden wins in a fair election.  If Biden wins then the elites have successfully taken over elections and power.  You‚Äôll never see a GOP President or Congress again and the USA as founded is finished.
