And  knows all about what Russia is doing! He's helping out Russia along side of Rudy Giuliani! Ron &amp; gang spent 4th of July over there two years ago! So yes, there is a cabal working tirelessly to try to stop Biden! Guess they're scared! Good.
Let's ask  He must know. After all, he is working with Russia and Putin to deliver DJT! Why did Ron and gang spend 4th of July in Russia? I'd like to know that.  You're looking for Biden dirt. Makes you a dirtbag!
Internals must be bad. No way they‚Äôd acknowledge the economy if they thought they had a chance for senate majority/ Biden winning.
Biden Tells Staffers To Pick Any Black Person For VP 'Since They All Think The Same Anyway'
Sent you a DM with link to kzillion Biden memes. Enjoy.
No one:  Absolutely no one:   Not one single soul:   Joe Biden: ARE YOU A JUNKIE?!
‚ÄúListen, bucko!‚Äù Biden yelled, jabbing his finger at the pigeon. ‚ÄúI get tested every day! You hear me? Why are you just bobbing your head around? Are you some sort of junkie?‚Äù
Don‚Äôt forget the time he said: If you have problems voting for me or Trump, then you‚Äôre not black. And the one where he said: What are you, a junkie? Biden answers with racist comments when he doesn‚Äôt want to tell the truth.
It don't think Biden would like his age and cognitive decline to be the reason for stepping down. It's better for his legacy to compete the term and act like he never wanted to be president, that it was only out of duty and love for his country to save it from Trumpism.
Just appoint a team of advisors to vote on decisions for Biden to make.
Why would they want to replace Biden?
How has this pandemic and economic crisis affected your ability to work effectively as a collaborator with the rest of the DNC to insure Joe Biden is the next POTUS!?!?!?
boosting youth voter turnout by reminding them that Biden ran for president before any of them were born
So many ‚Äúgood‚Äù Christians speaking out about Biden cherry picking biblical law and not owning up all the other laws they‚Äôve set aside is ridiculous. Especially Matthew 7:1-5.
I really cannot understand the BernieBros who are labeling Biden as tRump2 &amp; refusing to vote for him. Seriously idiots? Can you not see that if tRump is re-elected, if there‚Äôs any doubt abt a Biden victory, that tRump/Barr will almost literally burn it all down? ü§¨
I think Biden will need to pick Angela Freaking Davis to overcome all his past--and future!--racially tone-deaf gaffes.
Joe Biden is a cave man üëåüèª
You idiots. Biden is not tRump2. 4 more yrs of tRump means SCOTUS &amp; courts loaded with RWNJ judges, putting progressive policies out of reach for another generation. It means you may not be able to vote at all in 2024. It means intensified persecution of LBGTQ &amp; immigrants. ü§¨
Trump used a photo of Biden praying to make him look weak.
The news media is covering for Biden. I have started to notice articles saying debates are not necessary. They realize the less we see of Joe the better...
Joe Biden has no clue what it takes to rebuild the economy  ‚ùåAs VP, he oversaw the SLOWEST recovery since the Great Depression  ‚ùåToday's jobs gain is 3X better than any gain while Biden was VP  President Trump built the greatest economy in history once &amp; he's doing it again!üöÄ
Plus, If you voted for Bill Clinton or Barack Obama, you can vote for Joe Biden.  Hell, Dr. Angela Davis is voting for Joe Biden.
Biden walks back African American 'diversity' remarks, lauds community's 'diversity of thought'
Explain ‚Ä¶ what exactly?  Most of these are extremely reasonable, especially when you know that he has a mild stutter.  Also, criticizing Biden for "not talk too good" while supporting Trump is *really rich*.
I'm starting to wonder if Sleepy Joe Hidin Biden is waiting to officially announce his VP pick until after so many absentee ballots and early votes are cast.

I guess we'll see how Biden handles it but I doubt he'll have much of a different approach honestly
Joe Biden is a fucking idiot
Lolololo.   Wait.   Hahahahahah.    Sorry.  Lol.  Ok. Lol. Haha.  Seriously .  You think Biden corrected his statement?
I actually don‚Äôt care if Trump or Biden mispronounce a word or a name. Mispronunciations happens. I opppse Trump because he has terrible policies.
Joe Biden: "are you a junkie?"  c'mon man, geez.   CC
I drafted a tweet in response to Biden's gaffe originally, but figured it wouldn't get any attention. Only responding now because there's real differences in policy behind whatever Conway's throwing out.
Joe Biden shouldn't call people junkies. Am I shocked that he did? Absolutely not. Has he been awful, re: drug policy in the past? Oh, yes.   Which administration would be better for people with SUD, Trump 2020 or Biden 2020?  That's super easy.
1. Biden refers to people as junkies  2. Trump praises Duterte, who has people who use drugs killed  Hmmmmmm

When your grandma dies of covid, "the Lord works in mysterious ways."  Thought of Biden being President, "will hurt God."   Nothing can hurt God. If Biden wins it's part of His plans.
Lol I'm not the one taking soundbites then twisting into some delusion of insanity. Trump has aced his cognitive assessment test every time meanwhile Biden refuses saying it's asking a coke addict to take a drug test though he doesn't say it as coherent.
ok im not saying I like biden or anything, but what if i also want to hurt god
BIDEN WILL HURT BIBLE. AND GOD!!!!!!
"ouchie"- God at Biden
Paid for by Biden's Alzeimer Fund.
That's Biden not Trump.

Biden refuses to take the test. Trump took it and passed.
The best part about a Biden-Harris ticket will be Porter in the Senate.
Watching people that I feel like I would like in real life try to create the perfect character for seeing Biden as irredeemable is painful to watch. Since I, too, have an online problem, I sometimes feel like Tom Hanks to Leo DiCaprio in "Catch Me if You Can".
This statement, like biden, won‚Äôt age well
Joe Biden is the only choice. We must defeat Trump at all costs.
Biden fans aren't on the left.
John McCain was the Republican‚Äôs Joe Biden, only difference was a war hero and Purple Heart. Neither were ever correct and always self serving.
Ssoooo....who ya GONNA vote for?????.....given that, in these dirty life and times, a vote for ANYONE other than Biden is a vote for Drumpf!?!?!?! (no self-righteous sanctimony allowed in your reply----IF THERE IS ONE!?!?!)

It‚Äôs going to get ugly when this starts playing on tv constantly. It‚Äôs from Biden‚Äôs speech on the 1994 crime bill witch is literally everything #BlackLivesMatter is protesting against. He wrote the whole thing.
What- he thinks Biden will see God walking down the street and try to run Him over with his Camaro?
We need to stand against Trump's racism! ..with Biden's racism?
Anyone who voted for Biden might as well be working for Trump.

A few months ago, Biden told Black Americans they "ain't Black" if they don't support him, implying all Black Americans must think the same.  Today, he said the quiet part out loud.
These are not gaffes.   When Joe Biden said the Black community doesn‚Äôt have diversity of thought, he was clearly just saying what he thinks.  That‚Äôs why he told Black voters they ‚Äúain‚Äôt Black‚Äù it they don‚Äôt vote for him.
Many of the K voters in NH seemed more wishy-washy last minute decision voters but I can‚Äôt get over the Beto stans pinning all the blame on Pete months later for B dropping out, they came around quickly for Biden while still spewing all sorts of nonsense about Pete‚Äôs campaign.

Corvettes -- the car older older men who are overcompensating for at least one thing. In Biden's case, it's probably 3 or more.
You could have saved a lot of words and just said: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm butthurt my candidate didn‚Äôt win, so I am gonna do my best to sabotage Joe Biden‚Äù.
üó£Ô∏è Americans deserve to watch Joe Biden &amp; President Trump debate before they cast their ballots.   Pass it on.
Joe Biden told Black Americans they ‚Äúain‚Äôt black‚Äù if they don‚Äôt vote for him.  Joe Biden accused a Black journalist of being a junkie because he asked him a question he didn‚Äôt like.  Joe Biden said Black Americans are all the same.
There is zero chance he'll be at Biden's inauguration. Hopefully because he'll be getting cuffed and taken to a NY jail cell.
Good Morning to everyone except Joe Biden, who called President Trump‚Äôs life-saving China travel restrictions ‚Äúxenophobic‚Äù and opposed them for months.  Experts credit the President‚Äôs decision with saving countless lives.
OMG, I'm turning into Biden! Yep, time to start my political career. Lol
Even with a Biden loving/Trump hating moderator panel, I don't think there is enough they could do to save Joe in a debate... could let Joe do most of the talking and win easily.  Joe's going to finish himself if they debate at all.
TBH, I think it's appropriate for Republicans to be questioning Biden's mental acuity. I hate that we're, yet again, stuck picking between two old white men.
Revolutionary Communist Party Endorses Joe Biden - Sara A. Carter
A whopping 33 people tuned in to watch Joe Biden ask a Black journalist if he was ‚Äúa junkie‚Äù in response to a question about taking a cognitive test.  I for one, am shocked.
Joe Biden bizarrely lashed out at a Black reporter, asked him if he was a junkie, &amp; struggled to finish his sentence.  "Oh well just Joe being Joe!" shrugs the media who has given this almost no coverage.  IMAGINE the coverage if this were President Trump.
Joe Biden wants to allow illegal immigrants to flood across US borders without consequence.  This is no longer just a security issue, it's a health issue.  President Trump's strong border policies have protected the health and safety of Americans during the coronavirus crisis.
or arrested/indicted after Biden takes the oath of office!
I feel the same. trump has been sucking the oxygen out of the country forever. Biden needs to stop teasing this and announce already. This news cycle of trump's choosing needs to change.
. on cognitive test: Why would I take a test?
He doesn't know the 2nd highest ranking Republican in the Senate? Is he that uninformed or cognitive decline? Imagine Biden asking if Dick Durbin is a Democrat

A six-part thread on what to expect from President Biden‚Äôs first 100 days:
The debates, as organized by the media, would be stacked against Trump. But Biden‚Äôs deficiencies might still make it worthwhile for Trump. It‚Äôs hard to say. It‚Äôs obvious the media are not interested in fairness. Will they offer an unacceptable deal and blame Trump for refusing?
And you‚Äôd say, ‚ÄúHoney, I have no idea.‚Äù Then you push up off the couch and walk down to the taco truck that had been installed by federal law on your corner‚Äîand every US street corner‚Äîon the first day of the Biden administration for a late night snack. /END
The next night, your partner would do the crossword while you read Karl Knausgaard‚Äîthere were after all no juicy tell-alls from the Biden White House in sight‚Äîand your partner would say, ‚ÄúWho is the Secretary of State these days? We hear so little from them I can‚Äôt remember.‚Äù
Undecided's break quite heavily for Biden though.
Trump's average is around 40 %. It's Biden's average they're bringing down.
This coordinates with my experience and also with a podcast by The Daily in which a political journalist suspected that all Biden needs to do to win is stay the fuck out of the news for the next few months

Johnathan, if one person criticizes Biden and someone else responds by saying that Trump is "worse", that's called a "comparison"  I've attached the definitions of both the noun "comparison" and the verb "to compare" for clarity
Johnathan, I don‚Äôt know if you know this but in November there will be an election where voters will have to between ‚ÄúJoe Biden‚Äù and ‚ÄúDonald Trump‚Äù. That‚Äôs why people always compare the two  Hope this clears things up for you
misstatements with real-world consequences vs. disingenuous agonizing over biden's junkie comment today (which was bad, but still)

It‚Äôs different because Biden, pelosi, Omar families are involved in criminal acts. Trumps family is clean. They have been the most investigated family ever and... nothing. The Dems keep making stuff up, cuz nothing. Russia, Ukraine..Projection.

My worry is Trump will drop out before the election and someone else becomes the candidate.  The whole focus to get rid of Trump is gone and Biden will have to use something else than "I'm Not Trump".  The Republicans helping to remove Trump join the other side.
Unfortunately I‚Äôm not sure Trump is going to lose. Biden is not a strong candidate. His VP choice is important because many voters not affiliated with either party that vote either way may see that person as having a real chance to be President due to Biden‚Äôs age.
Biden also is a puppet.

It's funny because you think the picture of Biden shows weakness.   I know it's foreign to you but that is called empathy. Look it up.
And so the Democrats' goal-post shifting begins.  Americans deserve to know the results of the Presidential election on election night - not days, weeks, or months later.   Joe Biden &amp; the Democrats' plot for universal mail-in ballots will create confusion and chaos.

There‚Äôs no chance of a single thing changing in a more progressive direction if tRump is re-elected. In fact, this country will be done. Fascism &amp; authoritarianism will win the day &amp; the immense future. A Biden win with the progressive wing behind him gives us a chance.

This is certainly frightening out of context, but I think we're jumping to conclusions on the anarchist bit. Liberals think that anarchism is just about breaking things. While I have no doubt Biden would support the blanket oppression of anarchists, he's not calling for it here.

I have great confidence a Biden Administration will be 1000x better than a second Trump term for the climate, and get the U.S. ( and hopefully nudge China) on trajectories that avoid worst case scenarios.
Right, but what is "technically" worse? Trump is worse in a variety of ways, but when I say Biden's worse, I'm just talking consequences. I'm talking about the overall direction of the country. Biden is kicking that vicious cycle into overdrive and it's going to be bad.
Especially because it's all lies. Biden's a white supremacist the left will have zero influence over, and Democrats like him have been incrementally making the country worse for the past forty years.
Biden's platform is by far the most left-wing in Dem history. The Intercept/DN/red rose folks are really in a huge bubble that sees "enemies everywhere." That an outside entity making trolly ads against your opponent represents some "quid pro quo" is Breitbart level quackery.

Democrats like Biden are the reason our politics are so far right. We're better off with Trump, until Democrats become an actual opposition party.

I think it's become blatantly fucking obvious that I need to learn more about politics and history. I think my reasoning is that a Biden presidency will be a slightly less hostile environment for leftist action. I also think Biden could expose the failings of liberalism.
I don't even know anymore today. I'm STRUGGLING to rationalize voting for Biden. I would say that Trump is a bonafide fascist tho, he pretty much ticks every box. Biden's history does thoroughly disgust me though
Good point, I'll still vote Biden, but I'd love to organize. I'm still new to politics so I'd love some resources on that.
It's disheartening because so many people seemingly disregard how utterly destructive another 4 years of trump would be. I'm not the least bit excited about Biden let's alone kopmala. I just don't think I can call myself an antifascist if I don't vote against the fascist.

All the drama around the Ron Johnson attempt to use his committee to smear Biden seems like a proxy struggle for the control and future direction of the GOP.

Clinton County Democratic Party Chair Jerry Marking was pleased with Tuesday's news that former Vice President Joe Biden had tapped U.S. Sen. Kamala Harris as his running mate.
I feel like the biden campaign is entirely built on looking at what the people actually want and then hand-wringing and saying "what about the right? we gotta appeal to the centre more"
No, it does include inferring based on past actions.  What did Biden do as VP for 8 years?
Biden will also continue accelerating the crisis. He has no plans to actually follow through on his promise.
So that fits perfectly then. right? Cuz that's the same percentage change we will get with Biden.
It's the same script whether it's Bernie or a centrist like Kamala or Biden or Obama. Socialist communist marxist stalinist fascist radical. Words have no meaning.

President Biden,  Please double back on Russia.  Stop their advances north to the Arctic.  Sanction them until Putin is overthrown.  They are more of a threat to world peace than anyone, and they're not smart.
I said this yesterday. Allowing Trump on a stage with Biden only elevates Trump. Trump has nothing to offer on policy that is fact driven. He will lie and fear monger. That‚Äôs all he is capable of doing. He has no 2nd term agenda goals to explain.  Seriously- Why bother?

Don‚Äôt hold your breath if Biden/Harris get elected. Simply the better choice between two bad choices. We need progressives.
Biden boxed himself in by saying he would only pick a woman. You should keep your options open when picking a VP. Biden got too caught up in trying to be "progressive".
If Kamala were to become president after Biden dies or retires for health reasons Kamala then has the power to appoint someone to the office of vice president subject to approval by congress.
You don't have 2 vote for Biden :)

Biden can't be trusted near a mic either. But DNC is trash so what can we expect?
Remember when Kamala Harris basically called Biden a racist in the first debate lmao
Remember a sane Joe Biden, would never pick the Joker to be his number 2. Kamala is as ambitious as Hillary but homicidal and not a suiciding bitch
The most pro-abortion presidential ticket in history.

how biden choosing kamala harris as his vp in this climate is beyond tone deaf. acab.
Called it. Biden/Harris 2020.
Would have given me one more reason not to support Tulsi rather than a reason to support Biden TBH.  Would rather Tulsi distance herself from the DNC and be the bastion of the center that we need.
there is truly no such thing as the perfect candidate &amp; there NEVER HAS BEEN. bernie fully supported the nra. pres. obama worsened the middle east crisis and thousands of innocent civilians died bc of it. clinton. i would love if biden/harris wasn‚Äôt our best option but they are
PHUCK YEAH!!!  BIDEN/HARRIS 2020!!!
Make no mistake‚ÄîBiden and Harris represent the lesser of two horrible options. The people have no power. The election became rigged so that Bernie couldn‚Äôt win it. Sanders and Yang were the only 2 candidates who truly care.
"If elected, this weak Democratic duo will aid and abet the radical socialists and anarchists at every turn.   Americans must reject Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, and their dangerous ideology."
While the country protests for justice reform, Biden selects someone with the mindset of someone they're protesting against. Awesome
Kamala Harris believes Joe Biden's accusers.   "I believe them and I respect them being able to tell their story and having the courage to do it..."

I'm sure I'll regret these words, but the way things are going with covid and the economy, Biden could pick Saddam Fidel Hitler as his running mate and still probably win. All he has to do is sit back and let Trump keep killing himself.
Biden narrowed his choices when he said he would pick a woman. But Kamala? I don't see her as a way to "reach out." Judging from how she behaved as CA's AG and a senator, she's the Left's chaperone for Biden.
Biden really chose Kamala the cop as his VP üôÉ

Plus, If you voted for Bill Clinton or Barack Obama, you can vote for Joe Biden.  Hell, Dr. Angela Davis is voting for Joe Biden.
Biden walks back African American 'diversity' remarks, lauds community's 'diversity of thought'
Explain ‚Ä¶ what exactly?  Most of these are extremely reasonable, especially when you know that he has a mild stutter.  Also, criticizing Biden for "not talk too good" while supporting Trump is *really rich*.
I'm starting to wonder if Sleepy Joe Hidin Biden is waiting to officially announce his VP pick until after so many absentee ballots and early votes are cast.
Uh oh! Cleanup on aisle Biden ü§™
Biden should use eminent domain to turn Mar A Lago into a national historic site and the actual southern white house, a la Camp David.
Is there anything logical about Biden running for president? Looks like elderly abuse üòü
The best part: looks like even senile Biden is doing better than Hillary ü§£ how low can she go ü§£
Several sources tell me that Joe Biden's VP is still a tossup.
New add! Biden doesn‚Äôt represent the good parts of America.  When will he do a real interview? Someone ask him about Byrd, and Ukraine.
seems like we getting some mixed signals, his staff walked back his comments
I guess we'll see how Biden handles it but I doubt he'll have much of a different approach honestly
Joe Biden is a fucking idiot
Lolololo.   Wait.   Hahahahahah.    Sorry.  Lol.  Ok. Lol. Haha.  Seriously .  You think Biden corrected his statement?
I actually don‚Äôt care if Trump or Biden mispronounce a word or a name. Mispronunciations happens. I opppse Trump because he has terrible policies.
Joe Biden: "are you a junkie?"  c'mon man, geez.   CC
I drafted a tweet in response to Biden's gaffe originally, but figured it wouldn't get any attention. Only responding now because there's real differences in policy behind whatever Conway's throwing out.
Joe Biden shouldn't call people junkies. Am I shocked that he did? Absolutely not. Has he been awful, re: drug policy in the past? Oh, yes.   Which administration would be better for people with SUD, Trump 2020 or Biden 2020?  That's super easy.
1. Biden refers to people as junkies  2. Trump praises Duterte, who has people who use drugs killed  Hmmmmmm

BBC News - #US election 2020: #Trump says opponent #Biden will 'hurt God'  How can any person of faith support this horror show?  stands for nothing that any faith holds dear.
When your grandma dies of covid, "the Lord works in mysterious ways."  Thought of Biden being President, "will hurt God."   Nothing can hurt God. If Biden wins it's part of His plans.
ok im not saying I like biden or anything, but what if i also want to hurt god
BIDEN WILL HURT BIBLE. AND GOD!!!!!!
"ouchie"- God at Biden
The best part about a Biden-Harris ticket will be Porter in the Senate.
Watching people that I feel like I would like in real life try to create the perfect character for seeing Biden as irredeemable is painful to watch. Since I, too, have an online problem, I sometimes feel like Tom Hanks to Leo DiCaprio in "Catch Me if You Can".
This statement, like biden, won‚Äôt age well
Joe Biden is the only choice. We must defeat Trump at all costs.
Biden fans aren't on the left.
John McCain was the Republican‚Äôs Joe Biden, only difference was a war hero and Purple Heart. Neither were ever correct and always self serving.
Ssoooo....who ya GONNA vote for?????.....given that, in these dirty life and times, a vote for ANYONE other than Biden is a vote for Drumpf!?!?!?! (no self-righteous sanctimony allowed in your reply----IF THERE IS ONE!?!?!)
Biden will give his speech sitting on the can
here we go: all the never trump "resistance" grifters are getting ready to stab biden in the back
god is dead by joe biden's hands
Because we would vote for Joe Biden‚Äôs corpse before you.
'No, Joe! Spit It Out!' Shout Aides As Biden Takes Huge Bite Out Of Cognitive Test
Biden raises eyebrows with remark contrasting African American, Latino diversity
never seem willing to offer an opinion on which man, Trump or Biden, is better suited to serve as the president over the next four years...
It‚Äôs going to get ugly when this starts playing on tv constantly. It‚Äôs from Biden‚Äôs speech on the 1994 crime bill witch is literally everything #BlackLivesMatter is protesting against. He wrote the whole thing.
What- he thinks Biden will see God walking down the street and try to run Him over with his Camaro?
We need to stand against Trump's racism! ..with Biden's racism?
Anyone who voted for Biden might as well be working for Trump.

Biden done got too comfortable riding Obama wave. He really be trying us
