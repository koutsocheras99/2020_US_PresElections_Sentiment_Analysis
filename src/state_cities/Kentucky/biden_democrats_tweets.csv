I truly can‚Äôt trust anyone that thinks Joe Biden is a better candidate for president over Trump. Ignorance is bliss.
Purely interested: where do you stand on the idea of Harris being Biden‚Äôs VP pick? I personally think she‚Äôs the best choice.
Never has there been so much interest in the VP. It‚Äôs a decision made primarily by the DNC to attract the most voters considering various demographics. Obama probably didn‚Äôt even know Biden. You think McCain chose idiot newcomer Sarah Palin?

Who ever is the VP pick is the candidate... Biden can't string 10 words together any more ... They have to keep him quiet... He can only ruin his chances of he does much talking ...
No. But all racists might be republicans.  I assume the many ex-republicans now swearing to vote for Joe Biden are not, imo so it kind of holds that not all are racist.
supporting Biden? He's Senile and a Racist!
Biden is nothing more than a Liar and a Racist! and he's Senile too!
yes, she‚Äôs incredibly critical of Biden (rightfully so) ‚Äî however seeing as he is now the Dem nominee, her argument for how people who refused to vote for Hillary cost us the election still applies. It‚Äôs wildly fascinating!!
Don‚Äôt be so hard on Moscow Mitch aka 3 Martini Mitch. We know he has no courage to be a man and takes his marching orders from Trump, who takes his orders from Putin. VOTE BIDEN AND AMY.

Keep trying Kamala. You already let America know you‚Äôre a racist. Two racist running together. How stupid do you think the USA is?  Kamala: his evidence to free black men. Free labor she said.  Biden: white kids going to school with black kids would create a racial jungle
I think we should start demanding to be polled and not the same 1,100-1,500 for these imaginary polls that say Biden is winning in the polls nonsense.  Biden couldn‚Äôt beat himself out of a wet paper bag let along best  in a debate or voting.  #VoteTrumpToSaveAmerica

Are you a bot, or just a progressive who doesn't know the meaning of the word relative to our situation? Anything but Biden (and with the EC, it's gonna be one or the other, we can't change that at this point) is regressive and dangerous - literally dire - for everyone you know.
I agree with your analysis of this. I believe Biden will choose an African American woman and I think it will be Harris. Whoever it is will be slimed mercilessly by Right &amp; Left. Media dying to sink their fangs into a Dem. Joe seems like Teflon. VP choice will be target.

If you think Trump is a Builder and winner, you are sadly mistaken. He is none of these. If you think Trump is a great leader he us not. He can‚Äôt get us out of this mess. He is not competent to lead us. He will lose the election because Biden is abetter man than Trump and stable.
Yes. Biden 2020. Gang of 5. Won‚Äôt get my vote ever until real apologies and payment to the city of their laughable defense money.
You have no knowing if you are going to stay as president. That is not up to you. It‚Äôs not looking too good for you regarding the opinion polls. You‚Äôre lack of leadership will destroy you in November. America needs a winner like Joe Biden not a whiner like you.
Just saw a page on Twitter for an organization calling itself "Young Believers for Biden". A "Christian" Leftist group who apparently support infanticide, Socialism, and Cultural Marxism, as well as a host of other contradictory and evil positions. Disgusting.
compared to Biden and Obama during the H1N1 swine flu, Trump performed miracles restocking the depleted stockpiles of equipment and PPE for healthcare banning air traffic from China early, giving governors all the help they asked for

If it is too dangerous for Biden to go outside and speak or debate, it must be to dangerous to the electorate to vote.

It will be a beating for Biden
They brought him back with a certain medication that got some doctors in hot water. Now, at least we know that Biden has an out.
When did Biden say that bro? Get the quote!
Yeah, and honestly, I don't think there is much of an appetite for that anywhere outside the White House.  We will vote in November and Joe Biden will take over January 20.  The rest is a lot of (interesting but improbable) sound and fury signifying nothing.
Not for this corrupt dolt. Not while I'm still breathing and can do anything about it! Look, if it's close (not the scenario anticipated) we could have another Bush v. Gore and SCOTUS could side with Trump. But that's not the same as SCOTUS ruling for Biden and military mutinying

I sure hope so, the left is out of control.  Biden doesnt even know what day he's in let alone location. He never swings his arms when he walks. He needs to be in physical therapy not running for President
2 takeaways from this.   The hoes on the view are seriously fugly , and Biden never completed a single thought in the two minutes given to him.

When we consider getting rid of the filibuster, it‚Äôs good to remember we‚Äôre not just getting rid of it for a Biden era Congress, but also for a President Trump Jr. or a President Tucker Carlson era Congress.
If he does and Pelosi is still SOTH, she becomes the interim POTUS until the election is held. I'm hoping he postpones it. That defeat to himbwould be greater than losing to Biden
Michelle is.  Pretty much the only thing that excuses Biden's delaying announcing his VP choice is if Michelle just hasn't gotten back to him yet.

I'm glad Biden is finally going to choose so we know who Trump is really running against.
Feinstein is oldest, but Leahy is longest serving. But to be clear as even Alan Dershowitz points out: the Dems could select anyone, including Harris, Warren or Sanders. So if Harris (or Duckworth or Baldwin) were Biden's announced running mate, I'd guess it would be that woman.
George, I respect you immensely, but you‚Äôre grossly naive if you think Biden will retain the pseudo centrism of his primary campaign. He‚Äôs seen the energy, the sheer anger and forcefulness of the hard Progressive Left, and he‚Äôs cowed by it. God help us if Dems win the Senate.
Why are they all using Biden‚Äôs campaign slogan?!?
Clinton, like Biden, is a leacherous, creepy person. Prove me wrong! I‚Äôll wait.

You support biden, no wonder.
Only if Biden wins. If Trump wins, you know the Demorats will keep the virus scam going until January 2025!
It's probably a deep fake they've been training for the past year. Since there is no way he's fit to debate  I predict Biden's team will try to do the debates remotely so that Obama can debate him using a deep fake.
Tulare. With uniform shift, it was the closest on one of my maps to go for Biden (46%D)

Remember,  predicted Trump would do this and the Trump campaign called Biden "off his rocker", in response. Seems that Biden understands a petty autocrat like Trump better than Trump's own campaign does.
Everyone is slating Biden to pass in the next 8 yrs and idk how I feel about that üôÉ
Even if this date is cherry picked, just look at the graphs. Trump's highest point isn't as high as Biden's lowest. Whereas he was often leading, tied, or within a couple of points of Clinton.

I wonder how long it'll be until the GOP and the Right find a way to blame Cain's death on wearing masks, the protests, or Biden specifically. Maybe a combination of the three.   Any death is bad, I'm not happy about his passing, but I do hope that some good can come of it.
As usual, you‚Äôre wrong.  I‚Äôm voting for Biden because I know he will not be vindictive or ill willed.  Frankly, I wish for you a long and healthy career out of public office.  Via Con Dios
Maybe, but in the Presidential election (or is it a selection?) between Trump vs Biden, imo we the people really have a choice between poison a or poison b. So delaying the election does not matter all that much, but it gives the media something to talk about, as Trump knows.
"Trailing badly in the polls, the president baselessly suggested the Nov election would be 'the most INACCURATE &amp; FRAUDULENT' in history."  'Sen McConnell of KY did not answer questions about Trump‚Äôs tweet as he walked onto the Senate floor Thurs morning.'
I find it rediculous that anyone is saying this. I submit taking some time to read Biden‚Äôs position papers to understand what he wants to do when elected. I don‚Äôt believe this is a ‚Äúanyone but Trump‚Äù election. I truly believe Biden is the best choice
We can‚Äôt sleep until Biden is sworn in January 2021.  Never underestimate trump‚Äôs criminality.
Biden on air in Ohio.   Sitting Speaker indicted.   Vote coming on his removal.   And it‚Äôs only 10 am.
Scenario 1 puts it in the hands of Congress, which would give Trump a legitimate election victory anyway.  A worse scenario would be a 2000 Florida repeat, except DeSantis refuses to appoint electors for Biden, and Congress gives the victory to Trump.
In all seriousness though, couldn't the Dems pick anyone better than Biden?

No, they‚Äôd rather ‚ÄúWeekend at Bernie‚Äôs‚Äù Biden until he passes it over to the VP. Disgraceful.
You need to state what you plan to work on and contrast that with what Biden has already said he will do. The Dem platform is not what America wants but they are focusing on riots, covid, and divisiveness. It sounds like a daily DNC briefing every evening in the MSM.
Yes, for Joe Biden!
My presidential electoral history:  2004: G.W. Bush 2008: Bob Barr 2012: Gary Johnson 2016: Evan McMullin 2020: Joe Biden  #RepublicansForBiden
I turned 18 in 2002 and originally registered as independent. When Bush ran for re-election I decided I was a Republican and I remained one until shortly after the 2016 GOP convention. After a brief stint as a Libertarian I am now a registered Democrat supporting Biden.
I believe the dis honorable judge, has had screaming sex with an alien of unknown origins! Vote Biden 2020!!
I love you guys and Joe Biden
Naw bitch, there will be no delay.  I will scale Everest to cast a ballot against you.  Wait in line all day?  No prob.  Walk through glass?  No prob.  I will do what I have to do to vote for Joe Biden in November.  #Biden2020

This isn't Biden
I realize he has zero power to change the Election Date and that would be a job for congress. I don‚Äôt hang on every tweet  or statement that he makes just like I‚Äôm sure you don‚Äôt for Joe Biden.
I hope this sexist bullshit backfires big time.  Some Biden allies wage a shadow campaign to stop Kamala Harris from becoming vice president
People laughed out loud at anyone suggesting that he'd ever try to do this. Biden included when he suggested Trump would try it.   The current President floated the idea of delaying an election he is projected atm to lose. How is ANYONE with any objectivity left okay with that?
I wouldn't vote for Joe Biden and furthermore you deleted over 34,000 emails have you left those poor soldiers to die in Benghazi you're Satan sister that is pretty low.
That's just stupid. I watch Biden speak fairly frequently. FOX would have you believe an unpolished speaker is two steps from a home. Stop buying in to that blatant crap.   You managed to ignore the entire point of this tweet. Want to address that or deflect again?
Folks on the Right tell me ‚Äúa vote for a third party is a vote for Biden.‚Äù On the Left they say, ‚Äúa vote for a third party is a vote for Trump.‚Äù No, a vote for a third party is a vote for a third party.

Going out in a limb here and gonna say that Joe Biden is going to overwhelmingly win the female vote.  Just a hunch. Can't imagine why?
It's actually quite calm outside of TheProudSocialist Brie Brie or Krystal Ball threads.  Most progressives are supporting Biden. These jackals though... There's no hope.
So you think all women hate Biden.  Got it. That's wrong but at least you admitted you think it.
You're saying all women hate Biden?
Most who aren't are very easily voting Biden.  Evidenced by the progressive female in this thread vs the 4 or 5 Bros who want their student loans paid off and don't understand how detrimental to women's rights it would be if Trump gets to replace RBG.
No the implication is that things are worse for POC and women under Trump than they would be under Biden.  Thats fair.

Biden Gets Confused Again, Doesn't Know What Year it is: "In the 2020 Census, Which is Now Two Censuses Ago" (VIDEO)  via
Thanks for sharing SB! I have seen a lot of people propping up Biden with BLM, which is why I originally asked these questions. People do this with every candidate at every level (i.e. Christians propping up Trump &amp; McConnell) and I think more people should realize this.
But back in the day isn't now. What Trump rescinded literally came from an administration in which Joe Biden was #2.  Why even make such a remark?
You weren't going to vote for Biden.  And if someone being mean to you on Twitter would change who you voted for, then you clearly don't have any conviction anyway.
Strange, every single progressive always says they voted for HRC (after spending months shitting on her).  In a few years you'll all say you voted for Biden too.  Your lying is shameful.
Good thing they'd be covered under the Biden plan.
I am as well. I‚Äôm hopeful for change but I guess I have more of an attitude of ‚ÄúI‚Äôll believe it when I see it.‚Äù  I have a severe lack of trust in the two party system and am concerned that Biden will promise equality but never actually work to make changes in the current systems.
Do people really think that everything will change with one election after decades of inequality?  Is it not problematic that many white people have turned BLM into a campaign for Biden rather than actually seeking reform?  These are real questions, would love to discuss.
All of this can‚Äôt be done quickly so Biden should be prepared on November 4th to announce a complete reversal of all of it.
Considering minorities voted overwhelmingly for Biden... That's just factually incorrect.  Old-fashioned head counts... You mean basic democracy?  Lol that's idiotic.
So you guys don't accept plans, don't accept the time as VP... We are only allowed to submit policies that are more than a decade old Biden supported as a senator?  Thats an absurd standard.
And Trumps policy is anti-union. Anti-working class. Etc. Just read the policy itself, it's not hard.  Trump as also been in charge for 4 years so you can see his actions as well.  Biden has been a private citizen and anytime things he did as VP you all say "that was Obama"
If he gets a presidential Day 1, Joe Biden has a nearly endless list of ways to spend it
Opinion | Now we know why Trump sought foreign help to beat Biden
Opinion | Biden‚Äôs election will end national nightmare 2.0
Anyone with a brain could seee 45 "supporting" Sanders as a candidate was becuz they had ammo built up for that. It's either 45 or Biden. Win the battle to fight another day.
And progressives also didn't listen to the LGBT community who said repeatedly that they cared about married specifically.  Telling disenfranchised communities what is best for them is what you guys do best.  Ignore the LGBT community, ignore the black community (who voted Biden)
Biden supports a public option which has better polling than M4A.  And public support of a general idea of a plan isn't the same as knowing how to pass legislation.  There aren't 20 votes for M4A in the senate it would never pass.
Because overreaching leads to Trump.  Biden is where the voters are and that's how democracy works.
Biden is one guy, stuff like a single payer wont succeed because of one progressive president.  It has to be accepted in the fabric of the economy and it just isn't yet. You have to take steps. And you guys just don't understand that because you are impatient.
Historically that doesn't happen. It's why minimum wage goes up, civil rights improve over time, environmental laws become more strict, etc.  What sets us back is when we do things that lead to guys like Trump in office. (like shitting on Biden the whole election cycle).
Joe Biden‚Äôs election will end national nightmare 2.0, the nation‚Äôs second domestic debacle in two generations.  Opinion by George F. Will - The Washington Post
That's all semantics what you consider the "wing" of the party.  Biden isnt in the 1% of progressivism but honestly, a huge margin of progressives are solidly supporting Biden.  Biden doesnt get you everything you want but it keeps you on track. Trump actively pulls you away.
You are being intentionally blind then. What was happening to wages before COVID? If you disagree that the tax cut helped anything, then you'll be so happy to pay them again if Biden gets in. In fact he'll raise them even more and you will love it. Some people are stupid.
Biden is leading by 10 points.  His strategy is to stay quiet and let trump talk‚Äîtrump speaking is the best Biden for President commercial.
Joe Biden is liked and respected. 45 is worshipped. That's the enthusiasm "gap".
I understand police have to support Trump because he is the closest option to them. But ultimately he hasn't done anything to help them either. All he has is twitter support. But I guess that is better than Biden by a long shot.
How do I vote for a person who believes there is systematic racism in the police with ZERO evidence? His co-chair of his campaign said this and used one statistic to prove. "Black men are more likely to be killed by police." I cannot and will not support Biden with that one.
On the Biden plan*
You're getting caught up in semantics and labels again.  Is every word literally the exact same? Of course not it's his own plan. Not to mention the GND doesn't formally exist anymore since it was defeated.  Is everything substantial from. The GND ok the Biden plan? Yes. It is.
No, AOCs bill was written several years ago and Biden's wouldn't be effective until at least a year from now so of course some dates are going to be different genius.  You all have 0 understanding of basic facts.
Again. So caught up on labels. Everyone agrees that energy policy is the thing Biden is most lefty on. To bitch and moan about that shoes you don't know what is being said and are only reading headlines.

No. Biden supports the current green new deal. The only one alive. That's a factual statement.  If you're referring to a piece of legislation that literally doesn't exist, that's on you.

Presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden unveiled plans for racial economic equality on Tuesday before reporters in Delaware.
Trump is going to suffer a legendary annihilation no matter who Biden picks for vice president. And he's going to drag down the entire Republican party along with him. Which will be a very good thing because perhaps it can return more to a Reagan style party.
Hence why AOC is on his commission.  And the GND in its exact semantic form is dead. The spirit of the bill however exists in the Biden plan (which is now AOCs plan).  So, to use your words, do some research.
You seem to not understand the difference between supporting something and having identical worded plans. Biden's plan isn't in legislation the way AOCs is because it's a policy proposal.  Honestly you progressives get dumber by the day.

No they didn‚Äôt. When comparing national polling today in 2020 VS 4 years ago in 2016, Hillary lead by +2 to +4.  Biden is leading anywhere from +6 to +14 in some states.  Biden is also SIGNIFICANTLY more popular than Hillary. Hillary lost in swing states. Biden is winning those.
You don‚Äôt really know how statistics work and clearly don‚Äôt know how polling works either. Biden has a substantial lead over Trump, even when accounting for the margin of error and potential ‚Äúfaithless responders‚Äù.  Also, there‚Äôs no silent majority dude. Keep wishing.
19 is close to the number of points Biden is leading Trump in the national polls.
This is an example of why it is important that Biden not only win but win in a landslide.  Complete repudiation by the voters of his tactics and philosophies.  Drs and scientists entrusted to protect us shouldn't fear retaliation from the POTUS for doing their job.

Joe Biden did not have someone else take his SAT test.
Trump fails to understand that Obama is one of the most popular politicians right now, and it was imperative that Obama hold back his endorsement until it was clear who the nominee was. Even when it was clear Biden had it, it needed to be official.  This is how politics work.

Matt‚Äôs post as well as the comments shows you that they are not held to the same standard. Matt pretends to be objective/moderate, but he only shows one side of the coin. If you‚Äôre going to call out one of presidential candidate‚Äôs for mental decline, start with Biden üôÑ
You mentioned Maxwell, not me.  I know Biden is creepy. I know Trump is creepy. I have a right to voice my displeasure of both.  It is creepy for a man to put his hands on the shoulders of a woman that isn't his partner, rub her shoulders, and smell her hair, yes?
Wrong. Trump would never second-guess himself. He blames the Chinese, Obama, Biden and all liberals for the cancellation of his rallies.
He's playing that Nixon "Law and Order" card from '68. It worked for Tricky Dick but I would argue with all of his flaws (he wasn't my choice) Biden is a stronger candidate than anyone running in '68 or '72 for that matter. ü§û
Here‚Äôs the truth. I don‚Äôt watch the news. Period.   I don‚Äôt defend Trump or Biden. Not even a little.
However, many presidents ‚Äî including the nation's first, George Washington ‚Äî owned slaves.
How heartless for  and his cronies to try and repeal Obamacare with NO replacement in mind during a pandemic? Isn't it ironic that t/ same folks that are affected from this virus are t/ folks who will lose coverage and accrue massive debt after? #Biden #TrumpFailedAmerica
Mr Biden is ‚Äúas good a man as God ever created‚Äù and ‚Äúis the nicest person I think I ever met in politics‚Äù.
I don't know just feel that this country is divided as ever. I don't like Biden for the record just saying but I likely won't vote in November at this point.
isn't the first racist president, or even the most-racist president, but he's giving Wilson, Jackson, Johnson and others stiff competition.
Where Is The Outrage? Biden Fans Racism Flames With This Astonishing Claim
Hey Joe...I‚Äôm gonna raise you one Andrew Jackson. Sigh...he‚Äôs preferable to Trump but Biden still sucks really really bad.
Biden Says Schools Should Teach About Islam, Quotes Muhammad During ‚ÄòMillion Muslim Voters‚Äô Summit
There is no "Trump's America."  There is no "Biden's America."  There is only, "America."  It's time folks from DC to New York, from Orlando to LA, from Raleigh to Seattle and Dallas to Detroit start acting like it.
I hate being reminded that even with all of this Biden is still the only real option to vote for if we don't want 4 more years of Trump, since 3rd party candidates are never going to win a presidential election.
"We‚Äôve had racists, and they‚Äôve existed. They‚Äôve tried to get elected president. He‚Äôs the first one that has.‚ÄùI mean, now that this has come to light, I hope Biden picks another running mate. That said, I can‚Äôt imagine what kind of awful crime against nature Biden would need to commit in order for me to vote for Trump in 2020.
The #BidenWarrenFundraiser reminded me why I fell in love with  and if she‚Äôs not VP I hope she has some role in the #Biden administration
Stop with the false allegations... it's easy to research the real stuff!
Because shit neoliberalism leaves out almost half of society. When people get frustrated enough they‚Äôre willing to elect anybody. Someone worse will follow Biden if he doesn‚Äôt actually enact the progressive change that the majority wants to see. He can talk a good game all day.
100%. I‚Äôm voting for Biden no matter what but Harris is by far the worst potential VP under consideration IMO. Warren, Duckworth, Bass, and Rice would all be better.
That's a laugh, considering every time I say it'll be a cold day in hell before I vote for Biden, I'm inundated with responses like "You must be a Russian asset/bot", or "You'll cause Trump to win like you did in 2016!"
Right now i'm an outcast I don't support Biden but that doesn't mean I support Trump. I know a lot of people hate that but i'm not going to lie.
I‚Äôm team Biden, but I can promise you the largest voting demographic in the 2020 election will be old white men who are deciding between 2 old white men.
good for you if you like Biden but I don't. I don't pretend to like someone or settle that is not who I am.
Thank you next President Biden.  We look forward to you helping rebuild America, and helping cast out the destroyers of America.
I love so much that the Trump campaign‚Äôs brilliant idea is to paint Biden as a swamp establishment politician that‚Äôs been in DC for 40 years then in the next breath say Biden is a puppet of the ‚ÄúBernie/AOC socialists‚Äù.
Obama barely endorsed Biden. You can see the sadness in his eyes in the video.
An FYI,  it's my understanding that Biden has asked that all of his staffers to uninstall TikTok from their devices.
Seems reasonable, but you could write this article about any of the finalists. Not quite cut &amp; paste, but close. Because Biden is so hard to demonize, the GOP will twist themselves in knots to demonize the VP pick to energize the base. And it will work to some degree. So... yawn.
Lol, I swear I might sleep 12 hours when Biden is sworn in.
what are the liberals gonna do when/if Biden wins and absolutely nothing changes bc that‚Äôs going to happen
95 days until election and still feel sick with the idea of voting for Biden and I know i'm not the only one.
The shakeup at ‚Å¶ by ‚Å¶ Michael Pack is clearly a partisan move by fat boy ‚Å¶ Pack has put Trump loyalists in top positions, yet everyone is whining, suspending journalists over a Biden clip. Really?
Dean, Couple her with the known vices of Biden and the USA ( or what is left of it ) will have a real mess on everyone's hands üá∫üá∏
Can we all agree (this for you MEDIA!) that once Biden has been sworn in, regardless of what T antics are NO ATTENTION WILL BE PAID. He will NO LONGER have coverage of his actions, tweets, or remarks. Like the temper tantrum of a child you ignore, it is IMPERATIVE he be ignored!!
A new Yahoo News/YouGov poll: 52% of Americans now believe that #Trump won't accept the results of Nov‚Äôs election if he loses to #JoeBiden. An even larger majority of Trump voters say they too will refuse to accept a narrow loss if #MailInBallots contribute to Biden‚Äôs victory.
The Electoral College isn't necessarily much of an assistance to Rump, although it might be to conservative politicians in general. We should look on the bright side and look at the EC as something Rump can't tamper with. If Biden has a resounding victory, we won't have to worry.
Drump/45 is responsible for 153,000 lives lost on his watch,  can't blame that shit on OBAMA #BlackLivesMatter # vote Biden 2020
Also note that even if Rump stays holed up in the White House, nobody in the Executive Branch has to follow his requests, and if they do, they're likely committing crimes.  They have to answer to the new president, presumably Biden, no matter where he is.
Trump has no ground to reject the results because the entire establishment, military, Security state, republican elite and entirety of DNC want Biden to win. Trump will leave without a whimper
That actually surprises me. Yes I consider Sanders good, seeing as he's who I supported.   I'd rather have a real primary than a slightly better chance of winning 2024. If you've looked at Biden's VP shortlist, you know there's no young option that is actually progressive.
Because almost certainly a "good" younger would run in 2024 or in the unlikely scenario Biden goes for two terms, 2028 and will have no real primary opposition. I'd like the voters to decide who should be the nominee after Biden. Whomever you'd consider good, I probably wouldnt
We don't really need FL. Every 2016 Clinton state (all of which look safe for Biden) and the PA, WI, MI trio (Biden leads in all three by around 5-8) are enough. FL doesn't have much down ballot either, so I think NC, GA, and AZ are better targets.
It's worse than that. BLM is a political organization with a platform of radical ideas. It would be just as wrong for the whole NBA to wear a MAGA shirt or a Biden 2020 shirt. It is political &amp; has nothing to do with the value of human life or any kind of injustice. #MAGA2020
Vote for Trump &amp; I‚Äôm labeled a racist and a homophobe by the other side.  Vote for Biden &amp; I‚Äôm labeled a racist and pedophile by the other side.  Vote 3rd party &amp; I‚Äôm ‚Äòthrowing my vote away.‚Äô  Don‚Äôt vote at all &amp; I‚Äôm not doing my ‚Äòcivic duty.‚Äô  I am genuinely asking for help.
You cannot convince me this settle for Biden thing is real
I shouldn‚Äôt be expected to cast my vote to a party who doesn‚Äôt represent me or my values, so I won‚Äôt. Joe Biden isn‚Äôt the problem, the party voted down almost every progressive platform. He‚Äôs just the tip of the iceberg
That makes absolutely no sense  all what u are claiming #BlackLivesMatter # vote Biden 2020
MASTERFULLY STATED BY OUR NEXT PRESIDENT OF OUR UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.  I WILL FEEL PROUD OF OUR COUNTRY AND THE PHENOMENAL MIND BIDEN CARRIES EVERYWHERE HE HAPPENS TO GO ü§ó
Don't count out Duckworth in Biden VP race
And Chomo Joe Biden is a child molester, I'll take the patriot Donald Trump.
Hottdamn that's a bigass cat lol #BlackLivesMatter # vote Biden 2020
LOL the guy was corrupt! He held up the $ until Ukraine removed a CORRUPT dude. tRump held up $ to get a fake investigation announcement against his opponent!  Are they both wrong or just Biden?
Let me guess... if trump wins, he cheated... if Biden wins, it‚Äôs legit
He‚Äôs done more for black ppl that the democrats have done in 50 years pelosi , Biden,Schumer etc been in office for 45 years each , Trump 3.5 years and done more yet they blame trump the media lies and you fall for it
Trump has done more for black ppl than past 5 presidents, trump is the only president past 2 centuries that hasn‚Äôt started a war or bombed invaded a country . He did justice reform that let 1,000 out of prison that Biden bill jailed , police reform he‚Äôs
the same people that told you Trump was a Russian spy, Kavanaugh was a rapist and the president colluded with the Ukraine for a crime Biden opening bragged about; are now telling you that it‚Äôs the presidents fault we have this virus and to wear a mask! You have no credibility!
I certainly can relate to your tweet. Obama is responsible for a lot of this going on today. I hope to God nobody is dumb enough to vote for Joe Biden! America is under siege!
No obama and Biden did that
Biden was never President.
Obama speaking for Dementia Joe Biden again
In case you didn‚Äôt know, in the fall of 2019 the economy was already heading into a recession. Coronavirus was nowhere in sight then.
What has trump done in 3 1/2 years other than destroy America in every way possible?
Well you definitely won‚Äôt like Joe Biden then.
ü§£ Biden isn't anything except a mouth trying to say what others tell him.
Eulogy? All I heard was a campaign speech for Hidin' Biden
Any person that can ONLY FOG A MIRROR occasionally, cannot vote for Biden. This shithead has no idea what to do! Name one thing he has done for Police Reform. I was raised to be law abiding. Now with Biden I can call it a protest while I am looting a retail business
From your words to God‚Äôs ears! I pray and pray and pray for Biden.
Don‚Äôt approve of your Biden socialist approach but citizens have the right to vote here. Just remember how lucky you are as the rest of us all are to be free to say what our opinions are.
Thank you, Joe Biden!
So Biden and Trump can be ‚Äòtwinning‚Äô? üòÖ
Funeral? I thought it was a Biden rally?
Why wait? Biden in a landslide. Start packing now!!!
Just caught in the middle.  He has to protect our federal buildings and biden is acting the same damn way towards the protesters.  But yeah I definitely am still voting for him. I mean who else  lmfao yeah I'm dying off that one!!
Oh like the Russian scam, Kavanaugh is a rapist, and Trump extorted the Ukraine, same crime Biden bragged about!
Yeah he thinks that makes him look less racist if we see him with some ü¶ùü¶ßüêíüêµü¶ç #BlackLivesMatter # vote Biden 2020
Even more than Biden the answer is the entire corrupt machinery behind him
Joe Biden and Robert Byrd were the Jim Crow two of the Democrat party.
Not really, but don't support senile Joe Biden.
Why didn't Biden do all that during his time as VP? Did he hate Obama so much he couldn't stand giving a black man credit?  What a racist creep.
So it‚Äôs looking more more like Kamala will be VP. A VP slot that is much more important than usual considering Biden‚Äôs health. I think out of his ‚Äúlist of candidate nominees ‚Äú she is the best pick. The bar is low but she‚Äôs the best.
But  other than be a Twitter activist what have you done I get why they‚Äôre not verifying you it‚Äôs only public figures.  Wish you wouldn‚Äôt think you‚Äôre hot shit because you have a pod cast and shit on joe Biden. Your why people hate progressives in the dem party.
Can Biden make Obama his VP? Is that allowed?
what do you mean Biden can't choose AOC as VP?
Who would be stupid enough to vote for Biden??
I am willing to walk through a gauntlet of racists with bats to vote for biden.
No it's u ur a racist Republicans are racist u all care nothing abt poor, or black &amp; brown ppl #BlackLivesMatter # vote Biden 2020
I think Joe Biden is a disgrace!
The current occupant of the Whitehouse is racist asf pass it on #BlackLivesMatter # vote Biden 2020
my feelings on joe biden are documented in the annals of history
Biden should promote this tweet.
Then y'all want 2 b surprised when we burn shit dwn , &amp; riot well this is why....#BlackLivesMatter # vote Biden 2020
do you think i have to critique joe biden in order to make light of herman cain's death? is that a prerequisite?
did Biden die?
Biden has a tough road to undo everything Trump has done to our country
If he keeps blaming China for HIS failures I'm going to scream.   But please keep sending him out there. He makes Biden's case for him.
It puts the Biden on its skin or it gets the Trump again!
Soros and communist China owns both Obama and Biden along with the Democrat party and dishonest media.
Trump will win regardless of how many people vote for Biden. It‚Äôll be a repeat of the 2016 election.
Well u need 2 be tryn 2 get those racist cops that killed Breanna Taylor n jail #BlackLivesMatter # vote Biden 2020
He hasn‚Äôt though &amp; has a mass amount of supporters. Very loyal supporters who are all around us. Biden doesn‚Äôt have the following to immediately win this, and he isn‚Äôt gaining them quickly. People can‚Äôt stand him either and every Independent vote is a vote for Trump...
Right bc may he rest n power bc he was a blackman but he was a toe-tapping foot-shuffling ü¶ùü¶ßü¶çüêíüêµ &amp; that's why he was one of a few black ppl  thst racist convention #BlackLivesMatter # vote Biden 2020
Fuck drump,  fuck maga,  fuck Q'anon #BlackLivesMatter # vote Biden 2020
That should go 2 show those that thinking foot-shuffling 4 white folks doesn't get us anywhere so 2 all u ü¶ùü¶ßü¶çüêíüêµ vote Biden 2020
I don't think this necessarily is the conclusion. It's the fear that the Democratic Party establishment, by doing the bare minimum to defeat an toxic incumbent, will not feel compelled to move away from right-center. I'll vote for Biden. But I have NO illusions, either.
Biden wont debate him. If he does, it will be a roast not a debate.
I really don‚Äôt mean to be flippant about Biden‚Äôs mental state, but I do think he‚Äôs suffering some sort of decline. I‚Äôve seen the interviews as I‚Äôm sure you have. As for Cain, there‚Äôs no evidence he got the virus at the rally.
I‚Äôm not a Biden so that‚Äôs fine lol they both terrible candidates
&amp; whats that pic supposed 2 make him , drump/45 seem less racist that photo means nothing once a racist always a racist #BlackLivesMatter # vote Biden 2020
Cooper underperforming Biden? Yeah okay...
On Jan.20th 2009 PBO and VP Biden walked into an Oval office that was in depression and a country on the verge of collapse, Joe's been here,  done that and will  work with all regardless of politics to get us on a path forward.  The pandemic will take longer but moving forward.
I finally thought you posted a poll that was an easy one, but the more I thought about it, the more I realize how funny a Biden presidency could actually be
Lol if you think Biden is the one for that I‚Äôm sorry
Wow 2-3 hours later u say something abt him after he'd still b alive if it wasn't 4 ur bullshit Tulsa rally #BlackLivesMatter # vote Biden 2020
Vote for what ? What change is going to be made that hasn‚Äôt been made in Biden‚Äôs 50 years in office
You just need a good old dose of Barack when you feel like you‚Äôve been run over and over by trump!!!  Vote Biden, vote blue. RIP John Lewis, your bravery and leadership will be missed. Thank you!
Why would anyone vote for Biden?
Yall gave Bill Clinton too much respect with very little rationale  He says stuff like this all the time and he thinks he has a right to. Similar to Joe Biden talking what being "black" is.  I be tired...
I'm pretty sure it's easy for a Republican to vote for Biden, since his policies aren't all that different from the mainstream of the GOP. Pro-war, anti-choice, pro-fossil fuels, pro-corporations, anti-working class, anti-poor.
OBAMA is talking all racist Republicans shut ur fucking mouths #BlackLivesMatter # vote Biden 2020
Of course he meaning that racist drump/45 would do this anything to tryn upstage our greatest president OBAMA #BlackLivesMatter # vote Biden 2020
Everyone turn ur üì∫ on CNN so u can witness the greatest president in our life time # fuck trump # fuck maga # fuck Q'anon #BlackLivesMatter # vote Biden 2020
I'd really wanted to vote for Biden, but his supporters are just vile with their hatred I just can't get behind him.
Hope Biden is able to win and pull her opponent over the edge
Idk but if he's promoting it if I take my black self n that pl they'll probably spit on my üçï lol lmao #BlackLivesMatter # vote Biden 2020
You do realize the coronavirus lockdowns and quarantines are being used fOR the Democrats to tamper with the election and avoid Biden debating on live TV
And you want to cheat to win.   Cause that's the only way Biden can win.
You referred to him winning an election...meaning Biden is the front runner...he can only be leading in the polls...and so was Hillary
I agree.  Get a absentee ballot.  Together we can defeat Joe Biden!  He has to be crushed, humiliated, and driven from office, public life, and society and place in a nursing home's memory unit.  Glad to have you back on the Trump Train.
Joe Biden is expected to accept the party‚Äôs presidential nomination on the final night of the convention, which runs Aug. 17-20, the schedule released late Wednesday said.
I stopped drinking 2 years ago as well, for no other reason then I just lost interest in it.   I did however cry and day drink on Trump‚Äôs Inauguration Day.   On Biden‚Äôs Inauguration Day I might bake cookies and happy cry.
I have a problem with the toxicity of some of her followers. In particular the ones who say they will only vote for Biden if she‚Äôs his vp choice.
For sure. As long as Biden doesn't spit the bit completely.
Your dude was a no show and can‚Äôt win a primary. It‚Äôs now a binary choice. I‚Äôm sure you will refuse to participate and just stay home and tweet about it. Just know that your vote isn‚Äôt needed and my man, Biden, will make a great POTUS.
Plz do not let drumps wanna b king ass delay the election 4 which he knows he can not legally do #blacklivesMatter # vote Biden 2020
People say #Trump is unpredictable. Is he? Cuz I know someone who seems to have his number.  #JoeBiden2020
Joe Biden is actually Q. Wow!
The thing is...  The media allow republicans to dance off stage when asked hard questions and then allow them to stand and bullshit about conspiracy theories.  You can‚Äôt get John Kennedy to answer anything unless he wants to smear Biden about Ukraine.  Then he has time to talk.üôÑ
To all the people staying home on election day because you think Biden is as bad as Trump, I hope you're paying attention here. #DumpTrump2020
Because it will take so long to execute it is not going to happen. President Biden will reverse it.
Biscuit Biden
Trump, Biden, whoever. They are feathers of the same bird. And spoiler alert, they don‚Äôt give a crap about you or me.
He can not delay the election. But I am betting the moment Biden his declared the winner, tRump declares Martial Law. That is if he has not done so before that.
This website is going to be unbearable with Biden announces his VP pick and everyone who proudly tweeted they're not voting hops on to bitch about his pick.
News this morning: Economy is shrinking, virus is spreading,  unemployment is increasing, Biden rising in polls; also this morning  suggest maybe delaying the 2020 election...#ThursdayThoughts
You sent children back to school. You're really afraid of being beaten by Joe Biden. The blood is in the water and the shark is circling. Goodbye.
Biden can‚Äôt even remember what he had for breakfast and he‚Äôs still gunna beat trump.
Joe Biden needs new allies.  They are steering him wrong if they are steering him away from Kamala Harris.  She is top notch
Trump about to start terrorizing cities and will try to delay election cause he know he‚Äôs about to take an L to loser ass Biden lol
And then there's the question of armed white supremacists planning to intimidate black voters at the polls. Turn them away.  Trump supporters with AKs killing Biden voters?
All the protest, rioting and racism is all in cities that have been democrat controlled for over 50 years  each like  Chicago 100 years. Biden, pelosi, Schumer etc each been in office over 45 years and haven‚Äôt done squat . Trump done more in 3.5 years than th
In the beginning, when Trump was riding on Obama‚Äôs coattails, he would brag about what a great presidency ‚Äúhis‚Äù was. Now that the seeds of trump‚Äôs presidency have come to fruition, he blames Obama and Biden. Lol üòÇü§£
Wealth is not fairly gained or kept in this country, ask just about anyone.  Cops are the private security force for the wealthy and well-connected.  Kamala is a cop.  Biden empowers cops to do the bidding of the wealthy.  Neither represents the 99%.
Trump vs. Biden: Where they stand on health, economy, more
Joe Biden sucks. So it doesn't really matter to us. Let this whole place burn.

sounds like joe biden
How long ago was it when Biden proudly promoted segregation?
Dear joe Biden, his campaign staff, and the dnc please don‚Äôt pick Hillary for Vice President
Never trust FL.  Biden will obviously get PA and WI so that alone is game, set, match.  I don't even care about those as much as running up the score.  Just win everything.  Carter won all of 6 states in 1980 and things weren't even a fraction as bad as right now.
Something about these media leaks re: how Biden‚Äôs allies really feel about Kamala feels...uncomfortable.   Biden Campaign: We need to give Black Women (base) something   Black Women: we‚Äôd like Kamala (clearly our favorite) as VP  Biden Campaign: We didn‚Äôt mean her. Who else?
Forget the virus which came from China, trump banded travel from China on Jan, 31, Biden critized trump for doing so, calling him a racist but I‚Äôm sure you care nothing for the facts, just total hatered of trump.
Same. He flipped on trump pretty quick, but I‚Äôm gonna wait and see if he actually supports Biden as president.  Never gonna forgive him for not paying child support, though.
And did you hear what biden said about the protester....... yeah they both playing on the same team bro. Team Epstein dude. Smh
What are y‚Äôall‚Äôs vote for biden memes gunna say when he chooses the top cop prosecutor of Californian? Lmao.

Boomer Dems be trynna scare leftist millennials and gen z into voting for Biden by using the date of the country being in the balance as if this isn‚Äôt the most nihilistic generation ever and a lot of people would be relieved for the country to be blown up lmao
Biden and trump both suck vote 3rd party thanks for coming to my ted talk
My dream ticket from day 1 was Biden/Booker.  Won‚Äôt happen but I love Booker as our 47th President.
Sleazy Biden is just a battering ram for the commie Dems. He will do whatever they want!  Everything dems accuse Trump of they've done themselves (bullying, lies, chaos). If you can't see that you're blind!  Am I doing this right?!
I'm sure we don't have to worry about Biden doing that.
This is a very dangerous man. He lies like crazy. Does anyone really think that in 4 years, Biden is going to put everyone out of work in Texas? That oil, coal, and gas will no longer be produced? We call this fear mongering. That's what bullies do.

Joe Biden thinks it‚Äôs 2040.
I wan him to prove he‚Äôs asked democrats supporting Biden if they get paid. He‚Äôs a liar!
It is certain the strategy is:  - Perform test run, build conservative support for fascism - Identify Battleground States - Identity (Metro) areas with potential for tipping to Joe Biden - Develop voter suppression plan - Coordinate w/fed agencies - Deploy Gestapo to suppress
What is so wrong if her future goal is to be president? Isn't that most VPs future goal? And if I'm being honest, I hope the VP would be the one running the country, not Biden. Also, isn't Biden just a 1 term president anyway? ü§îü§îü§î
You have to agree! The coverage of a "dumb" child?! By "credible" news networks never should have run it! It was done because of who he supported. Biden or Hillary hat? Non story
I had zero intentions of voting for Biden but Trump is pushing me towards it with how bad he has gotten lately
Just in time for Biden to take over and the Republicans (left) will try and blame Democrats for it all.  EVERY. DAMN. TIME.
okay instead of an election- and hear me out- trump and biden dual on the white house front lawn
Dream job. Walk Joe Biden around and don‚Äôt let him talk to anyone!
üòÇü§£ Biden will be the one ducking from the debates, shit for brains
Unlike Joe Biden, who after being VP NEVER would have run for President.
Very Ron Swanson of Joe Biden to have two Tammys in his VP shortlist!
If he gets a presidential Day 1, Joe Biden has a nearly endless list of ways to spend it
Biden would have shit his pants, if he would have been in office when the oil, almost, crisis hit 4 months back. I just don't see him handling it as well as Trump. Joe may be a nice guy, but I don't see Sleepy Joe doing it. üá∫üá≤üóΩü¶Ö‚öñÔ∏èüêò

Joe Biden has been the worst person for president for the last 47 years Americans already know that, given up!
I really think it‚Äôs going to be Kamala Harris as well. To me, it makes the most sense based on who Biden is. She‚Äôs def not my first choice, though
Biden‚Äôs campaign video!
I think once we get the majority in House/Senate/White House Biden is going to go full throttle to get as much done (while undoing Trump crap). He can't if Mitch is still there. Glad you are voting for her. Then we need Booker to replace Rand in 2022.
How could Obama and Biden and their minions have changed the Fair Housing Act without hardworking Americans not being informed?
I‚Äôm not trying to sway you. Biden doesn‚Äôt need your vote and again, I could care less what you do. It‚Äôs just pathetic that you won‚Äôt let go of a lost movement that failed.
Educate yourself before you vote Biden just because you hate Trump #consequences

You have it right to some degree, and I'm voting Biden. But if you think we're going to have any significant progress on climate change under Biden, I have a bridge to sell ya.
"Look who's (Rump supporters) calling the vase (Biden) Ming."
No sane person can watch videos of Biden and not be disgusted. But carry on with your lunacy
If you support libertarian views, why on earth would you support Biden?! Vote your conscience, not the lesser of two evils! It‚Äôs hilarious to watch the mental gymnastics of people who will defend voting Biden. üëÄü§°
So, in other words you have absolutely no reason to support Biden on his own merits. You just hate Biden less than Trump. ü§°ü§§ü§£

What exactly makes Biden ‚Äòbetter‚Äô than Trump?
I have been informed by some Democrat friends who are insiders in the political world, that Joe Biden has picked Kamala Harris for his VP
Federal marijuana legalization is one of the "much needed reforms" that could help avoid cases like this in the future. Unfortunately, the Democratic National Committee just isn't ready to go that far, despite a fair amount of public support.
Joe Biden is definitely senile.
Damani's fake horror about Biden's admittedly racist policy past just makes me want to vomit, when the current president is pushing racist policies/views, continuously, in front of all our eyes. This guy is wearing blinders.
He‚Äôs a wolf in sheep‚Äôs clothing.Joe Biden doesn‚Äôt have the stamina to pass out cup cakes to the Homeless.But he has nerve to stand in front of John Lewis coffen with Pelosi to have a photo shot.The party is totally unhinged.
Looking forward to studying Joe Biden‚Äôs reinterpretation of the dialectic
Well, this aged well (not). He‚Äôs recycling this for Biden.
Biden never looks awesome, who you kidding! Now he has a seeing eye lady dragging him around

People like yourself who attempt to argue Biden is less-evil than Trump.
I think it's just as likely that some wives of Trump supporters will vote for Biden.
Who Would be stupid enough to vote for Joe Biden
The suburbs aren‚Äôt voting for Biden based on policy you dope. And I know your campaign has told you this over and over. Btw, you add all the other economic indicators that are flashing red while we also have historic housing prices and sales, it‚Äôs going to crash with you or Biden
You‚Äôre really downplaying this in attempt to justify Biden as ‚Äúthe lesser of two evils‚Äù. You people are beyond being reasoned with. They‚Äôre both wrong in the same degree, for differing reasons. Trying to justify this nonsense is similar to justifying pedophilia altogether üëÄ
Joe Biden has a Great Healthcare Plan: Day 24 of 100 Days of Loving Joe Biden

Trump is to the left of Biden on healthcare
I sincerely hope you are our AG under President Biden's administration.

Please remember to not blame the people who didn‚Äôt vote when Biden loses in November. Thanks.
There are no anarchists who believe that Biden‚Äôs expression of his natural enmity for anarchism will end his Presidential campaign. But now you know, because you read it on Twitter.
Any country but America is Biden's campaign slogan.
JOE BIDEN IS A SENILE COMMUNIST.
The best thing that Trump and Biden could do for themselves is to just stop opening their mouths.
Biden‚Äôs progressive task force said they definitely were not going to legalize weed all they would do is keep status quo very progressive
This is in tandem with Trump‚Äôs doubling down on hydro chloroquine as a ‚Äòtherapeutic‚Äô. They‚Äôre also pushing bogus Ukraine conspiracy theories in an effort to sway voter away from Biden.
Biden's notes: ‚ÄòDo not hold grudges‚Äô against Kamala Harris.  Biden is a truly good man!
Exactly! Biden most definitely is NOT FDR!
"Biden leads Trump 44%-40% among likely voters."
Alright now,, euphemism. Now you're talking about Trump again. Biden, y'see, writes his own script. Trump is given a script &amp; his writers hope he can stay on point even 10% of the time. (He never does). Trump seems more than a little ADHD. He can't stay on track. He can't.
You, Nadler, and the other band of fool Democrats should be ashamed of your performance with Bill Barr! Let me remind you! Obama pardoned 306 people with 110 serving Life Sentences! Look and the crap Biden &amp; Obama did with FBI to Trump! All a HOAX!
Amy McGrath and Joe Biden are two progressive peas in a pod
Your point? Both Biden and Trump are terrible people‚Äîwhich one are you defending?
I'm pretty sure that Biden has already done that.
Biden, we get it - you‚Äôre not Trump. For the love of god stop making that your full campaign.   Now is the time to stop comparing and complete ignore Trump. Start telling us what you‚Äôre going to do as President. Fuck. ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Even conservative Republicans will vote for Biden. Look at Project Lincoln. You have taken the party so far to the right that even Republicans don‚Äôt recognize it anymore. You are the fringe right of the republican party. The kind of GOP who believes a witch doctor over scientist.

Joe Biden was kidding. You didn't listen. Typical TRUMP!
Is Donald Trump firing on all cylinders? He touted a Doctor who believes in Alien sperm and Alien DNA..also having sex with Demons! It doesn't get any more crazier than that!   I'm Republican and will vote for Joe Biden 2020!
its pretty funny tht most of kamala harris‚Äôs support is older white liberals, she‚Äôs generally disliked by swing voters, had a terrible campaign and very little support, called Joe Biden a racist on live debate stage, no idea why shes the presumed choice
no one has ever accused him of RAPE though...no child has ever claimed to be raped by Biden... like  Trump and Epstein did to a 13 yr old girl  at the same time....that girl ...they scared into silence....he is a sick person.
Here is Donald Trump hanging out with an old pedophile who likes little-young girls....You will NEVER see a picture of Joe Biden and his wife hanging out with pedophiles...
Republicans would like you to believe this is about buildings, glass, Bill Barr....THIS is still about George. Shame on Republicans for attempting to shift the focus off police brutality and systemic racism. Joe Biden wants a strong-ethical police force without racism. That's it.
Joe Biden needs to win in November to get a handle on this "Trump Virus".
Racism is an ugly thing to see. This isn't about buildings, broken glass, Bill Barr, or protesters...It is still all about George. Do NOT let Republicans distract you from police brutality and racism. Joe Biden wants strong policing that is ethical. Biden 2020!
It isn't about buildings, protesters or broken glass. It is STILL about George...Don't let Republican Senators fool you. Joe Biden wants ethical, strong policing.
The Republicans want you to forget about the image below. This isn't about Federal buildings or protesters..This IS about stopping police brutality and systemic racism. Joe Biden wants to have strong policing..with ethical-good cops..This is about George...It still is.
Donald Trump touted a MD in his LONE Coronavirus briefing who believes in Alien DNA and Demon sex! For the love of God, Vote Biden 2020!
Thanks for telling us something we didn‚Äôt already know, captain obvious. Sharing an anti-Biden meme doesn‚Äôt make someone pro-Trump.
Trump touts a Doctor who believes in Alien DNA and demon sex! For the love of God...Vote Joe Biden so we can get out of these masks!!!
LIFE under the failed leadership of Donald Trump and RED STATE Senators! Vote Joe Biden 2020!
THIS is the Dr. who Donald Trump may replace Dr. Falci with. We shall see! He sure seemed to like her in his CORONAVIRUS briefing! Alien DNA? Sex with demons??? For the love of God, please vote Joe Biden 2020.
THIS is who Donald Trump values as a Doctor? Will he replace Faulci with HER!? She believes in Alien DNA and Demon sex???  For the love of God vote Joe Biden 2020. Biden will get America HEALTHY Again!
Does Donald Trump really believe that women can be impregnated by spirits???? He seems to be fond of Dr. Stella Immanuel!!! For the love of God vote Joe Biden 2020!
I'm not voting for Joe Biden. He's no better than Trump.  I want to say "I can't believe how much the Democrats have fucked this up", but I can.
Plz quit reminding us that we are going to have to vote for biden. It‚Äôs honestly a smack in the face and not going anywhere past your Twitter and IG echo chamber.
I honestly think the United States should sell Russia a fake vaccine.  We should troll that country when Biden gets elected. Every chance we get.  Divest every dollar.  I want to send Putin back to the Stone Age.
just wait till the truth comes out. Yeah trump is nuts and a fucking dick and asshole at times, but dude he's way way WAY better than ANY Democrat they got.  LiKe Joe biden? Seriously.I mean if you want another 8 years of Obama and our economy to completely end. NO!
Donald Trump still doesn't understand to WEAR A MASK! Mask-less Republicans are a public health risk to our families and children. Vote Biden 2020.
Here we have Donald Trump and the first Lady hanging out with the pedophile and an accused pedophile groomer. You sure won't catch Joe Biden and his wife hanging out with Pedophiles!

So Joe Biden is full on trying to lose my vote I guess.
Biden's notes: ‚ÄòDo not hold grudges‚Äô against Kamala Harris
Trumps America today while he's trying to scare the country about a Biden America months from now. Trump can't be held responsible for the virus being here, but he's 100% responsible for the lack of handling of it.  He may take NO responsibility but we will hold him responsible
What did Biden do in the White House for 8 years to combat long-standing racial inequities.  I'll wait...
Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden promised Tuesday that his economic agenda would combat long-standing racial inequalities as he sought to draw another sharp contrast with President Donald Trump.
Not by this much.  She was up 4 at this point, Biden is up 10.  Trump is losing in all of the swing states.  He will have to win PA and FL, and he's down big in both.  Its over, have your fun while you can.
If Andrew was still around today.....  Biden would be a non-factor. Trump would be ahead 14 points Obama and Hillary would be in jail. Epstein would still be alive and awaiting trial.
The difference is that Biden is a tad more senile than Trump. Not an easy accomplishment.
Joe Biden was a lobby seeking Democrat and now he's a weekend at Bernie's Democrat Candidate for President. My God these Democrats are using the Caronavirus, Democrat big cities and Black Lives Matter riots to scare the American people into voting for a senile old politician.
And they if Biden/McGrath wins they will blame democrats.
No worries. Yeah I‚Äôm usually only ever frustrated at the powers that be so no offense either. Lol, I might talk bad about people like Musk, Biden, and Trump but these people could care less about you and I so no since in getting mad at each other over it. The protests on the 1/
Biden who?   Oh you mean the former VP who will be indicted in October?   The guy no one has seen in months and can't complete a sentence.  That guy?   Embarrassing
There are roughly 7 billion people who will not be voting for Biden.
are they lying to me about with notions of the left. I really don‚Äôt think you‚Äôre a centrist but if you are there‚Äôs a perfect candidate for you, Biden. Elon Musk buys people like him and Trump off so I‚Äôm more focused on the billionaires because they own these politicians. 5/
That made more sense then what ever Biden said. üòÇ

Yeah but ur master drump/45 the racist that he is has 2 answer for 150,000 lives lost on his watch that not he nor u can blame on Obama, #BlackLivesMatter # vote Biden 2020
I think the documents you should be paying attention to more than the platform, which is a mess for a lot of dumb reasons, are the Biden-Sanders unity task force reports.  I think those have a much greater chance to guide policy the next 4 years than the platform
Hmmm I dunno Warren has been Tweeting PRO Biden....I was for Warren but now my vote will go to Biden. #DumpTrump2020
Donald Trump is a great president during these hard pandemic times because the economy hasn't tanked like it would have under Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton or Jim Crow Joe Biden.
Black farmers are Jim Crow Joe Biden's answer to minority unemployment, Trump proved he could manage this problem already before the plague.
Backed into a corner again not happy with the current president and not happy with Biden.
sharper contrasts with their opponents and they need to pick better wedge issues, in particular when it comes to healthcare and business owners. That being said, I think that all goes out the window with Trump and Biden should, instead, do nothing that could alienate traditional
Imagine how cool it would be if instead of just voting for Biden because hes just a bit better than trump people got pissed off they were only given the options pile of shit #1 and pile of shit #2
Definitely Rice. The best addition to the Dem's insurance policy. Biden/Rice would claim immunity from "politically-motivated" investigations; Rice brings the shields of being black and a woman; and winning would provide the ultimate umbrella coverage for the Deep State.
These people were never planning on voting for Biden. They are using Warren as an excuse. They only want chaos. Don't fall for it.
Jim Crow Joe Biden want more dark farmers raising his watermelons for him, that's his economic plan for minorities.
Biden vows to fight racial inequalities with economic agenda
JoeBiden: America has never lived up to our founding promise ‚Äî and we can‚Äôt rest until we finally do. My new plan will advance racial equity across the American economy and bring us closer to reaching our highest ideals:
When someone says they‚Äôre a Biden supporter, show them this! üò≥üëÄ
I think Donald Trump and William Barr are planning on putting that Unitary Executive Theory into practice when Trump loses to Joe Biden.  They will try to steal America. democracy.  Then the time for protesting is over.  That‚Äôs when we fight.
Our next VP, will be announced next week!!!‚úä  Biden says he will choose his running mate next week
I can‚Äôt take people seriously who put Joe Biden and Donald Trump on the same level.  To me, that disqualifies someone as either being a critical thinker or an intellectually honest person.
To his credit, Biden‚Äôs campaign has shifted leftward pretty hard with his $2T climate plan, $2.2T healthcare overhaul, and $750B childcare/elder care plan. It‚Äôs just not far enough left for the situation we find ourselves ‚Äî or at any other time, really. Not nearly far enough.
No one is saying not to. Biden is not the person who I wanted but he is our only option. like I said I feel backed into a corner and it's just not right.  but in the end it is what it is üò©
Does anyone believe Biden, Hunter, Obama?
Oh believe me I want Trump out of office. Accepting Biden fully has been a struggle for me, it's something I've been going back and forth with for a long time.
Good point. Only an idiot would imagine you can a. push Biden left or b. achieve Universal Healthcare during his Presidency.
JoeBiden: In good times, communities of color still lag. In bad times, they get hit first and the hardest. And in recovery, they take the longest to bounce back.  We have to break the cycle, and I‚Äôve got a plan to do it:
watching biden talk for extended periods of time makes me want to fucking kill myself
It's official Joe Biden is toast
. "I've never misled anybody."  Also Joe Biden: Mitt Romney is "going to put you all back in chains."
I have to laugh when I see people say shit like 'Biden will put this country back on track' like he can barely string a few words into a sentence, idk who you're talking about
Isn't it?  I would argue that the only reason Biden supports gay rights now is because the libertarian party has been advocating for such rights since the 70s.  As an example.
Okay.  Democratic and Republican Secretaries of State and their local poll workers - equal parts Republican and Democrat - across the nation, conspired together to cheat for Joe Biden.
Joe Biden is SCARY! This is answering a question üá∫üá≤
Joe Biden doesn‚Äôt have a clue about what the confederate flag is a Virginia battlefield flag. The Democrats are the ones that started the KKK and started using the confederate flag against the black citizens of the United States of America
Well, the info you have right now is a bunch of people like me will not vote for Biden. Zero chance. We also will not vote for trump.  We WILL vote.   So be pragmatic, if you wish to be. Because I won't accept your pragmatic solution.

Bernie was the M4A candidate. Biden said there were better ways
Forgetting conventional wisdom: who do you all think will actually be Biden‚Äôs VP?
2 cont.) Remember the folks storming the Florida 2000 recount? Rump is working to assure he has such forces available to send to any state at a moment's notice to pressure election officials to back down in his favor. Note this can't happen if Biden wins despite any close states.

Bill says Biden is the establishment and that Bernie supporters hate Biden and Trump is saying Biden is a Bernie/AOC puppet. Hmm
Have a celebratory drink. Then buckle in for the rough ride we will have until Biden is sworn in.
Dude they are seriously censoring actually doctors because of what. They have the 60+ years of test and they are clearly just stating what they have personally experienced.  I DONT CARE TRUMP BIDEN NON OF THAT! THIS IS ABOUT HUMANITY DUDE. Why else would they censor this
Speaking as a proud leftist I‚Äôd love to know how we‚Äôre the problem in politics since our choice (Bernie) keeps getting cheated. There‚Äôs the real majority. Did you see his crowds vs Biden‚Äôs?! But no, the minority centrists got their way in Joe Biden who is really more 1/

Media was saying the same thing in the Democratic race this time around between Biden/Bernie, then all of sudden Biden takes the lead and the W.
They moved away from the casket after only a few minutes to greet 2 others &amp; all 4 returned to the fore, mostly sharing memories of Sen Lewis. At one point, Biden reached over, resting a hand on the casket as he spoke. Emotional farewell to an old friend &amp; colleague.
Expect this bs if Biden commits to a debate.

Biden‚Äôs Clean Energy and Infrastructure plan calls out Zero Emission transit. That‚Äôs why our recent investments in transportation tech are so important. If you don‚Äôt have that in place won‚Äôt be able to take advantage of the deluge of fed money coming down the pipe.

Failed Republican leadership in Florida, Arizona, and Texas remind us all to vote for ALL Democrats in November. We must elect Joe Biden to get rid of this deadly "Trump virus".
I guess you forgot about Biden going  broke from helping his son fight cancer that President Obama stepped in to keep him from losing his house.
Failed Republican leadership in Florida, Texas, and Arizona has reminded us all to vote straight Democrat tickets in November! We must vote for Biden 2020!
The Republican party has become a tyrannical mess. They seem to be using our Homeland Security as their own personal-partisan militia against the opposition party! These men are not properly trained and many of them have gotten hurt from improper training I assume. Biden 2020.

I find THIS even more disgusting. Joe Biden won't hang out with pedophiles who find little 9 year old girls sexual! NOT my candidate! Donald has made a mess of Coronavirus as well!
You call THIS Law and Order. Hanging out with a convicted pedophile and a accused pedophile groomer? I will stay with honest Joe Biden and his doctor wife. NOT Trump! Ride that pedophile train if you want! Not me!
Great. President Trump can be in South Bend and debate a empty chair.  It might have a better chance and make more sense than Biden.
And you're evidence is what?  You libs floated that balloon in 16 and it's Hillary that hasn't accepted the results of that election.  What evidence do we have that Biden and the democrats will accept their loss in November?  It's your side that cries "TAMPERING" when you lose.

I can't think about what we could've had for too long or I get upset. We could've had Bernie and real change, but instead we got Biden, who just embodies the word milquetoast.
He's gonna lie because no one can hold him accountable. He and 45 are going to cheat everyway possible to win the election because they know they are done if Biden wins. If Biden does both, among others, will sneak out if the country in the middle of the night. Wait and see.

As long as the person they pick is well vetted and doesn't have anything in her past that crooked Trump can use as a smear campaign. Trump and his dictator allies will stoop to the lowest levels to attack Biden and his running mate.
Even on his worst day, POTUS is more a 100x more coherent than Biden.  Trump isn't senile.  But Biden is #DEMENTIAJOE!

I thought Biden already pledged to only serve 1 team?
Of course your viewers are going to think media is rooting for Biden, but they fail to consider that Trump is an abnormally bad President. His coverage is bad, because his conduct, morals, temperament are all bad. They want propaganda not reporting. Fox gives it to them.

I'm not a dem, and I won't be voting for Biden. Don't assume just because I don't like Trump that I'm a Democrat.
Don't forget Biden is senile.
Trump blaming Biden for everything that is happening during his administration is peak Trump.
In your dreams, most of us can see Biden is a child molester, Obama was gay, with a tranny as first lady, Bill was a adulterer and a child molester...all were traitors!!! This is the Demonrats best!?!?!? When Horowitz's report comes out, most will be in Gitmo.
I predicted the Dems would never debate the President on the same day they announced Biden as a candidate.
A reality check. Even if you believe in lesser evils there are fucking fools out there in national newspapers and periodicals saying nonsense like "Biden is gonna be FDR 2.0!!" As long as that horseshit is in the air, we need a voice of reason.
The last 2 Demonrat Presidents, and the one running...Bill Clinton, adulter, child molester, traitor, wife a lesbian and a traitor. Barack and Michael Obama, homosexual and a tranny, now Ol Chomo Joe Biden, child molester and traitor.These are the best Demonrats have to offer?!?!
I truly wished we had a good Christian running for the Presidency!  Biden and the Democratic platform on abortion are NOT it.  Trump can't seem to be truthful.  Time and time again our allies have been insulted!  Prayer!
Now, THIS is creepy. Coons said his daughter did not think Biden creepy. He was offering her words of encouragement amid a chaotic situation. Only a pervert or true pedophile would find that creepy. Trump, however... an admitted rapist...he BRAGGED about it!
To me, those elbows are easily made into a good talking point for Biden. ‚ÄúYes, I heard what the Senator had to say in that debate and I needed to hear it. I need strong women of color with a different point of view to give me perspective on things they‚Äôve endured that I haven‚Äôt.‚Äù
ended this policy and Biden land to not only bring it back but EXPAND it.
New Biden Ad Fails To Explain How He Would Have Handled Coronavirus Differently
Is Biden still mad at Harris over her going after him in the debate?
Biden Administration Risk For Energy Sector Reaches Beyond Domestic Policy Fuel surging upward, Iran in ascendency in the Middle Esst, no energy independence for USA, what could possibly go wrong?
THIS IS AN ADMITTED RAPIST.  And. For more accurate interpretation of the Biden encounter with the little girl.   Creepy? People who look into that innocent gesture trying to find creepy? THAT is really creepy.
We will see a series of Trump rallies with him at a podium and an empty on labeled "Biden".  Night after night after night.  Or with giant stuffed chicken, either works. #debate #Election2020 #ElectionTwitter

This should be a Biden ad: ‚ÄúThis is what will happen if you vote for Biden‚Äù.   We could win on this alone.   Also - we need a constitutional admendment that requires a person to own a dog before being allowed to run for any elected office.
Fuck Joe Biden. That‚Äôs all.
Is Joe Biden a coward for not debating Trump???
Biden is a total coward everyone knows that
Biden needs to pick someone who can help him win.
You don‚Äôt think Biden is a coward????
"progressive leaders behind the pledge all said they are voting for Biden and working to elect him...planning to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars on an effort to persuade swing-state progressives who are on the fence to get behind Biden."
How convenient, you know Biden would not stand up to trump in a  debate, this whole election looks to be rigged
Right‚Äîthis is just the platform. They're exerting the influence you get from winning votes. There's a huge difference between advocating for policy positions (this) &amp; doing something to hurt Biden and benefit Trump (not this)
Biden would never suggest people inject themselves with disinfectant. So who is senile?
The first ‚ÄúBelievers for Biden" event is a Racial Equity Policy Roundtable with Seema Sadanandan on Thursday! I'll be there with  Register here:
Donald Trump isn‚Äôt more pro-2A than Joe Biden, Trump is just slightly less anti-2A than Biden.  is clearly the most pro-#2A candidate on the ballot. #ImWithHer #VoteGold #VoteLikeYourLifeDependsOnIt
"Due to covid-19" the debates will not be face-to-face on stage. They will be streamed, and Biden will be reading off a teleprompter or have a device in his ear where he can be prompted for answers.  There's no way his handlers can let him go face-to-face with President Trump.
He wont lose this should not be answer who wants a old man in office cant remember what day it is joe biden will probably die before he out of office
JoeBiden: Women-owned small businesses like Marsh + Mane are the backbone of communities across the nation. We have got to do more to invest in and support them.  Here's what I'll do as president:
Joe Biden knowing where he is.
Watching Trump beat Biden by a landslide will not be as fun as seeing the dem majority congress decimated. That will be awesome.
Name bugs bunny as the VP for all it matters, neither he nor Biden will get to the White House
A bit of advice for Bill‚Äôs wife : if you want Biden to win, you should endorse  !  You are so toxic that your endorsement is a campaign killer, Deary!
JoeBiden: The hard truth is women ‚Äî and particularly women of color ‚Äî have never had a fair shot to get ahead in this country. That's why today, I'm releasing my plan to make sure women can fully participate in our economy and country.
If the Candidate wasn‚Äôt Biden, I‚Äôd say you were right.
Just look at bidens past statements about race he‚Äôs a racist , President Trump isn‚Äôt the head of cia is a gay man , he‚Äôs been lbgtq forever , Biden not Trump supported gay marriage long time ago &amp; took shit for it ! You don‚Äôt know a thing so as usual call me

JoeBiden: The hard truth is this pandemic didn‚Äôt have to be this bad. Ron Klain, former White House Ebola Response Coordinator, breaks down what a Biden administration would have done differently and what we would do now to get this virus under control:
looking forward to  smoking you.   but also looking forward to a return of intelligent criticism by the conservative Loyal Opposition to a Biden Admin (and I'm a liberal).  I miss those days.
You do realize that Hunter Biden has a Law Degree from Harvard and was an officer in the Army. None of the Trump offspring can touch that. In fact, I think 2 of Trumps kids might be retards.
You actually think that there are people out there, that don't know, you don't inject yourself with cleaning products!?!?!? NOBODY IS THAT STUPID!!!! FAKE NEWS!!!    Well, someone like Fredo Cuomo, Don Lemonhead, Rachel Madcow, Chomo Joe Biden might...Lmao!
A year after the infamous Ukraine call where Trump asked for a "favor" connected to allegations about Biden, and inside of 100 days before Election Day -- there is growing evidence that repeated and scattershot attacks on Biden are falling flat.  via
Biden has built up a significant lead over President Trump in polls, and his strength coupled with Trump‚Äôs weakness is lifting Democratic candidates across the country.
Drove past a Walmart in the middle of nowhere KY yesterday and there was an outside post selling TRUMP TRAIN flags, posters, etc. My girl said ‚Äúwhy dont they sell Biden gear too!‚Äù I said ‚Äúbecause Biden voters arent political merch buyers. They just hate trump‚Äù #cultofpersonality

Considering Obama had 8 years to defeat radical Islamic terrorism yet it only grew greatly during that time and Trump decimated radical Islamic terrorism‚Äôs final form in ISIS in not even a quarter of that time, that comparison is a huge self-own. Biden likely IS a Trojan horse.

I think I've seen more 'John Edwards for President 2008' bumper stickers, than 'Joe Biden for President 2020' bumper stickers.
Biden's plan is to veto Medicare For All if it comes to the White House.  Sounds like waiting four years vs. never happening at all is the better option. The #KHive is off their rockers.
Pelosi, Shumer, &amp; Biden 125 years of doing a shitty job!
Changing the president is a Band-Aid at best, albeit an important one. But once you see Biden sending crackdown squads to protests too, the tweet below will be all the more relevant.
If they had ignored Trump and focused on a easy to understand idea -like SAVING PEOPLES LIVES AND THUS SAVING THE ECONOMY- we could be seeing Biden still being +9 everywhere AND ALSO lots of GOP MoC willing to vote for such a package.  Because people don't want to go broke &amp; die.
Donald couldn't get the military to do his partisan dirty work, but he found what many say is his own personal vindictive militia with Homeland Security. Citizen formed National militias have been reported to be forming to neutralize Donald Trump's personal Militia. Biden 2020!
Evangelicals for Biden. Join us. Morality matters.
I'ma vote for Joe Biden but he's gotta do something to make sure we CAN STILL VOTE in less than 100 days.  Lead the Party in Congress and in state houses across the country in ACTUALLY RESISTING #FascistTrump &amp; the utterly unconstitutional and tyrannical overthrow of the US.
How do you feel about the Republican Pandemic response? Hundreds of thousands of bodies have been buried. Who is next? Please vote for Joe Biden 2020. He will end this pandemic!
How many more are going to die? 150,000 people have died as a result from Donald Trump's and red state Senators failed leadership! Vote all Democrat in November. Vote Biden 2020!
"I wish her well". Women vote Joe Biden 2020.

Joe Biden wants to reach out to ALL Evangelicals. Many Evangelicals have left the Trump campaign since Donald Trump used OUR most Holy Bible as a cheap-photo-op PROP! Evangelicals and women vote Biden 2020!
Does THIS look like Law and Order to you? One of these people is a pedophile. Possibly two. Can you guess who they are? Mothers and all women vote Biden 2020.
You won't catch honest Joe Biden and his wife hanging out with a pedophile and an accused pedophile groomer.....Mothers should vote Biden 2020.
All voting for Biden ü§î
He would chew you and tRump up and spit you out. And you know it.  Why waste Biden's time?
Ann Coulter has no damn sense plain and simple. This idiot should either shuck her voting duty or vote for senile Joe Biden. She's thin skinned like a lot privileged women I've witnessed by-God.
Talk about FALSE NEWS! This an appalling smear of Joe Biden and the Democratic Party.
Trump created the China travel ban, that Joe Biden critized him for!  How many more people would have died if Biden was in charge?
Question of the day for Tim.  Have you even been following Vice President Biden's plan? Because if you did, you would find out that you are full of üí©. Apparently lying is a trait you and your butt buddy Terrible Trump have in common.
Him and Biden are in the basement together?
The crime rates, as per Trump, are skyrocketing while TRUMP is President.  The thing he says will happen under Biden.
I wonder if Joe Biden will ‚Äúdecline‚Äù the debate with President Trump? I hope not.
No matter who Biden selects for his running mate, put your preferences aside and vote Blue. Every vote counts on November 3rd. Its time to take back our country from the criminals in Washington.
Biden will outrun McGrath in KY-03, 04, and 06. McGrath will outrun Biden in KY-01, 02, and 05.
Beshear won Franklin, Scott, and Madison. I don't know if Biden will do that but I can see him winning Fayette and getting over 40 in the other 2.
Actually I heard final 4 also included Harris and Warren, but Bass and Duckworth were the favorites.  Warren has too much baggage and age. Harris may be a little too grasping for Biden. Bass and Duckworth are well spoken and young.
You actually think that Biden would be better? Have you been paying any attention to what‚Äôs been going on in liberal run cities? You think that‚Äôs better for America?
Do you really think Biden will need 132 million votes to beat Trump ?
Look conservative Republicans have nothing to do with you. Your republican party is radical right. It‚Äôs become a fringe group. Even Republicans don‚Äôt recognize it anymore. This is why they are willing to vote for Biden to bring it back to center.
Biden is a coward
And Biden is still in hiding
It would be nice if Biden would simply appear! This peek-a-boo campaign strategy didn‚Äôt work for Hillary &amp; it won‚Äôt work for Mr. Biden! He‚Äôs months away from the election &amp; he‚Äôs in hiding!
While I highly doubt that Joe Biden ever will have the guts to debate President Trump this year, if Biden does agree then I guarantee Joe will come to us ‚Äúout of an abundance of caution‚Äù via satellite.
Are You Sure 'Vote for Joe Biden or We'll Kill You' Is the Best Campaign Pitch?
Just imagine, when Biden is president there will be no more fascist nonsense. Our cities will be more peaceful. We will have violence thanks to far tight crazies because they like to stir up trouble. But it will be a marked difference from what we have under you!
Nurse must have killed brain cells in the process of breathing air into Joe Biden.
How the Bad Orange Man hickied my girlfriend‚Äôs neck, and why I‚Äôm so mad I‚Äôll vote for Joe Biden to set the record straight
Looks like a Biden town hall. Wait...
Not sure what is more frightening... a Biden win, or the retaliation to follow Trump‚Äôs second term.
Marvin, the Lord helps those that help themselves. He is extremely displeased that Trump has done nothing to help his people. That is why Jesus will be on Joe Biden's side. Let's hope you are on the right side with Jesus this November. There is no excuse not to be.
I would say it is impossible to look at it all.  Biden might lose. He might win in the largest victory since Washington.   We could get lucky and giant meteor will solve everything.  If I were a betting man, I would put money on Biden. Words I never would have said not long ago.
And my last point... Why would anyone put out a poll like that?  I suspect it is right... But it creates a false sense of breathing room for the Biden camp. Fox news is running their own "Biden wins" polls, and they have gone to court for decades defending their right to lie.
If Biden's Electoral College win is free and clear, mechanisms outside of Rump's control will install Biden as the president on January 20. Rump will likely spend the transition trying to get his ass out of legal jeopardy and being the typical belligerent asshole he is.
Will Biden win?  I think so. But picture a revolt in the GOP at convention, and they pick a new candidate... This could happen in a hail Mary to save the entire party from sinking.
had Obama / Biden for 8 years , Biden ,pelosi,Schumer etc senator‚Äôs for over 45 years each and done zero for minorities. Trump President for 3.5 years justice reform /police reform fully funded h.b.c.u‚Äôs etc he‚Äôs done more than all others mentioned
The math used is solid. Surprisingly small samples are predictive. But if the wrong questions are asked, then, well, no one knows.  For example, what happens if 3 women come out and say Biden raped them, and in the trump case of rape, the DNA doesn't match?
Well, the new president on Jan 20, presumably Biden, will be president no matter where he is. He can easily ask the Secret Service to remove Trump &amp; his sycophants at any time. The first line of defense is having civil service employees fulfilling their oaths to the Constitution.
I legitimately hope Biden nominates a strong vp. If he wins, the dude cannot do the job effectively.
I wasn‚Äôt defending the Dems.   I just want *decent* people elected.  I think Biden is decent.   On a friendly note...  ‚ÄúPlease don‚Äôt abuse your furry lil‚Äô friends‚Äù Love that. üòªüíïüê∂ We ALREADY have common ground. ‚úåüèºüòÅ

And what‚Äôs more, Joe Biden has yet to pay tribute to the courageous patriots who won the Revolutionary War Battle of LaGuardia.
Dems hated him for enacting the China travel ban! How many more would have died with Biden
‚ÄúDanger! Danger, Will Robinson!‚Äù  Wake up America. Biden's path to the White House could hit a dead end on Facebook
I don‚Äôt like Biden but trump has lost his mf mind.  He‚Äôs openly racist and talks about protestors like they are the enemy.  He‚Äôs just a hustler who became president
Just a bit of perspective: Joe Biden and Mick Jagger are the same age...
Hmm-hmm. Biden is up by 10 points everyone! He's totally gonna win. HAHAHAHAHAHA!!
Biden criticism of trump for placing a China travel ban in January, how many more dead of biden was president!
Dont believe that bs man!They're literally the ones doing all the shit butmaking it out on how trump is handling it and I know for a fact I'm not voting for  vote is with trump man.Hes the one that truly helps build this economy and country.The dems are Not
Getting out of the bunker might be good for Joe Biden.
No.  I wished to express that that "is a bug, not a feature."  Biden should be calling for fundamental changes.  He isn't.  He is calling for more my net for police that are openly abusing citizens in city after city in America RIGHT NOW.
Biden doesn‚Äôt even know where he is.
Boris Johnson is 'desperate' for Donald Trump to lose to Joe Biden - Business Insider
Still had time today to Tweet about Obama and Biden, just stop
Totally agree. Want to see Biden with at least 55%. That would be higher than Obama. It would rival the Reagan victory over Carter.
Biden is a joke.  Defund the police is a joke.  Militia in Louisville shooting each other.  The clowns can't get out of each other's way.  I laugh.  Enjoy the second term nothing you can do to stop it. In fact you are ensuring it.
How demented is Biden? He could suffer intracranial collapse &amp; STILL be 10x smarter than Trump. THAT'S  how "demented" he is!
So you are saying Biden is a lefty‚Äîdon‚Äôt you actually mean liberal (neoliberal in particular)?
This woman is almost as incompetent, nonsensical and delusional as Joe Biden. Almost.
Hiden Biden can‚Äôt get thru an interview
Come out hiden Biden! Coward
I'll answer for Mr. Biden. 1.  Ever seen "Weekend at Bernie's"? 2. If he does, they'll be doctored.  So to speak. 3. No, any VP pick will be much as a puppet as Biden will be.  There will be "Men behind the curtain" leading this country.  Unanswerable, unelectable.
Biden can't articulate a thought.  Good luck with that.  Enjoy the second term.
Biden‚Äôs going to be shocked when he finds out he was a candidate in this election
*this joke paid by Joe Biden for President*
Biden's path to the White House could hit a dead end on Facebook
Twitter and Facebook become targets in Trump and Biden ads
You wait and see, if Chomo Joe Biden gets elected, those Demonrat mayors and governors, will start shooting them down, just like they did in the past. A Republican freed them, but they're all for Demonrats. Explain that if you will, I can't understand it, don't make sense.
If you think this is far-fetched or not a real possibility, you're not paying attention!
Biden should use this clip in a campaign ad!
The next VP is on this list! Biden-Streisand 2020!
Don't worry. The Bernie or Bust voices on Twitter are few and far between in the real world. His "revolution /movement" fizzled long before it began. They are loud but merely trying to produce chaos now and its not working. Biden has this 100%.
It‚Äôs officially 100 days from President-elect Joe Biden.
I love how TMZ talks about these peoples views of voting for Biden is a return to nazism and say "insane". Where was the outrage for 3 1/2 years politicians, media have been calling trump hitler? Are all those people insane too TMZ?
Oh trust me we can go in on Biden too. However, that doesn‚Äôt change the facts about DJT and children.
I don't think his choice has anything to do w/ "like." It's all part of the Dem's insurance policy. Biden/Rice would claim immunity from "politically-motivated" investigations; Rice, shields of being black and a woman; and winning would provide the ultimate umbrella coverage.

A bipartisan group secretly gathered to game out a contested Trump-Biden election. It wasn‚Äôt pretty  via
I don't see Pence in power... ever.  Biden will win in Nov.  Pence will write a religious screed disguised as an autobiography.
You may have missed the fact the electoral college has been blamed. Others voted for her because they hated trump, and thought she could win. They didn't vote FOR Clinton, but AGAINST trump. The same arguments being used with Biden today.
Biden never turned a blind eye to Russian bounties on American soldiers, either...
And by the same logic any vote for trump is a vote for Biden too.
If you had half a brain, YOU'D support Biden, too. #RepublicansForBiden
In a political environment where national pride and patriotism are somewhat fraught, Tammy Duckworth may be the perfect choice to restore honor and respect to the office and the country.
LOL!!!! You and your polls. Do you really think we believe you anymore? Conservatives will rise up this November and re-elect  A vote for Biden will Make America Hopeless Again! #Trump2020 #MAGA2020
For all those people who make snide comments about Biden and how he handles kids, let me remind you that he is a grandpa, that's how grandpa's treat young kids, and he was pininga flag on him. We all know how Trump treats young kids. It's well documented.
I wish all 254 of my followers would cut and paste this and tweet it out right now:  JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.

Biden's voting history says otherwise.  I trust his actions far more than his words.
what a joke!  CBS forgot to say Biden was 14 points ahead two weeks ago not 9. Gee you all leave out a lot! Fake News!
It won't be Biden. His party has allowed 50 years of progress in downtown Louisville to be ruined in less than a month.

Which policy of Biden's would Jesus support?
Have you looked at biden's voting record?
That's why they want Biden. Obama will be his master telling what to do. TRUMP 2020
Don‚Äôt just assume that the polls are correct and Biden‚Äôs got this. Get out and vote in November. Every Blue vote counts. Let‚Äôs beat these Republicans on every ballot.
The meeting shown in the video illustrates the larger role Obama is expected to play for Biden in the months before November.
You're already backing down if you vote Biden. From your perspective it must be a lose/lose election. It's either vote for a true racist or vote for a guy that the media TELLS you is a racist. Either way. Violence will get you nowhere. Good luck! Hahaaaa
Biden is the real racist just look at what hes done in his career he‚Äôs had 8 years as v.p. And. 45 as a senator and did nothing but put black ppl in prison
...but while Biden is the fox that #MalcolmX warned us about pretending to be our friend, Trump's administration is filling the Federal courts up with white supremacists judges with lifelong seats. Outside of Black issues this bit*h is also killing the whole country. (2 of 2)
lol I'm not interested in they're perversions. Here's the deal. Throughout Biden's he's always targeted Black people and "minorities" for the reign of "European" Supremacy, or like HE said "NOT African, NOT Asian, but we European blah blah blah... (1 of 2)
But Biden isn‚Äôt president. Trump is lol.

The liberals and Biden called Trump names because he stopped flights from China. Which tells me that Biden and crew would have killed millions if they were running the government. Trump would have done more but Biden, Media and Congress was to busy impeaching Trump. What a shame.
Conservative icon George Will plans to break the habit of a lifetime for the 2020 election by voting for Joe Biden in order to help defeat Donald Trump.
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
I have a joke about Joe Biden but uhhh I forgot it already.
Copy and paste this text and tweet it:  JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
I think it‚Äôs Biden‚Äôs second day in office plan??
His Mail-in Ballot will still read "Joe Biden" for president.  #Cheattowin
Obama/Biden were all hot air while simultaneously selling America out to communist China.
Although now that I listened to the video, they we‚Äôre making the point that this is where we‚Äôll be if we elect Biden. I don‚Äôt agree with that, but it is a legitimate protest, and mostly peaceful.
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
Unlike tRump, Biden is capable of doing more than one thing at a time.
I guess the metoo movement died with Joe Biden huh?
I have a Joe Biden joke but.. it's.. well you know, the thing!
What about Biden and how much he and his family made off of China, I‚Äôm sure your OK with that?
I feel like djt has this election in da mfkn bagg. Ppl so sick of the same old corruption there is no way Biden could get more votes
The way I look at it, I'm voting for Biden, but if he wants my enthusiasm and my money, then he needs to adopt progressive policies, esp. with regards to health care access.  True universal access should be a given now.
Supporting a pile of turds, or Biden, against an open fascist is OK.
JoeBiden: I know firsthand how hard it can be to take care of an aging family member. It's why as president, I'll ease the financial burden on families and expand access to dignified care for older Americans.
Biden may have ‚Äúdementa‚Äù, but it‚Äôs your boy who has taken cognitive decline test more than once.
Go Bitin'...I mean Biden!
Hoping he has a Trump Crimes Commission lined up and ready to roll on the first day. Biden can focus on the economy and the virus...which I think we'll still be dealing with.
I‚Äôm not voting for Biden.
And like zero percent of Biden supporters even have a sign or a bumper sticker apparently. I live in Kentucky and haven‚Äôt seen one enthusiastic Biden supporter.
Jim Crow Joe Biden is definitely senile and is reading a script from gripey old communist Bernie Sanders.
Biden has to do a video asap talking to police and say strongly he will not defund police. Trump is going to use ir, even tho he has said he wld not. Trying to scare people. Do a video on keeping America safe before this gets too far.
Certainly not Joe Biden, he lives in the most expensive house on his state, and worth millions
Excited to see  getting the attention she deserves in the veepstakes. A genuinely worthy choice here.
And how to help steal the election again , wants his help again, last thing Putin wants is President Joe Biden
Joe Biden has been selling America out to communist China for years.
They did the right thing n my opinion ur just racist asf that's all remember racist Republicans the national anthem means something different 2 black &amp; brown ppl #BlackLivesMattters # vote Biden 2020
Who‚Äôs done the damage, Trump was a Russian agent, Kavanaugh was a rapist, impeached for the same crime Joe Biden bragged about, why would anyone believe these people, ever!
Biden and Dems Are Set to Abolish the Suburbs
Hell yes I &amp; we meaning the BLM movement greatly appreciates the help of the #WallofMoms &amp; the #WallOfVets fuck drumps secret police # vote Biden 2020
The Corrupt News Network must have been on a Biden commercial break.
We've got to stay focused... Please remember who is currently residing in The White House... I by no means  think Biden is a perfect candidate by any means, but it's a no-brainer for me who better aligns with my views... gaffes and all...
Joe Biden told trump he was xenophobic for implementing a travel ban against China back in February.  How many more Americans would‚Äôve died with Joe Biden power????

If there is racism in Louisville Kentucky,Chicago,st.louis , Baltimore, Seattle , Minneapolis etc etc it has to be the democrats fault has to be they been in charge for decades in these cities 3.5 years ago Obama /Biden ran the USA for 8 years! Well? Deny tha
I was so against Biden but we can't allow Trump to take office again so Biden has my vote. Don't worry about what others think of you, that's their problem not yours.
Voting for Trump = Making America Great Again!  Voting for Biden = Making America Hellish Again!  Choose wisely America ... Choose wisely!!   #MAGA2020 #Trump2020 #Biden2020
If Booker is so meta that he‚Äôs actually mocking the people seeing Russian bots beneath their beds at night, that‚Äôs actually pretty hilarious. I think he‚Äôs pandering to the typical Biden voter tho, which...why? He lost the primary because of them
W this rigged election voting for anyone but biden is voting for trump. I was definitely of this protest vote mindset before and it‚Äôs unproductive. We‚Äôve already been bullying biden into progressive policies. Third party is never going to be productive without rep. in congress.
Let's see if it works. More than Obama and Biden ever did, am I right?
Joe Biden and Barack Obama had EIGHT YEARS to accomplish this. Why didn't they?!
Kings, NY. San Francisco, CA. (He will still get crushed there but I can see more leftist gentrifiers sitting out especially if Biden seems like a heavy favorite)  Maybe some small heavily Hispanic counties in South Texas where Beto underperformed Hillary.
JoeBiden: Every American family deserves access to affordable, high-quality child care.  Here's how I'll make that happen:
Is Joe Biden going to support School Choice?
Biden &amp; Obama also quit testing this help
Why would the Democrats lose the next election? The odds are ever in their favor, and the voting public is generally not as educated as they need to be. Are you betting on Joe Biden making a fool of himself in debates against Trump?
Donald Trump and Joe Biden
The mail carrier just delivered my neighbors ‚ÄúElle‚Äù magazine to me. I wonder where our ballots will be delivered?  In person voting is critical to a valid election. #election #Trump #Biden
Mail in ballots are not the answer. I want to go to the polls and physically slide my ballot in the box, so I know my vote counts. If we can survive weekly trips to the grocery, I‚Äôm sure we can survive a single visit to a polling site. #election #Trump #Biden
Trunp has handled this far better that Obama &amp; Biden did with the N1H1 that is said to have killed more than the COVID. It is hard to tell given Biden &amp; Obama stopped testing and reporting with the News Media hiding it from Americans. Where did all the Meds go during Obama-Biden?
Yes Lord we need thier help fuck drumps secret police #BlackLivesMattters #WallofMoms #WallOfVets # vote Biden 2020
The Offical White House portrait of Trump that Biden hangs should actually just be a mirror.  That way when people walk by it and see themselves they‚Äôll know this was a time without leadership.  A time that all we had was to look to each other for hope.
Biden will name Cap N Crunch to head the Navy.
I'm starting 2 think that all Republicans are racist asf do u agree ....? #BlackLivesMattters #WallofMoms #WallOfVets # vote Biden 2020
U hv the power 2 place those racist cops under arrest 4 the murder of Breanna Taylor #BlackLivesMatter # vote Biden 2020
Let's see...you've settled for the riots, refunding the police, illegal immigrants. The only thing you've aspired for is your daily pudding cup. Behind every Joe Biden tweet is a caregiver
Why are those racist cops that killed Breanna Taylor not n jail yet ü§î #BlackLivesMattters # vote Biden 2020
She turns 35 in October of 2024 so she could technically run. Whether or not she will likely depends on if she runs for statewide office in NY between now and then and who Biden‚Äôs running mate is.
Stop sucking conservatism's üçÜ #BlackLivesMatter # vote Biden 2020 #WallofMoms #WallOfVetsShe is compassionate, intelligent, understands the way the federal government works, and would be a huge support to you as VP. Much like you were to Obama. She has a huge following and we are all ready to fight for a Biden/Harris ticket. We must win this election.

We know Joe Biden because you won‚Äôt be President.  #FridayFeeling
Biden isn't even the nominee, guy is just a stand-in and will likely get "hospitalized" during or right after the dem convention. Can't have him being interrogated over #ObamaGate.
#EvictTrump would be a major mistake.  Joe Biden as president would be worthless to the United States.  The economy; your 401(k) would be represented by the picture below. #ThursdayThoughts
Biden is not even close to being a socialist. I wish that were the truth. Biden is a moderate Republican from 10 years ago.
Look i done talking to you. You very apparently have never worked in a good business with a bad owner and it shows. You just hate him so much you refuse to see the good. Forget that Biden is a hands on child sniffer! Trump said the nword! Those kids and cages
You belong in chains, now I know what Joe Biden was talking about in 2016, when he said Trump would put them back in Chains, they were all criminals, maybe not a comment about Slavery, but they knew what he meant.
‚ÄúJoe Biden has done a great voice for freedom!
You owe Joe Biden an apology

Bailey is a Beautiful dog! Go Joe Biden,Nov.2020
Biden isn't the one that has paid millions to settle multiple child rape lawsuits. That would be Trump and it's public record. Suspicion vs. facts.
Dear ‚ÄúBiden allies‚Äù, whoever the fuck you are: please kindly shut the fuck and cut it with this sexist pile of poop.
I‚Äôd pay my life savings to the Biden for president campaign if he could spell ‚Äúcognitive‚Äù correctly.
Oh i don't care about homosexuality. I really don't care about the bible. Its a great story and all but i do not believe in it. I was just helping another person out with that. Now as to the kids
Joe Biden. Trump would bankrupt the company by stealing the money for himself.
Biden is so ambitious he's on his third run for president. If he chooses Kamala, he might make it this time.
Biden can pass a high school civics class. Trump believes the president is above the constitution and he can deport citizen children born to immigrants. It's really a no brainer....as in Trump doesnt have one.
Ok, how about better reality...

So is Biden, or have you forgot the ukraine wants him?
Better yet, what has Biden done in the last almost 50 yrs, including being VP for 8 of those yrs?
So you would let Biden near little girls?
It really is. I saw a lib post today over trump Jr being twitter jailed today. Lol, he said that the great thing about America is that if you don't like twitter, you can start your own platform. I wanted to say that wouldn't happen if biden wins...
Here's the best question, would you put you daughter, niece, or close cousin within arms reach of Sniffy Joe Biden?
My thoughts are...why weren't the other candidates written up that way??? Being selected with a Biden quote? She was the only one. This waiting is killing me!
Wow! What projection on my part? The russia collusion was not done by trump. It was by Biden for his son. They have it on tape. I mean seriously, you can't be so embroiled in this to not see that. But anyway, research. Always research. And good luck sweetie..
But fascism is what we have in America if Biden wins. Can you not see that or are you just too angry?

Mike Huckabee: Joe Biden avoids interviews because ‚Äòhe says something utterly ridiculous‚Äô every time
Does she realize that the systemic racism is coming from Democrat controlled cities and systems.  Someone give her the anti-crime bill written by Joe Biden and Bill Clinton.
Oh, I think they will mandate it. Well IF Biden is president; if Trump is president then we keep our freedoms. I‚Äôm sticking with Malaria meds if I get it. They try to scare you with dude effects too boost vaccines, but anyone must take it if go somewhere like Haiti etc. It works.
If Biden wins,yes. They don‚Äôt care about Christians or godly principles. Abortion, sexually immorality,&amp; govt control are some top reasons they hate us.Everyone has the right to be born who God knits together, Bible- marriage is between man &amp; a woman. God is our leader &amp; freedom.
Just another mess the Biden administration will have to clean up. üò∑

Progressive, I guess, here.  Will vote for Biden. Don't like him. Wouldn't vote for him given a better alternative.  There are a lot of progressives that will. Twitter and Reddit loud-mouth contests aren't always in line with reality.

Trump is merely  puppet  for the billionaire ruling class. Having Biden as our president is not REALLY going to change ANYTHING  We'LL just  be exchanging one puppet for ANOTHER. In light of all the civil unrest, billionaire class will ALLOW  Biden to make Minut useless change!

Jeff....when will you start asking questions about Biden's obvious onset of dementia ?
Don't get me wrong, I don't agree with Trump 100% either but at least he's not a placeholder for whoever becomes Biden's VP. Somebody that would never be elected as POTUS but can sneak in through the backdoor when Biden gets deemed incapable of office.
This seems like a lot of pain for little reward, while trump tends to not be pushed, they will go out of their way to tear Biden down, just look at 2016
Unfortunately for Dems he is a mental giant compared to Biden. He can't even field questions.
Didn't Biden basically say that Americans can't tell the difference between Koreans and Chinese? Doesn't anybody see this as a racist statement-i.e. all Asians look alike?

Yes,I think most are law abiding too. What worries(lack of a better word) me is people voting Biden simply because they hate Trump-based off of 3 years negatives said about him or personal dislike; rather than seeing the economy,war on drugs/cartel, abortion limits etc he‚Äôs done.
