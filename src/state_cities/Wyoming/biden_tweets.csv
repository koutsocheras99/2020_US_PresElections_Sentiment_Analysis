little gift for those arguing online with biden supporters today!!! (I didn‚Äôt make this)
True but like we had a primary with solid choices. Biden won the primary pretty easily that's on us lile we have to rally behind him because sadly its bigger than him. Like I have no emotions about what Biden said Trump is so evil and corrupt as a Black man im just gonna have to.
Anyone who votes Biden is voting against America.
Biden is utter trash tho frfr
please Biden family, STOP letting the DNC exploit Joe's dementia...
Gosh, I had no idea Biden is so powerful he can abolish God. Impressive!
I pray for him nearly every day as I'm sure others do as well. We have to keep praying because if Biden is elected this country is going to become a third world shit hole.

Democrats now the billionaire party... at End of June, 56% of Trump support is small donors under $200 - Biden support is 57% in large donations from wealthy people... imagine that!
This conversation got further than any conversation Joe Biden has ever attempted to have. ü§£
Joe Biden has been mentally incompetent his entire life. But now he has late stage dementia too. His supporters know it, but still think he's "cool."
No one is voting for Joe Biden. Everyone can see he's on the road to the late stage dementia facility. People are supporting who they think he VP will be.

Biden doesn‚Äôt even know he‚Äôs running for President, he‚Äôs a fool !!
BIDEN isn't picking anyone or anything. He's a mindless fool. Obama is running that show and he's picking the next President, not Vice President.
LIARS... Biden campaign says it has agreed to debates already, but Trump camp has not
Can't think of a better reason to vote for Biden.
COMMUNIST... Karen Bass, on Biden VP shortlist, scrambles to explain remarks on Castro, Scientology
U said lack of leadership well I assume your voting for Biden who was against the travel ban and later said it was the right call so your dumb the guy you wanna vote for would have killed thousands more even fauci said the travel ban was a great call your a dummy
the dems are researching the 12th amendment, why? Biden may try to pick Barack as his VP.  Google states the law/ 12th amendment has never been challenged in court.  Why would Barack do this?  He could be the FIRST (and only black) president and VP in US. Mark my words.
watch Biden pick Barack for his VP.  Barack will accept because it will make him the FIRST (and only black) president and vice president of the US.  Mark my words.
I'm thinking Biden is going to pick Barack Obama for V.P., and Obama will go for it because he will be the FIRST president and vice president if Joe is elected.  See its good for his ego.
Biden isn‚Äôt picking a VP, he‚Äôs picking the next President... and actually, Obama is doing the picking!
Bass has been a card-carrying Communist for her entire career. This is DNC IDEA OF MODERATE? California paper urges Biden to pick Karen Bass over Kamala Harris for running mate

Had to have been a staffer. I don't think Biden is smart enough to know how to tweet.
Trump is such a joke of a wannabe president, I can‚Äôt wait until he loses to Biden, so he can get everything he deserves..  Karma is going to be a real bitch to him, and it will be about time..

Listen Biden would have kept are borders open and not enforced the travel ban like trump which would have lead to more deaths. Even Biden months later said it was the right call so Biden would have been worse dummy lmao I wish democrats actually knew more than a cnn headline
Dems are fighting for 600 a week so people won‚Äôt go back to work. It‚Äôs no secret they want the economy to crash to get there power back it‚Äôs sad they don‚Äôt put Americans first like your president trump does. Can u picture Biden fixing anything other than oatmeal

If you support crime, riots, looting, arson, freeloaders, perverts, social communism and economic collapse, you'll have to vote for Biden. Trump's against all these things!So Bidin is a Catholic? Did I miss something? When did the Catholic Church say it was ok the murder unborn children? I thought they believed that was against God? If true then President Trump was wrong about Biden being against God. Right?

VP Biden would miserable fail the cognitive test that President Trump passed with a perfect score!  VP Biden's mind is in no way as competent as President Trump's mind!
By not voting, you‚Äôre saying that you don‚Äôt care who gets put on the Supreme Court.  You may not love Biden but you‚Äôre not just voting for him, you‚Äôre voting for his Supreme Court nominee.  Think of the long game, folks! The future.  It‚Äôs not just about 4 years.
Does anyone that is sane really think, having the first presidential debate after the early voting has started &amp; state primary elections is another way to sway the election?  When voters see Biden losing what mind he has left after they voted will be maddening to some!
He thinks he‚Äôs running Biden‚Äôs campaign he forgot he‚Äôs just a cross eyed game show host
Nah cuz Biden wouldn‚Äôt remember
I'm amazed that Democrats don't see that VP Biden stating that he will pick a black woman for his VP is in fact completely SEXIST and RACIST for setting that criteria!  A VP pick should be chosen strictly on MERIT and NOTHING ELSE!
For once, just once, I want to see a woman BITCH SLAP VP Biden across the face with her hand when touching them UNINVITED from behind, then file a police report on him for assault!
Can we all please agree Biden can‚Äôt formulate a sentence and Trump can‚Äôt pronounce ( Yosemite )
Biden is looking so forward to the debates with our great President, he has to leave the basement before that can happen, how does Biden think he can run our country when he can‚Äôt leave his house, totally ridiculous!
Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden will not travel to Milwaukee to accept his party's White House nomination because of concerns over the coronavirus.
I'm to the point where the LincProj has short circuited my brain and I think Biden is running as a Republican like someone demanded early on (Some More News maybe?)
I don‚Äôt understand how anyone could vote for sleepy Joe? (Wait, that‚Äôs not Joe Biden?). Hate this darn hand computer tricking me.
Biden has pledged to select a woman and is facing calls to choose the first Black woman to compete on a presidential ticket.
The vetting has resurfaced internal party divisions between the old-guard establishment and a younger generation that's more attuned to gender and racial biases.

Biden:  ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to do a big executive order [to do] DACA. We put it in, and we‚Äôll probably going to then be taking it out. We‚Äôre working out the legal complexities right now, but I‚Äôm going to be signing a very major immigration bill as an executive order.‚Äù  Senile I say.

This is the number one reason why I retired to Casper, WY, to liberate myself from the Democrats!  I expect President Trump to win by more than the 68.2% that he did over Hillary in 2016 for Biden in 2020!

Ma‚Äôam my husband is not white. I‚Äôm not a racist and I see Trump and Biden both having a shot in Texas.
With Biden you get 100% leftism and yet a reinvigorated conservative movement.  With Trump you get 95% leftism and a base that is helping Trump get to 100%.  Solution: punish Trump and vote 3rd party to send a message to him and all RINOs. We won‚Äôt stand for betrayal any longer.
Did you believe Trump when he said he‚Äôd win the last election? Look I don‚Äôt agree with everything he says and does but, this was regarding the rally in Tulsa. If Biden wins he‚Äôs said he will shutdown fracking on day one. I get to vote how I want and you get

Tensions linger between Biden and Obama camps throughout 2020 primary campaign: report
Let's be clear... a vote for Biden/Harris is a vote against America. We'll be taking notes...
I will tell all of my friends and co-workers to vote to Biden like our lives depend on it.. I use to say that Trump is dangerous, well he is proving it now.. He has to go!!
And leftist organization and activism would be easier and more effective under a biden presidency no?
Organizing and protesting same as we would fight trump. Not only would biden not send the bagger vans but would cave in more than trump ever would
Agreed I dont like vote bullying trust me. But moving biden to the left will be way easier and productive than stopping trump from moving further and further right. Yeah let's organize but let's also work smarter so we don't have to work harder
As a former never biden person, I'd say we would have an easier time moving biden left than we would in stopping trump from continuing to move right. Not that it matters to me I live in a very deep red state so my vote here is wasted anyways so I'd organize as well

Hey Donny, you better be voting for Biden.  This country needs a good president and you are failing at your job.
Weeks from Biden saying "you ain't black" and that blacks are monolithic in their voting, his handlers choose a VP candidate that has done more harm to blacks than most in recent memory.   Bang up job, team Biden.

Hey.... Us simple rube trolls... I know are way less brilliant and sophisticated than...well, than the likes of you? But we have watched the gradual decay of numerous large, decades Dem run cities and being simple, think logic would say, Biden would bring that nationwide.
As for Biden being better? My opinion is he, like Sanders and many others, would be nothing had they not sucked off the teat of governmental power.
So.... You believe Biden and Harris are only running to save us from Trump? Alao, Trump is so self centered that he has lifted the yoke of government more than really any prior.... But through Biden's stated platform of more tax and regulation, he is doing you more good?

‚ÄúEvery single American should be wearing a mask when they‚Äôre outside for the next three months at a minimum ‚Äî every governor should mandate mandatory mask wearing," Biden declared.

While the pandemic made a traditional campaign rollout impossible, it gave Biden and Harris a setting to emphasize their criticism of Trump as unable to contend with the most severe public health crisis in a century. Harris was particularly critical.
No, no, didn't see a Biden decal on his forehead, just one of those Chinese paper masks!  LOL
I noticed how Biden and Harris violated COVID-19 guidelines when Biden put his mask on the lectern, touched his face multiple times, then walked away after introducing Harris, then went back to retrieve his mask.  Harris touched her face multiple times as well!  LOL

Well... Yes, she's a leftist.... Dangerous... But Biden and Gore were just as bad.
I wish he would have at least tried to advocate for himself more, and stopped calling Joe Biden his fucking friend. Either way, the result is the same.
The Democrat Party has REVEALED their racism by nominating racist VP Biden for President and he nominating Kamala Harris as his VP who is a descendant of slave owners!  The Democrat Party is morally bankrupt in their lust for power at all costs to include losing American lives!
That analogy about Biden being like your ex's hoodie fucking sucks. Also just want to flex that no one ever got my Opeth Morningrise hoodie. It was too powerful.
A token black woman,  so maybe as Joe "your not black" Biden must have figured out that  smelled better than the rest.  And this is his chance to appoint the First Black Female Democrat to the Senate. All hail President Harris.  We all know how this is going down.
The Democrat voters rejected Kama Harris in the primaries, yet now they are going to vote for her as VP and eventual President when VP Biden is incapacitated?  NO DAMN WAY!
In selecting Kamala Harris as his VP pick, Joe Biden has given into the mob. As a San Francisco lawyer and California Senator, Kamala Harris has been for eliminating private health insurance, decriminalizing illegal border crossings, &amp; a massive tax hike on hardworking Americans.
Kamala Harris is NOT a radical leftist. She's actually like, a moderate right winger, just like Biden lol
Given the fact that Biden is on Death's door, and can barely put a sentence together, I have to politely disagree. But adopting any meaningful progressive policies would have went a long way.

Harris,¬†a 55-year-old first-term senator, will be the first Black woman to compete on a major party's presidential ticket.
Harris, a 55-year-old first-term senator, is also one of the party‚Äôs most prominent figures and quickly became a top contender for the No. 2 spot after her own White House campaign ended.
The DUMBEST move VP Biden can make is to elect Susan Rice as his VP, way worse than Kamala Harris in getting people to vote for President Trump because of how bad Susan Rice is because of Benghazi!  There is no way patriots are going to allow the liar of Benghazi to be VP!

Given that Trump advanced Obama‚Äôs agenda more than Hillary ever could have dreamed of doing, I‚Äôd say a vote for Trump over Biden is the actual vote to accelerate the destruction of the country.
Three of Wyoming‚Äôs top elected officials are calling for presidential candidate Joe Biden and current President Donald Trump to hold a debate in Wyoming.
It‚Äôs becoming increasingly clear that Biden is the lesser of the two evils.    Now, I would never vote for Biden but I certainly won‚Äôt vote for the greater of the two evils either.  Writing in Sessions or going Constitution Party this go ‚Äòround is the only sane option.
The fact is, for several key reasons, Trump is much worse than Hillary would have been, or Biden will be.  If you don‚Äôt understand this then you haven‚Äôt been paying attention.  Listen to  to gain a clue.
Biden allies hope the historic nature of his pick might help energize two key Democratic constituencies: women and people of color.
That and Biden is a weirdo around kids.. plus how is he gonna say ‚ÄúU ain‚Äôt black, if u vote for Trump‚Äù? Like they didn‚Äôt catch his ass saying some racist shit.. look up.. when he was younger he literally went in film and said some anti Black shit ..
Admit it Mark, you want Biden to pick Harris just for the future comedy value. üòÅ
Trump should do a press conference:  ‚ÄúI‚Äôve ordered my FBI to do no more investigations into the Biden campaign than Obama had his FBI investigate into mine.‚Äù
Leadership Dems prefer Trump, otherwise why nominate Biden?  Trump has done more to advance Democratic policy than Hillary ever could have.  They want more of the same.  With Biden hiding, he‚Äôs beating Trump. Hence, they need Biden out in the public eye so he can lose support.
This is so painfully obvious I literally don‚Äôt understand how some people on our side don‚Äôt see it.  No previous Trump voter will vote for Biden. They just won‚Äôt vote for Trump.
It's ironic to me that Democrats falsely accuse President Trump of being a racist, while ignoring the completely racist comments coming out of VP Biden's mouth in the past month!  Democrats have always been and continue to be the racists, using minorities solely for their vote!
I'm amazed at how Democrats can't see the incompetence of VP Biden in picking his VP that was due on 1 AUG 20, and here we are now on 8 AUG 20 and he still hasn't announced his VP pick!
You would be correct sir. I think it's a setup too, to get both biden with Ukraine,  and Susan with the tarmac meeting.
I'm in Casper, WY.  Wyoming voted 3 to 1 for President Trump over Hillary in 2016.  I expect an even greater spread against Biden in 2020!
VP Biden's criteria for a VP pick is PURE GENDER DISCRIMINATION and RACISM!
Legionnaires' disease is not being misdiagnosed as COVID-19, and a missile wasn't responsible for the massive explosion in Beirut. Here are the facts.
So Bidin is a Catholic? Did I miss something? When did the Catholic Church say it was ok the murder unborn children? I thought they believed that was against God? If true then President Trump was wrong about Biden being against God. Right?

VP Biden would miserable fail the cognitive test that President Trump passed with a perfect score!  VP Biden's mind is in no way as competent as President Trump's mind!
